https://openalex.org/W2519315590,"Hepatotropic viruses are important causes of human disease, but the intrahepatic immune response to hepatitis viruses is poorly understood because of a lack of tractable small- animal models. We describe a murine model of hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection that recapitulates critical features of type A hepatitis in humans. We demonstrate that the capacity of HAV to evade MAVS-mediated type I interferon responses defines its host species range. HAV-induced liver injury was associated with interferon-independent intrinsic hepatocellular apoptosis and hepatic inflammation that unexpectedly resulted from MAVS and IRF3/7 signaling. This murine model thus reveals a previously undefined link between innate immune responses to virus infection and acute liver injury, providing a new paradigm for viral pathogenesis in the liver."
https://openalex.org/W2519145264,"Metagenomics is a trending research area, calling for the need to analyze large quantities of data generated from next generation DNA sequencing technologies. The need to store, retrieve, analyze, share, and visualize such data challenges current online computational systems. Interpretation and annotation of specific information is especially a challenge for metagenomic data sets derived from environmental samples, because current annotation systems only offer broad classification of microbial diversity and function. Moreover, existing resources are not configured to readily address common questions relevant to environmental systems. Here we developed a new online user-friendly metagenomic analysis server called MetaStorm (http://bench.cs.vt.edu/MetaStorm/), which facilitates customization of computational analysis for metagenomic data sets. Users can upload their own reference databases to tailor the metagenomics annotation to focus on various taxonomic and functional gene markers of interest. MetaStorm offers two major analysis pipelines: an assembly-based annotation pipeline and the standard read annotation pipeline used by existing web servers. These pipelines can be selected individually or together. Overall, MetaStorm provides enhanced interactive visualization to allow researchers to explore and manipulate taxonomy and functional annotation at various levels of resolution."

Mammalian silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1), a NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase, is an important regulator of various cellular processes, including proliferation, metabolism, and circadian rhythms. In the liver, SIRT1 coordinates the circadian oscillation of clock-controlled genes, including genes that encode enzymes involved in metabolic pathways. We performed partial hepatectomy in WT and liver-specific Sirt1-deficient mice and analyzed the expression of cell cycle regulators in liver samples taken at different times during the regenerative process, by real time PCR, Western blotting analysis, and immunohistochemistry. Lipidomic analysis was performed in the same samples by MS/HPLC. We showed that G1/S progression was significantly affected by absence of SIRT1 in the liver, as well as circadian gene expression. This was associated to lipid accumulation due to defective fatty acid beta-oxidation. Our study revealed for the first time the importance of SIRT1 in the regulation of hepatocellular proliferation, circadian rhythms, and lipid metabolism during liver regeneration in mice. These results represent an additional step toward the characterization of SIRT1 function in the liver. Liver regeneration offers a distinctive opportunity to study cell proliferation in vivo.

Here we demonstrate that unweighted UniFrac is highly sensitive to rarefaction instance and to sequencing depth in uniform data sets with no clear structure or separation between groups. We show that this arises because of subcompositional effects. We introduce information UniFrac and ratio UniFrac, two new weightings that are not as sensitive to rarefaction and allow greater separation of outliers than classic unweighted and weighted UniFrac. With this expansion of the UniFrac toolbox, we hope to empower researchers to extract more varied information from their data."

Here, we report the high resolution structures of the major pilin subunit, PilA, from three Acinetobacter strains, demonstrating that A. baumannii subsets produce morphologically distinct type IV pilin glycoproteins. We examine the consequences of this heterogeneity for protein folding and assembly as well as host-cell adhesion by Acinetobacter Comparisons of genomic and structural data with pilin proteins from other species of soil gammaproteobacteria suggest that these structural differences stem from evolutionary pressure that has resulted in three distinct classes of type IVa pilins, each found in multiple species."
https://openalex.org/W2519457012,"Background Chronic diseases, like diabetes mellitus, heart disease and cancer are leading causes of death and disability. These conditions are at least partially preventable or modifiable, e.g. by enhancing patients’ self-management. We aimed to examine the effectiveness of telephone-based health coaching (TBHC) in chronically ill patients. Methods and Findings This prospective, pragmatic randomized controlled trial compares an intervention group (IG) of participants in TBHC to a control group (CG) without TBHC. Endpoints were assessed two years after enrolment. Three different groups of insurees with 1) multiple conditions (chronic campaign), 2) heart failure (heart failure campaign), or 3) chronic mental illness conditions (mental health campaign) were targeted. The telephone coaching included evidence-based information and was based on the concepts of motivational interviewing, shared decision-making, and collaborative goal setting. Patients received an average of 12.9 calls. Primary outcome was time from enrolment until hospital readmission within a two-year follow-up period. Secondary outcomes comprised the probability of hospital readmission, number of daily defined medication doses (DDD), frequency and duration of inability to work, and mortality within two years. All outcomes were collected from routine data provided by the statutory health insurance. As informed consent was obtained after randomization, propensity score matching (PSM) was used to minimize selection bias introduced by decliners. For the analysis of hospital readmission and mortality, we calculated Kaplan-Meier curves and estimated hazard ratios (HR). Probability of hospital readmission and probability of death were analysed by calculating odds ratios (OR). Quantity of health service use and inability to work were analysed by linear random effects regression models. PSM resulted in patient samples of 5,309 (IG: 2,713; CG: 2,596) in the chronic campaign, of 660 (IG: 338; CG: 322) in the heart failure campaign, and of 239 (IG: 101; KG: 138) in the mental health campaign. In none of the three campaigns, there were significant differences between IG and CG in time until hospital readmission. In the chronic campaign, the probability of hospital readmission was higher in the IG than in the CG (OR = 1.13; p = 0.045); no significant differences could be found for the other two campaigns. In the heart failure campaign, the IG showed a significantly reduced number of hospital admissions (-0.41; p = 0.012), although the corresponding reduction in the number of hospital days was not significant. In the chronic campaign, the IG showed significantly increased number of DDDs. Most striking, there were significant differences in mortality between IG and CG in the chronic campaign (OR = 0.64; p = 0.005) as well as in the heart failure campaign (OR = 0.44; p = 0.001). Conclusions While TBHC seems to reduce hospitalization only in specific patient groups, it may reduce mortality in patients with chronic somatic conditions. Further research should examine intervention effects in various subgroups of patients, for example for different diagnostic groups within the chronic campaign, or duration of coaching.

https://openalex.org/W2519026499,"Regular consumption of low-dose aspirin reduces the occurrence of colorectal, esophageal, stomach, and gastrointestinal cancers. The underlying mechanism is unknown but may be linked to inhibition of angiogenesis. Because the effective doses of aspirin are consistent with the inhibition of cyclooxygenase-1 in platelets, we used liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry analyses and immunoassays of human platelet releasates coupled with angiogenesis assays to search for the mediators of these effects. Blood or platelet-rich plasma from healthy volunteers stimulated with platelet activators produced a broad range of eicosanoids. Notably, preincubation of platelets with aspirin, but not with a P2Y12 receptor antagonist, caused a marked reduction in the production of 11- hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE) and 15(S)-HETE, in addition to prostanoids such as thromboxane A2. Releasates from activated platelets caused cellmigration and tube formation in cultured human endothelial cells and stimulated the sprouting of rat aortic rings in culture. These proangiogenic effects were absent when platelets were treated with aspirin but returned by coincubation with exogenous 15(S)-HETE. These results reveal 15(S)-HETE as a major platelet cyclooxygenase-1 product with strong proangiogenic effects. Thus, 15(S)-HETE represents a potential target for the development of novel antiangiogenic therapeutics, and blockade of its production may provide a mechanism for the anticancer effects of aspirin.—Rauzi, F., Kirkby, N.

https://openalex.org/W2520058395,"Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is an important crop worldwide. The physiological deterioration of seeds during storage and seed priming is closely associated with germination, and thus contributes to plant growth and subsequent grain yields. In this study, wheat seeds during different stages of artificial ageing (45°C; 50% relative humidity; 98%, 50%, 20%, and 1% Germination rates) and priming (hydro-priming treatment) were subjected to proteomics analysis through a proteomic approach based on the isobaric tandem mass tag labeling. A total of 162 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) mainly involved in metabolism, energy supply, and defense/stress responses, were identified during artificial ageing and thus validated previous physiological and biochemical studies. These DEPs indicated that the inability to protect against ageing leads to the incremental decomposition of the stored substance, impairment of metabolism and energy supply, and ultimately resulted in seed deterioration. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis revealed that the up-regulated proteins involved in seed ageing were mainly enriched in ribosome, whereas the down-regulated proteins were mainly accumulated in energy supply (starch and sucrose metabolism) and stress defense (ascorbate and aldarate metabolism). Proteins, including hemoglobin 1, oleosin, agglutinin, and non-specific lipid-transfer proteins, were first identified in aged seeds and might be regarded as new markers of seed deterioration. Of the identified proteins, 531 DEPs were recognized during seed priming compared with unprimed seeds. In contrast to the up-regulated DEPs in seed ageing, several up-regulated DEPs in priming were involved in energy supply (tricarboxylic acid cycle, glycolysis, and fatty acid oxidation), anabolism (amino acids, and fatty acid synthesis), and cell growth/division. KEGG and protein-protein interaction analysis indicated that the up-regulated proteins in seed priming were mainly enriched in amino acid synthesis, stress defense (plant-pathogen interactions, and ascorbate and aldarate metabolism), and energy supply (oxidative phosphorylation and carbon metabolism). Therefore, DEPs associated with seed ageing and priming can be used to characterize seed vigor and optimize germination enhancement treatments. This work reveals new proteomic insights into protein changes that occur during seed deterioration and priming."

Acteoside has displayed multiple biological functions. Its potential role against PD and the underlying signaling mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we showed that oral administration of acteoside significantly attenuated parkinsonism symptoms in rotenone-induced PD rats. Further, acteoside inhibited rotenone-induced α-synuclein, caspase-3 upregulation and microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) downregulation in PD rats. The molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation results indicated that acteoside may directly bind to and inhibit caspase-3. Acteoside formed hydrogen bonds with at least six residues of caspase-3: ThrA177, SerA178, GlyA238, SerB339, ArgB341 and TrpB348. In addition, a pi-pi interaction was formed between acteoside and caspase-3's HisA237, which might further stabilize the complex. MD simulation results demonstrated that the binding affinity of the caspase-3-acteoside complex was higher than that of caspase-3 and its native ligand inhibitor. Together, we show that acteoside binds to caspase-3 and exerts neuroprotection in the rotenone rat model of PD."

The pKM101 plasmid encodes a T4SS similar to the well-studied model systems from Agrobacterium tumefaciens and Brucella suis. Here, we studied the structure and function of TraE, a homolog of VirB8 that is an essential component of all T4SSs. Analysis by X-ray crystallography revealed a structure that is similar to other VirB8 homologs but displayed an altered dimerization interface. The dimerization interface observed in the X-ray structure was corroborated using the bacterial two-hybrid assay, biochemical characterization of the purified protein, and in vivo complementation, demonstrating that there are different modes of dimerization among VirB8 homologs. Analysis of interactions using the bacterial two-hybrid and cross-linking assays showed that TraE and its homologs from Agrobacterium, Brucella, and Helicobacter pylori form heterodimers. They also interact with heterologous VirB10 proteins, indicating a significant degree of plasticity in the protein-protein interactions of VirB8-like proteins. To further assess common features of VirB8-like proteins, we tested a series of small molecules derived from inhibitors of Brucella VirB8 dimerization. These molecules bound to TraE in vitro, docking predicted that they bind to a structurally conserved surface groove of the protein, and some of them inhibited pKM101 plasmid transfer.

https://openalex.org/W2520696950,"This year’s Lasker Basic Medical Research Award is shared by William Kaelin, Peter Ratcliffe, and Gregg Semenza for discovery of the pathway by which animal cells sense and adapt to changes in oxygen availability, which plays an essential role in adaptation to a wide variety of physiologic and pathologic conditions. This year’s Lasker Basic Medical Research Award is shared by William Kaelin, Peter Ratcliffe, and Gregg Semenza for discovery of the pathway by which animal cells sense and adapt to changes in oxygen availability, which plays an essential role in adaptation to a wide variety of physiologic and pathologic conditions. One thing we all learned in grade school is that oxygen is really important. Each time we breathe, oxygen is taken up through our lungs into the bloodstream and carbon dioxide is expelled. The oxygen consumed is essential for producing a robust energy supply with which to maintain the viability and function of the 40 trillion cells within our bodies. This is because our cells have two major mechanisms for producing ATP from glucose: glycolysis, which can take place anaerobically but is highly inefficient at generating ATP, and oxidative phosphorylation, which maximizes ATP yield but requires oxygen. Cells can also use oxidative phosphorylation to produce ATP from fatty acid and amino acid degradation, further increasing the amount of energy that can be extracted from nutrients. Since the metabolic demands of a complex nervous system or muscle-based motility are impossible without efficient ATP production, the harnessing of environmental oxygen for energy production was essential for the development of multicellular animal life as we know it. As a result, how cells catabolize nutrients and oxygen to produce the ATP required to maintain cellular bioenergetics has been the subject of numerous scientific prizes. Moreover, when it became clear that organs such as the brain, heart, and muscle are uniquely dependent on efficient production of ATP through oxidative phosphorylation, another generation of prizes was awarded for the discovery and characterization of proteins, such as hemoglobin and myoglobin, that can either carry oxygen to or buffer oxygen reserves in these vital tissues. Despite these extraordinary accomplishments, until recently, one aspect of oxygen metabolism remained unresolved—namely, how animals sense and adapt to changing levels of oxygen availability, a function that is essential for adaptation to high altitudes and is dysregulated in disease states such as cardiopulmonary failure or anemia. This year’s Lasker Basic Research Award is being awarded to three scientists for their discovery of the central oxygen-sensing system that allows animals to sense and adapt to physiological variations in oxygen. Although William Kaelin, Peter Ratcliffe, and Gregg Semenza worked independently, their work collectively uncovered the molecular mechanism by which organisms sense and adapt to low oxygen levels, or hypoxia. The solution to the problem began with erythropoietin, a hematopoietic growth factor produced by the liver and kidney. Erythropoietin promotes generation of red blood cells in the bone marrow, thereby raising the blood’s oxygen carrying capacity. In an elegant series of experiments that started with his interest in learning more about gene regulation mechanisms, Semenza made the key initial discoveries that broke open the field. Using transgenic mice, he uncovered sequence-specific binding of a transcription factor to the hypoxia-response element (HRE) in the 3′ enhancer region of erythropoietin when liver cells were subjected to hypoxia (Semenza and Wang, 1992Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (2191) Google Scholar), and then biochemically purified the factor (Wang et al., 1995Wang G.L. Jiang B.H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5030) Google Scholar), a heterodimer that he dubbed HIF-1 (hypoxia inducible factor 1). Both components of this heterodimer were members of the bHLH-Pas family of transcription factors, and while the HIF-1β component (also known as ARNT) was constitutively expressed, expression of HIF-1α varied in an oxygen-dependent fashion. Betting that HIF-1 did more than regulate erythropoietin expression, Semenza started digging deeper. A critical advance came when he discovered that HIF-1α also induced vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which plays a key role in angiogenesis (Forsythe et al., 1996Forsythe J.A. Jiang B.H. Iyer N.V. Agani F. Leung S.W. Koos R.D. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4604-4613Crossref PubMed Scopus (3197) Google Scholar). This suggested that HIF-1α was at the center of an oxygen-sensing mechanism important for controlling both the generation of the vascular system and the production of red cells to carry O2 within the bloodstream. To confirm the essential role of HIF-1 in these organismal processes, Semenza then made HIF-1α mutant mice. In the absence of HIF-1α, he indeed found that vascular development and oxygen-dependent gene expression were severely impaired, leading to embryonic lethality (Iyer et al., 1998Iyer N.V. Kotch L.E. Agani F. Leung S.W. Laughner E. Wenger R.H. Gassmann M. Gearhart J.D. Lawler A.M. Yu A.Y. Semenza G.L. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 149-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (2044) Google Scholar). Over this time period, Semenza’s work was complemented and extended by the work of Peter Ratcliffe. Oxygen sensing was long thought to be a property restricted to a specialized set of cell types, but Ratcliffe showed that HRE DNA binding activity was regulated in an oxygen-dependent fashion in all cell types he tested (Maxwell et al., 1993Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1993; 90: 2423-2427Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). This suggested that HIF-1 was a part of a universal cellular response mechanism to changes in oxygen availability. Ratcliffe confirmed this by demonstrating that the genes encoding glycolytic enzymes were also regulated by hypoxia response elements in their enhancers (Firth et al., 1994Firth J.D. Ebert B.L. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1994; 91: 6496-6500Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Thus, HIF-1 was not only responsible for long-term adaptation to hypoxia at the organismal level, but also could dynamically regulate the rate of glycolysis, the oxygen-independent mechanism of ATP generation, at the cellular level. Unlike Semenza and Ratcliffe, Kaelin came upon the oxygen adaptation pathway through his efforts to make sense of observations in the cancer biology field. From his clinical training, he knew that certain kidney tumors had increased vasculature and lost the tumor suppressor V(H)L, first identified in the von Hippel-Lindau syndrome. However, the cloning of V(H)L had not provided any insights into its potential molecular function. In 1995, Kaelin’s group was one of several to show that V(H)L formed a complex with Elongin B, Elongin C, and CUL2 (Kibel et al., 1995Kibel A. Iliopoulos O. DeCaprio J.A. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Science. 1995; 269: 1444-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Since Elongin C and CUL2 showed homology to the yeast proteins SKP1 and Cdc53, the V(H)L/Elongin/CUL2 complex might function as a ubiquitin ligase and therefore control protein stability. But how did this lead to increased vasculature of kidney tumors? Kaelin hypothesized that the absence of V(H)L might lead cells to produce the angiogenic factor VEGF. Indeed, he found that V(H)L deficiency led to constitutive upregulation of HIF-dependent targets defined by Ratcliffe and Semenza, including VEGF, even in the presence of oxygen (Iliopoulos et al., 1996Iliopoulos O. Levy A.P. Jiang C. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Goldberg M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1996; 93: 10595-10599Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). Based on these discoveries, both Ratcliffe and Kaelin went on to uncover a simple and elegant post-translational oxygen-sensing mechanism. They first showed that V(H)L acted as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for HIF-1α and that ubiquitination of HIF-1α led to its degradation. In back-to-back papers in 2001, Ratcliffe and Kaelin reported that HIF-1α underwent proline hydroxylation in the presence of oxygen and that V(H)L specifically bound hydroxylated HIF-1α to target it for degradation in an oxygen-dependent fashion (Ivan et al., 2001Ivan M. Kondo K. Yang H. Kim W. Valiando J. Ohh M. Salic A. Asara J.M. Lane W.S. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Science. 2001; 292: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (3873) Google Scholar, Jaakkola et al., 2001Jaakkola P.

This of course raised a question: what was controlling the oxygen-dependent hydroxylation of HIF-1α? Ratcliffe, Kaelin, and Steve McKnight independently reported the discovery of a family of prolyl-4-hydroxylases with this function (Bruick and McKnight, 2001Bruick R.K. McKnight S.L. Science. 2001; 294: 1337-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (2106) Google Scholar, Ivan et al., 2002Ivan M. Haberberger T. Gervasi D.C. Michelson K.S. Günzler V. Kondo K. Yang H. Sorokina I. Conaway R.C.

A second oxygen-dependent mechanism of HIF-1α hydroxylation, this time on asparagine residues, was subsequently found to block the ability of HIF-1α to recruit transcriptional coactivators (Lando et al., 2002Lando D. Peet D.J. Gorman J.J. Whelan D.A. Whitelaw M.L. Bruick R.K. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1466-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1219) Google Scholar). This provided cells with a back-up system to block any residual HIF-1 that had escaped degradation from activating transcription of target genes. The discovery of HIF-1α-modifying hydroxylases led to a broader interest in the role of these enzymes as metabolite sensors. In addition to their originally described function as oxygen sensors, subsequent studies have shown that they can also be regulated by other reactants, as well as the products of the reactions they carry out. Each of the enzymes contains a catalytic Fe2+ in the active site to hydroxylate targets using oxygen and alpha-ketoglutarate (αKG) as reactants, producing succinate and carbon dioxide as byproducts (Figure 1). Sustained inhibition of HIF hydroxylation in hypoxia is also accomplished in part through lactate dehydrogenase (LDH-A)-dependent conversion of αKG to L-2-hydroxyglutarate (L-2HG). The resulting L-2HG acts as a competitive inhibitor of αKG binding to the HIF hydroxylases (Harris, 2015Harris A.L. Cell Metab. 2015; 22: 198-200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The broader relevance of this metabolic sensor pathway in cancer became evident in studies involving two other tumor suppressor syndromes with a hypervascular microenvironment similar to that observed in V(H)L mutant renal cell carcinomas. In these tumor syndromes, loss-of-function mutations in either succinate dehydrogenase or fumarase led to high levels of HIF-1 in the presence of oxygen. Without these enzymes, the TCA cycle intermediates succinate and fumarate accumulate, leading to end product inhibition of the HIF hydroxylases. Thus, accumulation of succinate and/or fumarate can prevent hydroxylation of HIF even in an oxygen-rich environment. The HIF-1 prolyl hydroxylases have also been shown to be redox sensors. Both the catalytic Fe2+ and cysteines required for HIF-1’s three-dimensional structure are highly susceptible to inactivation by oxidation under conditions where the mitochondrial electron transport chain activity exceeds cellular ATP consumption. The redox sensitivity component of the proline hydroxylases thus allows cells to adapt not only to hypoxia but also conditions when glucose metabolism exceeds cellular ATP demand. Under these conditions, HIF-1-induced expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDHK) suppresses TCA cycle activity, and HIF-1 induction of LDH-A redirects glycolytic pyruvate into lactate for excretion from the cell. Thus, HIF-1 can protect cells not only from hypoxia, but also from excess nutrient catabolism, by directing cell metabolism from the highly efficient oxidative phosphorylation to the less efficient glycolysis, thus preventing redox stress. The discovery that the activity of HIF prolyl hydroxylases are dynamically regulated within the physiological range of oxygen concentration has led to a renewed interest in the role of oxygen in controlling other cellular activities. As a result, a number of additional oxygen-dependent enzymes have emerged as potential regulators of cellular adaptation to hypoxia. For example, both the TET family of DNA methyl cytosine hydroxylases and the Jumonji family of histone demethylases carry out similar molecular reactions to the proline hydroxylases. These enzymes hydroxylate methyl groups on DNA and proteins, respectively. Like the HIF-1-prolyl and asparaginyl hydroxylases, they also use αKG and oxygen as reactants to hydroxylate substrates and decarboxylate αKG. Since these enzymes have been implicated in the regulation of chromatin accessibility during cellular differentiation, their oxygen dependence has been proposed to provide a potential molecular explanation for why in most adult mammalian tissues, stem cell maintenance is carried out in relatively hypoxic niches. Impairment of the αKG-dependent dioxygenases involved in histone and DNA demethylation has been shown to result from cancer-causing mutations in either isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 or 2. These IDH mutations result in a neomorphic enzymatic activity that produces D-2-hydroxyglutarate, which competes with αKG for binding to this family of dioxygenases, thereby impairing DNA and histone demethylation (Harris, 2015Harris A.L. Cell Metab. 2015; 22: 198-200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the chemistry involved in αKG-dependent dioxygenase function may be used reiteratively in metazoan biology to drive not only adaptive metabolic responses to hypoxia, but to also regulate embryonic development/differentiation under suboptimal nutrient conditions, such as oxygen depletion and TCA cycle dysfunction. It took just under a decade for Kaelin, Ratcliffe, and Semenza to unravel this elegant oxygen-sensing system. However, it is only in the last 15 years that scientists have begun to fully appreciate the broad implications of their discovery. For example, HIF-1 plays an essential role in organismal adaptation to high altitudes, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and other forms of pulmonary distress and contributes to stroke, coronary artery disease, and cancer. It also plays a critical role in cellular bioenergetic adaptation to prevent redox stress and to preserve macromolecular synthesis under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. The role of αKG-dependent dioxygenases in cell processes beyond HIF-1α destabilization has led to a broader appreciation of the role of oxygen in mammalian cell biology well beyond its use in oxidative phosphorylation. It is now appreciated that a wide variety of other cellular processes are controlled by oxygen-dependent enzymes whose dynamic range of activity occurs within the physiologic variation in oxygen levels of viable tissues. Oxygen is required not just for the maintenance of ATP production, it is increasingly recognized as a critical component of the regulation of a wide variety of host events including cellular differentiation, immune defense, and tissue repair.

https://openalex.org/W2518946533,"Benzylisoquinoline alkaloids are a large group of plant-specialized metabolites displaying an array of biological and pharmacological properties associated with numerous structural scaffolds and diverse functional group modification. N-Methylation is one of the most common tailoring reactions, yielding tertiary and quaternary pathway intermediates and products. Two N-methyltransferases accepting (i) early 1-benzylisoquinoline intermediates possessing a secondary amine and leading to the key branch-point intermediate (S)-reticuline and (ii) downstream protoberberines containing a tertiary amine and forming quaternary intermediates destined for phthalideisoquinolines and antimicrobial benzo[c]phenanthridines were previously characterized. We report the isolation and characterization of a phylogenetically related yet functionally distinct N-methyltransferase (NMT) from opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) that primarily accepts 1-benzylisoquinoline and aporphine substrates possessing a tertiary amine. The preferred substrates were the R and S conformers of reticuline and the aporphine (S)-corytuberine, which are proposed intermediates in the biosynthesis of magnoflorine, a quaternary aporphine alkaloid common in plants. Suppression of the gene encoding reticuline N-methyltransferase (RNMT) using virus-induced gene silencing in opium poppy resulted in a significant decrease in magnoflorine accumulation and a concomitant increase in corytuberine levels in roots. RNMT transcript levels were also most abundant in roots, in contrast to the distribution of transcripts encoding other NMTs, which occur predominantly in aerial plant organs. The characterization of a third functionally unique NMT involved in benzylisoquinoline alkaloid metabolism will facilitate the establishment of structure-function relationships among a large group of related enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2520027378,"Extracellular ice nucleation usually occurs at mild subzero temperatures in most plants. For persistent supercooling of certain plant parts ice barriers are necessary to prevent the entry of ice from already frozen tissues. The reproductive shoot of Calluna vulgaris is able to supercool down to below -22°C throughout all developmental stages (shoot elongation, flowering, fruiting) despite an established xylem conductivity. After localization of the persistent ice barrier between the reproductive and vegetative shoot at the base of the pedicel by infrared differential thermal analysis, the currently unknown structural features of the ice barrier tissue were anatomically analyzed on cross and longitudinal sections. The ice barrier tissue was recognized as a 250 μm long constriction zone at the base of the pedicel that lacked pith tissue and intercellular spaces. Most cell walls in this region were thickened and contained hydrophobic substances (lignin, suberin, and cutin). A few cell walls had what appeared to be thicker cellulose inclusions. In the ice barrier tissue, the area of the xylem was as much as 5.7 times smaller than in vegetative shoots and consisted of tracheids only. The mean number of conducting units in the xylem per cross section was reduced to 3.5% of that in vegetative shoots. Diameter of conducting units and tracheid length were 70% and 60% (respectively) of that in vegetative shoots. From vegetative shoots water transport into the ice barrier must pass pit membranes that are likely impermeable to ice. Pit apertures were about 1.9 μm x 0.7 μm, which was significantly smaller than in the vegetative shoot. The peculiar anatomical features of the xylem at the base of the pedicel suggest that the diameter of pores in pit membranes could be the critical constriction for ice propagation into the persistently supercooled reproductive shoots of C. vulgaris."
https://openalex.org/W2520712804,"Kidney transplantation (ktx) in mice is used to learn about rejection and to develop new treatment strategies. Past studies have mainly been based on histological or molecular biological methods. Imaging techniques to monitor allograft pathology have rarely been used.Here we investigated mice after isogenic and allogenic ktx over time with functional MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and mapping of T2-relaxation time (T2-mapping) to assess graft inflammation and edema formation. To characterize graft pathology, we used PAS-staining, counted CD3-positive T-lymphocytes, analyzed leukocytes by means flow cytometry.DWI revealed progressive restriction of diffusion of water molecules in allogenic kidney grafts. This was paralleled by enhanced infiltration of the kidney by inflammatory cells. Changes in tissue diffusion were not seen following isogenic ktx. T2-times in renal cortex were increased after both isogenic and allogenic transplantation, consistent with tissue edema due to ischemic injury following prolonged cold ischemia time of 60 minutes. Lack of T2 increase in the inner stripe of the inner medulla in allogenic kidney grafts matched loss of tubular autofluorescence and may result from rejection-driven reductions in tubular water content due to tubular dysfunction and renal functional impairment.Functional MRI is a valuable non-invasive technique for monitoring inflammation, tissue edema and tubular function. It permits on to differentiate between acute rejection and ischemic renal injury in a mouse model of ktx."
https://openalex.org/W2520206381,"Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and arachidonic acid 15-lipoxygenase (ALOX15) are antagonizing enzymes in the metabolism of hydroperoxy lipids. In spermatoid cells and/or in the male reproductive system both enzymes are apparently expressed, and GPX4 serves as anti-oxidative enzyme but also as a structural protein. In this study we explored whether germ line inactivation of the Alox15 gene might rescue male subfertility induced by heterozygous expression of catalytically silent Gpx4. To address this question we employed Gpx4 knock-in mice expressing the Sec46Ala-Gpx4 mutant, in which the catalytic selenocysteine was replaced by a redox inactive alanine. Because homozygous Gpx4 knock-in mice (Sec46Ala-Gpx4+/+) are not viable we created heterozygous animals (Sec46Ala-Gpx4+/−) and crossed them with Alox15 knock-out mice (Alox15−/−). Male Sec46Ala-Gpx4+/− mice, but not their female littermates, were subfertile. Sperm extracted from the epididymal cauda showed strongly impaired motility characteristics and severe structural midpiece alterations (swollen mitochondria, intramitochondrial vacuoles, disordered mitochondrial capsule). Despite these structural alterations, they exhibited similar respiration characteristics than wild-type sperm. When Sec46Ala-Gpx4+/− mice were crossed with Alox15-deficient animals, the resulting males (Sec46Ala-Gpx4+/−+Alox15−/−) showed normalized fertility, and sperm motility was reimproved to wild-type levels. Taken together these data suggest that systemic inactivation of the Alox15 gene normalizes the reduced fertility of male Sec46Ala-Gpx4+/− mice by improving the motility of their sperm. If these data can be confirmed in humans, ALOX15 inhibitors might counteract male infertility related to GPX4 deficiency.

The redox equilibrium is an important parameter for the regulation of the cellular phenotype, and pro- and anti-oxidative enzymes have been implicated in maintaining the cellular redox homeostasis (1.Olsen L.F.

A disturbed redox equilibrium has been related to the pathogenesis of metabolic, cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative disorders (3.Karunakaran U. Park K.G.

Amoêdo N.D. Rumjanek F.D. Energy and redox homeostasis in tumor cells.Int. J. Cell Biol. 2012; 2012: 593838Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The redox homeostasis is balanced among other things by the catalytic activities of pro- and anti-oxidative enzymes. Alox15 (12/15-lipoxygenases) and Gpx4 (glutathione peroxidase 4) have previously been identified as important players in this regulatory network (7.Brigelius-Flohé R. Maiorino M. Glutathione peroxidases.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2013; 1830: 3289-3303Crossref PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar, 8.Haeggström J.Z. Funk C.D. Lipoxygenase and leukotriene pathways: biochemistry, biology, and roles in disease.Chem. Rev. 2011; 111: 5866-5898Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Alox15 is capable of oxygenating polyenoic fatty acids to the corresponding hydroperoxides, and thus, it up-regulates the cellular oxidative potential (9.Ivanov I. Kuhn H. Heydeck D. Structural and functional biology of arachidonic acid 15-lipoxygenase-1 (ALOX15).Gene. 2015; 573: 1-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 10.Ivanov I. Heydeck D. Hofheinz K. Roffeis J. O'Donnell V.B. Kuhn H. Walther M. Molecular enzymology of lipoxygenases.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2010; 503: 161-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Gpx4 is the only glutathione peroxidase isoform capable of reducing complex hydroperoxy lipids (7.Brigelius-Flohé R. Maiorino M. Glutathione peroxidases.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2013; 1830: 3289-3303Crossref PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar), eliminating these peroxides as sources of free radical-induced secondary reactions. Thus, ALOX15 and GPX4 are functional counter players in metabolism of hydroperoxy lipids (11.Kühn H. Borchert A. Regulation of enzymatic lipid peroxidation: the interplay of peroxidizing and peroxide reducing enzymes.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 154-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Lipoxygenases (LOX) 2The abbreviations used are:LOX, lipoxygenase; qRT, quantitative real-time; PUFA, polyenoic fatty acid; HETE, hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid; RP, reverse phase. are expressed in the testis of various mammals (12.Grossman S.

Johnson E.N. Zhao L. Lipoxygenase genes and their targeted disruption.Prostaglandins Other Lipid. Mediat. 2002; 68: 303-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). However, more detailed studies on the reproduction of Alox15−/− mice indicated that breeding of these animals was hampered since male Alox15−/− mice turned out to be subfertile (16.Moore K. Lovercamp K. Feng D. Antelman J. Sutovsky M. Manandhar G. van Leyen K. Safranski T. Sutovsky P. Altered epididymal sperm maturation and cytoplasmic droplet migration in subfertile male Alox15 mice.Cell Tissue Res. 2010; 340: 569-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Although the molecular basis for this subfertility has not been explored in detail, it was suggested that epididymal sperm maturation, in particular the proximal-distal migration of the cytoplasmic droplet, which contains remnants of the spermatogenic cytoplasma as well as Alox15 (17.Fischer K.A. Van Leyen K. Lovercamp K.W. Manandhar G. Sutovsky M. Feng D. Safranski T. Sutovsky P. 15-Lipoxygenase is a component of the mammalian sperm cytoplasmic droplet.Reproduction. 2005; 130: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), was impaired in Alox15-deficient sperm (16.Moore K. Lovercamp K. Feng D. Antelman J. Sutovsky M. Manandhar G. van Leyen K. Safranski T. Sutovsky P. Altered epididymal sperm maturation and cytoplasmic droplet migration in subfertile male Alox15 mice.Cell Tissue Res. 2010; 340: 569-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Homozygous Gpx4-deficient animals die in utero before mouse embryonic day 7.5 (18.Imai H. Hirao F. Sakamoto T. Sekine K. Mizukura Y. Saito M. Kitamoto T. Hayasaka M. Hanaoka K. Nakagawa Y.

Med. 2003; 34: 496-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Similarly, homozygous mice expressing catalytically inactive Gpx4 variants (Sec46Ala/Ser mutant) do not survive the seventh day of embryogenesis, and systemic Alox15 deficiency did not rescue the lethal phenotype (20.Brütsch S.H. Wang C.C. Li L. Stender H. Neziroglu N. Richter C. Kuhn H. Borchert A. Expression of inactive glutathione peroxidase 4 leads to embryonic lethality, and inactivation of the Alox15 gene does not rescue such knock-in mice.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2015; 22: 281-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These data suggest that Gpx4 is essential for normal embryogenesis, but its detailed function remains a matter of discussion. Conditional neuron-specific knock-out of Gpx4 expression in adult mice induces neurodegeneration suggesting that embryonic lethality of Gpx4 deficiency might be related to defective brain development (22.Seiler A. Schneider M. Förster H. Roth S. Wirth E.K. Culmsee C. Plesnila N. Kremmer E. Rådmark O. Wurst W. Bornkamm G.W. Schweizer U. Conrad M.

This conclusion was consistent with the previous observation indicating that expression silencing of Gpx4 during in vitro mouse embryogenesis induces developmental defects in the central nervous system (23.Borchert A. Wang C.C. Ufer C. Schiebel H. Savaskan N.E. Kuhn H. The role of phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase isoforms in murine embryogenesis.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19655-19664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). More recent studies employing conditional knock-out mice, in which expression of the enzyme was selectively inactivated in erythroid precursors, suggest a role of Gpx4 during erythropoiesis (24.Canli Ö. Alanku Y.B. Grootjans S. Vegi N. Hültner L. Hoppe P.S. Schroeder T. Vandenabeele P. Bornkamm G.W. Greten F.R. Glutathione peroxidase 4 prevents necroptosis in mouse erythroid precursors.Blood. 2016; 127: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). These data indicate that embryonic lethality of Gpx4 deficiency in mice might not only be related to developmental defects of the central nervous system. In humans GPX4 expression is reversibly induced by hepatitis C virus to control lipid peroxidation and to increase virion infectivity (25.Brault C. Lévy P. Duponchel S. Michelet M. Sallé A. Pécheur E.I. Plissonnier M.L. Parent R. Véricel E. Ivanov A.V. Demir M. Steffen H.M. Odenthal M. Zoulim F. Bartosch B. Glutathione peroxidase 4 is reversibly induced by HCV to control lipid peroxidation and to increase virion infectivity.Gut. 2016; 65: 144-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Naturally occurring truncation mutants (splicing defects, premature stop codon) in the human GPX4 gene cause a rare hereditary neonatally lethal disorder called Sedaghatian spondylometaphyseal dysplasia (26.Smith A.C.

Patients suffering from this disease are characterized by severe metaphyseal chondrodysplasia with limb shortening, cardiac conduction defects, and central nervous system abnormalities (26.Smith A.C.

In this organ the Gpx4 protein exhibits a moonlighting character as it functions as glutathione peroxidase but also as a structural protein involved in the formation of the sperm specific mitochondrial capsule (31.Roveri A. Ursini F. Flohé L. Maiorino M. PHGPx and spermatogenesis.Biofactors. 2001; 14: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).

Chem. 2009; 284: 32522-32532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Their testes display a decreased number of sperm, and isolated epididymal sperm were unable to fertilize oocytes in vitro. The sperm exhibited reduced forward motility and were characterized by structural abnormalities (32.Imai H. Hakkaku N. Iwamoto R. Suzuki J. Suzuki T. Tajima Y. Konishi K. Minami S. Ichinose S.

In this model system expression of the Gpx4 protein was completely blocked, and thus, it was impossible to conclude whether the lack of catalytic activity or the absence of Gpx4 as the structural protein was the major reason for the deleterious effects. To address this question, two different strains of knock-in mice were recently created by independent research groups, which express a catalytically inactive Gpx4 variant (Sec46Ala (20.Brütsch S.H. Wang C.C. Li L. Stender H. Neziroglu N. Richter C. Kuhn H. Borchert A.

Ursini F. Friedmann Angeli J.P. Conrad M. Expression of a Catalytically inactive mutant form of glutathione peroxidase 4 (Gpx4) confers a dominant-negative effect in male fertility.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 14668-14678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar)), and male heterozygous allele carriers of the Sec46Ser animals were shown to be subfertile (21.Ingold I. Aichler M. Yefremova E. Roveri A. Buday K. Doll S. Tasdemir A. Hoffard N. Wurst W. Walch A. Ursini F. Friedmann Angeli J.P. Conrad M.

Chem. 2015; 290: 14668-14678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Fertility of Sec46Ala males has not been tested, but similar problems were expected. The major reasons why we preferred the Sec-to-Ala strategy are the redox properties of the introduced amino acid. Because of its aliphatic OH group, there is the principle possibility that the Ser site chain might be oxidized by peroxide substrates to an aldehyde or even to a carboxylic acid. In contrast, the Ala side chain is redox-silent and may not be oxidized by peroxides. Employing Sec46Ala-Gpx4+/− knock-in mice (20.Brütsch S.H. Wang C.C. Li L. Stender H. Neziroglu N. Richter C. Kuhn H. Borchert A. Expression of inactive glutathione peroxidase 4 leads to embryonic lethality, and inactivation of the Alox15 gene does not rescue such knock-in mice.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2015; 22: 281-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), we here confirmed subfertility of male mice, which are deficient in catalytically active Gpx4. Moreover, we found that systemic expression silencing of Alox15 rescued the subfertility of Sec46Ala-Gpx4+/− mice and reimproved the motility of their sperm. These changes were paralleled by an enhanced respiratory capacity, suggesting an up-regulated energy metabolism of these sperm. Gpx4 is high level-expressed in mammalian sperm (27.Ursini F. Heim S. Kiess M. Maiorino M. Roveri A. Wissing J. Flohé L.

PHGPx and spermatogenesis.Biofactors. 2001; 14: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), but little is known on the expression of LOX-isoforms in the male reproductive system (12.Grossman S. Shahin I. Sredni B. Rat testis lipoxygenase-like enzyme: characterization of products from linoleic acid.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 572: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). More recent data indicated expression of Alox15 in the plasmatic droplet and suggested a role of this enzyme in sperm maturation (17.Fischer K.A. Van Leyen K. Lovercamp K.W. Manandhar G. Sutovsky M. Feng D. Safranski T. Sutovsky P. 15-Lipoxygenase is a component of the mammalian sperm cytoplasmic droplet.Reproduction. 2005; 130: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To confirm expression of both enzymes in the male reproductive system and to quantify their relative expression levels, we first carried out qRT-PCR with sperm RNA extracts prepared from the epididymal cauda and compared the relative copy numbers of their mRNAs in relation to somatic GAPDH mRNA (Table 1). As expected, mRNAs encoding for the cytosolic, the mitochondrial, and the nuclear Gpx4 isoforms were present in large abundance. In contrast, Alox15 mRNA was present in much lower quantities. Next, we purified epididymal caput sperm by Percoll gradient centrifugation and quantified Alox15 mRNA in these cells. Here we obtained 10.4 ± 0.8 copies of Alox15 mRNA per 103 copies of somatic GAPDH and 71 ± 5.1 copies of Alox15 mRNA per 103 copies of sperm-specific GAPDH. Because possible functional alterations of sperm might also be related Alox15 deficiency in other cells of the male reproductive system, we next explored Alox15 expression in testis and epididymal caput. qRT-PCR of testis indicated 3.3 ± 0.3 copies of Alox15 mRNA per 103 copies of somatic GAPDH. qRT-PCR of RNA extracts from the epididymal caput revealed 6.6 ± 1.1 copies of Alox15 mRNA per copies of 103 copies of somatic GAPDH. These data indicate the presence of Alox15 mRNA in both organs, but they also suggest that Alox15, in contrast to Gpx4, is not expressed at high levels. Thus, Alox15 constitutes a low copy gene in the cells of the male reproductive organs. Furthermore, we carried out immunoblotting of protein extracts prepared from purified sperm, testis, and epididymal caput but did not obtain specific Alox15 signals in the appropriate molecular weight range. Finally, we performed immunohistochemistry with our purified sperm preparation employing a homemade anti-Alox15 antibody. Evaluating a large number (>30) of slides, we observed specific Alox15 staining in a few sperm. In these Alox15-positive cells the signal was localized in a microscopic structure, which could be the plasma droplet. However, the majority of the cells were devoid of a specific Alox15 signal. Taken together, these data indicate that Alox15 mRNA is expressed at low levels in testis and epididymis but that the enzyme is only present at low quantities in mature sperm.TABLE 1Expression of Gpx4 and Alox15 mRNA in cauda sperm of wild-type micemRNA copy numbers/1000 GAPDH mRNA copiesmGpx4cGpx4nGpx4Alox15Mean ± S.D.4022 ± 8747772 ± 1528775 ± 82.0 ± 0.4 Open table in a new tab It has been reported before that mice that heterozygously express a catalytically inactive variant of Gpx4 (Sec46Ser-Gpx4+/− knock-in mice) are subfertile (21.Ingold I. Aichler M. Yefremova E. Roveri A. Buday K. Doll S. Tasdemir A. Hoffard N. Wurst W. Walch A. Ursini F. Friedmann Angeli J.P. Conrad M. Expression of a Catalytically inactive mutant form of glutathione peroxidase 4 (Gpx4) confers a dominant-negative effect in male fertility.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 14668-14678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and here we confirmed these data using a similar in vivo knock-in mouse model (20.Brütsch S.H. Wang C.C. Li L. Stender H. Neziroglu N. Richter C. Kuhn H. Borchert A. Expression of inactive glutathione peroxidase 4 leads to embryonic lethality, and inactivation of the Alox15 gene does not rescue such knock-in mice.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2015; 22: 281-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). When we intercrossed Sec46Ala-Gpx4+/− mice, we observed significantly lower litter sizes when compared with intercrossing wild-type controls. When we crossed male Sec46Ala-Gpx4+/− knock-in mice with wild-type females, we observed similar alterations (Fig. 1A). In contrast, similar litter sizes were found when female Sec46Ala-Gpx4+/− knock-in mice were crossed with male wild-type individuals. These data confirm that heterozygous deficiency of catalytically active Gpx4 impairs male fertility. Next we compared the motility characteristics of sperm extracted from the epididymal cauda of Sec46Ala-GPx4+/− and wild-type mice. For this purpose sperm were classified in motile and immotile sperm, and the motile sperm were further subclassified in sperm with total (any signs of movement) and progressive (rapid and slow forward movement, circular movement) as well as rapid forward movement. The shares of sperm with total, progressive, and rapid motility were significantly lower in Sec46Ala-Gpx4+/− mice when compared with wild-type animals (Fig. 1B). Sperm are haploid cells that undergo genome reduction during meiosis. To explore whether sperm carrying the wild-type allele (functional Gpx4) or the mutant allele (dysfunctional Gpx4) are similarly treated during spermatogenesis, we genotyped the sperm isolated from the epididymal cauda of Sec46Ala-Gpx4+/− mice. As shown in Fig. 1C, we found a 1:1 ratio of the Sec46Ala-Gpx4+/− and the Sec46Ala-Gpx4−/− alleles. These data indicate that sperm carrying the inactive mutant allele are not removed during spermatogenesis. To explore the basis for the impaired motility of Gpx4-deficient sperm, we quantified the structural alterations employing a microscopic scoring system that classifies all sperm in three categories: Grade 1 sperm (normal shape), no midpiece granulation and smooth plasma membranes; Grade 2 (minor alterations), moderate midpiece granulation and rough plasma membranes; Grade 3, severe midpiece granulation and discontinued plasma membrane. When we determined the relative share of grade 1 sperm (normal appearance) in wild-type controls, we found that >90% of the sperm exhibited a “normal” morphological phenotype (Fig. 2Aa). In contrast, in Sec46Ala-Gpx4+/− mice we did not detect grade 1 sperm at all. In fact, it was possible to conclude the genotype of the animals simply by looking at the morphological characteristics of the sperm. Grade 2 (Fig. 2Ab) and grade 3 (Fig. 2Ac) sperm were virtually absent in wild-type controls but together amounted to >90% in Sec46Ala-Gpx4+/− mice. Next, we explored the midpiece alterations by transmission electron microscopy (Fig. 2B). Here we found that the mitochondria of wild-type sperm are present as condensed organelles, which are well ordered within the mitochondrial capsule (Fig. 2Ba). In contrast, in Sec46Ala-Gpx4+/− sperm the mitochondria are swollen and contain intramitochondrial vacuoles, and the mitochondrial capsule was not well ordered (Fig. 2Bb). Similar alterations have been described for the sperm of spermatocyte-specific Gpx4-knock-out mice (32.Imai H. Hakkaku N. Iwamoto R. Suzuki J. Suzuki T. Tajima Y. Konishi K. Minami S. Ichinose S.

Previous reports have suggested that different Gpx4 isoforms (nuclear, mitochondrial, cytoplasmic) are expressed in different parts of sperm (33.Pfeifer H. Conrad M. Roethlein D. Kyriakopoulos A.

To compare the subcellular distribution of Gpx4 in wild-type and Sec46Ala-Gpx4+/− mice, we carried out immunogold electron microscopy employing a monoclonal anti-Gpx4 antibody, which does not differentiate between the different isoforms (34.Borchert A.

Thus, GFB and control bread (CB) were fermented with faecal microbiota in pH-controlled batch cultures. The effects on the major groups of microbiota were monitored over 48 h incubations by fluorescence in situ hybridisation. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Furthermore, the death kinetics of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Salmonella Typhimurium in a saline solution supplemented with GFB or CB were also assessed. The experiments in saline solution pinpointed that GFB prolonged the survival of L. acidophilus and exerted an antibacterial effect towards S. aureus and S. Typhimurium. Moreover, GFB modulated the intestinal microbiota in vitro, promoting changes in lactobacilli and bifidobacteria members in coeliac subjects. A final multivariate approach combining both viable counts and metabolites suggested that GFB could beneficially modulate the coeliac gut microbiome; however, human studies are needed to prove its efficacy."

Fibromodulin has a key role in connective tissues, binding collagen through two identified binding sites in its leucine-rich repeat domain and regulating collagen fibril formation in vitro and in vivo. Some nine tyrosine residues in the fibromodulin N-terminal domain are O-sulfated, a posttranslational modification often involved in protein interactions. The N-terminal domain mimics heparin, binding proteins with clustered basic amino acid residues. Because heparin affects collagen fibril formation, we investigated whether tyrosine sulfate is involved in fibromodulin interactions with collagen. Using full-length fibromodulin and its N-terminal tyrosine-sulfated domain purified from tissue, as well as recombinant fibromodulin fragments, we found that the N-terminal domain binds collagen. The tyrosine-sulfated domain and the leucine-rich repeat domain both bound to three specific sites along the collagen type I molecule, at the N terminus and at 100 and 220 nm from the N terminus. The N-terminal domain shortened the collagen fibril formation lag phase and tyrosine sulfation was required for this effect. The isolated leucine-rich repeat domain inhibited the fibril formation rate, and full-length fibromodulin showed a combination of these effects. The fibrils formed in the presence of fibromodulin or its fragments showed more organized structure. Fibromodulin and its tyrosine sulfate domain remained bound on the formed fiber.

Schaefer L. Proteoglycan form and function: a comprehensive nomenclature of proteoglycans.Matrix Biol. 2015; 42: 11-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). In these proteins, the central leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain comprises ∼80% of the protein and is composed of 10–12 repeats with leucine residues at conserved locations (2.Matsushima N.

Aggravated phenotypes are seen in compound knock-out mice, where e.g. the fibromodulin/lumican double knock-out mice shows weak tendons and development of early osteoarthritis, probably due to destabilization of the joints (11.Ezura Y.

Osteoadherin also contains a C-terminal extension carrying up to two additional tyrosine sulfates (13.Önnerfjord P. Heathfield T.F. Heinegård D.

Chem. 2004; 279: 26-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Tyrosine sulfation is believed to enhance protein interactions, and is critical, e.g. for P-selectin binding to P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 in leukocyte extravasation (17.Moore K.L. The biology and enzymology of protein tyrosine O-sulfation.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24243-24246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). We have previously found that the tyrosine-sulfated N-terminal domain of fibromodulin mimics heparin in interacting with protein domains containing clusters of basic amino acids (18.Tillgren V.

Heparin and other oversulfated glycosaminoglycans have been shown to bind to different types of collagens (19.San Antonio J.D. Karnovsky M.J. Gay S. Sanderson R.D. Lander A.D. Interactions of syndecan-1 and heparin with human collagens.Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and influence collagen fibril formation in vitro (20.Öbrink B.

This implies that the tyrosine sulfate domain of fibromodulin could interact with collagen. We now show that this domain contributes a third collagen binding site to fibromodulin, that it affects collagen fibril assembly, and that this is dependent on sulfated tyrosine residues. In the present study, we have used a number of different fibromodulin protein variants, purified from tissue or expressed as recombinant proteins. The different proteins are shown schematically in Fig. 1A, and a Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gel with the proteins is shown in Fig. 1B. The names of these proteins or protein fragments reflect: 1) the origin of the protein (tissue purified or recombinant), 2) the included residue numbers, and 3) the absence of posttranslational modification when produced in Escherichia coli. Thus, full-length fibromodulin purified from tracheal cartilage is referred to as tFM_19–376 (starting at residue 19 because the signal peptide is cleaved off, and extending to the C terminus, i.e. residue 376), and rFM_19–376 is the corresponding recombinant protein produced in 293-EBNA cells. The recombinant protein rFM_64–376 is a truncated fibromodulin omitting the tyrosine sulfate domain and starting at amino acid Ala64, a previously identified matrix metalloproteinase 13 cleavage site in fibromodulin (22.Heathfield T.F. Önnerfjord P. Dahlberg L. Heinegård D. Cleavage of fibromodulin in cartilage explants involves removal of the N-terminal tyrosine sulfate-rich region by proteolysis at a site that is sensitive to matrix metalloproteinase-13.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6286-6295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The tFM_19–98 protein is the isolated tyrosine-sulfated N-terminal fragment of tFM_19–376, whereas its bacterially expressed equivalent was named rFM_19–98_0S to emphasize its lack of post-translational modification. Finally, tFM_33–74 is a tryptic fragment of tFM_19–98 containing the central part of the N-terminal extension with tyrosine sulfate residues. To determine whether the tyrosine-sulfated N-terminal extension of fibromodulin was involved in collagen interaction, acid-extracted collagen type I from mouse tail tendon was coated onto a plastic surface and the fibromodulin variants tFM_19–376, tFM_19–98, rFM_19–376, or rFM_64–376 were allowed to interact. All the fibromodulin variants showed binding to collagen type I, including the tFM_19–98 fragment (Fig. 1C). To verify and characterize the interaction with collagen type I, tFM_19–376, rFM_19–376, or rFM_64–376 were injected over pepsin-extracted collagen type I immobilized onto a BIAcore C1 surface plasmon resonance chip. The full-length tFM_19–376 (Fig. 1D) and rFM_19–376 (Fig. 1E) as well as the N terminally truncated rFM_64–376 (Fig. 1F) fibromodulin showed binding to the immobilized collagen molecules, confirming the solid phase results. The interactions showed distinct differences in both the association and dissociation phases. In particular the dissociation of full-length tFM_19–376 was much slower than that of truncated rFM_64–376, verifying contributions from both the N-terminal site and the LRR-domain sites in binding to the collagen molecule. This also demonstrates that binding via the N-terminal tyrosine sulfate-rich domain contributes to the overall affinity to collagen (Fig. 1, D and F). As the rFM_64–376 protein is expressed without keratan sulfate chains and can be purified under mild conditions, we compared rFM_19–376, expressed in the same system as the rFM_64–376, to the bovine cartilage derived tFM_19–376 carrying keratan sulfate (14.Antonsson P. Heinegård D. Oldberg Å. Posttranslational modifications of fibromodulin.J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16859-16861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The two full-length variants showed similar binding to collagen type I (Fig. 1, D and E). As there are several binding sites, both for fibromodulin on the collagen molecule and for collagen on fibromodulin, it was not possible to calculate affinities. The tyrosine-sulfated N-terminal tFM_19–98 protein gave no detectable response in the BIAcore assay, perhaps reflecting charge repulsion from the carboxymethylated surface (data not shown). Fibrillogenesis of pepsin-extracted collagen in the presence of the tFM_19–98 fragment resulted in a shortened lag phase compared with fibrillogenesis of collagen alone (Fig. 2, A and B) and the effect on lag-phase was dose dependent (Fig. 5, A and C). The tFM_19–98 fragment had a very minor effect on the rate of turbidity increase (Hill slope), whereas the plateau level was unchanged (Fig. 2B). In contrast, adding the rFM_64–376 fragment to the collagen fibrillogenesis assay resulted in a slightly prolonged lag phase, along with a minor decrease in the rate of turbidity increase and a slightly delayed t50 (Fig. 2, A and B). As previously observed (5.Hedbom E. Heinegård D. Interaction of a 59-kDa connective tissue matrix protein with collagen I and collagen II.J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6898-6905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), tissue extracted full-length fibromodulin (tFM_19–376) slowed down the turbidity increase and lowered the plateau level in the fibrillogenesis assays, as did recombinant full-length rFM_19–376 (Fig. 2, A and B). Notably, both full-length fibromodulin proteins consistently shortened the lag phase, to the same extent as tFM_19–98 or more (Fig. 2, A and B). This shortening of the lag phase was reproducibly observed with several batches of full-length fibromodulin purified from different types of cartilage tissue (data not shown).FIGURE 5.Tyrosine sulfation is critical for the tFM_19–98 fragment effects on collagen fibril formation.

There was an approximately equal amount of the rFM_64–376 in the supernatant and pellet, whereas almost all tFM_19–376 and most tFM_19–98 was detected in the pellet (Fig. 2C). The presence of tFM_19–376, tFM_19–98, and rFM_64–376 on fibers of collagen type I after 24 h of incubation was verified by negative staining EM, using a gold-labeled fibromodulin-specific antibody (Fig. 2D). No staining was seen in the absence of fibromodulin (not shown). To verify that the tyrosine-sulfated fibromodulin domain had an effect also on collagen with retained telopeptides, we performed a fibril formation assay using acid-extracted tail tendon collagen from 3-week-old mice. Due to the rapid polymerization of this collagen, the assay was performed at lower temperature (28 °C) and with lower concentrations of collagen and tFM_19–98. As shown in Fig. 2, E and F, tFM_19–98 shortened the polymerization lag phase without an effect on the plateau level or slope of the turbidity curve. Three fibromodulin binding sites along the collagen molecule were identified using gold-labeled antibody detection and negative staining EM (Fig. 3A). In a few cases, binding was observed to both termini of pepsin-treated collagen molecules (Fig. 3A). Full-length fibromodulin (tFM_19–376), the tyrosine sulfate-rich domain (tFM_19–98), and the LRR domain (rFM_64–376) showed similar binding patterns on pro-collagen type I, with one site at the N-terminal of the collagen triple helical part and additional sites at distances of 100 and 220 nm from the N-terminal, respectively (Fig. 3B, left). In parallel experiments with pepsin-treated collagen type I, the same binding sites were found (Fig. 3B, right). Neither the pepsin-extracted collagen, nor the procollagen, showed any reactivity to the anti-fibromodulin antiserum (not shown). The resolution of the electron microscopy method, when employing a gold-tagged antibody to detect binding, is 20 ± 5 nm, corresponding to about 70 amino acids along the triple helix, which does not allow conclusions on whether binding is to identical sites on the collagen molecule for all three fibromodulin variants. We did, however, find simultaneous binding of two individual fibromodulin molecules to separate binding sites on the same collagen molecule (Fig. 3A). An informative observation from EM studies was that the full-length fibromodulin could bind two collagen molecules at the same time (Fig. 3C), showing that the two binding sites in the LRR and the tyrosine sulfate domain of fibromodulin can concomitantly bind different collagen molecules, which could be important in networking and assembly. The constructs representing the isolated N-terminal or LRR domains did not mediate such cross-linking (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2D, the fibromodulin constructs bound to the formed fibers, predominantly at the borders between overlap and gap regions. This is in agreement with the mapping of collagen binding sites (Fig. 3B) on the collagen fibril D-period, as illustrated in Fig. 3D. To study the effects of the N-terminal and LRR domains of fibromodulin on collagen fibril formation, samples were collected from a fibrillogenesis experiment and visualized by negative staining electron microscopy. At time point 0 the collagen monomers were aggregated in the presence of all of the fibromodulin variants, resulting in engagement of 7–11 collagen chains (11–16 nm) compared with collagen alone, where no such aggregates could be detected (Table 1 and Fig. 4A, 0h). After 3 h incubation at 37 °C, all samples contained a second population of thicker fibers, in addition to the fibril population of 10–16 nm in diameter. In the presence of tFM_19–98 or rFM_64–376, this second population of fibrils was thicker with more variable diameter compared with the sample in the presence of full-length fibromodulin (tFM_19–376) or PBS. The latter two showed more uniform thinner diameter fibrils, but with differences in fibril maturation. As judged from the fibrillar cross-striation, samples containing tFM_19–376, tFM_19–98, or rFM_64–376 already showed a highly organized structure compared with the control reaction (Table 1 and Fig. 4A, 3h). In samples taken after 24 h of incubation at 37 °C, no fibrils of the 10–16-nm populations remained (Table 1). In all samples, the fibrils present had wider diameters and showed mature cross-striation (Table 1 and Fig. 4A, 24h). Measurement of collagen, precipitated by centrifugation (20,800 × g for 30 min) after 24 h of fibril formation, was in general agreement with this, with a minor decrease in hydroxyproline in the pellet of the rFM_64–376 samples, and no differences seen in the tFM_19–376 or tFM_19–98 samples (Fig. 4B).TABLE 1Fibromodulin effects on collagen fibril formationTimePBStFM_19–98rFM_64–376tFM_19–3760 hCross-striation0%0%0%0%Diameter16 (±5 nm)14 (±3 nm)11 (±3 nm)3 hCross-striation27%68%79%82%Diameter10 (±3 nm)16 (±5 nm)14 (±3 nm)10 (±3 nm)42 (±15 nm)75 (±50 nm)63 (±40 nm)39 (±10 nm)24 hCross-striation83%77%96%94%Diameter91 (±30 nm)82 (±20 nm)109 (±30 nm)71 (±10 nm) Open table in a new tab To investigate the role of sulfated tyrosine residues in collagen fibril formation, a recombinant fragment was produced in E. coli (rFM_19–98_0S). This fragment corresponds exactly to the tFM_19–98 amino acid sequence, but contains no post-translational modifications, i.e. sulfation and cysteine disulfide bridge formation. Unlike the sulfated fragment from tissue-extracted protein, rFM_19–98_0S showed no binding to basic domains (18.Tillgren V. Önnerfjord P. Haglund L. Heinegård D. The tyrosine sulfate-rich domains of the LRR proteins fibromodulin and osteoadherin bind motifs of basic clusters in a variety of heparin-binding proteins, including bioactive factors.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 28543-28553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), even though it contains a number of acidic amino acids contributing to a negative charge at neutral pH. In solid phase assays, the purified rFM_19–98_0S fragment showed binding to collagen (data not shown), but adding the fragment in a collagen fibrillogenesis assay only resulted in a minor shortening of the fibril formation lag phase with no effects on the rate of fibrillogenesis or plateau turbidity (Fig. 5, B and C). In contrast, the corresponding fragment from tissue-derived fibromodulin had a significant and dose-dependent effect on both the lag phase and t50 (Fig. 5, A and C), confirming the involvement of post-translational modifications. To verify that the effects on collagen fibril formation were dependent on sulfated tyrosine residues and not the cysteine-loop structure, a shorter fragment of the tyrosine-rich region, lacking the cysteine-loop, was generated by trypsin digestion of tFM_19–98 as described (18.Tillgren V. Önnerfjord P. Haglund L. Heinegård D. The tyrosine sulfate-rich domains of the LRR proteins fibromodulin and osteoadherin bind motifs of basic clusters in a variety of heparin-binding proteins, including bioactive factors.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 28543-28553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Addition of this tFM_33–74 fragment, in the same molar range as the tFM_19–98 fragment, to the in vitro collagen fibril formation assay, shortened the lag phase and accelerated the fibrillogenesis process in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5, D and E). This clearly shows that the sulfated tyrosine residues are responsible for the effect on collagen fibril formation. In bovine fibromodulin, nine of the N-terminal tyrosine residues are O-sulfated to varying degrees (13.Önnerfjord P. Heathfield T.F. Heinegård D. Identification of tyrosine sulfation in extracellular leucine-rich repeat proteins using mass spectrometry.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Thus, in anion exchange chromatography, the N-terminal endoproteinase LysC fragment of tFM_19–376 elutes in six sharp peaks that contain identical protein cores but differ in the distribution and amount of O-sulfate (18.Tillgren V. Önnerfjord P. Haglund L. Heinegård D. The tyrosine sulfate-rich domains of the LRR proteins fibromodulin and osteoadherin bind motifs of basic clusters in a variety of heparin-binding proteins, including bioactive factors.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 28543-28553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The sulfation variant fragments can either be pooled (as the tFM_19–98 preparation) or kept separated (peak 1–6) (Fig. 6A, inset). These different fractions were previously shown to have different affinity for heparin binding domains (18.Tillgren V. Önnerfjord P. Haglund L. Heinegård D. The tyrosine sulfate-rich domains of the LRR proteins fibromodulin and osteoadherin bind motifs of basic clusters in a variety of heparin-binding proteins, including bioactive factors.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 28543-28553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To investigate if variations in tyrosine sulfation also affected the assembly of collagen monomers, the different peaks were added at equimolar concentration in the fibrillogenesis assay. Because O-sulfation changes the UV absorbance of the tyrosine residues, the concentration of the tFM_19–98 fragment or individual peaks was assayed by quantitative mass spectrometry. All individual peak fractions shortened the fibril formation lag phase, and all except the least charged fraction (peak 1) increased the final plateau level (Fig. 6, A and B). Combining the 6 different peak fractions in the same relative volume proportions as in the tFM_19–98 pool also gave strong influence on the lag phase (data not shown). No significant effects were seen on the rate of turbidity increase. Taken together, this indicates that the degree of sulfation, rather than a specific sulfation pattern, is a critical parameter regarding the influence on the fibril formation. The small leucine-rich proteins, e.g. fibromodulin, decorin, asporin and lumican, are known to influence the fibril formation of collagens and in some of the cases the functional interaction sites have been identified (23.Kalamajski S.

Studies on animal models show that antioxidants may lower Cpt-induced ototoxicity. The aim of this study is to evaluate the ototoxic effects of two different protocols of Cpt administration in a Sprague-Dawley rat model, and to test in the same model the synergic protective effects of a solution of coenzyme Q10 terclatrate and Acuval 400®, a multivitamin supplement containing antioxidant agents and minerals (Acu-Qter). The Cpt was administered intraperitoneally in a single dose (14 mg/kg) or in three daily doses (4.6 mg/kg/day) to rats orally treated or untreated with Acu-Qter for 5 days. The auditory function was assessed by measuring auditory brainstem responses from 2 to 32 kHz at day 0 and 5 days after treatment. Similar hearing threshold and body weight alterations were observed in both Cpt administration protocols, but mortality reduced to zero when Cpt was administered in three daily doses. The Acu-Qter treatment was able to prevent and completely neutralize ototoxicity in rats treated with three daily Cpt doses, supporting the synergic protective effects of coenzyme Q terclatrate and Acuval 400® against Cpt-induced oxidative stress. The administration protocol involving three Cpt doses is more similar to common human chemotherapy protocols, therefore it appears more useful for long-term preclinical studies on ototoxicity prevention."

Our institution has switched relapse treatment strategy to improve survival. We reviewed records of first relapse/refractory childhood ALL between 1996 and 2012. Based on length of first remission, relapse site and immunophenotype, patients were classified into two groups: standard-risk relapse (SRR) and high-risk relapse and refractory (HRRR). Before 2007, all patients were uniformly treated with the same induction as at presentation, followed by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Since 2007, treatment was given according to risk of failure: SRR were mostly treated with chemotherapy; HRRR patients underwent HSCT after intensive chemotherapy, aiming reduction of pre-transplant disease burden. Sixty-four patients were included. Thirty (47%) were SRR and 34 (53%) HRRR, including 11 with refractory ALL. Five-years overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) were similar for SRR, but were significantly higher with new risk-based strategy for HRRR: 56% versus 17% (P = 0.03) for OS, and 56% vs 11% for EFS (P = 0.008), respectively. In multivariate analysis, treatment strategy was significantly associated with survival. In conclusion, change for a risk-based strategy in our institution increased survival of high-risk patients to levels similar of those of standard-risk patients."

https://openalex.org/W2519403100,"'Microtubule-associated protein tau' (MAPT), 'granulin' (GRN) and 'chromosome 9 open reading frame72' (C9ORF72) gene mutations are the major known genetic causes of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Recent studies suggest that mutations in these genes may also be associated with other forms of dementia. Therefore we investigated whether MAPT, GRN and C9ORF72 gene mutations are major contributors to dementia in a random, unselected Turkish cohort of dementia patients. A combination of whole-exome sequencing, Sanger sequencing and fragment analysis/Southern blot was performed in order to identify pathogenic mutations and novel variants in these genes as well as other FTD-related genes such as the 'charged multivesicular body protein 2B' (CHMP2B), the 'FUS RNA binding protein' (FUS), the 'TAR DNA binding protein' (TARDBP), the 'sequestosome1' (SQSTM1), and the 'valosin containing protein' (VCP). We determined one pathogenic MAPT mutation (c.1906C>T, p.P636L) and one novel missense variant (c.38A>G, p.D13G). In GRN we identified a probably pathogenic TGAG deletion in the splice donor site of exon 6. Three patients were found to carry the GGGGCC expansions in the non-coding region of the C9ORF72 gene. In summary, a complete screening for mutations in MAPT, GRN and C9ORF72 genes revealed a frequency of 5.4% of pathogenic mutations in a random cohort of 93 Turkish index patients with dementia."
https://openalex.org/W2518977812,"Background Tenofovir (TDF) can cause kidney injury through tubular dysfunction, with or without drop of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Whether mild eGFR reductions during treatment should be considered a reason for prompt TDF discontinuation, however, remains unclear. Methods Patients with normal pre-TDF eGFR levels, who had developed mild renal impairment (i.e., two consecutive eGFR results between 89–60 ml/min) on TDF, were observed until onset of chronic kidney disease (CKD), defined as two eGFR<60 ml/min 3 to 6 months apart. Multivariable Poisson regression analysis was used to investigate whether outcome was associated with current and cumulative use of TDF (modeled as time-varying covariates). Results 2023 (29%) out of 6984 patients developed mild renal impairment on TDF. Among them, 191 progressed to CKD. The incidence of CKD did not significantly differ during TDF treatment (2.6 per 100 PYFU; 95%CI 2.2–3.2) or after its discontinuation (2.2 per 100 PYFU; 95%CI 1.8–2.6). However, the rate of CKD was significantly higher among patients continuing with TDF treatment compared to those who had discontinued it within 6 months of occurrence of mild renal impairment (aIRR 4, 95%CI 2.4–6.8). In contrast, among patients who had maintained TDF >6 months despite mild renal impairment, current TDF use was not associated with a significantly higher rate of CKD. Other significant predictors of CKD were older age, intravenous drug use, diabetes, hypertension, lower pre-TDF eGFR, higher eGFR drop since TDF introduction and longer exposure to TDF. Conclusions Prompt discontinuation of TDF among patients developing mild renal impairment may prevent further progression of renal damage."
https://openalex.org/W2519096388,"ADP-ribosylation is a post-translational modification that can alter the physical and chemical properties of target proteins and that controls many important cellular processes. Macrodomains are evolutionarily conserved structural domains that bind ADP-ribose derivatives and are found in proteins with diverse cellular functions. Some proteins from the macrodomain family can hydrolyze ADP-ribosylated substrates and therefore reverse this post-translational modification. Bacteria and Streptomyces, in particular, are known to utilize protein ADP-ribosylation, yet very little is known about their enzymes that synthesize and remove this modification. We have determined the crystal structure and characterized, both biochemically and functionally, the macrodomain protein SCO6735 from Streptomyces coelicolor This protein is a member of an uncharacterized subfamily of macrodomain proteins. Its crystal structure revealed a highly conserved macrodomain fold. We showed that SCO6735 possesses the ability to hydrolyze PARP-dependent protein ADP-ribosylation. Furthermore, we showed that expression of this protein is induced upon DNA damage and that deletion of this protein in S. coelicolor increases antibiotic production. Our results provide the first insights into the molecular basis of its action and impact on Streptomyces metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2519879166,"The use of adipose-derived stem cells (ADSC) in regenerative medicine is rising due to their plasticity, capacity of differentiation and paracrine and trophic effects. Despite the large number of cells obtained from adipose tissue, it is usually not enough for therapeutic purposes for many diseases or cosmetic procedures. Thus, there is the need for culturing and expanding cells in-vitro for several weeks remain. Our aim is to investigate if long- term proliferation with minimal passaging will affect the stemness, paracrine secretions and carcinogenesis markers of ADSC. The immunophenotypic properties and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity of the initial stromal vascular fraction (SVF) and serially passaged ADSC were observed by flow cytometry. In parallel, the telomerase activity and the relative expression of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes were assessed by q-PCR. We also assessed the cytokine secretion profile of passaged ADSC by an ELISA. The expanded ADSC retain their morphological and phenotypical characteristics. These cells maintained in culture for up to 12 weeks until P4, possessed stable telomerase and ALDH activity, without having a TP53 mutation. Furthermore, the relative expression levels of TP53, RB, and MDM2 were not affected while the relative expression of c-Myc decreased significantly. Finally, the levels of the secretions of PGE2, STC1, and TIMP2 were not affected but the levels of IL-6, VEGF, and TIMP 1 significantly decreased at P2. Our results suggest that the expansion of passaged ADSC does not affect the differentiation capacity of stem cells and does not confer a cancerous state or capacity in vitro to the cells."
https://openalex.org/W2520981540,"Dental calculus is a mineralized deposit associated with periodontitis. The bacterial components contained in dental calculus can be recognized by host immune sensors, such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and induce transcription of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β. Studies have shown that cellular uptake of crystalline particles may trigger NLRP3 inflammasome activation, leading to the cleavage of the IL-1β precursor to its mature form. Phagocytosis of dental calculus in the periodontal pocket may therefore lead to the secretion of IL-1β, promoting inflammatory responses in periodontal tissues. However, the capacity of dental calculus to induce IL-1β secretion in human phagocytes has not been explored. To study this, we stimulated human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with dental calculus collected from periodontitis patients, and measured IL-1β secretion by ELISA. We found that calculus induced IL-1β secretion in both human PMNs and PBMCs. Calculus also induced IL-1β in macrophages from wild-type mice, but not in macrophages from NLRP3- and ASC-deficient mice, indicating the involvement of NLRP3 and ASC. IL-1β induction was inhibited by polymyxin B, suggesting that LPS is one of the components of calculus that induces pro-IL-1β transcription. To analyze the effect of the inorganic structure, we baked calculus at 250°C for 1 h. This baked calculus failed to induce pro-IL-1β transcription. However, it did induce IL-1β secretion in lipid A-primed cells, indicating that the crystalline structure of calculus induces inflammasome activation. Furthermore, hydroxyapatite crystals, a component of dental calculus, induced IL-1β in mouse macrophages, and baked calculus induced IL-1β in lipid A-primed human PMNs and PBMCs. These results indicate that dental calculus stimulates IL-1β secretion via NLRP3 inflammasome in human and mouse phagocytes, and that the crystalline structure has a partial role in the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome."

U.S.A. 2001; 98: 3832-3836Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), and brain-specific conditional knock-out of the PFN1 gene during development led to cerebellar hypoplasia and abnormal neuronal migration (12.Kullmann J.A.

However, there have been few reports on the pathological functions of fALS mutant PFN1; the level of PFN1-bound actin was shown to be reduced upon overexpression of the fALS mutant PFN1 compared with wild-type (wt) PFN1 in HEK293 cells (6.Wu C.H. Fallini C. Ticozzi N. Keagle P.J. Sapp P.C. Piotrowska K. Lowe P. Koppers M. McKenna-Yasek D. Baron D.M. Kost J.E. Gonzalez-Perez P. Fox A.D. Adams J.

These data suggested a partial loss-of-function mechanism in neurodegeneration caused by fALS mutations in PFN1. TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) is a member of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins, which functions in a series of steps in DNA/RNA processing (14.Ling S.C. Polymenidou M.

Importantly, recent autopsy studies of patients with ALS carrying PFN1 mutations revealed the presence of TDP-43-positive neuronal or glial cytoplasmic inclusions (8.Fratta P. Charnock J. Collins T.

However, the mechanisms whereby PFN1 and TDP-43 lead to neurodegeneration remain unclear. Targeted depletion of TDP-43 in the spinal motor neurons of mice has been shown to lead to a progressive motor dysfunction associated with motor neuron loss (17.Wu L.S. Cheng W.C. Shen C.K. Targeted depletion of TDP-43 expression in the spinal cord motor neurons leads to the development of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 27335-27344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that overexpression of wt or fALS mutant TDP-43 caused neurodegeneration through its RNA-binding motif in the retina of transgenic (TG) Drosophila melanogaster (18.Ihara R. Matsukawa K. Nagata Y. Kunugi H. Tsuji S. Chihara T. Kuranaga E. Miura M. Wakabayashi T. Hashimoto T. Iwatsubo T. RNA binding mediates neurotoxicity in the transgenic Drosophila model of TDP-43 proteinopathy.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2013; 22: 4474-4484Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These findings implicated malfunction of RNA processing in the mechanisms of neurodegeneration induced by TDP-43. In the present study, we established a series of TG D. melanogaster lines overexpressing wt or fALS mutant PFN1 using the GAL4-UAS system, which we crossed with TDP-43 TG flies. We found that overexpression of the fALS mutant PFN1 in the retinal photoreceptor neurons significantly exacerbated the retinal degeneration of TDP-43 TG fly compared with that in TDP-43 single TG flies, whereas co-expression of wt PFN1 did not aggravate the phenotype caused by overexpression of TDP-43. Co-expression of TDP-43 with fALS mutant PFN1 increased the cytoplasmic localization of TDP-43 in retinal neurons, whereas it predominantly localized to nuclei upon co-expression with wt PFN1. Co-expression of TDP-43 lacking the nuclear localization signal with the fALS mutant PFN1 did not exacerbate retinal degeneration. Based on these findings, we propose a mechanism of neurodegeneration by fALS mutations of PFN1 through a shift in the localization of TDP-43 from nuclei to cytoplasm. To elucidate the mechanism whereby fALS mutations in PFN1 cause neurodegeneration, we established D. melanogaster overexpressing human wt or fALS mutant (C71G or M114T) PFN1 using the GAL4-UAS system (19.Brand A.H. Perrimon N. Targeted gene expression as a means of altering cell fates and generating dominant phenotypes.Development. 1993; 118: 401-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We generated TG flies overexpressing UAS-wt PFN1, C71G, or M114T mutant PFN1 and crossed them with the gmr-Gal4 line to overexpress proteins in the retinal cells. In the eyes of adult Drosophila, each ommatidium contains a cluster of eight rhabdomeres (R1–R8) (20.Kumar J.P. Signaling pathways in drosophila and vertebrate retinal development.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 846-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). External surface of eyes of 5-day-old TG flies revealed no degenerative phenotypes, e.g. necrotic patches or fusion of ommatidia, in the eye of wt, C71G, or M114T mutant PFN1 TG flies, as well as in TG flies expressing lacZ as a control protein (Fig. 1A). Histological observation of eyes of 5-day-old TG flies also revealed no apparent degenerative phenotype, e.g. vacuolation or disturbance in the ommatidial alignment, in the retina of lacZ TG flies, or two independent lines (transgenes inserted on chromosome 2 or 3) of wt or fALS mutant PFN1 TG flies (Fig. 1B). To evaluate the retinal degeneration, we measured the retinal thickness of TG fly lines and found that there was no significant difference between wt, C71G, or M114T mutant TG flies and lacZ TG flies (Fig. 1C, 66.7 ± 1.29 μm in LacZ, 67.0 ± 2.07 μm in wt PFN1 (p = 1.00), 65.9 ± 2.11 μm in C71G mutant PFN1 (p = 0.99), 65.3 ± 1.44 μm in M114T mutant PFN1 (p = 0.95)). Immunoblot analyses of the lysates of heads of TG flies showed that C71G or M114T mutant PFN1 proteins were expressed as ∼14-kDa polypeptides co-migrating with wt PFN1 in the retinal photoreceptor neurons, at similar expression levels to those in TG flies expressing wt PFN1 (Fig. 1D). These data showed that overexpression of wt or fALS mutant PFN1 did not cause any degeneration in the photoreceptor neurons of D. melanogaster. We have previously reported that overexpression of TDP-43 caused a progressive neuronal degeneration in the retina of D. melanogaster (18.Ihara R. Matsukawa K. Nagata Y. Kunugi H. Tsuji S. Chihara T. Kuranaga E. Miura M. Wakabayashi T. Hashimoto T. Iwatsubo T. RNA binding mediates neurotoxicity in the transgenic Drosophila model of TDP-43 proteinopathy.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2013; 22: 4474-4484Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To investigate whether fALS mutation in PFN1 affects the TDP-43-induced neuronal degeneration, we generated TG fly lines doubly overexpressing human wt TDP-43 and human wt, C71G, or M114T mutant PFN1 in the retina, under the control of the gmr-Gal4 driver. The external surface of eyes of 5-day-old double TG flies revealed that C71G or M114T mutant PFN1/TDP-43 double TG flies exhibited severe degenerative phenotype, e.g. fusion of ommatidia compared with TDP-43 single TG flies or wt PFN1/TDP-43 double TG flies (Fig. 2A). Histological analysis also showed that overexpression of C71G or M114T mutant PFN1 exacerbated retinal degeneration and caused a significant reduction in the thickness of the retina in mutant PFN1/TDP-43 double TG flies compared with those in TDP-43 single TG flies (Fig. 2, B and C, 45.7 ± 2.40 μm in TDP-43 single, 22.8 ± 1.09 μm in C71G mutant PFN1/TDP-43 (p < 0.001), 23.9 ± 2.76 μm in M114T mutant PFN1/TDP-43 (p < 0.001)), whereas overexpression of wt PFN1 did not alter the retinal degeneration in wt PFN1/TDP-43 double TG flies (Fig. 2, B and C, 49.9 ± 2.52 μm in wt PFN1/TDP-43 (p = 0.65)). Immunoblot analysis of the lysates of heads of single or double TG flies showed that overexpression of wt, C71G, or M114T mutant PFN1 in TDP-43 TG flies did not affect the level of TDP-43 protein compared with that in TDP-43 single TG flies (Fig. 2D). To examine whether the level of severity of retinal degeneration is different among lines, we crossed 3 lines of PFN1 TG flies with different levels of PFN1 expression and with TDP-43 TG flies. We found that the 3 lines of wt PFN1/TDP-43 double TG flies exhibited similar levels of retinal degeneration to TDP-43 single TG flies (supplemental Fig. S1). We also found that 3 lines each of C71G or M114T mutant PFN1/TDP-43 double TG flies exhibited more severe retinal degeneration compared with TDP-43 single TG flies (supplemental Fig. S1). We did not observe significant differences in the severity of retinal degeneration among lines of C71G or M114T mutant PFN1/TDP-43 double TG flies. To investigate whether fALS mutations in PFN1 specifically exacerbate neurodegeneration induced by TDP-43, we generated TG fly lines that doubly overexpress PFN1 and FUS under control of the gmr-Gal4 driver. Similar to TDP-43, FUS has been identified as a causative gene for familial ALS (21.Kwiatkowski Jr., T.J. Bosco D.A. Leclerc A.L. Tamrazian E. Vanderburg C.R. Russ C. Davis A. Gilchrist J.

Rademakers R. Roeber S. Baker M. Kretzschmar H.A. Mackenzie I.R.

Sci. 2010; 293: 6-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We found that overexpression of human FUS in the retina of fly caused a progressive neuronal degeneration in a similar manner to TDP-43 TG flies (supplemental Fig. S2, B and C, 45.7 ± 1.80 μm in FUS TG (p < 0.001, compared with LacZ TG)). We found that the degree of retinal degeneration in double TG flies overexpressing wt, C71G, or M114T mutant PFN1 and FUS was at similar levels to those in FUS single TG flies (supplemental Fig. S2, A–C, 41.6 ± 2.36 μm in wt PFN1/FUS (p = 0.61), 45.7 ± 2.18 μm in C71G mutant PFN1/FUS (p = 1.00), 43.8 ± 2.17 μm in M114T mutant PFN1/FUS (p = 0.97)). Immunoblot analysis of the lysates of heads of TG flies showed that overexpression of wt, C71G, or M114T mutant PFN1 in FUS TG flies did not affect the levels of FUS proteins compared with those in FUS single TG flies (supplemental Fig. S2 D). These data suggested that the fALS mutant PFN1, but not wt PFN1, specifically exacerbated the retinal degeneration induced by TDP-43, but not by FUS. To elucidate the mechanism whereby the fALS mutant PFN1 exacerbated retinal degeneration induced by TDP-43, we examined the effects of wt and fALS mutant PFN1 in culture cells. It has been reported that wt PFN1 was present predominantly in the Nonidet P-40-soluble fraction of Neuro-2A cells; in sharp contrast, the fALS mutant PFN1, including C71G and M114T, was detected in both soluble and insoluble fractions (6.Wu C.H. Fallini C. Ticozzi N. Keagle P.J. Sapp P.C. Piotrowska K. Lowe P. Koppers M. McKenna-Yasek D. Baron D.M. Kost J.E. Gonzalez-Perez P. Fox A.D. Adams J. Taroni F. et al.Mutations in the profilin 1 gene cause familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.Nature. 2012; 488: 499-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). We transfected EGFP, wt, C71G, or M114T mutant PFN1 into human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells and found that wt PFN1 was predominantly present in the Nonidet P-40-soluble fraction, whereas C71G or M114T PFN1 were fractionated into both Nonidet P-40-soluble and -insoluble fractions (Fig. 3A). These data suggest that fALS mutations reduce the solubility of PFN1. We further examined the subcellular localization pattern of PFN1 and TDP-43 in HEK293 cells and human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells. Wt PFN1 has been reported to exhibit a diffuse cytoplasmic localization pattern in HEK293 cells (25.Shao J. Diamond M.I. Protein phosphatase 1 dephosphorylates profilin-1 at Ser-137.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e32802Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) or Neuro-2A cells (6.Wu C.H. Fallini C. Ticozzi N. Keagle P.J. Sapp P.C. Piotrowska K. Lowe P. Koppers M. McKenna-Yasek D. Baron D.M. Kost J.E. Gonzalez-Perez P. Fox A.D. Adams J. Taroni F. et al.Mutations in the profilin 1 gene cause familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.Nature. 2012; 488: 499-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). TDP-43 has been reported to shuttle between the cytoplasm and nuclei and reside predominantly in the nucleus (26.Ayala Y.M. Zago P. D'Ambrogio A. Xu Y.F. Petrucelli L. Buratti E. Baralle F.E. Structural determinants of the cellular localization and shuttling of TDP-43.J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 3778-3785Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). We transfected EGFP, wt, C71G, or M114T mutant PFN1 into HEK293 cells and observed that C71G or M114T mutant PFN1 localized in cytoplasmic aggregates, whereas wt PFN1 was diffusely distributed at the cytoplasm (Fig. 3B). Endogenous TDP-43 was predominantly localized at the nucleus in EGFP- or wt-PFN1-transfected HEK293 cells (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, however, endogenous TDP-43 was partially co-localized in the cytoplasmic aggregates with transfected C71G or M114T fALS mutant PFN1 in HEK293 cells (Fig. 3B). Subcellular fractionation analysis showed that the ratio of cytoplasmic TDP-43 to nuclear TDP-43 in C71G- or M114T-PFN1-transfected HEK293 cells was significantly increased compared with EGFP-transfected HEK293 cells, whereas the ratio of cytoplasmic TDP-43 to nuclear TDP-43 in wt-PFN1-transfected HEK293 cells was similar to that in EGFP-transfected HEK293 cells (Fig. 3, C and D). In contrast, the ratios of cytoplasmic FUS to nuclear FUS were comparable among EGFP-, wt-, C71G-, and M114T-PFN1-transfected HEK293 cells (Fig. 3, C and E). These data suggest that fALS mutant PFN1 specifically affected the subcellular localization of endogenous TDP-43. We also transfected EGFP, wt, C71G, or M114T mutant PFN1 into SK-N-SH cells and observed that endogenous TDP-43 was diffusely localized in both nucleus and cytoplasm in C71G- or M114T-PFN1-transfected SK-N-SH cells, whereas endogenous TDP-43 was predominantly localized in nucleus in EGFP- or wt-PFN1-transfected SK-N-SH cells (Fig. 3F). Unlike in HEK293 cells transfected with fALS mutant PFN1 (Fig. 3B), PFN1- or TDP-43-immunopositive cytoplasmic aggregates were not detected in the cytoplasm of SK-N-SH cells transfected with fALS mutant PFN1 (Fig. 3F). Taken together, we concluded that fALS mutations in PFN1 alter the subcellular localization of TDP-43 from nucleus to cytoplasm. To examine whether fALS mutant PFN1 affects the subcellular localization of TDP-43 in the Drosophila retinal cells, we immunolabeled sections of heads of double TG flies overexpressing wt or fALS mutant PFN1 and TDP-43 in the retinal cells using two different anti-TDP-43 antibodies and found that TDP-43 was predominantly localized at nuclei of retinal cells in wt PFN1/TDP-43 double TG flies, in a similar manner to those in TDP-43 single TG flies (Fig. 4, A and C). Notably, TDP-43 was localized both to the nuclei and cytoplasm in retinal cells of double TG flies overexpressing C71G or M114T mutant PFN1 and TDP-43 (Fig. 4, A and C). Fluorescence intensity profiles of immunolabeling with the anti-TDP-43 antibodies also revealed the nuclear localization pattern of TDP-43 in the retinal cells of wt PFN1/TDP-43 double TG flies, whereas both nuclear and cytoplasmic localization patterns of TDP-43 in the retinal cells was observed in the fALS mutant PFN1/TDP-43 double TG flies (Fig. 4, B and D), suggesting that fALS mutations in PFN1 lead to the redistribution of TDP-43 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in the Drosophila retinal cells. We found that nuclear localization of FUS in the retinal cells was not altered by overexpression of wt or fALS mutant PFN1 in double TG flies (data not shown). Wt or fALS mutant PFN1 has been reported to predominantly localize at the cytoplasm (6.Wu C.H. Fallini C. Ticozzi N. Keagle P.J. Sapp P.C. Piotrowska K. Lowe P. Koppers M. McKenna-Yasek D. Baron D.M.

Protein phosphatase 1 dephosphorylates profilin-1 at Ser-137.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e32802Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We also found that wt or C71G, M114T mutant PFN1 localized at cytoplasm in the HEK293 cells (Fig. 3, B and C) or in the retinal cells of PFN1/TDP-43 double TG flies (data not shown). These data suggest that the increase in cytoplasmic localization of TDP-43 in fALS mutant PFN1/TDP-43 double TG flies may contribute to the exacerbation of retinal degeneration induced by TDP-43. To test this idea, we crossed TG flies overexpressing wt or fALS mutant PFN1 with TG flies expressing nuclear localization signal (NLS) mutant TDP-43 (18.Ihara R. Matsukawa K. Nagata Y. Kunugi H. Tsuji S. Chihara T. Kuranaga E. Miura M. Wakabayashi T. Hashimoto T. Iwatsubo T. RNA binding mediates neurotoxicity in the transgenic Drosophila model of TDP-43 proteinopathy.Hum. Mol.

We have previously shown that TG flies overexpressing NLS mutant TDP-43, in which TDP-43 is localized to the cytoplasm due to the replacement of 6 amino acids within the NLS of TDP-43 with alanine (27.Winton M.J.

TG flies overexpressing the NLS mutant TDP-43 exhibited more severe retinal degeneration compared with wt TDP-43 TG flies (Fig. 5, A–C, 31.8 ± 1.47 μm in NLS mutant TDP-43 (p < 0.001)), as described (18.Ihara R.

Co-expression of NLS mutant TDP-43 with wt PFN1 also exhibited more severe degenerative phenotypes in the retina than those expressing wt TDP-43 and wt PFN1 (Fig. 5, A–C, 29.7 ± 2.28 μm in wt PFN1/NLS mutant TDP-43 (p < 0.001)). However, co-expression of the NLS mutant TDP-43 with C71G or the M114T mutant PFN1 exhibited retinal degeneration at similar levels to those co-expressing wt TDP-43 with C71G or M114T mutant PFN1, respectively (Fig. 5, A–C, 23.4 ± 1.50 μm in C71G mutant PFN1/NLS mutant TDP-43 (p = 0.82), 22.4 ± 0.76 μm in M114T mutant PFN1/NLS mutant TDP-43 (p = 0.60)). Immunoblot analysis of lysates of heads revealed that overexpression of wt, C71G, or M114T mutant PFN1 did not affect the expression level of NLS mutant TDP-43 (Fig. 5D). These data le"
https://openalex.org/W2518728705,"Background Though previous work has examined some aspects of the dermatology workforce shortage and access to dermatologic care, little research has addressed the effect of rising interest in cosmetic procedures on access to medical dermatologic care. Our objective was to determine the wait times for Urgent and Non-Urgent medical dermatologic care and Cosmetic dermatology services at a population level and to examine whether wait times for medical care are affected by offering cosmetic services. Methods A population-wide survey of dermatology practices using simulated calls asking for the earliest appointment for a Non-Urgent, Urgent and Cosmetic service. Results Response rates were greater than 89% for all types of care. Wait times across all types of care were significantly different from each other (all P < 0.05). Cosmetic care was associated with the shortest wait times (3.0 weeks; Interquartile Range (IQR) = 0.4–3.4), followed by Urgent care (9.0 weeks; IQR = 2.1–12.9), then Non-Urgent Care (12.7 weeks; IQR = 4.4–16.4). Wait times for practices offering only Urgent care were not different from practices offering both Urgent and Cosmetic care (10.3 vs. 7.0 weeks). Interpretation Longer wait times and greater variation for Urgent and Non-Urgent dermatologic care and shorter wait times and less variation for Cosmetic care. Wait times were significantly longer in regions with lower dermatologist density. Provision of Cosmetic services did not increase wait times for Urgent care. These findings suggest an overall dermatology workforce shortage and a need for a more streamlined referral system for dermatologic care."
https://openalex.org/W2519523645,"Low-power laser irradiation (LPLI) is a non-invasive and safe method for cancer treatment that alters a variety of physiological processes in the cells. Autophagy can play either a cytoprotective role or a detrimental role in cancer cells exposed to stress. The detailed mechanisms of autophagy and its role on cytotoxicity in oral cancer cells exposed to LPLI remain unclear. In this study, we showed that LPLI at 810 nm with energy density 60 J/cm2 increased the number of microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 (MAP1LC3) puncta and increased autophagic flux in oral cancer cells. Moreover, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was induced, which increased RelA transcriptional activity and beclin 1 (BECN1) expression in oral cancer cells irradiated with LPLI. Furthermore, ROS scavenger or knockdown of RelA diminished LPLI-induced BECN1 expression and MAP1LC3-II conversion. In addition, pharmacological and genetic ablation of autophagy significantly enhanced the effects of LPLI-induced apoptosis in oral cancer cells. These results suggest that autophagy may be a resistant mechanism for LPLI-induced apoptosis in oral cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2520154031,"Lysine demethylation of proteins such as histones is catalyzed by several classes of enzymes, including the FAD-dependent amine oxidases KDM1A/B. The KDM1 family is homologous to the mitochondrial monoamine oxidases MAO-A/B and produces hydrogen peroxide in the nucleus as a byproduct of demethylation. Here, we show KDM1A is highly thiol-reactive in vitro and in cellular models. Enzyme activity is potently and reversibly inhibited by the drug disulfiram and by hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide produced by KDM1A catalysis reduces thiol labeling and inactivates demethylase activity over time. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry indicates that hydrogen peroxide blocks labeling of cysteine 600, which we propose forms an intramolecular disulfide with cysteine 618 to negatively regulate the catalytic activity of KDM1A. This activity-dependent regulation is unique among histone-modifying enzymes but consistent with redox sensitivity of epigenetic regulators."
https://openalex.org/W2518813451,"Local endemic species with their unique evolutionary history always stirred the interest of scientists. One such area especially rich in endemics is northern Italy. In case of pill millipedes of the genus Glomeris Latreille, 1803, only a single species is found in northern Europe, while 22 country-endemics alone are known from Italy. Many of these endemics, however, have not been studied in several decades; therefore we aimed to determine whether this diversity is the result of overlooked synonymies or natural processes. A focus was placed on the local endemics that are in some aspects morphologically similar to the widespread and variable G. klugii Brandt, 1833. The local endemics Glomeris larii Verhoeff, 1921, G. primordialis Verhoeff, 1930, G. oblongoguttata Verhoeff, 1894, G. oropensis Verhoeff, 1936, G. transalpina Koch, 1836, G. romana Verhoeff, 1900, G. ligurica Latzel, 1884 and G. apuana Verhoeff, 1911 were included in a molecular analysis incorporating ribosomal nuclear (28S) and mitochondrial (COI) genes. Individuals were sequenced and compared to 31 specimens from 18 localities of G. klugii. The final dataset included 657 base pairs for 56 terminals in the COI, and 14 terminals with 1068 base pairs in the combined 28S and COI analysis. Our analysis shows intraspecific distances of up to 5% in the COI gene in G. klugii that are not strictly correlated to geography or color pattern. G. larii is discovered to be genetically and morphologically identical to G. klugii and is synonymised with the latter. Interspecific distances in our dataset vary between 6.7 to 15.9%, with the lowest (6.7–9.0%) between G. primordialis and G. klugii. Our analysis confirms the species status of the local endemics G. primordialis, G. oblongoguttata, G. oropensis, G. transalpina, G. ligurica and G. apuana. We also confirm the synonymy of G. undulata Koch, 1844 under G. klugii. G. genuensis Latzel, 1886 is indistinguishable from G. ligurica."
https://openalex.org/W2519342367,"Tibetia and Gueldenstaedtia are two morphologically similar and small genera in Fabaceae, with distributions largely corresponding to the Sino-Himalayan and Sino-Japanese subkingdoms in eastern Asia, respectively. These two genera have confusing relationships based on morphology; therefore, we aimed to provide a clear understanding of their phylogenetic and biogeographic evolution within eastern Asia. In our investigations we included 88 samples representing five Gueldenstaedtia species, five Tibetia species, and outgroup species were sequenced using five markers (nuclear: ITS; chloroplast: matK, trnL-F, psbA-trnH and rbcL). Our phylogenetic results support (1) the monophyly of Tibetia and of Gueldenstaedtia, respectively; and (2) that Tibetia and Gueldenstaedtia are sister genera. Additionally, our data identified that Tibetia species had much higher sequence variation than Gueldenstaedtia species. Our results suggest that the two genera were separated from each other about 17.23 million years ago, which is congruent with the Himalayan orogeny and the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau in the mid Miocene. The divergence of Tibetia and Gueldenstaedtia is strongly supported by the separation of the Sino-Himalayan and Sino-Japanese region within eastern Asia. In addition, the habitat heterogeneity may accelerate the molecular divergence of Tibetia in the Sino-Himalayan region."
https://openalex.org/W2520778281,"Introduction Rupatadine is a marketed second generation antihistamine, with anti-PAF activity, indicated for symptomatic treatment of allergic rhinitis and urticaria. This study was conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), safety and tolerability of rupatadine in healthy Japanese subjects after single and multiple oral doses. Methods In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 27 male and female healthy Japanese subjects were administered single and multiple escalating rupatadine dose of 10, 20 and 40 mg or placebo. Blood samples were collected at different time points for PK measurements and subjects were assessed for safety and tolerability. The effect of rupatadine on cognitive functioning was evaluated by means of computerized cognitive tests: rapid visual information processing (RVP), reaction time (RT), spatial working memory (SWM) and visual analogue scales (VAS). Results Exposure to rupatadine as measured by Cmax and AUC was found to increase in a dose dependent manner over the dose range of 10–40 mg for both single and multiple dose administration. The safety assessments showed that all treatment related side effects were of mild intensity and there were no serious adverse events (SAEs) or withdrawals due to treatment–emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in this study. The therapeutic dose of rupatadine did not show any CNS impairment in any of the cognitive tests. Conclusions This study demonstrated that rupatadine is safe and well tolerated by Japanese healthy subjects. The PK-PD profile confirmed previous experience with rupatadine."
https://openalex.org/W2520975835,"Epidemiological findings suggest that social involvement plays a major role in establishing resilience to adversity, however, the neurobiology by which social involvement confers protection is not well understood. Hypothesizing that social involvement confers resilience by changing the way adverse life events are encoded, we designed a series of behavioral tests in mice that utilize the presence or absence of conspecific cage mates in measuring response to novel and adverse events. We found that the presence of cage mates increased movement after exposure to a novel environment, increased time spent in the open arms of the elevated plus maze, and decreased freezing time after a foot shock as well as expedited fear extinction, therefore significantly changing the response to adversity. This is a first description of a mouse model for the effects of social involvement on adverse life events. Understanding how social involvement provides resilience to adversity may contribute to the future treatment and prevention of mental and physical illness."
https://openalex.org/W2520302955,"The recent availability of novel dyes and alternative light sources to facilitate complex tissue immunofluorescence studies such as multiplex labelling has not been matched by reports critically evaluating the considerations and relative benefits of these new tools, particularly in combination. Product information is often limited to wavelengths used for older fluorophores (FITC, TRITC & corresponding Alexa dyes family). Consequently, novel agents such as Quantum dots are not widely appreciated or used, despite highly favourable properties including extremely bright emission, stability and potentially reduced tissue autofluorescence at the excitation wavelength. Using spectral analysis, we report here a detailed critical appraisal and comparative evaluation of different light sources and fluorophores in multiplex immunofluorescence of clinical biopsy sections. The comparison includes mercury light, metal halide and 3 different LED-based systems, using 7 Qdots (525, 565, 585, 605, 625, 705), Cy3 and Cy5. We discuss the considerations relevant to achieving the best combination of light source and fluorophore for accurate multiplex fluorescence quantitation. We highlight practical limitations and confounders to quantitation with filter-based approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2515125077,"Our previous studies revealed molecular alterations of tumor vessels, varying from immature to mature alterations, resulting from Abraxane, and demonstrated that the integrin-specific PET tracer 18F-FPPRGD2 can be used to noninvasively monitor such changes. However, changes in the tumor vasculature at functional levels such as perfusion and permeability are also important for monitoring Abraxane treatment outcomes in patients with cancer. The purpose of this study is to further investigate the vascular response during Abraxane therapy and the effectiveness of its synergistic interaction with cisplatin using Dynamic contrast enhanced-magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI). Thirty MDA-MB-435 tumor mice were randomized into three groups: PBS control (C group), Abraxane only (A group), and sequential treatment with Abraxane followed by cisplatin (A-P group). Tumor volume was monitored based on caliper measurements. A DCE-MRI protocol was performed at baseline and day 3. The Ktrans, Kep and Ve were calculated and compared with CD31, α-SMA, and Ki67 histology data. Sequential treatment with Abraxane followed by cisplatin produced a significantly greater inhibition of tumor growth during the three weeks of the observation period. Decreases in Ktrans and Kep for the A and A-P groups were observed on day 3. Immunohistological staining suggested vascular remodeling during the Abraxane therapy. The changes in Ktrans and Kep values were correlated with alterations in the permeability of the tumor vasculature induced by the Abraxane treatment. In conclusion, Abraxane-mediated permeability variations in tumor vasculature can be quantitatively visualized by DCE-MRI, making this a useful method for studying the effects of early cancer treatment, especially the early vascular response. Vascular remodeling by Abraxane improves the efficiency of cisplatin delivery and thus results in a favorable treatment outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2519055068,"High temperature adversely affects normal development of male germ cells in mammals. Acute heat stress induces the formation of stress granules (SGs) in a set of male germ cells, and the SGs have been proposed to protect those cells from heat-induced apoptosis. DAZL, one of DAZ (Deleted in Azoospermia) family proteins, was shown to be an essential component of SGs, which is required for SG formation in the mouse testis. In the present study, we asked whether BOULE, the founding member of DAZ family proteins, is a component of the SGs. We show that BOULE is recruited to the SGs upon heat stress, and that these SGs are developmental stage-specific. These results suggest that DAZ family proteins may have conserved roles in the SGs of male germ cells."
https://openalex.org/W2520115965,"Objective To assess whether a patient’s in-hospital length of stay (LOS) and mortality can be explained by early objective and/or physicians’ subjective-risk assessments. Data Sources/Study Setting Analysis of a detailed dataset of 1,021 patients admitted to a large U.S. hospital between January and September 2014. Study Design We empirically test the explanatory power of objective and subjective early-risk assessments using various linear and logistic regression models. Principal Findings The objective measures of early warning can only weakly explain LOS and mortality. When controlled for various vital signs and demographics, objective signs lose their explanatory power. LOS and death are more associated with physicians’ early subjective risk assessments than the objective measures. Conclusions Explaining LOS and mortality require variables beyond patients’ initial medical risk measures. LOS and in-hospital mortality are more associated with the way in which the human element of healthcare service (e.g., physicians) perceives and reacts to the risks."
https://openalex.org/W2520874199,"The aim of this study was to determine the relative abundance and relationship of vitamin D responsive and calcium transporting transcripts (TRPV5, TRPV6, calD9k, calD28k, PMCA, NCX1, CYP27B1, CYP24A1, and VDR) in ovine, canine and, equine kidney using quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR), and then perform a comparison between the three species. Renal tissue samples were harvested post-mortem from 10 horses, 10 sheep, and five dogs. Primers were designed for each gene. For each sample total RNA was extracted, cDNA synthesised, and RT-qPCR was performed. RT-qPCR data were normalised and statistical comparison was performed. Due to their consistent correlation with each other in each species, TRPV6, calD9k/calD28k, and PMCA appeared to be the main pathways involved in active transepithelial calcium transport in the kidney of sheep, dogs and horses. The results indicate that all of the studied genes were expressed in the renal tissue of studied species, although the expression levels and correlation of transcripts with each other were different from species to species. All vitamin D responsive and calcium transporting transcripts were highly correlated with VDR in equine kidney, but not in sheep and dogs. The CYP27B1 and CYP24A1 mRNAs showed a different renal expression pattern and correlation in horses compared with sheep and dogs. Given the high urinary calcium concentration and low serum 1,25(OH)2D concentration in horses, it could be expected that CYP27B1 expression would be lower than CYP24A1 in the horse, and this did not appear to be the case. The findings suggest that despite low serum vitamin D concentrations, vitamin D still plays a significant role in calcium metabolism in horses, especially given the strong correlations between VDR and vitamin D responsive transcripts in these animals."
https://openalex.org/W2520995132,"Excessive dexamethasone (Dex) application causes osteoblast cell death, which could lead to osteoporosis or osteonecrosis. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation is shown to protect osteoblasts/osteoblastic cells from Dex. In this report, we tested the potential effect of OSU53, a novel AMPK activator, in Dex-treated osteoblastic cells. We show that OSU53 activated AMPK signaling in human OB-6 osteoblastic cells. Further, Dex-induced osteoblastic OB-6 cell death and apoptosis were largely attenuated with pre-treatment with OSU53. OSU53 was more efficient than other known AMPK activators (A-769662 and Compound 13) in protecting OB-6 cells against Dex. AMPK activation is required for OSU53-induced actions in OB-6 cells. AMPKα shRNA knockdown or dominant-negative mutation (dn-AMPKα T172A) almost completely blocked OSU53-induced AMPK activation and OB-6 cell protection against Dex. Further studies showed that OSU53 increased NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) activity and alleviated Dex-induced oxidative stress in OB-6 cells. Such effects by OSU53 were again almost abolished with AMPKα shRNA or dn-AMPKα in OB-6 cells. Together, these results demonstrate that OSU53 protects osteoblastic cells from Dex possibly via activating AMPK-dependent signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2520459820,"Establishing the KRAS mutational status of tumor samples is essential to manage patients with colorectal or lung cancer, since these mutations preclude treatment with monoclonal anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibodies. We report an inexpensive, rapid multiplex allele-specific qPCR method detecting the 7 most clinically relevant KRAS somatic mutations with concomitant amplification of non-mutated KRAS in tumor cells and tissues from CRC patients. Positive samples evidenced in the multiplex assay were further subjected to individual allele-specific analysis, to define the specific mutation. Reference human cancer DNA harbouring either G12A, G12C, G12D, G12R, G12S, G12V and G13D confirmed assay specificity with ≤1% sensitivity of mutant alleles. KRAS multiplex mutation analysis usefulness was also demonstrated with formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) from CRC biopsies. Conclusion. Co-amplification of non-mutated DNA avoided false negatives from degraded samples. Moreover, this cost effective assay is compatible with mutation detection by DNA sequencing in FFPE tissues, but with a greater sensitivity when mutant DNA concentrations are limiting."
https://openalex.org/W2520500118,"In human sperm motility analysis, sperm segmentation plays an important role to determine the location of multiple sperms. To ensure an improved segmentation result, the Laplacian of Gaussian filter is implemented as a kernel in a pre-processing step before applying the image segmentation process to automatically segment and detect human spermatozoa. This study proposes an intersecting cortical model (ICM), which was derived from several visual cortex models, to segment the sperm head region. However, the proposed method suffered from parameter selection; thus, the ICM network is optimised using particle swarm optimization where feature mutual information is introduced as the new fitness function. The final results showed that the proposed method is more accurate and robust than four state-of-the-art segmentation methods. The proposed method resulted in rates of 98.14%, 98.82%, 86.46% and 99.81% in accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and precision, respectively, after testing with 1200 sperms. The proposed algorithm is expected to be implemented in analysing sperm motility because of the robustness and capability of this algorithm."
https://openalex.org/W2520846169,"A number of studies have been conducted on hybridization between transgenic Brassica napus and B. rapa or backcross of F1 hybrid to their parents. However, trait changes must be analyzed to evaluate hybrid sustainability in nature. In the present study, B. rapa and transgenic (BrAGL20) B. napus were hybridized to verify the early flowering phenomenon of F1 hybrids, and F1 hybrid traits were analyzed to predict their impact on sustainability. Flowering of F1 hybrid has been induced slightly later than that of the transgenic B. napus, but flowering was available in the greenhouse without low temperature treatment to young plant, similar to the transgenic B. napus. It is because the BrAGL20 gene has been transferred from transgenic B. napus to F1 hybrid. The size of F1 hybrid seeds was intermediate between those of B. rapa and transgenic B. napus, and ~40% of F1 pollen exhibited abnormal size and morphology. The form of the F1 stomata was also intermediate between that of B. rapa and transgenic B. napus, and the number of stomata was close to the parental mean. Among various fatty acids, the content of erucic acid exhibited the greatest change, owing to the polymorphism of parental FATTY ACID ELONGASE 1 alleles. Furthermore, F2 hybrids could not be obtained. However, BC1 progeny were obtained by hand pollination of B. rapa with F1 hybrid pollen, with an outcrossing rate of 50%."
https://openalex.org/W2519066208,"Sevoflurane exposure impairs the long-term memory in neonates. Whether the exposure to animals in adolescence affects the memory, however, has been unclear. A small hydrolase enzyme of guanosine triphosphate (GTPase) rac1 plays a role in the F-actin dynamics related to the synaptic plasticity, as well as superoxide production via reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase activation. The current study was designed to examine whether sevoflurane exposure to mice in early adolescence modifies the long-term learning ability concomitantly with the changes in F-actin constitution as well as superoxide production in the hippocampus according to the levels of rac1 protein expression. Four-week-old mice were subjected to the evaluation of long-term learning ability for three days. On day one, each mouse was allowed to enter a dark chamber for five min to acclimatization. On day two, the procedure was repeated with the addition of an electric shock as soon as a mouse entered the dark chamber. All mice subsequently inhaled 2 L/min air with (Sevoflurane group) and without (Control group) 2.5% sevoflurane for three hours. On day three, each mouse was placed on the platform and retention time, which is the latency to enter the dark chamber, was examined. The brain removed after the behavior test, was used for analyses of immunofluorescence, Western immunoblotting and intracellular levels of superoxide. Sevoflurane exposure significantly prolonged retention time, indicating the enhanced long-term memory. Sevoflurane inhalation augmented F-actin constitution coexisting with the rac1 protein overexpression in the hippocampus whereas it did not alter the levels of superoxide. Sevoflurane exposure to 4-week-old mice accelerates the long-term memory concomitantly with the enhanced F-actin constitution coexisting with the small GTPase rac1 overexpression in the hippocampus. These results suggest that sevoflurane inhalation may amplify long-term memory consolidation via the increased cytoskeleton constitution in the hippocampus of animals in early adolescence."
https://openalex.org/W2519905063,"In this study the hydrogel microparticles (MPs) were used to enhance migration of neutrophils in order to improve outcome of anthrax infection in a mouse model. Two MP formulations were tested. In the first one the polyacrylamide gel MPs were chemically coupled with Cibacron Blue (CB) affinity bait. In the second one the bait molecules within the MPs were additionally loaded with neutrophil-attracting chemokines (CKs), human CXCL8 and mouse CCL3. A non-covalent interaction of the bait with the CKs provided their gradual release after administration of the MPs to the host. Mice were challenged into footpads with Bacillus anthracis Sterne spores and given a dose of MPs a few hours before and/or after the spores. Pre-treatment with a single dose of CK-releasing MPs without any additional intervention was able to induce influx of neutrophils to the site of spore inoculation and regional lymph nodes correlating with reduced bacterial burden and decreased inflammatory response in footpads. On average, in two independent experiments, up to 53% of mice survived over 13 days. All control spore-challenged but MP-untreated mice died. The CB-coupled particles were also found to improve survival likely due to the capacity to stimulate release of endogenous CKs, but were less potent at decreasing the inflammatory host response than the CK-releasing MPs. The CK post-treatment did not improve survival compared to the untreated mice which died within 4 to 6 days with a strong inflammation of footpads, indicating quick dissemination of spores though the lymphatics after challenge. This is the first report on the enhanced innate host resistance to anthrax in response to CKs delivered and/or endogenously induced by the MPs."
https://openalex.org/W2519129589,"Health professional education is experiencing a cultural shift towards student-centered education. Although we are now challenging our traditional training methods, our methods for evaluating the impact of the training on the learner remains largely unchanged. What is not typically measured is student-centered value; whether it was 'worth' what the learner paid. The primary aim of this study was to apply a method of calculating student-centered value, applied to the context of a change in teaching methods within a health professional program. This study took place over the first semester of the third year of the Bachelor of Physiotherapy at Monash University, Victoria, Australia, in 2014. The entire third year cohort (n = 78) was invited to participate. Survey based design was used to collect the appropriate data. A blended learning model was implemented; subsequently students were only required to attend campus three days per week, with the remaining two days comprising online learning. This was compared to the previous year's format, a campus-based face-to-face approach where students attended campus five days per week, with the primary outcome-Value to student. Value to student incorporates, user costs associated with transportation and equipment, the amount of time saved, the price paid and perceived gross benefit. Of the 78 students invited to participate, 76 completed the post-unit survey (non-participation rate 2.6%). Based on Value to student the blended learning approach provided a $1,314.93 net benefit to students. Another significant finding was that the perceived gross benefit for the blended learning approach was $4014.84 compared to the campus-based face-to-face approach of $3651.72, indicating that students would pay more for the blended learning approach. This paper successfully applied a novel method of calculating student-centered value. This is the first step in validating the value to student outcome. Measuring economic value to the student may be used as a way of evaluating effective change in a modern health professional curriculum. This could extend to calculate total value, which would incorporate the economic implications for the educational providers. Further research is required for validation of this outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2519233151,"The multi-scalar complexity of social-ecological systems makes it challenging to quantify impacts from human activities on ecosystems, inspiring risk-based approaches to assessments of potential effects of human activities on valued ecosystem components. Risk assessments do not commonly include the risk from indirect effects as mediated via habitat and prey. In this case study from British Columbia, Canada, we illustrate how such ""indirect risks"" can be incorporated into risk assessments for seventeen ecosystem components. We ask whether (i) the addition of indirect risk changes the at-risk ranking of the seventeen ecosystem components and if (ii) risk scores correlate with trophic prey and habitat linkages in the food web. Even with conservative assumptions about the transfer of impacts or risks from prey species and habitats, the addition of indirect risks in the cumulative risk score changes the ranking of priorities for management. In particular, resident orca, Steller sea lion, and Pacific herring all increase in relative risk, more closely aligning these species with their ""at-risk status"" designations. Risk assessments are not a replacement for impact assessments, but-by considering the potential for indirect risks as we demonstrate here-they offer a crucial complementary perspective for the management of ecosystems and the organisms within."
https://openalex.org/W2521019013,"Antibiotic treatment of acute otitis media (AOM) has been suggested to increase the risk of future AOM episodes by causing unfavorable shifts in microbial flora. Because current evidence on this topic is inconclusive and long-term follow-up data are scarce, we wanted to estimate the effect of antibiotic treatment for a first AOM episode occurring during infancy on AOM recurrences and AOM-related health care utilization later in life.We obtained demographic information and risk factors from data of the Wheezing Illnesses Study Leidsche Rijn, a prospective birth cohort study in which all healthy newborns born in Leidsche Rijn (between 2001 and 2012), The Netherlands, were enrolled. These data were linked to children's primary care electronic health records up to the age of four. Children with at least one family physician-diagnosed AOM episode before the age of two were included in analyses. The exposure of interest was the prescription of oral antibiotics (yes vs no) for a child's first AOM episode before the age of two years.848 children were included in analyses and 512 (60%) children were prescribed antibiotics for their first AOM episode. Antibiotic treatment was not associated with an increased risk of total AOM recurrences (adjusted rate ratio: 0.94, 95% CI: 0.78-1.13), recurrent AOM (≥3 episodes in 6 months or ≥4 in one year; adjusted risk ratio: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.57-1.11), or with increased AOM-related health care utilization during children's first four years of life.Oral antibiotic treatment of a first AOM episode occurring during infancy does not affect the number of AOM recurrences and AOM-related health care utilization later in life. This information can be used when weighing the pros and cons of various AOM treatment options."

The 2016 Lasker∼Koshland Special Achievement Award will be presented to Bruce Alberts for a lifetime career of outstanding scientific discovery and inspiring leadership and mentorship in promoting fundamental research, science education, and rational, evidence-based values worldwide. A picture can be worth a thousand words—and sometimes many more. At the National Academy of Sciences, Bruce Alberts’s portrait was unveiled in 2005 at the completion of his two-term NAS presidency (Figure 1). Unlike those of the 19 distinguished men who preceded Bruce at the helm of that staid organization—launched by Abraham Lincoln to advise government on matters of science—the painting captures Bruce wearing a broad smile and a tie that beams over a dozen emojis hell bent on out-smiling him. Thinking that the portrait implies that Bruce took a casual approach to the Academy’s mission would disregard the entirety of his 12-year legacy. Indeed, Bruce’s distinctive activities at the NAS emerged as deeply impactful elements in national science policies and education, punctuating his remarkable career-spanning contributions, which collectively will be honored by the 2016 Lasker∼Koshland Special Achievement Award in Medical Science, one of the highest recognitions of science in the US. Bruce will receive the award “for fundamental discoveries in DNA replication and protein biochemistry; for visionary leadership in directing national and international scientific organizations to better people’s lives; and for passionate dedication to improving education in science and mathematics.” Taking similar notice, President Obama foreshadowed this year’s Lasker jury decision, presenting Bruce with the National Medal of Science in 2014. Bruce currently holds the position of Chancellor’s Leadership Chair for Science and Education in the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics at the University of California, San Francisco. As a Harvard freshman, he was inspired by the late John Moore’s 1957 textbook, Principles of Zoology (Moore, 1957Moore J.A. Principles of Zoology. Oxford University Press, 1957Google Scholar), which framed biological concepts as broad ideas to be embraced or challenged, a dramatic break from the then-current way of science teaching comprised entirely of memorizing lists of facts, such as the details of metabolic pathways and the nomenclature of organisms or body parts. Moore and his book “brought science to life as an exciting and profound human endeavor” (https://brucealberts.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/moore-john-a.pdf). Enamored with Moore’s approach, Bruce fashioned for his PhD research a seductively creative but overly narrow model for the mechanism of initiation of DNA replication. Failure to confirm his model turned into a “wake up call” when his thesis committee declined to award his degree, delaying the imminent start of his postdoc at the University of Geneva (Alberts, 2004Alberts B. Nature. 2004; 431: 1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Bruce absorbed from his failure a broad lesson: biology is complex. Thus, any specific model, no matter how pleasing on first principles, is unlikely to be correct. In response, he refined his research strategy during his postdoc years, consciously developing approaches that would advance knowledge independent of any particular preconceived model. Still focusing on the mechanism of DNA replication, he developed this time a general strategy instead of pursuing a circumscribed idea. He fashioned DNA-cellulose, the first affinity chromatographic matrix using a biological molecule as capture agent, to identify DNA-binding proteins that might be involved in replication. As an assistant professor at Princeton, he combined his catalog of biochemically identified DNA binding proteins with the extensive set of bacteriophage T4 replication defective mutants collected by Richard Epstein in Geneva and colleagues at Caltech. He exploited the capacity to produce preparative amounts of those proteins from T4-infected E. coli to develop an in vitro complementation strategy that validated their significance to the replication process, facilitated their purification, and at the same time illuminated their functions. Armed with his hard-won insights into research strategic planning, Bruce launched his independent career at Princeton. One of us (K.R.Y.) was fortunate to be assigned for a summer research rotation prior to the beginning of first-year classes and was later privileged to become the second graduate student in his lab. Bruce’s rigorous yet remarkably generous mentoring and his efforts to enliven science education were already in bloom: when the pre-first year rotation student refined a method that Bruce had been developing for harvesting phage, Bruce arranged for the rotation student—rather than for himself—to present a talk at the prestigious Cold Spring Harbor Phage Meeting; when that same graduate student declared interest in eukaryotic transcriptional regulation rather than T4 replication, Bruce not only assented but deeply engaged in the project rather than demanding coherence of investigations in his small lab. He also helped arrange for a leave for that graduate student, by then in his fourth year, to work full time in George McGovern’s presidential campaign—and then to return to complete graduate school, helping him to publish one of his papers as sole author. Bruce created an energetic research environment, held to high standards and expectations, simultaneously challenging and joyful. And, instead of spending every waking hour pressing his own research, Bruce started a program that brought Trenton high school students to Princeton for fun days of hands-on science, cementing a foundation of concept-driven learning and a developing a growing appreciation for how effective science education could at the same time nurture intellectual power and foster social impact. Throughout his time at Princeton—and after his move in 1976 to UCSF—Bruce made seminal methodological and experimental contributions and unveiled brilliant intellectual insights that advanced our understanding and thinking about DNA replication—its initiation, its processivity, and its fidelity. Following his isolation of T4 gp32, his demonstration that it bound selectively and cooperatively to single-stranded DNA, and his deduction and subsequent proof that it unwinds double helical DNA ahead of the advancing DNA polymerase, Bruce employed his in vitro complementation assays to isolate and initially characterize six additional factors. In a tour de force, his laboratory reconstituted the replication process using these purified proteins, demonstrating necessity and sufficiency. Most importantly, Bruce discovered that the replication proteins assemble into a large functional complex. This realization, founded on solid experimental results, suggested a way that polymerases, various other enzymes and structural components that each previously had been shown to operate separately on the leading and lagging DNA strands, might themselves interact to form an integrated assembly, a supra-molecular “protein machine” that drives replication. Amplifying on this concept, Bruce demonstrated that such multicomponent protein machines can themselves form yet higher-order assemblies as underscored by the coupling of T4 DNA replication and recombination/repair. These insights led him to suggest that cells are collections of macromolecular machines (Alberts, 1998Alberts B. Cell. 1998; 92: 291-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar), organized, functioning, and interacting, within the constraints of evolution, according to engineering principles. By suggesting that such machines carry out every major cellular process, that specialty factors attach transiently to provoke specialized activities such as initiation or elongation, and that inter-machine interactions produce inter-process interactions potentially with emergent properties, Bruce’s work changed thinking, education, and experimentation across cell and molecular biology. The concept that protein machines, that is, assemblages of stable and dynamic components functioning cooperatively, execute complex cellular transactions is now a generally accepted paradigm that drives experimental design and interpretation. With his fertile scientific intellect and stellar research contributions, his deep commitment to essential science education, and a remarkable clarity of vision for policies and practices that would advance or improve both research and education, Bruce juggled a daunting blend of research, education, and administrative responsibilities for over two decades. The balancing act began just 7 years after his appointment to the Princeton faculty, when he became Acting Chair of Biochemical Sciences. Indeed, he moved to UCSF as Vice-Chair of the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, where he contributed to seeding what would become one of the most renowned biological research communities worldwide. In 1985, he assumed the chairmanship of the department, just as he was developing new experimental approaches to a new research focus, centered on the role of the cytoskeleton during early development. As with bacteriophage T4, Bruce chose an experimental system, Drosophila melanogaster, which was richly grounded in genetics and, in addition, enjoyed elegant classical cytological and cell biological description. Bruce developed and was refining novel approaches to access and analyze actin binding proteins and the centrosome to probe the functional organization and interplay of cytoplasm and nuclei during the highly stereotyped dynamics of some of the earliest developmental stages. That exciting new effort was cut short, however, when Bruce accepted election in 1993 to the presidency of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), reluctantly closing his lab soon after moving to Washington DC. As NAS president and chair of the National Research Council (NRC), his vision was global and an echo of his character:To dream about a nation, and a world, that is permeated by the best representations of science and scientific values—honesty, generosity, a respect for evidence, and openness to all ideas and opinions irrespective of their source (Alberts, 1999Alberts, B.M. (1999). Annual Address to NAS Members. https://brucealberts.ucsf.edu/publications/Speech8.pdf.Google Scholar). He excited and inspired by enunciating key issues, including many viewed as challenging or impossible, and by investing enormous energy and leadership in seeing them to fruition. He developed the first National Science Education Standards and then helped build tools to enable teachers and school boards to meet them. As NRC chair, he brought young scientists into the science policy arena by launching the prestigious Christine Mirzayan Science and Technology Graduate Fellowship Program, and he oversaw publication of nearly 200 National Research Council reports focused on education. As NAS president, he advanced public understanding of the societal contributions of basic science through a 20-part series, “Beyond Discovery: The Path from Research to Human Benefit,” (http://www.nasonline.org/publications/beyond-discovery) and by opening the Marian Koshland Science Museum at the NAS in Washington. In short, he impacted the world as the “Education President” of the NAS. As a global ambassador of science and science education, Bruce traveled the world, building lasting, trusted relationships with governments and science academies in Asia, Africa, the Middle East, South America, and elsewhere. He helped to launch two formal networks, the InterAcademy Panel, which brings together science academies and assists formation of new ones, and the Inter-Academy Council, which Bruce co-chaired for its first decade, mobilizing global scientists and engineers to advise the United Nations, the World Bank, and other international groups. Later, he answered the call from President Obama to serve for 2 years as a Science Envoy for the U.S. Department of State to Indonesia and Pakistan, helping to connect and empower the next generation of scientific leaders to work across national and religious boundaries and across a wide spectrum of disciplines. This last appointment overlapped by a year with a nearly 5 year tenure as Editor-in-Chief of Science, a bully pulpit from which Bruce promoted changes in NIH policy, and improved science education at all levels. He emerged as a passionate advocate for curiosity-driven investigator-initiated research and sounded an alarm against expanding support for translational research with narrow clinical goals at the expense of open-ended approaches that have consistently produced broadly impactful, path-breaking, and paradigm-changing discoveries. These timely arguments, so important to the science community at large, seemed to mirror and amplify Bruce’s personal lesson, learned many years before, about the relative value of research that could expand general knowledge as opposed to potentially validating a particular idea. Much earlier, Bruce had astutely equated the value of artesian bread made in small family-run bakeries versus the output of Wonderbread factories in order to promote small, creative labs over huge groups pushing massive efforts of sometimes questionable value toward pre-envisioned endpoints (Alberts, 1985Alberts B.M. Cell. 1985; 41: 337-338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Bruce’s engagement as proponent of fundamental scientific research remains strong, as evidenced by his current leadership in addressing the research and training funding crisis in the US. Along with Marc Kirschner, Shirley Tilghman, and Harold Varmus, Bruce suggested that a national morale crisis in biomedical research has been driven by perceived flaws in the system of funding and managing the scientific enterprise. The “Rescuing Biomedical Research” (http://rescuingbiomedicalresearch.org/) effort seeks to identify and address important and frustrating barriers to effective science and to re-think elements of the infrastructure that supports biomedical research in this country. Bruce’s leadership and unwavering concern for young scientists has been a key driver throughout. Throughout his career, Bruce has promoted the philosophy that science and science education enable societal progress—that citizens who demand evidence-based decision-making create stronger, more just societies that could counterbalance irrationalities that govern much of current world affairs. Beginning with the notion that all children are born as innate scientists, eager to understand the world around them, underscored by the inevitable “Why”? phase that parents of every preschooler know so well, Bruce has sought to build and amplify that innate curiosity and to counter education systems that feed facts and test for prepackaged answers. His NAS portrait reminds us all: science is fun! In 1987, Bruce co-founded the Science and Health Education Partnership (SEP) that brings together scientists from UCSF and teachers of the San Francisco Unified School District as partners promoting curiosity, seeking evidence and celebrating discovery. As lead author of one of most renowned cell biology textbooks—“Molecular Biology of the Cell”—Bruce used his personal share of the book’s royalties to launch SEP. Some 30 years later, SEP is firmly established as an institutionally supported, national and international model of science education, bringing together hundreds of practicing scientist volunteers—graduate students, postdocs, technical staff, and faculty—in a true partnership with K–12 teachers in virtually every San Francisco public school. In 2011, SEP was honored by the White House with the Presidential Award for Excellence for Science, Mathematics, and Engineering Mentoring. True to John Moore’s principles, SEP supports inquiry—not regurgitated facts—as a way of learning and knowing. The same concept applies to the textbook. Challenged by Jim Watson in 1978 to address the then-evolving confluence of molecular and cell biology, Bruce and a team of pioneering authors struggled for 5 years until a first edition was crafted that succeeded in defining the field by its fundamental principles rather than disembodied lists of factoids. Molecular Biology of the Cell, now in its sixth edition, has helped generations of budding young scientists to find a firm footing based on established concepts and acknowledgment of the vast open spaces for new discovery. As co-author on recent editions, one of us (PW) enjoys the privilege of working with Bruce on this effort, whose success reflects his leadership style, which fosters the author team, inclusive of publishers, editors, illustrators, spouses, and children, to function as an expansive family with a common purpose. Just as the expansive legacy of his NAS presidency might contrast to his whimsical portrait, Bruce appears to present many contradictions. He is, indeed, at the same time strong and humble, tough and warm, discriminating and inclusive, awe inspiring and approachable, visionary and razor focused. Yet these seemingly contradictory characteristics simply reveal different facets of his character—unassuming brilliance, optimistic humanism, quiet self-confidence, absence of ego—that have made his work so important and him so impactful across the arc of our science endeavor. For over four decades, as an individual scientist, an academic scholar and educator, a national and international leader, Bruce Alberts has profoundly and distinctively advanced science and science education and has engendered a deepened scientific perspective on public discourse and public policy."
