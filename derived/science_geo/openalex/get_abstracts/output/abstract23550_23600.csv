https://openalex.org/W2086776723,"The mechanism by which cell surface molecules regulate T cell production of lymphokines is poorly understood. Production of interleukin-2 (IL-2) can be regulated by signal transduction pathways distinct from those induced by the T cell antigen receptor. Stimulation of CD28, a molecule expressed on most human T cells, induced the formation of a protein complex that bound to a site on the IL-2 gene distinct from previously described binding sites and increased IL-2 enhancer activity fivefold. The CD28-responsive complex bound to the IL-2 gene between -164 and -154 base pairs from the transcription start site. The sequence of this element is similar to regions conserved in the 5′ flanking regions of several other lymphokine genes."
https://openalex.org/W1607687470,"The biochemical signaling mechanisms involved in transducing the effects of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) and gamma-interferon (gamma-IFN) on leukemia cell differentiation are poorly defined. Recent studies established the existence of a sphingomyelin cycle that operates in response to the action of vitamin D3 on HL-60 cells and that may transduce the effects of vitamin D3 on cell differentiation (Okazaki, T., Bell, R., and Hannun, Y. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 19076-19080). The effects of TNF alpha and gamma-IFN on sphingomyelin turnover were determined, and the specificity and role of sphingomyelin hydrolysis in HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells with 20% hydrolysis of sphingomyelin at 15 min, 40% hydrolysis at 30-60 min, and return to base line at 2 h. The hydrolyzed sphingomyelin (18 pmol/nmol total phospholipid) was accompanied by the concomitant generation of ceramide (11.2 pmol/nmol total phospholipid). gamma-IFN also caused reversible hydrolysis of sphingomyelin with onset at 1 h and peak effect at 2 h. This sphingomyelin cycle appeared to be specific to the monocytic pathway of HL-60 differentiation, since it was not activated by retinoic acid or dibutyryl cAMP, inducers of granulocytic differentiation, nor with phorbol myristate acetate, an inducer of macrophage-like differentiation. Addition of synthetic ceramide or bacterial sphingomyelinase induced monocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells. Cell-permeable ceramide also caused prompt down-regulation of mRNA for the c-myc protooncogene. The time course of c-myc down-regulation was consistent with the action of ceramide as the mediator of TNF alpha action. These results suggest that sphingomyelin turnover may be an important signaling mechanism transducing the actions of TNF alpha and gamma-IFN with specific function in cell differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1982756681,"Virion protein 16 (VP16) of herpes simplex virus type 1 contains an acidic transcriptional activation domain. Missense mutations within this domain have provided insights into the structural elements critical for its function. Net negative charge contributed to, but was not sufficient for, transcriptional activation by VP16. A putative amphipathic alpha helix did not appear to be an important structural component of the activation domain. A phenylalanine residue at position 442 was exquisitely sensitive to mutation. Transcriptional activators of several classes contain hydrophobic amino acids arranged in patterns resembling that of VP16. Therefore, the mechanism of transcriptional activation by VP16 and other proteins may involve both ionic and specific hydrophobic interactions with target molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2074641624,"An expression cloning strategy was devised to isolate the keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) receptor complementary DNA. NIH/3T3 fibroblasts, which secrete this epithelial cell-specific mitogen, were transfected with a keratinocyte expression complementary DNA library. Among several transformed foci identified, one demonstrated the acquisition of specific high-affinity KGF binding sites. The pattern of binding competition by related fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) indicated that this receptor had high affinity for acidic FGF as well as KGF. The rescued 4.2-kilobase complementary DNA was shown to encode a predicted membrane-spanning tyrosine kinase related to but distinct from the basic FGF receptor. This expression cloning approach may be generally applicable to the isolation of genes that constitute limiting steps in mitogenic signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2066341116,"The role of topoisomerase II (topo II) in chromosome condensation was studied in a mitotic extract derived from Xenopus eggs by specific immunodepletion. HeLa nuclei, which have a high complement of endogenous topo II, are converted to mitotic chromosomes in the topo II-depleted extract equally well as in the control. Chicken erythrocyte nuclei, however, which have a very low content of topo II, do not convert to condensed chromosomes in the depleted extract, although their condensation is normal upon addition of purified topo II. Dosage experiments support the possible notion of a structural involvement of topo II in chromosome condensation. In the topo II-depleted extract the erythrocyte nuclei progress to precondensation chromosomes, which lack the nuclear membrane-lamina complex and consist of a cluster of swollen chromatids."

https://openalex.org/W1586746737,"The cerebellar inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) receptor is a high molecular weight glycoprotein abundantly expressed in Purkinje cells. The subunit structure of the InsP3 receptor protein was examined by cross-linking experiments. Agarose-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the cross-linked materials demonstrated that the cerebellar InsP3 receptor protein is composed of four noncovalently bound identical subunits each with a Mr of 320,000 in both purified and microsome-bound states. Chromatography of the purified receptor on a calmodulin-Sepharose column demonstrated a Ca2(+)-dependent interaction of the InsP3 receptor with calmodulin. Photoaffinity labeling of the cerebellar microsomal fraction with [alpha-32P]8-azidoadenosine 5'-triphosphate revealed the presence of ATP-binding site in the InsP3 receptor. Scatchard analysis of the purified InsP3 receptor revealed the Bmax and Kd values for ATP binding of 2.3 pmol/micrograms and 17 microM, respectively. Reconstitution of the purified InsP3 receptor into the planar lipid bilayer indicated channel activity in the purified receptor. It exhibited a calcium conductance (26 pS in 53 mM Ca2+) and sodium conductance (21 pS in 100-500 mM asymmetric Na+ solutions) with permeability ratios of PCa/PTris = 6.3 and PNa/PCl = 5.4. The purified channel was activated with submillimolar ATP in the presence of InsP3 and modified to reach a large conductance state."
https://openalex.org/W1510104405,"Abstract The turkey beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-AR), the m1 and m2 forms of the human muscarinic cholingeric receptor (MAChR) and several other mutant and wild-type G protein-coupled receptors were produced in insect Sf9 cells by infection with recombinant baculoviruses. Maximal expression for most receptors was 5-30 pmol receptor/mg protein (2-15 nmol/liter culture). The receptors displayed typical ligand binding characteristics. The beta-AR was glycosylated; electrophoretic behavior of the two MAChRs also suggested glycosylation. The beta-AR stimulated endogenous adenylyl cyclase in response to beta-adrenergic agonists. The beta-AR and both MAChRs were purified and coreconstituted with various purified G proteins in phospholipid vesicles. The recombinant beta-AR catalyzed the agonist-dependent activation of Gs by guanosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) with the same efficiency as did the natural beta-AR. The m2 MAChR efficiently catalyzed GTP gamma S binding to Go and to the recently identified G protein Gz (Gx). The m2 MAChR also catalyzed the activation of Gj,1 and Gj,3 weakly. Activation of these same G proteins by the ml MAChR was much less efficient, consistent with its known selectivity for pertussis toxin-insensitive G proteins (Gp) that have not yet been isolated. The beta-AR and m2 MAChR were characteristically stimulated by reduction of disulfides. These results demonstrate the general utility of the baculovirus system for production of large quantities of native G protein-coupled receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1589359602,"The activity of 6-phosphogluconate dehydratase was significantly lower in extracts of aerobically grown Escherichia coli deficient in superoxide dismutase (sodAsodB) and in mutants lacking the inducible manganese-containing superoxide dismutase (sodA), exposed to the redox-cycling agent paraquat, than in the parental strain. Growth of these strains on a gluconate minimal medium was also impaired under these conditions. The enzyme was most susceptible to dioxygen in superoxide dismutase (SOD)-free extracts, and exogenous SOD afforded a concentration-dependent protection against inactivation. The amount of SOD necessary for full protection was comparable to the amount normally present in extracts of aerobic E. coli (7-36 units/mg protein), and the rate of reaction of O2- with the dehydratase was estimated to be approximately 2.0 x 10(8) M-1 s-1. The dehydratase was much less sensitive to O2 or H2O2 than to O2-. The virtual substrate, alpha-glycerophosphate, provided partial protection. Iron chelators, thiol-reactive reagents, and oxidants, including nitrite and diamide, inactivated the enzyme. Fluoride ions stabilized the dehydratase and blocked the effect of oxidants. The O2(-)-sensitive target site is proposed to be an iron-sulfur cluster which is readily destroyed by oxidation."
https://openalex.org/W2128559753,"MPF, a protein kinase complex consisting of cyclin and p34cdc2 subunits, promotes the G2 to M phase transition in eukaryotic cells. The pathway of activation and inactivation of MPF is not well understood, although there is strong evidence that removal of phosphate from a tyrosine residue on p34cdc2 is part of the activation process. INH was originally identified as an activity that could inhibit the posttranslational activation of a latent form of MPF, called pre-MPF, in immature (G2 phase-arrested) Xenopus oocytes. We have purified INH and demonstrated that it is a form of protein phosphatase 2A. Both INH and the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A can directly inactivate an isolated p34cdc2-cyclin complex. Both cyclin and p34cdc2 become dephosphorylated; the rate of inactivation closely parallels the removal of phosphate from a specific site on p34cdc2. We propose that INH opposes MPF activation by reversing this critical phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2067554394,"We have isolated a dominant mutation in a gene called Son of sevenless (Sos) that is an allele-specific suppressor of the sevenless phenotype. This suppressor function is autonomously required in R7 and is sensitive to the dosage of the Sos and bride of sevenless genes. Loss-of-function alleles of Sos are recessive lethals, but in the eye Sos has a role in R cell development. Mutations in Sos also interact with the Ellipse allele of the Drosophila EGF receptor. We propose a model suggesting that the Sos product is downstream of sevenless and the EGF receptor, and that the dominant suppression results from the overexpression or increased activity of the gene product."
https://openalex.org/W2085889911,"Matrix/scaffold attachment regions (MARs/SARs) partition chromatin into functional loop domains. Here we have identified a chicken protein that selectively binds to MARs from the chicken lysozyme locus and to MARs from Drosophila, mouse, and human genes. This protein, named ARBP (for attachment region binding protein), was purified to homogeneity and shown to bind to MARs in a cooperative fashion. ARBP is an abundant nuclear protein and a component of the internal nuclear network. Deletion mutants indicate that multiple AT-rich sequences, if contained in a minimal approximately 350 bp MAR fragment, can lead to efficient binding of ARBP. Furthermore, dimerization mutants show that, to bind ARBP efficiently, MAR sequences can act synergistically over large distances, apparently with the intervening DNA looping out. The binding characteristics of ARBP to MARs reproduce those of unfractionated matrix preparations, suggesting that ARBP is an important nuclear element for the generation of functional chromatin loops."
https://openalex.org/W2036083888,"Mutations in the unc-104 gene of the nematode C. elegans result in uncoordinated and slow movement. Transposon insertions in three unc-104 alleles (e2184, rh1016, and rh1017) were used as physical markers to clone the unc-104 gene. DNA sequence analysis of unc-104 cDNAs revealed an open reading frame capable of encoding a 1584 amino acid protein with similarities to kinesin heavy chain. The similarities are greatest in the amino-terminal ATPase and microtubule-binding domains. Although the primary sequence relatedness to kinesin is weak in the remainder of the molecule, the predicted secondary structure and regional isoelectric points are similar to kinesin heavy chain."
https://openalex.org/W2039231750,"Opioids and opiates decrease the duration of action potentials and the amount of neurotransmitter released from sensory neurons. The μ-type opioid receptor, the binding site for morphine, is thought to act exclusively on K+ channels. Here, we show that activation of the μ receptor inhibits Ca s+ channels in rat sensory neurons; the effect is blocked by a μ antagonist and is not mimicked by κ or S receptor agonists. Both low-threshold (T-type) and high-threshold Ca 2+ currents are partially suppressed. ω-Conotoxin-sensitive and ω-conotoxin-insensitive, high-threshold Ca2+ currents are inhibited. The kinetic effect on high-threshold current is like that caused by diminished rest potential: the transient component is selectively lost, whereas the sustained component is spared."
https://openalex.org/W1672163784,"Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is a heparin-binding protein expressing potent mitogenic and angiogenic properties. Elevated levels of bFGF have recently been described in human glioma cell lines. The high degree of vascularity and invasiveness which characterize human gliomas suggest that activated expression of bFGF or similar proteins may be related to the aberrant growth patterns of these tumors. The influence of endogenous bFGF on glioma cell growth in vitro was evaluated in the present study by down-regulating bFGF expression using antisense oligonucleotide primers. The addition of 50 microM bFGF-specific antisense primer to the human glioma cell line SNB-19 resulted in an 80% inhibition in glioma growth. This effect was saturable and specific. Antisense primers directed to two different sites of bFGF mRNA were effective in suppressing SNB-19 growth, whereas sense strand primer was ineffective. Furthermore, only the antisense primer significantly reduced the specific activity of bFGF protein in SNB-19 cell extracts. Neither antisense or sense primers inhibited the growth of non-transformed human glia. bFGF mRNA was detected in both transformed and non-transformed human glia by polymerase chain reaction analysis suggesting that alterations in bFGF isoform content or activity may be specifically related to abnormal growth control in human gliomas."
https://openalex.org/W1619811636,"Recent evidence indicates that matrix vesicles (MV) interact with cartilage-specific collagens and other matrix proteins. Both type II and X collagens bind to and cosediment with MV. Our companion study shows that MV also are tightly coupled to proteoglycan link proteins (LP) and hyaluronic acid-binding region (HABR) in cartilage matrix. Here we sought to identify proteins responsible for the nexus between MV and matrix collagens using affinity chromatography with types I, II, and X collagen-Sepharose columns. Elution with NaCl step-gradients in the presence of nonionic detergent was used to assess the affinity between the MV proteins and the covalently attached collagens. Several MV proteins were found to bind to native type I, II, and X collagens but none bound to denatured type I collagen. Alkaline phosphatase, proteoglycan LP and HABR, and the 33- and 67-kDa annexins, bound with varying affinities to the native type I, II and X columns. In particular, LP and HABR, the 67-kDa annexin, and alkaline phosphatase bound with high affinity to the cartilage-specific collagens, although LP, HABR, and a 37-kDa protein also bound less tightly to native type I collagen. Thus, several MV proteins bind specifically to native type II and X collagens and should promote interaction between MV and the extracellular matrix. Such interactions may be important in MV formation, or in MV-mediated mineralization."
https://openalex.org/W1590365266,"Kinetic, spectroscopic, and chemical evidence for the formation of specific catalytically essential complexes between the three protein components of the soluble form of methane monooxygenase from Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b is reported. The effects of the concentrations of the reductase and component B on the hydroxylation activity of the reconstituted enzyme system has been numerically simulated based on a kinetic model which assumes formation of multiple high affinity complexes with the hydroxylase component during catalysis. The formation of several of these complexes has been directly demonstrated. By using EPR spectroscopy, the binding of approximately 2 mol of component B/mol of hydroxylase (subunit structure (alpha beta gamma)2) is shown to significantly change the electronic environment of the mu-(H/R)-oxo-bridged binuclear iron cluster of the hydroxylase in both the mixed valent (Fe(II).Fe(III)) and fully reduced (Fe(II).Fe(II)) states. Protein-protein complexes between the reductase and component B as well as between the reductase and hydroxylase have been shown to form by monitoring quenching of the tryptophan fluorescence spectrum of either the component B (KD approximately 0.4 microM) or hydroxylase (two binding sites, KDa approximately 10 nM, KDb approximately 8 microM). The observed KD values are in agreement with the best fit values from the kinetic simulation. Through the use of the covalent zero length cross-linking reagent 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (EDC), the binding sites of the component B and reductase were shown to be on the hydroxylase alpha and beta subunits, respectively. The alpha and beta subunits of the hydroxylase are cross-linked by EDC suggesting that they are juxtaposed. EDC also caused the rapid loss of the ability of the monomeric component B to stimulate the hydroxylation reaction suggesting that cross-linking of reactive groups on the protein surface had occurred. This effect was inhibited by the presence of hydroxylase and was accompanied by a loss of the ability of the component B to bind to the hydroxylase. Thus, formation of a component B-hydroxylase complex is apparently required for effective catalysis linked to NADH oxidation. When present in concentrations greater than required to saturate the initial hydroxylase complex, component B inhibited both the rate of the enzymic reaction and the cross-linking of the reductase to the hydroxylase. This suggests that a second complex involving component B can form that negatively regulates catalysis by preventing formation of the reductase-hydroxylase complex."
https://openalex.org/W1595839746,"Ligand-activated epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors are coupled to the phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) pathway to stimulate formation of two second messengers, inositol trisphosphate and diacylglycerol. Investigation of the interaction between EGF receptors and phosphoinositide kinases identified PtdIns and PtdIns(4)P kinase activities in extensively washed EGF receptor immunoprecipitates. Studies using COOH-terminal truncation mutant EGF receptors and immunoisolation by an EGF receptor peptide anti-serum in the presence of peptide (residues 644-666) indicated that the phosphoinositide kinases were associated with the region located between the inner membrane boundary and the kinase domain of the EGF receptor. In vivo cross-linking identified four tyrosine phosphorylated proteins of approximately 135, 62, 55, and 47 kDa associated with the EGF receptor. After EGF stimulation, PtdIns and PtdIns(4)P kinase activities were markedly increased among proteins isolated by monoclonal antiphosphotyrosine antibodies. The activities associated with the EGF receptor and with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were identified as PtdIns4-and PtdIns(4)P 5-kinase. Tyrosine dephosphorylation did not alter the activity of the prominent PtdIns(4)P 5-kinase activity. These results indicate that the phosphoinositide kinases are associated with and tyrosine phosphorylated by the EGF receptor as part of the mechanism coordinating responses between signal transduction pathways but do not demonstrate that tyrosine phosphorylation of PtdIns(4)P 5-kinase is sufficient to activate the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1523683597,"Bestatin, an inhibitor of aminopeptidases, was also a potent inhibitor of leukotriene (LT) A4 hydrolase. On isolated enzyme its effects were immediate and reversible with a Ki = 201 +/- 95 mM. With erythrocytes it inhibited LTB4 formation greater than 90% within 10 min; with neutrophils it inhibited LTB4 formation by only 10% during the same period, increasing to 40% in 2 h. Bestatin inhibited LTA4 hydrolase selectively; neither 5-lipoxygenase nor 15-lipoxygenase activity in neutrophil lysates was affected. Purified LTA4 hydrolase exhibited an intrinsic aminopeptidase activity, hydrolyzing L-lysine-p-nitroanilide and L-leucine-beta-naphthylamide with apparent Km = 156 microM and 70 microM and Vmax = 50 and 215 nmol/min/mg, respectively. Both LTA4 and bestatin suppressed the intrinsic aminopeptidase activity of LTA4 hydrolase with apparent Ki values of 5.3 microM and 172 nM, respectively. Other metallohydrolase inhibitors tested did not reduce LTA4 hydrolase/aminopeptidase activity, with one exception; captopril, an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme, was as effective as bestatin. The results demonstrate a functional resemblance between LTA4 hydrolase and certain metallohydrolases, consistent with a molecular resemblance at their putative Zn2(+)-binding sites. The availability of a reversible, chemically stable inhibitor of LTA4 hydrolase may facilitate investigations on the role of LTB4 in inflammation, particularly the process termed transcellular biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2168649579,"There has been a long-standing belief that the mechanisms of mammalian and yeast splicing differ fundamentally in their requirement for a pyrimidine-rich motif preceding the 3' splice site. Using an in vivo assay, we have tested the influence of uridine content on competition between alternative 3' splice sites in yeast. We find that a uridine-rich tract preceding a PyAG greatly enhances its ability to compete as a splice acceptor. Moreover, a proximal PyAG is often overlooked if a more distal PyAG occurs in a superior sequence context; this observation cannot be accounted for by simple scanning models. Finally, we show that a distal (greater than 30 nucleotide) 3' splice site that is not preceded by uridines is a poor substrate for the second step of splicing; this argues that recognition of a uridine-rich motif is required for effective identification and utilization of distant splice sites."
https://openalex.org/W2026877273,"The determination of the structure of proteins and other organic materials by transmission electron microscopy is a rapidly developing field. Obtaining high-resolution images of these radiation-sensitive specimens has, until recently, been problematic. The development of spot-scan imaging, in which the electron beam is focused to a spot with a diameter of about 1000 angstroms and moved over the specimen to record the image, has overcome some of the most severe problems, which result from beam-induced motion of the specimen and its image. Elimination of this motion greatly enhances the contrast of high-resolution features of the image and promises a significant increase in the speed with which future structural work can be accomplished."
https://openalex.org/W1493815818,"Autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor has been previously documented to activate the phosphotransferase activity of the receptor from 20- to 200-fold. Biochemical studies have correlated activation of the receptor kinase with the autophosphorylation of tyrosines residues 1158, 1162, and 1163. To further assess the role of these 3 tyrosines in the activation process, we have studied the effect of their substitution with either the neutral amino acids phenylalanine or alanine or with the negatively charged amino acids aspartate and glutamate. In several other proteins, it has been shown that substitution of phosphorylated residues with negatively charged amino acids can mimic the phosphorylation state of the protein. In agreement with previous studies, tyrosines at positions 1162 and 1163 were found to be crucial in the kinase activation process. In contrast, mutant receptors with tyrosine 1158 changed to either phenylalanine or aspartate were still activated to the same extent as the wild-type receptor. An increased basal exogenous kinase activity was observed upon replacement of tyrosines 1162 and 1163 with, in increasing order of potency, aspartate = glutamate less than alanine = phenylalanine. These results indicate that phosphorylation of tyrosines 1162/1163 but not 1158 play a critical role in the activation of the receptor kinase and that the mechanism of activation of the receptor kinase by autophosphorylation is more complex than just an introduction of a cluster of negative charges in this region of the receptor. In addition, the finding of an increased basal kinase activity in receptors lacking tyrosines 1162 and 1163 could explain the reported ability of this receptor to mediate certain biological responses."
https://openalex.org/W1589738157,"Thrombin is believed to activate platelets via cell surface receptors coupled to G proteins. In order to better understand this process, we have examined the interaction of thrombin with HEL cells, a leukemic cell line that has served as a useful model for studies of platelet structure and function. In HEL cells, as in platelets, thrombin stimulated inositol trisphosphate (IP3) formation and suppressed cAMP synthesis. Both events were inhibited by pertussis toxin with 50% inhibition occurring at a toxin concentration that ADP-ribosylated 50% of the Gi alpha subunits present in HEL cells. IP3 formation was also stimulated by a second serine protease, trypsin. The trypsin response was identical to the thrombin response in time course, magnitude, and pertussis toxin sensitivity, suggesting that a similar mechanism is involved. Agonist-induced changes in the cytosolic-free Ca2+ concentration were used to test this hypothesis. Both proteases caused a transient increase in intracellular calcium [Ca2+]i that could be inhibited with D-phenylalanyl-L-prolyl-L-arginine chloromethyl ketone thrombin. Exposure to either protease desensitized HEL cells against subsequent increases in [Ca2+]i and IP3 caused by the other, although responses to other agonists were retained. This loss of responsiveness persisted despite repeated washing of the cells and the addition of hirudin. Complete recovery occurred after 20 h and could be prevented with cycloheximide. These observations suggest that 1) HEL cell thrombin receptors, like those on platelets, are coupled to phospholipase C and adenylylcyclase by pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins, 2) the G proteins involved are equally accessible to pertussis toxin in situ, 3) when access is limited to the outside of the cell the response mechanisms for thrombin and trypsin are similar, if not identical, despite the broader substrate specificity of trypsin, 4) both proteases cause persistent changes that may involve proteolysis of their receptors or associated proteins, and 5) desensitization of the thrombin response occurs at a step no later than the activation of phospholipase C and requires protein synthesis for recovery."
https://openalex.org/W1518314315,"Down-regulation or adaptation of receptors is an essential part of the chemotaxis mechanism to sense gradients. Using localized mutagenesis it is shown that the covalent modification of the receptors makes a slight change in the binding constant (factor of 2) which is far too small to explain the adaptation. The modification does, however, alter the signaling dramatically, an increasing tumbling signal being correlated with increased covalent modification. Responses in the two extreme cases, namely, completely unmodified and completely modified receptor, occur at attractant concentrations separated by 2 orders of magnitude. Amidation of the regulatory glutamate residues causes essentially the same signaling change as methylation. Thus, adaptation in chemotaxis is due to modulation of the receptor's signaling properties, not its affinity for the chemoeffector."
https://openalex.org/W1526692496,"Using MA-10 Leydig tumor cells as a model system we have examined the possibility that the lutropin/choriogonadotropin (LH/CG)-induced down-regulation of the LH/CG receptor is accompanied by changes in LH/CG receptor mRNA. We show that LH or CG are indeed capable of reducing the levels of LH/CG receptor mRNA, but that the time course and magnitude of the reduction in receptor mRNA are such that this phenomenon cannot account entirely for the down-regulation of the receptor. In fact, we estimate that LH/CG can reduce the number of LH/CG receptors by at least 80% with little or no change in the levels of LH/CG receptor mRNA. These data are consistent with our previous hypothesis that the LH/CG-induced down-regulation of the LH/CG receptor is primarily due to an increase in the rate of degradation of the receptor that occurs as a result of the receptor-mediated endocytosis of LH/CG. Our studies also show that the LH/CG-induced down-regulation of the LH/CG receptor mRNA is mediated by cAMP. Thus, addition of 8-bromo-cAMP to MA-10 cells leads to a similar reduction in the levels of LH/CG receptor and receptor mRNA; while deglycosylated human CG, a hormone derivative that binds to the LH/CG receptor but has a reduced ability to stimulate cAMP synthesis, does not reduce the levels of LH/CG receptor mRNA. Last, human CG or 8-bromo-cAMP are unable to reduce LH/Cg receptor mRNA in a mutant MA-10 cell line that express a cAMP-resistant phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W1569192453,"The mechanism of DNA damage by hydrazine in the presence of metal ions was investigated by DNA sequencing technique and ESR-spin trapping method. Hydrazine caused DNA damage in the presence of Mn(III), Mn(II), Cu(II), Co(II), and Fe(III). The order of inducing effect on hydrazine-dependent DNA damage (Mn(III) greater than Mn(II) approximately Cu(II) much greater than Co(II) approximately Fe(III)) was related to that of the accelerating effect on the O2 consumption rate of hydrazine autoxidation. DNA damage by hydrazine plus Mn(II) or Mn(III) was inhibited by hydroxyl radical scavengers and superoxide dismutase, but not by catalase. On the other hand, bathocuproine and catalase completely inhibited DNA damage by hydrazine plus Cu(II), whereas hydroxyl radical scavengers and superoxide dismutase did not. Hydrazine plus Mn(II) or Mn(III) caused cleavage at every nucleotide with a little weaker cleavage at adenine residues, whereas hydrazine plus Cu(II) induced piperidine-labile sites frequently at thymine residues, especially of the GTC sequence. ESR-spin trapping experiments showed that hydroxyl radical is generated during the Mn(III)-catalyzed autoxidation of hydrazine, whereas hydrogen atom adducts of spin trapping reagents are generated during Cu(II)-catalyzed autoxidation. The results suggest that hydrazine plus Mn(II) or Mn(III) generate hydroxyl free radical not via H2O2 and that this hydroxyl free radical causes DNA damage. A possibility that the hydrogen atom releasing compound participates in hydrazine plus Cu(II)-induced DNA damage is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1528445946,"Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) stimulates proliferation of chondrocytes and their extracellular matrix synthesis but inhibits terminal differentiation to hypertrophic cells (Kato, Y., and Iwamoto, M., (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 5903-5909). In the present study, we examined changes in bFGF binding during chondrocyte cytodifferentiation. In cultures of pelleted growth plate chondrocytes, binding of 125I-bFGF to 140-kDa receptors was observed during the mitotic and matrix-forming stages but decreased to a very low level as chondrocytes became hypertrophic. Scatchard plot analysis showed that the decrease in binding of bFGF was due to a decrease in the number not in the affinity of the receptor. The loss of bFGF receptor was associated with a decrease in biological responses to bFGF. On the other hand, the binding of transforming growth factor-beta and epidermal growth factor was constant throughout all stages of growth plate chondrocytes. A rapid decrease in bFGF binding was not observed with articular chondrocytes or bFGF-exposed growth plate chondrocytes, perhaps because they scarcely underwent terminal differentiation. A decrease in bFGF binding associated with terminal differentiation in situ was also demonstrated by examination of sequential slices of growth plates. These observations suggest that rapid reduction in bFGF receptor is a special event during terminal differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1499822666,"Abstract The regulation by cAMP of cholesteryl ester hydrolysis and net depletion of cellular cholesteryl ester (cholesteryl ester clearance) in J774 murine macrophages was explored. Using Sandoz 58035 to selectively inhibit acyl CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase, we showed that the absolute rate of cholesteryl ester hydrolysis was stimulated 2-fold in J774 cells by the cAMP analogues 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate and dibutyryl-cAMP. The rate of hydrolysis was also stimulated by prostaglandin E1, by cholera toxin, and by a mixture of forskolin and isobutylmethylxanthine, but was not affected by epinephrine or dibutyryl-cGMP. These data demonstrate that cholesteryl ester hydrolysis in J774 cells can be stimulated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Cholesteryl ester clearance from J774 cells was achieved upon incubation with high density lipoproteins (HDL) plus CPT-cAMP but not with HDL alone. HDL-mediated cholesteryl ester clearance was dependent on the concentration of both HDL and CPT-cAMP. The data suggest that the defect responsible for the lack of HDL-mediated cholesteryl ester clearance in J774 cells involves a failure to modulate cAMP levels."
https://openalex.org/W1588776538,"Absorption and EPR spectroscopic properties of purified dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) reductase from Rhodobacter sphaeroides f. sp. denitrificans have been examined. The absence of prosthetic groups other than the molybdenum center in the enzyme has made it possible to study its absorption properties. The enzyme displays multiple absorbance peaks in both the oxidized and the dithionite-reduced forms. The oxidized enzyme has absorbance peaks at 280, 350, 470, 550, and 720 nm while the dithionite-reduced enzyme has peaks at 280, 374, and 645 nm with a shoulder at 430 nm. A comparison of the absorbance spectrum of oxidized Me2SO reductase with that of the molybdenum fragment of rat liver sulfite oxidase shows that the 350 and 470 peaks are common to both proteins. EPR studies of the Mo(V) form of Me2SO reductase show a rhombic signal with g1 = 1.988, g2 = 1.977, g3 = 1.961, and g(ave) = 1.975. The signal shows evidence of coupling to an exchangeable proton with A1 = 1.05, A2 = 1.13, A3 = 0.98, and Aave = 1.05 millitesla. These parameters are similar to those of other Mo enzymes, however, the epr signal of this enzyme differs from those of other Mo hydroxylases in showing only a slight sensitivity to pH and no detectable anion effect. EPR potentiometric titrations of Me2SO reductase gave midpoint potentials of +144 mV for the Mo(VI)/Mo(V) couple and +160 mV for the Mo(V)/Mo(IV) couple at room temperature and +141 mV for the Mo(VI)/Mo(V) couple and +200 mV for the Mo(V)/Mo(IV) couple at 173 K."
https://openalex.org/W1975450638,"Tn10 transposes by a nonreplicative ""cut and paste"" mechanism. We describe here two protein-DNA complexes that are reaction intermediates in the Tn10 transposition process: a cleaved donor complex whose DNA component consists of transposon sequences cleanly excised from flanking donor DNA, and a strand transfer complex whose DNA component contains transposon termini specifically joined to a target site. The kinetic behavior of the first species suggests that it is an early intermediate in the transposition reaction. These two Tn10 complexes are closely analogous to complexes identified in the pathway for replicative ""cointegrate"" formation by bacteriophage Mu and thus represent intermediates that may be common to both nonreplicative and replicative transposition. These and other results suggest that the Tn10 and Mu reactions are fundamentally very similar despite their very different biological outcomes. The critical difference between the two reactions is the fate of the DNA strand that is not joined to target DNA."

https://openalex.org/W1598864448,"The postsynaptic glycine receptor purified from rat spinal cord is rapidly and specifically phosphorylated by protein kinase C. The target for phosphorylation is the strychnine-binding subunit of the receptor (molecular mass of approximately 48 kDa), which is phosphorylated on serine residues to a final stoichiometry of approximately 0.8 mol of phosphate/mol of subunit. The 48-kDa phosphoprotein was analyzed by proteolytic cleavage and peptide mapping in order to localize the site of phosphorylation within the receptor molecule. Examination of the 32P-labeled receptor fragments generated by digestion with N-chlorosuccinimide, cyanogen bromide, and endoproteinase lysine C and of the deduced amino acid sequence of the 48-kDa protein (Grenningloh, G., Rienitz, A., Schmitt, B., Methfessel, C., Zensen, M., Beyreuther, K., Gundelfinger, E. D., and Betz, H. (1987) Nature 328, 215-220) indicates that the phosphorylation site is located in a region corresponding to the major intracellular loop of the predicted structure of the glycine receptor subunit and suggests serine 391 as the phosphorylated residue. In fact, a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 384-392 of the 48-kDa subunit was specifically phosphorylated by protein kinase C. Moreover, tryptic digests of this phosphopeptide and of the phosphorylated 48-kDa subunit of the glycine receptor migrated to the same position in two-dimensional peptide mapping. Furthermore, antibodies elicited against peptide 384-392 were shown to inhibit the protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation of the 48-kDa polypeptide. Interestingly, the relative position of the phosphorylated domain is similar to those known or proposed to be phosphorylated in other ligand-gated ion channel receptor subunits, thus suggesting further the existence of a homologous regulatory region in these receptor proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2133151289,"The human myeloid cell line MO7 requires either granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or interleukin 3 (IL-3) for proliferation. We have previously shown that both GM-CSF and IL-3 transiently induce tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of proteins, including two cytosolic proteins, p93 and p70, which are maximally phosphorylated 5-15 min after addition of growth factor to factor-deprived cells. GM-CSF-induced proliferation of MO7 cells was found to be inhibited by two activators of protein kinase C, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and bryostatin-1. PMA did not affect surface expression or affinity of the GM-CSF receptor but significantly inhibited GM-CSF- or IL-3-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p93 and p70. In contrast, PMA augmented GM-CSF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of another protein, p42. Pretreatment of cells with sodium orthovanadate to inhibit protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPase) partially reversed the inhibitory effects of PMA. These results suggest that one aspect of GM-CSF and IL-3 signal transduction, protein tyrosine phosphorylation, can be inhibited by a mechanism which does not involve receptor down-regulation, and may involve either receptor down-regulation, and may involve either inhibition of a receptor-activated tyrosine kinase, activation of a protein tyrosine phosphatase, or both. This mechanism could be important in exerting control of proliferation of some types of hematopoietic cells."
https://openalex.org/W1624887237,"A cAMP regulatory element (CRE) at nucleotide position -170 of the fibronectin gene was characterized previously (Dean, D. C., Blakeley, M. S., Newby, R. F., Ghazal, P., Hennighausen, L., and Bourgeois, S. (1989) Mol. Cell. Biol. 9, 1498-1506). Here we identify two additional low affinity CREs at nucleotide positions -260 and -415 which differ in sequence by 1 base pair. Interestingly, these CREs did not compete for binding of nuclear proteins in gel retardation assays and partial tryptic digestion of protein-DNA complexes produced a different pattern with each CRE, indicating that they bind different proteins. CRE (-170) competed for binding of proteins to both CREs, suggesting that it may represent a composite of the two elements. CRE (-415) competed effectively for binding of nuclear proteins to the somatostatin gene CRE, suggesting that, like the somatostatin CRE, it binds the nuclear protein CREB. On the other hand, CRE (-260) appears to bind the nuclear protein PEA-2, which also binds a site in the polyoma virus enhancer. In summary, disruption of dyad symmetry in the 3' region of the CRE, as occurs with CRE (-260) and CRE (-415), results in a lower affinity site and may also change the specificity for different nuclear proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1537868152,"There is abundant evidence implicating a role for intracellular pH (pHin) in the proliferative response of many cells to mitogenic agents. In mammalian cells, pHin is generally regulated by two systems: Na+/H+ exchange and HCO3- transport. Activation of Na+/H+ exchange is one of the earliest responses of mammalian cells to mitogens. In the absence of HCO3-, this activation raises the pHin. However, in the presence of HCO3-, the effect of mitogens on the pHin is unclear. HCO3- regulates pHin via mechanisms which can either acidify or alkalinize the cytosol, depending on the cell type and tissue of origin. BALB/c 3T3 mouse embryo cells are employed in the present study because they are used extensively in investigations of mammalian cell proliferation. Since these cells are of indefinite origin, there is no way to predict which HCO3- transporting system is operable in these cells and, hence, what effect HCO3- will have on the pHin and the response of pHin to mitogens. In the present article, we examine the mechanism and effect of HCO3(-)-based pHin regulation. Our results indicate that HCO3(-)-dependent pHin regulation in BALB/c 3T3 cells occurs via Na-HCO3/HCl exchange which raises pHin under physiological conditions. This activity can raise the pHin to above the set point of the activated Na+/H+ exchanger, consequently attenuating the mitogen-induced Na+/H+ exchange-mediated increases in pHin."
https://openalex.org/W1510204992,"Abstract We report that the rat pituitary cell line GH3 contains a Ca2(+)- and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase with properties characteristic of multifunctional Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaM kinase) from rat brain. The GH3 kinase exhibits the hallmark of authentic CaM kinase: conversion from Ca2(+)-dependent to Ca2(+)-independent activity following a brief initial phosphorylation in vitro. This phosphorylation occurs at a site which is similar or identical to that of the site of the rat brain enzyme and thus may be an autophosphorylation event. GH3 CaM kinase is phosphorylated and becomes Ca2(+)-independent in situ. Depolarization of intact cells with K+ opens calcium channels and leads to the phosphorylation of CaM kinase at the autonomy site, and the kinase becomes significantly and persistently Ca2(+)-independent. Treatment of cells with thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), which activates the phosphatidylinositol signaling pathway, also generates a Ca2(+)-independent CaM kinase in situ. The primary effect of TRH on CaM kinase activity is transient and correlates with the spike of Ca2+ released from intracellular stores and the rapid phase of prolactin release from GH3 cells. This study demonstrates that CaM kinase is able to detect and respond to both calcium that enters the cell through voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels and calcium released from internal stores via the phosphatidylinositol pathway. We find that TRH, a hormone that causes release of prolactin and was previously believed to activate primarily protein kinase C, also significantly activates CaM kinase in intact cells."
https://openalex.org/W1889390904,"In Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts a peptide mitogen bombesin, which acts through the phospholipase C-protein kinase C signaling pathway, stimulates DNA synthesis in a manner strictly dependent on the medium calcium concentration: [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA in the presence of a saturating concentration of bombesin (10(-8) M) is 4-fold greater at 3.0 mM extracellular calcium as compared with a value obtained at 0.03 mM calcium. In the present study we attempted to identify the site and the mechanism of action of Ca2+ influx along the bombesin-induced mitogenic signaling pathway, by comparing bombesin effects at 0.03 and 3.0 mM of medium calcium. Bombesin induces the same extent of increases in [3H]inositol phosphates after 1 min, and comparable sustained increases in the cellular content of 1,2-diacylglycerol for up to 4 h, at either 0.03 or 3.0 mM calcium. Bombesin induces the same extent of phosphorylation of MARCKS protein, the major cellular substrate for protein kinase C, irrespective of the medium calcium concentration for at least 4 h. Moreover, diverse cellular responses elicited by bombesin, including c-fos expression, activation of microtubule-associated protein 2 kinase and S6 kinase, glucose uptake, and protein synthesis but not the release of arachidonic acid and its metabolites, are induced similarly at either 0.03 or 3.0 mM calcium. Down-regulation of cellular protein kinase C nearly completely abolishes bombesin effects on c-fos expression, S6 kinase activation, glucose uptake, and DNA synthesis. These results suggest that the target of Ca2+ influx in bombesin-induced mitogenic signaling pathway is not located along the phospholipase C-protein kinase C signal transduction system including cellular events in early G1 phase that exist downstream to protein kinase C action."
https://openalex.org/W1532571296,"Abstract The phospholipase C-mediated hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine has been shown recently to be activated by a number of agonists. Muscarinic receptors, which trigger various signal transduction mechanisms including inhibition of adenylate cyclase through Gi, have been shown to be potent stimulants of this novel phospholipid degradative pathway. We demonstrate here, by exogenous addition of Bacillus cereus phosphatidylcholine-hydrolyzing phospholipase C, that phosphatidylcholine breakdown mimics the ability of carbachol to inhibit adenylate cyclase. This effect is sensitive to pertussis toxin and is entirely dependent on the presence of protein kinase C. This kinase is also required for the inhibition by carbachol of adenylate cyclase. These results suggest that the activation of phosphatidylcholine breakdown by phospholipase C may play an important role linking or favoring the coupling muscarinic receptors to Gi. Results presented here also show that phospholipase C-mediated hydrolysis of phosphoinositides by exogenous addition of Bacillus thuringiensis phosphoinositide-hydrolyzing phospholipase C does not affect adenylate cyclase, despite the fact that protein kinase C is translocated to an extent similar to that produced by the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine. According to the results shown here, both phospholipases also differ their ability to down-regulate protein kinase C as well as to phosphorylate p80 and to transmodulate the binding of epidermal growth factor, two well established effects of protein kinase C Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts. This emphasizes the complexity, from a functional point of view, of protein kinase C activation in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1541265147,"Addition of bovine serum albumin to state 4 mitochondria results in a depression of the proton leak and of the resting respiration of 70 and 25%, respectively. The conductance membrane potential diagram, both in the ohmic and in the non-ohmic region, shows that in the presence of bovine serum albumin the level of ohmic conductance is lowered while that of non-ohmic conductance is increased toward higher delta psi values. The same effect is observed during operation of the different proton pumps. Addition of chloroform affects the conductance membrane potential diagram in the following manner: there is no effect in the ohmic region with all pumps, while there is an effect in the non-ohmic region either at site III or at sites II plus III but not at site II. This suggests a possible effect of chloroform at the level of the cytochrome oxidase proton pump. During titration with oligomycin of the ATPase proton pump the conductance potential diagram shows a region of non-ohmicity only in the presence but not in the absence of an ATP-regenerating system. Protonophoric uncouplers such as carbonyl cyanide p(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone and intrinsic uncouplers such as chloroform have different effects on the relationship between rates of charge translocation and of oxygen consumption, and thus on the pump stoichiometries, in that the slope of the diagram is modified by the latter but not by the former. The differential effects of protonophores and of intrinsic uncouplers on the stoichiometries have been analyzed by computer simulations and represent an additional criterion to distinguish between extrinsic and intrinsic mechanisms of uncoupling."
https://openalex.org/W1541691802,"The hormonal control of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase gene expression was studied in the rat hepatoma cells, FTO-2B. In contrast to another hepatoma cell line (HTC), the enzyme in FTO-2B cells displays both kinase and bisphosphatase activities. As in rat liver, the mRNA in FTO-2B cells is 2.2-kilobases in length. However, the 5' region of the mRNA differs from the mRNA in the liver in that it contains sequences unique to 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase mRNA from skeletal muscle. These results suggest that the mRNA in FTO-2B cells may represent an additional alternative splicing product of the 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase gene. Exposure of FTO-2B cells to media containing either insulin (10(-7) M) or dexamethasone (10(-6) M) induced about a 10-fold increase in the level of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase mRNA within 6-10 h of hormone treatment. The concentrations of insulin or dexamethasone giving half-maximal stimulation were 10(-9) M and 2 x 10(-8) M, respectively, and dibutyryl cyclic AMP (5 x 10(-7) M) completely prevented the increase in enzyme mRNA induced by these hormones. Exposure of cells to glucose-free medium abolished the insulin-mediated enhancement in 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase mRNA, but not that induced by dexamethasone. No alteration in the degradation rate of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase mRNA was noted when cells were treated with insulin. Run-on transcription assays with isolated nuclei showed an increase in the relative transcription rate of the gene in cells treated with either insulin or dexamethasone. The time course of transcription activation preceded the increase in the level of the mRNA, indicating that the main mechanism for the induction of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase expression by insulin and dexamethasone is mediated by stimulation of gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1929773167,"The effect of autophosphorylation on the tyrosine kinase activity of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is not well understood. We previously demonstrated that phospholipase C-gamma physically associates with the EGF-activated EGFR, but not with a kinase-negative mutant of the EGFR, and, moreover, that only the tyrosine-phosphorylated EGFR is able to associate with phospholipase C-gamma. We have now investigated the effect of autophosphorylation on the tyrosine kinase activity of the EGFR by employing the purified kinase-active intracellular domain of the EGFR (EGFR-IC) produced by a baculovirus expression system. Synthetic peptides, including ones which contain the individual major tyrosine phosphorylation sites of phospholipase C-gamma, were used as substrates. We found that the extensively prephosphorylated EGFR-IC exhibited similar reaction kinetics to the unphosphorylated EGFR-IC when angiotensin II was used as a nonspecific substrate. In contrast there was a clear stimulation of kinase activity due to autophosphorylation of the EGFR-IC when peptides representing either the major autophosphorylation site of the EGFR or the EGFR phosphorylation sites of phospholipase C-gamma were used as substrates. However, the modes of stimulation for these peptides differed. The binding affinity (Km) for the unphosphorylated EGFR-IC for the peptide containing Tyr-771 of phospholipase C-gamma was relatively poor compared with other peptides, but improved 5-6-fold when the EGFR-IC was prephosphorylated. On the other hand, autophosphorylation improved the reaction velocity (Vm) of the phosphorylation of other peptides by 2-3-fold, with little or no increase in affinity. These results suggest that autophosphorylation of the EGFR may induce a conformational change of its kinase domain which enhances its kinase activity with exogenous substrates and may induce association with phospholipase C-gamma by increasing its affinity to a domain containing Tyr-771."
https://openalex.org/W1481406023,"In human and mouse cell lines, expression of exogenous genes was enhanced by treatment with 2-aminopurine (2-AP). Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) and neomycin phosphotransferase activities were increased by up to 50-fold upon 2-AP treatment of cells permanently transfected with genes encoding these enzymes. Neomycin phosphotransferase activity was also increased by this treatment in cells infected with a retroviral vector carrying the neomycin phosphotransferase gene. 2-AP-mediated increase in CAT activity was observed in various cell lines which had been permanently transfected with chimeric CAT genes containing transcriptional regulatory elements of the interferon-inducible genes 6-16 and 561, SV40 early genes, mouse mammary tumor viral gene, or metallothionein II gene. The increase in the cellular CAT enzymatic activity was due to an elevated level of CAT protein. The 2-AP-mediated enhancement of CAT expression was operative at the translational level; the rate of transcription of CAT mRNA or its steady-state level was affected only marginally. The translational up-regulation by 2-AP was restricted to the genes introduced from outside; there was no gross change in the rate of synthesis of other cellular proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1501427854,"In ferritin, iron is stored by oxidative deposition of the ferrous ion to form a hydrous ferric oxide mineral core. Two intermediates, formed during the initial stages of iron accumulation in apoferritin, have been observed previously in our laboratory and have been identified as a mononuclear Fe3(+)-protein complex and a mixed-valence Fe2(+)-Fe3(+)-protein complex. The physical characteristics of the mixed-valence Fe2(+)-Fe3+ complex and its relationship to the mononuclear Fe3+ complex in horse spleen apoferritin samples to which 0-240 iron atoms were added was examined by EPR spectroscopy. The results indicate that the mononuclear complex is not a precursor to the formation of the mixed-valence complex. Competitive binding studies with Cd2+, Zn2+, Tb3+, and UO2+(2) suggest that the mixed-valence complex is formed on the interior of the protein in the vicinity of the 2-fold axis of the subunit dimer. The mixed-valence complex could be generated by the partial oxidation of Fe2+ in apoferritin containing 120 Fe2+ or by the addition of up to 120 Fe2+ to ferritin already containing 18 Fe3+/protein molecule. The fact that the complex is generated during early Fe2+ oxidation suggests that it may be a key intermediate during the initial oxidative deposition of iron in the protein. The unusual EPR powder lineshape at 9.3 GHz of the mixed-valence complex was simulated with a rhombic g-tensor (gx = 1.95, gy = 1.88, gz = 1.77) and large linewidths and g-strain parameters. The presence of significant g-strain in the complex probably accounts for the failure to observe an EPR signal at 35 GHz and likely reflect considerable flexibility in the structure of the metal site. The temperature dependence of the EPR intensity in the range 8-38 K was modeled successfully by an effective spin Hamiltonian including exchange coupling (-2JS1.S2) and zero-field terms, from which an antiferromagnetic coupling of J = -4.0 +/- 0.5 cm-1 was obtained. This low value for J may reflect the presence of a mu-oxo bridge(s) in the dimer."
https://openalex.org/W1555861554,"With the aim to produce insulin-like growth factors (IGF) with enhanced specificity for the type 1 or type 2 IGF receptors, three mutants of IGF II have been prepared and expressed in NIH-3T3 cells. IGF II mutated at Tyr27 to Leu and Glu showed a 25- and 54-fold decrease in affinity for the type 1 IGF receptor and a 3.4- and 9.2-fold decrease in affinity for the type 2 IGF receptor. IGF II mutated at Phe48 to Glu showed a 18-fold decrease in affinity for the type 2 IGF receptor and a 2.8-fold decrease in affinity for the type 1 IGF receptor. These affinities were measured in radioreceptor assays using type 1 or 2 IGF receptor overexpressing cells. Data obtained on receptor cross-linking and thymidine incorporation assays confirmed the results of the radioreceptor assays. It is concluded that mutations of Tyr27 preferentially decrease binding to the type 1 IGF receptor and of Phe48 to the type 2 IGF receptor, either by the loss of a residue involved in receptor binding or by preferentially destabilizing the region involved in receptor binding."

Seven enzyme preparations treated by various methods are also analyzed to investigate the nature of Cux. It is shown that Cux is removable by either monomerization of the enzyme or subunit III depletion. This result suggests that Cux is associated with subunit III and that it plays a structural role in enzyme dimerization. EPR measurements indicate that Cux is heterogeneous and mostly reduced. In addition, we find Cux has no effect on the spectroscopic properties and electron transfer activity of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1947889127,"The electrophoretic behavior of Thiocapsa roseopersicina hydrogenase on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels demonstrates that the protein exists in two active forms, A1 and A2, which may be interconverted. Each of these forms has a characteristic electrophoretic mobility and differs in its sensitivity to O2. Form A1 is O2-labile and converts to A2 under O2. Form A2 is less sensitive to O2 and may be converted into A1 under H2 atmosphere. Both active forms are present in aerobically isolated samples. Because the proteins are still active on 15% sodium dodecyl sulfate gels, they are not completely denatured, and the apparent molecular masses do not necessarily represent the true molecular masses of the enzymes. A1 has an Rf = 0.19, corresponding to an apparent molecular mass of 90 kDa, and A2 has an Rf = 0.35, corresponding to an apparent molecular mass of 49 kDa. A sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation study of the active enzyme shows that the holoenzyme has a molecular mass of 98 kDa. Form A2 may be separated into two subunits of molecular mass of 64 kDa and 34 kDa, respectively. Thus, form A2 represents the holoenzyme with a true molecular mass of 98 kDa. Amino acid compositions and N-terminal amino acid sequences of the A2 protein and these subunits are consistent with a heterodimeric holoenzyme. The relationship between the conformational changes detected in this study and a three-state scheme proposed on the basis of EPR spectroscopic studies of the metal-containing cofactors present in the enzyme is also discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1598528678,"The regulation of ornithine delta-aminotransferase (OAT) expression is poorly characterized in humans, but in rat there are tissue-specific responses to nutritional and hormonal stimuli. We analyzed 1.3 kilobases of 5'-flanking sequence and part of intron 1 of the human OAT gene and found several candidate regulatory sequences including four copies of a motif also present in the promoters of three other urea cycle-related enzymes (urea cycle element). We transfected a series of promoter deletion constructs into HepG2 (human hepatoma), H4 (rat hepatoma), and HEK (human embryonic kidney) cells and obtained maximal expression with 134 base pairs (bp) of 5'-flanking DNA. One of the urea cycle elements and the 3' end of exon 1 had positive effects on expression in all cell lines. However, mutations in a 22-bp element which overlaps the transcriptional start site decreased activity 4-fold in H4 cells only. cAMP increased endogenous OAT mRNA 4-fold in HepG2 cells and the expression of constructs containing as little as -85 bp of 5'-flanking DNA 2- 5-fold in HepG2 and H4 cells. DNase I protection analysis of the first 134 bp of 5'-flanking sequence with nuclear extracts from rat liver, rat kidney, HEK, and HepG2 cells showed two patterns of protection over one of the urea cycle elements.

https://openalex.org/W2141679273,"Expression of a transforming Ha-ras gene in NIH 3T3 cells transfected with an inducible Ha-ras construct leads to a rapid desensitization of the intracellular Ca2(+)-mobilizing system to bombesin and serum growth factors. Half-maximal depression of the Ca2+ response is observed 2 h after induction of p21ras. A maximum is obtained after 6 h. Bombesin-induced elevation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate formation is also depressed in cells expressing Ha-ras. This, however, is a relatively late phenomenon and not yet detectable when maximal depression of the Ca2+ signal is observed. We conclude that the rapid densensitization of the Ca2(+)-releasing system to bombesin by Ha-ras is not caused by down-modulation or uncoupling of phospholipase C-coupled bombesin receptors. The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-mediated release of intracellular Ca2+ is reduced in permeabilized cells expressing the Ha-ras oncogene. A depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores by Ha-ras is unlikely since (i) the Ha-ras-induced growth factor-independent stimulation of inositol phosphate formation occurs several hours after reduction of the Ca2+ response and (ii) the Ca2+ load of intracellular nonmitochondrial Ca2+ stores was found to be unaffected by Ha-ras. We conclude that the desensitization of the Ca2(+)-mobilizing system is caused either by partial inhibition of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-regulated Ca2+ channels or by interference of Ha-ras with Ca2+ translocation between intracellular Ca2+ compartments."
https://openalex.org/W1714264883,"Glycerophosphoinositol (GroPIns) is a major inositol phosphate in many cell types. In this study we have determined the optimal conditions (pH 8.0 and 0.5 mM MnCl2) for the metabolism of this molecule in an extract from human placenta, and we show that the major product is inositol (1)-phosphate (Ins(1)P). The enzyme activity that catalyzes this reaction is contained in the same protein designated previously as inositol-(1,2)-cyclic-phosphate 2-inositolphosphohydrolase (cyclic hydrolase), a phosphodiesterase that catalyzes the conversion of inositol-(1,2)-cyclic phosphate (cIns(1,2)P) to Ins(1)P. In addition, the enzyme also catalyzes the production of Ins(1)P from inositol (1)-methylphosphate. All of these substrates, (cIns(1,2)P, GroPIns, and inositol (1)-methylphosphate), contain a phosphodiester bond at the 1-position of the inositol ring. Additional phosphate groups on the 4- or 5-positions of the inositol ring prevent hydrolysis by cyclic hydrolase. The Km of the enzyme for GroPIns is 0.67 mM, and the Vm is 5 mumol/min/mg of protein. GroPIns competitively inhibits cIns(1,2)P hydrolysis with a Ki equal to its Km as a substrate. Hydrolysis of GroPIns and cIns(1,2)P is stimulated by MnCl2, phosphatidylserine, and [ethylenebis(oxyethylenenitrilo)]tetraacetic acid (EGTA). However, whereas cIns(1,2)P hydrolysis is increased 5-8-fold by phosphatidylserine and EGTA only a 2-fold increase of GroPIns hydrolysis occurs under the same conditions. Hydrolysis of both GroPIns and cIns(1,2)P is inhibited by Ins(2)P; the ID50 values are 12 and 1 microM, respectively. There are significant quantities of GroPIns and Ins(2)P in 3T3 cells, indicating that these compounds that alter cIns(1,2)P hydrolase activity may modulate intracellular levels of cIns(1,2)P. Finally, we present evidence suggesting that the substrate specificity of this enzyme is altered during cell transformation."
