https://openalex.org/W2797506253,"Investigations of two-dimensional transition-metal chalcogenides (TMCs) have recently revealed interesting physical phenomena, including the quantum spin Hall effect1,2, valley polarization3,4 and two-dimensional superconductivity5, suggesting potential applications for functional devices6–10. However, of the numerous compounds available, only a handful, such as Mo- and W-based TMCs, have been synthesized, typically via sulfurization11–15, selenization16,17 and tellurization18 of metals and metal compounds. Many TMCs are difficult to produce because of the high melting points of their metal and metal oxide precursors. Molten-salt-assisted methods have been used to produce ceramic powders at relatively low temperature19 and this approach20 was recently employed to facilitate the growth of monolayer WS2 and WSe2. Here we demonstrate that molten-salt-assisted chemical vapour deposition can be broadly applied for the synthesis of a wide variety of two-dimensional (atomically thin) TMCs. We synthesized 47 compounds, including 32 binary compounds (based on the transition metals Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Mo, W, Re, Pt, Pd and Fe), 13 alloys (including 11 ternary, one quaternary and one quinary), and two heterostructured compounds. We elaborate how the salt decreases the melting point of the reactants and facilitates the formation of intermediate products, increasing the overall reaction rate. Most of the synthesized materials in our library are useful, as supported by evidence of superconductivity in our monolayer NbSe2 and MoTe2 samples21,22 and of high mobilities in MoS2 and ReS2. Although the quality of some of the materials still requires development, our work opens up opportunities for studying the properties and potential application of a wide variety of two-dimensional TMCs. Molten-salt-assisted chemical vapour deposition is used to synthesize a wide variety of two-dimensional transition-metal chalcogenides."
https://openalex.org/W2796944804,"Global warming is rapidly emerging as a universal threat to ecological integrity and function, highlighting the urgent need for a better understanding of the impact of heat exposure on the resilience of ecosystems and the people who depend on them 1 . Here we show that in the aftermath of the record-breaking marine heatwave on the Great Barrier Reef in 2016 2 , corals began to die immediately on reefs where the accumulated heat exposure exceeded a critical threshold of degree heating weeks, which was 3-4 °C-weeks. After eight months, an exposure of 6 °C-weeks or more drove an unprecedented, regional-scale shift in the composition of coral assemblages, reflecting markedly divergent responses to heat stress by different taxa. Fast-growing staghorn and tabular corals suffered a catastrophic die-off, transforming the three-dimensionality and ecological functioning of 29% of the 3,863 reefs comprising the world's largest coral reef system. Our study bridges the gap between the theory and practice of assessing the risk of ecosystem collapse, under the emerging framework for the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Ecosystems 3 , by rigorously defining both the initial and collapsed states, identifying the major driver of change, and establishing quantitative collapse thresholds. The increasing prevalence of post-bleaching mass mortality of corals represents a radical shift in the disturbance regimes of tropical reefs, both adding to and far exceeding the influence of recurrent cyclones and other local pulse events, presenting a fundamental challenge to the long-term future of these iconic ecosystems."

https://openalex.org/W2797665619,"Liver transplantation is a highly successful treatment, but is severely limited by the shortage in donor organs. However, many potential donor organs cannot be used; this is because sub-optimal livers do not tolerate conventional cold storage and there is no reliable way to assess organ viability preoperatively. Normothermic machine perfusion maintains the liver in a physiological state, avoids cooling and allows recovery and functional testing. Here we show that, in a randomized trial with 220 liver transplantations, compared to conventional static cold storage, normothermic preservation is associated with a 50% lower level of graft injury, measured by hepatocellular enzyme release, despite a 50% lower rate of organ discard and a 54% longer mean preservation time. There was no significant difference in bile duct complications, graft survival or survival of the patient. If translated to clinical practice, these results would have a major impact on liver transplant outcomes and waiting list mortality. Normothermic machine perfusion of the liver improved early graft function, demonstrated by reduced peak serum aspartate transaminase levels and early allograft dysfunction rates, and improved organ utilization and preservation times, although no differences were seen in graft or patient survival."

https://openalex.org/W2797501353,"Electronic and photonic technologies have transformed our lives-from computing and mobile devices, to information technology and the internet. Our future demands in these fields require innovation in each technology separately, but also depend on our ability to harness their complementary physics through integrated solutions1,2. This goal is hindered by the fact that most silicon nanotechnologies-which enable our processors, computer memory, communications chips and image sensors-rely on bulk silicon substrates, a cost-effective solution with an abundant supply chain, but with substantial limitations for the integration of photonic functions. Here we introduce photonics into bulk silicon complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) chips using a layer of polycrystalline silicon deposited on silicon oxide (glass) islands fabricated alongside transistors. We use this single deposited layer to realize optical waveguides and resonators, high-speed optical modulators and sensitive avalanche photodetectors. We integrated this photonic platform with a 65-nanometre-transistor bulk CMOS process technology inside a 300-millimetre-diameter-wafer microelectronics foundry. We then implemented integrated high-speed optical transceivers in this platform that operate at ten gigabits per second, composed of millions of transistors, and arrayed on a single optical bus for wavelength division multiplexing, to address the demand for high-bandwidth optical interconnects in data centres and high-performance computing3,4. By decoupling the formation of photonic devices from that of transistors, this integration approach can achieve many of the goals of multi-chip solutions 5 , but with the performance, complexity and scalability of 'systems on a chip'1,6-8. As transistors smaller than ten nanometres across become commercially available 9 , and as new nanotechnologies emerge10,11, this approach could provide a way to integrate photonics with state-of-the-art nanoelectronics."
https://openalex.org/W2801900613,"Felsenstein’s application of the bootstrap method to evolutionary trees is one of the most cited scientific papers of all time. The bootstrap method, which is based on resampling and replications, is used extensively to assess the robustness of phylogenetic inferences. However, increasing numbers of sequences are now available for a wide variety of species, and phylogenies based on hundreds or thousands of taxa are becoming routine. With phylogenies of this size Felsenstein’s bootstrap tends to yield very low supports, especially on deep branches. Here we propose a new version of the phylogenetic bootstrap in which the presence of inferred branches in replications is measured using a gradual ‘transfer’ distance rather than the binary presence or absence index used in Felsenstein’s original version. The resulting supports are higher and do not induce falsely supported branches. The application of our method to large mammal, HIV and simulated datasets reveals their phylogenetic signals, whereas Felsenstein’s bootstrap fails to do so. A new version of the phylogenetic bootstrap method enables assessment of the robustness of phylogenies that are based on large datasets of hundreds or thousands of taxa."
https://openalex.org/W2797967513,"Metabolic regulation has been recognized as a powerful principle guiding immune responses. Inflammatory macrophages undergo extensive metabolic rewiring 1 marked by the production of substantial amounts of itaconate, which has recently been described as an immunoregulatory metabolite 2 . Itaconate and its membrane-permeable derivative dimethyl itaconate (DI) selectively inhibit a subset of cytokines 2 , including IL-6 and IL-12 but not TNF. The major effects of itaconate on cellular metabolism during macrophage activation have been attributed to the inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase2,3, yet this inhibition alone is not sufficient to account for the pronounced immunoregulatory effects observed in the case of DI. Furthermore, the regulatory pathway responsible for such selective effects of itaconate and DI on the inflammatory program has not been defined. Here we show that itaconate and DI induce electrophilic stress, react with glutathione and subsequently induce both Nrf2 (also known as NFE2L2)-dependent and -independent responses. We find that electrophilic stress can selectively regulate secondary, but not primary, transcriptional responses to toll-like receptor stimulation via inhibition of IκBζ protein induction. The regulation of IκBζ is independent of Nrf2, and we identify ATF3 as its key mediator. The inhibitory effect is conserved across species and cell types, and the in vivo administration of DI can ameliorate IL-17–IκBζ-driven skin pathology in a mouse model of psoriasis, highlighting the therapeutic potential of this regulatory pathway. Our results demonstrate that targeting the DI–IκBζ regulatory axis could be an important new strategy for the treatment of IL-17–IκBζ-mediated autoimmune diseases. The immunoregulatory metabolite itaconate and its dimethyl derivative induce electrophilic stress and react with glutathione to induce both Nrf2-dependent and Nrf2-independent responses, resulting in AF3-mediated inhibition of the inflammation-related protein IκBζ."
https://openalex.org/W2800255316,"SAMHD1 was previously characterized as a dNTPase that protects cells from viral infections. Mutations in SAMHD1 are implicated in cancer development and in a severe congenital inflammatory disease known as Aicardi–Goutières syndrome. The mechanism by which SAMHD1 protects against cancer and chronic inflammation is unknown. Here we show that SAMHD1 promotes degradation of nascent DNA at stalled replication forks in human cell lines by stimulating the exonuclease activity of MRE11. This function activates the ATR–CHK1 checkpoint and allows the forks to restart replication. In SAMHD1-depleted cells, single-stranded DNA fragments are released from stalled forks and accumulate in the cytosol, where they activate the cGAS–STING pathway to induce expression of pro-inflammatory type I interferons. SAMHD1 is thus an important player in the replication stress response, which prevents chronic inflammation by limiting the release of single-stranded DNA from stalled replication forks. SAMHD1 has an essential role in the replication stress response and prevents inflammation by activating the MRE11 nuclease to degrade nascent DNA strands at stalled replication forks, thus enabling replication."
https://openalex.org/W2797089588,"Leptin, a hormone produced in white adipose tissue, acts in the brain to communicate fuel status, suppress appetite following a meal, promote energy expenditure and maintain blood glucose stability1,2. Dysregulation of leptin or its receptors (LEPR) results in severe obesity and diabetes3-5. Although intensive studies on leptin have transformed obesity and diabetes research2,6, clinical applications of the molecule are still limited 7 , at least in part owing to the complexity and our incomplete understanding of the underlying neural circuits. The hypothalamic neurons that express agouti-related peptide (AGRP) and pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) have been hypothesized to be the main first-order, leptin-responsive neurons. Selective deletion of LEPR in these neurons with the Cre-loxP system, however, has previously failed to recapitulate, or only marginally recapitulated, the obesity and diabetes that are seen in LEPR-deficient Lepr db/db mice, suggesting that AGRP or POMC neurons are not directly required for the effects of leptin in vivo8-10. The primary neural targets of leptin are therefore still unclear. Here we conduct a systematic, unbiased survey of leptin-responsive neurons in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice and exploit CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genetic ablation of LEPR in vivo. Unexpectedly, we find that AGRP neurons but not POMC neurons are required for the primary action of leptin to regulate both energy balance and glucose homeostasis. Leptin deficiency disinhibits AGRP neurons, and chemogenetic inhibition of these neurons reverses both diabetic hyperphagia and hyperglycaemia. In sharp contrast to previous studies, we show that CRISPR-mediated deletion of LEPR in AGRP neurons causes severe obesity and diabetes, faithfully replicating the phenotype of Lepr db/db mice. We also uncover divergent mechanisms of acute and chronic inhibition of AGRP neurons by leptin (presynaptic potentiation of GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid) neurotransmission and postsynaptic activation of ATP-sensitive potassium channels, respectively). Our findings identify the underlying basis of the neurobiological effects of leptin and associated metabolic disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2797071919,"The NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor transduces the binding of glutamate and glycine, coupling it to the opening of a calcium-permeable ion channel 1 . Owing to the lack of high-resolution structural studies of the NMDA receptor, the mechanism by which ion-channel blockers occlude ion permeation is not well understood. Here we show that removal of the amino-terminal domains from the GluN1-GluN2B NMDA receptor yields a functional receptor and crystals with good diffraction properties, allowing us to map the binding site of the NMDA receptor blocker, MK-801. This crystal structure, together with long-timescale molecular dynamics simulations, shows how MK-801 and memantine (a drug approved for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease) bind within the vestibule of the ion channel, promote closure of the ion channel gate and lodge between the M3-helix-bundle crossing and the M2-pore loops, physically blocking ion permeation."
https://openalex.org/W2802089023,"Neuropeptide Y (NPY) receptors belong to the G-protein-coupled receptor superfamily and have important roles in food intake, anxiety and cancer biology 1,2 . The NPY-Y receptor system has emerged as one of the most complex networks with three peptide ligands (NPY, peptide YY and pancreatic polypeptide) binding to four receptors in most mammals, namely the Y1, Y2, Y4 and Y5 receptors, with different affinity and selectivity 3 . NPY is the most powerful stimulant of food intake and this effect is primarily mediated by the Y1 receptor (Y1R) 4 . A number of peptides and small-molecule compounds have been characterized as Y1R antagonists and have shown clinical potential in the treatment of obesity 4 , tumour 1 and bone loss 5 . However, their clinical usage has been hampered by low potency and selectivity, poor brain penetration ability or lack of oral bioavailability 6 . Here we report crystal structures of the human Y1R bound to the two selective antagonists UR-MK299 and BMS-193885 at 2.7 and 3.0 Å resolution, respectively. The structures combined with mutagenesis studies reveal the binding modes of Y1R to several structurally diverse antagonists and the determinants of ligand selectivity. The Y1R structure and molecular docking of the endogenous agonist NPY, together with nuclear magnetic resonance, photo-crosslinking and functional studies, provide insights into the binding behaviour of the agonist and for the first time, to our knowledge, determine the interaction of its N terminus with the receptor. These insights into Y1R can enable structure-based drug discovery that targets NPY receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2754818664,"The isotope $^{229}$Th is the only nucleus known to possess an excited state $^{229m}$Th in the energy range of a few electron volts, a transition energy typical for electrons in the valence shell of atoms, but about four orders of magnitude lower than common nuclear excitation energies. A number of applications of this unique nuclear system, which is accessible by optical methods, have been proposed. Most promising among them appears a highly precise nuclear clock that outperforms existing atomic timekeepers. Here we present the laser spectroscopic investigation of the hyperfine structure of $^{229m}$Th$^{2+}$, yielding values of fundamental nuclear properties, namely the magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moments as well as the nuclear charge radius. After the recent direct detection of this long-searched-for isomer, our results now provide detailed insight into its nuclear structure and present a method for its non-destructive optical detection."
https://openalex.org/W2802337201,"Wildlife attacks on humans and economic losses often result in reduced support of local communities for wildlife conservation. Information on spatial and temporal patterns of such losses in the highly affected areas contribute in designing and implementing effective mitigation measures. We analyzed the loss of humans, livestock and property caused by wildlife during 1998 to 2016, using victim family’s reports to Chitwan National Park authorities and Buffer Zone User Committees. A total of 4,014 incidents were recorded including attacks on humans, livestock depredation, property damage and crop raiding caused by 12 wildlife species. In total >400,000 US dollar was paid to the victim families as a relief over the whole period. Most of the attacks on humans were caused by rhino, sloth bear, tiger, elephant, wild boar and leopard. A significantly higher number of conflict incidents caused by rhino and elephant were observed during full moon periods. An increase in the wildlife population did not coincide with an equal rise in conflict incidents reported. Underprivileged ethnic communities were attacked by wildlife more frequently than expected. Number of attacks on humans by carnivores and herbivores did not differ significantly. An insignificant decreasing trend of wildlife attacks on humans and livestock was observed with significant variation over the years. Tiger and leopard caused >90% of livestock depredation. Tigers killed both large (cattle and buffalo) and medium sized (goat, sheep, pig) livestock but leopard mostly killed medium sized livestock. Most (87%) of the livestock killing during 2012–2016 occurred within the stall but close (<500m) to the forest edge. Both the percentage of households with livestock and average holding has decreased over the years in buffer zone. Decreased forest dependency as well as conflict mitigation measures (electric and mesh wire fences) have contributed to keep the conflict incidents in control. Strengthening mitigation measures like construction of electric or mesh wire fences and predator-proof livestock corrals along with educating local communities about wildlife behavior and timely management of problem animals (man-eater tiger, rage elephant etc.) will contribute to reduce the conflict."

https://openalex.org/W2800933165,"Our previous studies consistently demonstrate enhanced pulmonary vascular remodeling in HIV-infected intravenous drug users, and in simian immunodeficiency virus-infected macaques or HIV-transgenic rats exposed to opioids or cocaine. Although we reported an associated increase in perivascular inflammation, the exact role of inflammatory cells in the development of pulmonary vascular remodeling remains unknown. In this study, HIV-infected and cocaine (H+C)-treated human monocyte derived macrophages released a higher number of extracellular vesicles (EVs), compared to HIV-infected or uninfected cocaine-treated macrophages, with a significant increase in the particle size range to 100-150 nm. Treatment of primary human pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (HPASMCs) with these EVs resulted in a significant increase in smooth muscle proliferation. We also observed a significant increase in the miRNA-130a level in the EVs derived from H+C-treated macrophages that corresponded with the decrease in the expression of phosphatase and tensin homolog and tuberous sclerosis 1 and 2 and activation of PI3K/protein kinase B signaling in HPASMCs on addition of these EVs. Transfection of HPASMCs with antagomir-130a-ameliorated the EV-induced effect. Thus, we conclude that EVs derived from H+C-treated macrophages promote pulmonary smooth muscle proliferation by delivery of its prosurvival miRNA cargo, which may play a crucial role in the development of PAH.-Sharma, H., Chinnappan, M., Agarwal, S., Dalvi, P., Gunewardena, S., O'Brien-Ladner, A., Dhillon, N.

https://openalex.org/W2799822291,"Background It has been reported that higher plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D is associated with lower risk of type 2 diabetes. However the results to date have been mixed and no adequate data based on a cohort are available for the high end of the normal range, above approximately 32 ng/ml or 80 nmol/L. Methods We performed a cohort study of 903 adults who were known to be free of diabetes or pre-diabetes during a 1997–1999 visit to a NIH Lipid Research Centers clinic. Plasma 25(OH)D was measured at Visit 8 in 1977–1979. The mean age was 74 years. The visit also included fasting plasma glucose and oral glucose tolerance testing. Follow-up continued through 2009. Results There were 47 cases of diabetes and 337 cases of pre-diabetes. Higher 25(OH)D concentrations (> 30 ng/ml) were associated with lower hazard ratios (HR) for diabetes: 30–39 ng/ml or 75–98 nmol/L: HR = 0.31, 95% CI = 0.14–0.70; for 40–49 ng/ml or 100–122 nmol/L: HR = 0.29, CI = 0.12–0.68; for > 50 ng/ml or 125 nmol/L: HR = 0.19, CI = 0.06–0.56. All HRs are compared to < 30 ng/ml or 75 nmol/L. There was an inverse dose-response gradient between 25(OH)D concentration and risk of diabetes with a p for trend of 0.005. Each 10 ng/mL or 25 nmol/L higher 25(OH)D concentration was associated with a HR of 0.64, CI = 0.48–0.86. 25(OH)D concentrations were more weakly inversely associated with pre-diabetes risk, and the trend was not significant. Conclusion Further research is needed on whether high 25(OH)D might prevent type 2 diabetes or transition of prediabetes to diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2800628662,"Pathways of human epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors are activated upon ligand-dependent or -independent homo- or heterodimerization and their subsequent transphosphorylation. Overexpression of these receptors positively correlates with transphosphorylation rates and increased tumor growth rates. MEDI4276, an anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) biparatopic antibody–drug conjugate, has two paratopes within each antibody arm. One, 39S, is aiming at the HER2 site involved in receptor dimerization and the second, single chain fragment (scFv), mimicking trastuzumab. Here we present the cocrystal structure of the 39S Fab–HER2 complex and, along with biophysical and functional assays, determine the corresponding epitope of MEDI4276 and its underlying mechanism of action. Our results reveal that MEDI4276's uniqueness is based first on the ability of its 39S paratope to block HER2 homo- or heterodimerization and second on its ability to cluster the receptors on the surface of receptor-overexpressing cells."
https://openalex.org/W2796674913,"Enhancers for embryonic stem (ES) cell-expressed genes and lineage-determining factors are characterized by conventional marks of enhancer activation in ES cells1-3, but it remains unclear whether enhancers destined to regulate cell-type-restricted transcription units might also have distinct signatures in ES cells. Here we show that cell-type-restricted enhancers are 'premarked' and activated as transcription units by the binding of one or two ES cell transcription factors, although they do not exhibit traditional enhancer epigenetic marks in ES cells, thus uncovering the initial temporal origins of cell-type-restricted enhancers. This premarking is required for future cell-type-restricted enhancer activity in the differentiated cells, with the strength of the ES cell signature being functionally important for the subsequent robustness of cell-type-restricted enhancer activation. We have experimentally validated this model in macrophage-restricted enhancers and neural precursor cell (NPC)-restricted enhancers using ES cell-derived macrophages or NPCs, edited to contain specific ES cell transcription factor motif deletions. DNA hydroxyl-methylation of enhancers in ES cells, determined by ES cell transcription factors, may serve as a potential molecular memory for subsequent enhancer activation in mature macrophages. These findings suggest that the massive repertoire of cell-type-restricted enhancers are essentially hierarchically and obligatorily premarked by binding of a defining ES cell transcription factor in ES cells, dictating the robustness of enhancer activation in mature cells."

We mapped the mutual binding sites to the N-terminal region of lactoferrin, encompassed also in the bioactive peptide lactoferricin, and kringle 5 of plasminogen. Finally, lactoferrin blocked tumor cell invasion in vitro and also plasminogen activation driven by Borrelia.

https://openalex.org/W2799964946,"Emerging evidence suggests that structural brain abnormalities may play a role in the pathophysiology of melancholic depression. We set out to test whether diffusion-derived estimates of white matter structure were disrupted in melancholia in regions underpinning psychomotor function. We hypothesized that those with melancholia (and evidencing impaired psychomotor function) would show disrupted white matter organization in internal capsule subdivisions. Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) data were acquired from 22 melancholic depressed, 23 non-melancholic depressed, and 29 healthy control participants. Voxel-wise fractional anisotropy (FA), radial diffusivity (RD), and axial diffusivity (AD) values were derived for anterior, posterior, and retrolenticular limbs of the internal capsule and compared between groups. Neuropsychological (reaction time) and psychomotor functioning were assessed and correlated against FA. Fractional anisotropy was distinctly increased, whilst RD was decreased, in the right anterior internal capsule in those with melancholia, compared to controls. The right anterior limb of the internal capsule correlated with clinical ratings of psychomotor disturbance, and reduced psychomotor speed was associated with increased FA values in the right retrolenticular limb in those with melancholia. Our findings highlight a distinct disturbance in the local white matter arrangement in specific regions of the internal capsule in melancholia, which in turn is associated with psychomotor dysfunction. This study clarifies the contribution of structural brain integrity to the phenomenology of melancholia, and may assist future efforts seeking to integrate neurobiological markers into depression subtyping."

Inhibition of the proteasome using MG132 rescued GSV protein levels as well as insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in XAV939-treated L6 myotubes. These studies reveal an important role for tankyrase in maintaining the stability of key GLUT4 regulatory proteins that in turn plays a role in regulating cellular insulin sensitivity.

Furthermore, the role of tankyrase in skeletal muscle, the tissue that plays a central role in whole body insulin-mediated glucose uptake, is not known.

Tankyrase PARsylates AXIN, which is part of the β-catenin destruction complex, and targets it for degradation, thereby leading to the stabilization and activation of the β-catenin pathway (25Huang S.M.

In this study, we utilized XAV939 (24Wahlberg E. Karlberg T. Kouznetsova E. Markova N. Macchiarulo A. Thorsell A.G. Pol E. Frostell Å. Ekblad T. Öncü D. Kull B. Robertson G.M. Pellicciari R.

We applied label-free quantitative proteomics (27Cox J. Hein M.Y. Luber C.A. Paron I. Nagaraj N. Mann M. Accurate proteome-wide label-free quantification by delayed normalization and maximal peptide ratio extraction, termed MaxLFQ.Mol. Cell.

A similar reduction in GSV proteins was observed when tankyrase 1 was knocked down using a tankyrase 1-specific siRNA. Proteasome inhibition reversed the XAV939-mediated effect on glucose uptake and GSV protein levels in L6 myotubes. These data show an important role for tankyrase in glucose metabolism in skeletal muscle cells and provide new insights into the mechanism of insulin resistance mediated by tankyrase dysfunction. To determine the role of tankyrase in glucose uptake in muscle, the small molecule tankyrase inhibitor XAV939 (24Wahlberg E. Karlberg T. Kouznetsova E. Markova N. Macchiarulo A. Thorsell A.G. Pol E.

To confirm its efficacy in these cells, we incubated differentiated L6 myotubes with different doses of XAV939 for various times and assessed tankyrase inhibition (Fig. 1A). XAV939 treatment increased tankyrase 1/2 protein levels in a dose- and time-dependent manner, as previously shown (25Huang S.M. Mishina Y.M. Liu S. Cheung A. Stegmeier F. Michaud G.A. Charlat O. Wiellette E. Zhang Y. Wiessner S. Hild M. Shi X. Wilson C.J. Mickanin C. Myer V. et al.Tankyrase inhibition stabilizes axin and antagonizes Wnt signalling.Nature. 2009; 461 (19759537): 614-62010.1038/nature08356Crossref PubMed Scopus (1536) Google Scholar), confirming that XAV939 inhibited tankyrase auto-PARsylation and subsequent degradation. Consistent with efficient tankyrase inhibition with XAV939 treatment, a dose- and time-dependent decrease in β-catenin protein levels was observed (Fig. 1A). However, PTEN abundance was not affected by XAV939 treatment in skeletal muscle cells (Fig. 1A), which was inconsistent with a previous study performed in cancer cell lines showing that upon tankyrase 1/2 knockdown, protein levels of the tankyrase substrate PTEN were increased (28Li N. Zhang Y. Han X. Liang K. Wang J. Feng L. Wang W. Songyang Z. Lin C. Yang L. Yu Y. Chen J. Poly-ADP ribosylation of PTEN by tankyrases promotes PTEN degradation and tumor growth.Genes Dev. 2015; 29 (25547115): 157-17010.1101/gad.251785.114Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This suggests that regulation of PTEN protein levels may be cell type-specific. Global protein PARsylation in response to XAV939 treatment was also assessed (Fig. 1B). L6 myotubes were treated with or without XAV939, followed by enrichment of PARsylated proteins and immunoblotting with anti-poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) antibodies and a decrease in global PARsylated proteins was observed with XAV939 treatment (Fig. 1B), confirming that XAV939 inhibits tankyrase 1/2-mediated PARsylation in skeletal muscle cells. We next examined the effects of XAV939 on glucose uptake in differentiated L6 myotubes. We observed a significant dose-dependent defect in insulin-stimulated 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) uptake after 24 and 48 h of XAV939 treatment but not after 6 h (Fig. 1C), indicating that tankyrase inhibition in L6 myotubes results in insulin resistance, consistent with previous reports in adipocytes (23Yeh T.Y. Sbodio J.I. Tsun Z.Y. Luo B. Chi N.W. Insulin-stimulated exocytosis of GLUT4 is enhanced by IRAP and its partner tankyrase.Biochem. J. 2007; 402 (17059388): 279-29010.1042/BJ20060793Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). XAV939 treatment for 24–48 h also significantly affected basal glucose uptake in these cells. We next examined whether this defect in glucose uptake upon tankyrase inhibition was due to a defect in insulin signaling. L6 myotubes were incubated with or without XAV939 (1 μm, 24 h) and a range of insulin doses and insulin signaling was assessed by immunoblotting (Fig. 1D). XAV939 treatment had no effect on insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt (pThr-308, pSer-473) or its substrate AS160 (pThr-642), indicating that the impairment in 2-DG uptake upon tankyrase inhibition was not due to defective insulin signaling. Taken together, these data indicate that XAV939-mediated tankyrase inhibition resulted in insulin resistance in L6 myotubes. To ascertain which proteins were involved in this negative regulation of glucose metabolism, we next used MS-based quantitative proteomics to study the total proteome in this cellular model. We incubated L6 myotubes with or without XAV939 (1 μm, 24 h) and subjected the samples to label-free quantitative MS analysis. This led to the identification of 4,387 proteins and quantification of 4,374 proteins (Fig. 2A, Table S1) using MaxQuant as described under “Experimental procedures” (27Cox J. Hein M.Y. Luber C.A. Paron I. Nagaraj N. Mann M. Accurate proteome-wide label-free quantification by delayed normalization and maximal peptide ratio extraction, termed MaxLFQ.Mol. Cell.

Of these, 4,096 proteins were quantified in at least 2 replicates of both control and XAV939-treated samples (Fig. 2A, Table S2). The samples presented very consistent protein intensity distribution and were highly correlated (>0.98). Data analysis revealed 103 down-regulated proteins and 104 up-regulated proteins in response to XAV939 treatment using a 1.5-fold change threshold or exclusively quantified in one condition (Tables S3 and S4). Consistent with our immunoblotting results (Fig. 1A), β-catenin was down-regulated (0.66-fold, p value = 0.01) in response to XAV939 treatment, and tankyrase 2 was up-regulated (only quantified in all 3 XAV939-treated samples), thereby validating the approach. We next performed gene ontology overrepresentation analysis on the 207 differentially expressed proteins. A number of biological processes were significantly enriched upon tankyrase inhibition, including “vesicle-mediated transport,” which is implicated in glucose transport and GLUT4 exocytosis, the process which is defective upon tankyrase inhibition in L6 myotubes (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, 3 of the XAV939-regulated proteins that belong to the process “vesicle-mediated transport” are associated with GSVs (VTI1B, VAMP8, and RAB10) (3Larance M. Ramm G.

We therefore focused our analysis on GSV proteins in the proteomics dataset. We filtered our data for previously reported GSV proteins (1Stöckli J. Fazakerley D.J. James D.E. GLUT4 exocytosis.J.

Among these, RAB10, VAMP8, and RRAS were down-regulated and VTI1B was up-regulated in response to XAV939 treatment (Fig. 2B). To verify these findings and to examine additional GSV proteins not quantified by MS, we subjected control and XAV939-treated L6 myotube lysates to immunoblotting using specific antibodies for various GSV proteins. A number of crucial GSV proteins were reduced upon XAV939 treatment, including RAB10, VAMP8, SORT1, and GLUT4 (Fig. 2, C and D). Intriguingly, other bona fide GSV proteins, including VAMP2 and IRAP, were not modulated following inhibition of tankyrase indicating that this phenomenon was not simply en bloc degradation of GSVs. To validate the above findings using XAV939 we next utilized another tankyrase inhibitor, the broad-spectrum PARP inhibitor PJ34 (23Yeh T.Y. Sbodio J.I. Tsun Z.Y. Luo B. Chi N.W. Insulin-stimulated exocytosis of GLUT4 is enhanced by IRAP and its partner tankyrase.Biochem. J. 2007; 402 (17059388): 279-29010.1042/BJ20060793Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Consistent with XAV939, PJ34 (40 μm) caused an acute and significant reduction in 2-DG uptake after just 1 h of treatment and this suppression was more pronounced after 2 h (Fig. 3A). Insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation was reduced by PJ34 treatment at both Akt phosphorylation sites at a dose of 40 μm PJ34 (Fig. 3B). However, there was no reduction in Akt activity as assessed by phosphorylation of the Akt substrate AS160, which was not reduced by PJ34 treatment. Although it is not clear why Akt phosphorylation was affected by PJ34 treatment, these data suggest that Akt signaling was normal despite the reduction in its phosphorylation and it is likely that the residual Akt activity was sufficient as very little Akt activity is required for maximal downstream signaling (32Tan S.X.

Notably, PJ34 treatment affected the protein levels of the GSV proteins RAB10 and GLUT4 similar to XAV939 treatment (Fig. 3, C and D). Although XAV939 is a selective tankyrase 1/2 inhibitor, XAV939 can also bind PARP1/2 with a lesser affinity (24Wahlberg E. Karlberg T. Kouznetsova E. Markova N. Macchiarulo A. Thorsell A.G. Pol E.

We therefore tested whether the observed phenotypes in response to drug treatment were due to a specific effect on tankyrase by knocking down tankyrase 1. L6 myotubes were transfected with pooled TNKS1 siRNAs or scrambled siRNA for 24 or 48 h, resulting in efficient knockdown of TNKS1 (∼90%) but not TNKS2 (Fig. 4, A and C). TNKS1 knockdown resulted in decreased β-catenin protein levels confirming that tankyrase activity was abolished and also that TNKS1 is likely the major tankyrase in L6 myotubes (Fig. 4, C and D). Basal and insulin-stimulated 2-DG uptake was significantly impaired after 48 h of TNKS1 knockdown (Fig. 4B), confirming that TNKS1 knockdown reproduced"
https://openalex.org/W2799807810,"Chagas disease, caused by the intracellular protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, affects 8–10 million people worldwide and represents a major public health challenge. There is no effective treatment or vaccine to control the disease that is characterized by a mild acute phase followed by a chronic life-long infection. Approximately 30% of chronically infected individuals develop cardiac and/or digestive pathologies. T. cruzi can invade a wide variety of nucleated cells, but only persists at specific tissues in the host. However, the mechanisms that determine tissue tropism and the progression of the infection have not been fully described. Identification of infection niches in animal models has been difficult due to the limited quantity of parasite-infected cells and their focal distribution in tissues during the chronic phase. To better understand the course of chronic infections and parasite dissemination, we developed a bioluminescence imaging system based on the use of transgenic T. cruzi Colombiana strain parasites expressing nanoluciferase. Swiss Webster mice were infected with luminescent trypomastigotes and monitored for 126 days. Whole animal in vivo imaging showed parasites predominantly distributed in the abdominal cavity and surrounding areas throughout the infection. Bioluminescence signal reached a peak between 14 to 21 days post infection (dpi) and decreased progressively over time. Total animal luminescence could still be measured 126 dpi while parasites remained undetectable in blood by microscopy in most animals. Ex vivo imaging of specific tissues and organs dissected post-mortem at 126 dpi revealed a widespread parasite distribution in the skeletal muscle, heart, intestines and mesenteric fat. Parasites were also detected in lungs and liver. This noninvasive imaging model represents a novel tool to study host-parasite interactions and to identify parasite reservoirs of chronic Chagas Disease."

Offering controlled environments that increase cue-induced craving, virtual reality cue-exposure therapy has been shown to be effective for some addiction disorders. To assess the feasibility of virtual reality for patients with IGD, this study aimed to develop virtual environments that represent risk situations for inducing craving, and assess the effect of virtual reality in cue reactivity. A total of 64 male adolescents and young adults (34 with IGD and 30 without) were recruited for participation. We developed a virtual internet café environment and the participants were exposed to four different tasks. As the primary feasibility outcome, cravings were measured with a visual analogue scale measuring current urge to play a game after exposure to each task. The virtual internet café induced significantly greater cravings in patients with IGD compared to controls. Additionally, patients exhibited a significantly higher acceptance rate of an avatar's invitation to play a game together than that of controls. In IGD, craving response to the tasks was positively associated with the symptom severity score as measured by Young's Internet Addiction Test. These findings reveal that virtual reality laden with complex game-related cues could evoke game craving in patients with IGD and could be used in the treatment of IGD as a cue-exposure therapy tool for eliciting craving."
https://openalex.org/W2801826301,"Cocoa consumption has beneficial cardiometabolic effects, but underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Epicatechin, the cocoa major monomeric flavan-3-ol, is considered to contribute to these cardio-protective effects. We investigated effects of pure epicatechin supplementation on gene expression profiles of immune cells in humans. In a double blind, placebo-controlled cross-over trial, 32 (pre)hypertensive subjects aged 30 to 80, received two 4-week interventions, i.e. epicatechin (100mg/day) or placebo with a 4-week wash-out between interventions. Gene expression profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells were determined before and after both interventions. Epicatechin regulated 1180 genes, of which 234 differed from placebo. Epicatechin upregulated gene sets involved in transcription and tubulin folding and downregulated gene sets involved in inflammation, PPAR signalling and adipogenesis. Several negatively enriched genes within these gene sets were involved in insulin signalling. Most inhibited upstream regulators within the epicatechin intervention were cytokines or involved in inflammation. No upstream regulators were identified compared to placebo. Epicatechin, a cocoa flavan-3-ol, reduces gene expression involved in inflammation, PPAR-signalling and adipogenesis in immune cells. Effects were mild but our findings increase our understanding and provide new leads on how epicatechin rich products like cocoa may affect immune cells and exert cardiometabolic protective effects."
https://openalex.org/W2800677301,"The acceleration of myocardial relaxation produced by β-adrenoreceptor stimulation is mediated in part by protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation of cardiac troponin-I (cTnI), which decreases myofibrillar Ca2+ sensitivity. Previous evidence suggests that phosphorylation of both Ser-23 and Ser-24 in cTnI is required for this Ca2+ desensitization. PKA-mediated phosphorylation also partially protects cTnI from proteolysis by calpain. Here we report that protein kinase D (PKD) phosphorylates only one serine of cTnI Ser-23/24. To explore the functional consequences of this monophosphorylation, we examined the Ca2+ sensitivity of force production and susceptibility of cTnI to calpain-mediated proteolysis when Ser-23/24 of cTnI in mouse cardiac myofibrils was nonphosphorylated, mono-phosphorylated, or bisphosphorylated (using sequential incubations in λ-phosphatase, PKD, and PKA, respectively). Phos-tag gels, Western blotting, and high-resolution MS revealed that PKD produced >90% monophosphorylation of cTnI, primarily at Ser-24, whereas PKA led to cTnI bisphosphorylation exclusively. PKD markedly decreased the Ca2+ sensitivity of force production in detergent-permeabilized ventricular trabeculae, whereas subsequent incubation with PKA produced only a small further fall of Ca2+ sensitivity. Unlike PKD, PKA also substantially phosphorylated myosin-binding protein-C and significantly accelerated cross-bridge kinetics (ktr). After phosphorylation by PKD or PKA, cTnI in isolated myofibrils was partially protected from calpain-mediated degradation. We conclude that cTnI monophosphorylation at Ser-23/24 decreases myofibrillar Ca2+ sensitivity and partially protects cTnI from calpain-induced proteolysis. In healthy cardiomyocytes, the basal monophosphorylation of cTnI may help tonically regulate myofibrillar Ca2+ sensitivity.

Additionally, PKA-induced phosphorylation of cardiac myosin–binding protein C (cMyBP-C) accelerates myosin cross-bridge kinetics, which likely contributes to the inotropic and lusitropic effects.

To investigate this possibility, we produced myofibril preparations in which cTnI in the intact sarcomere is present with Ser-23/24 uniformly unphosphorylated, mono-phosphorylated (using PKD), or bisphosphorylated (using PKA) and compared the effects on myofibrillar contractile performance and on the protection of cTnI from calpain-mediated proteolysis. An essential part of this study was the development of a novel dephosphorylation protocol to remove pre-existing phosphorylation from the Ser-23/24 sites. Our data demonstrate that monophosphorylation of cTnI at Ser-23/24 (predominantly Ser-24) regulates the Ca2+ sensitivity of cardiac myofibrils and partially protects cTnI from calpain-induced proteolysis.

In our previous studies, cTnI phosphorylation was assessed using a pSer-23/24 antibody, but in this study, we used SDS-PAGE with Phos-tagTM reagent to quantify the different phosphorylation states of cTnI (Phos-tag binds to phosphate groups and retards protein migration according to the number of phosphorylated residues on the protein). As Fig. 1 illustrates, Phos-tag gels showed three different phosphorylation states of cTnI, which we assigned on the basis that PKA is known to produce bisphosphorylation of cTnI in the sarcomere. Even before the addition of any kinase, there was basal phosphorylation of cTnI in these myofibrils, even though the mice had received a β-adrenoreceptor antagonist (Fig. 1A), with about 40% present as the monophosphorylated form (1P) and about 60% as the unphosphorylated form (0P). Unexpectedly, after incubation of the myofibrils with constitutively active PKD, the proportion of cTnI that was monophosphorylated increased to more than 90%, but there was no statistically significant increase in the proportion of the bisphosphorylated (2P) form. Because the cTnI was basally phosphorylated before kinase addition, the effects of PKD incubation on cTnI could not be unambiguously interpreted. We therefore dephosphorylated all subsequent myofibril preparations using λ phosphatase (λ-PP) prior to PKD incubation. This protocol (which included additional steps to make it also suitable for use with skinned trabeculae) removed all visible endogenous phosphorylation from cTnI (Fig. 1B). Subsequent incubation with PKD induced exclusively mono-phosphorylation of cTnI, which was complete after 1 h of incubation. No statistically significant bisphosphorylation of TnI was observed even after 2 h of PKD incubation. As a check of the validity of these results, cTnI phosphorylation was assessed using a different technique: high-resolution MS (Fig. 1C). In the λ-PP–treated myofibrils, the proportions of un-, mono-, and bisphosphorylated forms of cTnI were 88%:10%:2%, respectively. After incubation of the myofibrils in PKD, the pattern changed to 5%:92%:3%, confirming that incubation of the myofibrils in PKD almost exclusively resulted in monophosphorylation of cTnI. The above results provide no information about the cTnI amino acid residue(s) targeted by PKD. To examine whether the relevant cTnI site was one (or either) of the Ser-23/24 residues, λ-PP–treated myofibrils were incubated first with PKD and then with PKA. As shown in Fig. 2A and Fig. S1, PKD induced monophosphorylation of cTnI, whereas PKA induced bisphosphorylation. There was no evidence for a trisphosphorylated state of cTnI, indicating that the preferred target for PKD was one of the “PKA” sites, i.e. Ser-23 or Ser-24. In support of this, an antibody against pSer-23/24 cTnI recognized the PKD-induced cTnI phosphorylation (Fig. 2A, bottom panel). Furthermore, myofibrils from transgenic cTnI-Ala2 mice (in which Ser-23 and Ser-24 are mutated to nonphosphorylatable alanine residues) remained unphosphorylated after PKD or PKA incubations, confirming the identity of the phospho-acceptor residue(s) that are selectively targeted by these kinases (Fig. 2B). We conclude that PKD monophosphorylation occurs at the Ser-23/24 sites in cTnI. It may be noted that the phosphoserine 23/24 cTnI antibody was not selective for the bisphosphorylated form of the protein but detected both the mono- and bisphosphorylated forms (Fig. 2, A and B), as reported previously (17Messer A.E. Gallon C.E. McKenna W.J. Dos Remedios C.G. Marston S.B.

Appl. 2009; 3 (21136957): 1371-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To interrogate whether PKD targets Ser-23 or Ser-24, we used a phosphorylation-specific antibody (mAb14) that has been shown to selectively bind to pSer-24 in human cTnI (17Messer A.E. Gallon C.E. McKenna W.J. Dos Remedios C.G. Marston S.B. The use of phosphate-affinity SDS-PAGE to measure the cardiac troponin I phosphorylation site distribution in human heart muscle.Proteomics Clin. Appl. 2009; 3 (21136957): 1371-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This antibody did not recognize mouse phosphorylated cTnI, 5A. Martin-Garrido, B. J. Biesiadecki, H. E. Salhi, Y. Shaifta, C. G. dos Remedios, S. Ayaz-Guner, W. Cai, Y. Ge, M. Avkiran, and J. C. Kentish, unpublished results. so we repeated the PKD/PKA incubations using λ-PP–treated myofibrils prepared from human donor heart samples (Fig. 2C). PKD induced monophosphorylation of cTnI in human myofibrils as in mouse myofibrils. There was substantial labeling of both the mono- and bisphosphorylated forms of human cTnI by the mAb14 antibody. Because there must be full phosphorylation of Ser-24 in the bisphosphorylated samples, the apparent similarity in the Ser-24 labeling intensities in the PKD-treated and PKA-treated myofibrils would suggest that most, or possibly all, of the monophosphorylation of PKD-treated cTnI is at Ser-24. Autoradiography using [32P]ATP was performed to investigate whether other myofibrillar proteins were significantly phosphorylated by PKD (and PKA). The autoradiogram (Fig. S2) indicates that cTnI and, to a lesser extent, cMyBP-C were the major myofilament proteins phosphorylated by either kinase. To investigate the functional consequences of cTnI monophosphorylation, we used the above dephosphorylation/phosphorylation protocol (Fig. 2) to produce sarcomeric cTnI in the unphosphorylated, monophosphorylated, and bisphosphorylated forms and compared the effects on two factors known to be influenced by cTnI phosphorylation: myofibrillar contractile performance and the protection of cTnI from calpain-mediated proteolysis. Myofibrillar Ca2+ sensitivity and cross-bridge kinetics (ktr) were measured in λ-PP–treated skinned trabeculae before and after PKD incubation and then again after incubation in PKA (Fig. 3 and Table S1). Time-matched controls were included (no kinases) because pilot experiments showed that there was a small but statistically significant decrease in Ca2+ sensitivity over the first hour or so of the experiment (Fig. 3B). The reason for this is unclear, but it may be related to a time-dependent reduction in titin-based passive force, which would decrease myofibrillar Ca2+ sensitivity (18Fukuda N. Granzier H. Role of the giant elastic protein titin in the Frank-Starling mechanism of the heart.Curr. Vasc. Pharmacol. 2004; 2 (15320514): 135-13910.2174/1570161043476357Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Incubation in PKD produced a large decrease of Ca2+ sensitivity, with the pCa50 (pCa for 50% activation of force) falling from 6.00 ± 0.04 to 5.68 ± 0.03 (mean ± S.E., n = 10), a mean reduction of 0.32 ± 0.01 (Fig. 3D). In contrast, the subsequent incubation in PKA (performed in five experiments) produced only a small further decrease in pCa50 from 5.70 ± 0.01 to 5.59 ± 0.01 (n = 5), an additional decrease of 0.11 ± 0.01. If we subtract the mean pCa50 changes in the corresponding time-matched controls, then the time-independent fall in pCa50 is 0.24 ± 0.03 for PKD (Fig. 3E) and 0.09 ± 0.01 for PKA alone (after PKD). This suggests that most of the Ca2+ desensitizing action of PKA-mediated bisphosphorylation of cTnI can be mimicked by PKD-mediated monophosphorylation alone. The maximum Ca2+-activated force (Fmax) generated by the trabeculae was unaffected by the incubation in PKD (Table S1). Fmax showed a small but significant decrease with PKD+PKA incubation compared with that in dephosphorylated muscles, but this was not statistically significant compared with its corresponding time-matched control. To check that the effect of PKD on Ca2+ sensitivity was mediated by phosphorylation at cTnI Ser-23/24, the experiments were repeated with λ-PP–treated skinned trabeculae from cTnI-Ala2 transgenic mice. Fig. 3C shows that Ca2+ sensitivity showed little or no change after incubation of these muscles with PKD or PKD+PKA. The pCa50 fell by 0.10 ± 0.01 with PKD incubation, but this was not significantly different from the small decrease seen in the time-matched control (Fig. 3D). We conclude that the Ca2+-desensitizing action of PKD, like PKA, requires the presence of phosphorylatable Ser-23 or Ser-24 in cTnI. In a previous study, we found that the monophosphorylation of cMyBP-C at Ser-302 by PKD could accelerate ktr to the same extent as produced by trisphosphorylation of cMyBP-C (at Ser-273/282/302) by PKA (8Bardswell S.C.

However, in that study, there was basal phosphorylation of all three cMyBP-C serines. We therefore repeated these experiments using λ-PP–treated skinned muscles. The rate of force redevelopment (ktr) varies with the degree of Ca2+ activation, i.e. with the relative force (19Fitzsimons D.P. Patel J.R. Moss R.L. Cross-bridge interaction kinetics in rat myocardium are accelerated by strong binding of myosin to the thin filament.J. Physiol. 2001; 530 (11208974): 263-27210.1111/j.1469-7793.2001.0263l.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), so we measured ktr over a range of forces and calculated the ktr at a relative force of 50% of maximum (ktr50) by interpolation. The results are shown in Fig. S3 and Table S1. Although incubation in PKD alone tended to increase ktr50, this was not statistically significant (Fig. S3D). In contrast, subsequent incubation with PKA significantly increased relative ktr50 from 28.2% ± 3.6% (post-PKD) to 37.5% ± 2.1%. Similar results were found with experiments using cTnI-Ala2 mice (Fig. S3, C and D). There was no change in ktr50 in WT time-matched controls. To investigate why PKD failed to accelerate cross-bridge kinetics significantly in this study, phospho-specific antibodies were used to quantify the magnitude and pattern of cMyBP-C phosphorylation by PKD or PKA (Fig. S4). This confirmed our previous finding (8Bardswell S.C. Cuello F. Rowland A.J. Sadayappan S. Robbins J. Gautel M. Walker J.W. Kentish J.C. Avkiran M. Distinct sarcomeric substrates are responsible for protein kinase D-mediated regulation of cardiac myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity and cross-bridge cycling.J. Biol.

However, in these λ-PP–treated myofibrils, the extent of phosphorylation of Ser-302 by PKD amounted to only about 40% of the phosphorylation of this same site by PKA after PKD. Thus, with these myofibrils, the PKD incubation conditions that produced full monophosphorylation of cTnI (Fig. 1) produced only partial phosphorylation of cMyBP-C Ser-302. Fig. S4 also illustrates the effectiveness of the initial λ-PP treatment in removing endogenous basal phosphorylation from these three serines of cMyBP-C. Calpain has been implicated in the proteolysis of cTnI that can occur in cardiac disease. Phosphorylation of the isolated cardiac troponin complex by PKA slows the proteolysis of isolated cTnI by calpain (13Di Lisa F. De Tullio R. Salamino F. Barbato R. Melloni E. Siliprandi N. Schiaffino S. Pontremoli S. Specific degradation of troponin T and I by μ-calpain and its modulation by substrate phosphorylation.Biochem. J. 1995; 308 (7755588): 57-6110.1042/bj3080057Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). We investigated whether monophosphorylation by PKD or bisphosphorylation by PKA protects cTnI in the intact sarcomere from calpain-dependent degradation. Myofibrils were treated with λ-PP and then PKD alone or PKD followed by PKA. Calpain-1 was then added, and the pattern of cTnI degradation was measured by immunoblotting using a polyclonal antibody against the core sequences of troponin. Fig. 4, A–C, shows that incubation of the myofibrils in calpain-1 led to rapid proteolysis of cTnI, with near-complete loss of the full-length protein at the highest activity (30 units) of calpain-1 used. Calpain incubation produced two main degradation bands: the first band of a molecular mass of ∼22 kDa appeared with both 10 units and 30 units of calpain and sometimes was seen as a doublet; the second band was of lower molecular mass and became prominent only at the highest activity of calpain. Prior treatment of cTnI with PKD partially protected the full-length protein against subsequent calpain-induced proteolysis, particularly that seen at 30 units of calpain-1 (Fig. 4, A and C). Partial protection from proteolysis was also observed when cTnI was first treated with PKD+PKA (Fig. 4, B and C); in this case, about 50% of full-length cTnI was preserved after 30-min incubation in 30 units of calpain. The protective effects of PKD or PKD+PKA incubation were not significantly different (p > 0.05). Previous reports have documented evidence for cTnI proteolysis within the C terminus or N terminus or both. To investigate whether the degradation products in our study were the results of N- or C-terminal cleavage of cTnI by calpain, we repeated our experiments using an mAb specific for residues 190–196 in the C terminus of cTnI (Fig. 4, D–F). The results confirmed that prior incubation in PKD or PKD+PKA partially protects cTnI from proteolysis (Fig. 4F). The C terminus antibody recognized the 22-kDa fragment(s) produced by calpain at 10 units or 30 units but not the lower-molecular-weight fragment seen"

Methods This single-center study retrospectively evaluated 196 patients who achieved SVR after HCV infection. The associations of risk factors with HCC development after HCV eradication were evaluated using univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models. Results Among the 196 patients, 8 patients (4.1%) developed HCC after SVR during a median follow-up of 26 months. Multivariate analyses revealed that HCC development was independently associated with age of ≥75 years (risk ratio [RR] = 35.16), α- fetoprotein levels of ≥6 ng/mL (RR = 40.30), and SWE results of ≥11 kPa (RR = 28.71). Conclusions Our findings indicate that SWE may facilitate HCC surveillance after SVR and the identification of patients who have an increased risk of HCC after HCV clearance."

We developed a clinical decision support system that attempted to address issues that were identified in these studies. The system was implemented in Dutch general practice and was designed to be both unobtrusive and to respond in real time. Despite our efforts, usage of the system was low. In the current study we perform a mixed methods evaluation to identify remediable barriers which led to disappointing usage rates for our system.A mixed methods evaluation employing an online questionnaire and focus group. The focus group was organized to clarify free text comments and receive more detailed feedback from general practitioners. Topics consisted of items based on results from the survey and additional open questions.The response rate for the questionnaire was 94%. Results from the questionnaire and focus group can be summarized as follows: The system was perceived as interruptive, despite its design. Participants felt that there were too many recommendations and that the relevance of the recommendations varied. Demographic based recommendations (e.g. age) were often irrelevant, while specific risk-based recommendations (e.g. diagnosis) were more relevant. The other main barrier to use was lack of time during the patient visit.These results are likely to be useful to other researchers who are attempting to address the problems of interruption and alert fatigue in decision support."
https://openalex.org/W3104275089,"Theoretical models and numerical simulations have established a framework of galaxy evolution in which galaxies merge and create dual supermassive black holes (with separations of one to ten kiloparsecs), which eventually sink into the centre of the merger remnant, emit gravitational waves and coalesce. The merger also triggers star formation and supermassive black hole growth, and gas outflows regulate the stellar content1–3. Although this theoretical picture is supported by recent observations of starburst-driven and supermassive black hole-driven outflows4–6, it remains unclear how these outflows interact with the interstellar medium. Furthermore, the relative contributions of star formation and black hole activity to galactic feedback remain unknown7–9. Here we report observations of dual outflows in the central region of the prototypical merger NGC 6240. We find a black-hole-driven outflow of [O iii] to the northeast and a starburst-driven outflow of Hα to the northwest. The orientations and positions of the outflows allow us to isolate them spatially and study their properties independently. We estimate mass outflow rates of 10 and 75 solar masses per year for the Hα bubble and the [O iii] cone, respectively. Their combined mass outflow is comparable to the star formation rate10, suggesting that negative feedback on star formation is occurring. Observations of NGC 6240 show two differently driven outflows of different gases with a combined outflow rate comparable to the star formation rate, suggesting possible negative feedback on star formation."
https://openalex.org/W2802307045,"We hypothesized that a single session of resistance exercise performed in moderate hypoxic (FiO2: 14%) environmental conditions would potentiate the anabolic response during the recovery period spent in normoxia. Twenty subjects performed a 1-leg knee extension session in normoxic or hypoxic conditions. Muscle biopsies were taken 15 min and 4 h after exercise in the vastus lateralis of the exercised and the nonexercised legs. Blood and saliva samples were taken at regular intervals before, during, and after the exercise session. The muscle fractional-protein synthetic rate was determined by deuterium incorporation into proteins, and the protein-degradation rate was determined by methylhistidine release from skeletal muscle. We found that: 1) hypoxia blunted the activation of protein synthesis after resistance exercise; 2) hypoxia down-regulated the transcriptional program of autophagy; 3) hypoxia regulated the expression of genes involved in glucose metabolism at rest and the genes involved in myoblast differentiation and fusion and in muscle contraction machinery after exercise; and 4) the hypoxia-inducible factor-1α pathway was not activated at the time points studied. Contrary to our hypothesis, environmental hypoxia did not potentiate the short-term anabolic response after resistance exercise, but it initiated transcriptional regulations that could potentially translate into satellite cell incorporation and higher force production in the long term.-Gnimassou, O., Fernández-Verdejo, R., Brook, M., Naslain, D., Balan, E., Sayda, M., Cegielski, J., Nielens, H., Decottignies, A., Demoulin, J.-B., Smith, K., Atherton, P.

The therapeutic efficacy of these steroids is limited by side effects and glucocorticoid resistance. Multiple glucocorticoid receptor (GR) isoforms are produced from a single gene by alternative translation initiation; however, the role individual isoforms play in tissue-specific responses to glucocorticoids is unknown. We have generated knockin mice that exclusively express the most active receptor isoform, GR-C3. GR-C3 knockin mice die at birth due to respiratory distress. Microarray analysis of fibroblasts from wild-type and GR-C3 mice indicated that most genes regulated by GR-C3 were unique to this isoform. Antenatal glucocorticoid administration rescued GR-C3 knockin mice from neonatal death. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry revealed no major alterations in body composition for rescued knockin mice. Rescued female, but not male, GR-C3 mice exhibited increased wheel running activity in the light portion of the day. LPS administration induced premature mortality in rescued GR-C3 knockin mice, and gene expression studies revealed a deficiency in the ability of GR-C3 to repress a large cohort of immune and inflammatory response genes.

Despite decades of research, cancer is the second leading cause of death worldwide. Last year alone, over 1.5 million new cancer cases and over 500,000 cancer deaths were projected to occur in the United States (1Siegel R.L. Miller K.D. Jemal A. Cancer statistics, 2016.CA Cancer J. Clin. 2016; 66 (26742998): 7-3010.3322/caac.21332Crossref PubMed Scopus (21988) Google Scholar). The inherent diversity and complexity of the disease makes the design of a single drug or cure impossible. The most widely used therapies for cancer include radiation and chemotherapy, increasingly augmented with some form of immunotherapy, as well as surgery. For solid tumors, the most successful treatments depend on the complete surgical resection of tumors and any metastases (2Mammen J.M. James L.E. Molloy M. Williams A. Wray C.J. Sussman J.J. The relationship of lymph node dissection and colon cancer survival in the Veterans Affairs Central Cancer Registry.Am. J.

Adenocarcinomas, which arise from glandular epithelial tissues, are the most common solid tumor, frequently found in colon, breast, pancreas, prostate, and lung. There are a handful of methods used in surgical oncology to ensure that a solid tumor has been completely removed. Knowledge of tumor progression pathways, visual identification, and physical palpation are used with imaging methods such computerized tomography, positron emission tomography (PET), 2The abbreviations used are: PETpositron emission tomographyscFvsingle-chain variable fragmentTAG-72tumor-associated glycoprotein 72TAAtumor-associated antigenSPRsurface plasmon resonanceDSFdifferential scanning fluorimetryIMACimmobilized metal affinity chromatographyPKpharmacokineticsNi–NTAnickel-nitrilotriacetic acidIDinjected doseTEVtobacco etch virusAUCanalytical ultracentrifugationBSMbovine submaxillary mucin. and single-photon emission computed tomography to identify locations and margins of tumors and metastases. PET and single-photon emission computed tomography are two forms of nuclear imaging that involve the injection of a radiolabeled tracer agent into a patient. The agent is then detected by an imager, and the three-dimensionally rendered image is often overlaid with a three-dimensional image from co-registered computerized tomography. The effectiveness of these techniques is limited by the specificity of the radiolabeled agent. The most widely used PET agent, [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose, is taken up by rapidly metabolizing cells, which is a characteristic of some tumors (3Shankar L.K. Hoffman J.M. Bacharach S. Graham M.M.

However, [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose has limited use in that it targets only highly metabolic tumors and also targets other noncancerous tissues such as the brain, liver, and damaged or healing tissue.

Radiolabeled antibody fragments have the potential to produce improved cancer-specific images. Unlike a full-length IgGs, antibody fragments are small, and many do not contain constant domains, allowing for increased tumor penetration and less severe host immune response (8Todorovska A.

Most importantly, their small size allows for faster clearance from the blood, producing little circulating background and higher signal-to-noise ratios and therefore higher quality images. The serum half-lives of these antibody fragments can be specifically tuned to optimize tumor penetration and clearance from blood by controlling their size through chemical modification or other means. Clearance time can be matched to radionuclide half-life to select the desired imaging time for patients (10Chapman A.P. Antoniw P. Spitali M. West S. Stephens S. King D.J.

Fragment size can be controlled by modification with polyethyleneglycol chains or, as in our study, through designed manipulation of oligomeric state. Despite these advantages, antibody fragments often suffer from instability, aggregation, reduced binding affinity, and substantially decreased serum half-life (12Plückthun A. Antibody engineering: advances from the use of Escherichia coli expression systems.Biotechnology. 1991; 9 (1367224): 545-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In the case of the variable fragment (FV), the loss in stability is due to the removal of the constant domains that have interdomain disulfide bonds. This leaves only the weak noncovalent interaction between the VL and VH domains. Engineering disulfide bridges (dsFV) or, more commonly, the genetic fusion of a flexible peptide linker between domains (scFV) have been shown to improve overall stability (12Plückthun A. Antibody engineering: advances from the use of Escherichia coli expression systems.Biotechnology. 1991; 9 (1367224): 545-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 13Pantoliano M.W. Bird R.E.

These linkers tend to be simple, rich in glycine and serine repeats, biologically inspired (e.g. the interdomain linker region of the fungal cellulase cellobiohydrolase I (CBHI)), or discovered via high throughput methods such as phage display (14Alfthan K. Takkinen K. Sizmann D. Söderlund H. Teeri T.T.

The reduction in binding affinity observed for antibody fragments is often related to stability but also can be related to antibody fragment monovalency (16Cuesta A.M. Sánchez-Martin D. Blanco-Toribio A. Villate M. Enciso-Álvarez K. Alvarez-Cienfuegos A. Sainz-Pastor N. Sanz L. Blanco F.J. Alvarez-Vallina L. Improved stability of multivalent antibodies containing the human collagen XV trimerization domain.mAbs. 2012; 4 (22453098): 226-23210.4161/mabs.4.2.19140Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). ScFV antibodies can form dimeric, trimeric, and even higher order oligomeric species based on the size of their engineered linkers. The tunability of quaternary structure is due to the added constraints on intramolecular domain interactions, which can then only be satisfied intermolecularly. The rule of thumb is that monomeric species form with 12 or more amino acids in the linker, whereas 5–12 amino acids will produce a dimeric species or diabody (17Atwell J.L. Breheney K.A. Lawrence L.J. McCoy A.J. Kortt A.A. Hudson P.J. scFv multimers of the anti-neuraminidase antibody NC10: length of the linker between VH and VL domains dictates precisely the transition between diabodies and triabodies.Protein Eng. 1999; 12 (10436086): 597-60410.1093/protein/12.7.597Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Shorter linkers or the direct fusion of variable domains will produce triabodies in some studies but tetramers in others (18Dolezal O. Pearce L.A. Lawrence L.J. McCoy A.J. Hudson P.J. Kortt A.A. ScFv multimers of the anti-neuraminidase antibody NC10: shortening of the linker in single-chain Fv fragment assembled in V-L to V-H orientation drives the formation of dimers, trimers, tetramers and higher molecular mass multimers.Protein Eng. 2000; 13 (10964986): 565-57410.1093/protein/13.8.565Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In general, the studies leading to these rules include fairly small data sets, limited biophysical characterization, and often compare disparate scaffold molecules. In this study, through an expansive series of constructs, we elucidate the importance of antibody fragment linkers and domain orientation. Specifically, we have cloned, expressed, and characterized scFVs, diabodies, and higher order multimeric constructs with varying linker compositions, sizes, and domain orientations. These constructs have been characterized by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to test for antigen binding, by differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) to test for thermal stability, and by gel chromatography to test for quaternary structure and homogeneity. We observed deviations in oligomeric forms from previously reported trends in linker design. We believe purification by protein L binding gives a more accurate representation of oligomeric distributions than commonly used immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) purification. In addition, we have selected a single construct (VH–G4S–VL) from the 3E8 linker library with ideal biophysical characteristics and pharmacokinetic (PK) properties to be used as a possible lead candidate for cancer imaging. After further characterization, production optimization, and in vitro tissue staining, we have successfully produced xenograft mouse images with a remarkably high 29:1 tumor-to-background contrast. In designing our library, we primarily used glycine and serine repeat linkers, because their small side chains allow flexibility, and serine increases solubility and decreases immunotoxicity (19Huston J.S. Mudgetthunter M. Tai M.S. Mccartney J. Warren F. Haber E. Oppermann H. Protein engineering of single-chain Fv analogs and fusion proteins.Method Enzymol. 1991; 203 (1762568): 46-8810.1016/0076-6879(91)03005-2Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In addition, we included a non-Gly-Ser repeat linker, 205C, which was designed to be helical and possibly advantageous over nonstructured linkers if less susceptible to proteolysis (20Pavlinkova G. Beresford G.W. Booth B.J. Batra S.K. Colcher D. Pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of engineered single-chain antibody constructs of MAb CC49 in colon carcinoma xenografts.J. Nucl.

The 17-member 3E8 antibody fragment library was cloned using overlap PCR and two different templates (Fig. 1A). For all VL–VH domain–oriented constructs, our original 3E8 construct (VL–205C–VH, manuscript in preparation) was used as the template (22Gong L. Ding H. Long N.E. Sullivan B.J. Martin Jr., E.W. Magliery T.J. Tweedle M.F. A 3E8.scFv.Cys-IR800 conjugate targeting TAG-72 in an orthotopic colorectal cancer model.Mol. Imaging Biol. 2018; 20 (28643153): 47-5410.1007/s11307-017-1096-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). For the cloning of VH–VL orientation constructs, a gene containing a G4S linker (custom synthesis by Genewiz) was used as the template. For all cloning and purification, our lab’s pHLIC plasmid vector was used and contained the features shown in Fig. 1D (23Durani V. Sullivan B.J. Magliery T.J. Simplifying protein expression with ligation-free, traceless and tag-switching plasmids.Protein Expr. Purif. 2012; 85 (22728767): 9-1710.1016/j.pep.2012.06.007Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Two separate PCR products were created for each construct that contained altered but overlapping linker regions between domains and joined together to create a full-length gene (Fig. 1, B and C). At first, our constructs were purified from cell lysate by IMAC purification. The concentration and purity of these constructs were determined by SDS–PAGE (Fig. 1E), typically in the range of 95% purity. Gel filtration analysis of the IMAC-purified constructs showed a distribution of oligomeric states of monomer, dimer, trimer, tetramer, to higher order oligomer (Fig. 2, A and B). The primary oligomeric state of our constructs was either a monomer or a dimer and depended on the linker length. Constructs with 15–25 amino acids produced monomers and constructs with 1–5 produced dimers (Table 1). The overall pattern of quaternary structure was also found to be independent of domain orientation.Table 1Antibody library biophysical characterization summaryView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab The thermostability of the seventeen antibody fragment constructs was analyzed by DSF (Fig. 2, C and D). The melting point for each fragment was calculated by finding the maxima of the first derivative of each curve (Table 1). The fragments exhibited a range in stability of 17 °C. We found that constructs in the VH–VL orientation displayed a lower stability of ∼5 °C compared with their VL–VH counterparts. We also noted a non–two-state melting pattern that was more prevalent in the VH–VL orientation. All of these antibody fragments were found to bind to immobilized bovine submaxillary mucin (a source of sialyl-Tn) with low nanomolar affinity (Table 1). Specifically, these constructs ranged in apparent affinity from 3 to 15 nm, when fitting to a simple 1:1 binding model. Higher order oligomers may appear to bind more tightly because of avidity, but we chose this simple model to compare the binding regardless of oligomeric state. Antibody fragments in the VH–VL orientation were tighter binders (Fig. S1). The data from the IMAC-purified constructs demonstrate the versatility of scFvs with respect to linker length, amino acid composition, and domain orientation. All 17 antibody fragments were well folded, stable, and functional binders. We did see a tendency for greater instability arising from the VH–VL orientation. This decrease in stability is also correlated to constructs with higher oligomeric states, but as these molecules increase in valency, increasing the binding avidity, we can detect slower off rates and slightly lower apparent KD (Table 1). The patterns we see in the oligomeric states of these molecules correlate with the linker length observations Wörn and Plückthun (24Wörn A. Plückthun A. Stability engineering of antibody single-chain Fv fragments.J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305 (11162109): 989-101010.1006/jmbi.2000.4265Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). After completion of the antibody linker library, a construct was selected for further in vivo characterization. The 3E8 construct VH–G4S–VL (termed 3E8.G4S) showed enhanced apparent binding and stability. In addition, the dimeric nature of this construct created a complex greater than 50 kDa and was predicted to have a longer serum half-life than its monomeric counterparts. For future commercial production of 3E8.G4S, alterations in the expression plasmid and method of purification were made. The resistance gene from pHLIC was changed from ampicillin to kanamycin to create the new expression vector pHLICK. Additionally, the His6 tag was removed from the sequence, and an alternate method of purification by protein L was adapted. This new expression format and purification process increased our protein yields substantially. The protein eluted from a single protein L column was equal, if not greater, in purity than our previously described two column Ni–NTA purification method (Fig. S2). A sample of 3E8.G4S purified using the new methodology was recharacterized and was shown to have comparable binding and stability. Surprisingly, gel filtration showed an increased presence of higher order oligomeric states (i.e. trimers and tetramers). After further investigation, we determined that the reason for these differences was not an artifact of protein L purification or the absence of the His6 tag but rather is a more accurate representation of the oligomeric state. Additionally, we found that having the His6 tag on multimeric constructs prevented some of them from binding to protein L. For this reason, a library of tagless 3E8 linker and domain constructs was created for protein L purification and oligomeric state analysis. The tagless 3E8 constructs were created using several different cloning methods (Fig. S4). Two new linker constructs were created using overlap PCR that contained a 10-amino acid linker (G4S)2 while removing the His6 tag and TEV site from the N-terminal portion of the gene. VH–VL domain oriented sequences were created using a double digest scheme of existing restriction sites. The VL–VH orientation sequences did not contain these sites, and therefore alternate PCR methods were used for His6 tag and TEV site removal. Genetic removal of the His6 tag and purification using protein L affinity columns allowed for higher protein yield and purity. This produced a substantially different composition of oligomeric states (Fig. 3, A and B). Those constructs, which were previously monomeric, contained more dimeric and trimeric species. Likewise, constructs that were previously dimeric contained more trimeric and tetrameric species. It also became clear that the VH–VL orientation contained larger amounts of soluble aggregate. A subset of the tagless antibody constructs were analyzed using AUC. The results correlated to the gel filtration analysis in both predicted species molecular weights and relative distribution of oligomeric species (Fig. S5). To understand the contrasting gel filtration results between Ni–NTA IMAC and protein L purification, several additional experiments were performed. The first experiment was conducted to determine the effects of the His6 tag on the oligomeric states of the constructs. Gel filtration on protein L–purified construct VL-(G4S)4-VL before and after TEV cleavage of the His6 tag revealed a small shift caused by the decrease in size but no change in the relative distribution of oligomeric states (Fig. S7B). Next, the concentration dependence of the oligomeric states was tested by concentrating three different antibody constructs and comparing their gel filtration chromatographs before and after concentration. No difference in the relative oligomeric distribution was seen (Fig. S7A). The reproducibility of the oligomeric state distribution was determined by 12 parallel 1-liter purifications of 3E8.G4S. Gel-filtration analysis of these small batch purifications showed less than 10% deviation of dimer to higher oligomeric state ratio (Fig. S3). After the initial analysis of both His6-tagged and tagless library members, the construct 3E8.G4S showed promising biophysical characteristics including a low apparent KD of 3.6 nm, high stability, and a favorable distribution of oligomeric states (Fig. 4, A, B, D, and E). Sed-fit (25Schuck P. Size-distribution analysis of macromolecules by sedimentation velocity ultracentrifugation and Lamm equation modeling.Biophys. J. 2000; 78 (10692345): 1606-161910.1016/S0006-3495(00)76713-0Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3045) Google Scholar) analysis of the AUC data determined this construct to be 47% dimer, 42% trimer, and 11% tetramer (Fig. 4C). We selected this variant for further in vitro and in vivo testing. Using a prep-grade gel-filtration column, a sample of 3E8.G4S was separated by size into two fractions. These fractions included an enriched diabody sample and an enriched oligomer (trimer and tetramer) sample. These samples were analyzed by gel filtration 24 h after their original purification from 3E8.G4S. No change in oligomeric state was seen, suggesting that domain swapping equilibration does not occur freely in solution (Fig. S6). These enriched fractions were also analyzed by DSF and SPR. Both diabody- and oligomer-enriched fractions were stable and active binders. The application of targeting adenocarcinomas was tested by immunohistochemistry. A C-terminal FLAG tag was cloned into 3E8.G4S to create 3E8.G4S.FLAG. A single-chain monomer version (VL–205C–VH) of the FLAG tagged 3E8 was also created, 3E8.scFV.FLAG, to see the effects of multivalency on detection sensitivity. The resulting staining showed enhanced detection ability in both antibody fragments over the commercially available anti-sialyl-Tn IgG, B-72.3 (Fig. 5A) without an increase in background staining of healthy tissue. Additionally, the polyvalency of antibody fragments allowed for greater dilution without loss in signal, because we saw comparable staining with 500 nm of monomeric 3E8.scFV.FLAG to 15 nm of multimeric 3E8.G4S.FLAG. To see the effect of oligomeric state on the PK properties of 3E8.G4S, the trimeric and tetrameric species were again separated from the dimeric species using prep scale gel filtration. Unfractionated 3E8.G4S, 3E8.G4S purified dimer, and 3E8.G4S purified oligomers were separately 125I-labeled and injected into mice via tail vein (n = 5). The half-lives were determined to be 0.67, 2.0, and 3.3 h for dimeric, unaltered, and oligomeric 3E8.G4S species, respectively (Fig. 5B). As expected, the smaller molecules (dimer fraction) cleared the blood faster than the higher order oligomers (trimer and tetramer). Furthermore, the half-life of unfractionated 3E8.G4S fell in between its isolated components. The distributions of the three distinct 125I-labeled 3E8.G4S oligomeric samples in mice were analyzed 72 h postinjection. The higher-order oligomeric states of 3E8.G4S, in general, were found in higher amounts throughout the mouse compared with the dimeric fraction of 3E8.G4S. The unfractionated 3E8.G4S was found to fall between the values of the oligomeric and dimeric fractions of 3E8.G4S (Fig. 5C). The biodistribution results correlated well to the PK analysis, and we saw no greater than 0.6% ID/g (percentage of injected dose per gram) accumulation of higher order oligomers in any organ including the kidneys or liver. For final proof of concept, 3E8.G4S purified by protein L was labeled using 124I and injected into xenograft mice bearing the TAG-72–positive human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line, LS174T. Micro-PET imaging of 3E8.G4S 48 h after intravenous administration showed a low background of 0.21% ID/g and significant targeting of all tumors, averaging 6.61% ID/g in tumor and yielding a final tumor to background ratio of 29:1 based on biodistribution (Fig. 5D). Antibody fragments have great potential for clinical use as enhanced cancer imaging tools, but the widespread use of engineered fragments is hindered by their decreased binding affinity and stability and by the resulting difficulty of large-scale production.

Identifying genes associated with fatty acids composition could provide valuable information for the complex genetic networks of genes with underlying variations in fatty acids synthesis. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was conducted to explore the chicken transcriptome from the thigh muscle tissue of 6 Huangshan Black Chickens with 3 extremely high and low phenotypic values for percentage of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). In total, we obtained 41,139,108–44,901,729 uniquely mapped reads, which covered 74.15% of the current annotated transcripts including 18964 mRNA transcripts, across all the six thigh muscle tissue samples. Of these, we revealed 274 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with a highly significant correlation with polyunsaturated fatty acids percentage between the comparison groups based on the ratio of PUFA/SFA. Gene ontology and pathway analysis indicated that the DEGs were enriched in particular biological processes affecting fatty acids metabolism, biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids (USFAs), and cell junction-related pathways. Integrated interpretation of differential gene expression and formerly reported quantitative trait loci (QTL) demonstrated that FADS2, DCN, FRZB, OGN, PRKAG3, LHFP, CHCHD10, CYTL1, FBLN5, and ADGRD1 are the most promising candidate genes affecting polyunsaturated fatty acids percentage."
https://openalex.org/W2801707625,"Introduction WHO recommends antiretroviral treatment (ART) for all HIV-positive individuals. This study evaluated the association between baseline CD4 count and attrition in a cohort of HIV positive adults initiating ART at three department of health (DOH) clinics routinely providing ART at baseline CD4 counts >500cells/μL for the HPTN 071 (PopART) trial. Methods All clients attending the DOH clinics were managed according to standard care guidelines with the exception that those starting ART outside of pertinent local guidelines signed research informed consent. DOH data on all HIV-positive adult clients recorded as having initiated ART between January 2014 and November 2015 at the three study clinics was analysed. Attrition, included clients lost to follow up or died, and was defined as ‘being three or more months late for an antiretroviral pharmacy pick-up appointment’. All clients were followed until attrition, transfer out or end May 2016. Results A total of 2423 clients with a median baseline CD4 count of 328 cells/μL (IQR 195–468) were included of whom 631 (26.0%) experienced attrition and 140 (5.8%) were TFO. Attrition was highest during the first six months of ART (IR 38.3/100 PY; 95% CI 34.8–42.1). Higher attrition was found amongst those with baseline CD4 counts > 500 cells/μL compared to those with baseline CD4 counts of 0–500 cells/μL (aHR 1.26, 95%CI 1.05 to 1.52) This finding was confirmed on subset analyses when restricted to individuals non-pregnant at baseline and when restricted to individuals with follow up of > 12months. Conclusions Attrition in this study was high, particularly during the first six months of treatment. Attrition was highest amongst clients starting ART at baseline CD4 counts > 500 cells/μL. Strategies to improve retention amongst ART clients, particularly those starting ART at baseline CD4 counts >500cells/μL, need strengthening. Improved monitoring of clients moving in and out of ART care and between clinics will assist in better understanding attrition and ART coverage in high burden countries."
https://openalex.org/W2799624875,"While studies of taxonomy usually focus on species description, there is also a taxonomic correction process that retests and updates existing species circumscriptions on the basis of new evidence. These corrections may themselves be subsequently retested and recorrected. We studied this correction process by using the Check-List of North and Middle American Birds, a well-known taxonomic checklist that spans 130 years. We identified 142 lumps and 95 splits across sixty-three versions of the Check-List and found that while lumping rates have markedly decreased since the 1970s, splitting rates are accelerating. We found that 74% of North American bird species recognized today have never been corrected (i.e., lumped or split) over the period of the checklist, while 16% have been corrected exactly once and 10% have been corrected twice or more. Since North American bird species are known to have been extensively lumped in the first half of the 20th century with the advent of the biological species concept, we determined whether most splits seen today were the result of those lumps being recorrected. We found that 5% of lumps and 23% of splits fully reverted previous corrections, while a further 3% of lumps and 13% of splits are partial reversions. These results show a taxonomic correction process with moderate levels of recorrection, particularly of previous lumps. However, 81% of corrections do not revert any previous corrections, suggesting that the majority result in novel circumscriptions not previously recognized by the Check-List. We could find no order or family with a significantly higher rate of correction than any other, but twenty-two genera as currently recognized by the AOU do have significantly higher rates than others. Given the currently accelerating rate of splitting, prediction of the end-point of the taxonomic recorrection process is difficult, and many entirely new taxonomic concepts are still being, and likely will continue to be, proposed and further tested."
https://openalex.org/W2801678849,"Comparative genomics and transcriptomic analyses were performed on two agronomically important groups of genes from oil palm versus other major crop species and the model organism, Arabidopsis thaliana. The first analysis was of two gene families with key roles in regulation of oil quality and in particular the accumulation of oleic acid, namely stearoyl ACP desaturases (SAD) and acyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) thioesterases (FAT). In both cases, these were found to be large gene families with complex expression profiles across a wide range of tissue types and developmental stages. The detailed classification of the oil palm SAD and FAT genes has enabled the updating of the latest version of the oil palm gene model. The second analysis focused on disease resistance (R) genes in order to elucidate possible candidates for breeding of pathogen tolerance/resistance. Ortholog analysis showed that 141 out of the 210 putative oil palm R genes had homologs in banana and rice. These genes formed 37 clusters with 634 orthologous genes. Classification of the 141 oil palm R genes showed that the genes belong to the Kinase (7), CNL (95), MLO-like (8), RLK (3) and Others (28) categories. The CNL R genes formed eight clusters. Expression data for selected R genes also identified potential candidates for breeding of disease resistance traits. Furthermore, these findings can provide information about the species evolution as well as the identification of agronomically important genes in oil palm and other major crops."
https://openalex.org/W2802794838,"Anemia commonly occurs in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is associated with poor clinical outcomes. The management of patients with anemia in CKD is challenging, due to its severity, frequent hypo-responsiveness to treatment with erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESA) and common hemoglobin cycling. Nonlinear dose-response curves and long delays in the effect of treatment on red blood cell population size complicate predictions of hemoglobin (Hgb) levels in individual patients. A comprehensive physiology based mathematical model for erythropoiesis was adapted individually to 60 hemodialysis patients treated with ESAs by identifying physiologically meaningful key model parameters from temporal Hgb data. Crit-Line® III monitors provided non-invasive Hgb measurements for every hemodialysis treatment. We used Hgb data during a 150-day baseline period together to estimate a patient’s individual red blood cell lifespan, effects of the ESA on proliferation of red cell progenitor cells, endogenous erythropoietin production and ESA half-life. Estimated patient specific parameters showed excellent alignment with previously conducted clinical studies in hemodialysis patients. Further, the model qualitatively and quantitatively reflected empirical hemoglobin dynamics in demographically, anthropometrically and clinically diverse patients and accurately predicted the Hgb response to ESA therapy in individual patients for up to 21 weeks. The findings suggest that estimated model parameters can be used as a proxy for parameters that are clinically very difficult to quantify. The presented method has the potential to provide new insights into the individual pathophysiology of renal anemia and its association with clinical outcomes and can potentially be used to guide personalized anemia treatment."

https://openalex.org/W2802583057,"The purpose of this study was to compare cardiovascular and respiratory effects of two volumes of bupivacaine 0.25% (0.2 mL kg-1—treatment BUP02—and 0.4 mL kg-1 –treatment BUP04) administered epidurally at the lumbosacral intervertebral space in dogs anesthetized with isoflurane. This experimental prospective randomized crossover design trial used six mixed breed adult dogs, four neutered males and two spayed females. Each dog was anesthetized on three different occasions: the first for isoflurane minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) measurement, and the following two assigned treatments (BUP02 or BUP04). On the two treatment days, anesthesia was induced and maintained with isoflurane at 1.3 MAC during the experiments. Cardiovascular and respiratory measurements were recorded before (T0) and 5, 15, 30, 60 and 90 minutes after the epidural administration of bupivacaine. Comparisons between and within groups were performed by a mixed-model ANOVA and Friedman’s test when appropriate followed by Bonferroni post-hoc test or Dunnet’s test to compare time points within each treatment with T0 (p < 0.05). Mean arterial pressure decreased significantly from 15 to 90 minutes after the administration of BUP02 and from 5 to 60 minutes in BUP04, with lower values in BUP04 than in BUP02 lasting up to 30 minutes after bupivacaine administration. No significant changes in cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance were observed in either treatment. Hypoventilation was only detected in BUP04. Hemoglobin concentration and arterial oxygen content decreased after both treatment of bupivacaine with no significant decrease in oxygen delivery. Two dogs in BUP04 developed Horner’s syndrome. The epidural administration of 0.4 mL.kg-1 of bupivacaine to dogs in sternal recumbency anesthetized with isoflurane 1.3 MAC caused more cardiovascular and respiratory depression than 0.2 mL.kg-1."
https://openalex.org/W2801261699,"Integral membrane proteins are prone to aggregation and misfolding in aqueous environments and therefore require binding by molecular chaperones during their biogenesis. Chloroplast signal recognition particle 43 (cpSRP43) is an ATP-independent chaperone required for the biogenesis of the most abundant class of membrane proteins, the light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b-binding proteins (LHCPs). Previous work has shown that cpSRP43 specifically recognizes an L18 loop sequence conserved among LHCP paralogs. However, how cpSRP43 protects the transmembrane domains (TMDs) of LHCP from aggregation was unclear. In this work, alkylation-protection and site-specific cross-linking experiments found that cpSRP43 makes extensive contacts with all the TMDs in LHCP. Site-directed mutagenesis identified a class of cpSRP43 mutants that bind tightly to the L18 sequence but are defective in chaperoning full-length LHCP. These mutations mapped to hydrophobic surfaces on or near the bridging helix and the β-hairpins lining the ankyrin repeat motifs of cpSRP43, suggesting that these regions are potential sites for interaction with the client TMDs. Our results suggest a working model for client protein interactions in this membrane protein chaperone."
https://openalex.org/W2802394128,"We investigated the impact of attachment distress on affect-centered mentalization in a clinical and a non-clinical sample, comparing mentalization in a baseline condition to mentalization under a condition of attachment distress.The sample consisted of 127 adults who underwent inpatient psychosomatic treatment, and 34 mentally healthy adults. Affect-centered mentalization was assessed by analyzing participants' narratives on interpersonal situations in a baseline condition with the Levels of Emotional Awareness Scale (LEAS), and an experimental condition inducing attachment distress with the Adult Attachment Projective Picture System (AAP). Unlike the LEAS, the AAP is specifically designed to trigger attachment distress. In both conditions, the narratives were evaluated using the LEAS scoring system. Additionally, we assessed the impact of childhood trauma on affect-centered mentalization with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ).While the non-clinical sample displayed the same level of affect-centered mentalization in both conditions, the majority of the clinical sample reached higher scores in the attachment distress condition. There was no strong relationship between reported trauma and mentalization scores.Our findings lend strong empirical support to the assumption that affect-centered mentalization is modulated by attachment-related distress. Several possible explanations for the differences between and within the clinical and the non-clinical sample are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2952062520,"Successful medicinal chemistry campaigns to discover and optimize sphingosine kinase inhibitors require a robust assay for screening chemical libraries and for determining rank order potencies. Existing assays for these enzymes are laborious, expensive and/or low throughput. The toxicity of excessive levels of phosphorylated sphingoid bases for the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, affords an assay wherein inhibitors added to the culture media rescue growth in a dose-dependent fashion. Herein, we describe our adaptation of a simple, inexpensive, and high throughput assay for assessing inhibitors of sphingosine kinase types 1 and 2 as well as ceramide kinase and for testing enzymatic activity of sphingosine kinase type 2 mutants. The assay was validated using recombinant enzymes and generally agrees with the rank order of potencies of existing inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2802890338,"The effect of a multi-faceted handoff strategy in a high volume internal medicine inpatient setting on process and patient outcomes has not been clearly established. We set out to determine if a multi-faceted handoff intervention consisting of education, standardized handoff procedures, including fixed time and location for face-to-face handoff would result in improved rates of handoff compared with usual practice. We also evaluated resident satisfaction, health resource utilization and clinical outcomes.This was a cluster randomized controlled trial in a large academic tertiary care center with 18 inpatient internal medicine ward teams from January-April 2013. We randomized nine inpatient teams to an intervention where they received an education session standardizing who and how to handoff patients, with practice and feedback from facilitators. The control group of 9 teams continued usual non-standardized handoffs. The primary process outcome was the rate of patients handed over per 1000 patient nights. Other process outcomes included perceptions of inadequate handoff by overnight physicians, resource utilization overnight and hospital length of stay. Clinical outcomes included medical errors, frequency of patients requiring higher level of care overnight, and in-hospital mortality.The intervention group demonstrated a significant increase in the rate of patients handed over to the overnight physician (62.90/1000 person-nights vs. 46.86/1000 person-nights, p = 0.002). There was no significant difference in other process outcomes except resource utilization was increased in the intervention group (26.35/1000 person-days vs. 17.57/1000 person-days, p-value = 0.01). There was no significant difference between groups in medical errors (4.8% vs. 4.1%), need for higher level of care or in hospital mortality. Limitations include a dependence of accurate record keeping by the overnight physician, the possibility of cross-contamination in the handoff process, analysis at the cluster level and an overall low number of clinical events.Implementation of a multi-faceted resident handoff intervention did not result in a significant improvement in patient safety although did improve number of patients handed off. Novel methods to improve handoff need to be explored.Registered at ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01796756."

https://openalex.org/W2799517732,"The popularly known 20-80 rule or Pareto rule states that 20% of efforts leads to 80% of results. This rule has been applied to the study of infection transmission in contact networks, and specifically, contact networks between cattle farms. Woolhouse and collaborators showed that targeting interventions for disease control and prevention to the 20% of the farms that contribute the most to the basic reproduction number (Ro), could reduce it by 80%. The rule results from the number of incoming and outgoing contacts per farm being highly heterogeneous. Besides, Woolhouse and collaborators showed that this high contact heterogeneity, together with a high positive correlation between the number of incoming and outgoing animal movements per farm leads to an amplification in the Ro. Two previous studies carried out with Scottish cattle transport data found either no correlation or only a weak correlation (rho up to 0.33) when using weighted data. Using data from the contacts between Swiss cattle farms in 2015, we found that the 20-80 rule applies with respect to Ro, although the proportion of highly active farms is smaller (11%). Besides, a positive strong correlation (rho = 0.64, weighted data) between the incoming and outgoing contacts of farms exists. This means that the amplification of Ro (due to the contact heterogeneities and the existing correlation) in cattle contact networks can be much higher than known until now. Our results highlight the importance of an effective active surveillance, more so than in other countries were these amplification mechanisms are absent."
https://openalex.org/W2801064894,"Emergency physicians are at risk of infection during invasive procedures, and wearing a respirator can reduce this risk. The aim of this study was to determine whether the protection afforded by a respirator during intubation is affected by the type of airway device used. In this randomized crossover study, 26 emergency physicians underwent quantitative fit tests for a N95 respirator (cup-type or fold-type) before and during intubation with a direct laryngoscope, GlideScope®, or i-gel® airway device. The primary outcome was the fit factor value of the respirator and the secondary outcome was the level of acceptable protection provided (percentage of fit factor scores above 100). Compared with the GlideScope and i-gel device, the fit factor values and level of acceptable protection provided were lower when physicians wore the cup-type respirator while intubating using the direct laryngoscope (200 fit factor [152-200] and 200 fit factor [121.25-200] versus 166 fit factor [70-200], 100% and 100% versus 75%, respectively; all P < 0.001). There were no significant differences in the fit factor value or level of acceptable protection provided when the physicians wore the fold-type respirator while intubating using any of the three airway devices (all P > 0.05). The type of airway device used for endotracheal intubation may influence the protective performance of some types of respirators. Emergency physicians should consider the effects of airway device types on fit factor of N95 respirators, when they perform intubation at risk of infection."

https://openalex.org/W2800339592,"Individuals with flying phobia experience increases in subjective anxiety in response to flying-related cues. However, the cognitive processes that contribute to cue-reactive anxiety in individuals with flying-related anxiety remain poorly understood. Preliminary research suggests that changes in visual imagery and volitional control may contribute to this cue-reactive anxiety. Engaging in affect labelling during exposure therapy has been shown to reduce cue-reactive anxiety in individuals with fears relating to a variety of stimuli but has not been investigated in the fear of flying. The present study recruited 110 participants with a range of flying-related anxiety scores to complete an online cue-reactivity experiment. The study sought to evaluate whether an aversive flying cue triggered changes in imagery, volitional control and anxiety, and whether changes in imagery and volitional control predicted level of cue-reactive anxiety. Participants were randomly allocated to an affect labelling or non-affect labelling condition to additionally assess whether engaging in labelling one's emotion following exposure to an aversive flying cue would attenuate cue-reactive changes in anxiety relative to a group who did not. Significant cue-reactive changes in anxiety, and volitional control were observed from neutral to aversive flying cue were observed. After accounting for the effects of flying anxiety severity, only volitional control significantly improved the prediction of cue-reactive anxiety. Participants in the affect labelling condition reported significantly smaller increases in anxiety than the non-affect labelling group following exposure to the aversive flight cue. This is the first study to indicate affect labelling may help to regulate aspects of cue-reactive anxiety in response to aversive flying stimuli."
