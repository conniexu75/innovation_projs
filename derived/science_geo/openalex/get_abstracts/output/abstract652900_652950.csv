https://openalex.org/W3027065653,"Human eyes possess exceptional image-sensing characteristics such as an extremely wide field of view, high resolution and sensitivity with low aberration1. Biomimetic eyes with such characteristics are highly desirable, especially in robotics and visual prostheses. However, the spherical shape and the retina of the biological eye pose an enormous fabrication challenge for biomimetic devices2,3. Here we present an electrochemical eye with a hemispherical retina made of a high-density array of nanowires mimicking the photoreceptors on a human retina. The device design has a high degree of structural similarity to a human eye with the potential to achieve high imaging resolution when individual nanowires are electrically addressed. Additionally, we demonstrate the image-sensing function of our biomimetic device by reconstructing the optical patterns projected onto the device. This work may lead to biomimetic photosensing devices that could find use in a wide spectrum of technological applications. A biomimetic electrochemical eye is presented that has a hemispherical retina made from a high-density array of perovskite nanowires that are sensitive to light, mimicking the photoreceptors of a biological retina."
https://openalex.org/W3025439251,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) have a crucial role in the recognition of pathogens and initiation of immune responses1-3. Here we show that a previously uncharacterized protein encoded by CXorf21-a gene that is associated with systemic lupus erythematosus4,5-interacts with the endolysosomal transporter SLC15A4, an essential but poorly understood component of the endolysosomal TLR machinery also linked to autoimmune disease4,6-9. Loss of this type-I-interferon-inducible protein, which we refer to as 'TLR adaptor interacting with SLC15A4 on the lysosome' (TASL), abrogated responses to endolysosomal TLR agonists in both primary and transformed human immune cells. Deletion of SLC15A4 or TASL specifically impaired the activation of the IRF pathway without affecting NF-κB and MAPK signalling, which indicates that ligand recognition and TLR engagement in the endolysosome occurred normally. Extensive mutagenesis of TASL demonstrated that its localization and function relies on the interaction with SLC15A4. TASL contains a conserved pLxIS motif (in which p denotes a hydrophilic residue and x denotes any residue) that mediates the recruitment and activation of IRF5. This finding shows that TASL is an innate immune adaptor for TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9 signalling, revealing a clear mechanistic analogy with the IRF3 adaptors STING, MAVS and TRIF10,11. The identification of TASL as the component that links endolysosomal TLRs to the IRF5 transcription factor via SLC15A4 provides a mechanistic explanation for the involvement of these proteins in systemic lupus erythematosus12-14."
https://openalex.org/W3027390120,"Massive disk galaxies like the Milky Way are expected to form at late times in traditional models of galaxy formation, but recent numerical simulations suggest that such galaxies could form as early as a billion years after the Big Bang through the accretion of cold material and mergers. Observationally, it has been difficult to identify disk galaxies in emission at high redshift, in order to discern between competing models of galaxy formation. Here we report imaging, with a resolution of about 1.3 kiloparsecs, of the 158-micrometre emission line from singly ionized carbon, the far-infrared dust continuum and the near-ultraviolet continuum emission from a galaxy at a redshift of 4.2603, identified by detecting its absorption of quasar light. These observations show that the emission arises from gas inside a cold, dusty, rotating disk with a rotational velocity of 272 kilometres per second. The detection of emission from carbon monoxide in the galaxy yields a molecular mass that is consistent with the estimate from the ionized carbon emission of about 72 billion solar masses. The existence of such a massive, rotationally supported, cold disk galaxy when the Universe was only 1.5 billion years old favours formation through either cold-mode accretion or mergers, although its large rotational velocity and large content of cold gas remain challenging to reproduce with most numerical simulations."
https://openalex.org/W3025674417,"As members of the membrane-bound O-acyltransferase (MBOAT) enzyme family, acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferases (ACATs) catalyse the transfer of an acyl group from acyl-coenzyme A to cholesterol to generate cholesteryl ester, the primary form in which cholesterol is stored in cells and transported in plasma1. ACATs have gained attention as potential drug targets for the treatment of diseases such as atherosclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease and cancer2–7. Here we present the cryo-electron microscopy structure of human ACAT1 as a dimer of dimers. Each protomer consists of nine transmembrane segments, which enclose a cytosolic tunnel and a transmembrane tunnel that converge at the predicted catalytic site. Evidence from structure-guided mutational analyses suggests that acyl-coenzyme A enters the active site through the cytosolic tunnel, whereas cholesterol may enter from the side through the transmembrane tunnel. This structural and biochemical characterization helps to rationalize the preference of ACAT1 for unsaturated acyl chains, and provides insight into the catalytic mechanism of enzymes within the MBOAT family8. The structure of human ACAT1, which catalyses the transfer of an acyl group from acyl-coenzyme A to cholesterol to form cholesteryl ester, is resolved by cryo-electron microscopy."
https://openalex.org/W3026832158,"Trace elements and minerals are compounds that are essential for the support of a variety of biological functions and play an important role in the formation of and the defense against oxidative stress. Here we describe a technique, allowing sequential detection of the trace elements (K, Zn, Se, Cu, Mn, Fe, Mg) in serum and whole blood by an ICP-MS method using single work-up, which is a simple, quick and robust method for the sequential measurement and quantification of the trace elements Sodium (Na), Potassium (K), Calcium (Ca), Zinc (Zn), Selenium (Se), Copper (Cu), Iron (Fe), Manganese (Mn) and Magnesium (Mg) in whole blood as well as Copper (Cu), Selenium (Se), Zinc (Zn), Iron (Fe), Magnesium (Mg), Manganese (Mn), Chromium (Cr), Nickel (Ni), Gold (Au) and Lithium (Li) in human serum. For analysis, only 100 μl of serum or whole blood is sufficient, which make this method suitable for detecting trace element deficiency or excess in newborns and infants. All samples were processed and analyzed by ICP-MS (Agilent Technologies). The accuracy, precision, linearity and the limit of quantification (LOQ), Limit of Blank (LOB) and the limit of detection (LOD) of the method were assessed. Recovery rates were between 80-130% for most of the analyzed elements; repeatabilities (Cv %) calculated were below 15% for most of the measured elements. The validity of the proposed methodology was assessed by analyzing a certified human serum and whole blood material with known concentrations for all elements; the method described is ready for routine use in biomonitoring studies."
https://openalex.org/W3024205242,"Cholesterol is an essential component of mammalian cell membranes, constituting up to 50% of plasma membrane lipids. By contrast, it accounts for only 5% of lipids in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1. The ER enzyme sterol O-acyltransferase 1 (also named acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase, ACAT1) transfers a long-chain fatty acid to cholesterol to form cholesteryl esters that coalesce into cytosolic lipid droplets. Under conditions of cholesterol overload, ACAT1 maintains the low cholesterol concentration of the ER and thereby has an essential role in cholesterol homeostasis2,3. ACAT1 has also been implicated in Alzheimer’s disease4, atherosclerosis5 and cancers6. Here we report a cryo-electron microscopy structure of human ACAT1 in complex with nevanimibe7, an inhibitor that is in clinical trials for the treatment of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. The ACAT1 holoenzyme is a tetramer that consists of two homodimers. Each monomer contains nine transmembrane helices (TMs), six of which (TM4–TM9) form a cavity that accommodates nevanimibe and an endogenous acyl-coenzyme A. This cavity also contains a histidine that has previously been identified as essential for catalytic activity8. Our structural data and biochemical analyses provide a physical model to explain the process of cholesterol esterification, as well as details of the interaction between nevanimibe and ACAT1, which may help to accelerate the development of ACAT1 inhibitors to treat related diseases. The structure of human ACAT1 in complex with the inhibitor nevanimibe is resolved by cryo-electron microscopy."
https://openalex.org/W3027894868,"Conventional information processors freely convert information between different physical carriers to process, store, or transmit information. It seems plausible that quantum information will also be held by different physical carriers in applications such as tests of fundamental physics, quantum-enhanced sensors, and quantum information processing. Quantum-controlled molecules in particular could transduce quantum information across a wide range of quantum-bit (qubit) frequencies, from a few kHz for transitions within the same rotational manifold, a few GHz for hyperfine transitions, up to a few THz for rotational transitions, to hundreds of THz for fundamental and overtone vibrational and electronic transitions, possibly all within the same molecule. Here, we report the first demonstration of entanglement between states of the rotation of a $\rm^{40}CaH^+$ molecular ion and internal states of a $\rm^{40}Ca^+$ atomic ion. The qubit addressed in the molecule has a frequency of either 13.4 kHz or 855 GHz, highlighting the versatility of molecular qubits. This work demonstrates how molecules can transduce quantum information between qubits with different frequencies to enable hybrid quantum systems. We anticipate that quantum control and measurement of molecules as demonstrated here will create opportunities for quantum information science, quantum sensors, fundamental and applied physics, and controlled quantum chemistry."
https://openalex.org/W3027751864,"The hydrogen isotopes deuterium (D) and tritium (T) have become essential tools in chemistry, biology and medicine1. Beyond their widespread use in spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and mechanistic and pharmacokinetic studies, there has been considerable interest in incorporating deuterium into drug molecules1. Deutetrabenazine, a deuterated drug that is promising for the treatment of Huntington’s disease2, was recently approved by the United States’ Food and Drug Administration. The deuterium kinetic isotope effect, which compares the rate of a chemical reaction for a compound with that for its deuterated counterpart, can be substantial1,3,4. The strategic replacement of hydrogen with deuterium can affect both the rate of metabolism and the distribution of metabolites for a compound5, improving the efficacy and safety of a drug. The pharmacokinetics of a deuterated compound depends on the location(s) of deuterium. Although methods are available for deuterium incorporation at both early and late stages of the synthesis of a drug6,7, these processes are often unselective and the stereoisotopic purity can be difficult to measure7,8. Here we describe the preparation of stereoselectively deuterated building blocks for pharmaceutical research. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate a four-step conversion of benzene to cyclohexene with varying degrees of deuterium incorporation, via binding to a tungsten complex. Using different combinations of deuterated and proteated acid and hydride reagents, the deuterated positions on the cyclohexene ring can be controlled precisely. In total, 52 unique stereoisotopomers of cyclohexene are available, in the form of ten different isotopologues. This concept can be extended to prepare discrete stereoisotopomers of functionalized cyclohexenes. Such systematic methods for the preparation of pharmacologically active compounds as discrete stereoisotopomers could improve the pharmacological and toxicological properties of drugs and provide mechanistic information related to their distribution and metabolism in the body. Cyclohexene isotopologues and stereoisotopomers with varying degrees of deuteration are formed by binding a tungsten complex to benzene, which facilitates the selective incorporation of deuterium into any position on the ring."
https://openalex.org/W3028010284,"Introduction The maternal mortality rate in Indonesia is still quite high. It requires good knowledge for early prevention. The study aimed to analyze the determinants of knowledge of the pregnancy danger signs in Indonesia. Methods The samples used were 85,832 women of childbearing age (15–49 years old). The variables included understanding of danger signs of pregnancy, types of residence, age, education, employment, marital status, wealth, parity, the autonomy of health, current pregnancy status, and media exposure. The determinant was pointed out by using binary logistic regression. Results Urban women were 1.124 times more likely to understand the pregnancy danger signs of than rural women. Older women could identify pregnancy danger signs better than those aged 15–19 years. The more educated a woman is, the higher knowledge of the pregnancy danger signs she has. Married women or those who live with their partner were at 1.914 times likely to identify the pregnancy danger signs than unmarried ones or those who have never been in a relationship. If the wealth status gets higher, knowledge of the pregnancy danger signs will be better too. Grande multiparous women were at 0.815 times more likely to understand the pregnancy danger signs than primiparous. Women with the autonomy of health had 1.053 times chances to identify the pregnancy danger signs than those without autonomy. Women who were currently pregnant had 1.229 times better understanding of the pregnancy danger signs than women who were not currently pregnant. Media exposure had a good effect on women’s understanding of the pregnancy danger signs. Conclusion All variables tested were the determinants of knowledge of the pregnancy danger signs in Indonesia. These include residence, age, education, employment, marital status, wealth, parity, the autonomy of health, current pregnancy status, and media exposure."
https://openalex.org/W3026697676,"The use of naturalist mobile applications have dramatically increased during last years, and provide huge amounts of accurately geolocated species presences records. Integrating this novel type of data in species distribution models (SDMs) raises specific methodological questions. Presence-only SDM methods require background points, which should be consistent with sampling effort across the environmental space to avoid bias. A standard approach is to use uniformly distributed background points (UB). When multiple species are sampled, another approach is to use a set of occurrences from a Target-Group of species as background points (TGOB). We here investigate estimation biases when applying TGOB and UB to opportunistic naturalist occurrences. We modelled species occurrences and observation process as a thinned Poisson point process, and express asymptotic likelihoods of UB and TGOB as a divergence between environmental densities, in order to characterize biases in species niche estimation. To illustrate our results, we simulated species occurrences with different types of niche (specialist/generalist, typical/marginal), sampling effort and TG species density. We conclude that none of the methods are immune to estimation bias, although the pitfalls are different: For UB, the niche estimate fits tends towards the product of niche and sampling densities. TGOB is unaffected by heterogeneous sampling effort, and even unbiased if the cumulated density of the TG species is constant. If it is concentrated, the estimate deviates from the range of TG density. The user must select the group of species to ensure that they are jointly abundant over the broadest environmental sub-area."
https://openalex.org/W3027800213,"Alongside government driven management initiatives to achieve sustainable fisheries management, there remains a role for market-based mechanisms to improve fisheries outcomes. Market-based mechanisms are intended to create positive economic incentives that improve the status and management of fisheries. Research to understand consumer demand for certified fish is central but needs to be mirrored by supply side understanding including why fisheries decide to gain or retain certification and the impact of certification on them and other stakeholders involved. We apply semi-structured interviews in seven different Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) certified fisheries that operate in (or from) Western Australia with the aim of better understanding fisheries sector participation in certification schemes (the supply side) and the impacts and unintended benefits and costs of certification. We find that any positive economic impacts of certification were only realised in a limited number of MSC fisheries in Western Australia, which may be explained by the fact that only a small proportion of Western Australian state-managed fisheries are sold with the MSC label and ex-vessel or consumer market price premiums are therefore mostly not obtained. Positive impacts of certification in these Western Australian fisheries are more of a social and institutional nature, for example, greater social acceptability and increased efficiency in the governance process respectively. However, opinion is divided on whether the combined non-monetary and monetary benefits outweigh the costs."
https://openalex.org/W3026890701,"The Chinese government adheres to the innovation driven strategy and emphasizes that technological innovation is the strategic support for improving social productivity and comprehensive national strength. This paper discusses the mechanism of technological innovation and regional economic co-evolution, and constructs an index system to assess them based on the principles of synergy and systematics. The authors use a dynamic coupling model to study the law of the cooperative evolution of composite systems and geo-detector methods to reveal the main factors controlling the degree of coordination among them. The results show that the total factor productivity of China’s high-tech industry showed a ""W""-type trend of change from 2006 to 2016, and the other indices exhibited a volatile trend. The total factor productivity, technical efficiency, scale efficiency, pure technical efficiency, and technological progress increased by 37%, 13.3%, 3.9%, 9%, and 20.8%, respectively. There was a significant spatial difference in changes in total factor productivity, forming a core-edge spatial pattern with the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River as the center of concentration. Most of China’s technological innovation and regional economic complex systems were in a state of interactive development from 2007 to 2016, except in the three northeastern provinces of Zhejiang, Shanghai, and the western part of the country. The degree of coupling of the other provinces showed an increasing trend, and the overall degree of coupling exhibited the spatial pattern of Central > Eastern > Western > Northeastern. The three most influential factors for the degree of coupling of China’s provincial complex system were the gross domestic product, efficiency of technological innovation, and expenditure on research and development, whereas the three most important factors affecting the degree of coupling of complex systems were the efficiency of technological innovation, gross domestic product, and number of high-tech enterprises as well as research and development personnel, respectively, in the eastern, central, western, and northeastern regions. Finally, the paper puts forward the suggestions of regional innovation driven coordinated development, technology innovation and regional economic coordinated development, in order to provide reference for the high-quality economic development of developing countries."
https://openalex.org/W3026085232,"To evaluate the hormetic effect of glyphosate on Echinochloa colona, two pot studies were done in the screenhouse at the Gatton Campus, the University of Queensland, Australia. Glyphosate was sprayed at the 3–4 leaf stage using different doses [(0, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80 and 800 g a.e. ha-1) and (0, 2.5, 5, 10, 20 and 800 g a.e. ha-1)] in the first and second study, respectively. In the second study, two soil moistures (adequately-watered and water-stressed), and two E. colona biotypes, glyphosate-resistant and glyphosate-susceptible, were included. In both studies, plants that were treated with glyphosate at 2.5–40 g ha-1 grew taller and produced more leaves, tillers, inflorescences and seeds than the control treatment. In the first study, 5 g ha-1 glyphosate resulted in the maximum aboveground biomass (increase of 34% to 118%) compared with the control treatment. In the second study, the adequately-watered and glyphosate low dose treatments caused an increase in all the measured growth parameters for both biotypes. For example, total dry biomass was increased by 64% and 54% at 5 g ha-1 in the adequately-watered treatments for the resistant and susceptible biotypes, respectively, compared with the control treatment. All measured traits tended to decrease with increasing water stress and the stimulative growth of low doses of glyphosate could not compensate for the water stress effect. The results of both studies showed a hormetic effect of low doses of glyphosate on E. colona biotypes and such growth stimulation was significant in the range of 5 to 10 g ha-1 glyphosate. Water availability was found to be effective in modulating the stimulatory outcomes of glyphosate-induced hormesis. No significant difference was observed between the resistant and susceptible biotypes for hormesis phenomenon. The study showed the importance of precise herbicide application for suppressing weed growth and herbicide resistance evolution."
https://openalex.org/W3028427360,"Smoking, which is highly prevalent in HIV-infected populations, has been shown to exacerbate HIV replication, in part via the cytochrome P450 (CYP)-induced oxidative stress pathway. Recently, we have shown that extracellular vesicles (EVs), derived from tobacco- and/or HIV-exposed macrophages, alter HIV replication in macrophages by cell-cell interactions. We hypothesize that cigarette smoke condensate (CSC) and/or HIV-exposed macrophage-derived EVs carry relatively high levels of pro-oxidant and pro-inflammatory cargos and/or low levels of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory cargos, which are key mediators for HIV pathogenesis. Therefore, in this study, we investigated differential packaging of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines and pro- and anti-oxidant contents in EVs after CSC exposure to myeloid cells (uninfected U937 and HIV-infected U1 cells). Our results showed that relatively long to short exposures with CSC increased the expression of cytokines in EVs isolated from HIV-infected U1 macrophages. Importantly, pro-inflammatory cytokines, especially IL-6, were highly packaged in EVs isolated from HIV-infected U1 macrophages upon both long and short-term CSC exposures. In general, anti-inflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-10, had a lower packaging in EVs, while packaging of chemokines was mostly increased in EVs upon CSC exposure in both HIV-infected U1 and uninfected U937 macrophages. Moreover, we observed higher expression of CYPs (1A1 and 1B1) and lower expression of antioxidant enzymes (SOD-1 and catalase) in EVs from HIV-infected U1 macrophages than in uninfected U937 macrophages. Together, they are expected to increase oxidative stress factors in EVs derived from HIV-infected U1 cells. Taken together, our results suggest packaging of increased level of oxidative stress and inflammatory elements in the EVs upon exposure to tobacco constituents and/or HIV to myeloid cells, which would ultimately enhance HIV replication in macrophages via cell-cell interactions."
https://openalex.org/W3028101726,"This study investigated the generalized effects of positive feedback (PF) versus negative feedback (NF) during training on performance and sense of agency for a reach-to-touch task with a virtual hand. Virtual reality (VR) is increasingly employed for rehabilitation after neuromuscular traumas such as stroke and spinal cord injury. However, VR methods still need to be optimized for greater effectiveness and engagement to increase rates of clinical retention. In this study, we observed that training with disproportionate PF subsequently produced greater reaching performance (minimizing path length) and greater agency (perception of control) than with disproportionate NF. During PF training, there was also progressive increase in agency, but conversely a decrease in performance. Thus, the increase in performance after training may not be due to positively bolstered learning, but rather priming higher confidence reflected in greater agency. Agency was positively measured as compression in perceived time-intervals between the action of touch to a sound consequence, as standard with intentional binding paradigms. Positive feedback desirably increased agency (~180 msec) and reduced path length (1.8 cm) compared to negative feedback, which itself showed insignificant, or neutral, effects. Future investigations into optimizing virtual reality paradigms for neuromotor rehabilitation should consider agency as a driving factor for performance. These studies may serve to optimize how feedback is better presented with performance results for complex motor learning. Investigators should also ponder how personal characteristics, both cognitive and physical, may further affect sensitivity to feedback and the rate of neuromotor rehabilitation."
https://openalex.org/W3028374321,"The emergence of multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli has become a great challenge in treating nosocomial infections. The polymyxin antibiotic colistin is used as a 'last-line' therapy for such strains, but resistance to colistin is increasingly emerging all over the world. In this study, we investigated lipopolysaccharides (LPS) of colistin-resistant isolates and examined mutations in lpx genes in strains not harbouring mcr genes. We examined 351 clinical E. coli isolates with 38 showing reduced susceptibility to colistin. These isolates were collected from different clinical specimens including blood, urine, and wounds, but no stool. After confirmation of the isolates via a BD Phoenix-100 system (Becton Dickinson, USA), we performed antimicrobial susceptibility tests to characterize the resistance pattern of these isolates to different classes of antibiotics, using the disk diffusion test. The Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of colistin was determined using E-test strips. The presence of mobile colistin resistance (mcr-1 and mcr-2) genes was tested for all isolates. LPS (including lipid A) were extracted from all isolates and associated lpx genes analyzed by PCR and sequencing. Among the 38 clinical E. coli isolates with reduced susceptibility to colistin, 52% were resistant to colistin. The MICs of colistin ranged from 0.5 μg/ml to ˃256 μg/ml. Within the 20 colistin-resistant strains, six isolates carried the mcr-1 gene, but not mcr-2. Heterologous expression of the mcr-1 gene in susceptible E. coli DH5α increased the MIC of colistin by eight-fold. The remaining 14 isolates, were negative for both mcr genes. Six isolates were further negative for LPS production and five showed rough LPS phenotypes. Here we present evidence that loss of LPS or lipid A-deficiency can lead to colistin-resistance in clinical E. coli isolates not harbouring mcr genes."
https://openalex.org/W3026335732,"The information available through our senses is noisy, incomplete, and ambiguous. Our perceptual systems have to resolve this ambiguity to construct stable and reliable percepts. Previous EEG studies found large amplitude differences in two event-related potential (ERP) components 200 and 400 ms after stimulus onset when comparing ambiguous with disambiguated visual information (""ERP Ambiguity Effects""). These effects so far generalized across classical ambiguous figures from different visual categories at lower (geometry, motion) and intermediate (Gestalt perception) levels. The present study aimed to examine whether these ERP Effects are restricted to ambiguous figures or whether they also occur for different degrees of visibility. Smiley faces with low and high visibility of emotional expressions, as well as abstract figures with low and high visibility of a target curvature were presented. We thus compared ambiguity effects in geometric cube stimuli with visibility in emotional faces, and with visibility in abstract figures. ERP Effects were replicated for the geometric stimuli and very similar ERP Effects were found for stimuli with emotional face expressions but also for abstract figures. Conclusively, the ERP amplitude effects generalize across fundamentally different stimulus categories and show highly similar effects for different degrees of stimulus ambiguity and stimulus visibility. We postulate the existence of a high-level/meta-perceptual evaluation instance, beyond sensory details, that estimates the certainty of a perceptual decision. The ERP Effects may reflect differences in evaluation results."
https://openalex.org/W3028126263,"Conspicuous coloration is an important subject in social communication and animal behavior, and it can provide valuable insight into the role of visual signals in social selection. However, animal coloration can be plastic and affected by abiotic factors such as temperature, making its quantification problematic. In such cases, careful consideration is required so that metric choices are consistent across environments and least sensitive to abiotic factors. A detailed assessment of plastic trait in response to environmental conditions could help identify more robust methods for quantifying color. Temperature affects sexual ornamentation of eastern fence lizards, Sceloporus undulatus, with ventral coloration shifting from green to blue hues as temperatures rise, making the calculation of saturation (color purity) difficult under conditions where temperatures vary. We aimed to characterize how abiotic factors influence phenotypic expression and to identify a metric for quantifying animal color that is either independent from temperature (ideally) or best conserves individual’s ranks. We compared the rates of change in saturation across two temperature treatments using seven metrics: three that are based on fixed spectral ranges (with two of them designed by us specifically for this system) and three that track the expressed hue (with one of them designed by us to circumvent spurious results in unornamented individuals). We also applied a lizard visual sensitivity model to understand how temperature-induced color changes may be perceived by conspecifics. We show that the rate of change in saturation between two temperatures is inconsistent across individuals, increasing at a higher rate in individuals with higher baseline saturation at lower temperatures. In addition, the relative color rank of individuals in a population varies with the temperature standardized by the investigator, but more so for some metrics than others. While we were unable to completely eliminate the effect of temperature, current tools for quantifying color allowed us to use spectral data to estimate saturation in a variety of ways and to largely preserve saturation ranks of individuals across temperatures while avoiding erroneous color scores. We describe our approaches and suggest best-practices for quantifying and interpreting color, particularly in cases where color changes in response to environmental factors."
https://openalex.org/W3027846331,"Introduction Turkey is constitutionally secular with a Muslim majority. There is no legal basis for limiting life-support at the end-of-life (EOL) in Turkey. We aimed to investigate the opinions and attitudes of intensive care unit (ICU) physicians regarding EOL decisions, for both their patients and themselves, and to evaluate if the physicians’ demographic and professional variables predicted the attitudes of physicians toward EOL decisions. Methods An online survey was distributed to national critical care societies’ members. Physicians’ opinions were sought concerning legalization of EOL decisions for terminally ill patients or by patient-request regardless of prognosis. Participants physicians’ views on who should make EOL decisions and when they should occur were determined. Participants were also asked if they would prefer cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and/or intubation/mechanical ventilation (MV) personally if they had terminal cancer. Results A total of 613 physicians responded. Religious beliefs had no effect on the physicians’ acceptance of do-not-resuscitate (DNR) / do-not-intubate (DNI) orders for terminally ill patients, but atheism, was found to be an independent predictor of approval of DNR/DNI in cases of patient request (p<0.05). While medical experience (≥6 years in the ICU) was the independent predictor for the physicians’ approval of DNI decisions on patient demand, the volume of terminal patients in ICUs (between 10–50% per year) where they worked was an independent predictor of physicians’ approval of DNI for terminal patients. When asked to choose personal options in an EOL scenario (including full code, only DNR, only DNI, both DNR and DNI, and undecided), younger physicians (30–39 years) were more likely to prefer the ""only DNR"" option compared with physicians aged 40–49 years (p<0.05) for themselves and age 30–39 was an independent predictor of individual preference for ""only DNR” at the hypothetical EOL. Physicians from an ICU with <10% terminally ill patients were less likely to prefer ""DNR"" or ""DNR and DNI"" options for themselves at EOL compared with physicians who worked in ICUs with a higher (>50%) terminally ill patient ratio (p<0.05). Conclusion Most ICU physicians did not want legalization of DNR and DNI orders, based solely on patient request. Even if EOL decision-making were legal in Turkey, this attitude may conflict with patient autonomy. The proportion of terminally ill patients in the ICU appears to affect physicians’ attitudes to EOL decisions, both for their patients and by personal preference, an association which has not been previously reported."
https://openalex.org/W3026258112,"Background Recent evidence suggests a role for the gut microbiome in the development and progression of many diseases and many studies have been carried out to analyse the microbiome using a variety of methods. In this study, we compare MinION sequencing with meta-transcriptomics and amplicon-based sequencing for microbiome analysis of colorectal tumour tissue samples. Methods DNA and RNA were extracted from 11 colorectal tumour samples. 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and MinION sequencing was carried out using genomic DNA, and RNA-Sequencing for meta-transcriptomic analysis. Non-human MinION and RNA-Sequencing reads, and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing reads were taxonomically classified using a database built from available RefSeq bacterial and archaeal genomes and a k-mer based algorithm in Kraken2. Concordance between the three platforms at different taxonomic levels was tested on a per-sample basis using Spearman’s rank correlation. Results The average number of reads per sample using RNA-Sequencing was greater than 129 times that generated using MinION sequencing. However, the average read length of MinION sequences was more than 13 times that of RNA or 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Taxonomic assignment using 16S sequencing was less reliable beyond the genus level, and both RNA-Sequencing and MinION sequencing could detect greater numbers of phyla and genera in the same samples, compared to 16S sequencing. Bacterial species associated with colorectal cancer, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Parvimonas micra, Bacteroides fragilis and Porphyromonas gingivalis, were detectable using MinION, RNA-Sequencing and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing data. Conclusions Long-read sequences generated using MinION sequencing can compensate for low numbers of reads for bacterial classification. MinION sequencing can discriminate between bacterial strains and plasmids and shows potential as a cost-effective tool for rapid microbiome sequencing in a clinical setting."

In contrast, less is known about the emission and source of acetic acid (AA). In this study, Populus trichocarpa (California poplar) leaves in different developmental stages were desiccated and quantified for total meOH and AA emissions together with bulk cell wall acetylation and methylation content. While young leaves showed high emissions of meOH (140 μmol m-2) and AA (42 μmol m-2), emissions were reduced in mature (meOH: 69%, AA: 60%) and old (meOH: 83%, AA: 76%) leaves. In contrast, the ratio of AA/meOH emissions increased with leaf development (young: 35%, mature: 43%, old: 82%), mimicking the pattern of O-acetyl/methyl ester ratios of leaf bulk cell walls (young: 35%, mature: 38%, old: 51%), which is driven by an increase in O-acetyl and decrease in methyl ester content with age. The results are consistent with meOH and AA emission sources from cell wall de-esterification, with young expanding tissues producing highly methylated pectin that is progressively demethyl-esterified. We highlight the quantification of AA/meOH emission ratios as a potential tool for rapid phenotype screening of structural carbohydrate esterification patterns."
https://openalex.org/W3027970164,"Introduction Cadmium (Cd) is a heavy metal, which is widespread in the environment and has been hypothesized to be a metalloestrogen and a breast cancer risk factor. Mammographic density (MD) reflects the composition of the breast and was proposed to be used as a surrogate marker for breast cancer. The aim of our study was to investigate association between cadmium concentration in urine and mammographic density. Methods A cross-sectional study included 517 women aged 40–60 years who underwent screening mammography in Łódź, Poland. Data were collected through personal interviews and anthropometric measurements. Spot morning urine samples were obtained. The examination of the breasts included both craniocaudal and mediolateral oblique views. Raw data (“for processing”) generated by the digital mammography system were analysed using Volpara Imaging Software, The volumetric breast density(%) and fibrograndular tissue volume(cm3) were determined. Cadmium concentration in urine was analysed using the standard ICP-MS method. Results After adjusting for key confounders including age, BMI, family breast cancer, mammographic device, season of the year of mammography, and age at menarche, an inverse association of Cd and volumetric breast density was found, which was attenuated after further adjustment for smoking. Associations of Cd with dense volume were null. Conclusions These findings suggest that Cd is not positively associated with breast density, a strong marker of breast cancer risk, when examined in a cross-sectional fashion."
https://openalex.org/W3027402425,"Complex extracellular structures exist throughout phylogeny, but the dynamics of their formation and dissolution are often opaque. One example is the pharyngeal grinder of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, an extracellular structure that ruptures bacteria during feeding. During each larval transition stage, called lethargus, the grinder is replaced with one of a larger size. Here, we characterize at the ultrastructural level the deconstruction of the larval grinder and the construction of the adult grinder during the fourth larval stage (L4)-to-adult transition. Early in L4 lethargus, pharyngeal muscle cells trans-differentiate from contractile to secretory cells, as evidenced by the appearance of clear and dense core vesicles and disruptions in sarcomere organization. This is followed, within minutes, by the dissolution of the L4 grinder and the formation and maturation of the adult grinder. Components of the nascent adult grinder are deposited basally, and are separated from the dissolving larval grinder by a visible apical layer. The complete grinder is a lamellated extracellular matrix comprised of five layers. Following grinder formation, pharyngeal muscle cells regain ultrastructural contractile properties, and muscle contractions resume. Our findings add to our understanding of how complex extracellular structures assemble and dissemble."
https://openalex.org/W3027770240,"To explore and describe how healthcare policymakers and healthcare practitioners from different levels of Swedish healthcare perceived the everyday practice of putting national policies to contain antibiotic resistance into effect.A strategic sample of four healthcare policymakers, three healthcare practitioners working in hospital care, and six working in primary care were recruited and interviewed in person. A manifest and latent content analysis was carried out on the transcribed interview data.Analysis revealed how the everyday practice of containing antibiotic resistance in different healthcare levels could be perceived as successful, difficult, or a dilemma. The informants' perceptions are presented in three categories which describe first; informants' perceptions of antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance in Sweden; secondly, informants' perceptions of definable efforts in containing antibiotic resistance in Sweden, most notably responsible use of antibiotics, prevention of infection, improving public knowledge of antibiotic resistance, and international collaboration; and thirdly, informants' perceptions of problem areas in containing antibiotic resistance in Sweden, such as behavior, attitudes and knowledge among healthcare practitioners and the public, work environment, and resources. Reflection on the underlying meaning of these perceptions led to identification of the latent theme, labelled ""A sense of relative success, and many challenges yet to overcome"".This study has given in-depth insight into how a group of healthcare policymakers and practitioners perceived the everyday practice of containing antibiotic resistance, and revealed their perceptions of successful efforts to combat antibiotic resistance so far. It has identified problem areas in different healthcare levels, bringing to light challenges yet to overcome, and areas to focus on in future policies, most notably more emphasis on attitude and behavior change, and increasing awareness of antibiotic resistance among both healthcare practitioners and patients."
https://openalex.org/W3027778982,"Background Pre-payment and risk pooling schemes, central to the idea of universal health coverage, should protect households from catastrophic health expenditure and impoverishment; particularly when emergency care is required. Inadequate financial protection consequent on surgical emergencies occurs despite the existence of risk-pooling schemes. This study documented the experiences and coping strategies of slum and non-slum dwellers in a southwestern metropolis of Nigeria who had undergone emergency surgery. Methods In-depth interviews were conducted with 31 participants (13 slums dwellers, 18 non-slum dwellers) who had recently paid for emergency surgical care in Ibadan. Patients who had experienced catastrophic health expenditure from the use of emergency surgical care were identified and people who paid for the care were purposively selected for the interviews. Using an in-depth interview guide, information on the experiences and overall coping strategies during and after the hospitalization was collected. Data were analyzed inductively using the thematic approach. Results The mean age of the 31 participants (consisting of 7 men and 24 women) was 31 ± 5.6years. Apathy to savings limited the preparation for unplanned healthcare needs. Choice of hospital was determined by word of mouth, perceptions of good quality or prompt care and availability of staff. Social networks were relied on widely as a coping mechanism before and during the admission. Patients that were unable to pay experienced poor and humiliating treatment (in severe cases, incarceration). Inability to afford care was exacerbated by double billing and extraneous charges. It was opined that health care should be more affordable for all and that the current National Health Insurance Scheme, that was operating sub-optimally, should be strengthened appropriately for all to benefit. Conclusion The study highlights households’ poor attitude to health-related savings and pre-payment into a social solidarity fund to cover the costs of emergency surgical care. It also highlights the factors influencing costs of emergency surgical care and the role of social networks in mitigating the high costs of care. Improving financial protection from emergency surgical care would entail promoting a positive attitude to health-related savings, social solidarity and extending the benefits of social health insurance."
https://openalex.org/W2998013654,"The experience of being imitated is theorised to be a driving force of infant social cognition, yet evidence on the emergence of imitation recognition and the effects of imitation in early infancy is disproportionately scarce. To address this lack of empirical evidence, in a within-subjects study we compared the responses of 6-month old infants when exposed to ipsilateral imitation as opposed to non-imitative contingent responding. To examine mediating mechanisms of imitation recognition, infants were also exposed to contralateral imitation and bodily imitation with suppressed emotional mimicry. We found that testing behaviours—the hallmark of high-level imitation recognition—occurred at significantly higher rates in each of the imitation conditions compared to the contingent responding condition. Moreover, when being imitated, infants showed higher levels of attention, smiling and approach behaviours compared to the contingent responding condition. The suppression of emotional mimicry moderated these results, leading to a decrease in all social responsiveness measures. The results show that imitation engenders prosocial effects in 6-month old infants and that infants at this age reliably show evidence of implicit and high-level imitation recognition. In turn, the latter can be indicative of infants’ sensitivity to others’ intentions directed toward them."
https://openalex.org/W3025885341,"Reliable modelling of the dynamics of cancer morbidity risk is important, not least due to its significant impact on healthcare and related policies. We identify morbidity trends and regional differences in England for all-cancer and type-specific incidence between 1981 and 2016. We use Bayesian modelling to estimate cancer morbidity incidence at various age, year, gender, and region levels. Our analysis shows increasing trends in most rates and marked regional variations that also appear to intensify through time in most cases. All-cancer rates have increased significantly, with the highest increase in East, North West and North East. The absolute difference between the rates in the highest- and lowest-incidence region, per 100,000 people, has widened from 39 (95% CI 33-45) to 86 (78-94) for females, and from 94 (85-104) to 116 (105-127) for males. Lung cancer incidence for females has shown the highest increase in Yorkshire and the Humber, while for males it has declined in all regions with the highest decrease in London. The gap between the highest- and lowest-incidence region for females has widened from 47 (42-51) to 94 (88-100). Temporal change in in bowel cancer risk is less manifested, with regional heterogeneity also declining. Prostate cancer incidence has increased with the highest increase in London, and the regional gap has expanded from 33 (30-36) to 76 (69-83). For breast cancer incidence the highest increase has occurred in North East, while the regional variation shows a less discernible increase. The analysis reveals that there are important regional differences in the incidence of all-type and type-specific cancers, and that most of these regional differences become more pronounced over time. A significant increase in regional variation has been demonstrated for most types of cancer examined here, except for bowel cancer where differences have narrowed."
https://openalex.org/W3027760840,"The factors that determine Serum Thyrotropin (TSH) levels have been examined through different methods, using different covariates. However, the use of machine learning methods has so far not been studied in population databases like NHANES (National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey) to predict TSH. In this study, we performed a comparative analysis of different machine learning methods like Linear regression, Random forest, Support vector machine, multilayer perceptron and stacking regression to predict TSH and classify individuals with normal, low and high TSH levels. We considered Free T4, Anti-TPO antibodies, T3, Body Mass Index (BMI), Age and Ethnicity as the predictor variables. A total of 9818 subjects were included in this comparative analysis. We used coefficient of determination (r2) value to compare the results for predicting the TSH and show that the Random Forest, Gradient Boosting and Stacking Regression perform equally well in predicting TSH and achieve the highest r2 value = 0.13, with mean absolute error of 0.78. Moreover, we found that Anti-TPO is the most important feature in predicting TSH followed by Age, BMI, T3 and Free-T4 for the regression analysis. While classifying TSH into normal, high or low levels, our comparative analysis also shows that Random forest performs the best in the classification study, performed with individuals with normal, high and low levels of TSH. We found the following Areas Under Curve (AUC); for low TSH, AUC = 0.61, normal TSH, AUC = 0.61 and elevated TSH AUC = 0.69. Additionally, we found that Anti-TPO was the most important feature in classifying TSH. In this study, we suggest that artificial intelligence and machine learning methods might offer an insight into the complex hypothalamic-pituitary -thyroid axis and may be an invaluable tool that guides us in making appropriate therapeutic decisions (thyroid hormone dosing) for the individual patient."
https://openalex.org/W3028455333,"The environment within the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) influences Insulin biogenesis. In particular, ER stress may contribute to the development of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) and Cystic Fibrosis Related Diabetes (CFRD), where evidence of impaired Insulin processing, including elevated secreted Proinsulin/Insulin ratios, are observed. Our group has established the role of a novel ER chaperone ERp29 (ER protein of 29 kDa) in the biogenesis of the Epithelial Sodium Channel, ENaC. The biogenesis of Insulin and ENaC share may key features, including their potential association with COP II machinery, their cleavage into a more active form in the Golgi or later compartments, and their ability to bypass such cleavage and remain in a less active form. Given these similarities we hypothesized that ERp29 is a critical factor in promoting the efficient conversion of Proinsulin to Insulin. Here, we confirmed that Proinsulin associates with the COP II vesicle cargo recognition component, Sec24D. When Sec24D expression was decreased, we observed a corresponding decrease in whole cell Proinsulin levels. In addition, we found that Sec24D associates with ERp29 in co-precipitation experiments and that ERp29 associates with Proinsulin in co-precipitation experiments. When ERp29 was overexpressed, a corresponding increase in whole cell Proinsulin levels was observed, while depletion of ERp29 decreased whole cell Proinsulin levels. Together, these data suggest a potential role for ERp29 in regulating Insulin biosynthesis, perhaps in promoting the exit of Proinsulin from the ER via Sec24D/COPII vesicles."
https://openalex.org/W3026083290,"We assessed the association between metabolic health and markers of inflammation and of endothelial dysfunction using data from the Ewha Birth and Growth Cohort Study. The data of 195 subjects aged 13–15 years were analyzed. To assess metabolic syndrome, continuous metabolic syndrome (cMets) scores were calculated. We measured the levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) as markers of inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. An increase of one SD in the cMets score resulted in a 1.25-fold (95% CI 1.10–1.42) increase in the risk of acute inflammatory status and a 1.26-fold (95% CI 1.11–1.43) increase in the risk of endothelial dysfunction as defined by ICAM-1, while VCAM-1 showed a meaningless trend. Of the metabolic components, body mass index (BMI) was positively associated with elevated hs-CRP levels and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) levels were negatively associated with elevated ICAM-1 levels. Additionally, a mediation analysis showed that a high BMI was directly related to elevated hs-CRP levels and indirectly related to elevated ICAM-1 levels via HDL-c. Our findings show that poor metabolic health was related to an unfavorable inflammatory status and endothelial dysfunction in adolescents."
https://openalex.org/W3026139089,"Introduction One out of every 5 elderly patients will suffer a distal radius fracture and these injuries are often related to poor bone health. Several surgical subspecialties have demonstrated that pre-injury activity level can impact patient outcomes. To determine the importance of physical activity, we examined the relationship between pre-injury activity and patient-reported and functional outcomes among fracture patients. Methods This is a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from participants enrolled in the Wrist and Radius Injury Surgical Trial (WRIST) from April 10, 2012 to December 31, 2016. This study included 304 adults, 60 years or older with isolated unstable distal radius fractures; 187 were randomized to one of three surgical treatments and 117 opted for casting. Participants opting for surgery were randomized to receive volar locking plate, percutaneous pinning, or external fixation. Participants who chose not to have surgery were treated with casting. All participants were stratified prior to analysis into highly and less-active groups based on pre-injury Rapid Assessment of Physical Activity Scores. Results 280 patients had 12-month assessments of outcomes. Highly active participants scored 8 and 5 points greater on the Michigan Hand Questionnaire at 6 weeks and 3 months respectively, p<0.05. Highly active participants demonstrated greater grip strength at the 3-month (p = 0.017) and 6-month (p = 0.007) time-points. Highly active participants treated with volar locking plate scored 10+ points greater on the Michigan Hand Questionnaire compared to the less-active group at the 6-week (p = 0.032), 3-month (p = 0.009) and 12-month (0.004) time points, with an effect size larger than 0.50, suggesting pre-injury level of activity had a significant clinical impact. Conclusions Higher levels of pre-injury activity are predictive of patient-reported and functional outcomes following distal radius fracture. Because of the greater PROs, the early mobility and lower risk of hardware infection reported in the literature, volar plating is preferable to other treatments for highly active patients who request and meet indications for surgery.

https://openalex.org/W3027179982,"Health systems routinely implement changes to the design of electronic health records (EHRs). Physician behavior may vary in response and methods to identify this variation could help to inform future interventions. The objective of this study was to phenotype primary care physician practice patterns and evaluate associations with response to an EHR nudge for influenza vaccination.During the 2016-2017 influenza season, 3 primary care practices at Penn Medicine implemented an active choice intervention in the EHR that prompted medical assistants to template influenza vaccination orders for physicians to review during the visit. We used latent class analysis to identify physician phenotypes based on 9 demographic, training, and practice pattern variables, which were obtained from the EHR and publicly available sources. A quasi-experimental approach was used to evaluate response to the intervention relative to control practices over time in each of the physician phenotype groups. For each physician latent class, a generalized linear model with logit link was fit to the binary outcome of influenza vaccination at the patient visit level. The sample comprised 45,410 patients with a mean (SD) age of 58.7 (16.3) years, 67.1% were white, and 22.1% were black. The sample comprised 56 physicians with mean (SD) of 24.6 (10.2) years of experience and 53.6% were male. The model segmented physicians into groups that had higher (n = 41) and lower (n = 15) clinical workloads. Physicians in the higher clinical workload group had a mean (SD) of 818.8 (429.1) patient encounters, 11.6 (4.7) patient appointments per day, and 4.0 (1.1) days per week in clinic. Physicians in the lower clinical workload group had a mean (SD) of 343.7 (129.0) patient encounters, 8.0 (2.8) patient appointments per day, and 3.1 (1.2) days per week in clinic. Among the higher clinical workload group, the EHR nudge was associated with a significant increase in influenza vaccination (adjusted difference-in-difference in percentage points, 7.9; 95% CI, 0.4-9.0; P = .01). Among the lower clinical workload group, the EHR nudge was not associated with a significant difference in influenza vaccination rates (adjusted difference-in-difference in percentage points, -1.0; 95% CI, -5.3-5.8; P = .90).A model-based approach categorized physician practice patterns into higher and lower clinical workload groups. The higher clinical workload group was associated with a significant response to an EHR nudge for influenza vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W3027861655,"Citrus trees produce flushes throughout the year, but there are no criteria established for a precise shoot monitoring in orchards under tropical climate. Methods for quantification of flush dynamics would be useful for horticultural and pest management studies because different insect vectors feed and reproduce on flushes. We estimated the minimum number and distribution of trees for sampling and determined the flushing pattern over time in ‘Valencia Late’ orange trees grafted onto ‘Swingle’ citrumelo rootstock. Shoots within a square frame (0.25 m2) on two sides of the canopy were counted and classified by their phenological stage. The minimum number of samples was estimated using the mean number of shoots and area under the flush shoot dynamics (AUFSD). The temporal and spatial distribution analysis was performed by Taylor’s power law and by multiple correspondence analysis (MCA). Additionally, a shoot maturity index (SMI) based on visual qualitative assessment of flushes is proposed. Considering the mean number of shoots, it was necessary to sample two sides of 16 trees to reach a relative sampling error (Er) of 25%, whereas by the AUFSD, only five trees were necessary to reach an Er of 10%. Flushes were predominantly randomly distributed over time and space. Testing eight transects, sampled trees should be distributed throughout the block, avoiding sampling concentration in a certain area. MCA showed that the west side and the upper sampling positions of trees were more likely to be associated with younger shoots. AUFSD and the evaluation of both sides of the canopy yielded a smaller number of trees to be assessed. The SMI was a reliable metric to estimate the shoot phenology of orange trees, and correlated well (R2 > 70%) with the mean number of shoots within the square frame. Therefore, SMI has the potential to make shoot monitoring in the field more practical."
https://openalex.org/W3028276329,"The decline in circulatory function with aging may be alleviated by a combination of gingival massage (physical stimulation) and mechanical cleaning. Several studies have reported the systemic effect of physical stimulation on various parts of the body, including its therapeutic effect on pain in the neck and shoulders that becomes evident with age, and improvement in blood circulation. In contrast, few studies have reported on the changes in gingival microcirculation induced by gingival massage, while no previous study has evaluated the effect of gingival microcirculation on age-related changes in the hemodynamics of the oral cavity. This study aimed to investigate how gingival massage affects age-related changes in gingival microcirculation. Male Wistar rats (7-week, 6-month and 1-year old) were prepared for a gingival massage group and a control group. Mechanical stimulation was applied on the maxillary molar gingiva for 5 seconds twice a week for 4 weeks. Subsequently, gingival reactive hyperemia was measured using a laser Doppler flowmeter. In addition, morphological analyses were also performed by hematoxylin and eosin and Indian ink staining and a vascular resin cast model. Base Flow, maximum response (Peak), and time required for the maximum response to halve (T1/2) were reduced in 1-year-old rats compared with the other age groups. In the mechanical stimulated group, T1/2 was increased in 7-week, 6-month, and 1-year-old rats, and total blood flow (Mass) was increased in 6-month and 1-year-old rats. In addition, clear blood vessel networks and loop-like revascularization were only observed in the mechanical stimulated group. Changes in age-related decline in gingival microcirculatory function and vascular construction were reported in this study, and the results suggested that gingival massage activates both the functional and morphological aspects of gingival microcirculation and may be effective for maintaining oral health."
https://openalex.org/W3026115120,"Objective The SI gene encodes the sucrase-isomaltase enzyme, a disaccharidase expressed in the intestinal brush border. Hypomorphic SI variants cause recessive congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency (CSID) and related gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. Among children presenting with chronic, idiopathic loose stools, we assessed the prevalence of CSID-associated SI variants relative to the general population and the relative GI symptom burden associated with SI genotype within the study population. Methods A prospective study conducted at 18 centers enrolled 308 non-Hispanic white children ≤18 years old who were experiencing chronic, idiopathic, loose stools at least once per week for >4 weeks. Data on demographics, GI symptoms, and genotyping for 37 SI hypomorphic variants were collected. Race/ethnicity-matched SI data from the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) database was used as the general population reference. Results Compared with the general population, the cumulative prevalence of hypomorphic SI variants was significantly higher in the study population (4.5% vs. 1.3%, P < .01; OR = 3.5 [95% CI: 6.1, 2.0]). Within the study population, children with a hypomorphic SI variant had a more severe GI symptom burden than those without, including: more frequent episodes of loose stools (P < .01), higher overall stool frequency (P < .01), looser stool form (P = .01) and increased flatulence (P = .02). Conclusion Non-Hispanic white children with chronic idiopathic loose stools have a higher prevalence of CSID-associated hypomorphic SI variants than the general population. The GI symptom burden was greater among the study subjects with a hypomorphic SI variant than those without hypomorphic SI variants."

The long term management of patients with dTGCT treated with TKI is however not known.We conducted a retrospective single center study on the 39 patients with advanced and/or inoperable dTGCT referred to the Centre Leon Berard for a medical treatment. The clinical characteristics and treatments of patients who had received at least one line of CSF1R TKI or Ab was collected from the electronic patient records and analyzed, after this study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Centre Leon Berard. Statistics were conducted using SPSS 23.0.Thirty-nine patients received at least one line of TKI among the 101 patients with histologically confirmed dTGCT refered to this center. Imatinib, nilotinib, pexidartinib, emactuzumab were the most frequently used agents. First line treatment was given for a median duration of 7 months. With a median follow-up from the initiation of TKI of 30 months, the progression-free rate at 30 months is 56% for the 39 patients. 15 patients had recurrent disease after first line CSF1R inhibitor: 12 (80%) received a 2nd line treatment for a median duration of 6 months and a median time to progression (TTP) of 12 months. Six patients had afterwards a recurrent disease and 5 (83%) received a 3rd line treatment for a median duration of 5 months and a median TTP of 9 months. Progression-free rate at 30 months was observed in 3 of 12 (25%) after line 2 and 1 of 5 (20%) after line 3. None of the patients refered died with a median follow-up of 67 months.CSF1R TKI or Ab provide prolonged tumor control and symptom relief for a majority of patients with inoperable or relapsing dTGCT, in first and subsequent lines. Multiple lines are required for close to 50% of patients with relapsing dTGCT."
https://openalex.org/W3028410253,"The gently inclined medium-thick orebody is generally viewed as difficult to extract. This paper presents a sublevel open stoping using long-hole with back filling method, particularly for inclined medium-thick orebodies. This method not only changes the temporal sequence of ore stoping and realizes transportation using gravity and trackless devices, but also improves production capacity and efficiency. Nonetheless, this method also has some disadvantages; for example, the orebody has more contact with country rock, and the method has a more complex loss and dilution process. This paper starts with the analysis of the results of physical simulation experiments that examine the interactive relationship among the lower stope footwall dip angle, the footwall surface roughness, draw point interval and production blast ring and concludes their influence on the ore-recovery ratio in each production cycle. Secondly, based on physical simulation results, the multivariate linear fit was carried out on the SPSS using the dimensional analysis method. Thus a statistical model was developed for investigating the influence of gently inclined medium thick orebody, the footwall dip angle, the footwall roughness and interval of draw points on the recovery ratio, which can accurately forecast the ore-recovery ratio under different parameters in the physical simulation process. The optimal structural parameters obtained from physical simulation and statistical analysis was then applied to industrial experiments. Based on the 3D laser scanning during in-suit experiments, it was found that the lower stope had an 82% recovery ratio and an 18% dilution ratio, while the upper stope had a recovery ratio of 85% and a dilution ratio of 12%. Moreover, the production capacity could be up to 600t/d. The physical simulation and industrial experiments both demonstrate that the new mining method can be adopted for the safe and efficient mining of gently inclined medium-thick orebodies."
https://openalex.org/W3026192569,"We studied a Posner-type gaze-cued version of a Simon task to characterize age-related changes in visuospatial attention and inhibitory control. Earlier results had indicated that the direction of gaze is a strong social cue that speeds response times; so we wondered whether, as a task-irrelevant stimulus, it could compensate for age-related impairment of inhibitory processes in the elderly. Our results assessed the Simon effect by: reaction time, error rate, the P3 component and the lateralized readiness potential (LRP). We found that the Simon effect was larger in the older group confirming an increased sensitivity to interference and also suggesting a decreased inhibitory control in older adults. LRP results showed that aging and stimulus-response incongruency delayed the selection of the responses-indexed by longer s-LRP latency data-, and also decreased the efficiency of motor inhibition in the Simon task-the s-LRP amplitude of both wrong- and correct-side activation was larger in older adults, and the latency difference of these two components was longer in this age-group. Also a larger N2pc amplitude in the congruent, compared to incongruent gaze condition, showed an increased visuospatial attention when the gaze-cueing drew attention to the target stimulus. This gaze-cueing could not be ignored and hence it modified task processing in the older age group, which was evident in the incongruent Simon condition where the congruent gaze increased older adults' reaction time and their error rate; but there was no difference observed in the congruent Simon condition. Since the anticipated facilitation of reaction times did not occur, we suggest that general slowing and decreased inhibitory functions in the elderly caused the social cue not to be a supporting stimulus but rather to be a further burden on their cognitive processing."
https://openalex.org/W3028422592,"Patterned cell culturing is one of the most useful techniques for understanding the interaction between geometric conditions surrounding cells and their behaviors. The authors previously proposed a simple method for cell patterning with an agarose gel microstructure fabricated by microcasting with a degassed polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) mold. Although the vacuum pressure produced from the degassed PDMS can drive a highly viscous agarose solution, the influence of solution viscosity on the casting process is unknown. This study investigated the influences of micro-channel dimensions or solution viscosity on the flow of the solution in a micro-channel of a PDMS mold by both experiments and numerical simulation. It was found experimentally that the degassed PDMS mold was able to drive a solution with a viscosity under 575 mPa·s. A simulation model was developed which can well estimate the flow rate in various dimensions of micro-channels. Cross-linked albumin has low viscosity (1 mPa·s) in aqueous solution and can undergo a one-way dehydration process from solution to solid that produces cellular repellency after dehydration. A microstructure of cross-linked albumin was fabricated on a cell culture dish by the microcasting method. After cells were seeded and cultivated on the cell culture dish with the microstructure for 7 days, the cellular pattern of mouse skeletal myoblast cell line C2C12 was observed. The microcasting with cross-linked albumin solution enables preparation of patterned cell culture systems more quickly in comparison with the previous agarose gel casting, which requires a gelation process before the dehydration process."

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients attending the Hospital for Tropical Diseases (HTD), Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, to define the effectiveness of DAAs in the treatment of chronic HCV genotype 6 in actual practice. Methods We included all patients with genotype 6 infections attending our hospital between March 2016 and October 2017 who received treatment with sofosbuvir-based DAA treatment regimens, and compared their responses with those with genotype 1 infections. Results 1758 patients (1148 genotype 6, 65.4%; 610 genotype 1, 34.6%) were analyzed. The majority of patients (1480, 84.2%) received sofosbuvir/ledipasvir (SOF/LDV) ± ribavirin (RBV); 278 (15.8%) received sofosbuvir/Daclatasvir (SOF/DCV) ± RBV. The median age of the patients was 57 years, (interquartile range (IQR) 46–64 years) The baseline HCV viral load (log IU/ml) was significantly higher in patients infected with genotype 6 compared with those infected with genotype 1 (6.8, 5.3–6.6 versus 6.3, 5.3–6.5 log10 IU/ml, p = <0.001, Mann Whitney U test). A sustained virological response (SVR), defined as an undetectable viral load measured between 12 and 24 weeks after completing treatment, and indicating cure, was seen in 97.3% (1711/1758) of patients. Treatment failure, defined as HCV viral load ≥15 IU/ml ≥12 weeks after completing treatment appeared to be more frequent in patients infected with genotype 6 virus (3.2%, 37/1148) than in those infected with genotype 1 (1.7%, 10/610), p = 0.050 chi-squared test). We found no evidence that patient’s age, gender, liver cirrhosis, diabetes, HBV or HIV coinfection, prior treatment failure with pegylated interferon therapy, body mass index (BMI), aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index (APRI), or fibrosis 4 (FIB-4) index were associated with treatment failure. Conclusions Our study suggests that patients with HCV genotype 6 infection in Vietnam may respond less well to treatment with sofosbuvir based DAAs than patients with genotype 1 infections. Further studies are needed to confirm this observation and to define whether it is driven by genotype-specific mutations."
https://openalex.org/W3027133782,"Reduced exercise capacity is common in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) and chronic smokers and is suggested to be related to skeletal muscle dysfunction. Previous studies using human muscle biopsies have shown fiber-type shifting in chronic smokers particularly those with COPD. These results, however, are confounded with aging effects because people with COPD tend to be older. In the present study, we implemented an acute 7-day cigarette smoke-exposed model using Sprague-Dawley rats to evaluate early effects of cigarette smoking on soleus muscles. Rats (n = 5 per group) were randomly assigned to either a sham air (SA) or cigarette smoking (CS) groups of three different concentrations of total particulate matters (TPM) (CSTPM2.5, CSTPM5, CSTPM10). Significantly lower percentages of type I and higher type IIa fiber were detected in the soleus muscle in CS groups when compared with SA group. Of these, only CSTMP10 group exhibited significantly lower citrate synthase activity and higher muscle tumor necrosis factor-α level than that of SA group. Tumor necrosis factor-α level was correlated with the percentage of type I and IIa fibers. However, no significant between-group differences were found in fiber cross-sectional area, physical activities, or lung function assessments. In conclusion, acute smoking may directly trigger the onset of glycolytic fiber type shift in skeletal muscle independent of aging."
https://openalex.org/W3027211787,"Many insects show discontinuous respiration with three phases, open, closed, and fluttering, in which the spiracles open and close rapidly. The relative durations of the three phases and the rate of fluttering during the flutter phase vary for individual insects depending on developmental stage and activity, vary between insects of the same species, and vary even more between different species. We studied how the rate of oxygen uptake during the flutter phase depends on the rate of fluttering. Using a mathematical model of oxygen diffusion in the insect tracheal system, we derive a formula for oxygen uptake during the flutter phase and how it depends on the length of the tracheal system, percentage of time open during the flutter phase, and the flutter rate. Surprisingly, our results show that an insect can have its spiracles closed a high percentage of time during the flutter phase and yet receive almost as much oxygen as if the spiracles were always open, provided the spiracles open and close rapidly. We investigate the respiratory gain due to fluttering for four specific insects. Our formula shows that respiratory gain increases with body size and with increased rate of fluttering. Therefore, insects can regulate their rate of oxygen uptake by varying the rate of fluttering while keeping the spiracles closed during a large fraction of the time during the flutter phase. We also use a mathematical model to show that water loss is approximately proportional to the percentage of time the spiracles are open. Thus, insects can achieve both high oxygen intake and low water loss by keeping the spiracles closed most of the time and fluttering while open, thereby decoupling the challenge of preventing water loss from the challenge of obtaining adequate oxygen uptake."
https://openalex.org/W3027423778,"Access to antiretroviral treatment has improved the life expectancy of HIV-positive patients, most often associated with a desire to limit childbearing. Women living with HIV (WLHIV) commonly have unmet need for contraception and could be at risk of unintended pregnancy. Preventing unintended pregnancies among women living with HIV are effective strategies to eliminate mother-to-child transmission of HIV.The aim of this study was to assess unmet need for limiting childbirth and its associated factors among women living with HIV in Togo.This facility based cross-sectional study was conducted, between June and August 2016, among WLHIV in their reproductive age (15-49 years) in HIV-care settings in Centrale and Kara regions Data was collected using a structured and pretested questionnaire. WLHIV who desired to limit childbirth but not using contraception were considered to have unmet need of birth limitations. Univariate and multivariate Poisson regression models with robust variance were performed to identify associated factors with unmet needs. A multi-model averaging approach was used to estimate the degree of the association between these factors and the unmet need of birth limitations.A total of 443 WLHIV were enrolled, with mean age of 34.5 years (standard deviation [SD] = 7.0). Among them 244 (55.1%) were in couple and 200 (45.1%) had at least the secondary level of education. 39.1% were followed-up in a private healthcare facility. At the time of the survey, 40.0% did not desire childbearing but only 9.0% (95% CI [6.7-12.1]) of them expressed unmet needs for limiting childbirth. In multivariable analysis, associated factors with unmet needs of birth limitations were: being aged 35 years or more (adjusted prevalence ratio (aPR) = 3.11, 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) [1.52-6.38]), living in couple (aPR = 2.32 [1.15-4.65]), living in Kara region (aPR = 0.10 [0.01-0.76]), being followed in a private healthcare facility (aPR = 0.08[0.01-0.53]) and having severe HIV symptoms (aPR = 3.50 [1.31-9.37]).Even though the unmet need for births limitation was relatively low among WLHIV in Togo, interventions to improve more access to contraceptive methods, and targeting 35 to 49 years old women, those in couple or followed in the public healthcare facilities would contribute to the eradication of mother-to-child transmission of HIV."
https://openalex.org/W3027680904,"Dalbergia odorifera T. Chen seedlings do not grow well in the typical red soils of tropical regions. Eighteen culture substances filled with different substrate combinations and proportions of red soil, coconut coir powder, deciduous leaf powder, and sand were used as to determine their effects on the growth, root system development, dry matter accumulation and allocation, leaf relative electrolyte leakage, chlorophyll content, root superoxide dismutase activity, root malondialdehyde content, and total soluble sugar content of D. odorifera. Results demonstrated that different substrate combinations and proportions had different effects on the performance of D. odorifera. All mixed substrates were better than any single substrate. The suitable substrate combinations and proportions of sand, coconut coir powder, and deciduous leaf powder mixed with red soil improved the growth, root architecture, and physiological characteristics of D. odorifera seedling. For example, groups C1-2 (coconut coir/red soil = 2/2, v/v, the same below) and C3-2 (red soil/sand = 2/2) exerted the best effects on plant growth and biomass accumulation. Groups C1-2, C2-2 (deciduous leaf powder/red soil = 2/2), and C3-2 remarkably enhanced root system development. Group C6 (coconut coir/red soil/sand = 1/1/1) substantially promoted root nodule development. Group C3-1 (red soil/sand = 3/1) exhibited the best effects on physiological characteristics. On the basis of the comprehensive evaluation of Euclid's multidimensional space mathematical model, we found that the suitable substrate combinations followed the order of C1-2 > C3-1 > C2-2. This research provides scientific guidance for the proper seedling culture of D. odorifera and the rational utilization of solid wastes such as coconut coir and deciduous leaves of Ficus elastica."
https://openalex.org/W3028464905,"Prior work has shown that humans can successfully identify letters that are constructed with a sparse array of dots, wherein the dot pattern reflects the strokes that would normally be used to fashion a given letter. In the present work the dots were briefly displayed, one at a time in sequence, varying the spatial order in which they were shown. A forward sequence was spatially ordered as though one were passing a stroke across the dots to connect them. Experiments compared this baseline condition to the following three conditions: a) the dot sequence was spatially ordered, but in the reverse direction from how letter strokes might normally be written; b) the dots in each stroke of the letter were displayed in a random order; c) the sequence of displayed dots were chosen for display from any location in the letter. Significant differences were found between the baseline condition and all three of the comparison conditions, with letter recognition being far worse for the random conditions than for conditions that provided consistent spatial ordering of dot sequences. These findings show that spatial order is critical for integration of shape cues that have been sequentially displayed."
https://openalex.org/W3027778103,"Transplantation of cultured epidermal cell sheets (CES) can be life-saving for patients with large area burns. CES have also been successfully used to regenerate eye and urethral epithelia in animal models. Short-term storage aims to extend the transplantation window, offers flexibility in timing surgery and allows testing of CES quality, phenotype and sterility. This study investigated extended CES storage and explored the effect of additional re-incubation recovery time following storage. The proliferative quality of stored confluent versus pre-confluent CES was also investigated using functional testing. CES were stored at 12°C and results compared to non-stored control CES. Investigation of timepoints during 15 days storage revealed that viability began to deteriorate by day 11 and was associated with increased lactate in the storage medium. The percentage of apoptotic cells also significantly increased by day 11. Flow cytometry analysis of integrin β1 expression and cell size indicated best retention of stem cells at 7 days of storage. Functional testing of pre-confluent and confluent cells following 7 days storage showed that pre-confluent cells responded well to 1-day re-incubation after storage; they became highly prolific, increasing in number by ~67%. Conversely, proliferation in stored confluent cells declined by ~50% with 1-day re-incubation. Pre-confluent stored CES also had far superior stem cell colony forming efficiency (CFE) performance compared to the confluent group. Re-incubation improved CFE in both groups, but the pre-confluent group again out-performed the confluent group with significantly more colonies. In conclusion, a maximum storage period of 7 days is recommended. Use of pre-confluent cells and one day recovery incubation greatly improves viability, colony-forming ability and proliferation of cells stored for 7 days at 12°C. Thus, these recommendations should be considered under culture and storage of high-quality CES for clinical use."
https://openalex.org/W3028009836,"In contrast to commonly used approaches to improve data quality in diffusion weighted imaging, position-orientation adaptive smoothing (POAS) provides an edge-preserving post-processing approach. This study aims to investigate its potential and effects on image quality, diffusion metrics, and fiber tractography of the corticospinal tract in relation to non-post-processed and averaged data. 22 healthy volunteers were included in this study. For each volunteer five clinically applicable diffusion weighted imaging data sets were acquired and post-processed by standard averaging and POAS. POAS post-processing led to significantly higher signal-to-noise-ratios (p < 0.001), lower fractional anisotropy across the whole brain (p < 0.05) and reduced intra-subject variability of diffusion weighted imaging signal intensity and fractional anisotropy (p < 0.001, p = 0.006). Fiber tractography of the corticospinal tract resulted in significantly (p = 0.027, p = 0.014) larger tract volumes while fiber density was the lowest. Similarity across tractography results was highest for POAS post-processed data (p < 0.001). POAS post-processing enhances image quality, decreases the intra-subject variability of signal intensity and fractional anisotropy, increases fiber tract volume of the corticospinal tract, and leads to higher reproducibility of tractography results. Thus, POAS post-processing supports a reliable and more accurate fiber tractography of the corticospinal tract, being mandatory for the clinical use."
https://openalex.org/W3026560574,"Acute respiratory infection (ARI) and diarrhoea are two major causes of child morbidity and mortality in Bangladesh. National and regional level prevalence of ARI and diarrhoea are calculated from nationwide surveys; however, prevalence at micro-level administrative units (say, district and sub-district) is not possible due to lack of sufficient data at those levels. In such a case, small area estimation (SAE) methods can be applied by combining survey data with census data. Using an SAE method for the dichotomous response variable, this study aims to estimate the proportions of under-5 children experienced with ARI and diarrhoea separately as well as either ARI or diarrhoea within a period of two-week preceding the survey. The ARI and diarrhoea data extracted from Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey 2011 are used to develop a random effect logistic model for each of the indicators, and then the prevalence is estimated adapting the World Bank SAE approach for the dichotomous response variable using a 5% sample of the Census 2011. The estimated prevalence of each indicator significantly varied by district and sub-district (1.4-11.3% for diarrhoea, 2.2-11.8% for ARI and 4.3-16.5% for ARI/diarrhoea at sub-district level). In many sub-districts, the proportions are found double of the national level. District and sub-district levels spatial distributions of the indicators might help the policymakers to identify the vulnerable disaggregated and remote hotspots. Particularly, aid industries can provide effective interventions at the highly vulnerable spots to overcome the gaps between micro and macro level administrative units."
https://openalex.org/W3026850823,"Patient-delivered partner therapy (PDPT) is an evidence-based method of partner treatment, but further research was needed to understand theoretical underpinnings of potential PDPT use.We sought to develop and test a theoretical framework to understand PDPT intentions.A Midwestern sample of sexually transmitted infection clinic patients were recruited to participate in a three-phase study incorporating semi-structured interviews (n = 20, total), cognitive interviews (n = 5), and surveys (n = 197; Mage = 31.3, 61% male, 91% Black or African-American). Thematic analysis was conducted to identify major themes, which guided development and testing of a theoretical framework on PDPT intentions using structural equation modeling.We identified themes of information (knowledge); motivation (individual and partner protection beliefs, partner and provider motivation-to-comply); social support (sexual health and general); and behavioral skills (partner notification, medication delivery, and communication skills self-efficacy) in thematic analysis. The developed Interpersonal-Behavior model demonstrated good model fit in structural equation modeling [χ2(36) = 95.56, p<0.01; RMSEA = 0.09 (0.07-0.11, 90%C.I.); CFI = 0.94; SRMR = 0.05]. Information was associated with motivation (β = 0.37, p<0.001) and social support (β = 0.23, p = 0.002). Motivation was associated with social support (β = 0.64, p<0.001) and behavioral skills (β = 0.40, p<0.001), and social support was associated with behavioral skills (β = 0.23, p = 0.025). Behavioral skills were associated with higher PDPT intentions (β = 0.31, p<0.001), partially mediated the association of motivation with intentions (βdirect = 0.53, p<0.001; βindirect = 0.12, 95%CI: 0.03-0.30), and fully mediated the association of social support with intentions (βindirect = 0.07, 95%CI: 0.00-0.21).The Interpersonal-Behavior model seems appropriate for PDPT intentions but should be tested longitudinally with PDPT outcomes and other interpersonal health behaviors."
