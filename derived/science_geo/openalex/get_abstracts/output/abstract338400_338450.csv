https://openalex.org/W2051144184,"Landsat satellite imagery covering the entire forested portion of the Brazilian Amazon Basin was used to measure, for 1978 and 1988, deforestation, fragmented forest, defined as areas less than 100 square kilometers surrounded by deforestation, and edge effects of 1 kilometer into forest from adjacent areas of deforestation. Tropical deforestation increased from 78,000 square kilometers in 1978 to 230,000 square kilometers in 1988 while tropical forest habitat, severely affected with respect to biological diversity, increased from 208,000 to 588,000 square kilometers. Although this rate of deforestation is lower than previous estimates, the effect on biological diversity is greater."
https://openalex.org/W1970589789,"The crystal structure of a stable silyl cation, triethylsilylium, in the form of its tetrakis (pentafluorophenyl)borate salt [Et(3)Si(+) (C(6)F(5))(4)B(-)] (Et, ethyl) shows no coordination between cation and anion. The closest silicon-fluorine distance is greater than 4 angstroms. A toluene solvent molecule is close enough to cause some deviations from planarity at the silicon, but the silicon-toluene distance is well beyond the sum of the silicon and carbon covalent radii. The toluene molecule is essentially planar and undistorted, as expected if little or no positive charge has been transferred from silicon to toluene."
https://openalex.org/W2039948085,"The chiral fullerene C(76) was kinetically resolved by asymmetric osmylation providing an example of an optically active allotrope of a pure element. C(76) recovered from the treatment of racemic C(76) with OsO(4) and a chiral alkaloid ligand, showed a specific rotation [alpha](D) of -4000 degrees (> 97 percent enantiomeric excess) and a circular dichroism spectrum corresponding to the ultraviolet spectrum. Regenerated C(76) formed by reducing the asymmetrically osmylated C(76) with SnCl(2) was enriched in the opposite enantiomer. Analysis of the local curvature of the C(76) molecule indicated that OsO(4) should selectively add to 2 of the 30 types of bonds in C(76). This regioselectivity was supported chromatographically and interpreted in terms of the kinetic resolution."
https://openalex.org/W2045034476,"The Estancia basin in southwestern United States contains evidence for strong and rapid pulsations in the supply of moisture brought into the region during the last ice age. The pulses were recorded during episodes of stream discharge that spread plumes of fresh water laden with quartz sand over the saline lake. The largest pulses in stream discharge lasted only a few decades, were organized into cycles that were spaced approximately 200 to 250 and 2000 years apart, and were of sufficient magnitude to freshen and maintain the lake at its maximum recorded elevation."
https://openalex.org/W2068498754,"For the past 80 years, the energy released in great strike-slip and thrust earthquakes has occurred in alternating cycles of 20 to 30 years. This pattern suggests that a global transfer mechanism from poloidal to toroidal components of tectonic plate motions is operating on time scales of several decades. The increase in seismic activity in California in recent years may be related to an acceleration of global strike-slip moment release, as regions of shear deformation mature after being reached by stresses that have propagated away from regions of great subduction decoupling earthquakes in the 1960s."
https://openalex.org/W2079299142,"Analyses of stable carbon isotopes from two sample suites from sandstone uranium (tabular) ores show interesting variations. Organic carbon associated with high-grade uranium ore is heavy (δ13C = –16.9 to –19.6 per mil, where δ13C = 13C/12C relative to the Pee Dee belemnite standard) relative to the adjacent lower-grade samples (–22.7 to –26.4 per mil). It is suggested that the heavy isotopic values for the are samples are related to a radiation and chemical isotope effect that has occurred mainly because of an alpha-radiation dose of 1011 rads."

A biogenic agent may be responsible for the approximately 20,000-fold enrichment of copper during aerosol production from the ocean."
https://openalex.org/W2053036592,Remarkable folding and uplifting movements were active along the western margin of the Sinai subplate (the Bardawil Lagoon and its periphery) during the Upper Holocene. The coasts of the eastern margin (Gulf of Elat) were also uplifted during the same tectonic phase. The nature of this activity is discussed in relation to the regional tectonic framework.
