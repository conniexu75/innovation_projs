The quadratic elongation is dimensionless, giving a quantitative measure of polyhedral disortion which is independent of the effective size of the polyhedron."
https://openalex.org/W1992818025,"Symptoms of forest decline of spruce in Europe range from needle yellowing and loss to tree and stand mortality. In a study area in northeast Bavaria, West Germany, where forest decline was initially detected, exposure to high concentrations of gaseous pollutants, SO(2,) NO(x,) and ozone has had no long-lasting direct effect on needles, and pathogens have only been secondary agents. Deposition of sulfur, nitrate, and ammonium, however, have significantly modified plant nutrition and soil chemistry. Spruce roots apparently take up ammonium rather than nitrate with an antagonistic effect on uptake of Mg. Nitrate left in the soil solution is leached together with sulfate to ground water, accelerating soil acidification and decreasing Ca/Al and Mg/Al ratios in the soil solution. Soil solution chemistry affects root development, and water and nutrient uptake. Had all nutrients become equally deficient, spruce trees probably could have adjusted by retarding their growth. However, canopy uptake of atmospheric nitrogen in addition to root uptake stimulated growth and caused a nitrogen to cation imbalance to develop; this imbalance resulted in the decline symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W2028944746,"A pheromone biosynthesis activating neuropeptide (PBAN) hormone that controls sex pheromone production in female moths was identified from the brain-subesophageal ganglion complexes of the adult corn earworm, Heliothis zea. PBAN has 33 amino acid residues and a molecular weight of 3900. Its amino acid sequence has no significant homology with any of the fully characterized peptide hormones. The synthetic peptide, at a dose of between 2 and 4 picomoles, induced production of a normal quantity of sex pheromone in ligated H. zea females. The peptide also induced pheromone production in six other species of moths, thus indicating that this or similar peptides may be responsible for the regulation of pheromone production in moths."
https://openalex.org/W1981900098,"Secular sea level trends extracted from tide gauge records of appropriately long duration demonstrate that global sea level may be rising at a rate in excess of 1 millimeter per year. However, because global coverage of the oceans by the tide gauge network is highly nonuniform and the tide gauge data reveal considerable spatial variability, there has been a well-founded reluctance to interpret the observed secular sea level rise as representing a signal of global scale that might be related to the greenhouse effect. When the tide gauge data are filtered so as to remove the contribution of ongoing glacial isostatic adjustment to the local sea level trend at each location, then the individual tide gauge records reveal sharply reduced geographic scatter and suggest that there is a globally coherent signal of strength 2.4 +/- 0.90 millimeters per year that is active in the system. This signal could constitute an indication of global climate warming."

https://openalex.org/W2077700616,"Hooklike trichomes of Passiflora adenopoda provide a specific, effectively absolute defense against heliconiine butterfly larvae, a major class of Passiflora herbivores. It is suggested that since mechanical defenses are usually more selective in their action against herbivores, they usually are evolved by a plant only after it has accumulated a series of chemical defenses."
https://openalex.org/W2089647516,"Strong regulation of photosynthetic metabolism is maintained by controlled key enzymes within the carbon reduction cycle, on biosynthetic paths leading from it, and within the chloroplast membrane. Of these, the most important are ribulose diphosphate carboxylase, controlling the initial entry of carbon dioxide, and fructose diphosphatase, operating as a portal between carbohydrate metabolism and other biosynthesis, and perhaps playing some role in the selective diffusion of sugar phosphates through the outer chloroplast membrane. Intracellular pH and concentrations of magnesium ion and inorganic pyrophosphate seem to be candidates for controlling factors in some of these processes. These and other control effects have been demonstrated by determinations of metabolite concentrations in green cells and chloroplasts in vivo by tracer techniques. Along biosynthetic paths, pyruvate kinase, which controls the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvic acid to pyruvate, and sucrose phosphate synthetase, which controls sucrose synthesis, play important roles. 61 references, 6 figures."
https://openalex.org/W1980778957,"The hexagonal ferrites form an unusual group of complex, ferrimagnetic oxides embodying some 60 known crystal structures. These include phases for which the structural unit cell is larger than that in any known inorganic materials. The various hexagonal ferrite modifications fall into two distinct structural series, each formed by the ordered interlayering (stacking) of two discrete building blocks; these blocks stack along the c crystallographic axis in varying ratios and varying permutations to form strictly coherent, reproducible crystal structures. This mixed-layering aspect of the hexagonal ferrites permits direct, visual observation of the sequence of their subunit-cell stacking elements, after etching, by means of electron microscopy. The sequence of stacked blocks in such structures constitutes the only information lacking for a complete, three-dimensional structure determination. Direct access to this information provides an immediate, unique solution of the crystal structure problem in each case and thereby avoids the dilemmas of a classical diffraction approach to such large unit cells. Ferrite structures with hexagonal c dimensions of 1455 and 1577 angstroms have been uniquely solved by direct electron microscopic readout of surface etch features. One must exercise caution, however, in generalizing these findings to other materials. The method is successful in the case of the hexagonal ferrites because these are mixed-layer structures, wherein the building blocks react at different rates to a specific etchant. Mixed-layer systems are not uncommon in crystallography, and it is likely that similar techniques can be developed for other such materials. Regardless of the validity of this prognosis, however, it is quite evident that high-resolution replica electron microscopy is a most promising tool for the direct observation of surface structure on an ultramicro scale. During the studies reported here replica resolution capability was improved to about 10 angstroms; final resolution is limited by the particle size of the platinum shadowing material. Careful control of experimental conditions during replica preparation or an alternate choice of shadowing material, or both, might reasonably improve the resolution by a factor of 2. This resolution is within the range of most unit cell dimensions and approaches interatomic distances in solid-state materials. The potential of such an experimental capability needs no elaboration."

This result suggests the Acadian orogeny was more abrupt than previously suspected, and is consistent with the hypothesis that the orogeny involves a collision between two sialic plates."

This unique pollent is further distinguished by being in polyads which are compartmentalized individually within septate stamens."

https://openalex.org/W1990344817,"The glassy coating of lunar rock 12017 is enriched in 15 trace elements relative to the crystalline interior. It apparently consists chiefly of shock-melted rock, somewhat richer in rare earth elements and alkali metals than rock 12017 itself. The glass has been contaminated by about 0.5 percent carbonaceous-chondrite-like material or, alternatively, by a mixture of 0.06 to 0.3 percent fractionated meteoritic material and approximately 10 to 15 percent local soil. The glazing seems to represent molten material splashed from a nearby meteorite impact and not in situ melting by a sudden increase in solar luminosity."

https://openalex.org/W1966995260,"The preparation of highly crystalline polyethylene at low pressures is reported. With careful control of the substrate, the melting and crystallization schedule, and the physical state of the specimen (film thickness), it is possible to prepare polyethylene having a density in excess of 0.999 gram per cubic centimeter, a melting temperature of approximately 140 degrees C, and a heat of fusion in excess of 70 calories per gram. The approach appears to be general and should be applicable to a wide variety of polymers."
