https://openalex.org/W1579567108,Successful renaturation of several oligomeric enzymes after denaturation by sodium dodecyl sulfate is described. The results obtained suggest a general procedure for reactivation of enzymes after treatment with this detergent. Proteins in dodecyl sulfate solution are first incubated in concentrated urea and are then freed of the detergent by an anion exchange resin. The resulting dodecyl sulfate-free proteins can be renatured from urea solution by standard procedures. This method has also been used to recover enzymatic activity in moderate yields of some proteins after electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate.
https://openalex.org/W1541406481,"Abstract The forward reaction catalyzed by galactosyltransferase has been studied kinetically at pH 8.0 with N-acetylglucosamine as the galactosyl group acceptor. From the results of initial velocity studies, as well as investigations of the deadend inhibition by UDP-glucose and the substrate inhibition by higher concentrations of N-acetylglucosamine, it has been concluded that the reaction has an ordered mechanism with the reactants adding in the order: Mn2+, UDP-galactose, N-acetylglucosamine. A further conclusion is that Mn2+ reacts with the free enzyme under conditions of thermodynamic equilibrium and does not dissociate after each catalytic cycle. Values are reported for the various kinetic parameters."

Changes of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid concentration in the spinal cord are clearly reflected in the perfusate of the spinal subarachnoid space. Thus, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid in the spinal fluid originates from the spinal cord and reflects metabolic changes of 5-hydroxytryptamine in the spinal tissue, but not those in the brain."

https://openalex.org/W1896754363,"Abstract Investigations have been made of the kinetic effects of α-lactalbumin on the reactions catalyzed by galactosyltransferase using both N-acetylglucosamine and glucose as galactosyl group acceptors. The results indicate that α-lactalbumin can cause (a) the reactions to occur via alternative pathways, (b) reductions in the apparent Michaelis constant values for both substrates, (c) a decrease in the apparent maximum velocity of the reaction with N-acetylglucosamine, and (d) an increase in the apparent maximum velocity of the reaction with glucose. Further, it has been shown that α-lactalbumin enhances the substrate inhibition by N-acetylglucosamine and glucose, as well as the dead-end inhibition by l-arabinose and N-acetylgalactosamine. The general conclusion has been reached that α-lactalbumin is a special type of modifier which combines with the enzyme only after the addition of a carbohydrate reactant."

https://openalex.org/W1976060817,The effects of electroshock on brain seizure activity and brain protein synthesis were studied in male mice. A significant but short-lasting inhibition of brain protein synthesis and an increase in the amount of free leucine were produced by electroshock at intensities above the brain seizure threshold. Electroshock at intensities below the brain seizure threshold did not affect brain protein synthesis.
https://openalex.org/W1586030239,"Abstract The regulatory properties of rat liver pyruvate carboxylase have been studied at pH 7.3, 37°, and 85 mm KCl. It was concluded that in vivo activity is determined mainly by pyruvate and acetyl-CoA concentrations. The concentrations of Mg++ may also be regulatory, but inhibition by MgADP or Ca++ was considered less likely to occur under physiological conditions. Malonyl-CoA, succinyl-CoA, acetoacetyl-CoA, and CoA had no significant effect on reaction velocity at rate-limiting acetyl-CoA. The results obtained with the isolated enzyme are discussed with reference to other work with intact mitochondria. The general conclusion is that pyruvate carboxylase activity is not regulated in an on-off manner as are enzymes that participate solely in gluconeogenesis, for it participates also in lipogenesis and tricarboxylic acid cycle activity."
https://openalex.org/W1497177798,"Abstract Unlike human serum albumin (HSA), dog serum albumin (DSA) failed to exhibit the characteristics of a specific first binding site for copper(II). Equilibrium dialysis of DSA against Cu(II) at pH 7.5 indicated two preferred Cu(II)-binding sites of comparable affinities. Equilibrium dialysis of HSA and DSA against Cu(II), in the presence of l-histidine as competing ligand, demonstrated the absence in DSA of the first strong binding site apparent in HSA. The addition of 1 eq of Cu(II) to HSA almost quantitatively protected the terminal α-amino group from reacting with dinitrofluorobenzene at pH 11.0, whereas by the same treatment only 32% protection was afforded to DSA. The Cu(II)-binding properties of HSA and DSA were compared by spectrophotometric and proton displacement studies. HSA was found to have those binding features that have been found to characterize bovine serum albumin. Results with DSA in the presence of 1 and 2 eq of Cu(II) strongly suggested the partitioning of the first equivalent of Cu(II) between at least two sites. At basic pH one site would appear to involve the α-amino nitrogen, consistent with the partial protection of DSA in presence of Cu(II) from NH2-terminal modification by dinitrofluorobenzene. The partitioning of the first equivalent of Cu(II) between two sites seems most pronounced near neutral pH. At high pH the site involving the α-amino ligand is apparently somewhat preferred over the other possible loci. Possible explanations for the absence of the specific Cu(II)-binding site in DSA are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1520363596,"Abstract The subunit molecular weight of horse spleen apoferritin has been determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of the anionic detergent sodium dodecyl sulfate, gel filtration on columns of agarose in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, and by sedimentation equilibrium under dissociating conditions in the analytical ultracentrifuge. The results obtained indicate that the polypeptide chain of horse spleen apoferritin has a molecular weight of 18,500, which is in marked contrast to the previously determined value. The tryptophan content of the protein was estimated spectrophotometrically and, after modification, as 2-(2-nitrophenylsulfenyl)tryptophan. The value of 2.08 residues per 18,500 daltons is also in disagreement with literature values. These observations suggest that the undissociated horse spleen apoferritin molecule may consist of 23 to 25 subunits. For reasons of symmetry a value of 24 would seem most probable. The molecular weight of human and horse transferrin was also determined and found to be 76,600."

The results of these assays in both cases are in reasonable agreement with those expected if HCO3- is assumed to be the functional species utilized by both enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1590316189,"Abstract The α and β chains within the human hemoglobin tetramer possess different reactivities toward n-butyl isocyanide. Identification of the kinetic components involved in the binding of the fourth ligand molecule is made possible by intrinsic spectral differences between the α and β chains. In the last step in ligand binding, the association rate constants for the α and β chains were determined to be 35 x 103 m-1 sec-1 and 240 x 103 m-1 sec-1, respectively; the dissociation constants were 0.32 sec-1 and 4.00 sec-1, respectively. These kinetic parameters were little affected by heme concentration and pH. Similarly, inorganic phosphate and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate had little effect. However, inositol hexaphosphate did influence the parameters through its ability to bind to the liganded form of hemoglobin. Under all the experimental conditions investigated the β chain association and dissociation rate constants were both significantly greater than the corresponding α chain constants. The equilibrium constants for both chains were roughly equivalent."

Signal assignments were made by comparison of the peptides with each other and with the free amino acids, by the pH dependence of the chemical shifts, and by modification of the degree of proton decoupling in certain cases. The chemical shift dependence of specific carbon centers on their position in the oligopeptide sequences and the influence of the state of ionization of various groups on neighboring carbon sites were explored."
https://openalex.org/W1552944091,"Abstract The cysteine residues in proteins and peptides may be quantitatively and selectively converted to the S-methyl derivatives by reaction with methyl-p-nitrobenzenesulfonate. Procedures are described for the reduction and methylation of a variety of proteins at pH 8.6 and 37°, together with the pH rate profile for the methylation of reduced glutathione at 25°. The methylation of S-sulfoinsulin B chain and an S-benzylcysteinyl pentapeptide was performed after removal of the protective groups by mercaptoethanol and sodium in liquid ammonia, respectively. Amino acid analysis of the various S-methylated proteins and peptides revealed no modifications other than the quantitative conversion of cysteine to S-methylcysteine. The specific radioactivity and amino acid analysis of 14C-methylcysteinyl rhodanese isolated after reaction with radioactive reagent revealed that the modifications were confined to the 2 cysteine residues in rhodanese monomer. Methylation of the presumed active site cysteine residue in papain occurred only in 7 m urea and was accompanied by inactivation of the enzyme; papain was refractive to the reagent in the absence of denaturing agents."

https://openalex.org/W2110222046,"Abstract RNase hydrogen exchange kinetics are similar to the characteristically complex hydrogen exchange of proteins in general. We have analyzed these kinetic data in terms of distributions of first order rates. Two classes of exchanging sites in tritiated RNase can be identified and isolated by their temperature dependence. The pH and cosolvent effects on each class have been measured separately. Each class contains a distribution of first order rates evenly distributed over the range. The rank order of exchange is pH and temperature independent. One class exchanges with an apparent activation energy (E*app) similar to that of random conformation polypeptides and substituted amides, ≃22 kcal. The second class exchanges with an E*app of ≃60 kcal. The number of sites exchanging in each class is pH dependent. At pH 3.15 about 50% of the measured sites exchange with low E*app, while at pH 6 about 90% exchange with low E*app. To account for the range and temperature dependence of the high E*app distribution of exchange rates we propose a model involving an equilibrium between the folded and thermally unfolded state. This model is supported by (a) the agreement between observed and calculated rates estimated from the literature values of the thermal unfolding equilibrium constant, (b) the pH dependence of the high E*app exchange, and (c) the urea and ethanol dependence of the high E*app exchange. It is proposed that the low E*app exchange is from the folded protein, and as such offers a uniquely sensitive probe of the conformational dynamics of the folded state. The pH dependence of the low E*app rates is less than one-third that observed in model random conformational polypeptides."
https://openalex.org/W73050221,"The reaction catalyzed by galactosyltransferase has been studied kinetically at pH 8.0 using glucose as the galactosyl group acceptor in the presence of a fixed concentration of α-lactalbumin. The initial velocity patterns and the patterns for the dead-end inhibition by UDP-glucose were similar to those obtained with N-acetylglucosamine as a substrate in the absence of α-lactalbumin (in an accompanying paper). l -Arabinose acted as a dead-end inhibitor giving rise to inhibitions which were competitive with respect to glucose and uncompetitive in relation to both Mn2+ and UDP-galactose. These results have been interpreted to indicate that there is an ordered addition of Mn2+, UDP-galactose, and glucose to the enzyme, as well as an ordered release of lactose and UDP. It is postulated that Mn2+ does not dissociate from the enzyme-manganese complex during the catalytic reaction. Product inhibition by lactose was not observed. Comparisons have been made of the values for the kinetic constants associated with Mn2+ and UDP-galactose in the absence and presence of α-lactalbumin."
https://openalex.org/W2467948636,"The isotopic exchange reactions catalyzed by rat liver pyruvate carboxylase are reported. The ATP ⇌ ADP and ATP ⇌ Pi exchanges displayed the same kinetic dependence on acetyl-CoA, Mg++, K+, and HCO3-. These two exchanges occurred at the same rate suggesting a rapid equilibrium random addition of MgADP and Pi. HCO3- was a total uncompetitive substrate inhibitor of both exchanges versus Mg-ATP. The HCO3- ⇌ oxalacetate exchange required all of the substrates and activators of the reverse reaction, and ordinarily was observed only at chemical equilibrium. The pyruvate ⇌ oxalacetate exchange was shown to be partially dependent on acetyl-CoA and added cations. These results are the basis for a proposed concerted mechanism for the carboxylation of biotin."

This compound is the first host-specific plant toxin to have a structure proposed for it. The toxin produces symptoms only on those clones of sugar cane that are susceptible to the fungus. Based on its spectral and chemical properties, the proposed structure of helminthosporoside is 2-hydroxycyclopropyl-α-d-galactopyranoside. A biological assay for its quantification based on the degree of symptom expression on sugar cane leaves is described. Helminthosporoside-14C can be isolated from cultures of H. sacchari that have been incubated with galactose-1-14C."
https://openalex.org/W1481582702,"Abstract 5-Gluconolactone is a potent inhibitor of rabbit muscle phosphorylase a in the presence of saturating AMP. Kinetic analysis leads to the conclusion that the inhibitor binds most strongly to the enzyme-glycogen-Pi complex (Kapi = 0.025 mm), but weaker binding is also observed with the enzyme-glycogen-α-d-glucopyranose 1-phosphate complex, the enzyme-glycogen complex, the enzyme-Pi complex, and the free enzyme. Dissociation constants for each of the observed inhibitor complexes have been evaluated. The kinetic data is consistent with a model in which 5-gluconolactone binds to the site in the enzyme that normally binds the glucosyl residue that is transferred between polysaccharide and Pi in the catalytic reaction. 5-Gluconolactone may be an analogue of the substrate part of the transition state of the phosphorylase reaction."
https://openalex.org/W2098517818,"Abstract L5178Y cells were synchronized and protein, glycoprotein, DNA and RNA synthesis in the mitochondria were measured. Mitochondrial synthesis in vivo in the intact L5178Y cell, and in vitro in isolated mitochondria from synchronous L5178Y cells was measured. In vivo mitochondrial protein synthesis occurred primarily in G1 and G2; in vitro the synthesis by the isolated mitochondria of protein occurred only in G1. Mitochondrial DNA synthesis in vivo occurred in S and G2; in vitro DNA synthesis was greatest in the G2 period. RNA synthesis in vivo occurred with three peaks of activity, two in S and one in G2; in vitro only the G2 synthesis was prominent. Glycoprotein synthesis in the L5178Y cell mitochondria in vivo occurred in G1, S, G2; in vitro the major synthesis was confined to G1. Two mitochondrial enzymes, succinic dehydrogenase and monoamine oxidase were found to be S peak enzymes in the synchronized L5178Y cells."
https://openalex.org/W1989842426,The concentration of histamine in the brains of neonatal rats is considerably higher than that in adults. Subcellular fractionation studies revealed that about 90 percent of the histamine content of neonatal rat brain is confined to the crude nuclear fraction obtained by differential fractionation. Purified nuclei prepared from these fractions retained 90 percent of their histamine content. The nuclear localization of histamine in the brains of neonatal rats suggests a function for histamine in modulating the growth processes of the neonatal brain.
https://openalex.org/W1502355817,"Abstract Pyridoxal phosphate can be firmly bound by reduction with sodium borohydride to many enzymes in which it occurs. Such treatment has been used to label specifically parts of peptide chains in the vicinity of the bound coenzyme. Pyridoxal phosphate may form specific complexes with many proteins for which it has no known coenzyme function. Bovine RNase is an enzyme for which it has no known function but which possesses a well characterized phosphate binding site. When RNase was treated with pyridoxal phosphate and sodium borohydride, the catalytic activity was lost. This loss is attributed to the binding of pyridoxal phosphate to a residue topologically adjacent to the active center. The special affinity of RNase for anions is sufficient to affect its specific labeling by pyridoxal phosphate."

From the methionine content of 14 residues, 15 peptides were expected to be produced; 13 of these were isolated. These fragments ranged in size from 4 to 135 residues. In addition, three peptides representing incompletely cleaved products were also obtained. The methods of isolation of the peptides included preliminary separation by gel filtration followed in some cases by additional gel filtration steps, by countercurrent distribution, by ion exchange chromatography, and, for many of the smaller fragments, by chromatography or electrophoresis on paper. The CNBr peptides were used to obtain parts of the sequence which had not been previously represented in peptides isolated after other hydrolytic procedures, to determine overlapping regions of the sequence, and to confirm parts of the sequence previously deduced by studies on other peptides."

https://openalex.org/W1507865878,"Abstract Bovine pancreatic deoxyribonuclease contains 3 tryptophan residues per molecule of enzyme (mol wt 31,000). Two of these residues react with the chemical modifying reagents specific for tryptophan, N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) and 2-hydroxy-5-nitrobenzyl bromide (HNB). A 6-fold excess of NBS over DNase completely inactivates DNase and at 100% loss of activity, one tryptophan is oxidized to oxindole per DNase molecule. HNB also reacts with a single tryptophan residue in DNase to give a 20% to 30% loss of activity. HNB-modified DNase then can be inactivated with a 6-fold excess of NBS with the resulting oxidation of a single tryptophan residue. This indicates that there are two reactive tryptophans in DNase, one of which is essential for catalytic activity. NBS also reacts with tyrosine, histidine, and methionine, but amino acid analysis of NBS-inactivated DNase showed that no other amino acids except tryptophan were modified. The structure of the NBS-inactivated enzyme has not been grossly altered. Calcium protects one of the two disulfide bonds in native DNase from mercaptoethanol reduction and also protects one disulfide bond in the inactivated enzyme. Comparison of circular dichroism spectra of NBS-inactivated and native DNase shows little significant difference. However, calcium was found to induce an ultraviolet difference spectrum in DNase while the NBS-inactivated DNase showed no difference spectrum over a wide range of calcium concentration."

https://openalex.org/W1516576133,"Abstract The helical content of human chorionic somatomammotropin has been determined by circular dichroism measurements in the far ultraviolet. Only small changes in circular dichroic activity occur between pH 2 and 12 in aqueous solution. An important modification in tertiary structure, however, takes place below pH 4 which has been followed by changes in tryptophan and tryosine absorption and emission intensities. A structural transition occurs also in alkali above pH 10 which has been detected by the increase in quantum yields of the tryptophanyl and dimethylaminonaphthalene sulfonyl chromophores. The conformational transitions produced by urea at pH 5.0 and 8.0 in human chorionic somatomammotropin have been evaluated by circular dichroism, absorption, and fluorescence measurements. Although minor differences in properties and stability exist between human chorionic somatomammotropin and bovine growth hormone or ovine prolactin, the composite behavior of human chorionic somatomammotropin resembles the latter two proteins sufficiently closely to suggest that there is an important degree of structural similarity between all three molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2053978656,"THE discovery that pollen can transform the mildly virulent fungus Botrytis cinerea into a destructive pathogen of broad bean and strawberry1 poses fundamental and practical problems. One concerns the nature of the stimulants from pollen1 because B. cinerea is normally unable to spread from limited lesions in broad bean leaves even in the presence of fungal nutrients2. Another is the mode of action of the stimulants, and particularly their interaction with wyerone acid metabolism. Wyerone acid3 has been identified as an antifungal product of infected bean (Vicia faba), and its formation, activity and degradation have been suggested as important factors controlling development of Botrytis in Vicia3,5. If pollen extracts prevent accumulation of wyerone acid or render the fungus insensitive to the acid, support would be provided for this suggestion."
https://openalex.org/W1611260727,"Abstract We have extended our previous observation that insulin enhances the incorporation of pyrimidine ribonucleosides into nucleotide pools and into RNA in bone cells (Peck, W. A., and Messinger, K., J. Biol. Chem., 245, 2722 (1970)), and have examined the role of cellular sulfhydryl groups in this effect. Stimulation was not due to impurities in the insulin preparations used. Porcine single component and low zinc amorphous insulins were as effective as zinc-containing crystalline insulin when compared on a weight basis. Isolated A chains were ineffective, and the stimulatory ability of insulin was markedly diminished by previous exposure to anti-insulin antiserum. Dithiothreitol, in concentrations ranging from 0.6 to 2.0 mm, also stimulated uridine incorporation. Like insulin, dithiothreitol exerted its major effect on pyrimidine rather than purine ribonucleoside incorporation, appeared to stimulate uridine phosphorylation rather than uptake, was effective within 15 min of treatment, acted even in the absence of metabolizable extracellular substrates and at high as well as low starting concentrations of uridine in the incubation medium. The effects of insulin and dithiothreitol were additive in concentrations which caused less than maximal stimulation, but were nonadditive in maximal stimulatory concentrations. Their effects differed significantly in that dithiothreitol stimulation, but not that of insulin, was still present 45 min after cessation of treatment. Dithioerythritol, the erythro isomer of dithiothreitol, was equally effective, but other thiols (reduced glutathione, thioglycolate, cysteine, 2-mercaptoethanol, and 2,3-dimercaptopropanol), as well as disulfide-containing hormones (arginine and lysine vasopressin), were nonstimulatory. However, the effect of dithiothreitol was related to its sulfhydryl groups, since it was abolished by their prior (a) oxidation or (b) blockage with N-ethylmaleimide. These results suggest that cellular sulfhydryl groups participate in pyrimidine ribonucleoside phosphorylation and in the insulin stimulation of this pathway. The specific molecular configuration of dithiothreitol (dithioerythritol) may allow its sulfhydryl groups to interact with an insulin-sensitive site."

https://openalex.org/W137871674,"Abstract The binding of Cu(II) to crystalline RNase-S, RNase-E, and 41-DNP-RNase-S in the presence of 3 m (NH4)2SO4 has been investigated crystallographically. At pH 5.5, with 0.1 m acetate present as buffer, seven binding sites were detected on RNase-S, three of which are intermolecular. The intramolecular sites occur near His-119, His-105, Glu-86, and a sulfate ion bound at the active site, and have fractional occupancies at a Cu(II) concentration of 100 mm of 1.07 ± 0.10, 0.79 ± 0.10, 0.42 ± 0.09, and 0.33 ± 0.10, respectively. The intermolecular sites occur near the amino terminus of the S-peptide, the amino terminus of the S-protein, and Asp-53. At 100 mm Cu(II), at pH 5.5, the fractional occupancies of these sites are 1.25 ± 0.10, 0.68 ± 0.12, and 0.31 ± 0.12, respectively. The modes of binding of Cu(II) to RNase-S and RNase-E are essentially identical. On the other hand, the site near the sulfate ion is absent on the dinitrophenylated enzyme at pH 5.5, and there are minor changes in the positions, occupancies, or temperature factors of the sites near Glu-86 and the amino terminus of the S-protein. At pH 7.0, in the presence of 0.67 m acetate and 0.3 m ethanolamine, the occupancies of all Cu(II) sites on RNase-S decrease, although the occupancies of sites with nitrogen ligands decrease less than those with oxygen ligands. The sites near Glu-86, the sulfate ion, and Asp-53 appear to be unoccupied, but a new site near Asp-121, possibly involving His-119, appears. In the presence of Cu(II), the binding of 3'-CMP to RNase-S at pH 5.5 is enhanced 20% although no change in its mode of binding and no bound Cu(II) could be detected at 3 A resolution."

https://openalex.org/W1491491796,"Abstract The urea dependence of RNase hydrogen exchange kinetics has been studied. Exchange having apparent low activation energy (≃22 kcal) and exchange having apparent high activation energy (≃60 kcal) were measured separately as a function of urea concentration. The urea dependence of the low apparent activation energy (E*app) exchange is qualitatively different from that with high E*app whether one varies the temperature at constant urea concentration or the urea concentration at constant temperature. The increase in the high E* exchange rate in 2 m urea is quantitatively consistent with a mechanism involving thermal unfolding. The urea effect on the low E*app exchange rate shows a urea concentration dependence identical with that of the urea-induced unfolding. A hydrogen exchange model in which the low E*app exchange takes place from folded RNase and the high E*app exchange takes place from thermally unfolded RNase accounts for the temperature, pH, urea, and ethanol dependence of RNase hydrogen exchange kinetics. This model significantly alters some of the prevalent interpretations of protein hydrogen exchange kinetics. A conformational model of folded RNase must explain the following hydrogen exchange phenomena. (a) Apparently all labile hydrogen sites in a folded protein may exchange without the protein unfolding. (b) The pH dependence of exchange from folded RNase is 4 to 6 times less than in the random conformation. (c) The rank order of exchange from folded RNase is temperature and pH independent. (d) The distribution of exchange rates in folded RNase is over 75-fold wider than those of random conformation RNase."

Disulfide bonds in BBI also have a broad positive CD band centered around 240 nm (epsilon/sub L/ - epsilon/sub R/ = 0.9 M/sup -1/cm/sup -1/ per disulfide). Tyrosyl side chains give rise to a sharp positive peak at 231 nm, overlapping with the positive disulfide CD. Dimerization of monomeric BBI did not alter the CD profile. Fully acetylated BBI has the near ultraviolet disulfide CD and the far ultraviolet polypeptide CD very similar to those of the native inhibitor, indicating that O-acetylation of two tyrosyl side chains did not induce much conformational change in BBI. The near ultraviolet CD of BBI was altered in the presence of 8 M urea or 6 M guanidine hydrochloride, with a greater change brought about by the latter. Dithiothreitol (20 mM) completely abolished the tyrosyl and disulfide CD in this region. (auth)"
https://openalex.org/W1512368220,"Abstract Both the proteolytic and esterolytic activity of thrombin were destroyed by as little as 50 µm thorium chloride. The inhibition of thrombin was prevented by anions complexing thorium and potentiated by substrate, calcium, or lowering of the pH of the reactive mixture. The thorium-treated enzyme showed a decrease in Vm but not Km and a shift in its pH activity profile to a more alkaline range. In order to ascertain whether carboxyl groups were involved in this reaction with ThCl4, the carbodiimide-nucleophile reaction was studied. Progressive inactivation of thrombin with marked potentiation by calcium and substrate were observed similar to the reaction with thorium. Eight moles of 14C-glycine ethyl ester per mole of protein were incorporated under nondenaturing conditions in the presence of low concentrations of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide with 80% loss of activity. When thorium-treated enzyme was similarly treated with carbodiimide, less than 1 mole of glycine ethyl ester was incorporated, suggesting that similar carboxyl groups were also involved in the modification by thorium. The accessibility of the free carboxyl groups whose integrity appears essential to the enzymatic function of thrombin seems to be critically dependent on conformational changes in the molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1485765096,"Abstract Temperature jump studies of aqueous β-lactoglobulin have been conducted between pH 3.7 and 2.0, where a reversible dissociation of the protein into two identical subunits has been reported to occur, using methyl orange as an indicator. Two relaxation processes have been observed, both of which can be attributed to intramolecular interactions between the indicator dye and protein rather than to the monomer-dimer equilibrium."
https://openalex.org/W1572930577,"Abstract The kinetic mechanism of the citrate cleavage enzyme (EC 4.1.3.8) was studied by means of equilibrium isotopic exchange. Techniques were developed for measuring simultaneously the incorporation of label from 1,5-14C-citrate into both acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate by means of appropriate chromatographic procedures with DEAE-cellulose paper. Similar methods were devised to separate the products of the exchange between 33P-phosphate and ATP. Experiments in which the levels of MgATP and of acetyl-CoA in a 1:2 ratio were increased from a basal level to 60 times that level revealed that the incorporation rate in all three exchanges increased as a monotonic function of reactant concentration. When the MgATP-Pi pair (1:360) was varied in the exchanges involving labeled citrate, complete inhibition of the exchange rate was seen at the highest level. However, dead-end inhibition by Pi cannot be discounted. All three exchanges were studied as a function of the MgATP-MgADP pair (1:0.4). Partial inhibition was seen in each case. The exchange velocity for citrate into acetyl-CoA was inhibited 85%, whereas both the citrate to oxaloacetate and the Pi to ATP exchanges were inhibited approximately 60%. These data, combined with previous initial velocity work, are consistent with the presence of a general sequence of addition and release of reactants and products (going from ATP to citrate, CoA, Pi, oxaloacetate, and acetyl-CoA) which may be interrupted at several points after ATP addition by the release of ADP."
