https://openalex.org/W2082548681,"The magnetic inclinations and intensities of about 650 samples from seven deep-sea cores taken in the Antarctic were measured on a spinner magnetometer. This series of measurements provided a magnetic stratigraphy, based on zones of normally or reversally polarized specimens for each core, which was then correlated with the magnetic stratigraphy of Cox et al. One core (V16-134) gave a continuous record of the paleomagnetic field back to about 3.5 million years. When selected samples were subjected to alternating-field demagnetization, most were found to have an unstable component that was removed by fields of 150 oersteds; all samples from two cores were partially demagnetized in a field of 150 oersteds. The average inclination in these two cores was then in good agreement with the average inclination of the ambient field for the latitude of the core site. It was also found that the intensities of the samples decreased at the points of reversal; this finding is to be expected if, as has been postulated by the dynamo theory, the intensity of the dipole field decreases to zero and builds again with opposite polarity. We believe that the magnetization of the cores results from the presence of detrital magnetite, although other magnetic minerals also may be present. Four faunal zones (φ, χ, ψ, and ω) have been recognized in these Antarctic cores on the basis of upward sequential disappearance of Radiolaria. The faunal boundaries and reversals consistently have the same relations to one another, indicating that they are both time-dependent phenomena. Using previously determined times of reversal, one may date the following events in the cores: 1) Radiolarian faunal boundaries: φ-χ, 2 million years; χ-ψ, 0.7 million years; ψ-ω, 0.4 to 0.5 million years. These dates are in good agreement with ages previously extrapolated from radiometric dates. 2) Initiation of Antarctic diatom-ooze deposition, approximately 2.0 million years ago. 3) First occurrence of ice-rafted detritus, approximately 2.5 million years ago. One can also calculate rates of sedimentation, which vary in the cores studied from 1.1 to about 8.0 millimeters per 1000 years. Sedimentation rates for the Indian Ocean cores are higher than for the Bellingshausen Sea cores. The near coincidence of faunal changes and reversals in the cores suggests but does not prove a causal relation. We conclude from this study that paleomagnetic stratigraphy is a unique method for correlating and dating deep-sea cores, and that future work with such cores may provide a complete or nearly complete record of the history of the earth's magnetic field beyond 4 million years."

A large number of methyl radicals can be stabilized over a wide range of temperature. The surface of porous Vycor glass is an excellent host for trapping free radicals.

Many of the submarine fans are cut by valleys called fan-valleys which usually connect with the mouths of submarine canyons. Loop-like bends or meanders characterize the channels of rivers in their lower flood plains, but have never been found in the shallow channels that cross the alluvial fans at the base of mountain canyons. Therefore, it was surprising to find that the channel in a very deep submarine fan-valley off Monterey Bay, California, has a tight meander."

Sandstone-like lumps found at the Wabar (Arabia) meteorite craters are similar to these shock-lithified sands. Shock-lithification by impact may be effected on Moon as large meteorites strike surfaces covered with rubble from earlier collisions."

Ancillary evidence renders it likely that this optical activity derived from contamination by biologic materials on Earth."
https://openalex.org/W1976478797,"Experiments with the interaction of a rectangular cross-section beam of electrons which is brought into contact with a metallic diffraction grating produce light variable in wavelength throughout the visible spectrum. Continuous variation of the beam thickness shows that light is produced by electrons hundreds of wavelengths from the grating, if the side of the beam near the grating is in contact with it. The results can be accounted for by periodic accelerations of the electrons passing over the surface of the grating. These accelerations are caused by electrostatic forces which in turn are due to the average space-charge of sheets of electrons reflected from the grating surface, so that in their space-charge structure the periodicity of the grating rulings is preserved."

Rous is Member Emeritus of Rockefeller University; Huggins is director of the Ben May Laboratory for Cancer Research at the University of Chicago. The following are descriptions and appreciations of their work by W. Ray Bryan and by Paul Talalay and Guy Williams-Ashman."

https://openalex.org/W2070433298,"Let me emphasize the point I have been trying to make. The mathematician's playing with the roots of equations, a play which had no practical motivations and almost no possibilities of practical application, led to the recognition of the importance of symmetry and groups. The study of theory of groups led to mathematical discoveries in geometry and differential equations, and finally to prediction of the existence of a new elementary particle. Surely a surprising outcome for the ivory-tower speculations of an impractical mathematician! Despite my professional bias, I must acknowledge that the importance of symmetry was recognized before mathematicians invented the theory of groups. In 1794 William Blake wrote: Tiger, Tiger, burning bright In the forests of the night, What immortal hand or eye Could frame thy fearful symmetry? However, to the mathematicians must be given the credit of recognizing that, to understand symmetry, you must study the theory of groups. I can now answer my original question, What are mathematicians doing? They are trying to make precise the intuitions of poets."
