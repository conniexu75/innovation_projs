https://openalex.org/W2080769728,"Rupture in individual earthquakes apparently is limited to regions between bends in faults. This is illustrated for eight events that have occurred since 1966. A model based on geometric concepts describes why this is so and clarifies earlier ideas of ""asperities"" and ""barriers"" used to explain earthquake initiation and termination processes. Because of their importance in the rupture process, bend zones should be monitored for precursory effects."

https://openalex.org/W2021708562,"In large earthquakes, damaging ground motions may occur at large epicentral distances. Because of the relatively slow speed of seismic waves, it is possible to construct a system to provide short-term warning (as much as several tens of seconds) of imminent strong ground motions from major earthquakes. Automated safety responses could be triggered by users after receiving estimates of the arrival time and strength of shaking expected at an individual site. Although warning times are likely to be short for areas greatly damaged by relatively numerous earthquakes of moderate size, large areas that experience very strong shaking during great earthquakes would receive longer warning times."

Insects that normally pollinate these hosts are attracted to the discolored leaves, ingest the sugars, and transmit conidia to their flowers, resulting in sclerotia (mummy-berry) formation."
https://openalex.org/W2063269255,"Theory predicts that selection should increase the ratio of the performance of a biological structure or system to the requirements placed upon it (that is, its safety factor) as conditions become increasingly unpredictable. Although conventional safety factors are rarely measurable, an alternative, truncation safety factor (the ratio of mean strength to maximum possible load), can be measured quantitatively for certain load-bearing structures. For intertidal limpet shells subject to prying forces, truncation safety factor was found to increase with increased variability in shell strength, thus providing direct support for the theory."

https://openalex.org/W2081651330,"The sun's differential rotation has a cyclic pattern of change that is tightly correlated with the sunspot, or magnetic activity, cycle. This pattern can be described as a torsional oscillation, in which the solar rotation is periodically sped up or slowed down in certain zones of latitude while elsewhere the rotation remains essentially steady. The zones of anomalous rotation move on the sun in wavelike fashion, keeping pace with and flanking the zones of magnetic activity. It is uncertain whether this torsional oscillation is a globally coherent ringing of the sun or whether it is a local pattern caused by and causing local changes in the magnetic fields. In either case, it may be an important link in the connection between the rotation and the cycle that is widely believed to exist but is not yet understood."

https://openalex.org/W1967164200,"Instrumentation, as the word is used here, means the development and application of measuring devices which respond quantitatively to some physical property of a situation and give an output which depends on this property. The word instrument is often used in a broader sense, as when forceps are referred to as surgical instruments, but in this discussion it refers to measuring devices."

https://openalex.org/W1974626535,"Pulsars with pulsation periods in the millisecond range are thought to be neutron stars that have acquired an extraordinarily short spin period through the accretion of stellar material spiraling down onto the neutron star from a nearby companion. Nearly all the angular momentum and most of the mass of the companion star is transferred to the neutron star. During this process, wherein the neutron star consumes its companion, it is required that a disk of stellar material be formed around the neutron star. In conventional models it is supposed that the disk is somehow lost when the accretion phase is finished, so that only the rapidly spinning neutron star remains. However, it is possible that, after the accretion phase, a residual disk remains in stable orbit around the neutron star. The end result of such an accretion process is an object that looks much like a miniature (about 100 kilometers), heavy version of Saturn: a central object (the neutron star) surrounded by a durable disk."
