https://openalex.org/W2070275679,"The Indian muntjac (Muntiacus muntjak) has a diploid chromosome number of 7 in the male and 6 in the female, the lowest number yet described in a mammal. Its near relative, Reeve's muntjac (Muntiacus reevesi) has a diploid number of 46, and the karyotypes of the two, species are very different."

https://openalex.org/W4248147233,The development of a radioimmunoassay for morphine is described. The hapten morphine is made antigenic by coupling it to a protein at the phenolic group of the molecule. Extremely low concentrations of morphine (0.5 nanogram) can be measured by this assay procedure.

Three homologous segments in each molecule, comprising approximately 45 percent of either peptide chain, have been found. These two proteins have apparently evolved from a common ancestor molecule."

https://openalex.org/W1986060387,"We have gathered, from the nests of dinosaurs, and living and fossil birds, some evidence of the environment in which these creatures lived. However, our isotope determinations suggest it will be impossible to resolve the problem as to whether the dinosaurs were warm-or cold-blooded from the oxygen and carbon isotopes content of their shells."
https://openalex.org/W2069062295,"Rats kept on an exclusive diet of yogurt avidly ate the yogurt, grew at a normal rate, were normally active, mated, conceived, and gave birth to normal, healthy litters. However, all of the rats developed cataracts. Cataracts appeared in young rats 2 to 3 months, and in adult rats 4 to 6 months, after initiation of the yogurt diet. Cataracts first manifested themselves in small vacuoles at the periphery of the lens and then in small striae extending toward the center of the lens. These striae progressively became longer, more coarse, and numerous until they coalesced, finally forming a mature white lens. The high content of galactose in commercially available yogurt could account in full for appearance of cataracts in 100 percent of the experimental animals. The cataracts appear to be the same as those produced by diets with a high content of galactose."

The Hückel correlations on three methoxylated amphetamines indicated that hallucinogenic activity correlated with energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital1.

https://openalex.org/W948297235,"Abstract Mitochondria were isolated from rat epididymal adipose tissue and shown to be functionally intact as judged from both the P:O and respiratory control ratios, and structurally intact as determined by electron microscopy. In the presence of pyruvate, ATP, inorganic phosphate, and magnesium ions, these mitochondria incorporated H14CO3- into organic acids. Citrate and malate were the main radioactive products, with citrate containing about two-thirds of the radioactivity fixed. With the use of a rapid syringe filtration method the efflux of the newly formed intermediates from the mitochondria was shown. The observed high rates of pyruvate carboxylation and citrate formation have been further supported by the levels of pyruvate carboxylase and citrate synthase in mitochondria. The deletion of inorganic phosphate from the incubation medium reduced the H14CO3- fixation presumably due to the accumulation of ADP. Pyruvate carboxylation was also inhibited by ADP even in the presence of ATP. Mitochondria were shown to metabolize exogenous labeled citrate and malate, and pyruvate caused a 5-fold increase in the formation of 14C-citrate from 14C-malate. The results suggest that pyruvate carboxylation is regulated, in part, by the levels of pyruvate and ATP in adipose tissue mitochondria. Our observations lend experimental evidence supporting the role of the mitochondria in supplying the precursors for the citrate cleavage and glyceroneogenic pathways in rat adipose tissue, and emphasize the important role of pyruvate carboxylase in lipogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1978345383,Red blood cells of 40 wild mice captured at four different locations in the Ann Arbor area were typed for the presence of 15 different H-2 antigens by direct hemagglutination test. Fifteen different phenotypes were found and all were different from those determined by known H-2 alleles of the laboratory mice. Great similarity between phenotypes of mice from the sane location was observed. This is interpreted as further evidence for the deme structure of natural mouse population.

https://openalex.org/W1558265097,"Abstract The synthesis and transfer of proteins by the liver to the plasma have been studied in rats fed a choline-supplemented or a choline-deficient diet for 1 to 3 days. In choline-deficient rats, the pool of circulating lipoproteins, but not that of albumin, is measurably reduced. Acute choline deficiency impairs neither the incorporation in vitro or in vivo of 14C-leucine into proteins by the liver nor the catabolism of plasma total proteins or of albumin. However, after injection of 14C-leucine the labeling of plasma albumin is delayed, while that of plasma lipoproteins is persistently lower in choline-deficient rats than in controls. The results suggest the rapid induction by choline deficiency of a defect in the intracellular transport and secretion into plasma of proteins synthesized by the liver. In the case of albumin the basic lesion appears to be a slowdown in its intracellular transport, with only a transient effect on its rate of secretion and an insignificant decrease of its pool in the circulation. In the case of plasma lipoproteins, however, the rate of secretion also appears to be significantly affected. These defects are in all likelihood related to changes in the membrane system of hepatocytes and to a failure in the conjugation of plasma lipoproteins, stemming from alterations in the synthesis of choline-containing phospholipids by the liver of choline-deficient rats."

https://openalex.org/W2045686160,"Phycomyces sporangiophores respond to four distinct physical stimuli: gravity, light, stretch, and an avoidance stimulus. Saturating the organism with a light stimulus so that it does not respond to any additional light program does not decrease its ability to respond to an avoidance stimulus. This demonstrates that the organism has the potential to respond after a saturating light stimulus and that the an avoidance stimulus acts at some point past or parellel or parellel to the light-receiving mechanism."

https://openalex.org/W2068664368,Total and differential counts of the peritoneal cells of male and female BALB/c mice aged 10 days to over 2 years demonstrate that the increase in cell number that occurs in mice over 2 months old is due entirely to an increase in lymphocytes. The number of peritoneal macrophages in BALB/c females is maintained at a constant level for 22 months. The stability of the macrophage population in contrast to the increase in numbers of lymphocytes suggests that the body pools of these two cell types are not related.
https://openalex.org/W2000678161,The latent period of the light-evoked receptor potential was increased by hyperpolarizing currents injected directly into doubly impaled retinular cells. Indirect hyperpolarization of these cells by injection of hyperpolarizing current into the eccentric cell or other intraommatidial retinular cells either shortened or did not change the latent period. The modification of the latent period may depend upon the direction of current flow across some regions of the membrane system constituting the rhabdomere. The reduction in magnitude of the receptor potential obtained with strong hyperpolarizing currents may also depend upon the direction of current flow. The results support the conclusion that the receptor potential originates in retinular cells within the membrane system of the rhabdomere.
https://openalex.org/W2008325709,"THE reactivity of both perfused and isolated segments of human, umbilical vessels to various pharmacological agents has already been reported1–5. Without exception, serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) has been found to be a potent constricting agent of both umbilical artery and vein. In porfusion studies, however, arteries and vein were generally not perfused simultaneously or, in cases where they were, drugs were administered only to the arterial perfusing fluid."
