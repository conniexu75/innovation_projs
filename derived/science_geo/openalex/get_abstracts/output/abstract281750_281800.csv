https://openalex.org/W2011079091,"The viscosity of a synthetic silicate liquid with the composition of a lunar rock has been determined experimentally and found to be lower than that of any previously studied volcanic rock on earth. This fact suggests that lunar lava flows will be very thin and extensive unless they are ponded, and that lava tubes should be common and of larger dimensions than those on earth. Coarse crystallinity can be a feature of rapidly cooled surface lavas."
https://openalex.org/W2124934574,"A reconnaissance expedition across the northern margin of the Tibetan plateau revealed evidence of a late Cenozoic northward progression of the locus of crustal shortening and, therefore, of a northward growth of the area encompassed by the plateau. Active reverse faults crop out at the foot of the Altyn Tagh, on the northern edge of the plateau, and at the bases of several ranges within the Altyn Tagh and Kunlun, where the elevations of the neighboring basins are less than 4000 meters. Farther south, where elevations are higher, there was no evidence of recent faulting, but late Cenozoic rock in the Ayak Kum KÃ¶l basin has been strongly folded. South of this basin, Ulugh Muztagh, apparently the highest mountain in the eastern Kunlun, is underlain by late Miocene, tourmaline-bearing and two-mica granite. These rocks suggest that thickening of continental crust had begun in this area by late Miocene time. Overlying quartz-sanidine welded tuffs of Pliocene age imply that uplift and erosion occurred between Miocene and Pliocene time, but with little subsequent erosion. In addition, we found an east-west trending belt of mafic and ultramafic rock that probably marks a suture of a crustal fragment with southern Asia in Triassic or more recent time."
https://openalex.org/W1990079425,The microarchitecture of gastropod nacre reveals deposition of aragonite in the form of crystal stacks and differs markedly from the characteristic microstructure of pelecypod nacre. The structure permits direct observation of both organic and mineral phases of deposition on a growth surface topography that is ideal for the study of processes of mollusk shell calcification. The stack mode of deposition is functionally useful to the animal because it increases the number of crystals which can form and develop on the growth surface at one time.
https://openalex.org/W2059113439,"Two pelagic copepods, Calanus helgolandicus and Gaussia princeps, contained wax esters with 28 to 44 carbon atoms as major lipid constituents. In laboratory cultures of the former species, changes in nutrition (amount or species of diatoms fed) affected both the amount of total lipid and the composition of the wax esters. Thus, the wax esters serve as a reserve energy store in this organism."

https://openalex.org/W2012144709,"Very high supersaturations ranging from 140 atmospheres for oxygen to more than 270 atmospheres for helium, were produced without Cavitation of the water at atmospheric pressure. Thus, the lower limits for de novo bubble formation are increased substantially over those previously obtained."
https://openalex.org/W2087809549,"Comparison of Pleistocene climatic records defined by variations in abundance of planktonic Foraminifera in three cores from the southeastern Pacific with similar records in cores from the Atlantic suggests that times of warm surface water in this region of the Pacific were at least partly synchronous with times of cool water in the Atlantic. This conclusion opposes the Milankovitch theory of the causation of ice ages, but it harmonizes with a modified form of Simpson's hypothesis."
https://openalex.org/W2061488852,"The predicted intensities of the ionized carbon dioxide (CO2+) emission feature at 2890 angstroms and the Fox-Duffendack-Barker bands are 5.2 and 19.9 kilorayleighs, respectively, for a vertical column. Direct photoionization of carbon dioxide by solar radiation contributes 3.5 and 4.1 kilorayleighs, respectively, and fluorescent scattering by CO2+, 1.6 and 15.3 kilorayleighs, respectively. Photoelectron impacts are less important."
https://openalex.org/W2060469493,"Before 1978 in China, the economic institutions for agriculture and industry operated essentially under a centrally planned system. The reasons for a change toward a more market-oriented economy and the key elements of economic reform are discussed. Today the major issues being deliberated by the leading economic officials include reform of the price system, the administrative structure of state-owned enterprises, the banking system and macroeconomic control mechanisms, and foreign trade and investment."

https://openalex.org/W2117152431,"Remains of Sigmodon minor and Sigmodon medius, extinct cotton rats comprising the medius species group, have been recovered from both Kansas and Arizona. Sigmodon minor evolved from Sigmodon medius, and the available evidence suggests that Kansas populations of Sigmodon minor were derived from Kansas populations of Sigmodon medius, while Arizona populations of Sigmodon minor were derived from Arizona populations of Sigmodon medius. This multiple origin of a single mammalian species is similar to the origin proposed by Carleton Coon for the races (subspecies) of Homo sapiens."
https://openalex.org/W2000720796,"Narten and Levy (1) argue that multi-phase models of- water structure have not been adequately enough
specified to allow a valid test against diffraction data, whereas they represent the one-phase model of Narten,
Danford, and Levy (2) as an adequately specified model. I wish-to point out that in fact the Narten-Danford-Levy model
is just as inadequately specified as are existing multi-phase models. The Narten-Danford-Levy model describes the average structure around any water
molecule on the basis of an arrangement of neighbors such as that in ice I, modified by the possible presence of
molecular vacancies and interstitial molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2017715075,"The pyramid at La Venta, Tabasco, Mexico, was surveyed in May 1969 with a high-sensitivity difference magnetometer. The general pattern of the magnetic map is one of low (10-gamma) radial anomalies, which reflect the ridge and gully topography of the pyramid, with a larger magnetic high area (+30 gammas) centered 25 meters south and 10 meters east of the center of the pyramid. The anomalous region near the top has been interpreted with the aid of computer-calculated anomalies from three-dimensional rectangular blocks. The major high is probably associated with a basalt structure that rises to within 1 to 2 meters of the surface. A possible form for this structure was found to be a 10-meter-square horizontal platform with walls along its northern and eastern margin."
