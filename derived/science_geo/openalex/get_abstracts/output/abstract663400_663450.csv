https://openalex.org/W3101906250,"A newly emerged coronavirus (COVID-19) seriously threatens human life and health worldwide. In coping and fighting against COVID-19, the most critical step is to effectively screen and diagnose infected patients. Among them, chest X-ray imaging technology is a valuable imaging diagnosis method. The use of computer-aided diagnosis to screen X-ray images of COVID-19 cases can provide experts with auxiliary diagnosis suggestions, which can reduce the burden of experts to a certain extent. In this study, we first used conventional transfer learning methods, using five pre-trained deep learning models, which the Xception model showed a relatively ideal effect, and the diagnostic accuracy reached 96.75%. In order to further improve the diagnostic accuracy, we propose an efficient diagnostic method that uses a combination of deep features and machine learning classification. It implements an end-to-end diagnostic model. The proposed method was tested on two datasets and performed exceptionally well on both of them. We first evaluated the model on 1102 chest X-ray images. The experimental results show that the diagnostic accuracy of Xception + SVM is as high as 99.33%. Compared with the baseline Xception model, the diagnostic accuracy is improved by 2.58%. The sensitivity, specificity and AUC of this model reached 99.27%, 99.38% and 99.32%, respectively. To further illustrate the robustness of our method, we also tested our proposed model on another dataset. Finally also achieved good results. Compared with related research, our proposed method has higher classification accuracy and efficient diagnostic performance. Overall, the proposed method substantially advances the current radiology based methodology, it can be very helpful tool for clinical practitioners and radiologists to aid them in diagnosis and follow-up of COVID-19 cases."
https://openalex.org/W3100872836,"Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) has rapidly infected millions of people worldwide. Recent studies suggest that racial minorities and patients with comorbidities are at higher risk of Covid-19. In this study, we analyzed the effects of clinical, regional, and genetic factors on Covid-19 positive status. Methods The UK Biobank is a longitudinal cohort study that recruited participants from 2006 to 2010 from throughout the United Kingdom. Covid-19 test results were provided to UK Biobank starting on March 16, 2020. The main outcome measure in this study was Covid-19 positive status, determined by the presence of any positive test for a single individual. Clinical risk factors were derived from UK Biobank at baseline, and regional risk factors were imputed using census features local to each participant’s home zone. We used robust adjusted Poisson regression with clustering by testing laboratory to estimate relative risk. Blood types were derived using genetic variants rs8176719 and rs8176746, and genomewide tests of association were conducted using logistic-Firth hybrid regression. Results This prospective cohort study included 397,064 UK Biobank participants, of whom 968 tested positive for Covid-19. The unadjusted relative risk of Covid-19 for Black participants was 3.66 (95% CI 2.83–4.74), compared to White participants. Adjusting for Townsend deprivation index alone reduced the relative risk to 2.44 (95% CI 1.86–3.20). Comorbidities that significantly increased Covid-19 risk included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (adjusted relative risk [ARR] 1.64, 95% CI 1.18–2.27), ischemic heart disease (ARR 1.48, 95% CI 1.16–1.89), and depression (ARR 1.32, 95% CI 1.03–1.70). There was some evidence that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ARR 1.48, 95% CI 1.13–1.93) were associated with increased risk of Covid-19. Each standard deviation increase in the number of total individuals living in a participant’s locality was associated with increased risk of Covid-19 (ARR 1.14, 95% CI 1.08–1.20). Analyses of genetically inferred blood types confirmed that participants with type A blood had increased odds of Covid-19 compared to participants with type O blood (odds ratio [OR] 1.16, 95% CI 1.01–1.33). A meta-analysis of genomewide association studies across ancestry groups did not reveal any significant loci. Study limitations include confounding by indication, bias due to limited information on early Covid-19 test results, and inability to accurately gauge disease severity. Conclusions When assessing the association of Black race with Covid-19, adjusting for deprivation reduced the relative risk of Covid-19 by 33%. In the context of sociological research, these findings suggest that discrimination in the labor market may play a role in the high relative risk of Covid-19 for Black individuals. In this study, we also confirmed the association of blood type A with Covid-19, among other clinical and regional factors."
https://openalex.org/W3101787818,"Objective This study aims to explore the mechanism of the miR-424-5p/E2F7 axis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and provide new ideas for targeted therapy of HCC. Methods Bioinformatics analysis was used to identify the target differentially expressed miRNA in HCC and predict its target gene. qRT-PCR was employed to verify the expression of miR-424-5p and E2F7 mRNA in HCC cells. Western blot was performed to detect the effect of miR-424-5p ectopic expression on the protein expression of E2F7. CCK-8 was used to detect proliferative activity of HCC cells and flow cytometry was carried out for analyzing cell cycle distribution. Dual luciferase reporter assay was conducted to verify the direct targeting relationship between miR-424-5p and E2F7. Results We observed that miR-424-5p was down-regulated in HCC cells. CCK-8 showed that overexpression of miR-424-5p inhibited cell proliferation, and flow cytometry showed that miR-424-5p could block cells in G0/G1 phase. E2F7 was up-regulated in HCC cells, and E2F7 overexpression could facilitate the proliferative ability of HCC cells and promote the cell cycle progressing from G0/G1 to S phase. Furthermore, dual-luciferase reporter assay indicated that miR-424-5p could directly down-regulate E2F7 expression. Analysis on cell function demonstrated that miR-424-5p inhibited the proliferation of HCC cells and blocked cell cycle at G0/G1 phase by targeting E2F7. Conclusion Our results proved that E2F7 was a direct target of miR-424-5p, and miR-424-5p could regulate cell cycle and further inhibit the proliferation of HCC cells by targeting E2F7."

https://openalex.org/W3100724661,"Species distribution models can help predicting range shifts under climate change. The aim of this study is to investigate the late Quaternary distribution of Oriental beech ( Fagus orientalis ) and to project future distribution ranges under different climate change scenarios using a combined palaeobotanical, phylogeographic, and modelling approach. Five species distribution modelling algorithms under the R-package `biomod2`were applied to occurrence data of Fagus orientalis to predict distributions under present, past (Last Glacial Maximum, 21 ka, Mid-Holocene, 6 ka), and future climatic conditions with different scenarios obtained from MIROC-ESM and CCSM4 global climate models. Distribution models were compared to palaeobotanical and phylogeographic evidence. Pollen data indicate northern Turkey and the western Caucasus as refugia for Oriental beech during the Last Glacial Maximum. Although pollen records are missing, molecular data point to Last Glacial Maximum refugia in northern Iran. For the mid-Holocene, pollen data support the presence of beech in the study region. Species distribution models predicted present and Last Glacial Maximum distribution of Fagus orientalis moderately well yet underestimated mid-Holocene ranges. Future projections under various climate scenarios indicate northern Iran and the Caucasus region as major refugia for Oriental beech. Combining palaeobotanical, phylogeographic and modelling approaches is useful when making projections about distributions of plants. Palaeobotanical and molecular evidence reject some of the model projections. Nevertheless, the projected range reduction in the Caucasus region and northern Iran highlights their importance as long-term refugia, possibly related to higher humidity, stronger environmental and climatic heterogeneity and strong vertical zonation of the forest vegetation."
https://openalex.org/W3102917799,"The duration and intensity of future heat waves are analyzed for 53 cities in the Middle East and the North Africa (MENA) region for the 21 st century under two different scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). A consistent approach is carried out using data from 13 Regional models within the framework of the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX). By the end of the century, 80% of the most populated MENA cities are expected to be at least 50% of the days under heat wave conditions during the warm season. In addition, the mean and maximum intensity of the heat waves will also increase. Changes in the duration and intensity of heat waves have shown to be negatively correlated. Therefore, the vulnerability of the MENA cities to future heat waves was determined using a cumulative index (CI) that takes into account both duration and intensity. This CI indicates that Middle East and the eastern part of Africa will suffer the most unfavorable temperature conditions in the future. Assuming no intervention trough adaptation/mitigation strategies, these results, together with the particular properties of the MENA region, such as aridity or lack of precipitation, make it likely that the area will be affected by disease or famine."
https://openalex.org/W3102421218,"8-Oxoguanine glycosylase (OGG1) is a base excision repair enzyme responsible for the recognition and removal of 8-oxoguanine, a commonly occurring oxidized DNA modification. OGG1 prevents the accumulation of mutations and regulates the transcription of various oxidative stress–response genes. In addition to targeting DNA, oxidative stress can affect proteins like OGG1 itself, specifically at cysteine residues. Previous work has shown that the function of OGG1 is sensitive to oxidants, with the cysteine residues of OGG1 being the most likely site of oxidation. Due to the integral role of OGG1 in maintaining cellular homeostasis under oxidative stress, it is important to understand the effect of oxidants on OGG1 and the role of cysteines in its structure and function. In this study, we investigate the role of the cysteine residues in the function of OGG1 by mutating and characterizing each cysteine residue. Our results indicate that the cysteines in OGG1 fall into four functional categories: those that are necessary for (1) glycosylase activity (C146 and C255), (2) lyase activity (C140S, C163, C241, and C253), and (3) structural stability (C253) and (4) those with no known function (C28 and C75). These results suggest that under conditions of oxidative stress, cysteine can be targeted for modifications, thus altering the response of OGG1 and affecting its downstream cellular functions. 8-Oxoguanine glycosylase (OGG1) is a base excision repair enzyme responsible for the recognition and removal of 8-oxoguanine, a commonly occurring oxidized DNA modification.

Specifically, OGG1 has been shown to bind 8-oxoG in G-rich promoter regions and regulate the expression of certain oxidative stress–response genes. The binding of OGG1 to promoter regions may have several consequences depending on whether this binding is productive (leads to enzymatic activity) or nonproductive (no enzymatic activity). For example, the nonproductive binding of OGG1 to promoter regions leads to increased expression of certain proinflammatory genes (CXCL1, CXCL2, CCL20, IL1B, TNFA), indicating that OGG1 glycosylase activity is not necessary for this function (25Wang R.

Immunol. 2014; 192: 2384-2394Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). On the other hand, productive binding leading to glycosylase activity has been shown to be required for the regulation of hypoxia-induced genes and DNA repair genes (VEGF, NTHL1, NEIL3) (21Fleming A.M. Ding Y. Burrows C.J. Oxidative DNA damage is epigenetic by regulating gene transcription via base excision repair.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Human NEIL3 gene expression regulated by epigenetic-like oxidative DNA modification.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2019; 141: 11036-11049Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). After OGG1 binds and forms an abasic site, DNA is rearranged into a G-quadruplex to expose the abasic site. APE1 is recruited but nonproductively binds the abasic site, leading to transcriptional activation of the aforementioned genes. Another possible outcome of productive binding is the formation of a DNA break, which has been shown to be important for the regulation of BCL2 expression (20Perillo B. Ombra M.N. Bertoni A. Cuozzo C. Sacchetti S. Sasso A. Chiariotti L. Malorni A. Abbondanza C. Avvedimento E.V. DNA oxidation as triggered by H3K9me2 demethylation drives estrogen-induced gene expression.Science. 2008; 319: 202-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Because OGG1 plays a central role in maintaining cellular homeostasis under oxidative stress, it is important to have a full understanding of the effect of oxidation on OGG1. In addition to DNA, proteins involved in the cellular response to stress such as OGG1 can also be oxidized, specifically at cysteine residues. Cysteine is a unique amino acid that is highly conserved but can be targeted for modification by oxidation due to the high reactivity of the sulfur atom (29Paulsen C.E. Carroll K.S. Cysteine-mediated redox signaling: chemistry, biology, and tools for discovery.Chem. Rev. 2013; 113: 4633-4679Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the oxidation of cysteine increases the functional diversity of proteins by two orders of magnitude (30Walsh C. Posttranslational Modification of Proteins: Expanding Nature's Inventory. Roberts and Co Publishers, Englewood, CO2006Google Scholar). Thus, it is important to understand the role of cysteines in the structure and function of OGG1. Previous studies have suggested that the glycosylase activity of OGG1 is sensitive to specific environmental toxins, like cadmium (31Bravard A. Vacher M. Gouget B. Coutant A. de Boisferon F.H. Marsin S. Chevillard S. Radicella J.P. Redox regulation of human OGG1 activity in response to cellular oxidative stress.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 7430-7436Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and arsenic (32Ebert F. Weiss A. Bultemeyer M. Hamann I. Hartwig A. Schwerdtle T. Arsenicals affect base excision repair by several mechanisms.Mutat. Res. 2011; 715: 32-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Specifically, the excision efficiency of 8-oxoG by OGG1 is decreased in the presence of cadmium or arsenic, both of which have high affinity for binding to the sulfhydryl group of cysteine (33Shen S. Li X.F. Cullen W.R. Weinfeld M. Le X.C. Arsenic binding to proteins.Chem. Rev. 2013; 113: 7769-7792Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). This decrease in efficiency indicates that cysteines are important for regulating the various catalytic functions of OGG1 in order to maintain cellular homeostasis under oxidative stress. OGG1 contains eight cysteine residues that are highly conserved across species (Fig. 1). C28 and C75 are located in the N-terminus, and C253 and C255 are located in the C-terminus. C241, C253, and C255 are within the highly conserved helix–hairpin–helix motif of the enzyme. In this study, we created eight mutants, each containing a single-site cysteine-to-serine mutation. This mutation was chosen to mimic the size of cysteine whilst replacing the sulfhydryl (SH) group with a hydroxyl (OH) group in serine. In each of the eight mutants, we tested DNA binding, glycosylase and lyase activities, and thermal stability. Our results shed light on the importance of certain cysteine residues in the structural and functional characteristics of OGG1. We propose that the modification of certain cysteines can lead to a mild loss of OGG1’s binding affinity to the DNA lesion, in addition to a change in its glycosylase function, and/or its thermal instability, all of which can regulate downstream functions of OGG1. Our results indicate that the cysteines in OGG1 fall into four functional categories: those that are necessary for (1) glycosylase activity (C146 and C255), (2) lyase activity (C140S, C163, C241, and C253), (3) structural stability (C253) and (4) those with no known function (C28 and C75). OGG1 contains eight cysteine residues. However, little is known about their role in the activity of OGG1. To identify whether OGG1 contains reactive cysteines and whether they are important for activity, we treated OGG1 with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) and tested the effect of blocking the potentially reactive cysteines on glycosylase activity (Fig. 2A). NEM is specifically reactive with the thiol group of cysteine and blocks the sulfhydryl group. In the presence of 0.25 mM NEM (10× molar excess of OGG1), the glycosylase activity of OGG1 is completely abolished. This finding indicates that OGG1 contains reactive cysteine residues that are essential for glycosylase activity. Next, 5-({2-[(iodoacetyl)amino]ethyl}amino)naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid (IAEDANS), a thiol-reactive fluorescent molecule, was combined with OGG1 to quantify the least number of reactive cysteines required to inhibit the activity. The absorbance and extinction coefficient of IAEDANS (ε336 = 6100 M−1 s−1) and OGG1 (ε280 = 37,000 M−1 s−1) were used to identify the labeling ratio. In the presence of 0.25 mM IAEDANS (10× molar excess of OGG1), two cysteine residues were labeled, which was sufficient to inhibit the glycosylase activity (Fig. 2B). These results provide evidence that cysteines are important for the activity of OGG1. In order to understand the role of cysteines in DNA binding, an electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed using a DNA substrate containing the 8-oxoG lesion. The assay was performed at 4 °C in order to prevent any catalytic activity (34van der Kemp P.A. Charbonnier J.B. Audebert M. Boiteux S. Catalytic and DNA-binding properties of the human Ogg1 DNA N-glycosylase/AP lyase: biochemical exploration of H270, Q315 and F319, three amino acids of the 8-oxoguanine-binding pocket.Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 570-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The results indicate that WT OGG1 binds tightly to its DNA substrate containing the lesion opposite a templating cytosine with a dissociation constant of 1.9 nM (Fig. 3, A and C). However, most of the cysteine mutants bind to the DNA with an altered affinity. Specifically, mutations at positions 28, 140, 146, 241, 253, and 255 have an ∼10-fold increase in the dissociation constant. The decreased binding affinity in C28S was unexpected due to its distal location from the DNA binding site and the active site. This finding indicates that C28 may influence DNA binding through long-range interactions. The increase in the dissociation constant of both C253S and C255S is expected due to their proximal location in the helix-hairpin-helix motif near the DNA binding site. Specifically, C253 has been shown to be part of the active site, which interacts with the lesion once it is extruded into the active site (35Bruner S.D. Norman D.P. Verdine G.L. Structural basis for recognition and repair of the endogenous mutagen 8-oxoguanine in DNA.Nature. 2000; 403: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). Lastly, not much is known about the role of C140, C146, and C241 in the function of OGG1. Because they are located near the DNA binding pocket, a mutation at any of these positions is expected to have an effect on the dissociation constant despite the lack of direct contact with DNA. Our findings show that mutations at these positions do, in fact, cause an increase in the dissociation constant. Thus, we provide evidence here that although most cysteines lack direct interactions with DNA, they are important for DNA binding, with C28, C140, C146, C241, C253, and C255 being especially crucial for this function. In addition to exhibiting substrate specificity for the 8-oxoG lesion over other oxidized lesions, WT OGG1 also preferentially binds to 8-oxoG:C (specific binding) over 8-oxoG:A (nonspecific binding) substrates (17Zharkov D.O. Rosenquist T.A. Gerchman S.E. Grollman A.P. Substrate specificity and reaction mechanism of murine 8-oxoguanine-DNA glycosylase.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28607-28617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). This selectivity is a mechanism to prevent the repair of mispaired 8-oxoG:A and the propagation of error. In this study, we investigate whether the cysteine mutations influence the specific and nonspecific binding of OGG1. As previously mentioned, our results show that compared with WT, OGG1 with cysteine mutations has a lower specific binding affinity (dissociation constants of 1.9 nM for WT and 2.3–15.8 for the mutants). On the other hand, the nonspecific binding affinities (to 8-oxoG:A) of the mutant OGG1 compared with that of the WT do not differ considerably (dissociation constants of 113–507 nM and 201 nM, respectively) (Fig. 3, B–C). The results indicate that OGG1 binds specifically to its substrate and that the cysteine mutations only influence specific binding but not nonspecific binding. The ability of each of the cysteine mutants to catalyze the removal of 8-oxoG and create an abasic site was tested in the presence of excess OGG1 (10× molar excess relative to DNA) to ensure that the reaction is not limited by percent active enzyme and by the slow rate of DNA dissociation (36Sassa A. Beard W.A. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. DNA sequence context effects on the glycosylase activity of human 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 36702-36710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The reaction was performed using the quench-flow apparatus, which rapidly mixes OGG1 with the DNA and quenches the reaction with NaOH at selected time points (the alkaline hydrolysis reaction cleaves the DNA backbone at abasic sites). The lyase activity of OGG1 is the rate-limiting step in the reaction of OGG1; therefore, NaOH is used to ensure that the observed rate is not limited by the rate of the lyase activity (37Lukina M.V. Popov A.V. Koval V.V. Vorobjev Y.N. Fedorova O.S. Zharkov D.O. DNA damage processing by human 8-oxoguanine-DNA glycosylase mutants with the occluded active site.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 28936-28947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Fraction product formed was plotted as a function of time and fitted to a single exponential equation. The results indicate that WT OGG1 catalyzes glycosylase activity with a rate of 0.53 s−1 (Fig. 4). The results indicate that the C146S mutant has a slow glycosylase rate (0.22 s−1). Thus, a modification at this site can decrease the glycosylase activity. C146 is located near the active site, but there are no direct interactions with the lesion and DNA. The shortest distance between C146 and the lesion is 5 Å, with no apparent intermediate molecules between them. Therefore, C146 might be important for stabilizing the extruded lesion or it might be involved in recognizing and flipping the lesion out of the duplex. The most severe loss in activity resulted from the C255S mutation, with a rate of 0.004 s−1. This finding corresponds with the location of C255 near the active site, which likely makes C255 essential for the glycosylase activity. Both C253 and C255 are located within the same helix, with the closest distance being 4.3 Å between the pair. As previously discussed, C253 has been shown to be a part of the active site, important for binding the lesion once it is extruded out of the DNA duplex and into the active site (35Bruner S.D. Norman D.P. Verdine G.L. Structural basis for recognition and repair of the endogenous mutagen 8-oxoguanine in DNA.Nature. 2000; 403: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). Previous work has shown that a mutation of C253 to leucine or isoleucine decreases the activity severely (37Lukina M.V. Popov A.V. Koval V.V. Vorobjev Y.N. Fedorova O.S. Zharkov D.O. DNA damage processing by human 8-oxoguanine-DNA glycosylase mutants with the occluded active site.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 28936-28947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, our results indicate that a mutation to serine has no effect on the glycosylase activity. We hypothesize that the bulkiness of the group at position 253 in previous studies affected OGG1 glycosylase activity, as leucine and isoleucine have bulkier side chains than cysteine and serine. Interestingly, the C140S mutant led to an increase in the glycosylase rate (1.0 s−1). The mechanism is unclear because of the lack of direct interactions between C140 and the active site. This finding provides evidence that there could be several consequences to the modification of cysteines depending on the site and type of modification (bulkiness and charge). The lyase activity of OGG1 results in the formation of a nicked DNA backbone at the 5’ end of the lesion, leaving a 3’ PUA and a 5’ phosphate. In the BER pathway, the PUA group is further processed by APE1 to form a 3’OH, which is the substrate for the subsequent nucleotide incorporation reaction by polymerase beta. The lyase activity was tested by mixing OGG1 with the 8-oxoG–containing DNA substrate at 37 °C and quenching the reaction at each time point with formamide dye followed by incubation at 85 °C for 5 min. The results in Figure 5A indicate that WT OGG1 catalyzes the lyase reaction at a rate of 0.0028 s−1. Even though the rate of lyase activity is slow, the long residence time of the protein on DNA due to the slow rate of DNA dissociation provides ample time for the enzyme to perform its lyase activity. All cysteine-to-serine mutants clustering near the active site at the C-terminus have a decreased lyase activity compared with WT, including C140S, 146, 163, 241, 253, 255 (Fig. 5A). This finding indicates that the lyase activity is highly sensitive to the status of cysteines. To ensure that the decrease in lyase activity is not resulting from a change in DNA binding to the abasic site, we measured the apparent binding affinity of the enzyme to a DNA substrate containing tetrahydrofuran (THF), which is a stable mimic of the abasic site. Our results indicate that WT OGG1 has a dissociation constant of 0.6 nM. Although a few cysteine mutants have higher dissociation constants, specifically C28S (2.2 nM), C146S (9.9 nM), and C241S (3.5 nM), most mutants have dissociation constants that are very similar to WT and they maintain their high binding capacity to the THF-containing substrate (Fig. 5B). This finding indicates that the decrease in lyase activity is not due to a change in DNA binding. In order to test the role of each of the cysteine residues in maintaining the structural stability of OGG1, protein ellipticity at 208 nm was measured as a function of temperature using circular dichroism spectrometry (Fig. 6). This wavelength was used because the protein is mostly ⍺-helical (Fig. 6A). The WT has a melting point (Tm) of 43 °C, similar to previous reports (38Mouzakis K.D. Wu T. Haushalter K.A. Thermostability and excision activity of polymorphic forms of hOGG1.BMC Res. Notes. 2019; 12: 92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). The most significant loss in stability resulted from the C140 and C253 mutations, leading to a Tm of less than 37 °C (36.3 and 33.6 °C, respectively). C140 is located within an ⍺-helix, and a mutation at this position may lead to instability. C253 is located at the active site and has been shown to be important for the catalytic activity (35Bruner S.D. Norman D.P. Verdine G.L. Structural basis for recognition and repair of the endogenous mutagen 8-oxoguanine in DNA.Nature. 2000; 403: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). These results indicate that cysteine modifications may influence the structural stability of the enzyme. OGG1 is a key enzyme involved in various processes and is responsible for maintaining cellular homeostasis in response to oxidative stress. In this study, we propose that the cysteines in OGG1 act to regulate the various functions of the protein, especially under conditions of oxidative stress. In order to study the role of cysteines in the function of the protein, we created individual cysteine-to-serine mutants and biochemically characterized them. The cysteines of OGG1 fall into four functional categories: those that are necessary for (1) glycosylase activity (C146 and C255), (2) lyase activity (C140S, C163, C241, and C253), (3Collins A.R. Oxidative DNA damage, antioxidants, and cancer.Bioessays. 1999; 21: 238-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) structural stability (C253) and (4) those with no known function (C28 and C75). Thus, a modification at specific cysteine positions may lead to different consequences in the cell. As a part of the BER pathway, OGG1 searches the DNA for oxidized lesions and binds specifically to the 8-oxoG lesion that is paired with cytosine (18Bjoras M. Luna L. Johnsen B. Hoff E. Haug T. Rognes T. Seeberg E. Opposite base-dependent reactions of a human base excision repair enzyme on DNA containing 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine and abasic sites.EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6314-6322Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The recognition of 8-oxoG:C and removal of the lesion by OGG1 serves two functions. First, the removal of the 8-oxoG lesion prevents the preferred misincorporation of adenine opposite of the 8-oxoG by replicative and repair polymerases. Second, the decreased selectivity for repairing 8-oxoG:A lesions compared with 8-oxoG:C lesions prevents the accumulation of guanine-to-thymine transversion mutations"
https://openalex.org/W3098302037,"A second cluster of COVID-19 cases imported from Europe occured in Vietnam from early March 2020. We describe 44 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive patients (cycle threshold value &lt;30) admitted to the National Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Hanoi between March 6 and April 15 2020. Whole SARS-CoV-2 genomes from these patients were sequenced using Illumina Miseq and analysed for common genetic variants and relationships to local and globally circulating strains. Results showed that 32 cases were Vietnamese with a median age of 37 years (range 15–74 years), and 23 were male. Most cases were acquired outside Vietnam, mainly from the UK (n = 15), other European countries (n = 14), Russia (n = 6) and countries in Asia (n = 3). No cases had travelled from China. Forty-one cases had symptoms at admission, typically dry cough (n = 36), fever (n = 20), sore throat (n = 14) and diarrhoea (n = 12). Hospitalisation was long with a median of 25 days, most commonly from 20–29 days. All SARS-CoV-2 genomes were similar (92–100% sequence homology) to the reference sequence Wuhan_1 (NC_045512), and 32 strains belonged to the B.1.1 lineage. The three most common variants were linked, and included C3037T, C14408T (nsp12: P323L) and A23403G (S: D614G) mutations. This group of mutations often accompanied variant C241T (39/44 genomes) or GGG 28881..28883 AAC (33/44 genomes). The prevalence of the former reflected probable European origin of viruses, and the transition D614G was dominant in Vietnam. New variants were identified; however, none could be associated with disease severity."
https://openalex.org/W3098912474,"In recent years, a new and promising construct has attracted the attention of organizational research: Workplace spirituality. To investigate the role of workplace spirituality in organizational contexts, two studies were carried out. Study 1 explored the mediation role of workplace spirituality in the relationship between positive supervisor behaviors and employee burnout. Results showed that workplace spirituality strongly contributes to reduce burnout and mediates the effect of supervisor integrity in reducing this threat. Study 2 considered the relationships of workplace spirituality with positive affectivity, resilience, self-efficacy, and work engagement. In particular, workplace spirituality profiles were investigated through latent profile analysis (LPA). Findings showed that workplace spirituality is related to higher positive affectivity, resilience, self-efficacy, and work engagement. In contrast, a workplace spirituality profile characterized by a low-intensity spiritual experience is associated with higher negative feelings. The practical implications of these findings are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3102263539,"A 400-estimator gradient boosting classifier was trained to predict survival probabilities of trauma patients. The National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB) provided 799233 complete patient records (778303 survivors and 20930 deaths) each containing 32 features, a number further reduced to only 8 features via the permutation importance method. Importantly, the 8 features can all be readily determined at admission: systolic blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature, oxygen saturation, gender, age and Glasgow coma score. Since death was rare, a rebalanced training set was used to train the model. The model is able to predict a survival probability for any trauma patient and accurately distinguish between a deceased and survived patient in 92.4% of all cases. Partial dependence curves (P survival vs. feature value) obtained from the trained model revealed the global importance of Glasgow coma score, age, and systolic blood pressure while pulse rate, respiratory rate, temperature, oxygen saturation, and gender had more subtle single variable influences. Shapley values, which measure the relative contribution of each of the 8 features to individual patient risk, were computed for several patients and were able to quantify patient-specific warning signs. Using the NTDB to sample across numerous patient traumas and hospital protocols, the trained model and Shapley values rapidly provides quantitative insight into which combination of variables in an 8-dimensional space contributed most to each trauma patient’s predicted global risk of death upon emergency room admission."
https://openalex.org/W3105650398,"Background and aim Most patients who present with a fourth ventricle tumor have concurrent hydrocephalus, and some demonstrate persistent hydrocephalus after tumor resection. There is still no consensus on the management of hydrocephalus in patients with fourth ventricle tumor after surgery. The purpose of this study was to identify the factors that predispose to postoperative hydrocephalus and the need for a postoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversion procedure. Materials and methods We performed a retrospective analysis of patients who underwent surgery of the fourth ventricle tumor between January 2013 and December 2018 at the Department of Neurosurgery in West China Hospital of Sichuan University. The characteristics of patients and the tumor location, tumor size, tumor histology, and preventive external ventricular drainage (EVD) that were potentially correlated with CSF circulation were evaluated in univariate and multivariate analysis. Results A total of 121 patients were enrolled in our study; 16 (12.9%) patients underwent postoperative CSF drainage. Univariate analysis revealed that superior extension (p = 0.004), preoperative hydrocephalus (p&lt;0.001), and subtotal resection (p&lt;0.001) were significantly associated with postoperative hydrocephalus. Multivariate analysis revealed that superior extension (p = 0.013; OR = 44.761; 95% CI 2.235–896.310) and subtotal resection (p = 0.005; OR = 0.087; 95% CI 0.016–0.473) were independent risk factors for postoperative hydrocephalus after resection of fourth ventricle tumor. Conclusion Superior tumor extension (into the aqueduct) and failed total resection of tumor were identified as independent risk factors for postoperative hydrocephalus in patients with fourth ventricle tumor."
https://openalex.org/W3100761568,"Background Due to the multiple health benefits of breastfeeding, it is essential to identify factors that may negatively interfere with this healthy practice. Among such factors are postpartum depression (PPD) and maternal satisfaction with breastfeeding. The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between maternal satisfaction with breastfeeding and symptoms of PPD in the first month after childbirth. Methods This cross-sectional study nested in a cohort study was conducted in Porto Alegre, Brazil, with 287 puerperal women selected at two maternity hospitals, one public and one private. Women were interviewed at their homes the week after the infant completed 30 days of life. A structured questionnaire was applied, as well as instruments to evaluate maternal satisfaction with breastfeeding (Maternal Breastfeeding Evaluation Scale) and to screen for PPD (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale). The association between higher satisfaction with breastfeeding (outcome) and negative PPD screening test was assessed using Poisson regression with robust variance, adjusting for specific covariables. Adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) and respective 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were estimated. Results The prevalence of increased satisfaction with breastfeeding (defined as women with scores above the median) was 47% higher among women who screened negative for PPD when compared to those with a positive result (aPR 1.47; 95%CI 1.01–2.16). This result was adjusted for maternal age and skin color, cohabitation with the infant’s father, planned pregnancy, type of delivery, exclusive breastfeeding, and occurrence of breastfeeding problems. Conclusions The findings of this study showed an association between higher maternal satisfaction with breastfeeding and absence of PPD symptoms, reinforcing the importance of caring for the mental health of pregnant and puerperal women and paying attention to their satisfaction with breastfeeding."
https://openalex.org/W3104061652,"We report a large-scale, quantitative investigation of manual gestures that speakers perform when speaking metaphorically about numerical quantities. We used the TV News Archive–an online database of over 2 million English language news broadcasts–to examine 681 videos in which 584 speakers used the phrase 'tiny number', 'small number', 'large number', or 'huge number', which metaphorically frame numerical quantity in terms of physical size. We found that the gestures speakers used reflect a number of different strategies to express the metaphoric size of quantities. When referring to greater versus lesser quantities, speakers were far more likely to gesture (1) with an open versus closed hand configuration, (2) with an outward versus inward movement, and (3) with a wider distance between the gesturing hands. These patterns were often more pronounced for the phrases containing more extreme adjectives ('tiny/huge number'). However, we did not find that speakers performed two-handed versus one-handed gestures. Nor did we find that speakers performed right-handed versus left-handed gestures, when referring to greater versus lesser quantities. Overall, this work supports the claim that metaphoric thought is involved in the production of verbal metaphors that describe numerical magnitudes. It demonstrates that size-based numerical associations observed in previous lab experiments are active in real-life communication outside the lab."
https://openalex.org/W3099464868,"Background and objective Resuscitative Endovascular Balloon Occlusion of Aorta (REBOA) has emerged as a potential life-saving maneuver for the management of non-compressible torso hemorrhage in trauma patients. Complete REBOA (cREBOA) is inherently associated with the burden of ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) and organ dysfunction. However, the distal organ inflammation and its association with organ injury have been little investigated. This study was conducted to assess these adverse effects of cREBOA following massive hemorrhage in swine. Methods Spontaneously breathing and consciously sedated Sinclair pigs were subjected to exponential hemorrhage of 65% total blood volume over 60 minutes. Animals were randomized into 3 groups (n = 7): (1) Positive control (PC) received immediate transfusion of shed blood after hemorrhage, (2) 30min-cREBOA (A30) received Zone 1 cREBOA for 30 minutes, and (3) 60min-cREBOA (A60) given Zone 1 cREBOA for 60 minutes. The A30 and A60 groups were followed by resuscitation with shed blood post-cREBOA and observed for 4h. Metabolic and hemodynamic effects, coagulation parameters, inflammatory and end organ consequences were monitored and assessed. Results Compared with 30min-cREBOA, 60min-cREBOA resulted in (1) increased IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β in distal organs (kidney, jejunum, and liver) ( p &lt; 0.05) and decreased reduced glutathione in kidney and liver ( p &lt; 0.05), (2) leukopenia, neutropenia, and coagulopathy ( p &lt; 0.05), (3) blood pressure decline ( p &lt; 0.05), (4) metabolic acidosis and hyperkalemia ( p &lt; 0.05), and (5) histological injury of kidney and jejunum ( p &lt; 0.05) as well as higher levels of creatinine, AST, and ALT ( p &lt; 0.05). Conclusion 30min-cREBOA seems to be a feasible and effective adjunct in supporting central perfusion during severe hemorrhage. However, prolonged cREBOA (60min) adverse effects such as distal organ inflammation and injury must be taken into serious consideration."
https://openalex.org/W3102010871,"The Arctic Tern ( Sterna paradisaea ; takatakiaq in Inuttitut) breeds in the circumpolar Arctic and undertakes the longest known annual migration. In recent decades, Arctic Tern populations have been declining in some parts of their range, and this has been a cause of concern for both wildlife managers and Indigenous harvesters. However, limited scientific information is available on Arctic Tern abundance and distribution, especially within its breeding range in remote areas of the circumpolar Arctic. Knowledge held by Inuit harvesters engaged in Arctic Tern egg picking can shed light on the ecology, regional abundance and distribution of this marine bird. We conducted individual interviews and a workshop involving 12 Inuit harvesters and elders from Kuujjuaraapik, Nunavik (northern Québec), Canada, to gather their knowledge of Arctic Tern cultural importance, ecology, and stewardship. Interview contributors reported a regional decline in Arctic Tern numbers which appeared in the early 2000s on nesting islands near Kuujjuaraapik. Six possible factors were identified: (1) local harvest through egg picking; (2) nest disturbance and predation; (3) abandonment of tern nesting areas (i.e., islands that have become connected to the mainland due to isostatic rebound); (4) climate change; (5) natural abundance cycles within the Arctic Tern population; and (6) decline of the capelin ( Mallotus villosus ) in the region. Recommendations from Inuit contributors related to Arctic Tern stewardship and protection included: (1) conduct more research; (2) let nature take its course; (3) conduct an awareness campaign; (4) implement an egg picking ban; (5) coordinate local egg harvest; (6) start ‘tern farming’; (7) protect Arctic Terns across their migration route; and (8) harvest foxes predating on terns. Our study highlighted complementarities between Inuit knowledge and ecological science, and showed that Inuit harvesters can make substantial contributions to ongoing and future Arctic tern research and management initiatives."

We designed a retrospective cohort study that included adult patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who had at least 2 positive nasopharyngeal tests at least 24 hours apart to study the correlation between the change in the genomic load of SARS-CoV-2, as reflected by the Cycle threshold (Ct) value of the RT-PCR, with change in clinical status. The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score was used as a surrogate for patients’ clinical status. Among 457 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia between 3/31/2020-4/10/2020, we identified 42 patients who met the inclusion criteria. The median initial SOFA score was 2 (IQR 2–3). 20 out of 42 patients had a lower SOFA score on their subsequent tests. We identified a statistically significant inverse correlation between the change in SOFA score and change in the Ct value with a decrease in SOFA score by 0.05 (SE 0.02; p&lt;0.05) for an increase in Ct values by 1. This correlation was independent of the duration of symptoms.

Using immunohistochemical staining and tissue microarrays, we assayed the expression of adipophilin in 61 patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) who underwent surgery from January 2006–December 2018. Relapse-free survival (RFS) and its risk factors were analyzed based on adipophilin expression. Fourteen (23.0%) patients expressed adipophilin. As compared to the adipophilin-negative TNBC patients, adipophilin-positive patients exhibited poor RFS ( p = 0 . 032 ). Among the TNBC patients with a high Ki-67 labeling index, patients negative for adipophilin exhibited better RFS than patients positive for adipophilin ( p = 0 . 032 ). Moreover, among patients who did not undergo adjuvant chemotherapy, patients negative for adipophilin expression exhibited better RFS than adipophilin-positive patients ( p = 0 . 080 ). Multivariate analysis showed that adipophilin expression correlated with a high rate of relapse (hazard ratio, 4.89; 95% confidence interval, 1.04–23.0; p = 0 . 044 ). Taken together, these results indicate that adipophilin is a novel marker for the poor prognosis of patients with TNBC."
https://openalex.org/W3098234762,"Background Fecal colonization by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) can be the main reservoir for transmission of these resistant organisms especially in the Intensive Care Units (ICUs). Aim This study was conducted to evaluate the rate of rectal carriage and molecular characterization of CRE in patients hospitalized in the ICUs of 2 major hospitals (Adan and Mubarak Al Kabeer Hospitals) in Kuwait. Materials and methods Rectal swabs were collected from all patients at admission, 48 h after admission and once weekly from April 2017- March 2018. Initial CRE screening was carried out on MacConkey agar on which meropenem disc 10μg was placed. Identification of isolates was by API 20E. Susceptibility testing was performed using the E-test method. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect the carbapenemase-encoding genes. Clonal relationship was investigated by pulsed-field electrophoresis (PFGE). Genes of bla OXA-181 and bla NDM-5 –carrying plasmids were detected in some strains. Results A total of 590 patients were recruited into the study. Of these, 58 were positive for CRE, giving a prevalence of 9.8%; 25/320 (7.8%) in Adan and 33/270 (12.2%) in Mubarak Al Kabeer Hospitals. All isolates were resistant to multiple antibiotics. Resistance rates to colistin and tigecycline were 17% and 83%, respectively. Single genes of bla OXA-181 were detected in isolates from 38 (65.5%) out of 58 patients and in 5 patients colonized by bla OXA-48 -positive CRE. A combination of 2 genes was detected in 12 isolates; 5 bla KPC-2 and bla OXA-181 , 4 bla VIM-1 and bla OXA-181 , and 3 bla NDM-5 and bla OXA-181 . PFGE showed an overall level of similarity of 38%. Southern hybridization studies localized the bla OXA-181 and bla NDM-5 genes to a large plasmid of 200kb in 3 K . pneumoniae isolates and a small plasmid of 80kb in 2 E . coli isolates, respectively. Conclusion The prevalence of CRE colonization in the 2 hospital ICUs was relatively high and the emergence of bla OXA-181 -mediated CRE is a cause for concern as there is the possibility of rapid horizontal spread among hospital patients in Kuwait. Active surveillance of CRE in the ICUs is highly recommended to stem its spread."

The PPARα may affects the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis by reducing inflammatory responses. Pemafibrate (K-877) is a novel selective PPARα modulator (SPPARMα), which was designed to possess higher PPARα potency and selectivity than existing PPARα agonists. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of pemafibrate on vascular response in coronary atherosclerosis model using low density lipoprotein receptor knock-out (LDLR-KO) pigs with balloon injury. Methods and results Ten LDLR-KO pigs were randomly allocated to two groups [pemafibrate (n = 5) and control (n = 5)] and fed with a diet containing 2.0% cholesterol and 20% lard throughout the study. Balloon injury was created in 40 coronary segments two weeks after starting the oral administration of pemafibrate or placebo. Necropsy was conducted 8 weeks later. Coronary artery sections were reviewed to evaluate lesion progression and the mRNA expression levels for C-Jun, NFκ B, CCL2, CCR7, CD163 and MMP9 determined using real-time RT-PCR. LDL cholesterol at baseline was about 700 mg/dL. The mean ratio of macrophages to plaque area was significantly lower in pemafibrate group compared with control one (7.63±1.16 vs 14.04±4.51, P = 0.02) whereas no differences were observed in intimal area between groups. The mRNA levels of C-Jun, NFκB and MMP9 were significantly decreased in pemafibrate group.

https://openalex.org/W3106072313,"Background The Air Quality Index (AQI) in the United States is widely used to communicate daily air quality information to the public. While use of the AQI has led to reported changes in individual behaviors, such behavior modifications will only mitigate adverse health effects if AQI values are indicative of public health risks. Few studies have assessed the capability of the AQI to accurately predict respiratory morbidity risks. Methods and findings In three major regions of California, Poisson generalized linear models were used to assess seasonal associations between 1,373,165 respiratory emergency department visits and short-term exposure to multiple metrics between 2012–2014, including: daily concentrations of NO 2 , O 3 , and PM 2.5 ; the daily reported AQI; and a newly constructed health-based air quality index. AQI values were positively associated (average risk ratio = 1.03, 95% CI 1.02–1.04) during the cooler months of the year (November-February) in all three regions when the AQI was very highly correlated with PM 2.5 (R 2 ≥ 0.89). During the warm season (March-October) in the San Joaquin Valley region, neither AQI values nor the individual underlying air pollutants were associated with respiratory morbidity. Additionally, AQI values were not positively associated with respiratory morbidity in the Southern California region during the warm season, despite strong associations of the individual underlying air pollutants with respiratory morbidity; in contrast, health-based index values were observed to be significantly associated with respiratory morbidity as part of an applied policy analysis in this region, with a combined risk ratio of 1.02 (95% CI: 1.01–1.03). Conclusions In regions where individual air pollutants are associated with respiratory morbidity, and during seasons with relatively simple air mixtures, the AQI can effectively serve as a risk communication tool for respiratory health risks. However, the predictive ability of the AQI and any other index is contingent upon the monitored values being representative of actual population exposures. Other approaches, such as health-based indices, may be needed in order to effectively communicate health risks of air pollution in regions and seasons with more complex air mixtures."
https://openalex.org/W3100194001,"Several previous studies have shown that when a cell that has taken up nanoparticles divides, the nanoparticles are inherited by the two daughter cells in an asymmetrical fashion, with one daughter cell receiving more nanoparticles than the other. This interesting observation is typically demonstrated either indirectly using mathematical modelling of high-throughput experimental data or more directly by imaging individual cells as they divide. Here we suggest that measurements of the coefficient of variation (standard deviation over mean) of the number of nanoparticles per cell over the cell population is another means of assessing the degree of asymmetry. Using simulations of an evolving cell population, we show that the coefficient of variation is sensitive to the degree of asymmetry and note its characteristic evolution in time. As the coefficient of variation is readily measurable using high-throughput techniques, this should allow a more rapid experimental assessment of the degree of asymmetry."
https://openalex.org/W3102170214,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) increases the risk of colitis-associated cancer (CAC). Evidences suggest that Helicobacter pylori ( H . pylori ) infection is associated with a low risk of IBD and protects against experimental colitis in mouse models. However, the effect of H . pylori infection in CAC remains unclear. We previously reported that H . pylori infection increased M2 macrophages in dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced chronic colitis. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play a pivotal role in colon cancer. Therefore, we established a H . pylori -infected CAC mouse model induced by azoxymethane and DSS to explore the effect of H . pylori infection on TAMs in CAC. Here, we demonstrated that H . pylori infection attenuated the development of CAC by decreasing tumor multiplicity, tumor size, tumor grade and colitis scores. Moreover, H . pylori infection reduced the infiltration of TAMs, particularly M2-like TAMs in CAC tumors, accompanied with the down-regulated pro-inflammatory and pro-tumorigenic factors TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-23 in tumors of CAC mice. Our study suggests that H . pylori infection can reduce TAMs infiltration and regulate cytokines expression in CAC."
https://openalex.org/W3103802011,"Pulmonary diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), are major chronic diseases that result in decreased pulmonary function. Relationships between body composition and pulmonary function have been reported. However, few epidemiological studies have used the visceral fat area (VFA) to measure body composition. This study aimed to examine the relationship between body composition and pulmonary function. A cross-sectional study was conducted between 2015 and 2016, using data obtained from 1,287 residents aged between 19 and 91 years living in the Iwaki area of Hirosaki City, a rural region in Aomori Prefecture, Japan. Pulmonary function was evaluated using the forced vital capacity (FVC) as a percentage of the predicted value (predicted FVC%) and the ratio of forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ) to FVC. The measurements for evaluating body composition included the body fat percentage (BFP) of the whole body and trunk, skeletal muscle index (SMI), body mass index (BMI), VFA, waist circumference (WC) at the navel level, and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR). To adjust for potential confounders, Spearman’s partial correlation analysis was used to examine the relationship between the measurements of body composition and pulmonary function. There were significant correlations between the predicted FVC% and the following parameters: BFP (whole body and trunk) in younger males; SMI in older males; WC, VFA, BMI, and SMI in younger females; and BFP (whole body and trunk) and VFA in older females. Contrastingly, WC and VFA in younger males and WC in younger females were correlated with the FEV 1 /FVC ratio. VFA was correlated with the FEV 1 /FVC ratio in younger males and predicted FVC% in older females. These findings suggest that visceral fat accumulation may increase the development of obstructive pulmonary disease in young males and accelerate the decline of pulmonary function (predicted FVC%) in older females."
https://openalex.org/W3105949653,"This study investigated quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG) subtypes as auxiliary tools to assess Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). A total of 74 subjects (58 male and 16 female) were assessed using the Korean version of the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children Version IV and were assigned to one of three groups: ADHD, ADHD-Not Otherwise specified (NOS), and Neurotypical (NT). We measured absolute and relative EEG power in 19 channels and conducted an auditory continuous performance test. We analyzed QEEG according to the frequency range: delta (1–4 Hz), theta (4–8 Hz), slow alpha (8–10 Hz), fast alpha (10–13.5 Hz), and beta (13.5–30 Hz). The subjects were then grouped by Ward’s method of cluster analysis using the squared Euclidian distance to measure dissimilarities. We discovered four QEEG clusters, which were characterized by: (a) elevated delta power with less theta activity, (b) elevated slow alpha relative power, (c) elevated theta with deficiencies of alpha and beta relative power, and (d) elevated fast alpha and beta absolute power. The largest proportion of participants in clusters (a) and (c) were from the ADHD group (48% and 47%, respectively). Conversely, group (b) mostly consisted of the participants from the NOS group (59%), while group (d) had the largest proportion of participants from the NT group (62%). These results indicate that children with ADHD does not neurophysiologically constitute a homogenous group. We also identified a new subtype with increased alpha power in addition to those commonly reported in ADHD. Given the QEEG characteristics with increased alpha power, we should consider the possibility that this subtype may be caused by childhood depression. In conclusion, we believe that these QEEG subtypes of ADHD are expected to provide valuable information for accurately diagnosing ADHD."
https://openalex.org/W3100656613,"Esophageal atresia (EA) and tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) are relatively frequently occurring foregut malformations. EA/TEF is thought to have a strong genetic component. Not much is known regarding the biological processes disturbed or which cell type is affected in patients. This hampers the detection of the responsible culprits (genetic or environmental) for the origin of these congenital anatomical malformations. Therefore, we examined gene expression patterns in the TEF and compared them to the patterns in esophageal, tracheal and lung control samples. We studied tissue organization and key proteins using immunohistochemistry. There were clear differences between TEF and control samples. Based on the number of differentially expressed genes as well as histological characteristics, TEFs were most similar to normal esophagus. The BMP-signaling pathway, actin cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix pathways are downregulated in TEF. Genes involved in smooth muscle contraction are overexpressed in TEF compared to esophagus as well as trachea. These enriched pathways indicate myofibroblast activated fibrosis. TEF represents a specific tissue type with large contributions of intestinal smooth muscle cells and neurons. All major cell types present in esophagus are present—albeit often structurally disorganized—in TEF, indicating that its etiology should not be sought in cell fate specification."
https://openalex.org/W3104238857,"The use of mobile communication devices in health care is spreading worldwide. A huge amount of health data collected by these devices (mobile health data) is nowadays available. Mobile health data may allow for real-time monitoring of patients and delivering ad-hoc treatment recommendations. This paper aims at showing how this may be done by exploiting the potentialities of fuzzy clustering techniques. In fact, such techniques can be fruitfully applied to mobile health data in order to identify clusters of patients for diagnostic classification and cluster-specific therapies. However, since mobile health data are full of noise, fuzzy clustering methods cannot be directly applied to mobile health data. Such data must be denoised prior to analyzing them. When longitudinal mobile health data are available, functional data analysis represents a powerful tool for filtering out the noise in the data. Fuzzy clustering methods for functional data can then be used to determine groups of patients. In this work we develop a fuzzy clustering method, based on the concept of medoid, for functional data and we apply it to longitudinal mHealth data on daily symptoms and consumptions of anti-symptomatic drugs collected by two sets of patients in Berlin (Germany) and Ascoli Piceno (Italy) suffering from allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. The studies showed that clusters of patients with similar changes in symptoms were identified opening the possibility of precision medicine."
https://openalex.org/W3106151693,"In alcoholic liver cirrhosis (LC) patients, obesity has become a problem that progresses into liver dysfunction. Herein, we investigated the relationship between the prognosis of steatohepatitis and body weight, along with fat accumulation in patients with alcoholic LC. We conducted a single-center retrospective study, enrolled 104 alcoholic LC patients without hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) based on histological and clinical evidence, and investigated factors related to poor prognosis using multivariate Cox regression and cluster analyses. Cox regression analysis revealed three independent relevant factors: subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) index (median 34.8 cm 2 /m 2 , P = 0.009, hazard ratio [HR] 1.017, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.004–1.030), total bilirubin level (median 1.7 mg/dL, P = 0.003, HR 1.129, 95% CI 1.042–1.223), and prothrombin time value (median 64%, P = 0.007, HR 0.967, 95% CI 0.943–0.991). In the cluster analysis, we categorized the patients into three groups: no adipose tissue accumulation (NAT group), SAT prior accumulation (SAT group), and visceral adipose tissue prior accumulation (VAT group). The results of the three groups revealed that the SAT group displayed a significantly poor prognosis of the Kaplan–Meier curve (67.1 vs 21.2 vs 65.3, P&lt;0.001) of a 5-year survival rate. Propensity score matching analysis of the SAT and VAT groups was performed to adjust the patient’s background, but no significant differences were found between them; however, the prognosis was poorer (21.2 vs 66.3, P&lt;0.001), and hemostatic factors were still at a lower level in the SAT group. These findings suggest that SAT accumulation type of obesity is a poor prognostic factor in alcoholic LC patients without HCC, and the hemorrhagic tendency might worsen the poor prognosis in such cases."
https://openalex.org/W3098826649,"X-linked choroideremia (CHM) is a disease characterized by gradual retinal degeneration caused by loss of the Rab Escort Protein, REP1. Despite partial compensation by REP2 the disease is characterized by prenylation defects in multiple members of the Rab protein family that are master regulators of membrane traffic. Remarkably, the eye is the only organ affected in CHM patients, possibly because of the huge membrane traffic burden of the post mitotic photoreceptors, which synthesise outer segments, and the adjacent retinal pigment epithelium that degrades the spent portions each day. In this study, we aimed to identify defects in membrane traffic that might lead to photoreceptor cell death in CHM. In a heterozygous null female mouse model of CHM ( Chm null/WT ), degeneration of the photoreceptor layer was clearly evident from increased numbers of TUNEL positive cells compared to age matched controls, small numbers of cells exhibiting signs of mitochondrial stress and greatly increased microglial infiltration. However, most rod photoreceptors exhibited remarkably normal morphology with well-formed outer segments and no discernible accumulation of transport vesicles in the inner segment. The major evidence of membrane trafficking defects was a shortening of rod outer segments that was evident at 2 months of age but remained constant over the period during which the cells die. A decrease in rhodopsin density found in the outer segment may underlie the outer segment shortening but does not lead to rhodopsin accumulation in the inner segment. Our data argue against defects in rhodopsin transport or outer segment renewal as triggers of cell death in CHM."

This study explored communities' perception of the etiology of illnesses in SYIs 0–59 days old in four counties in Kenya. Methods We used an exploratory qualitative study design. Data were collected between August and September 2018 and involved 23 in-depth interviews with female caregivers aged 15-24years; 25 focus group discussions with female caregivers aged 15–18 years, 19–24 years and 25–45 years; and 7 focus group discussions with fathers aged 18–34 years and 35 or more years. Participants were purposely sampled, only those with SYIs 0–59 days old were eligible to participate. Data were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis framework approach. Results Female caregivers and fathers attributed illnesses in SYIs 0–59 days old to natural (biomedical) and supernatural causes which sometimes co-existed. There were commonalities in perceived natural causes of illness in SYIs across sites, age groups and gender. Perceived natural causes of illness in SYIs include unfavorable environmental and hygiene conditions, poor maternal and child nutrition, and healthcare practices. Perceived supernatural causes of illness in SYIs such as ‘evil eyes’ were common across the four counties while others were geographically unique such as the belief that owls cause illnesses. Conclusion Communities’ understanding of the etiology of illnesses in SYIs in the study settings overlapped between natural and supernatural causes. There is need for child health programmes to take into consideration communities’ beliefs and practices regarding disease and health to improve newborn health outcomes."

https://openalex.org/W3105279613,"Throughout the humid tropics, increased land disturbance and concomitant road construction increases erosion and sediment delivery to rivers. Building road networks in developing countries is commonly a priority for international development funding based on anticipated socio-economic benefits. Yet the resulting erosion from roads, which recent studies have shown result in at least ten-fold increases in erosion rates, is not fully accounted for. While effects of road-derived sediment on aquatic ecosystems have been documented in temperate climates, little has been published on the effects of road-induced sediment on aquatic ecosystems in developing countries of the tropics. We studied periphyton biomass and macroinvertebrate communities on the deltas of Río San Juan tributaries, comparing north-bank tributaries draining undisturbed rain forest with south-bank tributaries receiving runoff from a partially-built road experiencing rapid erosion. Periphyton biomass, richness and abundance of macroinvertebrates overall, and richness and abundance of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera were higher on the north-bank tributary deltas than the south-bank tributary deltas. These findings were consistent with prior studies in temperate climates showing detrimental effects of road-derived fine sediment on aquatic organisms. A Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) analysis showed the impacted community on the south-bank deltas was influenced by poorly-sorted substrate with greater proportions of fine sediment and higher water temperatures."
https://openalex.org/W3106447003,"Despite increasing threats to Tonga’s coral reefs from stressors that are both local (e.g. overfishing and pollution) and global (e.g. climate change), there is yet to be a systematic assessment of the status of the country’s coral reef ecosystem and reef fish fishery stocks. Here, we provide a national ecological assessment of Tonga’s coral reefs and reef fish fishery using ecological survey data from 375 sites throughout Tonga’s three main island groups (Ha’apai, Tongatapu and Vava’u), represented by seven key metrics of reef health and fish resource status. Boosted regression tree analysis was used to assess and describe the relative importance of 11 socio-environmental variables associated with these key metrics of reef condition. Mean live coral cover across Tonga was 18%, and showed a strong increase from north to south correlated with declining sea surface temperature, as well as with increasing distance from each provincial capital. Tongatapu, the southernmost island group, had 2.5 times greater coral cover than the northernmost group, Vava’u (24.9% and 10.4% respectively). Reef fish species richness and density were comparable throughout Tongatapu and the middle island group, Ha’apai (~35 species/transect and ~2500 fish/km 2 ), but were significantly lower in Vava’u (~24 species/transect and ~1700 fish/km 2 ). Spatial patterns in the reef fish assemblage were primarily influenced by habitat-associated variables (slope, structural complexity, and hard coral cover). The biomass of target reef fish was greatest in Ha’apai (~820 kg/ha) and lowest in Vava’u (~340 kg/ha), and was negatively associated with higher human influence and fishing activity. Overall mean reef fish biomass values suggest that Tonga’s reef fish fishery can be classified as moderately to heavily exploited, with 64% of sites having less than 500 kg/ha. This study provides critical baseline ecological information for Tonga’s coral reefs that will: (1) facilitate ongoing management and research; and (2) enable accurate reporting on conservation targets locally and internationally."
https://openalex.org/W3098730017,"Pork is one of the most globally eaten meats and the pig production chain contributes significantly to the water footprint of livestock production. However, very little knowledge is available about the on-farm factors that influence freshwater use in the pig production chain. An experiment was conducted to quantify the effect of three different washing treatments on freshwater use, bacterial levels [(total bacterial counts; TBC), Enterobacteriaceae and Staphylococcus ] and cleaning time in washing of pens for weaning pigs. Three weaner rooms were selected with each room having 10 pens and a capacity to hold up to 14 pigs each. Pigs were weaned and kept in the pens for 7 weeks. Finally, the pens were cleaned before the next batch of pigs moved in. The washing treatments used were power washing and disinfection (WASH); presoaking followed by power washing and disinfection (SOAK), and presoaking followed by detergent, power washing and disinfection (SOAK + DETER). A water meter was used to collect water use data and swab samples were taken to determine the bacterial levels. The results showed that there was no overall effect of washing treatments on water use. However, there was an effect of treatment on the washing time ( p &lt;0.01) with SOAK and SOAK+DETER reducing the washing time per pen by 2.3 minutes (14%) and 4.2 minutes (27%) compared to WASH. Nonetheless, there was an effect of sampling time (before or after washing) ( p &lt;0.001) on the levels of TBC and Staphylococcus , but no effect was seen on Enterobacteriaceae levels. Thus, the washing treatments used in this study had no effect on the water use of the pork production chain. Although there was no difference in both water use and bacterial load, from a producer perspective, presoaking and detergent use can save time and labour costs, so this would be the preferred option."
https://openalex.org/W3102358890,"Purpose Despite extensive research and newer methods of interventions, the incidence and prevalence of diabetes is increasing at an alarming rate. Currently, according to world health organization (WHO) statistics, 422 million individuals are suffering from diabetes worldwide. In India, recent estimates have reported a significant increase in the number of diabetics in the last decade. Poor dietary habits, minimal adherence to treatment regimens, lack of timely education are some of the contributing factors for increasing incidence and huge economic burden; which can be handled by life style behavior modifications backed up by hand holding through continuous education. Prior studies have demonstrated the efficacy of various self-management tools and educational programs in better disease management behaviors among individuals with diabetes. Among various self-management tools, educating the individuals and alerting them using mobile phone calls and short messaging system (SMS) are widely accepted due to (a) the increasing mobile phone users and (b) availability of short messaging systems in local languages in the recent years. Therefore, a pilot study was conducted to determine the benefit of educating patients through phone calls and SMS in the self-management of diabetes. Objectives The objective of the study is to determine the feasibility and utility of SMS and phone call-based interventions in the management of diabetes by comparing the HbA1c values. Methodology The study was conducted for a period of 14 months from December 2017 till Feb 2019. Out of 380 individuals initially enrolled into the study, 120 had completed the 14-months period. Diabetes education through SMS and phone calls was provided on regular basis, and HbA1C levels at baseline, 8-months and 14-months quantified. In addition, feedback on patients’ satisfaction and utility of the SMS / Phone calls was collected using questionnaires. Results Data from our study demonstrated that after 8-months of intervention through phone calls, a significant increase in the number of individuals with HbA1c in the range of 5.1 to 7.0 was observed (from 27 individuals at base line to 37 individuals after 8-months intervention). Much more significant improvement in the number of individuals with lower HbA1c was observed at 14-months of intervention, indicating the benefit of regular phone call-based system in managing diabetes. A Chi square (χ 2 ) test was performed to examine if the frequencies in the cells varied at baseline and at 8 and 14 months. Conclusion Chronic diseases like diabetes needs awareness and education to patients in adopting disease self-management practices. As mobile phone users are increasing in number, providing diabetes management education through mobile phone intervention could be a viable strategy for controlling diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W3105036544,"Background Malaria remains a major global health problem with a need for improved field-usable diagnostic tests. We have developed a portable, low-cost digital microscope scanner, capable of both brightfield and fluorescence imaging. Here, we used the instrument to digitize blood smears, and applied deep learning (DL) algorithms to detect Plasmodium falciparum parasites. Methods Thin blood smears ( n = 125) were collected from patients with microscopy-confirmed P . falciparum infections in rural Tanzania, prior to and after initiation of artemisinin-based combination therapy. The samples were stained using the 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole fluorogen and digitized using the prototype microscope scanner. Two DL algorithms were trained to detect malaria parasites in the samples, and results compared to the visual assessment of both the digitized samples, and the Giemsa-stained thick smears. Results Detection of P . falciparum parasites in the digitized thin blood smears was possible both by visual assessment and by DL-based analysis with a strong correlation in results (r = 0.99, p &lt; 0.01). A moderately strong correlation was observed between the DL-based thin smear analysis and the visual thick smear-analysis (r = 0.74, p &lt; 0.01). Low levels of parasites were detected by DL-based analysis on day three following treatment initiation, but a small number of fluorescent signals were detected also in microscopy-negative samples. Conclusion Quantification of P . falciparum parasites in DAPI-stained thin smears is feasible using DL-supported, point-of-care digital microscopy, with a high correlation to visual assessment of samples. Fluorescent signals from artefacts in samples with low infection levels represented the main challenge for the digital analysis, thus highlighting the importance of minimizing sample contaminations. The proposed method could support malaria diagnostics and monitoring of treatment response through automated quantification of parasitaemia and is likely to be applicable also for diagnostics of other Plasmodium species and other infectious diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3102871226,"In psycholinguistics and clinical linguistics, the Sentence Repetition Task (SRT) is known to be a valuable tool to screen general language abilities in both spoken and signed languages. This task enables users to reliably and quickly assess linguistic abilities at different levels of linguistic analysis such as phonology, morphology, lexicon, and syntax. To evaluate sign language proficiency in deaf children using French Sign Language (LSF), we designed a new SRT comprising 20 LSF sentences. The task was administered to a cohort of 62 children– 34 native signers (6;09–12 years) and 28 non-native signers (6;08–12;08 years)–in order to study their general linguistic development as a function of age of sign language acquisition (AOA) and chronological age (CA). Previously, a group of 10 adult native signers was also evaluated with this task. As expected, our results showed a significant effect of AOA, indicating that the native signers repeated more signs and were more accurate than non-native signers. A similar pattern of results was found for CA. Furthermore, native signers made fewer phonological errors (i.e., handshape, movement, and location) than non-native signers. Finally, as shown in previous sign language studies, handshape and movement proved to be the most difficult parameters to master regardless of AOA and CA. Taken together, our findings support the assumption that AOA is a crucial factor in the development of phonological skills regardless of language modality (spoken vs. signed). This study thus constitutes a first step toward a theoretical description of the developmental trajectory in LSF, a hitherto understudied language."
https://openalex.org/W3103786279,"Enterococcus mundtii QU25, a non-dairy lactic acid bacterium of the phylum Firmicutes, is capable of simultaneously fermenting cellobiose and xylose, and is described as a promising strain for the industrial production of optically pure l -lactic acid (≥ 99.9%) via homo-fermentation of lignocellulosic hydrolysates. Generally, Firmicutes bacteria show preferential consumption of sugar (usually glucose), termed carbon catabolite repression (CCR), while hampering the catabolism of other sugars. In our previous study, QU25 exhibited apparent CCR in a glucose-xylose mixture phenotypically, and transcriptional repression of the xylose operon encoding initial xylose metabolism genes, likely occurred in a CcpA-dependent manner. QU25 did not exhibit CCR phenotypically in a cellobiose-xylose mixture. The aim of the current study is to elucidate the transcriptional change associated with the simultaneous utilization of cellobiose and xylose. To this end, we performed RNA-seq analysis in the exponential growth phase of E . mundtii QU25 cells grown in glucose, cellobiose, and/or xylose as either sole or co-carbon sources. Our transcriptomic data showed that the xylose operon was weakly repressed in cells grown in a cellobiose-xylose mixture compared with that in cells grown in a glucose-xylose mixture. Furthermore, the gene expression of talC , the sole gene encoding transaldolase, is expected to be repressed by CcpA-mediated CCR. QU25 metabolized xylose without using transaldolase, which is necessary for homolactic fermentation from pentoses using the pentose-phosphate pathway. Hence, the metabolism of xylose in the presence of cellobiose by QU25 may have been due to 1) sufficient amounts of proteins encoded by the xylose operon genes for xylose metabolism despite of the slight repression of the operon, and 2) bypassing of the pentose-phosphate pathway without the TalC activity. Accordingly, we have determined the targets of genetic modification in QU25 to metabolize cellobiose, xylose and glucose simultaneously for application of the lactic fermentation from lignocellulosic hydrolysates."
https://openalex.org/W3104393316,"Thyroid hormone (T3) inhibits thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) synthesis in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN). Although the T3 receptor (TR) β2 is known to mediate the negative regulation of the prepro-TRH gene, its molecular mechanism remains unknown. Our previous studies on the T3-dependent negative regulation of the thyrotropin β subunit (TSHβ) gene suggest that there is a tethering mechanism, whereby liganded TRβ2 interferes with the function of the transcription factor, GATA2, a critical activator of the TSHβ gene. Interestingly, the transcription factors Sim1 and Arnt2, the determinants of PVN differentiation in the hypothalamus, are reported to induce expression of TRβ2 and GATA2 in cultured neuronal cells. Here, we confirmed the expression of the GATA2 protein in the TRH neuron of the rat PVN using immunohistochemistry with an anti-GATA2 antibody. According to an experimental study from transgenic mice, a region of the rat prepro-TRH promoter from nt. -547 to nt. +84 was able to mediate its expression in the PVN. We constructed a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene containing this promoter sequence (rTRH(547)-CAT) and showed that GATA2 activated the promoter in monkey kidney-derived CV1 cells. Deletion and mutation analyses identified a functional GATA-responsive element (GATA-RE) between nt. -357 and nt. -352. When TRβ2 was co-expressed, T3 reduced GATA2-dependent promoter activity to approximately 30%. Unexpectedly, T3-dependent negative regulation was maintained after mutation of the reported negative T3-responsive element, site 4. T3 also inhibited the GATA2-dependent transcription enhanced by cAMP agonist, 8-bromo-cAMP. A rat thyroid medullary carcinoma cell line, CA77, is known to express the preproTRH mRNA. Using a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay with this cell line where GATA2 expression plasmid was transfected, we observed the recognition of the GATA-RE by GATA2. We also confirmed GATA2 binding using gel shift assay with the probe for the GATA-RE. In CA77 cells, the activity of rTRH(547)-CAT was potentiated by overexpression of GATA2, and it was inhibited in a T3-dependent manner. These results suggest that GATA2 transactivates the rat prepro-TRH gene and that liganded TRβ2 interferes with this activation via a tethering mechanism as in the case of the TSHβ gene."
https://openalex.org/W3102417413,"Background The quantitative measurement of current perception threshold (CPT) has been used as a method to assess the function of nerve fibers in neuropathy diseases. The aim of this study was to assess the test-retest reliability measuring CPT using the circular pin electrodes for assessing the function of cutaneous thin nerve fibers. Methods CPT measurement was repeated on two separate days with at least one-week interval in 55 volunteers. Superficial blood flow (SBF) and skin temperature (ST) were measured on the skin in an around area concentric to the circular pin electrodes after the process of finding CPTs. The coefficient of variation (CV) and intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) were calculated. The correlation between each two of CPT, SBF increment and ST increment was analyzed. Results No significant differences were found for CPT, SBF and ST between two sessions. SBF was found to be significantly increased after the process of finding CPT. CPT values of males were found to be higher than females. SBF increment was found to be positively correlated with ST increment. The ICC values for CPT, SBF and ST were 0.595, 0.852 and 0.728, respectively. The CV values for CPT, SBF and ST were 25.53%, 12.59% and 1.94%, respectively. Conclusions The reliability of CPT measurement using circular pin electrodes is fair, and need consistence of measurements in longitudinal studies."

Hence the purpose of the study was to assess the level of fidelity achieved by school oral health programs in our study district and to determine elements of fidelity that predict the risk of dental decay. Methods A cross-sectional study design was utilised. A multistage sampling technique was employed to randomly select 10 schools, two grades in each school were selected and all pupils in the selected grades were included in an oral health examination. Ten oral hygienists were observed and interviewed as they carried out the activities of the program and records were reviewed. Data collection tools included an oral health examination form, and an implementation fidelity checklist. Results The average level of fidelity obtained was 40% and it was shown to be inversely correlated with levels of decay, as decay was predicted to decrease with increasing levels of fidelity. The fidelity elements that were found to directly predict the outcome of decay included duration (IRR, 0.49; p = 0.02) coverage (IRR, 0.54; p = 008), content (IRR, 1.36; p = 0.03) and age (IRR, 2.14; p = 0.00). Moderating factors of fidelity which indirectly influenced the outcome of decay included facilitation strategy, duration and age. These were predicted to reduce the risk of decay by 92%, 83% and 48% respectively. Conclusion The school oral health programs exhibited high levels of pupil coverage, however, the content of the programs offered was low (28%). Coverage was high in the context of lack of dental assistance and time. Multi-sectoral participation is therefore necessary to re-organise the program for improving implementation fidelity and bringing about quality implementation."
https://openalex.org/W3098527658,"Respirable dust in conserved forages can pose problems with equid respiratory health, thus soaking (W) and high temperature steaming (HTS) are employed to reduce the levels in hay. The aim of this study was to characterize the viable bacterial community profile of four hays from two different locations in UK following pre-feeding wetting regimens. Hypothesis: (1) Viable microbial community profile of hays will not differ between different pre-feeding regimens. (2) Hay type and location will not influence microbial community profile. Replicates of each of the four hays were subjected to dry (D), HTS conducted in a HG600, W by submergence in 45 L tap water, 16°C for 12 hours. From each post-treated hay, 100 g samples were chopped and half (n = 36) treated with Propidium monoazide dye, the remaining half untreated. Bacterial DNA were extracted for profiling the V4-V5 region of 16S rRNA gene from all 72 samples, then sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform. Bioinformatics were conducted using QIIME pipeline (v1.9.1). Linear discriminate analysis effect size (LEfSe) was used to identify differences in operational taxonomic units and predicted metabolic pathways between hays and regimens. HTS reduced proportions of microbiota compared to W and D hay (P &lt; 0.001, df 3, F 13.91), viability was reduced within regimens (P = 0.017, df 1, F 5.73). Soaking reduced diversity within and between regimens. Core bacterial communities differed between hays and regimens, however pre-feeding regimen had the greatest effect on the bacterial community profile. W and HTS reduced viable bacteria (P&lt; 0.05) known to cause respiratory disease, for HTS both respiratory and dental disease, with the greatest reductions overall from HTS without reducing bacterial diversity. Soaking increased Gram-negative bacteria and reduced bacterial diversity. Collectively these findings add to a body of evidence that suggest HTS is the most suitable pre-feeding regimen of hay for equid health."
https://openalex.org/W3098690344,"Objective Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication of complex aortic surgery with high mortality, morbidity and health care expense. The current definition of AKI does not allow for structural characterization of the kidneys and utilizes functional indices with substantial limitations leading to delayed diagnosis and ineffective interventions. The aim of this study is to develop a method of early detection of structural renal abnormalities that can precede and predict the occurrence of AKI in this population. We propose a novel combined index of ultrasonography (shear wave elastography), biomarkers of renal stress (urinary insulin growth factor binding protein-7, IGFBP-7 and inhibitor of tissue metalloproteinase-2, TIMP-2) and renal injury markers (urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin -NGAL)- the bio-sonographic index (BSI). Methods A prospective observational study at a tertiary referral center will be performed enrolling 80 patients undergoing elective open and endovascular repair of the visceral aorta. The BSI will be evaluated at baseline, and at 6 and 24 hours after the procedure. The primary outcome is the occurrence of AKI according to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria. Each patient will be his/her own control. A reference group of 15 healthy volunteers who are not undergoing interventions will be enrolled to test the feasibility of and to refine the novel SWE protocol. The BSI will be tested for its predictability of the occurrence of AKI. Comparisons will be made between individual and combined components of the BSI and traditional markers used in the KDIGO definition; serum creatinine and urine output in terms of baseline status of the kidney. Correlations will be made between the BSI and conventional indices of AKI and exploratory analyses will be conducted to identify individual disease patterns using the BSI. Discussion We hypothesize that the BSI will be a sensitive index of early structural abnormalities that precede and predict the occurrence of AKI as defined by KDIGO in complex vascular surgery.

https://openalex.org/W3101291751,"This study evaluated changes in intraocular pressure (IOP) with face-down positioning (FDP) following surgical treatment of idiopathic macular hole. We retrospectively reviewed the records of 130 patients diagnosed with idiopathic macular hole who underwent pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) with intravitreal gas injection after fluid-gas exchange. We analyzed IOP changes in both eyes following FDP over the course of 7 days. The mean IOP of the operated eyes was 14.98±2.95 mmHg preoperatively and 16.82±3.12 and 15.57±6.10 mmHg on postoperative days 2 and 7, respectively. In contralateral eyes, the mean IOP changed from 14.78±3.15 mmHg preoperatively to 16.27±1.87 and 14.40±4.14 mmHg on postoperative days 2 and 7, respectively. On postoperative day 2, the IOP increased in both eyes compared to the preoperative values, but the increase was significant only in operated eyes ( p = 0.039). In contralateral eyes, the IOP on postoperative day 7 was significantly decreased compared with that on postoperative day 2 ( p = 0.021) and in eyes with an axial length ≥ 23.0 mm, compared with the preoperative values ( p = 0.042). The IOP of the operated eyes on postoperative day 7 was higher than that of the contralateral eyes ( p = 0.039). Based on a short-term follow-up, FDP after PPV with intravitreal gas tamponade for the treatment of idiopathic macular hole may cause IOP elevation not only in the operated, but also in the contralateral eyes; the IOP increase in contralateral eyes was not as significant as that in operated eyes and was not maintained over 7 days after surgery; the IOP change seems to be affected by axial length and lens status."
https://openalex.org/W3103618402,"We formulate a sex-structured deterministic model to study the effects of varying HIV testing rates, condom use rates and ART adherence rates among Adolescent Girls and Young Women (AGYW) and, Adolescent Boys and Young Men (ABYM) populations in Kenya. Attitudes influencing the Kenyan youth HIV/AIDS control measures both positively and negatively were considered. Using the 2012 Kenya AIDS Indicator Survey (KAIS) microdata we constructed our model, which we fitted to the UNAIDS-Kenya youth prevalence estimates to understand factors influencing Kenyan youth HIV/AIDS prevalence trends. While highly efficacious combination control approach significantly reduces HIV/AIDS prevalence rates among the youth, the disease remains endemic provided infected unaware sexual interactions persist. Disproportional gender-wise attitudes towards HIV/AIDS control measures play a key role in reducing the Kenyan youth HIV/AIDS prevalence trends. The female youth HIV/AIDS prevalence trend seems to be directly linked to increased male infectivity with decreased female infectivity while the male youth prevalence trend seems to be directly associated with increased female infectivity and reduced male infectivity."
https://openalex.org/W3099601144,"Angiopoietin (Angpt)-2, a permeability-increasing growth factor, is involved in vascular leakage of sepsis and acute lung injury, and could be released from endothelium in response to anaphylaxis-related secretagogues such as histamine and leukotrienes, or cytokines. However, roles of Angpt-2 in the hyperpermeability during systemic anaphylaxis are not known. Thus, we determined plasma levels of Angpt-2 and cytokines and vascular permeability during anaphylactic hypotension in unanesthetized rats. Anaphylaxis was induced by an intravenous injection of ovalbumin antigen. Mean arterial blood pressure (MBP) was measured, and hematocrit (Hct) and plasma levels of Angpt-2 and cytokines were assessed for 24 h after antigen injection. Separately, vascular permeability was measured in various organs using the Evans blue dye method, and Angpt-2 mRNA expression in liver was measured. After antigen injection, MBP decreased to the nadir at 6 min, and returned to baseline at 45 min, and Hct peaked at 20 min and thereafter progressively declined, suggesting that vascular leak and hypotension occurred within 20 min. Plasma Angpt-2 levels began to increase significantly at 1 h after antigen, reaching the peak 2.7-fold baseline at 6 h with a return to baseline at 24 h. Detected cytokines of IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α peaked 1 or 2 h after antigen. Angpt-2 mRNA increased at 2 h and showed an increasing tendency at 6 h. Vascular permeability in bronchus, trachea, intestines, mesentery and skeletal muscle was increased at 10 min but not at 6 h after antigen. In addition, we confirmed using anesthetized rat anaphylaxis models that plasma Angpt-2 levels increased at 1 h after antigen. In conclusion, plasma Angpt-2 is elevated presumably due to increased cytokines and enhanced gene transcription during anaphylaxis in anesthetized and unanesthetized rats."
https://openalex.org/W3103707856,"Diabetes mellitus is a serious disease with increasing global prevalence. Point-of-care analysis of glycated hemoglobin A (HbA 1c ) holds promise as a diagnostic test for diabetes mellitus in epidemiological studies in challenging environments with limited access to centralized biochemical labs. The HemoCue HbA1c 501 device can be used for point-of-care determination of HbA 1c , but its usability in epidemiological studies is limited by its inability to export results in digital format. We have developed the open source HemoDownloader software to overcome this limitation of the device. HemoDownloader has an easy-to-use graphical user interface and can export data from HemoCue HbA1c 501 to standard spreadsheet file formats. The program has the potential to improve data collection and management in epidemiological studies of diabetes mellitus."
https://openalex.org/W3104207426,"Laboratory tests of adolescents are often interpreted by using reference intervals derived from adults, even though these populations differ in their physical and physiologic characteristics and disease susceptibility. Therefore, to examine the distribution of laboratory values specific for adolescents, we analyzed hematologic and biochemical measurements obtained from 12,023 healthy Japanese adolescents (ages 15 through 18 years; male, 9165; female, 2858) during 2009 through 2018. Distributions were shown as medians with 95% (2.5th and 97.5th percentiles) of values and were compared with those from previous studies that examined similar Asian populations. There were some differences between hematologic parameters, serum creatinine and uric acid concentration, and lipid levels of Japanese adults and adolescents. In comparison with other Asian populations, the distributions of serum uric acid and high-density–lipoprotein cholesterol in the present study were slightly higher than those in the other studies. Although further research is need, the distributions of hematologic and biochemical tests in adolescents may have the potential to facilitate the early identification and management of disease in this population."
https://openalex.org/W3104543612,"Purpose To evaluate the appearance and size of ablation zones in gadoxetic-acid-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) during the first year after irreversible electroporation (IRE) of primary or secondary hepatic malignancies and to investigate potential correlations to clinical features. Material and methods The MRI-appearance of the ablation area was assessed 1–3 days, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 1 year after IRE. The size of the ablation zone and signal intensities of each follow-up control were compared. Moreover, relationships between clinical features and the MRI-appearance of the ablation area 1–3 days after IRE were analyzed. Results The ablation zone size decreased from 5.6 ± 1.4 cm (1–3 days) to 3.7±1.2 cm (1 year). A significant decrease of central hypointensities was observed in T2-blade- (3 months), T2 haste- (6 weeks; 3 months; 6 months; 1 year), T1 arterial phase- (3 months; 1 year), and diffusion-sequences (6 weeks; 3 months; 6 months; 9 months; 1 year). The unenhanced T1-sequences showed significantly increasing central hypointensities (6 weeks; 3 months; 6 months; 9 months; 1 year). Significantly increasing peripheral hypointensities were detected in T1 arterial phase- (3 months; 6 months; 9 months; 1 year) and in T1 portal venous phase-sequences (6 weeks; 3 months; 6 months; 9 months; 1 year). Peripheral hypointensities of unenhanced T1-sequences decreased significantly 1 year after IRE. 1–3 days after IRE central T1 portal venous hypo- or isointensities were detected significantly more often than hyperintensities, if more than 3 IRE electrodes were used. Conclusion Hepatic IRE results in continuous reduction of ablation zone size during the first postinterventional year. In addition to centrally decreasing T1-signal and almost steadily increasing signal in the enhanced T2 haste-, diffusion- and T1 arterial phase-sequences, there is a trend toward long-term decreasing T1 arterial- and portal venous MRI-signal intensity of the peripheral ablation area, probably representing a region of reversible electroporation."
