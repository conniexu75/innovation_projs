https://openalex.org/W2014366254,"There are approximately 10 million kinds of olganisms in the world, of which we have described some 15 percent. The rapid growth of the human population will cause most of the remainder to disappear from the earth before they are seen by a taxonomist. These facts suggest a more rigorous application of priorities in systematic biology as well as a careful review of the principles upon which our taxonomic system is based. Folk taxonomies all over the world are shallow hierarchically and comprise a strictly limited number of generic taxa ranging from about 250 to 800 forms applied to plants and a similar number applied to animals. These numbers are consistent, regardless of the richness of the environment in which the particular people live. Very few specific and varietal taxa are recognized in folk taxonomic systems. Until the invention of movable type in the mid-l5th century, written taxonomies were simply records of the folk taxonomies of particular regions. Subsequently, with the possibility for the wide distribution of books, it began to seem worth while to attempt to describe and name all species of plants and animals in the world. By the year 1700, 698 genera of plants were recognized; and by the year 1778, some 1350 genera, including tens of thousands of species. In 1789 de Jussieu interpolated the family as a higher level taxonomic category in an attempt to reduce the number of important units in the system to a memorable number. The family is still the focal point in systems of angiosperm classification at present, several hundred families being recognized. Problems with the taxonomic system stem largely from the fact that it is not designed as an information retrieval device. In folk taxonomies, names are given to organisms and these are used to communicate about the organisms with others who already know the culturally significant properties of the organisms being discussed. In dealing with the vast numbers of organisms that exist, we tend to overemphasize the process of classification and the decisions it involves at the expense of the information about the organisms that we are supposedly accumulating. Frequent changes in names exacerbate the difficulties of the system and render it still less useful for information retrieval. With modern electronic data processing equipment, it has become possible to record information about organisms, to retain this information in a data bank, and to utilize it for various purposes, including the construction of various taxonomic systems. The invention of high-speed electronic data processing equipment is seen as analogous to but more important than the invention of movable type in the history of systematic biology. By using such equipment to its full potentialities, we should be able to achieve a qualitative improvement in our perception of the living world."

In addition to the face-centered cubic (fcc) (chi = 3, superconducting), body-centered tetragonal (chi = 4), and body-centered cubic (bcc) (chi = 6) stoichiometric phases, direct evidence for a dilute fcc doped phase, 0 x c </= 1, and for a substoichiometric bcc phase, chi approximately 5, is presented. In contrast, chi = 3 and chi = 4 appear to be line phases with nearly zero solubility of Rb vacancies and interstitials at 300 K. These results are summarized in a provisional binary phase diagram."
https://openalex.org/W2046355134,"The deregulation movement has motivated the experimental study of auction markets designed for interdependent network industries such as natural gas pipelines or electric power systems. Decentralized agents submit bids to buy commodity and offers to sell transportation and commodity to a computerized dispatch center. Computer algorithms determine prices and allocations that maximize the gains from exchange in the system relative to the submitted bids and offers. The problem is important, because traditionally the scale and coordination economies in such industries were thought to require regulation. Laboratory experiments are used to study feasibility, limitations, incentives, and performance of proposed market designs for deregulation, providing motivation for new theory."
https://openalex.org/W2084256443,"A technique has been developed to artificially fossilize microscopic algae in crystalline silica under conditions of moderately elevated temperature and pressure. The technique is designed to simulate geochemical processes thought to have resulted in the preservation of organic microfossils in Precambrian bedded cherts. In degree of preservation and mineralogic setting, the artificially permineralized microorganisms are comparable to naturally occurring fossil algae."
https://openalex.org/W2057501632,"Hydrogenic calcite and opaline silica deposits in fault zones at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, have created considerable public and scientific controversy because of the possible development of a high-level nuclear waste repository at this location. Strontium and uranium isotopic compositions of hydrogenic materials were used to test whether the veins could have formed by upwelling of deep-seated waters. The vein deposits are isotopically distinct from ground water in the two aquifers that underlie Yucca Mountain, indicating that the calcite could not have precipitated from ground water. The data are consistent with a surficial origin for the hydrogenic deposits."

Extrapolating backward in time, it is inferred that the galaxies were all compressed at a beginning epoch into some sort of hot, gaseous medium."

The result is a new class of orientation and guiding structures for liquids: electric ""walls"" contain the liquid. The dielectric siphon is an example of such a system. A simple laminar flow model for the device successfully describes the operation of the siphon."

https://openalex.org/W4242316579,"In the Research News article ""A ;mitey' theory for gene jumping"" (6 Sept., p. 1093), Jean Marx erred when she wrote that the groups of Marilyn A. Houck and Margaret G. Kidwell (Reports, 6 Sept., p. 1125) focused on Proctolaelaps regalis as a possible carrier of P elements among Drosophila species by a ""process of elimination."" Viruses were not screened for P elements during the study, as implied, nor were any other organisms. Rather, the work was initiated by acarologist Houck (then on the faculty of the University of Arizona), who was aware of P element history from conversations with the Kidwell lab. Houck and Ken Peterson, a postdoc in the Kidwell lab, then initiated the Southern blot analysis that pointed to the presence of P element DNA in P. regalis, and Jonathan Clark, a postdoc at Arizona's Center for Insect Science, significantly extended the work through the application of polymerase chain reaction. Their data do not exclude the possibility of viral participation in the system, however."
