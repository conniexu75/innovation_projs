https://openalex.org/W2041532378,"Thermoelectric materials are solid-state energy converters whose combination of thermal, electrical, and semiconducting properties allows them to be used to convert waste heat into electricity or electrical power directly into cooling and heating. These materials can be competitive with fluid-based systems, such as two-phase air-conditioning compressors or heat pumps, or used in smaller-scale applications such as in automobile seats, night-vision systems, and electrical-enclosure cooling. More widespread use of thermoelectrics requires not only improving the intrinsic energy-conversion efficiency of the materials but also implementing recent advancements in system architecture. These principles are illustrated with several proven and potential applications of thermoelectrics."
https://openalex.org/W2057099146,"There is substantial interest in the development of drugs that limit the extent of ischemia-induced cardiac damage caused by myocardial infarction or by certain surgical procedures. Here, using an unbiased proteomic search, we identified mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) as an enzyme whose activation correlates with reduced ischemic heart damage in rodent models. A high-throughput screen yielded a small-molecule activator of ALDH2 (Alda-1) that, when administered to rats before an ischemic event, reduced infarct size by 60%, most likely through its inhibitory effect on the formation of cytotoxic aldehydes. In vitro, Alda-1 was a particularly effective activator of ALDH2*2, an inactive mutant form of the enzyme that is found in 40% of East Asian populations. Thus, pharmacologic enhancement of ALDH2 activity may be useful for patients with wild-type or mutant ALDH2 who are subjected to cardiac ischemia, such as during coronary bypass surgery."
https://openalex.org/W1980473219,"The use of quantum-mechanically entangled light to illuminate objects can provide substantial enhancements over unentangled light for detecting and imaging those objects in the presence of high levels of noise and loss. Each signal sent out is entangled with an ancilla, which is retained. Detection takes place via an entangling measurement on the returning signal together with the ancilla. This paper shows that for photodetection, quantum illumination with m bits of entanglement can in principle increase the effective signal-to-noise ratio by a factor of 2(m), an exponential improvement over unentangled illumination. The enhancement persists even when noise and loss are so great that no entanglement survives at the detector."
https://openalex.org/W1981798449,"Seismic velocity changes and nonvolcanic tremor activity in the Parkfield area in California reveal that large earthquakes induce long-term perturbations of crustal properties in the San Andreas fault zone. The 2003 San Simeon and 2004 Parkfield earthquakes both reduced seismic velocities that were measured from correlations of the ambient seismic noise and induced an increased nonvolcanic tremor activity along the San Andreas fault. After the Parkfield earthquake, velocity reduction and nonvolcanic tremor activity remained elevated for more than 3 years and decayed over time, similarly to afterslip derived from GPS (Global Positioning System) measurements. These observations suggest that the seismic velocity changes are related to co-seismic damage in the shallow layers and to deep co-seismic stress change and postseismic stress relaxation within the San Andreas fault zone."
https://openalex.org/W1975763913,"microRNAs (miRNAs) play crucial roles in numerous developmental and metabolic processes in plants and animals. The steady-state levels of miRNAs need to be properly controlled to ensure normal development. Whereas the framework of miRNA biogenesis is established, factors involved in miRNA degradation remain unknown. Here, we show that a family of exoribonucleases encoded by the SMALL RNA DEGRADING NUCLEASE ( SDN ) genes degrades mature miRNAs in Arabidopsis . SDN1 acts specifically on single-stranded miRNAs in vitro and is sensitive to the 2′- O -methyl modification on the 3′ terminal ribose of miRNAs. Simultaneous knockdown of three SDN genes in vivo results in elevated miRNA levels and pleiotropic developmental defects. Therefore, we have uncovered the enzymes that degrade miRNAs and demonstrated that miRNA turnover is crucial for plant development."
https://openalex.org/W2015866661,"The enzyme mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) is a major target for therapeutic intervention to treat many human diseases, including cancer, but very little is known about the processes that control levels of mTOR protein. Here, we show that mTOR is targeted for ubiquitination and consequent degradation by binding to the tumor suppressor protein FBXW7. Human breast cancer cell lines and primary tumors showed a reciprocal relation between loss of FBXW7 and deletion or mutation of PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog), which also activates mTOR. Tumor cell lines harboring deletions or mutations in FBXW7 are particularly sensitive to rapamycin treatment, which suggests that loss of FBXW7 may be a biomarker for human cancers susceptible to treatment with inhibitors of the mTOR pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2030637789,"The rise and diversification of the dinosaurs in the Late Triassic, from 230 to 200 million years ago, is a classic example of an evolutionary radiation with supposed competitive replacement. A comparison of evolutionary rates and morphological disparity of basal dinosaurs and their chief “competitors,” the crurotarsan archosaurs, shows that dinosaurs exhibited lower disparity and an indistinguishable rate of character evolution. The radiation of Triassic archosaurs as a whole is characterized by declining evolutionary rates and increasing disparity, suggesting a decoupling of character evolution from body plan variety. The results strongly suggest that historical contingency, rather than prolonged competition or general “superiority,” was the primary factor in the rise of dinosaurs."
https://openalex.org/W2034464888,"Classical ecological theory suggests that the coexistence of consumer species is fostered by resource-use differences, leading to greater resource use in communities with more species. However, explicit empirical support for this idea is lacking, because resource use by species is generally confounded with other species-specific attributes. We overcame this obstacle by co-opting behavioral plasticity in food choice among a group of animal consumers, allowing us to manipulate patterns of resource use while controlling for the effects of species identity and diversity. Within an aphid-parasitoid-radish community, we created a fully factorial manipulation of consumer resource-use breadth (specialist versus generalist) and species diversity (one versus three species) and found that resource exploitation improved with greater specialist, but not generalist, diversity. Therefore, resource partitioning, and not diversity per se, fostered greater overall resource consumption in our multispecies consumer communities."
https://openalex.org/W2025079053,"The microstructure and properties of a material depend on dynamic processes such as defect motion, nucleation and growth, and phase transitions. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) can spatially resolve these nanoscale phenomena but lacks the time resolution for direct observation. We used a photoemitted electron pulse to probe dynamic events with “snapshot” diffraction and imaging at 15-nanosecond resolution inside of a dynamic TEM. With the use of this capability, the moving reaction front of reactive nanolaminates is observed in situ. Time-resolved images and diffraction show a transient cellular morphology in a dynamically mixing, self-propagating reaction front, revealing brief phase separation during cooling, and thus provide insights into the mechanisms driving the self-propagating high-temperature synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2060436934,"Object recognition is challenging because each object produces myriad retinal images. Responses of neurons from the inferior temporal cortex (IT) are selective to different objects, yet tolerant (""invariant"") to changes in object position, scale, and pose. How does the brain construct this neuronal tolerance? We report a form of neuronal learning that suggests the underlying solution. Targeted alteration of the natural temporal contiguity of visual experience caused specific changes in IT position tolerance. This unsupervised temporal slowness learning (UTL) was substantial, increased with experience, and was significant in single IT neurons after just 1 hour. Together with previous theoretical work and human object perception experiments, we speculate that UTL may reflect the mechanism by which the visual stream builds and maintains tolerant object representations."

https://openalex.org/W2156735965,"Background Diverse bacterial genomes encode numerous small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) that regulate myriad biological processes. While bioinformatic algorithms have proven effective in identifying sRNA-encoding loci, the lack of tools and infrastructure with which to execute these computationally demanding algorithms has limited their utilization. Genome-wide predictions of sRNA-encoding genes have been conducted in less than 3% of all sequenced bacterial strains, leading to critical gaps in current annotations. The relative paucity of genome-wide sRNA prediction represents a critical gap in current annotations of bacterial genomes and has limited examination of larger issues in sRNA biology, such as sRNA evolution. Methodology/Principal Findings We have developed and deployed SIPHT, a high throughput computational tool that utilizes workflow management and distributed computing to effectively conduct kingdom-wide predictions and annotations of intergenic sRNA-encoding genes. Candidate sRNA-encoding loci are identified based on the presence of putative Rho-independent terminators downstream of conserved intergenic sequences, and each locus is annotated for several features, including conservation in other species, association with one of several transcription factor binding sites and homology to any of over 300 previously identified sRNAs and cis-regulatory RNA elements. Using SIPHT, we conducted searches for putative sRNA-encoding genes in all 932 bacterial replicons in the NCBI database. These searches yielded nearly 60% of previously confirmed sRNAs, hundreds of previously annotated cis-encoded regulatory RNA elements such as riboswitches, and over 45,000 novel candidate intergenic loci. Conclusions/Significance Candidate loci were identified across all branches of the bacterial evolutionary tree, suggesting a central and ubiquitous role for RNA-mediated regulation among bacterial species. Annotation of candidate loci by SIPHT provides clues into the potential biological function of thousands of previously confirmed and candidate regulatory RNAs and affords new insights into the evolution of bacterial riboregulation."
https://openalex.org/W2162472433,"Community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) strains typically carry genes encoding Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL). We used wild-type parental and isogenic PVL-deletion (Δpvl) strains of USA300 (LAC and SF8300) and USA400 (MW2) to test whether PVL alters global gene regulatory networks and contributes to pathogenesis of bacteremia, a hallmark feature of invasive staphylococcal disease. Microarray and proteomic analyses revealed that PVL does not alter gene or protein expression, thereby demonstrating that any contribution of PVL to CA-MRSA pathogenesis is not mediated through interference of global gene regulatory networks. Inasmuch as a direct role for PVL in CA-MRSA pathogenesis remains to be determined, we developed a rabbit bacteremia model of CA-MRSA infection to evaluate the effects of PVL. Following experimental infection of rabbits, an animal species whose granulocytes are more sensitive to the effects of PVL compared with the mouse, we found a contribution of PVL to pathogenesis over the time course of bacteremia. At 24 and 48 hours post infection, PVL appears to play a modest, but measurable role in pathogenesis during the early stages of bacteremic seeding of the kidney, the target organ from which bacteria were not cleared. However, the early survival advantage of this USA300 strain conferred by PVL was lost by 72 hours post infection. These data are consistent with the clinical presentation of rapid-onset, fulminant infection that has been associated with PVL-positive CA-MRSA strains. Taken together, our data indicate a modest and transient positive effect of PVL in the acute phase of bacteremia, thereby providing evidence that PVL contributes to CA-MRSA pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2166723435,"Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), a recessive hereditary neurodegenerative disease in humans, has been linked to mutations in the survival motor neuron (SMN) gene. SMA patients display early onset lethality coupled with motor neuron loss and skeletal muscle atrophy. We used Drosophila, which encodes a single SMN ortholog, survival motor neuron (Smn), to model SMA, since reduction of Smn function leads to defects that mimic the SMA pathology in humans. Here we show that a normal neuromuscular junction (NMJ) structure depends on SMN expression and that SMN concentrates in the post-synaptic NMJ regions. We conducted a screen for genetic modifiers of an Smn phenotype using the Exelixis collection of transposon-induced mutations, which affects approximately 50% of the Drosophila genome. This screen resulted in the recovery of 27 modifiers, thereby expanding the genetic circuitry of Smn to include several genes not previously known to be associated with this locus. Among the identified modifiers was wishful thinking (wit), a type II BMP receptor, which was shown to alter the Smn NMJ phenotype. Further characterization of two additional members of the BMP signaling pathway, Mothers against dpp (Mad) and Daughters against dpp (Dad), also modify the Smn NMJ phenotype. The NMJ defects caused by loss of Smn function can be ameliorated by increasing BMP signals, suggesting that increased BMP activity in SMA patients may help to alleviate symptoms of the disease. These results confirm that our genetic approach is likely to identify bona fide modulators of SMN activity, especially regarding its role at the neuromuscular junction, and as a consequence, may identify putative SMA therapeutic targets."
https://openalex.org/W2057097356,"Mexican and Peruvian hairless dogs and Chinese crested dogs are characterized by missing hair and teeth, a phenotype termed canine ectodermal dysplasia (CED). CED is inherited as a monogenic autosomal semidominant trait. With genomewide association analysis we mapped the CED mutation to a 102–kilo–base pair interval on chromosome 17. The associated interval contains a previously uncharacterized member of the forkhead box transcription factor family (FOXI3), which is specifically expressed in developing hair and teeth. Mutation analysis revealed a frameshift mutation within the FOXI3 coding sequence in hairless dogs. Thus, we have identified FOXI3 as a regulator of ectodermal development."
https://openalex.org/W1997366047,"In many cell types, transfer of Ca(2+) released via ryanodine receptors (RyR) to the mitochondrial matrix is locally supported by high [Ca(2+)] microdomains at close contacts between the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and mitochondria. Here we studied whether the close contacts were secured via direct physical coupling in cardiac muscle using isolated rat heart mitochondria (RHMs). ""Immuno-organelle chemistry"" revealed RyR2 and calsequestrin-positive SR particles associated with mitochondria in both crude and Percoll-purified ""heavy"" mitochondrial fractions (cRHM and pRHM), to a smaller extent in the latter one. Mitochondria-associated vesicles were also visualized by electron microscopy in the RHMs. Western blot analysis detected greatly reduced presence of SR markers (calsequestrin, SERCA2a, and phospholamban) in pRHM, suggesting that the mitochondria-associated particles represented a small subfraction of the SR. Fluorescence calcium imaging in rhod2-loaded cRHM revealed mitochondrial matrix [Ca(2+)] ([Ca(2+)](m)) responses to caffeine-induced Ca(2+) release that were prevented when thapsigargin was added to predeplete the SR or by mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake inhibitors. Importantly, caffeine failed to increase [Ca(2+)] in the large volume of the incubation medium, suggesting that local Ca(2+) transfer between the SR particles and mitochondria mediated the [Ca(2+)](m) signal. Despite the substantially reduced SR presence, pRHM still displayed a caffeine-induced [Ca(2+)](m) rise comparable with the one recorded in cRHM. Thus, a relatively small fraction of the total SR is physically coupled and transfers Ca(2+) locally to the mitochondria in cardiac muscle. The transferred Ca(2+) stimulates dehydrogenase activity and affects mitochondrial membrane permeabilization, indicating the broad significance of the physical coupling in mitochondrial function."
https://openalex.org/W1965706396,"After 3 years and 31 close flybys of Titan by the Cassini Orbiter, Titan was finally observed in the shocked solar wind, outside of Saturn's magnetosphere. These observations revealed that Titan's flow-induced magnetosphere was populated by “fossil” fields originating from Saturn, to which the satellite was exposed before its excursion through the magnetopause. In addition, strong magnetic shear observed at the edge of Titan's induced magnetosphere suggests that reconnection may have been involved in the replacement of the fossil fields by the interplanetary magnetic field."
https://openalex.org/W2072611842,"Angiotensin II induces cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, but its consequences on cardiomyocyte metabolism and energy supply are not completely understood. Here we investigate the effect of angiotensin II on glucose and fatty acid utilization and the modifying role of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a key regulator of metabolism and proliferation. Treatment of H9C2 cardiomyocytes with angiotensin II (Ang II, 1 μm, 4 h) increased [3H]leucine incorporation, up-regulated the mRNA expression of the hypertrophy marker genes MLC, ANF, BNP, and β-MHC, and decreased the phosphorylation of the negative mTOR-regulator tuberin (TSC-2). Rat neonatal cardiomyocytes showed similar results. Western blot analysis revealed a time- and concentration-dependent down-regulation of AMPK-phosphorylation in the presence of angiotensin II, whereas the protein expression of the catalytic α-subunit remained unchanged. This was paralleled by membrane translocation of glucose-transporter type 4 (GLUT4), increased uptake of [3H]glucose and transient down-regulation of phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), whereas fatty acid uptake remained unchanged. Similarly, short-term transaortic constriction in mice resulted in down-regulation of P-AMPK and P-ACC but up-regulation of GLUT4 membrane translocation in the heart. Preincubation of cardiomyocytes with the AMPK stimulator 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-d-ribofuranoside (AICAR; 1 mm, 4 h) completely prevented the angiotensin II-induced cardiomyocytes hypertrophy. In addition, AICAR reversed the metabolic effects of angiotensin II: GLUT4 translocation was reduced, but ACC phosphorylation and TSC phosphorylation were elevated. In summary, angiotensin II-induced hypertrophy of cardiomyocytes is accompanied by decreased activation of AMPK, increased glucose uptake, and decreased mTOR inhibition. Stimulation with the AMPK activator AICAR reverses these metabolic changes, increases fatty acid utilization, and inhibits cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.

Myocardial hypertrophy is a response to hemodynamic overload such as hypertension or aortic valve stenosis. A fundamental mechanism leading to both hypertrophy and subsequent heart failure is activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosteron system. All components of the system are expressed at the mRNA and protein levels in the heart (2Suzuki J. Matsubara H. Urakami M. Inada M. Circ. Res. 1993; 73: 439-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), circulating plasma concentrations of angiotensin II (Ang II) correlate to the extend of LV hypertrophy (3Weber K.T. Brilla C.G. Campbell S.E. Guarda E. Zhou G. Sriram K. Basic Res. Cardiol. 1993; 88: 107-124PubMed Google Scholar) and the progression to heart failure (4Neri Serneri G.G. Boddi M. Modesti P.A. Cecioni I. Coppo M. Padeletti L. Michelucci A. Colella A. Galanti G. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 977-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), and the increase in left ventricular mass can be prevented with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (5Baker K.M. Chernin M.I. Wixson S.K. Aceto J.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: H324-H332PubMed Google Scholar). Molecular mechanisms by which the renin-angiotensin-aldosteron system evokes cardiac hypertrophy are activation of protein kinase cascades, initiation of a fetal-like gene program, impaired calcium handling, and increased production of reactive oxygen species (6Custodis F. Eberl M. Kilter H. Bohm M. Laufs U. Cardiovasc. Res. 2006; 71: 342-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Changes in substrate utilization occurring during cardiomyocyte hypertrophy are not well known, and their consequences on cardiomyocyte metabolism and energy supply are not completely understood. A shift in the substrate pattern from fatty acid oxidation to glucose utilization appears to occur in different forms of LV hypertrophy (7Sambandam N. Lopaschuk G.D. Brownsey R.W. Allard M.F. Heart Fail. Rev. 2002; 7: 161-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), but whether metabolic changes precede hypertrophy or result from it and which pathways are involved is unknown. A key metabolic regulator is AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a heterotrimeric protein that is centrally involved in controlling cellular energy homeostasis. Its activation through metabolic stress stimulates energy-generating processes and has been shown to regulate hypertrophy-regulating genes in several models (8Motoshima H. Goldstein B.J. Igata M. Araki E. J. Physiol. 2006; 574: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). When AMPK binds AMP the α-subunit gets sensitized to phosphorylation by upstream kinases and increases kinase activity. Upon activation AMPK increases fatty acid oxidation by phosphorylating ACC, in turn decreasing malonyl-CoA content and activating carnitine palmitoyltransferase-I. In several tissues AMPK has been shown to also regulate glucose metabolism (9Minokoshi Y. Alquier T. Furukawa N. Kim Y.B. Lee A. Xue B. Mu J. Foufelle F. Ferre P. Birnbaum M.J. Stuck B.J. Kahn B.B. Nature. 2004; 428: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (1348) Google Scholar) and translocation of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) to the plasma membrane (10Yamaguchi S. Katahira H. Ozawa S. Nakamichi Y. Tanaka T. Shimoyama T. Takahashi K. Yoshimoto K. Imaizumi M.O. Nagamatsu S. Ishida H. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: E643-E649Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Activated AMPK mediates changes in protein expression through regulating the mTOR pathway in multiple cell types by increasing phosphorylation of tuberin (TSC-2) (8Motoshima H. Goldstein B.J. Igata M. Araki E. J. Physiol. 2006; 574: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). mTOR is known to be crucial in the development and progression of LV hypertrophy (11McMullen J.R. Sherwood M.C. Tarnavski O. Zhang L. Dorfman A.L. Shioi T. Izumo S. Circulation. 2004; 109: 3050-3055Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). But the relevance of AMPK activation in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and metabolism is still in question. Therefore, the aim of the study was to examine the effects of angiotensin II on glucose and fatty acid utilization in cardiomyocytes, and whether metabolic alterations through modulation of AMP-activated protein kinase would prevent angiotensin II-induced hypertrophy. Cell Culture—Rat neonatal cardiomyocytes were isolated as described (12Laufs U. Kilter H. Konkol C. Wassmann S. Bohm M. Nickenig G. Cardiovasc. Res. 2002; 53: 911-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Briefly, hearts of neonatal rats 2–4 days of age were digested with pankreatin and collagenase type 2, the cell suspension was centrifuged and filtered to extract fibroblasts, and cardiomyocytes were counted and seeded at 2–4 × 106 per well. After overnight incubation viability and contractile function was evaluated microscopically, cardiomyocytes were washed and serum starved before using for experiments. H9C2 rat cardiomyocytes (LGC Promochem, Wesel, Germany) are an immortalized cell line derived from embryonic rat hearts using selective serial passage. Cells were grown on tissue culture dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium complete cell culture medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin and streptomycin, maintained in 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were not allowed to become confluent to prevent the loss of differentiation potential. Experiments were performed at passage 15–23. For protein and mRNA extraction cells were seeded in 10-cm dishes, starved for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium starvation medium and used for experiments. Cells used for metabolic uptake assays were seeded in triplicates in six-well plates for 48 h, washed twice with 2 ml of PBS, and starved for 24 h. After starvation the cells were washed once with PBS and used for experiments. Treatment Conditions—For angiotensin II treatment cells were incubated with 1 μm angiotensin II (purchased from Sigma) for the indicated time periods (5 min to 24 h). AICAR (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-d-ribofuranoside) treatment was done in a concentration of 1 mm for 2 h (from Sigma). In the case of combined incubation AICAR pre-treatment was done for 2 h with 1 mm, followed by angiotensin treatment for 4 h with 1 μm. Finally cells were washed with 2 ml of PBS, lysed with 200 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer, scraped, and homogenized with 5 min ultrasound. After homogenization debris was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and supernatant was transferred to Eppendorf cups for storage at −20 °C. Western Analysis—For Western blot analysis protein concentration in cell lysates was measured using a Bio-Rad DC Protein Assay Kit. Protein (50 μg) was loaded in each slot of a 10% polyacrylamide gel, separated at 120 V for 2 h and transferred with 350 mA for 1.5 h. Membrane were stained with Ponceau solution, washed with TBS-Tween, and blocked with 5% milk for 30 min at 4 °C. Incubations with primary antibodies were done at 4 °C for 12 h. Primary antibodies were purchased from New England Biolabs (P-AMPK, P-ACC) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology (GLUT4, α2-AMPK, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, P-tuberin). Secondary antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz and incubated at room temperature for 30 min (goat) and 90 min (rabbit), respectively. After washing with PBS-Tween (20 min, twice) and PBS (10 min, twice) membranes were developed with ECL scintillation fluid obtained from GE Healthcare and exposed to hyperfilm. The amount of GLUT4 in the membrane fraction was determined after membrane preparation. Cells were harvested as described above, mixed at equal volumes with 1 mm KCl, and centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g at 4 °C. The resultant supernatant was collected as cytosolic fraction. The pellet was resuspended, centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h, and the resulting supernatant regarded as the membrane fraction. Separation of cytosolic and membrane proteins was controlled by Western blotting using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Bands were scanned using XnView normalized for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and the density values were expressed as % of control. Real-time Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—For reverse transcriptase-PCR RNA was extracted by the chloroform/isopropyl alcohol method. After photometric quantification of the isolated RNA, reverse transcriptase-PCR was performed with the TaqMan System (13Laufs U. Werner N. Link A. Endres M. Wassmann S. Jurgens K. Miche E. Bohm M. Nickenig G. Circulation. 2004; 109: 220-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). mRNA expression was normalized to expression of the housekeeping gene 18S. The primers were as follows: for ANF, 5-TGG GCT CCT TCT CCA TCA CC and 5-GCC AAA AGG CCA GGA AGA GG; for BNP, 5-CAG AAC AAT CCA CGA TGC AG and 5-GCT GTC TCT GAG CCA TTT CC; for β-MHC, 5-GCC TAC CTC ATG GGA CTG AA and 5-ACA TTC TGC CCT TTG GTG AC; for MLC, 5-AGG CCT TCA CAA TCA TGG AC and 5-TCG TTT TTC ACG TTC ACT CG; and for 18S, 5-TTG ATT AAG TCC CTG CCC TTT GT and 5-CGA TCC GAG GGC CTA ACT A. Leucine Incorporation Assay—Incorporation of radioactive-labeled amino acid [3H]leucine was quantified as a parameter of protein synthesis in cardiac myocytes. Assay protocol was performed as previously described (6Custodis F. Eberl M. Kilter H. Bohm M. Laufs U. Cardiovasc. Res. 2006; 71: 342-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Cells were serum-starved overnight, incubated with the indicated treatment (Ang II for 6 h; AICAR for 2 h; AICAR pretreatment for 4 h), and 1 μCi/ml l-4,5-3H-labeled leucine was added for another 12 h at 37 °C, cells were washed with PBS, and harvested in ice-cold lysis buffer. Aliquots were collected for liquid scintillation counting. Glucose Uptake Assay—To quantify glucose uptake cardiomyocytes were either untreated (basal) or treated with Ang II (1 μm), AICAR (1 mm), of AICAR + Ang II for 10 min, followed by the addition of 2-deoxy-d-2,6-[3H]glucose (0.1 μCi/well) for an additional 30 min at 37 °C. Reaction was stopped by aspirating the medium, washing the cells with PBS, and solubilization in 1 ml of lysis buffer. Samples were assayed for 2-deoxy-d-2,6-[3H]glucose uptake as disintegrations per min as assessed by liquid scintillation counting. Glucose uptake was expressed as a percentage of basal uptake. Palmitic Acid Uptake Assay—To quantify uptake of palmitic acid, cardiomyocytes were either untreated (basal) or treated with Ang II (1 μm), AICAR (1 mm), or AICAR + Ang II for 10 min. Reaction was initiated by adding 1 μCi of [14C]palmitic acid, incubation at 37 °C for another 30 min, and terminated by rapid washing with 1 ml of ice-cold PBS. Cells were disrupted with 1 ml of lysis buffer and scraping, and cell-associated radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. Nile Blue Staining—To assess cellular fatty acid content, cardiomyocytes were seeded on cell culture coverslips (Nalge Nunc, Rochester, NY) in 24-well plates and treated with 1 μm angiotensin II for 4 h, and/or 1 mm AICAR for 2 h. Cells were washed twice with 500 μl of ice-cold PBS and fixed with formalin. The slides were immersed in 7% aqueous solution of nile blue stain for 10 min at 60 °C, then washed with water to remove the excess stain, followed by a 10-min 1% acetic acid wash, rinse in water, and air-dried. Quantification was done by a blinded observer using a Nicon eclipse TS 100 microscope, ×40 magnification, and digital image analysis with Lucia G, version 4.60. Transaortic Constriction—Animal experiments were approved by the animal ethics committee of the Universität des Saarlandes and conform with National Institutes of Health publication number 85-23, revised 1996, and conducted in accordance with institutional guidelines. 10-Week-old male C57/Bl6 mice (Charles River Laboratories, Sulzfeld, Germany) were housed under standard conditions. Animals were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine for transaortic constriction (TAC) (14Adam O. Frost G. Custodis F. Sussman M.A. Schafers H.J. Bohm M. Laufs U. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 2007; 50: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). After orotracheal intubation mice were ventilated by a volume cycled rodent ventilator (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA) on supplemental oxygen. The chest cavity was entered in the second intercostal space and aortic constriction was performed by tying a 7-0 nylon suture ligature against a 27-gauge needle to yield a narrowing 360 mm in diameter and a transverse aortic constriction of 65–70%. A 1.4 French pressure-transducing catheter (Mikro Tip Catheter, Millar instruments) was used for LV pressure measurements. Effective ligation was defined as an increase in left ventricular systolic pressure to at least 200%. All effectively constricted mice developed an increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 200–400%. Control mice underwent a sham operation and showed no significant increase in systolic or diastolic pressures. After 30 min of LV pressure measurements post-constriction hearts were rapidly excised, weighed, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Statistical Analysis—Band intensities were analyzed by densitometry. All values are expressed as mean ± S.E. Unpaired Student's t tests and analysis of variance for multiple comparisons were applied. Post hoc comparisons were performed with the Bonferroni test. Prism software, version 4.0, was used. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. Angiotensin II-induced Changes in Leucine Incorporation, TSC Phosphorylation, and mRNA Expression of Hypertrophy Markers in H9C2 Cardiomyocytes—Treatment of H9C2 cells with angiotensin II (Ang II), 1 μm for 4 h, induced an increase in leucine incorporation to 163 ± 12% compared with control (Fig. 1A), p < 0.001; (n = 4 per group). mRNA expression of the fetal genes atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), β-myosin heavy chain (β-MHC), and myosin light chain (MLC) standardized to the housekeeping gene 18S was increased to 189 ± 25, 166 ± 27, 164 ± 18, and 176 ± 26%, respectively (Fig. 1B), p < 0.01 (n = 5 for MLC, ANP; n = 4 for BNP, β-MHC). Phosphorylation of the negative mTOR regulator tuberin was decreased to 55 ± 9% (Fig. 1C), p < 0.01 (n = 8 per group). Rat neonatal cardiomyocytes showed similar effects (data not shown). Angiotensin II Induces GLUT4 Translocation and Glucose Uptake in Cardiomyocytes—Next, we determined the associated changes in substrate utilization. Treatment with Ang II (1 μm, 4 h) increased the membranous fraction of GLUT4 in rat neonatal cardiomyocytes to 185 ± 21%, p < 0.01 (n = 4), accompanied by an increase in cellular uptake of 2-deoxy-d-2,6-[3H]glucose to 180 ± 12%, p < 0.01 (n = 12) (Fig. 2). Angiotensin II Transiently Decreases ACC Phosphorylation in Cardiomyocytes—Exposure of H9C2 cardiomyocytes to angiotensin II (1 μm) for 2 h decreased the phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase to 63.7 ± 8.9%, p < 0.05 (n = 3 per group). This effect was no longer significant after 4 h. Angiotensin (1 μm for 4 h) did not alter the uptake of 14C-labeled palmitic acid (Fig. 3). Angiotensin II Decreases Phosphorylation of AMP-activated Protein Kinase—To evaluate a possible involvement of AMPK we assessed the phosphorylation status of this key metabolic regulator. Treatment with angiotensin II led to a significant reduction of AMPK phosphorylation in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. The maximum depressive effect of 58 ± 4% was reached with 1 μm Ang II at an incubation period of 4 h, p < 0.01. Expression of AMPK represented by the α2-subunit remained unchanged (n = 4 control versus 8 for Ang II) (Fig. 4). Preincubation with the AMPK-activator AICAR (1 mm, 1 h) completely reversed the angiotensin II-induced inhibition of AMPK, p < 0.001 (n = 8 control versus 4 Ang II/Ang II + AICAR) (Fig. 5).FIGURE 5AICAR reverses angiotensin II-induced AMPK inhibition. Preincubation with the AMPK activator AICAR (1 mm, 1 h) reverses the angiotensin II-induced inhibition of AMPK phosphorylation, expression of the catalytic subunit stays unchanged (n = 8 control versus 4 Ang II/Ang II + AICAR). *, p < 0.05; ***, p < 0.001. GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Effect of AMPK Stimulation on Angiotensin-induced Metabolic Changes—To test whether these changes in AMPK phosphorylation mediate the observed shift in glucose utilization, we performed the metabolic measurements upon treatment with the AMPK activator alone (1 mm, 4 h) and after preincubation followed by angiotensin II treatment (1 μm, 4 h) (n = 6 control versus 4 Ang II/AICAR/Ang II + AICAR). We found a significant decrease in GLUT4 translocation to 19 ± 2% with AICAR treatment alone and 43 ± 3% after AICAR preincubation with Ang II treatment, p < 0.001. Glucose-uptake remained unchanged after AICAR pre-treatment and AICAR treatment alone as well. In contrast, ACC phosphorylation and early fatty acid uptake were markedly increased by AMPK activation to 284 ± 23%, p < 0.001, and 160 ± 17%, p < 0.05, respectively, an effect that was not reversed by consecutive angiotensin II treatment. Angiotensin II significantly, but only partially reversed the AMPK-induced activation of palmitic acid uptake to 132 ± 7% of control, p < 0.05 versus Ang II (Fig. 6). Effect of Angiotensin II and AICAR Treatment on Fatty Acid Content—To clarify the consequences of a differential regulation of fatty acid uptake and fatty acid oxidation upon Ang II and AICAR treatments, nile blue staining was performed. Treatment with Ang II (1 μm, 4 h) induced a significant increase of fatty acids to 221 ± 19% versus control, p < 0.001 (Fig. 7), which was prevented by pre-treatment with the AMPK activator AICAR (130 ± 11%, p < 0.01 versus control) (n = 6 control versus 4 Ang II/AICAR/Ang II + AICAR). Short-term Increase of Cardiac Afterload Decreases AMPK Phosphorylation and Increases GLUT4 Translocation—To test the cardiac regulation of AMPK, P-ACC, and GLUT4 in vivo, TAC was applied to increase cardiac afterload in mice (n = 3 Sham versus 4 TAC) (14Adam O. Frost G. Custodis F. Sussman M.A. Schafers H.J. Bohm M. Laufs U. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 2007; 50: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Compared with sham-operated controls, 30 min after TAC the hearts showed a profound down-regulation of P-AMPK to 8.5 ± 3.3%, p < 0.01. This was associated with a decrease of P-ACC to 12.3 ± 2.2%, p < 0.01, and up-regulation of GLUT4 membrane translocation to 238 ± 56%, p < 0.05 (Fig. 8). Inhibition of Angiotensin-induced Hypertrophy by Stimulation of AMPK and Inhibition of Glucose Uptake—Consequently, the impact of the AMPK-mediated substrate changes on cardiomyocyte protein synthesis and regulation of hypertrophy markers was assessed. Activation of AMPK by AICAR (1 mm, 4 h) caused a marked increase in tuberin phosphorylation to 285 ± 38%, p < 0.001 (n = 8 per group) (Fig. 9), representing inhibition of mTOR signaling. The mRNA expression of ANF, BNP, and β-MHC was reduced to 63 ± 12, 52 ± 9, and 37 ± 5% compared with control, p < 0.01 (n = 6 per group). Angiotensin II-induced [3H]leucine incorporation was potently prevented by activation of AMPK (41 ± 8%, p < 0.001) (n = 12 control versus 6 Ang II/AICAR/Ang II + AICAR). AICAR alone had no effect. These experiments show that angiotensin II-induced hypertrophy in cultured cardiomyocytes is accompanied by profound changes in substrate utilization. The data identify phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase as a metabolic switch reconstituting fatty acid consumption that is able to prevent cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. There is mounting evidence that substrate utilization plays a crucial role in cardiac contractile performance and in limiting damage to the heart (15Frey N. Olson E.N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2003; 65: 45-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (1193) Google Scholar). The metabolic changes in left ventricular hypertrophy differ between adaptive and maladaptive forms of remodeling and may depend on the course of the disease (16Ritchie R.H. Delbridge L.M. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 2006; 33: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The particular consequences of angiotensin-induced hypertrophy are not known. It is therefore of interest to identify the influence of the key players in left ventricular remodeling on cardiomyocyte metabolism and energy supply, such as the members of the renin-angiotensin-aldosteron system cascade. Angiotensin II mediates cardiomyocyte hypertrophy directly and indirectly through autocrine and paracrine effects (17Gray M.O. Long C.S. Kalinyak J.E. Li H.T. Karliner J.S. Cardiovasc. Res. 1998; 40: 352-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 18Malhotra R. Sadoshima J. Brosius III, F.C. Izumo S. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Overexpression of its type I receptor induces cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling, and treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers prevents these effects (19Paradis P. Dali-Youcef N. Paradis F.W. Thibault G. Nemer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 931-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). But only a little is known about its influence on cardiac energy metabolism. Here we show in cardiomyocytes that angiotensin II-induced hypertrophy is associated with increased translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane and increased utilization of glucose. This observation is in agreement with up-regulation of glucose utilization observed during increases of afterload, e.g. arterial hypertension (7Sambandam N. Lopaschuk G.D. Brownsey R.W. Allard M.F. Heart Fail. Rev. 2002; 7: 161-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Increased glucose utilization may be an adaptive response with potentially protective effects because ATP production from glucose consumes less oxygen than that from fatty acids (20Grynberg A. Demaison L. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1996; 28: S11-S17PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, oxidation of 1 mol of carbon yields about 29% more ATP for free fatty acid than for glucose, so that in the oxygen abundant state, oxidation of free fatty acid is more high-energy phosphate efficient than glucose. Therefore it is not known whether an increase in glucose utilization would be indeed favorable in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. In cultured cardiac myocytes, we observed a transient decrease of ACC phosphorylation. Furthermore, the cells show an increased content of fatty acids upon Ang II treatment. Importantly, our in vivo experiments using short-term transaortic constriction show a profound down-regulation of P-ACC by cardiac afterload. These findings are in agreement with data describing reduced fatty acid oxidation in failing human hearts (21Razeghi P. Young M.E. Alcorn J.L. Moravec C.S. Frazier O.H. Taegtmeyer H. Circulation. 2001; 104: 2923-2931Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar) and in murine hearts with specific angiotensinogen overexpression (22Pellieux C. Aasum E. Larsen T.S. Montessuit C. Papageorgiou I. Pedrazzini T. Lerch R. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2006; 41: 459-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The resulting energetic consequences are largely unknown. On the one hand the suppression of fatty acid oxidation decreases cardiac oxygen consumption per mol of ATP produced and could therefore be protective. On the other hand decreased fatty acid oxidation may impair cardiac energetics through lipid accumulation causing lipotoxicity (23Ingwall J.S. Weiss R.G. Circ. Res. 2004; 95: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Several models of myocardial lipid accumulation, Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats (24Zhou Y.T. Grayburn P. Karim A. Shimabukuro M. Higa M. Baetens D. Orci L. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1784-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar), overexpression of lipoprotein lipase at cardiomyocytes (25Yagyu H. Chen G. Yokoyama M. Hirata K. Augustus A. Kako Y. Seo T. Hu Y. Lutz E.P. Merkel M. Bensadoun A. Homma S. Goldberg I.J. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 419-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), and cardiac restricted overexpression of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-α (26Finck B.N. Lehman J.J. Leone T.C. Welch M.J. Bennett M.J. Kovacs A. Han X. Gross R.W. Kozak R. Lopaschuk G.D. Kelly D.P. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar), show ventricular hypertrophy and systolic ventricular dysfunction associated with an increased rate of apoptosis. In idiopathic-dilated cardiomyopathy fatty acid oxidation is decreased and associated with an intracellular triglyceride accumulation (27Tomita T. Wilson L. Chiga M. Am. J. Cardiovasc. Pathol. 1990; 3: 81-85PubMed Google Scholar). In our experiments, angiotensin II-treated, hypertrophied cardiomyocytes show a metabolic phenotype of increased glucose utilization and intracellular fatty acid accumulation. Similarly, cardiac afterload induced down-regulation of P-ACC and up-regulation of GLUT4 membrane expression in mice heart. Therefore, induction of fatty acid oxidation, e.g. by AMPK, may be metabolically favorable not only to increase ATP yield but also to reduce toxic effects of intracellular free fatty acids. AMPK is a major stimulator of β-oxidation in many tissues (28Winder W.W. Wilson H.A. Hardie D.G. Rasmussen B.B. Hutber C.A. Call G.B. Clayton R.D. Conley L.M. Yoon S. Zhou B. J. Appl. Physiol. 1997; 82: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 29Saddik M. Gamble J. Witters L.A. Lopaschuk G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25836-25845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An unexpected finding of our experiments was that angiotensin II-induced hypertrophy and glucose utilization were accompanied by down-regulation of AMPK, despite stimulation of energy demanding processes such as cell growth and protein synthesis. The existing literature on the role of AMPK in cardiac pathology is not entirely clear. Russell et al. (30Russell III, R.R. Li J. Coven D.L. Pypaert M. Zechner C. Palmeri M. Giordano F.J. Mu J. Birnbaum M.J. Young L.H. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 114: 495-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar) found an AMPK-dependant increase in GLUT4-membrane translocation in the working heart ischemia model. Similarly, ischemia induced GLUT4 translocation in isolated cardiac myocytes (31Sun D. Nguyen N. DeGrado T.R. Schwaiger M. Brosius III, F.C. Circulation. 1994; 89: 793-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). On the other hand, three decades ago Finck et al. (32Neely J.R. Rovetto M.J. Whitmer J.T. Morgan H.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1973; 225: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) had shown an ischemia-induced reduction of glucose uptake, a finding that was supported by a recent study that found no increase in glucose uptake despite AMPK activation in ischemic isolated working hearts (33Omar M.A. Fraser H. Clanachan A.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2008; 294: H1266-H1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Similarly, the data regarding ACC are not entirely consistent. Frederich et al. (34Frederich M. Balschi J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1928-1932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) show a negative correlation between the activities of AMPK and ACC in the heart. The same has been shown for AMPK-induced phosphorylation in exercised skeletal muscle (35Park S.H. Gammon S.R. Knippers J.D. Paulsen S.R. Rubink D.S. Winder W.W. J. Appl. Physiol. 2002; 92: 2475-2482Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). However, newer data suggest a differential regulation of AMPK and ACC that depends on the time course and the intensity of exercise. Sriwijitkamol and colleagues (36Sriwijitkamol A. Coletta D.K. Wajcberg E. Balbontin G.B. Reyna S.M. Barrientes J. Eagan P.A. Jenkinson C.P. Cersosimo E. Defronzo R.A. Sakamoto K. Musi N. Diabetes. 2007; 56: 836-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) have shown that after 40 min of low intensity exercise the phosphorylation of ACC was increased even though AMPK phosphorylation was unchanged, whereas in the post-exercise period ACC phosphorylation was no longer elevated, whereas AMPK phosphorylation was now slightly increased. Therefore AMPK-dependent metabolic regulation appears to be differentially regulated in different cell types, tissues, and different experimental models. It will be important for future research to confirm cell culture observations in animal models and eventually clinical studies. Here we confirm the cell culture studies in vivo observing a similar regulation upon a short-term increase of afterload in mice heart. However, eventually these data have to be confirmed in human disease. To test the implications of the observed role of AMPK, we treated cardiomyocytes with the AMPK activator AICAR alone or before the induction of hypertrophy with angiotensin II. AMPK activation caused a metabolic switch, favoring utilization of fatty acids over glucose metabolism: AMPK activation induced a robust increase of the phosphorylation of ACC that was not antagonized by angiotensin II treatment. This was accompanied by an increase in palmitic acid uptake, indicating both an increased uptake and intracellular cleavage of lipids. This effect was partially reversed by Ang II co-treatment, suggesting a second modulator that has yet to be elucidated. Regarding glucose metabolism we found a massive decrease in GLUT4 translocation upon AICAR treatment, whereas glucose uptake remained unchanged compared with control cells. The constancy in glucose uptake is most likely due to the expression of other glucose transporters (e.g. GLUT1) in the cardiomyocyte plasma membrane, maintaining the basal cellular need (37Kraegen E.W. Sowden J.A. Halstead M.B. Clark P.W. Rodnick K.J. Chisholm D.J. James D.E. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 287-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Importantly, the metabolic effects of AMPK activation in cardiomyocytes were paralleled by anti-hypertrophic effects on protein synthesis and reduced expression of maladaptive hypertrophic markers. These data identify AMPK-dependent substrate utilization as a key hypertrophy regulator in cardiac myocytes and give new insights into the link between metabolism and hypertrophy. We conclude that angiotensin II-induced hypertrophy of cardiomyocytes depends on the inhibition of AMPK and changes in substrate utilization to the favor of glucose metabolism. Stimulation of fatty acid oxidation by AMPK activation prevents cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and therefore identifies a novel potential therapeutic target. Whether these observations are of functional significance in vivo has to be tested in further studies. We thank Ellen Becker for excellent technical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W2122726654,"The mammalian biological clock, located in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), imposes its temporal structure on the organism via neural and endocrine outputs. To further investigate SCN control of the autonomic nervous system we focused in the present study on the daily rhythm in plasma glucose concentrations. The hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) is an important target area of biological clock output and harbors the pre-autonomic neurons that control peripheral sympathetic and parasympathetic activity. Using local administration of GABA and glutamate receptor (ant)agonists in the PVN at different times of the light/dark-cycle we investigated whether daily changes in the activity of autonomic nervous system contribute to the control of plasma glucose and plasma insulin concentrations. Activation of neuronal activity in the PVN of non-feeding animals, either by administering a glutamatergic agonist or a GABAergic antagonist, induced hyperglycemia. The effect of the GABA-antagonist was time dependent, causing increased plasma glucose concentrations only when administered during the light period. The absence of a hyperglycemic effect of the GABA-antagonist in SCN-ablated animals provided further evidence for a daily change in GABAergic input from the SCN to the PVN. On the other hand, feeding-induced plasma glucose and insulin responses were suppressed by inhibition of PVN neuronal activity only during the dark period. These results indicate that the pre-autonomic neurons in the PVN are controlled by an interplay of inhibitory and excitatory inputs. Liver-dedicated sympathetic pre-autonomic neurons (responsible for hepatic glucose production) and pancreas-dedicated pre-autonomic parasympathetic neurons (responsible for insulin release) are controlled by inhibitory GABAergic contacts that are mainly active during the light period. Both sympathetic and parasympathetic pre-autonomic PVN neurons also receive excitatory inputs, either from the biological clock (sympathetic pre-autonomic neurons) or from non-clock areas (para-sympathetic pre-autonomic neurons), but the timing information is mainly provided by the GABAergic outputs of the biological clock."
https://openalex.org/W2086131760,"Background Accumulating evidence implicates a fundamental link between the immune system and atherosclerosis. Toll-like receptors are principal sensors of the innate immune system. Here we report an assessment of the role of the TLR2 pathway in atherosclerosis associated with a high-fat diet and/or bacteria in ApoE+/− mice. Methods and Results To explore the role of TLR2 in inflammation- and infection-associated atherosclerosis, 10 week-old ApoE+/−-TLR2+/+, ApoE+/−-TLR2+/− and ApoE+/−-TLR2−/− mice were fed either a high fat diet or a regular chow diet. All mice were inoculated intravenously, once per week for 24 consecutive weeks, with 50 µl live Porphyromonas gingivalis (P.g) (107 CFU) or vehicle (normal saline). Animals were euthanized 24 weeks after the first inoculation. ApoE+/−-TLR2+/+ mice showed a significant increase in atheromatous lesions in proximal aorta and aortic tree compared to ApoE+/−-TLR2+/− and ApoE+/−-TLR2−/− mice for all diet conditions. They also displayed profound changes in plaque composition, as evidenced by increased macrophage infiltration and apoptosis, increased lipid content, and decreased smooth muscle cell mass, all reflecting an unstable plaque phenotype. SAA levels from ApoE+/−-TLR2+/+ mice were significantly higher than from ApoE+/−-TLR2+/− and ApoE+/−-TLR2−/− mice. Serum cytokine analysis revealed increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in ApoE+/−-TLR2+/+ mice compared to ApoE+/−-TLR2+/− and TLR2−/− mice, irrespective of diet or bacterial challenge. ApoE+/−-TLR2+/+ mice injected weekly for 24 weeks with FSL-1 (a TLR2 agonist) also demonstrated significant increases in atherosclerotic lesions, SAA and serum cytokine levels compared to ApoE+/−-TLR2−/− mice under same treatment condition. Finally, mass-spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) of aortic samples analyzed by 2-dimentional gel electrophoresis differential display, identified 6 proteins upregulated greater than 2-fold in ApoE+/−-TLR2+/+ mice fed the high fat diet and inoculated with P.g compared to any other group. Conclusion Genetic deficiency of TLR2 reduces diet- and/or pathogen-associated atherosclerosis in ApoE+/− mice, along with differences in plaque composition suggesting greater structural stability while TLR-2 ligand-specific activation triggers atherosclerosis. The present data offers new insights into the pathophysiological pathways involved in atherosclerosis and paves the way for new pharmacological interventions aimed at reducing atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2016294450,"The huntingtin-interacting protein family members (Hip1 and Hip1R in mammals and Sla2p in yeast) link clathrin-mediated membrane traffic to actin cytoskeleton dynamics. Genetic data in yeast have implicated the light chain subunit of clathrin in regulating this link. To test this hypothesis, the biophysical properties of mammalian Hip1 and Hip1R and their interaction with clathrin light chain and actin were analyzed. The coiled-coil domains (clathrin light chain-binding) of Hip1 and Hip1R were found to be stable homodimers with no propensity to heterodimerize in vitro. Homodimers were also predominant in vivo, accounting for cellular segregation of Hip1 and Hip1R functions. Coiled-coil domains of Hip1 and Hip1R differed in their stability and flexibility, correlating with slightly different affinities for clathrin light chain and more markedly with effects of clathrin light chain binding on Hip protein-actin interactions. Clathrin light chain binding induced a compact conformation of both Hip1 and Hip1R and significantly reduced actin binding by their THATCH domains. Thus, clathrin is a negative regulator of Hip-actin interactions. These observations necessarily change models proposed for Hip protein function.

Extensive heterodimerization seems unlikely, since it would mix the functions of Hip1 and Hip1R, which are distinct in cells, and genetic deletion of each protein produces a markedly different phenotype (10Bradley S.V.

To understand the molecular basis for the functions of Hip1 and Hip1R, the biophysical properties of the coiled-coil domains were analyzed with respect to their self-association and their intramolecular influence on actin binding. Clathrin-coated vesicles mediate major membrane traffic pathways, including receptor-mediated endocytosis and protein sorting, during lysosome biogenesis (12Brodsky F.M. Chen C.Y. Knuehl C. Towler M.C. Wakeham D.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 517-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Clathrin is a triskelion-shaped molecule made up of three heavy chains and three light chains, which polymerizes to form a lattice-like vesicle coat that organizes cargo and proteins that control vesicle budding (12Brodsky F.M.

In both mammalian and yeast cells, clathrin-coated vesicle budding also involves actin polymerization (1Engqvist-Goldstein A.E. Drubin D.G. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1503-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, overexpression of the Hip protein-binding region of clathrin light chain causes an alteration in actin cytoskeleton structure, generating short actin protrusions tipped with cortactin (4Chen C.Y. Brodsky F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6109-6117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The complex of Hip1R and cortactin has been shown to slow or block actin assembly and is proposed to mediate the positioning of actin assembly on a budding vesicle (17Le Clainche C. Pauly B.S. Zhang C.X. Engqvist-Goldstein A.E. Cunningham K. Drubin D.G. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 1199-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In yeast cells that are deficient in clathrin heavy chain, clathrin light chain can rescue the mobility of membrane patches containing Sla2p, the yeast homolog of Hip1 and Hip1R (18Newpher T.M. Idrissi F.Z. Geli M.I. Lemmon S.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4343-4352Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Regulation of Sla2p-actin binding by clathrin light chain was proposed to mediate this rescue (18Newpher T.M. Idrissi F.Z. Geli M.I. Lemmon S.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4343-4352Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Intramolecular regulation of actin binding by the Hip1 and Hip1R THATCH domains has also been shown (19Senetar M.A. Foster S.J. McCann R.O. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 15418-15428Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 20Brett T.J. Legendre-Guillemin V. McPherson P.S. Fremont D.H. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Here we address how intramolecular mechanisms regulating actin binding by Hip proteins are related to the influence of clathrin light chains on Hip-actin interactions. Many cellular functions of Hip1 and Hip1R are linked to their coiled-coil domains. Dimerization occurs through the coiled-coil, as does binding to clathrin light chain (4Chen C.Y. Brodsky F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6109-6117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 3Legendre-Guillemin V. Metzler M. Lemaire J.F. Philie J. Gan L. Hayden M.R. McPherson P.S. J. Biol.

Coiled-coils have a canonical heptad repeat that allows the coils to wrap around each other and maintain a hydrophobic core (22Burkhard P. Stetefeld J. Strelkov S.V. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 82-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). Changes within the heptad repeat of coiled-coils often signify a region of flexibility where protein partners bind and can potentiate conformational change (22Burkhard P. Stetefeld J. Strelkov S.V.

Hip1 and Hip1R coiled-coils have high similarity to each other at the primary sequence level and have virtually identical regions important for clathrin light chain binding (3Legendre-Guillemin V.

Helms S. Nix J. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 367: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The structures of fragments of the Hip1 coiled-coil showed irregularity in the heptad repeat, including the region where a hydrophobic patch predicted to bind clathrin light chain was located (21Ybe J.A. Mishra S. Helms S. Nix J. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 367: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 26Niu Q. Ybe J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 375: 1197-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Also, these structures showed a split in the coiled-coil, suggesting increased flexibility in the clathrin light chain-binding region (21Ybe J.A. Mishra S. Helms S. Nix J. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 367: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 26Niu Q. Ybe J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 375: 1197-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), with potential for structural changes upon ligand binding. To understand the mechanism of their functional importance, the biophysical properties of the coiled-coil domains of Hip1 and Hip1R were quantitatively analyzed. These domains showed strong homodimerization, regions of flexibility, and the ability to induce conformational changes upon clathrin light chain binding, which dramatically reduced actin affinity for the THATCH domains. These biophysical properties of Hip proteins provide a basis for understanding Hip1 and Hip1R functions in cells and for understanding the regulatory effect of clathrin light chain on Hip protein-actin interaction in endocytosis. Our findings further suggest a model for the sequential function of clathrin and actin in coated vesicle budding. Expression Constructs and Peptides—Separate domains of either human Hip1 or mouse Hip1R were cloned. The coiled-coil of Hip1 (Hip1cc), corresponding to amino acids 361-637; Hip1R coiled-coil (Hip1Rcc), corresponding to amino acids 346-655; Hip1 coiled-coil and THATCH (Hip1ccth), corresponding to amino acids 400-1038; Hip1R coiled-coil and THATCH (Hip1Rccth), corresponding to amino acids 379-1068; Hip1 THATCH (Hip1th), corresponding to amino acids 600-1038; and Hip1R THATCH (Hip1Rth), corresponding to amino acids 600-1068, were cloned via PCR amplification of gene fragments with flanking Gateway (Invitrogen) recombination sequences and inserted into pRSF-duet (Novagen) or pET-duet plasmid (Novagen) modified with Gateway sequences. Full-length Hip1 or Hip1R were amplified by PCR with primers containing either the polyhistidine (His) 2The abbreviations used are: His, polyhistidine; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; siRNA, small interfering RNA; ANS, 8-anilino-1-napthalenesulfonic acid; NSF, N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor; SPR, surface plasmon resonance. tag or hemagglutinin (HA) tag sequence and cloned into the pCDNA3.1 plasmid (Invitrogen). Clathrin light chain LCb was expressed from a previously described construct (27Liu S.H. Wong M.L. Craik C.S. Brodsky F.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 257-267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Cortactin Src homology 3 domain fused with glutathione S-transferase (GST) was expressed and purified as previously described (17Le Clainche C. Pauly B.S. Zhang C.X. Engqvist-Goldstein A.E. Cunningham K. Drubin D.G. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 1199-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). A peptide representing the consensus sequence of clathrin light chains (EEDPAAAFLAQQESEIAGIEND) was synthesized commercially. Control peptides of the same length were either the clathrin light chain peptide with three previously described point mutations (underlined) that abrogate Hip1R binding (4Chen C.Y. Brodsky F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6109-6117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) (EEVPAAAFLAQQESEAAGIAND) or unrelated peptide (FINKPETGAVELESPFILLADKKI) derived from the bacterial protein GroEL. Protein Expression and Purification—For all proteins, BL21 (DE3) Escherichia coli were transformed with the appropriate plasmid, and expression was induced via standard methods. Purification was via standard methods using Talon affinity resin (all Hip protein constructs) or glutathione-Sepharose (GST-cortactin). All Hip protein constructs were further purified over a Superdex 200 column. See supplemental materials for details. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Hip1cc or Hip1Rcc was placed in a six-channel cell at 1 mg/ml. Concentration filtrate was used for reference cells. Protein was centrifuged at four speeds, 8,000, 10,000, 15,000, and 20,000 rpm, in an AN Ti60 rotor in a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge. Data were collected after 8 h of spinning to equilibrium via absorption optics and analyzed using Ultrascan 9.0 (28Demeler B. Scott D.J. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Modern Analytical Ultracentrifugation: Techniques and Methods. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge2005Google Scholar). Equilibrium data were globally fitted to a monomer-dimer equilibrium or single species of either the calculated monomer or dimer size. Circular Dichroism—CD spectra were collected using a Jasco J-710 spectrapolarimeter. Hip1cc and Hip1Rcc were diluted in 20 mm phosphate, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl to a concentration of 0.035 mg/ml and 0.036 mg/ml, respectively. Individual melting analysis for Hip1cc and Hip1Rcc was performed starting at 22 °C and increasing to 80 °C while monitoring ellipticity at 222 nm. The rate of heating was 0.5 °C/min. For melting of the mixture of Hip1cc and Hip1Rcc the rate of heating was 1 °C/min. Annealing time for the mixture of Hip1cc and Hip1Rcc was between 45 min and 1 h, until the ellipticity at 222 nm was back to the starting base line. Data were collected and analyzed to 65 °C, well past the major melting transitions of both Hip1cc and Hip1Rcc, which should include dimer unfolding. The data were plotted as the mean residue molar ellipticity. Surface Plasmon Resonance—Clathrin light chain surface was prepared by immobilizing ∼400 response units of protein via amine coupling to a CM5 chip (Biacore). For binding experiments, either Hip1cc or Hip1Rcc was flowed at the concentrations indicated in Fig. 5 with MES, pH 6.7, running buffer. The actin surface was prepared by immobilizing ∼1000 response units of rabbit muscle F-actin to the chip surface via amine coupling. Hip1ccth or Hip1Rccth at the indicated concentrations (Fig. 5) and with or without 20 μm clathrin light chain peptide or control peptide were flowed over the surface in 20 mm Tris pH 8.0, 1 mm MgCl2, 150 mm KCl running buffer. GST-cortactin was immobilized with an anti-GST antibody (Biacore), and Hip1Rccth at the indicated concentrations was flowed over (Fig. S5). Running buffer was HBS-EP (Biacore). All protein concentrations were determined in at least duplicate to ensure accurate concentrations. All data were collected on a Biacore T100 biosensor at 25 °C. Steady state binding analysis was performed using BiaEvaluation software (Biacore). Partial Proteolysis—12.5 μg of HIP1 or HIP1R in gel filtration buffer was mixed with 0.01 μg/ml pure subtilisin (Roche Applied Science) in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 200 mm NaCl. Incubation times are as shown in the figures. At each time point, 20 μl of protein was taken, and the proteolysis reaction was stopped by mixing with SDS gel loading buffer and boiling. Proteolysis products were resolved on a 12% SDS NuPAGE gel in MES running buffer (Invitrogen). Mass Spectrometry—Spectra of tryptic fragments excised from gels were taken on a Voyager-DE STR spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) in reflector mode. See supplemental materials for details. Spectra were processed and analyzed using the Data Explorer program (Applied Biosystems). Peptide peaks were identified using MS-Fit and MS-Digest within the Protein Prospector suite. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—HeLa cells were co-transfected with HA- or His-tagged full-length Hip1 and Hip1R using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). DNA concentrations used for transfection were adjusted to yield equal levels of tagged protein expression (Fig. 2) or a 4-fold excess of one tagged protein over the other (Fig. S1). Immunoprecipitation (5 μg of each antibody) and immunoblotting were with either His6 monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences) or HA.11 monoclonal antibody (Covance) using standard methods. Immunoblotting for clathrin light chain was with a previously described anti-serum against a conserved region of LCa and LCb (29Acton S.L. Wong D.H. Parham P. Brodsky F.M. Jackson A.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 647-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For details, see the supplemental materials. Immunofluorescence and siRNA Depletion—HeLa cells cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% bovine growth serum (Hyclone) were transfected with a final concentration of 10 nm siRNA targeted to clathrin light chain or control siRNA using the HiPerfect reagent (Qiagen). Target sequences for LCa and LCb knockdown were as described (30Huang F. Khvorova A. Marshall W. Sorkin A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16657-16661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Both control and the clathrin light chain siRNAs were synthesized by Qiagen. Cells were fixed and labeled for immunofluorescence 72 h post-siRNA treatment using rabbit anti-Hip1R antiserum (Millipore), monoclonal antibody to clathrin heavy chain (X22, (31Brodsky F.M. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 2047-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar)), and Alexa Fluor-conjugated phalloidin (Invitrogen) to visualize F-actin. The samples were viewed by confocal laser-scanning microscopy using a Leica TCS-SP5 operating system. Electron Microscopy—5 μl of 0.2 μm purified Hip1ccth or Hip1Rccth incubated with 20 μm control peptide, clathrin light chain peptide, or no peptide was dropped on a carbon-coated grid and stained with uranyl formate. Samples were imaged at ×67,000 using a Philips Tecnai T20 electron microscope operated at an acceleration voltage of 120 kV with a defocus range of 1.2-1.5 μm. Images were taken using a 4K × 4K CCD (GATAN) with a pixel size of 2.25 Å/pixel. Images were selected and measured using EMAN. 8-Anilino-1-napthalenesulfonic Acid (ANS) Fluorescence—0.7 μm purified Hip coiled-coils or coiled-coil THATCH domains were incubated with 20 μm clathrin light chain peptide or control peptide and 100 μm ANS. Excitation of ANS was at 360 nm, and emission was scanned from 400 to 600 nm. Raw data were averaged over three independent experiments, and S.E. values were calculated for each condition. Difference spectra of Hip coiled-coil THATCH and Hip coiled-coils were plotted with propagated S.E. Hip1 and Hip1R Are Stable Homodimers—Homodimers of Hip1R have an elongated dumbbell shape, with the N- and C-terminal globular domains in variable positions (32Engqvist-Goldstein A.E. Warren R.A. Kessels M.M. Keen J.H. Heuser J. Drubin D.G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 1209-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). This implies the primary dimerization determinants are within the coiled-coil domain. Interactions between Hip1 and Hip1R have been shown by GST pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation (2Legendre-Guillemin V. Metzler M. Charbonneau M. Gan L. Chopra V. Philie J. Hayden M.R. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19897-19904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Whether this interaction arises from direct heterodimerization or another mode of interaction has yet to be explicitly determined and would have different functional implications. Coiled-coil domains (Hip1 residues 361-637 and Hip1R residues 346-655; Fig. 1) from Hip proteins were expressed and purified, and their dimerization properties were analyzed by equilibrium sedimentation analytical ultracentrifugation (Table 1). Assuming a monomer-dimer equilibrium model, the data analysis suggested that there was no equilibrium under standard conditions and that all of the coiled-coils for both Hip1 and Hip1R are dimeric in solution. The fitted molecular masses were 67.4 and 67.7 kDa for the Hip1 and Hip1R coiled-coils, respectively, corresponding closely to calculated homodimeric sizes of 66.79 and 73.45 kDa (Table 1). Fitting the sedimentation data to a single species with the calculated molecular weight of the dimers (data not shown) also fit well with the experimental data. Attempts to fit the sedimentation data to the true calculated size of the monomer, as either a single species or as a monomer-dimer equilibrium, resulted in poor fits (data not shown). These data indicate that homodimers of Hip1 and Hip1R are stable and that there is virtually no dissociation to the monomer form of these proteins in vitro.TABLE 1Hip coiled-coil molecular mass determined by analytical ultracentrifugation fitted to monomer-dimer equilibrium modelProteinCalculated dimer molecular massCalculated monomer molecular massExperimental molecular massFitting variancekDakDakDaHip1cc66.7933.3967.42.51 × 10−5Hip1Rcc73.4536.7367.72.57 × 10−5 Open table in a new tab This stability was also evident from biochemical treatments. Dimers of purified Hip1 and Hip1R coiled-coils survived standard denaturing, reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 2A). Coiled-coil domains of Hip1 and Hip1R were mixed with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and heated to 95 °C for increasing time intervals (Fig. 2A). After only short heating times, large amounts of Hip1 or Hip1R coiled-coils remained complexed. This SDS-resistant behavior is similar to that of the four-helix bundles of SNARE proteins that require an ATP-hydrolyzing chaperone, N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor (NSF) to dissociate the complex (33Chen Y.A. Scales S.J. Patel S.M. Doung Y.C. Scheller R.H. Cell. 1999; 97: 165-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Although both Hip1 and Hip1R coiled-coils were very stable, Hip1 remained a dimer for longer heating times (Fig. 2A). Given the high stability of the coiled-coil domains of Hip1 and Hip1R, it is likely that homodimers are the preferred mode of interaction. To test the possibility of heterodimerization in a stringent way, a 1:1 mixture of Hip1 and Hip1R coiled-coils was thermally denatured through their primary melting transition to 65 °C while monitoring the melting transition by circular dichroism (Fig. 2B). The denatured mixture was then allowed to slowly reanneal. Melting and annealing should overcome any thermodynamic or kinetic barrier to monomer formation and allow heterodimers to form during reannealing if feasible. Following reannealing, thermal denaturation of the resulting molecules was measured, and the melting curve was identical to that of the mixture of the Hip1 and Hip1R coiled-coil homodimers (Fig. 2B). Thus, no new stable heterodimers had formed upon reannealing. These would have generated a melting curve that deviated from that of the original mixture because the heterodimers would contribute differently to the shape of the melting curve. These biophysical results indicate there is no heterodimerization of Hip1 and Hip1R through their coiled-coil domains in vitro. To follow up the biophysical analysis in a cellular context, four constructs encoding full-length HA- or His-tagged Hip1 and Hip1R were produced and expressed in HeLa cells (Fig. 2C). After co-transfection of Hip1 and Hip1R, each with a different tag (in either combination), immunoprecipitation of either Hip1 or Hip1R gave negligible amounts of the other protein. However, when Hip1 constructs with two different tags or Hip1R constructs with two different tags were transfected into cells, homotypic interactions were readily detected by immunoprecipitation. Varying the expression level of each construct relative to the other did not change this result (Fig. S1). Our biochemical analysis and its correlation with cellular data thus suggest that the preferred mode of Hip protein interaction in vivo and in vitro is homodimeric. These results are compatible with reported functional segregation of Hip1 and Hip1R in cells (10Bradley S.V. Hyun T.S. Oravecz-Wilson K.I. Li L. Waldorff E.I. Ermilov A.N. Goldstein S.A. Zhang C.X.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3254-3266Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Flexibility Is a Mechanism for Conformational Regulation in Hip1 and Hip1R—Given the preference for homodimerization and the segregation of biological functions of Hip1 and Hip1R, further biophysical properties of their coiled-coil domains were analyzed to determine whether these might account for functional differences. Separate crystallographic analyses of the N- and C-terminal halves of the coiled-coil domain of Hip1 showed classical coiled-coil segments from residues 371-430 and from residues 540-581. These structures also suggested a segment, around residues 445-539, of decreased stability and increased flexibility that included residues implicated in binding clathrin light chain as well as in binding of HIPPI (Hip1 protein interactor) (21Ybe J.A. Mishra S. Helms S. Nix J. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 367: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). To investigate whether this region might function in regulatory aspects of the Hip proteins, biophysical properties related to stability of the Hip protein coiled-coil domains were analyzed. First, using the program COILS (34Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3460) Google Scholar), subdomains of high and low coiled-coil propensity were mapped within the coiled-coil domains of both Hip1 and Hip1R (Fig. 3, A and B). COILS suggested that both domains have N-terminal regions with high propensity to form coils. At the (D/E"
https://openalex.org/W2054947871,"Background Despite the considerable progress made in understanding the molecular bases of mitochondrial diseases, no effective treatments have been developed to date. Faithful animal models would be extremely helpful for designing such treatments. We showed previously that the Harlequin mouse phenotype was due to a specific mitochondrial complex I deficiency resulting from the loss of the Apoptosis Inducing Factor (Aif) protein. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we conducted a detailed evaluation of the Harlequin mouse phenotype, including the biochemical abnormalities in various tissues. We observed highly variable disease expression considering both severity and time course progression. In each tissue, abnormalities correlated with the residual amount of the respiratory chain complex I 20 kDa subunit, rather than with residual Aif protein. Antioxidant enzyme activities were normal except in skeletal muscle, where they were moderately elevated. Conclusions/Significance Thus, the Harlequin mouse phenotype appears to result from mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I deficiency. Its features resemble those of human complex I deficiency syndromes. The Harlequin mouse holds promise as a model for developing treatments for complex I deficiency syndromes."
https://openalex.org/W2038034173,"Calorie restriction (CR) produces several health benefits and increases lifespan in many species. Studies suggest that alternate-day fasting (ADF) and exercise can also provide these benefits. Whether CR results in lifespan extension in humans is not known and a direct investigation is not feasible. However, phenotypes observed in CR animals when compared to ad libitum fed (AL) animals, including increased stress resistance and changes in protein expression, can be simulated in cells cultured with media supplemented with blood serum from CR and AL animals. Two pilot studies were undertaken to examine the effects of ADF and CR on indicators of health and longevity in humans. In this study, we used sera collected from those studies to culture human hepatoma cells and assessed the effects on growth, stress resistance and gene expression. Cells cultured in serum collected at the end of the dieting period were compared to cells cultured in serum collected at baseline (before the dieting period). Cells cultured in serum from ADF participants, showed a 20% increase in Sirt1 protein which correlated with reduced triglyceride levels. ADF serum also induced a 9% decrease in proliferation and a 25% increase in heat resistance. Cells cultured in serum from CR participants induced an increase in Sirt1 protein levels by 17% and a 30% increase in PGC-1α mRNA levels. This first in vitro study utilizing human serum to examine effects on markers of health and longevity in cultured cells resulted in increased stress resistance and an up-regulation of genes proposed to be indicators of increased longevity.

https://openalex.org/W2026739290,"Bone marrow cells induce stable mixed chimerism under appropriate conditioning of the host, mediating the induction of transplantation tolerance. However, their strong immunogenicity precludes routine use in clinical transplantation due to the need for harsh preconditioning and the requirement for toxic immunosuppression to prevent rejection and graft-versus-host disease. Alternatively, embryonic stem (ES) cells have emerged as a potential source of less immunogenic hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs). Up till now, however, it has been difficult to generate stable hematopoietic cells from ES cells.Here, we derived CD45(+) HPCs from HOXB4-transduced ES cells and showed that they poorly express MHC antigens. This property allowed their long-term engraftment in sublethally irradiated recipients across MHC barriers without the need for immunosuppressive agents. Although donor cells declined in peripheral blood over 2 months, low level chimerism was maintained in the bone marrow of these mice over 100 days. More importantly, chimeric animals were protected from rejection of donor-type cardiac allografts.Our data show, for the first time, the efficacy of ES-derived CD45(+) HPCs to engraft in allogenic recipients without the use of immunosuppressive agents, there by protecting cardiac allografts from rejection."
https://openalex.org/W2062607238,"Background The high mortality impact of infectious diseases will increase due to accelerated evolution of antibiotic resistance in important human pathogens. Development of antibiotic resistance is a evolutionary process inducing the erosion of the effectiveness of our arsenal of antibiotics. Resistance is not necessarily limited to a single class of antibacterial agents but may affect many unrelated compounds; this is termed ‘multidrug resistance’ (MDR). The major mechanism of MDR is the active expulsion of drugs by bacterial pumps; the treatment of Gram negative bacterial infections is compromised due to resistance mechanisms including the expression of efflux pumps that actively expel various usual antibiotics (ß-lactams, quinolones, …). Methodology/Principal Findings Enterobacter aerogenes has emerged among Enterobacteriaceae associated hospital infections during the last twenty years due to its faculty of adaptation to antibiotic stresses. Clinical isolates of E. aerogenes belonging to two strain collections isolated in 1995 and 2003 respectively, were screened to assess the involvement of efflux pumps in antibiotic resistance. Drug susceptibility assays were performed on all bacterial isolates and an efflux pump inhibitor (PAßN) previously characterized allowed to decipher the role of efflux in the resistance. Accumulation of labelled chloramphenicol was monitored in the presence of an energy poison to determine the involvement of active efflux on the antibiotic intracellular concentrations. The presence of the PAßN-susceptible efflux system was also identified in resistant E. aerogenes strains. Conclusions/Significance For the first time a noticeable increase in clinical isolates containing an efflux mechanism susceptible to pump inhibitor is report within an 8 year period. After the emergence of extended spectrum ß-lactamases in E. aerogenes and the recent characterisation of porin mutations in clinical isolates, this study describing an increase in inhibitor-susceptible efflux throws light on a new step in the evolution of mechanism in E. aerogenes."
https://openalex.org/W1981368434,"Two parallel interleukin-1 (IL-1)-mediated signaling pathways have been uncovered for IL-1R-TLR-mediated NFkappaB activation: TAK1-dependent and MEKK3-dependent pathways, respectively. The TAK1-dependent pathway leads to IKKalpha/beta phosphorylation and IKKbeta activation, resulting in classic NFkappaB activation through IkappaBalpha phosphorylation and degradation. The TAK1-independent MEKK3-dependent pathway involves IKKgamma phosphorylation and IKKalpha activation, resulting in NFkappaB activation through dissociation of phosphorylated IkappaBalpha from NFkappaB without IkappaBalpha degradation. IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK4) belongs to the IRAK family of proteins and plays a critical role in IL-1R/TLR-mediated signaling. IRAK4 kinase-inactive mutant failed to mediate the IL-1R-TLR-induced TAK1-dependent NFkappaB activation pathway, but mediated IL-1-induced TAK1-independent NFkappaB activation and retained the ability to activate substantial gene expression, indicating a structural role of IRAK4 in mediating this alternative NFkappaB activation pathway. Deletion analysis of IRAK4 indicates the essential structural role of the IRAK4 death domain in receptor proximal signaling for mediating IL-1R-TLR-induced NFkappaB activation."
https://openalex.org/W2020701492,"Cardiac myocyte intracellular calcium varies beat-to-beat and calmodulin (CaM) transduces Ca2+ signals to regulate many cellular processes (e.g. via CaM targets such as CaM-dependent kinase and calcineurin). However, little is known about the dynamics of how CaM targets process the Ca2+ signals to generate appropriate biological responses in the heart. We hypothesized that the different affinities of CaM targets for the Ca2+-bound CaM (Ca2+-CaM) shape their actions through dynamic and tonic interactions in response to the repetitive Ca2+ signals in myocytes. To test our hypothesis, we used two fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based biosensors, BsCaM-45 (Kd = approximately 45 nm) and BsCaM-2 (Kd = approximately 2 nm), to monitor the real time Ca2+-CaM dynamics at low and high affinity CaM targets in paced adult ventricular myocytes. Compared with BsCaM-2, BsCaM-45 tracks the beat-to-beat Ca2+-CaM alterations more closely following the Ca2+ oscillations at each myocyte contraction. When pacing frequency is raised from 0.1 to 1.0 Hz, the higher affinity BsCaM-2 demonstrates significant elevation of diastolic Ca2+-CaM binding compared with the lower affinity BsCaM-45. Biochemically detailed computational models of Ca2+-CaM biosensors in beating cardiac myocytes revealed that the different Ca2+-CaM binding affinities of BsCaM-2 and BsCaM-45 are sufficient to predict their differing kinetics and diastolic integration. Thus, data from both experiments and computational modeling suggest that CaM targets with low versus high Ca2+-CaM affinities (like CaM-dependent kinase versus calcineurin) respond differentially to the same Ca2+ signal (phasic versus integrating), presumably tuned appropriately for their respective and distinct Ca2+ signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2049509883,"The Drosophila Spätzle protein, involved in the embryonic development of the dorsal-ventral axis and in the adult immune response, is expressed as a proprotein and is activated by the serine proteinases Easter or Spätzle-processing enzyme. Proteolytic cleavage generates a 106-amino acid COOH-terminal fragment, C106, homologous to the mature form of nerve growth factor NGF, a cystine knot protein. Through alternative splicing, the Spätzle gene encodes for several isoforms that (with one exception, the “propeptide isoform”) share C106 but differ in the prosequence. Three isoforms have been expressed recombinantly in Escherichia coli strains. The propeptide isoform could be expressed in soluble form and is unstructured according to CD and NMR measurements. Dimeric full-length Spätzle isoforms have been refolded from insoluble inclusion bodies and are able to rescue Spätzle-deficient embryos. Although the two full-length isoforms exhibit similar far-UV CD spectra, large differences in tryptophan fluorescence quenching by the respective pro-parts are observed. Both full-length isoforms exhibited highly cooperative folding transitions. Proteolytic digestion using trypsin resulted in C106, whose unfolding exhibits lower thermodynamic stability and cooperativity compared with the full-length proteins. The structure of C106 reveals a T-shaped dimer with significant differences to NGF and a deep internal cavity. Substantial β-sheet formation is observed between the two monomers, whereas a long loop containing the single tryptophan residue is disordered in the crystals.

Our results suggest that the propeptides stabilize the tertiary structure of the “mature” Spätzle cystine knot. The Spätzle protein is the precursor of a nerve growth factor-like ligand in Drosophila melanogaster (1Stein D. Roth S. Vogelsang E. Nüsslein-Volhard C. Cell. 1991; 65: 725-735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). It defines the dorsal-ventral axis in Drosophila embryos and acts in the initiation of immune response to fungal and bacterial infection in adult flies (2Hoffmann J.A.

Extracellular binding of mature Spätzle to its receptor Toll is thought to lead to receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation of the cytoplasmic Toll/interleukin-1 receptor domains (4Weber A.N.R. Tauszig-Delamasure S. Hoffmann J.A. Lelievre E. Gascan H. Ray K.P. Morse M.A. Imler J.-L. Gay N.J. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 794-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 5Weber A.N.R.

Although Toll is distributed uniformly within the embryonic perivittelline membrane, a concentration gradient of Spätzle results in dorsal-ventral asymmetry. The extracellular domain of the transmembrane receptor Toll consists of two leucine-rich repeat domains that bind the ligand. The cytoplasmic domain of Toll shares sequence similarity with the vertebrate Toll-like receptors, such as interleukin-1 receptor (6Schneider D.S. Jin Y. Morisato D. Anderson K.V. Development. 1994; 120: 1243-1250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Gay N.J. Keith F.J. Nature. 1991; 351: 355-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar), also involved in innate immunity. Activation of Spätzle proceeds via one of two extracellular proteolytic cascades. In the developmental pathway, Spätzle is activated by Easter, generating a 12-kDa COOH-terminal fragment, C106, that is capable of activating Toll and thereby initiating a gradient of the transcription factor Dorsal, resulting in dorsal-ventral differentiation. In the innate immune response, however, full-length dimeric Spätzle is activated by the Spätzle-processing enzyme (SPE) (8Jang I.-H. Chosa N. Kim S.-H. Nam H.-J. Lemaitre B. Ochiai M. Kambris Z. Brun S. Hashimoto C. Ashida M. Brey P.T. Lee W.-J. Dev. Cell. 2006; 10: 45-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), ending ultimately with the production of the antibiotic Drosomycin. SPE is activated by the serine proteinase Spirit, which in turn is activated by either Grass (Gram-positive bacterial infection) or Persephone (fungal infection) (9Kambris Z. Brun S. Jang I.-H. Nam H.-J. Romeo Y. Takahashi K. Lee W.-J. Ueda R. Lemaitre B. Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 808-813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The Spätzle gene encodes several proteins, ranging in size from 20 to 70 kDa, that are secreted in the perivitelline space of Drosophila embryos. Alternative splicing generates different pre-pro isoforms (10DeLotto Y. Smith C.L. DeLotto R. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2001; 264: 643-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 11Parker J.S. Mizuguchi K. Gay N.J. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2001; 45: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) that share the signal sequence, Easter/SPE cleavage site, and NGF-like domain. The majority of the isoforms, which vary only in their propeptide regions, are expressed during early stages of Drosophila embryogenesis (11Parker J.S. Mizuguchi K. Gay N.J. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2001; 45: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 12DeLotto Y. DeLotto R. Mech. Dev. 1998; 72: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Although the COOH-terminal NGF-like domain is thought to adopt a cystine knot fold, the precise role and nature of the NH2-terminal propeptide is unclear. It has been variously suggested that the NH2-terminal domain is natively unfolded (4Weber A.N.R. Tauszig-Delamasure S. Hoffmann J.A. Lelievre E. Gascan H. Ray K.P. Morse M.A. Imler J.-L. Gay N.J. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 794-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), has a regulatory effect on Easter (13Moussian B. Roth S. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: R887-R899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), and remains bound to the cystine knot domain following activation cleavage (14Weber A.N.R. Gangloff M.

Here we report the successful production and structural investigation of recombinantly expressed Spätzle from Drosophila melanogaster. We have focused our experiments on the biophysical characterization of three representative Spätzle isoforms, Spz11.7, Spz8.19, and Spz8.24 (Fig. 1) (10DeLotto Y. Smith C.L. DeLotto R. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2001; 264: 643-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Previous experiments involving mRNA injection into Spätzle-deficient embryos revealed that only Spz11.7, Spz8.19, and Spz11.15 are able to result in hatched larvae (10DeLotto Y. Smith C.L. DeLotto R. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2001; 264: 643-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These isoforms, potentially glycosylated in vivo, share the signal sequence, the Easter/SPE processing site, and the COOH-terminal NGF-like domain, yet differ in the exon composition of the prodomain. The COOH-terminal NGF-like domain, also called the cystine knot domain, contains seven cysteines per monomer, six of which connect to form the cystine knot, whereas the seventh is presumed to be involved in dimerization via intermolecular disulfide formation (3Mizuguchi K. Parker J.S. Blundell T.L. Gay N.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 239-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 12DeLotto Y. DeLotto R. Mech. Dev. 1998; 72: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Two additional cysteines are found in the prodomain with unknown connectivity. Spz8.24 has a compromised functionality in Drosophila development (10DeLotto Y. Smith C.L. DeLotto R. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2001; 264: 643-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar); due to a frameshift, the Spz8.24 transcript is terminated before the Easter or SPE cleavage site and therefore possesses no cystine knot domain. Spz8.24 thus consists predominantly of the prodomain and serves in this work as a model for the propeptide. The three naturally occurring Spätzle isoforms have been expressed in Escherichia coli, two of which (Spz11.7 and Spz8.19) could be produced in large amounts as insoluble inclusion bodies. Protocols have been established to allow efficient refolding and purification of the isoforms. Activity of the folded species has been confirmed by microinjection into Drosophila embryos. Activation of the full-length isoforms Spz11.7 and Spz8.19 by limited trypsin digestion allowed comparison between the full-length forms and the cystine knot domain C106 alone. Biophysical and thermodynamic analyses using far-UV CD, fluorescence, and NMR spectroscopy reveal a stabilization of C106 by the propeptide, which itself is unstructured in isolation, in the context of the full-length protein. These results are corroborated by the x-ray crystal structure of C106 presented here. Expression Vectors, Constructs, and Strains—Spätzle cDNAs, kindly provided by Dr. Robert DeLotto, were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the following primers: Spz11.7, 5′-GGC AAG CAT ATG AAG GAG TAC GAA CGT ATC ATC-3′ (forward) and 5′-AAA CTC GAG CCC AGT CTT CAA CGC GCA CTT-3′ (reverse); Spz8.19, 5′-GGC AAG CAT ATG AAG GAG TAC GAA CGT ATC ATC-3′ (forward) and 5′-AAA GGATCC TCA CCC AGT CTT CAA CGC GCA CTT-3′ (reverse); and Spz8.24, 5′-GGC AAG CAT ATG ACG TCC GCG GAC AGT GCA CCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-AAT GGATCC TTA TTG ACA ATT AAC TGC CAG GTG TCG-3′ (reverse). Spz11.7 was cloned into the pET21a vector (COOH-terminal His6 tag; Novagen) using restriction sites NdeI/XhoI, and Spz8.19 and Spz8.24 were cloned into the pET15b vector (NH2-terminal His6 tag) using restriction sites NdeI/BamHI. Positive vectors were sequenced and transformed in Ca2+-competent E. coli cells. Spätzle isoforms were expressed in E. coli strains BL21 (DE3), BL21 pUBS (DE3), and Rosetta (DE3) (Novagen). Recombinant Protein Expression—Test expressions were carried out in 250-ml shake flasks with 50 ml of lysogenic broth medium at 37 °C and 125 rpm. Cultures were induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside at A600 of ∼0.5, and proteins were expressed for 4 h. For purification strategy development, larger amounts were produced under the same conditions in 5-liter shake flasks with 1.5 liters of lysogenic broth medium. Large scale expression was carried out in bioreactors with an 8-liter working volume and temperature and oxygen control in yeast extract medium. After inoculation, the cultures were fed with yeast extract and glucose starting at A600 of ∼10 and induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside at A600 of ∼50. Cells were harvested 4 h after induction by centrifugation and stored at −80 °C. Inclusion Body Purification and Solubilization—After thawing, cells were resuspended in 0.1 m Tris/HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0, buffer and disrupted by high pressure using a French press (Gaulin). Bacterial DNA was removed by digestion with Benzonase (Sigma) for 30 min at 4 °C. A buffer of 6% Triton X-100, 60 mm EDTA, 1.5 m NaCl was added at a ratio of 1:2 (v/v), and the solution was centrifuged for 10 min at 31,000 × g to clarify the solution. The pelleted inclusion bodies were resuspended in 0.1 m Tris/HCl, 20 mm EDTA, pH 7.0, buffer and centrifuged a second time. The last step was repeated three times until no further soluble protein was washed out. Subsequently, the inclusion bodies were solubilized in 6 m guanidinium hydrochloride (GdnHCl), 0.1 m Tris/HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, buffer with fresh 100 mm dithiothreitol. After shifting the pH to 4, the protein was dialyzed against 4 m GdnHCl, 10 mm EDTA, pH 4.0 (15Rudolph R. Lilie H. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). In Vitro Folding—The solubilized inclusion bodies were rapidly diluted between 1:200 and 1:300 to filtered, degassed, and chilled folding buffer at 8 °C to a concentration of 150 mg/liter and renatured for at least 48 h. Two folding buffers were developed: either 1 m l-arginine, 0.1 m Tris/HCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm GSSG, 5 mm GSH, pH 8.5, or 1 m Tris/HCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm GSSG, 5 mm GSH, pH 9.5. After in vitro folding, the protein solution was concentrated 10-fold by cross-flow filtration (Vivaflow). The folding buffer additives l-arginine and the oxido shuffling system were removed by dialysis against 0.1 m Tris/HCl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4 (15Rudolph R. Lilie H. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar, 16Rattenholl A. Ruoppolo M. Flagiello A. Monti M. Vinci F. Marino G. Lilie H. Schwarz E. Rudolph R. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 523-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Purification—The full-length isoforms were purified further by size exclusion chromatography with a Superdex 75 or 200 preparation grade column (GE Healthcare) in 20 mm Tris/HCl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4. The solubly expressed propeptide isoform Spz8.24 was purified by affinity, ionic exchange, and size exclusion chromatography. Affinity chromatography using an Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid matrix (GE Healthcare) was performed in 0.1 m Tris/HCl, 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, binding buffer with stepwise elution up to 500 mm imidazole. For the ion exchange step, a HiTrap SP FF column (GE Healthcare) with 50 mm sodium citrate, 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 5.5, was used. Elution was achieved using a 20 column volume gradient to 1 m NaCl. The final size exclusion step was carried out as for the full-length isoforms. Limited Proteolysis by Trypsin—The Spätzle full-length isoforms were processed by incubation with bovine trypsin (Sigma) at a ratio 100:1 (w/w) in 0.1 m Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, at 20 °C (4Weber A.N.R. Tauszig-Delamasure S. Hoffmann J.A. Lelievre E. Gascan H. Ray K.P. Morse M.A. Imler J.-L. Gay N.J. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 794-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). In order to visualize intermediates during limited proteolysis, digestion was also performed at 4 °C, slowing down the rate of the reaction. For analytical samples, digestion was stopped by heating in SDS loading buffer for 5 min at 95 °C. For preparative samples, the cystine knot domain with a COOH-terminal His6-tag (C106His) was purified by affinity chromatography with an Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column in 0.1 m Tris/HCl, 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, binding buffer with stepwise elution up to 500 mm imidazole. For C106 from Spz8.19, which lacked a COOH-terminal His6 tag, the cystine knot domain was purified using a heparin affinity chromatography. To remove any traces of active trypsin, a HiTrap Benzamidin FF column (GE Healthcare), equilibrated in 0.1 m Tris/HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4, was applied, allowing collection of the cystine knot domain in the flow-through. Cysteine Modification and Mass Spectrometry—The free cysteine content was determined by iodoacetamide modification; a molecular mass increase of 57 Da for each free cysteine should be detected using mass spectrometry. 1 m iodoacetamide in 1 m Tris/HCl, pH 8.5, 20 mm EDTA was added at a 1:5 (v/v) ratio to the protein solution, and the reaction was performed for 15 min at 20 °C. Samples were desalted by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography using a C4 column and a H2O/acetonitrile gradient at 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and subsequently analyzed with an ESI-Q-TOF 2 mass spectrometer (Waters, Manchester, UK), equipped with a nanospray ion source. Samples were injected via a PicoTip (New Objective, Cambridge, MA) with a syringe pump at a flow rate of 300 nl/min. The MaxEnt™ I algorithm was used to deconvolute the data to single charge state. Circular Dichroism—Far-UV CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter in 1-nm steps from 260 nm to 190 nm with at least eight accumulations. Measurements were performed in 0.1- and 0.5-mm quartz cells with 0.5 g/liter protein samples in 20–50 mm sodium phosphate, 20 mm NaCl, pH 7.2, at 4 °C. Chemical denaturation experiments involved varying GdnHCl concentrations, each incubated for at least 16 h at 20 °C. Thermal denaturation measurements were carried out in a temperature range from 4 to 90 °C. Ellipticities according to the mean molecular weight of amino acid residues were calculated from buffer-corrected spectra (17Kelly S.M. Jess T.J. Price N.C. Acta Biochim. Biophys. 2005; 1751: 119-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (2317) Google Scholar). Transition curves of the proportion of native protein as a function of denaturant were fitted using a six-parameter function (18Santoro M.M. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8063-8068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1589) Google Scholar), yielding values for the free energy ΔGU and cooperativity mU of unfolding. Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Fluorescence measurements were carried out on a FluoroMax-2 spectrometer. Protein samples with ∼2 μm concentrations in 20–50 mm sodium phosphate, 20 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, at 20 °C in 1-cm cuvettes were studied under native and varying GdnHCl-denatured conditions. Fluorescence was excited at 295 nm, and the emission scanned from 310 to 400 nm. Sample intensities were subtracted from buffer intensities and normalized to the protein concentration. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)—Calorimetric measurements were performed using a VP-DSC Micro Calorimeter (MicroCal) with a 0.5-ml sample volume. Thermal denaturation was measured in a temperature range from 25 to 105 °C with a temperature slope of 90 °C/h. NMR Spectroscopy—One-dimensional 1H spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance II 600 spectrometer (Spz11.7, C106His) and Bruker Avance 900 spectrometer (Spz8.24) at 298 K. Samples were measured in 20 mm sodium phosphate, 20 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, containing 10% (v/v) D2O. Water suppression was achieved by presaturation and/or WATERGATE. Spectra were processed and analyzed using Felix 2000. In Vivo Activity Assay in D. melanogaster Embryos—Recombinant Spätzle protein was injected into embryos produced from spz null Df(3R)ED6255/spz2 ca1 females crossed to wild type males. Df(3R)ED6255 (96D2-F1) uncovers the spz gene (19Ryder E. Ashburner M. Bautista-Llacer R. Drummond J. Webster J. Johnson G. Morley T. Chan Y.S. Blows F. Coulson D. Reuter G. Baisch H. Apelt C. Kauk A.

Marhold J. Serras F. Corominas M. Punset A. Roote J. Russell S. Genetics. 2007; 177: 615-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), and spz2 is a null allele (10DeLotto Y. Smith C.L. DeLotto R. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2001; 264: 643-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Df(3R)ED6255/spz2 ca1 transheterozygotes were produced by a cross of Df(3R)ED6255/TM6c, Sb females with spz2 ca1/TM6c, Sb males. The spz2 ca1/TM1, Me strain obtained from the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center was rebalanced over the TM6c, Sb balancer chromosome to achieve the more visible dominant marker Sb (Stubble). Due to maternal gene effects, embryos from Df(3R)ED6255/spz2 ca1 females lack functional Spätzle, resulting in interruption of the dorsoventral axis development and the production of dorsalized embryos. Flies were kept on freshly yeasted plates and embryos collected at 30-min intervals. These were washed in 1 × phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.2), dechorionated in 12% hypochloride solution, again washed in 1× phosphate-buffered saline, dried for 7 min at 30 °C, covered with halocarbon oil, lined up on agar blocks, transferred to heptane-glued coverslips, and covered with 10S Voltalef oil. Injection of protein at a concentration of 5 g/liter in 0.1 mm sodium phosphate, 5 mm KCl, pH 7.4, into the ventral perivitteline space in embryos at developmental stage 2 (1Stein D. Roth S.

After injection, embryos on the coverslip were placed in a moist environment for 22 h at 25 °C. To detect rescued embryos, superfluous oil was removed by heptane, and the coverslip with embryos was inverted and mounted in Hoyer's medium (20van de Meer J.M. Drosophila Information Service. 1977; 52: 160Google Scholar) with lactic acid (1:1) for permanent mounting. After clearing overnight at 65 °C, the embryos were visualized in dark field and counted for successful development of dorsal-ventral patterning. Crystallization and Structure Determination—Crystallization of C106His is described elsewhere (21Hoffmann A. Neumann P. Schierhorn A. Stubbs M.T. Acta Crystallogr. 2008; F64: 707-710Google Scholar). A data set from a single C106 crystal was collected at beam line BL 14.1 (BESSY, Berlin) equipped with a fast scanning 225-mm CCD-mosaic detector (Marresearch). Oscillation photographs were integrated, merged, and scaled using the XDS package (22Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3200) Google Scholar).

Both overall anisotropic B-factor and bulk solvent corrections were applied. Strong NCS restraints between equivalent residues in the two monomers were applied during the initial steps of the refinement; these were later relaxed and finally abandoned as a result of noticeable differences between the two monomers. Final refinement steps were carried out using alternate cycles of PHENIX (31Adams P.D. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Hung L.W. Ioerger T.R. McCoy A.J. Moriarty N.W. Read R.J. Sacchettini J.C. Sauter N.K.

The PHENIX refinement was performed with six TLS groups (3 groups/monomer). The final model, consisting of residues Asp5–Glu108 in monomer A and Ser4–Gly106 in monomer B, one glycerol, and 37 water molecules, has been refined at 2.4 Å resolution to R and Rfree factors of 0.2219 and 0.2651, respectively. No electron density was observed for residues Leu23 to Asp36 of either molecule, suggesting that they are disordered in the crystal. Superposition of the two monomers reveals the unusually high value of 1 Å for 84 Cα atoms. In addition to residues adjacent to the termini (Ser4-Asp5, Lys104–Glu108) and the disordered loop (Lys21-Gly22, Asp36-Glu37), Cα displacements of >1 Å are observed for residues Asn59–Gln62 near the disulfide knot and Asn91–Phe93.

https://openalex.org/W2132111877,"Background Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a model system for algal and cell biology and is used for biotechnological applications, such as molecular farming or biological hydrogen production. The Chlamydomonas metal-responsive CYC6 promoter is repressed by copper and induced by nickel ions. However, induction by nickel is weak in some strains, poorly reversible by chelating agents like EDTA, and causes, at high concentrations, toxicity side effects on Chlamydomonas growth. Removal of these bottlenecks will encourage the wide use of this promoter as a chemically regulated gene expression system. Methodology Using a codon-optimized Renilla luciferase as a reporter gene, we explored several strategies to improve the strength and reversibility of CYC6 promoter induction. Use of the first intron of the RBCS2 gene or of a modified TAP medium increases the strength of CYC6 induction up to 20-fold. In the modified medium, induction is also obtained after addition of specific copper chelators, like TETA. At low concentrations (up to 10 µM) TETA is a more efficient inducer than Ni, which becomes a very efficient inducer at higher concentrations (50 µM). Neither TETA nor Ni show toxicity effects at the concentrations used. Unlike induction by Ni, induction by TETA is completely reversible by micromolar copper concentrations, thus resulting in a transient “wave” in luciferase activity, which can be repeated in subsequent growth cycles. Conclusions We have worked out a chemically regulated gene expression system that can be finely tuned to produce temporally controlled “waves” in gene expression. The use of cassettes containing the CYC6 promoter, and of modified growth media, is a reliable and economically sustainable system for the temporally controlled expression of foreign genes in Chlamydomonas."
https://openalex.org/W1968653214,"In a variable yet predictable world, organisms may use environmental cues to make adaptive adjustments to their phenotype. Such phenotypic flexibility is expected commonly to evolve in life history traits, which are closely tied to Darwinian fitness. Yet adaptive life history flexibility remains poorly documented. Here we introduce the collembolan Folsomia candida, a soil-dweller, parthenogenetic (all-female) microarthropod, as a model organism to study the phenotypic expression, genetic variation, fitness consequences and long-term evolution of life history flexibility. We demonstrate that collembola have a remarkable adaptive ability for adjusting their reproductive phenotype: when transferred from harsh to good conditions (in terms of food ration and crowding), a mother can fine-tune the number and the size of her eggs from one clutch to the next. The comparative analysis of eleven clonal populations of worldwide origins reveals (i) genetic variation in mean egg size under both good and bad conditions; (ii) no genetic variation in egg size flexibility, consistent with convergent evolution to a common physiological limit; (iii) genetic variation of both mean reproductive investment and reproductive investment flexibility, associated with a reversal of the genetic correlation between egg size and clutch size between environmental conditions ; (iv) a negative genetic correlation between reproductive investment flexibility and adult lifespan. Phylogenetic reconstruction shows that two life history strategies, called HIFLEX and LOFLEX, evolved early in evolutionary history. HIFLEX includes six of our 11 clones, and is characterized by large mean egg size and reproductive investment, high reproductive investment flexibility, and low adult survival. LOFLEX (the other five clones) has small mean egg size and low reproductive investment, low reproductive investment flexibility, and high adult survival. The divergence of HIFLEX and LOFLEX could represent different adaptations to environments differing in mean quality and variability, or indicate that a genetic polymorphism of reproductive investment reaction norms has evolved under a physiological tradeoff between reproductive investment flexibility and adult lifespan."
https://openalex.org/W1985069865,"The third variable region (V3) of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope gp120 subunit participates in determination of viral infection coreceptor tropism and host humoral immune responses. Positive charge of the V3 plays a key role in determining viral coreceptor tropism. Here, we examined by bioinformatics, experimental, and protein modelling approaches whether the net positive charge of V3 sequence regulates viral sensitivity to humoral immunity. We chose HIV-1 CRF01_AE strain as a model virus to address the question. Diversity analyses using CRF01_AE V3 sequences from 37 countries during 1984 and 2005 (n = 1361) revealed that reduction in the V3's net positive charge makes V3 less variable due to limited positive selection. Consistently, neutralization assay using CRF01_AE V3 recombinant viruses (n = 30) showed that the reduction in the V3's net positive charge rendered HIV-1 less sensitive to neutralization by the blood anti-V3 antibodies. The especially neutralization resistant V3 sequences were the particular subset of the CCR5-tropic V3 sequences with net positive charges of +2 to +4. Molecular dynamics simulation of the gp120 monomers showed that the V3's net positive charge regulates the V3 configuration. This and reported gp120 structural data predict a less-exposed V3 with a reduced net positive charge in the native gp120 trimer context. Taken together, these data suggest a key role of the V3's net positive charge in the immunological escape and coreceptor tropism evolution of HIV-1 CRF01_AE in vivo. The findings have molecular implications for the adaptive evolution and vaccine design of HIV-1."
https://openalex.org/W2003655724,"Feedback loops are the simplest building blocks of transcriptional regulatory networks and therefore their behavior in the course of evolution is of prime interest.We address the question of enrichment of the number of autoregulatory feedback loops in higher organisms. First, based on predicted autoregulatory binding sites we count the number of autoregulatory loops. We compare it to estimates obtained either by assuming that each (conserved) gene has the same chance to be a target of a given factor or by assuming that each conserved sequence position has an equal chance to be a binding site of the factor.We demonstrate that the numbers of putative autoregulatory loops conserved between human and fugu, danio or chicken are significantly higher than expected. Moreover we show, that conserved autoregulatory binding sites cluster close to the factors' starts of transcription. We conclude, that transcriptional autoregulatory feedback loops constitute a core transcriptional network motif and their conservation has been maintained in higher vertebrate organism evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2145054010,"Emerging evidence suggests that sleep plays a key role in procedural learning, particularly in the continued development of motor skill learning following initial acquisition. We argue that a detailed examination of the time course of performance across sleep on the finger-tapping task, established as the paradigm for studying the effect of sleep on motor learning, will help distinguish a restorative role of sleep in motor skill learning from a proactive one. Healthy subjects rehearsed for 12 trials and, following a night of sleep, were tested. Early training rapidly improved speed as well as accuracy on pre-sleep training. Additional rehearsal caused a marked slow-down in further improvement or partial reversal in performance to observed levels below theoretical upper limits derived on the basis of early pre-sleep rehearsal. This decrement in learning efficacy does not occur always, but if and only if it does, overnight sleep has an effect in fully or partly restoring the efficacy and actual performance to the optimal theoretically achieveable level. Our findings re-interpret the sleep-dependent memory enhancement in motor learning reported in the literature as a restoration of fatigued circuitry specialized for the skill. In providing restitution to the fatigued brain, sleep eliminates the rehearsal-induced synaptic fatigue of the circuitry specialized for the task and restores the benefit of early pre-sleep rehearsal. The present findings lend support to the notion that latent sleep-dependent enhancement of performance is a behavioral expression of the brain's restitution in sleep."

https://openalex.org/W2011885375,"Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer is caused by germline mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes. The majority of cases are associated with mutations in hMSH2 or hMLH1; however, about 12% of cases are associated with alterations in hMSH6. The hMSH6 protein forms a heterodimer with hMSH2 that is capable of recognizing a DNA mismatch. The heterodimer then utilizes its adenosine nucleotide processing ability in an, as of yet, unclear mechanism to facilitate communication between the mismatch and a distant strand discrimination site. The majority of reported mutations in hMSH6 are deletions or truncations that entirely eliminate the function of the protein; however, nearly a third of the reported variations are missense mutations whose functional significance is unclear. We analyzed seven cancer-associated single amino acid alterations in hMSH6 distributed throughout the functional domains of the protein to determine their effect on the biochemical activity of the hMSH2-hMSH6 heterodimer. Five alterations affect mismatch-stimulated ATP hydrolysis activity providing functional evidence that missense variants of hMSH6 can disrupt mismatch repair function and may contribute to disease. Of the five mutants that affect mismatch-stimulated ATP hydrolysis, only two (R976H and H1248D) affect mismatch recognition. Thus, three of the mutants (G566R, V878A, and D803G) appear to uncouple the mismatch binding and ATP hydrolysis activities of the heterodimer. We also demonstrate that these three mutations alter ATP-dependent conformation changes of hMSH2-hMSH6, suggesting that cancer-associated mutations in hMSH6 can disrupt the intramolecular signaling that coordinates mismatch binding with adenosine nucleotide processing."

Second, our results on Ostm1 hematopoietic-targeted transgenic mice support that Ostm1 is required not only in osteoclast lineage but also in other lineages to fully rescue gl/gl osteopetrosis and defective hematopoiesis.

TRAP-Ostm1—The TRAP-Ostm1 construction was produced with the Ostm1 cDNA (1.055 kb) linked to the TRAP promoter (1.8 kb, XhoI/XbaI) upstream (22Reddy S.V. Scarcez T. Windle J.J. Leach R.J. Hundley J.E. Chirgwin J.M. Chou J.Y. Roodman G.D. J. Bone Min. Res. 1993; 8: 1263-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and to the human hGH poly(A) signal (2.1 kb) downstream. Linearized transgene (XhoI/NotI) was injected into fertilized oocytes from F2 (C3H × C57BL/6) (23Ferron M. Vacher J. Genesis. 2005; 41: 138-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Transgenic mice were identified by PCR with TRAP forward (5′-GTCCTCACCAGAGACTCTGAAC-3′) and Ostm1 reverse (5′-CAAGTCCTGCACCTCCAACAG-3′) primers. PCR amplification conditions were 94 °C, 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 0.5 min, 65 °C for 0.5 min, and 72 °C for 0.5 min. Transgene integrity and copy number were determined by Southern analysis. Each transgenic line was successively crossed with heterozygous gl/+ mice to generate gl/gl TRAP-Ostm1 transgenic progenies. PU.1-Ostm1—Three PU.1 BAC clones were first isolated from a 129Sv mouse pBelo11 BAC genomic library (Research Genetics). These BAC clones contained, based on two PCR assays, >19 kb of upstream regulatory sequences of PU.1 with primers at ∼–19 kb (forward, 5′-TCTTGAATGCCTGCTTGTG-3′; reverse, 5′-TTGGAGCTGGAGAGATGGTTC-3′) and the PU.1 second exon with another primer set (forward, 5′-CGGATGACTTGGTTACTTACG-3′; reverse, 5′-GGGCTGACATTGTGTGGATAC-3′). From pulse field gel electrophoresis, Southern blot, and end-junction sequencing analysis, one of these BAC clones (∼100 kb) was selected for further experiments and contained >30 kb of PU.1 regulatory sequence, the full-length PU.1 gene as well as the Tbp1 gene. Two targeting constructs for homologous recombination were produced in pLD53.SC1 BAC recombination vector to modify the original PU.1 BAC clone. The first construct was designed to delete the Tbp1 gene from the original BAC. Two homologous regions on each side of the Tbp1 gene, 31 kb apart, were PCR-amplified from PU.1 BAC DNA and cloned in pLD53.SC1 vector (24Gong S. Yang X.W. Li C. Heintz N. Genome Res. 2002; 12: 1992-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The second construct was designed to replace the PU.1 genomic sequence by the Ostm1 open reading frame and an in-frame iEGFP-PGK poly(A) sequences (1.7 kb). Homologous PU.1 5′ and 3′ regions were amplified from the original PU.1 BAC DNA and inserted upstream and downstream of the Ostm1-pA cloned in the pLD53.SC1 vector (supplemental Table S1). Each of the two homologous constructs was used in a two-step RecA strategy for BAC modifications (24Gong S. Yang X.W. Li C. Heintz N. Genome Res. 2002; 12: 1992-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The Tbp1 gene was excised from the original PU.1 BAC creating the new BAC PU.1ΔTbp1. The PU.1 genomic coding sequences were then replaced by those of Ostm1 in the BAC PU.1ΔTbp1, generating the PU.1-Ostm1 BAC. At each step, the new BACs were fully characterized by pulse field gel electrophoresis and Southern blot. Modified Tbp1 and PU.1 regions were sequenced to verify proper gene deletion/substitution and exclude other alterations. The resulting PU.1-Ostm1 BAC (∼70 kb) was microinjected (17Chalhoub N. Benachenhou N. Rajapurohitam V. Pata M. Ferron M. Frattini A. Villa A. Vacher J. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), and transgenic founders were identified by PCR using PU.1 forward (5′-GCCTTTCTCCCTCCCAGCC-3′) and Ostm1 reverse (5′-CAAGTCCTGCACCTCCAACAG-3′) primers. PCR amplification conditions were 94 °C, 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 0.5 min, 65 °C for 0.5 min, and 72 °C for 0.5 min, and transgene integrity and copy number were determined by Southern blot. Each founder was successively crossed with heterozygous gl/+ mice to generate gl/gl PU.1-Ostm1 transgenic progenies. Hematologic Parameters—Blood from gl/gl and control mice was obtained by cardiac puncture and collected into EDTA-coated tubes (BD Microtainer). Hematological analysis was performed using a Bayer Advia 120 automated cell analyzer with the mouse archetype of multispecies software version 2.206 (CBTR, Montreal, Canada). The spleen and thymus were monitored as percentage of organ to total body weight. FACS Analysis—Flow cytometric analyses were carried out on spleen, thymus, and bone marrow single cell suspension in phosphate-buffered saline with 1% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Nucleated cells (1.5 × 106) were stained with phycoerythrin-conjugated CD11b, B220, IgD, or CD4 (Pharmingen) and with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated IgM, CD5, Ly6-G, CD8, and CD11c (Cedarlane). Samples were analyzed on a BD FACSCalibur four-color flow cytometer with System II software. Hematopoietic Progenitor Clonogenic Assays—The number of splenic nucleated cells was quantified from single cell suspension in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium containing 1% methylcellulose, 10% fetal calf serum, erythropoietin (1.0 unit/ml), murine IL-3 (0.8% v/v of WEHI-3 supernatant), 1% bovine serum albumin, transferrin (190 mg/ml), and α-monothioglycerol (5 × 10–2 m) (25Iscove N.N. Sieber F. Whintherhalter K.H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1974; 83: 309-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Each assay was set up in triplicates, and colony-forming units were defined by morphology, size (cell number), and hemoglobinization. Erythroid colony-forming units (CFU-E) were counted at day 2, whereas burst-forming units (BFU-E), granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-GM), and macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-M) were counted at day 7 and granulocyte, erythroid, macrophage, and megakaryocyte colony-forming units (CFU-GEMM) at day 11. Ex Vivo Osteoclast Differentiation—Bone marrow-derived macrophage cells were generated ex vivo from bone marrow cells cultured for 5 days in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and macrophage-colony-stimulating factor. Osteoclast-like cells (OCLs) were generated from bone marrow-derived macrophage cell differentiation in vitro for 6 days in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 ng/ml macrophage-colony-stimulating factor, and 50 ng/ml receptor activator of NF-κB ligand. Alternatively, OCLs were generated ex vivo by co-culture of primary calvaria osteoblasts with bone marrow/spleen cells as previously described (21Rajapurohitam V. Chalhoub N. Benachenhou N. Neff L. Baron R. Vacher J. Bone. 2001; 28: 513-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Total RNA from OCLs, enriched hematopoietic cells, and tissues, including bone marrow, brain, kidney, thymus, liver, and spleen, were isolated with TRIzol (Invitrogen). TRAP-Osmt1 transgene expression was determined by semi-quantitative PCR on 0.5 μg of total RNA. The primers used were: Ostm1 endogenous forward 5′-CCTGCTTTGAGCATAACCTGA-3′ (Ostm1 exon 3) and reverse 5′-CTGCAGTCCCAACATTTCGTGAG-3′ (Ostm1 3′-untranslated region); TRAP-Ostm1 transgene, forward 5′-GTGGTTGCTGTGTCTGTGTTCA-3′ (Ostm1 exon 5), reverse 5′-TTGGGATATAGGCTTCTTCAAACTC-3′ (hGH); Trap gene forward 5′-TGTTCTCTGACCGTGCCCTTC-3′ (Trap exon 3) and reverse 5′-CCCACTCAGCACATAGCCCCA-3′ (Trap exon 5). PCR conditions were 94 °C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 0.5 min, 65 °C for 0.5 min, and 72 °C for 0.5 min. PU.1-Ostm1 transgene expression was determined by real-time quantitative PCR on 0.1 μg of DNase (Invitrogen)-treated total RNA. The primers used were for Ostm1 endogenous forward 5′-GCTTCCTTCACTCAGAGCAA-3′ (Ostm1 exon 5) and reverse 5′-GTGAGAATGCAACTTGTCCGA-3′ (Ostm1 exon 6); PU.1-Ostm1 transgene, forward 5′-GCTTCCTTCACTCAGAGCAA-3′ (Ostm1 exon 5), reverse 5′-AGTGAATAGGAACTTCGGAA-3′(EGFP); Trap forward 5′-GGTATGTGCTGGCTGGA-3′ (Trap exon 3) and reverse 5′-GACTGGCAAAGTCATCTGA-3′ (Trap exon 5); PU.1 endogenous forward 5′-ATGGAGCTGGAACAGATGCA-3′ (PU.1 exon 3) and reverse 5′-CCAAGCCATCAGCTTCTCCA-3′ (PU.1 exon 4); S16 forward 5′-GCTACCAGGGCCTTTGAGATG-3′ and reverse 5′-AGGACGGATTTGCTGGTGTGG-3′. All reactions were performed in triplicate in a Syber Green Master Mix (Qiagen). PCR conditions were 94 °C, 15 min, followed by 50 cycles of 94 °C for 0.5 min, 55 °C for 0.5 min, and 72 °C for 0.5 min in an MX4000 Mutiplex quantitative PCR analyzer. Bone samples from 3-week-old mice were fixed in 10% phosphate-buffered formalin, decalcified in 0.5 m EDTA, and embedded in paraffin. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), mounted, and analyzed. X-ray scan was carried out using Faxitron MX20 (18 Kv, 10 s). Values are expressed as mean ± S.D. Unpaired two-sample Student's t test was used for statistical analysis with p < 0.05 considered significant. Ostm1 expression profile was determined in wild-type mature hematopoietic cells derived from myeloid and lymphoid populations. Enriched ex vivo hematopoietic cell populations were obtained from cultured C57BL/6J spleen, bone marrow, and peritoneal cavity cells (26Davidson D. Veillette A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3414-3426Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 27Cao M.Y. Davidson D. Yu J. Latour S. Veillette A. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1527-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Semi-quantitative expression analysis of endogenous Ostm1 showed high levels in B, NK, and mast cells and lower levels in T cells and activated macrophages relative to actin control (Fig. 1), suggesting that Ostm1 could play a role in several hematopoietic cell types. Anemia and Leukopenia in gl/gl Mice—To determine the impact of the gl mutation on hematopoietic cell populations, we evaluated hematological parameters of gl/gl and wild-type control littermates. The gl/gl mice showed a significant reduction in the number of red blood cells compared with wild-type mice, as well as a significant reduction in hematocrit and hemoglobin indicating a mild anemia (Table 1). In parallel, the number of white blood cells and lymphocytes was significantly decreased, indicating leukopenia and lymphopenia in gl/gl mice (Table 1). Homozygous gl/gl mice displayed a spleen to body weight ratio comparable to wild-type mice despite anemia (Table 2). Consistently, histological examination of the spleen did not show any profound architectural alteration of the white or red pulps where B cell maturation and myelopoiesis occur respectively (data not shown).TABLE 1Hematological parameters of grey-lethal (gl/gl) miceMicenRBCHematocritHemoglobinWBCLymphocytesMonocytesPLT109 cells/ml%g/dl106 cells/ml106 cells/ml104 cells/ml106 cells/ml+/+106.3 ± 1.734.1 ± 8.910.0 ± 2.74.1 ± 0.93.2 ± 0.611.1 ± 6.51000 ± 460gl/gl94.2 ± 2.1ap < 0.05.22.0 ± 10.7bp < 0.02.6.2 ± 2.8bp < 0.02.2.8 ± 1.7ap < 0.05.1.6 ± 1.3cp < 0.001.11.4 ± 6.5707 ± 586a p < 0.05.b p < 0.02.c p < 0.001.

Open table in a new tab Analysis of Myeloid Lineages: Stimulation of gl Osteoclast Progenitors—Since gl/gl mice exhibit altered hematological parameters, spleen hematopoietic progenitor populations of homozygous gl/gl mice were evaluated using clonogenic assays, because there is a massive depletion of bone marrow cells in this severe osteopetrotic phenotype. The level of multipotent CFU-GEMM cell population in gl/gl and age-matched control littermate mice was not significantly affected (Table 2). Similarly, erythroid differentiation potential quantified by early BFU-E and late CFU-E spleen progenitor cell populations in gl/gl mice showed, despite the anemia, no significant increase relative to age-matched controls (Table 2). In contrast, all gl/gl mice showed a marked 2.5-fold expansion of granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (CFU-GM), from which osteoclasts are derived, relative to wild-type control (Table 2). The size of CFU-GM colonies in gl/gl mice compared with control mice appeared larger, but maintained similar morphology. In addition, the levels of the CFU-M progenitor cells, from which macrophages are derived, were comparable in gl/gl and control mice, indicating that only the CFU-GM are affected. To further characterize and quantify the osteoclast cell populations, we performed flow-cytometric analysis (FACS) on spleen cell populations using CD11b+ and Ly6-G+ antibodies. As shown in Table 3, the analysis revealed a significant increase of splenic CD11b+ and CD11b+/Ly6-G+ cells that include osteoclast, macrophage, monocyte, and granulocyte populations in gl/gl mice relative to controls. In fact, the CD11b+/Ly6-G+ cell subpopulation was elevated ∼4-fold in homozygous gl/gl mice, consistent with increased CFU-GM progenitors (Table 2). By contrast, analysis of the population of splenic dendritic CD11b+/CD11c+ cells was unchanged in gl/gl mice (data not shown).TABLE 3Altered splenic myeloid and lymphoid cell populations of grey-lethal (gl/gl) miceMicenMyeloid lineageLymphoid lineagesCD11b+CD11b+Ly6-G+B220+ IgM+IgM+ IgD+CD5+CD4+CD8++/+63.7 ± 0.31.3 ± 0.223.1 ± 1.916.1 ± 2.59.2 ± 1.86.1 ± 1.43.1 ± 0.9gl/gl68.7 ± 2.2ap < 0.001.5.9 ± 2.5ap < 0.001.13.4 ± 1.6ap < 0.001.12.4 ± 1.6ap < 0.001.7.5 ± 1.29.4 ± 3.06.5 ± 2.6a p < 0.001. Open table in a new tab Impaired gl Lymphopoiesis—Because homozygous gl/gl mice have reduced white blood cell count and human osteopetrotic patients have higher susceptibility to infections possibly due to altered immune response, the lymphoid lineages were investigated in gl/gl spleen and thymus. Quantification of the “late” B-lymphoid cell population by FACS revealed a significant decrease of ∼40% of the B220+/IgM+ cell population in the gl/gl mice compared with control. Similarly, the more mature IgM+/IgD+ cell population was also significantly reduced in gl/gl mice (Table 3). Because the B-lymphoid compartment is constituted of two distinct B1 and B2 cell populations (28Kantor A.B. Herzenberg L.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1993; 11: 501-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar), we have quantified the B1 cell population separately using the specific CD5 (Ly-1) marker to monitor B-cell differentiation potential. In gl/gl mice, the B1 self-renewing cells (CD5+) that differentiate independently from bone marrow stroma were slightly reduced (∼18%) relative to control mice (Table 3). The gl/gl thymus was consistently smaller in comparison to age-matched littermates and the ratio of thymus to body weight was significantly reduced (Table 4). Quantification of the major thymic T-cell populations in gl/gl and wild-type littermate animals showed altered thymic cellular subpopulations. Although the gl/gl double negative CD4–CD8– cell subpopulation was unchanged, an important depletion in the double positive CD4+CD8+ subpopulation was determined relative to wild type (Table 4). Concurrently, the gl/gl mice displayed a major 4- to 5-fold increase in single CD4- and CD8-positive cells (Table 4), suggesting enhanced thymic cell maturation.TABLE 4Thymus analysis and altered distribution in cell populations of grey-lethal (gl/gl) miceMicenBody weightThymus weightThymus/body WTNucleated cellsCD4+CD8+CD4+CD8+gg%×106/thymus+/+413.5 ± 2.10.058 ± 0.0010.4586.8 ± 1380.5 ± 6.411.7 ± 5.15.1 ± 1.2gl/gl45.7 ± 1.0ap < 0.001.0.020 ± 0.003ap < 0.001.0.35bp < 0.05.10.5 ± 2.2ap < 0.001.9.5 ± 4.1ap < 0.001.63.7 ± 5.0ap < 0.001.21.7 ± 6.3ap < 0.001.a p < 0.001.b p < 0.05. Open table in a new tab In gl/gl mice, the increased progenitor and mature osteoclast population, concomitant with inactive osteoclasts (21Rajapurohitam V. Chalhoub N. Benachenhou N. Neff L. Baron R. Vacher J. Bone. 2001; 28: 513-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), indicated that Ostm1 expression was required in late committed precursors of the osteoclast lineage. To investigate this hypothesis, transgenic mice expressing Ostm1 under the control of the committed osteoclasts TRAP gene promoter were generated (Fig. 2A). Three TRAP-Ostm1 transgenic lines (2–10 transgene copies) were assessed for osteoclast-specific expression, precursor frequency, and differentiation potential. Expression of the transgene was slightly below endogenous expression in two lines (630 and 692), and above in one line (670) (Fig. 2B). Transgenic OCLs from all lines showed similar frequency and differentiation potential as non-transgenic OCLs (data not shown). Importantly, the TRAP-Ostm1 transgenic mice did not exhibit any bone defects. The TRAP-Ostm1 transgenic mice from the three lines then served to test for osteopetrosis complementation by successive mating to heterozygous gl/+ mice. Transgenic gl/gl TRAP-Ostm1 mice generated from these matings were genotyped for the Ostm1 mutation (17Chalhoub N. Benachenhou N. Rajapurohitam V. Pata M. Ferron M. Frattini A. Villa A. Vacher J. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) and the transgene. All gl/gl TRAP-Ostm1 transgenic progenies displayed an osteopetrotic phenotype similar to gl/gl non-transgenic mice with reduced bone marrow space and lack of tooth eruption (Fig. 2C). This indicated that Ostm1 expression in committed osteoclast precursors to mature cells is not sufficient to rescue the gl/gl osteoclast defect. Lack of complementation in gl/gl TRAP-Ostm1 transgenic mice and the multihematopoietic lineage defects in gl/gl mice suggested that Ostm1 expression is required in other hematopoietic cell or lineage at earlier stage. Because the PU.1 transcriptional factor is essential in the early osteoclast lineage as well as in several early hematopoietic progenitors, including erythropoietic and lymphoid lineages (20Tondravi M.M.

Rothenberg E.V. Development. 1999; 126: 3133-3148Google Scholar), regulatory elements of the PU.1 (Sfpi1) gene were selected to target Ostm1 expression in transgenic mice. A 100-kb PU.1 BAC clone was isolated that contains regulatory sequences with the CAAT/enhancer-binding protein-α enhancer binding site (30Yeamans C. Wang D.-Z. Paz-Priel I. Torbett B.E. Tenen D.G.

https://openalex.org/W2012286532,"Macrophage galactose-type C-type lectins 1 and 2 (MGL1/2) are expressed on the surfaces of macrophages and immature dendritic cells. Despite the high similarity between the primary sequences of MGL1 and MGL2, they display different ligand specificities. MGL1 shows high affinity for the LewisX trisaccharide, whereas MGL2 shows affinity for N-acetylgalactosamine. To elucidate the structural basis for the ligand specificities of the MGLs, we performed NMR analyses of the MGL1-LewisX complex. To identify the LewisX binding site on MGL1, a saturation transfer experiment for the MGL1-LewisX complex where sugar-CH/CH2-selective saturation was applied was carried out. To obtain sugar moiety-specific information on the interface between MGL1 and the LewisX trisaccharide, saturation transfer experiments where each of galactose-H5-, fucose-CH3-, and N-acetylglucosamine-CH3-selective saturations was applied to the MGL1-LewisX complex were performed. Based on these results, we present a LewisX binding mode on MGL1 where the galactose moiety is bound to the primary sugar binding site, including Asp-94, Trp-96, and Asp-118, and the fucose moiety interacts with the secondary sugar binding site, including Ala-89 and Thr-111. Ala-89 and Thr-111 in MGL1 are replaced with arginine and serine in MGL2, respectively. The hydrophobic environment formed by a small side chain of Ala-89 and a methyl group of Thr-111 is a requisite for the accommodation of the fucose moiety of the LewisX trisaccharide within the sugar binding site of MGL1."
https://openalex.org/W2066951138,"Background Post-translational modification regulates promoter-binding by Adr1, a Zn-finger transcriptional activator of glucose-regulated genes. Support for this model includes the activation of an Adr1-dependent gene in the absence of Adr1 protein synthesis, and a requirement for the kinase Snf1 for Adr1 DNA-binding. A fusion protein with the Adr1 DNA-binding domain and a heterologous activation domain is glucose-regulated, suggesting that the DNA binding region is the target of regulation. Methodology/Principal Findings Peptide mapping identified serine 98 adjacent to the Zn-fingers as a phosphorylation site. An antibody specific for phosphorylated serine 98 on Adr1 showed that the level of phosphorylated Adr1 relative to the level of total Adr1 decreased with glucose derepression, in a Snf1-dependent manner. Relative phosphorylation decreased in a PHO85 mutant, and this mutant constitutively expressed an Adr1-dependent reporter. Pho85 did not phosphorylate Adr1 in vitro, suggesting that it affects Adr1 indirectly. Mutation of serine 98 to the phosphomimetic amino acid aspartate reduced in vitro DNA-binding of the recombinant Adr1 DNA-binding domain. Mutation to aspartate or alanine affected activation of a reporter by full-length Adr1, and in vivo promoter binding. Conclusions/Significance Mutation of Adr1 serine 98 affects in vitro and in vivo DNA binding, and phosphorylation of serine 98 in vivo correlates with glucose availability, suggesting that Adr1 promoter-binding is regulated in part by serine 98 phosphorylation."

This first step involves insertion of magnesium into protoporphyrin IX (proto), a process requiring ATP hydrolysis. Structural information shows that the BchI and BchD subunits form a double hexameric enzyme complex, whereas BchH binds proto and can be purified as BchH-proto. We utilized the Rhodobacter capsulatus magnesium chelatase subunits using continuous magnesium chelatase assays and treated the BchD subunit as the enzyme with both BchI and BchH-proto as substrates. Michaelis-Menten kinetics was observed with the BchI subunit, whereas the BchH subunit exhibited sigmoidal kinetics (Hill coefficient of 1.85). The BchI·BchD complex had intrinsic ATPase activity, and addition of BchH greatly increased ATPase activity. This was concentration-dependent and gave sigmoidal kinetics, indicating there is more than one binding site for the BchH subunit on the BchI·BchD complex. ATPase activity was ∼40-fold higher than magnesium chelatase activity and continued despite cessation of magnesium chelation, implying one or more secondary roles for ATP hydrolysis and possibly an as yet unknown switch required to terminate ATPase activity. One of the secondary roles for BchH-stimulated ATP hydrolysis by a BchI·BchD complex is priming of BchH to facilitate correct binding of proto to BchH in a form capable of participating in magnesium chelation.

PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e151Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar); however, no Gun4 homolog has been identified in photosynthetic bacteria. It has been recently suggested that BchJ, thus far identified only in organisms lacking Gun4, may act as a magnesium-porphyrin chaperone in vivo in bacteriochlorophyll biosynthetic systems (7Chew A.G.M.

Magnesium chelatase appears to exist as a complex of the three aforementioned subunits and works as an ATP-dependent molecular machine (3Willows R.D. Hansson M. Kadish K.M. Smith K.M. Guilard R.

The current reaction model of magnesium chelation into the red-colored tetrapyrrole substrate, protoporphyrin IX (proto), 2The abbreviations used are: proto, protoporphyrin IX; EM, electron microscopy; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; DTT, dithiothreitol; Mg-proto, magnesium-protoporphyrin IX. is summarized in a recent review of chlorophyll biosynthesis (11Masuda T. Photosynth. Res. 2008; 96: 121-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and has been constructed through a combination of biochemical and structural data. The model was initially built from biochemical studies using plant magnesium chelatases, pea and cucumber (12Guo R. Luo M. Weinstein J.D.

Thus far, the most detailed magnesium chelatase and ATPase kinetic studies were performed with Synechocystis enzyme (17Jensen P.E. Gibson L.C.D. Hunter C.N. Biochem.

D. 1999; 55: 689-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Magnesium chelation is best understood by looking at the roles of the individual enzyme subunits of the complex. The BchI subunit from R. capsulatus forms a hexamer upon ATP hydrolysis, and its crystal structure is known (22Fodje M.N. Hansson A. Hansson M. Olsen J.G. Gough S. Willows R.D. Al-Karadaghi S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 111-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 25Willows R.D. Hansson M. Beale S.I. Laurberg M. Al-Karadaghi S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 689-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Hexameric BchI particles were confirmed by EM (24Willows R.D. Hansson A. Bircha D. Al-Karadaghi S. Hansson M. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 146: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), whereas a heptamer was observed with the BchI homolog from Synechocystis (26Reid J.D. Siebert C.A. Bullough P.A. Hunter C.N. Biochemistry. 2003; 22: 6912-6920Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Only the BchI subunit has a conserved ATPase domain (3Willows R.D. Hansson M. Kadish K.M. Smith K.M. Guilard R. The Porphyrin Handbook. Academic Press, Sydney, Australia2003: 1-47Google Scholar), and ATPase activity of this subunit has been confirmed (27Hansson M. Kannangara C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13351-13356Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 28Jensen P.E. Gibson L.C.D. Hunter C.N. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 29Petersen B.L. Kannangara C.G. Henningsen K.W. Arch. Microbiol. 1999; 171: 146-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), indicating this subunit is responsible for the ATP-catalyzed insertion of magnesium into proto. Studies from Synechocystis have shown that ∼15 cycles of ATP hydrolysis are required to insert one magnesium into deuteroporphyrin, the more water-soluble analog of proto (19Reid J.D. Hunter C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26893-26899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The BchD subunit has strong homology to the BchI subunit at the N terminus known as the AAA domain (22Fodje M.N. Hansson A. Hansson M. Olsen J.G. Gough S. Willows R.D. Al-Karadaghi S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 111-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). This subunit also appears to form hexamers observed with EM; however, this oligomerization does not require ATP (21Axelsson E. Lundqvist J. Sawicki A. Nilsson S. Schroder I. Al-Karadaghi S. Willows R.D. Hansson M. Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 3606-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Biochemical data first demonstrated the likely formation of a BchI·BchD complex because the lag phase of the magnesium chelatase reaction was overcome by premixing of the BchI and BchD subunits in the presence of magnesium and ATP (17Jensen P.E. Gibson L.C.D. Hunter C.N. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Also the BchD subunit requires the BchI subunit in the refolding process to stay soluble in R. capsulatus, although the expected double hexameric (∼660 kDa) complex was never observed (14Willows R.D. Beale S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34206-34213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Instead, an ∼200-kDa complex has been observed in R. sphaeroides using size-exclusion chromatography (15Gibson L.C.D. Jensen P.E. Hunter C.N. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the BchD subunit interacts directly with the BchI subunit (15Gibson L.C.D. Jensen P.E. Hunter C.N. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 28Jensen P.E. Gibson L.C.D. Hunter C.N. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 30Gräfe S.

Plant J. 1997; 12: 981-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and that magnesium chelatase activity requires the BchI subunit in excess of BchD (14Willows R.D. Beale S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34206-34213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 15Gibson L.C.D. Jensen P.E. Hunter C.N. Biochem.

These results have led to the proposal that the BchI subunit may act as a chaperone for BchD (31Lake V. Olsson U. Willows R.D. Hansson M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 2182-2188Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The lack of ATPase activity of the BchD subunit (27Hansson M. Kannangara C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Kannangara C.G. Henningsen K.W. Arch. Microbiol. 1999; 171: 146-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and the absence of the required amino acid in the ATPase domain sites on the BchD subunit (22Fodje M.N. Hansson A. Hansson M. Olsen J.G. Gough S. Willows R.D. Al-Karadaghi S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 111-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) prompted the suggestion that it could have a role as a platform for binding the BchI subunit (21Axelsson E. Lundqvist J. Sawicki A. Nilsson S. Schroder I. Al-Karadaghi S. Willows R.D. Hansson M. Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 3606-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). EM reconstruction of the BchI·BchD complex has been recently modeled to a double hexamer composed of a trimer of homodimers (33Elmlund H. Lundqvist J. Al-Karadaghi S. Hansson M. Hebert H. Lindahl M. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 375: 934-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thus far, a BchI·BchD·BchH-proto complex has not been isolated, and it has been presumed to exist transiently because only weak interactions were observed with the BchD and BchH subunits (30Gräfe S. Saluz H.-P. Grimm B. Hänel F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1941-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The recombinantly produced R. capsulatus BchH subunit sequesters proto readily. For optimal magnesium chelatase activity, both the BchH and BchI subunits appear to be required in slight excess over the BchD subunit (17Jensen P.E. Gibson L.C.D. Hunter C.N. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) presumably to form a stable BchI·BchD complex that forms in a 1:1 molar ratio (33Elmlund H. Lundqvist J. Al-Karadaghi S. Hansson M. Hebert H. Lindahl M. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 375: 934-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Both BchI and BchH subunits behave kinetically as substrates when the BchD subunit is treated as the enzyme (3Willows R.D. Hansson M. Kadish K.M. Smith K.M. Guilard R. The Porphyrin Handbook. Academic Press, Sydney, Australia2003: 1-47Google Scholar). However, the Km of the BchH subunit is ∼2–3 times that of the BchI subunit, indicative of a weaker association of BchH with BchD compared with BchI (17Jensen P.E. Gibson L.C.D. Hunter C.N. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The structure of the BchH subunit has also been recently investigated by EM, revealing a large conformational change upon binding of the proto substrate (23Sirijovski N. Lundqvist J. Rosenback M. Elmlund H. Al-Karadaghi S. Willows R.D. Hansson M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 11652-11660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We sought to complete the kinetic characterization of magnesium chelatase activity from R. capsulatus using purified subunits and to examine these results based on the current reaction model. These experiments were based primarily upon continuous assays. Our data provide more accurate initial rates than previous results obtained from R. capsulatus using minute-scale stopped assays (14Willows R.D. Beale S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34206-34213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The results provide kinetic profiles of the BchI, BchD, and BchH subunits and highlight some similarities to and differences from previous reports on R. sphaeroides and Synechocystis (15Gibson L.C.D. Jensen P.E. Hunter C.N. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 17Jensen P.E. Gibson L.C.D. Hunter C.N. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). These new findings shed new light in terms of the currently proposed reaction model, regulation of enzyme activity, stability of the complex, and the roles of ATP hydrolysis in the reaction cycle of the complex. Materials—All chemicals were from Sigma, Astral Scientific, and Ajax Finechem unless stated otherwise. Protein Determination—The protein concentrations of BchI and His6-tagged BchD were determined using the Bradford method (34Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (218587) Google Scholar). The His6-tagged BchH concentration was determined using a molar extinction coefficient of ϵ280 = 118,600 m–1 cm–1 and a molecular mass of 132,000 g/mol. All errors and error bars are shown as means ± S.E. unless stated otherwise. BchH:Proto Ratio—The proto concentration bound to the BchH subunit was determined by adding an aliquot of purified BchH to an excess of 80% (v/v) acetone and 20% (v/v) 1 m ammonia (acetone/ammonia) and immediately vortexing. The solution was centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 5 min at room temperature, and the supernatant was used to measure the amount of proto present using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS 55 luminescence spectrometer and referring to a standard curve at Ex400 nm and Em630 nm. The BchH used in the experiments had a protein:proto ratio of 1.24–3.26:1. Porphyrin Solutions—Stock solutions of proto and Mg-proto were prepared as described previously (35Sawicki A. Willows R.D. Biochem. J. 2007; 406: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Protein Expression and Purification—BchI and His6-tagged BchD were purified as described (14Willows R.D. Beale S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34206-34213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 36Hansson A. Willows R.D. Roberts T.H. Hansson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13944-13949Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) with the modifications that a Superose 6 column was used for the final purification step of BchI, and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 was used to wash the inclusion bodies of expressed BchD. His6-tagged BchH was purified according to Willows and Beale (14Willows R.D. Beale S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34206-34213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) by Ni2+ affinity chromatography with a final wash step of 40 mm imidazole. BchH was then desalted into 5 mm Tricine-NaOH (pH 8.0) and concentrated (30-kDa cutoff membrane, Millipore) before further purification by anion-exchange chromatography using Source 15Q resin (GE Healthcare). A 10/100 column with a 6-ml bed volume was used at a flow rate of 3 ml/min and a linear gradient from 0 to 75% buffer (5 mm Tricine-NaOH (pH 8.0) with 1 m NaCl) over 20 column volumes with 1.5-ml fractions collected over this range. The red-colored fractions containing purified BchH eluted between ∼51 and 60 ml (∼0.32–0.37 m NaCl), and these samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE before the purest fractions were pooled. Magnesium Chelatase Assays—All assays were performed according to Axelsson et al. (21Axelsson E. Lundqvist J. Sawicki A. Nilsson S. Schroder I. Al-Karadaghi S. Willows R.D. Hansson M. Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 3606-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The final concentrations were 50 mm Tricine-NaOH (pH 8.0), 21 mm glycerol, 15 mm MgCl2, 3.26 mm urea, 2 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 mm ATP (assay buffer), 367 nm BchH-proto, 263 nm BchI, and 31.7 nm BchD unless stated otherwise in the figure or table legends. Approximately 0.5-μl aliquots of BchD in 6 m urea buffer (50 mm Tricine-NaOH (pH 8.0), 15 mm MgCl2, and 4 mm DTT) were refolded with rapid addition of 700 μl of variable concentrations of BchI (at least 0.5:1 BchI: BchD) on ice giving 63.3 nm BchD and incubated for 2 h. Assays were started by addition of 100 μl of BchI·BchD and 100 μl of BchH. For continuous assays, fluorescence readings using a gain of 20 were taken immediately with readings every 4–9 s. and the initial rates measured. The standard curve for continuous assays involved reacting BchI·BchD·BchH-proto with 100 μm Tween 80 and different BchH-proto concentrations until a base-line rate was reached. A linear amount of BchI·BchD·BchH-Mg-proto was made corresponding to a starting BchH-proto concentration of between 3.8 and 120 nm. The assay with 120 nm was stopped with acetone/ammonia and separated by high pressure liquid chromatography (5–67% acetonitrile over 15 min) using a previous method (35Sawicki A. Willows R.D. Biochem. J. 2007; 406: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The conversion to BchI·BchD·BchH-Mg-proto was estimated at 87% using various mixtures of proto/Mg-proto concentrations as standards. This was taken into account when the final Mg-proto standard curve was constructed over the various porphyrin concentrations. Stopped assays involved taking a 150-μl sample and adding to 150 or 200 μl of acetone/ammonia. After centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 5 min at room temperature, 250 μl of the supernatant was used for spectrofluorometry (Ex418 nm and Em595 nm for Mg-proto and Ex400 nm and Em630 nm for proto) with comparison to appropriate standard curves. Unless mentioned otherwise, all magnesium chelatase assays were performed using the continuous assay and Mg-proto formation. ATPase Malachite Green Assays—Assays containing BchI·BchD involved a 1:1 ratio of the two subunits and were refolded on ice as described for magnesium chelatase assays except that 448 nm BchI and BchD with 10 mm DTT were used. Following refolding, BchI·BchD was desalted at 30 °C using NAP-10 or PD-10 columns (GE Healthcare) to remove hydrolyzed ATP and eluted with freshly prepared buffer containing 50 mm Tricine-NaOH (pH 8.0), 15 mm MgCl2, 10 mm DTT, and 2 mm ATP. Assays were performed by addition of 180 μl of desalted BchI·BchD to 180 μl of BchH-proto prepared in 50 mm Tricine-NaOH (pH 8.0), 40 mm glycerol, 15 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT and stopped at five different time points as indicated in the figure legends. The BchH:proto ratio in the assays was 1.26:1. Assays were stopped by addition of a 300-μl sample to 24 μl of 21% (v/v) perchloric acid (ice-cold) and centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 7 min at 4 °C. To 100 μl of the supernatant was added 25 μl of freshly prepared malachite green (oxalate) reagent prepared as described previously (37Baykov A.A. Evtushenko O.A. Avaeva S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 171: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar, 38Geladopoulos T.P. Sotiroudis T.G. Evangelopoulos A.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), followed by incubation for 5 min with shaking (1200 rpm) at 20 °C, and the absorbance was read at 620 nm. A standard curve with variable concentrations of Na2HPO4 was performed at the same time. For determining the kinetic parameters, either the Michaelis-Menten equation (v = Vmax*[S]/(Km + [S])) or the Hill equation (v = Vmax*([S]n)/(k + [S]n)) was used for nonlinear regression analysis in GraphPad Prism Version 5.01 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Kinetic Properties of Magnesium Chelatase Substrates Mg2+and ATP—Magnesium is required as a cofactor for the magnesium chelatase assay, and an excess was used in all assays performed. The fits of either variable free magnesium (Mg2+) with fixed ATP or variable ATP with fixed Mg2+ were hyperbolic with the apparent Km for Mg2+ being 14-fold higher than that for ATP (Table 1). The amounts of BchI, BchD, and BchH subunits used in these assays were close to optimal (see later experiments).TABLE 1Kinetic constants of magnesium chelatase substrates Mg2+ and ATPSubstrateApparent VmaxApparent Kmnmol Mg-proto/min/nmol BchDmmFree Mg2+5.1 ± 0.11.3 ± 0.1ATP4.5 ± 0.10.091 ± 0.009 Open table in a new tab Proto in the Assay—Two separate BchH-proto preparations were used with different amounts of proto bound. The BchH subunit binds proto maximally in a 1:1 molar ratio (16Willows R.D. Gibson L.C.D. Kanangara C.G. Hunter C.N. von Wettstein D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and the first BchH used contained a 1.26:1 BchH:proto ratio and is termed near-optimal BchH, whereas the second had a 3.26:1 BchH:proto ratio and is termed proto-depleted BchH. Initial rates were ∼1.47 and 0.78 nmol of Mg-proto/min/nmol of BchD for near-optimal and proto-depleted BchH, respectively, and there was some inhibition as the proto was titrated in both cases (Fig. 1A). However, despite this slight inhibition, the additional proto was able to participate in the magnesium chelation, as a secondary rate was observed (Fig. 1B). This secondary rate, from 3 to 4.95 min, was used to determine a pseudo-Km and apparent Vmax for proto (Fig. 1C) with both near-optimal and proto-depleted BchH. Both data sets were the same (p < 0.05) with a pseudo-Km for proto of 47 ± 9 nm and an apparent Vmax of 0.057 ± 0.002 nmol of Mg-proto/min/nmol of BchD. As this apparent Vmax is the same for both BchH samples but is 14–26-fold lower than the initial rates, the rate-limiting step for the reaction appears to be proto binding to regenerate a functional BchH-proto substrate for the reaction. BchH as a Substrate—Subsequent experiments utilized BchH-proto as the sole porphyrin substrate without the addition of exogenous proto, and its fate was tested in the magnesium chelatase reaction. Near-optimal and proto-depleted BchH were tested with variable concentrations, and data were analyzed by considering total BchH (BchH containing bound proto as well as BchH with no proto bound). The v versus S curves for both BchH types were sigmoidal in both continuous assays (Hill coefficient of 1.4–1.5) (Fig. 2A) and stopped assays (Hill coefficient of 1.1–1.2) (Fig. 2B), indicating cooperativity, which is discussed further below. When taking into account total BchH, there was a higher apparent S0.5 for proto-depleted BchH compared with near-optimal BchH (181 ± 18 and 82 ± 9 nm, respectively), as shown in Fig. 2A for the continuous assay. A similar trend was seen using the stopped assay with apparent S0.5 values of 656 ± 60 and 276 ± 35 nm for the proto-depleted and near-optimal BchH subunits, respectively (Fig. 2B). The difference in apparent S0.5 between proto-depleted and near-optimal BchH suggested that the BchH subunit with no proto bound was not participating in the reaction. To test this, it was assumed that only BchH with proto bound (BchH-proto) was contributing to the reaction, and the data were reanalyzed based on the proto bound to BchH (Fig. 2, C and D). This reanalysis showed that only BchH with proto bound was participating in the reaction and that BchH without proto bound did not interfere with the reaction as shown by the identical sigmoidal curves (Fig. 2C). This was also true of the reanalysis of the stopped assays (Fig. 2, compare B and D). Therefore, BchH without proto bound did not participate and did not apparently adversely affect the magnesium chelation reaction. The remaining experiments considered only BchH-proto as a substrate when determining kinetic constants for the magnesium insertion reaction, and those experiments were performed with near-optimal BchH. The presence of the reacted BchH subunit (BchH-Mg-proto) was then tested for its effect upon a secondary addition of fresh unreacted BchH-proto. As shown in Fig. 3A, the initial magnesium chelatase reaction using 6.1 pmol of BchH-proto was allowed to continue to stationary phase before secondary additions of 3.1, 6.1, or 12.3 pmol of BchH-proto. The initial rates of chelation were 0.52–0.63 nmol of Mg-proto/min/nmol of BchD (Fig. 3B, white bars). A secondary addition of 6.1 pmol of BchH-proto gave essentially the same velocity as the initial rate (0.55 ± 0.06 nmol of Mg-proto/min/nmol of BchD) as shown in Fig. 3B (6.1 black bar). Addition of either 12.3 or 3.1 pmol of BchH-proto resulted in the expected higher and lower rates, respectively, compared with the initial rate. The porphyrins extracted following secondary additions also showed an expected increase in Mg-proto levels (Fig. 3C). These results show there is no inhibition by BchH-Mg-proto in the magnesium chelation reaction, suggesting that BchH-Mg-proto does not compete with BchH-proto in binding to the BchI·BchD complex. Assembly of the BchI·BchD Complex—The assembly of the BchI·BchD complex was investigated by varying the concentrations of the BchI and BchD subunits in the magnesium chelatase assay"
https://openalex.org/W1994050540,"This study reports that Aurora-A (Aur-A) phosphorylates Fas-associated factor-1 (FAF1) at Ser-289 and Ser-291. Forced expression of a FAF1 mutant mimicking phosphorylation at Ser-289 and Ser-291 (FAF1 DD), but not phosphorylation-deficient FAF1 (FAF1 AA), reduced Aur-A expression. However, transfection of FAF1 DD failed to reduce Aur-A expression in the presence of MG132 and MG115, indicating that this decrease is proteasome-mediated. Additionally, transfection of FAF1 DD suppressed the expression of Aur-A in ts20-BALB cells lacking E1 ubiquitin (Ub) activating enzyme activity at restrictive temperatures and also reduced the expression of Aur-A S51D, a mutant resistant to Ub-dependent degradation. Our data indicate that phosphorylated FAF1 mediates the ubiquitin-independent, proteasome-dependent degradation of Aur-A. Overexpression of FAF1 DD blocked Aur-A-induced centrosome amplification and accumulated cells in G2/M phase, representing cellular phenotypes consistent with the anticipated loss of Aur-A.

The protein is degraded via both ubiquitin (Ub)-dependent and -independent proteolysis steps. Ub-dependent degradation of Aur-A occurs in a cell cycle-dependent manner and is mediated by E3 ligase, the APC (anaphase-promoting complex) (9Taguchi S. Honda K. Sugiura K. Yamaguchi A. Furukawa K. Urano T. FEBS Lett. 2002; 519: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Degradation of Aur-A is additionally regulated by the phosphorylation status of Ser-51 residue (10Littlepage L.E. Wu H. Andresson T. Deanehan J.K. Amundadottir L.T. Ruderman J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15440-15445Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Specifically, protein phosphatase 2A dephosphorylates Ser-51, consequently promoting degradation (11Horn V. Thelu J. Garcia A. Albiges-Rizo C. Block M.R. Viallet J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 18: 1233-1241Crossref Google Scholar). In contrast, cell cycle-independent degradation of Aur-A occurs through antizyme1, a mediator of the Ub-independent protein degradation (12Lim S.K. Gopalan G. Biochem. J. 2007; 403: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Aur-A kinase interacting protein 1 (AURKAIP) seems to promote the antizyme1-mediated degradation (13Lim S.K.

For instance, FAF1 enhances caspase-8 assembly in response to the Fas signal (15Ryu S.W. Lee S.J. Park M.Y. Jun J.I. Jung Y.K. Kim E. J. Biol.

Other studies show that FAF1 suppresses nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activation by disrupting IκB kinase complex assembly and preventing nuclear translocation of NF-κB RelA (p65) in a stimulation-dependent manner (17Park M.Y.

Moreover, FAF1 inhibits the chaperone activities of valosin-containing protein and Hsp70 (19Song E.J. Yim S.H. Kim E. Kim N.S. Lee K.J. Mol. Cell.

The phosphorylation status of FAF1 does not seem to affect Fas signaling (22Olsen B.B. Jessen V. Hojrup P. Issinger O.G. Boldyreff B. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 218-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) but sensitizes cells to various DNA-damaging agents (23Guerra B. Boldyreff B. Issinger O.G. Int. J. Oncol. 2001; 19: 1117-1126PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanisms and physiological implications of FAF1 phosphorylation await further investigation. In this study we demonstrate that Aur-A phosphorylates FAF1. The phosphorylated FAF1, in turn, mediates the Ub-independent, proteasome-dependent degradation of Aur-A, representing a negative feedback regulatory mechanism. Our data also provide an example of a cell cycle promoting kinase performing an anti-proliferative role. Cell Lines and Treatments—Stable Aur-A knock-down cell lines were generated by transfecting HeLa cells with pSuper-puro-Aur-A small interfering RNA (siRNA) plasmid. Colonies displaying resistance to puromycin (5 μg/ml) were clonally isolated and subjected to immunoblotting and immunofluorescence assays with the anti-Aur-A antibody to screen for the suppression of Aur-A expression. The ts20-BALB cells were kindly provided by Dr. Harvey Ozer (International Center for Public Health). Taxol, aphidicolin, MG132, and MG115 were purchased from Sigma. VX680 was provided by CrystalGenomics, Inc (Seoul, Korea). For synchronization at the G1/S boundary, cells were incubated with medium containing 1 μg/ml aphidicolin for 13 h. To block proteasome-mediated protein degradation, cells were treated with 20 μm MG132 for 3 h or 50 μm MG115 for 3 h, respectively. Plasmid Construction, Mutagenesis, and RNA Interference—FAF1 and its deletion mutants were generated in the pGex 4T-1 vector using standard PCR techniques employing custom-designed primers containing appropriate restriction site. Aur-A and its deletion constructs were cloned into the FLAG vector. Purified GST-tagged Aurora kinases were purchased from MBL (Hamamatsu, Japan). The FAF1 substitution mutants S289A, S291A, S289A/S291A, and S289D/S291D were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Aur-A siRNA targeting the sequence 5′-ATTCTTCCCAGCGCGTTCC-3′ and scrambled siRNA were provided by Qiagen Inc. (Valencia, CA). For Aur-A knock-down stable cell line, the pSuper-puro-Aur-A siRNA plasmid was generated using the Aur-A siRNA targeting the sequence 5′-ACAAGCCGGTTCAGAATCA-3′. The pSuper-puro vector was purchased from Oligoengine (Seattle, WA). Antibodies—Mouse anti-FAF1 antibody was provided by Dr. Jong-Seok Lim (Sookmyung Women's University, Seoul, Korea). Anti-P-FAF1 antibody was raised in a rabbit against a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 284–295 of human FAF1 (phosphorylated at Ser-289 and Ser-291) and further purified by affinity chromatography (AbFrontier, Seoul, Korea). Anti-FLAG, anti-γ-tubulin, and anti-mouse TRITC-conjugated IgG antibodies were obtained from Sigma. Anti-Aur-A and anti-p53 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Technology (Santa Cruz, CA). The anti-GAPDH antibody was acquired from AbFrontier. Immunoprecipitation—HeLa cells were either treated with taxol or left untreated. Cells were lysed in mammalian lysis buffer (17Park M.Y. Jang H.D. Lee S.Y. Lee K.J. Kim E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2544-2549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), sonicated, and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Cell lysates were incubated for 6 h at 4 °C with anti-FAF1 or anti-Aur-A antibody and protein A/G-Sepharose beads (Santa Cruz Technology) and immunoprecipitated. Immunoprecipitates and whole cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, separated, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. Glutathione S-Transferase Pulldown Assay—For identification of the FAF1 domain interacting with Aur-A, GST full-length FAF1 and truncated mutant proteins were purified from bacteria using glutathione-Sepharose beads (17Park M.Y. Jang H.D. Lee S.Y. Lee K.J. Kim E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2544-2549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins were incubated with taxol-treated HeLa cell lysates for 4 h at 4 °C. Samples were washed with lysis buffer. Bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by immunoblotting with an anti-Aur-A antibody. To determine the Aur-A domain interacting with FAF1, HeLa cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged full-length Aur-A and deletion constructs using METAFECTENE (Biontex, Munich, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. At 36 h after transfection, cells were treated with taxol (500 nm) for 12 h. Cell lysates were incubated with GST-FAF1 fusion proteins for 4 h at 4 °C. After extensive washing with lysis buffer, samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, separated, and immunoblotted with an anti-FLAG antibody. In Vitro Kinase Assay—HeLa cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged FAF1 wild-type (WT) and mutants. 36 h after transfection, cells were treated with taxol for 12 h. Whole cell lysates were incubated with anti-Aur-A antibody and protein A/G-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 6 h. Immunoprecipitated Aur-A proteins were incubated with myelin basic protein (Sigma) in kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 100 mm ATP). After 30 min at 30 °C, the reactions were mixed with equal volumes of protein loading buffer, and the phosphorylated substrates were detected by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. For phosphorylation site mapping of FAF1, recombinant GST-tagged FAF1 were incubated with GST-tagged recombinant Aur-A in kinase buffer coupled with 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 30 min. After reaction, the bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Gel Filtration Chromatography—HeLa cells were transfected with 5 μg of vector, FLAG-FAF1 AA, or FAF1 DD. Cells were lysed in a buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1% CHAPS) and clarified by centrifugation at 30,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. Cell extracts were fractionated on a Superose 6 column with aÄKTA fast protein liquid chromatography system (GE Healthcare). 2 ml of cell lysates (3 mg of total proteins) was loaded onto the column and separated at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The molecular mass standards (GE Healthcare) used to calibrate the column were blue dextran (2000 kDa), thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), albumin (67 kDa), and ribonuclease A (13 kDa). Immunofluorescence Staining of Centrosomes—HeLa cells transfected with the indicated plasmids and GFP were placed on sterile coverslips within 6-well plates. After 12 h, cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature and washed with PBS. Cells were incubated with anti-γ-tubulin antibody for 45 min, washed with PBS, and treated with TRITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody for 30 min. Cells were washed three times with PBS and mounted on slides. Color images were acquired using a Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 laser scanning confocal microscope (Bio-Rad). Centrosomes were visualized by staining with the anti-γ-tubulin antibody and counted. Centrosomes of GFP-positive cells were randomly selected. Flow Cytometry—Cells were co-transfected with GFP and FLAG-FAF1 mutants. After 24 h HeLa cells were treated with aphidicolin (1 μg/ml) for 13 h, released by washing, and maintained in fresh medium. 13 h after release from the aphidicolin block, cells were assessed by propidium iodide (PI) staining and flow cytometry (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences). Briefly, cells were harvested and fixed with 70% ethanol overnight at −20 °C. Fixed cells were washed twice in PBS, resuspended in PI staining solution (50 μg/ml PI, 100 μg/ml RNase), and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C before analysis. The GFP-positive cell population was determined by FACS analysis. Interactions between FAF1 and Aur-A—To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying reduced FAF1 expression in gastric tumor tissues (24Bjørling-Poulsen M. Seitz G. Guerra B. Issinger O.G. Int. J. Oncol. 2003; 23: 1015-1023PubMed Google Scholar), we screened for FAF1-interactors among cDNAs displaying differential expression patterns in gastric cancer tissues of Korean patients when compared with their normal counterparts. Briefly, differentially expressed genes in korean gastric cancer tissues were translated in vitro, and the GST pulldown assay was performed between GST-tagged FAF1-DEDID (death effector domain-interacting domain; residues 181–381), which is essential for cell death mediation (25Ryu S.W. Kim E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 1027-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and the in vitro translated genes. Several proteins interacting with FAF1-DEDID were identified, including Aur-A. The Aur-A expression level was examined in the Korean gastric cancer tissues. Aur-A expression profiles of matching gastric tumor and normal tissues of 57 Korean patients were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. We graded the staining intensity as the following: negative (score 0), weak (score 1), moderate (score 2), and strong (score 3) (supplemental Fig. S1A). A significant proportion of gastric tumor tissue specimens (42/57, 73.7%) showed moderate to strong Aur-A staining (score 2 and 3). In contrast, only 7 in 57 samples (12.3%) showed moderate Aur-A staining in gastric normal tissues. No gastric normal tissue demonstrated strong Aur-A staining. Therefore, our data clearly show that Aur-A expression is elevated in the cancer tissues of Korean gastric cancer patients. Next, the interaction between FAF1 and Aur-A was examined in the gastric tumors. Consistent with the previous studies, decreased expression of FAF1 and increased expression of Aur-A were observed in the gastric tumor tissues (3Kamada K. Yamada Y. Hirao T. Fujimoto H. Takahama Y. Ueno M. Takayama T. Hirao S. Nakajima Y. Oncol. Rep. 2004; 12: 593-599PubMed Google Scholar, 24Bjørling-Poulsen M. Seitz G. Guerra B. Issinger O.G. Int. J. Oncol. 2003; 23: 1015-1023PubMed Google Scholar). Aur-A immunoprecipitates were prepared from two matching gastric normal and tumor tissues and immunoblotting with the anti-FAF1 antibody. Binding of Aur-A to FAF1 was significantly increased in the gastric tumor tissues when compared with that in the gastric normal tissues (supplemental Fig. S1B). Therefore, FAF1-Aur-A interaction occurs in the clinical situation. FAF1-Aur-A interactions were further examined in HeLa cells (Fig. 1A). Immunoprecipitation and subsequent immunoblotting with the anti-FAF1 or anti-Aur-A antibody disclosed that FAF1 and Aur-A did not interact in untreated HeLa cells. However, FAF1 and Aur-A formed complexes in taxol-treated HeLa cells. Moreover, interaction between FAF1 and Aur-A were induced in diverse stress such as etoposide, doxorubicin, and camptothecin (data not shown), implying that interactions between these proteins are enhanced in a stimulus-dependent manner. To determine the FAF1 domain responsible for binding to Aur-A, the GST pulldown assay was performed using GST-tagged FAF1 truncated mutants encompassing the N terminus (residues 1–180), DEDID, and C terminus (residues 382–650) with taxol-treated HeLa cell lysates. Aur-A bound specifically to FAF1-DEDID but not to N or C terminus (Fig. 1B). To further map the Aur-A domain responsible for interactions with FAF1, a GST pulldown assay was performed using GST-tagged FAF1 and taxol-treated HeLa cell lysates transfected with FLAG-tagged Aur-A deletion constructs. The Aur-A C terminus (kinase domain, residues 133–403) bound to FAF1 but not the N terminus (residues 1–132) (Fig. 1C). Aur-A Phosphorylates FAF1 at Ser-289 and Ser-291—Next, we investigated whether FAF1-Aur-A interactions were associated with the phosphorylation of FAF1. Anti-FAF1 antibody detected two bands in taxol-treated HeLa cells (Fig. 2A). To determine whether the upper band is the phosphorylated protein, we incubated the taxol-treated HeLa cell lysates with the λ-protein phosphatase. λ-protein phosphatase eradicated the upper band, implying that it is the phosphorylated FAF1 (P-FAF1). Next, we have raised a polyclonal antibody against a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 284–295 of FAF1 (phosphorylated at Ser-289 and Ser-291) (anti-P-FAF1 antibody), based on the previous identification of Ser-289 and Ser-291 as phosphorylation sites of FAF1 using mass spectrometry analysis (21Jensen H.H. Hjerrild M. Guerra B. Larsen M.R. Hojrup P. Boldyreff B. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 577-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The presence of P-FAF1 was reconfirmed by anti-P-FAF1 antibody (Fig. 2A, left panel). Next, we examined whether Aur-A is responsible for the phosphorylation of FAF1. Cells were transfected with Aur-A-specific siRNA (siAur-A) for transient depletion or vector-based siRNA against Aur-A (pSuper-puro-Aur-A) followed by selection with puromycin for stable depletion. FAF1 phosphorylation was clearly inhibited in cells both transiently and stably depleted of Aur-A (Fig. 2A) in taxol-treated HeLa cells. The addition of VX680, a specific Aurora kinase inhibitor, to taxol-treated HeLa cells also suppressed phosphorylation of FAF1 (Fig. 2B). The Aur-A kinase assay was performed in vitro using GST-FAF1 as the substrate. Aur-A, but not Aur-B or Aur-C, phosphorylated GST-FAF1 in vitro, implying that FAF1 is an Aur-A-specific substrate (supplemental Fig. S2). Phosphorylation was blocked by treatment with VX680 (Fig. 2C). To assess whether Ser-289 and Ser-291, previously identified phosphorylation sites (21Jensen H.H. Hjerrild M. Guerra B. Larsen M.R. Hojrup P. Boldyreff B. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 577-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), are phosphorylated by Aur-A, GST fusion proteins of single (S289A or S291A) and double (S289A/S291A) FAF1 substitution mutants were generated. Single substitutions (S289A and S291A) failed to block FAF1 phosphorylation completely. Notably, the mutation at position 291 inhibited Aur-A phosphorylation to a greater extent than at 289. In contrast, double substitution (S289A/S291A) abolished FAF1 phosphorylation almost completely (Fig. 2D). Our results indicate that both serine residues of FAF1 are phosphorylated by Aur-A. It is worth mentioning that these serines are not embedded in the consensus motif of Aur-A substrates, (R/K)X1–3(S/T) (26Meraldi P. Honda R. Nigg E.A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Phosphorylations of proteins by Aur-A without the consensus motif have been shown in p53 and BRCA1 (27Katayama H. Sasai K. Kawai H.

P-FAF1 Mediates the Ub-independent, Proteasome-dependent Degradation of Aur-A—To explore the implications of the interaction between FAF1 and Aur-A, we overexpressed FAF1 and Aur-A in HeLa cells. Overexpression of FAF1 and Aur-A allowed their interactions without taxol treatment (data not shown). HeLa cells transfected with FAF1 WT, FAF1 AA (FAF1 S289A/S291A), and FAF1 DD (FAF1 S289D/S291D) displayed differential Aur-A expression patterns. Aur-A expression was significantly decreased in cells transfected with FAF1 WT or FAF1 DD in a dose-dependent manner but not FAF1 AA (Fig. 3A and supplemental Fig, S3). Consistent with these findings, Aur-A kinase activity was reduced in cells transfected with FAF1 WT and FAF1 DD (supplemental Fig. S3). These results demonstrate that the phosphorylation status of FAF1 regulates Aur-A expression. The depletion of FAF1 increased the protein level of Aur-A when taxol was treated (supplemental Fig. S4). Concomitant with the increased level of Aur-A, the kinase activity of Aur-A was also increased in the FAF1-depleted cells. Next, we asked whether P-FAF1 reduces Aur-A expression via regulation of the protein degradation pathway. The decrease in Aur-A expression in FAF1 DD-transfected HeLa cells was significantly inhibited after treatment with the proteasome inhibitors, MG132 and MG115 (Fig. 3B). Previous studies show that Aur-A is degraded both via Ub-dependent and -independent pathways (12Lim S.K. Gopalan G. Biochem. J. 2007; 403: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 13Lim S.K. Gopalan G. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 6593-6603Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we asked through which pathway FAF1-mediated Aur-A decreases. We examined whether degradation of Aur-A occurs in ts20-BALB cells lacking E1 Ub-activating enzyme activity at the restrictive temperatures (29Chowdary D.R. Dermody J.J. Jha K.K. Ozer H.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1997-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). In ts20-BALB cells, FAF1 DD mediated Aur-A degradation at the restrictive temperature (39 °C) as effectively as that at the permissive temperature (35 °C), whereas the p53 level remained unchanged at 39 °C (Fig. 3C). Moreover, expression of the Aur-AS51D mutant resistant to Ub-dependent degradation (10Littlepage L.E. Wu H. Andresson T. Deanehan J.K. Amundadottir L.T. Ruderman J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15440-15445Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) was suppressed by transfection of FAF1 DD (Fig. 3D). Our data indicate that the FAF1-mediated Aur-A decrease occurs through an Ub-independent, proteasome-mediated degradation pathway. Next, we examined whether the presence of P-FAF1 influences the protein complexes containing Aur-A. HeLa cell lysates were prepared from transfectants containing the vector control (MOCK), FLAG-FAF1 AA, or FLAG-FAF1 DD and subjected to gel filtration chromatography on a Superose 6 column (Fig. 3E). Aur-A exhibited a broad size distribution, roughly corresponding to 2000 to 67 kDa in the MOCK- and FLAG-FAF1 AA-transfected HeLa cells. Transfection of FLAG-FAF1 DD markedly decreased Aur-A expression when compared with MOCK- or FLAG-FAF1 AA-transfections, especially in the protein complexes with molecular weight of ∼440 to 67 kDa. In contrast, Aur-A in the high molecular mass complex (∼2000 kDa) was decreased by FLAG-FAF1 AA-transfection but not by FLAG-FAF1 DD-transfection. However, molecular mechanism and biological implication of the differential protection of Aur-A in the molecular mass complex (∼2000 kDa) by FAF1 AA- or FAF1 DD-transfection needs further investigation. FAF1 Antagonizes Aur-A-induced Centrosome Amplification—Overexpression of Aur-A is associated with centrosome abnormalities (30Shao S. Wang Y. Jin S. Song Y. Wang X. Fan W. Xu N. Zhan Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28943-28950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thus, the physiological implications of FAF1-Aur-A interactions were further examined in HeLa cells. Specifically, HeLa cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged FAF1 WT, AA, and DD, respectively, together with FLAG-tagged Aur-A and GFP, and centrosome copies were analyzed at 48 h post-transfection. Aur-A-transfected HeLa cells exhibited centrosome amplification, as reflected by the findings that 52.4 ± 4.9% of cells expressing Aur-A contained at least three copies of the centrosome (Fig. 4). However, the population of HeLa cells with three or more copies of centrosome was reduced to 28.2 ± 2.1 and 16.8 ± 0.4% upon co-transfection of FLAG-tagged Aur-A with FAF1 WT and FAF1 DD, respectively. Consistently, transfection of FAF1 AA reduced centrosome amplification to a much lower degree (43.2 ± 3.3%). These findings indicate that P-FAF1 antagonizes centrosome amplification induced by Aur-A. Phosphorylation of FAF1 Induces G2/M Arrest—Next, we investigated the biological effects of FAF1 phosphorylation on G2/M progression in which Aur-A plays an essential role. To that end, HeLa cells were transiently transfected with FLAG-tagged FAF1 WT, AA, or DD, and cell cycle profiles of each transfectant were determined by FACS analyses after 13 h release from the aphidicolin block. The increase of cells in the G2/M phase with a parallel depletion of cells in the G0/G1 phase was observed in FAF1 WT- and FAF1 DD-transfected cells when compared with that in MOCK-transfected cells (Fig. 5). However, accumulation of cells in the G2/M phase in FAF1 AA-transfected cells was much less than those in FAF1 WT and DD-transfected cells. Our data collectively demonstrate that P-FAF1 induces the cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase. In this study we show that FAF1, a novel substrate of Aur-A, functions as an endogenous negative regulator of Aur-A. The enhanced interactions in the gastric tumor tissues between Aur-A and FAF1 suggest that the functional interplay might be more significant under pathological conditions. Our findings provide a molecular explanation for the transition from cell cycle arrest to cell death in the response to stimulus. Aur-A is a well characterized oncoprotein that is highly expressed in various cancers (1Bischoff J.R. Anderson L. Zhu Y. Mossie K. Ng L. Souza B. Schryver B. Flanagan P. Clairvoyant F. Ginther C.

Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 5362-5370Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In this regard, regulation of the Aur-A level is important in maintaining normal cellular physiology. Negative regulators of Aur-A target its degradation mechanisms. For instance, protein phosphatase 2A promotes degradation of Aur-A through the ubiquitination pathway (10Littlepage L.E. Wu H. Andresson T. Deanehan J.K. Amundadottir L.T. Ruderman J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15440-15445Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Antizyme1 mediates, and AURKAIP1 (Aur-A kinase interacting protein 1) potentiates Ub-independent degradation of Aur-A even though the effects of AURKAIP are somewhat controversial (12Lim S.K. Gopalan G. Biochem. J. 2007; 403: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 13Lim S.K. Gopalan G. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 6593-6603Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 14Katayama H. Sasai K. Czerniak B.A. Carter J.L. Sen S. J. Cell. Biochem. 2007; 102: 1318-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that FAF1 also mediates degradation of Aur-A independently of Ub. The main difference between FAF1 and other negative regulators against Aur-A is that FAF1 is a direct substrate of Aur-A, and thus, suppression of Aur-A via its own substrate establishes an auto-regulatory feedback. FAF1 interacts with valosin-containing protein, the multiubiquitin chain-targeting factor, and inhibits the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins via a proteasome-mediated pathway (19Song E.J. Yim S.H. Kim E. Kim N.S. Lee K.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2511-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Our data show that FAF1 is involved in the other branch of Aur-A degradation, specifically the Ub-independent pathway. FAF1 may inhibit Ub-dependent, but potentiate Ub-independent degradation of certain proteins. It is tempting to speculate that FAF1 functions as a switch to turn off the Ub-dependent pathway and turn on the Ub-independent system, depending on the situation. At present, the mechanism by which FAF1 enhances Ub-independent protein degradation and other proteins whose degradation is regulated by FAF1 remains to be established. It is worth mentioning that the degradation of Aur-A mainly occurred in the protein complexes with molecular masses of ∼440 to 67 kDa. The reason for the persistence of Aur-A in the complex with a molecular mass of ∼2000 kDa upon FAF1 DD-transfection is not yet clear. Considering that transfection of FAF1 DD antagonizes canonical functions of Aur-A such as centrosome amplification and cell cycle progression, Aur-A in the complex with a molecular mass of ∼2000 kDa might perform novel function distinguished from the known ones. Further study would be necessary to elucidate the function of Aur-A in the high molecular might complex. Interactions between FAF1 and binding partners in cells are often triggered in response to stimuli, such as Fas and tumor necrosis factor-α (15Ryu S.W. Lee S.J. Park M.Y. Jun J.I. Jung Y.K. Kim E. J.

In untreated cells, FAF1 may not be freely accessible due to specific masking proteins that prevent interactions with other proteins. Hsp70 is a possible candidate for the masking role, as it interacts with FAF1 in untreated cells (20Kim H.J. Song E.J. Lee Y.S. Kim E. Lee K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8125-8133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Hsp70 acts as a masking protein for death proteins such as Bax and Apaf-1, preventing the translocation of Bax to mitochondria and interactions of Apaf-1 with caspase-9 (31Saleh A. Srinivasula S.M. Balkir L. Robbins P.D. Alnemri E.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 476-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar, 32Stankiewicz A.R. Lachapelle G. Foo C.P. Radicioni S.M. Mosser D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38729-38739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of substrate proteins by Aur-A often regulates their stability. Aur-A phosphorylates p53 and hepatoma up-regulated protein (HURP), leading to p53 degradation and HURP stabilization, respectively (27Katayama H. Sasai K. Kawai H. Yuan Z.M. Bondaruk J. Suzuki F.

Biol. 2005; 25: 5789-5800Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). However, we did not observe any changes in the FAF1 protein level in association with its phosphorylation status. Instead, phosphorylation by Aur-A appears to endow “gain of function” to FAF1. Our preliminary analyses show that the introduction of FAF1 DD sensitizes cells to taxol (data not shown). Accordingly, we speculate that the phosphorylation event affords FAF1 an alternative function in addition to mediating the degradation of Aur-A. It is possible that phosphorylation of FAF1 allows or facilitates interactions with its partners which promote cell death. We thank Dr. Harvey Ozer for providing the ts20-BALB cell line.

https://openalex.org/W2079766592,"DM-GRASP, cell adhesion molecule of the immunoglobulin superfamily, has been shown to promote growth and navigation of axons. We here demonstrate that clustering of DM-GRASP in the plasma membrane induces its rapid internalization via dynamin- and clathrin-dependent endocytosis, which is controlled by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK. The clustering of DM-GRASP activates ERK; the intensity and duration of ERK activation by DM-GRASP do not depend on rapid clathrin-mediated internalization of DM-GRASP. Moreover, the preference of retinal ganglion cell axons for DM-GRASP-coated micro-lanes requires clathrin-mediated endocytosis for the appropriate axonal turning reactions at substrate borders. Because the intracellular domain of DM-GRASP does not contain motifs for direct interactions with the endocytosis machinery, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify intracellular proteins mediating the uptake of DM-GRASP and isolated ubiquitin. Immunoprecipitation of DM-GRASP coexpressed with ubiquitin revealed that one or two ubiquitin(s) are attached to the intracellular domain of cell surface-resident DM-GRASP. Furthermore, elevated ubiquitination levels result in a decrease of cell surface-resident DM-GRASP as well as in the amount of total DM-GRASP. The endocytosis rate is not affected, but the delivery to multivesicular bodies is increased, indicating that DM-GRASP ubiquitination enhances its sorting into the degradation pathway. Together, our data show that ubiquitination and endocytosis of DM-GRASP in concert regulate its cell surface concentration, which is crucial for its function in axon navigation.

Sci. 2002; 43: 1488-1492PubMed Google Scholar). DM-GRASP is an integral membrane protein of 100 kDa with a very short cytoplasmic domain (2Burns F.R. von Kannen S. Guy L. Raper J.A. Kamholz J. Chang S. Neuron. 1991; 7: 209-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), which makes it, together with two Ig domains of the rare V-type, an unusual member among the IgSF-CAMs. IgSF-CAMs display spatially and temporally dynamic, discrete expression patterns during development and mediate (homophilic and heterophilic) cell-cell and cell-substrate interactions. For the formation of a functional neuronal network, the motile, sensory tip of the elongating axons, the growth cone, rapidly reacts to environmental cues. To regulate adhesion and intracellular signaling pathways triggered by surface-resident IgSF-CAMs, the regulation of their density and presence on the growth cone is thought to be crucial. This could be achieved by a balanced integration of synthesized/recycled IgSF-CAMs into the plasma membrane and their endocytosis. Clathrin-dependent endocytosis and recycling has been found for L1/NgCAM or NCAM (22Kamiguchi H. Lemmon V. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3749-3756Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Minana R. Duran J.M. Tomas M. Renau-Piqueras J. Guerri C. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2001; 13: 749-756Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the formation of clathrin-coated pits, clathrin coassembles with adaptor proteins that form a link between the clathrin lattice and the plasma membrane proteins (24Chang M.P. Mallet W.G. Mostov K.E. Brodsky F.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2169-2180Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) by recognizing specific sites in their cytoplasmic domains, e.g. tyrosine-based sequences or dileucine motifs (25Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 575-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar). To pinch off the membrane, dynamin self-assembles into rings around the neck of the clathrin-coated pits, and coated vesicles are formed (26Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 190-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 27Takei K. McPherson P.S. Schmid S.L. De Camilli P. Nature. 1995; 374: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). For transmembrane proteins lacking any adaptor-binding site, mono-ubiquitination, the addition of a single ubiquitin to their cytoplasmic domain, can serve as an internalization signal (28Hicke L. Dunn R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 141-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin is attached by a ligase to a lysine residue in the target protein, which is then recruited to coated pits via proteins that contain ubiquitin recognition domains and bind to clathrin-associated proteins, e.g. Eps15 and epsin (28Hicke L. Dunn R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 141-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). E-Cadherin, α5 integrin, receptor tyrosine kinases, and ion channels have been shown to be ubiquitinated prior to their internalization via clathrin-coated pits (29Fujita Y. Krause G. Scheffner M.

Neuron. 2002; 35: 107-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar); IgSF-CAMs have not been investigated with respect to ubiquitination until now. DM-GRASP does not possess any adaptor-binding sites nor consensus sequences for potential interaction partners in its 35-amino acid cytoplasmic domain. In the present study, we investigated how the presence of DM-GRASP in the plasma membrane is regulated by internalization; DM-GRASP is internalized by a dynaminand clathrin-dependent endocytosis in growth cones and critically depends on the activity of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) ERK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). We show that regulated internalization of DM-GRASP is pivotal for the orientation of axons along DM-GRASP lanes. In a screen for binding partners of the intracellular domain of DM-GRASP, we found, among others, ubiquitin. We also demonstrate that DM-GRASP is indeed ubiquitinated and that this affects intracellular trafficking. Ubiquitin-regulated endocytosis of DM-GRASP might thus be involved in the dynamic regulation of DM-GRASP functions in navigating growth cones.

The following cDNAs were used for expression in mouse N2a neuroblastoma cells or human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells: pMIW-DM-GRASP (Hideaki Tanaka, Kumamoto University, Honjo, Japan), pCMV-SPORT-ALCAM (Deutsches Resourcenzentrum für Genomforschung), pcDNA3-dynamin and pcDNA3-dynamin(K44A) (Sandra Schmid, The Scripps Institutes), and pcDNA3-FLAG-ubiquitin (Ivan Dikic, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany). All of the inhibitors were purchased from Calbiochem. Retinal Single Cell Cultures—Single cell cultures of embryonic day 6 retina were prepared as described (9Avci H.X. Zelina P. Thelen K. Pollerberg G.E. Dev. Biol. 2004; 271: 291-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 35Zelina P. Avci H.X. Thelen K. Pollerberg G.E. Development. 2005; 132: 3609-3618Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The cultures were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min and stained by indirect immunofluorescence as described (36Pollerberg E.G. Sadoul R. Goridis C. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 1921-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence Detection of DM-GRASP Endocytosis—For differential labeling of cell surface DM-GRASP and endocytosed DM-GRASP in living cells, a modification of the method of Needham et al. (37Needham L.K. Thelen K. Maness P.F. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1490-1500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used; 24 h after transfection (Lipofectamine; Invitrogen), N2a cells were plated on glass coverslips coated with poly-l-lysine (50,000 cells/coverslip), and nontransfected retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) were seeded on laminin-coated coverslips (30,000 cells/coverslip). 24 h after seeding, cells were incubated with 20 μg/ml immunoaffinity-purified polyclonal DM-GRASP antibody (9Avci H.X. Zelina P. Thelen K. Pollerberg G.E. Dev. Biol. 2004; 271: 291-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) for 5-30 min at 37 °C to allow for endocytosis of the complexes formed by cell surface DM-GRASP and DM-GRASP antibodies; for controls (0 min), the cells were not treated with DM-GRASP antibodies. To stop endocytosis, the cells were fixed for 20 min with 4% paraformaldehyde. To visualize all of the DM-GRASP proteins (clustered and nonclustered) present on the cell surface, the cells were labeled with the same polyclonal DM-GRASP antibody as used for triggering endocytosis. DM-GRASP-antibody complexes present at the cell surface were then labeled by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate- or Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies. Any remaining unlabeled cell surface DM-GRASP-antibody complexes, which had not been saturated by secondary antibodies, were blocked by 200 μg/ml goat anti-mouse IgGs for 1 h. The cells were again treated with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min to fix the cell surface-labeled DM-GRASP-antibody complexes and were then permeabilized by 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 h. The cells were blocked by 10% goat serum for 30 min, and the internalized DM-GRASP-antibody complexes were labeled by Texas Red- or Alexa 546-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies. After additional washing steps, the coverslips were mounted with Mowiol and were viewed in an inverted microscope (Axiovert 200M; Zeiss) equipped with a digital camera (AxioCam; Zeiss). All of the micrographs and quantification of N2a cells shown were taken from the equatorial plane as determined in phase contrast with a focal depth of 1 μm (38Holton K.L. Loder M.K. Melikian H.E. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 881-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Quantification of Fluorescence Intensity—Using phase contrast optics to avoid biased selection, 18 or more growth cones/sample group were randomly selected. Then fluorescent images were captured, with exposure time being kept constant and taking care to avoid pixel saturation. For quantification of fluorescence intensity, the growth cone outlines were traced on the phase contrast images by ImageJ and superimposed on the fluorescent images, and the fluorescent intensity within the growth cone was determined, giving a measurement of pixel intensity/unit area. The background fluorescence intensities were measured in an adjacent area clear of cellular material and subtracted from the growth cone reading, yielding the background-corrected intensity. Statistical analyses were performed using the t test. DM-GRASP Internalization and Cell Surface Biotinylation Assay—To quantify DM-GRASP endocytosis, the proteins remaining on the cell surface after exposure to the DM-GRASP antibody were labeled by a membrane-impermeant biotinylation reagent. For this, cells in 35-mm tissue culture dishes were incubated for 1 h in presence of the indicated inhibitor before the onset of the experiment. The inhibitors used were PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (10 μm), MEK inhibitor U0126 (10 μm), protein kinase C inhibitor bis-indolylmaleimide (1 μm), and phospholipase D inhibitor ethanol (0.5%). The cells were kept for 30 min at 4 °C before the addition of the polyclonal DM-GRASP antibody and further incubation at 4 °C for 30 min. The cells were then washed once with medium and incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times. The cells were removed, immediately washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and kept for the rest of the experiment at 4 °C. The cells were treated with sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (1 mg/ml; Pierce) in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C for 30 min followed by washing with 100 mm glycine. The cells were solubilized with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton-X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) and then centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Biotinylated proteins were separated from nonbiotinylated proteins by incubation with avidin-agarose (Calbiochem) for 1 h at room temperature. The beads were washed five times with 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and the adsorbed proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 6% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.001% bromphenol blue). The proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then transferred to a nitrocellulose sheet. Western blot analysis with a polyclonal DM-GRASP antibody was performed as described before (9Avci H.X. Zelina P. Thelen K. Pollerberg G.E. Dev. Biol. 2004; 271: 291-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. HEK293 cells were transfected with plasmids using Lipofectamine as described (37Needham L.K. Thelen K. Maness P.F. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1490-1500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 24 h after transfection, the cell surface DM-GRASP was biotinylated and clustered by incubation with DM-GRASP antibody for 15 min. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and extracted in radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer. The cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and incubated with DM-GRASP-specific antibodies and protein A-Sepharose for 4 h at 4 °C. For deglycosylation, immunoprecipitated DM-GRASP was incubated with PNGase F (1 unit/ml) for 3 h before precipitation with avidin-agarose and Western blot. DM-GRASP was visualized with anti-DM-GRASP antibody and ubiquitin with monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase Phosphorylation—Levels of ERK phosphorylation in retinal cells were determined by Western blotting the lysates. For this, retinal cells were seeded at 106 cells/well (coated with 10 μg/μl laminin) and cultured for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum. 1-2 h before onset of the experiments, the medium was replaced with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12. The cells were preincubated with DMSO or monodansyl-cadaverine (MDC) for 60 min prior to addition of DM-GRASP clustering antibody. The cells were lysed in buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 137 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na-EDTA, 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm α-glycerophosphate, 2 nm calyculin A, and protease inhibitors. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation, and equal quantities of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and detected with the anti-phospho-ERK antibody. The membranes were then stripped and reprobed to confirm equal loading using the antibody against ERK1/2. The ratio of phospho-ERK to total ERK was determined by densitometry. Axon Preference Assay—Preference assays were performed as described (9Avci H.X. Zelina P. Thelen K. Pollerberg G.E. Dev. Biol. 2004; 271: 291-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), except that recombinant, soluble DM-GRASP (3 μg/ml) was employed (39Thelen K. Wolfram T. Maier B. Jährling J. Tinazli A. Piehler J. Spatz J.P. Pollerberg G.E. Soft Matter. 2007; 3: 1486-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). 24 h after start of the explant culture, MDC was added in a final concentration of 100 μm for an additional 24 h before fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde. A substrate lane was counted as exerting axonal preference when it contained axons/axon bundles and at the same time was neighbored by lanes containing no axons (with the exception of a very few). A retinal explant strip was considered to be showing preference if its RGC axons respected the borders of at least 50% of the lanes of a given substrate. Images were taken and assembled with a Nikon Eclipse 90i equipped with a Nikon DS-1QM camera (Nikon Imaging Center, University of Heidelberg) using the scan large image function. Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—For the yeast two-hybrid screen, an embryonic day 9.5/10.5 CD1 mouse library (a kind gift of Stefan Offermanns, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany), generated by random-primed cDNA synthesis, was used. The library pVP16 (carrying the LEU2 gene) cDNA library contains ∼5 × 106 clones with insert sizes ranging from 350 to 700 nucleotides (40Vojtek A.B. Cooper J.A. Hollenberg S.M. Bartel P.M. Fields S. The Yeast Two-hybrid System. Oxford University Press, Oxford1997: 29-42Google Scholar). As a bait, the intracellular domain of DM-GRASP fused to the LexA sequence of the pBTM116 containing the TRP1 gene was employed. The yeast two-hybrid results were confirmed by retransformation of bait (pBTMI or pBTMIII) and prey (interacting clones) vectors. DM-GRASP Is Endcytosed in the Central Domain of Growth Cones—The turnover of DM-GRASP in growth cones of extending RGC axons was studied in retinal single cell cultures (Fig. 1). Normally, DM-GRASP is distributed in a punctuate pattern over the entire cell surface of the growth cone (Fig. 1A). To trigger DM-GRASP endocytosis, it was clustered by the addition of polyclonal DM-GRASP antibody, and the internalization was analyzed by differential immunofluorescence labeling of internalized and cell surface DM-GRASP. After 10 min, cell surface DM-GRASP is enriched at neck and central domain of the growth cone, and DM-GRASP-containing vesicles are present in the central domain (Fig. 1B). After 30 min, DM-GRASP is predominantly located in vesicles, which are almost exclusively restricted to the central growth cone domain (Fig. 1C). Quantification of the internalized and cell surface DM-GRASP after clustering (Fig. 1D) reveals a swift onset of endocytosis because internalized DM-GRASP is detected already 5 min after clustering. The amount of internalized DM-GRASP increases 3-fold in the next 5 min; after 15 min the internalized DM-GRASP reaches a maximum that declines to lower levels after 30 min. Together these data indicate that clustering of DM-GRASP induces its rapid translocation into the central growth cone where it is endocytosed and removed by retrograde transport or degradation. Endocytosis of DM-GRASP Depends on Dynamin and Clathrin—To analyze the mechanisms underlying DM-GRASP endocytosis, we tested whether the disruption of dynamin function affects DM-GRASP internalization (Fig. 2). For this, N2a cells (devoid of endogenous DM-GRASP) were cotransfected with DM-GRASP and wild type (wt)-dynamin or DM-GRASP and dominant-negative (dn)-dynamin. The expressed DM-GRASP is equally distributed all over the cell surface in its typical punctuate pattern, independent of coexpression of wt-dynamin or dn-dynamin. When DM-GRASP clustering is induced by antibody addition in N2a cells expressing DM-GRASP and wt-dynamin, internalized DM-GRASP is found in vesicles located beyond the cell surface after 5 min (Fig. 2A). After 10 min, almost all DM-GRASP-containing vesicles are located in the cell center (Fig. 2B); the same distribution is observed at 15 min (Fig. 2C) as well as at 20 and 25 min (not shown). In contrast, in cells cotransfected with dn-dynamin, almost no DM-GRASP is internalized at 5 min (Fig. 2D), and the first DM-GRASP-containing vesicles appear in the vicinity of the plasma membrane only after 10 min (Fig. 2E). Within the next 5 min, more DM-GRASP is internalized, and the vesicles translocate to the central cell region (Fig. 2F) now displaying the same distribution as observed for wt-dynamin expressing N2a cells; this pattern remains stable (20 and 25 min; not shown). To quantify the time course of DM-GRASP endocytosis, the number of DM-GRASP expressing N2a cells displaying DM-GRASP-containing vesicles was determined over time (Fig. 2G). After 5 min, the fraction of dn-dynamin cotransfected cells internalizing DM-GRASP is almost five times lower than the one of wt-dynamin cells (7 ± 4 and 33 ± 13%, respectively; p < 0.05). Within the next 5 min, however, this difference decreases to only about two times because of an overly proportionate increase in the fraction of dn-dynamin cells internalizing DM-GRASP (27 ± 3 and 62 ± 3%; p < 0.0006). In the following 10 min, the number of DM-GRASP internalizing cells reaches the same level (75 ± 1 and 75 ± 12%), which does not significantly change in the following (78 ± 3 and 78 ± 10%). We next analyzed whether clathrin is involved in the internalization of DM-GRASP. For this, MDC, a specific inhibitor of clathrin-dependent endocytosis, was applied to DM-GRASP-transfected N2a cells, which were then induced to internalize DM-GRASP by antibody addition. To quantify DM-GRASP endocytosis, cell surface proteins were labeled by biotinylation and purified, and the presence of DM-GRASP was determined by densitometric evaluation of Western blots (Fig. 2H). If clathrin is not inhibited, the amount of surface DM-GRASP after 15 min is reduced to about one-third (37 ± 5%, p < 3.4 × 10-5) compared with cells not treated by antibody application and decreases to about one-fifth after 30 min (22 ± 9%, p < 0.007). Under inhibition of clathrin, surface DM-GRASP is hardly decreased (89 ± 8%, p > 0.05) 15 min after antibody application. Only after 30 min, is a significant reduction in surface DM-GRASP detected; the amount of DM-GRASP remaining on the cell surface (60 ± 8%, p < 0.003) is yet three times higher compared with the one of the same time point under control conditions (p < 0.02). Together, the results show that dynamin and clathrin are crucial for DM-GRASP internalization. The inhibition of dynamin as well as clathrin is almost completely counterbalanced by a prolonged internalization, indicating that predominantly the rapid DM-GRASP internalization depends on these two proteins. DM-GRASP Internalization Is Regulated by ERK—We next investigated the regulatory mechanisms underlying DM-GRASP endocytosis (Fig. 3). For this, N2a cells were treated with various inhibitors before the cell surface DM-GRASP was clustered, biotinylated, purified, and immunoblotted as described above. We tested protein kinase C because it enhances the association of DM-GRASP to the actin cytoskeleton (41Zimmerman A.W. Nelissen J.M. van Emst-de Vries S.E. Willems P.H. de Lange F. Collard J.G. van Leeuwen F.N. Figdor C.G. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2841-2852Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and actin association had been shown to lower the endocytosis of other CAMs. Application of protein kinase C inhibitor bis-indolylmaleimide does not affect the internalization of DM-GRASP significantly (Fig. 3A); only a quarter of DM-GRASP (25 ± 8%) remains on the cell"
https://openalex.org/W2082127471,"The characteristics of referees and the potential subsequent effects on the peer-review process are an important consideration for science since the integrity of the system depends on the appropriate evaluation of merit. In 2006, we conducted an online survey of 1334 ecologists and evolutionary biologists pertaining to the review process. Respondents were from Europe, North America and other regions of the world, with the majority from English first language countries. Women comprised a third of all respondents, consistent with their representation in the scientific academic community. Among respondents we found no correlation between the time typically taken over a review and the reported average rejection rate. On average, Europeans took longer over reviewing a manuscript than North Americans, and females took longer than males, but reviewed fewer manuscripts. Males recommended rejection of manuscripts more frequently than females, regardless of region. Hence, editors and potential authors should consider alternative sets of criteria, to what exists now, when selecting a panel of referees to potentially balance different tendencies by gender or region."
https://openalex.org/W1998307294,"Background When two tasks are presented within a short interval, a delay in the execution of the second task has been systematically observed. Psychological theorizing has argued that while sensory and motor operations can proceed in parallel, the coordination between these modules establishes a processing bottleneck. This model predicts that the timing but not the characteristics (duration, precision, variability…) of each processing stage are affected by interference. Thus, a critical test to this hypothesis is to explore whether the qualitiy of the decision is unaffected by a concurrent task. Methodology/Principal Findings In number comparison–as in most decision comparison tasks with a scalar measure of the evidence–the extent to which two stimuli can be discriminated is determined by their ratio, referred as the Weber fraction. We investigated performance in a rapid succession of two non-symbolic comparison tasks (number comparison and tone discrimination) in which error rates in both tasks could be manipulated parametrically from chance to almost perfect. We observed that dual-task interference has a massive effect on RT but does not affect the error rates, or the distribution of errors as a function of the evidence. Conclusions/Significance Our results imply that while the decision process itself is delayed during multiple task execution, its workings are unaffected by task interference, providing strong evidence in favor of a sequential model of task execution."
https://openalex.org/W1968564050,"This manuscript describes a novel strategy to improve HIV DNA vaccine design. Employing a new information theory based bioinformatic algorithm, we identify a set of nucleotide motifs which are common in the coding region of HIV, but are under-represented in genes that are highly expressed in the human genome. We hypothesize that these motifs contribute to the poor protein expression of gag, pol, and env genes from the c-DNAs of HIV clinical isolates. Using this approach and beginning with a codon optimized consensus gag gene, we recode the nucleotide sequence so as to remove these motifs without modifying the amino acid sequence. Transfecting the recoded DNA sequence into a human kidney cell line results in doubling the gag protein expression level compared to the codon optimized version. We then turn both sequences into DNA vaccines and compare induced antibody response in a murine model. Our sequence, which has the motifs removed, induces a five-fold increase in gag antibody response compared to the codon optimized vaccine."
https://openalex.org/W2057264691,"Streptococcus pneumoniae is the major cause of community-acquired pneumonia and is also associated with bronchitis, meningitis, otitis and sinusitis. The emergence and increasing prevalence of resistance to penicillin and other antibiotics has led to interest in other anti-pneumonococcal drugs such as quinolones that target the enzymes DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. During crystallization and in the avenues to finding a method to determine phases for the structure of the ParC55 breakage-reunion domain of topoisomerase IV from Streptococcus pneumoniae, obstacles were faced at each stage of the process. These problems included: majority of the crystals being twinned, either non-diffracting or exhibiting a high mosaic spread. The crystals, which were grown under conditions that favoured diffraction, were difficult to flash-freeze without loosing diffraction. The initial structure solution by molecular replacement failed and the approach proved to be unviable due to the complexity of the problem. In the end the successful structure solution required an in-depth data analysis and a very detailed molecular replacement search.Crystal anti-twinning agents have been tested and two different methods of flash freezing have been compared. The fragility of the crystals did not allow the usual method of transferring the crystals into the heavy atom solution. Consequently, it was necessary to co-crystallize in the presence of the heavy atom compound. The multiple isomorphous replacement approach was unsuccessful because the 7 cysteine mutants which were engineered could not be successfully derivatized. Ultimately, molecular replacement was used to solve the structure by sorting through a large number of solutions in space group P1 using CNS.The main objective of this paper is to describe the obstacles which were faced and overcome in order to acquire data sets on such difficult crystals and determine phases for successful structure solution."
https://openalex.org/W2149544002,"Background Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE) is a DNA sequencing-based method for large-scale gene expression profiling that provides an alternative to microarray analysis. Most analyses of SAGE data aimed at identifying co-expressed genes have been accomplished using various versions of clustering approaches that often result in a number of false positives. Principal Findings Here we explore the use of seriation, a statistical approach for ordering sets of objects based on their similarity, for large-scale expression pattern discovery in SAGE data. For this specific task we implement a seriation heuristic we term ‘progressive construction of contigs’ that constructs local chains of related elements by sequentially rearranging margins of the correlation matrix. We apply the heuristic to the analysis of simulated and experimental SAGE data and compare our results to those obtained with a clustering algorithm developed specifically for SAGE data. We show using simulations that the performance of seriation compares favorably to that of the clustering algorithm on noisy SAGE data. Conclusions We explore the use of a seriation approach for visualization-based pattern discovery in SAGE data. Using both simulations and experimental data, we demonstrate that seriation is able to identify groups of co-expressed genes more accurately than a clustering algorithm developed specifically for SAGE data. Our results suggest that seriation is a useful method for the analysis of gene expression data whose applicability should be further pursued."
