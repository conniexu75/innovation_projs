https://openalex.org/W2027237652,The ability of silver iodide to cause freezing of supercooled water is improved if up to 30 percent of the iodine atoms in the crystal are replaced with bromine atoms.
https://openalex.org/W2042502007,"If eddy mixing is about as effective on Mars as it is on Earth, then there seems to be less nitrogen present on Mars than we would expect if terrestrial-type outgassing were the source. However, in this event a nonthermal escape mechanism involving the predissociation of exospheric nitrogen can be invoked to explain the low nitrogen concentration."

https://openalex.org/W2067237130,"Micrometer-sized particles have been produced by the photolysis of water vapor at wavelengths between 1500 and 1700 angstroms. Although the composition of the particles was not determined, the rate of particle production is consistent with the efficient conversion of water photolysis products to particulate matter. Such a process may be of importance in planetary atmospheres."
https://openalex.org/W1972502950,"Sediment cores from the Arctic Ocean yield significant faunal and lithologic evidence of alternating cold and milder periods for the last 6 million years. Although high-latitude continental glaciation commenced prior to 6 million years ago, the Arctic Ocean remained free of permanent pack ice up to approximately 0.7 million years ago, after which successive ice-covered and ice-free conditions existed."

https://openalex.org/W2050613554,"Grating spectra of the North Equatorial Belt of Jupiter 4.5 and 5.1 microns, obtained with a nominal resolving power of 180, are presented. An absorption feature centered at 4.73 microns and not due to a known constituent has been found. Its possible identification is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2161072192,"A new concept in science communication will be given its first test in calendar year 1972. Primary and secondary contents of a selected subset of the world's journal literature in physics will be provided in a variety of output formats. Among them are a monthly microfilm containing the full texts of all articles in the set of journals (Current Physics Microform); an advance abstracts journal describing the articles (Current Physics Advance Abstracts); a printed, classified index of the titles of the articles (Current Physics Titles); and a computer tape index to the articles (Searchable Physics Information Notices)."
