https://openalex.org/W2047744778,"The location and mechanisms responsible for the carbon sink in northern mid-latitude lands are uncertain. Here, we used an improved estimation method of forest biomass and a 50-year national forest resource inventory in China to estimate changes in the storage of living biomass between 1949 and 1998. Our results suggest that Chinese forests released about 0.68 petagram of carbon between 1949 and 1980, for an annual emission rate of 0.022 petagram of carbon. Carbon storage increased significantly after the late 1970s from 4.38 to 4.75 petagram of carbon by 1998, for a mean accumulation rate of 0.021 petagram of carbon per year, mainly due to forest expansion and regrowth. Since the mid-1970s, planted forests (afforestation and reforestation) have sequestered 0.45 petagram of carbon, and their average carbon density increased from 15.3 to 31.1 megagrams per hectare, while natural forests have lost an additional 0.14 petagram of carbon, suggesting that carbon sequestration through forest management practices addressed in the Kyoto Protocol could help offset industrial carbon dioxide emissions."
https://openalex.org/W2133899617,"We tracked over time the conductance switching of single and bundled phenylene ethynylene oligomers isolated in matrices of alkanethiolate monolayers. The persistence times for isolated and bundled molecules in either the ON or OFF switch state range from seconds to tens of hours. When the surrounding matrix is well ordered, the rate at which the inserted molecules switch is low. Conversely, when the surrounding matrix is poorly ordered, the inserted molecules switch more often. We conclude that the switching is a result of conformational changes in the molecules or bundles, rather than electrostatic effects of charge transfer."
https://openalex.org/W2095771230,"For the period 1980-89, we estimate a carbon sink in the coterminous United States between 0.30 and 0.58 petagrams of carbon per year (petagrams of carbon = 10(15) grams of carbon). The net carbon flux from the atmosphere to the land was higher, 0.37 to 0.71 petagrams of carbon per year, because a net flux of 0.07 to 0.13 petagrams of carbon per year was exported by rivers and commerce and returned to the atmosphere elsewhere. These land-based estimates are larger than those from previous studies (0.08 to 0.35 petagrams of carbon per year) because of the inclusion of additional processes and revised estimates of some component fluxes. Although component estimates are uncertain, about one-half of the total is outside the forest sector. We also estimated the sink using atmospheric models and the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (the tracer-transport inversion method). The range of results from the atmosphere-based inversions contains the land-based estimates. Atmosphere- and land-based estimates are thus consistent, within the large ranges of uncertainty for both methods. Atmosphere-based results for 1980-89 are similar to those for 1985-89 and 1990-94, indicating a relatively stable U.S. sink throughout the period."
https://openalex.org/W2148278340,"The frequencies of low-activity alleles of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase in humans are highly correlated with the prevalence of malaria. These “deficiency” alleles are thought to provide reduced risk from infection by the Plasmodium parasite and are maintained at high frequency despite the hemopathologies that they cause. Haplotype analysis of “A−” and ”Med“ mutations at this locus indicates that they have evolved independently and have increased in frequency at a rate that is too rapid to be explained by random genetic drift. Statistical modeling indicates that the A− allele arose within the past 3840 to 11,760 years and the Med allele arose within the past 1600 to 6640 years. These results support the hypothesis that malaria has had a major impact on humans only since the introduction of agriculture within the past 10,000 years and provide a striking example of the signature of selection on the human genome."
https://openalex.org/W2066363284,"The Arc two-component signal transduction system mediates adaptive responses of Escherichia coli to changing respiratory conditions of growth. Under anaerobic conditions, the ArcB sensor kinase autophosphorylates and then transphosphorylates ArcA, a global transcriptional regulator that controls the expression of numerous operons involved in respiratory or fermentative metabolism. We show that oxidized forms of quinone electron carriers act as direct negative signals that inhibit autophosphorylation of ArcB during aerobiosis. Thus, the Arc signal transduction system provides a link between the electron transport chain and gene expression."

Here, we use a new model of HCV spread to investigate the epidemic behavior of the virus and to estimate its basic reproductive number from gene sequence data. We find significant differences in epidemic behavior among HCV subtypes and suggest that these differences are largely the result of subtype-specific transmission patterns. Our model builds a bridge between the disciplines of population genetics and mathematical epidemiology by using pathogen gene sequences to infer the population dynamic history of an infectious disease."
https://openalex.org/W1981531296,"Outer hair cells (OHCs) of the mammalian cochlea actively change their cell length in response to changes in membrane potential. This electromotility, thought to be the basis of cochlear amplification, is mediated by a voltage-sensitive motor molecule recently identified as the membrane protein prestin. Here, we show that voltage sensitivity is conferred to prestin by the intracellular anions chloride and bicarbonate. Removal of these anions abolished fast voltage-dependent motility, as well as the characteristic nonlinear charge movement (""gating currents"") driving the underlying structural rearrangements of the protein. The results support a model in which anions act as extrinsic voltage sensors, which bind to the prestin molecule and thus trigger the conformational changes required for motility of OHCs."
https://openalex.org/W1983877900,"The temporal pattern and relative timing of action potentials among neocortical neurons may carry important information. However, how cortical circuits detect or generate coherent activity remains unclear. Using paired recordings in rat neocortical slices, we found that the firing of fast-spiking cells can reflect the spiking pattern of single-axon pyramidal inputs. Moreover, this property allowed groups of fast-spiking cells interconnected by electrical and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-releasing (GABAergic) synapses to detect the relative timing of their excitatory inputs. These results indicate that networks of fast-spiking cells may play a role in the detection and promotion of synchronous activity within the neocortex."
https://openalex.org/W1996279504,"It is widely assumed that the vital processes of transcription and translation are spatially separated in eukaryotes and that no translation occurs in nuclei. We localized translation sites by incubating permeabilized mammalian cells with [3H]lysine or lysyl-transfer RNA tagged with biotin or BODIPY; although most nascent polypeptides were cytoplasmic, some were found in discrete nuclear sites known as transcription ""factories."" Some of this nuclear translation also depends on concurrent transcription by RNA polymerase II. This coupling is simply explained if nuclear ribosomes translate nascent transcripts as those transcripts emerge from still-engaged RNA polymerases, much as they do in bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2037579319,"Promoter-specific recruitment of histone acetyltransferase activity is often critical for transcriptional activation. We present a detailed study of the interaction between the histone acetyltransferase complexes SAGA and NuA4, and transcription activators. We demonstrate by affinity chromatography and photo–cross-linking label transfer that acidic activators directly interact with Tra1p, a shared subunit of SAGA and NuA4. Mutations within the COOH-terminus of Tra1p disrupted its interaction with activators and resulted in gene-specific transcriptional defects that correlated with lowered promoter-specific histone acetylation. These data demonstrate that the essential Tra1 protein serves as a common target for activators in both SAGA and NuA4 acetyltransferases."
https://openalex.org/W1985808132,"Understanding the link between the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and Earth's temperature underpins much of paleoclimatology and our predictions of future global warming. Here, we use the inverse relationship between leaf stomatal indices and the partial pressure of CO 2 in modern Ginkgo biloba and Metasequoia glyptostroboides to develop a CO 2 reconstruction based on fossil Ginkgo and Metasequoia cuticles for the middle Paleocene to early Eocene and middle Miocene. Our reconstruction indicates that CO 2 remained between 300 and 450 parts per million by volume for these intervals with the exception of a single high estimate near the Paleocene/Eocene boundary. These results suggest that factors in addition to CO 2 are required to explain these past intervals of global warmth."
https://openalex.org/W2089190347,"We used near-edge x-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy to link the orientational bond order at three carbonaceous surfaces-rubbed polyimide, ion beam-irradiated polyimide, and ion beam-irradiated diamondlike carbon films-with the direction of liquid crystal (LC) alignment on these surfaces. We show that, in general, LC alignment can be created on any carbonaceous substrate by inducing orientational order at its surface. Our results form the scientific basis for LC alignment layers consisting of amorphous carbon films in which orientational order near the surface is induced by a directional low-energy ion beam."

https://openalex.org/W2153314392,"The p53 tumor suppressor protein plays a critical role in the regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis. The importance of p53's functions is underscored by the high incidence of p53 mutations in human cancers. Recently, two p53-related proteins, p73 and p63, were identified as members of the p53 gene family. Multiple isoforms of p73 have been found, including ΔN variants in which the N-termini are truncated. p63 is expressed as three major forms, p63α, p63β and p63γ, each of which differ in their C-termini. All three forms can be alternatively transcribed from a cryptic promoter located within intron 3, producing ΔNp63α, ΔNp63β and ΔNp63γ. The high degree of similarity of p73 and p63 to evolutionarily conserved regions of p53 suggests that these proteins play an important and potentially redundant role in regulating cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Here we describe the characterization of cell lines generated to inducibly express p63α and ΔNp63α. We have found that p63α and ΔNp63α can differentially regulate endogenous p53 target genes and induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Deletion of the N-terminal 26 amino acids of ΔNp63α abolished its ability to transactivate p53 target genes and induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. This indicates that a putative transactivation domain exists within the N-terminus of the ΔN variants of p63. Furthermore, the differential regulation of p53 target genes by p63α and ΔNp63α suggests that p63 and p53 utilize both similar and different signaling pathways to execute their cellular functions."
https://openalex.org/W2155391189,"Myosin VI is the only pointed end-directed myosin identified and is likely regulated by heavy chain phosphorylation (HCP) at the actin-binding site in vivo. We undertook a detailed kinetic analysis of the actomyosin VI ATPase cycle to determine whether there are unique adaptations to support reverse directionality and to determine the molecular basis of regulation by HCP. ADP release is the rate-limiting step in the cycle. ATP binds slowly and with low affinity. At physiological nucleotide concentrations, myosin VI is strongly bound to actin and populates the nucleotide-free (rigor) and ADP-bound states. Therefore, myosin VI is a high duty ratio motor adapted for maintaining tension and has potential to be processive. A mutant mimicking HCP increases the rate of Pi release, which lowers theK ATPase but does not affect ADP release. These measurements are the first to directly measure the steps regulated by HCP for any myosin. Measurements with double-headed myosin VI demonstrate that the heads are not independent, and the native dimer hydrolyzes multiple ATPs per diffusional encounter with an actin filament. We propose an alternating site model for the stepping and processivity of two-headed high duty ratio myosins.

Although the phosphorylation site was not identified directly, it was mapped between amino acids 308 and 631 and believed to be Thr406 of the actin-binding interface, because flanking sequences have p21-activated kinase recognition sites, and phosphorylation of Thr406 would be consistent with the TEDS rule (6Bement W.M.

All myosins have an acidic residue (Asp or Glu) at this position and are constitutively active or, in the case of Acanthamoeba myosin I, have a serine or threonine that when phosphorylated increases the ATPase rate more than 20-fold (7Albanesi J.P.

The apparent actomyosin VI affinities (K 6 and K 10) were determined from the ratio of the rate constants (Table II).Phosphorylation at Thr406 has minimal effects (<2-fold and within the range of uncertainty) on the rates and affinities of actin-filament binding in the strongly bound (AM and AM.ADP) states (Table II).ADP weakens the affinity of myosin VI for actin filaments ∼80-fold independent of phosphorylation at Thr406; the rate of binding to actin is reduced ∼4–6-fold, and the rate of dissociation from actin is ∼10–20 times more rapid (Table II).ATP-induced Population of the Weakly Bound StatesThe fluorescence of pyrene actin was used to monitor formation of the weak binding states of myosin VI after mixing with ATP (Fig.4). Concentrations lower than theK ATPase (Table I) were used to ensure ATP-induced dissociation of myosin VI from actin as confirmed by light scattering (data not shown). The addition of MgATP to 0.5 µm strongly bound (i.e. quenched) pyrene-actomyosin VI increases the fluorescence to that of pyrene actin alone. The time courses follow single exponentials (Fig. 4,A and B) with rates that depend linearly on the MgATP concentration (Fig. 4 C). As for all other characterized myosins, the mechanism of ATP-induced fluorescence enhancement was modeled as a two-step binding reaction.Figure 4MgATP induced population of weakly bound actomyosin VI states. A, time course of fluorescence increase after mixing 500 (curve a), 300 (curve b), 100 (curve c), or 0 µm (curve d) MgATP with 0.5 µm pyrene-actomyosin VI-T406E.

At saturating ATP (>5 mm), 100% of the fluorescence is recovered, demonstrating thatk +2′ ≫ k −2′ and ATP binding can be considered to be essentially irreversible.The association rate constants for MgATP binding to actomyosin VI (K 1′k +2′) obtained from the initial slopes of the lines are 18.2 (± 0.2) mm−1 s−1 for T406E and 15.2 (± 0.4) mm−1 s−1 for T406A (TableII). The maximum rate of ATP-induced dissociation (k +2′ + k −2′) for both myosin VI mutants is >250 s−1. The equilibrium constant for rapid ATP binding is very weak (1/K 1′ ≫ 14 mm) for both myosin VI mutants, suggesting that either ATP dissociates rapidly from the collision complex (rapidk −1′) or the nucleotide binding site is not readily accessible (slow k +1′, see “Discussion”). From the amplitudes of the transients we estimate apparent K m values of ∼300 µm for both myosin VI mutants.Although we did not correct for the changes in the ionic strength of the buffer resulting from the addition of mm MgATP, inclusion of an additional 50 mm KCl (corresponding to ∼12 mm MgATP assuming a net charge of −2 at pH 7.0) slowed the rate of T406A dissociation at 8 mm MgATP from 113 s−1 to 91 s−1 (data not shown). Therefore, we are confident that the dependence of the observed rate on [ATP] is linear over the range examined and that changes in ionic strength resulting from the addition of MgATP are not preventing the detection of a biphasic dependence (i.e. saturation) of the observed rates.At rates >50 s−1, a slow component with a rate of 7–9 s−1 could be resolved in the transients (data not shown). The amplitude (2–5%) of this phase was variable and could be accounted for by the fraction of ADP in the solution and the experimentally determined rates of ATP binding, ADP binding (presented below), and ADP release (presented below), suggesting that the slow component results from residual ADP in the ATP (22Geeves M.A. Perreault-Micale C.

Time courses of fluorescence enhancement after mixing mantATP with myosin VI do not follow single exponentials but can be fitted to double exponential functions (Fig.5 A). The rate of the fast phase depends on the mantATP concentration for both mutants (Fig. 5 B). The second-order association rate constants for ATP binding obtained from the slopes of the lines are 0.27 µm−1 s−1 for T406E and 0.14 µm−1 s−1 for T406A. The intercepts give dissociation rate constants of ∼4 s−1 for both mutants (Table II).Figure 5Kinetics of mantATP binding to myosin VI in the absence of actin.

The rate constants for mantATP binding are presented in Table II.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We could not accurately resolve the slow phase because of interference from photobleaching over long time scales but the rates were ∼0.2–0.4 s−1 and, given the uncertainties in the values, difficult to conclude if they depend on the nucleotide concentration. The source of the slow component is unknown, but it may represent a fraction of myosin that binds ATP (but not ADP, see below and Fig. 6A) slowly or an isomerization of myosin and/or nucleotide after binding. We did not investigate this component because it is not likely to be a relevant pathway in the actin-activated ATPase cycle; the rate is much slower than the steady-state turnover rate (Fig. 2 B).Figure 6Kinetics of mantADP binding to myosin VI and actomyosin VI. A, time course of fluorescence increase after mixing 6.1 µm 2′-deoxy-mantADP with 0.4 µm myosin VI-T406A in the absence of actin. The transient is of raw, unaveraged, and unfiltered data.

An equilibrated mixture of 2′-deoxy-mantADP (40 µm) and actomyosin VI (1 µm) was mixed with 2 mm unlabeled ADP. The smooth line through the data is the best fit to an exponential with a rate of 5.6 s−1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In the presence of actin the rates of mantATP binding were too slow (see Fig. 4 C, MgATP binding to pyrene actomyosin) to measure accurately or to distinguish the fast and slow phases of the reaction.There are no detectable changes in tryptophan fluorescence of either myosin VI mutant with ATP (or ADP) binding or ATP hydrolysis (data not shown). Similarly, there are no detectable changes in mantATP (or mantADP) fluorescence (λex = 295 nm) resulting from energy transfer via tryptophans to the bound mant nucleotides (data not shown). Tryptophans corresponding to chicken skeletal muscle myosin Trp510 and Trp595are absent from myosin VI (Val504 and Phe594, respectively), suggesting that either or both of these residues contribute to the fluorescence changes observed with other myosins. The Trp510 equivalent (Trp512) monitors the structural change preceding ATP hydrolysis in smooth muscle myosin II (23Yengo C.M. Chrin L.R. Rovner A.S. Berger C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 18: 25481-25487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (54) Google Scholar).ADP-Pi Burst and the Equilibrium Constant for ATP Hydrolysis (K3)We measured the equilibrium constant for ATP hydrolysis (K 3 =k +3/k −3) from the amplitude of the ADP-Pi burst (B = [ADP-Pi]/[myosin]). In the absence of actin, both myosin VI mutants display a burst amplitude of ∼0.6 ADP-Pi/myosin (T406E = 0.58 and T406A = 0.60) after mixing with 200 µm ATP. Using the relationB = K 3/(1 +K 3), we calculate a K 3 of 1.4 (± 0.1) for myosin VI-T406E and 1.5 (± 0.2) for myosin VI-T406A (Table II). It is important to clarify that this represents a lower limit for K 3, because ATP binding appears to be reversible (Fig. 5 B, see “Discussion”), and the measured burst amplitude may be low as a result of rapid ATP dissociation. We could not get a reliable signal at higher [ATP].The slow rate of ATP binding to actomyosin VI (K 1′k +2′, Fig. 4, TableII) precludes measurement of the ADP-Pi burst in the presence of actin.ADP Binding and Dissociation by mantADP FluorescenceThe fluorescence enhancement of 2′-deoxy-mantADP upon binding to myosin was used to measure the affinity and rates of ADP binding to myosin VI (Fig. 6, Table II). Time courses of fluorescence enhancements after mixing mantADP with myosin VI and actomyosin VI all follow single exponentials (Fig. 6 A) with rates that depend linearly on the concentration of nucleotide (Fig.6 B). Therefore, mantADP binding was modeled as a simple bimolecular reaction according to SchemesFS5andFS6,Figure FS5View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure FS6View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)where the * indicates high mantADP fluorescence, yielding the apparent second-order rate constants for mantADP binding (k −5 and k −5′) from the slopes of the lines (Table II). The intercepts deviate from the origin and reflect the dissociation rates (k +5′ and k +5) as confirmed by direct measurement (Fig. 6 C).The rate of mantADP release from actomyosin VI-T406E and -T406A is ∼6 s−1 (Fig. 6 C, Tables I and 2), which approximates the steady-state ATPase rate of both mutants, suggesting that ADP release is rate-limiting in the presence of actin. Myosin VI-T406E-HMM dissociates mantADP at approximately the same rate (7.0 ± 0.4 s−1, Table II). For other characterized myosins (e.g. see Ref. 12De La Cruz E.M. Wells A.L. Rosenfeld S.S. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1999; 96: 13726-13731Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), mantADP release from actomyosin is 1.5–2-fold slower than unlabeled ADP.Actin binding has minimal (<2-fold reduction) effects on the rates and affinities of mantADP binding (Table II). Dissociation (Fig.6 C) occurs at ∼6 s−1 from both myosin-VI mutants in the presence (k +5′) and absence (k +5) of actin. The association rate constants of mantADP are reduced only slightly (<2-fold) by binding to actin.Myosin VI-T406E binds mantADP with a 3–4-fold higher affinity (K 5 and K 5′) than does T406A because of a more rapid association rate constant both in the presence (k −5) and absence (k −5′) of actin filaments (Table II). Therefore, actomyosin VI binds MgADP more tightly than MgATP (K m values for ATP ∼ 300 µm): ∼30–40 times more tightly for T406E and 10–15 times more tightly for T406A.Pi ReleaseTime courses of Pi release after mixing myosin VI-ADP-Pi with actin filaments show a rapid exponential burst phase followed by a slow linear phase for both myosin VI mutants (Fig. 7, Aand B). The burst corresponds to the first turnover of Pi release after actin binding, and the slow linear phase reflects steady-state ATPase activity.Figure 7Rate of Pi release from actomyosin VI. A, time course of transient Pirelease from myosin VI-T406E-ADP-Pi after mixing with 20 (curve a), 9 (curve b), or 0 µm(curve c) actin filaments. B, time course of transient Pi release from myosin VI-T406A-ADP-Pi after mixing with 20 (curve a), 9 (curve b), or 0 µm (curve c) actin filaments. Note that the time scales between A andB are different. C, actin filament concentration dependence of the Pi release burst rate. Final concentrations at t = 0 were 1.5 µmmyosin VI, 4.5 µm PiBiP, 100 µmMgATP, and the indicated actin filament concentrations. TheV max and K ATPase values obtained from the linear phase of these curves are lower than those obtained with the NADH assays (Fig. 2) because of the low ATP concentration (100 µm versus 2 mm) and ADP inhibition without an ATP regenerating system.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The burst was measured without interference from the linear phase by including ADP (1 mm) with actin (data not shown). ADP competes with ATP and limits myosin to a single ATP turnover. There is no burst phase for either mutant in the absence of actin (curve c in Fig. 7, A and B), thus Pirelease is rate-limiting (k +4 ∼ 0.04 s−1).The Pi release burst rate depends hyperbolically on the actin filament concentration for both myosin VI mutants (Fig.7 C) and was therefore modeled as a two-step binding r"

We observed a rapid (5 min), massive (>30-fold), and sustained (>48 h) increase in COX-2 mRNA, protein, and PGE2 release following a recombinant human (rh) IL-1β signal that was inhibited by NS-398, a COX-2 inhibitor, and SB202190, a selective, cell-permeable p38 MAPK inhibitor.

Although synthesized through the concerted activity of multiple enzyme systems, the rate-limiting step in the formation of prostanoids is the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin H2 by cyclooxygenase (COX)1 (5Samuelsson B.

A constitutive and inducible form of COX has been identified, and x-ray crystallographic analyses suggest strongly that they are monotopic, endoplasmic reticulum-associated homodimeric enzymes that possess heme-dependent peroxidase and cyclooxygenase activity (7Picot D. Loll P.J. Garavito M. Nature. 1994; 367: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar). The constitutive COX-1 gene has been ascribed a homeostatic function and indeed has a GC-rich housekeeping promoter (8Wang L.H. Hajibeigi A. Xu X.M. Loose-Mitchell D. Wu K.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 406-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In contrast, the COX-2 gene (mRNAs 4.6 and 2.8 kb) is rapidly induced by tumor promoters, growth factors, cytokines, and mitogens in many cell model systems (9Hla T. Neilson K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7384-7388Crossref PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar, 10O'Banion M.K. Winn V.D. Young D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It behaves much like an immediate-early gene, and its regulation has been shown to occur at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels (12Ryseck R.P. Raynoscheck C. Macdonald-Bravo H.

In this regard, the COX-2 message has an extensive 3′-UTR having at least two distinct polyadenylation sites and 22 Shaw-Kamen 5′-AUUUn-A-3′ motifs (11Appleby S.B. Ristimäki A. Neilson K. Narko K. Hla T. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 723-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). The latter sequences are believed to be associated with message instability, translational efficiency, and rapid turnover (15Beelman C.A. Parker R.

Furthermore, sequence analysis of the 5′-flanking region has shown several potential transcription regulatory sequences, including a TATA box, a c/EBP motif, two AP-2 sites, 3 SP-1 sites, two NF-κB sites, a CRE motif, and an Ets-1 site (no AP-1 site) (11Appleby S.B. Ristimäki A. Neilson K. Narko K. Hla T. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 723-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, despite this wealth of structural information, it is still not totally clear how the COX-2 gene is regulated transcriptionally by external stimuli particularly in terms of the relevant signaling pathways and the transcription factors acting on 5′-flanking sequences. Even less is known about post-transcriptional regulation, although it is apparently critical in determining the amplitude and duration of the inductive process. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) occupies a prominent place in the hierarchy of proinflammatory cytokines associated with inflammatory, immune, and arthritic diseases. Indeed, there is now wide agreement, based on animal models and clinical studies, that the macrophage-derived cytokine plays a fundamental role in the development of osteoarthritis (reviewed in Ref. 17Martel-Pelletier J.

In many cell types (e.g. synovial fibroblasts (18Crofford L.J. Wilder R.L. Ristimaki A.P. Sano H. Remmers E.F. Epps H.R. Hla T. J. Clin.

Hardiman J.C. Timans R. Kasteelin R. Bazan F.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 95: 558-592Google Scholar). The binding event is followed by the activation of a signaling cascade involving the adapter protein MyD88 that recruits IL-1R-associated kinase and IL-1R-associated kinase 2 to the receptor complex. The latter Ser/Thr kinases interact with the adapter molecule TNF receptor-activated factor-6 that bridges them to the NF-κB-inducing kinase that in turn activates IκB kinases α and β (21DiDonato J.A.

The signal is initiated by membrane-proximal small GTPases of the Rho family, activation of an MAPKKK (e.g.MEKK1 and MLK), and phosphorylation and activation of an MAPKK (e.g. MKK3/6 or MEK3/6) that in turn phosphorylates and activates p38 kinase (29Ichijo H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6087-6093Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 30Tibbles L.A. Woodgett J.R. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1230-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). p38 kinase can phosphorylate trans-acting factors like ATF-2 and CREB-1 that render them transcriptionally competent (31Tan Y. Rouse J. Zhang A. Cariati S. Cohen P. Comb M.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4629-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 32Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J.S. Dickens M. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7420-7426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2046) Google Scholar). An alternative but perhaps less well appreciated mechanism for the mediation of IL-1β signaling is in fact the modulation of p38 MAPK activity (33Freshney N.W. Rawlinson L. Guesdon F. Jones E. Cowley S. Hsuan J. Saklatvala J. Cell. 1994; 78: 1039-1049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar, 34Geng Y. Valbracht J. Lotz M. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2425-2430Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). It was shown that p38 not only mediates a transcriptional response, presumably at the level of the COX-2 promoter, but also at the level of COX-2 mRNA stability (14Dean J.L.E. Brook M. Clark A.R.

Biol. 2000; 20: 4265-4274Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Indeed, the strength and duration of COX-2 expression was largely attributed to the posttranscriptional regulatory phase in which a short (123-nucleotide) fragment of the COX-2 3′-UTR was necessary and sufficient for the regulation of mRNA stability by a p38/MAPKAPK-2/hsp 27 cascade (36Lasa M. Maktani K.R. Finch A. Brewer G. Saklatvala J. Clark A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4265-4274Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). The latter nucleotide sequence interacted with a protein identified as an AU-rich element/poly(U)-binding factor I (36Lasa M. Maktani K.R. Finch A. Brewer G. Saklatvala J. Clark A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4265-4274Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). In the present study, we report that the magnitude and duration of the induction of COX-2 mRNA, COX-2 protein, and PGE2release by rhIL-1β is primarily the result of PGE2-dependent stabilization of COX-2 mRNA in primary cultures of human synovial fibroblasts. In addition, PGE2 mitigates COX-2 mRNA decay and inhibition of COX-2 protein translation normally mediated by the 3′-UTR region of COX-2 mRNA. Finally, we provide evidence that the stabilization process involves a positive feedback loop and is mediated by PGE2-dependent up-regulation of the p38 MAPK cascade via the prostaglandin EP4 receptor.

Synovial lining cells (human synovial fibroblasts, HSF) were isolated from synovial membranes (synovia) obtained at necropsy from donors with no history of arthritic disease (mean age 30 ± 27). Additional experiments were conducted with synovia from osteoarthritic (OA) and rheumatoid arthritic (RA) patients undergoing arthroplasty who were diagnosed based on the criteria developed by the American College of Rheumatology Diagnostic Subcommittee for OA/RA (mean age 67 ± 19). Human synovial fibroblasts were released by sequential enzymatic digestion with 1 mg/ml Pronase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 1 h, followed by 6 h with 2 mg/ml collagenase (type IA, Sigma) at 37 °C in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FCS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin (37Di Battista J.A.

Released HSF were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in tissue culture flasks (Primaria 3824, Falcon, Lincoln Park, NJ) allowing the adherence of nonfibroblastic cells possibly present in the synovial preparation, particularly from OA and RA synovia. In addition, flow cytometric analysis (Epic II, Coulter, Miami, FL), using the anti-CD14 (fluorescein isothiocyanate) antibody, was conducted to confirm that no monocytes/macrophages were present in the synoviocyte preparation (38Alaaeddine N.

The cells were seeded in tissue culture flasks and cultured until confluence in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS and antibiotics at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air. The cells were incubated in fresh medium containing 0.5–1% fetal bovine serum for 24 h before the experiments, and only second or third passaged HSF were used. 50–100 µg of cellular extract (in RIPA buffer; 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 µg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmsodium orthovanadate, and 1 mm NaF) from control and treated HSF were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis through 10% gels (final concentration of acrylamide), under reducing conditions, and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Following blocking with 5% BLOTTO for 2 h at room temperature and washing, the membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with polyclonal anti-human COX-2 (Cayman Chemical Co., Ann Arbor, MI, 1:7500 dilution) in TTBS containing 0.25% BLOTTO. The second anti-rabbit antibody-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1:4000 dilution) was subsequently incubated with membranes for 1 h at room temperature, washed extensively for 30–40 min with TTBS, and a final rinse with TBS at room temperature. Following incubation with an ECL chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), membranes were prepared for autoradiography, exposed to Kodak X-Omat film, and subjected to digital imaging system (Alpha G-Imager 2000; Canberra Packard Canada, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) for semi-quantitative measurements. In addition to the anti-COX-2 antiserum, the following polyclonal antibodies were used: total and anti-phospho-p38 MAP kinase (Thr-180/Tyr-182), anti-phospho-ATF-2 (Thr-69/Thr-71), anti-phospho-c-Jun (Ser-63), and anti-phospho-JNK/SAPK (Thr-183/Tyr-85). Total cellular RNA was isolated (1 × 106 cells = 10–20 µg of RNA) using the Trizol (Life Technologies, Inc.) reagent. Generally, 5 µg of total RNA were resolved on 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gel and transferred electrophoretically (30 V overnight at 4 °C) to Hybond-N™ nylon membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 0.5× Tris/acetate/EDTA (TAE) buffer, pH 7. After prehybridization for 24 h, hybridizations were carried out at 50 °C for 24–36 h, followed by high stringency washing at 68 °C in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS. The following probes, labeled with digoxigenin (DIG)-dUTP by random priming, were used for hybridization. Human COX-2 cDNA (1.8 kb, Cayman Chemical Co.) was cloned into the EcoRV site of pcDNA 1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and released by PstI and XhoI digestion; a 780-bpPstI/XbaI fragment was obtained from GAPDH cDNA (1.2 kb; American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA). This latter probe served as a control of RNA loading as GAPDH is constitutively expressed. All blots were subjected to a digital imaging system (Alpha G-Imager 2000; Canberra Packard Canada, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) for semi-quantitative measurements, and changes in COX-2 expression were always considered as a ratio, COX-2/GAPDH mRNA. Transient transfection experiments were conducted in 4-, 6-, or 12-well cluster plates with HSF as described previously (37Di Battista J.A. Zhang M. Martel-Pelletier J. Fernandes J.C. Alaaeddine N. Pelletier J.P. Arthritis Rheum. 1999; 42: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Transfections were conducted using the FuGene 6™ (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or LipofectAMINE 2000™ reagents (Life Technologies, Inc.) method for 6 h according to the manufacturer's protocol with cells at around 40–50% confluence. HSF were re-exposed to a culture medium + 1% FCS for 2 h prior to the addition of the biological effectors. Transfection efficiencies were controlled by co-transfection with 0.5 µg of pCMV-β-gal, a β-galactosidase reporter vector under the control of cytomegalovirus promoter. The COX-2 promoter (−2390 to + 34)-LUC plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. Stephen Prescott, University of Utah (40Kutchera W. Jones D.A. Matsunami N. Groden J. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. White R.L.

The plasmids are designated LUC-3′-UTR, LUC-+ARE, LUC-Δ3′-UTR. The p38 MAPK kinase (MEK3/MKK3) and pFCPKAcat expression vectors was purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Luciferase values, expressed as relative light units, were normalized to 1 OD unit of β-galactosidase activity and protein content per sample for all experiments. The oligonucleotide primers for the polymerase chain reactions (PCR) were prepared with the aid of a DNA synthesizer (Cyclone model, Biosearch Inc., Montreal, Quebec, Canada) and used at a final concentration of 200 nmol/liter. The sequences for the luciferase primers are as follows: 5′-ACGGATTACCAGGGATTTCAGTC-3′ and 5′-AGGCTCCTCAGAAACAGCTCTTC-3′ (antisense) for the luciferase fragment of 367 bp (41Dixon D.A. Kaplan C.D.

The sequences for the GAPDH (which served as a standard of quantitation) primers are 5′-CAGAACATCATCCCTGCCTCT-3′, which corresponds to position 604–624 bp of the published sequence, and 5′-GCTTGACAAAGTGGTCGTTGAG-3′, from position 901–922 bp, for an amplified product of 318 bp (37Di Battista J.A.

Two µg of total RNA, extracted with the Trizol reagent, was reverse-transcribed and then subjected to PCR as described previously (37Di Battista J.A. Zhang M. Martel-Pelletier J. Fernandes J.C. Alaaeddine N. Pelletier J.P. Arthritis Rheum. 1999; 42: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). RT and PCR assays were carried out with the enzymes and reagents of the GeneAmP RNA PCR kit manufactured by PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Both the RT and PCRs were done in a Gene ATAQ Controller (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The amplification process was conducted over 10–30 cycles in order to define the linear range of product amplification; the first cycle consisted of a denaturation step at 95 °C for 1 min, followed by annealing and elongation at 60 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 1.5 min, respectively. All subsequent cycles were executed under the same conditions, with the exception of the last cycle, where the elongation step was extended to 7 min. We found a linear range (log luciferase/GAPDH versus log cycle number) between 10–17; as such we chose 11–13 cycles depending on the type of experiment. The PCR products were analyzed and verified by electrophoresis on 1.15% agarose gels in a Tris borate/EDTA buffer system as described previously (37Di Battista J.A. Zhang M. Martel-Pelletier J. Fernandes J.C. Alaaeddine N. Pelletier J.P. Arthritis Rheum. 1999; 42: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). All gel photos were subjected to a digital imaging system (see above) for semi-quantitative measurements, and results were expressed as a ratio of luciferase/GAPDH PCR fragments. Confluent HSF in 4-well cluster plates (3–5 × 106 cells/well) from control and treated cells were carefully scraped into 1.5 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and pelleted by brief centrifugation. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (37Di Battista J.A. Zhang M. Martel-Pelletier J. Fernandes J.C. Alaaeddine N. Pelletier J.P.

(Montreal, Quebec, Canada) and were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega, Madison, WI). The sense sequences of the oligos tested are as follows: NF-κB p50, 5′-GCC ATG GGGGGATCCCCG AAG TCC-3′; NF-κB p50 mut, 5′-GCC ATG GGC C GATCCCCG AAG TCC-3′; ATF-2, 5′-GAT TCA ATGACATCA CGG CTG TG-3′; ATF-2 mut, 5′-GAT TAC AGA ACATAG CGG CTG TG-3′. Binding buffer consisted of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mmNaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 4% glycerol, and 2.5 µg of poly(dI-dC). Binding reactions were conducted with 15 µg of nuclear extract and 100,000 cpm of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe at 22 °C for 20 min in a final volume of 10 µl. Binding complexes were resolved by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis through 6% gels in a Tris borate buffer system, after which the gels were fixed, dried, and prepared for autoradiography. Measurements of the principal eicosanoids produced by HSF were performed by ELISA kits according to the manufacturer's instructions (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Detection limits for PGE2, LTB4, and PGD2 were 39, 3.9, and 7.8 pg/ml, respectively. Studies in our laboratory (39Fahmi H. He Y. Zhang M. Martel-Pelletier J. Pelletier J.-P. Di Battista J.A.

https://openalex.org/W1507460091,"BACE1 and BACE2 define a new subfamily of membrane-anchored aspartyl proteases. Both endoproteases share similar structural organization including a prodomain, a catalytic domain formed via DTG and DSG active site motifs, a single transmembrane domain, and a short C-terminal tail. BACE1 has been identified as the Alzheimer's β-secretase, whereas BACE2 was mapped to the Down's critical region of human chromosome 21. Herein we show that purified BACE2 can be autoactivated in vitro. Purified BACE2 cleaves human amyloid precursor protein (APP) sequences at the β-secretase site, and near the α-secretase site, mainly at Aβ-Phe20↓ Ala21 and also at Aβ-Phe19↓Phe20. Alternatively, in cells BACE2 has a limited effect on the β-secretase site but efficiently cleaves the sequences near the α-secretase site. The in vitro specificity of APP processing by BACE2 is distinct from that observed in cells. BACE2 localizes in the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, trans-Golgi network, endosomes, and plasma membrane, and its cellular localization patterns depend on the presence of its transmembrane domain. BACE2 chimeras that increase localization of BACE2 in the trans-Golgi network do not change its APP processing patterns. Thus, BACE2 can be distinguished from BACE1 on the basis of autoprocessing of the prosegment, APP processing specificity, and subcellular localization patterns."

Abrupt shifts of up to 18 per mil in the oxygen isotope ratio of diatom silica have been found in a 14,000-year record from two alpine lakes on Mt. Kenya. Interpretation of tropical-montane isotope records is controversial, especially concerning the relative roles of precipitation and temperature. Here, we argue that Holocene variations in delta(18)O are better explained by lake moisture balance than by temperature-induced fractionation. Episodes of heavy convective precipitation dated approximately 11,100 to 8600, 6700 to 5600, 2900 to 1900, and <1300 years before the present were linked to enhanced soil erosion, neoglacial ice advances, and forest expansion on Mt.

https://openalex.org/W2328322198,"The function of the centrosomes to direct mitotic spindles is critical for accurate chromosome transmission to daughter cells. Since each daughter cell inherits one centrosome, each centrosome must duplicate prior to the next mitosis, and do so only once. Thus, there are control mechanism(s) that ensure the coordinated progression of centrosome duplication and other cell cycle events (i.e. DNA synthesis), and limit centrosome duplication to once per cell cycle. Deregulation of the centrosome duplication cycle results in abnormal amplification of centrosomes, leading to aberrant mitoses and increased chromosome transmission errors. This has been found to be the case for cells lacking functional p53 tumor suppressor protein. However, it had remained to be determined whether the deregulation of the centrosome duplication cycle is the direct or indirect effect of loss/mutational inactivation of p53. Here, we found that the normal centrosome duplication cycle is almost completely restored in p53(-/-) cells by re-introduction of wild-type p53 at a physiologically relevant level, demonstrating that p53 is directly involved in the regulation of centrosome duplication. Since cyclin dependent kinase 2 (CDK2)/cyclin E triggers DNA synthesis as well as centrosome duplication, we tested whether Waf1, a CDK inhibitor and a major target of p53's transactivation function, is an effector of p53-mediated regulation of centrosome duplication. We found that induced expression of Waf1 in p53(-/-) cells only partially restored the centrosome duplication control, suggesting that Waf1 comprises one of the multiple effector pathways of the p53-mediated regulation of the centrosome duplication cycle."

Vitiligo is a depigmenting skin disorder with a prevalence in the general population of about 1% (15Lerner A.B. Am. J.

Autoantibodies against melanocytes have been reported in patients with vitiligo unrelated to APS I (22Cui J. Harning R. Henn M. Bystryn J.C. J. Invest.

Med. 1983; 158: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), but the major autoantigens in vitiligo are yet to be identified. The possible roles of tyrosinase, tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TPR-1), and tyrosinase-related protein 2 (TPR-2), key enzymes in the synthesis of melanin as well as the melanosomal matrix glycoprotein, pmel17 (24Kemp E.H. Gawkrodger D.J. Watson P.F. Weetman A.P. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1998; 114: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), as melanocyte autoantigens remain largely unresolved. Some studies report frequent immunoreactivity against these proteins in patients with vitiligo (25Song Y.H. Connor E. Li Y. Zorovich B. Balducci P. Maclaren N. Lancet. 1994; 344: 1049-1052Abstract PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), whereas other studies show only a low frequency of immunoreactivity (26Kemp E.H. Waterman E.A. Gawkrodger D.J. Watson P.F. Weetman A.P. Br. J. Dermatol. 1998; 139: 798-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In the majority of patients studied with vitiligo and APS I, complement-fixing antibodies directed against melanin-producing cells were identified (27Hertz K.C. Gazze L.A. Kirkpatrick C.H. Katz S.I. N. Engl. J. Med. 1977; 297: 634-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 28Betterle C. Mirakian R. Doniach D. Bottazzo G.F. Riley W. Maclaren N.K. Lancet. 1984; 1: 159Abstract PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This immunoreactivity was not demonstrated in patients with isolated vitiligo or vitiligo associated with other autoimmune disorders (28Betterle C. Mirakian R. Doniach D. Bottazzo G.F. Riley W. Maclaren N.K. Lancet. 1984; 1: 159Abstract PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and can be found in patients with APS I many years before the development of vitiligo (29Betterle C. Caretto A. Pedini B. Rigon F. Bertoli P. Peserico A. Arch. Dermatol. 1992; 128: 123-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Sera from patients with APS I are known to contain high titer autoantibodies, which makes APS I a suitable disease model for the identification of autoantigens. We recently demonstrated the presence of immunoreactivity against melanocyte nuclei in both hair follicles and epidermis in APS I patients (30Hedstrand H. Perheentupa J. Ekwall O. Gustafsson J. Michaelsson G. Husebye E. Rorsman F. Kämpe O. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1999; 113: 1054-1058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Because vitiligo is common in APS I, affecting 8–15% of the patients (1Ahonen P. Myllarniemi S. Sipila I. Perheentupa J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1990; 322: 1829-1836Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar, 5Betterle C. Greggio N.A. Volpato M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 83: 1049-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), this study aims at further characterization of the antigenic structures related to this manifestation. Samples from 91 APS I patients and 93 patients with vitiligo unrelated to APS I were tested. In addition, sera from 35 healthy Swedish and 30 Finnish blood donors were used as controls. Clinical characteristics of the 10 Swedish (11Gebre-Medhin G. Husebye E.S. Gustafsson J. Winqvist O. Goksoyr A. Rorsman F. Kämpe O.

Metab. 1998; 83: 1049-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) and 62 Finnish patients (1Ahonen P. Myllarniemi S. Sipila I. Perheentupa J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1990; 322: 1829-1836Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar) with APS I have been described previously. The male/female ratio was 45/46. Vitiligo was present in 3 of 10 (30%) Swedish, 2 of 7 (29%) Norwegian, 3 of 12 (25%) Italian, and 11 of 62 (18%) Finnish patients, thus altogether in 19 of the 91 (21%) patients. There were 35 males and 58 females among the 93 patients with vitiligo not associated to APS I. Thirty-seven of these patients had accompanying autoimmune diseases, of which autoimmune thyroid disease was the most prevalent and found in 21 of the patients. None of the 93 patients had a clinical picture of APS I. A mouse anti-human monoclonal antibody directed against a yet uncharacterized but melanocyte-specific cell-surface protein was purchased from ANAWA (Zürich, Switzerland). A fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-mouse immunoglobulin and a Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-human immunoglobulin was obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). A polyclonal rabbit anti-rat Sox10 serum was a kind gift from Dr. M. Wegner (Zentrum für Molekulare Neurobiologie, Hamburg, Germany) (32Kuhlbrodt K. Herbarth B. Sock E. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Wegner M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 237-250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Preparation of mRNA from human scalp containing intact hair follicles was performed with Dynabeads® mRNA DIRECT kit (Dynal AS, Oslo, Norway) followed by synthesis of the library (λZAP-EXPRESS cDNA synthesis kit, Stratagene) according to the protocols supplied by the manufacturers. Fractions containing cDNA fragments larger than 500 base pairs were pooled and ligated into the vector arms. The library, containing 3.0 × 106 unique cDNA clones, was then amplified once. Scalp tissues were taken in connection with neurosurgical interventions and with the approval of the local ethics committee. Serum from an APS I patient with vitiligo was diluted 1:3000 and used for immunoscreening of the library as described previously (9Rorsman F. Husebye E.S. Winqvist O. Björk E. Karlsson F.A. Kämpe O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8626-8629Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). After in vitro excision of pBK-CMV phagemid vectors according to the Stratagene protocol, DNA sequence analysis was performed by primer walking with AmpliTaq DNA Polymerase FS, dye terminator, and dye primer kits (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) on a 373A DNA Sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The DNA sequence was then compared with international data bases using BLAST (NCBI). A DNA fragment containing the open reading frame of human SOX10 was PCR-amplified from the vector huSOX10 (kindly donated by Dr. M. Wegner) (32Kuhlbrodt K. Herbarth B. Sock E. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Wegner M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 237-250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The primers used (Cybergene, Huddinge, Sweden) were 5′-GGCGGCGGCCGGGGGCGACAT-3′, annealing 20 bases upstream of the first ATG, and 5′-TCAGGGCAGGAGCCAGACAGAAA-3′, annealing 158 bases downstream of the stop codon. The PCR product was subsequently subcloned using the pGEM-T vector systems kit (Promega, Madison, WI) according to manufacurer protocol. Plasmids were purified with the Qiagen miniprep kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany). ITT of the purified plasmids was performed using the TNT T3- and T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). The incorporation rate of total [35S]methionine was ∼1% for both SOX9 and SOX10. The correct size of the radioactively labeled proteins was analyzed on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis minigel (Bio-Rad) according to standard protocols. The 35S-radiolabeled SOX9 and SOX10 proteins were used for immunoprecipitation with the sera from patients in a 96-well plate assay as described elsewhere (33Husebye E.S. Gebre-Medhin G. Tuomi T. Perheentupa J. Landin-Olsson M. Gustafsson J. Rorsman F. Kämpe O. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 82: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The results were expressed as SOX9 and SOX10 indices ((cpm sample − cpm-negative control)/(cpm-positive control − cpm-negative control) × 100), respectively. Each sample was analyzed in triplicate. One APS I patient with a high titer of antibodies against SOX9 and SOX10 was used as a positive control, and one of the blood donors was used as a negative control in each microwell plate. The upper normal limits of SOX9 and SOX10 antibody indices were set at 4 and 24, respectively. These values divided the cohort of APS I patients into those with clearly elevated indices and those with normal or slightly elevated indices. Human epidermal melanocytes were prepared as described elsewhere (34Olsson M.J. Juhlin L. Acta Derm. Venereol. 1993; 73: 49-51PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were cultured for 3 weeks in serum-free M2 melanocyte medium (PromoCell, Heidelberg, Germany) and were then resuspended in 8% Me2SO in fetal calf serum for storage at −150 °C until needed (35Olsson M.J. Moellmann G. Lerner A.B. Juhlin L. Acta Derm. Venereol. 1994; 74: 226-228PubMed Google Scholar). Ten million cells prepared from Caucasian human skin taken during mammary plastic surgery were washed two times in PBS, lysed in loading buffer with 10 mmEDTA, and loaded on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel (36Kämpe O. Andersson A. Björk E. Hallberg A. Karlsson F.A. Diabetes. 1989; 38: 1326-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Lysates from 5 × 105 cells were loaded in each lane. Western blot was performed as described elsewhere (37Winqvist O. Gustafsson J. Rorsman F. Karlsson F.A. Kämpe O. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2377-2385Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) with sera from eight Swedish APS I patients and three healthy blood donors diluted 1:1000. The normal rabbit serum (DAKO A/S, Glostrup, Denmark) and the polyclonal rabbit anti-rat SOX10 antiserum were diluted 1:100. A biopsy was taken from the dorsal surface of an upper limb of a healthy Caucasian female and used for subsequent cryosection. Serum from the APS I patient used for the initial immunoscreening of the scalp cDNA library was preincubated with SOX9 and SOX10 proteins expressed in vitro as described above. The serum was diluted 1:300 in a total volume of 100 μl of incubation buffer (50 μl of the ITT mixture and 50 μl of PBS) and was preincubated overnight at 4 °C. A similar ITT mixture without cDNA template served as a negative control. The mouse anti-human melanocyte antibody was added to each preabsorption mixture in a final dilution of 1:200. Fifty microliters of all three overnight-incubation mixtures were then used for indirect immunofluorescence staining of the cryosections. A secondary donkey anti-human (Cy3) antibody and a donkey anti-mouse (fluorescein isothiocyanate) antibody were diluted 1:200 and 1:50, respectively. Tissue preparation and immunohistochemical incubation procedures have been described elsewhere (30Hedstrand H. Perheentupa J. Ekwall O. Gustafsson J. Michaelsson G. Husebye E. Rorsman F. Kämpe O. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1999; 113: 1054-1058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Photographs were taken with a Leica DMRB microscope (Leica Microscopy Systems Ltd., Heerbrugg, Switzerland). Melanocytes were obtained from two sources: 1) mammary skin from one healthy Caucasian female undergoing plastic surgery and 2) normal gluteal skin from a Caucasian female with vitiligo. Cells (8 × 106) from each person were lysed in 300 μl of lysis buffer (100 mmTris, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 1% lithium dodecyl sulfate, 500 mm LiCl, and 5 mmdithiothreitol), and mRNA was extracted with Dynabeads® mRNA DIRECT kit (Dynal A.S). After cDNA synthesis with Superscript-Reverse Transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.), PCR was performed with specific primers designed to anneal to separate exons to avoid amplification of genomic sequences. The primers were: SOX9 sense (exon 2) 5′-GCCACGGAGCAGACGCAC-3′ and antisense (exon 3) 5′-GCGCCTGCTGCTTGGACA-3′); SOX10 sense (exon 4) 5′-GACCGCCGCCATCCAGGC-3′ and antisense (exon 5) 5′-AGTAGCTGCTCACATGGCCT-3′; and β-actin, which was used as a positive control, sense (exon 2) 5′-CAACTGGGACGACATGGAGA-3′, and antisense (exon 3) 5′-TGTCAGGCAGCTCGTAGCTG-3′. PCRs were done with Expand™ High Fidelity PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to manufacturer protocol at an annealing temperature of 62 °C for 35 cycles. Fisher's exact test was used to compare the frequencies of reactivity against SOX9 and SOX10 with various symptoms. Four positive clones were identified when the λZAP-cDNA library was screened with serum from one of the Swedish APS I patients with vitiligo. Afterin vitro excision of pBK-CMV vectors corresponding to the positive clones, in vitro transcription and translation with T3 polymerase was performed followed by immunoprecipitation with a panel of 10 APS I sera. One of the four clones was recognized solely by the serum used for the screening, whereas the other three were identified by four of the 10 sera. DNA sequence analysis revealed that these latter clones all coded for the transcription factor SOX9. Two of the clones were identical with the reported full-length cDNA (38Foster J.W. Dominguez-Steglich M.A. Guioli S. Kowk G. Weller P.A. Stevanovic M. Weissenbach J. Mansour S. Young I.D. Goodfellow P.N. Nature. 1994; 372: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (1333) Google Scholar), and one clone represented a truncated SOX9 cDNA. Fourteen (15%) of the 91 APS I patients had antibodies against SOX9 with an index above 4. Of the 19 patients with vitiligo, 9 (47%) had autoantibodies, in contrast to 5 (7%) of 72 patients without vitiligo (p < 0.0001). SOX10 is expressed in embryonic melanoblasts (39Southard-Smith E.M. Kos L. Pavan W.J. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 60-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar) and is structurally related to SOX9 with an overall homology of 59%. This prompted us to assess SOX10 as a possible autoantigen in vitiligo. All APS I patients with immunoreactivity against SOX9 also had reactivity against SOX10. In addition, six patients only reacting with SOX10 were identified, three of these having vitiligo. Altogether, 20 (22%) of the 91 APS I sera displayed SOX10 antibodies (Fig. 1). Twelve (63%) sera from 19 patients with vitiligo, in contrast to 8 (11%) of 72 without vitiligo, had an index above 24 (p< 0.0001). Of the 19 APS I patients with vitiligo, 12 (63%) also had alopecia areata, and 9 (75%) of them were SOX10 antibody-positive. Among 93 patients with vitiligo that is unassociated with APS I, three (3%) showed strong reactivity against SOX10. Two of these had symmetrical active vitiligo, one had focal static vitiligo, and one also showed weak SOX9 reactivity. Analysis of the in vitro transcribed and translated products on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed bands with the expected sizes of ∼60 kDa for SOX9 and 55 kDa for SOX10 (data not shown). When lysates from melanocytes were used for immunoblotting, four of the eight APS I patients showed reactivity against a broad band (Fig. 2, lanes 8–11) migrating with a molecular mass of ∼65 kDa (Fig.2), and a less intensively stained band of ∼79 kDa, co-migrating with bands detected by the specific rabbit antiserum against SOX10. In addition, a third protein of ∼45 kDa was also weakly recognized by the same four patient sera (Fig. 2), but this was not detected by the specific rabbit antiserum (Fig. 2, lane 12). No reactivity against the 79-, 65-, or the 45-kDa bands was seen with sera from healthy blood donors or with the normal rabbit serum. SOX9 and SOX10 bands with the expected sizes were obtained when mRNA from isolated melanocytes from both a healthy female (Fig. 3,lanes 1–3) and a female patient with vitiligo (lanes 4–6) was used for reverse transcriptase-PCR. Restriction enzyme digestion with ApaI, only present in the SOX9sequence, generated fragments of the expected size (Fig.3 b), confirming the amplification of SOX9mRNA. A nuclear staining was seen in melanocytes close to or just above the basal membrane when serum from one APS I patient was used for immunofluorescence (Fig.4). After preincubation with the in vitro expressed proteins, only the SOX10 protein eliminated the nuclear melanocyte staining (Fig. 4). We report on the identification of the transcription factors SOX9 and SOX10 as autoantigens associated with vitiligo in APS I. Autoantibodies against SOX10 were also found in three patients with vitiligo unassociated with APS I, implying that SOX10 is an autoantigen in a subgroup of patients with idiopathic vitiligo. SOX9 and SOX10 belong to a family of more than 20 transcription factors sharing a motif homologous to the high mobility group box in the sex-determining region Y (SRY) factor (35Olsson M.J. Moellmann G. Lerner A.B. Juhlin L. Acta Derm. Venereol. 1994; 74: 226-228PubMed Google Scholar, 36Kämpe O. Andersson A. Björk E. Hallberg A. Karlsson F.A. Diabetes. 1989; 38: 1326-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). SOX and other high mobility group box proteins bind to DNA in a highly sequence-specific manner (40Grosschedl R. Giese K. Pagel J. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 94-100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar) and are thought to play important roles in the embryonic development of various organs (41Wegner M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1409-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar, 42Prior H.M. Walter M.A. Mol. Med. 1996; 2: 405-412Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SOX9 and SOX10 are structurally closely related with almost 100% homology within a stretch of 110 amino acids and an overall amino acid identity of 59% (32Kuhlbrodt K. Herbarth B. Sock E. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Wegner M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 237-250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SOX10 is involved in the differentiation of tissues derived from the neural crest, and its expression has been detected in the central nervous system, peripheral nervous system, sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia, and enteric ganglia throughout the gastrointestinal tract during human embryogenesis. Expression has also been shown in the submandibular glands, the pancreas, the heart, and the lung. In adults, expression of SOX10 has been detected in the brain, prostate, small intestine, colon, and heart (43Bondurand N. Kobetz A. Pingault V. Lemort N. Encha-Razavi F. Couly G. Goerich D.E. Wegner M. Abitbol M. Goossens M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 432: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Melanocytes are derived from the neural crest, and SOX10 expression has been reported in migrating melanoblasts in developing mouse dermis (39Southard-Smith E.M. Kos L. Pavan W.J. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 60-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). SOX10 has been shown to bind to the promoter of microphtalmia-associated transcription factor (44Lee M. Goodall J. Verastegui C. Ballotti R. Goding C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37978-37983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), a gene important for the development of melanocytes and other neural crest-derived cells (45Goding C.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1712-1728PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, mutations in the SOX10 gene in patients with Waardenburg- Hirschprung disease give rise to pigmentary abnormalities as well as deafness and agangliotic megacolon (46Pingault V. Bondurand N. Kuhlbrodt K. Goerich D.E. Prehu M.O. Puliti A. Herbarth B. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Legius E. Matthijs G. Amiel J. Lyonnet S. Ceccherini I. Romeo G. Smith J.C. Read A.P. Wegner M. Goossens M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 171-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). We found reactivity against SOX10 in 63% of the APS I patients with vitiligo but only in 11% without vitiligo (p < 0.0001), indicating a strong association between these autoantibodies and vitiligo. Reactivity against SOX9 was found in a subgroup of the patients with reactivity against SOX10. This may imply cross-reactivity against epitopes shared by SOX9 and SOX10 and that SOX10 is the major autoantigen. This notion is supported by the finding that only in vitro expressed SOX10, but not SOX9, abolished the immunohistochemical staining of melanocytes by APS I sera in preabsorption experiments (Fig. 4). In addition, in the three patients with vitiligo unrelated to APS I, a strong reactivity was only detected against SOX10. Unlike SOX10, expression of SOX9 has not been reported in melanocytes. Mutations in the SOX9 gene, causing skeletal malformation syndrome, campomelic dysplasia, and autosomal sex reversal (female or ambiguous genitalia in individuals with an XY genotype) (38Foster J.W. Dominguez-Steglich M.A. Guioli S. Kowk G. Weller P.A. Stevanovic M. Weissenbach J. Mansour S. Young I.D. Goodfellow P.N. Nature. 1994; 372: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (1333) Google Scholar, 47Wagner T. Wirth J. Meyer J. Zabel B. Held M. Zimmer J. Pasantes J. Bricarelli F.D. Keutel J. Hustert E. Cell. 1994; 79: 1111-1120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar), have not been associated with pigment abnormalities. Using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction we were able, however, to detect both SOX9 and SOX10 transcripts in isolated human melanocytes. Also, using Western blot on lysate from human melanocytes, we identified three bands recognized by sera from four of eight patients with APS I (Fig. 2). Two of these, the 79- and 65-kDa bands, corresponded to proteins also detected by the rabbit anti-rat SOX10 antiserum. Their electrophoretic mobility was lower than that calculated for the molecular mass of SOX10. We have no explanation for this difference, but similar discrepancies have been described (32Kuhlbrodt K. Herbarth B. Sock E. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Wegner M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 237-250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The third 45-kDa band was not seen with the specific SOX10 antibody and may represent another melanocyte antigen that has yet to be identified. Thus, it is possible that the autoimmune attack against melanocytes in vitiligo may involve both SOX9 and SOX10 as autoantigens despite the findings mentioned above that would support SOX10 as the major autoantigen. Of the vitiligo patients with APS I, 63% also had alopecia areata (p < 0.002), and we found that both SOX9 and SOX10 reactivity correlate with this combination of symptoms, whereas no correlation was found with alopecia areata alone. Other studies have found correlations between vitiligo and alopecia areata (18Cunliffe W.J. Hall R. Newell D.J. Stevenson C.J. Br. J.

In our recent study APS I sera also stained melanocyte nuclei in hair follicles (30Hedstrand H. Perheentupa J. Ekwall O. Gustafsson J. Michaelsson G. Husebye E. Rorsman F. Kämpe O. J. Invest.

This indicates that SOX10, and possibly also SOX9, are present in melanocytes in hair follicles and points to a possible role of melanocytes in the etiology of alopecia areata. Nuclear autoantigens have been described in systemic autoimmune diseases such as primary Sjögren's syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus (51Muhlen C.V. Tan E. Semin.

Immunoreactivity against other members of the high mobility group family of transcription factors has been demonstrated previously in sera from patients with primary pulmonary hypertension (52Morse J.H.

This may further indicate important immunogenic properties of this family of transcription factors. Antimelanocyte autoantibodies have been identified in sera from patients with vitiligo, but different frequencies have been reported. Autoantibodies precipitating melanocyte surface proteins were found in 78% of sera from patients with vitiligo, compared with only 14% of the control sera, although only a fraction of the proteins were shown to be melanocyte-specific (22Cui J. Harning R. Henn M. Bystryn J.C. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1992; 98: 162-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The frequency of autoantibodies against the melanocyte-specific enzyme tyrosinase, however, ranged from 10 to 60% of sera from patients affected by vitiligo, and even lower frequencies of autoantibodies against TRP-1, TRP-2, and Pmel17 were found (24Kemp E.H.

In this study we have shown that SOX9 and SOX10 are expressed in human adult skin melanocytes and identified them as autoantigens in APS I. Immunoreactivity against these proteins is associated with vitiligo in APS I. Strong reactivity against SOX10 is also detected in a subgroup of patients with idiopathic vitiligo. The relevance of the serum immunoreactivity against SOX9 and SOX10 for the development of vitiligo in these patients must be studied further. Epitopes recognized by autoantibodies may not be the same as epitopes recognized by T-cell receptors on autoreactive T-lymphocytes, and the development of autoantibodies may also be the consequence of cell lysis rather than the course of it. We still believe that these autoantigens may provide a new tool in the diagnosis and understanding of vitiligo, and furthermore the identification of SOX9 and SOX10 as autoantigens may also help in the development of new immunotherapeutic approaches for the treatment of melanoma.

https://openalex.org/W2045306157,"Proteolytic cleavage of the extracellular domain of CD44 from the surface of cells has been observed recently in different cell types. In cell culture supernatants of human melanoma cell lines a 70 kDa soluble CD44 protein (solCD44) was detected at concentrations of 250-300 ng/ml. Protease inhibitor studies revealed that serine proteases and metalloproteases are involved in the cleavage of CD44 from the surface of melanoma cells. To analyse a possible function of soluble CD44 a human malignant melanoma cell line was stably transfected with cDNAs encoding either wild type soluble CD44s or mutated forms with defective HA binding properties (CD44sR41A and CD44sR150A/R154A). Soluble CD44s almost completely inhibited hyaluronic acid binding by melanoma cells, whereas soluble CD44 mutated in the HA binding domain had no effect. When cultivated on hyaluronic acid, melanoma cell proliferation was induced by 30% for both the parental and the control transfected cells. This increase in proliferation was blocked completely in solCD44s-secreting transfectants, whereas solCD44sR41A and solCD44sR150A/R154A-secreting cells again showed hyaluronic acid-induced cell proliferation. These cell lines were subcutaneously injected into MF1 nu/nu mice to compare their growth as tumors in vivo. Compared to tumors derived from parental and control transfected cells, we observed a dramatic reduction of primary tumor growth with solCD44s expressing MM cells. Transfectants expressing solCD44s mutated in the HA binding domain in contrast developed fast-growing primary tumors. These results provide strong evidence that direct solCD44 interactions with hyaluronic acid interfere competitively with processes induced by hyaluronic acid binding to surface CD44. Autocrine, or drug-induced secretion of solCD44 by human melanoma cells may thus exert potent antitumoral effects in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1979898371,"We investigated the role of radiation-induced mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway activity in the regulation of proliferation, cell survival and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production in primary astrocytes and in T9 and RT2 glioblastoma cells derived from Fisher 344 rats. In these cells, ionizing radiation (2 Gy) caused activation of the MAPK pathway which was blocked by specific inhibitor drugs. Blunting of radiation-induced MAPK activity weakly enhanced radiation-induced apoptosis 24 h after exposure in RT2 cells. Furthermore, blunting of MAPK activation weakly enhanced the ability of radiation to reduce RT2 cell growth in clonogenic growth assays. These findings argue that inhibition of MAPK signaling reduces proliferation and enhances cell killing by ionizing radiation in transformed astrocytes. Proliferation and survival of cancer cells has been linked in vivo to enhanced expression of angiogenic growth factors. Recently we demonstrated that the gene product of a novel rodent radiation-responsive gene, progression elevated gene 3 (PEG-3), could enhance vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) promoter activity in rodent fibroblasts, leading to increased VEGF protein levels and tumorigenic behavior in vivo. Thus PEG-3 and VEGF expression could be expected to directly correlate with the oncogenic potential of transformed cells. RT2 cells expressed more PEG-3 and VEGF protein than T9 cells, and were more tumorigenic in vivo than T9 cells. Radiation activated the PEG-3 promoter via MAPK signaling and ectopic over-expression of PEG-3 enhanced both basal MAPK activity and basal VEGF promoter activity. Basal MAPK activity partially correlated with basal VEGF promoter activity and VEGF protein levels in primary astrocytes, T9 and RT2 cells. Radiation increased the activity of the VEGF promoter and VEGF protein levels in primary astrocytes, T9 and RT2 cells which were dependent upon MAPK function. Furthermore, inhibition of AP-1 transcription factor signaling by dominant negative c-Jun (TAM67) also significantly reduced basal, and to a lesser extent radiation-induced, VEGF promoter function in RT2 cells. Collectively, our data demonstrate that radiation-induced MAPK signaling can both protect cells from radiation-induced cell death as well as enhance protein levels of pro-angiogenic factors such as VEGF. Enhanced VEGF expression in RT2 cells may be mediated via MAPK and JNK pathway signaling which converges upon the AP-1 transcription factor complex."

A 2 blocked synthesis of murein precursors in vivo by inhibiting MurA, the catalyst of the committed step of murein biosynthesis. An A 2 -resistance mutation mapped to an exposed surface near the substrate-binding cleft of MurA. Moreover, purified Qβ virions inhibited wild-type MurA, but not the mutant MurA, in vitro. Thus, the two small phages characterized for their lysis strategy, Qβ and the small DNA phage φX174, effect host lysis by targeting different enzymes in the multistep, universally conserved pathway of cell wall biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2089020917,"The p53 tumor suppressor is regulated by the MDM2 oncoprotein. Overexpression of MDM2 maintains p53 at low levels and contributes to the functional inactivation of p53 in a subset of tumors. We found that treatment with roscovitine and olomoucin, which were originally developed as cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors, can efficiently stabilize and activate nuclear p53 in tumor cells with MDM2 amplification or cytoplasmic p53. These inhibitors block the degradation of p53 without affecting p53-MDM2 binding and the nuclear shuttling function of p53 and MDM2. Roscovitine also induces stabilization of the p53 Ala-315 mutant, indicating that it does not act by regulating the CDK phosphorylation of serine 315. Roscovitine induces down-regulation of MDM2 expression at both protein and mRNA levels. Ectopic expression of MDM2 can abrogate the ability of roscovitine to induce p53 stabilization. Low concentrations of roscovitine cooperate with the DNA-damaging agent camptothecin to activate p53 in a synergistic fashion. These results show that the small molecule CDK inhibitors can be used to activate p53 through their potent inhibitory effect on MDM2 expression and may be useful as sensitizing agents for other DNA-damaging drugs."
https://openalex.org/W1991523959,"Aneuploidy is a characteristic of the majority of human cancers, and recent studies suggest that defects of mitotic checkpoints play a role in carcinogenesis. MAD1L1 is a checkpoint gene, and its dysfunction is associated with chromosomal instability. Rare mutations of this gene have been reported in colon and lung cancers. We examined a total of 44 cell lines (hematopoietic, prostate, osteosarcoma, breast, glioblastoma and lung) and 133 fresh cancer cells (hematopoietic, prostate, breast and glioblastoma) for alterations of MAD1L1 by RT-PCR-SSCP and nucleotide sequencing. Eight mutations consisting of missense, nonsense and frameshift mutations were found, together with a number of nucleotide polymorphisms. All the alterations in cell lines were heterozygous. Frequency of mutations was relatively high in prostate cancer (2/7 cell lines and 2/33 tumor specimens). We placed a mutant truncated MAD1L1, found in a lymphoma sample, into HOS, Ht161 and SJSA cell lines and found that it was less inhibitory than wild type MAD1L1 at decreasing cell proliferation. Co-expression experiments showed that the mutant form had a dominant-negative effect. Furthermore, this mutant impaired the mitotic checkpoint as shown by decreased mitotic indices in HOS cells expressing mutant MAD1L1 after culture with the microtubule-disrupting agent, nocodazole. Our results suggest a pathogenic role of MAD1L1 mutations in various types of human cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2327140587,"Chronic hepatitis B virus infection is strongly associated with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Epithelial tumors are frequently characterized by loss of cadherin expression or function. Cadherin-dependent adhesion prevents the acquisition of a migratory and invasive phenotype, and loss of its function is itself enough for the progression from adenoma to carcinoma. The HBx protein of hepatitis B virus is thought to contribute to the development of the carcinoma, however, its role in the oncogenic and metastatic processes is far from being fully understood. We report herein the ability of HBx to disrupt intercellular adhesion in three different cell lines stably transfected with an inducible HBx expression vector. The linkage between the actin cytoskeleton and cadherin complex, which is essential for its function, is disrupted in the presence of HBx, as indicated by detergent solubility and immunoprecipitation experiments. In addition, beta-catenin was tyrosine phosphorylated in HBx-expressing cells. Inhibition of the src family of tyrosine kinases resulted in the prevention of the disruption of adherens junctions. These results suggest that HBx is able to disrupt intercellular adhesion in a src-dependent manner, and provide a novel mechanism by which HBx may contribute to the development of HCC."

https://openalex.org/W2038883360,"We have previously demonstrated that the transition of melanoma to the metastatic phenotype is associated with a loss of expression of the transcription factor AP-2. To further investigate the role of AP-2 in the progression of human melanoma, we attempted to inactivate AP-2 in primary cutaneous SB-2 melanoma cells by using a dominant-negative AP-2, or AP-2B, gene. AP-2B is an alternatively spliced AP-2 variant capable of inhibiting AP-2 trans-activator function. Stable transfection of primary cutaneous melanoma SB-2 cells with the dominant-negative AP-2B gene was confirmed by RT--PCR and Northern blot analyses. Electromobility shift assay using nuclear extracts from these cell lines demonstrated decreased functional binding of AP-2B-transfected cells to the AP-2 consensus binding sequence compared with neo-transfected controls. In addition, CAT activity driven by a construct containing the AP-2 consensus binding sequence was downregulated in the AP-2B transfected cells, indicating AP-2 activity was quenched in the transfected cells. Orthotopic (subcutaneous) injection of the dominant-negative (AP-2B)-transfected cell lines into nude mice increased their tumorigenicity compared to control neo-transfected cells. The AP-2B-transfected cells displayed an increase in MMP-2 expression (by Northern blot) and MMP-2 activity (by zymography), which resulted in an increase in invasiveness through Matrigel-coated filters. The AP-2B-transfected tumors also displayed an increase in MMP-2 expression, microvessel density, and angiogenesis in vivo. These results demonstrate that inactivation of AP-2 contributes to the progression of melanoma, at least partially via deregulation of the MMP-2 gene."

Here we describe this phenomenon for the MAP kinase phosphatase 1 (MKP-1) immediate early gene. In rat GH4C1 pituitary cells, MKP-1 mRNA is rapidly and transiently induced by the thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and the epidermal growth factor EGF via transcriptional activation of the gene. Ca2+signals are necessary for the induction of MKP-1 in response to TRH but not to EGF. Reporter gene analysis with the newly cloned rat promoter sequence shows only limited induction in response to various stimuli, including TRH or EGF. By nuclear run-on assays we demonstrate that in basal conditions, a strong block to elongation in the first exon regulates the MKP-1 gene and that stimulation with either TRH or EGF overcomes the block. Ca2+ signals are important to release the MKP-1 elongation block in a manner similar to the c-fosoncogene.

Following stimulation, expression of immediate early genes (IEGs) precedes the expression of late response genes, the latter encoding for proteins implicated in specific functions. The best known IEG products are transcription factors such as c-Fos, c-Jun, and c-Myc, which control the expression of late response genes (1Herschman H.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 281-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar, 2Sheng M. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1990; 4: 477-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1963) Google Scholar). Not all IEGs encode for transcription factors. For instance, structural proteins like actin or tropomyosin, cytokines, and other regulatory proteins show a rapid and transient induction by growth factors (1Herschman H.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 281-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar).Recently, a group of dual specificity phosphatases have been identified as being IEG products induced by various stimuli (growth factors, stress, neurotransmittors, etc.; reviewed in Ref. 3Camps M. Nichols A. Arkinstall S. FASEB J. 1999; 14: 6-16Crossref Scopus (710) Google Scholar). These dual specificity (threonine/tyrosine) phosphatases have been named MAP kinase phosphatases (DSPs or MKPs), since they are effective in the inactivation of MAP kinases by dual dephosphorylation (4Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). MAP kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1/CL100/3CH134) is one example of this group of nuclear enzymes encoded by an IEG.

A comparison of the 5′-flanking sequence of the murine and the human genes revealed two conserved Ca2+/cAMP-responsive elements (CREs) and one E box motif in the promoter region of MKP-1. Recently, the upstream stimulatory factor, a member of the basic/helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper family has been shown to bind to the E box motif and transactivate MKP-1 expression in synergy with protein kinase A (10Sommer A. Burkhardt H. Keyse S.M. Luscher B. FEBS Lett. 2000; 474: 146-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Since multiple intracellular signals can target MKP-1 gene expression, it is likely that regulatory elements other than the CREs and the E box motifs may influence its transcription. Alternatively, additional regulation at the level of transcriptional elongation, termination, and/or mRNA stability may be important to control MKP-1 gene expression.Regulation of gene expression at the level of transcriptional elongation is well established in prokaryotes and in an increasing number of eukaryotic genes (11Spencer C.A.

Earlier studies in mammalian cells have reported that the IEGs c-fos, c-myc, hsp70, and tumor necrosis factor-α display a strong block to transcriptional elongation in the promoter-proximal region (13Fort P.

Characterization of the block in vivo, by either nuclear run-on or KMnO4 footprinting, showed that promoter-proximal pause sites in c-fos, c-myc, and hsp70 are important for controlling RNA polymerase II processivity (15Brown S.A.

In the case of c-fos, an additional transcriptional pause site is located in the first intron of this oncogene that is sensitive to Ca2+ stimulation (17Plet A. Eick D. Blanchard J.M.

The precise mechanism of intronic regulation of c-fos by Ca2+ signals is not known.Here we show a rapid and massive increase in MKP-1 mRNA triggered by either thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) or epidermal growth factor (EGF) in GH4C1 neuroendocrine cells. Ca2+ signals are necessary for the induction of MKP-1 gene expression in response to TRH but not to EGF. After cloning the rat MKP-1 genomic fragment, we demonstrate by a reporter gene assay that activity of the MKP-1 promoter alone cannot explain induction of MKP-1 expression in GH4C1 cells. Using nuclear run-on experiments, we show that control of MKP-1 transcription involves a block to elongation in the first exon. This block represents a decisive element in the regulation of MKP-1 gene expression.DISCUSSIONThis study identified a calcium-sensitive block to elongation within the first exon of the rat MKP-1 gene as an important element for transcription regulation. TRH strongly stimulates MKP-1 transcription by enhancing initiation and elongation by Ca2+-sensitive mechanisms. Stimulation by EGF resulted in a similar rise in MKP-1 transcription, based again on enhanced initiation and elongation but (in contrast to TRH) without the need for Ca2+ signaling. The involvement of a calcium-sensitive elongation block in MKP-1 gene expression is reminiscent of c-fos expression for which a block to elongation is an essential element (Fig. 6 and Refs. 20Collart M.A. Tourkine N.

This suggests that common mechanisms of intragenic regulation may be conserved between MKP-1 and c-fos.Change in MKP-1 and c-fos gene expression level, via potential deregulation of the block to elongation, may have physiological importance in tumorigenesis. For c-fos, it is well known that this oncogene is up-regulated in several tumor cells (e.g. 39–41).

These latter reports have suggested that up-regulation of MKP-1 may contribute to tumor growth by inactivating preferentially stress-activated MAP kinases (stress-activated protein kinase/Jun N-terminal kinases, p38) that can promote apoptosis in tumor cells exposed to toxic stimuli.The dual specificity MAP kinase phosphatases, DSPs or MKPs, inactivate MAP kinases by dual dephosphorylation. In turn, MKPs can be controlled in at least three ways: first by subtype-specific enhancement of their catalytic activity triggered by direct interaction with MAP kinases (46Camps M. Nichols A.

J. 2000; 352: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar); second by MAP kinase phosphorylation (in the case of MKP-1), which stabilizes the otherwise very labile protein (48Brondello J.M. Pouyssegur J. McKenzie F.R. Science. 1999; 286: 2514-2517Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar); and third by transcriptional activation of some MAP kinase phosphatases (e.g. MKP-1 and MKP-2) encoding for immediate early genes (4Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar).Transcription of the MKP-1 gene can be induced rapidly by multiple intracellular signals, including active mitogenic or stress-activated MAP kinase cascades, protein kinase C, cAMP, and Ca2+signals (5Charles C.H. Abler A.S. Lau L.F. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 187-190PubMed Google Scholar, 6Kwak S.P. Hakes D.J. Martell K.J. Dixon J.E. J. Biol.

Prior to our study, the induction of the human MKP-1 gene in HeLa cells, by the mitogenic stimuli EGF, fibroblast growth factor, or platelet-derived growth factor, was thought to be essentially mediated by activation through the promoter of the gene (6Kwak S.P. Hakes D.J. Martell K.J. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3596-3604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In our quantitative study, we show a clear discrepancy between the levels of induction for the MKP-1 mRNA and reporter gene assays with the promoter of MKP-1. We observed an 18-fold stimulation of the MKP-1 mRNA by TRH and EGF (Fig. 2 D), which contrasts with the 1.5- and 1.6-fold stimulation, respectively, of MKP-1 reporter gene expression from the promoter (Table I). This difference can have two possible explanations: (i) chromatin structure influences the basal activity of the gene and may tightly be regulated following stimulation, and (ii) further 5′- or 3′-end sequences not present in the promoter construct may be important to control MKP-1 gene transcription. We showed (Fig. 5) that a controlled release of a block to elongation in the exon 1 may explain part of this difference between exogenous and endogenous expression of MKP-1. Although quantitative data in reporter gene assays and nuclear run-on are not directly comparable for technical reasons, the abundance of nascent transcripts extending beyond the elongation block is enhanced 10–20-fold, respectively, by TRH and EGF, with a concomitant increase of only 4–6-fold in early transcripts (signal A, Table II); this result is again compatible with an important contribution of elongation control to the transcriptional activation.The transient transcriptional activation of MKP-1 by TRH and EGF results in a significant enhancement of MKP-1 mRNA at 30 min (Fig.1) but also at the protein level 1 h after stimulation (data not shown). It becomes thus evident that a tight control of MKP-1 gene transcription at the level of initiation and elongation, combined with its differential binding and catalytic activation by specific MAP kinases, provides a sophisticated mechanism for rapid and targeted inactivation of selected MAP kinase cascades.Calcium is a critical modulator of immediate early gene expression at different levels in mammalian cells. In contrast to a number of studies that examine the role of Ca2+ signaling by using Ca2+ ionophores and other nonphysiologic stimuli, we describe here the role of physiological Ca2+ signaling triggered by the releasing factor TRH in MKP-1 gene expression. TRH stimulates the release of Ca2+ from internal stores and provokes a prolonged precisely patterned Ca2+ influx, due to Ca2+ action potentials (34Schlegel W. Wollheim C.B. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 35Schlegel W. Winiger B.P. Mollard P. Vacher P. Wuarin F. Zahnd G.R. Wollheim C.B. Dufy B. Nature. 1987; 329: 719-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). GH4C1 cells stimulated by TRH in medium with low free extracellular Ca2+ result in the suppression of sustained intracellular Ca2+ signals. (32Li S.L. Godson C. Roche E. Zhao S.J. Prentki M. Schlegel W. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 13: 303-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 36Li S.L. Cougnon N. Bresson-Bepoldin L. Zhao S.J. Schlegel W. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 16: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We demonstrated marked differences in MKP-1 gene expression in the absence or presence of extracellular Ca2+ after TRH stimulation, which defines a physiological role for calcium in MKP-1 induction associated with the release of the block to elongation. In addition to Ca2+ signaling, TRH activates other pathways, notably through cAMP and MAP kinases. The residual TRH effects seen for MKP-1 transcription (Table II) in the absence of sustained Ca2+ signaling are probably due to such additional pathways.How does Ca2+ control MKP-1 gene transcription? Since very few reports have studied the regulation of MKP-1 gene expression, we can only speculate on responsive elements in the MKP-1 gene and relate them to known functional determinants in other Ca2+-regulated genes (e.g. c-fos). First, considering homologies between the rat, mouse, and human MKP-1 promoters, we find two conserved CRE elements and one E box motif. The CRE element and its binding protein CREB are known to mediate calcium signals in the nucleus for several genes including the c-fosoncogene. Ca2+-activated gene transcription is mediated through phosphorylation of CREB and the CREB-binding protein by CaM kinase IV. CREB phosphorylation is also a target for multiple signal transduction pathways, which involve different activated protein kinases (49De Cesare D. Fimia G.M. Sassone-Corsi P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 281-285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Thus Ca2+-, mitogenic, or stress-activated MAP kinases may control MKP-1 transcription, as in c-fos, through phosphorylation of CREB transcription factors at the level of initiation. Consistent with this idea, Sommer et al. (10Sommer A. Burkhardt H. Keyse S.M. Luscher B. FEBS Lett. 2000; 474: 146-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) have reported that the upstream stimulatory factor that binds the E-box motif in the promoter of MKP-1 cooperates with signals that stimulate CRE-dependent transcription.Other regulatory elements may be involved to control MKP-1 transcription by calcium. Recently, a Ca2+-regulated transcriptional repressor (DREAM) that binds to the DRE element has been show to control the transcriptional activity of the c-fos oncogene (50Carrion A.M. Link W.A. Ledo F. Mellstrom B. Naranjo J.R. Nature. 1999; 398: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). The DRE element in the human c-fos oncogene is located at 20 nt downstream of the transcriptional initiation site. A similar consensus DRE element is located in the first 10 bp of the rat, mouse, and human MKP-1 gene that could be a target for DREAM-mediated transcriptional repression. Alternatively, Ca2+ regulation of MKP-1 gene transcription may depend on transcription factors translocated to the nucleus by the calcium-activated phosphatase calcineurin (51Lim H.W. New L. Han J. Molkentin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15913-15919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 52Crabtree G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2313-2316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) or on an alternative Ca2+ signaling pathway sensitive to the calmodulin antagonist W7. Coulon et al. (23Coulon V. Veyrune J.L. Tourkine N. Vie A. Hipskind R.A. Blanchard J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30439-30446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) have reported that this latter calcium signaling pathway affects the intragenic regulation of c-fos expression via suppression of a transcriptional pause site.In summary, we have identified a novel gene, MKP-1, which is regulated at the level of elongation of transcription in a manner similar to the c-fos oncogene. While the mechanisms that control transcriptional elongation remain relatively unclear, MKP-1 gene expression studies conducted in parallel with the analysis of a similar phenomenon in c-fos expression are certainly useful to further advance our knowledge of the regulation of transcriptional elongation in eukaryotes and on immediate early gene expression in mammalian cells. Long term cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and neuronal plasticity are controlled by extracellular stimuli and require the synthesis of new gene products. Following stimulation, expression of immediate early genes (IEGs) precedes the expression of late response genes, the latter encoding for proteins implicated in specific functions. The best known IEG products are transcription factors such as c-Fos, c-Jun, and c-Myc, which control the expression of late response genes (1Herschman H.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 281-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar, 2Sheng M. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1990; 4: 477-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1963) Google Scholar). Not all IEGs encode for transcription factors. For instance, structural proteins like actin or tropomyosin, cytokines, and other regulatory proteins show a rapid and transient induction by growth factors (1Herschman H.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 281-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). Recently, a group of dual specificity phosphatases have been identified as being IEG products induced by various stimuli (growth factors, stress, neurotransmittors, etc.; reviewed in Ref. 3Camps M. Nichols A. Arkinstall S. FASEB J. 1999; 14: 6-16Crossref Scopus (710) Google Scholar). These dual specificity (threonine/tyrosine) phosphatases have been named MAP kinase phosphatases (DSPs or MKPs), since they are effective in the inactivation of MAP kinases by dual dephosphorylation (4Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). MAP kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1/CL100/3CH134) is one example of this group of nuclear enzymes encoded by an IEG. Although MKP-1 gene transcription is activated by multiple signals, such as mitogens (5Charles C.H. Abler A.S. Lau L.F. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 187-190PubMed Google Scholar, 6Kwak S.P. Hakes D.J. Martell K.J. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3596-3604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cytokines (7Guo Y.L. Kang B. Williamson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10362-10366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), oxidative stress (8Keyse S.M. Emslie E.A. Nature. 1992; 359: 644-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar), heat shock (8Keyse S.M. Emslie E.A. Nature. 1992; 359: 644-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar), or hypoxia (9Laderoute K.R. Mendonca H.L. Calaoagan J.M. Knapp A.M. Giaccia A.J. Stork P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12890-12897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), the precise mode of gene regulation of this immediate early gene by such stimuli remains unclear. A comparison of the 5′-flanking sequence of the murine and the human genes revealed two conserved Ca2+/cAMP-responsive elements (CREs) and one E box motif in the promoter region of MKP-1. Recently, the upstream stimulatory factor, a member of the basic/helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper family has been shown to bind to the E box motif and transactivate MKP-1 expression in synergy with protein kinase A (10Sommer A. Burkhardt H. Keyse S.M. Luscher B. FEBS Lett. 2000; 474: 146-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Since multiple intracellular signals can target MKP-1 gene expression, it is likely that regulatory elements other than the CREs and the E box motifs may influence its transcription. Alternatively, additional regulation at the level of transcriptional elongation, termination, and/or mRNA stability may be important to control MKP-1 gene expression. Regulation of gene expression at the level of transcriptional elongation is well established in prokaryotes and in an increasing number of eukaryotic genes (11Spencer C.A. Groudine M. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 777-785PubMed Google Scholar, 12Uptain S.M. Kane C.M. Chamberlin M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 117-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Earlier studies in mammalian cells have reported that the IEGs c-fos, c-myc, hsp70, and tumor necrosis factor-α display a strong block to transcriptional elongation in the promoter-proximal region (13Fort P.

Characterization of the block in vivo, by either nuclear run-on or KMnO4 footprinting, showed that promoter-proximal pause sites in c-fos, c-myc, and hsp70 are important for controlling RNA polymerase II processivity (15Brown S.A. Imbalzano A.N. Kingston R.E. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1479-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 17Plet A. Eick D. Blanchard J.M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 319-328PubMed Google Scholar, 18Pinaud S.

In the case of c-fos, an additional transcriptional pause site is located in the first intron of this oncogene that is sensitive to Ca2+ stimulation (17Plet A. Eick D. Blanchard J.M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 319-328PubMed Google Scholar, 20Collart M.A. Tourkine N. Belin D. Vassalli P. Jeanteur P. Blanchard J.M. Mol. Cell.

The precise mechanism of intronic regulation of c-fos by Ca2+ signals is not known. Here we show a rapid and massive increase in MKP-1 mRNA triggered by either thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) or epidermal growth factor (EGF) in GH4C1 neuroendocrine cells. Ca2+ signals are necessary for the induction of MKP-1 gene expression in response to TRH but not to EGF. After cloning the rat MKP-1 genomic fragment, we demonstrate by a reporter gene assay that activity of the MKP-1 promoter alone cannot explain induction of MKP-1 expression in GH4C1 cells. Using nuclear run-on experiments, we show that control of MKP-1 transcription involves a block to elongation in the first exon. This block represents a decisive element in the regulation of MKP-1 gene expression. DISCUSSIONThis study identified a calcium-sensitive block to elongation within the first exon of the rat MKP-1 gene as an important element for transcription regulation. TRH strongly stimulates MKP-1 transcription by enhancing initiation and elongation by Ca2+-sensitive mechanisms. Stimulation by EGF resulted in a similar rise in MKP-1 transcription, based again on enhanced initiation and elongation but (in contrast to TRH) without the need for Ca2+ signaling. The involvement of a calcium-sensitive elongation block in MKP-1 gene expression is reminiscent of c-fos expression for which a block to elongation is an essential element (Fig. 6 and Refs. 20Collart M.A. Tourkine N.

A random mutagenesis screen led to the isolation of mutations in the DNA binding domain that result in p53 being lethal even at moderate expression levels in yeast. Three independent mutants had an alanine change at the evolutionary invariant V122 in the L1 loop. The other toxic mutations affected codons 277 (C277R, C277W) and 279 (G279R). This latter amino acid change was also reported in tumors, while all the other mutations are novel. A recently developed rheostatable GALI promoter system that provides graded increases in expression of p53 was used to examine the transactivation function of the toxic mutations when expression was greatly reduced and cells were viable. At low expression levels the toxic mutants lacked transactivation from a 3xRGC responsive element (RE). Surprisingly some exhibited enhanced transactivation with p21 and bax REs. The V122A mutant was able to re-activate transactivation of various p53 tumor mutants and retained growth inhibition when co-expressed with dominant-negative tumor mutations. Upon expression in human Saos-2 cells the V122A p53 mutant caused growth suppression, was capable of transactivation and exhibited higher than wild type activity with the bax promoter in luciferase assays. A non-functional p53 tumor mutant was partially reactivated by V122A for both transactivation and growth suppression. Thus, the screen for toxic p53 mutants in yeast can identify novel p53 variants that may be useful in dissecting p53 regulated cellular responses and in developing p53-based cancer therapies."

In these cases the two-state kinetics of folding follow a molecular growth mechanism. Highly conserved residues of the hydrophobic core, making a definite set of native-like contacts, determine the formation of a specific folding nucleus onto which other parts of the molecule can grow. Mutations of residues forming these nucleus contacts are more deleterious for folding than others suggesting that the folding nucleus should be evolutionary conserved. This last phenomenon has been effectively observed in globins and cytochromes c families, and it has been proposed that likely it reflects a more general rule of protein folding (6Ptitsyn O.B. J.

The smaller N-terminal domain (domain I) adopts an α/β topology and provides most of the contacts with GSH. The larger C-terminal domain (domain II) is all-helical and contains some of the residues that form the hydrophobic binding site of the second substrate (14Reinemer P. Dirr H.W. Ladenstein R.

Alignment of all known GST structures (more than 100) shows that only 6–7 residues, i.e. less than 5% of the entire polypeptide chain, are strictly conserved. Despite this limited sequence similarity, all GSTs adopt the same native fold. GST structure analysis indicated that a limited number of residues, strictly conserved in the hydrophobic core, form two local structural motifs at the N-terminal region of the α6-helix (18Aceto A.

Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 21-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar) is a recurring motif present at the beginning of helices, which has been proposed to influence the formation of the α-helix. This local signal consists of reciprocal main chain-side chain hydrogen bonds between the N-cap (Ser/Thr) and the N-3 (Glu/Asp) residues of an α-helix. (The nomenclature proposed by Richardson and Richardson (22Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Science. 1988; 240: 1648-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar) is: N“-N′-N-cap-N1-N2-N3-N4; where N1-N4 belong to the helix and N-cap is the boundary residue). The hydrophobic staple motif (25Munoz V. Blanco F.L. Serrano L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 380-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 26Munoz V. Serrano L.

Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 21-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar) involves a specific hydrophobic interaction between residues located at the N′ and N-4 positions. It has been proposed that when present in combination with a capping box (expanded box (27Aurora R. Rose G.D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 21-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar)), the hydrophobic staple motif gives a cooperative effect in defining the α-helix starting point (25Munoz V. Blanco F.L. Serrano L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 380-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 26Munoz V. Serrano L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15301-15306Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, in a statistical analysis (25Munoz V. Blanco F.L. Serrano L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 380-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) it has also been shown to be present in the absence of a capping box, suggesting that it may represent an independent motif. Thus, the function of the hydrophobic staple motif in proteins and its possible independent role still remain to be clarified. By using a peptide obtained by chemical synthesis, we found that in GST the conserved N-capping box has a crucial role in the helix formation of the isolated α6-peptide (18Aceto A. Dragani B. Melino S. Allocati N. Masulli M. Di Ilio C. Petruzzelli R. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The possible functions played by the N-capping box and the hydrophobic staple motifs in the intact protein have been studied in hGSTP1-1, a member of the Pi class GST (18Aceto A. Dragani B. Melino S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 25518-25523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) indicated that the removal of this local motif greatly destabilizes the final structure of the protein as well as its folding pathway. However, the mutation of the capping residue at position N-3 (D153A) was more destabilizing than the N-cap mutation (S150A). Analysis of crystal structures of capping mutants, expressed at the permissive temperature of 25 °C (21Rossjohn J. McKinstry W.J. Oakley A.J. Parker M.W. Stenberg G. Mannervik B. Dragani B. Cocco R. Aceto A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), shows that the mutation of Asp153 results in greatly increased mobility of the loop preceding the α6-helix. This was essentially due to the complete loss of an extensive hydrogen bonding network formed by the side chain of Asp153 with other loop residues that stabilize the conformation of this structural element. Thus, the local denaturation of this part of the protein destabilizes the entire molecule even at temperatures as low as 32 °C and generates temperature-sensitive folding mutants, unable to refold at subphysiological temperatures (19Dragani B. Stenberg G. Melino S. Petruzzelli R. Mannervik B. Aceto A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25518-25523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The significance of the hydrophobic staple motif residues has been examined by site-directed mutagenesis in hGSTP1-1 (20Stenberg G. Dragani B. Cocco R. Mannervik B. Aceto A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10421-10428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This hydrophobic interaction formed by a loop (N′) and helical residue (N-4), by restricting the number of conformation of the α6-helix relative to the α1-helix, favors the formation of essential interdomain contacts and accelerates the reactivation of the unfolded polypeptide chain. These motifs, together with Gly146, always located four residues before the N-cap, form the highly conserved local sequence GXXh(T/S)XXDh which belongs to a substructure, previously referred to as GST motif II (18Aceto A.

Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2045-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), formed by the α6-helix and the preceding loop. While the role of the conserved glycine still remains to be determined, mutations of residues forming the capping box and hydrophobic staple motifs are particularly deleterious for refolding of hGSTP1-1, indicating that this subdomain behaves as a specific folding nucleus whose formation is critical during the refolding of the dimeric GSTP1-1. However, in other GST forms additional local interactions may be present and the structural changes occurring upon mutation of these conserved motifs might be different. It is therefore not obvious that the roles attributed to these conserved motifs are valid in other members of the GST superfamily. Moreover, it is interesting to note that GST motif II, as an internalized module, is also conserved in the core of other proteins such as eukaryotic translation elongation factor (EF1γ), lignin-degrading β-etherase, and prionic yeast protein URE2 (28Koonin E.V. Mushegian A.R. Tatusov R.L. Altshul S.F. Bryant S.H. Bork P. Valencia A. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2045-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Thus, studies aimed to investigate the universal role of these conserved residues have a broader interest. In the present work the role played by the conserved capping box and hydrophobic staple motif in the folding and stability of hGSTA1-1, belonging to alpha class GSTs, has been investigated by a combination of protein engineering and structure/function analysis. The results show that also in a member of this GST class the conserved capping box and hydrophobic staple motifs maintain a critical role for protein folding and stability. In particular, the hydrophobic staple is an independent motif and represents an intrinsic and conserved determinant of the polypeptide chain for folding velocity. Wild-type human GSTA1-1 was obtained by expression of a cloned cDNA in Escherichia coli XL-1 Blue (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as previously described (29Stenberg G. Björnestedt R. Mannervik B. Protein Expression Purif. 1992; 3: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). GSH and 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) were purchased from Sigma. Site-directed mutagenesis was employed to generate capping box and hydrophobic staple mutants. The following oligonucleotides were used for the mutations: L153A, 5′-AACAAGGCTAGCCGGGCTGACATTCATCTG-3′; L153G, 5′-AACAAGGGTAGCCGGGCTGACCATCTG-3′; I158A, 5′-AACAAGCTGAGCCGGGCTGACGCTCATCTGGT-3′; L153A/I158A, 5′-AACAAGGCTAGCCGGGCTGACGCTCATCTG-3′; L153G/I158A, 5′-AACAAGGGTAGCCGGGCTGACGCTCATCTG-3′; S154A, 5′-AACAAGCTGGCTCGGGCTGACATTCATCTG-3′; D157A, 5′-AACAAGCTGAGCCGGGCTGCTATTCATCTG-3′; S154A/D157A, 5′-AACAAGCTGGCTCGGGCTGCTATTCATCTG-3′. The reverse primer had the following sequence: 5′-GCCAACAAGGTAGTCTTGTCCATGGCTC-3′. Altered codons are underlined. The oligonucleotides were phosphorylated before use in inverse polymerase chain reaction. The expression clone pKHA1 (29Stenberg G. Björnestedt R. Mannervik B. Protein Expression Purif. 1992; 3: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) was used as a template. The polymerization reaction contained 0.8 µmeach of one mutagenic and the reverse primer, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 2.5 units of Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), the reaction buffer supplied with the enzyme and various amounts of template DNA. The temperature program was initiated at 94 °C for 10 min and followed by 25 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 65–70 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 9 min. The polymerization reaction was terminated at 72 °C for 30 min. The reaction product was recovered from agarose gel after electrophoresis and the DNA was purified using the GeneClean kit (BIO 101 Inc., Vista, CA) and ligated. The circularized DNA was than used to transform E. coli XL-1 Blue cells. The entire cDNA encoding human GSTA1-1 was sequenced to verify that no undesired mutations had been introduced in the polymerase chain reaction. Cultures of E. coli XL-1 Blue containing plasmids were grown in 300 ml of LB broth in 2-liter Erlenmeyer flasks at 37 °C. At anA 555 of 0.35, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.2 mm. From the time of addition the culture was grown for about 20 h at 25 °C. The subsequent purification of wild-type and mutant proteins was performed as described previously (29Stenberg G. Björnestedt R. Mannervik B. Protein Expression Purif. 1992; 3: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) with the only modification that the enzymes were purified on a GSH-Sepharose affinity column (30Aceto A. Caccuri A.M. Sacchetta P. Bucciarelli T. Dragani B. Rosato N. Federici G. Di Ilio C. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The intracellular protein yields of GST in bacteria were expressed as percentage of GST purified in relation to total cytosolic protein. The kinetic parameters, k cat and K m, were determined at 25 °C as previously described (31Aceto A. Di Ilio C. Lo Bello M. Bucciarelli T. Angelucci S. Federici G. Carcinogenesis. 1990; 11: 2267-2269Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The concentrations for GSH and CDNB were 2 and 1 mm, respectively. Spectroscopic properties of the mutants and the wild-type enzyme were also studied. A Jasco-600 spectropolarimeter was used for CD measurements in the far-ultraviolet region from 200 to 250 nm. Spectra were recorded at 0.3 mg/ml protein concentration with cuvettes of 0.1-cm path length in a thermostatted cell holder. Intrinsic fluorescence emission spectra were measured with a Spex (model Fluoromax) spectrofluorometer. The excitation wavelength was 280 nm and the λmax and the fluorescence intensity of emission spectra were analyzed at a protein concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. Enzyme was incubated at each temperature for 10 min at a protein concentration of 0.1 mg/ml in 0.1m potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) containing 1 mmEDTA and 5 mm DTT to prevent oxidative inactivation. The enzyme was heat inactivated in sealed Eppendorf tubes and the temperature was monitored with a Cryson telethermometer. The inactivation time courses were determined by withdrawing suitable aliquots at different time points from the denaturation mixture for assay of remaining activity. The activity was assayed in 0.1m potassium phosphate (pH 6.5) with 2 mm GSH and 1 mm CDNB at 25 °C. In no case could the thermal inactivation be reversed by lowering the temperature of incubation. When the refolding of human GSTA1-1 and its mutants was to be monitored, 10 µm enzyme was first denatured in 4 m guanidinium chloride (GdnHCl) (0.2m phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, pH 7.0) at 25, 32, 40, and 45 °C for 30 min and then diluted (defining time 0) 1:40 into renaturation buffer (0.2 mphosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, pH 6.5) at the same temperature. The final GdnHCl concentration was 0.1 mduring refolding. All refolding experiments were carried out by rapid addition of the denatured enzyme to the renaturation buffer. Recovered activity was monitored as a function of time by withdrawal of appropriate aliquots of the renaturation mixture followed immediately by dilution into 2.0 ml of assay buffer. Refolding rate constants were determined by non-linear regression analysis of the experimental data by using the KaleidaGraph 3.0.5 program (Abelbek, Software). Under our conditions, an equation describing a single exponential process can be fitted to the data, F(t) =A[1 − exp(−k f t)] +B, where F(t) is the activity at timet, A the amplitude, k f the rate constant, and B the activity value at time 0. The effect of a mutation on the energy of the transition state of folding can be calculated using transition-state theory in a similar manner to that reported by Jackson et al. (4Jackson S.E. el Masry N. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11270-11278Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The stability of the transition state of a mutant protein relative to that of wild-type is calculated from ΔΔG f = −RT ln(k f/k f′), where ΔΔG f is the difference in energy of the transition state of folding relative to the unfolded state between wild-type and mutant proteins; k f andk f′ are the respective rate constants of folding. The reactivation behavior of S154A, I158A, L153A, and L153G variants can be described by a single exponential equation. Thus, we have assumed: (i) that the enzyme reactivation follows, kinetically, a two-state model without intermediates so that the refolding rate, measured under native-like conditions, can be used to characterize the transition state for folding; (ii) that none of the mutations have any significant effect on the folding pathway, at least not when analyzed at subphysiological temperature. Refolded D157A, S154A/D157A, L153A/I158A, and L153G/I158A mutants were unstable even at 25 °C and not further considered in this study. Coordinates of GST x-ray structures were derived from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank via the Anonymous file-transfer protocol. The crystal structures were analyzed by using Hyperchem (Autodesk, Sausalito, CA) and MolView 1.4.6 (Purdue University) programs. Figures were generated by using the RasMol (v2.6, 1994–1996, Roger Sayle) program. At the N terminus of the α6-helix located in domain II, the sequence (Ser/Thr)XX-Asp is strictly conserved in all GST classes. In particular, as shown in Fig.1A, Asp157 and Ser154 in GSTA1-1 form a reciprocal side chain-main chain hydrogen bond network which is typical for a capping box motif. In addition to these interactions, Asp157 forms a very favorable hydrogen bond with the backbone NH group of an hydrophobic residue (Leu148) located in the long loop preceding the α6-helix. A previous sequence alignment study (18Aceto A. Dragani B. Melino S. Allocati N. Masulli M. Di Ilio C. Petruzzelli R. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) also revealed the presence of a second structural motif conserved at the N terminus of the α6-helix of all known GSTs. This motif corresponds to the specific (i, i+5) hydrophobic interaction, named the hydrophobic staple motif, formed between residue N′, located before the first helical residue (Ser154 in GSTA1-1, N-cap), and a residue N-4, located at position four within the helix. In GSTA1-1, the N′ and N-4 residues correspond to Leu153 and Ile158, respectively. It has been suggested that this motif, flanking the capping box, enhances the demarcation of the N terminus limit and serves to cause a reversal of the polypeptide chain direction as it forms the α-helix. Three-dimensional structure analysis of GSTs shows that the side chains of the hydrophobic residues at the N′ and N-4 positions are located within a distance of 4 Å from each other in all known GST structures and that the N′ and N-cap residues always adopt dihedral angles in the β-region of the Ramachandran plot. Thus, this supersecondary interaction possesses all structural characteristics of a hydrophobic staple motif and, despite the low overall sequence identity (in some cases less than 5%), is well conserved among GSTs and GST-related proteins. As shown in Fig. 1 B, Ile158, in addition to the hydrophobic staple interaction with Leu153, may form very favorable hydrophobic contacts with Trp21, Leu22, and Ala25 all belonging to an important structural element (α1-helix) of supporting the active site. To investigate the role of the conserved capping box motif, residues Ser154 and Asp157 in human GSTA1-1 were individually replaced with alanine producing the D157A, S154A, and S154A/D157A mutants by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. To investigate the role of the hydrophobic staple motif in the folding process, site-directed mutagenesis was also used to produce single variants L153A and I158A as well as the double mutant L153A/I158A. However, considering that an alanine residue potentially can still form during the folding process, a weak hydrophobic staple and a glycine cannot, the L153G variant and the corresponding L153G/I158A double mutant were also generated. All variants of GSTA1-1 were expressed in E. coli and purified in a single chromatographic step using a GSH affinity matrix. No more than 10% of the total enzymatic activity remained unbound for any of the different GST variants. Apparently, the mutations do not affect the affinity for GSH-Sepharose. The purified proteins were homogeneous as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (results not shown). Considering that some mutations could have resulted in temperature-sensitive species, protein expression of all mutants was performed at a growth temperature of 25 °C of the host cell. As shown in Table I, the yields of the D157A single variant and S154A/D157A, L153A/I158A, and L153G/I158A double mutants were very low (less than 1%). This, probably, reflects the fact that these variants fail to reach the native state even at a temperature below the physiological 37 °C.Table IIntracellular protein yields and kinetic parameters of wild-type and mutants of GSTA1–1 heterologously expressed at 25 °C in E. coliSpecific activity1-aUnits/mg (units/mg) is the specific activity of the purified enzymes expressed at 25 °C.

https://openalex.org/W2050624403,"Expression of the B-Myb transcription factor is directed by an E2F-dependent transcriptional mechanism to late G1 and S phases of the cell cycle, where its transactivation properties are enhanced post-translationally by cyclin A/Cdk2-mediated phosphorylation. Other experiments have shown that removal of the B-Myb C-terminus constitutively activates both transactivation and DNA-binding activities, suggesting that autoregulation by this inhibitory domain is counteracted by phosphorylation. We report here on further experiments to examine this hypothesis. The importance of this modification was first emphasized by showing that co-transfected dominant-negative Cdk2 (Cdk2DN) substantially reduced B-Myb transactivation activity. We then attempted to map the autoregulatory domain by analysing a series of progressively deleted C-terminal B-Myb mutants. Removal of just 29 C-terminal aa increased transactivation appreciably, however, maximal activity required removal of 143 amino acids (as in B-Myb + 561). Enhanced B-Myb + 561 function correlated with the acquisition of DNA binding activity to a single Myb binding site (MBS) oligonucleotide as determined by bandshift assays, however, further assays showed that even wt B-Myb could bind a DNA fragment containing three MBS. Although transactivation by B-Myb was severely dependent on hyperphosphorylation, neither inhibiting this activity by co-transfecting Cdk2DN nor augmenting it with cyclin A resulted in significant effects on DNA-binding. We also found that B-Myb could synergize with the CBP coactivator and that this cooperativity was cyclin A/Cdk2-dependent. Despite this, the physical association between these proteins was not influenced by the B-Myb phosphorylation status.

Heterologous expression in Escherichia coli was followed by investigation of the subcellular distribution of the mutant P450s and determination of the kinetic and substrate binding parameters for cholesterol. The results indicate that a hydrophobic region, comprising residues 214–227, forms a secondary site of attachment to the membrane in P450 7A1 in addition to the NH2-terminal signal-anchor sequence. There are two groups of residues at this enzyme-membrane interface. The first are those whose mutation results in more cytosolic P450 (Val-214, His-225, and Met-226). The second group are those whose mutation leads to more membrane-bound P450 (Phe-215, Leu-218, Ile-224, and Phe-227). In addition, the V214A, V214L, V214T, F215A, F215L, F215Y, L218I, L218V, V219T, and M226A mutants showed a 5–12-fold increased K m for cholesterol. Thek cat of the V214A, V214L, V219T, and M226A mutants was increased up to 1.8-fold, and that of the V214T, F215A, F215L, F215Y, L218I, and L218V mutants was decreased 3–10.5-fold. Based on analysis of these mutations we suggest that cholesterol enters P450 7A1 through the membrane, and Val-214, Phe-215, and Leu-218 are the residues located near the point of cholesterol entry. The results provide an understanding of both the P450 7A1-membrane interactions and the mechanism for substrate specificity.

The results provide an understanding of both the P450 7A1-membrane interactions and the mechanism for substrate specificity. The conversion of cholesterol into 7α-hydroxycholesterol represents the first and rate-limiting step in overall bile acid biosynthesis, the major pathway for cholesterol elimination in mammals. This reaction takes place in the liver and is catalyzed by the microsomal enzyme cytochrome P450 7A1 (P450 7A1) (1Myant N.B. Mitropoulos K.A. J. Lipid Res. 1977; 18: 135-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Russell D.W. Setchell K.D.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4737-4749Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar).

Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1222-1231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, little is known about the molecular basis for substrate specificity in this important P450.

A. 2001; 98: 3068-3073Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar), a paradigm is beginning to emerge: the mechanism for substrate specificity in the P450 superfamily is complex and determined not solely by residues located inside the enzyme active site (13Graham-Lorence S. Amarneh B. White R.E. Peterson J.A. Simpson E.R. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1065-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 14Graham S. Peterson J.A. Arch. Biochem.

Chem. 2000; 275: 26952-26958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike many enzymes, the substrate binding pocket of structurally characterized P450s does not form an open cleft at the molecular surface, but rather is buried inside the molecule. A channel connecting the protein exterior and the substrate binding site (substrate access channel) is seen in the structure of only two P450s, 102 and 51 (6, 12), and it is postulated that substrate entry in P450s is controlled by the opening motion of the substrate access channel (16Poulos T.L. Finzel B.C. Howard A.J. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5314-5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Although it is not clear how hydrophobic substrates reach the active site of soluble P450s, it has been proposed that in membrane-bound P450s the entrance of the substrate access channel is located within the membrane, thereby making it possible for lipophilic substrates to enter the enzyme directly from the lipid bilayer (10Williams P.A. Cosme J. Sridhar V. Johnson E.F. McRee D.E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 121-131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar,13Graham-Lorence S. Amarneh B. White R.E. Peterson J.A. Simpson E.R. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1065-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Peterson and colleagues (13Graham-Lorence S. Amarneh B. White R.E. Peterson J.A. Simpson E.R. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1065-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) have also suggested that the hydrophobic substrate is recognized initially on the membrane-associated surface of the protein by a hydrophobic patch of amino acid residues adjacent to the substrate access channel. The substrate then enters the mouth of the access channel and partitions into the buried active site as a result of hydrophobic interactions with the residues lining the substrate access channel. These interactions determine the orientation of the substrate as it enters the P450 active site. Our recent studies of mitochondrial P450s 27A1 and 11A1, demonstrating that residues in the putative substrate access channel contribute to regioselectivity of hydroxylation in this subset of P450s (17Pikuleva I.A. Puchkaev A. Björkhem I. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7621-7629Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), support Peterson's hypothesis. Microsomal P450s have a highly hydrophobic segment of about 20 amino acid residues at the NH2 terminus, which is believed to serve as a primary site of attachment to the endoplasmic reticulum (18Wachenfeldt C. Johnson E.F. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism, and Biochemistry. 2nd Ed. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1995: 183-244Crossref Google Scholar). In addition, several microsomal P450s appear to have other regions that are inserted in and interact with the lipid bilayer because these P450s stay bound to the membrane after removal of the NH2-terminal membrane anchor (4Karam W.G. Chiang J.Y.L. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1222-1231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Pernecky S.J. Larson J.R. Philpot R.M. Coon M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Site-directed mutagenesis and crystallographic studies of microsomal P450 2C5 identified topological elements that form the additional membrane binding sites in this enzyme (residues 30–45 before helix A, residues 60–69 following helix A, residues 376–379 and 201–210 that correspond to β strand 2-2, and the COOH-terminal end of the F-G loop, respectively) and suggested that association of P450s with the endoplasmic reticulum involves a monofacial hydrophobic surface of the protein formed by noncontiguous portions of the polypeptide chain (10Williams P.A. Cosme J. Sridhar V. Johnson E.F. McRee D.E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 121-131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). However, it is not established yet whether the same segments of the primary sequence are involved in the attachment to the membrane in different P450s. In the present study, we used site-directed mutagenesis to examine the role of a hydrophobic region in P450 7A1 comprising residues 214–227 (the putative F-G loop and the adjacent helical segments). The results suggest that this region is a secondary membrane binding site in P450 7A1 and is also a region where cholesterol enters the enzyme active site. The work also provides experimental evidence that the mode of association of P450 7A1 with membrane is an important factor in regulating degradation of this physiologically important compound. The cDNA for human P450 7A1 in pUC18 vector was obtained from Dr. D. Russell (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center) and was used as a polymerase chain reaction template to modify the 5′- and 3′-portions of P450 7A1 cDNA. The 5′-primer for insertion of the full-length P450 7A1 into the expression vector was designed to introduce theNcoI site within the initiator codon ATG and to change the second codon ATG (Met) to GCT (Ala): 5′-CCCCCCATGGCTACCACATCTTTGATTTGGGGGATTGCT-3′. The 3′-primer was template-specific and contained a KpnI site downstream of the termination codon TGA: 5′-GAGCTCGGTACCTCACAAATGCTTGAATTTATATTTAAATTC-3′. The 5′-primer for insertion of the truncated (Δ2–24) P450 7A1 into the expression vector contained the NcoI site within the initiator codon ATG, GCT as the second codon, and a sequence corresponding to the codons 25–32 of the full-length cDNA: 5′-CCCCCCATGGCTAGGAGAAGGCAAACGGGTGAACCA-3′. The 3′-primer was the same as for insertion of the full-length P450 7A1 into the expression vector. The polymerase chain reaction products were digested withNcoI and KpnI and then subcloned into the expression vector pTrc 99A (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), digested previously with the same restriction enzymes. The correct sequence of the polymerase chain reaction-amplified fragments and the junction regions has been confirmed by DNA sequencing. The QuickChangeTMsite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) has been used to introduce point mutations into the cDNA encoding the truncated (Δ2–24) P450 7A1 in pTrc 99A expression vector according to the instructions. Complementary mutagenic oligonucleotides used are shown in TableI. The correct generation of desired mutations and the absence of undesired mutations were confirmed by sequencing of the cDNA region from upstream of the EcoRI site to beyond the DraIII site. TheEcoRI/DraIII fragments were then ligated into theEcoRI/DraIII-digested expression plasmid containing the wild type truncated P450 7A1. The subcloned fragments were then sequenced again to ensure the presence of the desired mutation and proper ligation.Table IOligonucleotides used to generate P450 7A1 mutantsMutationOligonucleotides1-aThe mutated nucleotides are underlined.V214A5′-GCAATTCGACAAAGCTTTTCCAGCCCTGGTAG-3′5′-CTACCAGGGCTGGAAAAGCTTTGTCGAATTGC-3′V214L5′-CAAGCAATTCGACAAGCTTTTTCCAGCCCTGGTAG-3′5′-CTACCAGGGCTGGAAAAAGCTTGTCGAATTGCTTG-3′V214T5′-CAAGCAATTCGACAAAACGTTTCCAGCCCTGGTAG-3′5′-CTACCAGGGCTGGAAACGTTTTGTCGAATTGCTTG-3′F215A5′-GCAATTCGACAAAGTGGCGCCAGCCCTGGTAGC-3′5′-GCTACCAGGGCTGGCGCCACTTTGTCGAATTGC-3′F215L5′-GCAATTCGACAAAGTACTTCCAGCCCTGGTAG-3′5′-CTACCAGGGCTGGAAGTACTTTGTCGAATTGC-3′F215Y5′-GCAATTCGACAAAGTGTACCCAGCCCTGGTAGC-3′5′-GCTACCAGGGCTGGGTACACTTTGTCGAATTGC-3′L218A5′-CAAAGTCTTTCCAGCCGCGGTAGCAGGCCTCC-3′5′-GGAGGCCTGCTACCGCGGCTGGAAAGACTTTG-3′L218I5′-CAAAGTCTTTCCAGCGATCGTAGCAGGCCTCC-3′5′-GGAGGCCTGCTACGATCGCTGGAAAGACTTTG-3′L218N5′-CAAAGTCTTTCCAGCCAACGTTGCAGGCCTCCCC-3′5′-GGGGAGGCCTGCAACGTTGGCTGGAAAGACTTTG-3′L218V5′-GACAAAGTCTTTCCCGCGGTGGTAGCAGGCCTC-3′5′-GAGGCCTGCTACCACCGCGGGAAAGACTTTGTC-3′V219A5′-GTCTTTCCAGCCCTGGCTGCAGGCCTCCCC-3′5′-GGGGAGGCCTGCAGCCAGGGCTGGAAAGAC-3′V219T5′-GTCTTTCCAGCCCTGACTGCAGGCCTCCCC-3′5′-GGGGAGGCCTGCAGTCAGGGCTGGAAAGAC-3′L222A5′-CCCTGGTAGCAGGCGCCCCCATTCACATGTTC-3′5′-GAACATGTGAATGGGGGCGCCTGCTACCAGGG-3′I224A5′-GTAGCAGGCCTCCCTGCGCACATGTTCAGGAC-3′5′-GTCCTGAACATGTGCGCAGGGAGGCCTGCTAC-3′H225A5′-GCAGGCCTCCCCATCGCGATGTTCAGGACTGC-3′5′-GCAGTCCTGAACATCGCGATGGGGAGGCCTGC-3′M226A5′-GCCTCCCCATTCACGCGTTCAGGACTGCGC-3′5′-GCGCAGTCCTGAACGCGTGAATGGGGAGGC-3′F227A5′-CTCCCCATTCACATGGCCAGAACTGCGCACAATGC-3′5′-GCATTGTGCGCAGTTCTGGCCATGTGAATGGGGAG-3′1-a The mutated nucleotides are underlined. Open table in a new tab Wild type and mutant P450s 7A1 were transformed into E. coli strain DH5αF'IQ (Life Technologies, Inc.) and expressed as follows. An overnight culture was diluted 1:100 into TB medium containing 100 µg/ml ampicillin and grown at 37 °C with shaking at 250 rpm until the absorbance at 600 nm was 1.0. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, δ-aminolevulinic acid, and chloramphenicol were added to final concentrations of 1 mm, 0.5 mm and 1 µg/ml, respectively, and expression of P450 proceeded at 26 °C for 48 h with shaking at 190 rpm. E. coli cells were harvested and suspended in 50% of the original culture volume in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (KPi), pH 7.2, containing 20% glycerol. The cell suspension was incubated with 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme for 30 min on ice. Spheroplasts were pelleted at 3,000 × g for 20 min and then resuspended in 10 mm KPi, pH 7.2, containing 20% glycerol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 µg/ml leupeptin, 2 µg/ml aprotinin, and 1 µg/ml pepstatin. After sonication on ice using six 20-s pulses at 1-min intervals, cell debris was removed at 3,000 × g (20 min). The supernatant and pellet obtained after subsequent ultracentrifugation at 106,000 ×g for 60 min were used as cytosolic and membrane fractions, respectively. Proteins in subcellular fractions were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (5 µg of the total protein/lane) and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Western blot analysis was carried out using rabbit antiserum against P450 7A1 and an ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. X-ray films were scanned, and the immunoreactive signal was quantified using NIH Image 1.52 software. Only exposures lying within the film's linear range of sensitivity were used. Statistical analysis of differences between the wild type and the mutants was carried out using SigmaStat 2.0 software. Harvested cells were suspended in 10% of the original culture volume in 400 mm KPi, pH 7.2, containing 1 m KCl and 20% glycerol, and incubated with 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme for 30 min on ice. After the addition of 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 µg/ml leupeptin, 2 µg/ml aprotinin, and 1 µg/ml pepstatin, the cell suspension was sonicated on ice using six 20-s pulses at 1-min intervals and subjected to high speed centrifugation at 106,000 × g for 60 min. The supernatant obtained after ultracentrifugation was applied to an octyl-Sepharose column equilibrated with 100 mm KPi, pH 7.2, 20% glycerol, and 0.3% sodium cholate. The column was washed with 5 column volumes of the equilibrating buffer, and P450 7A1 was eluted with the same buffer but containing 0.1% polyoxyethylene 10 lauryl ether. The fractions displaying a 450 nm CO difference spectrum were pooled, dialyzed against 10 mm KPi, pH 7.2, and 20% glycerol and applied to a hydroxylapatite column equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was washed with 10 column volumes of the equilibrating buffer, and P450 7A1 was eluted with 400 mmKPi, pH 7.2, 20% glycerol, and 0.15% sodium cholate. After dialysis against 40 mm KPi, pH 7.2, and 20% glycerol, P450 7A1 was aliquoted and frozen at −70 °C. The specific heme content of P450 7A1 after this step was 5.1 nmol/mg of protein. Cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase activity of P450 7A1 wild type and mutants was assayed in 50 mmKPi, pH 7.2, 0.05% Tween 20. The reaction mixture contained P450 7A1 (5–100 nm), 40 µg ofl-dilauroylglyceryl-3-phosphocholine, 0.5–9 units of rat NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (1 unit reduces 1 µmol of cytochromec/min), 2–200 µm cholesterol, and 120,000–240,000 cpm of [1α,2α-3H]cholesterol in a total volume of 1 ml. 1–10 mm cholesterol was added from a stock solution in 45% 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 1 mm NADPH (final concentration) carried out at 37 °C for 1 min and terminated by adding 2 ml of CH2Cl2. After extraction, steroids were evaporated, dissolved in methanol, and separated by HPLC as described previously for the cholesterol 27-hydroxylase assay (25Pikuleva I.A. Björkhem I. Waterman M.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 343: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The apparent K m and V maxvalues were determined from Lineweaver-Burk plots. Thek cat value was obtained by dividingV max by the molar enzyme concentration, which was measured by reduced a CO difference spectrum (26Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2370-2378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In all studies, less than 15% of the total cholesterol was metabolized during enzymatic reaction, and product formation was linear with time and P450 7A1. Rat NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase used in the enzymatic assay was expressed and purified as described (27Hanna I.H. Teiber J.F. Kokones K.L. Hollenberg P.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 350: 324-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The expression plasmid pOR263 was kindly provided by Dr. F. Guengerich (Vanderbilt University). Apparent binding constants (K d) of P450 7A1 wild type and mutants for cholesterol were determined from the double reciprocal plot of a substrate-induced spectral change versus substrate concentration added. The assay was performed using 1–2 µm P450 at 12 °C in 1 ml of 50 mmKPi, pH 7.2, containing 20% glycerol and 0.05% Tween 20. 1–10 mm cholesterol was added from a stock solution in 45% 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin. After each experiment, the P450 content was quantified to confirm that there was no denaturation during titration. Our approach was different from that reported earlier by Karam and Chiang (4Karam W.G. Chiang J.Y.L. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1222-1231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). First, we utilized a different expression vector (pTrc 99A). Second, in the cDNA encoding the full-length enzyme, we replaced the second codon with an alanine codon (GCT) and left the third codon unchanged. Third, a different E. colistrain (DH5αF'IQ) was used for protein expression. Fourth, optimal conditions for expression were established: temperature decreased to 26 °C, aeration speed increased to 190 rpm, and expression time increased to 48 h. Finally, during expression, we added chloramphenicol at the same time as isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and δ-aminolevulinic acid because we found that this antibiotic increases the level of expression of both full-length and truncated P450s 7A1 about 2-fold. Chloramphenicol was shown previously to enhance the expression of several different P450s (28Kusano K. Waterman M.R. Sakaguchi M. Omura T. Kagawa N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 367: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The resulting level of expression of the full-length and truncated P450s 7A1 was 50 and 520 nmol/liter of culture, respectively, which is higher than that reported by Li and Chiang for the full-length rat (29Li Y.C. Chiang J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19186-19191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the truncated human enzymes (4Karam W.G. Chiang J.Y.L. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1222-1231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on Western blot analysis, the full-length recombinant P450 7A1 is localized exclusively to the E. coli membrane fraction in both low (10 mm KPi, 20% glycerol) and high (400 mm KPi, 1 m KCl, 20% glycerol) ionic strength buffers, whereas about 40% of the truncated enzyme is found in the cytosol after subcellular fractionation in low ionic strength buffer. Twice as much (73%) truncated P450 7A1 is detected in the cytosol in high ionic strength buffer. Our results, which are in agreement with the literature data (4Karam W.G. Chiang J.Y.L. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1222-1231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), confirm the membrane anchoring role of the NH2-terminal residues 1–23 of the P450 and indicate the presence of additional (secondary) site(s) of attachment to the membrane. The solubilizing effect of high ionic strength implies peripheral association of the truncated form with E. colimembranes. Hydropathy plot analysis shows the presence of several hydrophobic regions in P450 7A1 in addition to the NH2-terminal membrane anchor (Fig.1). One of these regions (residues 214–227, Fig. 1) comprises the putative F-G loop, a topological element predicted to contribute to membrane association in microsomal P450s (13Graham-Lorence S. Amarneh B. White R.E. Peterson J.A. Simpson E.R. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1065-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) and shown to contain residues involved in the interaction with membrane phospholipids in P450s 2B1 (30De Lemos-Chiarandini C. Frey A.B. Sabatini D.D. Kreibich G. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 209-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and 2C5 (10Williams P.A. Cosme J. Sridhar V. Johnson E.F. McRee D.E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 121-131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). To begin to identify secondary membrane binding site(s) in P450 7A1, we used truncated (Δ2–24) enzyme in which we initially substituted one-by-one alanine for all hydrophobic side chains located within the putative F-G loop and the adjacent helical segments. We also mutated His-225, which has a side chain that can be positively charged and could interact with negatively charged phospholipids. Mutant P450s were expressed in E. coli and their subcellular distribution in low ionic strength buffer investigated (Fig.2). Replacement of a surface residue can increase the aggregation state of the P450 and result in appearance of the highly aggregated P450 in the membrane fraction, thus reflecting the limited solubility of the protein rather than specific membrane associations. Truncation significantly increased solubility of P450 7A1: the purified truncated protein remains soluble after the removal of detergent and can be concentrated until 30 mg/ml in the detergent-free buffer. Based on the dynamic light scattering, the truncated (Δ2–24) P450 7A1 forms heptamers in detergent-free, low ionic strength buffer and remains in the supernatant under the conditions of subcellular fractionation (106,000 × g, 60 min). Substitution with alanine decreased the hydrophobicity of all, except histidine, wild type amino acid residues, making it unlikely to decrease the solubility of the mutant P450. As is described below, the H225A mutation increased a fraction of the P450 in the cytosol, which indicates that solubility of this mutant is not significantly affected. Thus, studies of subcellular distribution of the mutant P450s could be used as a method to assess the possible contribution of the residue in question to membrane-protein interactions, providing the solubility of the mutant P450 is not significantly decreased.Figure 2Effect of mutations on subcellular distribution of truncated (Δ2–24) P450 7A1 in low ionic strength buffer (10 mm KPi, pH 7.4, 20% glycerol). Representative Western blots are shown on theleft. M and C indicate the membrane fraction and cytosol, respectively. Subcellular fractionation was carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fraction of P450 7A1 in the cytosol is expressed as a percentage of the total recovered in the membrane fraction and the cytosol. In all cases two independent expression experiments were carried out to isolate two sets of membrane fraction and cytosol. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was then carried out for each set independently, and one or two different gels were run independently for each set followed by Western blot analysis. The results represent the average of three to four different Western blot analyses ± S.D. Mean values that are significantly different (p < 0.05) from that of the truncated (Δ2–24) wild type P450 7A1 are designated by anasterisk. The dashed line shows the percentage of the wild type enzyme in the cytosol. Volumes of the amino acids are taken from Ref. 43Zamyatin A.A. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1972; 24: 107-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar. Hydrophobicity of the amino acids is based on the normalized consensus hydrophobicity scale (44Eisenberg D. Schwartz E. Komarony M. Wall R. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 179: 125-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1717) Google Scholar). Numbers inparentheses represent the volumes and the hydrophobicity of the wild type amino acid residue.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The V214A, H225A, and M226A replacements led to statistically significant increases in cytosolic P450 in contrast to alanine substitutions of Phe-215, Leu-218, Ile-224, and Phe-227, which resulted in up to a 1.5-fold increase of membrane-bound P450. Two mutants (V219A and L222A) showed no changes in subcellular distribution compared with that of the wild type truncated P450 7A1, indicating that Val-219 and Leu-222 are interior residues. We also investigated the subcellular distribution of the mutants that were generated as part of the kinetic studies (described below) (Fig.2). Replacement of Val-214 with Leu, which is bigger but of similar hydrophobicity, had little effect on P450 7A1 membrane binding properties. In contrast, substitution with the smaller and less hydrophobic Thr increased the amount of P450 in the cytosol, as observed for the alanine substitution. Thr is much more polar than Ala; however, the extent of retention of the V214T mutant in the membrane was the same as that of the V214A mutant, suggesting that it is the decreased size rather than the increased polarity of the side chain at position 214 which resulted in more cytosolic P450 7A1. Substitutions of Phe-215 with Leu, which is slightly smaller than Phe but twice as big as Ala, and with Tyr, which is structurally similar but much more polar than Phe, did not significantly affect the subcellular distribution of the mutant P450s. These data indicate that tighter membrane association of the F215A mutant is most probably caused by the reduction of the size of the hydrophobic side chain at position 215. Nonconservative and conservative replacements of Leu-218 with the smaller residues (the L218N and L218V mutations) led to more membrane-bound P450, although the substitutions had very different hydrophobicity, ranging from the same as that of the wild type to a very polar Asn. This is in contrast to the same size substitution with Ile resulting in no effect on subcellular distribution. A tighter binding of the L218N mutant compared with that of the L218A and L218V mutants could also be caused by the formation of the additional hydrogen bond(s) between the amide group of Asn and the phosphate moieties of the membrane. The V219T mutation, resulting in no alteration of the subcellular distribution, confirmed our prediction that the side chain of Val-219 is directed inside the protein molecule and not involved in the interaction with membrane. Truncation of wild type P450 7A1 did not affect eitherK m or k cat, validating the use of the truncated form for our studies. Partial purification of truncated P450 7A1 resulted in a 2-fold reduction of theK m and 3-fold reduction of"

The resulting cyclic structure imposes conformational restraints on proline-containing peptides relevant for structure and function of many physiologically important biomolecules. A key role for proline residues is the protection against nonspecific proteolytic degradation. Hence proline is frequently found and conserved in peptide hormones, neuropeptides, and growth factors (1Mentlein R. FEBS Lett. 1988; 2: 251-256Crossref Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 2Yaron A.

FASEB J. 1995; 9: 736-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Many bioactive polypeptides share a Xaa-Pro motif at their N termini shielding them against nonspecific N-terminal degradation. The degradation of these peptides requires proteases with specificity for the Xaa-Pro motif including proline-selective dipeptidases (dipeptidyl peptidases II and IV, cleaving the post-Pro bond) and aminopeptidase P (Xaa-Pro aminopeptidase, cleaving the pre-Pro bond). Cleavage of the Xaa-Pro motif by either one of these peptidases may initiate the proteolytic degradation/inactivation of the peptide or may result in an altered bioactivity (2Yaron A. Naider F. Crit.

APPs hydrolyze the peptide bond between any amino acid and a penultimate proline residue at the N termini of oligopeptide and protein substrates. A free amino group is required at the N terminus and the scissile bond must be in the trans configuration (15Yoshimoto T. Orawski A.T. Simmons W.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 311: 28-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The hydrolysis of dipeptides is very slow compared with the hydrolysis of longer chains, indicating the existence of a third subsite for substrate binding, which was confirmed for E. coli and mammalian APPs (10Orawski A.T.

Marceau C. Rouleau J.L. Adam A. Peptides. 2000; 21: 1903-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar).In higher plants, only very few peptides with hormone-like functions are presently known (22Schaller A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 40: 763-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 23Ryan C.A. Pearce G. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), but a more general role for peptides as signal molecules in the regulation of plant defense, growth, and development is anticipated (24Schaller A. Atta-Ur-Rahman Bioactive Natural Products. Elsevier, Amsterdam2001Google Scholar). Likewise, the proteases involved in the maturation and degradation of plant peptide hormones are still elusive. In the present work, we used a partial cDNA as a probe to isolate the cDNAs of two APPs from tomato. One of the enzymes (LeAPP2) was functionally expressed in E. coli, purified from bacterial extracts, and characterized biochemically. This is the first characterization of an APP from any plant source.DISCUSSIONAPP, like X-Pro dipeptidase (prolidase) and methionyl aminopeptidases of types I and II, belong to the M24 family in the clan MG of metalloproteases (36Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 183-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar, 37Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1998: 1394-1411Google Scholar). Whereas the overall sequence similarity between these enzymes is rather low, their C-terminal catalytic domains share a common structural feature called the pita-bread-fold (38Bazan J.F. Weaver L.H. Roderick S.L. Huber R. Matthews B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2473-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The structures of E. coli methionyl aminopeptidase and APP have been solved and two metal ions were found to be “sandwiched” in the pita-bread domain. The metal ions are liganded by two Asp, one His, and two Glu residues, respectively, which are strictly conserved in this family of proteases (35Wilce M.C.J. Bond C.S. Dixon N.E. Freeman H.C.

Biophys. 2000; 378: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The requirement of these residues for the catalytic activity of porcine APP has been demonstrated by site-directed mutagenesis (34Cottrell G.S. Hyde R. Lim J. Parsons M.R. Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15129-15135Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We report here the cloning and characterization of a related enzyme from tomato calledLeAPP2. This is the first characterization of an aminopeptidase P from any plant. LeAPP2 shares considerable sequence similarity with both E. coli and mammalian APPs in both the C-terminal pita-bread- as well as in the N-terminal domains. All the amino acid residues involved in metal binding (34Cottrell G.S. Hyde R. Lim J. Parsons M.R. Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15129-15135Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 35Wilce M.C.J. Bond C.S. Dixon N.E. Freeman H.C. Guss J.M. Lilley P.E. Wilce J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3472-3477Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) as well as two histidine residues implicated in proton shuttling between the solvent and the dinuclear metal center (35Wilce M.C.J. Bond C.S. Dixon N.E. Freeman H.C. Guss J.M. Lilley P.E. Wilce J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3472-3477Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) are conserved inLeAPP2 (Fig. 1).In addition to the structural similarity, LeAPP2 shares functional characteristics with known APPs. LeAPP2 expressed and purified from E. coli as a GST fusion protein exhibited APP activity, releasing the N-terminal amino acid from peptides with a penultimate proline residue. It was found to process typical substrates of mammalian APPs, i.e. bradykinin and substance P. The catalytic properties as well as structural similarity indicate a closer relationship with the cytosolic as compared with the membrane-bound forms of mammalian APPs. The pH optimum of 7.5 for LeAPP2 activity (Fig. 4 B) is consistent with its localization in the cytoplasm. Similar to the cytosolic APP from rat brain (7Harbeck H.T. Mentlein R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar),LeAPP2 clearly preferred Arg-Pro-Pro- (bradykinin) over Arg-Pro-Lys- (substance P), which indicates an extended binding site for recognition of the P‘2 residue of the substrate as it was reported for E. coli and mammalian APPs (10Orawski A.T. Simmons W.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11227-11236Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 15Yoshimoto T. Orawski A.T. Simmons W.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 311: 28-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Like the cytosolic APPs from E. coli, Rattus norvegicus, and Homo sapiens, but unlike the membrane-bound enzymes from R. norvegicus and Bos taurus, the tomato enzyme tolerates a Lys residue in the P‘2 position.LeAPP2 also hydrolyzed the N-terminal Pro-Pro- bond of processed bradykinin, albeit at a slower rate. Cleavage of the Pro-Pro- bond at the N terminus of oligopeptide substrates has also been reported for the cytosolic rat and E. coli APPs (7Harbeck H.T. Mentlein R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 41Yoshimoto T. Murayama N. Takashi H. Tone H. Tsuru D. J. Biochem. 1988; 104: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The rat cytosolic APP functionally expressed in E. coli, however, was found to be unable to hydrolyze the N-terminal Pro-Pro- bond of a synthetic oligopeptide substrate (13Czirják G. Burkhart W.A. Moyer M.B. Antal J. Shears S.B. Enyedi P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1444: 326-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Endopeptidase activity, i.e. the cleavage of the -Phe-Gly- bond in substance P, appears to be a unique feature of LeAPP2. The fact that protein preparations from E. coli cultures carrying the empty expression vector, as well as cultures expressing a truncated, inactive LeAPP2, were devoid of any proteolytic activity, unequivocally shows that the observed endoproteolytic activity is a property of LeAPP2 and not that of a contaminating E. coli enzyme.There are conflicting reports in the literature with respect to the metal requirement of APPs. Until recently, supported by the crystal structures of E. coli methionyl aminopeptidase and APP, which revealed the presence of dinuclear metal centers in both enzymes (35Wilce M.C.J. Bond C.S. Dixon N.E. Freeman H.C. Guss J.M. Lilley P.E. Wilce J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3472-3477Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 39Roderick S.L. Matthews B.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3907-3912Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), two manganese (Mn(II)) or zink (Zn(II)) ions per subunit were considered necessary for maximum catalytic activity in cytosolic and membrane-bound APPs, respectively (Ref. 14Cottrell G.S. Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15121-15128Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, and references therein). For methionyl aminopeptidase, on the other hand, two equivalents of cobalt (Co(II)) were proposed to be required based on the reproducible observation of highest activity in vitro in the presence of Co(II). Both the nature and the amount of metal requiredin vivo have recently been questioned, however.E. coli methionyl aminopeptidase was shown to be maximally activated upon addition of only one Fe(II) ion and iron is likely to be the in vivo ligand. Whereas the first Fe(II) ion is bound with high affinity (K d = 0.3 µm), theK d of the second metal binding site was reported to be 2.5 mm, and therefore, this site is likely to be unoccupied in vivo (42D'souza V.M. Holz R.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11079-11085Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 43D'souza V.M. Bennett B. Copik A.J. Holz R.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3817-3826Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Likewise, the two metal binding sites in human cytosolic APP (hcAPP) appear to differ in affinity. Upon expression in E. coli, this enzyme was found to contain only one equivalent of Mn(II), and this was sufficient to support proteolytic activity (14Cottrell G.S. Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15121-15128Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The hydrolysis of bradykinin and substance P by hcAPP was stimulated 2.7-fold upon further addition of Mn2+, whereas Mg2+, Ca2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+ were found to be inhibitory (in order of increasing inhibition, Ref. 14Cottrell G.S. Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15121-15128Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The effects of divalent metal ions on LeAPP2 activity are essentially the same as those observed for hcAPP (Fig. 4 A) and, therefore,LeAPP2 is also likely to be a single Mn(II)-dependent enzyme.The function of the second metal ion binding site remains obscure. Roles in the regulation of proteolytic activity or in positioning the substrate by binding its N-terminal amine group have been proposed (34Cottrell G.S. Hyde R. Lim J. Parsons M.R. Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15129-15135Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar,43D'souza V.M. Bennett B. Copik A.J. Holz R.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3817-3826Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). A competition of substrate and metal ion for the same binding site may explain the earlier observation that the inhibitory and stimulating effects of cations on APP activity can be substrate-dependent (44Lloyd G.S. Turner A.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 33: 60SCrossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 45Lloyd G.S. Hryszko J. Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 52: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).The enzymatic properties of LeAPP2 were further characterized using H-Lys(Abz)-Pro-Pro-pNA as the substrate for which an apparent K m of 15.2 ± 2.4 µmand a catalytic efficiency (K m/k cat) of 0.94 ± 0.11 mm−1 × s−1 were derived from steady-state kinetic analyses (Fig. 4 C). These values are within the range of catalytic constants reported for other APPs (2Yaron A. Naider F. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 31-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar,7Harbeck H.T. Mentlein R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 9Ryan J.W. Valido F.

Likewise, the inhibitor profile ofLeAPP2 is typical for APPs. LeAPP2 was found to be inhibited by chelating agents with 1,10-phenanthroline being much more effective than EDTA. Consistent with the essential role of histidine residues in binding of the active site metal and in catalysis, LeAPP2 was inactivated by a histidine-modifying reagent (diethylpyrocarbonate). Inhibition by 2-mercaptoethanol andN-ethylmaleimide may indicate a functionally important cysteine residue. There is, however, no cysteine residue conserved between the two tomato and human enzymes (Fig. 1). Alternatively, thiol reagents may compete with the substrate as a ligand of the active site metal. The inhibiton by both metal chelators and thiol reagents has been reported widely for other APPs (7Harbeck H.T. Mentlein R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 8Rusu I. Yaron A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 10Orawski A.T. Simmons W.H.

They will include oligopeptides with an amino-terminal Xaa-Pro motif. Such peptides may arise during protein degradation implying a function forLeAPP2 in protein turnover. Physiological substrates may also include plant peptide hormones implying a function forLeAPP2 in the regulation of hormone stability/activity. Considering the role of mammalian APPs in the degradation of bradykinin and substance P, it is tempting to speculate on such a function forLeAPP2. However, only very few peptide hormone-like signal molecules are known in plants (22Schaller A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 40: 763-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and none of them contains an N-terminal Xaa-Pro motif. They are therefore not likely to be substrates of LeAPPs. Yet peptides are anticipated to play a much broader role in plant signal transduction than presently appreciated (24Schaller A. Atta-Ur-Rahman Bioactive Natural Products. Elsevier, Amsterdam2001Google Scholar), and they may require APPs for the regulation of activity. Proline is unique among the proteinogenic amino acids in that its side chain is bonded to both the α-carbon and the amino group. The resulting cyclic structure imposes conformational restraints on proline-containing peptides relevant for structure and function of many physiologically important biomolecules. A key role for proline residues is the protection against nonspecific proteolytic degradation. Hence proline is frequently found and conserved in peptide hormones, neuropeptides, and growth factors (1Mentlein R. FEBS Lett. 1988; 2: 251-256Crossref Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 2Yaron A.

FASEB J. 1995; 9: 736-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Many bioactive polypeptides share a Xaa-Pro motif at their N termini shielding them against nonspecific N-terminal degradation. The degradation of these peptides requires proteases with specificity for the Xaa-Pro motif including proline-selective dipeptidases (dipeptidyl peptidases II and IV, cleaving the post-Pro bond) and aminopeptidase P (Xaa-Pro aminopeptidase, cleaving the pre-Pro bond). Cleavage of the Xaa-Pro motif by either one of these peptidases may initiate the proteolytic degradation/inactivation of the peptide or may result in an altered bioactivity (2Yaron A. Naider F. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 31-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar, 3Vanhoof G. Goossens F. De Meester I. Hendriks D. Scharpé S.

Aminopeptidase P (APP,1 EC3.4.11.9) was first isolated from Escherichia coli (5Yaron A. Mlynar D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1968; 32: 658-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and has subsequently been characterized from many microbial and mammalian sources (reviewed in Ref. 4Cunningham D.F. O'Connor B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1343: 160-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Mammalian APPs are now known to comprise at least two distinct forms, a cytosolic form and a membrane-bound form attached to the plasma membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor (6Hooper N.M.

APPs hydrolyze the peptide bond between any amino acid and a penultimate proline residue at the N termini of oligopeptide and protein substrates. A free amino group is required at the N terminus and the scissile bond must be in the trans configuration (15Yoshimoto T. Orawski A.T. Simmons W.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 311: 28-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The hydrolysis of dipeptides is very slow compared with the hydrolysis of longer chains, indicating the existence of a third subsite for substrate binding, which was confirmed for E. coli and mammalian APPs (10Orawski A.T. Simmons W.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11227-11236Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 15Yoshimoto T. Orawski A.T. Simmons W.H. Arch. Biochem.

Marceau C. Rouleau J.L. Adam A. Peptides. 2000; 21: 1903-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In higher plants, only very few peptides with hormone-like functions are presently known (22Schaller A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 40: 763-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 23Ryan C.A. Pearce G. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), but a more general role for peptides as signal molecules in the regulation of plant defense, growth, and development is anticipated (24Schaller A. Atta-Ur-Rahman Bioactive Natural Products. Elsevier, Amsterdam2001Google Scholar). Likewise, the proteases involved in the maturation and degradation of plant peptide hormones are still elusive. In the present work, we used a partial cDNA as a probe to isolate the cDNAs of two APPs from tomato. One of the enzymes (LeAPP2) was functionally expressed in E. coli, purified from bacterial extracts, and characterized biochemically. This is the first characterization of an APP from any plant source. DISCUSSIONAPP, like X-Pro dipeptidase (prolidase) and methionyl aminopeptidases of types I and II, belong to the M24 family in the clan MG of metalloproteases (36Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 183-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar, 37Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1998: 1394-1411Google Scholar). Whereas the overall sequence similarity between these enzymes is rather low, their C-terminal catalytic domains share a common structural feature called the pita-bread-fold (38Bazan J.F. Weaver L.H. Roderick S.L. Huber R. Matthews B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2473-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The structures of E. coli methionyl aminopeptidase and APP have been solved and two metal ions were found to be “sandwiched” in the pita-bread domain. The metal ions are liganded by two Asp, one His, and two Glu residues, respectively, which are strictly conserved in this family of proteases (35Wilce M.C.J. Bond C.S. Dixon N.E. Freeman H.C.

Biophys. 2000; 378: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The requirement of these residues for the catalytic activity of porcine APP has been demonstrated by site-directed mutagenesis (34Cottrell G.S. Hyde R. Lim J. Parsons M.R. Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15129-15135Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We report here the cloning and characterization of a related enzyme from tomato calledLeAPP2. This is the first characterization of an aminopeptidase P from any plant. LeAPP2 shares considerable sequence similarity with both E. coli and mammalian APPs in both the C-terminal pita-bread- as well as in the N-terminal domains. All the amino acid residues involved in metal binding (34Cottrell G.S. Hyde R. Lim J. Parsons M.R. Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15129-15135Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 35Wilce M.C.J. Bond C.S. Dixon N.E. Freeman H.C. Guss J.M. Lilley P.E. Wilce J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3472-3477Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) as well as two histidine residues implicated in proton shuttling between the solvent and the dinuclear metal center (35Wilce M.C.J. Bond C.S. Dixon N.E. Freeman H.C. Guss J.M. Lilley P.E. Wilce J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3472-3477Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) are conserved inLeAPP2 (Fig. 1).In addition to the structural similarity, LeAPP2 shares functional characteristics with known APPs. LeAPP2 expressed and purified from E. coli as a GST fusion protein exhibited APP activity, releasing the N-terminal amino acid from peptides with a penultimate proline residue. It was found to process typical substrates of mammalian APPs, i.e. bradykinin and substance P. The catalytic properties as well as structural similarity indicate a closer relationship with the cytosolic as compared with the membrane-bound forms of mammalian APPs. The pH optimum of 7.5 for LeAPP2 activity (Fig. 4 B) is consistent with its localization in the cytoplasm. Similar to the cytosolic APP from rat brain (7Harbeck H.T. Mentlein R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar),LeAPP2 clearly preferred Arg-Pro-Pro- (bradykinin) over Arg-Pro-Lys- (substance P), which indicates an extended binding site for recognition of the P‘2 residue of the substrate as it was reported for E. coli and mammalian APPs (10Orawski A.T. Simmons W.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11227-11236Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 15Yoshimoto T. Orawski A.T. Simmons W.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 311: 28-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Like the cytosolic APPs from E. coli, Rattus norvegicus, and Homo sapiens, but unlike the membrane-bound enzymes from R. norvegicus and Bos taurus, the tomato enzyme tolerates a Lys residue in the P‘2 position.LeAPP2 also hydrolyzed the N-terminal Pro-Pro- bond of processed bradykinin, albeit at a slower rate. Cleavage of the Pro-Pro- bond at the N terminus of oligopeptide substrates has also been reported for the cytosolic rat and E. coli APPs (7Harbeck H.T. Mentlein R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 41Yoshimoto T. Murayama N. Takashi H. Tone H. Tsuru D. J. Biochem. 1988; 104: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The rat cytosolic APP functionally expressed in E. coli, however, was found to be unable to hydrolyze the N-terminal Pro-Pro- bond of a synthetic oligopeptide substrate (13Czirják G. Burkhart W.A. Moyer M.B. Antal J. Shears S.B. Enyedi P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1444: 326-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Endopeptidase activity, i.e. the cleavage of the -Phe-Gly- bond in substance P, appears to be a unique feature of LeAPP2. The fact that protein preparations from E. coli cultures carrying the empty expression vector, as well as cultures expressing a truncated, inactive LeAPP2, were devoid of any proteolytic activity, unequivocally shows that the observed endoproteolytic activity is a property of LeAPP2 and not that of a contaminating E. coli enzyme.There are conflicting reports in the literature with respect to the metal requirement of APPs. Until recently, supported by the crystal structures of E. coli methionyl aminopeptidase and APP, which revealed the presence of dinuclear metal centers in both enzymes (35Wilce M.C.J. Bond C.S. Dixon N.E. Freeman H.C. Guss J.M. Lilley P.E. Wilce J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3472-3477Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 39Roderick S.L. Matthews B.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3907-3912Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), two manganese (Mn(II)) or zink (Zn(II)) ions per subunit were considered necessary for maximum catalytic activity in cytosolic and membrane-bound APPs, respectively (Ref. 14Cottrell G.S. Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15121-15128Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, and references therein). For methionyl aminopeptidase, on the other hand, two equivalents of cobalt (Co(II)) were proposed to be required based on the reproducible observation of highest activity in vitro in the presence of Co(II). Both the nature and the amount of metal requiredin vivo have recently been questioned, however.E. coli methionyl aminopeptidase was shown to be maximally activated upon addition of only one Fe(II) ion and iron is likely to be the in vivo ligand. Whereas the first Fe(II) ion is bound with high affinity (K d = 0.3 µm), theK d of the second metal binding site was reported to be 2.5 mm, and therefore, this site is likely to be unoccupied in vivo (42D'souza V.M. Holz R.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11079-11085Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 43D'souza V.M. Bennett B. Copik A.J. Holz R.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3817-3826Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Likewise, the two metal binding sites in human cytosolic APP (hcAPP) appear to differ in affinity. Upon expression in E. coli, this enzyme was found to contain only one equivalent of Mn(II), and this was sufficient to support proteolytic activity (14Cottrell G.S. Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15121-15128Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The hydrolysis of bradykinin and substance P by hcAPP was stimulated 2.7-fold upon further addition of Mn2+, whereas Mg2+, Ca2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+ were found to be inhibitory (in order of increasing inhibition, Ref. 14Cottrell G.S. Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15121-15128Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The effects of divalent metal ions on LeAPP2 activity are essentially the same as those observed for hcAPP (Fig. 4 A) and, therefore,LeAPP2 is also likely to be a single Mn(II)-dependent enzyme.The function of the second metal ion binding site remains obscure. Roles in the regulation of proteolytic activity or in positioning the substrate by binding its N-terminal amine group have been proposed (34Cottrell G.S. Hyde R. Lim J. Parsons M.R. Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15129-15135Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar,43D'souza V.M. Bennett B. Copik A.J. Holz R.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3817-3826Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). A competition of substrate and metal ion for the same binding site may explain the earlier observation that the inhibitory and stimulating effects of cations on APP activity can be substrate-dependent (44Lloyd G.S. Turner A.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 33: 60SCrossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 45Lloyd G.S. Hryszko J. Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 52: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).The enzymatic properties of LeAPP2 were further characterized using H-Lys(Abz)-Pro-Pro-pNA as the substrate for which an apparent K m of 15.2 ± 2.4 µmand a catalytic efficiency (K m/k cat) of 0.94 ± 0.11 mm−1 × s−1 were derived from steady-state kinetic analyses (Fig. 4 C). These values are within the range of catalytic constants reported for other APPs (2Yaron A. Naider F. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 31-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar,7Harbeck H.T. Mentlein R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 9Ryan J.W. Valido F.

Likewise, the inhibitor profile ofLeAPP2 is typical for APPs. LeAPP2 was found to be inhibited by chelating agents with 1,10-phenanthroline being much more effective than EDTA. Consistent with the essential role of histidine residues in binding of the active site metal and in catalysis, LeAPP2 was inactivated by a histidine-modifying reagent (diethylpyrocarbonate). Inhibition by 2-mercaptoethanol andN-ethylmaleimide may indicate a functionally important cysteine residue. There is, however, no cysteine residue conserved between the two tomato and human enzymes (Fig. 1). Alternatively, thiol reagents may compete with the substrate as a ligand of the active site metal. The inhibiton by both metal chelators and thiol reagents has been reported widely for other APPs (7Harbeck H.T. Mentlein R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 8Rusu I. Yaron A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 10Orawski A.T. Simmons W.H.

The fact that protein preparations from E. coli cultures carrying the empty expression vector, as well as cultures expressing a truncated, inactive LeAPP2, were devoid of any proteolytic activity, unequivocally shows that the observed endoproteolytic activity is a property of LeAPP2 and not that of a contaminating E. coli enzyme. There are conflicting reports in the literature with respect to the metal requirement of APPs. Until recently, supported by the crystal structures of E. coli methionyl aminopeptidase and APP, which revealed the presence of dinuclear metal centers in both enzymes (35Wilce M.C.J. Bond C.S. Dixon N.E. Freeman H.C. Guss J.M. Lilley P.E. Wilce J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3472-3477Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 39Roderick S.L. Matthews B.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3907-3912Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), two manganese (Mn(II)) or zink (Zn(II)) ions per subunit were considered necessary for maximum catalytic activity in cytosolic and membrane-bound APPs, respectively (Ref. 14Cottrell G.S. Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15121-15128Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, and references therein). For methionyl aminopeptidase, on the other hand, two equivalents of cobalt (Co(II)) were proposed to be required based on the reproducible observation of highest activity in vitro in the presence of Co(II). Both the nature and the amount of metal requiredin vivo have recently been questioned, however. E. coli methionyl aminopeptidase was shown to be maximally activated upon addition of only one Fe(II) ion and iron is likely to be the in vivo ligand. Whereas the first Fe(II) ion is bound with high affinity (K d = 0.3 µm), theK d of the second metal binding site was reported to be 2.5 mm, and therefore, this site is likely to be unoccupied in vivo (42D'souza V.M. Holz R.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11079-11085Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 43D'souza V.M. Bennett B. Copik A.J. Holz R.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3817-3826Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Likewise, the two metal binding sites in human cytosolic APP (hcAPP) appear to differ in affinity. Upon expression in E. coli, this enzyme was found to contain only one equivalent of Mn(II), and this was sufficient to support proteolytic activity (14Cottrell G.S. Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15121-15128Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The hydrolysis of bradykinin and substance P by hcAPP was stimulated 2.7-fold upon further addition of Mn2+, whereas Mg2+, Ca2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+ were found to be inhibitory (in order of increasing inhibition, Ref. 14Cottrell G.S. Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15121-15128Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The effects of divalent metal ions on LeAPP2 activity are essentially the same as those observed for hcAPP (Fig. 4 A) and, therefore,LeAPP2 is also likely to be a single Mn(II)-dependent enzyme. The function of the second metal ion binding site remains obscure. Roles in the regulation of proteolytic activity or in positioning the substrate by binding its N-terminal amine group have been proposed (34Cottrell G.S. Hyde R. Lim J. Parsons M.R. Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15129-15135Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar,43D'souza V.M. Bennett B. Copik A.J. Holz R.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3817-3826Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). A competition of substrate and metal ion for the same binding site may explain the earlier observation that the inhibitory and stimulating effects of cations on APP activity can be substrate-dependent (44Lloyd G.S. Turner A.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 33: 60SCrossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 45Lloyd G.S. Hryszko J. Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 52: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The enzymatic properties of LeAPP2 were further characterized using H-Lys(Abz)-Pro-Pro-pNA as the substrate for which an apparent K m of 15.2 ± 2.4 µmand a catalytic efficiency (K m/k cat) of 0.94 ± 0.11 mm−1 × s−1 were derived from steady-state kinetic analyses (Fig. 4 C). These values are within the range of catalytic constants reported for other APPs (2Yaron A. Naider F. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 31-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar,7Harbeck H.T. Mentlein R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 9Ryan J.W. Valido F.

Likewise, the inhibitor profile ofLeAPP2 is typical for APPs. LeAPP2 was found to be inhibited by chelating agents with 1,10-phenanthroline being much more effective than EDTA. Consistent with the essential role of histidine residues in binding of the active site metal and in catalysis, LeAPP2 was inactivated by a histidine-modifying reagent (diethylpyrocarbonate). Inhibition by 2-mercaptoethanol andN-ethylmaleimide may indicate a functionally important cysteine residue. There is, however, no cysteine residue conserved between the two tomato and human enzymes (Fig. 1). Alternatively, thiol reagents may compete with the substrate as a ligand of the active site metal. The inhibiton by both metal chelators and thiol reagents has been reported widely for other APPs (7Harbeck H.T. Mentlein R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 8Rusu I. Yaron A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 10Orawski A.T. Simmons W.H.

The function of LeAPP2 in planta remains obscure as long as the in vivo substrate(s) are elusive. They will include oligopeptides with an amino-terminal Xaa-Pro motif. Such peptides may arise during protein degradation implying a function forLeAPP2 in protein turnover. Physiological substrates may also include plant peptide hormones implying a function forLeAPP2 in the regulation of hormone stability/activity. Considering the role of mammalian APPs in the degradation of bradykinin and substance P, it is tempting to speculate on such a function forLeAPP2. However, only very few peptide hormone-like signal molecules are known in plants (22Schaller A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 40: 763-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and none of them contains an N-terminal Xaa-Pro motif. They are therefore not likely to be substrates of LeAPPs. Yet peptides are anticipated to play a much broader role in plant signal transduction than presently appreciated (24Schaller A. Atta-Ur-Rahman Bioactive Natural Products. Elsevier, Amsterdam2001Google Scholar), and they may require APPs for the regulation of activity. We thank Dr. Peter Macheroux (ETH Zürich) for help with the MALDI-TOF/MS experiments and D. Frasson for excellent technical assistance."

But when cells were treated with cycloheximide (CHX) or emetine, expression levels were restored to those observed in primary and immortal (10)10 MEF cells. However, levels of p53 mRNA were not changed in primary or (10)10 MEF cells by CHX treatment. De novo p53 mRNA synthetic rates were similar in primary, (10)10, (10)3, and (10)7 MEF cells treated with or without CHX. Treatment with actinomycin D (ActD) showed that p53 mRNA in primary and (10)10 MEF cells had a relatively long half-life of 22 h, compared to less than 2 h for (10)3 and (10)7 MEF cells. Pulse-chase analysis of p53 mRNA turnover using CHX and ActD showed that the rapid destabilization of p53 mRNA in (10)3 and (10)7 MEF cells could be regulated at the transcriptional and translational levels. In addition, the destabilization of p53 mRNA appeared to occur in the nucleus for (10)3 and (10)7 cells, but not for primary and (10)10 MEF cells. Taken together, the present study demonstrates that inactivation of the p53 gene occurs at the post-transcriptional level by rapid destabilization of its mRNA in the nucleus of spontaneously immortalized (10)3 and (10)7 MEF cells."

https://openalex.org/W2042964477,"L ike the Red Queen in Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There , both disease-causing microbes and their hosts have to keep running frantically just to stay in place. As described by Matt Ridley [ The Red Queen: Sex and the Evolution of Human Nature (Viking, London, 1993)], this seemingly futile race reflects the evolutionary forces that keep the lineages of pathogens and their targets alive, as each evolves new strategies for attack and defense. In this special issue on plant pathology, we explore just a few of the exciting lines of progress now yielding new insights into the evolutionary forces driving plant-pathogen interactions, as well as the practical outcomes in terms of pathogen management.

Perhaps we shouldn't be surprised, considering the audacity of pathogens as a whole, but recent discoveries have shown that the great divide between plants and animals is not unbreachable from the view of the pathogen. As Staskawicz et al . describe (p. [2285][1]), some pathogens use the same strategies to interact with plant and animal cells.

Showing similar obliviousness to distinctions between kingdoms, the cellular strategy of gene silencing is making itself apparent in a variety of developmental and disease responses. Vance and Vaucheret (p. 2277) discuss how plants use RNA silencing to degrade foreign RNAs, particularly the genomes of invading viruses. For their part, the viruses, participating enthusiastically in the Red Queen's race, are evolving means to suppress this degradation defense.

The success of a disease interaction, whether from the point of view of the surviving plant or of the victorious pathogen, depends on mechanisms of evolution. Bergelson et al. (p. [2281][2]) analyze the case of the resistance ( R ) genes, a highly divergent class of plant genes that confer resistance to specific strains of pathogens. Mechanisms of genetic exchange and adaptive evolution are intertwined to provide plants with a supply of newly divergent R- gene alleles, with new pathogen specificities.

Researchers trying to combat rapidly evolving plant pests also find themselves in the situation of the Red Queen. Two of the three articles in the News component of this special issue (pp. 2270 and 2273) focus on the many strategies—everything from high-tech genomics and genetic engineering to new agronomic practices—those researchers are using as they run to keep pace with the pests. The third (p. [2275][3]) deals with what happens when a plant disease—citrus canker in Florida—slips out of control in a new territory.

The stakes in this battle against plant diseases are high, because a huge portion of agricultural production is lost to pathogen and pest damage. In compensation, farmers plant more land. The implications, as Briscoe and Somerville point out in the Editorial (p. 2217), are far-reaching: Not only are more land and labor used by agriculture, but more water is also needed —so much more that in regions where water is scarce, it may be worthwhile to address plant disease as a way to conserve on water usage.
