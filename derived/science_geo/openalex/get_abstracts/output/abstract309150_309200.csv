https://openalex.org/W1971632431,"An array of alternating anion and cation exchange membranes can be used to generate electric power from the free energy of mixing of river and sea waters. A simple mathematical model, which predicts experimental results well, is useful in exploring conditions for optimization of the process. Major, but not impossible, improvements in technology would be required to bring the cost of power from the dialytic battery into line with foreseeable energy prices."

Treatments and maintenance of the soils were such that leaching, volatilization, photodecomposition, mechanical removal, and probably biological decomposition were at a minimum. These values may approach an upper limit of persistence of insecticides in soil."
https://openalex.org/W2158710069,"Local sea floor topography and also the thickness of the second layer of the oceanic rise-ridge system appear related to the spreading rate in the region. Slow spreading, away from the ridge center at 1 to 2 centimeters per year, is associated with a thick second layer, a central rift, and adjacent rift mountains. Fast spreading, 3 to 4.5 centimeters per year, is associated with a thin second layer and subdued topography lacking any central rift. The volume of lava discharged in this layer per unit time and per unit length along the crest of the whole active system is relatively constant regardless of the spreading rate. Total second layer discharge of the system has been about 5 to 6 cubic kilometers per year during the last several million years."

For certain other organisms, the vertical migrations observed in the experiments can be accounted for as direct responses to light intensity only. Performances intermediate between these extremes were also observed, as well as behavior based on biological timing mechanisms that are not rhythms in the usual sense."

The configuration of magnetic bodies that could account for the pattern supports the Vine and Matthews hypothesis for the origin of magnetic anomalies over oceanic ridges. A polarity-reversal time scale inferred from models for sea-floor spreading in the Pacific-Antarctic ridge and radiometrically dated reversals of the geomagnetic field indicates a spreading rate of 1.25 centimeters per year during the last 6 million years and a rate of 1.65 centimeters per year between 6 and 10 million years ago. A similar analysis of more limited data over the mid-Atlantic ridge near 22 degrees N also indicates a change in the spreading rate. Here a rate of 1.4 centimeters per year appears to have been in effect during the last 5 million years; between 5 and 9 million years ago, an increased rate of 1.7 centimeters per year is indicated. The time of occurrence and relative magnitude of these changes in the spreading rate, about 5 to 6 million years ago and 18 to 27 percent, respectively, accords with the spreading rate change implied for the Juan de Fuca ridge in the northeast Pacific."
https://openalex.org/W2057367018,"The rapidly growing water fern Azolla, which contains a nitrogen-fixing blue-green algal symbiont, has been studied as a possible system for photoproduction of molecular hydrogen. When this plant is grown on a combined nitrogen supply, photochemically generated hydrogen can be diverted through the algal nitrogenase system, which serves as a source of molecular hydrogen generated from water. This symbiosis has several advantages as a possible biological energy conversion system."

As the rate of increase was varied from 0.0374 milliamperes per minute to 37.4 milliamperes per minute, the intensity at which most pecking occurred varied from 2.2 to 5.0 milliamperes."

https://openalex.org/W2091821311,"Traditional reconstructions of the prehistory and early history of Southeast Asia contain two periods of contact between Southeast Asia and the West, these being the beginnings of the so-called Dongson Culture and the first historic state of Funan. There has been controversy as to whether the Western contacts which gave rise to the ""Dongson Culture"" came directly to north Vietnam around 800 B.C. or whether they were filtered through Chou China and reached north Vietnam about 300 B.C. In either case, primarily decorative patterns, ultimately from the European Bronze and Early Iron Age, and bronze-working came in together. The ""Dongson"" patterns spread over much of Southeast Asia and are still being used today in some areas. Research by historians and geographers indicated that the Kingdom of Funan existed somewhere in coastal Mainland Southeast Asia. From this work it was apparent that Funan was in some way connected with the trade between China and the West during the first millennium A.D. up until the end of Funan around 600 A.D. In both of these models of contact Southeast Asians were the passive recipients of whatever came from the West."
https://openalex.org/W2008261590,"The discovery of the radio frequency lines of OH gave the first positive evidence of the existence of OH in the interstellar medium. In the 3(1/2) years that have intervened, many observations have revealed totally unexpected anomalies in the radio-spectral properties of interstellar OH. As a result, no reliable astrophysical information has been derived from the OH observations, but a large body of information is waiting to be unraveled. The interpretations of the data which have been made, such as the values derived for OH/H abundance ratios or for the kinetic temperatures of interstellar gas clouds, must be viewed with caution. They may turn out to be drastically in error, once the origin of the OH emission and absorption is fully understood."

https://openalex.org/W2989271256,"The optical environment of spacecraft is discussed in terms of sky luminance, spacecraft corona, spacecraft scattered light, and glare sources. Rocket data show that sky luminance is not normally a significant factor; that spacecraft corona may be important at times; and that scattering from spacecraft protrusions and glare sources may be very significant. The range of effects for the scattered light sources is very broad and will depend on spacecraft geometry. An alternative approach in terms of primary sources is used to emphasize the overriding importance of sunlight scattered directly or indirectly."
