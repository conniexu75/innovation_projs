Little is known about factors that induce this reprogramming. Here, we demonstrate induction of pluripotent stem cells from mouse embryonic or adult fibroblasts by introducing four factors, Oct3/4, Sox2, c-Myc, and Klf4, under ES cell culture conditions. Unexpectedly, Nanog was dispensable. These cells, which we designated iPS (induced pluripotent stem) cells, exhibit the morphology and growth properties of ES cells and express ES cell marker genes. Subcutaneous transplantation of iPS cells into nude mice resulted in tumors containing a variety of tissues from all three germ layers. Following injection into blastocysts, iPS cells contributed to mouse embryonic development. These data demonstrate that pluripotent stem cells can be directly generated from fibroblast cultures by the addition of only a few defined factors."

Numerous sparse subsets of photoactivatable fluorescent protein molecules were activated, localized (to ∼2 to 25 nanometers), and then bleached. The aggregate position information from all subsets was then assembled into a superresolution image. We used this method—termed photoactivated localization microscopy—to image specific target proteins in thin sections of lysosomes and mitochondria; in fixed whole cells, we imaged vinculin at focal adhesions, actin within a lamellipodium, and the distribution of the retroviral protein Gag at the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1980942517,"Eukaryotic cells have evolved strategies to respond to stress conditions. For example, autophagy in yeast is primarily a response to the stress of nutrient limitation. Autophagy is a catabolic process for the degradation and recycling of cytosolic, long lived, or aggregated proteins and excess or defective organelles. In this study, we demonstrate a new pathway for the induction of autophagy. In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), accumulation of misfolded proteins causes stress and activates the unfolded protein response to induce the expression of chaperones and proteins involved in the recovery process. ER stress stimulated the assembly of the pre-autophagosomal structure. In addition, autophagosome formation and transport to the vacuole were stimulated in an Atg protein-dependent manner. Finally, Atg1 kinase activity reflects both the nutritional status and autophagic state of the cell; starvation-induced autophagy results in increased Atg1 kinase activity. We found that Atg1 had high kinase activity during ER stress-induced autophagy. Together, these results indicate that ER stress can induce an autophagic response.

Autophagy is a cellular degradation process for long-lived proteins and unnecessary or damaged organelles (1Levine B. Klionsky D.J. Dev.

Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 1542-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1193) Google Scholar). During autophagy, double membrane vesicles termed autophagosomes are formed, which sequester the cytosolic proteins and/or organelles as cargoes and then are fused with the vacuole or lysosome. After fusion, the inner membrane vesicles (subsequently termed autophagic bodies) are released into the vacuole/lysosome lumen, and the contents are degraded by resident hydrolases (2Yorimitsu T. Klionsky D.J. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 1542-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1193) Google Scholar, 3Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). This process is ubiquitous in eukaryotes from yeast to mammals and is essential for normal cellular development and differentiation (1Levine B. Klionsky D.J. Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 463-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3159) Google Scholar, 4Mizushima N. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 1535-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Autophagy occurs at a basal level and can be significantly induced, depending on the cell type, when necessary. In yeast, for example, autophagy is induced in response to nutrient starvation; following break-down of the cargo, the resulting macromolecules are presumably released from the vacuole lumen for reuse in the cytosol and supply the source for continued biosynthesis. Similarly, in higher eukaryotes, autophagy plays an important role in survival during starvation. In addition, mounting evidence shows that autophagy is associated with various pathophysiological conditions. For example, autophagy may remove aggregate-prone proteins, such as mutant huntingtin and α-synuclein, which cause neurodegenerative disorders (5Cuervo A.M. Stefanis L. Fredenburg R. Lansbury P.T.

Autophagy also functions in tumor suppression, possibly by removing damaged organelles to reduce the production of reactive oxygen species. In addition, autophagy is involved in the host immune response to invasion by certain bacterial and viral pathogens (8Levine B.

The Cvt pathway is highly selective and specifically transports at least two hydrolases, Ape1 (aminopeptidase I) and Ams1 (α-mannosidase), to the vacuole after sequestration within double-membrane Cvt vesicles (12Hutchins M.U.

Cregg J.M. Dunn Jr., W.A. Emr S.D. Sakai Y. Sandoval I.V. Sibirny A. Subramani S. Thumm M. Veenhuis M. Ohsumi Y. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 539-545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). Most of the Atg proteins localize to a perivacuolar site called the preautophagosomal structure (PAS), where the autophago-some and Cvt vesicle are thought to form (16Kim J. Huang W.-P. Stromhaug P.E. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 763-773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 17Suzuki K. Kirisako T. Kamada Y. Mizushima N. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5971-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). In eukaryotic cells, most proteins are either synthesized on soluble ribosomes or on ribosomes attached to the ER. Mis-folded cytosolic and nuclear proteins are typically tagged with ubiquitin and degraded via the proteasome (18Kostova Z. Wolf D.H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2309-2317Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 19Meusser B. Hirsch C. Jarosch E. Sommer T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 766-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar). The accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER induces the unfolded protein response (UPR), which results in the expression of chaperones and other proteins that act as folding catalysts (20Patil C. Walter P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Several studies have reported a linkage between autophagy and ER function. For example, the early secretory pathway is required for autophagy, possibly supplying membrane for auto-phagosome formation (21Hamasaki M. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Cell Struct. Funct. 2003; 28: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 22Ishihara N. Hamasaki M. Yokota S. Suzuki K. Kamada Y. Kihara A. Yoshimori T. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Mol. Biol.

Cell. 2004; 15: 2189-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Moreover, it was shown that fragmented ER membrane structures are transported to the vacuole within autophagosomes under starvation conditions; however, no relationship has been described between autophagy and ER stress (24Hamasaki M. Noda T. Baba M. Ohsumi Y. Traffic. 2005; 6: 56-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that ER stress in yeast cells induces an autophagic response.

Strain JLY27 (SEY6210 atg12Δ::Kan), UNY102 (SEY6210 TAP-Atg1), and UNY104 (UNY102 atg13Δ::LEU2) were generated through standard molecular genetics, using a PCR-based procedure. Yeast strains were grown or incubated in media as described previously (28Yorimitsu T. Klionsky D.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1593-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). For induction of ER stress, cells were incubated in SMD medium (synthetic medium containing 0.67% yeast nitrogen base with auxotrophic amino acids and 2% glucose) containing 3 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) or 2 μg/ml tunicamycin (TM) as described previously (29Back S.H.

Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). All chemical reagents were from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. Immunoblotting—Yeast cells were grown in SMD medium at 30 °C to A600 = 0.5, and either TM or DTT was added to each culture to induce ER stress. For starvation conditions, cells were cultured in SD-N medium (starvation medium containing 0.17% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and 2% glucose). At the indicated times, cells were collected, and proteins were precipitated by the addition of trichloroacetic acid. Protein extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with anti-Atg8 (31Huang W.-P. Scott S.V. Kim J. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol.

Brodsky, University of Pitts-burgh, PA), anti-Ape1 (13Klionsky D.J. Cueva R. Yaver D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 287-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) or anti-Atg1 antiserum (33Abeliovich H. Zhang C. Dunn Jr., W.A. Shokat K.M. Klionsky D.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 477-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), or anti-GFP antibodies (Covance Research Products, Berkeley, CA). Fluorescence Microscopy—Yeast cells expressing fluorescent protein-fused chimeras were grown for 4 h in SMD in the presence or absence of DTT or TM, or in SD-N. Fluorescence microscopy was carried out as described previously (28Yorimitsu T. Klionsky D.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1593-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Atg1 Kinase Assay—An in vitro phosphorylation assay using TAP-tagged Atg1 was performed as described previously (34Kamada Y. Jung U.S. Piotrowski J. Levin D.E. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1559-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Protein Incorporation Assay—Yeast cells were incubated with or without either TM, DTT, or CCCP (100 μm) at 30 °C for 4 h. Cells were incubated at 30 °C in SMD medium with 1.0 μCi of [35S]methionine. At each time point, cells were collected, and proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, resuspended in 0.1 n NaOH, and incubated at 40 °C for 10 min. The radioactivity was measured in a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman Coulter LS6500, Fullerton, CA). The PAS is the putative site where Atg components localize to compose the vesicle-forming machinery for autophagy and the Cvt pathway (16Kim J. Huang W.-P. Stromhaug P.E. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 763-773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 17Suzuki K. Kirisako T. Kamada Y. Mizushima N. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5971-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). Atg8 is a structural component on these vesicles and also a marker protein for the PAS. In order to test the effect of ER stress on autophagy, we first examined PAS formation by fluorescence microscopy by monitoring GFP-Atg8. Cells were treated with two distinct ER stressors, DTT, an inhibitor of disulfide bond formation, and TM, an inhibitor of N-glycosylation, at concentrations that induce ER stress. In the absence of DTT and TM, wild-type cells expressing GFP-Atg8 showed a punctate dot at the PAS under both growing and starvation conditions, because the PAS is formed for both the Cvt pathway and autophagy (Fig. 1A). In addition, we detected increased staining of the vacuole lumen in starvation conditions, reflecting the up-regulation of Atg8 and increased autophagy. In the presence of DTT and TM in growing conditions, there was an increase in the number of cells displaying punctate structures; 50% of the cells treated with DTT and 46% of the cells with TM showed punctate dots versus 19% of the cells with no treatment (Fig. 1A). In contrast to wild-type cells, GFP-Atg8 is not located at the PAS but is diffusely localized throughout the cytosol in vegetative conditions in the absence of the Cvt pathway-specific component Atg11, whereas PAS localization is restored, followed by transport to the vacuole, under starvation conditions reflecting an induction of autophagy (28Yorimitsu T. Klionsky D.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1593-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). We took advantage of the Cvt pathway-specific defect of the atg11Δ mutant to monitor the effect of DTT and TM. Treatment with DTT or TM in rich medium elicited localization of GFP-Atg8 at the PAS; essentially the same number of cells displayed punctate dots as seen with the wild-type strain (45% with DTT treatment and 46% with TM), suggesting that ER stress resulted in autophagic induction. Localization of GFP-Atg8 at the PAS was confirmed by the observation that TM- and DTT-induced GFP-Atg8 colocalized with RFP-Ape1, which is a PAS marker (data not shown). To check whether the PAS localization of GFP-Atg8 was dependent on the autophagic process under ER stress conditions, we examined GFP-Atg8 localization in atg12Δ cells. GFP-Atg8 did not show PAS localization in either growing or starvation conditions in the atg12Δ strain, as reported previously (17Suzuki K. Kirisako T. Kamada Y. Mizushima N. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5971-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar, 35Kirisako T. Ichimura Y. Okada H. Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Yoshimori T. Ohsumi M. Takao T. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 263-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). Similarly, in atg12Δ cells, treatment with TM or DTT was unable to cause localization of GFP-Atg8 to the PAS (Fig. 1A). These results suggested that PAS formation induced under ER stress was dependent on the normal autophagic machinery. We extended our analysis by examining Atg8 conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine (Atg8-PE) under ER stress conditions. When autophagy is induced in response to nutrient starvation, higher levels of Atg8/Atg8-PE are observed relative to growing conditions (31Huang W.-P. Scott S.V. Kim J. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5845-5851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 36Kirisako T. Baba M. Ishihara N. Miyazawa K. Ohsumi M. Yoshimori T. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 435-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). In nutrient-rich medium, the addition of either DTT or TM resulted in increased amounts of Atg8-PE as well as nonlipidated Atg8 at levels higher than those in starvation conditions (Fig. 1B). In contrast to the result in wild-type cells, Atg8-PE was not detected either in starvation conditions or in nutrient-rich conditions following treatment with DTT or TM in atg12Δ cells, although the expression level of Atg8 was increased significantly. This result was consistent with the microscopy data and suggested that ER stress induced autophagy in an Atg protein-dependent manner. Next, we confirmed that treatment with DTT and TM induced the UPR by monitoring the level of Kar2, an ER chaperone, which is induced by the UPR (37Normington K. Kohno K. Kozutsumi Y. Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Cell. 1989; 57: 1223-1236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). As expected, Kar2 was induced following treatment with either DTT or TM (Fig. 2A). In contrast, Kar2 was not substantially induced in starvation conditions that induce autophagy in the absence of these ER stressors. These results indicate that the UPR was induced under our experimental conditions of ER stress. We then extended our analysis by examining the transport of autophagosomes into the vacuole under conditions of ER stress. As a marker protein, we monitored GFP-Atg8-PE (referred to hereafter as GFP-Atg8), which remains associated with the inner autophagosome membrane and is transported into the vacuole concomitantly with the contents of the autophagic body (36Kirisako T. Baba M. Ishihara N. Miyazawa K. Ohsumi M. Yoshimori T. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 435-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar, 38Shintani T. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29889-29894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). After lysis of the auto-phagic body by vacuolar hydrolases, the GFP moiety is proteolytically cleaved from GFP-Atg8 and is relatively stable in the vacuolar lumen, whereas Atg8 is degraded. Accordingly, detecting free GFP through immunoblot can follow the delivery of autophagosomes to the vacuole. In wild-type cells, free GFP was quickly generated by starvation-induced autophagy (SD-N; Fig. 2B). This processing was blocked in an autophagy-defective atg1Δ strain, verifying its dependence on the autophagic machinery. A greatly reduced level of processing was seen under growing conditions (SMD). Cells that were treated with DTT or TM for 6 h showed the appearance of free GFP even in nutrient-rich conditions; however, the generation of free GFP was considerably lower and delayed relative to starvation conditions. atg1Δ cells did not show processed GFP following treatment with DTT or TM (Fig. 2B), although analysis of Kar2 indicated that the UPR was induced in the atg1Δ strain at a level similar to that seen in the wild-type strain (data not shown). These results indicated that processing of GFP-Atg8 occurred in an autophagy-dependent manner under conditions of ER stress. To further analyze the autophagic process under ER stress conditions, we monitored the processing of precursor Ape1 (prApe1). Ape1 is a vacuolar resident hydrolase and is synthe-sized as a precursor form in the cytosol. Precursor Ape1 is enwrapped within autophagosomes or Cvt vesicles, depending on the nutrient conditions, and is transported to the vacuole as a specific cargo via the Cvt pathway and autophagy. After transport to the vacuole, prApe1 is activated by removal of its N-terminal propeptide. In order to eliminate the constitutive maturation of prApe1 that occurs via the Cvt pathway, we used the vac8Δ mutant. Without Vac8, prApe1 maturation is blocked in growing conditions, whereas maturation is normal in starvation conditions (39Scott S.V. Nice D.C. II I Nau J.J. Weisman L.S. Kamada Y. Keizer-Gunnink I. Funakoshi T. Veenhuis M. Ohsumi Y. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25840-25849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). When vac8Δ cells were treated with DTT or TM, prApe1 maturation was observed, although it was again less efficient than that observed in starvation conditions (Fig. 2C). In contrast, neither starvation nor ER stress caused prApe1 processing in atg1Δ cells. Again, we observed induction of the UPR in both vac8Δ and atg1Δ cells based on analysis of Kar2 under these conditions (data not shown). This result was consistent with that observed with GFP-Atg8 processing. We confirmed that atg1Δ cells grew as well as the wild-type cells after the drug treatment, indicating that the defect of atg1Δ cells for GFP-Atg8 processing and prApe1 maturation was not due to loss of viability under ER stress conditions (data not shown). Taken together, we conclude that autophagy was induced in response to ER stress. To gain a further mechanistic understanding of the induction process, we examined Atg1 kinase activity. In nutrient-rich conditions or in the absence of Atg13, Atg1 kinase has lower activity in vitro (40Kamada Y. Funakoshi T. Shintani T. Nagano K. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1507-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). Starvation or treatment with the autophagy inducer rapamycin results in increased Atg1 kinase activity. When purified from wild-type cells treated with rapamycin, TAP-tagged Atg1 was able to highly phosphorylate the myelin basic protein substrate compared with TAP-Atg1 isolated in the absence of rapamycin (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the phosphorylation of myelin basic protein was extremely reduced when incubated with TAP-Atg1 from atg13Δ cells, even when the cells had been treated with rapamycin, as reported previously (40Kamada Y. Funakoshi T. Shintani T. Nagano K. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1507-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). When cells were treated with DTT or TM, TAP-Atg1 displayed a high level of kinase activity based on phosphorylation of myelin basic protein, similar to the result seen with rapamycin treatment. The increased kinase activity of Atg1 further suggested that autophagy was induced during ER stress. DTT and TM interfere with protein biosynthesis in the ER. Accordingly, these treatments might induce a starvation response by blocking the production of plasma membrane nutrient transporters. To eliminate this possibility, we investigated the uptake and incorporation of amino acids in cells treated with ER stressors. We incubated cells with or without TM or DTT for 4 h and examined the cellular uptake and incorporation of radioactive methionine into nascent proteins (Fig. 3B). Wild-type cells subjected to mock treatment with buffer showed a linear increase in acid-precipitable radioisotope with increasing time. Cells treated with DTT showed a level of incorporation similar to those without treatment. TM-treated cells displayed a reduced level of incorporation, but it was significantly higher than that seen with cells treated with the proton ionophore CCCP. These results suggest that cells were able to import extracellular amino acids and that they were not experiencing starvation conditions due to a block in nutrient uptake. Eukaryotic cells are able to respond to various types of stress caused by changes in the extracellular environment. Autophagy is one type of stress response. This process is normally maintained at low levels in nutrient-rich conditions, whereas it is highly activated in response to nutrient starvation (2Yorimitsu T. Klionsky D.J. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 1542-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1193) Google Scholar, 4Mizushima N. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 1535-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). In this study, we describe a new induction pathway of autophagy; DTT and TM, which are commonly used to cause ER stress (29Back S.H. Schroder M. Lee K. Zhang K. Kaufman R.J. Methods. 2005; 35: 395-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), allowed cells to induce autophagy in vegetatively growing conditions. Treatment with either drug results in accumulation of misfolded/unfolded proteins in the ER lumen. Subsequently, the UPR is activated to stimulate the expression of proteins that can relieve the stress condition (20Patil C. Walter P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 41Travers K.J. Patil C.K. Wodicka L. Lockhart D.J. Weissman J.S. Walter P.

Cell. 2004; 15: 2189-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), no relationship has been noted between autophagy and ER stress. Previous microarray results have characterized up-regulation of the transcription of hundreds of genes by ER stress. Among them, the mRNA of genes related to autophagy, including ATG8, ATG14, and APE1 are also transcriptionally induced (41Travers K.J. Patil C.K. Wodicka L. Lockhart D.J. Weissman J.S. Walter P. Cell. 2000; 101: 249-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar). In addition, it was very recently shown that in mammalian cells, polyglutamine- and drug-induced ER stress facilitated the conversion of LC3, a mammalian homolog of Atg8, from LC3-I to -II, which is an important step for autophagosome formation (42Kouroku Y. Fujita E. Tanida I. Ueno T. Isoai A. Kumagai H. Ogawa S. Kaufman R.J. Kominami E. Momoi T. Cell Death Differ. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar); however, it was still unclear whether functional autophagy actually occurred under these conditions of ER stress. Here we show that ER stress induced autophagy. We took advantage of the defect in PAS assembly in atg11Δ cells and monitored induction of autophagy by following GFP-Atg8 localization in response to ER stress. Atg8 is conserved from yeast to mammalian cells and is commonly used as a marker for the PAS and the autophagosome (17Suzuki K. Kirisako T. Kamada Y. Mizushima N. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5971-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). Unlike the situation in normal growing conditions, ER stress facilitated PAS formation in atg11Δ cells in an Atg protein-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). Next, we biochemically monitored the delivery of autophagosomes to the vacuole using two established marker proteins, GFP-Atg8 and Ape1. The delivery of autophagosomes, measured by the formation of free GFP or maturation of precursor Ape1, was observed in response to ER stress, although the level of the delivery was less efficient than that seen under starvation conditions (Fig. 2). Finally, Atg1 purified from cells under ER stress conditions showed essentially the same increase in kinase activity as that from cells treated with the autophagy inducer rapamycin (Fig. 3A). It remains to be determined whether ER stress affects Tor kinase or whether it acts indirectly on a downstream component or even on a different kinase, such as protein kinase A, that might also be involved in the Atg1 signaling pathway (43Budovskaya Y.V. Stephan J.S. Deminoff S.J. Herman P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13933-13938Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). To eliminate the possibility that DTT or TM induced autophagy indirectly by generating a starvation response, we monitored amino acid uptake of cells treated with these ER stressors. DTT-treated cells displayed essentially the same level of uptake and incorporation of radioactive methionine as nontreated cells, suggesting that these cells did not experience starvation conditions due to inhibition of the biosynthesis of plasma membrane permeases. Similarly, there was apparently no significant interference with the cell's translational machinery. The uptake and incorporation of methionine in TM-treated cells was less efficient, being about 70% of that seen with untreated or DTT-treated cells (Fig. 3B); however, this level was well above that seen with CCCP treatment. Ire1 is an ER membrane protein that senses accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER lumen. Active Ire1 splices HAC1 mRNA, and the spliced mRNA, which encodes a transcription factor, is translated into a functional protein. The active Hac1 protein induces the expression of genes encoding proteins involved in the UPR (44Cox J.S. Walter P. Cell. 1996; 87: 391-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). We observed that under ER stress conditions, depletion of either Ire1 or Hac1 blocked autophagy based on GFP-Atg8 processing and prApe1 maturation; however, both ire1Δ and hac1Δ cells also showed low viability under ER stress conditions. 3T. Yorimitsu, U. Nair, Z. Yang, and D. J. Klionsky, unpublished data. Thus, it was not possible to determine whether the Ire1-Hac1 signaling pathway is involved in induction of autophagy under ER stress conditions. The ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway is the primary degradation mechanism for handling misfolded proteins that cause ER stress (19Meusser B. Hirsch C. Jarosch E. Sommer T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 766-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar). During ERAD, unfolded proteins that accumulate in the ER lumen are exported (dislocated) into the cytosol through the translocon channel and then degraded by the proteasome. We speculate that autophagy functions as backup to ERAD if degradative substrates overwhelm the ERAD capacity (30Friedlander R. Jarosch E. Urban J. Volkwein C. Sommer T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 32Spear E.D. Ng D.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2756-2767Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). It has been known that there is a regulatory link between ERAD and the UPR (30Friedlander R. Jarosch E. Urban J. Volkwein C. Sommer T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). One of the next questions to address is how autophagy is associated with these two pathways under starvation and other stress conditions. In summary, our current report shows that autophagy is induced by ER stress. Previous studies have shown that stress caused by accumulation of cytosolic protein aggregates can mediate autophagy in mammalian cells (6Iwata A. Christianson J.C. Bucci M. Ellerby L.M. Nukina N.

The current surge of renewed interest in LDD, motivated by growing recognition of its critical importance for natural populations and communities and for humanity, promises an improved, quantitatively derived understanding of LDD. To gain deep insights into the patterns, mechanisms, causes, and consequences of LDD, we must look beyond the standard dispersal vectors and the mean trend of the distribution of dispersal distances. “Nonstandard” mechanisms such as extreme climatic events and generalized LDD vectors seem to hold the greatest explanatory power for the drastic deviations from the mean trend, deviations that make the nearly impossible LDD a reality."

Karyopherinβ proteins (Kapßs; also known as Importins and Exportins) are responsible for the majority of nucleocytoplasmic transport in the cell. At least 20 members of the Kapβ family have been identified in humans. Kapßs bind specific sets of transport substrates and target them to the nuclear pore complex. The Ran GTPase regulates Kapβ-substrate interactions and transport directionality through its nucleotide cycle (Chook and Blobel, 2001Chook Y.M. Blobel G. Karyopherins and nuclear import.Curr Opin Struct Biol. 2001; 11: 703-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, Conti and Izaurralde, 2001Conti E. Izaurralde E.

Regulating access to the genome: nucleocytoplasmic transport throughout the cell cycle.Cell. 2003; 112: 441-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). RanGTP is concentrated in the nucleus, while RanGDP is concentrated in the cytoplasm. In import pathways, RanGTP and substrates bind Kapßs competitively, allowing substrate binding in the cytoplasm and RanGTP-mediated release in the nucleus. In contrast, in export pathways, RanGTP, substrates, and Kapßs bind cooperatively, resulting in substrate binding in the nucleus and release in the cytoplasm as the Ran bound nucleotide is hydrolyzed. In humans, ten import Kapßs have been shown to carry a diverse set of macromolecular substrates into the nucleus (Mosammaparast and Pemberton, 2004Mosammaparast N. Pemberton L.F. Karyopherins: from nuclear-transport mediators to nuclear-function regulators.Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 547-556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Despite significant efforts, only a few substrates have been identified for most import Kapßs, and large panels of substrates have been identified for only two pathways: those of Kapβ1 and Kapβ2 (see below). Each import Kapβ appears to bind distinct sets of substrates, suggesting that each Kapβ recognizes a different nuclear localization signal(s) (NLS[s]). However, large sequence diversity among various substrates has prevented identification of NLSs for most Kapßs, and it remains extremely difficult to predict NLSs in candidate import substrates. The classical NLSs are short, lysine-rich sequences that bind the adaptor protein Kapα, which forms a heterodimer with Kapβ1, which in turn mediates nuclear import (Conti and Izaurralde, 2001Conti E. Izaurralde E. Nucleocytoplasmic transport enters the atomic age.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 310-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Most other proteins imported into the nucleus do not utilize such an adaptor but rather bind directly to a Kapβ. The few characterized NLSs that bind directly to Kapßs are diverse, encompassing both structural domains and linear epitopes. For example, crystal structures of three Kapβ1-substrate complexes show structurally diverse substrates binding at different sites on the karyopherin (Cingolani et al., 1999Cingolani G. Petosa C.

Furthermore, most proteins that bind Kapβ1 show little sequence or structural homology, and thus general features among substrates in this pathway cannot be inferred at this time. In another import pathway, more than 20 mRNA processing proteins (including hnRNPs A1, D, F, M, HuR, DDX3, Y-box binding protein 1, and TAP) have been identified as import substrates of Kapβ2 (Bonifaci et al., 1997Bonifaci N.

Two separate regions essential for nuclear import of the hnRNP D nucleocytoplasmic shuttling sequence.FEBS J. 2005; 272: 3975-3987Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar), have been characterized. The NLSs of hnRNP D and HuR show marginal sequence homology to M9NLS, that of TAP shares no sequence homology with M9NLS, and none of the other Kapβ2 substrates contain obvious M9NLS-like sequences. Like the Kapβ1 system, the diversity of substrates and known NLSs in Kapβ2 has also prevented prediction of NLSs in this pathway. In the nucleus, RanGTP binds import Kapßs with high affinity and dissociates substrates (Chook et al., 2002Chook Y.M. Jung A. Rosen M.K. Blobel G.

The unique repertoire of substrates for individual Kapßs suggests significant differences in their mechanisms of substrate recognition and therefore also differences in their regulation by Ran. The latter is illustrated in two different models for Ran-mediated substrate dissociation in the Kapβ1 and Kapβ2 pathways. For structurally diverse Kapβ1 substrates that also bind at different sites on the karyopherin, Ran-mediated dissociation involves both a global conformational change that locks the Kapβ1 superhelix into a substrate-incompatible conformation and a direct displacement by Ran (Cingolani et al., 1999Cingolani G.

Alternatively, structural and biochemical analyses of the Kapβ2-RanGTP complex suggest that RanGTP and substrate binding sites do not overlap and that an internal loop of Kapβ2 is crucial for substrate dissociation in the presence of Ran (Chook and Blobel, 1999Chook Y. Blobel G. Structure of the nuclear transport complex karyopherin-beta2-Ran.GppNHp.Nature. 1999; 399: 230-237Crossref Scopus (284) Google Scholar, Chook et al., 2002Chook Y.M. Jung A. Rosen M.K. Blobel G. Uncoupling Kapβ2 substrate dissociation and Ran binding.Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6955-6966Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Thus it appears that the two best-known nuclear import pathways may utilize Ran to dissociate substrates in different manners. In order to understand the mechanism of substrate recognition and distill the critical elements for NLS recognition by Kapβ2, and to understand the mechanism of Ran-mediated substrate dissociation for this import pathway, we have determined the structure of Kapβ2 bound to the M9NLS of hnRNP A1. The structure and complementary biochemical studies reveal a set of rules for NLS recognition by Kapβ2: NLSs imported by Kapβ2 should occur within large (>30-residue) structurally disordered elements, have overall basic character, and contain a set of consensus sequences. These rules are predictive and have allowed us to identify and biochemically confirm NLSs in seven known Kapβ2 substrates. Most importantly, we used these NLS rules in a bioinformatics approach and identified 81 new candidate import substrates for Kapβ2. We have confirmed that five of these bind Kapβ2 through the predicted NLS in a Ran-dependent manner. Finally, comparison with the previously determined structure of the Kapβ2-Ran complex (Chook and Blobel, 1999Chook Y. Blobel G. Structure of the nuclear transport complex karyopherin-beta2-Ran.GppNHp.Nature. 1999; 399: 230-237Crossref Scopus (284) Google Scholar) has revealed the mechanism of Ran-mediated substrate dissociation. M9NLS binds in the C-terminal arch of Kapβ2, in a site spatially distinct from the Ran binding site. However, in the Ran complex, the acidic loop of Kapβ2 occupies this substrate binding site. Thus, Ran binding induces structural changes in Kapβ2 that are incompatible with substrate binding. Kapβ2 is a superhelical protein with 20 HEAT repeats. It is almost exclusively α helical except for a 62 residue loop in repeat 8 (H8 loop, Figure 1A). Each repeat consists of two antiparallel helices, A and B, each lining the convex and concave sides of the superhelix, respectively (Chook and Blobel, 1999Chook Y. Blobel G. Structure of the nuclear transport complex karyopherin-beta2-Ran.GppNHp.Nature. 1999; 399: 230-237Crossref Scopus (284) Google Scholar, Chook et al., 2002Chook Y.M. Jung A. Rosen M.K. Blobel G. Uncoupling Kapβ2 substrate dissociation and Ran binding.Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6955-6966Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Details of HEAT repeat nomenclature are described in the Supplemental Data. The Kapβ2-M9NLS crystals contain a Kapβ2 mutant with a truncated H8 loop bound to residues 257–305 of hnRNP A1 (Figure 1B). Biochemical studies showed that the loop neither hinders nor is necessary for substrate binding. However, it is sensitive to proteolytic degradation in substrate bound Kapβ2, suggesting structural flexibility (Chook et al., 2002Chook Y.M. Jung A. Rosen M.K. Blobel G. Uncoupling Kapβ2 substrate dissociation and Ran binding.Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6955-6966Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In the final Kapβ2 construct, the H8 loop was truncated (a GGSGGSG linker replaces residues 337–367) to minimize disorder in the crystal. The Kapβ2-M9NLS crystal structure was solved to 3.05 Å resolution (Table S1, PDB ID code 2H4M). The asymmetric unit of the crystal contains two Kapβ2-M9NLS complexes (I and II). All residues in both Kapβ2s are modeled except for three short loops at the N termini, H8 loop residues 320–337, and the engineered GGSGGSG H8 loop linker (disordered regions are indicated by dashes in Figures 1A, S1A, and S1B). Substrate residues 267–289 are observed in complex I, while additional substrate residues 263–266 are modeled in complex II (Figure 1C). Thus, the latter is used in structural analysis and discussion below. HEAT repeats 5–20 share similar conformations in both complexes (rmsd 1.7 Å). In contrast, HEAT repeats 1–4 diverge to a distance of 7 Å at their N termini with high average B factors (93 Å2 for complex I and 118 Å2 for complex II), suggesting inherent conformational flexibility in this region of Kapβ2. The 20 HEAT repeats of the Kapβ2-M9NLS complex form an almost perfect superhelix (pitch ∼72 Å, diameter ∼60 Å, and length ∼111 Å; Figure 1A). The superhelix can also be described as two overlapping arches, with the N-terminal arch spanning HEAT repeats 1–13 and the C-terminal arch spanning repeats 8–20. In the Kapβ2-Ran complex, RanGTP binds in the N-terminal arch (Chook and Blobel, 1999Chook Y. Blobel G. Structure of the nuclear transport complex karyopherin-beta2-Ran.GppNHp.Nature. 1999; 399: 230-237Crossref Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Here, we observe that M9NLS binds in the C-terminal arch (Figures 1A and 1C). M9NLS binds in extended conformation to line the concave surface of the C-terminal arch of Kapβ2 (Figure 1A). Its peptide direction is antiparallel to that of the karyopherin superhelix, and substrate buries 3432 Å2 of surface area in both binding partners. Tracing M9NLS from N to C terminus, residues 263–266 interact with helices H18A, H19A, and H20B of Kapβ2, while residues 267–269 drape over the intra-HEAT 18 loop into the C-terminal arch of the karyopherin. The rest of M9NLS follows the curvature of the C-terminal arch to contact B helices of repeats 8–17 (Figures 1A and 2A). The substrate interface on Kapβ2 comprises ∼30% of the concave surface of the C-terminal arch, which is relatively flat and devoid of deep pockets or grooves. Most of this surface, which includes the M9NLS interface, is also highly acidic (Figure 2B). M9NLS forms an extensive network of polar and hydrophobic interactions with Kapβ2, involving both the main chain and side chains of the substrate (Figure 2A). Most of the substrate interface on Kapβ2 is acidic with the exception of several scattered hydrophobic patches. At the N terminus of M9NLS, residues 263–266 contact a hydrophobic patch on Kapβ2 helices H19A and H20B (Figure 2B, left). In the central region, a hydrophobic stretch 273FGPM276 contacts hydrophobic Kapβ2 residues I773 and W730 (Figures 2B and 2C). Further toward the C terminus, F281 binds near a hydrophobic patch formed by Kapβ2 residues F584 and V643 (Figure 2B, center), and finally, the C-terminal 288PY289 residues bind a large hydrophobic swath that includes Kapβ2 residues A380, A381, L419, I457, and W460 (Figures 2B, right and 2D). Despite the extensive acidic interface on Kapβ2, there are only two basic residues in M9NLS. R284 forms salt links with Kapβ2 residues E509 and D543, and the side chain of K277 is not observed. In order to understand the distribution of binding energy along M9NLS, we measured dissociation constants (KDs) of a series of M9NLS mutants binding to Kapβ2 using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). The results of the binding studies using MBP-fusion proteins of M9NLS residues 257–305 and wild-type Kapβ2 are summarized in Table 1 and Figure S2. Wild-type M9NLS binds Kapβ2 with a KD of 42 nM. This ITC-measured affinity is somewhat lower than the previous KD of 2 nM measured by fluorescence titration but may be explained by the presence of both a covalently attached aromatic fluorophore and a significantly longer M9NLS spanning residues 238–320 in the earlier studies (Chook et al., 2002Chook Y.M. Jung A. Rosen M.K. Blobel G. Uncoupling Kapβ2 substrate dissociation and Ran binding.Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6955-6966Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Substrate residues that make two or more side-chain contacts with Kapβ2 (F273, F281, R284, P288, and Y289) were systematically mutated to alanines. Additional residues G274, P275, and M276 were also mutated given their implied importance in yeast-two-hybrid studies (Bogerd et al., 1999Bogerd H.P. Benson R.E. Truant R. Herold A. Phingbodhipakkiya M. Cullen B.R. Definition of a consensus transportin-specific nucleocytoplasmic transport signal.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9771-9777Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). G274A is the only single mutant that shows significant (18-fold) decrease in Kapβ2 binding (Table 1). Single mutants of C-terminal residues P288 and Y289 follow with modest decreases of 3- to 4-fold. Thus, it appears that M9NLS binds Kapβ2 in a mostly distributive fashion, with a strict requirement for glycine at position 274 and modest though possibly important energetic contributions from C-terminal residues P288 and Y289. The importance of the PY motif is suggested in the R284/P288/Y289 and G274/P288/Y289 triple mutants, where 10-fold and 140-fold decreases were observed, respectively. Both triple mutants show nonadditivity in their binding energies when compared with single G274A and R284A and the double PY mutants, suggesting cooperativity between the C-terminal PY motif and both upstream binding sites at R284 and G274. The significance of the G274A mutation had previously been reported in both Kapβ2 binding and nuclear import assays (Fridell et al., 1997Fridell R.A. Truant R. Thorne L. Benson R.E. Cullen B.R.

The α carbon of G274 is in close proximity to neighboring substrate side chains F273 and P275 as well as Kapβ2 residue W730, such that a side chain in position 274 may result in a steric clash (Figure 2C).Table 1Kapβ2 Binding to M9NLS Mutants: Dissociation Constants by Isothermal CalorimetryMBP-M9NLS(257-305) proteinsKDWild type42 ± 2 nMF273A61 ± 10 nMG274A746 ± 63 nMP275A74 ± 5 nMM276A83 ± 17 nMF281A56 ± 11 nMR284A92 ± 9 nMP288A158 ± 20 nMY289A133 ± 21 nMP288A/Y289A136 ± 8 nMR284A/P288A/Y289A461 ± 27 nMG274A/P288A/Y289A5.9 ± 0.7 μM Open table in a new tab The important energetic contributions of the substrate's C-terminal PY motif and its central G274 residue are also supported by mutations of interacting residues in Kapβ2. Double and triple Kapβ2 mutants, W460A/W730A and I457A/W460A/W730A, both show significant decreases in Kapβ2 binding (Figure S1C). I457 and W460 interact with the substrate PY motif, while W730 makes a hydrophobic contact with substrate P275 and is also close to G274 (Figures 2C and 2D). Prior to this study, among more than 20 known Kapβ2 substrates, only NLSs from hnRNP A1, D, HuR, TAP, and their homologs had been identified (Fan and Steitz, 1998Fan X.C. Steitz J.A.

Chem. 1999; 274: 32167-32171Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). All four NLSs span 30–40 residues, are rich in glycine and serine residues, and have overall basic character but share little sequence homology. To aid in assessment of the rules for NLS recognition by Kapβ2 suggested below, we constructed a series of deletion mutants to map three additional NLSs from hnRNP F, M, and PQBP-1. The results of in vitro binding assays map the NLSs to residues 151–190 in PQBP-1, residues 41–70 in hnRNP M, and residues 190–245 in hnRNP F (Figures S3A–S3C). Structural and mutagenesis analysis of the Kapβ2-M9NLS complex combined with sequence comparison and analysis of all seven NLSs reveals three rules for NLS recognition by Kapβ2. The extended conformation of the 26 residue M9NLS results in a linear epitope that traces a path of ∼110 Å. The structure of the bound substrate suggests that an NLS recognized by Kapβ2 should exist within a stretch of at least 30 residues that lacks secondary structure in its native, unbound state. Thus, the NLS is most likely structurally disordered in the free substrate. The prediction of this NLS requirement is further supported by the fact that all seven known NLSs in Kapβ2 substrates occur within sequences with high probability of structural disorder (>0.7) calculated by the program DisEMBL (Linding et al., 2003Linding R. Jensen L.J. Diella F. Bork P. Gibson T.J. Russell R.B. Protein disorder prediction: implications for structural proteomics.Structure. 2003; 11: 1453-1459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). All seven NLSs are found either in loop regions between the RNA binding or other folded domains or at the termini of the substrates. A second requirement for an NLS recognized by Kapβ2 emerges from the observation that Kapβ2's substrate interface is highly negatively charged. An acidic peptide would likely not bind due to electrostatic repulsion, while an NLS with overall positive charge would most likely be favored. Examination of all known Kapβ2 NLSs indicates overall basic character spanning at least 30 residues in six of seven cases (Figure 3A). In addition, regions that flank the NLSs most likely also contribute favorably to electrostatics. For example, although the TAP-NLS sequence delineated in Figure 3A has slightly more acidic than basic residues, flanking regions are highly basic and may ultimately contribute to overall basic character to promote Kapβ2 binding. The importance of basic flanking regions is also observed in hnRNP A1. Here, the entire 135 residue C-terminal tail of the substrate has overall positive charge. A recent study showed that following osmotic shock stress in cells, four serine residues C-terminally adjacent to the M9NLS are phosphorylated, resulting in decreased binding to Kapβ2 and accumulation of hnRNP A1 in the cytoplasm (Allemand et al., 2005Allemand E. Guil S. Myers M. Moscat J. Caceres J.F. Krainer A.R. Regulation of heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 transport by phosphorylation in cells stressed by osmotic shock.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 3605-3610Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the M9NLS-flanking serines may decrease the basic character of M9NLS and thus modulate interactions with Kapβ2. All seven characterized NLSs recognized by Kapβ2 exist in structurally disordered regions, suggesting that this class of NLS is represented by linear epitopes and not folded domains. However, apparent sequence diversity among previously characterized NLSs from hnRNP A1, HuR, TAP, and JKTBP homologs had prevented delineation of a consensus sequence that could be used to identify new NLSs or substrates. However, despite apparent NLS diversity, mutagenesis, structural, and sequence analyses have resulted in the identification of two regions of conservation within the sequences. The first region of conservation is found at the C terminus of the NLSs. Mutagenesis of M9NLS suggested the importance of its C-terminal PY motif (Table 1).

To cluster compounds with a similar mode-of-action and to reveal insights into the cellular pathways and proteins affected, we applied both a hierarchical clustering and a factorgram method, which allows a gene or compound to be associated with more than one group. In particular, tamoxifen, a breast cancer therapeutic, was found to disrupt calcium homeostasis and phosphatidylserine (PS) was recognized as a target for papuamide B, a cytotoxic lipopeptide with anti-HIV activity. Further, the profile of crude extracts resembled that of its constituent purified natural product, enabling detailed classification of extract activity prior to purification.

We identified an ER membrane-associated ubiquitin ligase complex containing the E3 RMA1, the E2 Ubc6e, and Derlin-1 that cooperates with the cytosolic Hsc70/CHIP E3 complex to triage CFTR and CFTRΔF508. Derlin-1 serves to retain CFTR in the ER membrane and interacts with RMA1 and Ubc6e to promote CFTR's proteasomal degradation.

CFTR is a Cl− ion channel that is localized to the apical surface of epithelial cells that line ducts and lung airways (Riordan et al., 1989Riordan J.R. Rommens J.M. Kerem B. Alon N. Rozmahel R.

Around 90% of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients inherit at least one copy of the CFTRΔF508 allele, which is missing F508 from nucleotide binding domain (NBD) I. CFTRΔF508 is synthesized and properly inserted into the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), but it fails to reach the native state and accumulates in a kinetically trapped, but foldable, conformation (Cyr, 2005Cyr D.M.

The network of quality-control (QC) factors that triages nascent CFTR and other ER proteins is not well defined, but is generally known as the ER-associated degradation pathway (ERAD) (McCracken and Brodsky, 1996McCracken A.A. Brodsky J.L. Assembly of ER-associated protein degradation in vitro: dependence on cytosol, calnexin, and ATP.J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Loss of CFTR function at the cell surface is the cause for mortality in CF patients because it alters the hydration of the mucosal layer that lines airway epithelia and gives rise to persistent microbial infections with resultant lung fibrosis and failure (Rowe et al., 2005Rowe S.M. Miller S. Sorscher E.J. Cystic fibrosis.N. Engl. J. Med. 2005; 352: 1992-2001Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Folding defects exhibited by CFTRΔF508 are conditional, and treatment of cells with chemical or pharmacological chaperones promotes its proper folding and channel function at the plasma membrane (Brown et al., 1996Brown C.R.

Corrected CFTRΔF508 has a markedly shorter half-life at the cell surface than CFTR (Sharma et al., 2004Sharma M. Pampinella F. Nemes C. Benharouga M. So J. Du K. Bache K.G. Papsin B. Zerangue N.

Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 923-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), yet patients that express low levels of functional CFTR display a mild disease phenotype (Welsh and Ostedgaard, 1998Welsh M.J. Ostedgaard L.S. Cystic fibrosis problem probed by proteolysis.Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 167-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Therefore, agents that promote CFTRΔF508 folding or block the degradation of folded CFTRΔF508 have potential as CF therapeutics (Pedemonte et al., 2005Pedemonte N. Lukacs G.L. Du K. Caci E.

Guidance for the development of CF therapeutics requires a basic understanding of the mechanisms for CFTRΔF508 misfolding and the identification of the ERQC machinery that selects CFTRΔF508 for ERAD. CFTR folding is complex because it is a 1480 residue glycomembrane protein, and its two membrane-spanning domains (MSDs), two cytoplasmic NBDs, and a regulatory domain (R domain) must interact with each other to form a Cl− ion channel (Ostedgaard et al., 1997Ostedgaard L.S.

Invest. 1997; 100: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In most cell types tested, the biosynthesis of CFTR takes ∼10 min, and the assembly of CFTR and CFTRΔF508 into a channel is inefficient, with ∼60%–75% of CFTR and nearly 99% of newly synthesized CFTRΔF508 being degraded (Ward and Kopito, 1994Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. Intracellular turnover of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator. Inefficient processing and rapid degradation of wild-type and mutant proteins.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25710-25718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The folding efficiency of CFTR can vary in different cell types (Varga et al., 2004Varga K. Jurkuvenaite A. Wakefield J. Hong J.S. Guimbellot J.S. Venglarik C.J. Niraj A. Mazur M. Sorscher E.J. Collawn J.F. Bebok Z. Efficient intracellular processing of the endogenous cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in epithelial cell lines.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22578-22584Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), but it is clear that CFTRΔF508 does not reach the native state and is degraded prematurely in human airway cells (Kreda et al., 2005Kreda S.M. Mall M. Mengos A. Rochelle L. Yankaskas J. Riordan J.R. Boucher R.C. Characterization of wild-type and deltaF508 cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator in human respiratory epithelia.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2154-2167Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). CFTR and CFTRΔF508 appear to assume similar conformations at early stages of assembly (Zhang et al., 1998Zhang F. Kartner N. Lukacs G.L. Limited proteolysis as a probe for arrested conformational maturation of delta F508 CFTR.Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 180-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), but CFTRΔF508 folding becomes arrested at a poorly defined step. Since F508 is located in a surface-exposed loop on NBD1 that makes contacts with MSD1 in bacterial ABC transporters, the loss of the F508 side chain may prevent proper contact formation between NBD1 and MSD1 and lead to misassembly of multiple regions in CFTR (Chang and Roth, 2001Chang G. Roth C.B. Structure of MsbA from E. coli: a homolog of the multidrug resistance ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters.Science. 2001; 293: 1793-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). In addition, loss of F508 from the NBD1 backbone causes purified NBD1 to exhibit a temperature-sensitive folding defect (Thibodeau et al., 2005Thibodeau P.H. Brautigam C.A. Machius M. Thomas P.J. Side chain and backbone contributions of Phe508 to CFTR folding.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 10-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Thus, misfolding and misassembly of ΔF508 NBDI appear to cause CFTRΔF508 to be targeted for degradation, but how ERQC detects such folding defects is not clear. Defects in the folding pathway of CFTRΔF508 described above suggest that it accumulates in a conformation that exposes nonnative surfaces in the cytosol as well as in the ER membrane. Cytosolic Hsc70 interacts with ER membrane localized Hdj2, the U-box protein CHIP, and the E2 UbcH5 to form a multisubunit E3 complex that ubiquitinates cytosolic regions of CFTRΔF508 (Meacham et al., 1999Meacham G.C.

Yet, upon inactivation of the Hsc70/CHIP E3 complex, CFTRΔF508 is still unable to escape the ER membrane and is degraded (Younger et al., 2004Younger J.M. Ren H.Y. Chen L. Fan C.Y. Fields A. Patterson C. Cyr D.M. A foldable CFTR{Delta}F508 biogenic intermediate accumulates upon inhibition of the Hsc70-CHIP E3 ubiquitin ligase.J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 1075-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that additional E2/E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes, which might monitor the folded state of CFTR's transmembrane domains, function in conjunction with the cytosolic Hsc70/CHIP E3 complex to triage CFTR and CFTRΔF508. Studies in mammalian cells are yet to identify an ER-localized E3 ubiquitin ligase that functions in ERAD of CFTR. Nonetheless, there is evidence to suggest that a tail-anchored and ER-localized E2 ubiquitin-conjugating (Ubc) enzyme, Ubc6e, facilitates CFTR degradation (Lenk et al., 2002Lenk U. Yu H. Walter J. Gelman M.S. Hartmann E. Kopito R.R. Sommer T. A role for mammalian Ubc6 homologues in ER-associated protein degradation.J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3007-3014Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ubc6e does not appear to interact with the E3 CHIP to ubiquitinate CFTR (Younger et al., 2004Younger J.M. Ren H.Y. Chen L. Fan C.Y. Fields A. Patterson C. Cyr D.M. A foldable CFTR{Delta}F508 biogenic intermediate accumulates upon inhibition of the Hsc70-CHIP E3 ubiquitin ligase.J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 1075-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Therefore, we sought to identify the cognate E3 ubiquitin ligase that functions with Ubc6e and then define the role that this E2/E3 complex plays in QC of CFTR. We identified the tail-anchored RING domain protein RMA1/RNF5 (Didier et al., 2003Didier C. Broday L. Bhoumik A. Israeli S. Takahashi S. Nakayama K. Thomas S.M. Turner C.E. Henderson S. Sabe H.

Rma1, a novel type of RING finger protein conserved from Arabidopsis to human, is a membrane-bound ubiquitin ligase.J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1949-1957Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as a component of an ER-associated E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that contains Ubc6e and the transmembrane quality-control factor Derlin-1 (Lilley and Ploegh, 2004Lilley B.N. Ploegh H.L. A membrane protein required for dislocation of misfolded proteins from the ER.Nature. 2004; 429: 834-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar, Ye et al., 2004Ye Y. Shibata Y. Yun C. Ron D. Rapoport T.A. A membrane protein complex mediates retro-translocation from the ER lumen into the cytosol.Nature. 2004; 429: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). The RMA1 E3 complex appears to sense the assembly status of CFTR's amino-terminal regions at a folding step that occurs prior to NBDII synthesis and is defective in CFTRΔF508. The CHIP E3 appears to act after NBDII synthesis and detects folding defects that involve terminal steps in CFTR assembly. To identify new QC checkpoints that function to triage CFTR and CFTRΔF508, we sought to identify factors that function in ERQC with Ubc6e. We chose to investigate whether the human homolog of Arabidopsis RMA1 (Didier et al., 2003Didier C. Broday L. Bhoumik A. Israeli S. Takahashi S. Nakayama K. Thomas S.M. Turner C.E. Henderson S. Sabe H. Ronai Z. RNF5, a RING finger protein that regulates cell motility by targeting paxillin ubiquitination and altered localization.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5331-5345Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, Matsuda et al., 2001Matsuda N. Suzuki T. Tanaka K. Nakano A. Rma1, a novel type of RING finger protein conserved from Arabidopsis to human, is a membrane-bound ubiquitin ligase.J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1949-1957Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) interacts with Ubc6e to target CFTR and CFTRΔF508 for proteasomal degradation. RMA1 is a 180 amino acid residue tail-anchored ER membrane protein that contains a cytoplasmic RING domain (Figure 1A). RMA1 colocalizes with GFP-CFTRΔF508 in the ER membrane (Figure 1B) and cofractionates with the ER marker calnexin (Figure 1C). In addition, the B form of CFTRΔF508 (Figure 1D) and CFTR (data not shown) coimmunoprecipitate in a complex that contains myc-RMA1. When the RING domain mutant myc-RMA1 C42S was substituted for myc-RMA1 in transfections, several-fold more CFTRΔF508 coprecipitated with the RMA1 mutant. Thus, RMA1 is an ER-localized E3 protein that enters into complexes with CFTRΔF508 (Figure 1D). To determine whether RMA1 can divert CFTR from its folding pathway and target it for degradation, the effect that RMA1 overexpression had on the accumulation of the immaturely glycosylated, nonnative B and maturely glycosylated, folded C form of CFTR was determined (Figure 2A). A 2-fold increase in RMA1 levels dramatically reduced the steady-state level of the C form of CFTR, and this action was not accompanied by the accumulation of the B form (Figure 2A). Treatment of cells with the proteasome inhibitor ALLN prevented RMA1 from reducing CFTRΔF508 levels and caused a large quantity of CFTRΔF508, which would normally have been degraded, to accumulate as an ubiquitin conjugate (Figure 2B). Pulse-chase analysis showed that elevation of RMA1 caused a 60% reduction in the accumulation of 35S-CFTR and 35S-CFTRΔF508 during the 20 min pulse-labeling period (Figure 2C). Then, in the chase period, RMA1 blocked the glycolytic maturation of CFTR and accelerated degradation of the CFTRΔF508 B form around 2-fold. The ability of RMA1 to divert the B form of CFTR and CFTRΔF508 from its folding pathway was lost when RMA1 C42S or RMA1ΔTM was substituted for RMA1 in cotransfections (Figure 2D). When RMA1 and Ubc6e levels were reduced by treatment of cells with siRNA oligonucleotides, CFTRΔF508 levels increased nearly 4-fold, and this effect correlated with reduced expression of RMA1 and Ubc6e (Figure 2E). Thus, RMA1 is an ER-localized RING E3 that can be isolated in coprecipitates with the B form of CFTR, and the modulation of its activity influences the fate of nascent CFTR and CFTRΔF508. Data generated thus far indicate that RMA1 is a component of an ERQC complex that degrades CFTR and CFTRΔF508 equally well. However, it remained possible that the deletion of ΔF508 causes more nascent CFTRΔF508 than CFTR to accumulate in a conformation that is recognized by RMA1 and/or its interacting partners. To explore this possibility, we compared the sensitivity of CFTR and CFTRΔF508 to elevation of RMA1 again, but reduced the level of RMA1 by utilizing 0.5 μg of RMA1 expression plasmid instead of 1.0 μg (Figure 3A). Under these conditions, RMA1 overexpression only reduced CFTR levels by ∼30%, but CFTRΔF508 accumulation was reduced by ∼90%. Thus, triage of CFTRΔF508 is more sensitive to elevation of RMA1 activity than CFTR. Yet, since RMA1 promotes the degradation of both CFTR and CFTRΔF508, it is not likely that the RMA1 E3 can sense a true difference in the conformation of these proteins. Instead, it is likely that the folding of a larger portion of nascent CFTRΔF508 than nascent CFTR arrests at a stage where its nonnative conformation can be recognized by components of the RMA1 E3 complex. To evaluate the range of proteins that are selected for ERAD by RMA1, the sensitivities of CFTRΔF508, TCRα, and ApolipoB48 to RMA1 overexpression were compared (Figure 3B–C). The steady-state level of the B form of CFTRΔF508 was reduced by ∼85% when cells were transfected with 1 μg of pcDNA-RMA1. Under these same conditions, the accumulation of TCRα and ApoB48 was largely unaffected. Yet, when cells were transfected with 3 μg of pcDNA-RMA1, a decrease in the steady-state levels of TCRα and ApoB48 was observed (Figure 3A). Decreased steady-state levels of TCRα and ApoB48 resultant from RMA1 overexpression correlated with a 2-fold increase in the degradation rates of these proteins (Figures 3C and 3D). The observed differences in the sensitivities of CFTRΔF508, TCRα, and ApoB48 to alterations in RMA1 levels indicates that RMA1 overexpression does not cause the pleiotropic degradation of ERAD substrates. However, it is difficult to judge the relative concentrations of these respective ERAD substrates in the cell, so it is premature to conclude that the RMA1 E3 can selectively recognize different classes of ERAD substrates. To determine whether RMA1 and Ubc6e functionally interact, we analyzed whether they could act jointly to enhance CFTRΔF508 degradation (Figure 4). Individual levels of Ubc6e and RMA1 were adjusted to reduce CFTRΔF508 accumulation by 50%–60%. When RMA1 and Ubc6e were coexpressed at this same level, there was a dramatic reduction in CFTRΔF508 accumulation (Figures 4A and 4C). The RING domain mutant RMA1 C42S and the Ubc domain mutant Ubc6e C91S were unable to substitute for their wild-type counterparts and reduce the steady-state level of CFTRΔF508. Thus, RMA1 and Ubc6e appear to cooperate in a RING domain- and Ubc domain-dependent manner to degrade CFTR. The purified RING domain of RMA1 can interact with Ubc5 to promote polyubiquitin chain assembly (Matsuda et al., 2001Matsuda N. Suzuki T. Tanaka K. Nakano A. Rma1, a novel type of RING finger protein conserved from Arabidopsis to human, is a membrane-bound ubiquitin ligase.J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1949-1957Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we determined whether or not RMA1 could cooperate with UbcH5a to modulate CFTRΔF508 levels in cultured cells (Figure 4B). The combined overexpression of RMA1 and UbcH5a did not result in a synergistic reduction in the steady-state levels of CFTRΔF508 (Figures 4B and 4D). In addition, pulse-chase analysis revealed that the combined expression of RMA1 and UbcH5a did not reduce the accumulation of CFTR beyond that observed when only RMA1 activity was elevated (Figure 4E). In contrast, the coexpression of RMA1 and Ubc6e synergistically reduced the quantity of 35S-labeled CFTRΔF508 that accumulated during a 20 min labeling period (Figure 4F). When similar experiments were conducted with CFTR, nearly identical results were observed (data not shown). These collective data support the conclusion that RMA1 and Ubc6e form a specific E2/E3 pair that selects nascent CFTR and CFTRΔF508 for degradation. The pulse-chase analysis of CFTR and CFTRΔF508 biogenesis (Figures 2 and 4E) shows that significantly less of the B form of these proteins accumulates when RMA1 activity is increased. Therefore, it is possible that RMA1 and Ubc6e recognize folding defects in CFTRΔF508 during or soon after translation. Alternatively, the coexpression of RMA1 and Ubc6e with CFTRΔF508 might simply reduce its expression level. To address these questions, we examined the effect of RMA1 and Ubc6e on CFTRΔF508 biosynthesis in the absence and presence of the proteasome inhibitor ALLN (Figure 4F). 35S-CFTRΔF508 accumulated with time over the course of a 20 min labeling period, and ALLN was observed to increase the accumulation of CFTRΔF508 around 2-fold at every time point. Yet, in cells where RMA1 or RMA1 and Ubc6e were overexpressed, the accumulation of CFTRΔF508 was reduced at all time points. However, the coexpression of RMA1 and Ubc6e did not hinder synthesis of CFTRΔF508, because treatment of cells with ALLN restored the labeling of CFTRΔF508 to a level that was greater than that observed in the control. Thus, a large portion of CFTRΔF508 appears to be degraded cotranslationally, and the RMA1/Ubc6e E3 complex appears capable of mediating this process. Our interpretations of the data presented in Figure 4 are consistent with the finding that CFTR can be ubiquitinated cotranslationally (Sato et al., 1998Sato S. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. Cotranslational ubiquitination of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in vitro.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7189-7192Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Yet, whether RMA1 and Ubc6e truly act cotranslationally and ubiquitinate CFTR and CFTRΔF508 while it is attached to the ribosome requires further study. RING domain E3 ubiquitin ligases such as RMA1 are typically members of multisubunit complexes in which they serve as scaffolds that link the ubiquitin-conjugating activity of an E2 to the substrate-binding activity of a specific effecter molecule (Hershko and Ciechanover, 1998Hershko A. Ciechanover A. The ubiquitin system.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6471) Google Scholar). Thus, it is plausible that RMA1 promotes CFTR degradation by functioning in a complex that contains a membrane-inserted substrate selector that senses the folded state of CFTR (Figure 5). The ERQC factor Derlin-1 contains four transmembrane-spanning domains and is known to form complexes with different transmembrane E3s and a number of other ERQC factors and appears to have multiple functions in ERAD (Katiyar et al., 2005Katiyar S. Joshi S. Lennarz W.J. The retrotranslocation protein Derlin-1 binds peptide:N-glycanase to the endoplasmic reticulum.Mol. Biol.

USA. 2005; 102: 14132-14138Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether Derlin-1 might be involved in the selection of CFTR for degradation by modulating Derlin-1 activity and determining the effect this had on CFTR biogenesis. Elevation of Derlin-1 levels by ∼3-fold led to the retention of the B form of CFTR in the ER (Figures 5A and 5B). HA-Derlin-1 formed coimmunoprecipitable complexes with the newly synthesized B form of CFTR (Figure 5C). Derlin-1 was also found to remain associated with the pool of B form that was retained in the ER when its activity was elevated to the point where it blocked CFTR folding by ∼50% (Figure 5C). Under these same experimental conditions, complex formation between HA-Derlin-1 and the C form of CFTR was not observed. In addition, HA-Derlin-1 was also demonstrated to enter into coimmunoprecipitable complexes with CFTR370X, which represents MSDI of CFTR (Figure 5D). Eight percent of the total immunoprecipitable CFTRΔF508 and 12% of the total immunoprecipitable CFTR370X present in cells was coprecipitated with HA-Derlin-1 (see the legend to Figure 5). The level of complex formation detected between Derlin-1 and either CFTR or CFTR370X is similar to the quantity of CFTR that coprecipitated with Hsc70 (Meacham et al., 1999Meacham G.C. Lu Z. King S. Sorscher E. Tousson A. Cyr D.M. The Hdj-2/Hsc70 chaperone pair facilitates early steps in CFTR biogenesis.EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1492-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). It should also be noted that the level of CFTR:Derlin-1 complexes detected is likely to represent an underestimation of the total level of complex formation that occurs in the cell because Derlin-1:substrate complexes are expected to dissociate upon dilution during isolation protocols. The retrotranslocation factor p97 is known to be present in complexes that contain Derlin-1 and E3 ubiquitin ligases (Ye et al., 2005Ye Y. Shibata Y. Kikkert M. van Voorden S. Wiertz E. Rapoport T.A. Inaugural article: Recruitment of the p97 ATPase and ubiquitin ligases to the site of retrotranslocation at the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

USA. 2005; 102: 14296-14301Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), and we observed it to coprecipitate with Derlin-1 and CFTR370X (Figure 5D). The presence of p97 in a complex with Derlin-1 and a CFTR biogenic intermediate implies that the retention of CFTR in the ER is coupled to its ubiquitination by RMA1 and Ubc6e and retrotranslocation. If Derlin-1 plays an active role in the retention of nonnative CFTR in the ER, then the reduction of its cellular activity should allow more CFTR to escape the ER and accumulate in its C form. Indeed, the treatment of cells with Derlin-1 siRNAs enabled ∼2-fold more of the folded C form of CFTR and the nonnative B form of CFTRΔF508 to accumulate (Figure 5E)."

How and when a lineage becomes specified remains unknown. Here, we report the existence of a population of unipotent progenitor cells that reside in the SG and express the transcriptional repressor Blimp1. Using cell-culture studies and genetic lineage tracing, we demonstrate that Blimp1-expressing cells are upstream from other cells of the SG lineage. Blimp1 appears to govern cellular input into the gland since its loss leads to elevated c-myc expression, augmented cell proliferation, and SG hyperplasia. Finally, BrdU labeling experiments demonstrate that the SG defects associated with loss of Blimp1 lead to enhanced bulge stem cell activity, suggesting that when normal SG homeostasis is perturbed, multipotent stem cells in the bulge can be mobilized to correct this imbalance."

In this cell line, both USP28 and Chk2 are required for DNA-damage-induced apoptosis, and they accomplish this in part through regulation of the p53 induction of proapoptotic genes like PUMA. Our studies implicate DNA-damage-induced ubiquitination and deubiquitination as a major regulator of the DNA-damage response for Chk2, 53BP1, and a number of other proteins in the DNA-damage checkpoint pathway, including several mediators, such as Mdc1, Claspin, and TopBP1."

https://openalex.org/W2052960275,"RecA and its homologs help maintain genomic integrity through recombination. Using single-molecule fluorescence assays and hidden Markov modeling, we show the most direct evidence that a RecA filament grows and shrinks primarily one monomer at a time and only at the extremities. Both ends grow and shrink, contrary to expectation, but a higher binding rate at one end is responsible for directional filament growth. Quantitative rate determination also provides insights into how RecA might control DNA accessibility in vivo. We find that about five monomers are sufficient for filament nucleation. Although ordinarily single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSB) prevents filament nucleation, single RecA monomers can easily be added to an existing filament and displace SSB from DNA at the rate of filament extension. This supports the proposal for a passive role of RecA-loading machineries in SSB removal."

Neurol. 2002; 89: 199-210PubMed Google Scholar). These diseases include Unverricht-Lundborg disease, myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers, neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, and type I sialidosis, all of which manifest myoclonic seizures, tonic-clonic seizures, and progressive neurological dysfunction (4Lehesjoki A.E. Adv. Neurol. 2002; 89: 193-197PubMed Google Scholar). In each case, the causal gene mutations are known and mouse models have been generated, but despite these advances, the molecular mechanisms of the diseases remain unknown. Two genes have been identified that are mutated in Lafora disease. The first is EPM2A (epilepsy of progressive myoclonus type 2 gene A), which encodes laforin and is responsible for ∼48% of LD cases (5Minassian B.A. Lee J.R. Herbrick J.A. Huizenga J. Soder S.

Laforin is a dual specificity phosphatase that contains an NH2-terminal carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) and a COOH-terminal phosphatase active site motif, HCXXGXXR(S/T) (CX5R). Accordingly, recombinant laforin displays two functions in that it can bind complex polysaccharides as well as hydrolyze phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine/phosphothreonine substrates (7Wang J.

Disease mutations found in the gene encoding laforin include several missense mutations that disrupt the phosphatase activity as well as several that abrogate the ability of the carbohydrate-binding domain to bind complex polysaccharides (7Wang J.

Mutat. 2005; 26: 397-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A point mutation also exists that reduces the interaction of laforin with a glycogen scaffolding protein, the protein targeted to glycogen (PTG) (12Fernandez-Sanchez M.E. Criado-Garcia O. Heath K.E. Garcia-Fojeda B. Medrano-Fernandez I. Gomez-Garre P. Sanz P. Serratosa J.M. Rodriguez de Cordoba S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 3161-3171Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the CBM targets laforin to sites of glycogen metabolism (7Wang J. Stuckey J.A. Wishart M.J. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2377-2380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), a cellular process historically known to be regulated by phosphorylation. Collectively, these data suggests that both the phosphatase activity and the carbohydrate binding functions are critical for the function of laforin in glycogen metabolism. The second gene involved in Lafora disease, EPM2B, encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase, called malin, and is responsible for ∼40% of LD cases (13Gentry M.S. Worby C.A. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 8501-8506Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 14Chan E.M. Young E.J. Ianzano L. Munteanu I. Zhao X. Christopoulos C.C. Avanzini G. Elia M. Ackerley C.A. Jovic N.J. Bohlega S. Andermann E. Rouleau G.A. Delgado-Escueta A.V. Minassian B.A. Scherer S.W. Nat. Genet. 2003; 35: 125-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Malin is a multidomain protein containing a RING-HC and six NHL domains. RING domains are indicative of a class of E3 ubiquitin ligases, whereas NHL domains form a six-bladed β-propeller involved in protein-protein interactions (15Edwards T.A. Wilkinson B.D. Wharton R.P. Aggarwal A.K. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2508-2513Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 16Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 474-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We previously identified laforin as a binding partner of malin and provided evidence that malin binds laforin and polyubiquitinates it both in vitro and in vivo (13Gentry M.S. Worby C.A. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 8501-8506Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this polyubiquitination leads to the degradation of laforin in tissue culture cells (13Gentry M.S. Worby C.A. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 8501-8506Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Lending support to this surprising finding, Chan et al. (19Chan E.M. Ackerley C.A. Lohi H. Ianzano L. Cortez M.A. Shannon P. Scherer S.W. Minassian B.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 1117-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) reported that although laforin cannot be detected in wild type tissues, it could be detected in EPM2B null tissues. One of the clinical manifestations of LD is the appearance of insoluble carbohydrate deposits called Lafora bodies (LB) in the cytoplasm of nearly all cell types (2Lafora G. Z. Ges. Neurol. Psychiatr. 1911; 6: 1-14Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 20Busard H.L. Gabreels-Festen A.A. Renier W.O. Gabreels F.J. Stadhouders A.M. Ann.

Neurol. 1980; 8: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Because of this and the fact that laforin contains a CBM, it is hypothesized that laforin is involved in glycogen metabolism, either its synthesis or degradation. Normal cells store carbohydrates in the form of glycogen, a polymer of glucose residues linked together by α-1,4-glycosidic linkages with branches occurring every 8–12 residues via α-1,6-glycosidic linkages. This level of branching makes glycogen a homogenous water-soluble polymer. In contrast, although LBs are composed of the same backbone structure as glycogen, there are fewer α-1,6-glycosidic branches (25Yokoi S. Austin J. Witmer F. Sakai M. Arch. Neurol. 1968; 19: 15-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This decreased branching gives LBs a crystalline structure and renders them insoluble (25Yokoi S. Austin J. Witmer F. Sakai M. Arch. Neurol. 1968; 19: 15-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Additionally, LBs are significantly more phosphorylated than glycogen (26Sakai M. Austin J. Witmer F. Trueb L. Neurology. 1970; 20: 160-176Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, although LBs and glycogen differ in multiple structural aspects, LBs and amylopectin appear to be very similar. Amylopectin is the major component of plant starch and is composed of the same backbone structure as glycogen but with branches occurring every 24–30 glucose residues. This decreased amount of branching also renders amylopectin crystalline and insoluble. Additionally, the glucose monomers of amylopectin are phosphorylated on ∼1 in every 300 residues at either the C-3 or C-6 position (27Blennow A. Nielsen T.H. Baunsgaard L. Mikkelsen R. Engelsen S.B. Trends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 445-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Strikingly, the definitive biochemical studies on the structure of LBs revealed that LBs are more similar to amylopectin than to any other naturally occurring or synthetic compound, including mammalian glycogen (25Yokoi S. Austin J. Witmer F. Sakai M. Arch. Neurol. 1968; 19: 15-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 28Yokoi S. Austin J. Witmer F. J. Neuropathol. Exp.

In order to understand the molecular role of laforin in glycogen metabolism, we analyzed its protein-protein interactions in the cell. We further tested interacting proteins for their ability to act as substrates for the phosphatase activity of laforin. Since none of the proteinaceous substrates we tested appeared to be substrates for laforin, we questioned whether laforin could act on a nonproteinaceous substrate. Since LBs are similar to amylopectin, we tested amylopectin as a substrate and demonstrated that laforin effectively removes phosphate from this carbohydrate. We further demonstrate that this activity is specific for the laforin phosphatase and that replacing the laforin phosphatase domain with that of VHR, an active dual specificity phosphatase, does not confer activity toward amylopectin. Finally, we speculate on the consequences this unexpected activity could have on glycogen metabolism. Plasmids and Proteins—Wild type and C/S FLAG-tagged laforin for use in mammalian expression studies and bacterially expressed laforin in pET21a (Novagen, San Diego, CA) were described previously (7Wang J. Stuckey J.A. Wishart M.J. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2377-2380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). PTG family members were amplified from expressed sequence tags and inserted into the pcDNA3.1/myc-His eukaryotic expression vector (Invitrogen). HA-tagged GSK3β was a kind gift from David Pagliarini (Harvard University, Cambridge, MA). Recombinant His-tagged VHR expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) CodonPlus RIL cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was purified using Ni2+-agarose (Qiagen, Germany) as described previously (30Maehama T. Taylor G.S. Slama J.T. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 279: 248-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). PTPMT1 was a kind gift from David Pagliarini and Ji Zhou (University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA), and dullard was a kind gift from Youngjun Kim (University of California at San Diego). TCPTP and protein phosphatase 1 were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), and alkaline phosphatase (AlkP) was purchased from Roche Applied Science. Potato amylopectin and glycogen were purchased from Sigma. Cell Culture and Transfection—Adenovirus-transformed human embryonic kidney HEK293T cells were maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. CHO cells stably transformed with the insulin receptor, (CHO-IR), were maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in Eagle's minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 50 μg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen). Subconfluent cultures of HEK293T or CHO-IR cells (1–2 × 106 cells/100-mm dish) were transfected with FuGENE transfection reagent (Roche Applied Sciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transfected cells recovered 24–48 h prior to harvest to allow for protein expression. Immunoprecipitations (IPs)—24–48 h after transfection, cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, drained, and harvested in ice-cold lysis buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40 (Nonidet P-40), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The cells were lysed by titration and cleared by centrifugation at 8,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatants were mixed with anti-FLAG M2 affinity resin (Sigma) or anti-Myc-agarose (Sigma) for 2–4 h at 4 °C with constant agitation. The resins were pelleted by centrifugation at 500 × g for 1 min and washed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer. The beads were resuspended in 30 μl of 4× NuPage sample buffer (Invitrogen) and subjected to Western analyses. Western blots were probed with the following antibodies: α-FLAG HRP (Sigma), α-glycogen synthase (α-GS) (Chemicon, Temecula, CA), α-Myc HRP (Roche Applied Sciences), α-HA HRP (Roche Applied Sciences), GSK3β α-Ser(P)9 (BIO-SOURCE, Camarilo, CA), and α-Tyr(P) 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Charlottesville, VA). Goat α-mouse-HRP was used as needed. The HRP signal was detected by using Super-Signal West Pico (Pierce). Isolation of Phosphorylated GSK3β—CHO-IR cells were transfected with HA-tagged GSK3β and allowed to recover for 24 h. Immediately before harvesting, the cells were treated with 50 nm insulin for 5 min. Extracts were prepared as described above, and α-HA affinity resin (Roche Applied Science) was used to immunoprecipitate GSK3β. The α-HA affinity resin was washed three times with lysis buffer, one time with lysis buffer containing 1 m NaCl, one time with lysis buffer, and two times with phosphatase buffer. The final product was resuspended in 150 μl of phosphatase buffer (1× phosphatase reaction buffer: 0.1 m sodium acetate, 0.05 m bis-Tris, 0.05 m Tris-HCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, pH 6.5), and 20 μl was used in the phosphatase reaction (30 μl total) containing 500 ng of laforin. Tungstate (1 mm) was added prior to the addition of laforin. Phosphatase Activity Assays—Hydrolysis of para-nitrophenylphosphate (pNPP) was performed in 50-μl reactions containing 1× phosphatase buffer (above), 50 mm pNPP, and 100–500 ng of enzyme at 37 °C for 1–5 min. The reaction for dullard also contained 10 mm MgCl2, and the protein phosphatase 1 reaction mix contained 1 mm MnCl2. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 200 μl of 0.25 n NaOH. Absorbance was measured at 410 nm. Malachite green assays containing 1× phosphatase buffer (MgCl2 or MnCl2 when appropriate), 100–500 ng of enzyme, and ∼45 μg of amylopectin or glycogen were performed in a final volume of 20 μl. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 20 μl of 0.1 m N-ethylmaleimide and 80 μl of malachite green reagent. Absorbance was measured at 620 nm. GSK3β Is Not a Substrate of Laforin—Laforin is unique among phosphatases found in the animal kingdom in that it contains an NH2-terminal starch-binding domain of the subtype CBM20 (31Paldi T. Levy I. Shoseyov O. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 905-910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, we previously demonstrated that laforin binds to glycogen in vitro (7Wang J. Stuckey J.A. Wishart M.J. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2377-2380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In order to elucidate the role of laforin in cellular signaling, we sought to evaluate which proteins involved in glycogen metabolism would co-immunoprecipitate with laforin, with the idea that co-immunoprecipitating proteins could be potential substrates for the phosphatase. During the course of this study, it was reported that GSK3β co-immunoprecipitated with laforin and that laforin dephosphorylated Ser9 of GSK3β (32Lohi H. Ianzano L. Zhao X.C. Chan E.M. Turnbull J. Scherer S.W. Ackerley C.A. Minassian B.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 2727-2736Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). To test these findings, we transfected HA-tagged GSK3β into HEK293 and CHO-IR cells along with FLAG-tagged laforin and immunoprecipitated laforin using anti-FLAG. Despite robust expression of both laforin and GSK3β, GSK3β did not co-immunoprecipitate with laforin from HEK293 or CHO-IR cells (Fig. 1A) (data not shown). Despite this lack of interaction, we went on to determine if GSK3β was a substrate of laforin. For these experiments, we took advantage of the finding that laforinC266S (C/S laforin) acts as a dominant negative in the mouse model (19Chan E.M. Ackerley C.A. Lohi H. Ianzano L. Cortez M.A. Shannon P. Scherer S.W. Minassian B.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 1117-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), potentially “trapping” the substrate in the phosphorylated form. Thus, we hypothesized that overexpression of C/S laforin in tissue culture cells might “trap” the substrate of laforin in the phosphorylated form. The major regulatory site of phosphorylation on GSK3β is Ser9, and this was the site previously reported to be dephosphorylated by laforin (32Lohi H. Ianzano L. Zhao X.C. Chan E.M. Turnbull J. Scherer S.W. Ackerley C.A. Minassian B.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 2727-2736Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This is a particularly attractive hypothesis to explain the molecular mechanism of LD, since phosphorylation of Ser9 by an upstream kinase, such as Akt, results in inactivation of GSK3β (33Cross D.A. Watt P.W. Shaw M. van der Kaay J. Downes C.P. Holder J.C. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 406: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 34Halse R. Rochford J.J. McCormack J.G. Vandenheede J.R. Hemmings B.A. Yeaman S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 776-780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Inactive GSK3β is not able to phosphorylate GS, resulting in a more active form of GS and leading to increased glycogen synthesis. Wild type (WT) or C/S FLAG-tagged laforin along with HA-tagged GSK3β were transiently introduced into HEK293 cells. GSK3β was immunoprecipitated using anti-HA resin, and Western analysis using anti-Ser(P)9 antibody was performed to determine the phosphorylation level of Ser9 in vivo (Fig. 1B). There was no change in the phosphorylation status of this residue upon expression of WT versus C/S laforin. Nonetheless, we pursued the claim that GSK3β is a substrate of laforin and tested whether laforin could dephosphorylate GSK3β in vitro. Cells transiently overexpressing HA-tagged GSK3β were treated with insulin or platelet-derived growth factor to maximally phosphorylate GSK3β on Ser9. GSK3β was immunoprecipitated from cells and subjected to treatment with laforin in the presence or absence of tungstate, a potent phosphatase inhibitor. The ability of laforin to remove the phosphate from Ser9 was assessed by Western analysis using anti-Ser(P)9 antibodies. Consistent with our previous results, laforin was unable to dephosphorylate GSK3β in vitro (Fig. 1C). Since GSK3β activity is also thought to be regulated by Tyr phosphorylation (35Wang Q.M. Fiol C.J. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14566-14574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we tested to see if laforin could dephosphorylate GSK3β on Tyr residues using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. As shown in Fig. 1D, laforin did not dephosphorylate Tyr residues on GSK3β. In an effort to be fully confident that GSK3β is not a substrate of laforin, we monitored dephosphorylation of GSK3β by radiolabeling cells and checking for changes in the phosphate content of immunoprecipitated GSK3β in the presence of WT versus C/S laforin. These results were also negative (data not shown). Therefore, we conclude that contrary to a published report, GSK3β is not a substrate of laforin. Laforin Interacts with Proteins Involved in Glycogen Metabolism—In an effort to widen our search for the laforin substrate, we turned our attention to proteins that co-immunoprecipitate with laforin. We previously demonstrated that laforin co-localizes with glycogen synthase (GS) in cells overexpressing both GS and laforin (7Wang J. Stuckey J.A. Wishart M.J. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2377-2380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In addition, transgenic mice overexpressing GS in muscle manifest an aberrant form of glycogen that resembles LBs (36Pederson B.A. Csitkovits A.G. Simon R. Schroeder J.M. Wang W. Skurat A.V. Roach P.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 305: 826-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To ascertain if GS co-immunoprecipitates with laforin, WT or catalytically inactive (C/S) FLAG-tagged laforin expression vectors were transfected into CHO-IR cells followed by immunoprecipitation using anti-FLAG. Endogenous GS immunoprecipitated with both WT and C/S laforin (Fig. 2A, left panels). Similarly, both WT and C/S laforin were immunoprecipitated with endogenous GS using antibodies directed against GS (Fig. 2A, right panels). However, efforts utilizing both antibodies directed against phosphorylated GS and radiolabeling of cells overexpressing WT or C/S laforin, followed by analysis of the radioactive labeling of GS, failed to support the hypothesis that GS was a substrate of laforin (data not shown). Since PTG had previously been shown by two-hybrid analysis to interact with laforin, we next turned our attention to the members of the PTG family (12Fernandez-Sanchez M.E. Criado-Garcia O. Heath K.E. Garcia-Fojeda B. Medrano-Fernandez I. Gomez-Garre P. Sanz P. Serratosa J.M. Rodriguez de Cordoba S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 3161-3171Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). PTG (R5) and related family members GL, GM, and R6 serve as scaffolds to assemble proteins involved in glycogen metabolism. Although the binding partners of all of the family members have not yet been defined, PTG interacts with enzymes that regulate glycogen metabolism, including protein phosphatase 1, glycogen synthase, phosphorylase, phosphorylase kinase, and laforin (37Brady M.J. Printen J.A. Mastick C.C. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20198-20204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 38Doherty M.J. Young P.R. Cohen P.T.

The PTG family members display differential expression patterns in that PTG is expressed in all insulin-sensitive tissues, whereas GL is expressed mainly in the liver and GM is expressed in the muscle (40Doherty M.J. Moorhead G. Morrice N. Cohen P. Cohen P.T. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 41Gasa R. Jensen P.B. Berman H.K. Brady M.J. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26396-26403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). R6 displays a more ubiquitous expression pattern (42Armstrong C.G. Browne G.J. Cohen P. Cohen P.T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 210-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Each of the PTG family members was expressed as a Myc-tagged fusion protein in CHO-IR cells along with FLAG-tagged laforin. Laforin was immunoprecipitated from these cells and analyzed for the association of PTG family members using antibodies directed toward the Myc epitope. All of the PTG family members were detectable in CHO-IR cell extracts except GM, which was expressed at such low levels that the fusion protein could only be detected after immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2B, left panels). PTG, GL, and R6 all co-immunoprecipitated with laforin, with R6 being the most robust (Fig. 2B, right panel). GM could not be detected in the co-immunoprecipitate, possibly due to its low expression level (Fig. 2B, left panel). PTG was further evaluated as a substrate for laforin, as described above for GS, and similar negative results were obtained (data not shown). We utilized similar strategies to test the ability of laforin to dephosphorylate other enzymes involved in glycogen metabolism, including malin (13Gentry M.S. Worby C.A. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Our conclusion is that although laforin is found in a complex with many proteins involved in glycogen metabolism, it does not dephosphorylate any of the other proteins associated with glycogen metabolism that were tested. These results are in agreement with multiple studies that have failed to find any changes in the activities of enzymes associated with glycogen metabolism in LD patients (47Coleman D.L. Gambetti P.

Laforin Dephosphorylates a Complex Polysaccharide—CBM20 domains are commonly found in a variety of glycosylhydrolases in plants, fungi, and bacteria. The vast majority of enzymes that contain a CBM20 domain, such as α-amylase or glucoamylase, use this domain to bind directly to the carbohydrate and then enzymatically act on the sugar itself (31Paldi T. Levy I. Shoseyov O. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 905-910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As previously mentioned, LBs are structurally amylopectin-like in nature and are phosphorylated. Therefore, we hypothesized that laforin might dephosphorylate the LB itself. Since we have been unable to obtain enough pure LB material to test as a substrate, we turned to its closest equivalent, plant starch (25Yokoi S. Austin J. Witmer F. Sakai M. Arch.

https://openalex.org/W1973441339,"Countless numbers of insects migrate within and between continents every year, and yet we know very little about the ultimate reasons and proximate mechanisms that would explain these mass movements. Here we suggest that perhaps the most important reason for insects to migrate is to hedge their reproductive bets. By spreading their breeding efforts in space and time, insects distribute their offspring over a range of environmental conditions. We show how the study of individual long-distance movements of insects may contribute to a better understanding of migration. In the future, advances in tracking methods may enable the global surveillance of large insects such as desert locusts."

Here we address the role of spatial and temporal segregation in signal specificity by measuring the activity of endogenous PKC at defined intracellular locations in real time in live cells. We targeted a genetically encoded fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based reporter for PKC activity, C kinase activity reporter (CKAR) (Violin, J. D., Zhang, J., Tsien, R. Y., and Newton, A. C. (2003) J. Cell Biol. 161, 899-909), to the plasma membrane, Golgi, cytosol, mitochondria, or nucleus by fusing appropriate targeting sequences to the NH2 or COOH terminus of CKAR. Measuring the phosphorylation of the reporter in the presence of PKC inhibitors, activators, and/or phosphatase inhibitors shows that activity at each region is under differential control by phosphatase activity; nuclear activity is completely suppressed by phosphatases, whereas membrane-associated activity is the least suppressed by phosphatases. UTP stimulation of endogenous P2Y receptors in COS 7 cells reveals spatiotemporally divergent PKC responses. Imaging the second messengers Ca2+ and diacylglycerol (DAG) reveal that PKC activity at each location is driven by an initial spike in Ca2+, followed by location-specific diacylglycerol generation. In response to UTP, phosphorylation of GolgiCKAR was sustained the longest, driven by the persistence of DAG, whereas phosphorylation of CytoCKAR was of the shortest duration, driven by high phosphatase activity. Our data reveal that the magnitude and duration of PKC signaling is location-specific and controlled by the level of phosphatase activity and persistence of DAG at each location.

Cells respond dynamically to environmental cues conveyed by complex networks of signal transduction. Phosphorylation is the archetypal language that relays information from environmental stimuli throughout the cell; thus, hundreds of kinases and phosphatases exist to regulate the phosphorylation status of intracellular substrates. A delicate balance of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation underlies cellular decisions ranging from controlling global functions, such as proliferation or apoptosis, to regulating specialized functions, such as secretion of hormones (2Vermeulen K. Berneman Z.N. Van Bockstaele D.R. Cell Prolif. 2003; 36: 165-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 3Naor Z. Endocr. Rev. 1990; 11: 326-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Disturbing this balance can lead to disease states, most notably cancer (4Majumder P.K. Sellers W.R. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 7465-7474Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar).

There are 10 mammalian isozymes of the PKC family, and they share a conserved COOH-terminal kinase core as well as an NH2-terminal autoinhibitory pseudosubstrate peptide that is lodged in the active site under resting conditions. PKC isoforms are classified into three subcategories (conventional, novel, and atypical) based on differing composition of their regulatory modules, which lie between the kinase core and inhibitory pseudosubstrate peptide (5Newton A.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Conventional isoforms of PKC (cPKCs; α, βI, βII, and γ) contain a tandem C1 repeat followed by a C2 domain, which allow them to respond to the second messengers diacylglycerol (DAG) and Ca2+, respectively. When extracellular signals stimulate phosphoinositide hydrolysis, DAG is produced and Ca2+ is released. The binding of these second messengers to the regulatory domains results in translocation of cPKCs to cellular membranes. Both second messengers must be present for high affinity membrane binding, an event that provides the energy to disengage the inhibitory pseudosubstrate peptide from the active site, allowing downstream signaling (6Orr J.W. Newton A.C. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4661-4667Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Novel isoforms of PKC (nPKCs; δ, ϵ, η, and θ) are similarly activated by membrane binding; however, the novel C2 domain of the nPKCs cannot bind Ca2+. For these isozymes, high affinity membrane binding is achieved exclusively by the C1 domain, which compensates by having an increased affinity for DAG (7Giorgione J.R. Lin J.H. McCammon J.A. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1660-1669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Consequently, this subclass is regulated by DAG production but not by Ca2+ release. Atypical PKCs ζ and ι are unique in that they are not regulated by either DAG or Ca2+; their regulatory region consists of an atypical C1 domain that does not bind DAG and a PB1 (Phox and Bem 1) domain, recently recognized for its role in protein-protein interactions (8Lamark T.

Since activation of receptors can result in different profiles of Ca2+ release and DAG production, PKC isoforms are poised to respond to receptor activation with varying magnitude and duration of activity (9Oancea E. Meyer T. Cell. 1998; 95: 307-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Previously, our laboratory generated a genetically encoded fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based reporter for PKC activity (1Violin J.D. Zhang J. Tsien R.Y. Newton A.C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 899-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). C kinase activity reporter (CKAR) is composed of a cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) tethered together by a substrate peptide specific for PKC and an FHA2 phosphopeptide-binding module. When CKAR is not phosphorylated, excitation at the characteristic CFP wavelength (434 nm) results in FRET, and YFP emission (528 nm) is observed. When PKC phosphorylates the substrate sequence, the FHA2 domain binds the phosphopeptide, reducing the energy transfer and increasing CFP emission (476 nm). A ratio of CFP/FRET emission provides a readout of the phosphorylation state of the population of reporters in the cell. The affinity of the phosphopeptide for the phosphopeptide-binding module is sufficiently high to trigger intramolecular binding but, importantly, is also in a range that allows for access of the phospho-substrate to cellular phosphatases. Thus, CKAR is sensitive to dephosphorylation and provides a reversible, real time readout of the balance between PKC and phosphatase activity. Importantly, CKAR is an assay of endogenous PKC activity from live, intact cells and retains any potential inputs from other key cellular partners, such as protein and lipid regulatory factors. Although the plasma membrane has historically been considered the site of action of PKCs, several studies have demonstrated PKC translocation to the Golgi, mitochondria, and the nucleus in response to different stimuli (7Giorgione J.R.

However, mechanisms controlling the differential regulation of PKC activity, the balance between phosphatase and kinase activity, and the duration of signaling at these locations are not known. In this study, we targeted CKAR to the plasma membrane, Golgi, mitochondria, cytosol, and nucleus and characterized activity of PKC at each region in response to stimulation. We used a specific inhibitor of conventional PKCs, Gö6976, to measure basal PKC activity; the potent DAG mimic, PDBu, to measure stimulated PKC activity; and the phosphatase inhibitor, calyculin A, to measure phosphatase-suppressed PKC activity. Stimulation of endogenous P2Y G protein-coupled receptors with UTP in COS 7 cells revealed regionally divergent PKC responses. We investigated the underlying basis for phosphorylation profiles in COS 7 cells at each intracellular localization by imaging Ca2+ release and localized DAG production in response to UTP. We discovered that the early phase of the PKC response is governed by Ca2+ release, whereas the later phase of the PKC response is controlled by localized DAG persistence. Unexpectedly, in COS 7 cells, DAG production and the corresponding PKC response to UTP are highly sustained at the Golgi compared with the plasma membrane. Construction of Targeted Reporters—CKAR was generated previously in the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (+) (Invitrogen) (1Violin J.D. Zhang J. Tsien R.Y. Newton A.C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 899-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). The construct contains CFP and YFP tethered together by an FHA2 phosphopeptide binding domain followed by a PKC-specific substrate peptide. PMCKAR was created previously (MyrPalm-CKAR) (1Violin J.D. Zhang J. Tsien R.Y. Newton A.C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 899-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar) by the addition of sequences encoding the amino-terminal 7 amino acids of Lyn kinase to the 5′-end of CKAR. GolgiCKAR and MitoCKAR were generated by fusing in frame sequences encoding the amino-terminal 33 amino acids of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase and the amino-terminal 33 amino acids of TOM 20, respectively, to the immediate 5′-end of CKAR (13Fulton D.

CytoCKAR was generated by fusing a region encoding the nuclear export sequence, LALKLAGLDI, to the 3′-end of CKAR immediately preceding the termination codon (16Wen W. Meinkoth J.L. Tsien R.Y. Taylor S.S. Cell. 1995; 82: 463-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar). NucCKAR was generated similarly by fusing to the 3′-end of CKAR sequences encoding a basic nuclear localization signal, PKKRKVEDA (17Makkerh J.P. Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1025-1027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Construction of Other Plasmids—Diacylglycerol reporter (DAGR) was constructed as previously described (1Violin J.D. Zhang J. Tsien R.Y. Newton A.C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 899-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). PMCFP was constructed as previously described (1Violin J.D. Zhang J. Tsien R.Y. Newton A.C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 899-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar); the amino-terminal 7 residues of Lyn kinase were attached to the 5′-end of monomeric CFP. GolgiCFP was constructed similar to GolgiCKAR; sequences encoding the amino-terminal 33 residues of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase were fused in frame to the 5′-end of CFP (13Fulton D. Babbitt R. Zoellner S. Fontana J. Acevedo L. McCabe T.J. Iwakiri Y. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30349-30357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). YFP-tagged DAG binding domain (YFP-DBD) was first constructed by fusion of monomeric YFP to the 5′-end of the C1b domain of PKCβ. This construct was improved for DAG binding by introducing the Y123W point mutation via QuikChange (Stratagene). Cell Culture—COS 7 cells were used in all experiments. These cells were plated and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cellgro) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells were plated in sterilized 35-mm imaging dishes at 60% confluence and transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). For DAGR imaging experiments, cells were cotransfected with PMCFP and YFP-DBD (PMDAGR) or GolgiCFP and YFP-DBD (GolgiDAGR). Cells were allowed to grow posttransfection for 12-24 h before imaging. For Ca2+ imaging experiments, 1.0 μm Fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) was loaded into cells for 30 min, and cells were washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution (Cellgro) before imaging. Cell Imaging—COS 7 cells were rinsed once with and imaged in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 1 mm Ca2+. For imaging in Ca2+-free saline, cells were rinsed once with and imaged in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 5 mm EGTA. Images were acquired on a Zeiss Axiovert microscope (Carl Zeiss Microimaging, Inc.) using a MicroMax digital camera (Roper-Princeton Instruments) controlled by MetaFluor software (Universal Imaging, Corp.). Optical filters were obtained from Chroma Technologies. Using a 10% neutral density filter, CFP and FRET images were obtained every 10-15 s through a 420/20-nm excitation filter, a 450-nm dichroic mirror, and a 475/40-nm emission filter (CFP) or 535/25-nm emission filter (FRET). YFP emission was also monitored as a control for photobleaching through a 495/10-nm excitation filter, a 505-nm dichroic mirror, and a 535/25-nm emission filter. Images of cells loaded with Fura-2 were obtained every 10 s through a 380/10-nm or 340/10-nm excitation filter, a 450-nm dichroic mirror, and a 535/45-nm emission filter. Excitation and emission filters were switched in filter wheels (Lambda 10-2; Sutter). Integration times were 200 ms for CFP, FRET, and Fura-2 and 50-100 ms for YFP. Imaging Data Analysis—Images were reanalyzed using Metaflour Analyst (Universal Imaging Corp.). One region per cell was selected such that there was no net movement of the targeted reporter in and out of the selected region, and Metafluor Analyst was used to calculate the average FRET ratio within the selected region as described previously (1Violin J.D. Zhang J. Tsien R.Y. Newton A.C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 899-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Base-line images were acquired for 15-30 min before adding ligand. In some cases, there was a base-line drift that accounted for up to a 7% change in maximal FRET ratio per 10 min. This base line was subtracted from traces. The corrected data traces were normalized to 1 by dividing by the average base-line FRET ratio, and data from different imaging dishes were referenced around the ligand addition time point. The normalized average FRET ratio is the average of these corrected values ± S.E. Targeted CKARs—To monitor PKC activity at defined intracellular locations, we fused short sequences to the amino or carboxyl terminus of the reporter that drive specific intracellular localization. The fluorescent images in Fig. 1 show the subcellular localization of the targeted CKAR constructs expressed in COS 7 cells. PMCKAR (Fig. 1A) contains the NH2-terminal 7 residues of Lyn kinase fused in frame before CFP, effectively targeting it to the plasma membrane via myristoylation and palmitoylation (1Violin J.D. Zhang J. Tsien R.Y. Newton A.C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 899-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). GolgiCKAR (Fig. 1B) was targeted to the cytoplasmic face of the Golgi apparatus by attaching the NH2-terminal 33 residues of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (13Fulton D. Babbitt R. Zoellner S. Fontana J. Acevedo L. McCabe T.J. Iwakiri Y. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30349-30357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 15Sasaki K. Sato M. Umezawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30945-30951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). CytoCKAR (Fig. 1C) was excluded from the nucleus by COOH-terminal fusion of a hydrophobic sequence for nuclear export (16Wen W. Meinkoth J.L. Tsien R.Y. Taylor S.S. Cell. 1995; 82: 463-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar) and MitoCKAR (Fig. 1D) was targeted to the outer mitochondrial membrane by fusion of the NH2-terminal 33 residues of TOM 20 (14Kanaji S. Iwahashi J. Kida Y. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 277-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). NucCKAR (Fig. 1E) was localized to the nucleus by COOH-terminal fusion of a basic nuclear localization sequence (17Makkerh J.P. Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1025-1027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Fig. 1F shows a schematic representation of the localization of the tethered CKARs. To verify proper targeting of GolgiCKAR and MitoCKAR, we stained cells transfected with the reporters using Golgi-specific tracker dye, BODIPY TR C5 ceramide, and with mitochondria-specific tracker dye, Deep Red-Fluorescent Mito-Tracker® (Invitrogen). The reporters completely co-localized with dyes specific for their respective cellular compartment (data not shown). Note that the juxtanuclear concentration of GolgiCKAR was dispersed in the presence of the Golgi-fragmenting agent, Brefeldin A; we also observed a minimal juxtanuclear concentration of PMCKAR, and this was insensitive to brefeldin A (data not shown), suggesting that the apparent juxtanuclear concentration of PMCKAR was in a region distinct from Golgi. The specificity and reversibility of phosphorylation was tested for each targeted reporter by addressing the sensitivity to activation by phorbol esters and inhibition by a PKC-specific inhibitor. Fig. 2 shows that PDBu treatment of COS 7 cells triggered an increase in FRET ratio of GolgiCKAR, revealing robust activity of endogenous PKC at this location. This phosphorylation was reversed with the addition of the specific PKC inhibitor, Gö6983. Similar phorbol ester-dependent and inhibitor-reversed phosphorylation was noted for each targeted CKAR (data not shown). Dynamic Range of Targeted CKARs—Phorbol esters, potent functional analogs of DAG, are the classic tool for activating PKC in cells (18Castagna M. Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Sano K. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7847-7851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We first determined the kinetics and magnitude of the stimulated PKC response at each cellular region as a consequence of PDBu treatment. Fig. 3A shows the change in FRET ratio following PDBu stimulation of COS 7 cells expressing either PMCKAR, GolgiCKAR, CytoCKAR, MitoCKAR, or NucCKAR. The fastest response was observed at the plasma membrane (t½ ≈ 0.6 min), followed by Golgi (t½ ≈ 2.7 min), mitochondria (t½ ≈ 4 min), and cytosol (t½ ≈ 7 min). These differences did not simply reflect the rate of PDBu partitioning, since the isolated C1b domain from PKCβ translocated to membranes throughout the cell within 0.5 min of PDBu addition (data not shown). No PDBu-stimulated activity was observed in the nucleus. The highest magnitude of the response was at the Golgi. Although the initial FRET ratios varied, the normalized traces were highly consistent in rate and magnitude and were characteristic to each region. Reversal of PDBu-stimulated activity by inhibition of PKC typically resulted in a decrease in reporter phosphorylation below base line (Fig. 2A), leading us to hypothesize that the differences in PDBu-stimulated activity might result from differing levels of basal PKC activity at each region. Thus, after acquiring base-line images, we measured the effect of treating cells with the conventional PKC inhibitor Gö6976 as a measure of the basal PKC activity (Fig. 3B). Although Gö6983 specifically inhibits all isoforms of PKC, it could not be used to characterize the basal activity, because it emits at a wavelength that is visible in the FRET channel and partitions unequally within the cell (data not shown). The highest basal activity was at the plasma membrane. GolgiCKAR and CytoCKAR were also basally phosphorylated, whereas NucCKAR and MitoCKAR responded minimally to inhibition of basal PKC activity with Gö6976. Thus, basal PKC activity in unstimulated cells varies dramatically depending on the cellular region. Another component of the localized PKC response is the opposition to substrate phosphorylation by regional phosphatases. We reasoned that the basis for low basal and stimulated activity in some areas may be potent signal termination by local phosphatases. To test this hypothesis, we first stimulated PKC with PDBu and allowed phosphorylation to reach a steady state. Once the response leveled, we added the broad spectrum phosphatase inhibitor, calyculin A, to release phosphatase suppression (Fig. 3C). Inhibition of phosphatases resulted in a robust phosphorylation of nuclear CKAR and, to a lesser extent, cytosolic CKAR. Membrane-tethered CKAR was much less sensitive to phosphatase inhibition, particularly at the plasma membrane, where the prior treatment with phorbol esters had resulted in maximal CKAR phosphorylation. Interestingly, even in the absence of PDBu, inhibition of phosphatase activity with calyculin A was sufficient to induce phosphorylation of CKAR at each region (Fig. 3D). The increase in CKAR phosphorylation upon treatment with calyculin A was a specific effect of releasing PKC inhibition, since it was blocked with Gö6983. 3J. Violin, unpublished results. These data reveal that PKC activity is antagonized by phosphatases to varying degrees depending on the enzyme's cellular location. Assembling the components of the PKC response at each region into a bar graph revealed that the sum of basal, stimulated, and phosphatase-suppressed PKC activity was similar at all intracellular regions, with the exception of MitoCKAR, which had about two-thirds the range of an untethered reporter (Fig. 3E). Further analysis revealed that the mitochondrial reporter, unlike all of the others, becomes partially cleaved within CFP when expressed in mammalian cells (data not shown). Thus, with the exception of MitoCKAR, the range of the reporters was not affected by targeting, thus allowing accurate comparison of responses following stimulation of endogenous signaling pathways. Furthermore, this characterization reveals that the subsequent data showing phosphorylation of the targeted CKARs in response to the G protein-coupled receptor ligand, UTP, is not limited by reporter saturation. Localized PKC Responses to Stimulation of Endogenous Receptors—We next addressed the profile of regional phosphorylation triggered by receptor-mediated stimulation. UTP initiates a PKC response by activating Gq-coupled P2Y receptors on the surface of epithelial cells, producing the second messengers DAG and inositol trisphosphate, which stimulates intracellular Ca2+ release (19Balboa M.A. Firestein B.L.

Fig. 4 summarizes targeted CKAR phosphorylation in COS 7 cells in response to UTP. PMCKAR, GolgiCKAR, and CytoCKAR were rapidly phosphorylated, with an early crest (peaking within 1 min) followed by a late sustained plateau. Phosphorylation on CytoCKAR was most readily reversed back to base line, consistent with higher phosphatase sensitivity of CytoCKAR. Phosphorylation on GolgiCKAR was sustained throughout the course of the experiment, whereas PMCKAR was dephosphorylated to base line within 35 min. MitoCKAR and NucCKAR were not readily phosphorylated in response to UTP. Second Messenger Responses—We next examined the underlying causes for the biphasic nature of the PKC response to UTP. Specifically, we asked how CKAR phosphorylation correlated with production of Ca2+ and DAG. First, we monitored Ca2+ release downstream of receptor stimulation using the Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent probe, Fura-2 (21Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Fig. 5A reveals the temporal relationship between Ca2+ release and the early phase of the PKC response at the Golgi and plasma membrane. Upon the addition of UTP, a transient wave of Ca2+ was released that corresponded with the early phase of PKC activity. To confirm that this early phase of PKC activity is driven by Ca2+, we monitored phosphorylation in response to UTP after pretreatment with BAPTA to chelate intracellular Ca2+ (22Harrison S.M. Bers D.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 925: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Chelation of Ca2+ abolished the early peak in PKC activity both at the plasma membrane (Fig. 5B) and at the Golgi (Fig. 5C). These data reveal that Ca2+ is required for the initial peak in PKC activity following UTP stimulation. The rate of PMCKAR phosphorylation (t½ ≈ 0.2 min) was significantly reduced in the presence of BAPTA (t½ ≈ 1.2 min). The rate of GolgiCKAR phosphorylation in the presence of BAPTA was also reduced, although only modestly. This reduction could arise because novel PKCs are activated at a slower rate than conventional PKCs or because the lower level of novel PKCs compared with conventional PKCs in COS cells results in slower kinetics of CKAR phosphorylation. Alternatively, the diminished activity in the presence of BAPTA could represent partial activation of conventional PKCs, with the C1 domain participating in activation by binding DAG but the C2 domain refraining from providing the extra energy to fully disengage the pseudosubstrate. To address whether the slower phosphorylation catalyzed by endogenous novel PKCs (i.e. in the presence of BAPTA) reflected subsaturating concentrations of these kinases, we transfected in PKCδ, a novel isoform, to attempt to rescue the fast kinetics of phosphorylation in response to UTP. To ensure the residual activity was not due to partial activation of cPKCs, we also added the conventional PKC inhibitor, Gö6976. Gö6976 did not block the response, and, although the response was slightly faster with overexpressed PKCδ (as a result of higher total PKC expression), the fast phase of the PKC response was not restored (Fig. 5, B and C). Therefore, Ca2+-responsive cPKCs are responsible for the fast, early phase of the PKC response whereas nPKCs account for the slow, later phase of the PKC response. Because Ca2+ release was necessary for the fast phase of PKC activation, we tested if calcium release alone was sufficient for activation of cPKCs. To uncouple Ca2+ release from DAG production, we stimulated COS 7 cells with UTP in the absence of extracellular calcium and in the presence of cellimpermeant Ca2+ chelator, EGTA. This allows Ca2+ release from intracellular stores, resulting in a sharp peak of calcium release (Fig. 5D), but does not allow calcium-induced calcium release. Under these conditions, no overall DAG increase occurred, as"

Among the unsolved problems are the nature of genetic spatial control of migration and the relationships between celestial and magnetic compass mechanisms and between different map-related cues in orientation and homing, respectively. In addition, navigation is expected to differ between animal groups depending on sensory capabilities and ecological conditions. Evaluations based on modern long-term tracking techniques of the geometry of migration routes and individual migration history, combined with behavioral experiments and exploration of the sensory and genetic mechanisms, will be crucial for understanding the spatial principles that guide animals on their global journeys."

Microtubules in the nervous system undergo a unique post-translational modification, polyglutamylation of the C termini of their tubulin subunits. The mammalian enzymes that perform β-tubulin polyglutamylation as well as their physiological functions in the neuronal tissue remain elusive. We report identification of a mammalian polyglutamylase with specificity for β-tubulin as well as its distribution and function in neurite growth. To identify putative tubulin polyglutamylases, we searched tubulin tyrosine ligase-like (TTLL) proteins for those predominantly expressed in the nervous system. Of 13 TTLL proteins, TTLL7 was transcribed at the highest level in the nervous system. Recombinant TTLL7 catalyzed tubulin polyglutamylation with high preference to β-tubulin in vitro. When expressed in HEK293T cells, TTLL7 demonstrated specificity for β-tubulin and not for α-tubulin or nucleosome assembly protein 1. Consistent with these findings, knockdown of TTLL7 in a primary culture of superior cervical ganglion neurons caused a loss of polyglutamylated β-tubulin. Following stimulation of PC12 cells with nerve growth factor to differentiate, the level of TTLL7 increased concomitantly with polyglutamylation of β-tubulin. Short interference RNA-mediated knockdown of TTLL7 repressed nerve growth factor-stimulated MAP (microtubule-associated protein) 2-positive neurite growth in PC12 cells. Consistent with having a role in the growth of MAP2-positive neurites, TTLL7 accumulated within a MAP2-enriched somatodendritic portion of superior cervical ganglion, as did polyglutamylated β-tubulin.

Microtubules have important functions in a variety of dynamic activities within the cell including intracellular transport, cell motility, and cell division. They provide structural support for the cell and are an important component of the cytoskeletal framework that generates cell morphology. In neurons microtubules are required for formation of specialized processes, i.e. dendrites and axons. Structural microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), 2The abbreviations used are: MAP, microtubule-associated protein; PTM, post-translational modifications; TTL, tubulin tyrosine ligase; TTLL, tubulin tyrosine ligase-like; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SCG, superior cervical ganglion; FBS, fetal bovine serum; HEK, human embryonic kidney; NGF, nerve growth factor; siRNA, short interference RNA; NAP, nucleosome assembly protein; mAb, monoclonal antibody. 2The abbreviations used are: MAP, microtubule-associated protein; PTM, post-translational modifications; TTL, tubulin tyrosine ligase; TTLL, tubulin tyrosine ligase-like; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SCG, superior cervical ganglion; FBS, fetal bovine serum; HEK, human embryonic kidney; NGF, nerve growth factor; siRNA, short interference RNA; NAP, nucleosome assembly protein; mAb, monoclonal antibody. such as MAP2 and tau, regulate the stability of microtubules in those processes. Microtubules are predominantly composed of tubes of polymerized dimers of α- and β-tubulin. A central question in cell biology is how functional heterogeneity is imparted to different types (e.g. dendritic, axonal, and centriolar) of microtubules. Two basic mechanisms have been proposed to explain this issue. The first involves duplication and divergence of genes encoding tubulin. The second mechanism involves the addition of a variety of post-translational modifications (PTM) to microtubules that further increases the tubulin heterogeneity (1Luduena R.F. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1998; 178: 207-275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These PTMs are associated with different microtubule states, such as the structure and its age. For example, acetylated α-tubulin (2L'Hernault S.W. Rosenbaum J.L. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 473-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) and detyrosinated α-tubulin (3Argarana C.E. Barra H.S. Caputto R. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1978; 19: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) are enriched in highly stable, i.e. long-lived, populations of microtubules (4Cambray-Deakin M.A. Burgoyne R.D. Cell Motil. Cytoskel. 1987; 8: 284-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Although the correlation between tubulin modifications and microtubule states has been established for more than 20 years, the physiological function of these modifications is poorly understood. Among PTMs, polyglutamylation (5Eddé B. Rossier J. Le Caer J.P. Desbruyères E. Gros F. Denoulet P. Science. 1990; 247: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) and polyglycylation (6Redeker V. Levilliers N. Schmitter J.M. Le Caer J.P. Rossier J. Adoutte A. Bré M.H. Science. 1994; 266: 1688-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) are unique modifications observed in specific cell types. The great majority of tubulin in the adult mammalian brain is polyglutamylated (7Wolff A. de Néchaud B. Chillet D. Mazarguil H. Desbruyères E. Audebert S. Eddé B. Gros F. Denoulet P. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 59: 425-532PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that this PTM has an important function in neural development or homeostasis. Tubulin polyglutamylation can regulate the binding affinity of MAPs, including kinesin motor proteins, to microtubules in vivo (8Boucher D. Larcher J.C. Gros F. Denoulet P.

Neurobiol. 2004; 58: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Polyglutamylated α-tubulin is present at similar levels in the brain during development from neonate to adult. In contrast, steady-state levels of polyglutamylated β-tubulin increase gradually during this period (12Audebert S. Koulakoff A. Berwald-Netter Y. Gros F. Denoulet P. Eddé B. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2313-2322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which suggests that this latter PTM may be required for maturation of the nervous system. Janke et al. (13Janke C. Rogowski K. Wloga D.

We have identified a physiological function for polyglutamylated α-tubulin in regulating kinesin motor traffic. 3K. Ikegami, M. Taruishi, R. L. Heier, H. Takagi, M. Mukai, S. Shimma, S. Taira, K.

In contrast to the recent exciting progress of research on α-tubulin polyglutamylation, neither the mammalian enzymes responsible for polyglutamylation of β-tubulin nor the functions for this modification have been identified. Here, we provide the first evidence that TTLL7 is a β-tubulin-specific mammalian polyglutamylase that is expressed at high levels in the nervous system. We show that TTLL7 and polyglutamylated β-tubulin accumulate in MAP2-enriched subcellular compartments and demonstrate that polyglutamylation of β-tubulin is required for MAP2-positive neurite growth in PC12 cells. Antibodies—Anti-polyglutamylated tubulin monoclonal antibody, GT335 (7Wolff A. de Néchaud B. Chillet D. Mazarguil H. Desbruyères E. Audebert S. Eddé B. Gros F. Denoulet P. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 59: 425-532PubMed Google Scholar) was a kind gift from Dr. Bernard Eddé. Monoclonal antibodies against α-tubulin (DM1A), β-tubulin (Tub2.1), neurofilament (NN18), MAP1A (HM-1), MAP2 (HM-2), FLAG epitope (M2), and anti-actin polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Monoclonal antibodies for Tau (Tau-1), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (6C5), and anti-MAP2 polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). Anti-V5 monoclonal antibody was obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Anti-β-tubulin monoclonal antibody (DM1B) and polyclonal antibody for α-tubulin were purchased from Lab Vision (Fremont, CA). Anti-TTLL7 antiserum was raised in rabbits immunized with maltose-binding protein-fused TTLL7 (Δ370; corresponding to residues 371–609). The recombinant TTLL7 purified by amylose resin (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA) was mixed with Freund's adjuvant (Sigma-Aldrich) and injected subcutaneously on the dorsum of rabbits. Anti-TTLL7 antibodies were purified with maltose-binding protein-TTLL7-bound column. Plasmid Construction—cDNA containing whole coding sequences of each mouse TTLL protein and NAP1 were cloned according to the NCBI data base or were purchased from DNAFORM (Yokohama, Japan). The corresponding accession numbers of each gene TTLL are as follows: mTTL, BC018513; mTTLL1, BC010510; mTTLL3, AK080321; mTTLL6, AK077033; mTTLL7, AK014905; mTTLL13, AK029565; mNAP1, AK050375. Mammalian expression vectors were prepared by using the GATEWAY system (Invitrogen) or by direct insertion of coding sequence. The full coding sequences of mTTLLs, except for mTTL, were amplified using primers compatible to the GATEWAY system. Amplified fragments were subcloned into the pDONR207 vector (Invitrogen). To obtain expression vector for FLAG-tagged protein, pCMV-Tag 4A vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was converted into destination vector using the GATEWAY vector conversion system (Invitrogen). GATEWAY system-compatible expression vector of EGFP-fused protein was generated by conversion of pEGFP-C1 vector (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ) to destination vector. Final coding sequence-harboring expression vectors were generated by performing LR reaction (Invitrogen). Expression vectors for FLAG-tagged mTTL and mNAP1 were prepared by direct ligation into pCMV-Tag 4A vector using restriction enzyme. All of the coding sequences in plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing before use. The sequences inserted to expression vectors were as follows: mTTL, 204–1334 of BC018513; mTTLL1, 337–1605 of BC010510; mTTLL3, 84–2195 of AK080321; mTTLL6, 799–2953 with a deletion of G at 951 of AK077033; mTTLL7, 360–2186 of AK014905; mTTLL13, 590–2710 of AK029565; mNAP1, 686–1858 of AK050375. For bacterial expression, a whole coding sequence of mTTLL7 was cloned into pET vector (Novagen, Merck Biosciences, Tokyo). An enzyme-inactive form of mTTLL7 was obtained by adding a point mutation into coding sequence so that Glu at 349 was replaced with Val, which results in failure of the enzyme to capture magnesium ion (13Janke C.

Science. 2005; 308: 1758-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Microarray Analysis Using BioExpress Data Base—We performed a data base search and statistical analysis on TTLL mRNA expression among various tissues in humans that were profiled by Affymetrix GeneChip technology and stored in the commercial Gene Logic BioExpress data base system. The expression intensities were normalized by the Affymetrix global scaling method. In Situ Hybridization—Mouse brain sections were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde following treatment with 1 μg/ml proteinase K in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% Tween 20. Hybridization was performed overnight at 65 °C with digoxigenin-labeled RNA probes. The hybridized probes were reacted with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibody (diluted at 1:1,000; Roche Applied Science) at 4 °C overnight and then visualized by coloring reaction in the NTMT solution (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Tween 20, and 2 mm levamisole) containing 35 mg/ml nitro blue tetrazolium (Roche Applied Science), 17.5 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Roche Applied Science), and 2 mm levamisole (Sigma). Assay for Tubulin Polyglutamylase—Glutathione S-transferase-fused mTTLL7 synthesized in Escherichia coli Rossetta strain (DE3) was purified by chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Piscataway, NJ) and then cleaved using PreScission protease at 4 °C to liberate the recombinant protein. Mouse brain tubulin was purified through two cycles of polymerization-depolymerization in a high molarity buffer as described (17Castoldi M. Popov A.V. Protein Expression Purif. 2003; 32: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Enzyme activity was measured by incorporation of [3H]glutamate into tubulin at pH 7.0. Before the addition of recombinant TTLL7 (5 μg/ml at final concentration), l-[3H]glutamate and 2 mm ATP, the reaction mixture (50 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 8 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μm paclitaxel, 0.2 mg/ml purified mouse brain tubulin) was warmed at 37 °C for 10 min to polymerize microtubules. After incubation of the mixture (10 μl) at 30 °C for 1 h, the reaction was subjected to SDS-PAGE using 95% purity SDS (Sigma-Aldrich) to separate α- and β-tubulins. The separated tubulins were blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. To visualize the migrating position of α- and β-tubulin, the membrane was stained with Ponceau S. Radioactivity incorporated into tubulins was quantified from excised bands using a Winspectral 1414 liquid scintillation counter (Wallac, Turku, Finland) for 1 min. Cell Culture—Culture of mouse superior cervical ganglion (SCG) neurons was prepared as described (18Ikegami K. Koike T. Neuroscience. 2003; 122: 617-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and cultured in minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Dissociated neurons and micro-explant of SCG were seeded onto plastic plates coated with 0.1 mg/ml of poly-l-lysine- and 10 μg/ml of laminin. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS. Rat kangaroo kidney (PtK2) cells were cultured in 10% FBS-containing minimal essential medium supplemented with nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen) and sodium pyruvate. Plasmids were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PC12 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% FBS and 5% horse serum. Neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells was induced by exposing cells to medium containing 100 ng/ml nerve growth factor (NGF), 0.5% FBS, and 0.5% horse serum. RNA Interference Knockdown—Knockdown of TTLL7 was accomplished using 200 nm 21-mer short interference RNA (siRNA; from Thermo Electron, Sedansrasse, Germany) and 8 μl/ml Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Target sequences for RNA interference were chosen using siDirect, highly effective, and target-specific siRNA design software (19Ui-Tei K. Naito Y. Takahashi F. Haraguchi T. Ohki-Hamazaki H. Juni A. Ueda R. Saigo K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 936-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 20Naito Y. Yamada T. Ui-Tei K. Morishita S. Saigo K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The target sequences of siRNA used were 5′-UUGUUCCGAGAACGUGGAUUU-3′ (against mouse TTLL7) and 5′-UUGAUAAGAAAUGGGGAUAAA-3′ (against rat TTLL7). The sequence 5′-AAUUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGU-3′ was used as a nonspecific siRNA negative control. This sequence is not found in the mouse genome. To diminish target proteins, cultures of SCG neurons were treated with siRNA twice for a total period of 1 week. Western Blot Analysis—Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore, Beverly, MA). When α- and β-tubulin were separated, we used 95% purity SDS (Sigma). The proteins were labeled with primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). The antibodies were used at the following dilutions: GT335, 1:20,000; DM1A, 1:10,000; Tub2.1, 1:2,000; DM1B, 1:1,000; 6C5, 1:5,000; anti-actin, 1:1,000; NN18, 1:5,000; HM-1, 1:500; HM-2, 1:2,000; tau-1, 1:5,000; M2, 1:2,000; anti-V5, 1:20,000; anti-TTLL7, 1:1,000. Signal was visualized using an ECL kit (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences). Immunocytochemical Analysis—The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS prewarmed to 37 °C, to prevent cold shock-induced depolymerization of microtubules. Fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min and then incubated in 5% goat serum/PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Incubation of cells in primary antibody was performed at 4 °C overnight. After rinsing in PBS, the cells were incubated with fluorescently labeled secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were rinsed briefly and mounted before observation with a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM5 Pascal; Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany; or Fluoview FV1000; Olympus, Japan). Immunohistochemical Analysis—Adult mice were anesthetized and perfused intracardially with heparin, then with 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.1% glutaraldehyde solution in phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, followed by brief perfusions with solutions of 10, 20, and 30% sucrose. The brains and spinal cords of the mice were immersed overnight in 30% sucrose solution at 4 °C. Coronal brain sections (10 μm thick) were cut through the cerebrum using a freezing cryostat. The sections were rinsed in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), treated with 50 mm glycine in phosphate buffer, and then incubated for 30 min in 3% skim milk in phosphate buffer. The sections were incubated with the primary antibody in 3% skim milk/phosphate buffer overnight at 4 °C. For the negative control, we incubated the sections with preimmune serum. The incubated sections were washed three times with PBS. The sections were processed with an Alexa Fluor fluorescent dye-conjugated secondary antibody (Invitrogen). The images were obtained with a confocal microscope (Fluoview FV1000) equipped with a 20×, 0.75 na objective lens, and appropriate fluorescence filter sets. TTLL7 Is Predominantly Expressed in Neuronal Tissues and Is a Candidate for a Tubulin Polyglutamylase—TTL is a tubulin-modifying enzyme that belongs to a large superfamily of “ADP-forming” or “ATP grasp” enzymes that possesses ATP-dependent carboxylate-amine ligase activity (21Galperin M.Y. Koonin E.V. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2639-2643Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 22Dideberg O. Bertrand J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 57-58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). TTL ligates a tyrosine to the α-carboxyl group of a C-terminal glutamate. Analysis of the mouse genome by BLAST search using a TTL identified 13 independent loci encoding “TTL domain-containing,” i.e. TTL-like (TTLL) proteins (Fig. 1, A and B, and supplemental Table S1).

Science. 2005; 308: 1758-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that TTLL1 is a catalytic subunit of polyglutamylase complex biochemically purified from mouse brain. Moreover, they have identified Tetrahymena TTLL1 and TTLL6A as tubulin polyglutamylase on α-tubulin and β-tubulin, respectively (13Janke C. Rogowski K. Wloga D. Regnard C. Kajava A.V. Strub J.M. Temurak N. van Dijk J. Boucher D. van Dorsselaer A. Suryavanshi S. Gaertig J. Eddé B. Science. 2005; 308: 1758-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Given the findings by Janke et al., the 13 TTLL proteins might include mammalian β-tubulin polyglutamylases. Because the brain has high levels of polyglutamylated tubulin (7Wolff A. de Néchaud B. Chillet D. Mazarguil H. Desbruyères E. Audebert S. Eddé B. Gros F. Denoulet P. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 59: 425-532PubMed Google Scholar), we predicted that tubulin polyglutamylases are expressed in this organ. To determine whether TTLL proteins were expressed in the nervous system, we screened a human cDNA library by a microarray analysis. The results indicated that TTLL7 is highly expressed in the nervous system including spinal cord, thalamus, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and cerebellum (Table 1 and Fig. 1C). Indeed, TTLL7 transcripts were present throughout the mouse brain, especially in the hippocampus, thalamus, olfactory bulb, and cerebellum (Fig. 1D). Moreover, analysis of expressed sequence tag data bases at NCBI suggests that expression of mouse TTLL7 is dominant in whole brain. 4Expression profile suggested by analysis of expressed sequence tag counts for mouse TTLL7 can be accessed through NCBI UniGene Data Base under-NCBI accession number Mm.187793. Thus, TTLL7 is a candidate for a tubulin polyglutamylase in the mammalian nervous system. The study by Janke et al. (13Janke C. Rogowski K. Wloga D. Regnard C. Kajava A.V. Strub J.M. Temurak N. van Dijk J. Boucher D. van Dorsselaer A. Suryavanshi S. Gaertig J. Eddé B. Science. 2005; 308: 1758-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) strongly supports this conclusion because mammalian TTLL7 is a close relative to Tetrahymena TTLL6A.TABLE 1Tissues dominantly expressing each TTLL proteinTTLL proteinsDominantly expressing tissueTTLL1Nervous system, testis, fallopian tube, thyroid glandaUbiquitously distributed to some extent (see supplemental Fig. S1).TTLL2TestisTTLL3Uterus, fallopian tube, ovary, smooth muscleTTLL4Nervous system, muscle, bone marrowaUbiquitously distributed to some extent (see supplemental Fig. S1).TTLL5Testis, spinal cordTTLL6Testis, intestineTTLL7Nervous systemTTLL8—bProbe set was not present.TTLL9NDcND, not determined (expression intensities were under the detection threshold).TTLL10NDTTLL11Muscle, bone marrowaUbiquitously distributed to some extent (see supplemental Fig. S1).TTLL12Esophagus, colonaUbiquitously distributed to some extent (see supplemental Fig. S1).TTLL13NDa Ubiquitously distributed to some extent (see supplemental Fig. S1).b Probe set was not present.c ND, not determined (expression intensities were under the detection threshold). Open table in a new tab TTLL7 Is a Tubulin Polyglutamylase with Specificity for β-Tubulin—To investigate whether TTLL7 has properties of a tubulin polyglutamylase, we purified bacterially expressed recombinant mouse TTLL7 (mTTLL7) and examined it for ligase activity by measurement of its ability to incorporate [H3]glutamate into tubulin in vitro. Purified recombinant mTTLL7 catalyzed [H3]glutamate incorporation into microtubules in vitro (Fig. 2A). The preferred substrate for enzyme activity was β-tubulin rather than α-tubulin (Fig. 2A), suggesting that this protein is a β-tubulin-selective polyglutamylase in vivo. In contrast, a mutated (E349V) form of mTTLL7, which is predicted to lack the ability to bind magnesium ion co-factor (13Janke C. Rogowski K. Wloga D. Regnard C. Kajava A.V. Strub J.M. Temurak N. van Dijk J. Boucher D. van Dorsselaer A. Suryavanshi S. Gaertig J. Eddé B. Science. 2005; 308: 1758-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), lost all enzyme activity (Fig. 2A). To investigate the enzyme activity of TTLL7 in vivo, we expressed FLAG-tagged mTTLL7 in HEK293T cells and analyzed polyglutamylated tubulin by Western blotting using the GT335 monoclonal antibody that has preferential specificity for polyglutamylated tubulin (7Wolff A. de Néchaud B. Chillet D. Mazarguil H. Desbruyères E. Audebert S. Eddé B. Gros F. Denoulet P. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 59: 425-532PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with the results of the in vitro analysis, expression of mTTLL7 in HEK293T cells caused a prominent increase in polyglutamylated β-tubulin but not α-tubulin (Fig. 2B). Total amounts of α- and β-tubulin were not altered by overproduction of mTTLL7 (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that TTLL7 functions as a β-tubulin-specific polyglutamylase. Consistent with the function of TTLL7 as a β-tubulin polyglutamylase, overproduction of EGFP-fused mTTLL7 lead to an increase in polyglutamylated microtubules in PtK2 cells (Fig. 2C). Tubulins and nucleosome assembly proteins (NAPs) are currently the only reported substrates for polyglutamylation (23Regnard C. Desbruyères E. Huet J.C. Beauvallet C. Pernollet J.C. Eddé B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15969-15976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To investigate the substrate specificity of TTLL7, we used the known cross-reactivity of GT335 for glutamylated forms of proteins other than tubulins, e.g. NAPs. Many additional proteins could be detected when the film was exposed for a prolonged period to the GT335-probed blot (Fig. 2D). However, other than β-tubulin, overexpression of mTTLL7 in HEK293T cells did not generate any GT335-specific band that was not also observed in untransfected negative control cells (Fig. 2D). We also investigated whether TTLL7 could glutamylate NAP1 by co-expression of both mTTLL7 and mNAP1 in HEK293T cells. GT335 reacted with exogenously overproduced mNAP1, indicating that this protein is glutamylated by endogenous polyglutamylase enzyme(s) in these cells. Overproduction of the mutant form of TTLL7, in which Glu at 349 was replaced"

Through evolution, cells have developed specialized multifunctional proteins that mediate the cross-linking of these cytoskeleton filament networks. Here we test the hypothesis that two of these filamentous proteins, F-actin and vimentin filament, can interact directly, i.e. in the absence of auxiliary proteins. Through quantitative rheological studies, we find that a mixture of vimentin/actin filament network features a significantly higher stiffness than that of networks containing only actin filaments or only vimentin filaments. Maximum inter-filament interaction occurs at a vimentin/actin molar ratio of 3 to 1. Mixed networks of actin and tailless vimentin filaments show low mechanical stiffness and much weaker inter-filament interactions. Together with the fact that cells featuring prominent vimentin and actin networks are much stiffer than their counterparts lacking an organized actin or vimentin network, these results suggest that actin and vimentin filaments can interact directly through the tail domain of vimentin and that these inter-filament interactions may contribute to the overall mechanical integrity of cells and mediate cytoskeletal cross-talk.

Microfilaments (F-actin), 2The abbreviations used are: F-actin, filamentous actin; IF, intermediate filament; FL, full-length; ΔT, tailless; EM, electron microscopy. microtubules, and intermediate filaments (IFs) form extended networks that constitute the cytoskeleton and work in concert to drive dynamic cellular processes, including locomotion and division, and contribute greatly to the mechanical integrity of the cell (1Chang L.

The spatial organizations of these networks share a mutual interdependence: the disassembly of one network by pharmacological treatments often affects the organization of another (3Croop J.

When IF assembly or organization is disrupted, the F-actin network is re-organized, whereas microtubule organization remains largely unaffected (9McCormick M.B. Kouklis P. Syder A. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 395-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the IF network collapses following microtubule disassembly and re-organizes upon actin depolymerization (3Croop J. Holtzer H. J.

Despite indirect evidence, it remains unclear whether major cytoskeleton filamentous proteins can interact directly, i.e. without auxiliary proteins. IFs play a central role in helping cells resist mechanical stresses, maintaining the mechanical integrity of cells (20Hutton E. Paladini R.D. Yu Q.C. Yen M. Coulombe P.A. Fuchs E. J.

Vimentin (57 KDa) is a type III IF found predominantly in cells of mesenchymal origin and a number of epithelial cell lines (23Freshney R.I. Culture of Animal Cells.

Vimentin plays key roles in cell migration (27Chu Y.W. Runyan R.B. Oshima R.G. Hendrix M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Motil. 2002; 23: 535-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence microscopy indicates that vimentin structures colocalize with microfilaments and actin-containing structures (10Cary R.B. Klymkowsky M.W. Evans R.M. Domingo A. Dent J.A. Backhus L.E. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1609-1622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Shah J.V. Wang L.Z. Traub P. Janmey P.A. Biol.

Cell Sci. 1989; 92: 621-631Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been speculated that this apparent interaction may be mediated through the tail domain of vimentin (10Cary R.B. Klymkowsky M.W. Evans R.M. Domingo A. Dent J.A. Backhus L.E. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1609-1622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but no evidence supports a direct interaction between actin and vimentin filaments. This may be in part due to the fact that traditional biochemical assays as well as light and electron microscopy are ill-suited to functionally test filament-filament interactions. The tail domain of vimentin alone cannot form filaments (10Cary R.B. Klymkowsky M.W. Evans R.M. Domingo A. Dent J.A. Backhus L.E. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1609-1622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Herrmann H. Haner M. Brettel M. Muller S.A. Goldie K.N. Fedtke B. Lustig A. Franke W.W. Aebi U. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 933-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), but it interacts with its rod domain (35Kouklis P.D. Papamarcaki T. Merdes A. Georgatos S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 773-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The role of the IF tail domain in organizing vimentin and potentially F-actin networks is somewhat unclear. In vitro, the assembly and network formation of tailless (ΔT) vimentin filaments only appear compromised when there are mutations in the rod domain (9McCormick M.B. Kouklis P. Syder A. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 395-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), whereas the ability of transfected vimentin to enter the nucleus is affected by its tail (36Rogers K.R. Eckelt A. Nimmrich V. Janssen K.P. Schliwa M. Herrmann H. Franke W.W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 66: 136-150PubMed Google Scholar, 37Eckelt A. Herrmann H. Franke W.W. Eur. J.

Freudenmann M. Stumpp S. Franke W.W. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1293-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) have been shown to migrate into the nucleus of some cell lines, although this is not the case for human tailless vimentin, which does not migrate into the nucleus under similar conditions (36Rogers K.R. Eckelt A. Nimmrich V. Janssen K.P. Schliwa M. Herrmann H. Franke W.W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 66: 136-150PubMed Google Scholar). These different cellular processes seem to rely on either direct or indirect interactions between vimentin and actin filament networks (10Cary R.B. Klymkowsky M.W. Evans R.M. Domingo A. Dent J.A. Backhus L.E. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1609-1622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Hollenbeck P.J. Bershadsky A.D. Pletjushkina O.Y. Tint I.S. Vasiliev J.M. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 92: 621-631Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, using purified proteins, we test the hypothesis that vimentin and actin filaments interact directly with each other to produce structures that are stiffer than the two individual networks they are made of. Like actin, vimentin can be assembled into filamentous structures upon addition of a polymerizing salt (39Herrmann H. Kreplak L. Aebi U. Methods Cell Biol. 2004; 78: 3-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Exploiting this property, actin and vimentin were polymerized simultaneously in the same buffer to form a mixed filamentous network. Using quantitative rheometry, we measured the elasticity and viscosity of the resulting mixed networks of actin and vimentin filaments. The mechanical response of vimentin filament networks in the presence and absence of F-actin was assessed as a function of the protein composition of the mixed network, as well as the frequency and the amplitude of applied shear deformations (40Tseng Y. An K.M. Esue O. Wirtz D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1819-1826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Our results show that a network containing both vimentin and actin filaments at a molar ratio of 3 to 1 displays an elasticity that is significantly higher and less frequency-dependent than the elasticity of networks containing only F-actin or vimentin filaments. ΔT vimentin, which assembles into filamentous structures of morphology similar to that formed by full-length (FL) vimentin, completely abrogates this synergistic effect. This suggests that the tail domain mediates a direct inter-filament interaction between vimentin IF and F-actin. Together with the fact that cells featuring prominent vimentin and F-actin networks are much stiffer than their counterparts lacking an organized F-actin network or vimentin network (41Trickey W.R. Vail T.P. Guilak F. J. Orthop. Res. 2004; 22: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 42Eckes B. Dogic D. Colucci-Guyon E. Wang N. Maniotis A. Ingber D. Merckling A. Langa F. Aumailley M. Delouvee A. Koteliansky V. Babinet C. Krieg T. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1897-1907Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), our results in vitro suggest that the mechanical synergy between actin and vimentin filaments is mediated by the tail domain of vimentin and may contribute to the overall mechanical response of cells and cytoskeletal cross-talk. Protein Purification—The purifications of human vimentin, ΔT vimentin, and the tail domain of vimentin are based on published protocols (10Cary R.B. Klymkowsky M.W. Evans R.M. Domingo A. Dent J.A. Backhus L.E. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1609-1622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Eckelt A. Herrmann H. Franke W.W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 58: 319-330PubMed Google Scholar, 39Herrmann H. Kreplak L. Aebi U. Methods Cell Biol. 2004; 78: 3-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Human vimentin, ΔT vimentin, and vimentin tail cDNAs were generous gifts from R. D. Goldman (Northwestern University Medical School), H. Herrmann (Institute of Cell and Tumor Biology, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg), and M. W. Klymkowsky (University of Colorado, Boulder), respectively. Vimentin was dialyzed in a stepwise manner out of urea-containing buffer into 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol. Actin was prepared from chicken breast (43Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with an extra step of gel filtration by Sephacryl S-300 (Sigma) (44Xu J. Wirtz D. Pollard T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9570-9576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Purified actin was stored as Ca2+-actin in continuous dialysis at 4 °C against buffer G (0.2 mm ATP, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm sodium azide, and 2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). In Vitro Filament Assembly—For assembly, both actin and vimentin were dialyzed into storage buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm sodium azide). Filaments were generated by adding 0.1 volume of 10× TKMEI (0.2 m Tris-HCl, 0.5 m KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 100 mm imidazole, pH 7.0) polymerizing salt to 0.9 volume of unpolymerized protein in storage buffer. Rheology—The mechanical properties of networks of actin and vimentin filaments were measured using a strain-controlled, 50-mm diameter cone-and-plate rheometer (ARES-100, TA Instruments, New Castle, DE) (45Esue O. Tseng Y. Wirtz D. Phys. Rev. Lett. 2005; 95: 048301Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 46Xu J. Tseng Y. Wirtz D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35886-35892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Shear deformations of controlled amplitude and frequency were applied by precise dynamic rotations of the lower plate of the rheometer. The upper cone of the rheometer is coupled to a computer-controlled motor, which applies either steady or oscillatory shear deformations of controlled frequency and amplitude. The cone is connected to a torque transducer, which measures the stress induced in the protein solutions by the applied shear deformations. The gelation of the filament networks was monitored by measuring the time-dependent elasticity. Elasticity was measured by applying two oscillatory deformations of 1% amplitude at a frequency of 1 rad/s every 120 s until a steady state was attained (∼1–3 h). At steady state, the frequency-dependent viscoelastic moduli of the filament networks, G′(ω) and G″(ω), were computed by dividing the in-phase and out-of-phase components of the measured oscillatory stress induced within the network by the applied strain amplitude. The phase angle, δ = tan–1(G″/G′) was also calculated. Next, oscillatory deformations of small amplitude (1%) and frequency between 0.01 and 100 rad/s were applied to measure simultaneously the frequency-dependent elastic modulus, G′(ω), and frequency-dependent viscous modulus, G″(ω), of the filament networks. Finally, deformations of fixed frequency (1 rad/s) and amplitude between 0.1 and 1000% were applied to measure the elastic and viscous moduli as a function of the amplitude of the input shear deformation, g0. The statistical significance between moduli of networks of different protein composition was verified by pairwise comparison using the Student's t test, which yielded values of p < 0.05. Electron Microscopy—The ultrastructure of negatively stained vimentin and actin filaments was examined by electron microscopy. Polymerizing vimentin and actin solutions were incubated in assembly buffer (25 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4) obtained by mixing 1 volume of polymerizing buffer to 9 volumes of storage buffer. 10 μl of protein solution was placed on each collodion-coated electron microscopic grid. Grids were washed with assembly buffer and stained with 2% uranyl acetate solution (47Tseng Y. Fedorov E. McCaffery J.M. Almo S.C. Wirtz D. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 351-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Electron microscopy was performed at the Integrated Imaging Center in Johns Hopkins University with a Philips 410 transmission electron microscope at magnifications between 65,000× and 105,000×, as indicated in the figure captions. Actin and Vimentin Filaments Interact Directly—We hypothesized that vimentin and actin filaments interact directly, i.e. without auxiliary proteins, forming structures that are stiffer than the two networks they are made of. Exploiting the unique assembly properties of vimentin among IFs, we co-polymerized vimentin and actin filaments in the same buffer, and monitored the viscoelastic properties of the mixed networks. Using a cone-and-plate rheometer, the elastic modulus, G′ (which measures the propensity of the polymers to rebound after shear deformation), and the viscous modulus, G″ (which measures how much the specimen can flow under stress), of the protein solutions were measured upon onset of filament assembly. The relative concentration of vimentin and actin was varied for a total protein concentration of 24 μm. The steady-state elastic modulus for the mixed filament networks reached a distinct maximum in stiffness of G′∼ 40 dyn/cm2 for [actin] = 6 μm and [vimentin] = 18 μm, compared with 6 dyn/cm2 fora24 μm F-actin network (no vimentin present) and 15 dyn/cm2 for a 24 μm vimentin filament network (no actin present) (Fig. 1, A and B). Therefore, a mixed filament network containing one-fourth actin and three-fourths vimentin was stiffer than the networks containing only F-actin or only vimentin filaments. Vimentin filament networks in the absence of actin displayed a low phase angle, δ ∼ 5° (Fig. 1C), which corresponds to a solid-like rheological behavior, close to that displayed by a stiff rubber. The phase angle describes the delay between the imposed (input) deformation and the measured (output) mechanical stress induced by that deformation in the network. This delay is minimum (0°) for an elastic solid-like rubber and maximum (90°) for a viscous liquid-like glycerol. As the actin-to-vimentin molar ratio increased, mixed vimentin/actin networks became significantly more liquid-like, reaching a phase angle of ∼30° for an F-actin network containing no vimentin (Fig. 1C). Through electron micrographs of negatively stained suspensions of either pure F-actin or pure vimentin filament network, we verified that the present buffer conditions did not affect their normal morphology. EM was also used to examine the structures formed by the copolymerization of actin and vimentin (Fig. 1D). Analysis of micrographs of individual filaments in mixed vimentin/actin filament networks resulted in a distribution of filament diameters with two narrow peaks confirming the presence of separate actin and vimentin filaments within the network. The mean ± S.D. values of the distributions were 7.7 ± 1.4 nm and 10.8 ± 2.2 nm, which correspond to the known diameters of actin and vimentin filaments, respectively. Therefore, each filament in the mixed filament networks contained only one type of subunit. Dynamic Response of Vimentin/Actin Filament Networks—For a fixed polymer length and polymer concentration, the mobility of filaments in a network depends mostly on their potential to interact through cross-linking interactions (48Ferry, J. D. (1980) John Wiley and Sons, New YorkGoogle Scholar). To assess the extent of mobility of the filaments within entangled vimentin/actin filament networks, these networks were subjected to shear deformations of increasing frequency. The elastic modulus of F-actin networks (no vimentin present) increased steadily with increasing rates of shear, i.e. with increasing shear frequency (Fig. 2A). This result indicates that actin filaments had progressively less time to relax the mechanical stress imposed by the rheometer for increasing rates of shear rates. However, by reducing actin concentration and increasing vimentin concentration in mixed networks, we observed a significantly reduced frequency dependence of the elastic modulus (Fig. 2A). This indicates that filaments in mixed vimentin/actin filament networks became less mobile than in networks containing only F-actin. Therefore, these mixed filament networks were less capable of relaxing mechanical stresses, presumably due to enhanced interactions between actin and vimentin filaments (Fig. 2A). These frequency-dependent elasticity profiles (Fig. 2A) could be fit approximately to power laws of the type G′(ω) ∼ ωa, with an exponent a that describes the steepness of the frequency dependence of G′(ω). The exponent a increased for increasing actin content in mixed networks, which suggests that there was more relative movements among filaments in actin-rich networks than in vimentin-rich networks (Fig. 2B). The Tail Domain of Vimentin Mediates Interactions between Vimentin and Actin Filaments—We hypothesized that the tail domain of vimentin mediates the synergistic enhancement of elasticity observed in mixed vimentin/actin filament networks. Therefore we repeated our rheological assays for mixed suspensions of actin and ΔT vimentin filaments. The steady-state elastic modulus of networks containing both actin and ΔT vimentin filaments decreased as the molar ratio of actin to vimentin in the mixture increased. However, unlike their FL vimentin/actin filament network counterparts, the relative elastic modulus (G′/G′vim = 24μm) of ΔT vimentin/actin filament networks displayed no distinct maximum for an intermediate protein composition (Fig. 3A). Moreover, the higher phase angle value of the networks suggested that actin and ΔT vimentin filaments formed more liquid-like networks compared with actin and FL vimentin filaments over the same concentration range (Fig. 3B). We further tested whether the absence of mechanical synergy between ΔT vimentin and actin filaments correlated with diminished inter-filament interactions by analyzing the frequency-dependent elasticity, G′(ω). Although the exponent a from power-law fits of G′(ω) also increased with actin concentration, it was higher in the presence of ΔT vimentin than in the presence of FL vimentin (Fig. 3C). This suggests that ΔT vimentin allowed significantly more inter-filament sliding in mixed networks than their FL vimentin counterparts. EM studies did not show ultrastructural differences between FL vimentin/actin and ΔT vimentin/actin filament networks (Fig. 3D). Hence the observed difference in the mechanical response of mixed filament protein networks is probably due to direct interactions between vimentin and actin filaments (Fig. 3). Binding studies showed an interaction between F-actin and the tail domain of vimentin (supplemental Fig. S1). We evaluated the binding kinetics of vimentin tails to F-actin using a pelletting assay (49Wachsstock D.H. Schwartz W.H. Pollard T.D. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Solutions of actin monomers of fixed concentration were mixed with various concentrations of vimentin tails before initiating actin filament assembly. The pellet recovered from a high speed centrifugation of the polymerized proteins was analyzed on SDS-gel electrophoresis, and the concentration of free (unbound) tails in the supernatant was measured. Analysis of the Coomassie-stained protein gels showed the presence of actin and vimentin tails in the pellet. A fit of the binding curve using nonlinear regression (supplemental Fig. S1) yielded an equilibrium dissociation constant, kd, of ∼13.8 μm, indicative of weak binding between F-actin and the tail domain of vimentin. The Mechanical Properties of ΔT and FL Vimentin Filaments Are Similar—The tail domain of vimentin does not affect vimentin assembly in vitro and in vivo (34Herrmann H. Haner M. Brettel M. Muller S.A. Goldie K.N. Fedtke B. Lustig A. Franke W.W. Aebi U. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 933-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 37Eckelt A. Herrmann H. Franke W.W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 58: 319-330PubMed Google Scholar), hence we hypothesized that it would have negligible effects on the mechanical properties of vimentin networks. We compared the mechanical properties of FL and ΔT vimentin filament networks. EM studies showed that both FL vimentin and ΔT vimentin formed filaments of similar morphology (Fig. 4) (34Herrmann H. Haner M. Brettel M. Muller S.A. Goldie K.N. Fedtke B. Lustig A. Franke W.W. Aebi U. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 933-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). There was a negligible difference in elastic moduli of both FL and ΔT vimentin filament networks (no actin present) over the tested concentration range (Fig. 4A). The elastic moduli of both networks increased weakly with protein concentration, C, scaling as G′(C) ∼ C0.37, and G′(C) ∼ C0.35 (estimated at a frequency of 1 rad/s), for FL and ΔT vimentin, respectively. Polymer theory suggests that this concentration dependence is consistent with cross-linked flexible filaments (50Palmer A. Xu J. Kuo S.C. Wirtz D. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 1063-1071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The value of the phase angle also suggested that both networks harbored a strong solid-like character, with FL vimentin being slightly stiffer that ΔT vimentin (Fig. 4B). As the networks gelled, we tested the mobility of FL and ΔT vimentin filaments in networks, by exposing the networks to shear deformations of increasing frequency ω before a steady-state elasticity was reached (Fig. 5, A and B). The frequency-dependent gelation profiles were fit to power laws, G′(ω) ∼ ωa, and an exponent a was extracted from the plots shown in Fig. 5 (A and B). The measured value of the exponent a indicated that inter-filament interactions were similar for both FL and ΔT vimentin networks. Although a was slightly lower for FL vimentin (0.12 ± 0.01) than for ΔT vimentin (0.16 ± 0.01) filament networks (mean ± S.D.), they had a parallel downwards trend, which indicated that inter-filament interactions grew stronger with time. Together these results suggest that networks of ΔT vimentin filaments have mechanical properties similar to those of networks of FL vimentin filaments. By subjecting vimentin filament networks to increasing strain amplitudes, we found that the amplitude of the deformation at which vimentin networks began to yield and break down (point where the elastic modulus dropped by 10% of its original value) was independent of vimentin concentration (data not shown). Unlike keratin IF 5/14 network, whose mechanical resilience is significantly affected when keratin-14 tail domain is truncated (51Bousquet O. Ma L. Yamada S. Gu C. Idei T. Takahashi K. Wirtz D. Coulombe P.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 747-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), the truncation of the tail domain of vimentin did not affect the mechanical resilience of its network. Moreover, FL and ΔT vimentin filaments formed networks of similar ultrastructures, as assessed by EM and negative staining (Fig. 5C). The three major cytoskeleton proteins (F-actin, microtubule, and IF) form networks that are mutually affected by the re-organization or disassembly of any one of them. Immunofluorescence microscopy shows that FL vimentin and the vimentin tail localize near actin networks in cells, suggesting an interaction between vimentin and actin filaments mediated by the tail domain of vimentin (10Cary R.B. Klymkowsky M.W. Evans R.M. Domingo A. Dent J.A. Backhus L.E. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1609-1622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, this interaction could be indirect, i.e. mediated by auxiliary proteins. We report the strongest evidence yet of a direct interaction between two of the three major cytoskeletal networks, vimentin and actin, which has remarkable effects on their network mechanical features. Actin and vimentin are copolymerized simultaneously and the viscoelasticity of the resulting filament networks is assessed by quantitative rheology. Unlike mixed IF proteins (e.g. desmin and vimentin (52Wickert U. Mucke N. Wedig T. Muller S.A. Aebi U. Herrmann H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 84: 379-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar)), which can form filaments containing both subunits, mixed actin and vimentin networks contain filaments with only one type of subunit. The mixed vimentin/actin filament network displays an elasticity that does not uniformly interpolate between the elasticity of networks of pure F-actin and that of pure vimentin IF. Analysis of the rheology measurements shows that a maximum in network stiffness occurs at an actin:vimentin ratio of 1:3 and that the tail domain of vimentin mediates inter-filament interactions between F-actin and filamentous vimentin. A binding assay showed that the vimentin tail binds F-actin with a Kd of ∼14 μm. This equilibrium dissociation constant is relatively high, but similar to dissociation constants of the cross-linking protein α-actinin for F-actin (44Xu J. Wirtz D. Pollard T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9570-9576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Like other F-actin cross-linking proteins, vimentin does not require a high affinity for F-actin. Indeed, the interactions between F-actin and vimentin tails are multiplied by the high number of entanglements formed between each vimentin filament and the actin filaments in a dense network. These entanglements, reinforced by direct interactions between vimentin tails and actin filaments, prevent easy sliding of vimentin filaments when the network is under mechanical stress. This inhibited filament movement induces a high network elasticity, higher than in networks of actin and tailless vimentin filaments, which do not interact directly with each other. In the absence of mutations in the rod domain, ΔT vimentin assembles into filaments that appear identical to those formed by FL vimentin (9McCormick M.B. Kouklis P. Syder A. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 395-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), as assessed by conventional electron microscopy. However, there are also reports that tailless vimentin filaments are slightly thicker than FL vimentin filaments (34Herrmann H. Haner M. Brettel M. Muller S.A. Goldie K.N. Fedtke B. Lustig A. Franke W.W. Aebi U. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 933-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In vivo, the presence of the tail domain of vimentin appears to affect its ability of transfected Xenopus vimentin to localize inside the nucleus of cells (36Rogers K.R. Eckelt A. Nimmrich V. Janssen K.P. Schliwa M. Herrmann H. Franke W.W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 66: 136-150PubMed Google Scholar, 37Eckelt A. Herrmann H. Franke W.W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 58: 319-330PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that, within the cell, the tail domain could affect the organization of vimentin. In many cell types, IFs appear to align more preferably with microtubules than with actin structures, presumably due to stronger interactions between microtubules and IFs (10Cary R.B. Klymkowsky M.W. Evans R.M. Domingo A. Dent J.A. Backhus L.E. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1609-1622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, isolated vimentin tails colocalize with actin networks and not with microtubule networks, which suggests that vimentin tails have a higher affinity for F-actin structures and that microtubule-IF interaction is not mediated by the IF tail domain. Scanning transmission EM of unstained intermediate filaments (including keratin, vimentin, and desmin) reveals that IFs have filament widths of ∼16 nm, which is larger than the 10 nm filament width measured using conventional heavy metal stain EM (53Engel A. Eichner R. Aebi U. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1985; 90: 323-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 54Steven A.C. Hainfeld J.F. Trus B.L. Wall J.S. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8323-8329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cary et al. (10Cary R.B. Klymkowsky M.W. Evans R.M. Domingo A. Dent J.A. Backhus L.E. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1609-1622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) propose that the excess 6 nm is possibly occupied by the head and tail domain, which projects out of the central axis of its filament. The hypothesized projection of nonhelical IF tails is similar to the observed projection of neurofilaments tails of their NF-H and NF-M subunits (55Hisanaga S. Hirokawa N. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 202: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Antibodies against NF-H and NF-M subunits localize to the peripheral as well as cross-bridges of NFs (56Hisanaga S. Hirokawa N. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 959-966Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 57Hirokawa N. Glicksman M.A. Willard M.B. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 1523-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 58Willard M. Simon C. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 89: 198-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Bousquet et al. (51Bousquet O. Ma L. Yamada S. Gu C. Idei T. Takahashi K. Wirtz D. Coulombe P.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 747-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) also showed that the nonhelical tail domain of keratin K14 facilitates lateral filament association with keratin filaments forming bundles in vivo and gives the structures high mechanical attributes. These putative outward projecting vimentin tails may display the proper orientation to promote strong interactions with F-actin. Another mechanism of synergistic interaction between actin and vimentin filaments could be that the tails mediate electrostatic interactions that would influence the overall mechanical properties of mixed actin and vimentin filament networks. These observations together with our results suggest a direct interaction between F-actin and vimentin filaments mediated by the tail domain of vimentin, which results in an enhanced elasticity of mixed vimentin/actin filament in networks. For a constant protein concentration, polymer theory predicts that the elasticity of a polymer network depends weakly on the intrinsic rigidity of the filaments (i.e. their persistence length) and depends mostly on inter-filament interactions between filaments. Increasing the rate of shear on a network interrogates the ability of filaments within the network to slide past one another. Actin filaments slide past each other much more readily than vimentin filaments. In further support of strong inter-filament interactions, vimentin structures also exhibit a low phase angle (e.g. the phase angle of water is 90°, whereas that of rubber is 0°) compared with F-actin. On the other hand, actin forms filament networks with a higher phase angle that decreases as the ratio of vimentin within the network increases. Vimentin assemble into filaments with or without their tail domain, which suggests that vimentin assembly is not mediated by its tail. The elastic modulus of FL vimentin filament networks is not significantly higher in the absence of its tail, which implies that vimentin network elasticity does not stem from the interaction of its tail. This indicates that our observed enhanced stiffness of FL vimentin/actin filament networks does not simply stem from enhanced content in FL vimentin filaments in mixed networks. Our study does not identify the vimentin-binding domain of F-actin, but our data strongly suggest that there is a direct interaction between the tail domain of vimentin and F-actin, which mediates a significant enhancement of the mechanical properties of mixed actin/vimentin filament networks compared with networks containing only F-actin or only vimentin.

https://openalex.org/W2005125317,"Segmentation genes in insects are required for generating the subdivisions of the early embryo. We describe here a new member of the gap family of segmentation genes in the flour beetle Tribolium, mille-pattes (mlpt). mlpt knockdown leads to transformation of the abdominal segments into thoracic segments, providing embryos with up to ten pairs of legs. We show that there are crossregulatory interactions between mlpt and the known gap genes in Tribolium, suggesting that mlpt is itself a gap gene. The mlpt gene reveals an unusual structure, as it encodes a polycistronic mRNA that codes for four peptides. mlpt appears to be the prototype of this previously unknown gene structure in eukaryotes, as we find homologous genes with the same polycistronic arrangement in other insect genomes as well."

Such altered receptor function (including increased inhibition by zinc and lack of modulation by benzodiazepines) is related, in part, to changes in the mRNA levels of certain GABAAR subunits, including α4, and may play a role in epileptogenesis. The majority of GABAARs that contain α4 subunits are extra-synaptic due to lack of the γ2 subunit and presence of δ. However, it has been hypothesized that seizure activity may result in expression of synaptic receptors with altered properties driven by an increased pool of α4 subunits. Results of our previous work suggests that signaling via protein kinase C (PKC) and early growth response factor 3 (Egr3) is the plasticity trigger for aberrant α4 subunit gene (GABRA4) expression after status epilepticus. We now report that brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is the endogenous signal that induces Egr3 expression via a PKC/MAPK-dependent pathway. Taken together with the fact that blockade of tyrosine kinase (Trk) neurotrophin receptors reduces basal GABRA4 promoter activity by 50%, our findings support a role for BDNF as the mediator of Egr3-induced GABRA4 regulation in developing neurons and epilepsy and, moreover, suggest that BDNF may alter inhibitory processing in the brain by regulating the balance between phasic and tonic inhibition.

Alteration in the function of GABAARs has been associated with a variety of diseases whose etiology leads to an imbalance between inhibition and excitation in specific populations of neurons (6Brooks-Kayal A.R.

For instance, changes in certain GABAAR subunit levels occur in dentate granule cells (DGCs) of both humans with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and in animal models of TLE (6Brooks-Kayal A.R.

These molecular responses have been hypothesized to underlie persistent changes in GABAAR function associated with epileptogenesis. Most notably, individual DGCs display an elevation of α4 subunit mRNAs and a decrease in α1 (6Brooks-Kayal A.R. Shumate M.D. Jin H. Rikhter T.Y. Coulter D.A. Nat.

Michel C. Mohler H. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 806-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In addition, the majority of GABAARs that contain α4 subunits (co-assembled with a β and δ) are located extrasynaptically and mediate tonic GABA currents, while those containing α(1, 2, 3, or 5) without δ and with γ2 are targeted to the synapse (1Rabow L.E.

Assembly of an α, β, and γ2 subunit is also necessary for the pharmacological response to classical benzodiazepines but such a response is absent when α4 is present. Recent data from our laboratory shows that seizure-induced transcriptional up-regulation of the α4 subunit gene (GABRA4) is regulated through the protein kinase C (PKC) pathway and specifically through binding of the inducible early growth response factor 3 (Egr3) (10Roberts D.S.

Neuroscience. 2004; 126: 665-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), we used cultured primary hippocampal neurons to determine whether BDNF could be the seizure-induced signal that up-regulates GABRA4 transcription and down-regulates GABRA1. Primary Neuronal Cell Culture—Primary hippocampal neurons were cultured from prenatal day 18 Sprague-Dawley rats (E18) (Charles River Laboratories) as described previously (22Xia Z. Dudek H. Miranti C.K. Greenberg M.E. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5425-5436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Russek S.J. Bandyopadhyay S. Farb D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8600-8605Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Drug Treatments—Drug treatments were performed for Western blotting, promoter analysis, and real-time PCR experiments. Drugs were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) or water. Final vehicle concentration was 0.5% or less for all experiments. Drugs were diluted to 20 μl in warm conditioned media and added to each dish. Cultures were treated with signaling inhibitors and returned to the incubator for 1 h. Cultures were then treated with signaling activators. Following activation, cultures were harvested at variable time intervals ranging from 45 min to 24 h after treatment. For treatments with the MAPK inhibitor (MEK1/MEK2), the following final concentration was utilized: U0126 (Calbiochem, catalog number 662006, 20 μm). The general PKC inhibitor calphostin C (Calbiochem, catalog number 208725) was used a final concentration of 1 μm. The TrK signaling inhibitor (K252a, Calbiochem, catalog number 420298) was used as a final concentration of 200 nm. Treatment with the signaling activators phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (Sigma, 1 μm) and BDNF (Calbiochem, catalog number 203702, 50 ng/ml) were also utilized. Sister control dishes received vehicle (Me2SO or H20) during the pretreatment and treatment phases. Transient Transfection Studies—Primary cultures in 6-well dishes (Nunc) were transfected using a modified calcium phosphate precipitation method (22Xia Z. Dudek H. Miranti C.K. Greenberg M.E. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5425-5436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Russek S.J. Bandyopadhyay S. Farb D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8600-8605Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Eight micrograms of total DNA was transfected into each well of a 6-well dish for studies that accessed reporter activity (GABRA4) after drug treatment. Vectors containing 500 bases of the 5′-flanking sequence specific to GABRA4 were cloned upstream of the luciferase reporter gene in the pGL2 vector (Promega) (10Roberts D.S. Raol Y.H. Bandyopadhyay S. Lund I.V. Budreck E.C. Passini M.A. Passini M.J. Wolfe J.H. Brooks-Kayal A.R. Russek S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 11894-11899Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Promoter fragments confers full promoter activity in primary hippocampal or neocortical neurons, respectively. Luciferase reporter activity was monitored using the cell culture lysis Reagent and luciferase substrate (Promega) and a Victor 1420 detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Luciferase counts were normalized to protein within each dish. Western Blot Analysis—Whole cell lysates (10 μg) were electrophoresed on 10% Tris-glycine gels (Novex) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked in 2% nonfat dry milk (Carnation)/40 ml of TBS-T (20 mm Tris base, 137 mm NaCl, pH 7.6, 0.1% Tween) for 1 h or overnight. Nitrocellulose membranes were probed with antibodies to α4or α1 (Novus 1:1000), β-actin (1:30,000; Sigma), Egr3 (1:500; gift of J. Baraban) and secondary antibodies anti-rabbit IgG HRP (1:2000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-2030) or anti-mouse IgG HRP (1:30,000; Vector Laboratories). Real-time PCR for Gene Expression Analysis—PCR primers were designed using primer express software (PE Biosystems). Primer sets for Egr3 and BDNF were the following sequences: Egr3, Fwd 5′-GAGATCCCCAGCGCGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CATCTGAGTGTAATGGGCTACCG-3′ (reverse); Egr3 Taqman, 5′-CAACCTCTTCTCCGGCAGCAGTGAC-3′. BDNF primers were purchased from Applied Biosystems (Rn00788315_m1). RNA extraction from cells in culture were performed from single wells of a 6-well dish. Cells were harvested using RNeasy Micro RNA extraction kit (Qiagen). For samples from the adult dentate gyrus, RNA was extracted using RNeasy Midi RNA extraction kit (Qiagen). Taqman one-step RT-PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) was used to generate cDNAs and to quantify mRNAs. Control probes for relative abundance of rRNA or cyclophilin were used in multiplex assays (Applied Biosystems) using the ABI7900HT (Applied Biosystems). Thermocycling conditions were as follows: 50 °C (30 min) 1 cycle, 95 °C (15 min) 1 cycle; 95 °C (15 s), 60 °C (1 min) 50 cycles. Standard curves were generated from control embryonic E18 rat brain RNA or control RNA from a control dentate gyrus. To account for loading error, mRNA values were normalized by dividing GABRA4 levels by rRNA or cyclophin levels. Protein Extraction—Protein extraction was performed with standard procedures and RIPA lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science, catalog number 11836153001), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Induction of Status Epilepticus—Adult rats were exposed to pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE) according to standard protocol (6Brooks-Kayal A.R. Shumate M.D. Jin H. Rikhter T.Y. Coulter D.A. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1166-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Pilocarpine injection triggered long duration (>30 min) seizures within 10–30 min after injection. Rats that did not exhibit behavioral seizures of class 3 or higher on the scale of Racine (24Racine R. Electroencephalogr. Clin. Neurophysiol. 1972; 32: 281-294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5754) Google Scholar) within 1 h of pilocarpine injection were injected with a second dose of pilocarpine (192.5 mg/kg intraperitoneal), as is standardly done in this model because equivalence is measured in seizure severity and not doses of pilocarpine. Diazepam (6 mg/kg intraperitoneal; Sigma) was administered 1 h after onset of SE to stop seizure activity and again every 2 h until rats stopped seizing completely. Control rats were treated identically to pilocarpine injected rats, except that a subconvulsive dose of pilocarpine (38.5 mg/kg) was administered. Statistical Analysis—Experimental values were determined by expressing values as a percentage of control values defined as 100 or 0%. Statistical significance was evaluated using a 95 or 99% confidence interval or by a Mann-Whitney test. Previous data from our laboratory show that Egr3 mRNA and protein levels are elevated in the dentate gyrus 24 h after pilocarpine-induced SE (10Roberts D.S. Raol Y.H. Bandyopadhyay S. Lund I.V. Budreck E.C. Passini M.A. Passini M.J. Wolfe J.H. Brooks-Kayal A.R. Russek S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 11894-11899Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Elevated levels result in enhanced binding of Egr3 to GABRA4 at a time when GABRA4 mRNAs are also elevated. To determine whether BDNF mRNA levels are also elevated at this time point, real-time PCR was conducted with RNA from either control animals or those animals who have undergone pilocarpine-induced SE. Consistent with several models of TLE (19Zafra F. Hengerer B. Leibrock J. Thoenen H. Lindholm D. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3545-3550Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar, 20Ernfors P. Bengzon J. Kokaia Z. Persson H. Lindvall O. Neuron. 1991; 7: 165-176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar, 21Poulsen F.R. Lauterborn J. Zimmer J. Gall C.M. Neuroscience. 2004; 126: 665-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), BDNF mRNAs are elevated by greater than 7-fold (Fig. 1A) at 24 h after onset of SE. We have previously demonstrated that activation of PKC/MAPK signaling leads to elevated binding of Egr3 to the endogenous GABRA4 promoter in hippocampal neurons using chromatin immunoprecipitation (10Roberts D.S. Raol Y.H. Bandyopadhyay S. Lund I.V. Budreck E.C. Passini M.A. Passini M.J. Wolfe J.H. Brooks-Kayal A.R. Russek S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 11894-11899Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). To determine whether these changes are due to elevated Egr3 expression and to determine whether BDNF can also alter Egr3 expression, cultures were treated with either BDNF or PMA for 45 min, 2 h, or 6 h. RNA was extracted and real-time PCR was performed. Stimulation with BDNF and PMA increases Egr3 mRNA levels at both 45 min and 2 h, with levels peaking at 45 min (Fig. 1B). Levels return to base line by 6 h after stimulation and remain at baseline for up to 24 h (data not shown). Maximal stimulation by either BDNF or PMA is blocked by the MEK inhibitor U0126 or the PKC inhibitor calphostin C (Fig. 1C). Changes in Egr3 mRNA levels are paralleled by changes in Egr3 protein after BDNF treatment. Similar to Egr3 mRNA levels, Egr3 protein is elevated by BDNF (Fig. 2). Egr3 levels increase by almost 3-fold 1 h after treatment. Levels are maximally elevated after 2 h (5-fold) and remain elevated for at least 6h. BDNF can stimulate MAPK/PKC pathways (25Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (1661) Google Scholar, 26Patapoutian A. Reichardt L.F. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 272-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar), and our previous work (10Roberts D.S. Raol Y.H. Bandyopadhyay S. Lund I.V. Budreck E.C. Passini M.A. Passini M.J. Wolfe J.H. Brooks-Kayal A.R. Russek S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 11894-11899Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) has shown that GABRA4 responds to PKC stimulation. To investigate whether BDNF can produce similar changes in α4 subunit levels that occur after PKC stimulation and whether such changes are accompanied by down-regulation of α1 as seen in the pilocarpine model (6Brooks-Kayal A.R. Shumate M.D. Jin H. Rikhter T.Y. Coulter D.A. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1166-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar), hippocampal cultures were treated with BDNF or vehicle for 6 or 24 h. Following BDNF treatment, cultures were then harvested and extracts were subjected to Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 3A, α4 subunit levels increase by 57% after 6 h of treatment and 120% after 24 h, while α1 subunit levels show no change at 6 h and decrease by 42% after 24 h. A representative Western blot is shown in Fig. 3B. To test the hypothesis that BDNF regulates α4 subunits through the up-regulation of GABRA4 transcription, primary hippocampal neurons were transfected with the GABRA4 promoter luciferase reporter construct. Eighteen hours after transfection, neurons were pretreated with a Trk receptor signaling inhibitor (K252a) for 1 h followed by a 6- or 12-h treatment with BDNF. Treatment with BDNF increases promoter activity by more than 50% after 12 h and activation is fully reversible by K252a (Fig. 3C). K252a alone reduces promoter activity to about 50% of base line. Changes in GABAAR subunit gene expression may play an important role in the etiology of TLE (27Coulter D.A. Epilepsia. 2000; 41: S96-S99Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In both animal models of TLE or in TLE patients, DGCs have elevated levels of GABAARs with distinct pharmacological properties (6Brooks-Kayal A.R. Shumate M.D. Jin H. Rikhter T.Y. Coulter D.A. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1166-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar, 28Buhl E.H. Otis T.S. Mody I. Science. 1996; 271: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 29Gibbs J.W. Shumate M.D. Coulter D.A. J. Neurophysiol. 1997; 77: 1924-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). These receptors are associated with a marked increase in α4 and decrease in α1 subunit gene expression (6Brooks-Kayal A.R. Shumate M.D. Jin H. Rikhter T.Y. Coulter D.A. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1166-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). We previously reported that elevated levels of α4 mRNAs and protein are due to binding of Egr3 to GARBA4 in cultured hippocampal neurons and that there are increased levels and increased association of Egr3 and GABRA4 in dentate gyrus of animals exposed to SE (10Roberts D.S. Raol Y.H. Bandyopadhyay S. Lund I.V. Budreck E.C. Passini M.A. Passini M.J. Wolfe J.H. Brooks-Kayal A.R. Russek S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 11894-11899Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Additionally, our data showed that activation of PKC signaling elevates α4 mRNA levels most likely through transcriptional regulation of endogenous GABRA4 by Egr3. We now report that BDNF is a likely mediator of GABRA4 expression in TLE through its stimulation of Egr3 mRNA and protein synthesis. Previous evidence has suggested a relationship between BDNF and the modulation of GABAAR receptor function. In primary hippocampal neurons, BDNF reduces GABAergic miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents and causes a reduction in GABAAR subunit α2, β(2,3), and γ2 immunoreactivity (31Brünig I. Penschuck S. Berninger B. Benson J. Fritschy J.M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2001; 13: 1320-1328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A role for BDNF has not been established in the regulation of GABRA4. We now show that BDNF increases α4 while decreasing α1 subunit levels in hippocampal neurons suggesting that the neurotrophin has the potential to differentially regulate the expression of extrasynaptic and synaptic GABAARs. Egr3 is a member of the early growth response (Egr) transcription factor family that includes four members (Egr1–4). Our data suggest that Egr3 mRNAs and protein are elevated in primary hippocampal neurons after BDNF treatment through PKC/MAPK activation. These changes are also seen after treatment with PMA, a drug known to activate both PKC and MAPK pathways. Our observations are consistent with those in nonneuronal systems where both Egr3 mRNA levels (32Mages H.W. Stamminger T. Rilke O. Bravo R. Kroczek R.A. Int. Immunol. 1993; 5: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and Egr3 promoter activity (33Mages H.W. Baag R. Steiner B. Kroczek R.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 7157-7165Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) are activated upon treatment with PMA. Egr3 mRNA and protein levels are also elevated in several animal models of TLE (34Yamagata K. Kaufmann W.E. Lanahan A. Papapavlou M. Barnes C.A. Andreasson K.I. Worley P.F. Learn Mem. 1994; 1: 140-152PubMed Google Scholar, 35O'Donovan K.J. Baraban J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4711-4718Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 36Honkaniemi J. Sharp F.R. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Taken together with our data, where the elevation of BDNF mRNA levels occurs before or at a time when Egr3 levels are also elevated, evidence suggests that BDNF is a likely endogenous regulator of Egr3 in response to SE. Elevated Egr3 levels after BDNF stimulation are also the likely mediator of increased α4 subunit levels in both cultured neurons and in DGCs of TLE animals. In addition to the observation that Egr3 knock-out mice lack muscle spindles, display sensory ataxia, resting tremor, and scoliosis (37Tourtellotte W.G. Milbrandt J. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), these animals also have around 50% less GABRA4 mRNAs in the hippocampus (9Peng Z. Huang C.S. Stell B.M. Mody I. Houser C.R. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 8629-8639Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Interestingly, regulation of GABRA4 by Egr3 appears to be context independent because overexpression of Egr3 increases GABRA4 mRNA levels by over 7-fold in non-neuronal primary myotubes (38Albert Y. Whitehead J. Eldredge L. Carter J. Gao X. Tourtellotte W.G. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 257-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) suggesting that Egr3 may override the neuron-specific expression of GABRA4. BDNF has received attention as a putative regulator of epileptogenesis (39Koyama R. Ikegaya Y. Neuroscientist. 2005; 11: 282-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Intrahippocampal infusion of BDNF can cause spontaneous limbic seizures (40Scharfman H.E. Goodman J.H. Sollas A.L. Croll S.D. Exp. Neurol. 2002; 174: 201-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), and one controversial hypothesis is that BDNF may contribute to epileptogensis through mossy fiber sprouting, a process whereby DGCs send glutamatergic projections to one another to form hyperexcitable circuits. With data both supporting (41Koyama R. Yamada M.K. Fujisawa S. Katoh-Semba R. Matsuki N. Ikegaya Y. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 7215-7224Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and refuting this hypothesis (42Qiao X. Suri C. Knusel B. Noebels J.L. J. Neurosci. Res. 2001; 64: 268-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 43Shetty A.K. Zaman V. Shetty G.A. J. Neurochem. 2003; 87: 147-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), a theory is evolving that associates BDNF with epileptogenesis through its regulation of inhibitory and/or excitatory neurotransmitter systems. Given the fact that Egr3 levels dramatically increase in response to BDNF, and all GABAAR subunit genes whose mRNA levels increase in response to pilocarpine-induced SE (6Brooks-Kayal A.R. Shumate M.D. Jin H. Rikhter T.Y. Coulter D.A. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1166-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar) contain binding sites for Egr transcription factors (5Steiger J.L. Russek S.J. Pharmacol. Ther. 2004; 101: 259-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), it will be important to parcel out the relationship between BDNF, Egr3, and GABAergic neurotransmission in the central nervous system. Equally important is the study of how BDNF selectively decreases the levels of α1 subunits, by an Egr-independent mechanism (5Steiger J.L. Russek S.J. Pharmacol. Ther. 2004; 101: 259-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), while increasing those of α4. Future studies will be aimed at determining the balance between these two interrelated yet distinct BDNF-induced regulatory pathways that control GABA receptor function in the nervous system. We thank the members of our respective laboratories for providing such a wonderful collegial environment to pursue our interests. A special thank you goes to David H. Farb for his initial vision that transcriptional regulation is key to understanding inhibition in the nervous system. We thank Jay Baraban for his generous contribution of Egr3 antibody and Sabita Bandyopadhyay for the α4 constructs. Finally, we dedicate our efforts to all the individuals afflicted with epilepsy in the hope that someday a better understanding may provide better therapeutics to improve their lives."
https://openalex.org/W2061737093,"In the mouse trigeminal pathway, sensory inputs from distinct facial structures, such as whiskers or lower jaw and lip, are topographically mapped onto the somatosensory cortex through relay stations in the thalamus and hindbrain. In the developing hindbrain, the mechanisms generating such maps remain elusive. We found that in the principal sensory nucleus, the whisker-related map is contributed by rhombomere 3–derived neurons, whereas the rhombomere 2–derived progeny supply the lower jaw and lip representation. Moreover, early Hoxa2 expression in neuroepithelium prevents the trigeminal nerve from ectopically projecting to the cerebellum, whereas late expression in the principal sensory nucleus promotes selective arborization of whisker-related afferents and topographic connectivity to the thalamus. Hoxa2 inactivation further results in the absence of whisker-related maps in the postnatal brain. Thus, Hoxa2 - and rhombomere 3–dependent cues determine the whisker area map and are required for the assembly of the whisker-to-barrel somatosensory circuit."
https://openalex.org/W2060028261,"The insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) play key roles in muscle development, maintenance, and repair, but their mechanisms of action are incompletely defined. We previously identified an autocrine pathway involving production of IGF-II and activation of the IGF-I receptor, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and Akt in myoblast differentiation induced by MyoD in 10T1/2 mesenchymal stem cells and found that blocking this pathway prevented differentiation (Wilson, E. M., Hsieh, M. M., and Rotwein, P. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 41109-41113). We now have analyzed regulation of MyoD function in this model system. Inhibition of IGF-II production impaired the transcriptional actions of MyoD, as seen by a 70-80% decline in activity of transfected reporter genes, including the myogenin and creatine kinase promoters, and by complete inhibition of transcription of the endogenous myogenin gene but had no effect on MyoD protein levels, post-translational modifications, or nuclear localization, and neither blocked the rapid disappearance of the inhibitory molecule Id1 nor altered the nuclear expression or abundance of the MyoD binding partner E12/E47. Impaired signaling through the IGF-I receptor also did not decrease the ability of MyoD or E12/E47 to bind to target DNA sites at the proximal myogenin promoter, as assessed by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay but, rather, blocked chromatin remodeling at this site, as indicated by reduced recruitment of co-activators p300 and P/CAF and diminished acetylation of histones H3 and H4. Taken together, these results show that IGF-II-initiated signaling through the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor targets transcriptional co-regulators that are essential co-factors for MyoD and suggests that the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt pathway plays a key role in establishing an amplification cascade that is essential for sustaining the earliest events in muscle differentiation.

The maintenance, repair, and regeneration of skeletal muscle is controlled by environmental cues mediated by systemic hormones, locally produced growth factors, and neuronal signals acting on an intrinsic genetic program involving muscle-restricted transcriptional regulatory proteins. The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors of the MyoD family (MyoD, myf-5, myogenin, MRF4) play central roles in myogenesis throughout the lifespan (1Buckingham M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 440-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 2Tapscott S.J. Development. 2005; 132: 2685-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). These proteins bind as heterodimers in conjunction with more widely expressed E12/E47 transcription factors to DNA elements termed E-boxes that are found in the promoters of many muscle-specific genes (1Buckingham M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 440-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 2Tapscott S.J. Development. 2005; 132: 2685-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 3Berkes C.A.

After the recruitment of transcriptional co-activators, this complex of proteins stimulates muscle gene expression (2Tapscott S.J. Development. 2005; 132: 2685-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). As determined by gene knock-out experiments in mice, MyoD and myf-5 are essential for myoblast specification during early embryonic development (4Rudnicki M.A. Schnegelsberg P.N. Stead R.H. Braun T.

Myostatin, a member of the transforming growth factor-β family, is a dominant inhibitor of muscle growth (11McNally E.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 2004; 350: 2642-2644Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In mice, cows, and a human with myostatin gene defects muscle hypertrophy develops (12McPherron A.C. Lawler A.M. Lee S.J.

In contrast to myostatin, the insulin-like growth factors, IGF-I 2The abbreviations used are: IGF, insulin-like growth factor; Dox, doxycycline; MHC, myosin heavy chain; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; DM, differentiation medium; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; DTT, dithiothreitol; ChIP chromatin immunoprecipitation. and IGF-II, enhance muscle growth (16Sartorelli V.

IGF-I and IGF-II act by binding to the IGF-I receptor, a ligand-stimulated transmembrane tyrosine-protein kinase that through a series of adaptor molecules activates several intracellular signaling cascades (24Nakae J. Kido Y. Accili D. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 818-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Signaling through the IGF-I receptor is crucial for normal muscle development and function. Mice engineered to lack the IGF-I receptor have muscle hypoplasia and die in the neonatal period secondary to inability to inflate their lungs (25Liu J.P. Baker J. Perkins A.S. Robertson E.J. Efstratiadis A. Cell. 1993; 75: 59-72Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2585) Google Scholar). A number of investigations also have established that the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt pathway downstream of the IGF-I receptor is essential for maintaining myoblast viability, for promoting differentiation, and for stimulating hypertrophy (22Bodine S.C.

Despite these well validated observations, only a few IGF-mediated steps acting beyond phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Akt in muscle cells have been identified. For example, muscle atrophy appears to be counteracted by IGFs in part via Akt-mediated inhibition of the activity of FoxO transcription factors, leading to a decline in expression of atrogin-1/MAFbx and MuRF1, muscle-specific E3 ubiquitin ligases that facilitate muscle protein breakdown (17Glass D.J.

Here, using as a model system C3H 10T1/2 mesenchymal stem cells acutely converted to the muscle lineage by MyoD, we show that IGF action is a necessary prerequisite for the full transcriptional activity of MyoD early in differentiation. In these cells inhibition of production of IGF-II attenuates MyoD-mediated gene expression by decreasing the recruitment of transcriptional co-activators to MyoD-occupied E-boxes on target gene promoters, thus limiting histone acetylation and chromatin remodeling, reducing the activation of RNA polymerase II, and preventing gene transcription. Our results define an early acting autocrine amplification cascade in muscle cells whereby IGF-II-mediated signaling positively regulates myogenic transcription factor function, thereby controlling terminal differentiation.

Cell Culture—C3H 10T1/2 mouse embryonic fibroblasts (ATCC catalog number CCL226) were incubated on gelatin-coated tissue culture dishes in growth medium (DMEM with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum) at 37 °C in humidified air with 5% CO2. Differentiation was initiated after cells reached 95% of confluent density (typically 1 day after viral infection) as described below and previously (30Wilson E.M. Hsieh M.M. Rotwein P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41109-41113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Gene Transfer with Recombinant Adenoviruses—All recombinant adenoviruses have been described (30Wilson E.M. Hsieh M.M. Rotwein P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41109-41113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Viruses were purified on discontinuous cesium chloride gradients and titered by optical density. Before infection, viruses were diluted in DMEM plus 2% fetal calf serum and filtered through a Gelman syringe filter (0.45 μm). Viruses were added to cells at 37 °C for 120 min at the following multiplicities of infection: 125 for Ad-tTA and 250 for Ad-MyoD. After the addition of an equal volume of DMEM with 20% fetal bovine serum, cells were incubated for a further 24 h. Cells then were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in differentiation medium (DM-DMEM plus 2% horse serum) without or with Ad-IGF-IIAS (multiplicity of infection of 500) with and without Dox. Under these conditions, ∼90% of cells were infected with all viruses. In the absence of infection with Ad-MyoD, no MyoD protein could be detected in 10T1/2 cells incubated in DM by either immunoblotting or immunocytochemistry. Protein Extraction and Immunoblotting—Whole cell and nuclear protein extracts were prepared as described (30Wilson E.M. Hsieh M.M. Rotwein P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41109-41113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and aliquots were stored at -80 °C until use. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay kit. Aliquots (40 μg per lane for whole cell protein samples, 5 μg per lane for nuclear proteins) were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon-FL, blocked in AquaBlock, and incubated with primary antibodies in buffer containing 50% AquaBlock, 50% phosphate-buffered saline, and 0.1% Tween 20 overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were rinsed with Tris-buffered saline-Tween and incubated at 23 °C for 1 h in 50% AquaBlock, 50% phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20, and 0.01% SDS with the appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa 680 or IR-800 at 1:5000. Membranes were washed according to a protocol from LiCoR and scanned on an Odyssey Infrared Imaging System using Version 1.2 analysis software (LiCoR Biosciences, Lincoln, NB). Antibodies were used at the following dilutions: anti-MHC supernatant (1:100), anti-myogenin supernatant (1:100), anti-troponin T (1:1000), anti-Akt (1:2000), anti-phospho-Akt (Ser-473) (1:1000), anti-MyoD (1:3000), anti-MEF2 (1:3000), anti-Id-1 (1:500), anti-E2A.E12 (1:1000), anti-p300 (1:1000), anti-P/CAF (1:1000), anti-Sp-1 (1:2000). Analysis of MyoD by Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—Two micrograms of nuclear protein extracts from 10T1/2 cells infected with Ad-MyoD, Ad-tTA, and Ad-IGF-IIAS, as described above, and incubated in DM with and without Dox for 24 h were diluted in a total volume of 125 μl of rehydration buffer (7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 60 mm DTT, 1× ready strip buffer, pH 3-10 (Bio-Rad), and 0.1% bromphenol blue) and incubated at 23 °C for 30 min. The denatured nuclear proteins were applied to an Amersham Biosciences 7-cm strip holder along with a pH 5-8 ReadyStrip immobilized pH gradient strip (Bio-Rad) and hydrated for 13 h at 20 °C in an Amersham Biosciences Ettan IPGphor isoelectric focusing system and focused at 4000 V for a total of 10,000 V-h. The immobilized pH gradient strips were then equilibrated in 5 ml of equilibration buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 6 m urea, 30% glycerol, 2% SDS, and 0.002% bromphenol blue) with 20 mg/ml DTT for 15 min at 23 °C. The buffer was replaced with 5 ml of new rehydration buffer containing 50 mg/ml iodoacetamide and incubated for 15 min at 23 °C. The equilibrated immobilized pH gradient strips were then subjected to SDS-PAGE (12% separating gel) and immunoblotted as described above. For analysis of dephosphorylated proteins, nuclear protein extracts (10 μg) were precipitated with water-saturated chloroform:methanol (1:4 ratio), suspended in 90 μl of Antarctic phosphatase reaction buffer and 100 units of enzyme, and incubated for 2 h at 37°C. Proteins were concentrated by chloroform:methanol precipitation and suspended in 125 μl of rehydration buffer followed by isoelectric focusing, SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting as described above. Immunocytochemistry—Cells were fixed, permeabilized, blocked, and incubated with antibodies as previously described (30Wilson E.M. Hsieh M.M. Rotwein P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41109-41113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies were added in blocking buffer for 16 h at 4 °C (anti-MHC, 1:50 dilution; anti-MyoD, 1:1000; secondary antibodies at 1:1000). Images were captured with a Roper Scientific Cool Snap FX CCD camera attached to a Nikon Eclipse T300 fluorescent microscope using IP Labs 3.5 software. Analysis of Myogenin Gene Transcription—Nuclear RNA was isolated as described (37Kou K. Rotwein P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 291-302PubMed Google Scholar). RNA concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically at 260 nm and quality assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Nuclear RNA (2.5 μg) was reverse-transcribed in a final volume of 20 μl using the Superscript III-1st strand synthesis kit (Invitrogen) with random hexamer primers. Each PCR reaction contained 1 μl of cDNA and one pair of the following primer sequences: myogenin, exon 1 (sense strand) 5′-GGGGACCCCTGAGCATTGTCC-3′, intron 1 (antisense) 5′-CCAAGGGCCCTGCTTTGCAC C-3′; S17, exon 2 (sense) 5′-ATCCCCAGCAAGAAGCTTCGGAACA-3′, intron 2 (antisense) 5′-GCCGTCACCAGCCCTCCTCCG-3′. The linear range of product amplification was established in pilot studies for each primer pair, and the cycle number representing the approximate midpoint was used in final experiments. This ranged from 25 to 30 cycles. Results were quantified using Quantity One Software (Bio-Rad) after electrophoresis through 1.2% agarose gels. Transient Transfections and Luciferase Reporter Gene Assays—Reporter plasmids containing the mouse muscle creatine kinase promoter and the 4× E-box have been reported previously (31Wilson E.M. Tureckova J. Rotwein P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). A 249-bp fragment of the mouse myogenin proximal promoter was isolated from genomic DNA using PCR and the following primers: 5′-GGGCCAGGGGCAGGCCTGCAG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CATCAGGTCGCAAAAGGCTTG-3′ (antisense). The purified PCR product was ligated into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega Inc., Madison, WI), and recombinants were identified by restriction enzyme digestion and DNA sequencing. The promoter fragment was isolated by restriction enzyme digestion with EcoRI, the ends were made blunt with Klenow DNA polymerase, and the fragment was ligated into the SmaI site of pGL3 basic (Promega). Recombinant plasmids with a correctly oriented myogenin promoter were identified by restriction endonuclease analysis. For reporter gene experiments, C3H 10T1/2 cells were seeded at 1 × 105/well of 12-well tissue culture dishes, and each well was transfected the following day with 100 ng of a promoter-reporter plasmid using TransIT LT-1. One day later cells were infected sequentially with recombinant adenoviruses as described above. After incubation in DM with and without Dox for 18-20 h, cell extracts were assayed for luciferase activity using a kit from Promega and a PerkinElmer Life Sciences luminometer. Enzymatic activity was normalized to protein concentration. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays—Initial steps were modified from published protocols (38Woelfle J. Chia D.J. Rotwein P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51261-51266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Aliquots for immunoprecipitation were derived from ∼1 × 106 cells and contained 5 μg of specific antibody or 10 μl of ascites fluid. We determined that all antibodies used for chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays detected the appropriate protein by immunoblotting of nuclear protein extracts. DNA was isolated using the Qiagen QiaQuick PCR purification kit following the steps recommended by the supplier, except that nine volumes of PB (Qiagen) were added to each sample before applying it to the spin column, and DNA was eluted with 100 μl of buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). PCR reactions were performed with 1 μl of input DNA or 4 μl of immunoprecipitated DNA with the following primers for the myogenin promoter: 5′-GAATCACATGTAATCCACTGG-3′ (sense strand) and 5′-CACACCAACTGCTGGGTGCCA-3′ (antisense). The linear range of product amplification was established for each primer pair in pilot studies, and the cycle number that reflected the approximate midpoint was used in final experiments. This varied from 30 to 35 cycles. Results were visualized after electrophoresis through 1.5% agarose gels and were quantified by densitometry after normalization to signals obtained from input DNA. The extent of myogenin gene transcription was assayed in parallel using nuclear RNA, as described above, and differentiation was assessed by immunoblotting for expression of muscle-specific proteins. Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined using a paired Student's t test. Results were considered statistically significant when p < 0.05. Defining Early Events in MyoD-mediated Muscle Differentiation at the Myogenin Gene—The critical roles of MyoD and related basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors in muscle cell determination and differentiation have been recognized for nearly two decades (for review, see Ref. 2Tapscott S.J. Development. 2005; 132: 2685-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Many studies have demonstrated that these proteins individually can convert uncommitted mesenchymal precursors to the myoblast lineage (39Weintraub H. Cell. 1993; 75: 1241-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar), as we showed recently using 10T1/2 cells acutely infected with a recombinant adenovirus encoding mouse MyoD (Ad-MyoD) (30Wilson E.M. Hsieh M.M. Rotwein P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41109-41113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Using this model we now have analyzed early events in MyoD-initiated muscle differentiation, focusing on the myogenin gene, which is a direct transcriptional target of MyoD (for review, see Ref. 2Tapscott S.J. Development. 2005; 132: 2685-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows the results of experiments examining the kinetics and consequences of binding of MyoD to the proximal myogenin promoter in myoblasts. As assessed by ChIP in Fig. 1B, MyoD is already found on DNA in chromatin at this site at the onset of incubation of cells in DM ∼ 24 h after infection of cells with Ad-MyoD. Binding appeared to increase over the ensuing 4 h and then declined but remained measurable for up to 24 h. Similar results were observed for MEF2 proteins, which can interact directly with MyoD but which also recognize a DNA sequence adjacent to the E-box in the proximal myogenin promoter (10Naya F.S. Olson E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 683-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). By contrast, the presence of E12/E47, the hetero-dimerization partner of MyoD on DNA (2Tapscott S.J. Development. 2005; 132: 2685-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar), was relatively constant. MyoD and MEF2 have been found to interact with the transcriptional co-activators p300 and P/CAF (40Sartorelli V. Huang J. Hamamori Y. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1010-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), and both proteins are able to facilitate gene activation in part through their acetylation of histones in chromatin (41Chan H.M. La Thangue N.B. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2363-2373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Vo N. Goodman R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13505-13508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). Both p300 and P/CAF also have been shown to acetylate MyoD on lysine residues within its DNA binding domain (43Polesskaya A. Duquet A. Naguibneva I. Weise C. Vervisch A. Bengal E. Hucho F. Robin P.

https://openalex.org/W1991267416,"We present a method for sequencing DNA that relies on the motion of single RNA polymerase molecules. When a given nucleotide species limits the rate of transcription, polymerase molecules pause at positions corresponding to the rare base. An ultrastable optical trapping apparatus capable of base pair resolution was used to monitor transcription under limiting amounts of each of the four nucleotide species. From the aligned patterns of pauses recorded from as few as four molecules, we determined the DNA sequence. This proof of principle demonstrates that the motion of a processive nucleic acid enzyme may be used to extract sequence information directly from DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2003466694,"Mutations in the human neurotrypsin gene are associated with autosomal recessive mental retardation. To further understand the pathophysiological consequences of the lack of this serine protease, we studied Tequila (Teq), the Drosophila neurotrypsin ortholog, using associative memory as a behavioral readout. We found that teq inactivation resulted in a long-term memory (LTM)–specific defect. After LTM conditioning of wild-type flies, teq expression transiently increased in the mushroom bodies. Moreover, specific inhibition of teq expression in adult mushroom bodies resulted in a reversible LTM defect. Hence, the Teq pathway is essential for information processing in Drosophila ."
https://openalex.org/W2086739969,"Tumor cells expressing ligands of the NKG2D receptor stimulate anti-tumor immunity mediated by natural killer and T cells. In humans, NKG2D ligands (NKG2DL) are encoded by MIC and ULBP proteins. NKG2DL exhibit highly restricted expression in healthy tissues but are widely expressed in tumors. However, regulation of each NKG2DL differs substantially in different cancer cells. In this study, we characterized the mechanisms that regulate the expression of ULBP1. We show that the transcription of ULBP1 strictly depends on the binding of Sp1 and Sp3 to a CRE(1) site located in the ULBP1 minimal promoter. The mutation or deletion of this Sp1/Sp3 binding site abolished the transcription of ULBP1. It also diminished the transactivation of ULBP1 promoter by Sp3 overexpression, but not by Sp1, indicating that Sp3 is the main transcription factor that regulates ULBP1 through the CRE(1) site. Experiments in SL2 cells showed that the ULBP1 promoter was inactive in the absence of the Sp proteins and indicate that Sp3 is the essential activator of ULBP1 transcription, because the overexpression of Sp3 up-regulated its promoter activity >500-fold. Additionally, we demonstrated that AP-2α repressed the expression of ULBP1 in HeLa cells by interfering with the binding of Sp3 and Sp1 to the ULBP1 promoter. These data indicate that Sp1, Sp3, and AP-2α may play an important role in the immunosurveillance against cancer. Finally, the definition of ULBP1 regulation may have implications for development of new therapeutic strategies against cancer cells. Tumor cells expressing ligands of the NKG2D receptor stimulate anti-tumor immunity mediated by natural killer and T cells. In humans, NKG2D ligands (NKG2DL) are encoded by MIC and ULBP proteins. NKG2DL exhibit highly restricted expression in healthy tissues but are widely expressed in tumors. However, regulation of each NKG2DL differs substantially in different cancer cells. In this study, we characterized the mechanisms that regulate the expression of ULBP1. We show that the transcription of ULBP1 strictly depends on the binding of Sp1 and Sp3 to a CRE(1) site located in the ULBP1 minimal promoter. The mutation or deletion of this Sp1/Sp3 binding site abolished the transcription of ULBP1. It also diminished the transactivation of ULBP1 promoter by Sp3 overexpression, but not by Sp1, indicating that Sp3 is the main transcription factor that regulates ULBP1 through the CRE(1) site. Experiments in SL2 cells showed that the ULBP1 promoter was inactive in the absence of the Sp proteins and indicate that Sp3 is the essential activator of ULBP1 transcription, because the overexpression of Sp3 up-regulated its promoter activity >500-fold. Additionally, we demonstrated that AP-2α repressed the expression of ULBP1 in HeLa cells by interfering with the binding of Sp3 and Sp1 to the ULBP1 promoter. These data indicate that Sp1, Sp3, and AP-2α may play an important role in the immunosurveillance against cancer. Finally, the definition of ULBP1 regulation may have implications for development of new therapeutic strategies against cancer cells.

Whereas most NK receptors bind to ubiquitously expressed major histocompatibility complex class I molecules, a peculiarity of NKG2D consists in the multitude of ligands that are induced subsequently to harmful events such as genotoxic stress or infection (3Bauer S.

Tumor cells expressing NKG2DL become susceptible to NK cell killing even if the tumor cells have normal HLA class I expression (1Cerwenka A. Lanier L.L. Immunol.

NKG2DL expression in mice is induced by carcinogens and genotoxic stress, and tumor cells expressing these proteins were readily eliminated by NK and CD8 T cells in vivo (6Gasser S. Orsulic S.

Nature. 2005; 436: 1186-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar). Thereby, DNA-damage response, which arrests the cell cycle and enhances DNA repair functions, or triggers apoptosis, also alerts the immune system in response to potentially dangerous cells through the activation of NKG2D. It is still a matter of controversy as to why so many different ligands exist for the same receptor, because the stimulatory activity of the immune cells of different NKG2DLs are very similar. In the context of tumor transformation or infection, the multitude of ligands could be explained as a strategy to avoid the evasion of the immune system. Several studies indicate that the regulation of individual NKG2DL expression differs substantially in a particular tumor or infected cells (15Groh V. Rhinehart R. Secrist H. Bauer S. Grabstein K.H. Spies T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6879-6884Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar, 17Pende D. Rivera P. Marcenaro S. Chang C.C. Biassoni R. Conte R. Kubin M. Cosman D.

Blood. 2003; 102: 1389-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), suggesting that the multitude of NKG2DLs do not simply reflect the redundant expression of molecules with the same function. Concordantly, despite the strong conservation of the coding sequence among all ULBPs, the sequence of the 5′-flanking regions of these genes has little homology, and this suggests that ULBPs could be specifically regulated in response to different stimuli or pathologies. Nevertheless, very little is known about the mechanisms of NKG2DL induction and expression. Here, we have analyzed for the first time the mechanism that controls ULBP1 expression. We show that ULBP1 transcription strictly depends on the CRE(1) site located at –115, because the mutation or deletion of this site practically abolished the transcription of ULBP1. We also demonstrate that the Sp1 and Sp3 transcription factors are bound to the CRE(1) sequence, and the expression of ULBP1 depends on the activity of these transcription factors. Nevertheless, chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis (ChIP) demonstrated that Sp1 and Sp3 were the main transcription factors bound to this promoter in vivo. Mutation of the CRE(1) site significantly diminished the transactivation of ULBP1 promoter by Sp3 expression, but not the Sp1, indicating that Sp3 is the main transcription factor that regulates ULBP1 through the CRE(1) site. Furthermore, co-transfection experiments into Drosophila SL2 cells lacking Sp factors demonstrated that ULBP1 promoter was practically inactive in the absence of the Sp proteins and showed that the long isoform of Sp3 was a 90-fold stronger activator of ULBP1 transcription than Sp1 was. This indicates that Sp3 plays an essential role in the expression of ULBP1 suggesting that the regulation of the expression of Sp3 isoforms or its activity may play a key role in the induction of ULBP1 expression that is observed in cancer cells. We also show that AP-2α may mediate transcriptional repression of the ULBP1 gene through competition with the transcriptional activator Sp1 and Sp3 for binding to the ULBP1 minimal promoter. AP-2α is a transcription factor that acts as a tumor suppressor that favors epithelial differentiation and induces cell cycle arrest (27Zeng Y.X. Somasundaram K. el-Deiry W.S. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 28Wajapeyee N. Somasundaram K. J. Biol.

Thus, our results indicate that Sp1, Sp3, and AP-2α may play an important role in the immunosurveillance against cancer cells regulating the expression of ULBP1. Cell Culture—HeLa (human cervix carcinoma) cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA), and human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK 293) were obtained from Dr. P. Sanchez Lazo (Universidad de Oviedo, Spain). Cells were grown at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and gentamicin in a humidified 95% air, 5% CO2 incubator. SL2 cells were a gift from Dr. P. Dominguez (Universidad de Oviedo) and were grown in Schneider's Drosophila medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and gentamicin at 28 °C without CO2. Mapping of the Transcription Start Sites of ULBP1 Gene—The transcription start sites of the ULBP1 gene in HeLa and HEK 293 cells were determined by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5′-RACE) as previously described (36Gonzalez S. Lopez-Larrea C. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2282-2290PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA was isolated from cell cultures by TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). A synthetic oligonucleotide (GSP1) complementary to mRNA, spanning bases +334 to +314 (5′-CAC GTC TCT TAG TGT TTC AG-3′), was used to generate 5′-end ULBP1 dA-tailed. This cDNA was subjected to two rounds of PCR. The first PCR was conducted with a specific primer (GSP2) spanning bases +266 to +242 (5′-C AAA GGC TTT GGC GTT GTG GTT AA-3′) and an oligonucleotide containing deoxythymidines at the 3′-end, Sp6-(dT)18 (5′-ATT TAG GTG ACA CTA TAG AAT ACG TCG ACA TCG ATG G(dT)18-3′). The second one was performed with a nested specific primer (GSP3) spanning bases +28 to +10 (5′-CCG TGG ACA GGA GGC GCT-3′) and the Sp6 primer lacking the dT tail. All PCR products were 5′-end phosphorylated using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Amersham Biosciences) and blunt ended with T4 DNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI) and then cloned in the EcoRV site of the Bluescript II KS plasmid (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Generation of ULBP1 Promoter Reporter, Mutant, and Deletion Constructs—A 900-bp ULBP1 promoter fragment was amplified by PCR from human genomic DNA using the following primers: ULBP1s, 5′-TAA GCC CTC CCT TGC GGC C-3′, and the reverse ULBP1as,5′-CCG TGG ACA GGA GGC GCT-3′. The fragment obtained was ligated into the SmaI site of the pGL2 Basic vector (Promega). Different deletions were produced by PCR using this construct as a DNA template with the following forward primers: –603, 5′-CAC AAC TGA TCA CAT CAT GAT TGA TCA C-3′; –288, 5′-GGG GTA ATG ATA AAT GCT GTG TTG AA-3′; –200, 5′-CGC ACG CCG CCA CCA A-3′; –137, 5′-GTC AGA TGA CGA GCC CGG G-3′; –75, 5′-CCC GCC CAG TGT ATC CCT G-3′; and –42, 5′-GGG CTG GGC AGC TTT ATA AAC AG-3′. The PCR products were subcloned into the SmaI site of pGL2 Basic vector. The integrity of constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Mutant promoter constructs were generated using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) with the following primers (only forward primers are shown; mutated oligonucleotides were underlined): mTATA, 5′-CCG GGC TGG GCA GCT TCG CGA ACA GCC GTG GTG TG-3′; mGC(1), 5′-ATC CCT GCG CGC GGC TTG CCG GGC TGG GCA GC-3′; mGC(2), 5′-GCC TAG GAT CCC GAA CAG TGT ATC CCT GCG CGC-3′; mNF-κB, 5′-GGC GTG ACG GGG TGG AGC ATA AAC AAA AAA GTG CAT GCC-3′; mGC(3), 5′-GCC CGG GGC GTG ACG GTT TGG AGC ATC CCC-3′; mCRE(1), 5′-GAG CCC GGG GCG GCT GTG GGT GGA GCA TCC C-3′; mGC(4)/AP-2, 5′-GAT GAC GAG CCC GGT TCG TGA CGG GGT GGA GC-3′; and mCRE(2), 5′-GCC AGG CCG CTG TCA GGC TGT GAG CCC GGG GCG TGA CGG-3′. All these constructs were verified for their nucleotide sequence and reading frame by DNA sequence analysis.

The reporter plasmid pGL3-waf1-LUC was described before (43Friedlander P. Haupt Y. Prives C. Oren M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4961-4971Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Transient Transfections and Luciferase Reporter Assays—HeLa and HEK 293 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), following the manufacturer's recommendations. Briefly, 5 × 104 cells were transfected in 24-well plates with 300 ng of each reporter construct and 12 ng of pRL-null vector (Promega) as an internal control plasmid. Cells were harvested at 24 h and assayed for luciferase activity using the Dual Luciferase Reporter System (Promega). For co-transfection assays with dominant negative or expression vectors, pRSV β-galactosidase plasmid was included and luciferase measures were normalized with β-galactosidase activity. In some experiments, 200 nm mithramycin A (Sigma) was added 4 h after DNA transfections, and luciferase activity was assayed 24 h later. Drosophila SL2 cells (5 × 105 cells) were co-transfected in 24-well plates using Lipofectamine 2000 with 500 ng of reporter plasmid plus 300 ng of each expression vector. Cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection, and luciferase activities were normalized against the total protein concentration as measured using the BCA Protein Assay kit (Pierce). Real-time PCR and Flow Cytometry—Real-time PCR was performed using SYBR Green from reverse-transcribed cDNA samples for relative quantification of mRNA levels for the genes of interest. The mRNA level of the GAPDH gene was determined in each assay to normalize the expression of genes of interest. The primers used were as follows: ULBP1 sense, 5′-ATC AGC GCC TCC TGT CCA C-3′; ULBP1 antisense, 5′-AAA GAC AGT GTG TGT CGA CCC AT-3′; MICA sense, 5′-AAT GGA ACC TAC CAG ACC TGG G-3′; MICA antisense, 5′-ACA TGG AAT GTC TGC CAA TGA CT-3′; GAPDH sense, 5′-CGG AGT CAA CGG ATT TGG TC-3′; and GAPDH antisense, 5′-AAT CAT ATT GGA ACA TGT AAA CCA TGT AGT-3′. Cell surface expression of ULBP1 and MICA/B were detected by flow cytometry using a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur (Sunnyvale, CA). Detached cells were incubated with a monoclonal antibody anti-ULBP1 (4G7) or a monoclonal anti-MICA/B (6G6), which were kindly provided by Dr. Thomas Spies (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Centre, Seattle, WA), for 30 min on ice; followed by incubation with a phycoerythrin-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG1 secondary monoclonal antibody (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) for another 30 min on ice. To investigate the effect of Sp1, Sp3, and AP-2α on endogenous ULBP1 expression, HeLa and HEK 293 cells were grown in 60-mm dishes and co-transfected with 2 μg of pN3, pN3-Sp1, pN3-Sp3FL, pCMX, or pCMX-AP-2α expression vectors and with 0.5 μg of pCS2-GFP plasmid (44Huang H. Marsh-Armstrong N. Brown D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 962-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). After 48 h, ULBP1 surface expression was analyzed in GFP-positive cells using a monoclonal antibody anti-ULBP1 (4G7) as described above. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—90% confluent HeLa and HEK 293 cells were used for preparing nuclear extracts as previously described (45Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2214) Google Scholar). The protein concentration of the extracts was determined by using BCA assay (Pierce). A wild-type double-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to positions –128/–99 of ULBP1 promoter (5′-GAG CCC GGG GCG TGA CGG GGT GGA GCA TC-3′) was 5′-end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (3000Ci/mmol, Nucliber, Spain). The DNA binding reactions were performed in a volume of 20 μl containing 5 μg of nuclear protein together with the 32P-end-labeled wild-type probe and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences) in binding buffer (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9; 5% (v/v) glycerol; 50 mm KCl; 5 mm MgCl2; 0.5 mm EDTA; 0.1% Nonidet P-40; and 1 mm dithiothreitol) on ice for 35 min. The binding reactions were electrophoresed on 6% native acrylamide gels in Tris-Borate-EDTA buffer. For competition experiments, a 100 molar excess of unlabeled probes was incubated with the extracts at 25 °C for 15 min before adding the radioactive probe. The oligonucleotides used in competition assays were as follows: Sp1 consensus, 5′-ATT CGA TCG GGG CGG GGC GAG C-3′; CREB consensus, 5′-AGA GAT TGC CTG ACG TCA GAG AGC TAG-3′; AP-2 consensus, 5′-GAT CGA ACT GAC CGC CCG CGG CCC GT-3′. Mutant ULBP1 promoter probes included the same punctual mutations described above. In supershift assays, nuclear extracts and 2 μg of commercial antibody were preincubated for 60 min on ice prior to the addition of the remaining components of the binding reaction. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies anti-Sp3 (sc-644X), anti-AP-2α (sc-184X), and mouse monoclonal antibody anti-Sp1 (sc-420X) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit polyclonal anti-CREB (ab503, ABCAM, United Kingdom) was a generous gift from Dr. JM Freije (Universidad de Oviedo). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—ChIP was performed using the ChIP assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) following the manufacturer's recommendations. Briefly, HeLa and HEK 293 cells were treated with 1% formaldehyde, pelleted, and resuspended in SDS lysis buffer. Chromatin was sonicated to sizes between 200 and 500 bp using a Branson Sonifier 450. Diluted chromatin was precleared with 80 μl of salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose-50% slurry (Upstate Biotechnology) and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with 5 μg of anti-Sp1, -Sp3, -AP-2α antibodies or normal rabbit IgG (sc-2027, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). 20 μl of NaCl 5 m was added, the immune complexes were eluted, and cross-links were reversed by overnight incubation at 65 °C. DNA samples were purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. A 95-bp fragment of the ULBP1 proximal promoter spanning the region from –137 to –43 was amplified by PCR using the following primers: 5′-GTC AGA TGA CGA GCC CGG G-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGC CCG CCG CGC GCA-3′ (reverse). The samples were electrophoresed on a 2% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Western Blotting—To obtain total protein extracts, HeLa and HEK 293 cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm dithiothreitol, complete inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails I and II (Sigma). Soluble proteins were then separated by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined using BCA assay (Pierce). Nuclear extracts from HeLa and HEK 293 cells were obtained as described above. Following heat denaturation, samples containing 15 μg of protein were loaded on 10% SDS-PAGE gels. Proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and stained with Ponceau to verify that similar amounts of protein had been loaded. Blots were blocked with 3% nonfat dry milk and incubated overnight at 4 °C with a dilution 1/600 of the rabbit polyclonal antibodies anti-Sp3 (sc-644X) and anti-AP-2α (sc-184X) and of the mouse monoclonal antibody anti-Sp1 (sc-420X). Finally, blots were incubated with 1/7500 donkey anti-rabbit-horseradish peroxidase or goat-anti-mouse-horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) in 1.5% nonfat dry milk washed and developed with West Pico Chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Expression of ULBP1 and Characterization of Transcription Start Sites—The expression of ULBP1 was analyzed in HeLa and HEK 293 cells at RNA and protein level. The ULBP1 mRNA was quantified by real-time PCR and normalized using GAPDH level within each cell line. HEK 293 showed 9.3-fold higher expression of ULBP1 mRNA than HeLa (Fig. 1A). Concordantly, HEK 293 cells expressed significant amounts of ULBP1 surface protein; however, only a scarce expression of ULBP1 was detected on HeLa cells (Fig. 1B). To determine the transcription initiation site(s) of the ULBP1 gene, 5′-RACE was performed using total RNA from HeLa and HEK 293 cells (Fig. 2A). Three and two ULBP1-specific transcription start sites were identified in HeLa and HEK 293, respectively (Fig. 2B). Sequencing of an additional PCR product that appeared between bands 2 and 3 indicated that it did not correspond to a ULBP1 transcription start site (data not shown). The sequence of the PCR products 2 and 3 revealed that both cell lines shared two common transcription start sites located 43 bp and 108 bp upstream of the ATG codon. HeLa presented an additional transcription start site located 132 bp relative to ATG (Fig. 2B, band 1). Fragment 3, shared by HEK 293 and HeLa, showed the highest intensity of all three bands and is located 28 bp downstream of a canonical TATA box. This site corresponds with the previously determined 5′-end of the ULBP1 mRNA (5Cosman D. Mullberg J. Sutherland C.L. Chin W. Armitage R. Fanslow W. Kubin M. Chalupny N.J. Immunity. 2001; 14: 123-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar) suggesting that this is the main transcription start site of the ULBP1 gene (Fig. 2C).

In addition, overexpression of the constitutively active PKCδ catalytic fragment (PKCδ-cat) is sufficient to trigger Bax activation, cytochrome c release, and apoptosis. While PKCδ is a key apoptotic effector, the downstream target(s) responsible for the mitochondrial apoptotic cascade are not known. We found that expression of the active PKCδ-cat in HaCaT cells triggers a reduction in the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1, similar to UV radiation. The down-regulation of Mcl-1 induced by PKCδ-cat was not at the mRNA level but was due to decreased protein half-life. Overexpression of Mcl-1 protected HaCaT cells from both UV and PKCδ-cat-induced apoptosis and blocked the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria, indicating that Mcl-1 down-regulation was required for apoptosis signaling. Indeed, down-regulation of Mcl-1 with siRNA slightly increased the basal apoptotic rate of HaCaT cells and dramatically sensitized them to UV or PKCδ-cat-induced apoptosis. HaCaT cells with down-regulated Mcl-1 had higher activated Bax protein, as measured by Bax cross-linking, indicating that Mcl-1 down-regulation is sufficient for Bax activation. Finally, recombinant PKCδ could phosphorylate Mcl-1 in vitro, identifying Mcl-1 as a direct target for PKCδ. Overall our results identify Mcl-1 as an important target for PKCδ-cat that can mediate its pro-apoptotic effects on mitochondria to amplify the apoptotic signaling induced by a wide range of apoptotic stimuli."

Although β2-m has Trp residues at positions 60 and 95, both are located near the surface of the domain. Hence, β2-m does not have a conserved Trp common to other immunoglobulin domains, which is buried in close proximity to the disulfide bond. To study the structure of amyloid fibrils in relation to their native fold, we prepared a series of Trp mutants. Trp60 and Trp95 were both replaced with Phe, and a single Trp was introduced at various positions. Among various mutants, W39-β2-m, in which a Trp was introduced at the position corresponding to the conserved Trp, exhibited a remarkable quenching of fluorescence in the native state, as observed for other immunoglobulin domains. An x-ray structural analysis revealed that W39-β2-m assumes the native fold with Trp39 located in the vicinity of the disulfide bond. Comparison of the fluorescence spectra of various mutants for the native and fibrillar forms indicated that, while the Trp residues introduced in the middle of the β2-m sequence tend to be buried in the fibrils, those located in the C-terminal region are more exposed. In addition, the fluorescence spectra of fibrils prepared at pH 2.5 and 7.0 revealed a large difference in the fluorescence intensity for W60-β2-m, implying a major structural difference between them. β2-Microglobulin (β2-m), a protein responsible for dialysis-related amyloidosis, adopts an immunoglobulin domain fold in its native state.

As a part of its normal catabolic cycle, β2-m dissociated from the complex is transported in serum to the kidneys where the majority (95%) of it is degraded (15Floege J. Ketteler M. Kidney Int. 2001; 59: 164-171Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Renal failure disrupts the clearance of β2-m from the serum and moreover β2-m does not pass through the dialysis membrane, resulting in an increase in the β2-m concentration by up to 50-fold in the blood circulation (15Floege J. Ketteler M. Kidney Int. 2001; 59: 164-171Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (148) Google Scholar). When a high blood level is retained for more than 10 years, β2-m then self-associates to form amyloid fibrils, causing dialysis-related amyloidosis (15Floege J. Ketteler M.

The results so far obtained with various approaches suggest a picture of β2-m amyloid fibrils with an increased amount of β-structure in comparison with the native structure, including the transformation of native β-turns, but with disordered N- and C-terminal regions (6McParland V.J.

To address the structure of amyloid fibrils, we have taken advantage of the unique properties of Trp fluorescence. One important feature of immunoglobulin domains is the presence of a buried Trp residue located close to the conserved disulfide bonds (18Amzel L.M. Poljak R.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 961-997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), leading to a strong quenching of Trp fluorescence (19Tsunenaga M. Goto Y. Kawata Y. Hamaguchi K. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6044-6051Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 20Goto Y. Ichimura N. Hamaguchi K. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1670-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We noticed that, although β2-m has two Trp residues (i.e. Trp60 and Trp95), neither of these corresponds to the buried Trp common to other immunoglobulin domains. In the x-ray crystallographic structure of wild-type β2-m, while Trp60 located on the β-turn connecting β-strands D and E is exposed to solvent, Trp95 at the end of β-strand G is partially buried (Fig. 1). We designed and expressed a series of single Trp mutants in which Trp residues of wild-type β2-m have been deleted and a new Trp residue was introduced at various positions. Examination of the fluorescence spectra of mutants in the native and amyloid states revealed a notable conformational change upon the formation of amyloid fibrils. β2-m Amyloid Fibril Formation—The expression and purification of human recombinant β2-m and the single Trp mutants were achieved as described previously (21Chiba T.

Acidic pH fibrils were prepared by a repeated seed-dependent extension with human recombinant β2-m expressed in Escherichia coli (21Chiba T. Hagihara Y. Higurashi T. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47016-47024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). or yeast Pichia pastoris (22Kozhukh G.V. Hagihara Y. Kawakami T. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1310-1315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Neutral pH fibrils were prepared at pH 7.0 by a repeated seeding starting with the acidic pH fibrils (23Kihara M. Chatani E. Sakai M. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12012-12018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Throughout the experiments, we incubated the solutions for the formation of fibrils without agitation. The standard buffers used were 50 mm sodium citrate buffer (pH 2.5) containing 100 mm NaCl and 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 100 mm NaCl. β2-m fibrils were originally purified from patients suffering from dialysis-related amyloidosis. Seeds (i.e. fragmented fibrils) were prepared by sonication of 200-μl aliquots of a fibril stock solution using a Microson sonicator (Misonix, Farmingdale, NY) as described previously (23Kihara M. Chatani E. Sakai M. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12012-12018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The fibril concentrations were measured with a Micro BCA™ Protein Assay Reagent kit (Pierce). The amyloid extension reactions of mutant β2-ms were carried out using the wild-type neutral pH seeds and wild-type acidic pH seeds at pH 7.0 and 2.5, respectively. The extension reaction mixture at pH 2.5 contained 25 μm monomeric β2-m and 5 μg/ml acidic seeds. The extension reaction mixture at pH 7.0 contained 25 μm monomeric β2-m, 30 μg/ml neutral pH seeds, and 0.5 mm SDS (23Kihara M. Chatani E. Sakai M. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12012-12018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A low concentration of SDS, below its critical micelle concentration, is considered to stabilize the seeds and fibrils, to induce conformational change of monomers, and most importantly, to induce the oligomerization ofβ2-m. The reaction was monitored by the fluorometric assay with thioflavin T (ThT) at pH 8.5 as described previously (21Chiba T. Hagihara Y. Higurashi T. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47016-47024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 22Kozhukh G.V. Hagihara Y. Kawakami T. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biol.

AFM images were obtained using a Nano Scope IIIa (Digital Instruments) as described previously (24Ohhashi Y. Kihara M. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32843-32848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy system to observe ThT-bound amyloid fibrils was developed based on the use of an inverted microscope (IX70; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) as described previously (25Ban T. Hoshino M. Takahashi S. Hamada D. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 757-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Trp Fluorescence Measurements—Trp fluorescence spectra were measured with a Hitachi F-4500 spectrofluorometer at 25 °C and aβ2-m concentration of 0.05 mg/ml with excitation at 295 nm and monitored at 300-450 nm. Urea- or Gdn-HCl-dependent unfolding transitions of β2-m in the monomeric or amyloid state were measured using the change of Trp fluorescence. Before the measurements, the samples were incubated for 24 h at 25 °C. To compare the spectra of various single Trp β2-m mutants in the native or fibrillar state, the spectra of the unfolded states in 5.5 m Gdn-HCl or 10 m urea are assumed to be the same independent of mutations. We did not normalize the spectra of the unfolded states under different conditions. The spectra of wild-type β2-m with two Trp residues in 5.5 m Gdn-HCl or 10 m urea are assumed to have an intensity 2-fold those of single Trp mutants. We consider that this normalization provides a more accurate comparison of the spectra of various mutants particularly for amyloid fibrils. A Two-state Unfolding Transition Analysis of the Native State—For the unfolding of the native state at pH 8.0, we further analyzed the results assuming a two-state transition between the native and denatured states (21Chiba T. Hagihara Y. Higurashi T. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47016-47024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). To obtain the fraction of unfolded species (fU), the fluorescence spectra from 310 nm to 450 nm were fitted to Equation 1, F=α{fUFU+(1-fU)FN} where F is the spectrum for a sample with each concentration of denaturant, FN and FD that for without denaturant and the highest concentration of denaturant, respectively, fU is the fractional population of unfolded species, and α is a variable term for fluorescence intensity (21Chiba T. Hagihara Y. Higurashi T. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47016-47024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Exceptionally, for the monomeric states of W39- and W33-β2-m, 4W33-, W39-, W49-, W60-, W78-, and W95-β2-ms: single Trp mutants with a single Trp at the indicated residue number, where W60- and W95-β2-ms contain W95F and W60F mutations, respectively, and W33-, W39-, W49-, and W78-β2-ms contain triple mutations of W60F/W95F/S33W, W60F/W95F/L39W, W60F/W95F/V49W, and W60F/W95F/Y78W respectively. which did not show a change in maximal wavelength but exhibited a significant change in intensity upon unfolding (see “Results”), spectral area was calculated at each concentration of Gdn-HCl and used for the determination of fU. fU was plotted against the concentration of denaturant. The free energy change of unfolding (ΔGU) was calculated by a least-squares fitting shown in Equation 2, fU(y)=1/{1+exp(-ΔGU/RT)} where fU(y) is the observed fU, R is the gas constant and T is temperature. Then, a standard linear relation was assumed between ΔGU and the concentration of denaturant[denaturant]) in Equation 3, ΔGU=ΔGU,H20-m[denaturant] where ΔGU,H20 is ΔGU in water and m is a measure for cooperativity of unfolding. The midpoint concentration of unfolding, Cm, is calculated in Equation 4. Cm=ΔGU,H20/m X-ray Crystallographic Analysis—Crystals of the monomeric wild-type and W39-β2-ms were grown by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method (26McPherson A. J. Cryst. Growth. 1992; 122: 161-167Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). For wild-type β2-m, the reservoir solution contained 20% (w/v) PEG 4000, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 200 mm ammonium acetate, and 100 mm sodium acetate at pH 5.6. The reservoir solution for W39-β2-m contained 15% (w/v) PEG 4000, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 200 mm ammonium acetate, and 100 mm sodium acetate at pH 5.6. Crystal-growth droplets (3 μl) were composed of 2 μl of protein solution at 8-12 mg ml-1 and 4-5 mg ml-1 for wild-type and W39-β2-m, respectively, in 25 mm sodium acetate at pH 5.6 and 1 μl of reservoir solution, and were incubated at 15 °C. X-ray diffraction data were collected to a resolution of 1.7 Å for wild-type β2-m and 2.1 Å for W39-β2-m on a R-AXIS VII image plate detector, using graphite-monochromated CuKα radiation (1.5418 Å generated from an FR-E Super-Bright rotating anode operated at 45 kV and 45 mA) (Rigaku, Japan). Diffraction images were indexed and integrated with MOSFLM software (27Leslie A.G.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1992; 55: 1696-1702Crossref Scopus (485) Google Scholar), and then scaled and merged with the SCALA program (CCP4) (28CCP4 Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4.Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19768) Google Scholar). To solve the structures, the molecular replacement program MOLREP (29Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4152) Google Scholar) was used on the basis of the monomeric structure (Protein Data Bank ID code 1LDS) reported previously (12Trinh C.H. Smith D.P. Kalverda A.P. Phillips E.V. Radford S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9771-9776Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The model was built with the program O (30Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar) and refined using REFMAC5 (31Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13869) Google Scholar). Progress with the refinement was monitored by comparing the R factor to the free R factor (32Brunger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3864) Google Scholar). The geometry of the model was monitored using the program PROCHECK (33Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4428) Google Scholar), the Ramachandran plot showing that 99% of the residues lie in the allowed region. CD Spectra of Single Trp Mutants—CD spectra of single Trp β2-ms were measured at pH 8.0 (see supplemental Fig. S1). The far-UV CD spectra of all the mutants were similar to those of wild-type β2-m (23Kihara M. Chatani E. Sakai M. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12012-12018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the near-UV CD spectra were differed, indicating that Trp residues contribute to the near-UV CD and that the environment of these residues differs depending on the mutant. Thus, in overall structure, the single Trp mutants were similar to the wild type. Trp Fluorescence Spectra of Single Trp Mutants—We characterized the single Trp mutants using Trp fluorescence (Fig. 2, Table 1, see also supplemental Fig. S2). The fluorescence spectrum of wild-type β2-m in the native state at pH 8.0 showed a maximum (λmax) at 337 nm (Fig. 2A). The addition of high concentrations of Gdn-HCl resulted in a red shift of the λmax to 350 nm, accompanied by a decrease in the intensity of fluorescence. W60-β2-m showed a λmax at 353 nm even in the absence of Gdn-HCl and an increase in the Gdn-HCl concentration resulted in only a slight shift of the λmax to a shorter wavelength accompanied by a slight decrease in fluorescence (Fig. 2A). The results are consistent with the complete exposure of Trp60 in the crystallographic structure (12Trinh C.H. Smith D.P. Kalverda A.P. Phillips E.V. Radford S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9771-9776Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the fluorescence spectrum of W95-β2-m showed a similar change to that of the wild type, indicating that, although Trp95 is partly buried, it is not quenched by the disulfide bond (Fig. 2A). In fact, the fluorescence spectrum of wild-type β2-m was reproduced by adding the spectra of W60- and W95-β2-ms (Fig. 3A,dashed line). These results clearly demonstrate that Trp95 predominantly contributes to the fluorescence of wild-type β2-m.TABLE 1Comparison of conformation and stability of the wild-type and single Trp β2-msProteinMonomers at pH 7.0Fibrils at pH 2.5Fibrils at pH 7.0ΔGU,H20aThe free energy change of unfolding in the absence of denaturant (ΔGU,H20) and a measure for cooperativity of unfolding (m) as described by Equation 3.maThe free energy change of unfolding in the absence of denaturant (ΔGU,H20) and a measure for cooperativity of unfolding (m) as described by Equation 3.CmbMidpoint denaturant concentration of unfolding.RcDistance between the Cα of the Trp residue and the center of the Cys25-Cys80 disulfide bond, which was calculated from the coordinate of wild-type β2-m (PDB ID code 2D4F).QdRelative fluorescence spectral area of Trp among various mutants in the same conformational states where those of the wild-type β2-m with two Trp residues were defined to be 200%.λNeMaximal wavelength of Trp fluorescence in the native state (λN), denatured state (λD), or amyloid fibrils (λf).λDeMaximal wavelength of Trp fluorescence in the native state (λN), denatured state (λD), or amyloid fibrils (λf).CmbMidpoint denaturant concentration of unfolding.QdRelative fluorescence spectral area of Trp among various mutants in the same conformational states where those of the wild-type β2-m with two Trp residues were defined to be 200%.λfeMaximal wavelength of Trp fluorescence in the native state (λN), denatured state (λD), or amyloid fibrils (λf).λDeMaximal wavelength of Trp fluorescence in the native state (λN), denatured state (λD), or amyloid fibrils (λf).CmbMidpoint denaturant concentration of unfolding.QdRelative fluorescence spectral area of Trp among various mutants in the same conformational states where those of the wild-type β2-m with two Trp residues were defined to be 200%.λfeMaximal wavelength of Trp fluorescence in the native state (λN), denatured state (λD), or amyloid fibrils (λf).λDeMaximal wavelength of Trp fluorescence in the native state (λN), denatured state (λD), or amyloid fibrils (λf).kJ mol−1kJ mol−1 m−1mÅ%nmnmm%nmnmm%nmnmWild type22.410.22.22003373504.12003423476.4200339349W6019.5813533504.41673423475.862333348W9525.511.12.39.31063313483.6353423486.5124339351W399.213.10.76.833484.2173474.869331350W3318.012.01.514.61073493504.727337350W4911.6663443494.2113484.972338349W7815.88.81.810.5783253494.283486.447338349a The free energy change of unfolding in the absence of denaturant (ΔGU,H20) and a measure for cooperativity of unfolding (m) as described by Equation 3.b Midpoint denaturant concentration of unfolding.c Distance between the Cα of the Trp residue and the center of the Cys25-Cys80 disulfide bond, which was calculated from the coordinate of wild-type β2-m (PDB ID code 2D4F).d Relative fluorescence spectral area of Trp among various mutants in the same conformational states where those of the wild-type β2-m with two Trp residues were defined to be 200%.e Maximal wavelength of Trp fluorescence in the native state (λN), denatured state (λD), or amyloid fibrils (λf).

B and C, amyloid fibrils at pH 2.5 (B) and pH 7.0 (C). The spectra of wild-type β2-m and W39-β2-m, as an example of the mutants, in 5.5 m Gdn-HCl at pH 8.0 (A) or pH2.5 (B), or in 10 m urea at pH 7.0 (C) are also shown with dotted lines and dash-dot lines, respectively. The locations of Trp residues in mutants are indicated by residue number. Under the respective conditions, the spectra were normalized assuming that the maximal fluorescence intensity of each single Trp mutant in the unfolded state is the same, and half that of wild-type β2-m with two Trp residues. Simulated spectra (dashed lines)of wild-type β2-m assuming the sum of those of W60- and W95-β2-ms are indicated. Diagrams to the right show the extents of burial of Trp side chain and fluorescence quenching observed for each mutant, mapped on the secondary structures of native β2-m. The thresholds for the degree of burial are blue, λmax < 330 nm; right blue, 330 nm < λmax < 340 nm; pink, 340 nm < λmax < 345 nm; and red, 345 nm < λmax. The degree of quenching, considering λmax and fluorescence intensity, is represented by the circles in three sizes. Asterisks for the labels of W33- and W39-β2-ms at pH 2.5 and W33-, W39-, and W49-β2-ms at pH 7.0 indicate the altered kinetics of fibril formation or no fibril formation (i.e. W33 at pH 7.0).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) W39-β2-m is a triple mutant in which Trp60 and Trp95 were replaced by Phe, and Leu39, the position of the conserved Trp residue common to many immunoglobulin domains, was replaced by Trp. The fluorescence spectrum of W39-β2-m exhibited complete quenching in the absence of Gdn-HCl (Fig. 2A). These observations are consistent with an immunoglobulin domain having a Trp residue at the corresponding position (19Tsunenaga M. Goto Y. Kawata Y. Hamaguchi K. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6044-6051Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 20Goto Y. Ichimura N. Hamaguchi K. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1670-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), in which the fluorescence of the conserved Trp is quenched by the disulfide bond. A cooperative change in fluorescence intensity was observed with an increase in the concentration of Gdn-HCl, suggesting that W39-β2-m assumes the native fold in the absence of Gdn-HCl (see below). Other mutants studied were W33-, W49-, and W78-β2-ms (Fig. 3A, see supplemental Fig. S2). With an increase in the Gdn-HCl concentration, the fluorescence of W33-β2-m showed no shift in λmax, and the intensity decreased slightly, indicating that Trp33 is exposed. The Trp fluorescence of W49-β2-m showed a slight shift in the λmax toward a longer wavelength and a slight increase in intensity, indicating that Trp49 is partly buried and slightly quenched. The Gdn-HCl-induced spectral change of W78-β2-m was similar to that of wild-type β2-m, although the λmax of the native state was shorter than that of the wild type. The result indicates that Trp78 of W78-β2-m is more buried than Trp95 of the wild type. Altogether, the fluorescence spectra of the single Trp mutants are consistent with the location of mutated residues in the x-ray native structure (Fig. 1), arguing that these mutants provide excellent probes with which to monitor the conformational change upon the formation of fibrils. The Gdn-HCl-induced unfolding transitions were constructed on the basis of the spectral change (Fig. 4). In the cases of W49- and W60-β2-ms, we could not obtain a transition curve because the location of the Trp residues on the surface resulted in no significant spectral change upon unfolding. For other mutants, it has been revealed that the stability decreased to various extents in comparison with that of the wild type. In particular, the destabilization was significant for W39-β2-m. It is conceivable that the replacement of Leu39 located in the tightly packed interior of β2-m by bulky Trp induced significant steric hindrance. Thus, it is important to confirm the native fold of W39-β2-m. X-ray Crystallographic Structures—We determined the crystallographic structures of wild-type and W39-β2-ms (Fig. 5) using the molecular replacement method on the basis of the monomeric crystal structure prepared at pH 5.7 (12Trinh C.H.

Both crystals belong to space group C2 and the unit cell dimensions are a = 77.6 Å, b = 28.8 Å, c = 54.8 Å, and β = 121.7° for the wild-type and a = 77.4 Å, b = 28.8 Å, c = 57.2 Å, and β = 123.6° for W39-β2-m. A summary of the refinement statistics is given in Table 2. The coordinates and structure factor amplitudes have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (ID code 2D4F for the wild-type and 2D4D for W39-β2-m). Our structure of wild-type β2-m at pH 5.6 without a bulge in the βD strand is basically the same as that previously reported (12Trinh C.H. Smith D.P. Kalverda A.P. Phillips E.V. Radford S.E. Proc.

We have previously demonstrated that c-Jun is a substrate of Itch, a HECT-type E3 ubiquitin ligase. c-Jun is also a substrate of the tyrosine kinase c-Abl. Here we report that genetic ablation of c-Abl accelerated c-Jun degradation. Phosphorylation of the tyrosine within the PPXY motif by c-Abl inhibited c-Jun ubiquitination and its binding by Itch. The nuclear localization of c-Abl, triggered by T-cell activation signals, was essential for its activity in regulating c-Jun transcription activity. These findings define a potential molecular mechanism for the immunodeficiency in mice lacking the c-abl gene.

Many proteins can be modified by several different posttranslational modifications (1Gao M. Karin M. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 581-593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The effects of different modifications on each other provide potential mechanisms for integration of stimuli from different signal transduction pathways. c-Jun is a substrate for ubiquitination by the HECT (homologous of E6 C terminus)-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, Itch, which regulates the stability and therefore the steady-state level of c-Jun in the cell (2Fang D.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14782-14787Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Protein ubiquitination requires a cascade of at least three different enzymatic reactions. First, ubiquitin is activated by E1, the ubiquitin-activating enzyme. Next, ubiquitin is transiently transferred to E2, the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. Finally, an E3 ubiquitin ligase transfers the activated ubiquitin molecule from the E2 to a lysine residue on the substrate (4Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6907) Google Scholar). Several different E3 ubiquitin ligases have been shown to contribute to c-Jun ubiquitination (3Fang D. Kerppola T.K. Proc.

In neurons the stability of c-Jun is regulated by the E3 ligase SCFFbw7, which ubiquitinates c-Jun and facilitates c-Jun degradation. SCFFbw7-induced c-Jun ubiquitination is regulated by JNK 2The abbreviations used are: JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; HECT, homologous of E6 C terminus; TCR, T-cell receptor; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; IL-2, interleukin 2; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin; SH, Src homology; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase. -mediated serine/threonine phosphorylation of c-Jun (7Nateri A.S. Riera-Sans L. Da Costa C. Behrens A. Science. 2004; 303: 1374-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). We previously found that c-Jun is ubiquitinated by Itch (3Fang D. Kerppola T.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14782-14787Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 5Gao M. Labuda T. Xia Y. Gallagher E. Fang D. Liu Y.C. Karin M. Science. 2004; 306: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). c-Jun is also a substrate for phosphorylation by the tyrosine kinase c-Abl (8Barila D. Mangano R. Gonfloni S. Kretzschmar J. Moro M. Bohmann D. Superti-Furga G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Jun up-regulates the activations of both JNK and c-Abl in the nucleus. The site of c-Jun phosphorylation on tyrosine 170 occurs within the PPXY recognition motif for Itch. This suggested the possibility that phosphorylation by c-Abl may regulate c-Jun ubiquitination by Itch. c-Abl is a ubiquitously expressed nonreceptor tyrosine kinase. Numerous studies have demonstrated that c-Abl is responsive both to extracellular signals, such as growth factors, cell adhesion, and cytokines, and internal signals, such as DNA damage and oxidative stress, in regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (9Wang J.Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 3-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 10Hantschel O. Superti-Furga G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). The c-Abl protein is comprised of multiple domains including Src homology (SH) 3, SH2, and SH1 (catalytic) domains, proline-rich sequences that bind SH3-containing molecules, nuclear localization and export signals, and DNA and actin binding domains (10Hantschel O. Superti-Furga G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 11Mayer B.J. Jackson P.K. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 1991; 66: 161-171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The c-Abl kinase localizes to the cytosol, membrane, cytoskeleton, and nucleus. Both the localization and kinase activity of c-Abl are regulated within the cell (10Hantschel O. Superti-Furga G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 13Wong S. Witte O.N. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 22: 247-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Nuclear localization of c-Abl plays important roles in the regulation of growth, apoptosis, and DNA repair. These functions of nuclear c-Abl require its cross-talk with many nuclear proteins, such as the ataxia telangiectasia gene product, the RB, and p53 (14Kharbanda S. Pandey P. Morris P.L. Whang Y. Xu Y. Sawant S. Zhu L.J. Kumar N. Yuan Z.M. Weichselbaum R. Sawyers C.L. Pandita T.K. Kufe D. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1773-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 15Van Etten R.A.

It has been implicated that c-Abl might play a role in T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling because targeted disruption of the Abl1 gene in mice resulted in animals that had splenic and thymic atrophy and cell-autonomous lymphopenia (16Schwartzberg P.L.

Pendergast A.M. Curr.

However, the roles of nuclear c-Abl in the modulation of immune functions remain to be defined. Here we report that phosphorylation of c-Jun at tyrosine 170 by c-Abl kinase inhibited Itch binding to c-Jun and protected c-Jun from Itch-induced ubiquitination and degradation. Conversely, c-Abl deficiency accelerated c-Jun degradation and suppressed T-cell activation. Ablation of the Itch gene and inhibition of Itch activity abrogated the effects of c-Abl on c-Jun ubiquitination and T-cell activation. Expression of an Itch mutant lacking E3 ubiquitin ligase activity stabilized c-Jun in c-Abl-deficient T cells and reversed T-cell activation. Antibodies, Plasmids, and Mice—Anti-Xpress was purchased from Roche (Nutley, NJ), anti-HA and anti-Myc were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (Santa Cruz, CA), anti-GST, anti-Itch, anti-phospho-tyrosine (4G10), anti-CD3, and anti-CD28 were from BD Biosciences. pEF-Jun, pEF-Itch, and pMIG-Itch/CA plasmids were constructed as reported earlier (2Fang D.

Mice heterozygous for c-Abl were a generous gift from Steve Goff (Columbia University, New York, NY) (16Schwartzberg P.L. Stall A.M. Hardin J.D. Bowdish K.S. Humaran T. Boast S. Harbison M.L.

Copeland N.G. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 143-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) were generated in Yun-Cai Liu's laboratory (La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology, San Diego, CA). Transfection, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blotting—Transient transfections were performed by using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, with 2–5 μg of total DNA/transfection. Transfected cells were pelleted and resuspended in 1× Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm NaPiP, 2 mm Na3VO4, and 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin). Cells were lysed for 10 min at 4 °C, and insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g (4 °C, 10 min). For immunoprecipitation, lysates (∼1 × 107 cells) were mixed with antibodies (1 μg) for 2 h, followed by the addition of 30 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for an additional 2 h at 4°C. Immunoprecipitates were washed four times with 1× Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and boiled in 20 μl of 2× Laemmli's buffer. Samples were subjected to 8 or 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis and electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Membranes were probed with the indicated primary antibodies (usually 1 μg/ml), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Membranes were then washed and visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (ECL; Amersham Biosciences). When necessary, membranes were stripped by incubation in stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 5.7, 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 2% SDS) for 1 h at 70 °C with constant agitation, washed, and then reprobed with other antibodies as indicated. GST Fusion Protein Pulldown Assays—GST pulldown assay was performed as described previously (2Fang D. Elly C. Gao B. Fang N. Altman Y. Joazeiro C. Hunter T. Copeland N. Jenkins N. Liu Y.C. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). GST-ItchWW was bound to glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) and incubated for 2 h with lysates of transfected HEK293 cells. Beads were washed three times in GST wash buffer (250 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and analyzed by immunoblotting. Primary T-cell Proliferation and IL-2 Production—Primary T cells were isolated from the lymph nodes of 4–5-week-old Abl+/+ and Abl–/– mice. T cells were left unstimulated or stimulated with anti-CD3, anti-CD28, or both for various time periods. To determine cell proliferation, primary T cells (1 × 106 cells/well) were stimulated with anti-CD3, anti-CD28, or both for 24 h, pulsed with 1 μCi/ml of [3H]thymidine, and incubated for an additional 12 h. [3H]thymidine incorporation was measured with a scintillation counter. For measurement of cytokine production, culture supernatants from the stimulated cells described above were collected and the concentrations of IL-2 were analyzed by ELISA. For the gene delivery to mouse primary T cells by retroviral infection, virus was produced by transfection of pMIG-Itch/CA plasmids into a packaging cell line, Plat-E (20Morita S. Kojima T. Kitamura T. Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 1063-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar); the supernatant was used to incubate with mouse primary T cells in the presence of anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28. Statistical Analysis—All values are presented as the mean ± S.D. Statistical analysis was performed with Student's t test using SPSS software. p < 0.05 was considered as significant. c-Jun Degradation Is Affected by c-Abl Expression—c-Jun contains a PPXY consensus recognition sequence for the E3 ligase Itch. The tyrosine residue in this sequence is essential for Itch binding and ubiquitination of c-Jun (2Fang D. Elly C. Gao B. Fang N. Altman Y. Joazeiro C. Hunter T. Copeland N. Jenkins N. Liu Y.C. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 3Fang D. Kerppola T.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14782-14787Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The same tyrosine residue is a site for phosphorylation by c-Abl (8Barila D. Mangano R. Gonfloni S. Kretzschmar J. Moro M. Bohmann D. Superti-Furga G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the hypothesis that phosphorylation of this tyrosine by c-Abl affected c-Jun ubiquitination by Itch and the rate of c-Jun degradation. To investigate the potential influence of c-Abl on c-Jun stability, we compared the rates of c-Jun degradation in the primary T cells from wild-type mice and from mice lacking the gene encoding c-Abl (Fig. 1A). The cells were activated by treatment with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28, and the rate of c-Jun turnover was measured by addition of cycloheximide following stimulation. In wild-type primary T cells, c-Jun was degraded with a half-life of 1.6 ± 0.3 h, consistent with previous results (2Fang D. Elly C. Gao B. Fang N. Altman Y. Joazeiro C. Hunter T. Copeland N. Jenkins N. Liu Y.C. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). In cells lacking c-Abl, c-Jun degradation was accelerated almost 2-fold, resulting in a half-life of 0.9 ± 0.2 h (p < 0.05). As a control, the degradation of the transcription factor NF-κB was comparable between the wild-type and c-Abl–/– T cells (p > 0.1). These results indicate that the loss of c-Abl destabilizes c-Jun in primary T cells. We also found that c-Abl was degraded during T-cell activation with a half-life of 1.1 h, indicating that c-Abl may also be degraded during T-cell activation. In support of our data, previous study has demonstrated that c-Abl is a substrate for ubiquitination-mediated degradation (21Echarri A. Pendergast A.M. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1759-1765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To determine whether the difference in c-Jun degradation in these cells was due to the change in c-Abl activity, we examined the effects of c-Abl-PP, a double proline mutation (P242E,P249E) that confers constitutive activity to c-Abl, and the kinase-dead mutation of c-Abl (c-Abl/KM) on the degradation of co-expressed c-Jun in HEK293T cells (Fig. 1B). The half-life of c-Jun was extended from 1.1 ± 0.3 h to 3.2 ± 0.7 h by overexpression of constitutively active c-Abl (p < 0.05 against control). In contrast, expression of dominant negative c-Abl reduced the half-life of c-Jun 2-fold to 0.6 ± 0.1 h (p < 0.01 against control). Thus, manipulations of c-Abl activity in HEK293 cells changed the half-life of c-Jun in a manner consistent with the change observed in primary T cells lacking the c-Abl gene. There are numerous pathways whereby changes in c-Abl activity might affect c-Jun degradation. To investigate whether the changes in the rate of c-Jun degradation caused by manipulations of c-Abl activity required the tyrosine residue in c-Jun that can be phosphorylated by c-Abl and that is required for recognition by Itch, we examined the effects of the same manipulations on the stability of c-Jun in which this tyrosine was substituted by a phenylalanine (c-JunY170F). The mutated c-Jun protein exhibited almost 3-fold slower degradation than wild-type c-Jun (p < 0.05). Moreover, the expression of either the constitutively active or dominant negative c-Abl caused little change in the half-life of the c-JunY170F protein (p > 0.1) (Fig. 1B). The effects of the manipulations of c-Abl activity on c-Jun degradation therefore required the tyrosine residue that is the site of c-Jun phosphorylation by c-Abl and a critical determinant of Itch recognition of c-Jun. c-Abl Inhibits c-Jun Ubiquitination by Itch—We have previously demonstrated that ubiquitination plays a central role in c-Jun degradation (2Fang D. Elly C. Gao B. Fang N. Altman Y. Joazeiro C. Hunter T. Copeland N. Jenkins N. Liu Y.C. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 3Fang D. Kerppola T.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14782-14787Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar); c-Abl may therefore stabilize c-Jun by inhibiting c-Jun ubiquitination. We investigated whether the manipulations of c-Abl activity in HEK293 cells altered c-Jun ubiquitination. An in vivo ubiquitination assay was performed as described previously (2Fang D. Elly C. Gao B. Fang N. Altman Y. Joazeiro C. Hunter T. Copeland N. Jenkins N. Liu Y.C. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 3Fang D. Kerppola T.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14782-14787Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). When Xpress-Jun expression plasmid was co-transfected with HA-tagged ubiquitin, higher molecular weight ladders were detected in the immunoprecipitates with anti-Xpress antibody that reflects c-Jun ubiquitination. Overexpression of Itch further enhanced c-Jun ubiquitination (supplemental Fig. S1). Those data further confirm our previous findings that Itch is an E3 ubiquitin ligase of c-Jun (2Fang D. Elly C. Gao B. Fang N. Altman Y. Joazeiro C. Hunter T. Copeland N. Jenkins N. Liu Y.C. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 3Fang D. Kerppola T.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14782-14787Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We then used this in a ubiquitination assay to determine the effect of c-Abl on Itch-mediated c-Jun ubiquitination. The co-expression of constitutively active c-Abl partially inhibited c-Jun ubiquitination. In contrast, co-expression of dominant negative c-Abl dramatically increased the amount of high molecular weight forms of Jun (Fig. 2A). The effects of c-Abl activity on the rate of c-Jun degradation were therefore likely caused by inhibition of c-Jun ubiquitination. Several different E3 ligases have been identified that can mediate c-Jun ubiquitination (3Fang D. Kerppola T.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14782-14787Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 5Gao M. Labuda T. Xia Y. Gallagher E. Fang D. Liu Y.C. Karin M. Science. 2004; 306: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 6Wertz I.E. O'Rourke K.M. Zhang Z. Dornan D. Arnott D. Deshaies R.J. Dixit V.M. Science. 2004; 303: 1371-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The E3 ligase Itch recognizes a PPXY motif overlapping the site of c-Jun phosphorylation by c-Abl. We tested whether the changes in c-Jun ubiquitination caused by manipulations of c-Abl activity were mediated by Itch by comparing the effects of co-expression of constitutively active and dominant negative c-Abl in MEFS from wild-type mice and from mice lacking the gene encoding Itch (Fig. 2B). In wild-type MEFS, the expression of constitutively active c-Abl inhibited c-Jun ubiquitination, whereas expression of dominant negative c-Abl enhanced c-Jun ubiquitination, similar to the results obtained in HEK293 cells. In contrast, in MEFS lacking the gene encoding Itch, there was no detectable effect of the expression of either constitutively active or dominant negative c-Abl on the efficiency of c-Jun ubiquitination. Itch was therefore required for the changes in c-Jun ubiquitination induced by manipulations of c-Abl activity. Recently, it has been reported that another member of Src kinases, Fyn, negatively regulates the E3 ligase activity of Itch via a direct interaction and phosphorylation of Itch (22Yang C. Zhou W. Jeon M.S. Demydenko D. Harada Y. Zhou H. Liu Y.C. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 135-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To test whether c-Abl inhibits Itch-mediated c-Jun ubiquitination via a similar mechanism, we examined whether c-Abl can also induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of Itch. Itch tyrosine phosphorylation was detected in HEK293 cells; overexpression of c-Abl or its mutants did not affect Itch phosphorylation (Fig. 2C). These results indicate that Itch is not a direct substrate of c-Abl. c-Abl Inhibits c-Jun-Itch Interaction—To investigate the molecular mechanisms of c-Abl in protecting c-Jun from ubiquitination-induced degradation, we further tested the effects of c-Abl on the interaction of c-Jun with Itch. c-Jun was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates obtained from HEK293 cells that had been transfected with kinase-competent or kinase-inactive forms of c-Abl together with Itch and c-Jun. The interaction of Itch with c-Jun was determined by co-immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. As we demonstrated previously (2Fang D. Elly C. Gao B. Fang N. Altman Y. Joazeiro C. Hunter T. Copeland N. Jenkins N. Liu Y.C. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 3Fang D. Kerppola T.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14782-14787Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), Itch was detected in the anti-c-Jun immunoprecipitate (Fig. 3A, lane 1), indicating that Itch interacts with c-Jun. Co-expression of c-Abl/KM further enhanced the interaction of Itch and c-Jun (lane 2), whereas c-Abl-PP inhibited their interaction (lane 3). Therefore, c-Abl inhibited c-Jun ubiquitination by suppressing the interaction of c-Jun with its E3 ubiquitin ligase Itch, and the inhibitory effect of c-Abl required its kinase activity. c-Jun has been identified as a direct substrate of c-Abl tyrosine kinase (8Barila D. Mangano R. Gonfloni S. Kretzschmar J. Moro M. Bohmann D. Superti-Furga G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), suggesting that this phosphorylation event may be required for c-Abl in the inhibition of c-Jun ubiquitination and c-Jun-Itch interaction. To test this, we first confirmed c-Abl-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Jun (8Barila D. Mangano R. Gonfloni S. Kretzschmar J. Moro M. Bohmann D. Superti-Furga G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). c-Jun is phosphorylated at a very low level in HEK293 cells (Fig. 3B, lane 1), whereas overexpression of c-Abl slightly enhanced c-Jun phosphorylation (lane 2). In the presence of c-Abl/KM, the phosphorylation level of c-Jun is not detectable (lane 3), which is possibly due to the dominant negative effects of c-Abl/KM in competition with the endogenous c-Abl in c-Jun phosphorylation. Expression of the constitutively active form of c-Abl, c-Abl-PP, dramatically increased c-Jun phosphorylation (lane 4). Even in the presence of c-Abl-PP, mutation of the tyrosine 170 to phenylalanine of c-Jun, Jun/YF, completely abolished c-Jun tyrosine phosphorylation (lane 5), which indicated that tyrosine 170 is the phosphorylation site for c-Abl (8Barila D. Mangano R. Gonfloni S. Kretzschmar J. Moro M. Bohmann D. Superti-Furga G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). These results further confirmed that c-Abl is a kinase for c-Jun phosphorylation, which suggests that suppression of c-Jun ubiquitination and its interaction with Itch by c-Abl requires phosphorylation of the tyrosine 170 of c-Jun. We next employed a GST fusion protein pulldown assay to test whether these c-Jun proteins that interacted with Itch are phosphorylated. The GST pulldown was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using anti-c-Jun (Fig. 3C, top panel) and anti-p-Y antibodies (middle panel). c-Jun was pulled down by GST-ItchWW fusion protein but not GST-only controls (top panel). However, the tyrosine-phosphorylated c-Jun was detected in the anti-c-Jun immunoprecipitates but not in the precipitates of GST-ItchWW fusion (Fig. 3C, middle panel, lanes 1 and 3). These results indicate conclusively that the E3 ubiquitin ligase can only recognize non-phosphorylated c-Jun, which suggests c-Abl-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation inhibited the interaction of c-Jun with Itch. TCR Signaling Mediates the Nucleus Translocation of c-Abl in T Cells—Previous study demonstrated that the nuclear translocation of c-Abl is required for c-Jun phosphorylation (8Barila D. Mangano R. Gonfloni S. Kretzschmar J. Moro M. Bohmann D. Superti-Furga G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To determine the signals that regulate the nuclear translocation of c-Abl in T cells, we examined the effects of activation signals on the nuclear translocation of c-Abl in mouse primary T cells. Purified T cells were stimulated without or with anti-CD3 or anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 for 2 h. Subcellular fractionation was then performed using these stimulated T cells. cAMP-response element-binding protein protein, a nuclear protein (23Yamamoto K.K. Gonzalez G.A. Biggs W.H. II I Montminy M.R. Nature. 1988; 334: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar), was detected in the nuclear fraction and α-tubulin, a protein that localizes in the cytoplasm (24Banerjee A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5438-5446Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), was only detected in the cytoplasmic fraction (Fig. 4A). The protein levels of c-Abl in either cytoplasm or nucleus were analyzed by Western blotting. Very low level of c-Abl was detected in the nucleus from naïve T cells (Fig. 4A, lane 1). Stimulation of mouse primary T cells with anti-CD3 antibody for 2 h significantly accumulated c-Abl into nucleus (lane 2). The nucleus translocation of c-Abl was not further enhanced by anti-CD28 stimulation (lane 3). Thus, the nuclear translocation of c-Abl is triggered by TCR signaling in T cells. To test whether the nuclear translocation of c-Abl induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Jun, a protein that predominantly localizes in the nuclei (3Fang D. Kerppola T.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14782-14787Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), we immunoprecipitated c-Jun from mouse primary T cells after stimulation and detected its tyrosine-phosphorylated form with anti-phospho-tyrosine. As shown in Fig. 4B, the tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Jun was at very low level in naïve T cells from c-Abl+/+ mice, and anti-CD3 stimulation significantly enhanced c-Jun phosphorylation. Consistent with the c-Abl nuclear translocation data, anti-CD28 did not further enhance c-Jun tyrosine phosphorylation. The tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Jun in c-Abl–/– T cells was still detectable but significantly reduced. These results indicate that c-Abl is a kinase that mediates c-Jun tyrosine phosphorylation and TCR signaling is required for c-Abl-induced c-Jun tyrosine phosphorylation. We next examined whether the T-cell activation signals affect the interaction of c-Jun with Itch. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the interaction of c-Jun with Itch in wild-type and in c-Abl–/– T cells during T-cell activation. As shown in Fig. 4B, the interaction of c-Jun with Itch was comparable in naïve T cells between wild type and c-Abl–/–. Interestingly, when these T cells were stimulated with anti-CD3 or anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28, the interaction of c-Jun with Itch was reduced in c-Abl+/+ T cells, whereas it increased in c-Abl–/– T cells. Thus, c-Abl inhibited c-Jun ubiquitination by blocking Jun-Itch interaction during T-cell activation. Furthermore, we found that c-Abl enhanced c-Jun transcription activity using luciferase assay. As shown in Fig. 4C, expression of the constitutively active form of c-Abl dramatically increased AP-1 reporter. The kinase mutant of c-Abl inhibited c-Jun transcription activity, probably because c-Abl/KM competed with endogenous c-Abl in activating c-Jun. Therefore, c-Abl is a positive regulator for c-Jun transcription activity. Importantly, sequestration of c-Abl-PP by mutation of its nuclear translocation sequence, Abl-PP-Cyt, failed in activating AP-1 reporter. These results suggested that nucleus translocation of c-Abl was required for c-Jun transcription activation, possibly by protecting c-Jun from Itch-mediated degradation. c-Abl Regulates T-cell Activation through Itch—Previous studies have delineated that c-Abl is required for T-cell activation (25Hardin J.D. Boast S. Schwartzberg P.L. Lee G. Alt F.W. Stall A.M. Goff S.P. Cell. Immunol. 1996; 172: 100-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To investigate the molecular mechanisms of c-Abl in regulating the immune functions, we first confirmed the effects of c-Abl deficiency on the activation of T cells. c-Abl-deficient T cells showed a decreased cell proliferation and IL-2 production in response to either anti-CD3 or anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 stimulation when compared with wild-type T cells (Fig. 5, A and B). The differences of IL-2 production from c-Abl–/– and wild-type T cells were greater when these T cells were cultured for longer times (supplemental Fig. S2). These results further confirmed that c-Abl is required for T-cell activation. Interestingly, c-Abl-deficient T cells showed slightly decreased IL-2 production in response to PMA and ionomycin stimulation, particularly when these T cells were stimulated with PMA plus ionomycin at low concentration (Fig. 5C). Because PMA directly activates protein kinase (27Kraft A.S. Anderson W.B. Nature. 1983; 301: 621-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar) and ionomycin forms a lipid-soluble calcium complex to convey Ca2+ across the hydrocarbon region of the cell membrane (28Bennett J.P. Cockcroft S. Gomperts B.D. Nature. 1979; 282: 851-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), PMA plus ionomycin stimulation activates T cells bypassing the upstream signal molecules. These results suggest that downstream signal molecules or transcription factors are involved in c-Abl-mediated T-cell activation, which further supports our finding here that c-Abl regulates T-cell activation by stabilizing c-Jun transcription factor. Because c-Abl-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Jun inhibits Itch-induced c-Jun ubiquitination, we then asked whether inhibition of Itch E3 activity rescues T-cell activation of c-Abl–/– T cells. To this end, we infected both wild-type and c-Abl–/– T cells with retrovirus that carries a dominant negative mutant of Itch, Itch/CA (2Fang D. Elly C. Gao B. Fang N. Altman Y. Joazeiro C. Hunter T. Copeland N. Jenkins N. Liu Y.C. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The retrovirus that carries GFP only was used as a control. GFP-positive T cells were sorted 48 h after infection. IL-2 production from these sorted T cells was analyzed upon stimulation with anti-CD3 or anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28. As shown in Fig. 5D, expression of Itch/CA in Abl+/+ T cells slightly up-regulated IL-2 production, which further confirmed our previous findings that Itch is a negative regulator for T-cell activation (2Fang D. Elly C. Gao B. Fang N. Altman Y. Joazeiro C. Hunter T. Copeland N. Jenkins N. Liu Y.C. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Expression of Itch/CA in Abl–/– T cells significantly increased the IL-2 production to the level of that produced from Abl+/+ T cells (p < 0.01). Moreover, expression of c-Jun/Y170F mutant also rescued IL-2 production from c-Abl–/– T cells. These results suggest that c-Abl regulates T-cell activation through Itch. The tyrosine 170 of c-Jun is the receptor for c-Abl-mediated phosphorylation, which also locates within the recognition site, PPXY, of Itch. Therefore, we further asked whether expression of the Y170F mutant of c-Jun rescues the activation of c-Abl–/– T cells. As shown in Fig. 5E, expression of c-Jun/Y170F in Abl+/+ T cells up-regulated IL-2 production. Expression of c-Jun/Y170F mutant significantly enhanced IL-2 production from c-Abl–/– cells to a level that was comparable with that produced from wild-type T cells. These results indicate that inhibition of c-Abl-mediated phosphorylation and Itch interaction of c-Jun rescue the activation of c-Abl–/– T cells. In this report, we have demonstrated an essential role of c-Abl tyrosine kinase in T-cell activation. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the transcription factor c-Jun by c-Abl protects c-Jun from Itch-mediated ubiquitination and degradation. Loss of c-Abl expression results in elevated c-Jun degradation and therefore reduced T-cell activation. These findings uncovered, at least partially, the molecular mechanisms regarding why the loss of function of c-Abl causes immune deficiency of mice (17Tybulewicz V.L. Crawford C.E. Jackson P.K. Bronson R.T. Mulligan R.C. Cell. 1991; 65: 1153-1163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar). Protein ubiquitination and phosphorylation are two of the most common systems of posttranslational modifications that are involved in many different facets of cellular regulations (1Gao M. Karin M. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 581-593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Extracellular stimuli often affect ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis by inducing target protein phosphorylation, which confers recognition by E3 ligases. We have demonstrated that JNK regulates Itch-dependent c-Jun and JunB polyubiquitination and turnover by phosphorylation of Itch (5Gao M. Labuda T. Xia Y. Gallagher E. Fang D. Liu Y.C. Karin M. Science. 2004; 306: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). A recent study revealed JNK activates Itch E3 ligase by the phosphorylation-induced conformational change (29Gallagher E. Gao M. Liu Y.C. Karin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 1717-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation within the PPXY motif has been identified to prevent its reorganization by WW domains of many proteins (30Sudol M. Hunter T. Cell. 2000; 103: 1001-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of p53-binding protein negatively regulates its interaction with a WW domain-containing Yes-associated protein during DNA damage (31Espanel X. Sudol M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14514-14523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Here we found that c-Abl-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Jun protects c-Jun from Itch-mediated ubiquitination and degradation. HECT domain-containing E3 ligases, with a few notable exceptions (such as E6-AP), contain multiple (generally 3–4) WW domains (32Ingham R.J. Gish G. Pawson T. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 1972-1984Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Therefore, inhibition of the interaction between the WW domains and the PPXY motifs by this tyrosine phosphorylation event may be a common regulatory mechanism in HECT-type E3-mediated protein ubiquitination. c-Abl has both nuclear localization and nuclear export sequences. The nuclear translocation of c-Abl is required for phosphorylation of c-Jun at the tyrosine residue. Several groups have reported that c-Abl localizes to both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Cytoplasmic c-Abl associates with F-actin bundles and focal adhesions, which act as peripheral docking sites for the F-actin bundles. Nuclear c-Abl regulates cell cycle progression and cellular responses to genotoxic stress. Nuclear translocation of c-Abl is required for c-Jun phosphorylation, whereas the molecular mechanisms in regulating c-Abl nuclear translocation remain unknown. It has been reported that c-Abl transits from the nucleus to the cytoplasm following fibroblast adhesion to fibronectin (33Lewis J.M. Baskaran R. Taagepera S. Schwartz M.A. Wang J.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15174-15179Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). More recently, Yoshida et al. (38Yoshida K. Yamaguchi T. Natsume T. Kufe D. Miki Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 7: 278-285Crossref Scopus (205) Google Scholar) reported that c-Abl is sequestered into the cytoplasm by binding to 14-3-3 proteins. Activation of the JNK induces phosphorylation of 14-3-3 proteins and their release from c-Abl that allows c-Abl to translocate into nucleus in response to DNA damage (34Yoshida K. Miki Y. Cell Cycle. 2005; 4: 777-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Our findings here demonstrated that the nuclear translocation of c-Abl requires TCR stimulation and plays important roles in T-cell activation. TCR stimulation activates JNK; it will be interesting to investigate whether a similar mechanism exists in T cells in regulating c-Abl nuclear translocation. Previous studies have suggested that c-Abl is required for full activation of T and B cells in mice (25Hardin J.D. Boast S. Schwartzberg P.L. Lee G. Alt F.W. Stall A.M. Goff S.P. Cell. Immunol. 1996; 172: 100-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 35Hardin J.D. Boast S. Schwartzberg P.L. Lee G. Alt F.W. Stall A.M. Goff S.P. Cell. Immunol. 1995; 165: 44-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Targeted disruption of the c-abl gene in mice results in increased susceptibility to bacterial infections in lung and intestine that cause death of these mice at a weaning age (16Schwartzberg P.L. Stall A.M. Hardin J.D. Bowdish K.S. Humaran T. Boast S. Harbison M.L. Robertson E.J. Goff S.P. Cell. 1991; 65: 1165-1175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). We found that the activation of c-Abl–/– T cells was impaired significantly during the prolonged cultivation (supplemental Fig. S2). In humans, some chronic myeloid leukemia patients treated with c-Abl inhibitor STI-571 become immunosuppressed and develop varicella zoster virus infection (36Mattiuzzi G.N. Cortes J.E. Talpaz M. Reuben J. Rios M.B. Shan J. Kontoyiannis D. Giles F.J. Raad I. Verstovsek S. Ferrajoli A. Kantarjian H.M. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 976-980PubMed Google Scholar). Further investigation showed that slightly decreased numbers and reduced activation of both T and B lymphocytes are likely responsible for the immunodeficiency of c-Abl-deficient mice and humans receiving STI-571 (37Peng B. Hayes M. Resta D. Racine-Poon A. Druker B.J. Talpaz M. Sawyers C.L. Rosamilia M. Ford J. Lloyd P. Capdeville R. J. Clin. Oncol. 2004; 22: 935-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Recent studies by Zipfel et al. (18Zipfel P.A. Zhang W. Quiroz M. Pendergast A.M. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1222-1231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) demonstrated that Abl kinases regulate T-cell activation by directly phosphorylating Zap70 and the transmembrane adaptor linker for activation of T cells. These findings support our data that sequestration of the constitutively active form of c-Abl still partially activates AP-1 reporter. Therefore, both the cytoplasmic and the nuclear forms of c-Abl are involved in T-cell activation. Once translocated into the nucleus by TCR stimulation, c-Abl protects c-Jun by the phosphorylation of the tyrosine 170 and inhibits Itch-mediated ubiquitination. We thank Drs. Steve Goff (Columbia University, New York, NY) for c-Abl-deficient mice, Giulio Superti-Furga (European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany) for c-Abl and its mutant expression plasmids, and Yun-Cai Liu (La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology, San Diego, CA) for Itch+/+ and Itch–/– fibroblasts.

https://openalex.org/W2082047060,"N-Methylpurine-DNA glycosylase (MPG) initiates base excision repair in DNA by removing a wide variety of alkylated, deaminated, and lipid peroxidation-induced purine adducts. MPG activity and other DNA glycosylases do not have an absolute requirement for a cofactor. In contrast, all downstream activities of major base excision repair proteins, such as apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease, DNA polymerase β, and ligases, require Mg2+. Here we have demonstrated that Mg2+ can be significantly inhibitory toward MPG activity depending on its concentration but independent of substrate type. The pre-steady-state kinetics suggests that Mg2+ at high but physiologic concentrations decreases the amount of active enzyme concentrations. Steady-state inhibition kinetics showed that Mg2+ affected Km, but not Vmax, and the inhibition could be reversed by EDTA but not by DNA. At low concentration, Mg2+ stimulated the enzyme activity only with hypoxanthine but not ethenoadenine. Real-time binding experiments using surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy showed that the pronounced inhibition of activity was due to inhibition in substrate binding. Nonetheless, the glycosidic bond cleavage step was not affected. These results altogether suggest that Mg2+ inhibits MPG activity by abrogating substrate binding. Because Mg2+ is an absolute requirement for the downstream activities of the major base excision repair enzymes, it may act as a regulator for the base excision repair pathway for efficient and balanced repair of damaged bases, which are often less toxic and/or mutagenic than their subsequent repair product intermediates.

Cellular DNA is continuously exposed to endogenous or exogenous chemical or physical agents that induce DNA lesions. DNA base damage threatens genomic stability and cellular viability. Multiple DNA repair pathways exist in all organisms, from bacteria to humans, to preserve the integrity of the genome (1Lindahl T. Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (4271) Google Scholar). If not repaired, damaged bases could be mutagenic (2Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D.C.1995: 59Google Scholar) and/or cause cell death by blocking DNA replication (3Larson K. Sharn J. Shenkar R. Strauss B. Mutat. Res. 1985; 233: 211-218Google Scholar). In all organisms, repair of DNA-containing small adducts, as well as altered and abnormal bases, occurs primarily via the base excision repair (BER) 2The abbreviations used are: BER, base excision repair; AP, apurinic/apyrimidinic; MPG, N-methylpurine-DNA glycosylase; APE, apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease; OGG, 8-oxoguanine-DNA glycosylase; Hx, hypoxanthine; ϵA, ethenoadenine; STO, single turnover. 2The abbreviations used are: BER, base excision repair; AP, apurinic/apyrimidinic; MPG, N-methylpurine-DNA glycosylase; APE, apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease; OGG, 8-oxoguanine-DNA glycosylase; Hx, hypoxanthine; ϵA, ethenoadenine; STO, single turnover. pathway, beginning with cleavage of the base by a DNA glycosylase (1Lindahl T.

American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D.C.1995: 59Google Scholar). Mechanistically, DNA glycosylases are categorized into two classes: mono- and bifunctional DNA glycosylases. Monofunctional DNA glycosylases, such as N-methylpurine-DNA glycosylase (MPG) and uracil-DNA glycosylase, use an activated water molecule as a nucleophile to generate an apurinic or apyrimidinic (AP) site in DNA. Bifunctional DNA glycosylases/AP lyases, such as NTH1 and OGG1, use an activated amino group (Lys) or imino group (Pro) as the nucleophile to create a Schiff base intermediate that coordinates base removal and subsequent strand incision (AP lyase) 3′ to the AP site (4Breimer L.

Toxicol. 1997; 10: 713-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). These lesions include 3-alkylpurines, 7-alkylguanine, 1,N6-ethenoadenine (ϵA), N2,3-ethenoguanine, and hypoxanthine (Hx), all of which are purine derivatives (7Roy R. Biswas T. Hazra T.K. Roy G.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1624-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Moreover, the base alterations are located in both the major and minor grooves of duplex DNA. Its orthologs in Escherichia coli (AlkA) and yeast (MAG) have an overlapping although not identical substrate range. Nonetheless mammalian MPG and E. coli AlkA do not share significant sequence similarity or structural homology (13Labahn J. Scharer O.D. Long A. Ezaz-Nikpay K. Verdine G.L. Ellenberger T.E. Cell. 1998; 86: 321-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 14Lau A.Y. Scharer O.D. Samson L. Verdine G.L. Ellenberger T.

MPG excises ϵA and Hx more efficiently than AlkA and MAG (11Saparbaev M. Laval J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5873-5877Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), but unlike AlkA, it cannot excise O2-alkylpyrimidines (15Lindahl T. Sedgwick B. Sekiguchi M. Nakabeppu Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 133-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar, 16McCarthy T.V. Karran P. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 545-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) and oxidized bases such as 5-formyluracil and 5-hydroxymethyluracil (17Bjelland S. Birkeland N.K. Benneche T. Volden G. Seeberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30489-30495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from DNA. MAG also does not excise O2-methylthymine (6Singer B. Hang B. Chem. Res.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4577-4582Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).The role of the magnesium (Mg2+) ion on DNA glycosylases is not well established. Notably, intranuclear Mg2+ concentration is highly variable. Depending on conditions, its may vary up to 75 mm. Unlike the normal cells, tumor cells have a higher Mg2+ content in the nucleus (19Kroeger H. Trosch W. J. Cell. Physiol. 1974; 83: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 20Lukacs G.L. Zs-Nagy I. Steiber J. Gyori F. Balazs G. Scanning Microsc. 1996; 10: 1191-1200PubMed Google Scholar). It is reported that 5–10% of total Mg2+ is in a free state in the cells (21Li-Smerin Y. Levitan E.S. Johnson J.W. J. Physiol. 2001; 533: 729-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). A recent report suggests that Mg2+ reduces the efficiency of the base excision and strand incision activities of hOGG1 on DNA containing 8-oxoG under single turnover conditions (22Morland I. Luna L. Gustad E. Seeberg E. Bjørås M. DNA Repair. 2005; 4: 381-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar); however, the reduction was more pronounced for the AP-lyase activity. The Schiff base formation between hOGG1- and 8-oxoG-containing DNA was abrogated in the presence of Mg2+. These results suggest that hOGG1 operates mainly as a monofunctional glycosylase under physiologic concentrations of Mg2+ (22Morland I. Luna L. Gustad E. Seeberg E. Bjørås M. DNA Repair. 2005; 4: 381-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). There is a growing list of DNA glycosylases that cleave the damaged base depending on the base opposite to the damaged one. For example, for base discrimination, human endonuclease III (hNTH1) depends strongly on Mg2+ (23Eide L. Luna L. Gustad E. Henderson P.T. Essigmann J.M. Demple B. Seeberg E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6653-6659Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, Mg2+ has also been shown to stimulate the turnover of thymine-DNA glycosylase (24Waters T.R. Gallinari P. Jiricny J. Swann P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 67-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Mg2+ acts as a cofactor of many enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation, nucleic acids and protein synthesis, and mitotic activity of normal cells. The adult human body contains 21–28 g of Mg2+. As a nutritional element the daily requirement of Mg2+ (200–700 mg) is crucial (25Bronzetti G. Croce C.D. Davini T. J. Environ. Pathol. Toxicol. Oncol. 1995; 14: 197-204PubMed Google Scholar).In the present study, we have demonstrated that Mg2+ is not required for MPG activity. However, Mg2+ can inhibit MPG activity significantly, at physiologically relevant concentrations, by abrogating its substrate binding ability without any effect on its catalytic chemistry. Because Mg2+ is an absolute requirement for the downstream activities of the major BER enzymes (26Izumi T. Wiederhold L.R. Roy G. Roy R. Jaiswal A. Bhakat K.K. Mitra S. Hazra T.K. Toxicology. 2003; 15: 43-65Crossref Scopus (178) Google Scholar), it may act as a regulator for the BER pathway for efficient and balanced repair of damaged bases, which are often less toxic and/or mutagenic than their subsequent repair product intermediates.MATERIALS AND METHODSPurification of Recombinant Mouse MPG—The mouse MPG wild type and the deletion mutant were purified as described previously (27Roy R. Biswas T. Lee J.C. Mitra S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4278-4282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar).Oligonucleotide Substrate Preparation—A 50-Mer oligonucleotide substrate containing Hx and ϵA, with the sequence 5′-TCGAGGATCCTGAGCTCGAGTCGACGXTCGCGAATTCTGCGGATCCAAGC-3′ (where X represents ϵA or Hx), was purchased from Operon Technologies (Alameda, CA) and Gene Link (Hawthorne, NY). The complementary oligonucleotide containing an A opposite ϵA or Hx was synthesized by the Recombinant DNA Laboratory Core Facility at the University of Texas Medical Branch (Galveston, TX). The oligonucleotides were purified on a sequencing gel. The Hx or ϵA oligonucleotide was labeled at the 5′-end using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [32P]ATP and annealed to a complementary oligonucleotide to prepare a 32P end-labeled duplex oligonucleotide as described previously (27Roy R. Biswas T. Lee J.C. Mitra S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4278-4282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar).MPG-mediated Excision Activity Assay—The MPG proteins, full-length (1.1–12.5 nm) and truncated (NΔ100CΔ18, 3.2 nm), were incubated individually with 5′ 32P-labeled ϵA- or Hx-containing duplex oligonucleotide substrates (1 nm) in the presence of different divalent metal ions, EDTA, EGTA, control duplex oligo or in various combinations for 10 min at 37 °C in an assay buffer (25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 150 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol) in a total volume of 20 μl. The reaction was stopped by inactivating the enzyme at 75 °C for 5 min. The products containing the AP sites were then quantitatively cleaved into smaller fragments by incubating them with a large excess amount (100 ng) of AP endonucleases at 37 °C for 10 min after the concentration of Mg2+ was adjusted to 5 mm (27Roy R. Biswas T. Lee J.C. Mitra S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4278-4282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar).The reaction mixture was then mixed with 40 μl of loading buffer containing 1× DNA dye (diluted from blue-orange 6× loading dye; Promega, Madison, WI), 85% formamide, and 0.03 n NaOH and heated at 95 °C for 5 min. The samples were resolved by electrophoresis at 60 °C using Criterion gel (BioRad) containing 20% polyacrylamide and 7 m urea. Radioactivity in the incised oligonucleotides was quantified by exposing the gel to x-ray films and measuring the band intensities using an imager (Chemigenius Bioimaging System) with quantification software (Syngene Inc., San Diego, CA).DNA Binding Studies Using Surface Plasmon Resonance—In search of a mechanism of modulation of MPG activity by Mg2+, we examined the MPG-Hx binding using a Biacore 1000 (Biacore, Uppsala, Sweden). A 50-mer duplex oligonucleotide containing an Hx or adenine (no modification) at the 26th position from the 5′-end of one strand was used for measuring enzymeoligo interaction. Oligos were biotinylated and immobilized on streptavidin-coated Biacore chips. Then NΔ100CΔ 18 MPGs at various concentrations (0–400 nm) were injected, and the surface plasmon resonance units were measured over 30 min. There is an advantage to using the truncated MPG (NΔ100CΔ18) over the full-length protein for binding assays; the truncated protein is slower (75% less active) in the Hx cleavage reaction, albeit with an inhibitory effect similar to Mg2+ (data not shown). Thus it was convenient to establish the equilibrium substrate binding condition with the truncated protein. The binding kinetics for oligonucleotides containing Hx or no modification was established with a series of MPG concentrations. The Langmuir isotherms at various protein concentrations allowed us to calculate the kinetic binding parameters based on on/off rates and protein concentrations. Then we tested the effect of various concentration of Mg2+ on MPG (125 nm) binding toward Hx or unmodified oligonucleotide.Single Turnover (STO) Kinetic Study—The enzymes (12.5 nm) were incubated individually with 1 nm 5′ 32P-labeled Hx-containing duplex oligonucleotide substrates at 37 °C in an assay buffer (25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 100 μg/ml nuclease-free bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 150 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol) in a total volume of 100 μl. Aliquots of 5 μl were taken out at different time points (0–20 min) and heat-inactivated at 80 °C in a preheated microcentrifuge tube. Then we tested the Mg2+ effect at concentrations of 0–500 μm. The products containing the AP sites were quantitatively cleaved into smaller fragments followed by resolving on denaturing gels; radioactivity in the incised oligonucleotide was also quantified as described for the activity assay.Burst Analysis—The enzymes (5 nm) were individually incubated with a 5′ 32P-labeled hypoxanthine-containing duplex oligonucleotide (50 nm) at 37 °C under conditions similar to those described for the STO kinetic study.Steady-state Kinetics—The enzyme (12.5 nm) was incubated with a 5′ 32P-labeled Hx-containing duplex oligonucleotide (0–60 nm) substrates for 5 min at 37 °C under assay conditions similar to those described above. The reaction products were also analyzed and quantified as described for the activity assay.RESULTSEffect of Mg2+ and Other Divalent Ions on MPG Activity—The activity of purified full-length MPG was measured in the presence of 0–5 mm MgCl2 concentration using Hx as a substrate. Although Mg2+ showed a slight stimulatory effect with Hx (70–125%) at micromolar concentrations, a higher concentration of Mg2+ (1–5 mm) inhibited MPG reaction significantly (Fig. 1, A and B). Mg2+ inhibited the reaction, but an equivalent amount of EDTA could rescue nearly full activity of MPG (Fig. 2). EGTA did not have an effect on the inhibition. However, EGTA as a specific chelator had a significantly higher affinity for Ca2+ than for Mg2+, and thus the results were in accordance with expectations. Based on these findings, it appears that the Mg2+-mediated inhibition of MPG is reversible. Mg2+ has been shown to modulate the double helix structure of DNA (26Izumi T. Wiederhold L.R. Roy G. Roy R. Jaiswal A. Bhakat K.K. Mitra S. Hazra T.K. Toxicology. 2003; 15: 43-65Crossref Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Mg2+ may modify the DNA structure and thus inhibit the binding of MPG to the DNA substrate. We tested this possibility by adding an increasing amount of undamaged oligonucleotide containing adenine in place of Hx. The results showed that unlike EDTA, DNA could not rescue MPG activity from Mg2+-mediated inhibition; rather increasing the DNA concentration inhibited the activity of MPG (Fig. 3). DNA-mediated inhibition of activity is very common for MPG and other DNA glycosylases (26Izumi T. Wiederhold L.R. Roy G. Roy R. Jaiswal A. Bhakat K.K. Mitra S. Hazra T.K. Toxicology. 2003; 15: 43-65Crossref Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it is apparent that to affect activity, Mg2+ modulates MPG protein but not the substrate DNA. Next, we tested the effect of other divalent metals on MPG-Hx enzymatic reaction (Table 1). Zn2+ and Mn2+ had a pronounced inhibitory effect, whereas Ca2+ was the poorest inhibitor. The IC50 values for these metal ions in inhibiting MPG were as follows: Zn2+ < Mn2+ < Mg2+ < Ca2+. Because MPG has broad substrate specificity, we tested DNA substrates other than Hx for Mg2+-mediated modulation of the MPG activity and found that Mg2+ could inhibit the MPG excision activity for ϵA-containing oligonucleotides. However, no stimulation was observed by Mg2+ in excision of ϵA by MPG. As expected, EDTA rescued MPG activity toward ϵA excision from Mg2+ inhibition (data not shown). These results demonstrated that Mg2+ can be slightly stimulatory or significantly inhibitory toward MPG activity depending on its concentration and substrate type.FIGURE 2Effect of EDTA on Mg2+-mediated inhibition.

Open table in a new tab Mechanism Analysis for Inhibition of MPG by Mg2+—Although Zn2+ appears to be the most important inhibitor among the divalent metal ions tested, we studied the mechanism of Mg2+ inhibition because Mg2+ is an absolute requirement for the rest of the downstream enzymes in the BER pathway. To elucidate this mechanism, we tested the major steps of the reaction process. We performed pre-steady-state kinetics to analyze the mechanisms of Mg2+ inhibition of MPG activity. Pre-steady-state kinetic analysis provides the opportunity to identify the intermediate step(s) that might be affected by Mg2+. Fig. 4 illustrates the basic intermediate steps of the MPG reaction. In general, we and others have showed that DNA glycosylases such as MPG bind substrates and generate a Michaelis-Menten complex in which an enzymatic reaction or catalysis occurs to cleave the scissile glycosidic bond (7Roy R.

Then the enzyme dissociates from the product, the AP sites, and turns over to bind a new molecule of substrate. All of the reaction rates at transient steps are slow for MPG and in general for all of the DNA glycosylases tested thus far (7Roy R. Biswas T. Hazra T.K. Roy G. Grabowski D.T. Izumi T. Srinivasan G.

We took advantage of the slow reaction rates of MPG and measured the effect of Mg2+ on the glycosidic bond cleavage (catalysis) step by STO kinetics and the product dissociation step by multiple turnover reaction conditions. In addition, the multiple turnover conditions allowed us to measure the active enzyme concentration that might be affected by Mg2+.FIGURE 4Proposed model for reaction mechanism of MPG. The steps and the notations used to indicate the intermediate steps of MPG reaction are as follows: E, the enzyme MPG; S1, the substrate with the modified base (ϵA or Hx); P1, the excised modified base; P2, the oligo substrate with AP site after the base is excised.

Unmodified oligonucleotide with a similar sequence was used as a control. Using SPR one can follow real-time DNA-protein interactions compared with other commonly used methods, such as a gel shift assay. We established the binding conditions for oligonucleotides containing Hx or no modification by injecting truncated MPG at 0–400 nm. The SPR was monitored and the resonance units plotted against time (Fig. 5, A and B). The Langmuir isotherms at various protein concentrations allowed us to calculate the kinetic parameters based on on/off rates and protein concentrations. We found that the KD values (dissociation constants) for unmodified and Hx-containing oligonucleotides were 176 and 2.5 nm, respectively, indicating that MPG binds both the oligonucleotides, albeit with ∼70-fold higher affinity for Hx. Then we tested the effect of Mg2+ on MPG binding toward Hx-containing oligonucleotide and found that Mg2+ increased the affinity between MPG and Hx at a lower concentration and significantly inhibited the interaction at its higher concentrations in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5C). These results suggest that the modulation of substrate binding by Mg2+ altered the overall activity of MPG.FIGURE 5A and B, Langmuir isotherm of MPG binding to 50-mer biotinylated oligonucleotides containing adenine (A) or Hx (B) using Biacore 1000.

Data were analyzed using the first-order rate equation, Pt=A01-exp-kobst(Eq. 1) where A0 represents the amplitude of the exponential phase and kobs is the observed rate constant associated with the reaction process. Under the STO conditions ([E] ≫ [S]), all of the substrate molecules should remain bound by enzymes. The binding step should not affect the rate of product formation, and hence, under these conditions kobs can be considered as kchem. Under three different concentrations of Mg2+, the kchem was similar (0.32 ± 0.1) for MPG-Hx reactions (Fig. 6), indicating that Mg2+ does not affect the chemistry step of MPG activity.FIGURE 6A, effect of Mg2+ on MPG-Hx reaction under single turnover conditions.

Chem. 1997; 272: 1302-1307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The extremely slow turnover rate of MPG during excision of Hx provided the opportunity to perform burst analysis under reaction conditions of [S] ≫ [E], where the substrate and enzyme concentration were 50 and 5 nm, respectively. The data were fit to the equation, Pt=A01-exp-kobst+ksst(Eq. 2) Although the curves were biphasic, indicating the presence of pre-steady state and steady state, the burst periods were unusually long (5 min). Generally, the burst rate, which is actually the rate of enzyme reaction during the pre-steady state of burst analysis, is similar to the rate of chemical reaction (kchem) at pre-steady state under STO conditions. Indeed, the times required to complete the first cycle (burst) of product generation in burst analysis (Fig. 7) and attain the saturation of product formation in STO kinetic analysis (Fig. 6) are similar.

We report here for the first time specific and growth-inhibitory drug targeting of RNase P in live bacteria. This is also the first example of a duplex-forming oligomer that invades a structured catalytic RNA and inactivates the RNA by (i) trapping it in a state in which the catalytic core is partially unfolded, (ii) sterically interfering with substrate binding, and (iii) perturbing the coordination of catalytically relevant Mg2+ ions.

We report here for the first time specific and growth-inhibitory drug targeting of RNase P in live bacteria. This is also the first example of a duplex-forming oligomer that invades a structured catalytic RNA and inactivates the RNA by (i) trapping it in a state in which the catalytic core is partially unfolded, (ii) sterically interfering with substrate binding, and (iii) perturbing the coordination of catalytically relevant Mg2+ ions. Antisense-based inhibition of bacterial cell growth as a strategy to combat prokaryotic pathogens has been little-explored mainly because of the low cellular uptake efficiency of antisense agents. We report here on antisense-based inhibition of the catalytic RNA subunit of Ribonuclease P (RNase P) 2The abbreviations used are: RNase P, Ribonuclease P; LNA, locked nucleic acid; PNA, peptide nucleic acid; ptRNA, precursor tRNA; RT, reverse transcription. from Escherichia coli. Bacterial RNase P is an essential ribonucleoprotein enzyme responsible for the 5′-end maturation of tRNAs (1Frank D.N. Pace N.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 153-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) whose architecture largely differs from that of eukaryotic RNase P enzymes, a first prerequisite for a favorable drug target. Also, its cellular abundance is low compared with ribosomal RNA or tRNA; for example, E. coli cells contain a 60–100-fold molar excess of ribosomes over RNase P RNA (2Dong H. Kirsebom L.A. Nilsson L. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Thus, compared with ribosomes, lower intracellular drug concentrations may be required to deplete cellular RNase P activity below a threshold essential for cell growth and survival. Because the enzyme contains a stable catalytic RNA subunit expected to turnover slowly relative to most mRNAs, de novo transcription rates of its RNA subunit are predicted to be relatively low, suggesting that its inactivation will result in a rather persistent phenotype. Previously, the so-called P15 loop region of E. coli-type RNase P RNAs, known to interact with the 3′-CCA portion of precursor tRNA (ptRNA) substrates (3Kirsebom L.A. Svärd S.G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4870-4876Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), was demonstrated to be a very effective target site for antisense-like inhibition strategies (4Willkomm D.K. Gruegelsiepe H. Goudinakis O. Kretschmer-Kazemi Far R. Bald R. Erdmann V.A. Hartmann R.K. Chembiochem. 2003; 4: 1041-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 5Gruegelsiepe H. Willkomm D.K. Goudinakis O. Hartmann R.K. Chembiochem. 2003; 4: 1049-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In a related but conceptually different approach termed oligonucleotide-directed misfolding of RNA, E. coli RNase P RNA was screened with consecutive DNA 12-mers for inhibition of ptRNA processing in a reaction mixture in which RNase P RNA was newly transcribed in the presence of its protein subunit (6Childs J.L. Poole A.W. Turner D.H. RNA. 2003; 9: 1437-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). A 2′-O-methylated variant of one 12-mer complementary to nucleotides 289–300 in the P15 loop region turned out to be the most efficient inhibitor. This result supported our choice of the P15 loop region for the rational design of antisense agents. Antisense strategies in general have to circumvent the problem of rapid DNA and RNA oligonucleotide degradation, and DNA additionally suffers from the relatively low stability of DNA:RNA hybrids. “Third generation” antisense agents, such as locked nucleic acid (LNA) and peptide nucleic acid (PNA), are highly resistant to degradation enzymes (7Good L. Awasthi S.K. Dryselius R. Larsson O. Nielsen P.E. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 8Kurreck J. Eur. J.

In LNA, a methylene bridge connecting the 2′-oxygen and 4′-carbon atoms fixes the sugar pucker in an A-type helical conformation. PNA is composed of an uncharged peptide backbone with the nucleobases attached via methylene carbonyl linkages and is presented in a spatial arrangement mimicking natural nucleic acids. Because of its uncharged backbone, PNA was reported to be able to invade stable stem-loop structures that are not accessible to natural oligonucleotides, with helix stability being largely independent of salt concentration (10Egholm M. Buchardt O. Christensen L. Behrens C. Freier S.M. Driver D.A. Berg R.H. Kim S.K. Norden B. Nielsen P.E. Nature. 1993; 365: 566-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1779) Google Scholar, 11Tomac S. Sarkar M.

The melting temperatures of LNA:RNA duplexes are substantially increased relative to the corresponding RNA:RNA helices (12Singh S.K. Wengel J. Chem. Commun. 1998; 12: 1247-1248Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 13Childs J.L. Disney M.D. Turner D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Bioconjugate Chem. 2004; 15: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The stability of LNA:RNA duplexes apparently exceeds that of PNA: RNA duplexes (15Elayadi A.N. Braasch D.A. Corey D.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9973-9981Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The most severe obstacle to inhibition of bacterial growth by antisense agents, however, is their uptake into bacterial cells. It has previously been demonstrated that conjugates of PNA oligomers and invasive peptides derived from antimicrobial peptides of the innate immune system of eukaryotic organisms are able to enter Gram-negative and -positive bacteria and to interact with their specific target RNAs in vivo (7Good L. Awasthi S.K. Dryselius R. Larsson O. Nielsen P.E. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 16Nekhotiaeva N. Awasthi S.K. Nielsen P.E. Good L. Mol. Ther. 2004; 10: 652-659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). At present, such PNA-peptide conjugates appear to be the most efficient strategy for antisense-based inhibition of live bacteria. Here we have characterized in vitro the efficiency, specificity, and kinetics of E. coli RNase P RNA inhibition by DNA, RNA, LNA, and PNA versions of a 14-mer complementary to the P15 loop. We further demonstrate, for the first time, the growth inhibition of live E. coli bacteria by an antisense oligomer specific to its highly structured and catalytic RNase P RNA. The duplex-forming oligomer inactivates the enzyme by sterically blocking substrate access, by arresting part of the catalytic core of the RNA in a non-functional conformation, and by disrupting the binding of catalytically relevant Mg2+ in the P15 loop region. RNA, LNA, PNA, and DNA Oligonucleotides—High pressure liquid chromatography-purified RNA oligonucleotides were purchased from IBA (Göttingen, Germany) or CureVac (Tübingen, Germany). DNA oligonucleotides were from Invitrogen. Further purification of oligonucleotides was performed on denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Oligonucleotides were localized by UV shadowing, excised from the gel, eluted overnight at 8 °C in NaOAc (1 m, pH 4.9), and recovered by ethanol precipitation. The following oligonucleotides were used in this study: 5′-CAAGCAGCCUACCC (RNA E. coli 14-mer), 5′-CUAGCGACCUACCC (RNA A. vinosum 14-mer), 5′-AAGCGGCCCAUCCC (RNA T. thermophilus 14-mer), 5′-CCUAUUUUUUUUACCAAAAUUUAGG (control RNA), 5′-CAAGCAGCCTACCC (DNA E. coli 14-mer). The LNA 14-mer, synthesized essentially as described previously (17Schmidt K.S. Borkowski S. Kurreck J. Stephens A.W. Bald R. Hecht M. Friebe M. Dinkelborg L. Erdmann V.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 19: 5757-5765Crossref Scopus (245) Google Scholar), was identical in sequence to the RNA E. coli 14-mer, except that all residues carried a locked ribose, and cytosine and uracil bases were replaced with 5-methyl-cytosine and 5-methyl-uracil. The PNA oligomers and PNA-peptide conjugates, synthesized as described previously (18Brandt O. Feldner J. Stephan A. Schröder M. Schnölzer M. Arlinghaus H.F. Hoheisel J.D. Jacob A.

Enzymatic RNA Synthesis, 5′-32P End Labeling of ptRNA Substrate, and Kinetics—The ptRNAGly substrate and RNase P RNAs were synthesized by T7 runoff transcription and purified as described previously (4Willkomm D.K.

Burgin A.B. Haas E.S. Pace N.R. J. Biol.

Gruegelsiepe H. Goudinakis O. Kretschmer-Kazemi Far R. Bald R. Erdmann V.A. Hartmann R.K. Chembiochem. 2003; 4: 1041-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). 3′-32P End Labeling of RNase P RNA, Pb2+-induced Hydrolysis, and RNase T1 and Alkaline Hydrolysis—3′-32P End labeling of E. coli RNase P RNA, Pb2+-induced hydrolysis as well as RNase T1 and alkaline hydrolysis were performed essentially as described previously (5Gruegelsiepe H. Willkomm D.K. Goudinakis O. Hartmann R.K. Chembiochem. 2003; 4: 1049-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Radioactive bands were visualized using a Bio-Imaging analyzer FLA 3000–2R (Fujifilm) and the analysis software PCBAS/AIDA (Raytest). Images were further edited by Corel Photopaint, version 11. Cloning of Bacillus subtilis rnpB in Plasmid pSP64—B. subtilis rnpB, including its natural promoter and terminator, was amplified from genomic B. subtilis DNA (strain W168) using primers 5′-GGC AGC AAG CTT TAT GAT TGA TCA C (including the native HindIII site upstream of rnpB) and 5′-CGC CCA AGC TTG TGT ATA CTT CTT CAT CGT ATC ACC CTG TC. The resulting PCR fragment was cloned in the HindIII site of pSP64 (Promega). E. coli Growth Inhibition Experiments—PNA-peptide conjugates were tested for inhibition of E. coli cells (wild-type K12 and the lipopolysaccharide-defective E. coli strain AS19; Ref. 20Sekiguchi M. Iida S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1967; 58: 2316-2320Crossref Scopus (134) Google Scholar) essentially as described in Ref. 7Good L. Awasthi S.K. Dryselius R. Larsson O. Nielsen P.E. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar. 3 ml of LB (Luria-Bertani) medium were inoculated with a single colony, and cells were grown under aeration (180 revolutions/min in a thermoshaker) at 37 °C to an A578 of 2.4–3.7. Suspensions were diluted with double-distilled H2O (strain K12) or 0.9% NaCl (strain AS19) to 10% LB and 5 × 105 cells/ml. To 100 μl (5 × 104 cells) of such a suspension, PNA-peptide inhibitor was added and 10 μl aliquots withdrawn after 0, 10, 30, 60, and 180 min; aliquots or appropriate dilutions (down to 1:10,000) were plated in 10 (for undiluted samples) or 100 μl portions (in 10% LB, including 0.9% NaCl for strain AS19), incubated on LB agar plates at 37 °C overnight, and the number of colonies counted. Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—To compare E. coli RNase P RNA levels in inhibited and uninhibited cells, AS19 cells harboring plasmid pSP64-Bsrnp were grown as described above and treated with either no inhibitor, 5 μm PNA-G-peptide, or 5 μm scPNA-G-peptide for 3 h. Cell amounts were verified by plating. Total RNA from each culture was prepared using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) followed by DNase I treatment (Promega). RT-PCR was performed with the AccessQuick RT-PCR System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primers specific for E. coli rnpB were 5′-CTC ACT GGC TCA AGC AGC CT (5′-end-labeled) and 5′-GAA GCT GAC CAG ACA GTC GC. Primers specific for rpsR (ribosomal protein S18) were 5′-TGG CAC GTT ATT TCC GTC G (5′-end-labeled) and 5′-TTA CTG ATG GCG ATC AGT GTA CGG. RT-PCR reactions contained the normal amounts of unlabeled primers and, in addition, trace amounts of the respective 5′-end-labeled primer. Inhibition Efficiency and Specificity of DNA, RNA, LNA, and PNA 14-mer Versions—Hybrid formation of the 14-mer (E. coli 14-mer; either RNA or DNA) with its target site in the P15 loop region of E. coli RNase P RNA (Fig. 1) results in the disruption of the local structure and blocks the docking of the tRNA 3′-end to the active site of RNase P RNA (5Gruegelsiepe H. Willkomm D.K. Goudinakis O. Hartmann R.K. Chembiochem. 2003; 4: 1049-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This inhibits RNase P activity, not only in the RNA alone but also in the holoenzyme reaction (4Willkomm D.K. Gruegelsiepe H. Goudinakis O. Kretschmer-Kazemi Far R. Bald R. Erdmann V.A. Hartmann R.K. Chembiochem. 2003; 4: 1041-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We extended our inhibition analyses by including derivatives of the 14-mer containing a PNA or LNA backbone. As a first approach to assessing the relative binding affinities of the RNA, DNA, LNA, and PNA oligomer versions, we preincubated E. coli RNase P RNA with different oligomer concentrations for ≥40 min to allow the binding equilibrium to be reached. Multiple turnover processing reactions containing 10 nm RNase P RNA were then started by adding 100 nm ptRNA substrate. Inhibition efficiencies (given as Ki values, defined as the oligomer concentration resulting in a 2-fold reduced rate of ptRNA cleavage) (Table 1) provided a first measure for the relative inhibitor strength. Ki values do not necessarily equal KD values but report the same trends in binding affinity differences (5Gruegelsiepe H. Willkomm D.K. Goudinakis O. Hartmann R.K. Chembiochem. 2003; 4: 1049-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The RNA and LNA variants turned out to have the lowest and very similar Ki values (2.2 for RNA, 3.9 for LNA) (Table 1) followed by PNA (Ki = 12.5) and DNA (Ki = 25). Ki values of 2–4 nm are low for an enzyme concentration of 10 nm, as one would expect 5 nm to be the minimum inhibitor concentration for obtaining 50% inhibition. We attribute this to the finding that only ∼50–60% of E. coli RNase P RNA is in an active conformation after 40 min of preincubation at 37 °C in the standard buffer used here (21Hardt W.D. Schlegl J. Erdmann V.A. Hartmann R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3521-3527Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).TABLE 1Ki and kon values for the binding of antisense 14-mers to RNase P RNAsRNase P RNAE. coli 14-mer, RNA, KiE. coli 14-mer, LNA, KiE. coli 14-mer, PNA, KiE. coli 14-mer, DNA, KiA. vinosum 14-mer, RNA, KiT. thermophilus 14-mer, RNA, KiKi values in nmE. coli2.2 ± 0.63.9 ± 1.812.5 ± 0.525 ± 5160 ± 1080 ± 20 kon(6.8 ± 0.7) × 104(8.6 ± 4.5) × 104(2.2 ± 0.5) × 105(2.3 ± 2.0) × 104P. aeruginosa (1 mismatch, 1 GU)19.0 ± 1.518.2 ± 0.8580 ± 225NANANAA. vinosum (2 mismatches, 1 GU)125 ± 5325 ± 53200 ± 1500NA3.0 ± 0.6NAT. thermophilus (1 mismatch, 1 GU, 1 bulge)1200 ± 2536 ± 137000 ± 3000NANA13.3 ± 2.5 Open table in a new tab We then addressed the inhibition specificity of the RNA, LNA, and PNA versions of the 14-mer by testing their effects on the processing reaction catalyzed by three other bacterial RNase P RNAs with sequence variation in the target region, namely those from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, A. vinosum, and Thermus thermophilus. Complementarity of the E. coli 14-mer was predicted to be the least compromised with P. aeruginosa RNase P RNA, of intermediate stability for the A. vinosum RNA, and most destabilized for T. thermophilus RNase P RNA (Fig. 2). As expected, inhibition efficiencies of RNA and PNA 14-mers decreased in the order P. aeruginosa > A. vinosum > T. thermophilus (Table 1). Yet with the LNA 14-mer, there was little discrimination. This is attributable to the extraordinary stability of LNA:RNA hybrids (12Singh S.K. Wengel J. Chem. Commun. 1998; 12: 1247-1248Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 13Childs J.L. Disney M.D. Turner D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11091-11096Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), which leads to increased mismatch tolerance, in line with a previous study (15Elayadi A.N. Braasch D.A. Corey D.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9973-9981Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In a reverse setup, we designed 14-meric RNA oligomers that fully matched the P15 loop region of A. vinosum and T. thermophilus RNase P RNA, respectively. For the A. vinosum 14-mer, the 53-fold discrimination against E. coli RNase P RNA (Ki = 3.0 versus 160) (Table 1) exactly mirror-imaged what we had seen with the E. coli 14-mer (Table 1). Surprisingly, discrimination against the E. coli RNase P RNA was only 6-fold for the T. thermophilus 14-mer (for details, see supplemental Fig. S1). Invasion of PNA and LNA 14-mers into the P15 Loop Region—We next analyzed strand invasion of the 14-mers into the P15 loop region of E. coli RNase P RNA by lead probing. For the RNA and DNA 14-mers, we had shown earlier (5Gruegelsiepe H. Willkomm D.K. Goudinakis O. Hartmann R.K. Chembiochem. 2003; 4: 1049-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) that they anneal to the target region over their entire length, as inferred from the suppression of lead hydrolysis in the region spanning nucleotides 291–304 of RNase P RNA (Fig. 3, lanes 11 and 12). In addition, a novel lead hydrolysis product appears in the 5′-proximal strand of helix P15 (Fig. 3, arrow), demonstrating that P15 is disrupted in oligomer-RNase P RNA complexes. The T. thermophilus-specific RNA 14-mer induced the same changes under the conditions applied (Fig. 3, lanes 9 and 10). Incomplete suppression of lead cleavage at site V is attributable to imperfect complementarity and thus decreased affinity of this oligomer for E. coli RNase P RNA (Fig. 2). The lead cleavage pattern remained unchanged upon the addition of a control RNA lacking substantial sequence complementarity to E. coli RNase P RNA (Fig. 3, lanes 7 and 8). In the presence of the E. coli-specific LNA 14-mer (lanes 13 and 14), the same changes in the lead cleavage pattern as for the RNA analog were seen. However, all fragments that included the target site were shifted toward lower gel mobility, whereas the smaller ones (Fig. 3, bottom section of the gel) excluding this region showed unperturbed mobility. This result demonstrates that the LNA 14-mer remained bound to the RNase P RNA, even during electrophoresis in the presence of 8 m urea. A very similar observation was made with the PNA 14-mer (Fig. 3, lanes 15 and 16), but there the upshifted fragments migrated more diffusely. One explanation is that the PNA 14-mer undergoes dissociation and reassociation cycles during electrophoresis. Alternatively, PNA is known to have a propensity to form RNA:PNA2 triplexes (22Dias N. Sénamaud-Beaufort C. le Forestier E. Auvin C. Hélène C. Saison-Behmoaras T.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 489-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Triplex formation is indeed conceivable based on the sequence of the PNA 14-mer (supplemental Fig. S2) and might have contributed to the diffuse gel mobility in lanes 15 and 16 (Fig. 3). Inhibitor Association Rates—The lead probing experiments (Fig. 3) indicated that hybrid helices formed between the LNA or PNA 14-mer and the target region dissociate at very slow rates (koff). Because the RNA 14-mer was previously shown to dissociate at a rate not exceeding 0.02 h–1 under processing assay conditions (5Gruegelsiepe H. Willkomm D.K. Goudinakis O. Hartmann R.K. Chembiochem. 2003; 4: 1049-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), koff could be considered as practically zero for the RNA, LNA, and PNA 14-mers within the time frame of our inhibition analyses. We then addressed the question as to which extent these analogs may differ from their natural DNA and RNA counterparts in the rate of association (kon). This was analyzed by an RNase P RNA activity assay performed under conditions where processing activity linearly depended on the amount of active enzyme. Thus, we determined the fraction of active (uninhibited) enzyme that remained after increasing enzyme-oligomer preincubation times, and the rate of enzyme inactivation equaled the rate of oligomer association (for details, see supplemental Fig. S3). The PNA 14-mer showed the fastest rate followed by the LNA and RNA versions and the DNA 14-mer with the slowest association rate (Table 1, values in bold lettering). Inhibition by PNA-Peptide Conjugates in Vitro—Limited cellular uptake is a general problem of antisense agents, especially in bacteria. Because improved cell entry was demonstrated for PNA oligomers coupled to invasive peptides (7Good L. Awasthi S.K. Dryselius R. Larsson O. Nielsen P.E. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), we adopted this strategy for RNase P inhibition. Taking into account that the linker connecting the N-terminal peptide and the PNA oligomer may influence inhibition efficacy (7Good L. Awasthi S.K. Dryselius R. Larsson O. Nielsen P.E. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 23Geller B.L. Deere J.D. Stein D.A. Kroeker A.D. Moulton H.M. Iversen P.L. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2003; 47: 3233-3239Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), we utilized two different linkers. One is the commonly used 2-aminoethoxy-2-ethoxy acetic acid (AEEA) linker, (also termed 8-amino-3,6-dioxaoctanoic acid linker and abbreviated as eg1) (7Good L. Awasthi S.K. Dryselius R. Larsson O. Nielsen P.E. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 24Rebuffat A.G. Nawrocki A.R. Nielsen P.E. Bernasconi A.G. Bernal-Mendez E. Frey B.M. Frey F.J. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1426-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar); and the other is the novel shorter monoglycine linker not analyzed so far (supplemental Fig. S4A). We first tested these PNA-peptide conjugates in our standard RNA-alone processing assay (see Table 1). At a concentration of 100 nm, both the PNA-AEEA-peptide and PNA-G-peptide completely inhibited processing, in contrast to a control AEEA conjugate containing a scrambled PNA 14-mer (supplemental Fig. S4B). Similar results were obtained in the E. coli RNase P holoenzyme assay (supplemental Fig. S4C). There, specific inhibition was already evident at the lower concentration (12.5 nm) of PNA 14-mer or PNA-G-peptide. Inhibition by PNA-Peptide Conjugates in Vivo—The conjugates were then tested for in vivo inhibition of E. coli wild-type K12 and a more permeable mutant strain (AS19) defective in lipopolysaccharide synthesis (20Sekiguchi M. Iida S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1967; 58: 2316-2320Crossref Scopus (134) Google Scholar). To this end, cell suspensions were incubated with the corresponding conjugate for up to 180 min followed by a plating assay to determine the number of surviving colony-forming cells. Incubation of AS19 cells at 10 μm PNA-G-peptide for 180 min did not leave any survivors in all experiments, whereas inhibition by 5 μm was, on average, substantial but incomplete (Fig. 4A). Surprisingly, inhibitor effects were less pronounced with the PNA-AEEA-peptide (Fig. 4B) containing the linker used in a related previous study (7Good L. Awasthi S.K. Dryselius R. Larsson O. Nielsen P.E. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). 10 μm PNA-AEEA-peptide had a much weaker inhibitory effect than the PNA-G-peptide at the same concentration. Scrambled versions of the two conjugate types showed a very mild inhibitory effect, suggesting that 10 μm is at the threshold of concentrations at which PNA-peptide conjugates start to inhibit E. coli cells in an antisense-independent manner. The minimal inhibitory concentration of the decamerpeptide (KFF)3K itself was reported as 30 μg/ml (∼20 μm) for E. coli K12 strains (25Vaara M. Porro M. Antimicrob.Agents Chemother. 1996; (Correction (1997) Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 41, 496): 40-1805PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the carrier peptide moiety may well be the cause of the weak nonspecific inhibition effects seen here. Inhibition effects were not markedly different for the K12 compared with the AS19 strain but somewhat attenuated (Fig. 4C). This is consistent with the more permeable cell barrier of the AS19 mutant strain. The PNA 14-mer alone also showed some inhibition at a concentration of 10 μm (more pronounced with the AS19 relative to the K12 strain) (Fig. 4, B and D). To demonstrate intracellular PNA-peptide association with RNase P RNA, we performed a genetic complementation experiment. The B. subtilis RNase P RNA gene (rnpB) was previously shown to be able to functionally replace the native E. coli rnpB gene in vivo (26Waugh D.S. Pace N.R. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6316-6321Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 27Wegscheid B. Condon C. Hartmann R.K. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We also did not observe inhibition of B. subtilis RNase P RNA by oligonucleotides targeted to the P15 loop region of E. coli RNase P RNA (4Willkomm D.K. Gruegelsiepe H. Goudinakis O. Kretschmer-Kazemi Far R. Bald R. Erdmann V.A. Hartmann R.K. Chembiochem. 2003; 4: 1041-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). AS19 and K12 bacteria transformed with a plasmid expressing B. subtilis rnpB (pSP64-BsrnpB) indeed rescued inhibition caused by the presence of the PNA-G-peptide (Fig. 4, E and F), further supporting the specificity of inhibition. Transformation with the multicopy plasmid pSP64 and growth in the presence of the antibiotic ampicillin made the AS19 and K12 bacteria somewhat more sensitive to inhibitors, which explains why we observed a more pronounced inhibition effect at 5 μm PNA-G-peptide compared with the data in Fig. 4, A and C. In addition, RT-PCR was applied to analyze the fate of E. coli RNase P RNA upon inhibition by the PNA-G-peptide. AS19 bacteria harboring the complementation plasmid pSP64-BsrnpB were used, which had the advantage that cell growth was nearly the same in the presence and absence of PNA-G-peptide due to the expression of B. subtilis RNase P RNA (Fig. 4, E and F). The mRNA encoding ribosomal protein S18 (rpsR) was used to control for fluctuations in RNA template amounts used for RT-PCR reactions. Levels of E. coli RNase P RNA were clearly decreased in cells incubated with the PNA-G-peptide but not in those treated with the scrambled control conjugate (Fig. 5), suggesting that complexation with the inhibitor induces RNase P RNA degradation. Our starting point was an RNA 14-mer that"
https://openalex.org/W1574800785,"Alpha hemoglobin-stabilizing protein (AHSP) is an erythroid protein that binds free α hemoglobin (αHb) to maintain its structure and limit its pro-oxidant activity. Prior studies have defined two different αHb·AHSP complexes. Binding of AHSP to Fe(II) αHb induces an unusual configuration in which the F helix of the globin becomes disordered and the heme ring becomes solvent-exposed. Over time, this intermediate oxidizes to form a stable hemichrome in which the proximal (F8) and distal (E7) histidines are coordinated to the heme iron atom. The addition of βHb to either Fe(II) or Fe(III) αHb·AHSP displaces AHSP to generate tetrameric (α<sub>2</sub>β<sub>2</sub>) HbA species. The biochemical properties and <i>in vivo</i> significance of the two αHb·AHSP complexes are poorly understood. Here we show that Fe(III) αHb·AHSP forms from auto-oxidation of oxygenated αHb bound to AHSP and that this process is greatly accelerated at physiologic temperature and oxygen pressures. In contrast to free Fe(III) αHb hemichromes, AHSP-bound Fe(III) αHb does not precipitate and can be recycled into functional HbA. This requires enzymatic reduction of AHSP-bound αHb, either prior to or after extraction by β subunits. In contrast, reaction of Fe(II) αHb-AHSP with βHb generates functional HbA directly. Our findings support a model in which AHSP can either stabilize αHb transiently en route to HbA formation during normal erythropoiesis or convert excessive free αHb into a more chemically inert state from which recovery of αHb is possible by redox cycling."
https://openalex.org/W2049925517,"Diacylglycerol (DAG) acts as an allosteric activator of protein kinase C (PKC) and is converted to phosphatidic acid by DAG kinase (DGK). Therefore, DGK is thought to be a negative regulator of PKC activation. Here we show molecular mechanisms of functional coupling of the two kinases. γPKC directly associated with DGKγ through its accessory domain (AD), depending on Ca2+ as well as phosphatidylserine/diolein in vitro. Mass spectrometric analysis and mutation studies revealed that γPKC phosphorylated Ser-776 and Ser-779 in the AD of DGKγ. The phosphorylation by γPKC resulted in activation of DGKγ because a DGKγ mutant in which Ser-776 and Ser-779 were substituted with glutamic acid to mimic phosphorylation exhibited significantly higher activity compared with wild type DGKγ and an unphosphorylatable DGKγ mutant. Importantly, the interaction of the two kinases and the phosphorylation of DGKγ by γPKC could be confirmed in vivo, and overexpression of the AD of DGKγ inhibited re-translocation of γPKC. These results demonstrate that localization and activation of the functionally correlated kinases, γPKC and DGKγ, are spatio-temporally orchestrated by their direct association and phosphorylation, contributing to subtype-specific regulation of DGKγ and DAG signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1964952973,"Midkine is a heparin-binding growth factor that promotes cell attachment and process extension in undifferentiated bipolar CG-4 cells, an oligodendroglial precursor cell line. We found that CG-4 cells expressed a non-proteoglycan form of neuroglycan C, known as a part-time transmembrane proteoglycan. We demonstrated that neuroglycan C before or after chondroitinase ABC treatment bound to a midkine affinity column. Neuroglycan C lacking chondroitin sulfate chains was eluted with 0.5 m NaCl as a major fraction from the column. We confirmed that CG-4 cells expressed two isoforms of neuroglycan C, I, and III, by isolating cDNA. Among three functional domains of the extracellular part of neuroglycan C, the chondroitin sulfate attachment domain and acidic amino acid cluster box domain showed affinity for midkine, but the epidermal growth factor domain did not. Furthermore, cell surface neuroglycan C could be cross-linked with soluble midkine. Process extension on midkine-coated dishes was inhibited by either a monoclonal anti-neuroglycan C antibody C1 or a glutathione S-transferase-neuroglycan C fusion protein. Finally, stable transfectants of B104 neuroblastoma cells overexpressing neuroglycan C-I or neuroglycan C-III attached to the midkine substrate, spread well, and gave rise to cytoskeletal changes.

Importantly, we do not know whether a function specific to a class of cells such as neurite extension requires another receptor to transmit the specific signal or not. Here, we report that a cell surface molecule is specifically expressed in the nervous system as a component of the MK receptor in cells extending processes.When undifferentiated CG-4 cells, an oligodendrocyte precursor cell line, are cultured on dishes coated with MK or PTN, they quickly extend processes and adopt bipolar shapes (19Rumsby M.

Then, we examined the interaction between MK and NGC in CG-4 cells and found that NGC mediates process elongation on MK-coated dishes but not cell adhesion. Furthermore, we investigated the roles of NGC-I and NGC-III using cDNA transfection and overexpression.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells and Cell Culture—CG-4 cells were maintained on cell culture dishes coated with poly-d-lysine at 5 μg/ml in sterile water.

To remove chondroitin sulfate chains, samples were digested with chondroitinase ABC at 50 milliunits/ml in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 30 mm sodium acetate and 5 mm EDTA (chondroitinase ABC buffer) for 2 h at 37 °C.Construction of NGC Expression Vectors for Mammalian Cells—Rat NGC cDNA (GenBank™ accession numbers NM_019284 and NM_133652) was amplified by PCR with specific primers for NGC, 5′-GGGATCCGCGCAATGGGCCGAGCTG-3′, named primer F1, and 5′-TCATCAGGTCAGGTTATTCTGGAGA-3′ (R1650) using oligo(dT) primed CG-4 cDNA as a template. PCR products were subcloned into pGEM-T Easy (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). To construct a Myc-His-tagged NGC-I vector and a Myc-His-tagged NGC-III vector, another PCR using cDNA encoding either NGC-I or NGC-III as a template with primers 5′-GGGATCCCTGGGACGGGACAGCCCACCAGTCGATGG-3′ (F958BM) and 5′-ACTAGTGGTCAGGTTATTCTGGAGACA-3′ (R1650Sp) was performed, generating 692-and 773-bp fragments. They were subcloned into pGEM-T Easy and digested with KpnI and SpeI to give rise to cDNA fragments encoding the cytoplasmic domain of NGC-I or NGC-III. Each of the resulting fragment was ligated into pcDNA3.1/Myc-His(+) cleaved with BamHI and XbaI together with a 1100-bp BamHI-KpnI fragment from NGC-I cDNA, a sequence common to NGC-I and NGC-III.Domain-specific cDNA clones were obtained by the following PCR: for the full-sized extracellular domain tagged with a FLAG epitope (CSAE-FLAG), the primer F1 and 5′-CTACTACTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAATCGAAGTCGGTGATGATGGACTC-3′ (RFL1280); for the chondroitin sulfate attachment domain (CS domain), F1 and 5′-GACTAGTCTCTAGAGTGCCCTGAAG-3′ (R635); for the signal sequence, F1 and 5′-AGGTACCAAGGCCTCCCGTGCCGGTACAGCCC-3′ (R120); for the acidic amino acid cluster box domain (AB domain), 5′-GGATATCTAGAGACACAACCAGC-3′ (F625) and 5′-GTTCGAACGTGGCCAGGTCCTTGCCTGG-3′ (R1090); for the EGF domain, 5′-GAGGCCTCTGGGACGGGACAGCCCACCAGTCG-3′ (F959ST) and RFL1280. The BamHI-EcoRI fragment encoding CSAE-FLAG, the BamHI-EcoRV fragment encoding the signal sequence, and the StuI-EcoRI fragment encoding the FLAG-tagged EGF domain was ligated into pcDNA3.1(+) cleaved with BamHI and EcoRI. The BamHI-SpeI fragment encoding the CS domain, BamHI-EcoRV fragment encoding the signal sequence, and StuI-SpeI fragment encoding A domain cDNA were ligated into pcDNA3.1/Myc-His(+) cleaved with BamHI and XbaI.Expression of Recombinant Glutathione S-Transferase (GST)-NGC Fusion Protein—The PCR product generated with the primers F1 and R1090 was subcloned into pGEM-T Easy vector and digested by StuI and NotI. The resulting fragment was ligated into pGEX 5X-2 (Amersham Biosciences) cleaved with SmaI and NotI and introduced into Escherichia coli XL1 blue F′. The GST-NGC fusion protein and GST protein were induced by 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and isolated on a glutathione-Sepharose column, and the eluates were further purified by passing through a DEAE-Sepharose column.Expression of Recombinant Mouse MK Tagged with HA (mMK-HA) in Baculovirus System—To generate a transfer vector encoding mouse MK with an HA epitope, PCR was performed using mouse MK cDNA as a template, with primers, 5′-GCCGGATCCATGCAGCACCGAGGCTTCTTC-3′ and 5′-ACTAGCATAATCAGGAACATCATAGTCCTTTCCTTTTCCTTT-3′. The PCR product was subcloned into pGEM-T Easy vector, digested by BamHI and EcoRI, and ligated into pVL1393 cleaved with BamHI and EcoRI. Using the transfer vector, mMK-HA was produced and purified as in the case of mMK (28Akhter S. Ichihara-Tanaka K. Kojima S. Muramatsu H. Inui T. Kimura T. Kaneda N. Talukder A.H. Kadomatsu K.

Eluted fractions were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-NGC antibody or tag-specific antibodies. The binding of GST-NGC fusion protein to MK was evaluated using the BIAcore 3000 system (BIAcore, AB), using BIAevaluation software (BIAcore).Cross-linking of NGC—HEK293T cells overexpressing NGC were washed with ice-cold HBS(+), which contained 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 in HBS (10 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.2, containing 150 mm NaCl), three times, and incubated with HBS(+) containing mMK-HA at 1 μg/ml for 2 h at 4 °C. After being washed with 0.1% bovine serum albumin in HBS(+), cells were treated with 0.27 mm disuccinimidyl suberate (Pierce) for 15 min at 4 °C, and 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 was added to 20 mm as a final concentration. Then, cells were lysed in lysis buffer, which contained 0.6% CHAPS, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 5 μg/ml 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm pepstatin A in HBS.Assay for Process Extension—Each well of a Falcon 1147 plate (BD Biosciences) was incubated with a coating solution for 2 h at 27 °C and washed with sterile water three times. CG-4 cells were trypsinized, suspended with 0.1% soybean trypsin inhibitor in PBS, washed with PBS two times, and seeded at 4 × 104 cells/well in CG-4 medium. CG-4 cells were incubated with a reagent for 10 min and seeded on the MK-coated wells. After 30 min, photographs of five different areas in each well were taken. Based on the photographs, the percentage of cells with processes was quantified. NGC-overexpressing B104 cells and mock-transfected cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium overnight, trypsinized, suspended with 0.1% soybean trypsin inhibitor in PBS, washed with PBS two times, seeded on the wells of Falcon 1147 plates coated with mMK, and also analyzed for process extension.RESULTSCG-4 Cells Express NGC-I and NGC-III as a Non-PG Form—First, we examined the expression of NGC in bipolar CG-4 cells by immunofluorescence microscopy using monoclonal anti-NGC antibody C5 (Fig. 2A). NGC was located in the cell processes and the basal parts of these processes. Then, to study whether NGC expressed in CG-4 cells carries chondroitin sulfate chains, NGC was immunoprecipitated from lysate of CG-4 cells with polyclonal anti-NGC antibodies, incubated with chondroitinase ABC or with buffer alone, and analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 2B). NGC from CG-4 cells behaved as a 100-kDa band on the SDS-PAGE gel irrespective of chondroitinase ABC treatment, whereas NGC from P10 rat brain was 180 kDa before chondroitinase treatment and 100 kDa after the treatment. These results indicate that CG-4 cells expressed NGC and that the non-PG form was predominant.FIGURE 2Expression of NGC in CG-4 cells. A, CG-4 cells seeded on a poly-d-lysine-coated substrate were visualized either by phase contrast microscopy (left panel) or by immunofluorescence microscopy with monoclonal anti-NGC C5 followed by FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (right panel). Arrow, basal area of process. Asterisk, extending edge of process. Bar, 50 μm. B, Western blot analysis of NGC expressed in CG-4 cells and P10 rat brain. CG-4 cells were lysed in the lysis buffer. NGC was isolated by immunoprecipitation with polyclonal anti-NGC antibodies associated with protein A-Sepharose from the lysate of CG-4 cells and the PG-rich fraction of P10 rat brain. Half of each precipitate was treated with chondroitinase ABC (CHase)(+), and the other half was incubated with buffer alone (-). These samples were analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-NGC antibody C5. An arrow represents the position of NGC lacking chondroitin sulfate chains.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Four isoforms due to alternative splicing were reported in NGC (25Aono S.

Res. 2006; 83: 110-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To know what isoforms were expressed in CG-4 cells, we performed reverse transcription-PCR using primers specific for the rat NGC sequence and single-stranded cDNA prepared from CG-4 cells as a template and isolated cDNA encoding the open reading frame of NGC. PCR products were subcloned into pGEM-T Easy, and the DNA sequences of 12 randomly chosen clones were analyzed. Nine of the clones were NGC-I, and the others were NGC-III. They all had the same amino acid sequence in the ectodomain but a different 27-amino acid insert in the cytoplasmic part as already reported. We could not detect the PCR product of NGC-II using primers specific for NGC-II.Binding of Various Forms of NGC to MK—To evaluate the binding of NGC to MK, we performed MK affinity column chromatography using both native NGC and a recombinant NGC lacking glycosaminoglycan chains. First, the lysate of CG-4 cells was applied to an MK-Sepharose column and eluted at 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, and 1 m NaCl. SDS-PAGE and subsequent Western blotting revealed that NGC was eluted with 0.5 m NaCl (Fig. 3A).FIGURE 3Various forms of NGC bind to MK. A, NGC in lysate of CG-4 cells binds to MK. CG-4 cells were lysed in the lysis buffer, applied to an MK-Sepharose column, eluted with increasingly higher concentrations of NaCl, and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-NGC C5. B, a PG-rich fraction of P10 rat brain was applied to an MK-Sepharose column after chondroitinase ABC (CHase) treatment (lower panel) or without enzyme treatment (upper panel) and eluted with increasingly higher concentrations of NaCl. The eluates were immunoprecipitated with polyclonal anti-NGC antibodies associated with protein A-Sepharose and analyzed by Western blotting with monoclonal anti-NGC C5. To obtain a clear band, immunoprecipitated samples without enzyme treatment were digested with chondroitinase ABC before SDS-PAGE. C, purified GST-NGC (50 ng) and GST protein (80 ng) were separated on a 10% gel and silver-stained. D, analysis of the binding of GST-NGC fusion protein (upper panel) and GST (lower panel) to immobilized MK using the BIAcore system, which was equilibrated with 10 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl and 0.005% Tween 20 as a running buffer at a flow rate of 15 μl/min. Recombinant mouse MK (5 μg/ml in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5) was immobilized on the flow cells of the CM5 sensor chip for 7 min using an amine coupling kit (BIAcore) at a flow rate of 5 μl/min according to the instruction manual. The binding assay was performed at 25 °C with a constant flow rate of 15 μl/min in both association and dissociation phases. GST-NGC or GST in a series of concentrations ranging from 80 to 320 nm in the running buffer was injected into the flow cells, and the changes in resonance units (RU) were recorded. Rate constants were determined using BIAevaluation software (BIAcore). Arrow A indicates the beginning of the association phase initiated by injection of each of the sample; arrow B indicates the end of the sample injection or the beginning of the dissociation phase initiated with running buffer.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Second, the PG-rich fraction from P10 rat brain was applied to an MK-Sepharose column before or after chondroitinase ABC treatment (Fig. 3B). Intact NGC was mainly eluted with 0.5 and 0.6 m NaCl, but minor fractions eluted with 0.7 and 1.0 m NaCl were present. After chondroitinase ABC treatment, NGC was mainly eluted with 0.5 m NaCl. These results showed that native NGC from P10 rat brain bound to MK more strongly than that lacking glycosaminoglycan chains. Third, to establish that NGC without glycosaminoglycan chains can bind to MK, we expressed GST-NGC and GST proteins in bacteria and purified them (Fig. 3C). The binding affinity of GST-NGC and GST proteins was analyzed by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy (Fig. 3D). We confirmed that GST-NGC bound to MK, but GST did not.

https://openalex.org/W1976284742,"Cellular calcium homeostasis is regulated by hormones and neurotransmitters, resulting in the activation of a variety of proteins, in particular, channel proteins of the plasma membrane and of intracellular compartments. Such channels are, for example, TRP channels of the TRPC protein family that are activated by various mediators from receptor-stimulated signaling cascades. In Drosophila, two TRPC channels, TRP and TRPL, are involved in phototransduction. In addition, a third Drosophila TRPC channel, TRPγ, has been identified and described as an auxiliary subunit of TRPL. Beyond it, our data show that heterologously expressed TRPγ formed a receptor-activated, outwardly rectifying cation channel independent from TRPL co-expression. Analysis of the activation mechanism revealed that TRPγ is activated by various polyunsaturated fatty acids generated in a phospholipase C- and phospholipase A2-dependent manner. The most potent activator of TRPγ, the stable analogue of arachidonic acid, 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid, induced currents in single channel recordings. Here we show that upon heterologous expression TRPγ forms a homomeric channel complex that is activated by polyunsaturated fatty acids as mediators of receptor-dependent signaling pathways. Reverse transcription PCR analysis showed that TRPγ is expressed in Drosophila heads and bodies. Its body-wide expression pattern and its activation mechanism suggest that TRPγ forms a fly cation channel responsible for the regulation of intracellular calcium in a variety of hormonal signaling cascades."
https://openalex.org/W1987936104,"Movement generated by the myosin motor is generally thought to be driven by distortion of an elastic element within the myosin molecule and subsequent release of the resulting strain. However, the location of this elastic element in myosin remains unclear. The myosin motor domain consists of four major subdomains connected by flexible joints. The SH1 helix is the joint that connects the converter subdomain to the other domains, and is thought to play an important role in arrangements of the converter relative to the motor. To investigate the involvement of the SH1 helix in elastic distortion in myosin, we have introduced a point mutation into the SH1 helix of Dictyostelium myosin II (R689H), which in human nonmuscle myosin IIA causes nonsyndromic hereditary deafness, DFNA17. The mutation resulted in a significant impairment in motile activities, whereas actin-activated ATPase activity was only slightly affected. Single molecule mechanical measurements using optical trap showed that the step size was not shortened by the mutation, suggesting that the slower motility is caused by altered kinetics. The single molecule measurements demonstrated that the mutation significantly reduced cross-bridge stiffness. Motile activities produced by mixtures of wild-type and mutant myosins also suggested that the mutation affected the elasticity of myosin. These results suggest that the SH1 helix is involved in modulation of myosin elasticity, presumably by modulating the converter flexibility. Consistent with this, the mutation was also shown to reduce thermal stability and induce thermal aggregation of the protein, which might be implicated in the disease process.

Class II myosins are actin-based motor proteins that drive cell motile processes including cytokinesis, migration, and morphogenesis, as well as muscle contraction (1Sellers J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1496: 3-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Myosin II molecules consist of two identical heavy chains (HC) 3The abbreviations used are: HC, heavy chain; S1, subfragment 1; DTT, dithiothreitol; BSA, bovine serum albumin; Ni-NTA, nickel nitrilotriacetic acid; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholine)propanesulfonic acid; mhc, myosin heavy chain; N, newton. and two pairs of light chains. The carboxyl-terminal tail region of each HC forms an α-helical coiled-coil rod with the tail of the adjacent HC. Myosin II molecules associate, through the tail region, to assemble into bipolar filaments, which are required for their cellular functions. The amino-terminal head region of the HC forms a globular motor domain with ATPase and motile activities. The myosin motor domain is followed by an extended α-helical neck region, the so-called lever arm domain, to which the two light chains bind. Structural studies revealed that the myosin motor domain consists of four major subdomains that are linked by three flexible, highly conserved joints (2Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Base K.

Szent-Györgi A.G. Cohen C. Cell. 1999; 97: 459-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). A comparison of crystal structures showed conformational changes in the motor with rearrangements of the subdomains during ATP hydrolysis. In particular, the converter subdomain rotates ∼70° during the prestroke-poststroke transition (4Fisher A.J. Smith C.A. Thoden J.B. Smith R. Sutoh K. Holden H.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8960-8972Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar, 5Smith C.A. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8973-8981Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This rotation is thought to drive a long-distance swing of the lever arm domain (6Geeves M.A. Holmes K.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 687-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). In a widely accepted model, the driving force for motion is generated as a result of conformational changes in the myosin head while attaching to the actin filaments. Such conformational changes cause distortion of an elastic element within the myosin molecule and allow strain to develop before movement (7Huxley A.F. Prog. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1957; : 255-318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Relief of this strain can drive relative displacement of the myosin and the actin filaments. It has been suggested that the conformational changes involve the swing of the lever arm domain relative to the motor domain. Nevertheless, the precise location of the elastic element in myosin remains unclear. Recently, Köhler et al. (8Köhler J. Winkler G. Schulte I. Scholz T. McKenna W. Brenner B. Kraft T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3557-3562Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) have studied the mechanical properties of muscle fibers from patients with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and suggested that the main elastic distortion occurs within the converter subdomain or associated structures. The SH1 helix is the joint that links the converter to the NH2-terminal subdomain (Fig. 1A), and is thought to play an important role in arrangements of the converter relative to the motor (3Houdusse A.

Therefore, the SH1 helix may play an important role in distortion of the elastic element in myosin motor. To investigate the involvement of the SH1 helix in the elastic distortion of myosin, we have introduced a point mutation in the SH1 helix of Dictyostelium myosin II. Dictyostelium discoideum contains a single myosin II gene (10De Lozanne A. Lewis M. Spudich J.A. Leinwand L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6807-6810Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), which has been previously disrupted by means of homologous recombination to generate myosin II-null cells (11De Lozanne A. Spudich J.A. Science. 1987; 236: 1086-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). Wild-type and mutated myosins can readily be expressed in myosin II-null cells and characterized in vivo as well as in vitro (12Ruppel K.M. Uyeda T.Q. Spudich J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18773-18780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1B, the SH1 helix region is highly conserved in class II myosins and in Dictyostelium myosin II. The mutation replaces a conserved arginine in the SH1 helix with a histidine (Fig. 1B, bold). This mutation in human nonmuscle myosin IIA (R705H) is linked to nonsyndromic hereditary deafness, DFNA17 (13Lalwani A.K. Goldstein J.A. Kelley M.J. Luxford W. Castelein C.M. Mhatre A.N. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 67: 1121-1128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Recently, Hu et al. (14Hu A. Wang F. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46512-46517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) showed that mutations such as N93K and R702C, which are located within the motor domain of myosin IIA and linked to diseases, result in impairment of in vitro enzymatic and motile activities. The R705H mutation may also affect myosin II activity, whereas its effects on the in vitro activities have not been examined. In this study, we engineered the mutation at an equivalent site in the Dictyostelium myosin II (R689H), and studied motile activities and mechanical properties of the mutant protein. The mutation resulted in a significant impairment in motile activities. Single molecule mechanical measurements using optical trap revealed that the elastic property of myosin is modulated by the mutation. The mutation was also shown to affect thermal stability of the protein, which might be implicated in the disease process. Construction of Plasmids—The R689H mutation was introduced into the Dictyostelium myosin heavy chain (mhc) gene (10De Lozanne A. Lewis M. Spudich J.A. Leinwand L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6807-6810Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) using two-step PCR-based mutagenesis (15Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2104) Google Scholar). In the first PCR, two fragments containing the mutation were generated separately. The 5′ fragment was amplified using the 5′ primer 5′-GTCATGTATGAGATTCAAGATTGG-3′ and the 3′ mutagenic primer 5′-TGGGAAACCTTTATGAGTAATACGA-3′. The 3′ fragment was amplified using the 3′ primer 5′-GAGTCGGTGAGATTAGATTTGAGT-3′ and the 5′ mutagenic primer 5′-TCGTATTACTCATAAAGGTTTCCCA-3′. The mutagenic primers shared an overlapping region, such that these two fragments could be recombined and the whole fragment was amplified with the 5′ and 3′ primers through a second round of PCR. The resulting fragment was digested with BglII/NcoI, and was used to replace the corresponding region of the mhc gene in pTIKLMyDAP (16Liu X. Ito K. Lee R.J. Uyeda T.Q. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). For expression of the S1 fragment of the mutant, the BglII-NcoI fragment of pTIKLOES1 (17Uyeda T.Q. Tokuraku K. Kaseda K. Webb M.R. Patterson B. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9525-9534Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) was replaced with that of the mutant. Preparation of Proteins—Plasmids carrying either the mutant or wild-type mhc gene were introduced into Dictyostelium cells lacking the endogenous mhc gene (11De Lozanne A. Spudich J.A. Science. 1987; 236: 1086-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). Plasmids carrying S1 were introduced into Dictyostelium Ax2 cells. All transformants were selected in HL5 medium containing 10 μg/ml G418. Myosins were prepared by combining the methods of Clarke et al. (18Clarke M. Spudich J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 86: 209-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and Ruppel et al. (12Ruppel K.M. Uyeda T.Q. Spudich J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18773-18780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with some modifications. In brief, washed cells were resuspended in 2.5-4 volumes/g cells in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 40 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mm EDTA, 30% sucrose, 1 mm DTT, and a mixture of protease inhibitors). The cell suspension was sonicated on ice until >95% of the cells were lysed. Cell extracts were clarified by sequential centrifugation at 15,000 and 300,000 × g. The resultant supernatant was dialyzed against a buffer containing 10 mm MOPS (pH 6.8), 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm DTT. After the addition of 0.1% Triton X-100 to solubilize membranes, the cytoskeletal fraction was collected by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet was washed with extraction buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 250 mm NaCl, 7 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT), and centrifuged again. The resultant pellet was resuspended in extraction buffer containing 5 mm ATP, and centrifuged at 300,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was recovered and diluted five times with a buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, and 1 mm DTT. For phosphorylation of the regulatory light chains of myosins, the solution was incubated overnight on ice with myosin light chain kinase according to Ruppel et al. (12Ruppel K.M. Uyeda T.Q. Spudich J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18773-18780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphorylated myosin was recovered by centrifugation at 110,000 × g for 12 min. The pellet was dissolved in a buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 250 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, and 1 mm DTT, and finally centrifuged at 300,000 × g for 20 min to remove insoluble materials. S1 fragments were prepared as described previously (19Sasaki N. Ohkura R. Sutoh K. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 90-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), with slight modifications. They were extracted from the cytoskeletal fraction with a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 7 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Once purified using a Ni-NTA-agarose column (Qiagen), the proteins were dialyzed against an assay buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 25 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, and 1mm DTT). F-actin was extracted and prepared from acetone powder of rabbit skeletal muscle as described previously (20Pardee J.D. Spudich J.A. Methods Cell. Biol. 1982; 24: 271-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Actin concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using an extinction coefficient of 0.63 cm2 mg-1 at 290 nm (21Houk Jr., T.W. Ue K. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 62: 66-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Concentrations of myosins and S1s were determined by the Bradford method using BSA as standard. In Vitro Motility Assay—Phosphorylated myosins were incubated with F-actin, and centrifuged after addition of ATP to remove denatured myosin, as described previously (22Ito K. Uyeda T.Q. Suzuki Y. Sutoh K. Yamamoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31049-31057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Myosins were introduced at a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml into a flow chamber with a nitrocellulose-coated coverslip. The surface was subsequently blocked with 1 mg/ml BSA. To assay thermally inactivated proteins, the flow chamber, containing a BSA solution, was incubated in a block incubator at 40 °C for 2.5-25 min. Finally, a motility solution (25 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 7.5), 25 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, and oxygen scavengers (4 mg/ml glucose, 0.2 mg/ml glucose oxidase, and 30 μg/ml catalase)) containing 0.2% methylcellulose, 5 nm F-actin labeled with rhodamine-phalloidin, and 1 mm or 50 μm ATP was applied to the flow chamber. The sliding of actin filaments was observed at 25 °C, and analyzed as described previously (23Chaen S. Nakaya M. Guo X.F. Watabe S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 788-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Average velocity was determined by measuring displacement of actin filaments moving smoothly for 5 s or longer. Analysis of Motility Generated by Myosin Mixtures—Under the “Appendix” of their paper, Cuda et al. (24Cuda G. Pate E. Cooke R. Sellers J.R. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1767-1779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) have proposed an analytical expression for the sliding velocity produced by myosin mixtures. Here, based on a formula obtained by Howard (25Howard J. Mechanics of Motor Proteins and the Cytoskeleton. Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA2001Google Scholar), we provide a slightly modified expression for the sliding velocity generated by mixtures of wild-type and mutant myosins. According to a simple two-state cross-bridge model that was originally proposed by Huxley (7Huxley A.F. Prog. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1957; : 255-318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Howard gave an expression for the average force as, 〈F〉=1/2(κΔ+2/d){1-exp(-kmaxd/V)}(1-2V2t-2Δ+2) where κ is the cross-bridge stiffness, δ+ is the powerstroke distance, d is the path distance, kmax is the maximum ATPase rate, t- is the drag time, and V is the sliding velocity. In a mixture of a fraction, σ, of the wild-type myosin and the corresponding fraction, 1 - σ, of the mutant myosin, the unloaded sliding velocity, V, will be the velocity for which σ 〈Fw 〉 + (1 - σ) 〈Fm 〉 = 0, where subscripts w and m denote the contributions from wild-type and mutant myosins, respectively. As described below, a steady-state ATPase assay showed that the difference in kmax between the wild-type and mutant myosins is small. Similarly, optical trap measurements showed that δ+ is similar for the wild-type and mutant myosins. Given that d is invariable, the balance of forces is given by, σ(1/2κwΔ+2-κwV2t-w2)+(1-σ)(1/2κmΔ+2-κmV2t-m2)=0 where κw and κm are elastic constants for the wild-type and mutant myosins, respectively. Solving for the unloaded sliding velocity V, V=Vw{σ+η(1-σ)}1/2/{σ+η(1-σ)(Vw/Vm)2}1/2 where (Vw=d+/(v2t-w) and (Vm=d+/(v2t-m) are the sliding velocity generated by the wild-type and mutant myosins alone, respectively, and η = κm/κw is the ratio of the elastic constants of the two myosins. Velocity data of the mixtures was fitted to Equation 3 using non-linear least-squares fitting. ATPase Assays—Basal and actin-activated Mg-ATPase activities were determined by measuring the release of phosphate at 25 °C using the methods of Kodama et al. (26Kodama T. Fukui K. Kometani K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1986; 99: 1465-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures contained S1s (25-200 μg/ml) and various concentrations of F-actin (0-50 μm) in the assay buffer. Reactions were started by adding 1/5 volume of 6 mm ATP, and were stopped by adding 4 volumes of 0.3 m perchloric acid. To assay thermally inactivated proteins, reaction mixtures were incubated in a block incubator at 40 °C for 5-30 min before the addition of ATP. Laser Trap Experiments—The flow chamber used in the experiments was constructed from a 24 × 32-mm2 coverslip coated with 2.3-μm silica beads (Bangs Lab) suspended in 0.1% nitrocellulose in amyl acetate, and a 18 × 18-mm2 coverslip that were separated with a layer of silicon grease and two strips of adhesive tape. The chamber was first incubated with 0.25 μm Ni-NTA horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Qiagen) for 3 min, followed by an addition of 1 mg/ml BSA for 3 min. Purified S1 proteins were then applied to the chamber at a concentration of 1 μg/ml. At this concentration, the probability that myosinactin interaction was detected was <0.25, so that the probability that two or more myosins was bind to actin filaments would be <0.05. Following a 3-min incubation to allow the S1s to bind to the Ni-NTA horseradish peroxidase conjugate, the chamber was washed with 1 mg/ml BSA in the motility solution. Polystyrene beads (1 μm, Molecular Probes) were coated with N-ethylmaleimide-myosin according to Veigel et al. (27Veigel C. Bartoo M.L. White D.C. Sparrow J.C. Molloy J.E. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 1424-1438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Finally, the chamber was filled with the motility solution containing 5 nm F-actin labeled with rhodamine-phalloidin, N-ethylmaleimidemyosin-coated beads, and 1 μm ATP, before the measurements were made. Single molecule mechanical measurements of S1s were performed using optical trap with the “three-bead” configuration as described by other investigators (27Veigel C. Bartoo M.L. White D.C.

Nature. 1995; 378: 209-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). In brief, an infrared laser (1064 nm, 1000 milliwatts, IRCL-1W-1064; CrystaLaser) was split into two beams, using polarizing beam-splitters, to trap the two beads. A N-ethylmaleimide-myosin-coated bead was caught in each of the two laser traps, and each bead was attached to the end of the fluorescently labeled actin filaments. The actin filament was pulled taut (2 pN), and positioned over a silica bead. A ×60 oil immersion objective lens (PlanApo, NA 1.45; Olympus) was used for the optical trapping procedures and observations of the fluorescent actin filaments. The epifluorescence images of actin filaments and beads, both of which were excited by a green laser (532 nm, 25 milliwatt, GCL-025-L; CrystaLaser) were captured by an image intensifier (VS4-1845; VideoScope) and CCD camera (XC-ST50; Sony). The trapped bead image was illuminated by a halogen lamp and was projected onto a quadrant photodiode (S994-13; Hamamattsu-Photonics) to measure the bead displacement. The output from the quadrant photodiode was sampled at 10 kHz and stored in a personal computer by an AD converter (PowerLab/4sp, AD Instruments) to be analyzed off-line. The calibration of the bead displacement was performed by moving the stage on which the quadrant photodiode was mounted. The trap stiffness, κtrap, was determined by measuring the Brownian motion of the bead (variance, 〈x 〉2) and applying the equipartition law (1/2κ 〈x 〉2trap = 1/2kBT) (27Veigel C. Bartoo M.L. White D.C. Sparrow J.C. Molloy J.E. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 1424-1438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 29Molloy J.E. Burns J.E. Kendrick-Jones J. Tregear R.T. White D.C. Nature. 1995; 378: 209-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). The laser trap experiments were performed at 23 °C at a trap stiffness of 0.05 pN nm-1. Light Scattering—Kinetics of thermal aggregation were determined by measuring light scattering of S1 solutions at 500 nm. The absorbance of 0.3 mg/ml S1 proteins in the assay buffer was measured in 1-cm cells using a DU 640 spectrophotometer (Beckman Coulter). Samples were maintained at 40 °C using circulating water. A probe thermometer (Anritsu) confirmed the temperature of cell contents. Apparent first-order rate constants of aggregation were determined from the slope of the Guggenheim plot. In Vivo Functions of Myosins—To examine the effects of mutation at Arg-705 within the SH1 helix on activities of myosin II, we have engineered the mutation at an equivalent site in Dictyostelium myosin II (R689H), and expressed the mutant in Dictyostelium myosin II-null cells. We first assessed the in vivo functions of the mutant myosin. Dictyostelium myosin II-null cells were unable to grow in suspension culture or to form fruiting bodies under starvation, providing evidence that myosin II was involved in cytokinesis and morphogenesis (11De Lozanne A. Spudich J.A. Science. 1987; 236: 1086-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). Myosin II-null cells expressing the R689H myosin grew only slightly more slowly than cells expressing wild-type myosin (doubling time, 16.6 and 14.3 h). The cells expressing the mutant developed completely to form normal fruiting bodies comparable with those of the cells expressing the wild-type myosin (Fig. 2). Thus, the R689H mutation only slightly affects functions of myosin II for normal growth and development of Dictyostelium cells. These results suggested that the mutant myosin retained some of the motile activities. Motile Activities of Myosins—To reveal in vitro activities of the mutant myosin, we purified wild-type and R689H myosin proteins and determined their motile activities using an in vitro motility assay. At a concentration of 1 mm ATP, R689H myosin moved actin filaments at an average velocity of 0.4 μms-1, whereas wild-type myosin moved actin filaments at 1.9 μms-1 (Fig. 3). The sliding velocity generated by mutant myosin was decreased to ∼20% of that generated by wild-type myosin. This result indicated that the R689H mutation in myosin II resulted in significant impairment in motile activity under physiological conditions. In contrast, at 50 μm ATP, the wild-type and mutant myosins exhibited comparable sliding velocities (Fig. 3). This result suggested that some steps other than ATP-induced actin-myosin dissociation were decelerated by the R689H mutation. ATPase Activities of S1s—To determine whether the mutation affects ATPase activities in solution, we expressed mutant S1, the soluble fragment of myosin. The basal Mg-ATPase activity of R689H S1 was 1.8 times higher than that of wild-type S1 (Table 1), suggesting that phosphate release was accelerated by the mutation. Fig. 4 shows actin-activated Mg-ATPase activities of wild-type and R689H S1s. They showed comparable activities over the range of the actin concentrations used. Fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation yielded similar values of Vmax for wild-type and R689H S1s (Table 1). These results suggested that the R689H mutant retained normal actin activation of ATPase activities. This indicated that ATPase activity was not entirely coupled to motile activity for the mutant. Furthermore, R689H showed a somewhat lower Kactin (Table 1), suggesting that the mutant might have a higher affinity for actin in the presence of ATP.TABLE 1Kinetic parameters of steady-state ATPase activities of S1sBasalVmaxKactins−1μMWild type0.11 ± 0.0061.1255.0R689H0.20 ± 0.0061.0230.0 Open table in a new tab Single Molecule Mechanics of S1s—The sliding velocity of actin filaments in an in vitro motility assay is related to the step size and time spent in the strongly actin-bound state (30Spudich J.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 515-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). To determine the mechanism underlying the reduction in motility, we performed single molecule mechanical measurements of wild-type and mutant S1s using an optical trap. Here, we have used S1 fragments to reveal the mechanical properties of a single myosin head. The S1 proteins contained a His tag at the COOH terminus to be attached to the substrate via horseradish peroxidase conjugated with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid. At low surface densities of the S1 molecules and in the presence of 1 μm ATP, both the wild type and R689H behaved similarly to other myosin II derivatives (27Veigel C. Bartoo M.L. White D.C.

Nature. 1995; 378: 209-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). They showed transient events of reduced thermal noise, presumably due to binding of a myosin to the actin filaments (Fig. 5A). Distributions of individual mean displacements produced by wild-type or mutant S1s are shown in Fig. 5B. These were fitted by single Gaussian distributions with a S.D. matching the combined stiffness of the optical trap (σ = (kBT/κtrap)½ ≈ 9 nm). The average step size of the myosin working stroke can be estimated from the positional shifts of these distributions. For the wild-type and R689H S1s, the average step size was not significantly different (p = 0.32, Student's t test), with values of ∼3 nm. Because our results were uncorrected for system elasticity, the step size may be underestimated. In the absence of ADP and at low concentrations of ATP, the duration of myosin attachments is primarily limited by the ATP-induced actin-myosin dissociation step, with the second-order ATP-induced dissociation rate constant (31Baker J.E. Brosseau C. Joel P.B. Warshaw D.M. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 2134-2147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Fig. 5C shows distributions of the duration of attachments for the wild-type and R689H S1s at 1 μm ATP. The distributions were fitted by single exponentials with rate constants of 0.4 and 1.3 s-1 for the wild-type and R689H, respectively. The rate constant of the wild-type dissociation was comparable with that of ATP-induced actin-Dictyostelium S1 dissociation at low ATP concentrations obtained from solution studies (17Uyeda T.Q. Tokuraku K. Kaseda K. Webb M.R. Patterson B. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9525-9534Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 22Ito K. Uyeda T.Q. Suzuki Y. Sutoh K. Yamamoto K. J. Biol.

A. 1993; 90: 8619-8623Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These results suggested that a single myosin molecule was responsible for the individual mechanical events. The dissociation of the mutant was somewhat faster than that of the wild-type S1. This result is consistent with the finding that the wild-type and mutant myosins exhibited comparable sliding velocities at 50 μm ATP in an in vitro motility assay. We also estimated total stiffness during the attachments, by applying the equipartition law to Brownian motion of the beads (27Veigel C. Bartoo M.L. White D.C. Sparrow J.C. M"

DNA binding by SNAPC involves direct DNA contacts by the SNAP190 subunit in cooperation with SNAP50 and SNAP43. The data presented herein shows that SNAP50 plays an important role in DNA binding by SNAPC through its zinc finger domain. The SNAP50 zinc finger domain contains 15 cysteine and histidine residues configured in two potential zinc coordination arrangements. Individual alanine substitution of each cysteine and histidine residue demonstrated that eight sites are important for DNA binding by SNAPC. However, metal binding studies revealed that SNAPC contains a single zinc atom indicating that only one coordination site functions as a zinc finger. Of the eight residues critical for DNA binding, four cysteine residues were also essential for both U1 and U6 transcription by RNA polymerase II and III, respectively. Surprisingly, the remaining four residues, although critical for U1 transcription could support partial U6 transcription. DNA binding studies showed that defects in DNA binding by SNAPC alone could be suppressed through cooperative DNA binding with another member of the RNA polymerase III general transcription machinery, TFIIIB. These results suggest that these eight cysteine and histidine residues perform different functions during DNA binding with those residues involved in zinc coordination likely performing a dominant role in domain stabilization and the others involved in DNA binding.

Biol. 1998; 63: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Human snRNA genes are defined by the presence of a diagnostic promoter element called the proximal sequence element (PSE). For both polymerase systems, the PSE recruits the general transcription factor called SNAPC (3Sadowski C.L. Henry R.W. Lobo S.M. Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1535-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), which is also known as PTF (4Murphy S. Yoon J.B. Gerster T. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3247-3261Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). SNAPC is composed of at least five subunits SNAP190, SNAP50, SNAP45, SNAP43, and SNAP19 (5Henry R.W. Sadowski C.L. Kobayashi R. Hernandez N. Nature. 1995; 374: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 6Henry R.W. Ma B. Sadowski C.L. Kobayashi R. Hernandez N.

Biol. 1998; 18: 368-377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SNAP190 can interact with all the other subunits, and provides a central architectural backbone to the complex (10Ma B. Hernandez N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5027-5035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). SNAP190 directly interacts with the transcriptional activator protein Oct-1 during stimulated transcription of human snRNA genes (11Ford E. Strubin M. Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3528-3540Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 12Mittal V. Ma B. Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1807-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In the RNA polymerase III pathway, SNAP190 also interacts with TBP to recruit Brf2-TFIIIB to the TATA box of human U6 snRNA genes (13Ma B. Hernandez N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8067-8078Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 14Hinkley C.S. Hirsch H.A. Gu L. LaMere B. Henry R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18649-18657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Thus, the upstream signal from Oct-1 is conveyed through SNAP190 stimulating preinitiation complex assembly with other general transcription factors as a prerequisite for RNA polymerase III recruitment. Interestingly, protein kinase CK2 can phosphorylate SNAP190 to impede DNA binding; however, promoter recognition by SNAPC can be restored by cooperative binding of TBP to those promoter sequences containing both a PSE and TATA box, but not sequences lacking the TATA element (15Gu L. Esselman W.J. Henry R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27697-27704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). This last observation suggests that CK2 can differentially influence RNA polymerase II and III snRNA transcription by covalent modification of SNAPC to alter its DNA binding properties even though SNAPC is shared between both polymerase systems. The specific binding of SNAPC to the PSE is mediated by a Myb-like DNA binding domain within the NH2-terminal region of SNAP190. Other SNAPC subunits may additionally function in PSE recognition and provide stabilizing contacts with DNA. Indeed, UV cross-linking experiments suggest that both SNAP190 (16Yoon J.B. Murphy S. Bai L. Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2019-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and SNAP50 (6Henry R.W. Ma B. Sadowski C.L. Kobayashi R. Hernandez N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7129-7136Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) are in close contact with DNA. In addition, SNAP50 contains an unusual arrangement of cysteine and histidine residues at the carboxyl-terminal region of the protein that is evolutionarily conserved. In other transcription factors, zinc finger motifs function for nucleic acid binding and/or protein-protein interactions (17Krishna S.S. Majumdar I. Grishin N.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 532-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). In the current study, we have focused on the function for the zinc finger region of SNAP50, and we show that this region is critical for DNA binding by SNAPC. The arrangement of cysteine and histidine residues within SNAP50 further defines this region as an unorthodox zinc finger domain that functions in divergent preinitiation complex assembly pathways for RNA polymerase II and III transcription. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—For the EMSA shown in Fig. 1A, mini-SNAPC was assembled from subunits individually expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described before (14Hinkley C.S. Hirsch H.A. Gu L. LaMere B. Henry R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18649-18657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The partial complex SNAPCγ4 was obtained by co-expression in E. coli of SNAP190-(1-505), SNAP43, SNAP19, and either wild-type or mutant SNAP50. The complex was purified as described (18Hanzlowsky A. Jelencic B. Jawdekar G.W. Hinkley C.S. Geiger J.H. Henry R.W. Protein Expression Purif. 2006; 48: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). TBP was expressed as a GST fusion protein in E. coli and purified as described (14Hinkley C.S. Hirsch H.A. Gu L. LaMere B. Henry R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18649-18657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The Brf2 and Bdp1-(1-470) proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified as described before (19Schramm L. Pendergrast P.S. Sun Y. Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2650-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In all cases, GST tags were removed prior to use in functional assays by thrombin digestion during purification. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—EMSA was performed in a 20-μl total volume using DNA probes containing a wild-type or mutant mouse U6 PSE with a mutant human U6 TATA box, or containing the wild-type human U6 sequence, as described previously (14Hinkley C.S. Hirsch H.A. Gu L. LaMere B. Henry R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18649-18657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). DNA binding reactions using only SNAPC were performed in a buffer containing 60 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 0.5 μg of pUC119 plasmid. Reactions were incubated for 20 min at room temperature after which 5,000 cpm of probe was added, and reactions were incubated an additional 20 min. Samples were fractionated on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel (39:1) in TGE running buffer (50 mm Tris, 380 mm glycine, 2 mm EDTA). Reactions containing both SNAPCγ4 and TBP were performed in a buffer containing 100 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.07% Tween 20, 0.2 μg of poly(dG-dC), and 0.2 μg of pUC119 plasmid. The samples were fractionated on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel (39:1) in TGEM running buffer (50 mm Tris, 380 mm glycine, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2). Approximately 1 ng of SNAPCγ4, 50 ng of human TBP, 240 ng of Brf2, and 40 ng of Bdp1-(1-470) was used, as indicated. GST Pulldown and Immunoprecipitation Assays—GST pull-down assays were done as described before (14Hinkley C.S. Hirsch H.A. Gu L. LaMere B. Henry R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18649-18657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). For the immunoprecipitation assays performed in Fig. 2B, ∼20 ng of each complex containing SNAP50 with the indicated point mutation was used with 1 μl of α-SNAP43 antibody, preimmune sera, or buffer alone. Immunoprecipitation reactions were carried out in HEMGT-150 buffer (25 mm HEPES, 0.1 mm EDTA, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Tween 20, 150 mm KCl) containing protease inhibitors and 1 mm dithiothreitol at 4 °C for 2 h. The immunoprecipitated material was collected by incubation with Protein G-agarose beads at 4 °C for 2 h. Beads were then collected, washed 5 times with HEMGT-150, and the bound protein was released by boiling in Laemmli buffer. Recovered proteins were resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane for Western blotting using anti-HA antibodies. In Vitro Transcription Assays—Endogenous SNAPC was removed from HeLa extracts by anti-SNAP43 antibody immunodepletion as described before (8Henry R.W. Mittal V. Ma B. Kobayashi R. Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2664-2672Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In vitro transcription of human U1 and U6 snRNA genes was performed for 1 h at 30 °C using the depleted extract. Approximately 5 ng of wild-type and mutant SNAPCγ4 complexes containing point mutations in SNAP50 were used for the reconstitution of both U1 and U6 transcription. Zinc Binding Studies—The amount of zinc associated with recombinant SNAPC was determined by two methods: 1) inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and 2) flame atomic absorption. For the ICP-MS studies, SNAPC protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The molecular weights of recombinant SNAPCγ4 and SNAPCγ3 were calculated as 159,735 and 148,432 g/mol, respectively. To measure zinc concentration, sample solutions were transferred to a Teflon vial and brought to dryness on a hot plate. Concentrated nitric acid was added and the sample was placed on the hot plate and hydrolyzed for 30 min. After cooling, the sample was diluted with water to bring the acid concentration to 2%, and 2% nitric acid was added to bring the solution to the desired volume. Nickel and zinc standards (Spex Certiprep) in the concentration range from 0 to 1000 ppb were prepared in 2% nitric acid. Samples and standards were each mixed with 20 ppb indium and bismuth standard solution (Spex Certiprep) as internal standards. Samples were analyzed on an ICP-MS instrument (GV Instruments) with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. 66Zn, 68Zn, and 60Ni isotopes were measured and quantified. The responses for zinc and nickel were corrected according to indium and bismuth response. For the flame atomic absorption studies, SNAPC protein concentration was determined by UV absorbance in 6 m urea at 280 nm. The molar extinction coefficient of 176,950 cm-1 m-1 was used to calculate the molar concentration. SNAPC samples were transferred to a crucible, dried, and ashed at 260 °C. Concentrated nitric acid was added to the ash and reheated until only white powder remained. The sample was reconstituted with 5% nitric acid. Zinc standards in the concentration range from 10 to 1000 ppb were prepared from zinc metal (Spectrum, 99.9%) dissolved in concentrated nitric acid. The samples and standards were analyzed on the flame atomic absorption instrument (Varian SpectrAA-200) equipped with a zinc hollow cathode lamp operating at 213.9 nm. Aspiration rate was 1 ml/min. For the zinc analysis shown in Fig. 6, wild-type or mutant SNAP50-(315-411) was expressed as a NH2-terminal His-SUMO fusion protein from pET28a in E. coli RIL codon plus. Cells were grown in LB broth containing kanamycin (100 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (50 μg/ml) supplemented with 50 μm ZnCl2. Approximately 1 liter of culture was used for the expression and purification of each protein. Cells were ruptured by sonication in buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 350 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 10 mm imidazole, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol) supplemented with 10 μm ZnCl2. His-tagged recombinant proteins were purified by nickel column chromatography followed by elution with buffer A containing 400 mm imidazole without added zinc. Protein containing fractions were dialyzed against buffer A containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and no added zinc for 10 h at 4 °C for subsequent flame atomic absorption analysis, which was performed as above using ∼2 ml of each protein solution (∼1 mg/ml) with an aspiration rate of 5 ml/min. Protein concentration was determined in 6 m urea by UV absorbance at 280 nm. The molar extinction coefficient of 27,305 cm-1 m-1 was used to calculate the molar concentration of the wild type and mutant His-SUMO-SNAP50-(315-411) proteins. Zinc measurements and protein determination were done in triplicate. Structural Modeling—Two protocols were followed to obtain ab initio predictions of SNAP50-(301-411). First, the amino acid sequence of SNAP50 was submitted to the Robetta server (21Kim D.E. Chivian D. Baker D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W526-W531Crossref PubMed Scopus (1370) Google Scholar), and 10 models were obtained. Second, lattice-based sampling from extended chains with MONSSTER (22Skolnick J. Kolinski A. Ortiz A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 217-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) and the MMTSB Tool Set (23Feig M. Karanicolas J. Brooks 3rd, C.L. J. Mol. Graph. Model. 2004; 22: 377-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar) were carried out. 2000 structures were generated in independent runs. The resulting structures were subjected to a short minimization with CHARMM (24Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comput. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (14019) Google Scholar) and evaluated with the scoring function DFIRE (25Zhang C. Liu S. Zhu Q. Zhou Y. J. Med. Chem. 2005; 48: 2325-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Correlation-based scores were obtained from the original DFIRE scores according to a recently published method for enhancing scoring functions in protein structure prediction applications (26Stumpff-Kane A.W. Feig M. Proteins. 2006; 63: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The structures were then clustered and average correlation-based scores were compared between clusters. The structure with the highest correlation-based score from the cluster with the highest average correlation-based score and more than one member was then examined and subjected to further refinement through energy minimization and constrained short molecular dynamic simulations with CHARMM. The electrostatic potential on the surface of the final structure was calculated from solutions of the Poisson equation with the PBEQ module (27Im W. Beglov D. Roux B. Comput. Phys. Commun. 1998; 111: 59-75Crossref Google Scholar) in CHARMM. The program VMD was used for visualization of the final model and electrostatic surface maps (28Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (39890) Google Scholar). The COOH-terminal Region of SNAP50 Is Required for DNA Binding by SNAPC—Promoter recognition by SNAPC is a common early event in both RNA polymerase II- and III-specific pathways of pre-initiation complex formation at human snRNA genes. Whereas the mechanism for PSE binding by SNAPC is not well understood, this initial event requires extensive cooperation among SNAP43, SNAP50, and SNAP190, as indicated by the data in Fig. 1A. EMSA reactions containing all three subunits supported robust binding by mini-SNAPC to wild-type (lane 7) but not mutant PSE probes (lane 8), whereas no detectable DNA binding was observed in reactions that lacked all three complex members (lanes 1-6), consistent with results previously described (14Hinkley C.S. Hirsch H.A. Gu L. LaMere B. Henry R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18649-18657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Thus, even though SNAP190 contains a bona fide Myb DNA binding domain, additional components of the complex are required, perhaps serving to directly recognize the PSE alongside SNAP190. Whereas the previous experiment was performed with three factors, we postulate that the recognition of DNA by SNAPC likely involves direct DNA contacts provided by SNAP50 in addition to the contributions made by SNAP190. First, SNAP50 was UV cross-linked to the PSE during DNA binding by endogenous SNAPC (6Henry R.W. Ma B. Sadowski C.L. Kobayashi R. Hernandez N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7129-7136Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), indicating that SNAP50 is in close proximity to DNA during promoter recognition. Second, SNAP50 contains a putative zinc finger domain within the COOH-terminal region, and as zinc finger domains are typically involved in nucleic acid binding and/or protein-protein interactions, we hypothesized that this region of SNAP50 is involved in DNA binding by SNAPC. To test this idea, EMSA were performed using mini-SNAPC containing SNAP50 that lacked the COOH-terminal cysteine/histidine-rich region. In support of the hypothesis, DNA binding by mini-SNAPC was completely ablated in reactions performed with SNAP50-(1-300) lacking the cysteine/histidine-rich region (lanes 15-17), as compared with comparable amounts of mini-SNAPC containing wild-type SNAP50 (lanes 12-14). In these reactions, the assembly of SNAP50-(1-300) into a complex along with SNAP43 and SNAP190-(1-505) was as efficient as that observed for wild-type SNAP50 (data not shown), suggesting that those protein-protein interactions required for complex formation are not seriously jeopardized by removal of the cysteine/histidine-rich region. Indeed, strong pairwise interactions between SNAP50 and SNAP43, its major partner in SNAPC, were maintained for truncated SNAP50 molecules lacking this region (Fig. 1B). In GST pulldown experiments, GST-SNAP43 interacted well with full-length SNAP50-(1-411), SNAP50-(1-300), and SNAP50-(1-199), but not with SNAP50-(1-124) nor with the cysteine/histidine-rich region alone (SNAP50-301-411). These data support the idea that the central region of SNAP50 participates in complex assembly with SNAP43, whereas the COOH-terminal cysteine/histidine-rich region constitutes a DNA binding domain within SNAP50. The requirement for the SNAP50 cysteine/histidine-rich region for DNA binding by SNAPC suggests that this region of SNAP50 constitutes a zinc finger domain. To determine whether zinc is indeed bound by SNAPC, the ratio of zinc associated with a recombinant SNAPC containing HA epitope-tagged SNAP50 along with SNAP190-(1-505), SNAP43, and SNAP19 (hereafter referred to as SNAPCγ4) was determined by ICP-MS. SNAPCγ4 was chosen for this study because this recombinant complex, assembled by co-expression of each subunit in E. coli, is fully functional for PSE-specific DNA binding and for snRNA gene transcription by both RNA polymerases II and III (18Hanzlowsky A. Jelencic B. Jawdekar G.W. Hinkley C.S. Geiger J.H. Henry R.W. Protein Expression Purif. 2006; 48: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), and zinc binding under functional conditions could be examined. As shown in Table 1, ∼1.2 mol of zinc, as measured for both 66Zn and 68Zn, were found associated with each mole of SNAPCγ4, whereas little detectable nickel was associated with SNAPCγ4. Similar data were obtained for two separate SNAPCγ4 preparations. These results are comparable with those obtained by atomic absorption indicating a molar ratio (number of zinc/SNAPCγ4) of 0.9 for the four-subunit SNAPCγ4 complex, and for the three-subunit SNAPCγ3 complex lacking SNAP19. As no other SNAPC subunits besides SNAP50 contain suitable arrangements of cysteines and/or histidines for zinc coordination, the parsimonious explanation of these data is that SNAPCγ4 contains a single SNAP50 subunit that binds a single zinc atom.TABLE 1Zinc and nickel analysis of recombinant SNAPc as determined by inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry and flame atomic absorptionMethod 1: ICP-MSSample[Zn][Ni][Protein]No. (Zn)/(protein)No. (Ni)/(protein)ppbmg/mlSNAPcγ4 (1)1250.4aTotal zinc calculated from Zn56; MWSNAPcγ4 - 159,735 g/mol.2.61.21268.5bTotal zinc calculated from Zn58; MWSNAPcγ3 - 148,432 g/mol.2.61.117.92.60.02SNAPcγ4 (2)1415.5aTotal zinc calculated from Zn56; MWSNAPcγ4 - 159,735 g/mol.2.91.21443.6bTotal zinc calculated from Zn58; MWSNAPcγ3 - 148,432 g/mol.2.91.235.52.90.03Method 2: atomic absorptionSample[Zn][Protein]No. (Zn)/(protein)ppbmg/mlSNAPcγ4 (1)1956.85.30.90SNAPcγ31642.24.10.91a Total zinc calculated from Zn56; MWSNAPcγ4 - 159,735 g/mol.b Total zinc calculated from Zn58; MWSNAPcγ3 - 148,432 g/mol. Open table in a new tab An Evolutionarily Conserved Zinc Finger Domain in Human SNAP50 Functions for DNA Binding—The amino acid sequence for the human SNAP50 zinc finger domain is shown in Fig. 2A, which reveals an unorthodox arrangement of cysteines and histidines within the COOH-terminal 110 amino acids. Typically, zinc finger domains that function for DNA binding are constituted by multiple repeats of related zinc finger motifs (17Krishna S.S. Majumdar I. Grishin N.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 532-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). However, the putative DNA binding domain of human SNAP50 contains nine cysteines and six histidines that can be grouped into region 1 loosely resembling a TFIIIA-like C2H2 zinc finger and region 2 resembling a glucocorticoid-like C2C2 zinc finger. Whereas both types of motifs in other proteins are involved in direct DNA contacts, the discordant arrangement of zinc finger motifs suggests that DNA binding by SNAP50 is distinct from mechanisms employed by other zinc finger proteins. In addition, as SNAPCγ4 contains only a single zinc atom, it is likely that only one of the potential zinc fingers actually coordinates zinc. Interestingly, the results of a BLAST homology search show that of the 15 potential zinc coordination sites in this region, eight are highly conserved among putative SNAP50 homologues from mammals, insects (Drosophila and Anopheles), fish (Danio), worms (Caenorhabditis elegans), plants (Arabadopsis), slime mold (Dictyostelium), and parasites from Trypanosoma, Entamoeba, Plasmodium, and Leishmania genera. This comparison also shows that the critical zinc coordination sites within region 2 that constitute the gluco-corticoid-like finger motif are well conserved, whereas the TFIIIA-like C2H2 zinc finger motif within region 1 is not. Nonetheless, two histidines and one cysteine residue within region 1 are conserved raising the possibility that a function performed by this region is also maintained across divergent species. The consensus motif derived from this comparison (LX4GX6HX3CXHX20-23YPX11-12CX2CX18PX3-4CX2CFX3HX1-4G) is distinct from any other family of zinc finger motifs (29Klug A. Schwabe J.W. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar), suggesting that this domain represents a novel zinc finger fold, and is hereafter referred to as the “SNAP finger” domain. To examine the function of the cysteine and histidine residues within the COOH-terminal SNAP finger domain of SNAP50, each of these residues was changed to alanine for functional testing in the context of a partial SNAPC that contains SNAP190-(1-505), SNAP43, SNAP19, and the various derivatives of full-length HA-SNAP50. In addition, an arginine at position 385 was also substituted with alanine. First, to determine whether the targeted amino acids are critical for complex assembly, a two-step affinity purification of wild-type and mutant complexes were performed. Complexes were assembled by co-expressing four SNAPC subunits in E. coli followed by affinity purification of the complex via the GST tag contained on the amino terminus of SNAP190-(1-505). Complexes were liberated from the glutathione-agarose beads by thrombin digestion, which recognizes its cognate site between the GST tag and the SNAP190 coding region. The soluble complexes were further purified by anti-SNAP43 immunoprecipitation, and the extent of SNAP50 association, as a measure of complex integrity, was determined by Western blot analysis against the HA tag contained at the NH2 terminus of SNAP50. In this approach, any SNAP50 detected in this analysis had to be in a complex with both SNAP43 and SNAP190-(1-505). As shown in Fig. 2B, the amounts of SNAP50 recovered after the two-step affinity purification were similar for the wild-type and mutant complexes, suggesting that SNAP50 assembly into SNAPC is not markedly dependent upon any individual cysteine or histidine in this domain. Next, partially purified wild-type and mutant complexes were then tested for PSE binding function in EMSA to determine whether the cysteine and histidine residues within the SNAP finger domain are important for DNA binding by SNAPC. The results revealed three categories of DNA binding effects, as shown in Fig. 2C. The first category of mutants exhibited either wild-type DNA binding (H330A, H347A, C377A, R385) or modest defects (C302A, C312A, H331A, C334A) as compared with the complex containing wild-type SNAP50. The second category of mutant complexes exhibited severe defects in DNA binding (H313A, C317A, H319A, H388A), whereas complexes in the third category were completely impaired for DNA binding ability (C354A, C357A, C380A, C383A). Thus, the cysteine and histidine residues within the latter two categories are both evolutionarily conserved and critical for DNA binding by SNAPC. The SNAP50 Zinc Finger Domain Is Required for RNA Polymerase II and III Transcription—We next tested whether mutations that affected PSE recognition by SNAPC were also critical for human U1 snRNA gene transcription by RNA polymerase II and U6 snRNA gene transcription by RNA polymerase III. For these experiments, we predicted that those complexes that exhibited no DNA binding ability would also be defective in transcription, confirming that DNA binding by SNAPC is an essential aspect of snRNA gene transcription. Second, any previously unappreciated function for SNAP50 in communication with other components of the general transcription machinery would be revealed as a defect in transcription for th"
