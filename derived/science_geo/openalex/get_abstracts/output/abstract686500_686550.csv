Rurik et al . designed an immunotherapy strategy to generate transient chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells that can recognize the fibrotic cells in the heart (see the Perspective by Gao and Chen). By injecting CD5-targeted lipid nanoparticles containing the messenger RNA (mRNA) instructions needed to reprogram T lymphocytes, the researchers were able to generate therapeutic CAR T cells entirely inside the body. Analysis of a mouse model of heart disease revealed that the approach was successful in reducing fibrosis and restoring cardiac function. The ability to produce CAR T cells in vivo using modified mRNA may have a number of therapeutic applications. —PNK"

However, in the absence of external guidance, developmental processes are stochastic, resulting in variable end products that differ significantly from the native organ. Gjorevski et al . developed approaches for specifying the initial organoid geometry to build intestinal organoids of defined shape, size, and cell distributions, forming structures that are predictable, more similar to normal organs, and reproducible (see the Perspective by Huycke and Gartner). These methods identify symmetry-breaking mechanisms in intestinal morphogenesis and have potential for standardizing organoid-based therapies and facilitating the refinement of mechanistic studies. —BAP"
https://openalex.org/W4207024914,"Ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) are one of the most abundant groups of microbes in the world’s oceans and are key players in the nitrogen cycle. Their energy metabolism—the oxidation of ammonia to nitrite—requires oxygen. Nevertheless, AOA are abundant in environments where oxygen is undetectable. By carrying out incubations for which oxygen concentrations were resolved to the nanomolar range, we show that after oxygen depletion, Nitrosopumilus maritimus produces dinitrogen and oxygen, which is used for ammonia oxidation. The pathway is not completely resolved but likely has nitric oxide and nitrous oxide as key intermediates. N. maritimus joins a handful of organisms known to produce oxygen in the dark. On the basis of this ability, we reevaluate the role of N. maritimus in oxygen-depleted marine environments."
https://openalex.org/W4226056532,"Defects in interneuron migration can disrupt the assembly of cortical circuits and lead to neuropsychiatric disease. Using forebrain assembloids derived by integration of cortical and ventral forebrain organoids, we have previously discovered a cortical interneuron migration defect in Timothy syndrome (TS), a severe neurodevelopmental disease caused by a mutation in the L-type calcium channel (LTCC) Cav1.2. Here, we find that acute pharmacological modulation of Cav1.2 can regulate the saltation length, but not the frequency, of interneuron migration in TS. Interestingly, the defect in saltation length is related to aberrant actomyosin and myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation, while the defect in saltation frequency is driven by enhanced γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) sensitivity and can be restored by GABA-A receptor antagonism. Finally, we describe hypersynchronous hCS network activity in TS that is exacerbated by interneuron migration. Taken together, these studies reveal a complex role of LTCC function in human cortical interneuron migration and strategies to restore deficits in the context of disease."
https://openalex.org/W4220679383,"Cell type diversity in the neocortex The ability to link molecularly identified neurons with their function during behavior requires monitoring the activity of these cell types in vivo. Condylis et al . developed a platform for population functional imaging with spatial transcriptomics. Using newly acquired transcriptomic cell census data from the Allen Institute for Brain Science, the authors studied the function of cell types in primary somatosensory cortex in mice performing a tactile working memory task. Task-related properties of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons continued to differentiate as they were segregated into increasingly discrete molecular types. A new excitatory cell type, Baz1a, formed a sensory-driven circuit hub that orchestrates local sensory processing in superficial layers of the neocortex. This approach opens new venues for exploring information processing in the brain. —PRS"
https://openalex.org/W4220706288,"Hippocampal place cells underlie spatial navigation and memory. Remarkably, CA1 pyramidal neurons can form new place fields within a single trial by undergoing rapid plasticity. However, local feedback circuits likely restrict the rapid recruitment of individual neurons into ensemble representations. This interaction between circuit dynamics and rapid feature coding remains unexplored. Here, we developed ""all-optical"" approaches combining novel optogenetic induction of rapidly forming place fields with 2-photon activity imaging during spatial navigation in mice. We find that induction efficacy depends strongly on the density of co-activated neurons. Place fields can be reliably induced in single cells, but induction fails during co-activation of larger subpopulations due to local circuit constraints imposed by recurrent inhibition. Temporary relief of local inhibition permits the simultaneous induction of place fields in larger ensembles. We demonstrate the behavioral implications of these dynamics, showing that our ensemble place field induction protocol can enhance subsequent spatial association learning."
https://openalex.org/W4205852623,"The COVID Pandemic may affect fertility behaviour and intentions in many ways. Restrictions on service provision reduce access to family planning services and increase fertility in the short term. By contrast, the economic uncertainty brought about by the pandemic and its impact on mental health and well-being may reduce fertility. These various pathways have been explored in the context of high income countries such as the United States and Western Europe, but little is known about middle income countries. In this paper we asses the impact of the COVID pandemic on fertility intentions and behaviour in the Republic of Moldova, a middle income country in Eastern Europe, using the Generations and Gender Survey. This survey was conducted partially before and partially after the onset of the pandemic in 2020, allowing for detailed comparisons of individual circumstances. The results indicate that the pandemic reduced the used of intrauterine devices, and increased the use of male condoms, but with no overall decrease in contraceptive use. Conversely individuals interviewed after the onset of the pandemic were 34.5% less likely to be trying to conceive, although medium term fertility intentions were unchanged. Indicators therefore suggest that in the medium term fertility intentions may not be affected by the pandemic but restricted access to contraception requiring medical consultation and a decrease in short-term fertility intentions could disrupt short term family planning."

The current study compared the prevalence of vaccination reluctance in general and COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and social and health factors associated with intentions to receive the vaccine. A random socio-epidemiological population-based survey was conducted in France in November 2020, in which 85,855 adults participants were included in this study. We used logistic regressions to study being ""not at all in favor"" to vaccination in general, and being ""certainly not"" willing to get vaccinated against Covid-19. Our analysis highlighted a gendered reluctance toward vaccination in general but even more so regarding vaccination against COVID-19 (OR = 1.88 (95% CI: 1.79-1.97)). We also found that people at the bottom of the social hierarchy, in terms of level of education, financial resources, were more likely to refuse the COVID-19 vaccine (from OR = 1.22 (95% CI:1.10-1.35) for respondents without diploma to OR = 0.52 (95% CI:0.47-0.57) for High school +5 or more years level). People from the French overseas departments, immigrants and descendants of immigrants, were all more reluctant to the Covid-19 vaccine (first-generation Africa/Asia immigrants OR = 1.16 (95% CI:1.04-1.30)) versus OR = 2.19 (95% CI:1.96-2.43) for the majority population). Finally, our analysis showed that those who reported not trusting the government were more likely to be Covid-19 vaccine-reluctant (OR = 3.29 (95% CI: 3.13-3.45)). Specific campaigns should be thought beforehand to reach women and people at the bottom of the social hierarchy to avoid furthering social inequalities in terms of morbidity and mortality."
https://openalex.org/W4206901875,"Climate change is expected to result in smaller fish size, but the influence of fishing has made it difficult to substantiate the theorized link between size and ocean warming and deoxygenation. We reconstructed the fish community and oceanographic conditions of the most recent global warm period (last interglacial; 130 to 116 thousand years before present) by using sediments from the northern Humboldt Current system off the coast of Peru, a hotspot of small pelagic fish productivity. In contrast to the present-day anchovy-dominated state, the last interglacial was characterized by considerably smaller (mesopelagic and goby-like) fishes and very low anchovy abundance. These small fish species are more difficult to harvest and are less palatable than anchovies, indicating that our rapidly warming world poses a threat to the global fish supply."
https://openalex.org/W4205471466,"We report the synthesis and structure of single-walled aluminosilicate nanotubes with microporous zeolitic walls. This quasi-one-dimensional zeolite is assembled by a bolaform structure-directing agent (SDA) containing a central biphenyl group connected by C10 alkyl chains to quinuclidinium end groups. High-resolution electron microscopy and diffraction, along with other supporting methods, revealed a unique wall structure that is a hybrid of characteristic building layers from two zeolite structure types, beta and MFI. This hybrid structure arises from minimization of strain energy during the formation of a curved nanotube wall. Nanotube formation involves the early appearance of a mesostructure due to self-assembly of the SDA molecules. The biphenyl core groups of the SDA molecules show evidence of π stacking, whereas the peripheral quinuclidinium groups direct the microporous wall structure."
https://openalex.org/W4205370111,"Dilation of the fluid-filled cerebral ventricles (ventriculomegaly) characterizes hydrocephalus and is frequently seen in autism and schizophrenia. Recent work suggests that the genomic study of congenital hydrocephalus may be unexpectedly fertile ground for revealing insights into neural stem cell regulation, human cerebrocortical development, and pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disease. Dilation of the fluid-filled cerebral ventricles (ventriculomegaly) characterizes hydrocephalus and is frequently seen in autism and schizophrenia. Recent work suggests that the genomic study of congenital hydrocephalus may be unexpectedly fertile ground for revealing insights into neural stem cell regulation, human cerebrocortical development, and pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disease. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled ventricles of the brain, first described by Aristotle in 350 BCE, are perhaps the largest human anatomical structure for which the function is so poorly understood. This is surprising because neurons of the cerebral cortex are not generated locally in the gray matter but are derived from proliferative neural stem cells (NSCs) that line the embryonic brain ventricles. In fact, crucial steps of cortical neurogenesis begin at the brain-CSF interface where NSCs undergo neurogenic divisions at the ventricle wall to generate progenies that radially migrate toward the cortical plate (Silbereis et al., 2016Silbereis J.C. Pochareddy S. Zhu Y. Li M. Sestan N. The Cellular and Molecular Landscapes of the Developing Human Central Nervous System.Neuron. 2016; 89: 248-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). The elaboration of the cortex from ventricular wall NSCs is one important example of the developmental and functional relationships that exist between brain parenchyma and the intracranial CSF compartments. It is becoming increasingly clear that a deeper understanding of the CSF-ventricular system is necessary to illuminate gaps in knowledge about human brain development. Cerebral ventricular dysmorphology is associated with morbid neurological and neurodevelopmental pathologies. Dilation of the cerebral ventricles (ventriculomegaly) characterizes hydrocephalus (Gr., “water on the brain”), one of the oldest known neurological disorders in humans, with archeological records suggesting its recognition already in ancient Egypt. Hydrocephalus can present at any age, although it most commonly appears in early childhood or late adulthood. In newborns and infants, hydrocephalus can arise from secondary causes such as hemorrhage or infection (acquired hydrocephalus) or can be classified as primary or congenital hydrocephalus (CH) in the absence of a known antecedent. CH is a common and morbid brain malformation often associated with poor neurodevelopmental outcomes (see Figure 1A for representative neuroimaging of a pediatric patient with CH). Ventricular expansion in hydrocephalus has been largely attributed to CSF overaccumulation stemming from an imbalance of fluid production versus reabsorption or anatomical abnormalities that obstruct CSF flow. In this model, CSF accumulation distends the ventricles and raises intracranial pressure, which compresses overlying brain tissue, presumably leading to brain damage responsible for poor neurodevelopmental outcomes and, if untreated, lethal brain herniation. Consequently, reduction of CSF volume by neurosurgical CSF diversion (shunting and endoscopy) has largely been the standard approach to treat hydrocephalus for the past decades. While this paradigm makes sense for some types of hydrocephalus, and CSF shunts can be lifesaving for many patients, other types of hydrocephalus, including non-obstructive (“communicating”) CH, seem different. Here, intracranial pressure can be paradoxically normal or even low (Pang and Altschuler, 1994Pang D. Altschuler E. Low-pressure hydrocephalic state and viscoelastic alterations in the brain.Neurosurgery. 1994; 35 (discussion 655–656): 643-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and even after technically successful CSF diversion, ventriculomegaly may persist and neurodevelopmental outcomes can remain poor (Riva-Cambrin et al., 2021Riva-Cambrin J. Kulkarni A.V. Burr R. Rozzelle C.J. Oakes W.J. Drake J.M. Alvey J.S. Reeder R.W. Holubkov R. Browd S.R. et al.Impact of ventricle size on neuropsychological outcomes in treated pediatric hydrocephalus: an HCRN prospective cohort study.J. Neurosurg. Pediatr. 2021; (Published online November 12, 2021)https://doi.org/10.3171/2021.8.PEDS21146Crossref Google Scholar). These observations highlight our inadequate taxonomy and incomplete patho-etiological knowledge of this disorder. Moreover, they suggest that current treatments directed at restoring CSF homeostasis while addressing some consequences of the disease do not address the underlying disease mechanism. Indeed, CH often presents with a constellation of other structural brain defects not explicable by altered fluid circulation, including open lip schizencephaly, colpocephaly, and polymicrogyria (Jin et al., 2020Jin S.C. Dong W. Kundishora A.J. Panchagnula S. Moreno-De-Luca A. Furey C.G. Allocco A.A. Walker R.L. Nelson-Williams C. Smith H. et al.Exome sequencing implicates genetic disruption of prenatal neuro-gliogenesis in sporadic congenital hydrocephalus.Nat. Med. 2020; 26: 1754-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Thus, the hydrocephalus phenotype may arise from developmental defects intrinsic to the cerebral parenchyma rather than from a disturbance of CSF homeostasis. Emerging studies are shifting an “impaired brain plumbing” view of some forms of pediatric hydrocephalus to a new paradigm of dysregulated NSC fate. We recently performed whole-exome sequencing of case-parent trios to discover that damaging de novo gene mutations account for approximately one-fourth of patients with sporadic CH (Jin et al., 2020Jin S.C. Dong W. Kundishora A.J. Panchagnula S. Moreno-De-Luca A. Furey C.G. Allocco A.A. Walker R.L. Nelson-Williams C. Smith H. et al.Exome sequencing implicates genetic disruption of prenatal neuro-gliogenesis in sporadic congenital hydrocephalus.Nat. Med. 2020; 26: 1754-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Contrary to the classic belief that hydrocephalus arises from abnormal fluid hydrodynamics, all the genes exhibiting genome-wide significant enrichment of de novo mutations in CH cases are known regulators of NSC fate and prenatal neuro-gliogenesis. The most frequently mutated gene in human sporadic CH, TRIM71, is the prototypical example of NSC involvement in CH. A target of the ancient let-7 microRNA heterochronic pathway, TRIM71 encodes an RNA-binding protein that plays a critical role in guiding the developmental timing of NSC progression. Loss of TRIM71 in the mouse causes premature neuronal differentiation at the expense of NSC expansion (Chen et al., 2012Chen J. Lai F. Niswander L. The ubiquitin ligase mLin41 temporally promotes neural progenitor cell maintenance through FGF signaling.Genes Dev. 2012; 26: 803-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This developmental pathology affecting NSC progression in the setting of TRIM71 deficiency is likely applicable to other genetic causes of CH because integrative genomic analyses showed that CH risk genes overall were enriched in human cortical neurogenesis elements, including proliferative neuroprogenitors and migrating excitatory neurons (Jin et al., 2020Jin S.C. Dong W. Kundishora A.J. Panchagnula S. Moreno-De-Luca A. Furey C.G. Allocco A.A. Walker R.L. Nelson-Williams C. Smith H. et al.Exome sequencing implicates genetic disruption of prenatal neuro-gliogenesis in sporadic congenital hydrocephalus.Nat. Med. 2020; 26: 1754-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). CH risk genes also converged in a gene co-expression module of the midgestational cortex implicated in other neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and microcephaly (Jin et al., 2020Jin S.C. Dong W. Kundishora A.J. Panchagnula S. Moreno-De-Luca A. Furey C.G. Allocco A.A. Walker R.L. Nelson-Williams C. Smith H. et al.Exome sequencing implicates genetic disruption of prenatal neuro-gliogenesis in sporadic congenital hydrocephalus.Nat. Med. 2020; 26: 1754-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), which is classically characterized by defective NSC proliferation and neurogenesis. This suggests that genetically encoded dysregulation of NSCs that comprise the germinal neuroepithelium lining the developing brain ventricles, leading to impaired cortical neurogenesis, is a primary mechanism driving pathogenesis of a significant percentage of CH. Emerging human genetic studies and work in model systems suggest that a “NSC model” of hydrocephalus better explains the data than does the classical “plumbing model” in many pediatric patients, especially those with communicating CH subtypes and potentially even the more common hemorrhagic forms in preemies wherein germinal matrix hemorrhage abutting CSF may impact ventricular wall NSCs. In the NSC model, dysregulated fate of NSCs at the ventricular neuroepithelium results in abnormal prenatal neuro-gliogenesis, with impaired morphological development of the cerebral cortex associated with ventriculomegaly. This model shifts focus from the CSF per se to the dysgenic brain parenchyma as the patho-etiological “scene of the crime.” Perturbed NSC development affects multiple developmental processes that conspire to cause ventricular dilation and neurologic dysfunction. Because multiciliated ependymal cells lining the postnatal ventricle wall are direct descendants of NSCs, loss of NSCs could disrupt ependymogenesis with attendant loss of cilia-generated CSF flow contributing to ventriculomegaly (Rodríguez and Guerra, 2017Rodríguez E.M. Guerra M.M. Neural Stem Cells and Fetal-Onset Hydrocephalus.Pediatr. Neurosurg. 2017; 52: 446-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, another often overlooked parameter in intracranial physiology that also influences ventricular size and intracranial pressure is the cerebral parenchyma compartment itself. Indeed, the production and circulation of CSF in the ventricles generate a constant positive pressure that must be counteracted by the surrounding brain tissue/parenchyma to maintain constant ventricular size (Peña et al., 2002Peña A. Harris N.G. Bolton M.D. Czosnyka M. Pickard J.D. Communicating hydrocephalus: the biomechanics of progressive ventricular enlargement revisited.Acta Neurochir. Suppl. (Wien). 2002; 81: 59-63PubMed Google Scholar). The absence or reduction of such counteracting forces by neural tissue facilitates passive CSF pooling with secondary ventricular expansion, even in the absence of obstructed CSF flow as predicted by computational models (Peña et al., 2002Peña A. Harris N.G. Bolton M.D. Czosnyka M. Pickard J.D. Communicating hydrocephalus: the biomechanics of progressive ventricular enlargement revisited.Acta Neurochir. Suppl. (Wien). 2002; 81: 59-63PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the impact of brain tissue biomechanics on maintaining ventricular size directly links abnormal neurogenesis to the development of hydrocephalus. Innate hypoplasia of the cortical mantle due to reduced neuroprogenitor proliferation and neurogenesis results in a “floppy” cerebral cortex that engenders ventriculomegaly even when intracranial pressure is not increased. Impaired cortical neurogenesis not only accounts for of low- or normal-pressure ventriculomegaly (Pang and Altschuler, 1994Pang D. Altschuler E. Low-pressure hydrocephalic state and viscoelastic alterations in the brain.Neurosurgery. 1994; 35 (discussion 655–656): 643-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) but also may explain neurologic dysfunction that can fail to improve even after technically successful CSF diversion surgery in children with hydrocephalus (Riva-Cambrin et al., 2021Riva-Cambrin J. Kulkarni A.V. Burr R. Rozzelle C.J. Oakes W.J. Drake J.M. Alvey J.S. Reeder R.W. Holubkov R. Browd S.R. et al.Impact of ventricle size on neuropsychological outcomes in treated pediatric hydrocephalus: an HCRN prospective cohort study.J. Neurosurg. Pediatr. 2021; (Published online November 12, 2021)https://doi.org/10.3171/2021.8.PEDS21146Crossref Google Scholar). Overall, the “NSC” model of hydrocephalus provides explanatory power for ventricular and cortical malformations as well as the associated clinical endophenotypes. The recognition of some cases of hydrocephalus as a disorder of ventricular wall NSCs rather than of primary fluid overaccumulation not only has implications for treatment of patients with hydrocephalus but also suggests that the mechanisms underlying the hydrocephalus phenotype may be more generally applicable than previously appreciated. Ventricular dilation is found not only in clinical hydrocephalus but also is a common (if often overlooked) structural finding in multiple developmental neuropsychiatric disorders, including autism, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder (DeSpenza et al., 2021DeSpenza Jr., T. Carlson M. Panchagnula S. Robert S. Duy P.Q. Mermin-Bunnell N. Reeves B.C. Kundishora A. Elsamadicy A.A.

Spaniel F. Brain ventricular volume changes in schizophrenia. A narrative review.Neurosci. Lett. 2021; 759: 136065Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar) (see Figure 1A for example of massive ventriculomegaly observed in a human patient with schizoaffective disorder). In fact, of all structural changes in the brain documented by decades of neuroimaging studies, ventriculomegaly remains the single most robust, consistent, and reproducible morphometric finding in the clinically heterogeneous disease of schizophrenia (Svancer and Spaniel, 2021Svancer P. Spaniel F. Brain ventricular volume changes in schizophrenia. A narrative review.Neurosci. Lett. 2021; 759: 136065Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Ventriculomegaly in neuropsychiatric diseases has been hypothesized to reflect either neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative changes in the cerebral cortex (Svancer and Spaniel, 2021Svancer P. Spaniel F. Brain ventricular volume changes in schizophrenia. A narrative review.Neurosci. Lett. 2021; 759: 136065Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar), suggesting cerebral ventricular dysmorphology as a neuroradiographic vestige of abnormal cerebral cortex development and dysfunction (Figure 1B). Thus, despite the typical view of these diseases as predominantly functional brain disorders rather than structural malformations, ventriculomegaly still stands out as a convergent correlate of abnormal cerebral cortex physiology. Understanding the onset and progression of ventricular dysmorphology provides hope of finding an objective radiographic “biomarker” of disease states that might guide diagnosis, prognosis, and tailored behavioral and/or pharmacological interventions. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms that produce enlarged ventricles in the setting of neuropsychiatric dysfunction remain poorly understood. Clarification of the mechanisms leading to ventriculomegaly is, thus, an important step toward elucidation of the developmental etiologies leading to cortical dysfunction in neuropsychiatric disorders and has the potential to shift the paradigm for understanding disorders of poorly understood mechanisms such as autism and schizophrenia. Dysregulation of prenatal NSCs comprising the ventricular neuroepithelium may explain not only ventricular dilation in some types of pediatric hydrocephalus but also structural defects and cortical dysfunction in other developmental disorders that often feature ventriculomegaly. Indeed, integrative analyses have revealed the convergence of hydrocephalus risk genes in human brain transcriptional networks implicated in other cortical developmental disorders such as autism and microcephaly (Jin et al., 2020Jin S.C. Dong W. Kundishora A.J. Panchagnula S. Moreno-De-Luca A. Furey C.G. Allocco A.A. Walker R.L. Nelson-Williams C. Smith H. et al.Exome sequencing implicates genetic disruption of prenatal neuro-gliogenesis in sporadic congenital hydrocephalus.Nat. Med. 2020; 26: 1754-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), suggesting shared biological mechanisms underlying pediatric hydrocephalus and other human neurodevelopmental disorders. Autism has classically been considered a disorder affecting the development and function of post-mitotic neurons or synaptic regulation. However, a recent integrative genomic analysis revealed functional convergence of autism risk genes in not only differentiated neurons but also ventricular zone neuroprogenitors of the developing human neocortex (Willsey et al., 2021Willsey H.R. Exner C.R.T. Xu Y. Everitt A. Sun N. Wang B. Dea J. Schmunk G. Zaltsman Y. Teerikorpi N. et al.Parallel in vivo analysis of large-effect autism genes implicates cortical neurogenesis and estrogen in risk and resilience.Neuron. 2021; 109: 788-804.e8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Functional validation in the Xenopus model showed that individual loss of function in ten high-confidence autism risk genes altered telencephalon size and increased the ratio of neuroprogenitors to neurons despite the apparently divergent molecular functions of the genes (Willsey et al., 2021Willsey H.R. Exner C.R.T. Xu Y. Everitt A. Sun N. Wang B. Dea J. Schmunk G. Zaltsman Y. Teerikorpi N. et al.Parallel in vivo analysis of large-effect autism genes implicates cortical neurogenesis and estrogen in risk and resilience.Neuron. 2021; 109: 788-804.e8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The functional roles of these autism genes in neurogenesis were also confirmed in human-derived in vitro neuroprogenitor models. A recent study similarly investigated the developmental pathologies of human idiopathic schizophrenia by generating and characterizing cerebral cortical organoids derived from induced pluripotent stem cells of schizophrenic patients (Notaras et al., 2021Notaras M. Lodhi A. Dündar F. Collier P. Sayles N.M. Tilgner H. Greening D. Colak D. Schizophrenia is defined by cell-specific neuropathology and multiple neurodevelopmental mechanisms in patient-derived cerebral organoids.Mol. Psychiatry. 2021; (Published online November 12, 2021)https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-021-01316-6Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The authors found early developmental defects at the level of ventricular zone cortical neuroprogenitors in schizophrenia, marked by the premature death of neuroprogenitors and disrupted neuronal differentiation that together reduced neurogenesis. Contrary to the paradigm that autism and schizophrenia are disorders of post-mitotic neurons, these findings suggest that the pathologies leading to disease arise much earlier in brain development than previously expected. Rather, the formation of the cerebral cortex is affected months before birth and the subsequent emergence of debilitating clinical symptoms in childhood and adolescence, given that the bulk of cortical neurogenesis is finished by the end of the second trimester of gestation (Silbereis et al., 2016Silbereis J.C. Pochareddy S. Zhu Y. Li M. Sestan N. The Cellular and Molecular Landscapes of the Developing Human Central Nervous System.Neuron. 2016; 89: 248-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Thus, an effect on NSCs and cortical neurogenesis should be considered as a common developmental pathology in functional cortical developmental disorders classically associated with synaptic dysfunction. Such abnormalities in ventricular wall NSCs may explain both the neurobehavioral manifestations of these disorders and the neuroradiographic finding of ventriculomegaly in autism and schizophrenia (Styner et al., 2005Styner M. Lieberman J.A. McClure R.K. Weinberger D.R. Jones D.W. Gerig G. Morphometric analysis of lateral ventricles in schizophrenia and healthy controls regarding genetic and disease-specific factors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 4872-4877Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar; Svancer and Spaniel, 2021Svancer P. Spaniel F. Brain ventricular volume changes in schizophrenia. A narrative review.Neurosci. Lett. 2021; 759: 136065Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). It is, thus, remarkable that some cortical organoids derived from schizophrenia patients show signs of apparent ventriculomegaly in parallel with reduced neuroprogenitor proliferation (Notaras et al., 2021Notaras M. Lodhi A. Dündar F. Collier P. Sayles N.M. Tilgner H. Greening D. Colak D. Schizophrenia is defined by cell-specific neuropathology and multiple neurodevelopmental mechanisms in patient-derived cerebral organoids.Mol. Psychiatry. 2021; (Published online November 12, 2021)https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-021-01316-6Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar), although this phenotype requires further study. NSC involvement in the development of cerebral ventricles and cerebral cortex suggests that detailed genetic and mechanistic studies of the hydrocephalus phenotype will likely illuminate fundamental mechanisms of prenatal NSC regulation in corticogenesis and may reveal the etiologies of human cortical developmental disorders (Figure 1B). A major advantage of studying the cerebral ventricles is that ventricular morphology can be quantitatively assessed by noninvasive imaging early in pregnancy (Figure 1B), whereas the postnatal diagnoses of developmental neuropsychiatric disorders are often challenging because of vague and subjective behavioral symptoms that lack biomarker correlates. Thus, abnormalities in the ventricles and CSF compartments provide a noninvasive window into cortical function and development even months before birth. Studying the genetic causes of ventriculomegaly and hydrocephalus in humans constitutes a clinically relevant forward genetic screening approach to identify novel genetic regulators of cerebral cortex development, starting from the earliest steps of NSC progression. These insights could then inform gene therapy approaches to correct the underlying genetic abnormalities and/or development of targeted pharmacotherapy to modulate convergent molecular defects shared by the various types of cortical developmental disorders (Figure 1B). Understanding the emergence and function of the brain ventricles and CSF spaces, structures historically neglected by neuroscientists, provides a powerful opportunity to understand the mechanisms that regulate cerebral cortex development while advancing precision medicine approaches for common and morbid human brain disorders.

However, Tex estimates are limited in geographical coverage and often inconsistent for individual hotspots. We infer the temperature of oceanic hotspots and ridges simultaneously by converting seismic velocity to temperature. We show that while ~45% of plume-fed hotspots are hot (Tex ≥ 155°C), ~15% are cold (Tex ≤ 36°C) and ~40% are not hot enough to actively upwell (50°C ≤ Tex ≤ 136°C). Hot hotspots have an extremely high helium-3/helium-4 ratio and buoyancy flux, but cold hotspots do not. The latter may originate at upper mantle depths. Alternatively, the deep plumes that feed them may be entrained and cooled by small-scale convection."

https://openalex.org/W4207030258,"The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has substantially impacted healthcare utilization worldwide. The objective of this retrospective analysis of a large hospital discharge database was to compare all-cause and cause-specific hospitalizations during the first six months of the pandemic in the United States with the same months in the previous four years.Data were collected from all hospitals in the Premier Healthcare Database (PHD) and PHD Special Release reporting hospitalizations from January through July for each year from 2016 through 2020. Hospitalization trends were analyzed stratified by age group, major diagnostic categories (MDCs), and geographic region.The analysis included 286 hospitals from all 9 US Census divisions. The number of all-cause hospitalizations per month was relatively stable from 2016 through 2019 and then fell by 21% (57,281 fewer hospitalizations) between March and April 2020, particularly in hospitalizations for non-respiratory illnesses. From April onward there was a rise in the number of monthly hospitalizations per month. Hospitalizations per month, nationally and in each Census division, decreased for 20 of 25 MDCs between March and April 2020. There was also a decrease in hospitalizations per month for all age groups between March and April 2020 with the greatest decreases in hospitalizations observed for patients 50-64 and ≥65 years of age.Rates of hospitalization declined substantially during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic, suggesting delayed routine, elective, and emergency care in the United States. These lapses in care for illnesses not related to COVID-19 may lead to increases in morbidity and mortality for other conditions. Thus, in the current stage of the pandemic, clinicians and public-health officials should work, not only to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission, but also to ensure that care for non-COVID-19 conditions is not delayed."
https://openalex.org/W4205824746,"Introduction Sepsis is a public health problem due to its high prevalence and mortality. Mean platelet volume (MPV), a biomarker reported in routine blood counts, has been investigated and shows promise for determining fatal outcomes in septic patients. Objective Evaluate whether the mean platelet volume (MPV) and mean platelet volume-to-platelet count (MPV/P) ratio are predictors of clinical severity and mortality in patients with sepsis. Methods A prospective population cohort of 163 patients aged 18–97 years was recruited at the Intensive Care Unit of Pablo Arturo Hospital, Quito, Ecuador from 2017–2019 and followed up for 28 days. Patients were diagnosed with sepsis based on SEPSIS-3 septic shock criteria; in which the MPV and the MPV/P ratio were measured on days 1, 2, and 3. Sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score and presence of septic shock assessed clinical severity. Mortality on day 28 was considered the fatal outcome. Results The average age of the patients was 61,15 years (SD 20,94) and female sex was predominant. MPV cutoff points at days 1, 2 and 3 were &gt;9,45fL, &gt;8,95fL and &gt;8, 85fL; and (MPV/P) ratio &gt;8, 18, &gt;4, 12 y &gt;3, 95, respectively. MPV at days 2 (9,85fL) and 3 (8,55fL) and (MPV/P) ratio at days 1 (4,42), 2 (4,21), and 3 (8,55), were predictors of clinical severity assessed by septic shock, which reached significance in the ROC curves. MPV and (MPV/P) ratio were also predictors of clinical severity determined by SOFA at days 1, 2, and 3, where higher values were observed in non-survivors reaching significance in all categories. MPV and MPV/P ratio at days 1, 2 and 3 were independent predictor factors of mortality using Cox proportional hazards model (HR 2,31; 95% CI 1,36–3,94), (HR 2,11; 95% CI 1,17–3,82), (HR 2,13; 95% CI 1,07–4,21) and (HR 2,38; 95% CI 1,38–4,12), (HR 2,15; 95% CI 1,14–4,06), (HR 4,43; 95% CI, 1,72–11,37) respectively. Conclusions MPV and the MPV/P ratio are predictors of clinical severity and mortality in sepsis. The MPV and its coefficient are indicators of the biological behavior of platelets in sepsis. They should be considered as a cost-effective and rapidly available tool that guides the treatment."
https://openalex.org/W4205543808,"Quality antenatal care is a window of opportunity for improving maternal and neonatal outcomes. Numerous studies have shown a positive effect of women empowerment on improved coverage of maternal and reproductive health services, including antenatal care (ANC). However, there is scarce evidence on the association between women's empowerment and improved ANC services both in terms of coverage and quality. Addressing this gap, this paper examines the relationship between multi-dimensional measures of women empowerment on utilization of quality ANC (service coverage and consultation) in Pakistan.We used Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey 2017-18 (PDHS) data which comprises of 6,602 currently married women aged between 15-49 years who had a live birth in the past five years preceding the survey. Our exposure variables were three-dimensional measures of women empowerment (social independence, decision making, and attitude towards domestic violence), and our outcome variables were quality of antenatal coverage [i.e. a composite binary measure based on skilled ANC (trained professional), timeliness (1st ANC visit during first trimester), sufficiency of ANC visits (4 or more)] and quality of ANC consultation (i.e. receiving at least 7 or more essential antenatal components out of 8). Data were analysed in Stata 16.0 software. Descriptive statistics were used to describe sample characteristics and binary logistic regression was employed to assess the association between empowerment and quality of antenatal care.We found that 41.4% of the women received quality ANC coverage and 30.6% received quality ANC consultations during pregnancy. After controlling for a number of socio-economic and demographic factors, all three measures of women's empowerment independently showed a positive relationship with both outcomes. Women with high autonomy (i.e. strongly opposed the notion of violence) in the domain of attitude to violence are 1.66 (95% CI 1.30-2.10) and 1.45 (95% CI 1.19-1.75) and times more likely to receive antenatal coverage and quality ANC consultations respectively, compared with women who ranked low on attitude to violence. Women who enjoy high social independence had 1.87 (95% CI 1.44-2.43) and 2.78 (95% CI 2.04-3.79) higher odds of quality antenatal coverage and consultations respectively, as compared with their counterparts. Similarly, women who had high autonomy in household decision making 1.98 (95% CI 1.60-2.44) and 1.56 (95% CI 2.17-1.91) were more likely to receive quality antenatal coverage and consultation respectively, as compared to women who possess low autonomy in household decision making.The quality of ANC coverage and consultation with service provider is considerably low in Pakistan. Women's empowerment related to social independence, gendered beliefs about violence, and decision-making have an independent positive association with the utilisation of quality antenatal care. Thus, efforts directed towards empowering women could be an effective strategy to improve utilisation of quality antenatal care in Pakistan."
https://openalex.org/W4206491499,"Mortality prediction for intensive care unit (ICU) patients is crucial for improving outcomes and efficient utilization of resources. Accessibility of electronic health records (EHR) has enabled data-driven predictive modeling using machine learning. However, very few studies rely solely on unstructured clinical notes from the EHR for mortality prediction. In this work, we propose a framework to predict short, mid, and long-term mortality in adult ICU patients using unstructured clinical notes from the MIMIC III database, natural language processing (NLP), and machine learning (ML) models. Depending on the statistical description of the patients' length of stay, we define the short-term as 48-hour and 4-day period, the mid-term as 7-day and 10-day period, and the long-term as 15-day and 30-day period after admission. We found that by only using clinical notes within the 24 hours of admission, our framework can achieve a high area under the receiver operating characteristics (AU-ROC) score for short, mid and long-term mortality prediction tasks. The test AU-ROC scores are 0.87, 0.83, 0.83, 0.82, 0.82, and 0.82 for 48-hour, 4-day, 7-day, 10-day, 15-day, and 30-day period mortality prediction, respectively. We also provide a comparative study among three types of feature extraction techniques from NLP: frequency-based technique, fixed embedding-based technique, and dynamic embedding-based technique. Lastly, we provide an interpretation of the NLP-based predictive models using feature-importance scores."
https://openalex.org/W4206964309,"Phylogeny estimation (the reconstruction of evolutionary trees) has recently been applied to CRISPR-based cell lineage tracing, allowing the developmental history of an individual tissue or organism to be inferred from a large number of mutated sequences in somatic cells. However, current computational methods are not able to construct phylogenetic trees from extremely large numbers of input sequences. Here, we present a deep distributed computing framework to comprehensively trace accurate large lineages (FRACTAL) that substantially enhances the scalability of current lineage estimation software tools. FRACTAL first reconstructs only an upstream lineage of the input sequences and recursively iterates the same produce for its downstream lineages using independent computing nodes. We demonstrate the utility of FRACTAL by reconstructing lineages from >235 million simulated sequences and from >16 million cells from a simulated experiment with a CRISPR system that accumulates mutations during cell proliferation. We also successfully applied FRACTAL to evolutionary tree reconstructions and to an experiment using error-prone PCR (EP-PCR) for large-scale sequence diversification."

However, the underlying neuronal mechanisms that encode and maintain such specific motivational control of behavior are poorly understood. Here, we used Ca2+ imaging and optogenetic manipulations in the basolateral amygdala of freely moving mice performing noncued, self-paced instrumental goal-directed actions to receive and consume rewards. We found that distinct neuronal activity patterns sequentially represent the entire action-consumption behavioral sequence. Whereas action-associated patterns integrated the identity, value, and expectancy of pursued goals, consumption-associated patterns reflected the identity and value of experienced outcomes. Thus, the interplay between these patterns allows the maintenance of specific motivational states necessary to adaptively direct behavior toward prospective rewards."

This study investigated the total concentration, health risk, integrated pollution load index (IPI), and enrichment factor (EF) of various heavy metals in urban dust at different locations in Riyadh City. Surface dust samples were collected from 50 different residential yards in the north, south, west, east, and central corners of the city and analyzed for cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), manganese (Mn), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb), and zinc (Zn). With respect to concentrations heavy metals were in the following order Zn > Cu > Mn > Cr > Ni > Pb > Cd. The EF trends exposed repeated anthropogenic activities were responsible for Mn, Cr, and Ni, while Pb, Zn, and Cu appeared to come from Earth's crust. Since the heavy metal concentrations were lower than the threshold values, children and adults are exposed to lower health risk in investigated area. Also, there are no pollution of heavy metals in the dust with respect to IPI which is less than the critical limit (<1) with the exception of a sampling location in north side of the city with higher IPI showed unhealthy respiration conditions in particular areas. It was concluded that rapid industrialization and urbanization and their concentrations in dust may cause health problems in near future in north side as well as other sides of Riyadh City."

Significant correlations of miR-34a-5p and miR-199a-3p with each of TLC, RDW, RBS, and C-reactive protein (CRP) as well as SNAPII were observed, indicating their associations with the severity of neonatal sepsis.miR-34a-5p and miR-199a-3p may be useful as novel biomarkers in neonatal sepsis and may provide a new direction for its treatment."
https://openalex.org/W4205582874,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic human pathogen and a leading cause of chronic infection in the lungs of individuals with cystic fibrosis. After colonization, P. aeruginosa often undergoes a phenotypic conversion to mucoidy, characterized by overproduction of the alginate exopolysaccharide. This conversion is correlated with poorer patient prognoses. The majority of genes required for alginate synthesis, including the alginate lyase, algL, are located in a single operon. Previous investigations of AlgL have resulted in several divergent hypotheses regarding the protein's role in alginate production. To address these discrepancies, we determined the structure of AlgL and, using multiple sequence alignments, identified key active site residues involved in alginate binding and catalysis. In vitro enzymatic analysis of active site mutants highlights R249 and Y256 as key residues required for alginate lyase activity. In a genetically engineered P. aeruginosa strain where alginate biosynthesis is under arabinose control, we found that AlgL is required for cell viability and maintaining membrane integrity during alginate production. We demonstrate that AlgL functions as a homeostasis enzyme to clear the periplasmic space of accumulated polymer. Constitutive expression of the AlgU/T sigma factor mitigates the effects of an algL deletion during alginate production, suggesting that an AlgU/T-regulated protein or proteins can compensate for an algL deletion. Together, our study demonstrates the role of AlgL in alginate biosynthesis, explains the discrepancies observed previously across other P. aeruginosa ΔalgL genetic backgrounds, and clarifies the existing divergent data regarding the function of AlgL as an alginate degrading enzyme."

A new research direction is gaining increasing attention that involves the use of hybrid approaches based on natural language processing and computer vision techniques to create auto medical report generation systems. The auto report generator, producing radiology reports, will significantly reduce the burden on doctors and assist them in writing manual reports. Because the sensitivity of chest X-ray (CXR) findings provided by existing techniques not adequately accurate, producing comprehensive explanations for medical photographs remains a difficult task. A novel approach to address this issue was proposed, based on the continuous integration of convolutional neural networks and long short-term memory for detecting diseases, followed by the attention mechanism for sequence generation based on these diseases. Experimental results obtained by using the Indiana University CXR and MIMIC-CXR datasets showed that the proposed model attained the current state-of-the-art efficiency as opposed to other solutions of the baseline. BLEU-1, BLEU-2, BLEU-3, and BLEU-4 were used as the evaluation metrics."
https://openalex.org/W4226060506,"Giant kelp populations that support productive and diverse coastal ecosystems at temperate and subpolar latitudes of both hemispheres are vulnerable to changing climate conditions as well as direct human impacts. Observations of giant kelp forests are spatially and temporally uneven, with disproportionate coverage in the northern hemisphere, despite the size and comparable density of southern hemisphere kelp forests. Satellite imagery enables the mapping of existing and historical giant kelp populations in understudied regions, but automating the detection of giant kelp using satellite imagery requires approaches that are robust to the optical complexity of the shallow, nearshore environment. We present and compare two approaches for automating the detection of giant kelp in satellite datasets: one based on crowd sourcing of satellite imagery classifications and another based on a decision tree paired with a spectral unmixing algorithm (automated using Google Earth Engine). Both approaches are applied to satellite imagery (Landsat) of the Falkland Islands or Islas Malvinas (FLK), an archipelago in the southern Atlantic Ocean that supports expansive giant kelp ecosystems. The performance of each method is evaluated by comparing the automated classifications with a subset of expert-annotated imagery (8 images spanning the majority of our continuous timeseries, cumulatively covering over 2,700 km of coastline, and including all relevant sensors). Using the remote sensing approaches evaluated herein, we present the first continuous timeseries of giant kelp observations in the FLK region using Landsat imagery spanning over three decades. We do not detect evidence of long-term change in the FLK region, although we observe a recent decline in total canopy area from 2017–2021. Using a nitrate model based on nearby ocean state measurements obtained from ships and incorporating satellite sea surface temperature products, we find that the area of giant kelp forests in the FLK region is positively correlated with the nitrate content observed during the prior year. Our results indicate that giant kelp classifications using citizen science are approximately consistent with classifications based on a state-of-the-art automated spectral approach. Despite differences in accuracy and sensitivity, both approaches find high interannual variability that impedes the detection of potential long-term changes in giant kelp canopy area, although recent canopy area declines are notable and should continue to be monitored carefully."

Telemedicine solutions for homeless persons might compensate for shortcomings in access to valuable health services in different settings. The main aim of our research was to examine the attitudes and openness of homeless persons regarding telecare on a Hungarian sample.Quantitative survey among homeless people (n = 98) was completed in 4 shelters providing mid- and long-term accommodation in Budapest, Hungary. Attitudes regarding healthcare service accessibility and telecare were measured by a self-developed questionnaire of the research team. Telecare attitude comparison was made with data of a Hungarian weighted reference group of non-homeless persons recruited from 2 primary care units (n = 110).A significant fraction of homeless people with mid- or long-term residency in homeless shelters did not oppose the use of telecare via live online video consultation and there was no difference compared to the national reference group (averages of 3.09 vs. 3.15, respectively). Results of the homeless group indicate that those more satisfied with healthcare services, in general, manifest more openness to telecare. It is clearly demonstrated by the multivariate analysis that those participants in the homeless group who had problems getting health care in the last year definitely preferred in-person doctor-patient consultations.Digital health technologies offer a potentially important new pathway for the prevention and treatment of chronic conditions among homeless persons. Based on the attitudes towards telecare, initiating an on-site telecare program for mid- and long-term residents of homeless shelters might enable better care continuity. Our results draw attention to the key factors including building trust in the implementation of such programs among underserved and other vulnerable patient groups."
https://openalex.org/W4205799141,"In Canadian boreal forests, bryophytes represent an essential component of biodiversity and play a significant role in ecosystem functioning. Despite their ecological importance and sensitivity to disturbances, bryophytes are overlooked in conservation strategies due to knowledge gaps on their distribution, which is known as the Wallacean shortfall. Rare species deserve priority attention in conservation as they are at a high risk of extinction. This study aims to elaborate predictive models of rare bryophyte species in Canadian boreal forests using remote sensing-derived predictors in an Ensemble of Small Models (ESMs) framework. We hypothesize that high ESMs-based prediction accuracy can be achieved for rare bryophyte species despite their low number of occurrences. We also assess if there is a spatial correspondence between rare and overall bryophyte richness patterns. The study area is located in western Quebec and covers 72,292 km2. We selected 52 bryophyte species with <30 occurrences from a presence-only database (214 species, 389 plots in total). ESMs were built from Random Forest and Maxent techniques using remote sensing-derived predictors related to topography and vegetation. Lee's L statistic was used to assess and map the spatial relationship between rare and overall bryophyte richness patterns. ESMs yielded poor to excellent prediction accuracy (AUC > 0.5) for 73% of the modeled species, with AUC values > 0.8 for 19 species, which confirmed our hypothesis. In fact, ESMs provided better predictions for the rarest bryophytes. Likewise, our study revealed a spatial concordance between rare and overall bryophyte richness patterns in different regions of the study area, which have important implications for conservation planning. This study demonstrates the potential of remote sensing for assessing and making predictions on inconspicuous and rare species across the landscape and lays the basis for the eventual inclusion of bryophytes into sustainable development planning."

We aimed to determine whether a fasting serum signature of recent, self-reported depressive symptoms could be identified in a heterogeneous NAFLD cohort using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics integrated with clinical chemistry. Serum nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolite profiles and corresponding clinical chemistry were compared between patients with depressive symptoms in the last 12-months (n = 81) and patients without recent depressive symptoms (n = 137 controls) using multivariate statistics. Orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) of the biochemical and metabolomic data identified NAFLD patients with recent depression with a cross-validated accuracy of 61.5%, independent of age, sex, medication, and other comorbidities. This led to the development of a diagnostic algorithm with AUC 0.83 for future testing in larger clinical cohorts. Serum triglycerides, VLDL cholesterol, and the inflammatory biomarker GlycA were key metabolites increased in patients with recent depressive symptoms, while serum glutamine level was reduced. Here, serum NMR metabolite analysis provides a link between disturbed lipid metabolism, inflammation, and active mental health issues in NAFLD, irrespective of disease severity."

The discovery of specific inhibitors or activators has been hindered by challenges with reliably measuring autophagy levels in a clinical setting. We investigated drug-induced autophagy in breast cancer cell lines with differing ER/PR/Her2 receptor status by exposing them to known but divergent autophagy inducers each with a unique molecular target, tamoxifen, trastuzumab, bortezomib or rapamycin. Differential gene expression analysis from total RNA extracted during the earliest sign of autophagy flux showed both cell- and drug-specific changes. We analyzed the list of differentially expressed genes to find a common, cell- and drug-agnostic autophagy signature. Twelve mRNAs were significantly modulated by all the drugs and 11 were orthogonally verified with Q-RT-PCR ( Klhl24 , Hbp1 , Crebrf , Ypel2 , Fbxo32 , Gdf15 , Cdc25a , Ddit4 , Psat1 , Cd22 , Ypel3 ). The drug agnostic mRNA signature was similarly induced by a mitochondrially targeted agent, MitoQ. In-silico analysis on the KM-plotter cancer database showed that the levels of these mRNAs are detectable in human samples and associated with breast cancer prognosis outcomes of Relapse-Free Survival in all patients (RSF), Overall Survival in all patients (OS), and Relapse-Free Survival in ER + Patients (RSF ER + ). High levels of Klhl24 , Hbp1 , Crebrf , Ypel2 , CD22 and Ypel3 were correlated with better outcomes, whereas lower levels of Gdf15 , Cdc25a , Ddit4 and Psat1 were associated with better prognosis in breast cancer patients. This gene signature uncovers candidate autophagy biomarkers that could be tested during preclinical and clinical studies to monitor the autophagy process."

The mutual information extension method was then used to extend both ends of the original signal to improve the VMD end effect. Finally, VMD and OS-QR-ELM were combined to construct a drought prediction method based on the VMD-OS-QR-ELM. The reliability and accuracy of the VMD-OS-QR-ELM model were improved by 86.19% and 93.20%, respectively, compared with those of the support vector regression model combined with empirical mode decomposition.

To facilitate the discovery and characterization of such inhibitors, we created a screening platform to identify conformation-locking antibodies for molecular probes (CLAMPs) that distinguish and induce rare protein conformational states. Applying the approach to KRAS, we discovered CLAMPs that recognize the open conformation of KRASG12C stabilized by covalent inhibitors. One CLAMP enables the visualization of KRASG12C covalent modification in vivo and can be used to investigate response heterogeneity to KRASG12C inhibitors in patient tumors. A second CLAMP enhances the affinity of weak ligands binding to the KRASG12C switch II region (SWII) by stabilizing a specific conformation of KRASG12C, thereby enabling the discovery of such ligands that could serve as leads for the development of drugs in a high-throughput screen. We show that combining the complementary properties of antibodies and small molecules facilitates the study and drugging of dynamic proteins."

https://openalex.org/W4206031159,"Prefabricated construction has attracted worldwide concern and promotion due to its environmental friendliness, high quality, and high efficiency. In China, the application of prefabricated construction still lags due to its high cost. To improve prefabricated construction development, the Chinese government and provinces have launched subsidy policies for different objects that offer subsidies to the assembler, the manufacturer, or consumers. Subsidy policies for different subsidy objects have different impacts on the manufacturer wholesale price and assembler retail price and assembly rate and make their decisions more complicated. Therefore, this study uses game theory and builds three models to analyze the effects of government subsidies on manufacturer pricing, assembler pricing, assembly rate decisions, and profit. We find that government subsidy policies can bring more profit to prefabricated construction enterprises, reduce their costs, and benefit the promotion of prefabricated construction. Through comparison and numerical analysis, we also find that when the government subsidizes enterprises more, it is better to subsidize the assembler, because it is good for all three parties. First, consumers can obtain a lower retail price. Second, enterprises can obtain more profits. Finally, for the government, this approach can increase the demand for prefabricated construction and increase the assembly rate, which is conducive to the promotion of prefabricated construction. When the government subsidizes customers more, it is better for the assembler and the manufacturer to subsidize customers, because they can obtain more profits. It is better for the government and customers to subsidize the assembler or the manufacture, because consumers can get the lower retail price. Although the assembly rate and enterprises’ profits are not optimal, they have also been improved. In addition, when the government directly subsidizes enterprises, the enterprises will actively cooperate with the subsidy policy and are more willing to adopt prefabricated construction.

Female Community Health Volunteers (FCHVs) in Nepal are the key drivers to implementing frontline health services. We explored the potential for engaging FCHVs for CVD risk screening at the community level in Nepal. Methods We used multiple approaches (quantitative and qualitative) for data collection. The trained FCHVs administered CVD risk screening questionnaire among 491 adults in rural and urban areas and calculated the CVD risk scores. To maintain consistency and quality, a registered medical doctor also, using the same risk scoring chart, independently calculated the CVD risk scores. Kappa statistics and concordance coefficient were used to compare these two sets of risk screening results. Sensitivity and specificity analyses were conducted. Two focus group discussions among the FCHVs were conducted to determine their experiences with CVD risk screening and willingness to engage with CVD prevention and control efforts. Results The mean level of agreement between two sets of risk screening results was 94.5% (Kappa = 0.77, P&lt;0.05). Sensitivity of FCHV screening was 90.3% (95% CI: 0.801–0.964); and the specificity was 97% (95% CI: 0.948, 0.984). FCHVs who participated in the FGDs expressed a strong enthusiasm and readiness to using the CVD risk screening tools. Despite their busy workload, all FCHVs showed high level of motivation and willingness in using CVD risk screening tools and contribute to the prevention and control efforts of NCDs. The FCHVs recommended needs for providing additional training and capacity building opportunities. Conclusion We conclude that there is a potential for engaging FCHVs to use simple CVD risk screening tools at the community level. The findings are promising, however, further studies engaging larger number of FCHVs and larger population would warrant feasibility of such tools within the existing healthcare systems in Nepal."
https://openalex.org/W4205330135,"Nutrition literacy has been cited as a crucial life skill. Nutrition education as a primary school subject has been treated inconsequentially when compared to other subjects. We investigated an aspect of the current state of nutrition education in Ghana by engaging stakeholders about their sources of nutrition information and the perceived barriers in implementing nutrition education in mainstream primary schools.Three hundred and fifty one (351) primary school children, 121 homebased caregivers, six schoolteachers, two headteachers, two Ghana Education Service (GES) officials, and six school cooks were involved in the study. Surveys were used to collect data on nutrition information acquisition behaviors and to record perceived barriers. Key Informant Interviews were conducted among GES officials, headteachers, schoolteachers and school cooks, while Focus Group Discussions were used among homebased caregivers and children to gather qualitative information.Only 36.3% of the primary school children had heard about nutrition, and 71% of those got nutrition information from their family members. About 70% of homebased caregivers had heard or seen nutrition messages, and their source of nutrition information was predominantly traditional media. Schoolteachers mostly received their nutrition information from non-governmental organizations and the Internet, while most of the school cooks stated their main source of nutrition information was hospital visits. Perceived barriers included schoolteachers' knowledge insufficiency, and lack of resources to adequately deliver nutrition education. Lack of a clear policy appeared to be an additional barrier.The barriers to the implementation of nutrition education in the mainstream curriculum at the primary school level that were identified in this study can be resolved by: providing schoolteachers with learning opportunities and adequate nutrition education resources for practical delivery, having specific national policy framework, and including family members and school cooks in the nutrition education knowledge and information dissemination process."
https://openalex.org/W4205381315,"Tensiomyography measures the radial displacement of a muscle during an electrically evoked twitch contraction. The rate of muscle displacement is increasingly reported to assess contractile properties. Several formulas currently exist to calculate the rate of displacement during the contraction phase of the maximal twitch response. However, information on the reproducibility of these formulas is scarce. Further, different rest intervals ranging from 10 s to 30 s are applied between consecutive stimuli during progressive electrical stimulation until the maximum twitch response. The effect of different rest intervals on the rate of displacement has not been investigated so far. The first aim of this study is to investigate the within and between-day reliability of the most frequently used formulas to calculate the rate of displacement. The second aim is to investigate the effect of changing the inter-stimulus interval on the rate of displacement. We will determine the rectus femoris and biceps femoris rate of displacement of twenty-four healthy subjects’ dominant leg on two consecutive days. The maximum displacement curve will be determined two times within three minutes on the first day and a third time 24 h later. On day two, we will also apply three blocks of ten consecutive stimuli at a constant intensity of 50 mA. Inter-stimuli intervals will be 10 s, 20 s or 30 s in each block, respectively, and three minutes between blocks. The order of inter-stimulus intervals will be randomized. This study will allow a direct comparison between the five most frequently used formulas to calculate the rate of displacement in terms of their reproducibility. Our data will also inform on the effect of different inter-stimulus intervals on the rate of displacement. These results will provide helpful information on methodical considerations to determine the rate of displacement and may thus contribute to a standardized approach."
https://openalex.org/W4206094068,"Introduction The prevalence of metabolically healthy obesity (MHO) varies based on different criteria. We assessed the prevalence of MHO and metabolic unhealthiness based on body mass index (BMI) and their association with metabolic syndrome (MetS) in a nation-wide study. Methods Data were taken from the STEPs 2016 study, from 18,459 Iranians aged ≥25 years. Demographic, metabolic, and anthropometric data were collected. Subjects were stratified by BMI, metabolic unhealthiness, and having MetS. The latter was defined based on National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III 2004 (NCEP ATP III), was then assessed. Results The prevalence of MHO and metabolic unhealthiness in obese subjects was 7.5% (about 3.6 million) and 18.3% (about 8.9 million), respectively. Most of the metabolic unhealthy individuals were female (53.5%) or urban residents (72.9%). Low physical activity was significantly and positively associated (Odds Ratio: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.04–1.35) with metabolic unhealthiness, while being a rural residence (0.83, 0.74–0.93), and having higher education (0.47, 0.39–0.58) significantly but negatively affected it. Dyslipidemia was the most frequent MetS component with a prevalence rate of 46.6% (42.1–51.1), 62.2% (60.8–63.6), 76.3% (75.1–77.5), and 83.4% (82.1–84.6) among underweight, normal weight, overweight and obese phenotypes, respectively. Conclusion BMI aside, an additional set of criteria such as metabolic markers should be taken into account to identify normal weight but metabolically unhealthy individuals. Given the highest prevalence of dyslipidemia among obese subjects, further interventions are required to raise public awareness, promote healthy lifestyles and establish lipid clinics."

The purpose of this research is to study the relationship between intestinal parasite infections and undernutrition/anemia to clarify the priorities of intervention in the rural area of Gakenke district in the Northern Province of Rwanda.A total of 674 students from Nemba I School, participated in a cross-sectional study, in which their parasitological and nutritional status were analysed. Statistical analysis was performed by χ2 test, univariate analysis and Odds ratios (OR).A total of 95.3% of children presented intestinal parasitism, most of whom (94.5%) infected by protozoa and 36.1% infected by soil-transmitted helminths (STH), with Trichuris trichiura (27.3%) being the most prevalent. Multiple infections were found to be high (83.8%), with protozoa and STH co-infections in 30.6%. STH infections were mainly of low/moderate intensity. Neither infection nor STH infection of any intensity profile, was significantly related to anemia. In addition, STH infection, regardless of the intensity profile, was not associated with stunting, underweight or thinness. There was no difference between genders nor among ages in odds of anemia and nutritional status in STH-infected schoolchildren.Multiparasitism remains high among Rwandan schoolchildren and is likely to cause nutritional problems. This work emphasizes the importance of keeping up health programs to reduce the prevalence of infection."
https://openalex.org/W4205386610,"Theophylline is an important drug for treatment of canine chronic bronchitis and bradyarrhythmias, but new products require validation since pharmacokinetics in dogs can vary by formulation. A new, 503B outsourcing facility-produced theophylline product (OFT) is available for veterinary use. Outsourcing facilities have many advantages over traditional compounding sources including current good manufacturing practice compliance. The purpose of this study was to establish the pharmacokinetics of OFT in dogs. Eight healthy dogs received 11 mg/kg intravenous aminophylline and 10 mg/kg oral OFT followed by serial blood sampling in a two-way, randomized, crossover design with 7-day washout. Plasma theophylline concentrations were quantified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Bioavailability, maximum concentration, time to maximum concentration, half-life and area under the curve were: 97 ± 10%, 7.13 ± 0.71 μg/mL, 10.50 ± 2.07 h, 9.20 ± 2.87 h, and 141 ± 37.6 μg*h/mL, respectively. Steady-state predictions supported twice daily dosing of the OFT, but specific dosage recommendations are hindered by lack of a canine-specific therapeutic range for plasma theophylline concentration. These findings suggest that the OFT is well absorbed and can likely be dosed twice daily in dogs, but future pharmacodynamic and clinical studies are needed to establish a definitive therapeutic range for theophylline in this species."

https://openalex.org/W4206566416,"Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the first intron of the FTO gene reported in 2007 continue to be the known variants with the greatest effect on adiposity in different human populations. Coding variants in the FTO gene, on the other hand, have been little explored, although data from complete sequencing of the exomes of various populations are available in public databases and provide an excellent opportunity to investigate potential functional variants in FTO. In this context, this study aimed to track nonsynonymous variants in the exons of the FTO gene in different population groups employing the gnomAD database and analyze the potential functional impact of these variants on the FTO protein using five publicly available pathogenicity prediction programs. The findings revealed 345 rare mutations, of which 321 are missense (93%), 19 are stop gained (5.6%) and five mutations are located in the splice region (1.4%). Of these, 134 (38.8%) were classified as pathogenic, 144 (41.7%) as benign and 67 (19.5%) as unknown. The available data, however, suggest that these variants are probably not associated with BMI and obesity, but instead, with other diseases. Functional studies are, therefore, required to identify the role of these variants in disease genesis."
https://openalex.org/W4206818795,"This study presents an empirical method to model the high-energy photon beam percent depth dose (PDD) curve by using the home-generated buildup function and tail function (buildup-tail function) in radiation therapy. The modeling parameters n and μ of buildup-tail function can be used to characterize the Collimator Scatter Factor (Sc) either in a square field or in the different individual upper jaw and lower jaw setting separately for individual monitor unit check.The PDD curves for four high-energy photon beams were modeled by the buildup and tail function in this study. The buildup function was a quadratic function in the form of [Formula: see text] with the main parameter of d (depth in water) and n, while the tail function was in the form of e-μd and was composed by an exponential function with the main parameter of d and μ. The PDD was the product of buildup and tail function, PDD = [Formula: see text]. The PDD of four-photon energies was characterized by the buildup-tail function by adjusting the parameters n and μ. The Sc of 6 MV and 10 MV can then be expressed simply by the modeling parameters n and μ.The main parameters n increases in buildup-tail function when photon energy increased. The physical meaning of the parameter n expresses the beam hardening of photon energy in PDD. The fitting results of parameters n in the buildup function are 0.17, 0.208, 0.495, 1.2 of four-photon energies, 4 MV, 6 MV, 10 MV, 18 MV, respectively. The parameter μ can be treated as attenuation coefficient in tail function and decreases when photon energy increased. The fitting results of parameters μ in the tail function are 0.065, 0.0515, 0.0458, 0.0422 of four-photon energies, 4 MV, 6 MV, 10 MV, 18 MV, respectively. The values of n and μ obtained from the fitted buildup-tail function were applied into an analytical formula of Sc = nE(S)0.63μE to get the collimator to scatter factor Sc for 6 and 10 MV photon beam, while nE, μE, S denotes n, μ at photon energy E of field size S, respectively. The calculated Sc were compared with the measured data and showed agreement at different field sizes to within ±1.5%.We proposed a model incorporating a two-parameter formula which can improve the fitting accuracy to be better than 1.5% maximum error for describing the PDD in different photon energies used in clinical setting. This model can be used to parameterize the Sc factors for some clinical requirements. The modeling parameters n and μ can be used to predict the Sc in either square field or individual jaws opening asymmetrically for treatment monitor unit double-check in dose calculation. The technique developed in this study can also be used for systematic or random errors in the QA program, thus improves the clinical dose computation accuracy for patient treatment."
https://openalex.org/W4206833833,"Plant regeneration is important for vegetative propagation, detoxification and the obtain of transgenic plant. We found that duckweed regeneration could be enhanced by regenerating callus. However, very little is known about the molecular mechanism and the release of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). To gain a global view of genes differently expression profiles in callus and regenerating callus, genetic transcript regulation has been studied. Auxin related genes have been significantly down-regulated in regenerating callus. Cytokinin signal pathway genes have been up-regulated in regenerating callus. This result suggests the modify of auxin and cytokinin balance determines the regenerating callus. Volatile organic compounds release has been analysised by gas chromatography/ mass spectrum during the stage of plant regeneration, and 11 kinds of unique volatile organic compounds in the regenerating callus were increased. Cyclohexane treatment enhanced duckweed regeneration by initiating root. Moreover, Auxin signal pathway genes were down-regulated in callus treated by cyclohexane. All together, these results indicated that cyclohexane released by regenerating callus promoted duckweed regeneration. Our results provide novel mechanistic insights into how regenerating callus promotes regeneration."
