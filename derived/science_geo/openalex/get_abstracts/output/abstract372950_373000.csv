This adaptive prokaryotic immune system arises from the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) found in prokaryotic genomes, which harbor short invader-derived sequences, and the CRISPR-associated (Cas) protein-coding genes. Here, we have identified a CRISPR-Cas effector complex that is comprised of small invader-targeting RNAs from the CRISPR loci (termed prokaryotic silencing (psi)RNAs) and the RAMP module (or Cmr) Cas proteins. The psiRNA-Cmr protein complexes cleave complementary target RNAs at a fixed distance from the 3′ end of the integral psiRNAs. In Pyrococcus furiosus, psiRNAs occur in two size forms that share a common 5′ sequence tag but have distinct 3′ ends that direct cleavage of a given target RNA at two distinct sites. Our results indicate that prokaryotes possess a unique RNA silencing system that functions by homology-dependent cleavage of invader RNAs.

Our results indicate that prokaryotes possess a unique RNA silencing system that functions by homology-dependent cleavage of invader RNAs. RNAs that arise from the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) found in prokaryotic genomes are hypothesized to guide proteins encoded by CRISPR-associated (cas) genes to silence potential genome invaders in prokaryotes (Makarova et al., 2006Makarova K.S.

CRISPRs consist of multiple copies of a short repeat sequence (typically 25 - 40 nucleotides) separated by similarly-sized variable sequences that are derived from invaders such as viruses and conjugative plasmids (Mojica et al., 2005Mojica F.J.

CRISPR loci are found in nearly all sequenced archaeal genomes and approximately half of bacterial genomes (Haft et al., 2005Haft D.H. Selengut J. Mongodin E.F. Nelson K.E.

Direct. 2006; 1: 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). Over 40 cas genes have been described, a subset of which is found in any given organism (Jansen et al., 2002Jansen R. Embden J.D.

Direct. 2006; 1: 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). The proteins encoded by the cas genes include predicted RNA binding proteins, endo- and exo-nucleases, helicases, and polymerases (Jansen et al., 2002Jansen R. Embden J.D. Gaastra W. Schouls L.M.

Direct. 2006; 1: 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated that CRISPRs and cas genes function in invader defense in prokaryotes. Exposure of microorganisms that possess the CRISPR-Cas system to a virus results in the appearance of new virus-derived sequences at the leader-proximal end of CRISPR loci in the genomes of surviving individuals (Barrangou et al., 2007Barrangou R. Fremaux C. Deveau H. Richards M. Boyaval P. Moineau S. Romero D.A. Horvath P.

Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 1390-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). Moreover, the acquisition or loss of invader-specific CRISPR elements or of Cas protein genes has been directly correlated with virus and plasmid resistance or sensitivity, respectively (Barrangou et al., 2007Barrangou R. Fremaux C. Deveau H. Richards M. Boyaval P. Moineau S. Romero D.A. Horvath P.

Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 1390-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). This rapidly evolving immune system influences the ecology of natural microbial populations (Andersson and Banfield, 2008Andersson A.F. Banfield J.F.

RNAs from the CRISPR loci are hypothesized to guide the CRISPR-Cas defense response based on their potential to base pair with invading nucleic acids. Available data indicate that entire CRISPR loci are transcribed from the leader region, producing primary transcripts containing the full set of CRISPR repeats and embedded invader-derived (or guide) sequences (Jansen et al., 2002Jansen R.

Terns M.P. Prokaryotic silencing (psi)RNAs in Pyrococcus furiosus.RNA. 2008; 14: 2572-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). These large precursor RNAs are processed into shorter (∼60–70 nucleotide) intermediate RNAs that contain individual invader-targeting sequences (∼25–40 nucleotides) by Cas endonucleases that cleave within the repeats (Brouns et al., 2008Brouns S.J.

Cas6 is an endoribonuclease that generates guide RNAs for invader defense in prokaryotes.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 3489-3496Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). However, the ultimate products of the CRISPR loci appear to be smaller RNAs (Brouns et al., 2008Brouns S.J. Jore M.M. Lundgren M. Westra E.R. Slijkhuis R.J. Snijders A.P. Dickman M.J. Makarova K.S.

Brugger K. Redder P. Phan H. Christiansen J. Garrett R.A. CRISPR families of the crenarchaeal genus Sulfolobus: bidirectional transcription and dynamic properties.Mol Microbiol. 2009; PubMed Google Scholar). In Pyrococcus furiosus, the most abundant CRISPR RNAs are two species of ∼45 nucleotides and ∼39 nucleotides (Hale et al., 2008Hale C. Kleppe K. Terns R.M. Terns M.P. Prokaryotic silencing (psi)RNAs in Pyrococcus furiosus.RNA. 2008; 14: 2572-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). These small, abundant products of the CRISPR loci are thought to be the prokaryotic silencing (psi)RNAs of the CRISPR-Cas RNA silencing pathway (Makarova et al., 2006Makarova K.S. Grishin N.V. Shabalina S.A. Wolf Y.I. Koonin E.V.

Terns R.M. Terns M.P. Prokaryotic silencing (psi)RNAs in Pyrococcus furiosus.RNA. 2008; 14: 2572-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, the protein-mediated functions of the CRISPR-Cas system are apparently carried out by distinct sets of Cas proteins in different organisms (Haft et al., 2005Haft D.H. Selengut J. Mongodin E.F. Nelson K.E. A guild of 45 CRISPR-associated (Cas) protein families and multiple CRISPR/Cas subtypes exist in prokaryotic genomes.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2005; 1: e60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Six “core” CRISPR-associated genes (cas1 - cas 6) are found in many and diverse organisms, however, most organisms have only a subset of these 6 genes and only cas1 is present in nearly all organisms that appear to possess the system (Haft et al., 2005Haft D.H. Selengut J. Mongodin E.F. Nelson K.E. A guild of 45 CRISPR-associated (Cas) protein families and multiple CRISPR/Cas subtypes exist in prokaryotic genomes.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2005; 1: e60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Makarova et al., 2006Makarova K.S. Grishin N.V. Shabalina S.A. Wolf Y.I. Koonin E.V. A putative RNA-interference-based immune system in prokaryotes: computational analysis of the predicted enzymatic machinery, functional analogies with eukaryotic RNAi, and hypothetical mechanisms of action.Biol. Direct. 2006; 1: 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the core cas genes in a given organism are complemented by one or more sets of additional cas genes: the cse, csy, csn, csd, cst, csh, csa, csm, and cmr genes (Haft et al., 2005Haft D.H. Selengut J. Mongodin E.F. Nelson K.E. A guild of 45 CRISPR-associated (Cas) protein families and multiple CRISPR/Cas subtypes exist in prokaryotic genomes.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2005; 1: e60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These sets are comprised of 2 to 6 CRISPR-associated genes that cosegregate, and are mostly designated for a prototypical organism (e.g., the cse or Cas subtype Escherichia coli genes) (Haft et al., 2005Haft D.H. Selengut J. Mongodin E.F. Nelson K.E. A guild of 45 CRISPR-associated (Cas) protein families and multiple CRISPR/Cas subtypes exist in prokaryotic genomes.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2005; 1: e60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). (The cmr (Cas module RAMP) gene set is named for its 4 RAMP (repeat-associated mysterious proteins; see below) gene members.) E. coli K12, for example, has 3 core cas genes and the full set of 5 cse genes (which includes the E. coli subtype member of the core Cas5 gene family, cas5e) (Brouns et al., 2008Brouns S.J. Jore M.M. Lundgren M. Westra E.R. Slijkhuis R.J. Snijders A.P. Dickman M.J. Makarova K.S. Koonin E.V. van der Oost J. Small CRISPR RNAs guide antiviral defense in prokaryotes.Science. 2008; 321: 960-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar). Phylogenetic analyses suggest that the cas genes are distributed by lateral gene transfer (Jansen et al., 2002Jansen R. Embden J.D. Gaastra W. Schouls L.M.

Biol. 2005; 1: e60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The functional consequences of the differences in the complement of Cas proteins found among organisms are not yet known. Functional classes have been predicted for many of the Cas proteins based on sequence, but very few of the proteins have been characterized. Only one of the core Cas proteins, Cas6, has a clearly established function which is to process precursor CRISPR RNAs to release individual invader-targeting RNAs (Carte et al., 2008Carte J. Wang R. Li H. Terns R.M. Terns M.P. Cas6 is an endoribonuclease that generates guide RNAs for invader defense in prokaryotes.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 3489-3496Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Cas1 was recently shown to be a DNA-specific endonuclease with properties consistent with a role in processing invader DNA into fragments that become incorporated into CRISPR loci (Wiedenheft et al., 2009Wiedenheft B. Zhou K. Jinek M. Coyle S.M. Ma W. Doudna J.A.

The five E. coli subtype Cas proteins (Cse1-4 and Cas5e (Haft et al., 2005Haft D.H. Selengut J. Mongodin E.F. Nelson K.E. A guild of 45 CRISPR-associated (Cas) protein families and multiple CRISPR/Cas subtypes exist in prokaryotic genomes.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2005; 1: e60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) have been shown to form a complex that processes precursor CRISPR RNAs in E. coli (which lacks Cas6) (Brouns et al., 2008Brouns S.J. Jore M.M.

Small CRISPR RNAs guide antiviral defense in prokaryotes.Science. 2008; 321: 960-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar). Many of the Cas proteins are members of the large superfamily of RAMP proteins, which have features of RNA binding proteins (Makarova et al., 2002Makarova K.S. Aravind L. Grishin N.V. Rogozin I.B.

Direct. 2006; 1: 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). At least a few of the RAMPs (including for example Cas6) have been found to possess previously unpredicted nuclease activity (Beloglazova et al., 2008Beloglazova N. Brown G.

The Cas proteins are expected to function in various aspects of maintenance of CRISPR gene loci (including addition of new invader-derived elements in response to infection) as well as psiRNA biogenesis and psiRNA-mediated resistance to invaders. While there is very strong evidence that CRISPR RNAs and Cas proteins function to silence potential invaders in prokaryotes (Barrangou et al., 2007Barrangou R. Fremaux C. Deveau H. Richards M.

Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 1390-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar), the effector complexes and silencing mechanisms of the CRISPR-Cas pathway remain unknown. Recent studies in Staphylococcus species and E. coli (Brouns et al., 2008Brouns S.J. Jore M.M. Lundgren M. Westra E.R. Slijkhuis R.J. Snijders A.P. Dickman M.J. Makarova K.S.

The results presented here demonstrate that the Cmr or RAMP module proteins function with mature psiRNAs to cleave target RNAs. These findings define psiRNA-guided RNA cleavage as a mechanism for the function of the CRISPR-Cas system in organisms that possess the RAMP module of Cas proteins. PsiRNAs are hypothesized to guide Cas proteins to effect invader silencing in prokaryotes (Makarova et al., 2006Makarova K.S. Grishin N.V. Shabalina S.A. Wolf Y.I. Koonin E.V.

P. furiosus is a hyperthermophilic archaeon whose genome encodes 200 potential psiRNAs (organized in seven CRISPR loci) and at least 29 potential Cas proteins (largely found in 2 gene clusters), including members of all six core Cas protein families and three sets of additional Cas proteins: the Cmr, Cst and Csa proteins (see Figure 1F). In P. furiosus, most psiRNAs are processed into two species of ∼45 nucleotides and ∼39 nucleotides (Hale et al., 2008Hale C. Kleppe K. Terns R.M. Terns M.P. Prokaryotic silencing (psi)RNAs in Pyrococcus furiosus.RNA. 2008; 14: 2572-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the functional components of the CRISPR-Cas invader defense pathway, we isolated complexes containing the mature psiRNA species from P. furiosus cellular extract on the basis of psiRNA fractionation profiles (Figure 1). The doublet of psiRNAs, detectable both by Northern blotting of an individual psiRNA and total RNA staining (SYBR), was purified away from larger CRISPR-derived RNAs (including the 1× intermediate; Hale et al., 2008Hale C. Kleppe K. Terns R.M. Terns M.P. Prokaryotic silencing (psi)RNAs in Pyrococcus furiosus.RNA. 2008; 14: 2572-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) as well as other cellular RNAs (Figure 1C). To determine whether the psiRNAs are components of RNA-protein complexes in the purified fraction (Figure 1C), we performed native gel northern analysis. The mobility of the psiRNAs on native gel electrophoresis was reduced in the purified fraction relative to a sample from which proteins were extracted (Figure 1D), indicating the presence of psiRNA-protein complexes in the purified fraction. We gel purified the psiRNA-containing complex from the native gel and analyzed the sample by mass spectrometry. The sample contained a mixture of proteins that included seven Cas proteins identified with 99% confidence: Cmr1-1, Cmr1-2, Cmr2, Cmr3, Cmr4, Cmr5, and Cmr6 (Figure 1E). The identities of the non-Cas proteins found in the sample are listed in Table S1, available online. Analysis of a native gel-purified psiRNP obtained by an alternate chromatography scheme revealed a similar Cas protein profile (Cmr2, Cmr3, Cmr4, and Cmr6), but few common non-Cas proteins (Table S1). The five common copurifying non-Cas proteins are denoted in Table S1. None of these proteins has any known link to the CRISPR-Cas system. Remarkably, the seven Cas proteins associated with the complex are all encoded by the tightly linked RAMP module or cmr genes (Haft et al., 2005Haft D.H. Selengut J. Mongodin E.F. Nelson K.E. A guild of 45 CRISPR-associated (Cas) protein families and multiple CRISPR/Cas subtypes exist in prokaryotic genomes.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2005; 1: e60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the identified proteins comprise the complete set of Cmr proteins (Haft et al., 2005Haft D.H. Selengut J. Mongodin E.F. Nelson K.E.

In light of this newfound respect, we discuss emerging views on lipid droplet biology and speculate on the major advances to come. Long underappreciated as important cellular organelles, lipid droplets are finally being recognized as dynamic structures with a complex and interesting biology. In light of this newfound respect, we discuss emerging views on lipid droplet biology and speculate on the major advances to come. Long perceived as inert fat particles, lipid droplets (LDs) have been largely ignored by cell biologists. However, more recently, LDs are increasingly recognized as dynamic organelles that represent a frontier for cell biology. These ubiquitous organelles are found in most eukaryotic cells (Figure 1; see SnapShot, this issue). They range greatly in size (diameter < 1–100 μm), and each consists of a phospholipid monolayer that surrounds a core of neutral lipids, such as sterol esters or triacylglycerols. Numerous proteins, many of which play functional roles in LD biology, decorate their surfaces. LDs are therefore structurally similar to plasma lipoproteins, which are secreted from cells and transport lipids through the aqueous circulation to different regions of the body. We are just beginning to understand fundamental aspects of LD biogenesis, catabolism, and functional activities in cells. This increased knowledge of LD cell biology has relevance for applied science in the fields of human health and biofuels. The earliest descriptions of lipid droplets date to the 19th century. Both Richard Altmann and E.B. Wilson described fat droplets in cells and speculated about their origin (Altmann, 1890Altmann R. Die Elementarorganisem und ihre Beziehungen zu den Zellen. Veit, Leipzig1890Google Scholar, Wilson, 1896Wilson E. The Cell in Development and Inheritance. Macmillan, New York1896Google Scholar). Early on, the high diffraction properties of LDs facilitated their identification by light microscopy. With their recognition as a component of most cells in the early 1900s came a respectable name for this organelle: the liposome. However, in the late 1960s, artificial liposomes were invented and quickly usurped the name. Since then, the organelles were called by many names, including lipid droplets, lipid bodies, fat bodies, fat droplets, and adiposomes. In plants, they are often called oil bodies. As the field rapidly evolves, it seems to be settling on the name “lipid droplets.” Other than morphological studies, LDs received scant attention for decades. In 1991, the discovery of perilipin, a phosphoprotein associated with LDs in adipocytes, brought new attention to the organelle (Greenberg et al., 1991Greenberg A. Egan J.J. Wek S. Garty N. Blanchette-Mackie E. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11341-11346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since then, the number of papers about LDs has increased dramatically. This may reflect numerous factors, including basic research related to obesity and oil production, fields in which LD biology plays a prominent role, and the recognition of a virtually untapped frontier of cell biology. For many cells and organisms, energy supplies in the environment fluctuate between surplus and starvation, and the ability to store energy may provide a competitive evolutionary advantage. Cellular energy is stored mainly in the form of triacylglycerols, which are hydrophobic, highly reduced, and concentrated molecules for storing energy. Within cells, energy storage is compartmentalized in LDs. Indeed, the most highly specialized cells dedicated to this process are adipocytes, in which LDs often occupy the bulk of the cytoplasm. In mammals, energy storage and catabolism in LDs are highly regulated by hormones and signaling pathways. LDs are also a repository for the building blocks for biological membranes, such as phospholipids and sterols. When needed, these lipids can be generated from catabolism and mobilization of lipids in LDs. In yeast, such hydrolysis of triacylglycerols has been linked to the cell cycle and is coupled with rapid membrane expansion (Kurat et al., 2009Kurat C. Wolinski H. Petschnigg J. Kaluarachchi S. Andrews B. Natter K. Kohlwein S. Mol. Cell. 2009; 33: 53-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). By compartmentalizing lipids, LDs buffer cells from the toxic effects of excessive amounts of lipid. For example, macrophages can take up large amounts of cholesterol, which can trigger endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and eventually cell death by apoptosis or necrosis (Maxfield and Tabas, 2005Maxfield F.R. Tabas I. Nature. 2005; 438: 612-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). However, excess sterols can be detoxified by conversion to sterol esters and storage in LDs, thereby protecting the cells against toxicity. Similar buffering through esterification and partitioning into LDs may protect cells from other lipids or lipophilic substances that may be toxic in excess (e.g., fatty acids or retinol). LDs are involved in intracellular protein metabolism. For example, during development of the fruit fly Drosophila, histones accumulate at the surfaces of LDs until they are incorporated into rapidly dividing nuclei (Cermelli et al., 2006Cermelli S. Guo Y. Gross S. Welte M. Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 1783-1795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The core protein of the hepatitis C virus also localizes to LDs during viral replication in hepatocytes (Miyanari et al., 2007Miyanari Y. Atsuzawa K. Usuda N. Watashi K. Hishiki T. Zayas M. Bartenschlager R. Wakita T. Hijikata M. Shimotohno K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 1089-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). LDs also have been linked functionally to the spliceosome and proteasome (Cho et al., 2007Cho S.Y. Shin E.S. Park P.J. Shin D.W. Chang H.K. Kim D. Lee H.H. Lee J.H. Kim S.H. Song M.J. et al.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 2456-2465Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, Guo et al., 2008Guo Y. Walther T.C. Rao M. Stuurman N. Goshima G. Terayama K. Wong J.S. Vale R.D. Walter P. Farese Jr., R.V. Nature. 2008; 453: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, Ohsaki et al., 2006Ohsaki Y. Cheng J. Fujita A. Tokumoto T. Fujimoto T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 2674-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In the proteasome, LDs might serve as platforms for the deposition and degradation of some proteins. The growth of an LD requires the addition of both polar lipids at the droplet surface and neutral lipids within the hydrophobic core. The polar lipids include primarily phospholipids and sterols. Phospholipids may be derived from de novo synthesis or by conversion of glycerolipids, such as diacylglycerol derived from triacylglycerol hydrolysis. Although data are limited, the major phospholipids in LDs are phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine. The biosynthesis of these two phospholipids occurs primarily in the ER. It is unclear how a need for synthesis of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine is sensed by a growing LD and how these phospholipids are added to the LD surface. In cells with limited phosphatidylcholine synthesis due to loss of CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (the rate-limiting enzyme), LDs are larger than normal, possibly in part because there is limited phosphatidylcholine for LD surfaces thus promoting the fusion of LDs (Guo et al., 2008Guo Y. Walther T.C. Rao M. Stuurman N. Goshima G. Terayama K. Wong J.S. Vale R.D. Walter P. Farese Jr., R.V. Nature. 2008; 453: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). The growth of an LD can involve the addition of large amounts of triacylglycerols to its core, implying that triacylglycerol synthesis must be coordinated with LD growth. The synthesis of triacylglycerol in cells occurs mostly from the glycerol-phosphate pathway in which fatty acid moieties are added sequentially to a glycerol backbone. In the final step of triacylglycerol synthesis, diacylglycerol and fatty acyl CoAs are converted to triacylglycerol in a reaction catalyzed by acyl CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferases (DGAT) (Yen et al., 2008Yen C. Stone S. Koliwad S. Harris C. Farese R. J. Lipid Res. 2008; 49: 2283-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Many of the enzymes in the triacylglycerol synthetic pathway, including DGAT enzymes, are found in the ER and mitochondria or in mitochondria-associated membranes and occur in multiple isoforms (Coleman and Lee, 2004Coleman R.A. Lee D.P. Prog. Lipid Res. 2004; 43: 134-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar, Yen et al., 2008Yen C. Stone S. Koliwad S. Harris C. Farese R. J. Lipid Res. 2008; 49: 2283-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). How newly synthesized triacylglycerol is delivered to the cores of nascent LDs is unclear. The prevailing model posits that triacylglycerol is synthesized within the ER and released between the leaflets of the bilayer membrane. When triacylglycerol accumulates over a certain threshold, a fat lens is believed to form in the bilayer and bulge into the cytoplasm through a budding process. How the triacylglycerol is channeled to budding domains, how budding occurs mechanistically, and how the directionality of the budding is achieved are not understood. Indeed, little experimental evidence supports the budding model, and alternative models have been proposed (reviewed in Walther and Farese, 2009Walther T. Farese Jr., R.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1791: 459Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). For example, a speculative model that we proposed is “vesicular budding,” in which newly formed lipids might fill the bilayer of existing membrane vesicles, effectively filling the vesicle with neutral lipids (Walther and Farese, 2009Walther T. Farese Jr., R.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1791: 459Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). In a variation of this model, the ER bilayer is filled with neutral lipids and the resulting bulge does not detach from the ER. In this scenario, LDs would constitute a specialized ER domain that remains connected to the ER bilayer. This would allow rapid exchange of lipids between the ER and LDs during synthesis and mobilization. However, when LDs grow, the high curvature of the membrane at the neck, formally resembling a hemifusion intermediate, would likely require stabilizing proteins. The addition of triacylglycerol to the cores of LDs may also occur through the local synthesis of triacylglycerol at the surfaces of LDs or in ER membranes adjacent to droplets. Two recent studies demonstrated triacylglycerol synthesis in isolated droplets and linked this to the presence of enzymes (e.g., acyl-coenzyme A synthetase and DGAT2) that activate and esterify fatty acids (Fujimoto et al., 2007Fujimoto Y. Itabe H. Kinoshita T. Homma K. Onoduka J. Mori M. Yamaguchi S. Makita M. Higashi Y. Yamashita A. et al.J. Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 1280-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, Kuerschner et al., 2008Kuerschner L. Moessinger C. Thiele C. Traffic. 2008; 9: 338-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Many LDs also contain large amounts of sterol esters. For example, sterol esters constitute about half of the neutral lipids in yeast LDs. In mammalian cells, sterol esters are the major neutral lipid in LDs of adrenocortical cells and macrophage foam cells in atherosclerotic lesions. Sterol esters are synthesized from sterols and fatty acyl CoA in reactions catalyzed by sterol-O-acyltransferases. These enzymes, like DGATs, are localized in the ER, and it is unclear how their products are channeled to LD cores. LDs might also “grow” through fusion of smaller LDs into larger LDs, but this is likely to be a rare event in most cell types. Although a few studies show apparent fusion of LDs in time-lapse images (Boström et al., 2007Boström P. Andersson L. Rutberg M. Perman J. Lidberg U. Johansson B. Fernandez-Rodriguez J. Ericson J. Nilsson T. Borén J. et al.Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 1286-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, Guo et al., 2008Guo Y. Walther T.C. Rao M. Stuurman N. Goshima G. Terayama K. Wong J.S. Vale R.D. Walter P. Farese Jr., R.V. Nature. 2008; 453: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar), conclusive data for this mechanism are lacking. If fusion does occur, one possible mechanism is through simple phase coalescence. In fact, we speculate that specific proteins coating LD surfaces may prevent them from coalescing. This conjecture is supported by data in seeds of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana in which deficiency of oleosin, the major structural LD protein, leads to apparent fusion of LDs (Siloto et al., 2006Siloto R. Findlay K. Lopez-Villalobos A. Yeung E. Nykiforuk C. Moloney M. Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 1961-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Another possibility is that SNARE proteins mediate LD fusion (Boström et al., 2007Boström P. Andersson L. Rutberg M. Perman J. Lidberg U. Johansson B. Fernandez-Rodriguez J. Ericson J. Nilsson T. Borén J. et al.Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 1286-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), similar to their roles in the fusion of vesicle bilayers, although evidence supporting this conjecture is limited. The metabolic functions of LDs may be partially mediated by proteins bound to their surface. How proteins are specifically targeted to LDs is unknown. Molecular “zip codes,” such as sequences that direct proteins to the ER or mitochondria, have not been identified for LDs. Several distinct mechanisms might mediate targeting of proteins to LDs. Similar to the binding of some apolipoproteins to lipoproteins, the binding of some proteins to LD surfaces involves amphipathic α helices. Perhaps the best studied example is Tip47, one of the family of LD-binding PAT proteins (perilipin, ADRP/adipophilin, Tip47, and related proteins). The crystal structure of a fragment of Tip47 revealed structural similarity to apolipoprotein (apo) E (Hickenbottom et al., 2004Hickenbottom S. Kimmel A. Londos C. Hurley J. Structure. 2004; 12: 1199-1207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), with a four-helix bundle that contains amphipathic α helices. By analogy to apoE's binding to lipoproteins, the four-helix bundle of Tip47 may open to facilitate the binding of the internal hydrophobic helices to the surface of LDs. Binding via amphipathic α helices is a likely mechanism for other proteins that are targeted to LD surfaces. How such proteins would distinguish between the LD surface monolayer and the bilayer of other organelle surfaces is unknown. One possibility is that LD specificity might be achieved by a dynamic interplay between specific surface lipids and the proteins that bind and modify them. Proteins might also target LDs through a hydrophobic domain that embeds in the LD surface. This domain could be at the N or C terminus or lie within an internal region of a protein, which would result in surrounding hydrophilic regions of the protein projecting from the droplet surface. Examples of the latter include DGAT2, hepatitis C virus core protein, and caveolins (Boulant et al., 2006Boulant S. Montserret R. Hope R. Ratinier M. Targett-Adams P. Lavergne J. Penin F. McLauchlan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22236-22247Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, Martin and Parton, 2006Martin S. Parton R.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar, Ostermeyer et al., 2004Ostermeyer A. Ramcharan L. Zeng Y. Lublin D. Brown D. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, Thiele and Spandl, 2008Thiele C. Spandl J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2008; 20: 378-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Such a topology would enable proteins to move from a bilayer membrane to a monolayer LD surface. For example, caveolin is normally located in specific plasma membrane domains via a long hydrophobic stretch that is embedded in the membrane bilayer. When cells are incubated with fatty acids, a significant fraction of caveolin localizes to LDs (Robenek et al., 2004Robenek M.J. Severs N.J. Schlattmann K. Plenz G. Zimmer K.P. Troyer D. Robenek H. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 866-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). A similar mechanism involving the ER bilayer and LDs has been suggested for DGAT2 (Stone et al., 2009Stone S. Levin M. Zhou P. Han J. Walther T. Farese Jr., R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 5352-5361Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, Thiele and Spandl, 2008Thiele C. Spandl J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2008; 20: 378-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The targeting of proteins to LDs through lipid modifications, similar to mechanisms that target proteins to membrane bilayers, also seems likely, although there is no direct evidence as yet for this mechanism. How such proteins would dynamically change their localization from a bilayer membrane to an LD monolayer is unclear. It seems unlikely that a long lipid-embedded domain is extracted from membranes during relocalization. If LDs remain contiguous with membranes, such as the ER, the protein might directly diffuse from the bilayer to the LD. Alternatively, membrane vesicular traffic may connect the plasma membrane or ER with LDs. Two lines of evidence support this possibility. First, biochemical approaches reconstituting in vitro vesicle formation from yeast microsomes have led to identification of a vesicle population that might connect the ER with LDs (Takeda and Nakano, 2008Takeda Y. Nakano A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2008; 143: 803-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Second, two independent RNAi screens identified a crucial function for the Arf1/COPI vesicular transport machinery in LD morphology and lipolysis (Beller et al., 2008Beller M. Sztalryd C. Southall N. Bell M. Jäckle H. Auld D. Oliver B. PLoS Biol. 2008; 6: e292https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0060292Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, Guo et al., 2008Guo Y. Walther T.C. Rao M. Stuurman N. Goshima G. Terayama K. Wong J.S. Vale R.D. Walter P. Farese Jr., R.V. Nature. 2008; 453: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). A defect in lipolysis in cells lacking Arf1/COPI components may be due at least partially to a requirement for trafficking of the adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), the major triglyceride lipase, to LDs (Beller et al., 2008Beller M. Sztalryd C. Southall N. Bell M. Jäckle H. Auld D. Oliver B. PLoS Biol. 2008; 6: e292https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0060292Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, Soni et al., 2009Soni K. Mardones G. Sougrat R. Smirnova E. Jackson C. Bonifacino J. J. Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 1834-1841Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Given that Arf1/COPI proteins have a canonical function in vesicle generation in the Golgi apparatus, they might also function in vesicular trafficking to LDs. This model, however, presents a topological problem. How would vesicles surrounded by a bilayer membrane fuse with the monolayer surrounding the LDs? A membrane hemifusion of the outer vesicle bilayer with the surface monolayer of an LD would provide one solution for the transfer of lipids or proteins, but this idea is highly speculative. Complicating the interpretation of most protein localization data is that some proteins observed in LDs may actually be localized to membranes close to the LDs. Many electron micrographs show ER membranes immediately adjacent to the LD surface, and light microscopy methods lack sufficient resolution to distinguish the exact localization of proteins between the LD surface and adjacent membranes. For example, DGAT2, an ER enzyme, localizes to LDs when cells are treated with fatty acids, but it is unclear if this reflects targeting to the LD surface or to an adjacent ER bilayer compartment (Kuerschner et al., 2008Kuerschner L. Moessinger C. Thiele C. Traffic. 2008; 9: 338-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, Stone et al., 2009Stone S. Levin M. Zhou P. Han J. Walther T. Farese Jr., R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 5352-5361Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Similarly, ADRP/adipophilin, which is considered a “classic” LD surface protein by light microscopy studies, has a significant pool in the LD-juxtaposed ER membrane (Robenek et al., 2006Robenek H. Hofnagel O. Buers I. Robenek M.J. Troyer D. Severs N.J. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 4215-4224Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Proteins that lack transmembrane domains but have hydrophobic domains could exchange between the two compartments, either by diffusion if the membranes were contiguous or by a shuttling mechanism. Although formal proof is lacking, the current model for LD biogenesis posits that the organelles are derived from the ER. This is logical inasmuch as the enzymes (e.g., DGAT and ACAT) that synthesize neutral lipids for the cores of LDs are localized primarily in the ER, and ER membranes are often found close to LDs (for examples, see Blanchette-Mackie et al., 1995Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Dwyer N.K. Barber T. Coxey R.A. Takeda T. Rondinone C.M. Theodorakis J.L. Greenberg A.S. Londos C. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1211-1226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, a recent freeze-fracture study revealed that a large portion of LDs are surrounded by ER membranes, similar to an egg cup holding an egg (Robenek et al., 2006Robenek H. Hofnagel O. Buers I. Robenek M.J. Troyer D. Severs N.J. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 4215-4224Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In yeast, nascent LDs are almost universally found in close proximity with ER membranes (N. Krahmer, P. Mardones, and T.C.W., unpublished data; Goodman, 2008Goodman J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 28005-28009Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Contact sites between LDs and the ER could serve several functions. One can envision a model in which LDs bulging from the ER maintain a physical connection with the ER, which could be stabilized by a specialized set of proteins. Such a connection could facilitate the exchange of proteins or lipids between the compartments. During lipolysis, for example, the diacylglycerols and fatty acids generated could be directly transferred to the ER for phospholipid synthesis. Similarly, a sterol transfer protein that was identified on the surface of LDs could mediate the transport of released sterol back to the ER (Hynynen et al., 2009Hynynen R. Suchanek M. Spandl J. Bäck N. Thiele C. Olkkonen V. J. Lipid Res. 2009; 50: 1305-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Additionally, LDs may associate functionally with other organelles. For example, in bacteria, which lack an ER, evidence suggests that LDs originate from the plasma membrane (Wältermann et al., 2005Wältermann M. Hinz A. Robenek H. Troyer D. Reichelt R. Malkus U. Galla H.J. Kalscheuer R. Stöveken T. von Landenberg P. et al.Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 55: 750-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Other studies have shown that LDs interact with membranes of peroxisomes, mitochondria, or replication vacuoles of intracellular parasites (reviewed in Goodman, 2008Goodman J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 28005-28009Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, Walther and Farese, 2009Walther T. Farese Jr., R.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1791: 459Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Few proteins have been identified as crucial for LD formation. Genomewide screens in Drosophila cells identified many genes whose loss of function results in fewer or smaller lipid droplets (Beller et al., 2008Beller M. Sztalryd C. Southall N. Bell M. Jäckle H. Auld D. Oliver B. PLoS Biol. 2008; 6: e292https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0060292Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, Guo et al., 2008Guo Y. Walther T.C. Rao M. Stuurman N. Goshima G.

Similar screens in yeast suggest that seipin (encoded by the FLD1 gene) is involved (Fei et al., 2008Fei W. Shui G. Gaeta B. Du X. Kuerschner L. Li P. Brown A. Wenk M. Parton R. Yang H. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 180: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, Szymanski et al., 2007Szymanski K. Binns D. Bartz R. Grishin N. Li W. Agarwal A. Garg A. Anderson R. Goodman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 20890-20895Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), but mechanistic insights are lacking. Tip47 also has been implicated in LD biogenesis (Bulankina et al., 2009Bulankina A. Deggerich A. Wenzel D. Mutenda K. Wittmann J. Rudolph M. Burger K. Höning S. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 185: 641-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). When cells need lipids to generate energy or synthesize membranes, lipolysis is activated to mobilize these substrates. During lipolysis of triacylglycerols, individual fatty acyl chains are sequentially cleaved from the glycerol backbone. In mammalian adipose tissue, lipolysis is highly regulated and induced by catecholamines during fasting or exercise (Zechner et al., 2009Zechner R. Kienesberger P. Haemmerle G. Zimmermann R. Lass A. J. Lipid Res. 2009; 50: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Catecholamines bind to G protein-coupled receptors, leading to an increase in intracellular cAMP via activation of adenylate cyclase and, as a consequence, the activation of protein kinase A (PKA). In turn, PKA phosphorylates a number of proteins, including hormone-sensitive lipase and perilipin (Brasaemle et al., 2009Brasaemle D. Subramanian V. Garcia A. Marcinkiewicz A. Rothenberg A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2009; 326: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of perilipin triggers release of CGI-58, a coactivator of ATGL. Subsequently, ATGL is recruited to LDs, where the complex catalyzes the removal of the first acyl chain from triacylglycerols. Phosphorylation of hormone-sensitive lipase activates this enzyme, leading to relocalization to the LD surface, where it cleaves the second acyl chain, to yield monoacylglycerol. The last acyl chain is removed by monoacylglycerol lipase, and glycerol is released. During this process, the different lipases are targeted directly to the surface of the LD to interact with their respective substrates. But how, for example, ATGL penetrates the LD-delimiting monolayer and accesses triacylglycerols located in the core is unknown. We speculate that a lipase, or a protein complex involving a lipase, binds to the LD surface and effectively parts the surface phospholipid monolayer, allowing a neutral lipid in the core to access the catalytic site of an overlying lipase. Some evidence from cultured cells suggests that, under maximum stimulation of lipolysis, LDs may break up into smaller LDs, which would provide more surface area for lipases. Whether this occurs in normal physiology is unknown. Such a process could be facilitated by proteins that deform membranes and initiate budding, such as coatamer proteins (Guo et al., 2008Guo Y. Walther T.C. Rao M. Stuurman N. Goshima G. Terayama K. Wong J.S. Vale R.D. Walter P. Farese Jr., R.V. Nature. 2008; 453: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). LDs may also get degraded by autophagy (Singh et al., 2009Singh R. Kaushik S. Wang Y. Xiang Y. Novak I. Komatsu M. Tanaka K. Cuervo A. Czaja M. Nature. 2009; 458: 1131-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (2238) Google Scholar), but the relative contribution of this pathway to lipolysis is not clear. Autophagy could provide a mechanism for bulk recycling of lipids for cellular utilization, in contrast to the more selective, and hormonally induced, lipolytic mechanisms that provide release of lipids from cells. LDs play an important role in diseases of excess triacylglycerol storage, such as obesity and metabolic syndrome, which often lead to cardiovascular complications and the development of type 2 diabetes. Indeed, many diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, and fatty liver disease, could be referred to as “diseases of excessive LDs.” LDs in adipocytes, muscle cells, hepatocytes, and cardiac myocytes likely protect cells from the effects of too much fat. Yet, in many instances, excessive lipid deposition may exceed the capacity of cells and lead to dysfunction, termed lipotoxicity (reviewed in Schaffer, 2003Schaffer J.E. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2003; 14: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). This raises the interesting and so far unanswered question of what determines the capacity of a cell to store fat. Several studies have shown that increasing the capacity for triacylglycerol synthesis in cells or tissues is protective in some instances (Yen et al., 2008Yen C. Stone S. Koliwad S. Harris C. Farese R. J. Lipid Res. 2008; 49: 2283-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the protein Fsp27/CIDEC regulates fat storage in adipocytes (Gong et al., 2009Gong J. Sun Z. Li P. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2009; 20: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and might also regulate the storage capacity of LDs (Keller et al., 2008Keller P. Petrie J. De Rose P. Gerin I. Wright W.S. Chiang S.H. Nielsen A.R. Fischer C.P. Pedersen B.K. MacDougald O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 14355-14365Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Also, rare genetic disorders result in excessive LDs in tissues: homozygous deficiency of ATGL or CGI-58 causes neutral lipid storage disease and is associated with myopathy or skin ichthyosis, respectively (Schweiger et al., 2009Schweiger M. Lass A. Zimmerman R. Eichmann T. Zechner R. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2009; 297: E289-E296Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). LDs also play a major role in atherosclerosis. In atherosclerotic arteries, cholesterol esters accumulate in LDs of macrophages resulting in “foam cells,” which are hallmarks of atherosclerotic lesions. In foam cells, LDs likely serve to buffer the cells against toxicity from excessive amounts of unesterified sterols. If macrophages are overwhelmed by excessive amounts of lipids, they may undergo apoptotic and necrotic cell death, contributing to lesion instability and, ultimately, to stroke and heart attack (Maxfield and Tabas, 2005Maxfield F.R. Tabas I. Nature. 2005; 438: 612-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). Besides metabolic diseases, LDs function in the intracellular replication of several infectious agents, including Chlamydia and hepatitis C virus (Boulant et al., 2007Boulant S. Targett-Adams P. McLauchlan J. J. Gen. Virol. 2007; 88: 2204-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, Cocchiaro et al., 2008Cocchiaro J. Kumar Y. Fischer E. Hackstadt T. Valdivia R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Biol. Sci. 2009; 85: 217Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), suggesting new therapeutic angles for these infections. Apart from diseases, LDs are engendering intense study in the applied science of oil production for nutrition or biofuel purposes. Generating animals or crops with altered or maximized lipid production has long occurred through breeding and will likely increase with genetic engineering. Additionally, efforts to industrially produce LDs in algae or bacteria as sources of biofuels to provide energy are rapidly increasing (Service, 2009Service R. Science. 2009; 325: 379Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Traditionally, plant oils, stored in lipid bodies (the functional equivalents of LDs in plants), were produced in species such as Brassica napus and processed to yield biodiesel. The current engineering of photosynthetic microorganisms such as algae promises to bring industrial scale production of oil to a new arena. We have touched on most of the fundamental questions concerning LDs that remain unanswered, such as those pertaining to their functions, formation, growth, and catabolism. One additional question is whether all organelles now called LDs are indeed equivalent or merely resemble each other. For example, are the sterol-rich droplets in macrophage foam cells similar in protein composition to lipid droplets in triacylglycerol-rich adipocytes? Might different types of LDs originate through different mechanisms? At least for LDs formed in bacteria, it is already clear that the mechanisms differ from those in eukaryotes."

The aim of the present study was to examine the mechanisms that underlie IL-17A-induced BBB breakdown. Barrier integrity was analyzed in the murine brain endothelial cell line bEnd.3 by measuring the electrical resistance values using electrical call impedance sensing technology. Furthermore, in-cell Western blots, fluorescence imaging, and mono-cyte adhesion and transendothelial migration assays were performed. Experimental autoimmune encephzalomyelitis (EAE) was induced in C57BL/6 mice. IL-17A induced NADPH oxidase- or xanthine oxidase-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The resulting oxidative stress activated the endothelial contractile machinery, which was accompanied by a down-regulation of the tight junction molecule occludin. Blocking either ROS formation or myosin light chain phosphorylation or applying IL-17A-neutralizing antibodies prevented IL-17A-induced BBB disruption. Treatment of mice with EAE using ML-7, an inhibitor of the myosin light chain kinase, resulted in less BBB disruption at the spinal cord and less infiltration of lymphocytes via the BBB and subsequently reduced the clinical characteristics of EAE. These observations indicate that IL-17A accounts for a crucial step in the development of EAE by impairing the integrity of the BBB, involving augmented production of ROS.—Huppert, J., Closhen, D., Croxford, A., White, R., Kulig, P., Pietrowski, E., Bechmann, I., Becher, B., Luhmann, H.

They also give a molecular explanation for how rising CO2 concentrations elicit intense fear and provide a foundation for dissecting the bases of anxiety and panic disorders. Fear is an evolutionarily conserved process that ensures survival by initiating avoidance or escape from predators and harmful situations (Ohman and Mineka, 2001Ohman A. Mineka S.

In humans, abnormal fear and anxiety are hallmarks of many psychiatric diseases; panic disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder are two extreme examples. Previous studies have revealed much about the complex behavioral neurobiology that underlies fear in mammals, including both conditioned (or acquired) and unconditioned (or innate) fear (Gorman et al., 2000Gorman J.M.

Acquired fear involves the learned association of a conditioned stimulus, such as a specific environment, with an unconditioned stimulus such as a footshock. An example is the contextual fear conditioning protocol often utilized in mice (Kim and Jung, 2006Kim J.J. Jung M.W.

In contrast, innate fear does not require prior conditioning; examples are a fear of snakes in humans and the innate fear of fox feces odor (trimethylthiazoline) in mice (Ohman and Mineka, 2001Ohman A.

For both innate and acquired fear behavior, the amygdala, including lateral, basal, and central nuclei, plays a critical role (Adolphs, 2002Adolphs R. Neural systems for recognizing emotion.Curr.

The neurobiology of conditioned and unconditioned fear: a neurobehavioral system analysis of the amygdala.Behav. Cogn. Neurosci. Rev. 2004; 3: 23-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The lateral amygdala accepts input arising from sensory systems including sensory cortices and thalamus, from executive cortices, and from the hippocampus. The basal amygdala communicates with both lateral and central nuclei of the amygdala and also contributes to fear behavior. Much of the output from the amygdala flows from the central nucleus of the amygdala, which is critical for signaling areas producing physiological and behavioral manifestations of fear. The amygdala is also important in learned fear, forming associations between conditioned and unconditioned stimuli. Thus, the amygdala is central for processing and directing the inputs and outputs that are key to fear behavior. However, the amygdala itself is not known to be a sensor of fear-evoking stimuli. In previous studies, we discovered that the acid-sensing ion channel-1a (ASIC1a) is particularly abundant in the amygdala and other fear circuit structures (Coryell et al., 2007Coryell M.

ASICs are activated in vitro when extracellular pH falls, and although acidic pH modifies the activity of many receptors and proteins, few besides ASICs are activated by extracellular acidosis, and few are as exquisitely pH sensitive (Diochot et al., 2007Diochot S.

Disrupting the ASIC1a gene (ACCN2) in mice eliminates currents evoked by pH as low as 5.0 in central neurons (Askwith et al., 2004Askwith C.C. Wemmie J.A. Price M.P. Rokhlina T. Welsh M.J.

Thus, ASIC1a is critical for acid-evoked currents in CNS neurons. The contribution of both the amygdala and ASIC1a to fear behavior raised questions of how ASIC1a in the amygdala is activated, especially in vivo. We hypothesized that a reduced pH might induce fear behavior by activating ASIC1a, thereby allowing the amygdala to function as a chemosensor deep within the fear circuit. To explore this issue, we used CO2 inhalation for three main reasons. First, physiologic effects of CO2 in mammals typically result from a reduced pH (Zandbergen et al., 1989Zandbergen J. Pols H. De Loof C. Lousberg H. Griez E. Effect of hypercapnia and other disturbances in the acid-base-balance on panic disorder.Hillside J. Clin. Psychiatry. 1989; 11: 185-197PubMed Google Scholar), which might activate ASIC1a channels. Brain pH rapidly falls when the enzyme carbonic anhydrase catalyzes the conversion of CO2 and water to carbonic acid (Nattie, 1998Nattie E. Central chemoreceptors, pH, and respiratory control.in: Kaila K. Ransom B.R. pH and Brain Function. Wiley-Liss, Inc., Wilmington, DE1998: 535-560Google Scholar). Second, it is well known that rising CO2 concentrations can elicit intense fear (Papp et al., 1993Papp L.A. Klein D.F. Gorman J.M. Carbon dioxide hypersensitivity, hyperventilation, and panic disorder.Am. J. Psychiatry. 1993; 150: 1149-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Third, the use of CO2 as a probe has important clinical implications for psychiatric disorders. Nearly a century ago, it was discovered that CO2 inhalation can trigger panic attacks, and patients with panic disorder are particularly susceptible (Drury, 1918Drury A.N. The percentage of carbon dioxide in the alveolar air, and the tolerance to accumulating carbon dioxide in case of so-called “irritable heart”.Heart. 1918; 7: 165-173Google Scholar). Many subsequent clinical studies fostered hope that understanding CO2 sensitivity would provide unique insight into the neurobiology underlying anxiety disorders and lead to better treatments (Dratcu, 2000Dratcu L.

The percentage of carbon dioxide in the alveolar air, and the tolerance to accumulating carbon dioxide in case of so-called “irritable heart”.Heart. 1918; 7: 165-173Google Scholar). Others suggested that CO2 sensitivity in panic might be due to a psychological vulnerability to losing control (Sanderson et al., 1989Sanderson W.C. Rapee R.M. Barlow D.H. The influence of an illusion of control on panic attacks induced via inhalation of 5.5% carbon dioxide-enriched air.Arch. Gen. Psychiatry. 1989; 46: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). A role for brainstem ventilatory chemosensors and hyperventilation has also been speculated (Gorman et al., 2000Gorman J.M.

Psychiatry. 2003; 53: 863-870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and the “false-suffocation-alarm theory” proposes that rising CO2 heralds impending suffocation and that this alarm is falsely triggered in patients with panic disorder (Klein, 1993Klein D.F. False suffocation alarms, spontaneous panics, and related conditions. An integrative hypothesis.Arch. Gen. Psychiatry. 1993; 50: 306-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). However, the molecular identity and neuroanatomical location of the putative CO2 alarm have remained uncertain (Dratcu, 2000Dratcu L. Panic, hyperventilation and perpetuation of anxiety.Prog.

False suffocation alarms, spontaneous panics, and related conditions. An integrative hypothesis.Arch. Gen. Psychiatry. 1993; 50: 306-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). With this background, we hypothesized that inhaling CO2 would reduce brain pH and that the acidosis would trigger ASIC channels in the amygdala to elicit fear. Whereas CO2 is known to stimulate chemosensors in the periphery and brainstem, if CO2 and hence acidosis were to directly activate the amygdala, it would suggest that the amygdala is an important chemosensory structure (Brannan et al., 2001Brannan S. Liotti M. Egan G. Shade R. Madden L. Robillard R. Abplanalp B. Stofer K. Denton D. Fox P.T. Neuroimaging of cerebral activations and deactivations associated with hypercapnia and hunger for air.Proc.

Neuroanatomical hypothesis of panic disorder, revised.Am. J. Psychiatry. 2000; 157: 493-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). We developed four paradigms to test CO2-triggered fear in mice: (1) CO2-evoked freezing, (2) CO2 effects in the open-field test, (3) CO2 aversion, and (4) CO2-potentiated context fear conditioning. To assess the response to CO2, we assayed freezing, which is used as a correlate of fear and panic in mice (Mongeluzi et al., 2003Mongeluzi D.L. Rosellini R.A. Ley R. Caldarone B.J. Stock H.S. The conditioning of dyspneic suffocation fear. Effects of carbon dioxide concentration on behavioral freezing and analgesia.Behav. Modif. 2003; 27: 620-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In humans with panic disorder, breathing 5% CO2 evokes panic attacks (Rassovsky and Kushner, 2003Rassovsky Y. Kushner M.G. Carbon dioxide in the study of panic disorder: issues of definition, methodology, and outcome.J. Anxiety Disord. 2003; 17: 1-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) but it rarely evokes panic in control subjects. Consistent with this, 5% CO2 produced little or no freezing in mice (Figure 1A). In humans who do not have panic disorder, breathing higher CO2 concentrations is more likely to evoke panic (Rassovsky and Kushner, 2003Rassovsky Y. Kushner M.G. Carbon dioxide in the study of panic disorder: issues of definition, methodology, and outcome.J. Anxiety Disord. 2003; 17: 1-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Likewise, breathing 10% CO2 triggered significant freezing in control mice (Figure 1A). However, disrupting the ASIC1a gene substantially blunted the response. Moreover, acutely inhibiting ASIC1a with either psalmotoxin (PcTx1) (Diochot et al., 2007Diochot S. Salinas M. Baron A. Escoubas P. Lazdunski M. Peptides inhibitors of acid-sensing ion channels.Toxicon. 2007; 49: 271-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) or A-317567 (Dube et al., 2005Dube G.R. Lehto S.G. Breese N.M. Baker S.J. Wang X. Matulenko M.A. Honore P. Stewart A.O. Moreland R.B. Brioni J.D. Electrophysiological and in vivo characterization of A-317567, a novel blocker of acid sensing ion channels.Pain. 2005; 117: 88-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) also reduced CO2-evoked freezing in wild-type mice (Figure 1B). Neither inhibitor reduced freezing in ASIC1a−/− animals, suggesting that their effects were ASIC1a specific. Thus, CO2 produced fear-like freezing behavior that depended on ASIC1a. The tendency of mice to avoid the center of an open field is used as a measure of their fear and anxiety of open spaces. In wild-type mice, breathing CO2 concentrations greater than 5% reduced the amount of center activity in an open field (Figure 1C). However this effect was much attenuated in ASIC1a−/− mice. We examined the aversive effect of CO2 on behavior by allowing mice to move between two chambers, one with 15% CO2 and one with <2% CO2. During a 10 min assay, ASIC1a+/+ mice only briefly sampled the CO2 chamber, spending >90% of the time in the air chamber (Figure 1D). In contrast, ASIC1a−/− mice spent similar amounts of time in both chambers. Failure to avoid CO2 did not generalize to other aversive stimuli as both genotypes avoided moving air infused into one of the chambers; ASIC1a+/+ mice spent 69% ± 7% and ASIC1a−/− mice 82% ± 4% of time in the non-air-infused chamber (n = 7 per group; p > 0.15; Wilcoxon rank sum). Context fear conditioning is often used to measure fear and anxiety, and our earlier work showed that disrupting or inhibiting ASIC1a impaired fear conditioning (Coryell et al., 2007Coryell M. Ziemann A.E. Westmoreland P.J. Haenfler J.M. Kurjakovic Z. Zha X.M. Price M. Schnizler M.K. Wemmie J. Targeting ASIC1a reduces innate fear and alters neuronal activity in the fear circuit.Biol.

Overexpression of acid-sensing ion channel 1a in transgenic mice increases fear-related behavior.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 3621-3626Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). During training with a series of footshocks, wild-type mice froze (Figure 1E), as previously described (Coryell et al., 2008Coryell M.W. Wunsch A.M. Haenfler J.M. Allen J.E. McBride J.L. Davidson B.L. Wemmie J.A. Restoring Acid-sensing ion channel-1a in the amygdala of knock-out mice rescues fear memory but not unconditioned fear responses.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 13738-13741Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, when training was conducted in the presence of 10% CO2, mice began to freeze before receiving footshocks and froze even more once the footshocks were delivered. The following day, we returned the mice to the original context (minus footshocks and minus CO2) and found that wild-type mice trained in CO2 showed more freezing than those not exposed to CO2 (Figure 1F). In contrast, CO2 had no significant effect on context fear conditioning in ASIC1a−/− mice. To learn whether CO2 itself might have served as an unconditioned stimulus, we used wild-type mice and delivered CO2 or air but no footshocks on the training day. On the testing day, neither group froze in response to the context (Figure 1F, inset). Thus, CO2 by itself did not act as an unconditioned stimulus, but it enhanced fear memory when coupled with footshocks. Thus, results in four different models suggest that CO2 evokes fear-like responses in wild-type mice and that those behaviors depend on ASIC1a. It seemed unlikely that genotype-dependent disparities in the arterial pressure of CO2 (PaCO2) would have accounted for differences in fear behavior in ASIC1a+/+ and ASIC1a−/− mice. Consistent with that assumption, breathing 10% CO2 induced a similar elevation of PaCO2 in both genotypes (Figure 2A). Because hypercarbic acidosis is well known to increase ventilation, we also measured the ventilatory response to CO2 inhalation. Wild-type and ASIC1a−/− mice showed a similar response to hypercarbia (Figure 2B). These data suggest that ASIC1a does not affect the chemosensory system controlling ventilation. We then turned our attention to the amygdala because of the possible association between the amygdala and panic (Gorman et al., 2000Gorman J.M. Kent J.M. Sullivan G.M. Coplan J.D. Neuroanatomical hypothesis of panic disorder, revised.Am. J. Psychiatry. 2000; 157: 493-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar), and because of the robust ASIC1a expression in the basolateral amygdala (Coryell et al., 2007Coryell M. Ziemann A.E. Westmoreland P.J. Haenfler J.M. Kurjakovic Z. Zha X.M. Price M. Schnizler M.K. Wemmie J. Targeting ASIC1a reduces innate fear and alters neuronal activity in the fear circuit.Biol. Psychiatry. 2007; 62: 1140-1148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). We measured pH in the basolateral amygdala of anesthetized mice and found that breathing CO2 reduced pH of both genotypes similarly (Figures 3A and 3B). We recorded similar reductions in the lateral ventricle (Figure 3C). Baseline pH in the mice breathing air was less than the expected range (pH ∼7.29–7.39) (Mayhan et al., 1988Mayhan W.G. Faraci F.M.

Physiol. 1965; 20: 443-452PubMed Google Scholar), likely due to respiratory suppression during anesthesia. Supporting this, PaCO2 in the anesthetized mice was elevated (65 ± 3 mm Hg) (Figure 2A) compared to levels (39–45 mm Hg) reported for awake or mechanically ventilated animals (Mayhan et al., 1988Mayhan W.G.

https://openalex.org/W2041034033,"Translational fidelity, essential for protein and cell function, requires accurate transfer RNA (tRNA) aminoacylation. Purified aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases exhibit a fidelity of one error per 10,000 to 100,000 couplings. The accuracy of tRNA aminoacylation in vivo is uncertain, however, and might be considerably lower. Here we show that in mammalian cells, approximately 1% of methionine (Met) residues used in protein synthesis are aminoacylated to non-methionyl-tRNAs. Remarkably, Met-misacylation increases up to tenfold upon exposing cells to live or non-infectious viruses, toll-like receptor ligands or chemically induced oxidative stress. Met is misacylated to specific non-methionyl-tRNA families, and these Met-misacylated tRNAs are used in translation. Met-misacylation is blocked by an inhibitor of cellular oxidases, implicating reactive oxygen species (ROS) as the misacylation trigger. Among six amino acids tested, tRNA misacylation occurs exclusively with Met. As Met residues are known to protect proteins against ROS-mediated damage, we propose that Met-misacylation functions adaptively to increase Met incorporation into proteins to protect cells against oxidative stress. In demonstrating an unexpected conditional aspect of decoding mRNA, our findings illustrate the importance of considering alternative iterations of the genetic code."

The detection of labeled intermediates within a methylation state revealed that mono-, di-, and trimethylated residues generally have progressively slower rates of formation. Furthermore, methylations associated with active genes have faster rates than methylations associated with silent genes. Finally, the presence of both an active and silencing mark on the same peptide results in a slower rate of methylation than the presence of either mark alone.

Histones are decorated extensively with numerous post-translational modifications (PTMs) 2The abbreviations used are: PTMpost-translational modificationsMSmass spectrometryChIPchromatin immunoprecipitationSILACstable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell cultureRMSDroot mean-squared difference. on several different residues (1Kouzarides T. Cell. 2007; 128: 693-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7825) Google Scholar). Located mostly in the unstructured N-terminal tails, these PTMs influence the expression of genes bound to the histones by the recruitment or displacement of non-histone transcriptional or regulatory proteins (2Martin C. Zhang Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 838-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (1558) Google Scholar). Lysine methylation is notable among histone PTMs for its diversity of forms and for its binary-like influence over gene expression. Methyltransferases and demethylases catalyze specific conversions between unmodified (me0), mono- (me1), di- (me2), and trimethylation (me3) states. For instance, while G9a and Suv39h1 direct histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) me1/me2 and me3 production, respectively (3Rice J.C. Briggs S.D. Ueberheide B. Barber C.M. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Shinkai Y.

The binary influence on gene expression can be illustrated with chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) studies that revealed H3K4 to be enriched in euchromatic regions and H3K9 in heterochromatic regions (6Noma K. Allis C.D. Grewal S.I. Science. 2001; 293: 1150-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Another residue that can be mono- and dimethylated on histones is arginine. Furthermore, whereas H4R3 methylation (7Wang H. Huang Z.Q. Xia L. Feng Q. Erdjument-Bromage H. Strahl B.D. Briggs S.D. Allis C.D. Wong J. Tempst P. Zhang Y.

These features suggest that histone lysine and arginine methylations are dynamically regulated processes. Nevertheless, most studies present histone methylation as a static condition at a particular time, with little regard to turnover or dynamics of the PTM. Indeed, the inability to resolve between transient and more long-lived methylations likely contributed to the traditional conception of histone methylation as irreversible (9Shi Y. Whetstine J.R. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 1-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Past studies have used radiolabeling to track methylation turnover on a non-residue specific basis (10Waterborg J.H. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; : 1-9Google Scholar) that tracked the modification profile of newly synthesized histones. For example, Pesavento et al. reported that newly synthesized H4 becomes progressively methylated at Lys-20 during the cell cycle (13Pesavento J.J. Yang H. Kelleher N.L. Mizzen C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 468-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Additionally, McManus et al. (14McManus K.J. Biron V.L. Heit R. Underhill D.A. Hendzel M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 8888-8897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) reported that levels of H3K9me1, me2, and me3 increase from interphase to metaphase, and decrease to initial levels at the start of the next mitotic cycle. To our knowledge, there is no report of a quantitative model characterizing the steady-state kinetics of global methylation on a residue-specific basis. The development of methods to investigate methylation kinetics would elucidate the mechanisms by which this PTM can temporally and dynamically regulate gene expression and provide a sensitive metric to distinguish cells in different physiological states. The importance of understanding the dynamics of histone methylation is illustrated with past studies demonstrating that the shift from H3K4me2 and H3K36me2/3 to H3K4me3 and H3K79me2 defined the temporal transition from RNA polymerase II binding to release for transcript elongation (16Morillon A. Karabetsou N. Nair A. Mellor J. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 723-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). To this end, we applied heavy methyl stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) (17Ong S. Mittler G. Mann M. Nat. Methods. 2004; 1: 1-8Crossref Scopus (356) Google Scholar) to quantitatively probe the rates of histone methylation on a residue-specific basis in HeLa cells (Fig. 1A). The method relies on mass spectrometry (18Trojer P. Li G. Sims 3rd, R.J. Vaquero A. Kalakonda N. Boccuni P. Lee D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Nimer S.D. Wang Y.H. Reinberg D.

Using heavy methyl SILAC to quantify histone methylation dynamics, we report that different lysine and arginine residues, and different methylation states within the same residue, have different rates of formation. This and other findings in our studies advance the current understanding of histone methylation and provide a platform for further research into the dynamics of histone PTMs. Throughout the experiment except during the transition into different media and sample collection, HeLa cells were maintained at 37 °C in 0.2 LPM CO2. Suspension cultures were initially maintained in minimum essential Joklik modified medium (SAFC Biosciences, KS) supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum (HyClone, UT), penicillin, streptomycin, and 1% GlutaMAX (Invitrogen). For the time course experiments, cultures were pelleted at 80 rcf in a refrigerated tabletop centrifuge. After decanting the media, cells were resuspended with Joklik media depleted of unlabeled methionine (HyClone) and supplemented with l-methionine-methyl-13CD3 (Sigma-Aldrich), which we term “labeled media.” We ran a parallel experiment with media supplemented with l-lysine-13C615N2 (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories Inc.) to determine the turnover for histone H1.4. The labeled media was supplemented with 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), penicillin, streptomycin, and 1% GlutaMAX. Daily aliquots were taken for 7 days, and media was replenished everyday to maintain a cell density of 2–6 × 105 cells/ml throughout the experiment. Cells were pelleted at 600 rcf and washed in phosphate-buffered saline. The pellets were flash frozen and stored at −80 °C. Histones were isolated from cells as described in Ref. 19Garcia B.A. Pesavento J.J. Mizzen C.A. Kelleher N.L. Nat.

After derivatization, samples were diluted in 0.1% acetic acid for desalting before MS analysis using homemade C18 STAGE tips as previously described (21LeRoy G. Weston J.T. Zee B.M. Young N.L. Plazas-Mayorca M.D. Garcia B.A. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2009; 8: 2432-2442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Samples were loaded by an Eksigent AS2 autosampler onto 75 μm ID fused silica capillary columns packed with 15 cm of C18-reversed phase resin (Magic C18, 5 μm particles, 200 Å pore size, Michrom BioResources) and constructed with an electrospray tip for nanoflow reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry on a hybrid linear quadrupole ion trap-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron). Peptides were resolved with a gradient from 5 to 35% Buffer B in a 110-min gradient (Buffer A: 0.1 m acetic acid, Buffer B: 70% acetonitrile in 0.1 m acetic acid) with a flow rate of ∼200 nl/min on an Agilent 1200 binary HPLC system. The Orbitrap was operated in data-dependent mode with a resolution of 30,000 for a full MS spectrum and 7 subsequent MS/MS spectra collected in the ion trap of fragments produced by collision-induced dissociation. To reduce duplicate MS/MS spectra, peptides selected for MS/MS interrogation were placed on an exclusion list for 30 s. All MS and MS/MS spectra were analyzed with Qual Browser (version 2.0.7, Thermo Scientific), and peptide abundances were obtained by chromatographic peak integration. Identities of all peptides were confirmed by manual inspection of MS/MS spectra (supplemental Fig. S1), and a list of all peptides quantified is provided (supplemental Table S1). To describe unambiguously a specific methylated species, we denote each residue with X:Y, where X is the number of total methyls, and Y is the number of labeled methyls. For instance, H3K36me1:0 refers to unlabeled monomethylated H3K36, and H3K36me1:1 refers to labeled monomethylated H3K36. We define “methylation states” as the distinction between me1, me2, and me3, and “labeled intermediates” as the different degrees of labeling within states. The relative abundances were calculated two ways, differing in what is considered the “total pool.” In the first method, the “total pool” represents all the methylation intermediates for a specific methylation state of a particular residue. Thus, the abundance of H3K36me1:0 would be determined with respect to H3K36me1:0 and me1:1. This reveals the distribution of differently labeled species within a methylation state and is more robust to variable ionization efficiencies of different methylation states within and between peptides. We justify the calculation with the logic that growth conditions should not change with 12CH3- or 13CD3-methionine, and that the total abundance of each methylated species does not change. For instance, the percentage of total H3 peptides monomethylated on Lys-36 should not change during the time course, but rather the distribution of labeled intermediates within the me1 state. We term values calculated from such a method as “relative distribution.” This was used to quantify half-maximal times of the formation of labeled peptides (t½), as described in supplemental Fig. S2. The half-maximal time provides a single measure of how quickly a particular species is formed, and thus is predictive of the overall rate of methylation for that species. In the second method, the “total pool” represents all methylation states and intermediates on the tryptic digest fragment. Thus, the abundance of H3K79me1:0 would be determined with respect to H3K79me1:0, me1:1, me2:0, me2:1, and me2:2. This provides a more accurate comparison of abundances between different methylation states. We term values calculated from such a method as “relative levels,” and this was used for extrapolating kinetic parameters. Both “relative distribution” and “relative levels” are unit-less variables. To quantify relative distributions, we applied another differential equation (supplemental Fig. S2), to determine the half-maximal times of the formation of the fully labeled species and used a Wilcoxon rank sum and Kruskal-Wallis test to compare half-maximal times between active and silencing marks. Relative distributions of the labeled methylation states and 13CD3-methionine incorporated protein from each replicate were fitted with MATLAB (7.8.0) (supplemental data and Fig. S1). To quantify relative levels, we derived a set of first order differential equations (supplemental Fig. S2) to characterize the dynamics of methylated residues in an idealized system (Fig. 1B). The parameters are the rate of unmodified histones becoming bound to chromatin (α), sequential addition of a labeled methyl (k0→1, k1→2, k2→3), sequential demethylation (k3→2, k2→1, k1→0), and histone degradation for each methylation state (μ0, μ1, μ2, μ3 for unmodified, mono-, di-, and tri- methylation respectively). Additionally, not all peptides necessarily acquire a 13CD3 methyl group, as 12CH3 from unlabeled methionine resulting from macromolecule decomposition contributes to the sequential methylation. Thus, parameters (k′0→1, k′1→2, k′2→3), for the unlabeled methyl contribution are also considered. Relative levels of all the species were fitted to the appropriate differential equations using MATLAB (7.8.0) (supplemental data and Fig. S2). Certain constraints were set to avoid non-biologically reasonable parameter values. In particular, none of the parameters could be less than 0. Additionally, all μ were set to be ≥ ln(2), which is the expected dilution rate resulting from cell division. After each of the 1000–10000 iterations of the program, a set of parameters is produced that minimizes the root mean squared difference (RMSD) between the observed data, and the expected solutions of the equations with the determined parameters. In the entire parameter space determined, we averaged only the sets of parameters that did not produce a RMSD greater than 125% of the minimum RMSD. To track and quantify newly methylated histones, we cultured HeLa cells in media with 13CD3-methionine. HeLa cell morphology appeared normal throughout the time course, indicating that the presence of the heavy isotope itself does not affect the biology of our system. Because most newly synthesized core histones H3 and H4 during S phase (23Osley M.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 827-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar) incorporate the labeled methionine (13CD3, +4 Da shift per methyl group incorporation), half-maximal labeling for all histones should occur after one mitotic cycle. The rate of label incorporation was determined by examining the peptides from H1.4 (residues 33–53, KASGPPVSELITKAVAASKER) H3 (residues 117–128, VTIMPKDIQLAR) and H4 (residues 79–92, KTVTAMDVVYALKR) (Fig. 2). The peptides mentioned above for H3 and H4 will incorporate a single labeled methionine during protein synthesis after incubation in the labeled 13CD3-methionine media and thus can be monitored for protein turnover. In Fig. 2A, we observed a peak at 748.932 m/z corresponding to the “old” unlabeled H3 117–128 peptide signal, and after 1 day, observed that this peptide signal is decreasing concurrently with the appearance of the “new” synthesized and isotopically labeled peptide at 750.945 m/z (Fig. 2C). Similarly, signals corresponding to the “old” and “new” H4 79–92 peptide can be detected at 881.998 and 884.010 m/z, respectively, as well (Fig. 2, B and D). As histone H1 variants do not contain methionine, we used a different SILAC experiment to monitor turnover of histone H1.4. For H1.4, we labeled cells with isotopically heavy lysine (15N213C6-lysine), and thus could monitor protein turnover of the H1 variant by analysis of many peptides. We chose the fully lysine labeled peptide 33–53 for estimation of H1.4 turnover (data not shown) as it gave robust signals in the MS. It should be noted that all the Lys and Arg residues on these three “general protein turnover” peptides from H3, H4, and H1.4 were not detected to be post-translationally modified in our HeLa cells and thus serve as ideal peptides to monitor overall protein turnover independently of PTM dynamics. Using this approach, we found that t½ was approximately 1 day for H3, H4, and H1.4, and this is consistent with the nearly 24 h doubling time of HeLa cells under physiological conditions, with H1.4 exhibiting slightly faster t½ than H3 and H4 (Table 1 and Fig. 3B). Previous studies of Drosophila histones revealed that H1 is deposited on newly replicated chromatin after H3 and H4, which are deposited at nearly the same time (24Worcel A. Han S. Wong M.L. Cell. 1978; 15: 969-977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), Because our HeLa cultures are asynchronous, we expect that such differences in mitotic timing average over any differences in histone deposition during DNA replication.TABLE 1The average half-maximal times (t½, days) of fully labeled histonesPTMt½S.E.TypePTMt½S.E.TypeOverall H31.2980.007–H3K36me2:20.5710.000A(48Bell O.

A possible mechanism is suggested by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching studies that find H1 variants rapidly bind and unbind to the linker DNA (26Misteli T. Gunjan A. Hock R. Bustin M. Brown D.T. Nature. 2000; 408: 877-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that the slightly greater rate of H1.4 protein turnover, relative to the core histones, hint at this rapid exchange of linker histones between nucleosomes. Other radiolabeling studies on mouse kidney cells also found H1 histones to have half-lives as much as three times shorter than H3 or H4, consistent with our observation of a very slight difference in half-lives for H1.4 versus H3 or H4 (27Djondjurov L.P. Yancheva N.Y. Ivanova E.C. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 4095-4102Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Yet, it is uncertain whether such results in terminally differentiated cells can be accurately recapitulated in the immortalized HeLa cell line. As diagramed in Fig. 1A, our experiments were performed by introducing HeLa cells grown in standard Joklik media into Joklik media that had 13CD3-methionine replacing natural methionine. Incorporation of a methyl group on the “new” labeled histones induces a +4 Da shift per methyl group. Thus, we expect to see +4, +8, and +12 Da shifts on newly labeled mono-, di-, and trimethylated peptides, respectively. Fig. 4 shows the incorporation of labeled methyl groups (me1, me2, and me3) onto histone H3K9 on the [M+2H]2+ ions detected from the peptide KSTGGKAPR. In Fig. 4A, we see at Day 0 the peptide signal coming only from the unlabeled “old” H3K9me1:0 peptide at 542.312 m/z, and as we progress through subsequent days in labeled media, we detect an increase in the “new” labeled H3K9me1:1 peptide at 544.324 m/z as expected (+4 Da shift on a 2+ charged peptide equals net +2 Da shift observed), and a decrease in the “old” H3K9me1:0 peptide. However, we made an interesting observation when analyzing MS data of H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 peptides. As shown in Fig. 4B, we detected the unlabeled “old” H3K9me2:0 peptide at 521.306 m/z at Day 0, and upon incubation of cells in the labeled media we detected an increase in the fully labeled “new” H3K9me2:2 peptide at 525.329 (+8 Da shift on a +2 charged peptide equals net +4 Da m/z shift) over several days. We also detected another peak at 523.318 m/z (Day 1) that co-eluted with the two other H3K9me2 peptides. Similarly, we also detected the “old” H3K9me3:0 peptide at 528.314 m/z and the newly fully labeled H3K9me3:3 peptide at 534.347 m/z (Fig. 4C). However, we detected two peaks at 530.325 and 532.335 m/z, respectively, that also co-elute with the unlabeled and fully labeled H3K9me3 peptides. We performed MS/MS experiments on these peptides, as shown in Fig. 5 for the peptide at 523.318 m/z co-eluting with the H3K9me2 peptides, and found these peptides possessed both unlabeled and labeled methyl groups on the Lys-9 residue. Fig. 5 displays the MS/MS spectrum for the 523.318 m/z species, and the fragmentation pattern is consistent with Lys-9 containing both one unlabeled and one labeled methyl group (b1 ion at 217 Da). We reasoned that this peptide originated from an H3 protein that was previously monomethylated on Lys-9, and was methylated to the dimethyl state after transfer into the 13CD3-labeled Joklik media. This methylated peptide represents an “intermediate” species that would have been missed by any other approach. In our quantitative analysis below, we also consider pathways where demethylation could lead to labeled intermediates. Additionally, the two “intermediate” H3K9me3 species at 530.325 and 532.335 m/z, respectively, were determined after MS/MS experiments (supplemental Table S1 and Fig. S2) to be H3K9me3 peptides containing 2 “old” and 1 “new” methyl labels, and 1 “old” and 2 “new” methyl labels, respectively. In other words, the species at 530.325 m/z was an H3K9me2 peptide that was progressively methylated to the trimethyl state, while the species at 532.335 m/z was an H3K9me1 peptide that was progressively methylated to the trimethyl state. In addition to H3K9, we monitored the methylation status of histone H3K4, H3K18, H3K27, H3K36, H3K79, H4R3, H4K20, and H1.4K25 (supplemental Fig. S3). Thus, our method is useful both for monitoring the disappearance of the old methylated histones and appearance of the newly methylated histones, and for tracking any “intermediate” species that indicate progressive methylation in histone dynamics. Using the methodology outlined above, we plotted the abundance of the peptides corresponding to the disappearance of “old” methylation, synthesis of “new” methylation and any “intermediate” methylation species for the H3, H4, and H1 residues. Fig. 6 shows the relative distribution of the three H3K9me2-labeled species. The H3K9me2:0 peptide is nearly completely gone by Day 7. H3K9me2:2 increases in abundance and reaches an asymptote of over 80%, while the “intermediate” H3K9me2:1 reaches a maximum at Day 1 and levels off in abundance over several days. The H3K9me2:2 peptide does not reach 100% abundance because of methylation from the unlabeled intracellular methionine pool; if the cells continued to grow in the labeled media, we expect that eventually this pool will become labeled and the H3K9me2:2 peptide should reach 100% abundance. The intermediate species often have different rates than “old” or “new” methyl peptides. As previously mentioned for H3K9me2 (Fig. 6), H3K9me2:2 becomes the primary labeled species with the me2 state by Day 2 and levels off in abundance after Day 3. The trend that the fully labeled species within a methylation state has the greatest relative abundance after the time course is observed for all residues analyzed (Fig. 6 and supplemental Fig. S4). We next compared the methylation rates of labeled species on different histone methylation residues to general overall histone turnover as described in Fig. 2. For example, comparisons made with the fully labeled peptides for H3K9, H4K20, and H3K36 peptides are shown in Fig. 7. Among our findings is the difference in the rate of label incorporation between the three methylation states of H3K9 (Table 1). From quantifying half-maximal times, we find that H3K9me1 reaches its final fully labeled state faster than histone H3. H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 have similar half-maximal times, and both states have t½ similar to histone H3 (Table 1). A similar pattern for each of the H4K20 methylation states was also observed, where H4K20me2 has a similar t½ as overall histone H4 protein as shown in Fig. 7B, consistent with previous evidence that H4K20 methylation does not appreciably turnover in vivo (14McManus K.J. Biron V.L. Heit R. Underhill D.A. Hendzel M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 8888-8897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In contrast, H3K36 methylation is much different, as both me1 and me2 have faster half-maximal rates than the histone H3 protein turnover (Fig. 7C and Table 1). Additionally, H3K27 methylation followed the overall trend of me1 > me2 > me3 (Table 1). The changes in t½ across different methylation states are not additive. For instance, H3K9me2 has a t½ nearly three times as long as H3K9me1, while H3K9me3 has a half-maximal time four times as long as H3K9me1. Thus, it is unlikely that differences in t½ between the methylation states are due to the additional time required to sequentially add methyl groups to a single residue. Half-maximal times for all methylation sites detected on histones H3, H4, and H1.4 are listed in Table 1. After quantifying t½ and categorizing the residues by their known epigenetic function, we observed that the silencing marks H3K27me3:3 and H4K20me3:3 have the slowest rates of all residues examined (Table 1). Our study also revealed the active mark H3K9me1 as having among the fastest rates. Indeed, active marks had significantly faster half-maximal times than repressive marks (p = 0.0200). The relative distributions of all labeled intermediates and fully labeled species for each histone peptide compared with overall turnover are shown in supplemental Fig. S4. When calculating the relative distributions for each labeled species, we combined the relative abundances of all the peptides that had the particular modification of interest without regard to modifications on other residues on the same peptide. This pertains to the H3 peptide KSTGGKAPR where both H3K9 can be methylated and K14 can be acetylated. When we deconvoluted the relative abundance for a labeled species into its two components, differing by Lys-14 acetylation, we observed that the rate of formation of H3K9me1:1 is increased by o"

Whereas progress has been made in designing proteins that mimic native proteins structurally, it is more difficult to design functional proteins. In comparison to recent successes in designing non-metalloproteins, it is even more challenging to rationally design metalloproteins that reproduce both the structure and function of native metalloenzymes. This is because protein metal-binding sites are much more varied than non-metal-containing sites, in terms of different metal ion oxidation states, preferred geometry and metal ion ligand donor sets. Because of their variability, it has been difficult to predict metal-binding site properties in silico, as many of the parameters, such as force fields, are ill-defined. Therefore, the successful design of a structural and functional metalloprotein would greatly advance the field of protein design and our understanding of enzymes. Here we report a successful, rational design of a structural and functional model of a metalloprotein, nitric oxide reductase (NOR), by introducing three histidines and one glutamate, predicted as ligands in the active site of NOR, into the distal pocket of myoglobin. A crystal structure of the designed protein confirms that the minimized computer model contains a haem/non-haem Fe(B) centre that is remarkably similar to that in the crystal structure. This designed protein also exhibits NO reduction activity, and so models both the structure and function of NOR, offering insight that the active site glutamate is required for both iron binding and activity. These results show that structural and functional metalloproteins can be rationally designed in silico."

Although recent results suggest that their formation may have been more complex than previously thought, they still are the best approximation to a stellar population formed over a relatively short timescale (less than 1 Gyr) and with virtually no dispersion in the iron content. Indeed, only one cluster-like system (omega Centauri) in the Galactic halo is known to have multiple stellar populations with a significant spread in iron abundance and age. Similar findings in the Galactic bulge have been hampered by the obscuration arising from thick and varying layers of interstellar dust. Here we report that Terzan 5, a globular-cluster-like system in the Galactic bulge, has two stellar populations with different iron contents and ages. Terzan 5 could be the surviving remnant of one of the primordial building blocks that are thought to merge and form galaxy bulges."
https://openalex.org/W2098359404,"In somatic cells of female placental mammals, one X chromosome is inactivated to minimize sex-related dosage differences of X-encoded genes. Random X chromosome inactivation (XCI) in the embryo is a stochastic process, in which each X has an independent probability to initiate XCI, triggered by the nuclear concentration of one or more X-encoded XCI-activators. Here, we identify the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF12 as an important XCI-activator. Additional copies of mouse Rnf12 or human RNF12 result in initiation of XCI in male mouse ES cells and on both X chromosomes in a substantial percentage of female mouse ES cells. This activity is dependent on an intact open reading frame of Rnf12 and correlates with the transgenic expression level of RNF12. Initiation of XCI is markedly reduced in differentiating female heterozygous Rnf12(+/-) ES cells. These findings provide evidence for a dose-dependent role of RNF12 in the XCI counting and initiation process."

Hsp70, through recruiting the ubiquitin ligase CHIP, promotes the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of HIF-1α but not HIF-2α, thereby inhibiting HIF-1-dependent gene expression. Disruption of Hsp70-CHIP interaction blocks HIF-1α degradation mediated by Hsp70 and CHIP. Inhibition of Hsp70 or CHIP synthesis by RNA interference increases protein levels of HIF-1α but not HIF-2α and attenuates the decay of HIF-1α levels during prolonged hypoxia.

https://openalex.org/W2084307938,"Despite the growing number of atomic-resolution membrane protein structures, direct structural information about proteins in their native membrane environment is scarce. This problem is particularly relevant in the case of the highly charged S1–S4 voltage-sensing domains responsible for nerve impulses, where interactions with the lipid bilayer are critical for the function of voltage-activated ion channels. Here we use neutron diffraction, solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the structure and hydration of bilayer membranes containing S1–S4 voltage-sensing domains. Our results show that voltage sensors adopt transmembrane orientations and cause a modest reshaping of the surrounding lipid bilayer, and that water molecules intimately interact with the protein within the membrane. These structural findings indicate that voltage sensors have evolved to interact with the lipid membrane while keeping energetic and structural perturbations to a minimum, and that water penetrates the membrane, to hydrate charged residues and shape the transmembrane electric field. X-ray crystal structures have been determined for many membrane proteins, but direct structural information about proteins in their native membrane environment is a rarity. A study combining neutron diffraction, solid-state NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations now provides a detailed picture of the structure and hydration of lipid bilayer membranes containing S1–S4 voltage-sensing domains, which are used by membrane proteins to sense and react to changes in membrane voltage. These polar voltage sensors are seen to adopt transmembrane orientations and to cause modest reshaping in the surrounding non-polar lipid bilayer, sufficient to allow water molecules to interact with the membrane to hydrate charged residues and shape the transmembrane electric field, while keeping energetic and structural perturbations to a minimum.

We discuss different strategies by which processive ubiquitin chain synthesis may be achieved. Regulation of protein stability by the UPS is now appreciated to have at least some impact on nearly all aspects of eukaryotic cell biology. The ubiquitylation cascade first involves the activation of ubiquitin by E1 enzyme and its subsequent transfer to a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2). E2 charged with ubiquitin (E2∼Ub) then coordinates with a ubiquitin ligase (E3) to ubiquitylate the protein substrate. Subsequent interactions between E2∼Ub and E3 can result in transfer of additional ubiquitins to the substrate-linked Ub to form a ubiquitin chain. A chain of four ubiquitins linked together via their Lysine 48 residue constitutes a minimal signal for substrate recognition by the 26S proteasome, which then degrades the appended protein (Chau et al., 1989Chau V. Tobias J.W. Bachmair A. Marriott D. Ecker D.J. Gonda D.K. Varshavsky A.

Hoffman L. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C.M. Recognition of the polyubiquitin proteolytic signal.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1248) Google Scholar). Some 650 ubiquitin ligases are encoded in the human genome (Deshaies and Joazeiro, 2009Deshaies R.J. Joazeiro C.A. RING domain E3 ubiquitin ligases.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2009; 78: 399-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1682) Google Scholar). Thus, regulation by ubiquitylation may be comparable to phosphorylation in terms of its impact on post-translational control of protein function. Approximately half of the ∼650 human ubiquitin ligases are predicted to be Cullin–Ring Ligases (CRLs). The collective impact of CRLs on protein turnover is substantial: ∼20 percent of all proteasome-dependent degradation is CRL-dependent (Soucy et al., 2009Soucy T.A. Smith P.G. Milhollen M.A. Berger A.J. Gavin J.M. Adhikari S. Brownell J.E. Burke K.E. Cardin D.P. Critchley S. et al.An inhibitor of NEDD8-activating enzyme as a new approach to treat cancer.Nature. 2009; 458: 732-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1184) Google Scholar). CRLs are modular multi-subunit complexes that recruit E2 via their RING domain subunit and recruit substrate via a variable subunit linked to the cullin by an adaptor protein. For instance, the human CRL SCFβ-TrCP is composed of four subunits: the RING protein Rbx1/Roc1/Hrt1, the cullin protein Cul1, the adaptor protein Skp1, and the substrate recruitment factor, β-TrCP. CRL activity is stimulated by covalent modification of a conserved lysine on the cullin subunit with the ubiquitin-like protein Nedd8 (Pan et al., 2004Pan Z.Q. Kentsis A. Dias D.C. Yamoah K. Wu K. Nedd8 on cullin: building an expressway to protein destruction.Oncogene. 2004; 23: 1985-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Nedd8 conjugation causes a massive conformational change in the Cul1–Rbx1 complex that modestly improves the affinity of the E2 enzyme Cdc34 for SCF and brings the active site of E2 into close proximity to a substrate bound to β-TrCP (Duda et al., 2008Duda D.M.

Cul1-based SCF complexes, which are the best-characterized CRLs, can work with different E2s in vitro, but their only genetically-validated E2 partner is Cdc34 (Schwob et al., 1994Schwob E. Bohm T.

The B-type cyclin kinase inhibitor p40SIC1 controls the G1 to S transition in S. cerevisiae.Cell. 1994; 79: 233-244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). Members of the Cdc34 family are distinguished by an extensive C-terminal tail in which at least 50% of the residues are acidic. This tail is essential for Cdc34 function in vivo (Mathias et al., 1998Mathias N. Steussy C.N. Goebl M.G.

Ubiquitylation by Cdc34-SCF is processive and ∼75% of modified substrates acquire a degradation-competent chain with ≥4 ubiquitins in a single encounter with SCF (Saha and Deshaies, 2008Saha A. Deshaies R.J. Multimodal activation of the ubiquitin ligase SCF by Nedd8 conjugation.Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 21-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Although processive ubiquitylation of substrates by Cdc34-SCF is likely to be important for their efficient recognition by the proteasome and subsequent proteolysis, the mechanism by which SCF or any other CRL achieves processivity remains unsolved. Indeed, careful inspection of the biochemical parameters of substrate ubiquitylation by Cdc34-SCF reveals a perplexing conundrum. The interface that E2s employ to bind RING domain E3s also mediates interaction with E1 (Eletr et al., 2005Eletr Z.M. Huang D.T. Duda D.M. Schulman B.A. Kuhlman B. E2 conjugating enzymes must disengage from their E1 enzymes before E3-dependent ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like transfer.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 933-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Thus, a discharged E2 must dissociate from the RING domain to be recharged with ubiquitin. For substrate to acquire a long polyubiquitin chain while bound to SCF, it must stay put through multiple cycles of E2∼Ub-RING association, ubiquitin transfer, and E2 dissociation. However, this seems incompatible with existing biochemical data. For example, a β-Catenin peptide substrate acquires upwards of 10 ubiquitins in the 2-3 s (Saha and Deshaies, 2008Saha A. Deshaies R.J. Multimodal activation of the ubiquitin ligase SCF by Nedd8 conjugation.Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 21-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) it remains bound to SCF even though Cdc34 binds SCF very tightly with an equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of ∼20 nM. Protein-protein interactions that are diffusion-limited typically exhibit on-rates ≤ 106 M-1 sec-1 (Alsallaq and Zhou, 2008Alsallaq R. Zhou H.X. Electrostatic rate enhancement and transient complex of protein-protein association.Proteins. 2008; 71: 320-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, Schreiber et al., 2009Schreiber G. Haran G. Zhou H.X. Fundamental aspects of protein-protein association kinetics.Chem. Rev. 2009; PubMed Google Scholar). If this is the case with Cdc34 binding to Nedd8-conjugated SCF (Saha and Deshaies, 2008Saha A. Deshaies R.J. Multimodal activation of the ubiquitin ligase SCF by Nedd8 conjugation.Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 21-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) the off-rate would equal 0.02 s-1, which would be far too slow to sustain assembly of a ubiquitin chain prior to substrate dissociation. Thus, the following question emerges: how does the Cdc34–SCF complex achieve rapid dynamics of assembly and disassembly while maintaining high affinity? Here, we set out to address how the biophysical properties of the E2–E3 complex contribute to processive ubiquitylation. We uncover an exceptionally dynamic, electrostatically-driven interaction between Cdc34 and SCF that we suggest is fundamental to the operation of all CRLs. The known role of the Cdc34 tail in binding SCF first suggested to us that Cdc34 might transiently dissociate from the RING interface while remaining tethered by tail-SCF interaction, such that multiple cycles of ubiquitin discharge and recharging could occur without Cdc34 ever dissociating fully from SCF. To test this hypothesis, we set out to measure the dynamics of Cdc34-SCF interaction using the Cul1–Rbx1 subcomplex that is responsible for recruiting E2. Using a FRET-based read-out (Saha and Deshaies, 2008Saha A. Deshaies R.J. Multimodal activation of the ubiquitin ligase SCF by Nedd8 conjugation.Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 21-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), we measured a dissociation rate constant (koff) of 35 ± 1 s-1 and a Kd of 7.4 ± 0.7x10−8 M for the Cdc34-RCCFP (Rbx1 plus Cul1-CFP) complex at 50 mM NaCl (Figure 1A). The association rate constant, kon, was estimated from Kd and koff to be 4.7 ± 0.6x108 M-1sec-1 (we were unable to measure directly the rate at which Cdc34 binds RCCFP due to the limit of sensitivity of the FRET assay coupled with the exceptionally fast kon). Kinetic parameters for complex formation between Cdc34 and Nedd8-conjugated RCCFP varied only ∼2-fold regardless of whether or not Cdc34 was charged with ubiquitin (Figures S2A and S2B available online). Moreover, koff varied less than 2-fold, regardless of whether Cdc34 binding was measured with RCCFP heterodimer or SCF holoenzyme (Figure 1A versus S2C). As noted in the Introduction, conjugation of Nedd8 to Cul1 enhances affinity SCF for Cdc34 (Saha and Deshaies, 2008Saha A. Deshaies R.J. Multimodal activation of the ubiquitin ligase SCF by Nedd8 conjugation.Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 21-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), and consistent with this we did see a ∼5 fold decrease in Cdc34 off-rate upon Nedd8 conjugation (Figure 1A versus Figure S2A), but the rate of dissociation from neddylated RCCFP was still faster than the maximal rate of ubiquitin transfer (Saha and Deshaies, 2008Saha A. Deshaies R.J. Multimodal activation of the ubiquitin ligase SCF by Nedd8 conjugation.Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 21-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Thus, the rapid dynamics we observed were not peculiar to a particular assembly or modification state of Cdc34 and SCF. Our observation that the rate of Cdc34 dissociation (35 ± 1 s-1 for unmodified RCCFP and 6 s-1 for neddylated RCCFP) exceeded the maximum rate of ubiquitin-ubiquitin bond formation by Cdc34-SCF (∼2–4 s-1) (Petroski and Deshaies, 2005bPetroski M.D. Deshaies R.J. Mechanism of lysine 48-linked ubiquitin-chain synthesis by the cullin-RING ubiquitin-ligase complex SCF-Cdc34.Cell. 2005; 123: 1107-1120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, Saha and Deshaies, 2008Saha A. Deshaies R.J. Multimodal activation of the ubiquitin ligase SCF by Nedd8 conjugation.Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 21-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) by ∼2-fold was critical in that it invalidated the ‘tail tether’ hypothesis and suggested instead that multiple ubiquitin transfers can occur during the interval of time that substrate is bound to SCF because E2 cycles on and off the complex extremely rapidly. Given that these rapid dynamics enable ubiquitin chain synthesis to occur on the requisite time-scale, we sought to determine their molecular basis. The association kinetics for Cdc34 and RCCFP were faster than is typically seen for proteins that interact via random collision, but such rates have been observed for interacting proteins that pre-align each other through electrostatic interactions, such that a higher than expected fraction of collisions result in productive binding (Sheinerman et al., 2000Sheinerman F.B. Norel R. Honig B. Electrostatic aspects of protein-protein interactions.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Thus, we reasoned that the acidic tail of Cdc34 might mediate the ultra-fast dynamics of Cdc34-RCCFP transactions. Protein-protein interfaces sustained by electrostatic interactions are extremely sensitive to salt, which shields the attractive force between opposite charges (Schreiber and Fersht, 1993Schreiber G. Fersht A.R. Interaction of barnase with its polypeptide inhibitor barstar studied by protein engineering.Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5145-5150Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, Schreiber and Fersht, 1996Schreiber G. Fersht A.R. Rapid, electrostatically assisted association of proteins.Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Consistently, salt had profound effects on both kon and koff for Cdc34-RCCFP. Increasing the ionic strength from 10 mM (Figure 1B) to 100 mM (Figure 1C) resulted in a 470-fold change in Kd, which was driven by a 27-fold increase in koff and estimated 17-fold decrease in kon. Strikingly, even a modest increase in NaCl from 50–100 mM slowed kon by 16-fold (Figures 1A and 1C). Similar results were observed regardless of whether the fluorescent reporter on Cdc34 was appended to the N terminus or C terminus (Figure S3). We next sought to test the contribution of the acidic tail to the function and dynamics of Cdc34-SCF by constructing a mutant, Cdc34-Δ190, that lacked the entire acidic region of Cdc34's tail (see Figure S1 for an alignment of Cdc34 sequences). Both WT and Cdc34-Δ190 were titrated into multiturnover ubiquitylation reactions containing a monoubiquitylated β-Catenin peptide substrate and SCFβ-TrCP complex with the goal of measuring both Km and kcat for these E2s. Note that kcat is defined here in terms of substrate conversion. Thus, a kcat of ∼4 per min means that each enzyme molecule turned over four substrates per minute. Meanwhile, each of those substrates might receive multiple ubiquitins. Thus kcat should not be confused with the rate of ubiquitin transfer. Deletion of the tail resulted in a ∼400-fold increase in Km (Figure 2A and 2B), suggesting a severe defect in SCF binding. While direct binding assays were not possible with Cdc34-Δ190, we were able to measure Ki for the competitive inhibition of WT Cdc34-RCCFP complex formation (Figure 2C). The Ki for Cdc34-Δ190 was similar to the Km, which supports the notion that Cdc34's tail shifts the equilibrium of Cdc34-SCF binding by approximately 2 orders of magnitude. In addition to the binding defect, deletion of the Cdc34 tail resulted in a 10-fold reduction in kcat, possibly by influencing the orientation of the bound Cdc34∼Ub. To evaluate whether the acidic tail of Cdc34 contributed to the unusual dynamics of Cdc34-RC interaction, we generated a partial truncation that was deleted for amino acids 222–238, Δ221, and measured the kinetics of binding to RCCFP. It was essential to use a partial truncation, because complete deletion of the tail destabilized the Cdc34-SCF complex so profoundly that it was not possible to measure the binding parameters directly. At 50 mM NaCl, koff for Cdc34-Δ221 (86 ± 2 s-1) was modestly (∼2.5-fold) faster than WT Cdc34 and estimated kon was ∼10-fold slower (3.9 ± 0.8 × 107 M-1sec-1) (Figure 2D). Taken together, these results provide evidence that electrostatic interactions were important for complex formation and that the acidic tail of Cdc34 promoted rapid association with RCCFP. Given that Cdc34's acidic tail potently enhanced Cd34-SCF interaction, we reasoned that a positively-charged binding site may exist on SCF. To locate candidate docking sites, the electrostatic surface potential of Cul1 was calculated and plotted onto the molecular surface. A broad, positively-charged surface was identified (Figures 3B and 3C), located on a convex feature resembling a canyon (the ‘basic canyon’) underneath Rbx1 in the C-terminal domain (CTD) of Cul1. The activity of human CRLs is significantly increased when the ubiquitin-like protein Nedd8 is conjugated to a conserved lysine in the CTD of the cullin subunit (Pan et al., 2004Pan Z.Q. Kentsis A. Dias D.C. Yamoah K. Wu K. Nedd8 on cullin: building an expressway to protein destruction.Oncogene. 2004; 23: 1985-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The atomic structure of the human Cul5 CTD bound to Rbx1 has been solved in both the unmodified and Nedd8-conjugated state (Duda et al., 2008Duda D.M. Borg L.A. Scott D.C. Hunt H.W. Hammel M. Schulman B.A. Structural insights into NEDD8 activation of cullin-RING ligases: conformational control of conjugation.Cell. 2008; 134: 995-1006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Whereas neddylation results in significant structural rearrangement of both the CTD as well as the relative orientation of Rbx1 with CTD, the positively-charged basic canyon of Cul1 is retained in both of these structures (Figures 3D and 3E). To determine if Cul1's basic canyon can accommodate Cdc34's acidic tail, ab initio modeling of the tail was attempted using a custom protocol written with Rosetta (Das and Baker, 2008Das R. Baker D. Macromolecular modeling with rosetta.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 363-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar) (see Supplemental Materials for details). A docked model for the complex was created from the Cdc34 catalytic domain positioned on Rbx1-Cul1 CTD (modeled from the UbcH7-Cbl crystal structure (Zheng et al., 2000Zheng N. Wang P. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Structure of a c-Cbl-UbcH7 complex: RING domain function in ubiquitin-protein ligases.Cell. 2000; 102: 533-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar)). In silico analysis of the Cdc34 tail revealed little preference for secondary structure (Cole et al., 2008Cole C. Barber J.D. Barton G.J. The Jpred 3 secondary structure prediction server.Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: W197-W201Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar), which is consistent with the lack of alpha helical structure detectable by circular dichroism (Ptak et al., 1994Ptak C. Prendergast J.A. Hodgins R. Kay C.M. Chau V. Ellison M.J. Functional and physical characterization of the cell cycle ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme CDC34 (UBC3). Identification of a functional determinant within the tail that facilitates CDC34 self-association.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26539-26545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we allowed the tail to find its lowest energy configuration without imposing constraints on secondary structure. Some 16 of the 20 models with the lowest binding interaction energy between Cdc34 and CTD-Rbx1 had the acidic tail of Cdc34 nestled into the basic canyon of Cul1 (Figures 4A and 4B). This result is highly significant given that no additional information was used during the simulations to guide the tail to the canyon. These results indicate that the tail can reach the basic canyon and does so in low-energy conformations. Simulations with the Cdc34 tail and neddylated Cul5 CTD also resulted in a tremendous enrichment for models in which the tail fits snugly into the basic canyon (Figure S4a,b). Whereas no two top-scoring models were identical, the molecular interfaces consistently buried the same residues in proximity to each other. For instance, Cα of Cys 227 of Cdc34 was within 18 Å of Cα of Lys 679 of Cul1 in 9 of the top 20 models, an enrichment of 90-fold compared to all 28,574 models generated (Figure 4C). To probe the predictive value of our model, we performed in vitro disulfide crosslinking experiments. Since modeling suggested that Cys 227 of Cdc34 was close to Lys 679 of Cul1, Lys 679 was mutated to cysteine and the mutant protein was mixed with WT Cdc34 in the presence of an oxidizing reagent. A crosslinked species between Cdc34 and Cul1-K679C CTD (note that Cul1 was expressed in E. coli as two separate fragments, the N-terminal domain (NTD) and CTD, as previously described (Li et al., 2005Li T. Pavletich N.P. Schulman B.A. Zheng N. High-level expression and purification of recombinant SCF ubiquitin ligases.Methods Enzymol. 2005; 398: 125-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar)) formed that migrated at the predicted MW and reacted with Cul1 and Cdc34 antibodies (Figure 4D). The crosslinked product was dependent on both the K679C substitution and Cys 227 of Cdc34, as no product formed when WT Cul1 or Cdc34-C227S were used, despite the fact that two cysteine residues including the solvent-exposed active site one remained in the Cdc34-C227S protein. Thus, as predicted by Rosetta, Cdc34's acidic tail can occupy Cul1's basic canyon. To probe further the functional significance of this interaction, we sought to generate a mutant Cul1 that cannot accommodate the acidic tail. Framing the basic canyon are two clusters of closely apposed basic residues that we refer to as the ‘KR claw’ (Figure 3A, arrows). The conserved (see below) lysine residues 431, 432 and 435 form one side of the pincer and Lys 678, Lys 679 and Arg 681 comprise the other. To evaluate the functional role of the KR claw, double and triple mutants lacking various combinations of its residues were constructed. One mutant (K678E, K679E, and R681E, referred to as ‘KKR’) assembled properly but was profoundly defective in multiturnover ubiquitylation reactions. Strikingly, the Km of WT Cdc34 for KKR SCF was nearly 10 μM (Figure 5A), which is consistent with the idea that the KKR mutation disrupts recruitment of Cdc34 to SCF. If the KKR mutation in SCF is truly specific to the acidic tail of Cdc34, KKR SCF should be comparable in activity to WT SCF when assayed with E2s that do not contain acidic tails. UbcH5c, an E2 lacking an acidic tail yet commonly assayed with mammalian SCF, yielded similar kcat/Km values when assayed with WT or KKR-SCF (Figure 5B). Similarly, Cdc34-Δ190 exhibited identical kcat/Km values with WT and KKR-SCF (Figure 5C). As a final control, KKR SCF did not abolish the stimulatory effect of Nedd8 conjugation, further demonstrating the specificity of this mutant (Figure S5). The major contribution of basic residues in the KR claw to Cdc34 recruitment inspired us to explore more deeply the conservation of this region. A multiple sequence alignment (Figure S6) reveals that the basic residues comprising the KR claw are conserved in Cul1 orthologs from yeast to humans, as well as in human Cul2-Cul5. More generally, the molecular surface of the KR claw is highly conserved in Cul1 orthologs and homologs (yellow regions in Figure 4E), pointing to a general role for this landmark in CRL function. Interestingly, the KR claw is conserved in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, which does not have a detectable Cdc34 ortholog. Thus, multiple SCF cofactors may converge on this striking surface feature. The exceptional dynamics of Cdc34-SCF interaction that are afforded by the electrostatic and structural complementarity of Cdc34's acidic tail and Cul1's basic canyon may enable rapid cycles of Cdc34 recruitment during polyubiquitin chain synthesis. To address this hypothesis, we performed ‘single encounter’ reactions at physiological salt concentration with the yeast CRL SCFCdc4 and a phospho-peptide substrate derived from the human cyclin E1 protein (see methods) (Nash et al., 2001Nash P. Tang X. Orlicky S. Chen Q. Gertler F.B. Mendenhall M.D. Sicheri F. Pawson T. Tyers M.

Structural basis for phosphodependent substrate selection and orientation by the SCFCdc4 ubiquitin ligase.Cell. 2003; 112: 243-256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Two yeast Cdc34 derivatives that either retain (Δ230) or lack (Δ210) the acidic region of the tail were tested for processive ubiquitylation of the peptide substrate. A single encounter experiment measures the ubiquitin transfer that occurs before labeled substrate dissociates and is replaced by unlabeled competitor. Whereas Cdc34-Δ230 sustained conversion of a substantial amount of substrate into highly ubiquitylated product, Cdc34-Δ210 activity was significantly perturbed in that little substrate was converted to products containing 4 or more ubiquitins (Figure 5D). Chain synthesis was not rescued by increasing Cdc34-Δ210 to 100 μM, indicating that in addition to promoting rapid binding, the acidic tail influenced the rate of ubiquitin transfer within the substrate-SCF-Cdc34∼Ub complex. Ubiquitin ligases that target substrates for degradation by the proteasome have a challenging job. In the specific cases of β-TrCP binding to β-Catenin substrate peptide and Cdc4 binding to cyclin E substrate peptide, the substrates bind with Kd values of 0.1–1.0 μM and dissociate with off-rates between ∼0.1–1 s-1 (Saha and Deshaies, 2008Saha A. Deshaies R.J. Multimodal activation of the ubiquitin ligase SCF by Nedd8 conjugation.Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 21-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar; unpublished data). These off-rates must strike a balance between being sufficiently slow to allow for ubiquitin chain assembly, but sufficiently fast that the ligase does not become product-inhibited. In the limited time-frame that a substrate is engaged, it must be conjugated with at least four ubiquitins to serve as a competent ligand for the proteasome (Thrower et al., 2000Thrower J.S. Hoffman L. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C.M. Recognition of the polyubiquitin proteolytic signal.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1248) Google Scholar). If a substrate were to dissociate before receiving four ubiquitins, it would run the risk of being ‘edited’ by isopeptidases (Lam et al., 1997Lam Y.A. Xu W. DeMartino G.N. Cohen R.E. Editing of ubiquitin conjugates by an isopeptidase in the 26S proteasome.Nature. 1997; 385: 737-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar) or interacting, prematurely, with the multitude of ubiquitin-binding proteins in the cell that govern non-proteolytic functions of ubiquitin (Kirkin and Dikic, 2007Kirkin V. Dikic I. Role of ubiquitin- and Ubl-binding proteins in cell signaling.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2007; 19: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Given that E2s employ overlapping surfaces to bind RING domains and E1 (Eletr et al., 2005Eletr Z.M. Huang D.T. Duda D.M. Schulman B.A. Kuhlman B. E2 conjugating enzymes must disengage from their E1 enzymes before E3-dependent ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like transfer.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 933-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), the E2-RING interface must form four times and dissociate three times in the course of assembly of a minimal tetraubiquitin signal on a bound substrate. Our data indicate that an electrostatically-driven interaction between the acidic tail of Cdc34 and a basic surface on Cul1 makes it possible for Cdc34-SCF complexes to form with high affinity yet cycle with exceptionally rapid kinetics. It is possible that a small fraction of successive ubiquitin transfer events are mediated by a single molecule of Cdc34 that is recharg"
https://openalex.org/W2065625201,"Neural progenitors generate distinct cell types at different stages, but the mechanisms controlling these temporal transitions are poorly understood. In the Drosophila CNS, a cascade of transcription factors, the ""temporal gene cascade,"" has been identified that acts to alter progenitor competence over time. However, many CNS lineages display broad temporal windows, and it is unclear how broad windows progress into subwindows that generate unique cell types. We have addressed this issue in an identifiable Drosophila CNS lineage and find that a broad castor temporal window is subdivided by two different feed-forward loops, both of which are triggered by castor itself. The first loop acts to specify a unique cell fate, whereas the second loop suppresses the first loop, thereby allowing for the generation of alternate cell fates. This mechanism of temporal and ""subtemporal"" genes acting in opposing feed-forward loops may be used by many stem cell lineages to generate diversity."

https://openalex.org/W1981299032,"Visual information from a speaker's face can enhance or interfere with accurate auditory perception. This integration of information across auditory and visual streams has been observed in functional imaging studies, and has typically been attributed to the frequency and robustness with which perceivers jointly encounter event-specific information from these two modalities. Adding the tactile modality has long been considered a crucial next step in understanding multisensory integration. However, previous studies have found an influence of tactile input on speech perception only under limited circumstances, either where perceivers were aware of the task or where they had received training to establish a cross-modal mapping. Here we show that perceivers integrate naturalistic tactile information during auditory speech perception without previous training. Drawing on the observation that some speech sounds produce tiny bursts of aspiration (such as English 'p'), we applied slight, inaudible air puffs on participants' skin at one of two locations: the right hand or the neck. Syllables heard simultaneously with cutaneous air puffs were more likely to be heard as aspirated (for example, causing participants to mishear 'b' as 'p'). These results demonstrate that perceivers integrate event-relevant tactile information in auditory perception in much the same way as they do visual information."

https://openalex.org/W2091790540,"The globular star clusters that orbit the Milky Way are regarded as the best approximations we have of stellar populations of uniform age and identical composition, recording stellar evolution since the birth of our Galaxy. The most luminous of these clusters though, ω Centauri, has long been recognized as an exception to this trend, containing multiple stellar populations with a significant spread in iron abundance and ages. Two groups report the discovery of further global clusters with mixed populations. Lee et al. confirm the suspicion that the massive global cluster M22 contains distinct multiple populations with different calcium abundances, as do several other clusters in their sample. Ferraro et al. report that Terzan 5, a globular cluster-like system in the Galactic bulge, has two populations with different iron content and ages. These findings suggest that ω Cen, M22, Terzan 5 and other similar clusters are the relics of dwarf galaxies and other primordial bodies that merged to eventually form the Milky Way. The globular star clusters ω Centauri and M 22 are thought to be the remaining cores of disrupted dwarf galaxies, but they are viewed as exceptional. Here, calcium abundances for seven globular clusters are reported and compared to ω Centauri. The results lead the authors to conclude that these globular clusters are also probably the relics of more massive primeval dwarf galaxies that merged and disrupted to form the proto-Galaxy. The most massive globular cluster in the Milky Way, ω Centauri, is thought to be the remaining core of a disrupted dwarf galaxy1,2, as expected within the model of hierarchical merging3,4. It contains several stellar populations having different heavy elemental abundances supplied by supernovae5—a process known as metal enrichment. Although M 22 appears to be similar to ω Cen6, other peculiar globular clusters do not7,8. Therefore ω Cen and M 22 are viewed as exceptional, and the presence of chemical inhomogeneities in other clusters is seen as ‘pollution’ from the intermediate-mass asymptotic-giant-branch stars expected in normal globular clusters9. Here we report Ca abundances for seven globular clusters and compare them to ω Cen. Calcium and other heavy elements can only be supplied through numerous supernovae explosions of massive stars in these stellar systems10, but the gravitational potentials of the present-day clusters cannot preserve most of the ejecta from such explosions11. We conclude that these globular clusters, like ω Cen, are most probably the relics of more massive primeval dwarf galaxies that merged and disrupted to form the proto-Galaxy."

In this study we confirm that cordycepin reduces the length of poly(A) tails, with some mRNAs being much more sensitive than others. The low doses of cordycepin that cause poly(A) changes also reduce the proliferation of NIH3T3 fibroblasts. At higher doses of the drug we observed inhibition of cell attachment and a reduction of focal adhesions. Furthermore, we observed a strong inhibition of total protein synthesis that correlates with an inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, as observed by reductions in Akt kinase and 4E-binding protein (4EBP) phosphorylation. In 4EBP knock-out cells, the effect of cordycepin on translation is strongly reduced, confirming the role of this modification. In addition, the AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) was shown to be activated. Inhibition of AMPK prevented translation repression by cordycepin and abolished 4EBP1 dephosphorylation, indicating that the effect of cordycepin on mTOR signaling and protein synthesis is mediated by AMPK activation. We conclude that many of the reported biological effects of cordycepin are likely to be due to its effects on mTOR and AMPK signaling. 3′-Deoxyadenosine, also known as cordycepin, is a known polyadenylation inhibitor with a large spectrum of biological activities, including anti-proliferative, pro-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects.

https://openalex.org/W1995169990,"Transcription in human mitochondria is carried out by a single-subunit, T7-like RNA polymerase assisted by several auxiliary factors. We demonstrate that an essential initiation factor, TFB2, forms a network of interactions with DNA near the transcription start site and facilitates promoter melting but may not be essential for promoter recognition. Unexpectedly, catalytic autolabeling reveals that TFB2 interacts with the priming substrate, suggesting that TFB2 acts as a transient component of the catalytic site of the initiation complex. Mapping of TFB2 identifies a region of its N-terminal domain that is involved in simultaneous interactions with the priming substrate and the templating (+1) DNA base. Our data indicate that the transcriptional machinery in human mitochondria has evolved into a system that combines features inherited from self-sufficient, T7-like RNA polymerase and those typically found in systems comprising cellular multi-subunit polymerases, and provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of transcription regulation in mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W2038253485,"Although DNA methylation is critical for proper embryonic and tissue-specific development, how different DNA methyltransferases affect tissue-specific development and their targets remains unknown. We address this issue in zebrafish through antisense-based morpholino knockdown of Dnmt3 and Dnmt1. Our data reveal that Dnmt3 is required for proper neurogenesis, and its absence results in profound defects in brain and retina. Interestingly, other organs such as intestine remain unaffected suggesting tissue-specific requirements of Dnmt3. Further, comparison of Dnmt1 knockdown phenotypes with those of Dnmt3 suggested that these two families have distinct functions. Consistent with this idea, Dnmt1 failed to complement Dnmt3 deficiency, and Dnmt3 failed to complement Dnmt1 deficiency. Downstream of Dnmt3 we identify a neurogenesis regulator, lef1, as a Dnmt3-specific target gene that is demethylated and up-regulated in dnmt3 morphants. Knockdown of lef1 rescued neurogenesis defects resulting from Dnmt3 absence. Mechanistically, we show cooperation between Dnmt3 and an H3K9 methyltransferase G9a in regulating lef1. Further, like Dnmt1-Suv39h1 cooperativity, Dnmt3 and G9a seemed to function together for tissue-specific development. G9a knockdown, but not Suv39h1 loss, phenocopied dnmt3 morphants and G9a overexpression provided a striking rescue of dnmt3 morphant phenotypes, whereas Suv39h1 overexpression failed, supporting the notion of specific DNMT-histone methyltransferase networks. Consistent with this model, H3K9me3 levels on the lef1 promoter were reduced in both dnmt3 and g9a morphants, and its knockdown rescued neurogenesis defects in g9a morphants. We propose a model wherein specific DNMT-histone methyltransferase networks are utilized to silence critical regulators of cell fate in a tissue-specific manner."

Sumibcay L. Hinnebusch A.G. Swanson M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6871-6886Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Consistent with these in vivo findings, purified mutant holoenzymes lacking Gal11, Pgd1, or Med2 are impaired for transcriptional activation by Gal4, VP16, and Gcn4 and fail to bind these activators in vitro (4Lee Y.C.

Interestingly, Gal11 was the only Mediator subunit that photo-cross-linked to Gcn4 or Gal4 in preinitiation complexes reconstituted with these activators in vitro (32Fishburn J. Mohibullah N. Hahn S. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 369-378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Park et al. (31Park J.M. Kim H.S. Han S.J. Hwang M.S. Lee Y.C. Kim Y.J. Mol. Cell.

However, it was not determined whether the Gal11 segments that bind Gcn4 in vitro are important for transcriptional activation or recruitment of Mediator by Gcn4 in vivo. Thus, the physiological relevance of these Gcn4-binding domains in Gal11 was unclear (31Park J.M. Kim H.S. Han S.J. Hwang M.S. Lee Y.C. Kim Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8709-8719Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Interestingly, an N-terminal Gal11 segment (amino acids (aa) 116–255), shown previously to bind Gal4, Gcn4, and the VP16 activation domain in vitro (31Park J.M. Kim H.S. Han S.J. Hwang M.S. Lee Y.C. Kim Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8709-8719Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), likewise binds a portion of the activation domain of mammalian glucocorticoid receptor (GR) dubbed τ1c. Indeed, Gal11 was the sole Mediator subunit that cross-linked to τ1c in vitro. A sequence motif (B-box) in the aa interval 116–255 of Gal11 is conserved in mammalian coactivator SRC-1 and crucial for the function of Gal11 in transcriptional activation by τ1c in yeast. Several regions in Gal11 are additionally required to support the function of an activation domain from the mammalian androgen receptor in yeast (33Kim D.H. Kim G.S. Yun C.H. Lee Y.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 913-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, a different region of Gal11 is the key target of yeast activators Pdr1 and Oaf1. The solution structures of the extreme N-terminal regions of Gal11 and its mammalian homolog (ARC105) are similar to the activator-binding “KIX” domain of mammalian coactivator CREB-binding protein/p300 (34Yang F. Vought B.W. Satterlee J.S. Walker A.K. Jim Sun Z.Y. Watts J.L. DeBeaumont R. Saito R.M. Hyberts S.G. Yang S. Macol C. Iyer L. Tjian R. van den Heuvel S. Hart A.C. Wagner G. Näär A.M.

The ARC105 and Gal11 KIX domains interact in vitro with the activation domains of mammalian sterol regulatory element-binding protein and yeast Pdr1, although the KIX surfaces differ somewhat for these interactions. Deletion of only the KIX domain of Gal11 nearly abolishes transcriptional activation by Pdr1 and is predicted to impair Mediator recruitment by Pdr1 in vivo. Similar findings were reported for yeast activator Oaf1 (34Yang F. Vought B.W. Satterlee J.S. Walker A.K. Jim Sun Z.Y. Watts J.L. DeBeaumont R. Saito R.M. Hyberts S.G. Yang S. Macol C. Iyer L.

It is striking that the KIX domain is crucial for activation by Pdr1 and Oaf1 but dispensable for the Gal4 activation domain in a lexA fusion (37Lu Z. Ansari A.Z. Lu X. Ogirala A. Ptashne M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 8591-8596Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and makes only a small contribution to activation by native Gal4. Moreover, it was reported that neither Gal4, Gcn4, nor VP16 bound stably to the Gal11 KIX domain in vitro (31Park J.M. Kim H.S. Han S.J. Hwang M.S. Lee Y.C. Kim Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8709-8719Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In this study, we sought to define the domains in Gal11 required for recruitment of Mediator by Gcn4 in living cells. Our results indicate that Gcn4 uses a combination of at least three non-contiguous segments in the N-terminal approximately one-third of Gal11, including the KIX domain, to recruit Mediator in vivo. We show that eliminating the KIX domain in combination with one of the other Gcn4-binding regions in Gal11 is required to evoke strong reductions in Gcn4 binding to Mediator tail subcomplex in extracts, in recruitment of the tail subcomplex (or intact Mediator) in vivo, and in transcriptional activation by Gcn4. We also provide evidence that Gcn4 can bind directly to the KIX domain and identify the likely binding surface for Gcn4 by NMR and mutational analysis. Thus, in contrast to certain other activators that primarily target a single region in Gal11, Gcn4 employs a highly redundant set of interactions with different regions of Gal11 for efficient Mediator recruitment in vivo. All strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. Strain HQY1037 was generated from gal11Δ::kanMX4 strain 1742 by a two-step gene replacement of ARG1 with PARG1-HIS3, creating the arg1-Δ::PARG1-HIS3 allele in which the ARG1 ORF is replaced by a fusion between the N-terminal 62 codons of ARG1 and the entire HIS3 ORF, using integrative URA3 plasmid pHQ1459 digested at the unique Eco47III site upstream of ARG1.

The insertions were confirmed by PCR analysis of chromosomal DNA and Western blot analysis of whole-cell extracts (WCEs) using anti-HA antibodies. Plasmid pHQ1459 was constructed in two steps. First, an EcoRI-BamHI PCR fragment containing 734 bp of 5′-non-coding DNA and the first 62 codons of ARG1 was amplified using primers 1094 (5′-CGCGAATTCTTTCCTGTTGCCTCTTTTTC-3′) and 1095 (5′-CGGGGATCCACACAAACGAACTTGCA-3′). A second, BamHI-XbaI PCR fragment containing 737 bp of ARG1 3′-non-coding sequences was amplified using primers 1100 (5′-CGGGGATCCCGCGAGCTCTAAGTCCGCTAGTTCATCGC-3′) and 1097 (5′- CGCTCTAGATGTGAATTCATGGTTAACG-3′). Both fragments were inserted between the EcoRI/XbaI sites of YIplac211 (40Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene. 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2522) Google Scholar) to produce pHQ1457. A BamHI-EcoRV PCR fragment containing the entire HIS3 ORF was amplified using primers 1098 (5′-CGCGGATCCCATGACAGAGCAGAAAGCCCT-3′) and 1099 (5′-CGCGATATCACATAAGAACACCTTTGGTGG-3′) and between the BamHI/Ecl136II sites of pHQ1457 to produce pHQ1459. Plasmids containing GAL11 deletion alleles are listed in Table 2 along with the primers used in constructing them by PCR fusion. All such deletions except Δ9 to Δ12 were constructed using as template the single copy URA3 plasmid pMJS15, containing wild-type myc-GAL11 with the native GAL11 promoter and ADH1 transcription terminator. For Δ9 to Δ12, the template was a derivative of pMJS15, pIJB25, with the NsiI site in URA3 eliminated to render the NsiI site in GAL11 unique. In the first stage of PCR fusion, two fragments were amplified with the primer pairs 1 and 2 and 3 and 4, respectively, listed in Table 2. These fragments were then used in 1:1 ratio as templates for a second amplification using primer pairs 1 and 4. For Δ1 to Δ3, the resulting fragments were cloned between the Asp-718 and PflMI sites of pMJS15; for Δ4 to Δ8, they were cloned between the BsaAI and PflMI sites of pMJS15; for Δ9 to Δ12, they were cloned between the BsaAI and NsiI sites of pMJS15; for Δ13 to Δ17, they were cloned between the PflMI and BamHI sites of pMJS15; and for Δ18, they were cloned between the PflMI and SalI sites of pMJS15. For all single deletions, the BspEI restriction site (encoding Ser-Gly) was inserted at the deletion junction. Alleles containing combinations of deletions were constructed as follows, and the primer pairs used are listed in Table 2. pIJB19, containing Δ1Δ2, was generated by PCR fusion using pMJS15 as template, inserting a BspEI site at the Δ1Δ2 deletion junction, and the resulting PCR fragment was cloned between the Asp-718 and PflMI sites of pMJS15. pIJB20 (Δ1Δ2Δ5) was generated by PCR fusion using pIJB19 (Δ1Δ2) as template, inserting an AgeI restriction site (encoding Thr-Gly) at the Δ5 deletion junction; the final PCR fragment was cloned between the Asp-718 and PflMI sites of pMJS15. pIJB21 (Δ1Δ2Δ8) was generated by PCR fusion using pIJB19 as template and inserting an AgeI site at the Δ8 deletion junction. The final PCR fragment was cloned between the Asp-718 and PflMI sites of pMJS15. pIJB22 (Δ1Δ2Δ14) was generated by PCR fusion using pIJB14 as template and inserting an BspEI site at the Δ1Δ2 deletion junction. The final PCR fragment was cloned between the Asp-718 and PflMI sites of pIJB14. pIJB23 (Δ5Δ8) was generated by PCR fusion using pIJB8 as the template and inserting an AgeI site at the Δ5 deletion junction. The final PCR fragment was cloned between Asp-718 and PflMI sites of pMJS15. pIJB24 (Δ8Δ14) was generated using pIJB14 as the template and inserting a BspEI site at the Δ8 deletion junction. The PCR fragment was cloned between BsaAI and PflMI sites of pIJB14. The subcloned fragments of all deletion constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing.TABLE 2Plasmids containing GAL11 deletion alleles and primers used in their construction by fusion PCR mutagenesisView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab Plasmids p4913 and p4914, harboring the B-box mutation WQV, were constructed by PCR fusion using pMJS15 (wild type (WT)) or pIJB19 (Δ1Δ2) as templates, respectively, and the following four primers: FZP277, 5′-GAATTCGAGCTCGGTACCCAAC-3′; FZP278, 5′-ACATCCTTTGCAGTAGGTGTCAAC-3′; FZP279, 5′-AACATTCCACCCAATATCAACACCGCTCAGGCTGCTACTGCTTTGGCTCAACAAAAGCTA-3′; FZP280, 5′-TAGCTTTTGTTGAGCCAAAGCAGTAGCAGCCTGAGCGGTGTTGATATTGGGTGGAATGTT-3′. The final PCR fragments were inserted between the KpnI and PflMI sites of pMJS15. Plasmid pHQ1857 harboring the Ala6 substitution in the KIX domain was constructed as follows. Two PCR fragments were amplified from genomic DNA with the following pairs of primers 1617/1618 and 1619/1620: primer 1617, 5′-GAGCTCGGTACCCAACGGAGCATCAAACATGAC-3′; primer 1618, 5′-CAGCGTCTGCAGCCCCTCCGTTCAGAGTGGCAATGTCCGCGAGCACCTGAAGCAACCCGT-3′; primer 1619, 5′-GAGGGGCTGCAGACGCTGCTGCTAAGATAAGAATTCATGCCAAAA-3′; and primer 1620, 5′-CCTCGTATTGTACGTGTTGCG-3′. The fragment obtained with primers 1617/1618 was digested with Asp-718 and PstI to produce a fragment containing 695 bp of 5′-non-coding region and codons 1–39 of GAL11 with mutations that substitute Ala codons for Met-29, Asn-32, Ser-38, and Ser-39. The fragment obtained with primers 1619/1620 was cut with PstI and BsaAI to produce a fragment containing codons 38–81 with Ala substitutions of Ser-38, Ser-39, Thr-41, and Asp-43, with the S38A and S39A substitutions creating a unique PstI site. The two final fragments were ligated with the Asp-718-BsaAI fragment from pMJS15 to produce pHQ1857. pHQ1858, harboring the Ala4 substitution, was constructed as pHQ1857 except that the PCR fragments do not encode the N32A and T41A substitutions and were made using primer 1621 (5′-CAGTGTCTGCAGCCCCTCCGTTCAGAGTGTTAATGTCCGCGAGCACCTGAAGCAACCCGT-3′) instead of 1618 and primer 1622 (5′-GAGGGGCTGCAGACACTGCTGCTAAGATAAGAATTCATGCCAAAA-3′) instead of 1619. Plasmids used for in vitro translation of Gal11 polypeptides are listed in Table 3 with the primers used in constructing them. All of the PCR fragments amplified using the indicated primers were cloned between the XhoI and XbaI sites of pTNT (Promega).TABLE 3Plasmids for in vitro translation of Gal11 fragments and primers used in their construction Open table in a new tab The primers in Table 4 were used to construct the plasmids for expression in Escherichia coli of the Gal11 KIX domain (residues 2–100), full-length Gcn4, and Gcn4 activation domain (aa 2–151), with each protein containing an N-terminal His6 tag and a TEV protease cleavage site (ENLYFQS). The resulting PCR products were cloned between the NdeI and XhoI sites of pET-28a (Novagen).

https://openalex.org/W2038641853,"Angiotensin II (Ang II) is a pleuripotential hormone that is important in the pathophysiology of multiple conditions including aging, cardiovascular and renal diseases, and insulin resistance. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are important mediators of Ang II-induced signaling generally and have a well defined role in vascular hypertrophy, which is inhibited by overexpression of catalase, inferring a specific role of H2O2. The molecular mechanisms are understood incompletely. The transcriptional coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) is a key regulator of energy metabolism and ROS-scavenging enzymes including catalase. We show that Ang II stimulates Akt-dependent PGC-1α serine 570 phosphorylation, which is required for the binding of the histone acetyltransferase GCN5 (general control nonderepressible 5) to PGC-1α and for its lysine acetylation. These sequential post-translational modifications suppress PGC-1α activity and prevent its binding to the catalase promoter through the forkhead box O1 transcription factor, thus decreasing catalase expression. We demonstrate that overexpression of the phosphorylation-defective mutant PGC-1α (S570A) prevents Ang II-induced increases in H2O2 levels and hypertrophy ([3H]leucine incorporation). Knockdown of PGC-1α by small interfering RNA promotes basal and Ang II-stimulated ROS and hypertrophy, which is reversed by polyethylene glycol-conjugated catalase. Thus, endogenous PGC-1α is a negative regulator of vascular hypertrophy by up-regulating catalase expression and thus reducing ROS levels. We provide novel mechanistic insights by which Ang II may mediate its ROS-dependent pathophysiologic effects on multiple cardiometabolic diseases.

Ang II is a pleuripotential hormone and a potent mediator of arterial hypertrophy, a hallmark of vascular wall remodeling in hypertension and of metabolic diseases such as type II diabetes and atherosclerosis (5Ferrario C.M.

Alexander R.W. Hypertension. 1997; 29: 366-373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Many growth-related outputs of the AT1 receptor including hypertrophy are dependent upon the production of ROS, particularly H2O2, because overexpression of catalase, a scavenger of H2O2, inhibits Ang II-induced vascular hypertrophy in vitro and in vivo (8Ushio-Fukai M.

Ang II also stimulates sustained increases in ROS levels for 48–72 h that are associated with vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) hypertrophy (12Laplante M.A. Wu R. Moreau P. de Champlain J.

ROS levels could be increased either (or both) by promoting generating capacity or/and by decreasing levels of scavenging enzymes, such as catalase. In cardiomyocytes, Ang II- and insulin-stimulated hypertrophy is ROS-dependent and is associated with down-regulation of catalase expression (14Murtaza I. Wang H.X. Feng X. Alenina N. Bader M.

There is incomplete understanding of the mechanisms involved. Post-translational modifications regulate the function and activity of PGC-1α at multiple levels. For example, transcriptional regulation of gluconeogenesis and fatty acid oxidation are suppressed by PGC-1α Ser570 phosphorylation by Akt, thus inhibiting PGC-1α recruitment to its cognate promoters (34Li X.

Further, lysine acetylation of PGC-1α by the histone acetyltransferase GCN5 (general control nonderepressible 5) decreases PGC-1α activity to control glucose metabolism (36Lerin C. Rodgers J.T.

Moreover, PGC-1α deacetylation by SIRT1 (silent mating type information regulation two homolog 1) promotes PGC-1α activity (37Nemoto S. Fergusson M.M. Finkel T. J. Biol.

Nature. 2005; 434: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (2542) Google Scholar). The mechanistic inter-relationships among these post-translational modifications are incompletely understood. We hypothesize that PGC-1α might be an important regulator of Ang II-induced vascular hypertrophy through a mechanism that depends on post-translational modifications of PGC-1α. We previously reported that Ang II-induced activation of Akt is mediated through rapidly induced increases in intracellular H2O2 (8Ushio-Fukai M. Alexander R.W. Akers M. Griendling K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15022-15029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Here we show that Ang II stimulation inhibits transcriptional activities of PGC-1α via Akt-mediated phosphorylation at Ser570. This phosphorylation is required for the binding of GCN5 to and the subsequent lysine acetylation of PGC-1α. These sequential events result in disruption of the PGC-1α·FoxO1 complex binding to the FoxO1 response element of the catalase promoter, thereby down-regulating catalase expression and increasing ROS levels and hypertrophy in VSMCs. These findings extend understanding of the functional consequences of Akt-mediated PGC-1α serine 570 phosphorylation by revealing its enabling role in GCN5-mediated lysine acetylation. These findings provide insights into a novel mechanism by which Ang II may mediate its disparate maladaptive pathophysiologic and metabolic functions through interactive post-translational modifications of PGC-1α.

For experiments, the cells between passages 6 and 15 were used at confluence. VSMCs were growth-arrested for 24 h prior to treatment with 100 nm Ang II.

The nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts from VSMCs were prepared using a nuclear/cytosol fractionation kit (K266-100) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Equal amounts of total cell lysates, nuclear extracts, or cytoplasmic extracts were subjected to immunoblotting. The separation between the nuclear and cytosolic fractions was verified by blotting for nuclear protein histone H1 and cytosolic protein tubulin. VSMCs were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. The lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with appropriate antibodies. For immunoprecipitation, growth-arrested VSMCs were stimulated with Ang II at 37 °C, and 100–500 μg of nuclear extracts were immunoprecipitated with PGC-1α antibodies and protein A/G Plus-agarose beads (Santa Cruz). The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and incubated overnight with indicated antibodies. After incubation with secondary antibodies, the proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. ChIP assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.). VSMCs were grown to 60–80% confluence in DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum. Thereafter, the cells were starved for 24 h. Following treatment with 100 nm Ang II for the indicated times, the cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde at 37 °C for 10 min, lysed, and sonicated. Soluble chromatin was coimmunoprecipitated with anti-PGC-1α or anti-FKHR/FoxO1 antiserum or an equal amount of control rabbit IgG. The cells at ∼80% confluency grown in one 10-cm diameter dish were used per immunoprecipitation. After de-cross-linking of the DNAs, DNA purified from starting (1% input) and immunoprecipitated samples was subjected to PCR using the following primers: catalase FoxO1-DBE (−2160 to −1938), 5′-GGCTTCTGTTTGCCTTGCTCAG-3′ and 5′-ATACTGATACTGCGATTGTTAAGCG-3′. The region of amplification contains FoxO1-dependent binding element (FoxO1-DBE) in catalase promoter (NC_005102.2). Standard PCRs were performed. The GAPDH promoter was analyzed by ChIP in parallel as a control. The relative ChIP units were calculated by the ratio of ChIP DNA to input DNA using densitometry. Cells in 12-well plates were cotransfected with the Gal4-responsive reporter construct (100 ng), expression vector encoding Gal4-PGC-1α (400 ng), the empty vector (pm, 400 ng), and the internal control p-RL-TK vector (50 ng) using the Basic Nucleofector® Amaxa transfection kit (Biosystems). When necessary, inhibitors were added for 30 min prior to Ang II stimulation. Various doses of Ang II were added to cells for another 16 h. The cells were harvested, and luciferase activity was determined using a dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The relative activity was calculated as the ratio of firefly luciferase activity to Renilla luciferase activity (internal control). The data from three independent experiments (each performed in triplicate) are shown as the averages ± the standard error of the mean. Total RNA was extracted from VSMCs using TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen) and treated with DNase I according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The concentration and purity of RNA were determined by spectrophotometer at 260 and 280 nm. RT-PCR amplification was performed using a SuperScriptTM one-step RT-PCR system with Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). One microgram of total RNA was used as a template for subsequent RT and PCRs. The cDNA was amplified with the following PCR primers: sense 5′-GTGGTTTTCACCGACGAGAT-3′ and antisense 5′-CATGTCAGGGTCCTTCAGGT-3′ for rat catalase (NP_036652); sense 5′-AAACTTGCTAGCGGTCCTCA-3′ and antisense 5′-ACGTCTTTGTGGCTTTTGCT-3′ for rat PGC-1α (NP_112637); and sense 5′-GGTGATGCTGGTGCTGAGTA-3′ and antisense 5′- ACTGTGGTCATGAGCCCTTC-3′ for rat GAPDH (NM_ 017008). GAPDH served as an internal control of the reaction. The PCR cycling protocol consisted of 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 2 min, annealing at 54 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min, followed by final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 1.8% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide. Half-lives of catalase mRNA in VSMCs with or without Ang II pretreatment were calculated by linear regression analysis of the rate of catalase mRNA decay as a function of time after actinomycin D (5 μg/ml) administration. Total RNA was isolated from the cells at the times indicated, and the mRNA levels of catalase and housekeeping gene-GAPDH were semi-quantified by RT-PCR. The normalized mean data from four separate experiments were plotted on logarithmic scales using GraphPad Prism. The half-lives were calculated as the time required for each mRNA decreasing to 50% of its initial abundance. Sequences of custom siRNA duplex for rat FoxO1 (Applied Biosystem; Ambion) were as follows: sense 5′-CUGUGCGCCUGGACUCUUG(dTdT)-3′ and antisense 5′-CAAGAGUCCAGGCGCACAG(dTdT)-3′. The target sequences for rat GCN5 were as follows: sense 5′-UGUUCGAGCUCUCAAAGAU(dTdT)-3′ and antisense 5′-AUCUUUGAGAGCUCGAACA(dTdT)-3′. The target sequences for rat PGC-1α siRNA duplex were as follows: sense 5′-GAUUCAAACUCAGACGAUU(dTdT)-3′ and antisense 5′-AAUCGUCUGAGUUUGAAUC(dTdA)-3′. The scrambled siRNA duplex controls used were designed and supplied by Ambion. The target sequences for rat catalase siRNA duplex (Invitrogen) were as follows: sense 5′-UGGCUAUGGCUCACACACC(dTdT)-3′ and antisense 5′-GGUGUGUGAGCCAUAGCCA(dTdT)-3′. A nonrelated scrambled RNAi (5′-CACUGACAGUCUGACUCCG(dTdT)-3′) without any other match in the rat genomic sequence was used as a control. Transfection of siRNA duplexes into VSMCs was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions of the basic Nucleofector® kit for primary smooth muscle cells (Amaxa Biosystem). The efficiency and specificity of siRNA depletion were verified by Western blot using the specific antibodies. VSMCs were plated at low density, grown for 2 days in culture medium containing 10% calf serum, and growth-arrested for another day in culture medium containing 0.1% calf serum. The cells were then stimulated with 100 nm Ang II for 24 h. The intracellular ROS levels were determined using 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA; Molecular Probes). For assays, the cells were incubated with 10 μm H2DCFDA in Hanks’ balanced salt solution/calcium/magnesium buffer for 30 min. The cells were trypsinized, washed, and resuspended in Hanks’ balanced salt solution. Dichlorofluorescein fluorescence was immediately measured by a CytoFluor multi-well plate reader. To measure hypertrophy of VSMCs, the cells were quiesced for 48 h in DMEM containing 0.1% calf serum. Twenty-four hours before harvest, the cells were incubated with [3H]leucine (1 μCi/ml) in the presence or absence of 100 nm Ang II for 24 h. The cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, incubated with 5% trichloroacetic acid for 5 min on ice, and lysed with 0.4 m NaOH. Scintillation fluid was applied to the lysates, and the mixtures were counted in a liquid scintillation counter. All of the values were expressed as the means ± S.E. The data were analyzed by Student’s t test or analysis of variance of the repeated experiments, followed by the Tukey’s post hoc test when appropriate with Prism software (GraphPad Software). Statistical significance was accepted at p < 0.05. We first examined whether Ang II induces PGC-1α phosphorylation. Because PGC-1α localizes mainly in the nucleus (supplemental Fig. S1), we used nuclear extracts to immunoprecipitate PGC-1α and determine its phosphorylation by Western blot. Ang II (100 nm) stimulation increased serine phosphorylation of PGC-1α in a time-dependent manner without affecting PGC-1α protein expression (Fig. 1A). Phosphorylation of PGC-1α reached peak levels by 15 min after Ang II stimulation and gradually decreased by 60 min, providing evidence that PGC-1α is an Ang II target. Our group and others have shown that Ang II stimulates phosphorylation"

PI3K inhibitors are effective at reducing platelet aggregation and thrombus formation in vivo and as a consequence are currently being evaluated as novel antithrombotic agents. PI3K regulation of integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3) activation (affinity modulation) primarily occurs downstream of G(i)-coupled and tyrosine kinase-linked receptors linked to the activation of Rap1b, AKT, and phospholipase C. In the present study, we demonstrate an important role for PI3Ks in regulating the avidity (strength of adhesion) of high affinity integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3) bonds, necessary for the cellular transmission of contractile forces. Using knock-out mouse models and isoform-selective PI3K inhibitors, we demonstrate that the Type Ia p110 beta isoform plays a major role in regulating thrombin-stimulated fibrin clot retraction in vitro. Reduced clot retraction induced by PI3K inhibitors was not associated with defects in integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3) activation, actin polymerization, or actomyosin contractility but was associated with a defect in integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3) association with the contractile cytoskeleton. Analysis of integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3) adhesion contacts using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy revealed an important role for PI3Ks in regulating the stability of high affinity integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3) bonds. These studies demonstrate an important role for PI3K p110 beta in regulating the avidity of high affinity integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3) receptors, necessary for the cellular transmission of contractile forces. These findings may provide new insight into the potential antithrombotic properties of PI3K p110 beta inhibitors."

It has been shown that three cysteine desulfurases (CsdA, SufS, and IscS) of Escherichia coli can transfer sulfur from l-cysteine to the thiocarboxylate of MoaD in vitro. Here, we demonstrate by surface plasmon resonance analyses that IscS, but not CsdA or SufS, interacts with MoeB and MoaD. MoeB and MoaD can stimulate the IscS activity up to 1.6-fold. Analysis of the sulfuration level of MoaD isolated from strains defective in cysteine desulfurases shows a largely decreased sulfuration level of the protein in an iscS deletion strain but not in a csdA/sufS deletion strain. We also show that another iscS deletion strain of E. coli accumulates compound Z, a direct oxidation product of the immediate precursor of MPT, to the same extent as an MPT synthase-deficient strain. In contrast, analysis of the content of compound Z in ΔcsdA and ΔsufS strains revealed no such accumulation.

https://openalex.org/W2011857146,"To prevent genetic code ambiguity due to misincorporation of amino acids into proteins, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases have evolved editing activities to eliminate intermediate or final non-cognate products. In this work we studied the different editing pathways of class Ia leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LeuRS). Different mutations and experimental conditions were used to decipher the editing mechanism, including the recently developed compound AN2690 that targets the post-transfer editing site of LeuRS. The study emphasizes the crucial importance of tRNA for the pre- and post-transfer editing catalysis. Both reactions have comparable efficiencies in prokaryotic Aquifex aeolicus and Escherichia coli LeuRSs, although the E. coli enzyme favors post-transfer editing, whereas the A. aeolicus enzyme favors pre-transfer editing. Our results also indicate that the entry of the CCA-acceptor end of tRNA in the editing domain is strictly required for tRNA-dependent pre-transfer editing. Surprisingly, this editing reaction was resistant to AN2690, which inactivates the enzyme by forming a covalent adduct with tRNALeu in the post-transfer editing site. Taken together, these data suggest that the binding of tRNA in the post-transfer editing conformation confers to the enzyme the capacity for pre-transfer editing catalysis, regardless of its capacity to catalyze post-transfer editing.

Rev. 2000; 64: 202-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). The aminoacylation reaction carried by aaRS is a two-step process. First, the amino acid is activated by ATP to yield an aminoacyl-adenylate intermediate. The second step consists in the transfer of the aminoacyl moiety to one of the two hydroxyl oxygens of the 3′-terminal nucleotide of tRNA to form the aminoacyl-tRNA and liberate AMP (3Ling J. Reynolds N. Ibba M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2009; 63: 61-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The 20 aaRSs can be divided into 2 classes of 10 members each on the basis of conserved sequences and characteristic structural motifs (4Eriani G. Delarue M. Poch O. Gangloff J. Moras D. Nature. 1990; 347: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar). The accuracy of the tRNA aminoacylation reaction is essential to the fidelity of protein synthesis and, hence, cellular functions and viability (5Hendrickson T.L. de Crécy-Lagard V. Schimmel P. Annu.

Each aaRS must select its cognate amino acid from the cellular pool of 20 different proteinaceous amino acids with an overall accuracy of approximately 1 error per 104–105 codons (8Loftfield R.B. Vanderjagt D. Biochem. J. 1972; 128: 1353-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Compared with tRNA selection, recognition of cognate amino acid is challenging for aaRSs because amino acids are small molecules with only a few interacting groups (9Jakubowski H. Goldman E.

Misactivation of amino acids isosteric to the cognate amino acid is observed by approximately half of all aaRSs because of the inherent physiochemical limitations on closely discrimination similar amino acid side chains (3Ling J. Reynolds N. Ibba M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2009; 63: 61-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). One typical example is leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LeuRS), which can misactivate isoleucine, methionine, homocysteine, α-amino butyrate, and norvaline (Nva) with different efficiencies (10Martinis S.A. Fox G.E. Nucleic Acids Symp. Ser. 1997; 36: 125-128PubMed Google Scholar). aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase leucyl-tRNA synthetase E. coli LeuRS A. aeolicus LeuRS norvaline connective peptide 1. To clear misactivated amino acid and misaminoacyl-tRNA, some synthetases have evolved an additional error-correcting mechanism known as “pre-transfer editing” to hydrolyze misaminoacyl-adenylate and “post-transfer editing” for removing mischarged tRNAs (3Ling J. Reynolds N. Ibba M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2009; 63: 61-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 9Jakubowski H. Goldman E. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 412-429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The post-transfer editing has been shown to occur in a distinct hydrolytic site that deacylates mischarged tRNAs while excluding the correct aminoacyl-tRNA (11Fukai S. Nureki O. Sekine S. Shimada A. Tao J. Vassylyev D.G. Yokoyama S. Cell. 2000; 103: 793-803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The editing site for class Ia subgroup aaRSs, including isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase, valyl-tRNA synthetase, and LeuRS, is located within the domain called connective peptide 1 (CP1), a discretely folded domain of about 200 residues inserted into the Rossmann-fold catalytic domain where aminoacylation occurs (11Fukai S.

The mechanism is believed to involve shuttling of the flexible CCA-3′ end of the tRNA from the synthetic site to the hydrolytic editing site located at a 30 Å distance (11Fukai S. Nureki O. Sekine S.

The non-cognate aminoacyl-adenylates can be hydrolyzed via tRNA-dependent (20Baldwin A.N. Berg P. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 831-838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Schimmel P. Schmidt E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 1-2Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) or tRNA-independent pathways by LeuRS and other aaRSs (22Zhu B. Yao P. Tan M. Eriani G.

FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 5110-5114Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Fluorescence-based assays and mutational analysis together with x-ray crystallography studies showed that both pre- and post-transfer editing substrate analogs bind in overlapping sites in the CP1 domain of LeuRS and isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase and suggested that misactivated amino acid is translocated from the catalytic synthetic site to the editing domain in a tRNA-dependent manner (11Fukai S.

To accomplish this, a post-initiated pre-transfer editing model has been postulated for isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase. According to this hypothesis, after an initial post-transfer editing step the binding of tRNA triggers a conformational change in the editing site that makes it competent for pre-transfer editing (27Nordin B.E. Schimmel P. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12989-12997Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, a clear structural basis for such a mechanism is unclear because no confined passageway between the synthetic and editing sites is apparent that might serve to prevent dissociation of misactivated aminoacyl-adenylates from the surface of the enzyme during translocation. On the other hand, several recent studies have shown that tRNA-dependent pre-transfer editing may occur in the synthetic active site. This has been first shown for class I glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase, which normally lacks a spatially separate editing domain (28Gruic-Sovulj I. Uter N. Bullock T. Perona J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23978-23986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Similarly, class II prolyl-tRNA synthetase and seryl-tRNA synthetase also edit non-cognate aminoacyl-adenylates in their synthetic active site in a tRNA-independent way (23Gruic-Sovulj I. Rokov-Plavec J. Weygand-Durasevic I. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 5110-5114Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 29Hati S. Ziervogel B. Sternjohn J. Wong F.C. Nagan M.C. Rosen A.E. Siliciano P.G. Chihade J.W. Musier-Forsyth K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27862-27872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). For LeuRS, the location of a tRNA-dependent pre-transfer editing activity within the synthetic site was also proposed (30Boniecki M.T. Vu M.T. Betha A.K. Martinis S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 19223-19228Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). More recently, using a CP1-inactivated mutant of LeuRS, a tRNA-independent pre-transfer editing was suggested to occur in the synthetic site, whereas both tRNA-dependent pre-transfer and post-transfer editing occur in the CP1 domain (22Zhu B. Yao P. Tan M. Eriani G. Wang E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 3418-3424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Herein, we focus our study on tRNA-dependent pre-transfer editing of Aquifex aeolicus and Escherichia coli LeuRS (AaLeuRS and EcLeuRS) (22Zhu B. Yao P. Tan M. Eriani G. Wang E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 3418-3424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 31Englisch S. Englisch U. von der Haar F. Cramer F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 7529-7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). AaLeuRS is the only known heterodimeric LeuRS consisting of an α- and β-subunit of 634 and 289 amino acid residues, respectively (32Xu M.G. Chen J.F. Martin F. Zhao M.W. Eriani G. Wang E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41590-41596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). EcLeuRS is a single polypeptide enzyme of 860 amino acid residues. Here we show that both enzymes edit the non-cognate amino acid Nva, as demonstrated by the robust AMP formation in the thin-layer chromatography (TLC)-based editing assay. We examined the editing activity of CP1-inactivated mutants located in the Thr-rich region of the two enzymes (AaLeuRS-T273R and EcLeuRS-T252R). Despite a total loss of post-transfer editing, both mutated enzymes still retained high AMP formation rates, higher than in the absence of tRNA, suggesting that another editing pathway depending on the tRNA might exist in addition to the post-transfer editing pathway. The same effect was observed when AN2690 (5-fluoro-1,3-dihydro-1-hydroxy-2,1-benzoxaborole), an antifungal agent that binds into the CP1 editing site and traps tRNALeu, was used (33Rock F.L. Mao W. Yaremchuk A. Tukalo M. Crépin T. Zhou H. Zhang Y.K. Hernandez V. Akama T. Baker S.J. Plattner J.J. Shapiro L. Martinis S.A. Benkovic S.J. Cusack S. Alley M.R. Science. 2007; 316: 1759-1761Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). We found that AN2690 inhibits aminoacylation and hydrolysis of mischarged tRNA but, unexpectedly, the compound only partially impaired AMP formation. On the contrary, when AaLeuRS-Y358D and EcLeuRS-Y330D mutants were used to block the tRNA entry into the CP1 editing pocket, both tRNA-dependent editing pathways were abolished. These data strongly suggested that prokaryotic AaLeuRS and EcLeuRS possess strong tRNA-dependent pre-transfer editing activity that crucially depends on the interaction of the CCA acceptor end within the CP1 domain. Our results also indicated that tRNA-dependent pre-transfer editing might cooperate with post-transfer editing to improve the fidelity of catalysis of LeuRS. AaLeuRS and EcLeuRS were overproduced in E. coli transformants containing their genes as His-tagged proteins and purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography, as described previously (13Chen J.F. Guo N.N. Li T. Wang E.D. Wang Y.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6726-6731Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 33Rock F.L. Mao W. Yaremchuk A. Tukalo M. Crépin T. Zhou H. Zhang Y.K. Hernandez V.

The genes encoding the various mutations were constructed by the two-step PCR method, and the DNA sequences of all the mutants were confirmed by DNA sequencing. A. aeolicus tRNAGAGLeu (AatRNALeu) and E. coli tRNAGAGLeu (EctRNALeu), with an accepting activity of 1400 and 1300 pmol/A260, were prepared from an overproduction strain constructed in our laboratory, respectively (32Xu M.G. Chen J.F. Martin F. Zhao M.W. Eriani G. Wang E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41590-41596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 34Li Y. Wang E.D. Wang Y.L. Science in China (series C). 1998; 41: 225-231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ile-EctRNALeu and Ile-AatRNALeu were obtained using EcLeuRS-Y330D mutant. Aminoacylation activities of AaLeuRS or EcLeuRS were performed at 37 °C in a reaction mixture containing 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 30 mm KCl, 12 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 4 mm ATP, 20 μm AatRNALeu or EctRNALeu, 40 μm [3H]leucine (15 Ci/mmol), and 20 nm AaLeuRS or EcLeuRS with or without 100 μm AN2690 (Milestone Pharmtech USA Inc.) (13Chen J.F. Guo N.N. Li T. Wang E.D. Wang Y.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6726-6731Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 33Rock F.L. Mao W. Yaremchuk A. Tukalo M. Crépin T. Zhou H. Zhang Y.K. Hernandez V. Akama T. Baker S.J. Plattner J.J. Shapiro L. Martinis S.A. Benkovic S.J. Cusack S. Alley M.R. Science. 2007; 316: 1759-1761Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Misacylation assays were carried out in a similar system, except that 100 μm [3H]isoleucine (30 Ci/mmol) and 3 μm AaLeuRS or 0.5 μm EcLeuRS mutants were used. Hydrolytic editing assays of AaLeuRS or EcLeuRS and the mutants were performed at 37 °C in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 30 mm KCl, 12 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 μm [3H]Ile-tRNALeu (300 μCi/μmol), and the reactions were initiated with 20 nm enzyme. To measure deacylation of mischarged Ile-EctRNALeu (1 μm) in the presence of AN2690 (100 μm), uncharged EctRNALeu (5 μm) was added to the reaction mixture. Only uncharged tRNA can react with AN2690 and form the covalent adduct responsible for the enzyme inactivation. AMP formation by AaLeuRS was measured as previously described (22Zhu B. Yao P. Tan M. Eriani G. Wang E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 3418-3424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 30 mm KCl, 12 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 units/ml pyrophosphatase (Roche Applied Science), 3 mm ATP, 20 nm [α-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences), and 15 mm Nva in the presence or absence of 5 μm tRNALeu. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 1 μm AaLeuRS or its mutants and incubated at 60 °C. For EcLeuRS, the assay was carried out at 37 °C and initiated by 0.2 μm enzyme. Aliquots (1.5 μl) were quenched in 6 μl of 200 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.0). Quenched aliquots (1.5 μl each) were spotted in duplicate on polyethyleneimine cellulose plates (Merck) pre-washed with water. Separation of aminoacyl-[32P]AMP, [32P]AMP, and [32P]ATP was performed by developing TLC plates in 0.1 m ammonium acetate and 5% acetic acid. The plates were visualized by phosphorimaging, and data were analyzed using Multi Gauge Version 3.0 software (FUJIFILM). The gray densities of [32P]AMP spots were compared with the gray density of known [32P]ATP concentrations. Rate constants were obtained from graphs of [32P]AMP formation plotted against time. Equilibrium titrations were performed at room temperature with 0.1 μm enzyme in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 30 mm KCl, 12 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. Tryptophan fluorescence was excited at 280 nm. An emission wavelength of 340 nm was used to quantify binding after correction for dilution and for the inner filter effect. Control solutions of bovine serum albumin or tryptophan were performed to show that there was no fluorescence response to tRNA. The Kd values were determined by fitting fluorescence intensity change data versus tRNA concentration using Originpro 7.5 software. In the presence of cognate amino acid, synthesis of aminoacyl-tRNA occurs after transient synthesis of an aminoacyl-adenylate molecule. It results in the release of a single AMP and pyrophosphate molecule. However, when a non-cognate amino acid is activated by an aaRS, it may be mischarged on the tRNA and then hydrolyzed in the editing domain or be directly hydrolyzed by the enzyme before the transfer step. Both hydrolytic pathways lead to the production of one AMP molecule per cycle. Therefore, the extra formation of AMP during the catalytic process is characteristic of editing events. AMP formation can be directly monitored on TLC (28Gruic-Sovulj I. Uter N. Bullock T. Perona J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23978-23986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The non-cognate amino acid Nva was used to assay the editing activity of AaLeuRS and EcLeuRS in the presence and absence of tRNA. The data in Table 1 showed that tRNA could significantly stimulate the editing activity measured by the increase of AMP formation due to the editing reaction. The observed rate constant of AMP formation (kobs) of AaLeuRS in the absence and presence of AatRNALeu was 0.086 and 1.43 s−1 (Table 1), respectively, consistent with our previous results (22Zhu B. Yao P. Tan M. Eriani G. Wang E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 3418-3424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We then examined and measured the AMP formation rate of EcLeuRS in the presence of Nva. The kobs in the absence of tRNALeu was 0.33 s−1, whereas it reached 3.42 s−1 in the presence of tRNALeu (Table 2). These results showed that tRNALeu robustly stimulates editing activity of either AaLeuRS or EcLeuRS.TABLE 1Observed rate constants of AaLeuRS and its mutants in AMP synthesis at 60 °CLeuRStRNAAMP formation kobss−1Wild type−(8.6 ± 1.4) × 10−2Wild type+1.43 ± 0.25T273R−(9.1 ± 1.4) × 10−2T273R+1.01 ± 0.17Y358D−(8.8 ± 1.4) × 10−2Y358D+(9.5 ± 1.6) × 10−2Y358E−(9.2 ± 1.4) × 10−2Y358E+(1.7 ± 1.6) × 10−1 Open table in a new tab TABLE 2Observed rate constants of EcLeuRS and its mutants in AMP synthesis at 37 °CLeuRStRNAAN2690AMP formation kobss−1WT−−(3.3 ± 0.4) × 10−1WT+−3.42 ± 0.51WT−+(3.1 ± 0.4) × 10−1WT++1.86 ± 0.28T252R−−(3.5 ± 0.6) × 10−1T252R+−1.53 ± 0.27Y330D−−(3.6 ± 0.53) × 10−1Y330D+−(3.9 ± 0.63) × 10−1T252A/Y330D−−(3.7 ± 0.56) × 10−1T252A/Y330D+−(4.4 ± 0.72) × 10−1 Open table in a new tab In theory, a robust editing capability may result from an efficient post-transfer editing activity that occurs after tRNA charging and/or from a rapid hydrolysis of misactivated amino acid in a pre-transfer editing step induced by tRNA. Both pathways lead to AMP accumulation. To distinguish between these possibilities, we specifically inactivated the post-transfer editing pathway by mutagenesis. We previously inactivated the CP1 domain from the AaLeuRS by mutating a conserved aspartic acid to alanine (D373A) (22Zhu B. Yao P. Tan M. Eriani G. Wang E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 3418-3424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This residue was proposed to maintain the proper orientation of both pre- and post-transfer editing substrates into the CP1 domain (15Lincecum Jr., T.L. Tukalo M. Yaremchuk A. Mursinna R.S. Williams A.M. Sproat B.S. Van Den Eynde W. Link A. Van Calenbergh S. Grøtli M. Martinis S.A. Cusack S. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 951-963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The mutation inactivated post-transfer editing but did not change tRNA-independent pre-transfer editing, suggesting that the later reaction was catalyzed within the aminoacylation active site (22Zhu B. Yao P. Tan M. Eriani G. Wang E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 3418-3424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To confirm the result, one of the Thr residues from the threonine-rich region was selected for mutation (Fig. 1). Residue Thr-273 in AaLeuRS and the corresponding Thr-252 in EcLeuRS are key residues of the post-transfer editing activity of LeuRSs (17Xu M.G. Li J. Du X. Wang E.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 318: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 35Mursinna R.S. Lincecum Jr., T.L. Martinis S.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5376-5381Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 36Mursinna R.S. Martinis S.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 7286-7287Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In EcLeuRS, substitution of Thr-252 by smaller residues increased the size of the editing pocket, leading to a dramatic loss of editing specificity and deacylation of the cognate Leu-tRNALeu product (17Xu M.G. Li J. Du X. Wang E.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 318: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 35Mursinna R.S. Lincecum Jr., T.L. Martinis S.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5376-5381Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Increasing the size of residue 252 had the opposite effect, preventing entry of non-cognate substrates into the editing pocket and, thus, reducing the enzyme fidelity (35Mursinna R.S. Lincecum Jr., T.L. Martinis S.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5376-5381Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 36Mursinna R.S. Martinis S.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 7286-7287Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Here we tested a new mutation combining both an increase of size and an addition of an extra positive charge. We mutated the crucial Thr residue to Arg and obtained the mutants AaLeuRS-T273R and EcLeuRS-T252R, respectively. Both mutants did not change the aminoacylation activity (supplemental Fig. S1), but the deacylation of Ile-tRNALeu was strongly impaired, consistent with a defect in post-transfer editing (Fig. 2, C and F). In parallel, we carried TLC-based assay in the presence of Nva and tRNALeu. Interestingly, AaLeuRS-T273R still exhibited 70% of AMP formation (kobs = 1.01 s−1) compared with the native enzyme (kobs = 1.43 s−1) (Table 1, Fig. 2, A and B). For EcLeuRS-T252R, the kobs of AMP formation was 1.53 s−1, about 45% that of native EcLeuRS (kobs = 3.42 s−1) (Table 2, Fig. 2, D and E). These values indicate that the Thr mutations have induced a decrease of AMP formation in the presence of tRNA, which should correspond to the loss of post-transfer editing activity. In the absence of tRNA, the kobs values of AaLeuRS-T273R and native AaLeuRS were comparable and reached only 0.091 and 0.086 s−1, respectively (Table 1). Those from EcLeuRS-T252R and native EcLeuRS were 0.35 and 0.33 s−1, respectively (Table 2). The latter results indicated that mutating the Thr residue crucial for post-transfer editing activity did not affect at all the tRNA-independent pre-transfer editing.FIGURE 2The editing property of AaLeuRS, EcLeuRS, and mutated derivatives.

In theory, the remaining AMP formation measured with these mutants should result from the sum of the enzyme-catalyzed pre-transfer editing pathways and the spontaneous hydrolysis of Nva-AMP. However, the latter reaction is generally low and negligible compared with the total AMP accumulation rate (22Zhu B. Yao P. Tan M. Eriani G. Wang E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 3418-3424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to the post-transfer editing pathway, both AaLeuRS and EcLeuRS possess tRNA-dependent pre-transfer editing pathways that contribute to 70 and 45% of the total AMP formation. Such a pathway would hydrolyze non-cognate adenylates at the pre-transfer level. Compared with the previous results obtained with the AaLeuRS-D373A mutant, the level of the tRNA-dependent pre-transfer editing here measured with the Thr mutant was significantly higher (71% here versus 13% in Ref. 22Zhu B.

This might indicate that the T273R substitution did not inactivate the editing activity as did the D373A mutant. Although both types of mutants totally abolished the Ile-tRNALeu deacylation in vitro, the remaining AMP formation rate was not equivalent in the presence of tRNALeu. This strongly suggested that the enzymes carrying the D373A and T273R mutations did not exhibit the same CP1 editing site conformation in the presence of tRNA, one having greater tRNA-dependent pre-transfer editing activity. In conclusion, the T273R and T252R mutations have separated the post-transfer and pre-transfer editing pathways, leading to enzymes possessing exclusively pre-transfer editing activities.

As a peroxisome pro-liferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ target, RetSat was shown to be required for adipocyte differentiation in the 3T3-L1 cell culture model. To understand the mechanism involved in this putative proadipogenic effect of RetSat, we studied the consequences of ablating RetSat expression on retinoid metabolism and adipose tissue differentiation in RetSat-null mice. Here, we report that RetSat-null mice have normal levels of retinol and retinyl palmitate in liver, serum, and adipose tissue, but, in contrast to wild-type mice, are deficient in the production of all-trans-13,14-dihydroretinol from dietary vitamin A. Despite accumulating more fat, RetSat-null mice maintained on either low-fat or high-fat diets gain weight and have similar rates of food intake as age- and gender-matched wildtype control littermates. This increased adiposity of RetSat-null mice is associated with up-regulation of PPARγ, a key transcriptional regulator of adipogenesis, and also its downstream target, fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4/aP2). On the basis of these results, we propose that dihydroretinoids produced byRetSat control physiological processes that influence PPARγ activity and regulate lipid accumulation in mice.—Moise, A.

In response to oxidative stress, NQR-derived protein thiols at the 51- and 75-kDa subunits are known to be reversibly <i>S</i>-glutathionylated. Although several glutathionylated domains from NQR 51 and 75 kDa have been identified, their roles in the regulatory functions remain to be explored. To gain further insights into protein <i>S</i>-glutathionylation of complex I, we used two peptides of <i>S</i>-glutathionylated domain (<sup>200</sup>GAGAYICGEETALIESIEGK<sup>219</sup> of 51-kDa protein and <sup>361</sup>VDSDTLCTEEVFPTAGAGTDLR<sup>382</sup> of 75-kDa protein) as chimeric epitopes incorporating a ""promiscuous"" T-cell epitope to generate two polyclonal antibodies, AbGSCA206 and AbGSCB367. Binding of AbGSCA206 and AbGSCB367 inhibited NQR-mediated generation by 37 and 57%, as measured by EPR spin-trapping. To further provide an appropriate control, two peptides of non-glutathionylated domain (<sup>21</sup>SGDTTAPKKTSFGSLKDFDR<sup>40</sup> of 51-kDa peptide and <sup>100</sup>WNILTNSEKTKKAREGVMEFL<sup>120</sup> of 75-kDa peptide) were synthesized as chimeric epitopes to generate two polyclonal antibodies, Ab51 and Ab75.

None of AbGSCA206, AbGSCB367, Ab51, or Ab75 showed an inhibitory effect on the electron transfer activity of NQR, suggesting that antibody binding to the glutathione-binding domain decreased electron leakage from the hydrophilic domain of NQR. When heart tissue homogenates were immunoprecipitated with Ab51 or Ab75 and probed with an antibody against glutathione, protein <i>S</i>-glutathionylation was enhanced in post-ischemic myocardium at the NQR 51-kDa subunit, but not at the 75-kDa subunit, indicating that the 51-kDa subunit of flavin subcomplex is more sensitive to oxidative stress resulting from myocardial infarction."
https://openalex.org/W2040722231,"Ca(v)3.2 T-type channels contain a high affinity metal binding site for trace metals such as copper and zinc. This site is occupied at physiologically relevant concentrations of these metals, leading to decreased channel activity and pain transmission. A histidine at position 191 was recently identified as a critical determinant for both trace metal block of Ca(v)3.2 and modulation by redox agents. His(191) is found on the extracellular face of the Ca(v)3.2 channel on the IS3-S4 linker and is not conserved in other Ca(v)3 channels. Mutation of the corresponding residue in Ca(v)3.1 to histidine, Gln(172), significantly enhances trace metal inhibition, but not to the level observed in wild-type Ca(v)3.2, implying that other residues also contribute to the metal binding site. The goal of the present study is to identify these other residues using a series of chimeric channels. The key findings of the study are that the metal binding site is composed of a Asp-Gly-His motif in IS3-S4 and a second aspartate residue in IS2. These results suggest that metal binding stabilizes the closed conformation of the voltage-sensor paddle in repeat I, and thereby inhibits channel opening. These studies provide insight into the structure of T-type channels, and identify an extracellular motif that could be targeted for drug development."

A synthetic actin-binding sequence (ABS) peptide 326 with amino acid sequence corresponding to residues 326–333 of human eNOS, one of the putative ABSs, specifically bound to β-actin and prevented eNOS association with β-actin in vitro. Peptide 326 also prevented β-actin-induced decrease in superoxide formation and increase in NO and l-citrulline production. A modified peptide 326 replacing hydrophobic amino acids leucine and tryptophan with neutral alanine was unable to interfere with eNOS-β-actin binding and to prevent β-actin-induced changes in NO and superoxide formation. Site-directed mutagenesis of the actin-binding domain of eNOS replacing leucine and tryptophan with alanine yielded an eNOS mutant that exhibited reduced eNOS-β-actin association, decreased NO production, and increased superoxide formation in COS-7 cells. Disruption of eNOS-β-actin interaction in endothelial cells using ABS peptide 326 resulted in decreased NO production, increased superoxide formation, and decreased endothelial monolayer wound repair, which was prevented by PEG-SOD and NO donor NOC-18.

Here we show that Sec-tRNASec binds to SelB·GTP with an extraordinary high affinity (Kd = 0.2 pm). The tight binding is driven enthalpically and involves the net formation of four ion pairs, three of which may involve the Sec residue. The dissociation of tRNA from the ternary complex SelB·GTP·Sec-tRNASec is very slow (0.3 h−1), and GTP hydrolysis accelerates the release of Sec-tRNASec by more than a million-fold (to 240 s−1).

Incorporation of Sec into selenoproteins requires a specialized translation elongation factor SelB. SelB specifically recognizes selenocysteyl-tRNA, Sec-tRNASec, but not other aminoacyl-tRNAs (aa-tRNAs) (1Forchhammer K. Leinfelder W. Böck A. Nature. 1989; 342: 453-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In bacteria, tRNASec is charged with serine by seryl-tRNA synthetase. The resulting Ser-tRNASec is not recognized by the translation elongation factor EF-Tu and does not enter translation; rather, the seryl residue of Ser-tRNASec is converted to a selenocysteyl residue by the pyridoxal phosphate-containing enzyme selenocysteine synthase (the selA gene product), which uses selenomonophosphate as the selenium donor substrate (2Commans S. Böck A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1999; 23: 335-351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The latter is synthesized from selenite and ATP by selenophosphate synthetase (the selD gene product). Finally, Sec-tRNASec is recognized by SelB, which delivers it to ribosomes translating mRNAs coding for selenoproteins. The incorporation of Sec is encoded by a combination of an internal UGA stop codon and a specific mRNA hairpin structure, the SECIS (selenocysteine-inserting sequence) located immediately downstream of the UGA codon. In bacteria, SelB binds to the SECIS element directly, without the help of auxiliary proteins, thereby targeting Sec-tRNASec to the specific UGA codon (3Atkins J.F. Gesteland R.F.

EMBO J. 2005; 24: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). SelB domains I (the GTP binding domain), II, and III have the same secondary structure elements as the respective domains of EF-Tu, provide most of the contact surface for Sec-tRNASec, and are conserved among bacteria, archaea, and eukarya. The structure of domain IV of SelB, which has no analog in EF-Tu or other translational GTPases, is not conserved between pro- and eukaryotes (7Leibundgut M. Frick C. Thanbichler M. Böck A. Ban N.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 162-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and rather resemble those of EF-G or IF2 (12Wilden B. Savelsbergh A. Rodnina M.V. Wintermeyer W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

SelB from Escherichia coli binds GTP and GDP with affinities of 0.7 μm and 13 μm, respectively (10Thanbichler M. Bock A. Goody R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20458-20466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The rate of GDP dissociation from SelB is high, 15 s−1, which allows for rapid and spontaneous nucleotide exchange, explaining the absence of a nucleotide exchange factor for SelB. In contrast to EF-Tu, which undergoes a large structural rearrangement when GTP is hydrolyzed to GDP, domains I-III in SelB from Methanococcus maripaludis adopt similar, GTP-like conformations in the presence of GTP, GDP, or in the absence of nucleotide (7Leibundgut M. Frick C. Thanbichler M. Böck A. Ban N. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), in line with the notion that SelB is able to bind Sec-tRNASec not only in the GTP- but also the apo- and GDP-bound form (1Forchhammer K. Leinfelder W. Böck A. Nature. 1989; 342: 453-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 7Leibundgut M. Frick C. Thanbichler M. Böck A. Ban N. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This raises the questions of whether and how the GTP form of SelB is specifically recognized by Sec-tRNASec. The structure of the SelB complex with Sec-tRNASec is not available. The current model of SelB action on the ribosome is largely based on the analogy to EF-Tu. The ternary complex EF-Tu·GTP·aa-tRNA binds to the ribosome and, upon recognition of a correct codon, hydrolyzes GTP. The following release of aa-tRNA from EF-Tu·GDP is rapid and spontaneous, because the affinity of aa-tRNA for EF-Tu·GDP is very low, and thus GTP hydrolysis by EF-Tu can be considered as an all-or-none switch for the release of aa-tRNA. Domains I-III of SelB are expected to bind to the ribosome in a similar fashion as the respective domains of EF-Tu; in that arrangement, domain IV of SelB reaches the mRNA entrance tunnel on the 30 S subunit (14Hüttenhofer A. Böck A. RNA Structure and Function. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, NY1998: 603-639Google Scholar, 15Ose T. Soler N. Rasubala L. Kuroki K. Kohda D. Fourmy D. Yoshizawa S. Maenaka K.

However, the role of GTP hydrolysis for SelB function is not clear, because, unlike EF-Tu, SelB binds its aa-tRNA also in the presence of GDP or in the absence of nucleotide (1Forchhammer K. Leinfelder W. Böck A. Nature. 1989; 342: 453-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 7Leibundgut M. Frick C. Thanbichler M. Böck A. Ban N.

In this work, we determined the effect of guanine nucleotides on the affinity of SelB for Sec-tRNASec and developed a thermodynamic and kinetic framework for the formation of the ternary complex. We further estimated the relative contributions of the Sec residue and the tRNASec molecule to the interaction with SelB, probed the nature of binding contacts, and determined the kinetics of Sec-tRNASec release from SelB in either the GTP- or GDP-bound form.

SelB was dialyzed against buffer C (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 400 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 20% glycerol). All proteins were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Concentrations of SelB were determined by absorbance at 280 nm (εSelB = 81080 m−1cm−1). The preparation of SelB used for the experiments was free of GTP and GDP, as determined by HPLC analysis (19John J. Sohmen R. Feuerstein J. Linke R. Wittinghofer A. Goody R.S.

The extent of conversion was >90%, as determined by thin layer chromatography (23Leinfelder W. Forchhammer K. Veprek B. Zehelein E. Böck A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Constant amounts of Sec-tRNASec were mixed with varying amounts of SelB in the absence or presence of GTP/GDP (2 mm) and incubated for 15 min. For reactions with very low amounts of protein (<1 pmol), 50 μg of bovine serum albumin (Fermentas) were added to the reactions to prevent unspecific adsorption of the protein to the tube walls. The amount of [14C]Sec or [3H]Sec bound to SelB was determined by filtration through nitrocellulose filters (0.45 μm, Sartorius). Filters were dissolved and radioactivity measured in Quickszint 361 scintillation mixture (Zinsser Analytic). The data were evaluated by non-linear fitting to a quadratic equation describing ligand binding to one site using Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Equilibrium titrations with fluorescence-labeled tRNASec(Prf20) were carried out in a PTI fluorimeter (excitation at 470 nm, emission at 510 nm). Increasing concentrations of SelB in the absence or presence of guanine nucleotide (2 mm) were added to a constant amount of tRNASec(Prf20) or Ser-tRNASec(Prf20) aminoacylated in situ (0.05 μm), and the increase of Prf fluorescence was monitored. The measured fluorescence was corrected for dilution and titrations were evaluated as described (24Rodnina M.V. Pape T. Fricke R. Kuhn L. Wintermeyer W. J. Biol.

ΔH° and ΔS° values were obtained from the slope and y-axis intercept of the −log(Kd) versus 1/T plot, respectively, at each ionic condition. The linear dependence of the ΔH° and ΔS° values on monovalent ions concentration allowed extrapolation to the ionic strength conditions used in other titration experiments, i.e. buffer B with 30 mm KCl. The number of ion pairs formed between SelB and tRNASec, Ser-tRNASec, or Sec-tRNASec was calculated from the slopes of −log(Kd) versus −log[M+] plots according to Equation 1,log(Kd)=(Zψ+k)×log[M+]-log(K0)(1) where [M+] is the total concentration of monovalent cations in the reaction (in moles); ψ is the fraction of counterions associated with the nucleic acid per phosphate group; Z is the number of cations that interact with the nucleic acid; k is the number of anions released from the protein upon formation of the ternary complex; K0 is an intrinsic binding constant. The ψ value takes into account the proportion of single-stranded and double-stranded regions of tRNASec; an estimate was made on the basis of the crystal structures of EF-Tu·GDPNP·Phe-tRNAPhe and EF-Tu·GDPNP·Cys-tRNACys complexes (25Nissen P.

Structure. 1999; 7: 143-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), which indicate that three-quarters of the groups that directly interact with EF-Tu were located in double-stranded regions of tRNA. To determine the apparent association rate constants of complex formation, kapp, [3H]Sec-tRNASec (20 pm) was mixed with SelB (40 pm), GTP, or GDPNP (0.1 mm) in buffer B at 25, 30, and 37 °C. The amount of [3H]Sec-tRNASec bound to SelB was determined by nitrocellulose filtration. To measure dissociation rate constants, koff, [3H]Sec-tRNASec (5 nm), SelB (7 nm), and GTP (or GDPNP) (2 mm) were incubated in buffer B for 15 min at the indicated temperature to form the complex, and then a 10-fold excess of unlabeled Sec-tRNASec was added to follow the dissociation of [3H]Sec-tRNASec from the complex. The amount of Sec-tRNASec was not changed significantly due to deacylation or oxidation during the time of experiment. Time courses were evaluated by single-exponential fitting using Prism software. The association rate constant, kon, was calculated according to Equation 2,kon=(kapp-koff)/([SeIB•GTP]+[Sec-tRNASec])(2) where [SelB·GTP] and [Sec-tRNASec] denote equilibrium concentrations. Rapid kinetics were measured with proflavin-labeled tRNASec using a stopped-flow apparatus (SX-18MV; Applied Photophysics, Surrey, UK) in buffer B at 25 °C. Proflavin fluorescence was excited at 470 nm and measured after passing a longpass filter (KV 500; Schott, Mainz, Germany). SelB (0.4 μm, final concentrations after mixing are given throughout) was preincubated with the respective form of tRNASec(Prf20) (0.2 μm), and the complexes were rapidly mixed with unlabeled tRNASec (3 μm). Time courses depicted in the figures were obtained by averaging 8–10 individual transients. Data were evaluated by fitting to a single-exponential function with a characteristic time constant (kapp), amplitude (A), and another variable for the final signal (F∞) according to Equation 3,F=F∞+Aexp(-kapp×t)(3) where F is the fluorescence at time t. Where necessary, two exponential terms were used with two characteristic time constants (kapp1, kapp2), amplitudes (A, B), and another variable for the final signal (F∞) according to Equation 4.F=F∞+Aexp(-kapp1×t)+Bexp(-kapp2×t)(4) The reason for kinetic heterogeneity is not known; the average dissociation rate constant was estimated as described (29Milon P. Konevega A.L. Gualerzi C.O. Rodnina M.V. Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 712-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Calculations were performed using Prism software. Standard deviations were calculated using the same software. We analyzed the complex formation between Sec-tRNASec, Ser-tRNASec, or tRNASec and SelB in the apo-, GDP-, or GTP-bound forms, using nitrocellulose filtration or fluorescence titration techniques. In agreement with earlier observations (1Forchhammer K. Leinfelder W. Böck A. Nature. 1989; 342: 453-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 7Leibundgut M. Frick C. Thanbichler M. Böck A. Ban N. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), Sec-tRNASec binds to SelB in all three forms (Fig. 1A); however, the affinity of binding was found to be much higher for SelB·GTP than for the apo- or GDP-bound forms. With SelB·GTP the affinity was too high (Kd <1 nm) to accurately determine the Kd value under the reaction conditions used for these experiments. The affinity of Sec-tRNASec for SelB-apo and SelB·GDP was similar with Kd values of 420 nm and 540 nm, respectively (Table 1). The affinities for SelB of Sec-tRNASec prepared from native tRNA or from a tRNA transcript were also similar, 420 and 470 nm, respectively (Fig. 1A, compare open and closed squares), indicating that unmodified tRNASec behaves essentially the same as native tRNASec with respect to SelB binding.TABLE 1Summary of the Kd valuesNucleotide boundApoGDPGTPnmnmnmSelB·Sec-tRNASec420 ± 30540 ± 60(2.1 ± 0.6)·10−4SelB·Ser-tRNASec270 ± 60280 ± 60160 ± 10SelB·tRNASec aThe Kd values were measured at 6 °C; data taken from Ref. 40.290 ± 50280 ± 50190 ± 10EF-Tu·Phe-tRNAPhe aThe Kd values were measured at 6 °C; data taken from Ref. 40.N.D.bN.D., not determined.28,5000.85eIF2·Met-tRNAiMet cc The Kd values measured at 26 °C; data taken from Ref. 37.1151509eIF2·tRNAiMet cc The Kd values measured at 26 °C; data taken from Ref. 37.N.D.140130a The Kd values were measured at 6 °C; data taken from Ref. 40Dell V.A.

Open table in a new tab The affinity of deacylated tRNASec and Ser-tRNASec to SelB was determined by fluorescence titrations using fluorescence-labeled tRNASec(Prf20) containing proflavin at position 20 in the D loop (Fig. 1B). Using [14C]Ser-tRNASec(Prf20), we verified that the two methods, nitrocellulose filtration and fluorescence titration, gave identical results and that fluorescence labeling did not impair function. The affinities of deacylated tRNASec and Ser-tRNASec for SelB, SelB·GDP, and SelB·GTP were very similar (Table 1). As the affinity of Sec-tRNASec binding to SelB·GTP was too high to be determined by titration at standard conditions, we set out to determine the kinetics of interaction and calculate the Kd from kon and koff values. Time courses of Sec-tRNASec binding to SelB·GTP (Fig. 2A) in excess of SelB·GTP over [3H]Sec-tRNASec were single-exponential, and the concentration dependence of the apparent association constant, kapp, was linear (Fig. 2B), suggesting a well-behaved one-step binding reaction that followed pseudo-first order. As the ordinate intercept was close to zero (Fig. 2B), koff values were measured in separate chase experiments. The SelB·GTP·[3H]Sec-tRNASec complex was formed, and the dissociation of [3H]Sec-tRNASec was monitored after adding excess unlabeled Sec-tRNASec (Fig. 2C). The resulting koff values, together with the kon values calculated from the kapp and koff (“Experimental Procedures”), are summarized in Table 2. The Kd values for the SelB·GTP·Sec-tRNASec complex, calculated from Kd = koff/kon, are in the subpicomolar range (Table 2), indicating an extremely tight association. For comparison, we also measured the association and dissociation rates and the Kd value for the interaction of Sec-tRNASec with SelB in the complex with GDPNP, which is commonly used as a non-hydrolyzable GTP analog. Whereas the association rate constants of Sec-tRNASec with SelB·GTP or SelB·GDPNP were the same, the dissociation rates differed considerably, resulting in a 25-fold higher Kd value of the complex with GDPNP. This suggests that the conformations of SelB with GTP and GDPNP are somewhat different. Therefore, the interactions between SelB and Sec-tRNASec that were modeled on the basis of the SelB·GDPNP crystal structure (7Leibundgut M. Frick C. Thanbichler M. Böck A. Ban N. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) may not reflect the GTP-containing complex in every detail.TABLE 2Rate constants of formation and dissociation of various SelB complexeskonkoffKdm−1s−1s−1nmSelB·GTP·Sec-tRNASec (25 °C)(4.2 ± 0.3)·108(0.9 ± 0.2)·10−4(0.21 ± 0.06)·10−3 aCalculated from the kon and koff values.SelB·GTP·Sec-tRNASec (30 °C)(4.9 ± 0.3)·108(1.7 ± 0.2)·10−4(0.35 ± 0.06)·10−3 aCalculated from the kon and koff values.SelB·GTP·Sec-tRNASec (37 °C)(5.1 ± 0.2)·108(2.9 ± 0.4)·10−4(0.6 ± 0.1)·10−3 aCalculated from the kon and koff values.SelB·GDPNP·Sec-tRNASec (37 °C)(3.8 ± 0.2)·108(21 ± 2)·10−4(5.5 ± 0.8)·10−3 aCalculated from the kon and koff values.SelB·GDP·Sec-tRNASec(4.4 ± 1.2)·108 bCalculated using the Kd values.240 ± 40540 ± 60SelB·GTP·Ser-tRNASec(0.9 ± 0.2)·108 bCalculated using the Kd values.14 ± 2160 ± 10SelB·GTP·tRNASec(1.0 ± 0.1)·108 bCalculated using the Kd values.18 ± 1190 ± 10SelB·GDP·tRNASec(8.0 ± 2.7)·108 bCalculated using the Kd values.220 ± 30280 ± 50SelB-apo·tRNASec(7.2 ± 2.4)·108 bCalculated using the Kd values.210 ± 30290 ± 50a Calculated from the kon and koff values.b Calculated using the Kd values. Open table in a new tab The dissociation of Sec-tRNASec from the complex with SelB·GTP (or GDPNP) was very slow (in the hours range), allowing for the determination of koff by nitrocellulose filtration. In contrast, the dissociation of almost all other complexes was too rapid to be monitored by filtration. For those complexes, we measured dissociation rate constants by fluorescence stopped-flow (Fig. 2D). Complexes of SelB in the apo-, GDP-, or GTP-bound forms with Sec-, Ser-, and deacylated tRNASec(Prf20) were mixed with excess unlabeled tRNASec, and the release of the labeled tRNASec was monitored by the fluorescence decrease taking place in the milliseconds range. Using koff and Kd values (Table 1), association rate constants kon were calculated (Table 2). Upon replacement of GTP for GDP, the dissociation of Sec-tRNASec from the complex became faster by more than six orders of magnitude, whereas the association rate was unchanged. The complexes of Ser-tRNASec and tRNASec with SelB·GTP also dissociated rapidly, five orders of magnitude faster than the SelB·GTP·Sec-tRNASec complex. The stability of the complexes of tRNASec with SelB was much less sensitive to the nucleotide form of the factor, with tRNASec dissociating from SelB·GTP only 10 times more slowly than from SelB·GDP or SelB. To understand the molecular basis for the tight binding of Sec-tRNASec to SelB·GTP, we determined the ionic strength dependence of the Kd values, which can provide information about the contribution of electrostatic interactions to complex formation (27Record Jr., M.T. Lohman M.L. De Haseth P. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 107: 145-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). The experiments were carried out at 37 °C in the presence of increasing concentrations of KCl up to 525 mm (Fig. 3A). The decrease in affinity with increasing ionic strength of the buffer (Fig. 3B) suggests that ternary complex formation involves ionic interactions. The number of ion pairs contributing to the interaction was estimated from the slope of the plot (27Record Jr., M.T. Lohman M.L. De Haseth P. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 107: 145-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar, 28Lohman T.M. deHaseth P.L. Record Jr., M.T. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 3522-3530Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The Mg2+ concentration (4 mm free Mg2+) was low compared with that of KCl; hence, the uncertainty in estimating the number of ionic interactions that is introduced by the presence of Mg2+ ions was negligible. The number of ionic interactions involved in SelB·GTP·Sec-tRNASec formation was 4.2 ± 0.2. In comparison, the interaction of SelB with Ser-tRNASec or tRNASec was much less dependent on salt concentration (Fig. 3B), and the estimated number of ion pairs was 0.6. The different salt sensitivities of the SelB complex in the presence and absence of Sec argues against the possibility that the KCl effect is not due to electrostatics but to the effect of Cl− ions on the protein structure. Furthermore, the log(Kd) value was a linear function of log[M+] over the whole range of salt concentrations and similar slopes of the log(Kd) versus log[M+] plots were obtained for potassium chloride and acetate, suggesting that the contributions of unspecific anion effects are insignificant (27Record Jr., M.T. Lohman M.L. De Haseth P. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 107: 145-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar, 28Lohman T.M. deHaseth P.L. Record Jr., M.T. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 3522-3530Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). We used two independent approaches to determine the thermodynamic parameters of SelB·GTP·Sec-tRNASec complex formation. The standard enthalpy and entropy changes were estimated using the Kd values calculated from the rate constants (Fig. 4). Alternatively, we determined the thermodynamic parameters at several high KCl concentrations where affinities were reduced sufficiently to measure Kd values reliably. The dependence of the ΔH° and ΔS° values on monovalent ions concentration was linear, which allowed for the extrapolation to other ionic strength conditions; both methods gave identical results (Table 3). The binding of Sec-tRNASec to SelB·GTP is driven by a large favorable enthalpy change, whereas the entropy change was very small. In comparison, with Ser-tRNASec and tRNASec, the decrease in the affinity of binding to SelB·GTP was entirely due to a less favorable binding enthalpy, whereas the entropy changes were even slightly more favorable.TABLE 3Thermodynamic parameters of tRNASec binding to SelB·GTPΔH°ΔG°TΔS°kcal/mol, 25 °Ckcal/mol, 25 °Ckcal/mol, 25 °CSec-tRNASec−16.0 ± 0.6−17.3 ± 0.21.3 ± 0.6Ser-tRNASec−4 ± 1−9.1 ± 0.25 ± 1tRNASec−4.0 ± 0.8−9.2 ± 0.25.3 ± 0.8 Open table in a new tab SelB, EF-Tu, eEF1A, and eIF2 are translation factors that deliver different aa-tRNAs to the ribosome. EF-Tu has evolved to bind all elongator aa-tRNAs, except for Sec-tRNASec, with approximately the same affinity (30LaRiviere F.J. Wolfson A.D. Uhlenbeck O.C. Science. 2001; 294: 165-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 31Louie A. Jurnak F. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6433-6439Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The thermodynamic contributions of the amino acid and the tRNA to the overall binding affinity are independent of and compensate for one another when the amino acid is cognate. In contrast, the affinities of EF-Tu for misacylated tRNAs may vary by several thousand-fold because of the lack of thermodynamic compensation (30LaRiviere F.J. Wolfson A.D. Uhlenbeck O.C. Science. 2001; 294: 165-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 32Asahara H. Uhlenbeck O.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 3499-3504Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Unlike EF-Tu, SelB has evolved to bind a single aa-tRNA, Sec-tRNASec, and the recognition pattern is specific for the SelB-Sec-tRNASec pair (Fig. 5). The tRNASec molecule is selected by SelB based on specific structural determinants, which distinguish tRNASec from all other tRNAs (33Baron C. Böck A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20375-20379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Rudinger J. Hillenbrandt R. Sprinzl M. Giegé R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 650-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Upon binding of tRNASec or Ser-tRNASec to SelB, about one net ion pair is formed. Such contribution of ionic interactions is comparable to that in the EF-Tu·GTP·Phe-tRNAPhe complex (35Abrahamson J.K. Laue T.M. Miller D.L. Johnson A.E. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 692-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Importantly, the Ser residue is not recognized by SelB, as the affinity of the factor for Ser-tRNASec and deacylated tRNASec is similar and has almost identical binding enthalpy and entropy. The favorable entropy change upon binding is somewhat unexpected, given that complex formation should lead to a loss of degrees of freedom, but may reflect the contribution of non-ionic interactions or release of ordered water molecules upon complex formation. The affinity of Ser-tRNASec and tRNASec to SelB is independent of the guanine nucleotide. This suggests that the two tRNAs bind to SelB irrespective of the conformational changes in the G domain induced by nucleotide binding and is consistent with the similarity of the overall shape of the three SelB forms (7Leibundgut M. Frick C. Thanbichler M. Böck A. Ban N. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In contrast, the Sec residue increases the binding affinity to SelB·GTP by six orders of magnitude, allowing for very efficient selection of Sec-tRNASec against binding of deacylated tRNASec or non-converted Ser-tRNASec. That such discrimination may be crucial is demonstrated by the fact that the replacement of Sec by Ser in the active site of formate dehydrogenase H leads to the loss of the enzyme activity (36Axley M.J. Böck A. Stadtman T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1991; 88: 8450-8454Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Another recognition element in the SelB system is the thermodynamic coupling between binding of Sec-tRNASec and GTP to SelB (Fig. 5). Whereas all three forms of tRNASec have similar affinities to SelB-apo or SelB·GDP, Sec-tRNASec appears to form additional interactions with SelB·GTP, resulting in a much more stable complex. The interaction may involve formation of salt bridges (see below) as well as other types of interactions (e.g. formation of additional hydrogen bonds), although their exact contribution to the strength of binding is unknown. The specific stabilization of the SelB·GTP·Sec-tRNASec complex ensures that Sec-tRNASec is channeled to the active GTP-bound form of SelB, rather than to the GDP-bound or apoforms, which do not support translation (16Fischer N. Paleskava A. Gromadski K.B. Konevega A.L. Wahl M.C. Stark H. Rodnina M.V. Biol. Chem. 2007; 388: 1061-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Furthermore, because the production of Sec-tRNASec consumes considerable cellular resources, Sec-tRNASec should be stringently protected by SelB from destruction by hydrolysis or oxidation. With respect to thermodynamic coupling, the ligand-binding properties of SelB are reminiscent of those of eIF2, which in the GTP-bound state forms an interaction with the methionine moiety of Met-tRNAi that is disrupted when GTP is replaced with GDP, while contacts between the factor and the body of the tRNA remain intact (37Kapp L.D. Lorsch J.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 923-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). These similarities in specific recognition and selection of one particular tRNA may indicate a common evolutionary ancestry of SelB and eIF2. In fact, phylogenetic studies suggest that SelB and eIF2 constitute an ancient subfamily of translation GTPases distinct from the EF-Tu/eEF1A subfamily (6Keeling P.J. Fast N.M. McFadden G.I. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 47: 649-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that the recognition of the Sec residue of Sec-tRNASec results in the net formation of about three ion pairs. These pairs might involve the Sec group directly or reflect the formation upon Sec binding of salt bridges between other groups, e.g. of additional interactions with the phosphate groups of tRNASec or salt bridges within SelB. The important contribution of these ionic interactions is consistent with the large favorable change in binding enthalpy of SelB·GTP binding to Sec-tRNASec compared with tRNASec or Ser-tRNASec. Modeling of the aminoacyl-binding pocket of SelB suggested a potential role for residues Asp-180, Arg-181, and Arg-236 (5Hilgenfeld R. Böck A. Wilting R. Biochimie. 1996; 78: 971-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Asp-180 and Arg-236 are conserved among SelB orthologs from all kingdoms, whereas Arg-181 is present in bacterial proteins and is replaced by His in archaeal and eukaryal SelB (His-192 in M. maripaludis (7Leibundgut M. Frick C. Thanbichler M. Böck A. Ban N. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar)). Residues Arg-181 and Arg-236 provide positive charges that could interact with the negatively charged selenolate group formed by deprotonation of the selenol group of Sec-tRNASec (pKa of the group in free selenocysteine is 5.2) (38Huber R.E. Criddle R.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1967; 122: 164-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The importance of these residues for Sec binding was corroborated by mutational analysis, which suggested that the presence of at least one positive charge in the aminoacyl-binding pocket of SelB is required for function (7Leibundgut M. Frick C. Thanbichler M. Böck A. Ban N. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The identity of other group(s) contributing to ionic interactions is currently unknown. Another role for thermodynamic coupling may be to ensure that Sec-tRNASec is released rapidly from SelB after GTP hydrolysis on the ribosome. Upon binding of the SelB·GTP·Sec-tRNASec to the ribosome in a codon- and SECIS-directed manner, GTP hydrolysis occurs and Sec-tRNASec is released from SelB·GDP to accommodate in the ribosomal A site. For most elongator aa-tRNAs, the accommodation step is rate-limiting for peptide bond synthesis (39Pape T. Wintermeyer W. Rodnina M.V. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7490-7497Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). If Sec-tRNASec were to bind SelB·GDP too tightly, the release of Sec-tRNASec from the factor and its accommodation on the ribosome would be slow, and, as a consequence, peptide bond formation would also be slow. GTP hydrolysis by SelB increases the rate of Sec-tRNASec release by six orders of magnitude, from 10−4 s−1 to 240 s−1; the latter rate appears sufficiently high to allow for rapid transfer of Sec-tRNASec from the factor to the ribosome. In this view, thermodynamic coupling in binding of Sec-tRNASec and GTP to SelB ensures both the specificity of Sec- versus Ser-tRNASec selection and the efficient protection of Sec-tRNASec against premature degradation, combined with the rapid release of Sec-tRNASec on the ribosome after GTP hydrolysis.

https://openalex.org/W1969045331,"Modification of proteins at serine or threonine residues with N-acetylglucosamine, termed O-GlcNAcylation, plays an important role in most eukaryotic cells. To understand the molecular mechanism by which O-GlcNAcylation regulates the entry of Caenorhabditis elegans into the non-aging dauer state, we performed proteomic studies using two mutant strains: the O-GlcNAc transferase-deficient ogt-1(ok430) strain and the O-GlcNAcase-defective oga-1(ok1207) strain. In the presence of the dauer pheromone daumone, ogt-1 showed suppression of dauer formation, whereas oga-1 exhibited enhancement of dauer formation. Consistent with these findings, treatment of wild-type N2 worms with low concentrations of daumone and the O-GlcNAcase inhibitor O-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucopyranosylidene)amino-N-phenylcarbamate (PUGNAc) enhanced dauer formation, which was dependent on intact O-GlcNAcylation metabolism. We also found that the treatment of daumone enhanced O-GlcNAcylation in vivo. Seven proteins, identified by coupled two-dimensional electrophoresis/liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy (LC-MS) analysis, were differentially expressed in oga-1(ok1207) worms compared with wild-type N2 worms. The identities of these proteins suggest that O- GlcNAcylation influences stress resistance, protein folding, and mitochondrial function. Using O-GlcNAc labeling with fluorescent dye combined with two-dimensional electrophoresis/LC-MS analysis, we also identified five proteins that were differentially O-GlcNAcylated during dauer formation. Analysis of these candidate O-GlcNAcylated proteins suggests that O-GlcNAcylation may regulate cytoskeleton modifications and protein turnover during dauer formation."

We previously reported that in CWR22Rv1 (Rv1) cells, the protease calpain 2 can cleave the androgen receptor (AR) into a constitutively active ∼80,000 low molecular weight (LMW) form. In this study, we further dissect the mechanisms that produce the AR LMW forms using Rv1 cells and the related CWR22-R1 (R1) cells. The 39-amino acid insertional mutation in the Rv1-AR (E3DM-AR) sensitizes this AR to calpain 2 proteolysis. R1 cells encode the same AR molecule as the parental CWR22 xenograft. Using calpain 2 small interfering RNA and calpeptin, we find that calpain 2 plays a role in the generation of the LMW-AR in R1 cells. Furthermore, LMW-AR expression is regulated by the activation of calpain 2 by ERK 1 and 2. Inhibition of ERK phosphorylation or small interfering RNA-mediated decrease of ERK expression reduces LMW-AR levels in R1 cells. Conversely, activation of the MAPK pathway results in increased ERK phosphorylation and increased levels of LMW-AR. Finally, analyses of human tumor samples found that LMW-AR levels are higher in tumors that have an increased calpain/calpastatin ratio and/or increased levels of phospho-ERK (pERK). This suggests that a higher calpain/calpastatin ratio collaborates with activated ERK to promote the generation of the LMW-AR.

Initially, androgen ablation therapy is effective, but eventually, this treatment leads to the development of aggressive relapsed tumors that thrive in the absence of androgens. Analysis of clinical samples revealed that >90% of the relapsed tumors express AR (1Chen C.D. Welsbie D.S. Tran C. Baek S.H. Chen R. Vessella R. Rosenfeld M.G. Sawyers C.L. Nat.

In the absence of ligand, the AR is retained in the cytoplasm. The binding of hormone alters the conformation of AR to promote translocation of the AR into the nucleus, where it regulates gene transcription (6Shang Y. Myers M. Brown M. Mol.

Aberrant AR activity has been postulated to promote proliferation of tumor cells in reduced levels of androgen. Studies have shown that 25–30% of androgen-independent tumors that arose following androgen ablation have AR gene amplification (9Visakorpi T. Hyytinen E. Koivisto P. Tanner M. Keinänen R.

Cell Biochem. 2004; 91: 483-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The AR present in CWR22 xenograft cells has a mutation in the ligand binding domain (LBD; H847Y) that enhances responsiveness to estradiol and progesterone (14Tan J. Sharief Y. Hamil K.G. Gregory C.W. Zang D.Y. Sar M. Gumerlock P.H. deVere White R.W. Pretlow T.G. Harris S.E. Wilson E.M. Mohler J.L. French F.S. Mol.

Structure function analysis of the AR showed that deletion of the LBD generates a constitutively active AR molecule (15Jenster G. van der Korput H.A. van Vroonhoven C. van der Kwast T.H. Trapman J. Brinkmann A.O. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1396-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). A subsequent study identified a nonsense mutation at Q640 that results in a truncated constitutively active AR in a tumor refractory to androgen ablation therapy (16Céraline J.

We and others previously reported that calpain cleaves the AR molecule to produce various LMW isoforms (17Pelley R.P. Chinnakannu K. Murthy S. Strickland F.M. Menon M. Dou Q.P. Barrack E.R.

We found that the ∼80,000 LMW-AR is present in some human prostate tumors (18Libertini S.J. Tepper C.G. Rodriguez V. Asmuth D.M. Kung H.J. Mudryj M. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 9001-9005Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Using the androgen-independent Rv1 cell line that expresses high levels of the LMW-AR, we demonstrated that inhibition of calpain activity induces apoptosis in cells cultured in the absence of androgen. These studies implied that calpain-dependent proteolysis of the AR may play an important role in conferring androgen independence in a subset of prostate cancer cases (18Libertini S.J. Tepper C.G. Rodriguez V. Asmuth D.M. Kung H.J. Mudryj M. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 9001-9005Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that calpain 2 and ERK collaborate in the generation of the LMW-AR. LNCaP, Rv1, PC3, and DU145 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. R1 cells were provided by Dr. Elizabeth Wilson (University of North Carolina). Rv1, PC3, DU145, and R1 cells were propagated in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 2 mmol/liter l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. LNCaP cells were propagated in 10% fetal bovine serum. RWPE, pRNS-1-1, and PZ-HPV-7, obtained from Dr. Ralph deVere White, were maintained in a keratinocyte serum-free medium supplemented with 50 mg/ml bovine pituitary extract and 5 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (Invitrogen). All cell lines were incubated at 37 and 5% CO2. For in vivo inhibition of calpain activity, 2 × 105 cells were plated in 35-mm plates and cultured in androgen-containing or androgen-depleted media (phenol red-free media/charcoal-stripped serum) for 48 h. Bicalutamide (Casodex) was from AstraZeneca (Cheshire, UK). For calpain inhibition studies, cells were treated with dimethyl sulfoxide or 40 μmol/L calpeptin (Calbiochem) for 24 or 48 h, washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and harvested. For MEK inhibition studies, cells were treated with 20 μm U0126 (Cell Signaling) or dimethyl sulfoxide for 24 and 48 h. Protein kinase C activity was stimulated by treatment with 10 nm 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) (LC Laboratories) dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. Cells were placed in a 4 °C radioimmunoprecipitation lysis buffer that contained calpeptin and a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Thirty micrograms of protein were separated on 8%, 10%, or 12% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to BA-85 membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) and blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline and 0.1% Tween 20. The following antibodies were used: AR (central) clone 441 (Ab-1; Lab Vision Corp.), AR NH2 terminus (N-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Calpain 2 (Domain III, Sigma), calpastatin (1F7E3D10, Calbiochem), ERK (Cell Signaling), pERK (Thr202/tyr204, Cell Signaling), and FAK (clone 4.47; Upstate), GAPDH (clone 6C5, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Proteins were detected using Enhanced chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare). 2 × 105 Rv1 and R1 cells were plated in 60-mm dishes. 24 h later, the cells were transfected with 130 nm calpain 2 siRNA ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool or ERK 1 and 2 siRNA ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool (Dharmacon Research Inc.) with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The ON-TARGETplus nontargeting siRNA was used as a negative control. Cells were harvested for RNA analysis 72 h post-transfection (RNeasy mini kit) (Invitrogen). Cells were resuspended in calpain assay buffer (50 mmol/liter HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mmol/liter NaCl, 1% Triton X-100). Calpain was activated with addition of CaCl2 to 1 mm. The reactions were incubated at 25 °C. Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and subjected to analysis as described previously (18Libertini S.J. Tepper C.G. Rodriguez V. Asmuth D.M. Kung H.J. Mudryj M. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 9001-9005Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Cellular proliferation was assessed using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) or the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetra-zolium bromide (MTT) assay (Promega) following manufacturer's recommendations. Total cellular RNA was prepared from cells (RNeasy) and cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg RNA using QuantiTect (Qiagen) reverse transcription kit. cDNAs were diluted 1:4 in double distilled H2O, and 2 μl of cDNA was added to 5 μl of EXPRESS SYBR® GreenER qPCR supermix (Invitrogen) and 200 nm of each primer for a total volume of 10 μl. GAPDH was used as the standard. PCR conditions were as follows: a 20-s initial denaturation step at 95 °C; 40 cycles at 95 °C for 3 s, 60 °C for 30 s, followed by a melt curve at 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 15 s, an increase to 95 °C over 20 min; an additional 95 cycles starting at 60 °C with a 0.5 °C increase per cycle for melt curve analysis. The Eppendorf Mastercycler ep Realplex was used for this study. Primer sequences: GAPDH: 5′-TGCACCACCAACTGCTTA-3′ and 5′-AGAGGCAGGGATGATGTTC-3′; CLDN4: 5′-AACCCTGACTTTGGGATCTG-3′ and 5′-AGATGCAGGCAGACAGAGTG-3′; HPRT1: 5′-TGACACTGGCAAAACAATGCA-3′ and 5′-GGTCCTTTTCACCAGCAAGCT-3′. Analyses using a two-tailed Student’s t test were used to compare two groups. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Two castrate-resistant cell lines, R1 and Rv1, were derived from two independent CWR22 relapsed tumors. The cellular phenotypes of the Rv1 and R1 cells are similar. In the presence of androgen the cells tend to grow in clusters, whereas in the absence of androgens, they tend to be more scattered and less adhesive (Fig. 1A). The AR in both lines has the same LBD mutation as the CWR22 xenograft (20Gregory C.W. He B. Wilson E.M. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 27: 309-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 21Tepper C.G. Boucher D.L. Ryan P.E. Ma A.H. Xia L. Lee L.F. Pretlow T.G. Kung H.J. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6606-6614PubMed Google Scholar). As previously reported, R1 and Rv1 cells express the LMW AR forms (Fig. 1B) (20Gregory C.W. He B. Wilson E.M. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 27: 309-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 21Tepper C.G. Boucher D.L. Ryan P.E. Ma A.H. Xia L. Lee L.F. Pretlow T.G. Kung H.J. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6606-6614PubMed Google Scholar). Western immunoblot analysis indicated that R1 cells expressed higher levels of AR than Rv1 cells, but the ratio of the LMW to full-length (FL)-AR was higher in Rv1 cells. The size of the FL-AR in the R1 cells is smaller than the FL-AR in the Rv1 cells, because R1 cells do not have the 39 amino acid duplication of exon 3. Closer inspection revealed that the ∼80,000 LMW forms could be resolved into several discrete bands (Fig. 1B). The MTS proliferation assay confirmed that the R1 and Rv1 cell proliferation rates were only slightly slower in androgen-depleted media compared with cells grown in the presence of androgen (Fig. 1C). The proliferation assay conducted in the presence of 10 μm Casodex indicated that R1 and Rv1 cells were refractory to the effects of this AR inhibitor (Fig. 1D). Although all three lines are responsive to androgen, only LNCaP cells are dependent on androgen to sustain growth. We have reported previously that the inhibition of calpain activity by calpeptin reduces the expression of the LMW-AR in Rv1 cells (18Libertini S.J. Tepper C.G. Rodriguez V. Asmuth D.M. Kung H.J. Mudryj M. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 9001-9005Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Likewise, treatment of R1 cells, proliferating in the presence or absence of androgen, with calpeptin reduced the levels of LMW-AR in R1 cells (Fig. 2A). We previously showed that proteolysis of the calpain substrate focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a good indicator of calpain activity (22Libertini S.J. Robinson B.S. Dhillon N.K. Glick D. George M. Dandekar S. Gregg J.P. Sawai E. Mudryj M. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 10700-10708Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Calpeptin treatment of R1 cells reduced the levels of LMW-FAK (Fig. 2A). To further analyze the role of calpain in the generation of LMW-AR, calpain 2 expression was analyzed in several tumor derived, as well as immortalized, prostate cell lines. R1 cells expressed much higher levels of calpain 2 than Rv1 and LNCaP cells (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, the two AR negative and highly metastatic cell lines, PC3 and DU145, expressed the highest levels of calpain 2. Given that calpain activity is regulated by its endogenous inhibitor calpastatin, we analyzed calpastatin levels as well, and found that expression was comparable in all the cell lines (Fig. 2B). R1 cells had higher amounts of proteolyzed FAK, indicating greater calpain activity (Fig. 2C). The extent of FAK cleavage was greater in the absence of androgen, suggesting that calpain activity may be higher under androgen-depleted conditions. To further confirm the involvement of calpain 2 in the generation of the LMW-AR forms in R1 cells, we used calpain 2 siRNA to reduce calpain 2 expression. A previous study reported that calpain 2 has a very long half-life of 5 days (23Zhang W. Lane R.D. Mellgren R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18825-18830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A 6-day treatment resulted in an ∼60% reduction of calpain 2 protein levels in R1 cells (Fig. 2D) and reduced levels of the LMW-AR forms (Fig. 2D). This treatment also reduced FAK proteolysis indicating that calpain 2 activity was reduced. This analysis indicates that calpain 2 plays a role in the generation of the LMW-AR in R1 cells. In R1 cells, the expression of claudin 4 (CLDN4) is highly repressed by the addition of androgen (Fig. 2E). If calpeptin treatment reduces the levels of LMW-AR, then in the absence of androgen the expression of androgen repressed genes may be further activated. In the absence of androgen calpeptin treatment of R1 cells further increased the expression of CLDN4, thus arguing the LMW-AR has a role in transcription of certain genes. Rv1 cells express higher levels of the LMW-AR but have low expression of calpain 2 protein and calpain activity (Fig. 2). We hypothesized that the exon 3 duplication sensitizes the E3DM-AR to calpain cleavage. The AR-null PC3 cells expressing high levels of calpain 2 were transfected with cDNA plasmids encoding either the wild-type or E3DM-AR. As expected, the E3DM-AR was slightly larger than the wild-type receptor (Fig. 3A). Additionally, the LMW forms generated in cells transfected with the E3DM-AR were larger than the LMW forms generated from the wild-type AR cDNAs. To test the hypothesis that the E3DM-AR is more sensitive to calpain-dependent proteolysis, extracts prepared from the transfected cells were treated with CaCl2 to activate endogenous calpain activity. As shown in Fig. 3B, the AR was progressively cleaved into the smaller forms by the addition of CaCl2. The amount of FL-AR remaining was quantitated and indicated that the E3DM-AR was degraded more rapidly than the wt AR. The inclusion of calpeptin retarded proteolysis, indicating that proteolysis was calpain-dependent (Fig. 3B). While the ∼80,000 forms were present initially and throughout the time course, as proteolysis progressed, the LMW-AR was further proteolyzed to smaller peptides. In vivo, the ∼ 80,000 LMW-AR forms that are generated by proteolysis can translocate into the nucleus, where they would be less susceptible to further proteolysis. In vitro, as was previously observed (17Pelley R.P. Chinnakannu K. Murthy S. Strickland F.M. Menon M. Dou Q.P. Barrack E.R. Reddy G.P. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 11754-11762Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) activated calpain proteolyzes the AR to still smaller forms. The mutant E3DM-AR was cleaved more rapidly than the wild-type FL-AR, resulting in the disappearance of the FL-AR (compare lanes 4 and 9). Calpain activity is tightly regulated by various mechanisms, including phosphorylation. Previous studies have shown that ERK can phosphorylate calpain 2 to stimulate protease activity (24Glading A. Chang P. Lauffenburger D.A. Wells A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2390-2398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). ERK expression was analyzed in immortalized (RWPE-1, PZ-HPV-7, and pRNS-1-1) and tumor derived (PC3, LNCaP, Rv1, R1, and DU145) cell lines. All of the tumor-derived cell lines had higher levels of ERK in comparison to the immortalized cell lines (Fig. 4A). A comparison of R1 and Rv1 cells proliferating in the absence and presence of androgen showed that R1 cells had higher levels of the active form of the protein (pERK) under both conditions (Fig. 4B). ERK is phosphorylated and activated by MEK, a dual threonine and tyrosine kinase (24Glading A. Chang P. Lauffenburger D.A. Wells A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2390-2398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Treatment of R1 cells with the MEK inhibitor U0126 for 24 or 48 h reduced ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 4C). An analysis of AR in the same extracts (Fig. 4C) indicated that inhibition of ERK activity reduced the levels of LMW-AR. Similar results were found in Rv1 cells (data not shown). To confirm that LMW-AR expression is dependent on ERK, cells were treated with control siRNA and ERK siRNA. Inhibition of ERK expression resulted in decreased levels of LMW-AR (Fig. 4D). This analysis established that ERK activation has a role in the etiology of the LMW-AR forms. Because the protein kinase C activator TPA can result in ERK phosphorylation (25Lee H.W. Ahn D.H. Crawley S.C. Li J.D. Gum Jr., J.R. Basbaum C.B. Fan N.Q. Szymkowski D.E. Han S.Y. Lee B.H. Sleisenger M.H. Kim Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32624-32631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), Rv1 and R1 cells were treated with TPA in the absence of androgen for 1 or 2 h to stimulate ERK activity. This treatment promoted an increase in levels of the LMW-AR indicating that activation of this pathway resulted in enhanced AR proteolysis (Fig. 5A). TPA treatment of Rv1 cells also resulted in decreased levels of the FL-AR; after a 2-h TPA treatment, the FL-AR was barely discernable, arguing that in vivo, as in vitro, the Rv1 AR is more sensitive to proteolysis. To test our hypothesis that an increase in calpain 2 and ERK activity collaborate in promoting LMW-AR expression, we examined calpain 2, calpastatin, and pERK levels in 6 of 13 tumor samples previously analyzed for the expression of the LMW-AR. Three of the thirteen samples that had the highest levels LMW-AR (01, 31, and 94) and three that had low levels of LMW-AR (21, 25, and 28) were used in the analysis (Fig. 5B). The expression of LMW-AR was defined as percent of total. Interestingly, the levels of the endogenous calpain inhibitor calpastatin was variable. It was higher in samples 21 and 25, which have lower levels of LMW-AR and lowest in Sample 01. Samples 01 and 31 had high levels of pERK (Fig. 5C). The remaining samples had low pERK levels. Therefore, the three samples that had the highest LMW-AR had high levels of pERK or a high amount of calpain 2. Conversely, samples that had low LMW-AR levels had little pERK and elevated calpastatin levels. This limited analysis suggests that in human tumors an increased ratio of calpain to calpastatin and increased ERK activity, work in concert contribute to increased LMW-AR expression. R1 and Rv1 cell lines were derived from relapsed CWR22 tumors and express the FL-AR as well as LMW-AR forms. However, the FL and LMW-AR forms expressed in Rv1 cells is larger than those in R1 cells due to a 39-amino acid insertional mutation at the junction of the DNA binding domain and hinge region (21Tepper C.G. Boucher D.L. Ryan P.E. Ma A.H. Xia L. Lee L.F. Pretlow T.G. Kung H.J. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6606-6614PubMed Google Scholar). Transient expression of the E3DM-AR cDNA in PC3 cells also results in the expression of slightly larger LMW forms than transfection of the wt AR cDNA. Activation of calpain AR-transfected PC3 extracts indicates that the E3DM-AR is more susceptible to proteolysis than the wt AR. In vivo activation of calpain activity through activation of ERK also promotes a more rapid proteolysis of the E3DM-AR. Early studies reported that a serine protease can proteolyze the AR to generate a ∼30,000 or ∼40,000 fragment containing the LBD (26de Boer W. Bolt J. Kuiper G.G. Brinkmann A.O. Mulder E. J. Steroid Biochem. 1987; 28: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). More recently, an independent study found that in vitro, calpain proteolyzes the AR to smaller amino-terminal fragments; those fragments include an ∼75,000 polypeptide (17Pelley R.P. Chinnakannu K. Murthy S. Strickland F.M. Menon M. Dou Q.P. Barrack E.R. Reddy G.P. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 11754-11762Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that the junction between the DNA binding domain and LBD might be especially sensitive to proteolysis. Therefore, it is not unexpected that the insertion of 39 additional amino acids near this region would alter AR structure and further sensitizes the molecule to calpain proteolysis (27Goll D.E. Thompson V.F. Li H. Wei W. Cong J. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 731-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2333) Google Scholar, 28Tompa P. Buzder-Lantos P. Tantos A. Farkas A. Szilágyi A. Bánóczi Z. Hudecz F. Friedrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20775-20785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Unlike Rv1 cells, R1 cells have an AR that is identical to the AR in the parental CWR22 xenograft. Therefore, we postulated that other molecular alterations must account for the increased expression of the LMW-AR. The current study shows that R1 cells express higher levels of calpain 2 and pERK than Rv1 cells. These two features collaborate to elevate calpain activity and promote proteolysis of the AR and FAK. The role of calpain in the degradation of AR is substantiated by the reduction of LMW-AR caused by inhibition of calpain by calpeptin or a decrease of calpain 2 by siRNA. A comparison of R1 and Rv1 cells indicated that R1 cells had higher levels of ERK and pERK. The participation of ERK in AR proteolysis was demonstrated by an siRNA-mediated decrease of ERK and by the inhibition of ERK phosphorylation by the MEK inhibitor U01286. Therefore, a decrease of ERK levels or ERK activity reduces LMW-AR expression. Activation of ERK by TPA in Rv1 and R1 cells results in a time-dependent increase in the generation of LMW-AR. The short interval required for increased LMW-AR generation is consistent with activation of a signaling cascade that results in the activation of a protease. The MAPK phosphorylation cascade that leads to ERK activation has been well studied and is considered a target for cancer therapeutics (29Roberts P.J. Der C.J. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 3291-3310Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar). Since ERK activation in prostate tumors has been previously reported (30Price D.T. Della Rocca G. Guo C. Ballo M.S. Schwinn D.A. Luttrell L.M. J. Urol. 1999; 162: 1537-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), this is a potential mechanism that could contribute to the expression of LMW-AR in human tumors. Likewise, increased calpain 2 expression has been observed in prostate tumors. Because the activity of calpain 2 is partly regulated by calpastatin, the ratio of calpain/calpastatin affects calpain 2 activity. The expression of calpastatin has not been previously studied in prostate tumors. However, an increase in the calpain/calpastatin ratio has been reported in a study of colorectal cancer (31Lakshmikuttyamma A. Selvakumar P. Kanthan R. Kanthan S.C. Sharma R.K. Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev. 2004; 13: 1604-1609PubMed Google Scholar), which showed that calpastatin levels are high in normal mucosa but decreased in tumor tissue. Moreover, increased expression of calpain 2 was detected in colorectal tumors and polyps, suggesting that the increase of calpain 2 levels may be an early event in the tumorigenesis process. At this point, we cannot rule out that calpain 1 contributes to the generation of the LMW-AR. Interestingly, calpain 1 has been shown to activate ERK (32Sawhney R.S. Cookson M.M. Omar Y. Hauser J. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 8497-8510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and, therefore, all of these molecules may be components of a regulatory pathway. The importance of the calpain/calpastatin equilibrium and the activation of the MAPK signaling pathway in prostate tumorigenesis remain to be defined. Recent studies reported that the LMW-AR forms expressed in Rv1 cells are derived from an alternatively spliced AR mRNA (33Dehm S.M. Schmidt L.J. Heemers H.V. Vessella R.L. Tindall D.J. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 5469-5477Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 34Hu R. Dunn T.A. Wei S. Isharwal S. Veltri R.W. Humphreys E. Han M. Partin A.W. Vessella R.L. Isaacs W.B. Bova G.S. Luo J.

Qiu Y. Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 2305-2313Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). However, the studies do not agree on the identity of the spliced forms that give rise to the LMW-AR forms. Our analysis shows that several LMW-AR forms are expressed in Rv1 and R1 cells. Because we did not completely eliminate the expression of the LMW-AR by inhibiting calpain 2 and pERK, some of the LMW-AR forms could be derived from alternatively spliced AR mRNA. This is analogous to results obtained from studies of cyclin E. In transformed cells, several LMW cyclin E forms can be detected (36Wingate H. Zhang N. McGarhen M.J. Bedrosian I. Harper J.W. Keyomarsi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15148-15157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Studies have shown that some of the LMW cyclin E forms are derived from alternatively spliced mRNAs, whereas others are generated by proteolysis of cyclin E protein (22Libertini S.J. Robinson B.S.

Oncogene. 2003; 22: 769-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The LMW cyclin E forms have altered cellular localization and are associated with higher kinase activity (40Bacus S.S.

Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 2305-2313Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar) that several mechanisms can be employed to generate LMW-AR forms. These LMW-AR forms may not be identical, but they would share critical features including the presence of the activation and DNA binding domains and a deletion of the LBD. Such AR molecules would be able to translocate into the nucleus in an androgen-independent manner, bind to DNA, and activate or repress gene transcription. Furthermore, the interaction of the LMW-AR and FL-AR with various AR-interacting proteins may differ, and, therefore, if the LMW-AR and the FL-AR bind to identical DNA sequences, they may have differential effects on gene transcription. Multiple calpain substrates have been previously implicated in cellular transformation. This suggests that an alteration of the calpain/calpastatin equilibrium, which is observed in some tumors, would affect multiple pathways that drive tumor progression. The modulation of calpain activity could result in a constellation of changes that would be difficult to ascribe to any individual molecule. This feature of calpain-driven deregulation of cell physiology also provides a therapeutic opportunity. The inhibition of calpain activity, even partially, could be sufficient to modify multiple tumor survival and proliferative pathways, which, in synergy with other therapeutics, could be effective in halting tumor progression.

https://openalex.org/W2036513543,"The nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinase c-Src is frequently overexpressed and/or activated in a variety of cancers, including those of the breast. Several heterologous binding partners of c-Src have been shown to regulate its catalytic activity by relieving intramolecular autoinhibitory interactions. One such protein, p130Cas (Cas), is expressed at high levels in both breast cancer cell lines and breast tumors, providing a potential mechanism for c-Src activation in breast cancers. The Cas-binding protein BCAR3 (breast cancer antiestrogen resistance-3) is expressed at high levels in invasive breast cancer cell lines, and this molecule has previously been shown to coordinate with Cas to increase c-Src activity in COS-1 cells. In this study, we show for the first time using gain- and loss-of-function approaches that BCAR3 regulates c-Src activity in the endogenous setting of breast cancer cells. We further show that BCAR3 regulates the interaction between Cas and c-Src, both qualitatively as well as quantitatively. Finally, we present evidence that the coordinated activity of these proteins contributes to breast cancer cell adhesion signaling and spreading. Based on these data, we propose that the c-Src/Cas/BCAR3 signaling axis is a prominent regulator of c-Src activity, which in turn controls cell behaviors that lead to aggressive and invasive breast tumor phenotypes.

In normal tissues, the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase c-Src exists as a tightly regulated molecule that is responsible for many cellular processes, including proliferation, adhesion, migration, and invasion (1Finn R.S. Ann. Oncol. 2008; 19: 1379-1386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). This regulation is often lost in solid tumors, including those of the breast, resulting in the transduction of signals that promote tumor progression (2Summy J.M. Gallick G.E. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2003; 22: 337-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Interactions between c-Src and other proteins play an important role in the regulation of c-Src activity. Here, we investigate how altered expression of the adapter molecule BCAR3 (breast cancer antiestrogen resistance-3) coordinates with the c-Src-binding protein p130Cas (Cas) 3The abbreviations used are: CasCrk-associated substrateSHSrc homologyDoxdoxycyclinesiRNAsmall interfering RNA. to regulate c-Src activity and c-Src-mediated biological processes.

Dekker A. van der Spek P.J. Vreede L. Dorssers L.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2799-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). BCAR3 contains an SH2 domain and a guanine nucleotide exchange factor-like domain with homology to the CDC25 family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (3Gotoh T. Cai D. Tian X. Feig L.A.

Cas, also known as BCAR1 (breast cancer antiestrogen resistance-1), was initially identified as a highly tyrosine-phosphorylated protein in v-Src- and v-Crk-transformed cells (10Reynolds A.B.

Transient transfection of COS-1 cells was performed using Superfect (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer’s specifications. Cells were lysed 24 h post-transfection in modified radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (RIPA: 150 mm/liter NaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1% IGEPAL CA-630, 0.5% deoxycholate) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (100 μm leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.15 unit/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate). Protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid assay kit (Pierce). A BCAR3-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) (5′-AAAUCAACCGGACAGUUCU-3′) was synthesized to target human but not murine BCAR3 (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO). ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool siRNAs targeted to human BCAR3 were also purchased from Dharmacon.

Cancer Lett. 2007; 256: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), or the Lipofectamine RNAiMax (Invitrogen) reverse transfection method per the manufacturer’s specifications. Cells were grown for 48–72 h before lysis in RIPA buffer. Immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (13Riggins R.B. Quilliam L.A. Bouton A.H. J. Biol.

Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies, and detected by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (Amersham Biosciences) followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) or horseradish peroxidase substrate luminol reagent (Millipore). 10-cm tissue culture dishes and glass coverslips were coated with 20 μg/ml fibronectin (Sigma) for 1 h or overnight at 4 °C and then washed with phosphate-buffered saline. BT549 cells were transfected with control or BCAR3-specific siRNAs as described above. Cells were grown for 72 h and then trypsinized, counted, and left in suspension for 90 min in complete growth media containing serum. Suspension cells were then either lysed or plated onto tissue culture plates and fibronectin-coated coverslips in complete growth media for the indicated lengths of time. Cells plated onto coverslips were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, washed, and mounted onto slides. In parallel, cells were plated immediately following transfection and analyzed 72 h later as cycling adherent cells. For the c-Src inhibitor studies, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or 10 μm SU6656 was added to the cells during the 90-min suspension and subsequent plating steps. ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health) was used to calculate cell area using the freehand tracing tool. 100+ cells were counted per time point for at least three independent experiments. Densitometry was performed using the Bio-Rad GS-800 densitometer (Bio-Rad) and quantified using ImageQuant TL 2005 (Amersham Biosciences). A two-tailed Student’s t test was used for comparisons between the various sample sets. Statistical significance was defined at ≥95% confidence interval or p value ≤0.05. Bar graphs represent the mean ± S.D. To assess the molecular requirements for c-Src activation by Cas and BCAR3, COS-1 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding c-Src, Myc-tagged Cas, and/or FLAG-tagged BCAR3. In each case, plasmids encoding FLAG-tagged cortactin were also transfected to provide an exogenous substrate for c-Src activity in the transfected population. Twenty four hours post-transfection, cells were lysed, and the phosphorylation of cortactin was examined using phosphotyrosine-specific antibodies. Cells overexpressing Cas exhibited increased activation of c-Src, as measured by the increased phosphorylation of cortactin, compared with cells expressing only vector (Fig. 1A, top panel, lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, no increase in cortactin phosphorylation was observed when BCAR3 was expressed (Fig. 1A, top panel, lane 3). However, when BCAR3 was co-expressed with Cas, phosphorylation of cortactin was even greater than in the presence of Cas alone (Fig. 1A, top panel, lane 4). These data confirm our previous finding that BCAR3 expression enhances Cas-dependent c-Src activity (13Riggins R.B. Quilliam L.A. Bouton A.H. J. Biol.

Similar results were obtained using paxillin as an exogenous substrate (Fig. 1B, top panel, lanes 2 and 5), demonstrating that the enhancement in c-Src substrate phosphorylation observed in the presence of BCAR3 and Cas was not restricted to cortactin. To determine whether the augmentation of Cas-dependent c-Src activity by both Cas and BCAR3 required interactions between Cas and c-Src, a construct of Cas containing three amino acid substitutions (P642A, Y668F/Y670F) in the c-Src-binding site (14Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Ozawa K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8959-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) was utilized in experiments similar to those described above. This Cas mutant, termed Cas-TM for “triple mutant,” is significantly impaired in binding to c-Src (21Riggins R.B. Thomas K.S. Ta H.Q. Wen J. Davis R.J. Schuh N.R. Donelan S.S. Owen K.A. Gibson M.A. Shupnik M.A. Silva C.M. Parsons S.J. Clarke R. Bouton A.H. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 7007-7015Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). As expected, phosphorylation of the c-Src substrate paxillin was observed under conditions of Cas overexpression, and this was increased significantly when both Cas and BCAR3 were co-overexpressed (Fig. 1B, top panel, lanes 2 and 5). In contrast, expression of Cas-TM either alone or in combination with BCAR3 failed to promote paxillin phosphorylation (Fig. 1B, top panel, lanes 3 and 6). These data indicate that the interaction between Cas and c-Src is required for both Cas- and BCAR3/Cas-dependent activation of c-Src. Although we show above that Cas and BCAR3 regulate c-Src activity in ectopic expression systems, these regulatory pathways have not yet been investigated in the context of endogenously expressed proteins. Many breast tumors and cancer cell lines that exhibit aggressive and invasive phenotypes express high levels of Cas, BCAR3, and c-Src, and these proteins can be found in complex with one another (see Fig. 2 for endogenous protein complexes in BT549 cells) (7Near R.I.

In contrast, cells representative of earlier stage breast cancers generally express BCAR3 at very low or undetectable levels, despite the fact that expression of Cas and c-Src is often high (7Near R.I. Zhang Y. Makkinje A. Vanden Borre P. Lerner A. J. Cell. Physiol. 2007; 212: 655-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 8Makkinje A. Near R.I. Infusini G. Vanden Borre P. Bloom A. Cai D.

Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 6174-6182Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This dichotomy provides an excellent system with which to examine the effect of BCAR3 expression on Cas/c-Src interactions and c-Src activity under physiological conditions. To determine whether BCAR3 is important for the regulation of c-Src activity in cells expressing high endogenous levels of this protein, BCAR3 expression was reduced by RNA interference in BT549 cells. Following transfection with BCAR3-targeted siRNA oligonucleotides, BCAR3 expression was consistently reduced by 82–99%, as measured by densitometry (Fig. 3A, top panel). Depletion of BCAR3 correlated with a concomitant reduction in c-Src autophosphorylation at tyrosine 419 (Tyr-419 is the autophosphorylation site on human c-Src, equivalent to Tyr-416 in chicken), a marker for c-Src activity (Fig. 3A, 2nd panel and associated graph). As Cas is a well established c-Src substrate, we next investigated whether the decrease in c-Src activity exhibited by cells depleted for BCAR3 was accompanied by a loss in tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas. Cas was immunoprecipitated from lysates derived from cells treated with control or BCAR3-targeted siRNAs, and the resultant complexes were immunoblotted with a Tyr(P) antibody. Cas tyrosine phosphorylation was reduced by an average of 70% under conditions of BCAR3 knockdown (Fig. 2B). Similar results were obtained when BCAR3 was depleted using a second pool of four independent BCAR3-specific siRNAs, confirming that the decrease in Cas phosphorylation was due to depletion of BCAR3 (supplemental Fig. 1, A–C). These results in cycling cells extend our previous study, which showed a reduction in epidermal growth factor-dependent Cas tyrosine phosphorylation under conditions of BCAR3 depletion (9Schrecengost R.S. Riggins R.B. Thomas K.S. Guerrero M.S. Bouton A.H. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 6174-6182Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Cas is an effective activator of c-Src catalytic activity through its ability to bind to c-Src and relieve its autoinhibitory conformation (15Burnham M.R. Bruce-Staskal P.J. Harte M.T. Weidow C.L. Ma A. Weed S.A. Bouton A.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5865-5878Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesized that the decreases in c-Src activity and Cas tyrosine phosphorylation observed under BCAR3-depleted conditions might be the result of a reduction in c-Src/Cas association. To determine whether this was the case, c-Src was immunoprecipitated from lysates generated from BT549 cells treated with control or BCAR3-targeted siRNAs, and the resultant complexes were immunoblotted for Cas. As expected, Cas was seen to associate with c-Src in cells treated with nontargeting siRNA oligonucleotides (Fig. 3C, lane 1, and supplemental Fig. 2A). In cells depleted of BCAR3, c-Src/Cas association was reduced by ∼60% (Fig. 3C, lane 2). This result supports our hypothesis that the observed loss in c-Src activity is a consequence of decreased Cas association. MCF7 cells express low to undetectable levels of BCAR3 and serve as a model for early stage breast cancer (8Makkinje A. Near R.I. Infusini G. Vanden Borre P. Bloom A. Cai D. Costello C.E. Lerner A. Cell. Signal. 2009; 21: 1423-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 9Schrecengost R.S. Riggins R.B. Thomas K.S. Guerrero M.S. Bouton A.H. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 6174-6182Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To examine the effect of BCAR3 overexpression in this background, MCF7 cell lines were generated that express BCAR3 under a tetracycline-regulated promoter (Tet-Off). BCAR3 expression can be turned off in these cells by the addition of 2 μg/ml Dox (Fig. 4A, top panel). To determine whether BCAR3 expression alters c-Src activity in this cell system, c-Src was immunoprecipitated from lysates and immunoblotted for Tyr-419 phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of Tyr-419 was elevated almost 2-fold under conditions of BCAR3 overexpression (Fig. 4B), demonstrating that BCAR3 is capable of inducing c-Src activity when overexpressed in breast cancer cells. To determine whether this increase in c-Src activity correlated with an increase in BCAR3-dependent Cas phosphorylation, Cas was immunoprecipitated from lysates isolated from cells grown in the presence (endogenous levels of BCAR3) or absence (overexpressed BCAR3) of Dox, and the resultant complexes were immunoblotted with an antibody recognizing Tyr(P). Indeed, Cas tyrosine phosphorylation was increased by 3-fold under conditions of BCAR3 overexpression (Fig. 4C, compare lanes 1 and 3). Because BCAR3 expression in MCF7 cells has been reported to induce phosphorylation of Cas on serine residues (8Makkinje A. Near R.I. Infusini G. Vanden Borre P. Bloom A. Cai D. Costello C.E. Lerner A. Cell. Signal. 2009; 21: 1423-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), we confirmed the specificity of the Tyr(P) antibody for phosphotyrosine by preincubating the antibody with O-phospho-l-tyrosine- or O-phospho-l-serine-conjugated bovine serum albumin prior to using it for immunoblotting. The Cas Tyr(P) signal was lost under conditions of preincubation with the Tyr(P), but not the Ser(P), inhibitor (supplemental Fig. 3). Finally, to test whether the increase in Cas phosphorylation was directly due to c-Src activity, the cells were cultured for 24 h in the presence or absence of 10 μm of the c-Src family kinase inhibitor SU6656 (30Blake R.A. Broome M.A. Liu X. Wu J. Gishizky M. Sun L. Courtneidge S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9018-9027Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar).

Proteins were fused in-frame with green or red fluorescent proteins and expressed at low level in HL-1 and HEK293 cells. Dual color imaging revealed that vesicle trafficking involved motorized movement along microtubules followed by stalling, fusion, and subsequent release of individual ion channels at the plasma membrane. We found that KCNQ1-KCNE1 complexes were released in batches of about 5 molecules per vesicle. To elucidate the properties of ion channel complexes at the cell membrane we tracked the movement of individual molecules and compared the diffusive behavior of two types of potassium channel complex (KCNQ1-KCNE1 and Kir6.2-SUR2A) to that of a G-protein coupled receptor, the A1 adenosine receptor. Plots of mean squared displacement against time intervals showed that mobility depended on channel type, cell type, and temperature. Analysis of the mobility of wild type KCNQ1-KCNE1 complexes showed the existence of a significant immobile subpopulation and also a significant number of molecules that demonstrated periodic stalling of diffusive movements. This behavior was enhanced in cells treated with jasplakinolide and was abrogated in a C-terminal truncated form (KCNQ1(R518X)-KCNE1) of the protein. This mutant has been identified in patients with the long QT syndrome. We propose that KCNQ1-KCNE1 complexes interact intermittently with the actin cytoskeleton via the C-terminal region and this interaction may have a functional role."
https://openalex.org/W2068856689,"Wnt/β-catenin signaling is an important regulator of cell polarity, proliferation, and stem cell maintenance during development and adulthood. Wnt proteins induce the nuclear accumulation of β-catenin, which regulates the expression of Wnt-responsive genes through association with TCF/LEF transcription factors. Aberrant Wnt/β-catenin signaling has been implicated in a plethora of pathologies and, most notably, underlies initiation and expansion of several cancers. Here, we apply enzyme fragment complementation to measure the nuclear accumulation of β-catenin. β-Catenin was tagged with a peptide fragment of β-galactosidase and transfected into cells expressing a corresponding deletion mutant of the enzyme exclusively in the nucleus. Stimulation of the cells with recombinant Wnt-3a restored β-galactosidase activity in a dose-dependent manner with nanomolar potency. Using the assay, we confirmed that Wnt-5a represses β-catenin-driven reporter gene activity downstream of nuclear entry of β-catenin. In addition, we tested a library of >2000 synthetic chemical compounds for their ability to induce β-catenin nuclear accumulation. The immunosuppressive protein kinase C inhibitor so-trastaurin (AEB-071) was identified as an activator of Wnt/β-catenin signaling at micromolar concentrations. It was confirmed that the compound stabilizes endogenous β-catenin protein and can induce TCF/LEF-dependent gene transcription. Subsequent biochemical profiling of > 200 kinases revealed both isoforms of glycogen synthase kinase 3, as previously unappreciated targets of so-trastaurin. We show that the β-catenin nuclear accumulation assay contributes to our knowledge of molecular interactions within the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and can be used to find new therapeutics targeting Wnt/β-catenin signaling.—Verkaar, F., Blankesteijn, W.

As a result of the bioinformatics analysis performed, we determined the 18 most influential features that affect protein amenability to cell-free expression. They include protein length; hydrophobicity; pI; content of charged, nonpolar, and aromatic residues;, cysteine content; solvent accessibility; presence of coiled coil; content of intrinsically disordered and structured (alpha-helix and beta-sheet) sequence; number of disulfide bonds and functional domains; presence of transmembrane regions; PEST motifs; and signaling sequences. This study represents the first comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of heterologous protein synthesis in a cell-free system.

We reasoned that these cells would be ideal for evaluating the contribution of the cardiomyocyte and vascular lineages to the functional improvement noted following stem cell transplantation in infarcted hearts.

The mean ejection fraction was 59 ± 15, 46 ± 17, and 39 ± 13% in the Dox+, Dox−, and serum-free medium groups, respectively (P<0.05 for the differences among all 3 groups). Immunohistochemistry of hearts injected with Dox+ grafts expressed myocardial and vascular markers, whereas grafts of Dox−cells expressed primarily vascular markers.

Here, we investigated the role of the first and fourth transmembrane domains (TMDs) in the formation of the binding pocket of the human AT1 receptor using the substituted-cysteine accessibility method. Each residue within the Phe-28(1.32)–Ile-53(1.57) fragment of TMD1 and Leu-143(4.40)–Phe-170(4.67) fragment of TMD4 was mutated, one at a time, to a cysteine. The resulting mutant receptors were expressed in COS-7 cells, which were subsequently treated with the charged sulfhydryl-specific alkylating agent methanethiosulfonate ethylammonium (MTSEA).

The seven transmembrane domains (TMDs) of GPCRs constitute structural support for signal transduction. Like other family A GPCRs such as rhodopsin and adrenergic receptors, the AT1 receptor undergoes spontaneous isomerization between its inactive state and its active state (5Gether U. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17979-17982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Movement of TMD helices through translational or rotational displacement is believed to be essential to achieve the active state (6Dunham T.D. Farrens D.L. J. Biol.

For the AT1 receptor, it has been proposed that TMD3, TMD5, TMD6, and TMD7 may participate in the activation process by providing a network of interactions throughout the AngII-binding pocket (9Inoue Y. Nakamura N. Inagami T. J. Hypertens. 1997; 15: 703-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar).

For this receptor, the binding site would thus be contained within a hydrophilic crevice, the binding pocket, extending from the extracellular surface of the receptor to the transmembrane portions. Because all crystallized structures to date suggest that TMD1 and TMD4 are somewhat removed from the binding pocket (13Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I.

Nonetheless, experiments have revealed the proximity of TMD4 residues to the ligand-binding pocket in the β1 and β2 adrenergic receptors as well as the dopamine D2 receptor (14Matsui H.

Moreover, numerous mutagenesis studies have provided the basis for a model in which an interaction between Asn-111 in TMD3 and Tyr-292 in TMD7 maintains the AT1 receptor in the inactive conformation.

MTS reagents react 109 faster with ionized thiolates (S−) than with un-ionized thiols (SH) (23Roberts D.D. Lewis S.D. Ballou D.P. Olson S.T. Shafer J.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5595-5601Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), and ionization of cysteine occurs to a significant extent only in the aqueous medium (24Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Thus, in TMDs, the sulfhydryl of a cysteine residue, which is introduced by mutagenesis one at a time, facing toward the binding pocket should react much faster with charged sulfhydryl-specific reagents such as positively charged methanethiosulfonate ethylammonium (MTSEA) than sulfhydryls facing toward the interior of the protein or the lipid bilayer (25Stauffer D.A. Karlin A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6840-6849Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). We use two criteria for identifying an engineered cysteine as forming the surface of the binding site crevice: (i) the reaction with a methanethiosulfonate reagent alters binding irreversibly; (ii) this reaction is retarded by the presence of ligand. We previously used this approach to identify the residues in TMD2, TMD3, TMD5, TMD6, and TMD7 that form the surface of the binding site pocket in the wild-type AT1 receptor and in the constitutively active N111G-AT1 receptor (26Boucard A.A.

Here, we report the application of SCAM to probe both TMD1 and TMD4 in the wild-type and constitutively active AT1 receptor backgrounds. Bovine serum albumin, bacitracin, and soybean trypsin inhibitor were from Sigma-Aldrich Canada Ltd. (Oakville, Ontario, Canada). The sulfhydryl-specific alkylating reagent MTSEA (CH3SO2-SCH2CH2NH3+) was purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals Inc. (Toronto, Ontario). The cDNA clone for the human AT1 receptor subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 was kindly provided by Dr. Sylvain Meloche (University of Montréal). LipofectamineTM 2000 and culture medium were obtained from Invitrogen Canada Inc. (Burlington, Ontario). 125I-[Sar-1,Ile-8]AngII (specific radioactivity, ∼1000 Ci/mmol) was prepared with Iodo-GEN® (Perbio Science, Erembodegem, Belgium) as reported previously (31Guillemette G. Escher E. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 5591-5596Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Residues in TMD1 and TMD4 of the human AT1 receptor were given two numbering schemes. First, residues were numbered according to their positions in the human AT1 receptor sequence. Second, residues were also indexed according to their position relative to the most conserved residue in the TMD in which they are located (32Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Integrated Methods for the Construction of Three-dimensional Models and Computational Probing of Structure-function Relations in G Protein-coupled Receptors. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1995Crossref Scopus (2480) Google Scholar). By definition, the most conserved residue was assigned the position index “50,” e.g. in TMD4, Trp-153 is the most conserved residue and was designated Trp-153(4.50), whereas the downstream residue was designated Leu-154(4.51) and the upstream residue was designated Ile-152(4.49). This indexing simplifies the identification of aligned residues in different GPCRs. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on the wild-type AT1 receptor with the overlap PCR method (Expand high fidelity PCR system, Roche Applied Science). Briefly, forward and reverse oligonucleotides were constructed to introduce cysteine mutations between Phe-28(1.32) and Ile-53(1.57) for TMD1 and between Leu-143(4.40) and Phe-170(4.67) for TMD4, as well as to substitute residue Arg-167(4.64) for either Lys, His, Asp, Glu, or Ile. PCR products were subcloned into the HindIII-XbaI sites of the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1. Site-directed mutations were then confirmed by automated DNA sequencing by aligning the AT1 sequence with multiAlin (33Corpet F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 10881-10890Crossref PubMed Scopus (4317) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 2 mm l-glutamine and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. The cells were seeded into 100-mm culture dishes at a density of 2 × 106 cells/dish. When the cells reached ∼90% confluency, they were transfected with 4 μg of plasmid DNA and 15 μl of LipofectamineTM 2000 according to the manufacturer. After 24 h, transfected cells were trypsinized, distributed into 12-well plates, and grown for an additional 24 h in complete Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 100 IU/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, before MTSEA treatment or binding assays. COS-7 cells were grown for 36 h after transfection in 100-mm culture dishes, washed once with PBS, and subjected to one freeze-thaw cycle. Broken cells were then gently scraped into washing buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2), centrifuged at 2500 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and resuspended in binding buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.01% bacitracin, 0.01% soybean trypsin inhibitor). Saturation binding experiments were done by incubating broken cells (20–40 μg of protein) for 1 h at room temperature with increasing concentrations of 125I-[Sar-1,Ile-8]AngII in a final volume of 500 μl. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 μm unlabeled [Sar-1,Ile-8]AngII. Bound radioactivity was separated from free ligand by filtration through GF/C filters presoaked for at least 3 h in binding buffer. Receptor-bound radioactivity was evaluated by γ counting. Results are presented as means ± S.D. Binding data (Bmax and Kd) were analyzed with Prism version 5.0 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego CA), using a one-site binding hyperbola nonlinear regression analysis. The MTSEA treatment was performed according to the procedure of Javitch et al. (21Javitch J.A. Li X. Kaback J. Karlin A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 10355-10359Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Two days after transfection, cells grown in 12-well plates were washed with PBS and incubated for 3 min at room temperature with freshly prepared MTSEA at the desired concentrations (typically from 0.5 to 6 mm) in a final volume of 200 μl. The reaction was stopped by washing the cells with ice-cold PBS. Intact cells were then incubated in binding medium (Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, 25 mm HEPES, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4) containing 0.05 nm 125I [Sar-1,Ile-8]AngII for 90 min at room temperature. After washing with ice-cold PBS, the cells were lysed with 0.1 n NaOH, and the radioactivity was evaluated by γ counting. The percentage of fractional binding inhibition was calculated as (1 − (specific binding after the MTSEA treatment/specific binding without the treatment)) × 100. Transfected cells grown in 12-well plates were washed once with PBS and incubated in the presence or absence of 100 nm [Sar-1,Ile-8]AngII for 1 h at 16 °C (to avoid internalization of receptors). The cells were washed to remove excess ligand and then treated with MTSEA. The cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and once with an acidic buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm acetic acid, pH 3.0) to dissociate bound ligand. They were then incubated for 3 h at 16 °C in binding medium (Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, 25 mm HEPES, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4) containing 0.05 nm 125I-[Sar-1,Ile-8]AngII. The percentage of protection was calculated as ((inhibition in the absence of [Sar-1,Ile-8]AngII) − (inhibition in the presence of [Sar-1,Ile-8]AngII)/(inhibition in the absence of [Sar-1,Ile-8]AngII)) × 100. To identify the residues in TMD1 and TMD4 that face the binding pocket of the AT1 receptor, we mutated 26 consecutive residues between Phe-28(1.32) and Ile-53(1.57) of TMD1 and 28 consecutive residues between Leu-143(4.40) and Phe-170(4.67) of TMD4 to cysteine, one at a time. Each mutant receptor was transiently expressed in COS-7 cells. To assess the conservation of global conformation of these receptors after such substitution, pharmacological parameters describing the equilibrium binding of the radiolabeled ligand 125I-[Sar-1,Ile-8]AngII such as Kd and Bmax were determined (TABLE 1, TABLE 2). Most mutant receptors exhibited high binding affinity for 125I-[Sar-1,Ile-8]AngII, similar to that of the wild-type AT1 receptor with the exception of mutant I165C(4.62), which showed a 5-fold reduction in binding. TMD1 mutants F28C(1.32)-AT1, V29C(1.33)-AT1, I31C(1.35)-AT1, P32C(1.36)-AT1, L35C(1.39)-AT1, I38C(1.42)-AT1, and G45C(1.49)-AT1 and TMD4 mutants A163C(4.60)-AT1, R167C(4.64)-AT1, and F170C(4.67)-AT1 did not display any detectable binding activity and were therefore not used for SCAM analysis. To verify whether the reporter cysteines introduced into either TMD1 or TMD4 were oriented toward the binding pocket, mutant receptors were treated with concentrations of MTSEA varying between 0.5 and 6 mm. As reported previously (26Boucard A.A. Roy M. Beaulieu M.E. Lavigne P. Escher E. Guillemette G. Leduc R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36628-36636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), the various concentrations of MTSEA had very little effect (no more than a 20% reduction at high MTSEA concentrations) on the binding properties of the wild-type AT1 receptor, which contains 10 endogenous cysteines (Fig. 1). For TMD1 mutants, Fig. 2 shows that MTSEA at 0.5 mm or higher concentration strongly inhibited ligand binding toward mutants M30C(1.34)-AT1 (binding inhibition of 69%) and T33C(1.37)-AT1 (binding inhibition of 48%). For TMD4 mutants, Fig. 3 shows that MTSEA at 0.5 mm or higher concentration inhibited ligand binding toward mutant V169C(4.66)-AT1 (binding inhibition of 34%). The binding properties of all other mutant receptors were not significantly affected by MTSEA treatment.FIGURE 2Effects of MTSEA on different mutant AT1 receptors bearing a reporter cysteine in TMD1. Intact COS-7 cells transiently expressing wild-type (WT) or mutant AT1 receptors were incubated for 3 min at room temperature with freshly prepared 0.5 mm MTSEA (A) or 2 mm MTSEA (B). The intact cells were then incubated for 90 min at room temperature with 0.05 nm 125I-[Sar-1,Ile-8]AngII.

We determined the pharmacological properties of the 26 cysteine-substituted mutant receptors for TMD1 (Table 3) and 28 cysteine-substituted mutant receptors for TMD4 (Table 4). Within the N111G-AT1 receptor background, most cysteine-substituted mutants conserved a high binding affinity for the competitive ligand 125I-[Sar-1,Ile-8]AngII (Table 2). TMD1 mutants F28C(1.32)-N111G-AT1, I31C(1.35)-N111G-AT1, P32C(1.36)-N111G-AT1, L35C(1.39)-N111G-AT1, G45C(1.49)-N111G-AT1, and N46C(1.50)-N111G-AT1 and TMD4 mutants P162C(4.59)-N111G-AT1, A163C(4.60)-N111G-AT1, R167C(4.64)- N111G-AT1, and F170C(4.67)-N111G-AT1 showed no detectable binding affinity and were not used for the SCAM analysis. It is, however, noteworthy that the N46C(1.50)-N111GAT1 mutant receptor exhibited binding activity in the constitutively active state but not in the inactive, ground state (Table 1 versus Table 3), whereas the P162C(4.59)-AT1 mutant receptor exhibited binding activity in the ground state background only (Table 2 versus Table 4).TABLE 3Binding properties of TMD1 cysteine-substituted N111G-AT1 constitutively active receptorsKdBmaxnnmfmol/mgN111G0.53 ± 0.161279 ± 366F28Cndbanbd indicates no detectable binding.ndb2V29C1.82 ± 0.32236 ± 652M30C1.36 ± 0.17204 ± 212I31Cndbndb2P32Cndbndb2T33C1.27 ± 0.25976 ± 262L34C1.08 ± 0.421025 ± 852L35Cndbndb2S36C0.94 ± 0.19763 ± 342I37C1.25 ± 0.07853 ± 242I38C1.04 ± 0.38974 ± 572F39C1.13 ± 0.22448 ± 332V40C1.29 ± 0.06343 ± 282V41C1.92 ± 0.26469 ± 132G42C2.14 ± 0.39836 ± 222I43C0.96 ± 0.12754 ± 642F44C1.07 ± 0.25707 ± 172G45Cndbndb2N46Cndbndb2S47C1.06 ± 0.21363 ± 282L48C1.19 ± 0.08742 ± 162V49C0.96 ± 0.22379 ± 262V50C1.02 ± 0.35763 ± 212I51C0.99 ± 0.37681 ± 162V52C1.13 ± 0.24390 ± 152I53C1.42 ± 0.15452 ± 902a nbd indicates no detectable binding.

Open table in a new tab Mutant receptors were subsequently treated with increasing concentrations of MTSEA and assessed for binding with 125I-[Sar-1,Ile-8]AngII. Like the wild-type receptor, the N111G-AT1 receptor was relatively insensitive to a 3-min treatment with MTSEA concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 2 mm, again indicating the relatively low contribution of the endogenous cysteines in the binding site pocket (Fig. 4). For TMD1 mutants in the N111G background, Fig. 4 shows that treatment with 0.5 mm MTSEA strongly inhibited the 125I-[Sar-1,Ile-8]AngII binding properties of the M30C(1.34)-N111G-AT1 mutant (binding inhibition of 64%). At 2 mm MTSEA, the binding properties of T33C(1.37)-N111G-AT1 were significantly inhibited (binding inhibition of 45%). The L48C(1.52)-AT1 mutant receptor, which displayed sensitivity to 2 mm MTSEA in the ground state, did not demonstrate any sensitivity to MTSEA in the constitutively active state. For TMD4 mutants in the N111G background, all mutant receptors were insensitive to MTSEA treatment (Fig"

Its lower maintenance costs and the ease of tissue imaging in live zebrafish are among the benefits that have cast this organism as an emerging player in disease research and drug screening. With its genome almost fully sequenced, the zebrafish has gone from bit player to rising star among model organisms. Its lower maintenance costs and the ease of tissue imaging in live zebrafish are among the benefits that have cast this organism as an emerging player in disease research and drug screening. The zebrafish is a small, active fish native to India. The hardiness of this striped fish makes it popular in home aquaria; aficionados seeking a genetically modified pet can even buy transgenic GloFish. But the zebrafish, Danio rerio, is also the bright star among model organisms for biologists. Within the next year, the genome sequence of the zebrafish is expected to leap to a level of completeness for a vertebrate surpassed only by the human and the mouse genomes (http://www.ensembl.org/Danio_rerio). This will hoist it toward the A-list of model organisms. Already, the fish shows potential in studies of the basic biology of human diseases, including cancer, and in high-throughput screens for drug discovery. The zebrafish emerged as a potential model three decades ago and was put to work in the study of early development. Advances in cloning, mutagenesis, and transgenesis in zebrafish allowed invertebrate-style experiments on a vertebrate. Large genetic screens for randomly generated mutants began in Europe and the US in the early 1990s, on a scale usually associated with cultured cells or invertebrates. Basic numbers tell the story: one hundred fish fit in a 20 l tank and each female produces over two hundred embryos a week. Most organs are recognizable 24 hr after fertilization. Within 5 days of development, larvae are mobile and foraging. Funders are keen on zebrafish as a model but could become keener when the complete genome sequence becomes available. “Within the NIH, there has been a steady trans-institute support for expanding the utility of zebrafish as a model organism,” says Shawn Burgess of the NIH's Developmental Genomics Section in Bethesda, Maryland. “I think outside the NIH, because fish physiology is somewhat distant from its mammalian counterparts, there is still a lot of skepticism about whether zebrafish will have as central a role in human biomedical research as say mouse research does. Some skepticism is justified, but perhaps not enough emphasis is placed on how much cheaper research in zebrafish can be compared to mice, and how much can be learned from the differences as well as the similarities,” says Burgess. “The zebrafish is underutilized in modeling in almost all areas of human disease,” according to Tim Chico of the UK's MRC Centre for Developmental and Biomedical Genetics, who blames our mammal supremacist mindset. But fundamental cellular processes like development of the vascular system, which he studies, are conserved across vertebrate species, and zebrafish bring a good haul of benefits to researchers. Chico points out that a fish costs 7 pence per week to maintain, whereas a mouse costs £4. Also, the zebrafish genome sequencing project begun in 2001 by the UK's Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute has put reverse genetics on the menu. Key techniques in use include TILLING (targeting local lesions in genomes), gene overexpression, knockdown models, and use of the yeast Gal4-UAS marker system. Derek Stemple of the Sanger Institute says the eighth and final version of the zebrafish genome sequence at 6.5–7× coverage will be available next year. “It is 85 to 90% complete. The trouble is that there is so much repetitive DNA, just like in humans, and sometimes it is difficult to know physically where that belongs in a genome.” Burgess adds: “The eighth version will be a ‘finished’ version like human was in 2003, meaning that the error rate is about 1 in 50,000 bases and all non-repetitive DNA is sequenced. There should be no unincorporated sequence, which has not been true to date.” Researchers believe the complexity and polymorphic nature of the starting material—from multiple fish—caused initial delays and some express frustration at the speed of the sequencing effort. “The availability of the genome is transformative and there has been some consternation at the pace it has become available. But that just speaks to how hungry everyone is to have access,” according to Randall Peterson of Harvard Medical School in Boston. “Sanger is spending more resources to help the zebrafish genome catch up with human and mouse,” says neuroscientist Monte Westerfield of the University of Oregon. “There is an ongoing effort by the Sanger VEGA team to annotate individual genes and transcripts in collaboration with us in Oregon. And then ZFIN incorporates data from the literature. That is significantly improving the genome sequence and assembly. And that aids in all sorts of experiments.” ZFIN is a centralized repository for all things “zebbie” and a first port of call for anyone interested in starting research on zebrafish. It has almost 5000 members. Embryologist Marnie Halpern of the Carnegie Institute of Washington stresses the time the Sanger sequence saves, pointing out that her lab can confirm the identity of a new mutation affecting the brain in a matter of months instead of years. However, there are still some regions of the genome her lab is working on where the sequence is poor, causing trouble in cloning regulatory regions of a gene of interest, for example. “Recently there has been a second wave of researchers looking for creative new ways to exploit zebrafish,” says Burgess. Tissue regeneration is one area, with studies revealing that fish can regenerate heart, nervous tissue, retina, and fins. “We are specifically looking at how adult hearing regenerates in zebrafish after exposure to intense sound or ototoxic drugs. My lab uses a mixture of genetics and genomics approaches to define the gene network that activates during hearing regeneration,” says Burgess. Hearing loss is permanent in mammals, but all other vertebrates, including birds, are able to repair hearing damage, he notes; “Therefore I believe that the loss of regenerative ability in mammals must be a relatively recent occurrence and perhaps activation of a very small set of genes could actually cause a ‘reactivation’ of the regeneration process. Support for this idea comes from the recent discovery that it takes as few as four genes to convert somatic cells to embryonic stem cells.” Validating new drug targets remains a bottleneck in drug discovery, and the fish can help. Most small molecule discovery efforts in industry and academia rely on high-throughput screening and simplified in vitro reactions or cell-based assays, but Peterson is testing those same approaches on living zebrafish. He has shown that drugs known for their effects in humans have similar effects in zebrafish larvae. In 2004, Peterson's group screened 5000 small molecules and discovered two that overcame a blood circulation problem in a mutant called gridlock. Large numbers of fish can be tested simultaneously because early zebrafish embryos measure less than a millimeter and several fit in each well of a 96-well plate. Peterson notes: “In some assays, we screen as many as 5000 animals per day.” There are also benefits from an ethical standpoint, as work can be done on embryos rather than adults and does not require dissection, destruction, or invasive imaging of the fish. Peterson uses a robotic microscope to record responses of zebrafish embryos or larvae to various stimuli. Adding compounds to each well, he can assess the way they affect the animal's baseline behavior. His team is using this approach to identify new stimulants, sedatives, and other behavior-modifying compounds that could be used for treating nervous system disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. In another screen, a molecule was discovered that blocks the progression of bone overgrowth disease and is advancing toward the clinic. “We designed a zebrafish screen, screened through thousands of molecules and identified an intriguing molecule. We then used chemistry to optimize it, moved it into mouse models and showed it was effective,” says Peterson. Uwe Strähle of the University of Heidelberg recalls how he was warned off the zebrafish with: “Don't do it. The mouse is much, much better.” He feels his decision has been amply justified, pointing to the almost 5000 mutants and transgenic lines for fish, including those with altered cholesterol, metabolism, heart physiology, or cancer. And he can study systems biology in a live and intact organism. “There is an initiative in early planning stages where people in the community are exploring whether or not a large scale project to knock out every gene in the genome is feasible and valuable,” says Peterson. “It is clear to me that this isn't science fiction and we could, in a short period of time, be able to deconstruct every gene in the zebrafish genome.” Stemple sees the fish racing ahead of the mouse: we will be able to identify phenotypes for all protein-encoding genes well before it is done in the mouse, he says (although currently the mouse is ahead of the game with about 5000 genes deleted, versus 700 deleted in the zebrafish). The NIH was an early starter in supporting zebrafish research. “There was a lot of excitement over the past years at NIH; it seemed like every institute wanted to expand their portfolio to include zebrafish research,” notes Westerfield. “To a great extent, I think that is still true.” Moreover, the community has expanded dramatically in just 5 years, with capacity numbers at last year's international zebrafish conference in Madison, Wisconsin (http://www.union.wisc.edu/zebrafish/). The big growth area has been clinicians wanting to understand the basic biology of disease genes. The NIH has supported the development of tools that would “help promote zebrafish as an animal model for studying development and diseases,” says Lorette Javois at the NIH's National Institute for Child Health & Human Development and a member of the Trans-NIH Zebrafish Coordinating Committee. “A lot of times those types of applications that aren't strongly hypothesis driven don't fare well in the standard NIH peer review systems,” she adds. “We have two different solicitations for applications that are currently active. One is soliciting research tools and techniques generally that would enhance zebrafish research; the other is soliciting more specifically genetic screens that would enhance zebrafish research.” For fiscal year 2009, NIH funding for research tools and genetic screens totaled almost $11 million spread over 33 grants. Meanwhile, the European Commission (EC) launched a substantial zebrafish project in 2004 (ZF-MODELS), with over 20 research teams receiving €12 million (http://www.zf-models.org/). “This was mainly a large scale mutagenesis program in zebrafish to identify genes linked with development, health and disease,” says Jacques Remacle, a scientific officer with the EC. Another €11 million is now being negotiated for a followup project, ZF-HEALTH. “We want to build on the mutagenesis and understand the roles of genes in health and disease,” explains Remacle. Other large funders include the Dutch government, providing €14 million spread over several years through its Smart Mix program, and the Wellcome Trust, which is funding large-scale TILLING at Sanger as well as most of the zebrafish genome sequencing project. Physician scientist Leonard Zon, a Howard Hughes investigator at Harvard, is renowned for his zebrafish models of human disease. He began by creating zebrafish mutants that had problems making blood cells and worked on the first zebrafish mutant that predicted a new human disease gene. A recent chemical genetics screen using zebrafish revealed that prostaglandins stimulate blood stem cell production; prostaglandin E2 in particular boosted the number of blood stem cells in zebrafish and mice. Zon's lab is now treating human cord blood with prostaglandin E2 to try to increase stem cell numbers prior to transplant. “Recently we studied a clinical trial for patients with leukemia who are getting a cord blood transplant,” he explains. “And we are treating the cord blood with the chemical that we found in zebrafish. So it is an interesting story on how zebrafish could facilitate us in finding new therapies for disease.” Zon also has developed a melanoma model in zebrafish and recently discovered a gene that when mutated accelerates cancer formation. The gene encodes an enzyme, he says, “so in theory, if we could make a drug to that particular gene product, then you would have a new therapy.” The advantage of zebrafish cancer models is that they absorb small molecules directly from the water, thereby enabling rapid screening for anticancer agents in vivo (Figure 1). And it is in cancer that the zebrafish and its newly sequenced genome may gain its stripes. “Early tumors are very difficult to detect and in most organisms you can't follow them live,” explains Ralf Dahm, now at the Spanish National Cancer Research Centre in Madrid, who managed the ZF-MODELS project in Europe. “If you transplant a human tumor into the fish, however, you can visualize the very early steps in cancer at high resolution.” You can see how the young tumor recruits blood vessels and interacts with its microenvironment, and how the immune system reacts, he notes. A high-quality sequence will be critical, and Dahm says even the first version released by Sanger in 2002 helped his research. Clearly, the fish is not just a poor man's mouse. Cancer biologist Steven Leach at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore, Maryland, relies on zebrafish models in addition to mice. His institute has sequenced the exomes of 24 different human pancreatic cancers, but the challenge now is to annotate this vast catch and determine which mutations contribute to cancer pathogenesis. “Traditionally that would have been done in the mouse, but with this torrent of new data we really have a dramatic bottleneck in terms of evaluating the significance of these mutations,” says Leach. “Based on the ease and relative low cost of establishing transgenic zebrafish, fish cancer models provide significantly higher throughput in the functional evaluation of candidate oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes.” Over the last decade it has become apparent that all vertebrates have the same sets of genes, and that biochemical and developmental pathways are highly conserved. Javois at the NIH is clear about the zebrafish sequence's potential here: “It allows people to go between animal model systems and look for homologous genes, so if you are working on some other animal model on a particular gene or pathway, you can look for the equivalent or vice versa.” Almost all zebrafish genes have been found to have equivalent human genes (orthologs). “When I started with this model, a large number of people thought I was crazy,” notes Zon. A few said we don't even know whether fish form blood the same way as humans, he recalls. Zon cloned the genes for all of his blood mutants, with the help of the Sanger sequence, and found human orthologs for all of them. With 300 million years of evolution between fish and humans, he discovered that the same carrier protein still brings iron from mother or yolk to embryo, for example. “With a full set of genes from the Sanger it is possible to create streams of fish for quantitative trait analysis. Because of the large number of fish you could get, it could really lead to an unprecedented jump in science,” says Zon. Stemple, who studies muscular dystrophies, stresses the advantages of the speed and scale of experiments possible with the fish: “In zebrafish you can already see the effects of a mutation two days after fertilization, so that you can usually score a muscular dystrophy in zebrafish very early in development. That is really useful, because you can get rapid development, and you can look at literally hundreds of fish and hundreds of genes very quickly. That is why people are turning to zebrafish as a model organism.” Researchers increasingly work on adult fish, and Dahm is enthusiastic about the possibilities of monitoring cells in the almost transparent casper mutant (Figure 1). Moreover, techniques such as “brainbow,” which allows simultaneous labeling of many cells with individual “colors,” permit analyses of complex neural networks in vivo, he notes. “Using this approach to study cell lineages and cell diversity in cancer, including testing the importance of the recently identified cancer stem cells to tumor development, clearly is a very exciting potential application of brainbow.” Another recent development for targeting specific genes is zinc finger nuclease technology. “This is a really potentially transformative technology that is going to rapidly accelerate reverse genetic approaches in zebrafish, such as are commonly applied in mice and other model organisms. It obviously relies on very precise sequencing of the zebrafish genome,” notes Leach. But despite all of this progress, as Leach emphasizes, “the field still carries the burden of demonstrating that zebrafish models of cancer truly have utility beyond more traditional mouse models when it comes to impacting on patients with the disease.” Like all models, the zebrafish is not perfect. The tools and techniques to manipulate zebrafish genetically are not yet as sophisticated as they are for mice, notes Dahm. “There are, for instance, fewer promoters for tissue-specific expression, and targeted mutagenesis is only now becoming easier with the new zinc finger nucleases,” he says. Anything to do with mother-embryo interactions is difficult to study, he adds, because fertilization and embryonic development are external. Moreover, zebrafish are not mammals. “So there are some human organs, processes, and physiology that you can't study in zebrafish, such as lung, mammary gland, and uterus,” notes Westerfield. The size of the fish is a big advantage for microscopists but can also be a drawback when large amounts of tissue are required. Even adults are only about 2 inches long. “Taking blood from one of the tiny zebrafish larvae or having to dissect their livers for proteomics analyses, although possible, is no trivial task,” says Dahm. And though many researchers think antisense oligonucleotides called morpholinos are the “silver bullet” for knocking down genes and studying their function, says Westerfield: “Nothing beats a heritable mutation, however, and results from morpholino studies should be confirmed by examining protein expression and, ultimately, mutants. Also, for translational work, therapeutics developed in zebrafish will typically need to be tested in mammals before moving to humans.” Despite the drawbacks, charitable trusts and foundations are recognizing the zebrafish's potential as a model organism. For example, Chico has received funding from the British Heart Foundation, and his institute has just received a £1.5 million Medical Research Council grant to set up a screening facility for small molecule drugs. He is also using the fish to study arterial occlusions, which are difficult to create in other model organisms. He can now observe developments in live animals and can watch the effects of temporarily knocking out genes using morpholinos. And the fish has returned home, in a manner of speaking. The Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology in Delhi, India, has collected wild specimens of Danio rerio from rivers and has begun sequencing their genomes using next generation sequencing machines. The Indian group are using the fish as a model to understand within-species genetic variation and to complement the Sanger sequence. Some researchers see this as providing extra impetus for Sanger to complete its efforts. The fish model has migrated beyond Europe and the US, with significant zebrafish research groups now in Australia, New Zealand, China, and Singapore. According to Zon: “There's lots of opportunities for new investigators coming into the field and most institutions want a zebrafish researcher in their midst.” Though there is no such thing as a perfect model system, notes Burgess, “the zebrafish is valuable because it strikes a compromise balance between the large number of animals that can be examined and its relatedness to humans.” The zebrafish is underutilized in terms of its possibilities, comments Westerfield, who is upbeat about its future: “There's plenty of room for folks who have got crazy new ideas.”"

The science advisor to the US president has the opportunity to influence how scientific research is supported by the federal government, as well as the ways in which science and technology can be applied to meet the needs of society. On March 19, 2009, John P. Holdren became President Barack Obama's science advisor. Holdren, a physicist, was previously a professor of environmental policy and director of the program on Science, Technology, and Public Policy at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government and director of the Wood's Hole Research Center. The science advisor to the US president, who by tradition also serves as director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), has a unique role. He (to date, all science advisors have been male) is the voice for science and technology (S&T) policy within the administration. The science advisor is expected to give the president objective, confidential advice based on the best information available on the state of science and the nation's technological capabilities, regardless of political or other considerations. The science advisor position is not unique to the US. However, countries with parliamentary systems usually have a minister, whose responsibilities include science and technology; and many serve an advisory function as well. The science advisor to the US president is a member of the president's White House team, comprised of all the president's senior aides, who work together to ensure that the president's priorities are being implemented on all policy matters. The science advisor must support the president's decisions, regardless of whether he agrees with them, and avoid being seen as a lobbyist of the scientific community. As D. Allan Bromley stated in his 2004 book The President's Scientists: Reminiscences of a White House Science Advisor, “the moment the Advisor is perceived to be functioning on behalf of the scientific community…his effectiveness and the cooperation that he receives from the other senior staff members disappear almost instantaneously.” Harvey Brooks, who was considered by many to be the father of science policy in the US, found it helpful to define two kinds of science policy: “policy for science,” e.g., funding and regulation of research and development (R&D) activities, and “science for policy,” e.g., S&T applied to broader societal needs such as health, energy, environment, and national security (Brooks, 1988Brooks H. Issues in High-Level Science Advising.in: Golden W.T. Science and Technology Advice to the President, Congress, and Judiciary. Pergamon Press, New York1988: 51Google Scholar). Given the breadth of the policy domain covered by this definition of science policy, the science advisor must be knowledgeable and current on a wide range of issues such as counterterrorism and national security; climate change and the environment; biodiversity; energy production and consumption; information technology, internet access, and cybersecurity; biomedical research and health; science and engineering education and work force development; space exploration and science; food safety; R&D funding; and other issues. The science advisor works closely with his counterparts in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on all issues related to funding and regulations, e.g., ensuring that the budgets of cabinet-level departments and agencies reflect the president's S&T priorities. The science advisor also convenes agency heads or deputies, under the auspices of the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC), to develop priorities for interagency activities and follow up where necessary. S&T are important to the missions of most departments and agencies, with many supporting R&D activities in universities, national laboratories, and industry. However, heads of departments and agencies have wide-ranging responsibilities and lack resources to focus on S&T activities. This is the job of the science advisor. During the G.H.W. Bush, Clinton, and Obama administrations, the position of science advisor has included the title “Assistant to the President,” a designation reserved for senior aides reporting directly to the president. The title implies that the science advisor has direct, personal access and interaction with the president, which should be used sparingly because the president's calendar is always crowded. The title also signals that the science advisor is to be considered a member of the president's team of senior advisors and is to be included in all White House discussions relating to S&T. It is important to note, however, that science advisors who have not held the title “Assistant to the President” have indicated that the lack of the title did not prevent them from communicating with the president. The Office of Science and Technology Policy or OSTP is a small federal agency, with its own budget appropriation, that is also part of the Executive Office of the President (EOP) (http://www.ostp.gov). OSTP consists of a US Senate-confirmed director and up to four Senate-confirmed associate directors. The current staff numbers more than 60, including specialists on detail from other federal agencies. OSTP was created during the Ford Administration by “The National Science and Technology Policy, Organization, and Priorities Act of 1976.” H. Guyford Stever served as the first director. The Act authorizes OSTP to advise the president and others within the EOP on the impacts of S&T on domestic and international affairs; lead an interagency effort to develop and implement sound S&T policies and budgets; work with the private sector to ensure that federal investments in S&T contribute to economic prosperity, environmental quality, and national security; build strong partnerships among federal, state, and local governments, other countries, and the scientific community; and evaluate the scale, quality, and effectiveness of the federal effort in S&T. OSTP has been able to do some of these things better than others. The science advisor has served as director of OSTP since the agency's establishment. Science advising to presidents can be traced back to World War II (WWII) and Vannevar Bush (Table 1). Bush served as head of the Office of Scientific Research and Development under Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry Truman. In 1945, he authored Science: The Endless Frontier, a report advocating the creation of a governmental agency to fund science and engineering R&D (Bush, 1945Bush V. Science: The Endless Frontier. National Science Foundation, Washington, DC1945Google Scholar). The report served as a guide in establishing the National Science Foundation (NSF) in 1950.Table 1Presidential Science AdvisorsTrumanOliver E. BuckleyEngineer1951–1952Lee A.

Open table in a new tab Information based on data from the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) webpage http://www.ostp.gov and Wikipedia. Following WWII, Presidents Truman and Eisenhower appointed eminent scientists as advisors, but the Russian launch of Sputnik elevated the position to report directly to the president (Killian, 1977Killian Jr., J.R. Sputnik, Scientists, and Eisenhower: A Memoir of the First Special Assistant to the President for Science and Technology. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1977Google Scholar). Subsequent presidents appointed scientists—most were physicists—and engineers to help guide science policy. During the early Cold War years, two of the highest-priority policy issues were nuclear weapons and the space race, areas that involved physics and engineering. Most presidents have appointed highly qualified science advisors; however, their impact depended on their personal relationships with the presidents and sometimes outside influences. Science advisors for both Presidents Kennedy and Johnson found their access to the presidents hindered by discontent within the scientific community over the Vietnam War. This disconnect was amplified during the Nixon administration, culminating in the resignation of his science advisor, Edward E. David, after public disclosure that members of the President's science advisory committee disagreed with several of Nixon's policies. David's duties were assigned to H. Guyford Stever, then director of NSF. When President Ford assumed office, he brought Stever to the White House as his full-time science advisor and the first director of the OSTP (Stever, 2002Stever H.G. War and Peace: My Life in Science and Technology. Joseph Henry Press, Washington, DC2002Google Scholar). Frank Press, science advisor to President Carter, taking a lesson from the experiences of some of his predecessors, emphasized that his job was to serve the President rather than represent the scientific community. The modern era of science advisors, which we will define as the end of the Cold War, began with D. Allan Bromley, President G.H.W. Bush's science advisor, who was the first to hold the title, “Assistant to the President for Science and Technology.” Bush, with Bromley's advice, issued the first technology policy statement and created an external advisory committee, the President's Council of Advisors in Science and Technology (PCAST). Bush signed the Global Change Research Act of 1990 as well as the 1992 U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, which served as the foundation for the Kyoto Accord and subsequent agreements (Bromley, 2004Bromley D.A. The President's Scientists: Reminiscences of a White House Science Advisor. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT2004Google Scholar). Bromley also gave considerable attention to international issues and coordinating the S&T activities of federal agencies. President Clinton's two science advisors, John H. Gibbon and Neal Lane, worked to improve funding for science (especially the physical sciences) and engineering research. Gibbons emphasized connections between S&T and national needs, particularly in the areas of energy, environment, climate change, and new technologies (Gibbons, 1997Gibbons J.H. This Gifted Age: Science and Technology at the Millennium. American Institute of Physics, Woodbury, NY1997Google Scholar). Lane focused on establishing Clinton's National Nanotechnology Initiative and the “Twenty-First Century Research Fund,” which provided large increases for federal research. Other priorities included energy R&D, international cooperation in S&T, post-Kyoto negotiations, the doubling of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) budget (a congressional initiative), stem cell research, the human genome project, cybersecurity, and missile defense. President G.W. Bush's science advisor, John H. Marburger, III, came into office 9 months into the administration. Marburger did not have the “Assistant to the President” title but indicated that he had no problem getting his advice to the president. By the time Marburger arrived, Bush had already set his policies on climate change and stem cell research. In addition, because of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, national and domestic security became the president's top priority; therefore, OSTP was focused on related R&D issues. Toward the end of the administration, Bush requested increased funding for the physical sciences and engineering and he signed the America COMPETES Act, which authorized these increases. But biomedical research faltered after the completion of the NIH budget doubling, and funding levels decreased (relative to inflation) after 2004. Marburger was also called upon to defend the Bush administration against allegations that it often placed politics above scientific integrity. There are a number of lessons we can draw from the experiences of science advisors to presidents since WWII. First, science advisors who have been most influential have been those who dealt with issues most relevant to the president, such as Vannevar Bush advising on defense R&D during WWII, Press dealing with energy issues after the oil crisis, and Bromley addressing international issues after the fall of the Berlin Wall. In the beginning of the Cold War, S&T issues were focused on narrow technical matters such as nuclear weapons, missiles, and the space race. Since the fall of the Berlin Wall 20 years ago, S&T has become more diffuse, especially with the emphasis on health research, oil crises, and a strong environmental push starting in the 1960s. The role of the science advisor has also become more ambiguous as a result and requires a knowledge of and ability to retain a vast array of scientific information. Second, science advisors have found their jobs to be particularly difficult during times when the scientific community was vocal in opposing the president's policies, e.g., the Vietnam War (Johnson), nuclear policies (Nixon), and allegations that the administration was placing politics above science (G.W. Bush). It is not easy to promote policies, funding or otherwise, that would seem to benefit a community that is vocal in its opposition to the president. For example, President G.W. Bush expected more credit than he received for his decision to allow the NIH to fund embryonic stem cell research on lines created before his executive order on August 9, 2001, perhaps later impacting biomedical funding. Finally, any suspicion that the science advisor has come to the White House with the primary objective of increasing funding for research, rather than supporting the president with confidential objective advice, severely limits the science advisor's credibility and effectiveness. Nixon's advisor, DuBridge, was excluded from budget discussions after arguing for increases in NSF's budget. Although it is understood that the science advisor is likely to be an advocate for S&T, including R&D funding, any arguments for increased funding must be linked to the president's top priorities. To put it in the simplest terms, the science advisor must be relevant, objective, and loyal to the president and stay out of trouble—even trouble that is not of his own making. In December 2008, during the transition period prior to President Obama taking office, John Holdren was selected to be the President's science advisor. Holdren was a familiar figure in Washington, having had a long history of involvement in public policy, and is considered a world expert on energy and climate change policy as well as national security issues, e.g., nonproliferation. He served as president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) in 2006 and was a member of PCAST during the Clinton administration. Holdren was confirmed in March 2009, with the title “Assistant to the President,” and quickly began shaping policy within the administration. He provided advice on the appointments of other science policy-related positions, including that of the administrator at NASA and the director of NIH. Today, Holdren faces a multitude of challenges that directly relate to those faced by the President—the nation's economic collapse, record unemployment, spiraling health care costs, demands for carbon-free energy, threats from unfriendly nations and groups, a failed public K–12 educational system, and rising costs of higher education. In an environment characterized by extreme partisan politics, Holdren faces the challenge of strengthening the link between S&T and a broad agenda of national priorities, as well as advising President Obama on R&D funding priorities. Other challenges include supporting the administration's efforts to depoliticize scientific issues such as stem cell research, evolution, climate change, and research-based regulatory policies in general. In the 2009 appropriations, $151 billion was divided among several federal agencies to support R&D related to their missions; this does not count the additional $20 billion included in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA, http://www.aaas.org/spp/rd/omnibus09.htm). The largest fraction of federal R&D funding goes for defense, largely major weapons development and testing. Approximately $65 billion is designated for non-defense R&D, of which $30.5 billion (roughly 47%) supports biomedical R&D funded by NIH (not counting the $10 billion in ARRA stimulus funds for NIH). The balance between biomedical research and all other fields of science and engineering is an important policy issue. Biomedical research, clearly, is important to the health of the American people. But, research in other fields, e.g., the physical, mathematical, nonmedical biological, and social sciences and engineering, also contributes to improving the quality of the lives of Americans through new discoveries and technological innovation, while also providing the breakthroughs and tools needed to advance medical diagnostics and treatment. Finding the right balance for scientific R&D funding should match with national priorities, including health and medicine, national security, energy, climate change, sustainability, and other societal needs. Holdren is also tasked to find ways to improve science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education and to address expected unmet demands for scientists and engineers in the future. The challenge includes educating all young people, whatever their career choices may be; ensuring that students have sufficient mathematics, science, and technical skills to be productive members of society and hold quality jobs; attracting more young women and men to careers in science and engineering; and improving opportunities for talented people from abroad who are interested in studying and working in the United States in critical needs areas. In the roughly 60 years since the end of WWII, science advisors have had varying degrees of influence, largely dependent on whether a president considered science advice to be important to the decisions he was facing on a day-to-day basis. With the strong support of President Obama, who clearly understands the importance of science and investing in research, and success in linking S&T issues with the nation's most pressing needs, Holdren has the unique opportunity to put the US back on track as a world leader in S&T. In addition to his impressive credentials, Holdren also has access to a very large collection of outstanding scientists within the administration and serving as advisors to the White House and federal agencies as well as many other scientists around the country who stand ready to help. One has real cause to be optimistic for the first time in nearly a decade."
