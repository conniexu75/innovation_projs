https://openalex.org/W2971234298,"Neural activity throughout the cortex is correlated with perceptual decisions, but inactivation studies suggest that only a small number of areas are necessary for these behaviors. Here we show that the number of required cortical areas and their dynamics vary across related tasks with different cognitive computations. In a visually guided virtual T-maze task, bilateral inactivation of only a few dorsal cortical regions impaired performance. In contrast, in tasks requiring evidence accumulation and/or post-stimulus memory, performance was impaired by inactivation of widespread cortical areas with diverse patterns of behavioral deficits across areas and tasks. Wide-field imaging revealed widespread ramps of Ca2+ activity during the accumulation and visually guided tasks. Additionally, during accumulation, different regions had more diverse activity profiles, leading to reduced inter-area correlations. Using a modular recurrent neural network model trained to perform analogous tasks, we argue that differences in computational strategies alone could explain these findings."

Newborn neurons must assemble into circuits producing activity patterns capable of instructing behaviors. Elucidating how this process is coordinated requires new methods that follow maturation and activity of all cells across a developing circuit. We present an imaging method for comprehensively tracking neuron lineages, movements, molecular identities, and activity in the entire developing zebrafish spinal cord, from neurogenesis until the emergence of patterned activity instructing the earliest spontaneous motor behavior. We found that motoneurons are active first and form local patterned ensembles with neighboring neurons. These ensembles merge, synchronize globally after reaching a threshold size, and finally recruit commissural interneurons to orchestrate the left-right alternating patterns important for locomotion in vertebrates. Individual neurons undergo functional maturation stereotypically based on their birth time and anatomical origin. Our study provides a general strategy for reconstructing how functioning circuits emerge during embryogenesis. VIDEO ABSTRACT."
https://openalex.org/W2975354354,"Bacteria and archaea possess a striking diversity of CRISPR-Cas systems divided into six types, posing a significant barrier to viral infection. As part of the virus-host arms race, viruses encode protein inhibitors of type I, II, and V CRISPR-Cas systems, but whether there are natural inhibitors of the other, mechanistically distinct CRISPR-Cas types is unknown. Here, we present the discovery of a type III CRISPR-Cas inhibitor, AcrIIIB1, encoded by the Sulfolobus virus SIRV2. AcrIIIB1 exclusively inhibits CRISPR-Cas subtype III-B immunity mediated by the RNase activity of the accessory protein Csx1. AcrIIIB1 does not appear to bind Csx1 but, rather, interacts with two distinct subtype III-B effector complexes—Cmr-α and Cmr-γ—which, in response to protospacer transcript binding, are known to synthesize cyclic oligoadenylates (cOAs) that activate the Csx1 “collateral” RNase. Taken together, we infer that AcrIIIB1 inhibits type III-B CRISPR-Cas immunity by interfering with a Csx1 RNase-related process."
https://openalex.org/W2975273565,"Visual spatial perception in the mammalian brain occurs through two parallel pathways: one reaches the primary visual cortex (V1) through the thalamus and another the superior colliculus (SC) via direct projections from the retina. The origin, development, and relative function of these two evolutionarily distinct pathways remain obscure. We examined the early functional development of both pathways by simultaneously imaging pre- and post-synaptic spontaneous neuronal activity. We observed that the quality of retinal activity transfer to the thalamus and superior colliculus does not change across the first two postnatal weeks. However, beginning in the second postnatal week, retinal activity does not drive V1 as strongly as earlier wave activity, suggesting that intrinsic cortical activity competes with signals from the sensory periphery as the cortex matures. Together, these findings bring new insight into the function of the SC and V1 and the role of peripheral activity in driving both circuits across development."
https://openalex.org/W2976495952,"Metabolic pathways dynamically regulate tissue development and maintenance. However, the mechanisms that govern the metabolic adaptation of stem or progenitor cells to their local niche are poorly understood. Here, we define the transcription factor PRDM16 as a region-specific regulator of intestinal metabolism and epithelial renewal. PRDM16 is selectively expressed in the upper intestine, with enrichment in crypt-resident progenitor cells. Acute Prdm16 deletion in mice triggered progenitor apoptosis, leading to diminished epithelial differentiation and severe intestinal atrophy. Genomic and metabolic analyses showed that PRDM16 transcriptionally controls fatty acid oxidation (FAO) in crypts. Expression of this PRDM16-driven FAO program was highest in the upper small intestine and declined distally. Accordingly, deletion of Prdm16 or inhibition of FAO selectively impaired the development and maintenance of upper intestinal enteroids, and these effects were rescued by acetate treatment. Collectively, these data reveal that regionally specified metabolic programs regulate intestinal maintenance."
https://openalex.org/W2975530421,"Many stem cells utilize asymmetric cell division (ACD) to produce a self-renewed stem cell and a differentiating daughter cell. How non-genic information could be inherited differentially to establish distinct cell fates is not well understood. Here, we report a series of spatiotemporally regulated asymmetric components, which ensure biased sister chromatid attachment and segregation during ACD of Drosophila male germline stem cells (GSCs). First, sister centromeres are differentially enriched with proteins involved in centromere specification and kinetochore function. Second, temporally asymmetric microtubule activities and polarized nuclear envelope breakdown allow for the preferential recognition and attachment of microtubules to asymmetric sister kinetochores and sister centromeres. Abolishment of either the asymmetric sister centromeres or the asymmetric microtubule activities results in randomized sister chromatid segregation. Together, these results provide the cellular basis for partitioning epigenetically distinct sister chromatids during stem cell ACDs, which opens new directions to study these mechanisms in other biological contexts."
https://openalex.org/W2978328631,"Soil salinity is a major threat to crop production worldwide. The global climate change is further accelerating the process of soil salinization, particularly in dry areas of the world. Increasing genetic variability of currently used wheat varieties by introgression of exotic alleles/genes from related progenitors’ species in breeding programs is an efficient approach to overcome limitations due to the absence of valuable genetic diversity in elite cultivars. Synthetic hexaploid wheat (SHW) is widely regarded as donor of favourable exotic alleles to improve tolerance against biotic and abiotic stresses such as salinity stress. In this study, synthetic backcross lines (SBLs) winter wheat population “Z86”, derived from crosses involving synthetic hexaploid wheat Syn86L with German elite winter wheat cultivar Zentos, was evaluated for salinity tolerance at different developmental stages under controlled and field conditions in three growing seasons. High genetic variability was detected across the SBLs and their parents at various growth stages under controlled as well as under salt stress field trials. Greater performance of Zentos over Syn86L was detected at germination stage across all salt treatments and with respect to shoot dry weight (SDW) and root dry weight (RDW) at seedling stage. Whereas for the root length (RL) and the shoot length (SL) Syn86L surpassed the elite cultivar and most of the progenies. Our experiments revealed for almost all traits that some genotypes among the SBLs showed higher performance than their parents. Furthermore, positive transgressive segregations were detected among the SBLs for germination at high salinity levels, as well as for RDW and SDW at seedling stage. Therefore, the studied Z86 population is a suitable population for assessment of salinity stress on morphological and physiological traits at different plant growth stages. The identified SBLs provide a valuable source for genetic gain through recombination of superior alleles that can be directly applied in breeding programs for efficiently breeding cultivars with improved salinity tolerance and desired agronomic traits."
https://openalex.org/W2984365258,"Sugar transporters play a crucial role for plant productivity, as they coordinate sugar fluxes from source leaf towards sink organs (seed, fruit, root) and regulate the supply of carbon resources towards the microorganisms of the rhizosphere (bacteria and fungi). Thus, sugar fluxes mediated by SUT (sucrose transporters), MST (monosaccharide transporters) and SWEET (sugar will eventually be exported transporters) families are key determinants of crop yield and shape the microbial communities living in the soil. In this work, we performed a systematic search for sugar transporters in Fabaceae genomes, focusing on model and agronomical plants. Here, we update the inventory of sugar transporter families mining the latest version of the Medicago truncatula genome and identify for the first time SUT MST and SWEET families of the agricultural crop Pisum sativum. The sugar transporter families of these Fabaceae species comprise respectively 7 MtSUT 7 PsSUT, 72 MtMST 59 PsMST and 26 MtSWEET 22 PsSWEET. Our comprehensive phylogenetic analysis sets a milestone for the scientific community, as we propose a new and simple nomenclature to correctly name SUT MST and SWEET families. Then, we searched for transcriptomic data available for our gene repertoire. We show that several clusters of homologous genes are co-expressed in different organs, suggesting that orthologous sugar transporters may have a conserved function. We focused our analysis on gene candidates that may be involved in remobilizing resources during flowering, grain filling and in allocating carbon towards roots colonized by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and Rhizobia. Our findings open new perspectives for agroecological applications in legume crops, as for instance improving the yield and quality of seed productions and promoting the use of symbiotic microorganisms."
https://openalex.org/W2975860219,"The reduction of synthetic fungicides in agriculture is necessary to guarantee a sustainable production that protects the environment and consumers' health. Downy mildew caused by the oomycete Plasmopara viticola is the major pathogen in viticulture worldwide and responsible for up to 60% of pesticide treatments. Alternatives to reduce fungicides are thus utterly needed to ensure sustainable vineyard-ecosystems, consumer health and public acceptance. Essential oils (EOs) are amongst the most promising natural plant protection alternatives and have shown their antibacterial, antiviral and antifungal properties on several agricultural crops. However, the efficiency of EOs highly depends on timing, application method and the molecular interactions between the host, the pathogen and EO. Despite proven EO efficiency, the underlying processes are still not understood and remain a black box. The objectives of the present study were: a) to evaluate whether a continuous fumigation of a particular EO can control downy mildew in order to circumvent the drawbacks of direct application, b) to decipher molecular mechanisms that could be triggered in the host and the pathogen by EO application and c) to try to differentiate whether essential oils directly repress the oomycete or act as plant resistance primers. To achieve this a custom-made climatic chamber was constructed that enabled a continuous fumigation of potted vines with different EOs during long-term experiments. The grapevine (Vitis vinifera) cv Chasselas was chosen in reason of its high susceptibility to Plasmopara viticola. Grapevine cuttings were infected with P. viticola and subsequently exposed to continuous fumigation of different EOs at different concentrations, during 2 application time spans (24 hours and 10 days). Experiments were stopped when infection symptoms were clearly observed on the leaves of the control plants. Plant physiology (photosynthesis and growth rate parameters) were recorded and leaves were sampled at different time points for subsequent RNA extraction and transcriptomics analysis. Strikingly, the Oregano vulgare EO vapour treatment during 24h post-infection proved to be sufficient to reduce downy mildew development by 95%. Total RNA was extracted from leaves of 24h and 10d treatments and used for whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing (RNA-seq). Sequenced reads were then mapped onto the V. vinifera and P. viticola genomes. Less than 1% of reads could be mapped onto the P. viticola genome from treated samples, whereas up to 30% reads from the controls mapped onto the P. viticola genome, thereby confirming the visual observation of P. viticola absence in the treated plants. On average, 80% of reads could be mapped onto the V. vinifera genome for differential expression analysis, which yielded 4800 modulated genes. Transcriptomic data clearly showed that the treatment triggered the plant's innate immune system with genes involved in salicylic, jasmonic acid and ethylene synthesis and signaling, activating Pathogenesis-Related-proteins as well as phytoalexin synthesis. These results elucidate EO-host-pathogen interactions for the first time and indicate that the antifungal efficiency of EO is mainly due to the triggering of resistance pathways inside the host plants. This is of major importance for the production and research on biopesticides, plant stimulation products and for resistance-breeding strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2977743536,"The use of biopolymers as elicitors in controlling plant diseases is gaining momentum world-wide due to their eco-friendly and non-toxic nature. In the present study, we have used an algal biopolymer (sodium alginate) and tested its applicability as an elicitor in inducing resistance factors against Alternaria solani, which causes early blight disease in Solanum lycopersicum (tomato plant). We have pre-treated tomato plants with different concentrations of sodium alginate (0.2%, 0.4%, and 0.6%) before A. solani infection. We found that sodium alginate has effectively controlled the growth of A. solani. In addition, a significant increase in the expression levels of SOD was observed in response to pathogen infection. The increased protease inhibitors activity further suggest that sodium alginate restrict the development of A. solani infection symptoms in tomato leaves. This corroborates well with the cell death analysis wherein increased sodium alginate pre-treatment results in decreased cell death. Also, the expression profile analyses reveal the induction of genes only in sodium alginate-pretreated tomato leaves, which are implicated in plant defense mechanism. Taken together, our results suggest that sodium alginate can be used as an elicitor to induce resistance against A. solani in tomato plants."

High-throughput whole-cell screening of an extensive compound library has recently identified a piperidinol-containing molecule, PIPD1, as a potent lead compound against M. tuberculosis. Herein, we show that PIPD1 and related analogs exert in vitro bactericidal activity against the M. tuberculosis strain mc26230 and also against a panel of multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis, suggesting that PIPD1's mode of action differs from those of most first- and second-line anti-tubercular drugs. Selection and DNA sequencing of PIPD1-resistant mycobacterial mutants revealed the presence of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in mmpL3, encoding an inner membrane–associated mycolic acid flippase in M. tuberculosis. Results from functional assays with spheroplasts derived from a M. smegmatis strain lacking the endogenous mmpL3 gene but harboring the M. tuberculosis mmpL3 homolog indicated that PIPD1 inhibits the MmpL3-driven translocation of trehalose monomycolate across the inner membrane without altering the proton motive force. Using a predictive structural model of MmpL3 from M. tuberculosis, docking studies revealed a PIPD1-binding cavity recently found to accommodate different inhibitors in M. smegmatis MmpL3. In conclusion, our findings have uncovered bactericidal activity of a new chemical scaffold. Its anti-tubercular activity is mediated by direct inhibition of the flippase activity of MmpL3 rather than by inhibition of the inner membrane proton motive force, significantly advancing our understanding of MmpL3-targeted inhibition in mycobacteria.

https://openalex.org/W2978997201,"Development of genome-wide resources for application in genomic selection or genome-wide association studies, in the absence of full reference genomes, present a challenge to the forestry industry, where longer breeding cycles could benefit from the accelerated selection possible through marker-based breeding value predictions. In particular, large conifer megagenomes require a strategy to reduce complexity, whilst ensuring genome-wide coverage is achieved. Using a transcriptome-based reference template, we have successfully developed a high density exome capture genotype-by-sequencing panel for radiata pine (Pinus radiata D.Don), capable of capturing in excess of 80,000 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers with a minor allele frequency above 0.03 in the population tested. This represents approximately 29,000 gene models from a core set of 48,914 probes. A set of 704 SNP markers capable of pedigree reconstruction and differentiating individual genotypes were tested within two full-sib mapping populations. While as few as 70 markers could reconstruct parentage in almost all cases, the impact of missing genotypes was noticeable in several offspring. Therefore, 60 sets of 110 randomly selected SNP markers were compared for both parentage reconstruction and clone differentiation. The performance in parentage reconstruction showed little variation over 60 iterations. However, there was notable variation in discriminatory power between closely related individuals, indicating a higher density SNP marker panel may be required to elucidate hidden relationships in complex pedigrees."

Visual experience guides the refinement of synaptic connections after the onset of vision. Mouse primary visual cortex (V1) has been widely used to study experience-dependent homeostatic plasticity mechanisms in vivo (Whitt et al., 2014Whitt J.L. Petrus E. Lee H.K.

In juvenile mice, a few days of visual deprivation through dark exposure (DE) increases the strength of excitatory synapses onto V1 layer 2/3 (L2/3) pyramidal neurons, while restoring visual experience induces a rapid reduction of synaptic strength (Gao et al., 2010Gao M.

USA. 1999; 96: 12876-12880Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Recently, it was demonstrated that visual deprivation-induced upregulation of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) in L2/3 of V1 is dependent on GluN2B and elevated spontaneous activity (Bridi et al., 2018Bridi M.C.D. de Pasquale R. Lantz C.L. Gu Y. Borrell A. Choi S.Y. He K. Tran T. Hong S.Z. Dykman A. et al.Two distinct mechanisms for experience-dependent homeostasis.Nat. Neurosci. 2018; 21: 843-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These results support the idea that visual deprivation-induced strengthening of excitatory synapses in V1 L2/3 is due to sliding threshold model of metaplasticity, in which elevated spontaneous activity acts on GluN2B-containing NMDARs to promote potentiation across a large number of synapses. We recently reported that mEPSCs generally reflect the strength of lateral intracortical (IC) inputs to V1 L2/3 neurons but do not capture changes occurring at sparse inputs such as feedforward (FF) synapses from L4 (Petrus et al., 2015Petrus E. Rodriguez G. Patterson R. Connor B. Kanold P.O. Lee H.K. Vision loss shifts the balance of feedforward and intracortical circuits in opposite directions in mouse primary auditory and visual cortices.J. Neurosci. 2015; 35: 8790-8801Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We found that IC inputs onto V1 L2/3 neurons become stronger in response to DE, while the strength of FF synapses from L4 remains constant. These results suggest that in intact circuitry where different inputs receive different patterns of activity, homeostatic synaptic adjustment occurs in an input-specific manner. To date, Arc and retinoic acid have been shown to play roles in input-specific strengthening of synapses by inactivity (Béïque et al., 2011Béïque J.C. Na Y. Kuhl D. Worley P.F. Huganir R.L.

It is currently unknown whether input-specific homeostatic plasticity occurs when there is an abrupt increase in input activity, and if so, what the molecular mechanisms mediating this phenomenon are. When visual deprivation is reversed by reexposure to light, the average size of mEPSCs in V1 L2/3 neurons is reduced (Gao et al., 2010Gao M. Sossa K. Song L. Errington L. Cummings L. Hwang H. Kuhl D.

Persistence of experience-induced homeostatic synaptic plasticity through adulthood in superficial layers of mouse visual cortex.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 6692-6700Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Here, we report that this change is restricted to the lateral IC inputs and is not present at the FF synapses from L4. Furthermore, input-specific downregulation of IC synapses requires activity of NMDARs and metabotropic glutamate receptor 5s (mGluR5s), both of which have been implicated in metaplasticity (Abraham, 2008Abraham W.C. Metaplasticity: tuning synapses and networks for plasticity.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 9: 387Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar, Cohen and Abraham, 1996Cohen A.S. Abraham W.C. Facilitation of long-term potentiation by prior activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors.J. Neurophysiol. 1996; 76: 953-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Mechanistically, we found that the immediate early gene H1a and its interaction with mGluR5 are necessary for this input-specific metaplasticity. Given that mGluRs are localized at perisynaptic loci, we reasoned that they may detect glutamate spillover during abrupt increases in synaptic activity, as would occur when DE mice are brought out to light. To test whether mGluR activity is required for weakening synapses with light reexposure, we first used pharmacological inhibitors of group I mGluRs to allow acute manipulations of specific subtypes. Synaptic strength was assessed by measuring mEPSCs recorded from pyramidal neurons in L2/3 of V1 from normal-reared (NR), 2 days DE, and DE mice that received 2 h of subsequent light exposure (LE) in the presence or absence of specific mGluR antagonists (Figure 1A). We first tested the involvement of mGluR5, expressed on postsynaptic spines (López-Bendito et al., 2002López-Bendito G. Shigemoto R. Fairén A. Luján R.

Brain Res. 2009; 199: 391-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The control group (PBS; i.p. once daily) exhibited normal bidirectional changes in synaptic strength as previously found (Goel and Lee, 2007Goel A. Lee H.K. Persistence of experience-induced homeostatic synaptic plasticity through adulthood in superficial layers of mouse visual cortex.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 6692-6700Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar); the average mEPSC amplitude was increased by DE and reverted to normal levels by subsequent LE (Figure 1B). NR mice that received MPEP (2 days) had higher basal synaptic strength than the controls (Figures 1B and 1C; t test, p = 0.01), which was multiplicative (Figure 1D). This suggests that mGluR5 activity maintains a lower basal synaptic strength during normal visual experience. We did not observe further increase in mEPSC amplitude in mice treated with MPEP during DE, which suggests occlusion of DE induced synaptic strengthening. More importantly, when DE mice received MPEP injection immediately before light reexposure (i.p. 30 min before LE), mEPSC amplitudes did not decrease following LE (Figure 1C). Average mEPSC frequency was similar across groups (Figures 1E and 1F). These data indicate that mGluR5 activity is required for experience-dependent reduction in excitatory synaptic strength during normal visual experience and LE condition in V1 L2/3. Next, we tested whether the effect was specific to mGluR5 among Group1 mGluRs. In contrast to MPEP, mGluR1 inhibition by (RS)-1-aminoindan-1,5-dicarboxylic acid (AIDA; 1 mg/kg, i.p. once daily for 2 days), a competitive antagonist of mGluR1, did not affect basal amplitude of mEPSCs but blocked increases with DE (Figures S1A–S1C). AIDA treatment in DE mice immediately prior to LE did not block the decrease in mEPSC amplitudes (Figure S1B). While the average mEPSC amplitudes of PBS- and AIDA-treated NR groups were not statistical different, there was multiplicative reduction in mEPSC amplitudes in the AIDA group (Figure S1C). There were no significant changes in mEPSC frequency across groups (Figure S1D). We rule out the possibility that the differential effect of AIDA and MPEP is due to the ability of MPEP to block both agonist-dependent and independent activity, while AIDA only blocks the former, by replicating the AIDA results using an inverse agonist of mGluR1, Bay36-7620 (20 mg/kg i.p. once daily) (Gil-Sanz et al., 2008Gil-Sanz C.

Cortex. 2008; 18: 1653-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) (Figures S1E–S1H). These results suggest that mGluR1 plays a distinct role from mGluR5 in that it supports strengthening of synapses with visual deprivation. Collectively, our results suggest that mGluR5 activity is specifically required for weakening excitatory synapses with visual experience. V1 L2/3 neurons receive strong FF inputs from L4 principal neurons, but these constitute a small portion of the total inputs (Binzegger et al., 2004Binzegger T. Douglas R.J. Martin K.A.

The rest of the inputs are IC connections from local L2/3 neurons, deeper V1 layers, higher order visual areas, and other cortical areas (Dantzker and Callaway, 2000Dantzker J.L. Callaway E.M.

Previously, we reported that DE only potentiates IC inputs without changes in FF inputs in V1 L2/3 neurons (Petrus et al., 2015Petrus E. Rodriguez G. Patterson R. Connor B. Kanold P.O. Lee H.K.

These findings also suggested that mEPSCs mainly represent IC inputs and that homeostatic synaptic plasticity driven by visual deprivation is input specific. We determined whether homeostatic plasticity induced by increased visual experience is also input specific. We measured the strength of individual synapses in an input-specific manner by recording Sr2+ desynchronized evoked EPSCs from V1 L2/3 neurons. To specifically activate FF inputs from L4 to L2/3, we injected an adeno-associated virus containing double-floxed channelrhodopsin-2 (AAV9.EF1.dflox.hChR2(H134R)-mCherry or AAV9.EF1a.DIO.hChR2(H134R).EYFP) into V1 of Scnn1a-Tg3-cre (L4Cre) mice (see STAR Methods). IC inputs to V1 L2/3 neurons were stimulated by an electrode placed in L2/3 lateral to the recorded neuron (Figure 2A). In the presence of Sr2+, evoked responses result in desynchronized release of vesicles (Abdul-Ghani et al., 1996Abdul-Ghani M.A. Valiante T.A. Pennefather P.S.

Malenka R.C. Nicoll R.A. Bidirectional control of quantal size by synaptic activity in the hippocampus.Science. 1996; 271: 1294-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). These desynchronized single vesicle events are considered mEPSCs (Sr2+-mEPSCs) resulting from the stimulated input and can be analyzed to measure the strength of individual synapses participating in evoked synaptic transmission (Figure 2B). We calculated the average amplitude of evoked Sr2+-mEPSCs by subtracting out the contribution of spontaneous mEPSCs (see STAR Methods for detail). IC inputs potentiated with DE and reverted back to normal levels with a subsequent LE (Figure 2C), which mirrored mEPSC changes. However, the strength of FF inputs from L4 did not alter significantly (Figure 2D). This indicates that visual experience drives homeostatic plasticity in an input-specific manner in L2/3 neurons through selective weakening of IC inputs. Mechanistically, the specific weakening of IC inputs with visual experience was dependent on NMDAR and mGluR5 activity. This was demonstrated by administering either the NMDAR antagonist R-4([2E]-3-phosphono-2-propenyl)-2-piperazinecarboxylic acid (CPP; 10 mg/kg, i.p.) or the mGluR5 inverse agonist MPEP (10 mg/kg, i.p.) to DE mice 30 min prior to LE. In CPP- or MPEP-injected mice, IC inputs failed to depress in response to LE (Figure 2E) without an effect on FF evoked Sr2+-mEPSC amplitudes (Figure 2F). Our results indicate a novel dual requirement of NMDAR and mGluR5 activity for input-specific depression of IC synapses with LE.

However, when the activity-dependent variant of Homer1 (H1a) is expressed, group I mGluRs disperse across the dendrites and become constitutively active. Both H1a and long forms of Homer1 share the EVH1 domain, which binds to its effectors including group I mGluRs (Tu et al., 1998Tu J.C. Xiao B. Yuan J.P. Lanahan A.A. Leoffert K. Li M. Linden D.J.

In dissociated neuronal cultures, H1a mediates homeostatic downscaling induced by pharmacologically increasing activity (Hu et al., 2010Hu J.-H.H. Park J.M. Park S. Xiao B. Dehoff M.H. Kim S. Hayashi T. Schwarz M.K. Huganir R.L. Seeburg P.H. et al.Homeostatic scaling requires group I mGluR activation mediated by Homer1a.Neuron. 2010; 68: 1128-1142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). This action of H1a that activates agonist-independent mGluR5 signaling is upstream of Arc (Hu et al., 2010Hu J.-H.H. Park J.M. Park S. Xiao B. Dehoff M.H. Kim S. Hayashi T. Schwarz M.K. Huganir R.L.

Sossa K. Song L. Errington L. Cummings L. Hwang H. Kuhl D. Worley P. Lee H.K. A specific requirement of Arc/Arg3.1 for visual experience-induced homeostatic synaptic plasticity in mouse primary visual cortex.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 7168-7178Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was shown that visual experience following dark rearing rapidly induces H1a mRNA expression in V1 (Brakeman et al., 1997Brakeman P.R. Lanahan A.A. O’Brien R. Roche K. Barnes C.A. Huganir R.L. Worley P.F. Homer: a protein that selectively binds metabotropic glutamate receptors.Nature. 1997; 386: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). Based on our result that mEPSC amplitude measurement reflects the strength of IC inputs, we examined the involvement of H1a in the experience-dependent synaptic weakening by recording mEPSCs in V1 L2/3 neurons in H1a knockout (H1aKO) mice (Hu et al., 2010Hu J.-H.H. Park J.M. Park S. Xiao B. Dehoff M.H. Kim S. Hayashi T. Schwarz M.K. Huganir R.L. Seeburg P.H. et al.Homeostatic scaling requires group I mGluR activation mediated by Homer1a.Neuron. 2010; 68: 1128-1142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). We confirmed that there was no expression of H1a in V1 of these animals (Figure S2A) albeit an increase in H1b/c mRNA and protein levels (Figures S2B and S2C). We found that genetic KO of H1a affected mEPSCs in a manner similar to that of pharmacological inhibition of mGluR5 in wild-type (WT) mice. This is consistent with the notion that H1a triggers mGluR5 agonist-independent signaling (Ango et al., 2001Ango F. Prézeau L. Muller T. Tu J.C. Xiao B. Worley P.F. Pin J.P. Bockaert J. Fagni L. Agonist-independent activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors by the intracellular protein Homer.Nature. 2001; 411: 962-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Basally, H1aKOs showed elevated mEPSC amplitudes compared to H1aWTs (t test, p < 0.01), which was multiplicative suggesting that most of the sampled synapses undergo change (Figures 3A–3D). The abnormal enhancement of basal mEPSC amplitude seen in H1aKOs was not likely due to gross changes in the expression of glutamate receptors, because we did not find significant changes in either the surface or total levels of several glutamate receptor subunits in microdissected V1 L2/3 slices processed for surface biotinylation (Figure S3A). In H1aKOs, the effect of DE was occluded by the increased basal synaptic strength, and more importantly, these mice lacked an LE-induced decrease in mEPSC amplitudes (Figure 3C). These findings contrast the normal bidirectional regulation observed in H1aWTs (Figure 3B). There was no significant change in mEPSC frequency across groups (Figure 3E). Our results suggest that H1a is required for experience-dependent weakening of synapses in V1 L2/3 neurons during NR and LE conditions. mEPSCs in V1 L2/3 neurons decrease in amplitude and increase in frequency around P14, which coincides with eye opening in mice (Goel and Lee, 2007Goel A. Lee H.K. Persistence of experience-induced homeostatic synaptic plasticity through adulthood in superficial layers of mouse visual cortex.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 6692-6700Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). We tested whether the high basal mEPSC amplitude of H1aKOs reflects a failure of this developmental process. We compared the mEPSCs of NR mice before eye opening (P11-P12) and during the critical period (P23–P32) (Figure 4A). H1aKOs displayed comparable mEPSC amplitudes at P11-P12 to H1aWTs (Figures 4B and 4C). Like H1aWTs, H1aKOs also exhibited a developmental decrease in mEPSC amplitudes, but the average amplitude did not decrease to the same level (Figures 4B and 4C). In parallel, H1aKOs showed a normal developmental increase in mEPSC frequency (Figure 4D). Thus, H1aKOs seem to undergo largely normal early development of excitatory synaptic transmission in V1 L2/3 neurons upon eye opening. Our results also highlight that there are"

In the current EMA study, people with (n = 20) and without schizophrenia (n = 15) answered questions about the quality of their social interactions, including their emotion experiences. We also explored the relationship between EMA-reported social experiences and trait loneliness, negative symptoms, and social functioning. People with and without schizophrenia did not differ in EMA-reported proportion of time spent with others, extent of involvement during social interactions, intimacy of interactions, or average number of social interactions. Both people with and without schizophrenia reported more positive than negative emotion during social experiences. However, people with schizophrenia reported more loneliness, more severe negative symptoms, and impaired social functioning compared to people without schizophrenia. Further, specific qualities of social interactions (intimacy of interaction, involvement during interaction) were related to happiness during interactions only in people without schizophrenia. These results suggest that while people with and without schizophrenia report similar rates of in-the-moment social emotion experiences, the impact of social interaction quality on emotion may differ between groups."

Here, we found that a recombinant CTB containing an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention motif (CTB‐KDEL) induces colon epithelial wound healing in colitis via the activation of an unfolded protein response (UPR) in colon epithelial cells. In a Caco2 cell wound healing model, CTB‐KDEL, but not CTB or CTB‐KDE, facilitated cell migration via interaction with the KDEL receptor, localization in the ER, UPR activation, and subsequent TGF‐β signaling. Inhibition of the inositol‐requiring enzyme 1/X‐box binding protein 1 arm of UPR abolished the cell migration effect of CTB‐KDEL, indicating that the pathway is indispensable for the activity. CTB‐KDEL's capacity to induce UPR and epithelial restitution or wound healing was corroborated in a dextran sodium sulfate‐induced acute colitis mouse model. Furthermore, CTB‐KDEL induced a UPR, up‐regulated wound healing pathways, and maintained viable crypts in colon explants from patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In summary, CTB‐KDEL exhibits unique wound healing effects in the colon that are mediated by its localization to the ER and subsequent activation of UPR in epithelial cells.

To define the composition of this proteolytic machine in plants, we tagged either the core protease (CP) or the regulatory particle (RP) sub-complexes in Arabidopsis to enable rapid affinity purification followed by mass spectrometric analysis. Studies on proteasomes enriched from whole seedlings, with or without ATP needed to maintain the holo-proteasome complex, identified all known proteasome subunits but failed to detect isoform preferences, suggesting that Arabidopsis does not construct distinct proteasome sub-types. We also detected a suite of proteasome-interacting proteins, including likely orthologs of the yeast and mammalian chaperones Pba1, Pba2, Pba3, and Pba4 that assist in CP assembly; Ump1 that helps connect CP half-barrels; Nas2, Nas6, and Hsm3 that assist in RP assembly; and Ecm29 that promotes CP-RP association. Proteasomes from seedlings exposed to the proteasome inhibitor MG132 accumulated assembly intermediates, reflecting partially built proteasome sub-complexes associated with assembly chaperones, and the CP capped with the PA200/Blm10 regulator. Genetic analyses of Arabidopsis UMP1 revealed that, unlike in yeast, this chaperone is essential, with mutants lacking the major UMP1a and UMP1b isoforms displaying a strong gametophytic defect. Single ump1 mutants were hypersensitive to conditions that induce proteotoxic, salt and osmotic stress, and also accumulated several proteasome assembly intermediates, consistent with its importance for CP construction.

Unfortunately, there are no effective preclinical models available that represent Wilms tumor (WT) — the most common pediatric renal tumor. Especially the high-risk blastemal WT subtype is not represented by the few primary cell lines established until now. Here, we describe a new 3D approach for in vitro cultivation of blastemal WT cells, where primary cultures grown in suspension as spheroids could be propagated long-term. Besides blastemal cultures, we could generate spheroids representing epithelial and stromal WT. Spheroid cultures were analyzed by immunohistochemistry in comparison to corresponding tumor sections and were further characterized by RNA sequencing. Histological appearance of spheroids resembled the original tumor and they expressed marker genes characteristic of early renal development and blastemal WT elements. The cultures were amenable to genetic manipulation and they formed xenograft tumors, which resemble the primary human tumor. This collection of WT spheroids that carry different genetic drivers forms a long-sought tool for drug testing and in vitro modeling."

Like other solid tumors, the HNSCC growth rate results in the development of hypoxic regions identified by the expression of hypoxia‐inducible factor 1α (HIF‐1α). Interestingly, clinical data have shown that pharmacological induction of intratumoral hypoxia caused an unexpected rise in tumor metastasis and the accumulation of cancer stem cells (CSCs). However, little is known on the molecular circuitries involved in the presence of intratumoral hypoxia and the augmented population of CSCs. Here we explore the impact of hypoxia on the behavior of HNSCC and define that the controlling function of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) over HIF‐1α expression and CSC accumulation are de‐regulated during hypoxic events. Our findings indicate that hypoxic niches are poised to accumulate CSCs in a molecular process driven by the loss of PTEN activity.

Mice that lack both enzymes are viable and fertile but display accelerated hair growth after shaving and also enlarged meibomian glands, consistent with a nearly 80% reduction in the retinol dehydrogenase activities of skin membrane fractions from the Sdr16c5/Sdr16c6 double-knockout mice. The up-regulation of hair-follicle stem cell genes is consistent with reduced retinoic acid signaling in the skin of the double-knockout mice. These results indicate that the retinol dehydrogenase activities of murine SDR16C5 and SDR16C6 enzymes are not critical for survival but are responsible for most of the retinol dehydrogenase activity in skin, essential for the regulation of the hair-follicle cycle, and required for the maintenance of both sebaceous and meibomian glands.

RA is synthesized from the alcohol form of vitamin A (all-trans-retinol) via a two-step process. In the first step, retinol dehydrogenases oxidize all-trans-retinol to all-trans-retinaldehyde, which is oxidized further by retinaldehyde dehydrogenases (RALDHs) to RA (reviewed in Ref. 9Kedishvili N.Y.

The severity of the phenotype indicates that RDH10 functions as the major murine retinol dehydrogenase during mid-embryogenesis. However, whereas the ablation of RDH10 eliminates most of the retinol dehydrogenase activity during the early stages of development, RA synthesis persists in the neural tube of RDH10-null embryos at E9.5 and E10.5 (14Cunningham T.J.

Importantly, Rdh10−/− embryos can be rescued by supplementation of maternal diets with retinaldehyde between embryonic stages E7.5 and E9.5. Thus, RDH10 appears to be dispensable during later stages of development and transition to adulthood (11Rhinn M. Schuhbaur B. Niederreither K. Dollé P. Involvement of retinol dehydrogenase 10 in embryonic patterning and rescue of its loss of function by maternal retinaldehyde treatment.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

However, the identities of additional retinol dehydrogenases accounting for this residual retinaldehyde synthesis remain elusive. RDH10 belongs to the 16C family of the SDR superfamily of proteins (16Wu B.X. Chen Y. Chen Y. Fan J. Rohrer B. Crouch R.K. Ma J.-X.

Notably, two other genes encoding members of the SDR16C family are located adjacent to the gene encoding RDH10 in the human genome on chromosome 8: retinol dehydrogenase epidermal 2 (RDHE2, SDR16C5) and retinol dehydrogenase epidermal 2-similar (RDHE2S, SDR16C6) (18Belyaeva O.V.

The deduced RDHE2 and RDHE2S proteins share the highest sequence homology (∼43%) with RDH10 (SDR16C4). As we reported previously, the single ortholog of human genes encoding RDHE2 and RDHE2S in Xenopus laevis functions as a retinol dehydrogenase in vivo and is essential for embryonic development in frogs (20Lee S.-A. Belyaeva O.V. Kedishvili N.Y. Biochemical characterization of human epidermal retinol dehydrogenase 2.Chem. Biol.

These findings imply that mammalian RDHE2 and RDHE2S complement RDH10 in generating retinaldehyde for RA biosynthesis. However, it remains to be established whether the in vivo function of amphibian rdhe2 is conserved by its mammalian orthologs. This study was undertaken to assess the catalytic properties of mammalian RDHE2 and RDHE2S as compared with amphibian rdhe2, to determine the expression patterns of RDHE2 and RDHE2S in mice, and to establish whether these enzymes are essential for RA biosynthesis in mammals. To compare the catalytic properties of murine RDHE2 (SDR16C5) and RDHE2S (SDR16C6) as retinol dehydrogenases with those of frog rdhe2, we expressed each enzyme as a fusion protein with the C-terminal His6 tag in insect Sf9 cells using the baculovirus expression system. Western blot analysis showed that the recombinant SDRs were expressed at comparable protein levels in the microsomal fractions of Sf9 cells (Fig. 1A). Therefore, the microsomal fractions containing the RDHE proteins were used for characterization of their retinoid activities. Activity assays revealed that murine RDHE2S and Xenopus rdhe2 both catalyzed the oxidation of all-trans-retinol to all-trans-retinaldehyde in the presence of NAD+. The activity rates with NADP+ were at the limit of detection (data not shown); hence, NAD+ was the preferred cofactor for both enzymes. RDHE2S exhibited a higher apparent Km value and a lower apparent Vmax value for the oxidation of all-trans-retinol than Xenopus rdhe2 (Table 1). Thus, Xenopus rdhe2 exhibited a higher catalytic efficiency (Vmax/Km) than murine RDHE2S. Both enzymes also catalyzed the reduction of all-trans-retinaldehyde to all-trans-retinol in the presence of NADH, but their catalytic efficiencies in the reductive direction were lower than in the oxidative direction (Table 1). In addition to all-trans-retinol, both RDHE2S and Xenopus rdhe2 recognized 11-cis-retinol as substrate (Table 1).Table 1Kinetic constants of SDR16C enzymesSDRSubstrate/CofactorApparent KmApparent VmaxVmax/Kmμmnmol·min−1·mg−1Xenopus rdhe2All-trans-retinol0.6 ± 0.119.5 ± 0.632.5NAD+108 ± 2721 ± 1All-trans-retinaldehyde0.6 ± 0.13.6 ± 0.16NADH8.4 ± 1.74.1 ± 0.211-cis-Retinol3.3 ± 0.43.9 ± 0.21.8RDHE2 (SDR16C5)All-trans-retinolUDUDAll-trans-retinaldehydeN.D.N.D.RDHE2S (SDR16C6)All-trans-retinol0.87 ± 0.218.7 ± 0.610NAD+460 ± 305.8 ± 0.2All-trans-retinaldehyde3.9 ± 0.25.4 ± 0.11.4NADH11 ± 32.6 ± 0.111-cis-Retinol0.86 ± 0.141.34 ± 0.071.69-cis-RetinolUDUD Open table in a new tab Unexpectedly, no activity toward all-trans-retinol was detected using the microsomal preparation of recombinant murine RDHE2 protein (Table 1). Some SDRs show dual subcellular distribution between microsomal and mitochondrial fractions (21Labrie F. Simard J. Luu-The V. Pelletier G. Bélanger A. Lachance Y. Zhao H.F. Labrie C. Breton N. de Launoit Y. Structure and tissue-specific expression of 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/5-ene-4-ene isomerase genes in human and rat classical and peripheral steroidogenic tissues.J. Steroid Biochem. Mol.

No activity was detected using RDHE2-containing mitochondria, whereas 10 μg of mitochondria from RDHE2S-expressing Sf9 cells exhibited a much lower activity (0.03 nmol·min−1·mg−1) than RDHE2S microsomes under the same assay conditions (10 μm retinol and 1 mm NAD+) (Table 1), suggesting that RDHE2S is localized primarily in the microsomal membranes. The finding that RDHE2 was inactive when assayed using either the microsomal or mitochondrial fractions of Sf9 cells prompted us to examine whether RDHE2 was catalytically active in the context of intact living cells. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with pCS105 expression vectors encoding RDHE2 with a C-terminal FLAG tag. RDHE2S, which was previously shown to oxidize retinol in living cells (18Belyaeva O.V. Lee S.-A. Adams M.K. Chang C. Kedishvili N.Y. Short chain dehydrogenase/reductase Rdhe2 is a novel retinol dehydrogenase essential for frog embryonic development.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287 (22291023): 9061-907110.1074/jbc.M111.336727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), was also cloned into pCS105 expression vector in frame with FLAG tag and used as a positive control. The two enzymes were co-expressed with RALDH1 to enhance the relatively low endogenous retinaldehyde dehydrogenase activity of HEK293 cells (Fig. 1B), which caused accumulation of unprocessed retinaldehyde in the cells under the conditions of this experiment. Remarkably, when expressed in intact cells, RDHE2 was found to exhibit a retinol dehydrogenase activity, increasing the production of retinaldehyde from retinol (Fig. 1C). This activity of RDHE2 resulted in a 3-fold increase in RA biosynthesis relative to mock-transfected cells (Fig. 1D). In comparison, expression of RDHE2S at similar protein levels, as judged based on comparable staining intensity for FLAG tag (Fig. 1B), resulted in a 15-fold increase in RA production (Fig. 1D). These experiments confirmed that RDHE2S is a more active enzyme than RDHE2, but most importantly, they revealed that, although inactive toward retinol in isolated microsomes, RDHE2 was able to function as a retinol dehydrogenase in intact cells, confirming that RDHE2 is a catalytically active enzyme. To identify the tissues where RDHE2 and RDHE2S contribution could be essential for RA biosynthesis, we carried out analysis of their gene expression patterns. Tissue distribution of Rdhe2 and Rdhe2s transcripts in adult mice was analyzed by qPCR. The two transcripts exhibited a largely overlapping expression pattern with the highest expression levels in skin, followed by tongue, intestine, and esophagus (Fig. 2A). In addition, we examined the distribution of the PCR-amplified full-length mRNA corresponding to Rdhe2 and Rdhe2s genes. This analysis largely confirmed the pattern determined by qPCR, with the highest expression levels observed in skin, esophagus, stomach, and tongue and trace amounts of transcripts detected in adipose tissue, intestine, colon, and possibly testis (Fig. 2A, inset). To determine whether Rdhe2 and Rdhe2s are expressed during embryogenesis, we employed semiquantitative PCR. RNA was isolated from WT C57BL/6J embryos between stages E9.5 and E14.5 in 1-day increments and utilized for the synthesis of cDNA, which then served as a template for PCR amplification using gene-specific primers (Fig. 2B). PCR products encoding Rdhe2 were observed starting at E12.5, increasing in abundance through E14.5. Products encoding Rdhe2s were detected earlier in development at E10.5 and persisted through E14.5. Thus, both Rdhe2 and Rdhe2s were expressed from middle to late gestation. The ultimate proof that RDHE2 and RDHE2S are essential for RA biosynthesis would have to come from gene knockout studies. Because RDHE2S exhibited a severalfold higher catalytic activity as a retinol dehydrogenase than RDHE2 in in vitro assays, we decided to begin the in vivo functional analysis of these enzymes by focusing on RDHE2S. A RDHE2S-null mouse line was generated that carries a lacZ reporter element under the control of the native Rdhe2s promoter (Fig. S1A). Upon Cre and Flp excision, exon 4 in the Rdhe2s was deleted, and a frameshift mutation was introduced, which created a stop codon prior to catalytic residues (Fig. S1B). Mice were genotyped using allele-specific primers, with expected product size of 570 bp for WT mice and a 248-bp product for Rdhe2s−/− mice (Fig. S1C). Importantly, Rdhe2s−/− mice were obtained at Mendelian frequencies (28 of 100 genotyped), were fertile, and displayed no distinguishable phenotype, at least when maintained on a regular laboratory chow diet that contains 24.2 IU of vitamin A per gram. qPCR analysis of gene expression in skin of Rdhe2s−/− mice versus WT littermates did not reveal any significant differences (Fig. S2). Because Rdhe2 and Rdhe2s transcripts showed an overlapping expression pattern during development and adulthood, we reasoned that the lack of obvious phenotype in RDHE2S-null mice could be due to functional redundancy with RDHE2. To test this hypothesis, we generated two independent strains of Rdhe2−/−;Rdhe2s−/− double-knockout mice (DKO) lacking both RDHE2 and RDHE2S using CRISPR-mediated gene editing (Fig. 3). The first strain, DKO1, lacks exons 5–7 of Rdhe2 and exons 1–5 of Rdhe2s. The second strain, DKO2, lacks exon 5 in Rdhe2 and has an 8-bp deletion in exon 2 of Rdhe2s, causing a frameshift (Fig. 3A). The exact sequences resulting from these excisions are shown in Fig. S3. The absence of RDHE2 and RDHE2S proteins was confirmed by immunoblotting of microsomal fractions from skin of DKO mice with commercially available antibodies against murine RDHE2S (Fig. 3B, top) and antibodies against Xenopus rdhe2 (Fig. 3B, bottom), which recognize both murine RDHE2 and RDHE2S proteins. The DKO mice have been backcrossed for six generations to WT C57BL/6 mice to resolve any potential off-target mutations. Both strains of mice are fertile and produce homozygous and heterozygous offspring at the expected Mendelian ratio. Interestingly, DKO mice can be readily distinguished from WT littermates by the appearance of their eyes, which have puffy eyelids and an almond-like shape, compared with the round eyes in a similarly aged control animal (Fig. 3C). The highest expression level of Rdhe2 and Rdhe2s was observed in skin. Therefore, we began the investigation of the functional role of RDHE2 and RDHE2S by analyzing the retinol dehydrogenase activities of membrane fractions isolated from skin of DKO mice. Compared with WT mice, the retinol dehydrogenase activity of the microsomal fractions from DKO skin was reduced by ∼10-fold (p = 0.001), whereas the mitochondrial activity was reduced by ∼6-fold (p = 0.02) (Fig. 4A). Such a dramatic reduction in skin retinol dehydrogenase activity would be expected to have a major impact on RA biosynthesis and expression of RA target genes in DKO skin, possibly resulting in abnormal skin appearance. However, upon visual inspection, there were no discernable differences in the appearance of skin or hair between DKO and WT littermates. We reasoned that the differences in RA signaling between WT and DKO mice might be exacerbated under the conditions of vitamin A deficiency. To produce vitamin A–deficient mice, a cohort of pregnant dams was placed on a vitamin A–deficient diet at mid-gestation, and the pups were maintained on vitamin A–deficient diet until sacrificed. The vitamin A–deficient status was confirmed by analyzing the hepatic levels of retinyl esters (0.45 ± 0.28 nmol/mg) and retinol (0.026 ± 0.022 nmol/mg). Dorsal skin samples collected from these mice were examined for expression levels of RA-regulated and retinoid metabolic genes by qPCR. Surprisingly, the expression patterns of these genes in skin of DKO mice appeared to be only partially consistent with reduced RA signaling (Fig. 4B). For example, the RA-inducible Cyp26b1 was down-regulated, but the expression levels of several other genes known to be regulated by RA (Dhrs3 and Rarβ) did not change or were significantly increased (Lrat, Stra6, Rbp1, Raldh2, and Dhrs9) (22Ross A.C.

Skin is a highly heterogeneous tissue composed of keratinocytes, hair follicles, sebaceous glands, fibroblasts, etc. The differentiation and growth of many of these cell types are affected by RA levels (4Everts H.B.

To determine the exact localization of RDHE2 and RDHE2S in skin, we carried out immunohistological analysis of skin sections using custom-made antibodies against Xenopus rdhe2 that recognize both murine proteins (18Belyaeva O.V.

This analysis showed that RDHE2 and RDHE2S proteins are abundant in sebaceous gland and in epidermis (Fig. 4C). This pattern was confirmed at the level of gene expression based on the activity of the Rdhe2s gene promoter, which was detected by β-gal staining assays in developing vibrissae and nasal pits of E14.5 Rdhe2s+/− embryos (Fig. 4D) and also in sebaceous glands of adult Rdhe2s+/− mice (Fig. 4E). Likewise, Rdhe2 transcripts were detected in sebaceous glands and epidermis of adult WT C57BL/J6 mice by in situ hybridization (Fig. 4F). To determine whether the absence of RDHE2 and RDHE2S affected the structure of skin, we sectioned DKO and WT dorsal skin samples from mice on a vitamin A–deficient (VAD) diet and analyzed skin histology. The most obvious difference between DKO and WT skin from littermates was the larger size of sebaceous glands and a longer hair shaft in DKO skin (Fig. 4G). This observation suggested that the hair follicles in the skin of DKO mice were in growth phase (anagen), whereas in WT skin they were in resting (telogen) phase. Furthermore, whereas the WT mice had characteristic telogen features at P50, such as a condensed dermal papilla and lack of an inner root sheath, the DKO littermate dorsal skin was in anagen, demonstrated by the enlarged dermal papilla and thickening of the keratinocyte strand between the dermal papilla and club hair (Fig. 4H). To obtain independent and quantitative evidence that hair follicles were in anagen phase in skin of DKO mice, we carried out qPCR analysis of genes expressed in the pilosebaceous unit (26Gonzales K.A.U. Fuchs E. Skin and its regenerative powers: an alliance between stem cells and their niche.Dev.

Of 18 genes tested, three were down-regulated (Cd34, Krt15, and Lgr6), whereas most of the others were up-regulated (Fig. 5). The elevated expression of hair-follicle growth and differentiation marker genes in DKO skin relative to littermate WT skin suggested that the hair follicles of DKO mice enter anagen sooner than in WT skin. We tested this hypothesis by shaving the backs of male and female mice and monitoring their hair regrowth. As shown in Fig. 6, both sexes displayed an accelerated hair regrowth. However, in males, this was noticeable only during the second synchronized hair cycle at the age of 60–62 days, whereas in females, the difference was obvious already in the first cycle at P29. Importantly, the difference in the hair regrowth was observed not only on VAD diet (Fig. 6A) but also on chow diet (Fig. 6B). The daily progression of hair growth in the two strains versus matched WT littermates on VAD diet is shown in Fig. S4. Some members of the SDR superfamily exhibit broad substrate specificity (27Napoli J.L. 17β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 9 and other short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases that catalyze retinoid, 17β- and 3α-hydroxysteroid metabolism.Mol.

Ceruloplasmin ferroxidase activity being considered essential for macrophage iron release, macrophage iron overload is expected, but it is not found in hepatic and splenic macrophages in humans. Our objective was to get a better understanding of the mechanisms leading to iron excess in HA. A clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/ CRISPR associated protein 9 (Cas9) knockout of the Cp gene was performed on Sprague-Dawley rats. We evaluated the iron status in plasma, the expression of iron metabolism genes, and the status of other metals whose interactions with iron are increasingly recognized. In Cp-/- rats, plasma ceruloplasmin and ferroxidase activity were absent, together with decreased iron concentration and transferrin saturation. Similarly as in humans, the hepatocytes were iron overloaded conversely to hepatic and splenic macrophages. Despite a relative hepcidin deficiency in Cp-/- rats and the loss of ferroxidase activity, potentially expected to limit the interaction of iron with transferrin, no increase of plasma non-transferrin-bound iron level was found. Copper was decreased in the spleen, whereas manganese was increased in the plasma. These data suggest that the reported role of ceruloplasmin cannot fully explain the iron hepatosplenic phenotype in HA, encouraging the search for additional mechanisms.-Kenawi, M., Rouger, E., Island, M.-L., Leroyer, P., Robin, F., Remy, S., Tesson, L., Anegon, I., Nay, K., Derbré, F., Brissot, P., Ropert, M., Cavey, T., Loréal, O.

The aim of this study was to assess whether malaria infections were clustered in areas with long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) alone, indoor residual spraying (IRS) alone, or a combination of LLINs and IRS interventions, and to determine the risk factors for the observed malaria clustering in southern-central Ethiopia. Methods A cohort of 34,548 individuals residing in 6,071 households was followed for 121 weeks, from October 2014 to January 2017. Both active and passive case detection mechanisms were used to identify clinical malaria episodes, and there were no geographic heterogeneity in data collection methods. Using SaTScan software v 9.4.4, a discrete Poisson model was used to identify high rates of spatial, temporal, and spatiotemporal malaria clustering. A multilevel logistic regression model was fitted to identify predictors of spatial malaria clustering. Results The overall incidence of malaria was 16.5 per 1,000 person-year observations. Spatial, temporal, and spatiotemporal clustering of malaria was detected in all types of malaria infection (P. falciparum, P. vivax, or mixed). Spatial clustering was identified in all study arms: for LLIN + IRS arm, a most likely cluster size of 169 cases in 305 households [relative risk (RR) = 4.54, P<0.001]; for LLIN alone arm a cluster size of 88 cases in 103 households (RR = 5.58, P<0.001); for IRS alone arm a cluster size of 58 cases in 50 households (RR = 7.15, P<0.001), and for control arm a cluster size of 147 cases in 377 households (RR = 2.78, P<0.001). Living 1 km closer to potential vector breeding sites increased the odds of being in spatial clusters by 41.32 fold (adjusted OR = 41.32, 95% CI = 3.79–138.89). Conclusions The risk of malaria infection varied significantly between kebeles, within kebeles, and even among households in areas targeted for different types of malaria control interventions in low malaria transmission setting. The results of this study can be used in planning and implementation of malaria control strategies at micro-geographic scale. Trial registration PACT R2014 11000 882128 (8 September 2014)."

In the central nervous systems (CNSs) of both invertebrates and vertebrates, axons, dendrites, and synaptic connections are often spaced in precise three-dimensional registration. Examples include the laminar organization of the mammalian retina, neuropils in the insect visual system, the vertebrate cerebral cortex, and the dorsal horn of the spinal cord (Kolodkin and Hiesinger, 2017Kolodkin A.L.

Additional investigation, however, is required if researchers are to more fully understand the relationship between lamination and neural circuit elaboration and function. In the insect brain, a phylogenetically conserved neuropil structure called the central complex (CX) integrates neural circuits that underlie a wide range of behaviors (Hanesch et al., 1989Hanesch U.F. Fischbach K.-F. Heisenberg M. Neuronal architecture of the central complex in Drosophila melanogaster.Cell Tissue Res. 1989; 257: 343-366Crossref Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The CX is composed of four neuropil substructures: the ellipsoid body (EB), the fan-shaped body (FB), the noduli (NO), and the protocerebral bridge (PB) (Figure 1A). In each CX substructure, axons and dendrites are precisely organized in multiple laminae (layers) along the dorsal-ventral (D-V) axis, in columns that are aligned adjacently in the horizontal plane, and in shells along the anterior-posterior (A-P) axis. At least 50 different types of small-field and large-field neurons innervate the CX (Hanesch et al., 1989Hanesch U.F. Fischbach K.-F. Heisenberg M. Neuronal architecture of the central complex in Drosophila melanogaster.Cell Tissue Res. 1989; 257: 343-366Crossref Scopus (307) Google Scholar, Young and Armstrong, 2010Young J.M. Armstrong J.D. Structure of the adult central complex in Drosophila: organization of distinct neuronal subsets.J. Comp. Neurol. 2010; 518: 1500-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In specific CX substructures, each small-field neuron restricts its processes to one or two columns but contacts one, or multiple, laminae, whereas each large-field neuron extends its processes to cover an entire single lamina across all columns. This organization allows information to flow in precisely defined patterns between small- and large-field neurons within the CX (Lin et al., 2013Lin C.Y. Chuang C.C. Hua T.E. Chen C.C. Dickson B.J.

A pair of helicon cells (Figure 1B, green) also elaborate their dendrites in dorsal FB layer 6 and are locally inhibited by the ExFl2-derived neuropeptide allatostatin A (AstA), suppressing sleep and promoting locomotion (Donlea et al., 2018Donlea J.M.

The helicon cells project their axons into the anterior EB to excite R5 axons (Omoto et al., 2017Omoto J.J. Keleş M.F. Nguyen B.M. Bolanos C. Lovick J.K. Frye M.A. Hartenstein V.

Thus, FB lamination might serve to control synaptic transmission and information flow among FB-projecting neurons. However, little is known about other types of FB neurons required for regulating sleep behavior or how FB neurons across different layers interact with one another. Here, we investigate the function of the secreted semaphorin Sema-2b and its receptor PlexB in the development of FB lamination and CX neuron function. We determine the consequences of disrupting neuronal process segregation between certain FB-projecting large- and small-field CX neurons with respect to neural connectivity between laminae. We also demonstrate a role for these small-field neurons in fly sleep behavior. These results define mechanisms that regulate neural-process lamination in the fly central brain and suggest that laminar organization of neural processes is necessary for regulating both anatomical and functional connectivity critical for normal adult behavior. Similarly to other CX substructures, the FB is innervated by both large-field and small-field neurons. For example, R84C10-GAL4 is expressed in ∼10–15 ExFl2 neurons per brain hemisphere, large-field neurons that project their axons to the dorsal FB (Figures 1D [red], 1Ei [green], and S1A [green]) (Young and Armstrong, 2010Young J.M. Armstrong J.D. Structure of the adult central complex in Drosophila: organization of distinct neuronal subsets.J. Comp. Neurol. 2010; 518: 1500-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). On the other hand, R37G12-GAL4 is expressed in ∼25–30 small-field PBG1-8.s-FBℓ3,4,5.s.b-rub.b (called “P-Fr”) neurons that elaborate their processes in the PB, medial FB (mFB), and a brain region that lies outside of the CX and is called the rubus (Figures 1C and 1D (green) and 1Eii (green)) (Wolff et al., 2015Wolff T.

Open table in a new tab The FB can be divided into at least nine laminae: from ventral to dorsal, laminae 1 through 9 (Figures 1B and 1C) (Wolff et al., 2015Wolff T. Iyer N.A. Rubin G.M. Neuroarchitecture and neuroanatomy of the Drosophila central complex: A GAL4-based dissection of protocerebral bridge neurons and circuits.J. Comp. Neurol. 2015; 523: 997-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Each lamina is innervated by specific types of small- and large-field neurons, several of which are shown in Figure 1E utilizing fly lines that express GFP selectively in these distinct neuronal types (Table 1). For example, large-field ExFl2 neurons project their axons within FB layer 6 (Figure 1Ei), and small-field P-Fr neurons extend their processes in layers 3–5 (Figure 1Eii). The additional GAL4 drivers shown in Figure 1E ([iii]–[vi]) label small-field neurons that serve as markers for different FB layers. Orthogonal to these FB laminae are columns formed by small-field neuron processes. FB columns, unlike FB laminae, are not often easy to recognize when they are labeled with bruchpilot (Brp) staining or when neuronal processes from particular small-field neuronal types are illuminated. However, here FB columns are revealed by the projections of axons from R45F08 and R33E04 neurons in layer 6 (Figures 1Ev and 1Evi, arrowheads) or more directly by sparse labeling of individual small-field neurons (Figure 1F). Although the FB neuropil can be observed at the beginning of pupae formation, we observed that most FB laminae are gradually formed during early pupal stages and that FB neurons display heterogeneous innervation dynamics (Figures S1A–S1D). This heterogeneity of FB neuron innervation during the formation of individual laminae suggests that multiple mechanisms underlie elaboration of complex FB connectivity. To investigate mechanisms that govern FB innervation, we examined the distribution of several guidance cues in the pupal central brain. Of particular interest, expression of the secreted semaphorin Sema-2b is highly enriched in the mFB from early pupal stages (Figure S2A, arrowheads), and it is highly expressed in FB layers 3–5 and layer 9 throughout mid-pupal stages and in the adult (Figures 2A and S2A). This is in contrast to the transmembrane semaphorin Sema-1a and the other secreted semaphorin in Drosophila, Sema-2a, which are only weakly detected by immunostaining and are broadly distributed throughout the FB during pupariation (data not shown). Sema-2b expression declines after eclosion and is apparently low in the adult brain (Figure S2A, arrow). Sema-2b expression is nearly completely absent from the EB (Figure 2A). Sema-2b-null mutant flies exhibit aberrant overall CX morphology and FB neuron lamination defects (Figure S3A and data not shown). Therefore, we used RNA interference (RNAi) to selectively knock down Sema-2b expression in the FB in order to examine Sema-2b function in FB development. The R92D04-GAL4 fly line is expressed in small-field FB neurons that innervate the mFB. The identities of these neurons are not known. However, their processes co-localize with Sema-2b protein in the mFB during early pupal stages (Figure 2B, arrowheads). Sema-2b-RNAi driven by R92D04-GAL4 successfully knocked down Sema-2b expression in R92D04 neurons (but not in other Sema-2b-expressing neurons that are not targeted by R92D04-GAl4) within the mFB (Figures 2B, blue arrows, and 2C). We used several lexA driver fly lines to label different groups of FB neurons in combination with R92D04-GAL4 driving UAS-Sema-2b-RNAi. We found that R13C03 and R28C12 neurons, which project their processes to layers 7 and 8 and to layer 2, respectively, were not affected by selective Sema-2b FB knock down (Figures S2Bi and S2Bii). The processes from R40E08 and R45F08 neurons, which target layer 6 and target layers 3 and 6, respectively, showed very mild lamination defects after Sema-2b-RNAi knock down (Figures S2Biii and S2Biv, arrows and arrowheads). However, loss of Sema-2b in R92D04 neurons altered the projections of P-Fr neurons, which we labeled here by using the R37G12-lexA line to drive expression of myristoylated tdTomato (mtdT) in these neurons (Figure 2D). In the absence of Sema-2b in FB layers 3–5, P-Fr neuron processes extend dorsally into layer 6 (Figure 2Diii, arrows and dashed lines, and Figure 2E) and also mis-project outside the FB into the EB and ventral FB (Figure 2Div, arrowheads). These results show that Sema-2b regulates FB neuron development in a layer-specific manner: neurons that project to the mFB are affected by loss of Sema-2b, but dorsal FB (dFB)- or ventral FB (vFB)-projecting neurons are not. Further, these FB targeting defects strongly suggest that Sema-2b acts as an attractive guidance cue to facilitate P-Fr neuron targeting in the mFB. We next used different GAL4 drivers to overexpress Sema-2b, a secreted protein, and a membrane-tethered form of Sema-2b (Sema-2b-TMGFP) (Wu et al., 2011Wu Z. Sweeney L.B. Ayoob J.C. Chak K. Andreone B.J. Ohyama T. Kerr R. Luo L. Zlatic M. Kolodkin A.L. A combinatorial semaphorin code instructs the initial steps of sensory circuit assembly in the Drosophila CNS.Neuron. 2011; 70: 281-298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) in dorsal and ventral FB layers, where Sema-2b is not normally expressed; we used R37G12-lexA driving mtdT to label P-Fr processes in these gain-of-function (GoF) experiments. We found that P-Fr processes were attracted to the ventral FB and dorsal NO when R83H12-GAL4 was used to overexpress Sema-2b (Figure 2Fiii) or Sema-2b-TMGFP (Figure S2Cii) in a group of PB-FB-NO (P-FN) neurons that normally target FB layer 1 and the NO. Sema-2a and Sema-2a-TMGFP were also overexpressed in P-FN neurons, and we observed that expression of Sema-2a (Figure 2Fii) or Sema-2a-TMGFP (Figure S2Ci) in P-FN neurons had little effect on P-Fr process targeting (Figure 2G). Taken together, these results show that Sema-2b, but not Sema-2a, functions as a local attractive cue in the mFB to non-cell-autonomously regulate lamination of small-field P-Fr neurons (Figure 2H). The transmembrane protein Plexin B (PlexB) is a Sema-2b receptor (Ayoob et al., 2006Ayoob J.C. Terman J.R. Kolodkin A.L. Drosophila Plexin B is a Sema-2a receptor required for axon guidance.Development. 2006; 133: 2125-2135Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and we next asked whether Sema-2b regulates P-Fr process development through PlexB signaling. PlexB mutant flies showed defects in CX morphology and P-Fr innervation; this is similar to what was observed in Sema-2b mutant flies (Figure S3A) and suggests that PlexB and Sema-2b function in the same pathway to regulate the CX development. In order to examine PlexB expression, we used a MiMIC15559 insertion located within the PlexB locus (Venken et al., 2011Venken K.J. Schulze K.L. Haelterman N.A. Pan H. He Y. Evans-Holm M. Carlson J.W. Levis R.W. Spradling A.C. Hoskins R.A. Bellen H.J. MiMIC: A highly versatile transposon insertion resource for engineering Drosophila melanogaster genes.Nat. Methods. 2011; 8: 737-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar) and employed the “Trojan” technique (Diao et al., 2015Diao F. Ironfield H. Luan H. Diao F. Shropshire W.C. Ewer J. Marr E.

PlexBGAL4 failed to complement the PlexBKG00878 (PlexBKG) null allele (Ayoob et al., 2006Ayoob J.C. Terman J.R. Kolodkin A.L. Drosophila Plexin B is a Sema-2a receptor required for axon guidance.Development. 2006; 133: 2125-2135Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), as indicated by the observation that PlexBGAL4/KG flies showed increased lethality prior to and after fly eclosion (Figures S3C and S3D). When UAS-PlexB or UAS-Myc-PlexB was expressed under the control of PlexBGAL4 in PlexBGAL4/KG flies, early lethality was almost completely rescued (Figure S3C), and late lethality was partially rescued (Figure S3D). These results suggest that PlexBGAL4 is a null, or very strongly hypomorphic, PlexB allele and that PlexBGAL4 driving PlexB expression functionally recapitulates endogenous PlexB. We also used PlexBGAL4 to drive PlexB expression from a UAS-Myc-PlexB allele to examine PlexB expression in the pupal brain. Interestingly, Myc-PlexB was detected at relatively high levels in the ventral and dorsal FB, an expression pattern that is complementary to that of Sema-2b, which is expressed in the medial FB (Figure S3E). To determine whether P-Fr neurons express PlexB, we expresed a nuclear-localized GFP (Stinger-GFP; Vef et al., 2006Vef O. Cleppien D. Loffler T. Altenhein B. Technau G.M. A new strategy for efficient in vivo sreening of mutagenized Drosophila embryos.Dev. Genes Evol. 2006; 216: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) under the control of PlexBGAL4. Stinger-GFP was observed in a large proportion, but not in all, of DAPI-labeled cell nuclei in fly brains (data not shown). When P-Fr neurons were labeled using R37G12-lexA to drive mtdT expression, Stinger-GFP was detected in all pupal P-Fr cell bodies (Figure S3F); this confirms that P-Fr neurons express PlexB. We next asked whether PlexB is cell-autonomously required for P-Fr neuron lamination. PlexBEcTM, a truncated PlexB protein lacking its cytoplasmic domain, functions as a dominant negative receptor, efficiently blocking PlexB function in vivo (Wu et al., 2012Wu Z. Andreone B.J. Kolodkin A.L. The coordinate regulation of sensory afferent CNS targeting and CNS longitudinal tract organization in Drosophila during neural development.J. Peripher. Nerv. Syst. 2012; 17: 34-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). We used three different approaches to assess how PlexBEcTM affects targeting of FB neurons, combining PlexBEcTM expression with a reporter gene to visualize P-Fr neuronal-process targeting in the FB (Figures 3A and 4A ).Figure 4Cell-Autonomous Requirement for PlexB in P-Fr Process LaminationShow full caption(A) Schematics showing two different approaches used here for expressing reporter genes in an individual neuron within a group.

In control animals, single CD8-GFP-labeled P-Fr neurons elaborate processes within a single column in FB layers 3–5; this is similar to other mtdT-expressing P-Fr neurons ([i] and [ii]). When PlexBEcTM was expressed in single P-Fr neurons, their processes ectopically innervated FB layer 6; they extended dorsally beyond other P-Fr neurons and expanded laterally to cover an area in layer 6 that was larger than their normal lateral columnar extent in more ventral layers ([iii] and [iv]).(E) Quantification of the normalized distribution of MARCM-labeled P-Fr neuron processes along the D-V axis, as in (C).

https://openalex.org/W2978543358,"Background The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score is commonly used in ICUs around the world, designed to assess the severity of the patient's clinical state based on function/dysfunction of six major organ systems. The goal of this work is to build a computational model to predict mortality based on a series of SOFA scores. In addition, we examined the possibility of improving the prediction by incorporating a new component designed to measure the performance of the gastrointestinal system, added to the other six components. Methods In this retrospective study, we used patients’ three latest SOFA scores recorded during an individual ICU stay as input to different machine learning models and ensemble learning models. We added three validated parameters representing gastrointestinal failure. Among others, we used classification models such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Neural Networks, Logistic Regression and a penalty function used to increase model robustness in regard to certain extreme cases, which may be found in ICU population. We used the Area under Curve (AUC) performance metric to examine performance. Results We found an ensemble model of linear and logistic regression achieves a higher AUC compared related works in past years. After incorporating the gastrointestinal failure score along with the penalty function, our best performing ensemble model resulted in an additional improvement in terms of AUC metrics. We implemented and compared 36 different models that were built using both the information from the SOFA score as well as that of the gastrointestinal system. All compared models have approximately similar and relatively large AUC (between 0.8645 and 0.9146) with the best results are achieved by incorporating the gastrointestinal parameters into the prediction models. Conclusions Our findings indicate that gastrointestinal parameters carry significant information as a mortality predictor in addition to the conventional SOFA score. This information improves the predictive power of machine learning models by extending the SOFA to include information related to gastrointestinal organ system. The described method improves mortality prediction by considering the dynamics of the extended SOFA score. Although tested on a limited data set, the results' stability across different models suggests robustness in real-time use."

The mechanism of the antifungal activity of compounds from this group has not been described to date. Among the large group of 5-substituted 4-(1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl) benzene-1,3-diol derivatives, the compound 4-(5-methyl-1,3,4-thiadiazole-2-yl) benzene-1,3-diol, abbreviated as C1, was revealed to be one of the most active agents against pathogenic fungi, simultaneously with the lowest toxicity to human cells. The C1 compound is a potent antifungal agent against different Candida species, including isolates resistant to azoles, and molds, with MIC100 values ranging from 8 to 96 μg/ml. The antifungal activity of the C1 compound involves disruption of the cell wall biogenesis, as evidenced by the inability of cells treated with C1 to maintain their characteristic cell shape, increase in size, form giant cells and flocculate. C1-treated cells were also unable to withstand internal turgor pressure causing protoplast material to leak out, exhibited reduced osmotic resistance and formed buds that were not covered with chitin. Disturbances in the chitin septum in the neck region of budding cells was observed, as well as an uneven distribution of chitin and β(1→3) glucan, and increased sensitivity to substances interacting with wall polymerization. The ATR-FTIR spectral shifts in cell walls extracted from C. albicans cells treated with the C1 compound suggested weakened interactions between the molecules of β(1→3) glucans and β(1→6) glucans, which may be the cause of impaired cell wall integrity. Significant spectral changes in the C1-treated cells were also observed in bands characteristic for chitin. The C1 compound did not affect the ergosterol content in Candida cells. Given the low cytotoxicity of the C1 compound to normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF), it is possible to use this compound as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of surface and gastrointestinal tract mycoses."

Comparing their transmission patterns and its association with transmitted drug resistance (TDR) is important to pinpoint transmission hotspots and to develop evidence-based treatment guidelines.Demographic, clinical and genomic data were collected from 3599 HIV-1 naive patients between 2001 and 2014. Sequences obtained from drug resistance testing were used for subtyping, TDR determination and transmission clusters (TC) analyses.In Portugal, transmission of subtype B was significantly associated with young males, while transmission of subtype G was associated with older heterosexuals. In Portuguese originated people, there was a decreasing trend both for prevalence of subtype G and for number of TCs in this subtype. The active TCs that were identified (i.e. clusters originated after 2008) were associated with subtype B-infected males residing in Lisbon. TDR was significantly different when comparing subtypes B (10.8% [9.5-12.2]) and G (7.6% [6.4-9.0]) (p = 0.001).TC analyses shows that, in Portugal, the subtype B epidemic is active and fueled by young male patients residing in Lisbon, while transmission of subtype G is decreasing. Despite similar treatment rates for both subtypes in Portugal, TDR is significantly different between subtypes."

Here, we sought to identify how mitochondrial function and cardiac metabolism are affected in a transgenic mouse model of enhanced cardiac glycolysis (GlycoHi) basally and following a short-term (7-day) high-fat diet (HFD). GlycoHi mice constitutively express an active form of phosphofructokinase-2, resulting in elevated levels of the PFK-1 allosteric activator fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. We report that basally GlycoHi mitochondria exhibit augmented pyruvate-supported respiration relative to fatty acids. Nevertheless, both WT and GlycoHi mitochondria had a similar shift toward increased rates of fatty acid–supported respiration following HFD. Metabolic profiling by GC-MS revealed distinct features based on both genotype and diet, with a unique increase in branched-chain amino acids in the GlycoHi HFD group. Targeted quantitative proteomics analysis also supported both genotype- and diet-dependent changes in protein expression and uncovered an enhanced expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) in the GlycoHi HFD group. These results support a newly identified mechanism whereby the levels of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate promote mitochondrial PDK4 levels and identify a secondary adaptive response that prevents excessive mitochondrial pyruvate oxidation when glycolysis is sustained after a high-fat dietary challenge.

We reported that, following bleomycin (bleo), knockin mice harboring the human R213G SNP (R213G mice) exhibit enhanced resolution of inflammation and protection against fibrosis, compared with wild‐type (WT) littermates. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the EC‐SOD R213G SNP promotes resolution via accelerated apoptosis of recruited alveolar macrophage (AM). RNA sequencing and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis 7 d postbleo in recruited AM implicated increased apoptosis and blunted inflammatory responses in the R213G strain exhibiting accelerated resolution. We validated that the percentage of apoptosis was significantly elevated in R213G recruited AM vs. WT at 3 and 7 d postbleo in vivo. Recruited AM numbers were also significantly decreased in R213G mice vs. WT at 3 and 7 d postbleo. ChaC glutathione‐specific γ‐glutamylcyclotransferase 1 (Chac1), a proapoptotic γ‐glutamyl cyclotransferase that depletes glutathione, was increased in the R213G recruited AM. Overexpression of Chac1 in vitro induced apoptosis of macrophages and was blocked by administration of cell‐permeable glutathione.

Rotifers are an important component of aquatic ecosystems, and genetic variation is essential to their ongoing adaptive diversification and local adaptation. In addition to coding sequence divergence, variation in gene expression may relate to variable heat tolerance, and can impose ecological barriers within species. Temperature plays a significant role in aquatic ecosystems by affecting species abundance, spatio-temporal distribution, and habitat colonization. Recently described (formerly cryptic) species of the Brachionus calyciflorus complex exhibit different temperature tolerance both in natural and in laboratory studies, and show that B. calyciflorus sensu stricto (s.s.) is a thermotolerant species. Even within B. calyciflorus s.s., there is a tendency for further temperature specializations. Comparison of expressed genes allows us to assess the impact of stressors on both expression and sequence divergence among disparate populations within a single species. Here, we have used RNA-seq to explore expressed genetic diversity in B. calyciflorus s.s. in two mitochondrial DNA lineages with different phylogenetic histories and differences in thermotolerance. We identify a suite of candidate genes that may underlie local adaptation, with a particular focus on the response to sustained high or low temperatures. We do not find adaptive divergence in established candidate genes for thermal adaptation. Rather, we detect divergent selection among our two lineages in genes related to metabolism (lipid metabolism, metabolism of xenobiotics)."

Analyses were performed to study the bacterial communities associated with Thrips tabaci in India. The complete bacterial metagenome of T. tabaci was comprised of 1662 OTUs of which 62.25% belong to known and 37.7% of unidentified/unknown bacteria. These OTUs constituted 21 bacterial phyla of 276 identified genera. Phylum Proteobacteria was predominant, followed by Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Cyanobacteria. Additionally, the occurrence of the reproductive endosymbiont, Wolbachia was detected at two locations (0.56%) of the total known OTUs. There is high variation in diversity and species richness among the different locations. Alpha-diversity metrics indicated the higher gut bacterial diversity at Bangalore and lowest at Rahuri whereas higher bacterial species richness at T. tabaci samples from Imphal and lowest at Jhalawar. Beta diversity analyses comparing bacterial communities between the samples showed distinct differences in bacterial community composition of T. tabaci samples from different locations. This paper also constitutes the first record of detailed bacterial communities associated with T. tabaci. The location-wise variation in microbial metagenome profile of T. tabaci suggests that bacterial diversity might be governed by its population genetic structure, environment and habitat."

https://openalex.org/W2975061401,"Human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived skeletal muscle progenitors (SMP)—defined as PAX7-expressing cells with myogenic potential—can provide an abundant source of donor material for muscle stem cell therapy. As in vitro myogenesis is decoupled from in vivo timing and 3D-embryo structure, it is important to characterize what stage or type of muscle is modeled in culture. Here, gene expression profiling is analyzed in hESCs over a 50 day skeletal myogenesis protocol and compared to datasets of other hESC-derived skeletal muscle and adult murine satellite cells. Furthermore, day 2 cultures differentiated with high or lower concentrations of CHIR99021, a GSK3A/GSK3B inhibitor, were contrasted. Expression profiling of the 50 day time course identified successively expressed gene subsets involved in mesoderm/paraxial mesoderm induction, somitogenesis, and skeletal muscle commitment/formation which could be regulated by a putative cascade of transcription factors. Initiating differentiation with higher CHIR99021 concentrations significantly increased expression of MSGN1 and TGFB-superfamily genes, notably NODAL, resulting in enhanced paraxial mesoderm and reduced ectoderm/neuronal gene expression. Comparison to adult satellite cells revealed that genes expressed in 50-day cultures correlated better with those expressed by quiescent or early activated satellite cells, which have the greatest therapeutic potential. Day 50 cultures were similar to other hESC-derived skeletal muscle and both expressed known and novel SMP surface proteins. Overall, a putative cascade of transcription factors has been identified which regulates four stages of myogenesis. Subsets of these factors were upregulated by high CHIR99021 or their binding sites were significantly over-represented during SMP activation, ranging from quiescent to late-activated stages. This analysis serves as a resource to further study the progression of in vitro skeletal myogenesis and could be mined to identify novel markers of pluripotent-derived SMPs or regulatory transcription/growth factors. Finally, 50-day hESC-derived SMPs appear similar to quiescent/early activated satellite cells, suggesting they possess therapeutic potential."
https://openalex.org/W2976524863,"Genomic replication is a highly regulated process and represents both a potential benefit and liability to rapidly dividing cells; however, the precise post-translational mechanisms regulating genomic replication are incompletely understood. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a serine/threonine phosphatase that regulates a diverse array of cellular processes. Here, utilizing both a gain-of-function chemical biology approach and loss-of-function genetic approaches to modulate PP2A activity, we found that PP2A regulates DNA replication. We demonstrate that increased PP2A activity can interrupt ongoing DNA replication, resulting in a prolonged S phase. The impaired replication resulted in a collapse of replication forks, inducing dsDNA breaks, homologous recombination, and a PP2A-dependent replication stress response. Additionally, we show that during replication, PP2A exists in complex with cell division cycle 45 (CDC45) and that increased PP2A activity caused dissociation of CDC45 and polymerase α from the replisome. Furthermore, we found that individuals harboring mutations in the PP2A Aα gene have a higher fraction of genomic alterations, suggesting that PP2A regulates ongoing replication as a mechanism for maintaining genomic integrity. These results reveal a new function for PP2A in regulating ongoing DNA replication and a potential role for PP2A in the intra-S-phase checkpoint."
https://openalex.org/W2977379184,"In order to contribute to conservation planning efforts for golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) in the western U.S., we developed nest site models using >6,500 nest site locations throughout a >3,483,000 km2 area of the western U.S. We developed models for twelve discrete modeling regions, and estimated relative density of nest sites for each region. Cross-validation showed that, in general, models accurately estimated relative nest site densities within regions and sub-regions. Areas estimated to have the highest densities of breeding golden eagles had from 132-2,660 times greater densities compared to the lowest density areas. Observed nest site densities were very similar to those reported from published studies. Large extents of each modeling region consisted of low predicted nest site density, while a small percentage of each modeling region contained disproportionately high nest site density. For example, we estimated that areas with relative nest density values <0.3 represented from 62.8-97.8% ([Formula: see text] = 82.5%) of each modeling area, and those areas contained from 14.7-30.0% ([Formula: see text] = 22.1%) of the nest sites.

https://openalex.org/W2975597892,"Japanese eel (Anguilla japonica) recruitment to Japan was very low during the early 2017−2018 recruitment season when most glass eels are usually caught, but catches increased in the late recruitment season when recruitment usually decreases. Concurrently, the Kuroshio meander south of Japan had formed again after the previous event ended in 2005. The role of the large meander and ocean circulation features such as the North Equatorial Current (NEC) in the unusual 2017−2018 Japanese eel recruitment timing-pattern was investigated using a three-dimensional particle tracking model that simulated swimming behaviors of virtual larvae (v-larvae) in addition to their drift in ocean currents. Four recruitment seasons were selected for when the Kuroshio large meander was present (2004−2005, 2017−2018) or absent (2009−2010, 2015−2016), and when NEC was shifted north (2004−2005, 2015−2016) or south (2009−2010, 2017−2018). The simulated recruitment timing-patterns were similar to the actual recent-year recruitment, with no early recruitment period v-larvae arrival to southern Japan and increased late period recruitment occurring. Rather than being related to the presence of the Kuroshio large meander, the late arrival appeared to be caused by a southward shifted, weak North Equatorial Current near the spawning area, a longer Subtropical Countercurrent eddy region retention time, and a weak Kuroshio during the early migration and recruitment period of those years. In the late recruitment period, the Kuroshio was stronger than other selected years near the East China Sea and south of Japan and v-larvae were transported more rapidly. The Kuroshio large meander may influence local eel recruitment in Japan, and the recirculation formed by the large meander could potentially enhance recruitment to the Tokai region. Oriented (northwestward) swimming v-larvae were less affected by the large meander, and showed higher recruitment success than those using along-current swimming. Although the Kuroshio large meander did not seem to be responsible for the unusual recruitment pattern in 2018, how Japanese eel larvae and glass eels actually cross out of the Kuroshio and reach coastal waters in Japan remains to be explored."
https://openalex.org/W2976201219,"The anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) is a large, multisubunit ubiquitin ligase involved in regulation of cell division. APC/C substrate specificity arises from binding of short degron motifs in its substrates to transient activator subunits, Cdc20 and Cdh1. The destruction box (D-box) is the most common APC/C degron and plays a crucial role in substrate degradation by linking the activator to the Doc1/Apc10 subunit of core APC/C to stabilize the active holoenzyme and promote processive ubiquitylation. Degrons are also employed as pseudosubstrate motifs by APC/C inhibitors, and pseudosubstrates must bind their cognate activators tightly to outcompete substrate binding while blocking their own ubiquitylation. Here we examined how APC/C activity is suppressed by the small pseudosubstrate inhibitor Acm1 from budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Mutation of a conserved D-box converted Acm1 into an efficient ABBA (cyclin A, BubR1, Bub1, Acm1) motif–dependent APC/CCdh1 substrate in vivo, suggesting that this D-box somehow inhibits APC/C. We then identified a short conserved sequence at the C terminus of the Acm1 D-box that was necessary and sufficient for APC/C inhibition. In several APC/C substrates, the corresponding D-box region proved to be important for their degradation despite poor sequence conservation, redefining the D-box as a 12-amino acid motif. Biochemical analysis suggested that the Acm1 D-box extension inhibits reaction processivity by perturbing the normal interaction with Doc1/Apc10. Our results reveal a simple, elegant mode of pseudosubstrate inhibition that combines high-affinity activator binding with specific disruption of Doc1/Apc10 function in processive ubiquitylation. The anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) is a large, multisubunit ubiquitin ligase involved in regulation of cell division. APC/C substrate specificity arises from binding of short degron motifs in its substrates to transient activator subunits, Cdc20 and Cdh1. The destruction box (D-box) is the most common APC/C degron and plays a crucial role in substrate degradation by linking the activator to the Doc1/Apc10 subunit of core APC/C to stabilize the active holoenzyme and promote processive ubiquitylation. Degrons are also employed as pseudosubstrate motifs by APC/C inhibitors, and pseudosubstrates must bind their cognate activators tightly to outcompete substrate binding while blocking their own ubiquitylation. Here we examined how APC/C activity is suppressed by the small pseudosubstrate inhibitor Acm1 from budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Mutation of a conserved D-box converted Acm1 into an efficient ABBA (cyclin A, BubR1, Bub1, Acm1) motif–dependent APC/CCdh1 substrate in vivo, suggesting that this D-box somehow inhibits APC/C. We then identified a short conserved sequence at the C terminus of the Acm1 D-box that was necessary and sufficient for APC/C inhibition.

https://openalex.org/W2977366716,"Nucleases are enzymes that can degrade genomic DNA and RNA that decrease the accuracy of quantitative measures of those nucleic acids. Here, we study conventional heating, standard microwave irradiation, and Lyse-It, a microwave-based lysing technology, for the potential to fragment and inactivate DNA and RNA endonucleases. Lyse-It employs the use of highly focused microwave irradiation to the sample ultimately fragmenting and inactivating RNase A, RNase B, and DNase I. Nuclease size and fragmentation were determined visually and quantitatively by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the mini-gel Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer system, with a weighted size calculated to depict the wide range of nuclease fragmentation. Enzyme activity assays were conducted, and the rates were calculated to determine the effect of various lysing conditions on each of the nucleases. The results shown in this paper clearly demonstrate that Lyse-It is a rapid and highly efficient way to degrade and inactivate nucleases so that nucleic acids can be retained for down-stream detection."
https://openalex.org/W2978151624,"Introduction Previous studies evaluating the association between clinically diagnosed Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) have generated conflicting results. This study is the first to assess whether AMD prevalence is higher in AD patients than non-AD controls by using histopathology to definitively diagnose AD. Methods This was a retrospective case-control study utilizing diagnostic information extracted from autopsy reports of patients age 75 and above, including 115 with a neuropathological diagnosis of AD and 57 age-matched normal controls. Results The rate of AMD was not significantly higher in AD cases (53.0%) than in controls (59.6%) (z = 0.820, p = 0.794). AMD severity as determined by Sarks score was similar between AD patients and controls (χ2 = 2.96, p = 0.706). There was also no significant association between Braak stage of AD severity and AMD (χ2 = 4.55, p = 0.602). Discussion No significant effect of AD diagnosis or pathologic severity on AMD comorbidity was found, suggesting that any shared mechanisms between AMD and AD may be nondeterministic."
https://openalex.org/W2978643409,"Aphids are major pests of wheat crop in Pakistan inflicting considerable economic losses. A better knowledge of landscape scale spatial distribution of aphids and their natural enemies could be used to improve integrated pest management programs. Therefore, the present study aimed to document spatio-temporal variations in populations of wheat aphids and their natural enemies in Pakistan. The 2-year survey study was carried out at ten experimental farms located in five districts of four contrasted agro-ecological zones of eastern Pakistan (Punjab area) i.e. District Chakwal in arid zone, Gujranwala in rice-cropped zone, Faisalabad in central mixed-cropped zone, and Khanewal and Multan in cotton-cropped zone. The dominant aphid species i.e. Schizaphis graminum, Rhopalosiphum padi, R. maidis and Sitobion avenae varied significantly among the five districts surveyed. The population of S. graminum was observed more abundant in arid, R. padi in rice, S. avenae in aird and rice, and R. maidis in cotton-I zones. Aphids ended their population dynamics on 25th March in central mixed-cropped zone and 12th April in other three zones. Various species of natural enemies, mainly Coccinella septumpunctata, C. undecimpunctata, Menochilus sexmaculata, Chrysoperla carnea, Syrphidae and parasitoid mummies were inconsistently observed in four agro-ecological zones. The population of C. septumpunctata, was observed more abundant in rice zone, C. undecimpunctata and C. carnea in cotton-I and arid zones, M. sexmaculata in cotton-I and II zones, Syrphidae in cotton-I zone and parasitoid mummies in rice and arid zones. There were no clear relationships between aphid and the natural enemy populations. The present study may serve as a baseline regarding distribution of wheat aphids and their natural enemies and the results provided insights for further studies on the potential top-down (natural enemies) versus bottom-up (fertilization and irrigation regimes) forces in management of wheat aphids in eastern Pakistan."
https://openalex.org/W2979100111,"Cinobufacini, the sterilized hot water extraction of dried toad skin, has been widely used in the treatment of inflammation and cancers. Recently we found cinobufacini could ameliorate dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in mice, but the underlying mechanism was not fully understood. In current study, we explored the effect of cinobufacini on gut microbiota in DSS-induced acute colitic mouse model by pyrosequencing of colonic contents.C57BL/6 mice were supplied with normal or 3.0% DSS containing drinking water. DSS-treat mice were gavaged daily either with vehicle (water) or cinobufacini (10.0 or 30.0 mg/kg) for 7 days. The composition of the gut microbiota was assessed by analyzing 16S rRNA gene sequences.Our data indicated that cinobufacini reversed DSS-induced gut dysbiosis and enhanced intestinal barrier integrity. Moreover, changing of some specific microbial groups such as Proteobacteria and Bacteroides was closely correlated with the re-establishment of intestinal equilibrium and the recovery of intestinal function.Cinobufacini prevents colitis in mice by modifying the composition and function of gut microbiota. The current study provides additional mechanistic insight in the therapeutic effect of cinobufacini treatment and may pave the way for clinical application of cinobufacini in colitis therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2976699686,"Bovine conglutinin is an immune protein that is involved in host resistance to microbes and parasites and interacts with complement component iC3b, agglutinates erythrocytes, and neutralizes influenza A virus. Here, we determined the high-resolution (0.97–1.46 Å) crystal structures with and without bound ligand of a recombinant fragment of conglutinin's C-terminal carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD). The structures disclosed that the high-affinity ligand N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (GlcNAc) binds in the collectin CRD calcium site by interacting with the O3′ and O4′ hydroxyls alongside additional specific interactions of the N-acetyl group oxygen and nitrogen with Lys-343 and Asp-320, respectively. These residues, unique to conglutinin and differing both in sequence and in location from those in other collectins, result in specific, high-affinity binding for GlcNAc. The binding pocket flanking residue Val-339, unlike the equivalent Arg-343 in the homologous human surfactant protein D, is sufficiently small to allow conglutinin Lys-343 access to the bound ligand, whereas Asp-320 lies in an extended loop proximal to the ligand-binding site and bounded at both ends by conserved residues that coordinate to both calcium and ligand. This loop becomes ordered on ligand binding. The electron density revealed both α and β anomers of GlcNAc, consistent with the added α/βGlcNAc mixture. Crystals soaked with α1–2 mannobiose, a putative component of iC3b, reported to bind to conglutinin, failed to reveal bound ligand, suggesting a requirement for presentation of mannobiose as part of an extended physiological ligand. These results reveal a highly specific GlcNAc-binding pocket in conglutinin and a novel collectin mode of carbohydrate recognition."
https://openalex.org/W2977722762,"Adoptive T cell therapy (ACT) has become a treatment option for viral reactivations in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT). Animal models have shown that pathogen-specific central memory T cells (TCM) are protective even at low numbers and show long-term survival, extensive proliferation and high plasticity after adoptive transfer. Concomitantly, our own recent clinical data demonstrate that minimal doses of purified (not in-vitro- expanded) human CMV epitope-specific T cells can be sufficient to clear viremia. However, it remains to be determined if human virus-specific TCM show the same promising features for ACT as their murine counterparts. Using a peptide specific proliferation assay (PSPA) we studied the human Adenovirus- (AdV), Cytomegalovirus- (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus- (EBV) specific TCM repertoires and determined their functional and proliferative capacities in vitro. TCM products were generated from buffy coats, as well as from non-mobilized and mobilized apheresis products either by flow cytometry-based cell sorting or magnetic cell enrichment using reversible Fab-Streptamers. Adjusted to virus serology and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-typing, donor samples were analyzed with MHC multimer- and intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) before and after PSPA. TCM cultures showed strong proliferation of a plethora of functional virus-specific T cells. Using PSPA, we could unveil tiniest virus epitope-specific TCM populations, which had remained undetectable in conventional ex-vivo-staining. Furthermore, we could confirm these characteristics for mobilized apheresis- and GMP-grade Fab-Streptamer-purified TCM products. Consequently, we conclude that TCM bare high potential for prophylactic low-dose ACT. In addition, use of Fab-Streptamer-purified TCM allows circumventing regulatory restrictions typically found in conventional ACT product generation. These GMP-compatible TCM can now be used as a broad-spectrum antiviral T cell prophylaxis in alloHSCT patients and PSPA is going to be an indispensable tool for advanced TCM characterization during concomitant immune monitoring."
https://openalex.org/W2972733544,"Spatially-explicit simulation models are commonly used to study complex ecological and socio-economic research questions. Often these models depend on detailed input data, such as initial land-cover maps to set up model simulations. Here we present the landscape generator EFFortS-LGraf that provides artificially-generated land-use maps of agricultural landscapes shaped by small-scale farms. EFForTS-LGraf is a process-based landscape generator that explicitly incorporates the human dimension of land-use change. The model generates roads and villages that consist of smallholder farming households. These smallholders use different establishment strategies to create fields in their close vicinity. Crop types are distributed to these fields based on crop fractions and specialization levels. EFForTS-LGraf model parameters such as household area or field size frequency distributions can be derived from household surveys or geospatial data. This can be an advantage over the abstract parameters of neutral landscape generators. We tested the model using oil palm and rubber farming in Indonesia as a case study and validated the artificially-generated maps against classified satellite images. Our results show that EFForTS-LGraf is able to generate realistic land-cover maps with properties that lie within the boundaries of landscapes from classified satellite images. An applied simulation experiment on landscape-level effects of increasing household area and crop specialization revealed that larger households with higher specialization levels led to spatially more homogeneous and less scattered crop type distributions and reduced edge area proportion. Thus, EFForTS-LGraf can be applied both to generate maps as inputs for simulation modelling and as a stand-alone tool for specific landscape-scale analyses in the context of ecological-economic studies of smallholder farming systems."
https://openalex.org/W2975977286,"Genome-wide association study (GWAS) loci for several immunity-mediated diseases (early onset asthma, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), primary biliary cholangitis, and rheumatoid arthritis) map to chromosomal region 17q12-q21. The predominant view is that association between 17q12-q21 alleles and increased risk of developing asthma or IBD is due to regulatory variants. ORM sphingolipid biosynthesis regulator (ORMDL3) residing in this region is the most promising gene candidate for explaining association with disease. However, the relationship between 17q12-q21 alleles and disease is complex suggesting contributions from other factors, such as trans-acting genetic and environmental modifiers or circadian rhythms. Circadian rhythms regulate expression levels of thousands of genes and their dysregulation is implicated in the etiology of several common chronic inflammatory diseases. However, their role in the regulation of the 17q12-q21 genes has not been investigated. Moreover, the core clock gene nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group D, member 1 (NR1D1) resides about 200 kb distal to the GWAS region. We hypothesized that circadian rhythms influenced gene expression levels in 17q12-q21 region and conversely, regulatory elements in this region influenced transcription of the core clock gene NR1D1 in cis. To test these hypotheses, we examined the diurnal expression profiles of zona pellucida binding protein 2 (ZPBP2/Zpbp2), gasdermin B (GSDMB), and ORMDL3/Ormdl3 in human and mouse tissues and analyzed the impact of genetic variation in the ZPBP2/Zpbp2 region on NR1D1/Nr1d1 expression. We found that Ormdl3 and Zpbp2 were controlled by the circadian clock in a tissue-specific fashion. We also report that deletion of the Zpbp2 region altered the expression profile of Nr1d1 in lungs and ileum in a time-dependent manner. In liver, the deletion was associated with enhanced expression of Ormdl3. We provide the first evidence that disease-associated genes Zpbp2 and Ormdl3 are regulated by circadian rhythms and the Zpbp2 region influences expression of the core clock gene Nr1d1."
https://openalex.org/W2978373124,"Weeds are the major limitation to efficient crop production, and effective weed management is necessary to prevent yield losses due to crop-weed competition. Assessments of the relative efficacy of weed control treatments by traditional counting methods is labor intensive and expensive. More efficient methods are needed for weed control assessments. There is extensive literature on advanced techniques of image analysis for weed recognition, identification, classification, and leaf area, but there is limited information on statistical methods for hypothesis testing when data are obtained by image analysis (RGB decimal code). A traditional multiple comparison test, such as the Dunnett-Tukey-Kramer (DTK) test, is not an optimal statistical strategy for the image analysis because it does not fully utilize information contained in RGB decimal code. In this article, a bootstrap method and a Poisson model are considered to incorporate RGB decimal codes and pixels for comparing multiple treatments on weed control. These statistical methods can also estimate interpretable parameters such as the relative proportion of weed coverage and weed densities. The simulation studies showed that the bootstrap method and the Poisson model are more powerful than the DTK test for a fixed significance level. Using these statistical methods, three soil disinfestation treatments, steam, allyl-isothiocyanate (AITC), and control, were compared. Steam was found to be significantly more effective than AITC, a difference which could not be detected by the DTK test. Our study demonstrates that an appropriate statistical method can leverage statistical power even with a simple RGB index."
https://openalex.org/W2975478061,"Prevalence of mentholated products for consumption has brought great importance to studies on menthol's metabolic pathways to ensure safety, design more potent derivatives, and identify therapeutic benefits. Proposed pathways of (-)-menthol metabolism based on metabolites found experimentally in previous works by Yamaguchi, Caldwell & Farmer, Madyastha & Srivatsan and Hiki et al. were not in agreement. This in silico approach is based on the three in vivo studies and aims to resolve the discrepancies. Reactions in the pathways are conjugation with glucuronic acid/sulfate, oxidation to alcohol, aldehyde & carboxylic acid, and formation of a four-membered/five-membered ring. Gas-phase structures, standard Gibbs energies and SMD solvation energies at B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) level were obtained for 102 compounds in the pathways. This study provides a more complete picture of menthol metabolism by combining information from three experimental studies and filling missing links in previously published pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2978976407,"With the introduction of multi-camera systems in modern plant phenotyping new opportunities for combined multimodal image analysis emerge. Visible light (VIS), fluorescence (FLU) and near-infrared images enable scientists to study different plant traits based on optical appearance, biochemical composition and nutrition status. A straightforward analysis of high-throughput image data is hampered by a number of natural and technical factors including large variability of plant appearance, inhomogeneous illumination, shadows and reflections in the background regions. Consequently, automated segmentation of plant images represents a big challenge and often requires an extensive human-machine interaction. Combined analysis of different image modalities may enable automatisation of plant segmentation in ""difficult"" image modalities such as VIS images by utilising the results of segmentation of image modalities that exhibit higher contrast between plant and background, i.e. FLU images. For efficient segmentation and detection of diverse plant structures (i.e. leaf tips, flowers), image registration techniques based on feature point (FP) matching are of particular interest. However, finding reliable feature points and point pairs for differently structured plant species in multimodal images can be challenging. To address this task in a general manner, different feature point detectors should be considered. Here, a comparison of seven different feature point detectors for automated registration of VIS and FLU plant images is performed. Our experimental results show that straightforward image registration using FP detectors is prone to errors due to too large structural difference between FLU and VIS modalities. We show that structural image enhancement such as background filtering and edge image transformation significantly improves performance of FP algorithms. To overcome the limitations of single FP detectors, combination of different FP methods is suggested. We demonstrate application of our enhanced FP approach for automated registration of a large amount of FLU/VIS images of developing plant species acquired from high-throughput phenotyping experiments."
