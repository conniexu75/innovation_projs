https://openalex.org/W2113844812,"We have surveyed the early stages in the development and differentiation of cultured mouse embryos for plasminogen activator production. This enzyme is first detectable by the sixth equivalent gestation day. Thereafter, cultured blastocysts produce plasminogen activator with a biphasic time course: in the first phase, enzyme secretion rises to a maximum at about the eighth day and then decreases; a second phase, during which more enzyme accumulates, begins somewhat later and continues to at least the fifteenth day. By fractionating the blastocyst into its constituent cell types, we have identified the trophoblast as the cells responsible for the first phase of enzyme synthesis. The pattern of enzyme production by the trophoblast is closely correlated with the invasive period of these cells in vivo and implies that plasminogen activator is involved in embryo implantation. The second phase of plasminogen activator production is due to parietal endoderm, which initiates enzyme synthesis upon differentiation from the inner cell mass. The properties of the parietal endoderm suggest that plasminogen activator may participate in the migration of these cells and/or in the metabolism of Reichert's membrane which accompanies embryo growth. These results are consistent with the concept, deveolped from work on other cell types, that plasminogen activator may represent a generalized mechanism for tissue remodeling and cell migration."
https://openalex.org/W2169121749,"A method for the clonal analysis of murine erythroleukemia cells has been developed which allows the precise characterization of the number of progeny produced by each cell and the degree of differentiation of each progeny cell. The potential of almost every cell in the culture can be monitored because a plating efficiency close to 100% has been achieved. The effects of treatment with an inducer of differentiation (DMSO) on the proliferative capacity of the treated cells have been studied with this technique. Cells from a mass culture treated with inducer give rise to colonies of differentiated progeny when subsequently cloned in the absence of inducer. Colonies exhibiting this phenotype represent the progeny of cells committed to the differentiation pathway by treatment with inducer. We observe that the commitment decision limits the subsequent proliferative capacity of the cell to four additional cell divisions. A quantitative analysis suggests that the commitment decision for each cell is made in a stochastic manner. Irreversible commitment to the expression of differentiated functions occurs with discrete probability per cell generation for many cell generations. The value for this probability is a function of the concentration of inducer (DMSO). A correlative biochemical study suggests that an irreversible commitment decision by a significant proportion of the population precedes or accompanies increases in cytoplasmic globin mRNA levels, one of the earliest detectable biochemical markers for erythroid differentiation in this system. A specific kinetic model based on these considerations has been developed to predict clonal phenotypes as a function of time and probability of commitment. Quantitative predictions based on this model are in excellent agreement with experimental observations. The effectiveness of a stochastic model in predicting the behavior of this system is discussed in relation to the stochastic behavior of normal hematopoiesis and the biochemical mechanisms which control these differentiation programs."
https://openalex.org/W1593949810,"Twenty-two proteins available to this laboratory were examined for their ability to crystallize from polyethylene glycol (PEG). Of the 22, 8 had been crystallized previously by conventional means and the remainder had yielded no crystals by other methods. Using a single broad screen with four different concentrations of five different molecular weight sizes of polyethylene glycol, 13 of these proteins were crystallized. Of the 13, 6 proteins were crystallized for the first time, one yielded crystals readily where only infrequent and irreproducible results were obtained before, and one other produced excellent quality crystals where only very disordered or twinned crystals were previously grown. In only one case did polyethylene glycol fail to yield crystals where other agents had succeeded. It is concluded that polyethylene glycol may be the best initial trial reagent for crystallization of proteins for x-ray diffraction analyses."
https://openalex.org/W2050577419,"We have analyzed electron micrographs of chromatin-associated fiber arrays from embryos of the milkweed bug, Oncopeltus fasciatus. The analysis has revealed that the arrays have highly ordered patterns of fiber spacings and lengths. These patterns support the interpretation that the fibers are nascent RNA with associated proteins (RNP fibers) which have resulted from transcription of the DNA in the underlying chromatin segment. In particular, the patterns indicate that the chromatin underlying each array is delimited by specific sites for initiation and termination of transcription. We apply the term transcription unti to a chromatin segment thus bounded. The analysis has further revealed that transcription units can be grouped into two principal classes—ribosomal and nonribosomal. Active transcription units of these two classes differ in DNA content, in their proximity to other active transcription units, and in their chromatin morphology. For certain developmental stages, fiber frequencies (that is, the numbers of fibers per μm of chromatin) are also useful in distinguishing ribosomal from nonribosomal arrays. The most definitive of the above classification criteria is chromatin morphology as observed under our preparative conditions. We propose the term rho chromatin for the unbeaded or smooth chromatin that underlies nascent ribosomal RNP fibers. DNA in rho chromatin has a calculated packing ratio of approximately 1.2 μm of B structure DNA per μm of chromatin. Nu chromatin is used to designate the beaded chromatin for which we calculate a DNA packing ratio of 1.6–2.3 in our preparations. This calculation for nu chromatin is based on the inference that the beads are nucleosomes (nu bodies, PS particles, unit particles). The beaded morphology is observed between fibers of nonribosomal transcription units as well as for most fiber-free chromatin. The detection of specific sites of transcriptional initiation and termination and the classification of transcription units can provide a basis for further analysis of transcriptional control."
https://openalex.org/W1972716292,"The relationship between hypothalamic temperature and metabolic heat production was measured during wakefulness, slow-wave sleep, and paradoxical sleep in unrestrained kangaroo rats (Dipodomys). Hypothalamic temperature was manipulated with chronically implanted, water-perfused thermodes while cortical electroencephalogram, electromyogram, metabolic rate, and body movement were continuously recorded. During slow-wave sleep, in comparison to wakefulness, there is a lowered threshold hypothalamic temperature for the metabolic heat production response and a lowered proportionality constant relating rate of metabolic heat production to hypothalamic temperature. During paradoxical sleep no increase in metabolic heat production could be elicited by lowering hypothalamic temperature, which indicates that the thermoregulatory system is inoperative. These results provide a basis for explaining the changes in various body temperatures, metabolic rate, and other thermoregulatory responses during sleep in a variety of mammals."
https://openalex.org/W1983400314,"The extent of cortical representation of the peripheral sensory field depends on its importance for species behavior. The orientation sound of the mustache bat (Pteronotus parnellii rubiginosus) invariably consists of long constant-frequency and short frequency-modulated components and is indispensable for its survival. A disproportionately large part of the auditory cortex of this bat is occupied by neurons processing the predominant components in the orientation signal and Doppler-shifted echoes. This disproportionate cortical representation related to features of biologically significant signals is comparable to that in the somatosensory and visual systems in many mammals, but it has not previously been observed in the auditory system."
https://openalex.org/W1553589468,"Thyroid slices were found to incorporate radioactivity from 14C-labeled sugars into the carbohydrate moiety of a polar lipid soluble in chloroform/methanol/water, 10/10/3. This radiolabeled glycolipid was purified by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and was shown to have as its monosaccharide constituents mannose, glucose, and glucosamine. This compound cloud also be labeled by incubation of thyroid slices with [3H]mevalonic acid or [32P]phosphate as demonstrated by the coincidence of elution profiles upon DEAE-cellulose chromatography. This suggested that the lipid portion of the molecule is a polyprenol derivative and the lipid-saccharide linkage region involves a phosphate bridge. Mild acid hydrolysis of the glycolipid labeled with 14C in its carbohydrate released a neutral oligosaccharide which on the basis of Bio-Gel filtration studies was shown to have a molecular weight of approximately 2,400. This oligosaccharide contained [14C]mannose and [14C]glucose in about the same ratio as that occurring in the intact glycolipid. The oligosaccharide-lipid appeared to be distributed rather widely in thyroid particulate fractions obtained after differential and density gradient centrifugation. Its highest specific activity occurred in fractions rich in endoplasmic reticulum. By means of pulse-chase experiments in slices a relationship was demonstrated between the disappearance of radioactivity from the lipid-bound oligosaccharide and its appearance in protein-bound form. When protein synthesis was inhibited by the addition of puromycin during the chase period of the experiment transfer of oligosaccharide from the lipid to protein appeared to be blocked and the level of radiolabeled oligosaccharide-lipid increased. The observation that mannose and glucose were similarly affected during the pulse-chase studies suggests that transfer of the intact oligosaccharide unit was involved in the addition of carbohydrate to protein."
https://openalex.org/W2075161888,"The surface proteins of cultured human skin fibroblasts were iodinated and then exposed to one or more of the following blood coagulation proteins: thrombin, fibrinogen, and factor XIII (plasma protransglutaminase). Radiolabeled polypeptides were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecylsulfate. After exposure to physiological concentrations of activated factor XIII (XIIIa), the band of radioactivity corresponding to the major labeled surface protein (fibronectin, molecular weight = 2.2 × 105 daltons) was cross-linked to a very high molecular weight complex. The cross-linking reaction was inhibited by fibrin (which is known to bind the catalytic subunit of XIIIa). Cross-linking of labeled cell surface fibronectin to fibrin could not be demonstrated. The fibrillar pattern of surface fibronectin appeared unaffected by cross-linking when studied by immunofluorescence. Cross-linking of cell surface fibronectin by XIIIa requires highly specific enzyme-substrate and protein-protein interactions, and may be an important physiological reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1988591703,"We have used lambda-32P-ATP and polynucleotide kinase to label stoichiometrically the 5' ends of DNA in intact isolated HeLa cell nucleosomes. DNA is not nicked or degraded during the modification reaction. We have used these modified nucleosomes to study both the distribution and the relative availability of sites within the nucleosome which are susceptible to digestion by DNAase l. The results show that the nucleosome contains a potential cleavage site every 10 nucleotides, with the exception of the site 80 nucleotides from the 5' end. Favored cleavage sites are located 20, 40, 50, 100, 120, and 130 nucleotides from the 5' end; sites 30 and 110 nucleotides from the 5' end are strongly disfavored, while the potential site 80 nucleotides from the 5' end is virtually never cleaved. These findings provide constraints for models of histone-DNA interactions within the chromatin subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1588285410,"Filamin, a protein recently identified in chicken gizzard (Wang, K., Ash, F., and Singer, S. J. (1975) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 72, 4483-4486), has been purified free of other components and its molecular properties have been examined. Filamin has a sedimentation constant (S020,w) of 8.86 S and a partial specific volume of 0.734 ml/g. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments give a value of 498,000 for the molecular weight of native filamin. From these data a frictional ratio of 2.32 has been calculated. On sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis, filamin migrates as a single protein band with an estimated molecular weight of 240,000. Filamin is a soluble protein and under a variety of conditions tested does not by itself form filaments or precipitate from solution. However, filamin binds to rabbit skeletal muscle F-actin, and the complex is readily sedimented by centrifugation to yield a gelatinous pellet containing actin and filamin. These results indicate that filamin is a dimeric protein with a moderate degree of asymmetry that binds to actin. The results also suggest that the distribution of filamin in cells is derived from its interaction with polymerized actin."
https://openalex.org/W1526111678,"Structural studies have been performed on an oligosaccharide-lipid from thyroid believed to be an intermediate in glycoprotein synthesis. For these investigations the compound was isolated from the gland in unlabeled form as well as differentially radiolabeled in its saccharide, lipid, and phosphate portions by incubation of slices with [14C]- or [3H]glucose, [3H]mevalonic acid and [32P]phosphate, respectively. The unlabeled oligosaccharide-lipid was obtained in a chloroform/methanol/water (10/10/3) extract in a yield of about 1 nmol/g of thyroid and was purified therefrom by DEAE-cellulose chromatography. The saccharide moiety released from the glycolipid by mild acid hydrolysis was isolated by gel filtration and contained 11 mannose, 1 to 2 glucose, and 2 N-acetylglucosamine residues. The reducing terminal position of the oligosaccharide was occupied by 1 of the glucosamine residues and from these analyses a molecular weight of 2,415 was calculated. That glucose is an integral part of the molecule was further demonstrated by the finding that during Dowex 50 chromatography it remained as a constituent of the positively charged oligosaccharide produced by deacetylation with alkaline borohydride at 80 degrees. The phosphorus content of the purified unlabeled oligosaccharide-lipid was determined to be 2 residues per molecule, suggesting the presence of a pyrophosphate bridge between its carbohydrate and lipid portions. Further evidence for such a linkage region was provided by characterization of the products from mild acid and alkaline hydrolysis of the differentially radiolabeled glycolipid. These included dolichyl mono- and pyrophosphate, oligosaccharide phosphate, and free oligosaccharide. Digestion with alpha-mannosidase of the radiolabeled glycolipid led to the release of 39% of its mannose while from the free oligosaccharide 53% of this sugar was removed. Acetolysis of the [14C]oligosaccharide yielded a mannobiose and mannotriose as well as larger fragments consisting of mannose, glucose, and glucosamine. Smith periodate degradation gave rise to a small core segment (6 glycose residues) made up only of mannose and glucosamine from which half of the mannose residues could be released by alpha-mannosidase digestion. From these studies a tentative structure for the carbohydrate moiety of the oligosaccharide-lipid has been proposed. In this formulation an inner core (periodate-resistant) made up of 4 mannose and 2 N-acetylglucosamine residues is attached to the pyrophosphate group by the most internal glucosamine. This core, as well as an additional mannose and 1 to 2 glucose residues, constitutes the alpha-mannosidase-resistant fragment. More peripherally are found other mannose residues, all in alpha-linkage. In this structural scheme the glucose is located so as to prevent the enzymatic release of more internally situated alpha-linked mannose residues."
https://openalex.org/W2006950127,"The partial pressure of oxygen in fetal blood decreases in proportion to the carboxyhemoglobin concentrations in fetal and maternal blood. Because fetal oxygen tensions normally equal 20 to 30 percent of the values for adults, this reduction can result in severe hypoxia of vital tissues. Decreases in oxygen tension may be a factor in the lower birth weights of infants born to women who smoke or are exposed to severe air pollution."
https://openalex.org/W1593455383,"Mersalyl inhibited the respiration of heart mitochondria under conditions that required the transport of (-)-carnitine and acyl(-)-carnitines. The exchange of external carnitine and acylcarnitines for intramitochondrial carnitine was also inhibited by mersalyl and 1 mM mersalyl proved suitable for the inhibitor-stop assay of carnitine acylcarnitine translocase. The carnitine-carnitine and (-)-carnitine-acetyl(-)-carnitine exchanges involved a mole to mole exchange. The carnitine-carnitine exchange did not require energy. The carnitine acylcarnitine translocase resembles the Pi transport system in inhibition by mersalyl and N-ethylmaleimide and in lack of a cation requirement for activity; yet the two are not identical inasmuch as operation of only the former transport system was inhibited by long chain acyl(+)-carnitines. Additional results render it improbable that the transport of carnitine and acylcarnitines is catalyzed by any other known mitochondrial transport systems. The carnitine acylcarnitine translocase activity is unlikely to be shared by one of the carnitine acyltransferases because the mersalyl inhibition of carnitine palmitoyltransferase and carnitine acetyltransferase was noncompetitivcase. Rapid acetylation of intramitocondrial free (-)-carnitine occurred when acetyl-CoA was generated intramitochondrially but not with exogenous acetyl-CoA. Theese observations substantiate the view (Pande, S. V. (1975) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 72, 883-887) that a system exists in mitochondria for the transport of carnitine and its esters and that the matrix has a pool of carnitine compounds which has access to that carnitine acyltransferase which is localized on the inner side of the inner mitochondrial membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1986952899,"Flagellar regeneration in gametes of Chlamydomonas reinhardi is initiated within 15–20 min after flagellar amputation and proceeds at a rapid but decelerating rate until by 90 min flagellar outgrowth is 80–85% complete. Sufficient flagellar protein reserves exist in the cytoplasm to allow regeneration of flagella normal length. Nevertheless, in vivo labeling with 14C-amino acids shows that microtubule protein and other flagellar proteins are synthesized de novo during flagellar regeneration. To determine whether tubulin is synthesized continuously by gametic cells or whether its synthesis is induced as a consequence of deflagellation, we have isolated polyribosomes from deflagellated and control cells, and analyzed the proteins produced by these polyribosomes during in vitro translation. Two proteins of 53,000 and 56,000 molecular weight which co-migrate with flagellar and chick brain tubulin on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and which selectively co-assemble with chick brain tubulin during in vitro microtubule assembly are synthesized by polyribosomes (or polyadenylated mRNA) from deflagellated cells. No microtubule proteins can be detected in the translation products synthesized by polyribosomes (or mRNA) from control cells, clearly indicating that deflagellation results in the induction of tubulin synthesis. Kinetics of tubulin synthesis demonstrate that induction takes place immediately after deflagellation; polyribosomes bearing tubulin mRNA can be detected in the cytoplasm in as little as 15 min after removal of flagella. Maximal rates of tubulin synthesis occur between 45 and 90 min after deflagellation when approximately 14% of the protein being synthesized by the cell is tubulin. This estimate of tubulin synthesis based on in vitro translation data agrees well with in vivo measurements of flagellar tubulin synthesis. While high levels of tubulin production extend well beyond the period of rapid flagellar assembly, synthesis begins to decline after 90 min, and by 180 min after deflagellation only low levels of tubulin mRNA are detectable in polyribosomes."
https://openalex.org/W2096864884,"Emetine reversibly inhibits protein synthesis in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Stable mutants which are 20–80 fold more resistant to the cytotoxic action of the drug can be isolated in a single step at a frequency of about 2–5 × 10−7. The frequency of such mutants is increased 30–50 fold by ethyl methane sulphonate mutagenesis, and the spontaneous rate of mutation to emetine resistance as measured by Luria-Delbruck fluctuation analyses is 4.9 × 10−7 mutations per locus per generation. Protein synthesis in extracts of the mutant cells is resistant to the inhibitory action of the emetine, indicating that the molecular lesion in these cells lies in the protein synthesis machinery."
https://openalex.org/W2120396987,"The 4S RNA genes in HeLa mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have been mapped by electron microscopy using the electron-opaque label ferritin. This method is based on the high affinity interaction between the protein, avidin, and biotin. 4S RNA, covalently coupled to biotin, was hybridized to single-stranded mtDNA. The hybrids were then labeled with ferritin-avidin conjugates. The positions of ferritin-labeled 4S RNA genes were determined relative to the rRNA genes on both heavy (H) and light (L) strands of mtDNA. This region was recognized as a duplex segment after hybridization either with rRNA in the case of H strands or with DNA complementary to rRNA in the case of L strands. Our studies suggest that at least nineteen 4S RNA genes are present in the HeLa mitochondrial genome. On the H strand, we have confirmed the nine map positions found in a previous electron microscope mapping study (Wu et al., 1972) and obtained evidence for three additional 4S RNA genes. On the L strand, seven 4S RNA genes have been mapped. The nineteen genes are distributed more or less uniformly around the genome. There is a pair of closely spaced genes, approximately 150 nucleotides apart, on the H strand, and another closely spaced pair on the L strand."
https://openalex.org/W2128346477,"DNA has been prepared from peripheral blood or cultured skin fibroblasts obtained from three Sicilian and one Greek δβ-thalassemia homozygotes. Globin-gene analysis was carried out using a cDNAβ probe, and the results indicate that δβ-thalassemia has arisen from a deletion of the β-globin genes. A similar result was obtained using DNA prepared from cultured skin fibroblasts from an individual homozygous for the Negro form of hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH). In both cases, the deletion has spared the Gγ and Aγ loci directing the γ chains of hemoglobin F, but it has not been possible to demonstrate any difference between the size of the deletion involved in the production of δβ-thalassemia and that which gave rise to HPFH. These experiments provide further direct evidence that deletions of critical areas of the γ-δ-β gene cluster result in persistent γ chain synthesis in adult life."
https://openalex.org/W1501712515,"Vitamin K is required for an enzymatic carboxylation of glutamyl residues in a microsomal protein precursor of plasma prothrombin to form gamma-carboxyglutamic acid. The enzyme system (carboxylase) which catalyzes this reaction has now been solubilized by extraction of the microsomes with Triton X-100 and has been shown to fix H14CO3- as gamma-carboxyglutamic acid residues in biologically active prothrombin. Enzyme activity requires O2 and vitamin K hydroquinone or vitamin K + NADH. Unlike the microsomal-bound carboxylase, soluble carboxylase activity is independent of either ATP or Mg2+ addition and is unaffected by either the ATP analog, adenyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate (AMP-P(NH)P, or EDTA. These observations suggest that the energy required to drive the carboxylation reaction is derived from the oxidation of the reduced form of vitamin K. Although the membrane-bound carboxylase is inhibited by Warfarin, this anticoagulant is ineffective as an inhibitor of the soluble enzyme. A second anticoagulant, 2-chloro-3-phytyl-1,4-natpthoquinone (chloro-K), differs from Warfarin in that it effectively inhibits both the membrane-bound and soluble carboxylases."
https://openalex.org/W1497863747,"Polydisperse proteoglycan subunit from bovine proximal humeral articular cartilage has been separated into a series of relatively monodisperse fractions which have been chemically and physically characterized. The proteoglycan subunit species of the lowest molecular weight contains the least chondroitin sulfate and had an amino acid composition relatively low in serine and glycine and relatively high in cysteine, methionine, and aspartic acid, almost identical to that of the hyaluronic acid-binding region of proteoglycan subunit isolated by Heinegard and Hascall (Heinegard, D., and Hascall, V.C. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 4250-4256). The molecular weight of proteoglycan subunit increases in proportion to its chondroitin sulfate content. As the molecular weight and chondroitin sulfate content of proteoglycan subunit increase, there is a parallel increase in the serine and glycine contents, and a decrease in the cysteine, methionine, and aspartic acid contents of proteoglycan subunit core protein. The pattern of polydispersity observed strongly supports the concept that proteoglycan subunit core protein contains a hyaluronic acid-binding region of constant size and composition and a polysaccharide attachment region of variable length and composition, composed of repeating peptide sequences containing serine and glycine in equimolar amounts."
https://openalex.org/W1487867291,"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor protein (nAChR) has been solubilized from rat cerebral cortices by extracting a crude membrane fraction with the nonionic detergent Triton X-100 (polyoxyethylene-p-t-octylphenol). The solubilized nAChR was partially purified by affinity chromatography (Naja naja siamensis alpha-toxin affinity arm, linked to Sepharose 4B) and characterized by binding of 125I-labeled alpha-bungarotoxin. The reaction of labeled toxin and nAChR appears to be second order with a rate constant (k1) equal to 0.38 X 10(5) M-1 S-1 at 20 degrees. The toxin-nAChR complex dissociates with a dissociation rate constant (k-1) of 1.23 X 10(-5) S-1 at 20 degrees (t 1/2 = 15.6 h). The kinetically determined dissociation constant (Kd) for the complex is 3.24 X 10(-10) M. A variety of cholinergic ligands were studied for their ability to inhibit binding of labeled toxin. The results indicate that the brain receptor is indeed nicotinic. The s20, w and v of the toxin-nAChR complex in 0.1% Triton were determined by velocity sedimentation in D2O and H2O sucrose gradients. The values are 12.9 S and 0.80 cm3 g-1. The Stokes radius of the complex determined by gel filtration equals 7.5 nm. The Mr of the complex calculated from the hydrodynamic parameters, and corrected for bound detergent, equals 357,000."
https://openalex.org/W2046332252,Treatment of the mussel Mytilus edulis with 6-hydroxydopamine or with alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine decreased dopamine and increased serotonin in the nervous system. Treatment with dopamine decreased serotonin concentrations and prevented the effect of 6-hydroxydopamine.

https://openalex.org/W2088328955,"Most of the reiterated ribosomal genes in the somatic cells of larvae of a mutant of Xenopus laevis appear to be protected from short-term nuclease digestion by being packaged in the form of chromatin subunits or nucleosomes. Since these mutant animals probably require all of their ribosomal genes to be active in order to maintain viability, at least some of the transcriptionally active gene sequences are probably associated with chromatin subunits. Thus, association of DNA with nucleosomes may not necessarily preclude template activity, although such association is probably of a dynamic rather than a static nature."
https://openalex.org/W2039803549,"An analysis of the phosphorylated and capped 5' termini of the heterogenous nuclear RNA of mouse L cells has revealed four types of structure: pppXp..., ppXp..., pXp..., and m7/GpppXmp.... The 5'triphosphate termini consists exclusively of pppGp... and pppAp..., whereas a large proportion of the 5' monophosphate termini are pUp.... The 5'diphosphate termini contain all four species of nucleotide in relative proportions that are roughly similar to those found at the Xm position of cap structures. These results indicate that initiation of hnRNA transcription occurre exclusively with purine nucleotides, and consequently that the hnRNA molecules containing pyrimidines at the 5' termini very probably arise by cleavages at internal sites of larger primary transcripts. Taken together with previous results relating cap structures of hnRNA and mRNA, the data favor a model in which some mRNA sequences are located at transcriptionally initiated proportions and others in internal regions of their precursors. According to this model, both the mRNA segments derived from initial 5' end, and those derived by cleavage at internal sites could be converted to diphosphate-terminated derivatives, which then condense with GTP to form cap structures according to the mechanism previously described for vaccinia and reovirus mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W2004019258,"Adenovirus type 2 DNA, specifically labeled at the termini for DNA replication, was prepared by isolation of viral DNA molecules which were completed during short pulses with 3H-thymidine. The distribution of radioactivity in the two complementary strands at the termini for DNA replication was determined by liquid phase hybridization and gelelectrophoresis. At the right-hand terminus, nearly all radioactivity was found in the viral h strand, whereas at the left-hand terminus, most radioactivity was confined to the viral l strand. The results suggest that both molecular ends serve as origins and termini for replication of adenovirus type 2 DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1493009822,"A choline-requiring strain of mouse fibroblast cells (LM cells) was cultured in suspension with choline, N,N'-dimethylethanolamine, N-monomethylethanolamine, or ethanolamine. These choline analogues were incorporated into membrane phospholipids as phosphatidyl-N,N'-dimethylethanolamine, phosphatidyl-N-monomethylethanolamine, and phosphatidylethanolamine. Plasma membranes, microsomes, mitochondria, and their respective lipids were isolated and the characteristic temperatures were determined by using two types of fluorescent probes: (a) beta-parinaric acid, a naturally occurring molecule, and (b) 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonic acid, a synthetic organic fluorophore. A computer-centered spectrofluorimeter capable of simultaneous measurement of absorbance, absorbance-corrected fluorescence, and relative fluorescence efficiency was utilized for on-line measurement of all fluorescence parameters. Plots of absorbance corrected fluorescence or of relative fluorescence efficiency versus temperature revealed the same five characteristic temperatures with both types of probe. These characteristic temperatures were independent of the phospholipid composition of the LM suspension cell membranes or their extracted lipids. Plasma membranes, microsomes, and mitochondria containing analogue phospholipids had similar (+/- 1 degree) characteristic temperatures. The presence of analogue phopholipids altered the binding characteristics of beta-parinaric acid with plasma membranes and plasma membrane lipids of LM suspension cells. The equilibrium dissociation constant of plasma membranes and plasma membrane lipids was decreased 2- and 5-fold, respectively, when the cells had been supplemented with ethanolamine. The minimum number of phospholipid molecules per probe binding site was approximately constant in the intact plasma membrane but increased (2-fold) in the isolated plasma membrane lipids. The presence of analogue phospholipids also altered the interaction of 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonic acid with LM cell membranes. The equilibrium dissociation constant of this probe interacting with mitochondrial lipid was decreased 40% by ethanolamine supplementation. The fluorescent properties of both probes were sensitive to the degree of methylation of the polar head group. The absolute values of absorbance-corrected fluorescence and relative fluorescence efficiency were different for each type of membrane from LM cells even with the same analogue supplement. Thus, it appears that LM cells maintain the characteristic temperatures which are a measure of the physical properties of their membranes, despite large alterations of the phospholipid polar head group composition."
https://openalex.org/W1521849887,"When prostaglandin A1 was incubated with a Tris/saline suspension of washed human red blood cells, a substantial amount was converted to polar metabolites. These were purified by solvent extraction, XAD-2 column, and cellulose thin layer chromatography and characterized by chromatography, amino acid analysis, and mass spectrometry. The polar metabolites were a mixture of two glutathione conjugates of prostaglandin A1. The first (approximately 40%) was identical with the product of the nonenzymic reaction of glutathione with prostaglandin A1. The second (approximately 60%) was formed from the first by reduction of the 9-keto group of the prostaglandin moiety. The latter compound was also prepared synthetically by treating the glutathione conjugate of prostaglandin A1 with sodium borohydride."
https://openalex.org/W1519716235,"Lectin inactivation of the cell surface enzyme 5'-nucleotidase has been studied in intact 13762 mammary ascites cells, cell membrane envelopes, membrane vesicles, and solubilized membranes as a means of understanding the effects of lectins on biochemical processes and the behavior of the enzyme in the membranes. The properties of the enzyme are essentially the same in the intact cells and in membrane envelopes prepared after zinc treatment of the cells. The enzyme has a Km of 25 muM and is inhibited by concanavalin A (Con A) by an apparent noncompetitive process, which is reversed by alpha-methylmannoside. Half-maximal inhibition requires about 50 mug of Con A per mg of membrane protein. The inhibition for the intact cells and membrane envelopes does not exhibit significant cooperativity. Membrane vesicles, prepared by EDTA extraction, and solubilized membranes show differences in the behavior of the nucleotidase toward Con A even though the Km of the enzyme (25 muM) and inactivation (noncompetitive) are essentially unchanged. The Hill coefficient for the inactivation process in solubilized membranes and membrane vesicles is shifted to near 2, indicating significant cooperativity in the Con A-enzyme interaction. It is suggested that this change in cooperativity may reflect a different mode of interaction with the membrane and increased enzyme mobility, although an alteration in enzyme subunit interactions cannot be ruled out at present."

A computer-centered spectrofluorimenter simultaneously measured the absorbance, absorbance-corrected fluorescence, and relative fluorescence efficiency of beta-parinaric acid incorporated into the membranes or isolated membrane lipids. These parameters were measured as a function of temperature. The probe revealed five characteristic breaks or changes in slope with both the plasma membranes as well as their extracted lipids. These discontinuities occurred at approximately 18, 23, 31, 38, and 43 degrees. The other isolated subcellular organelles, microsomes, and mitochondria, as well as their respective isolated lipids, exhibited approximately the same characteristic temperatures (+/- 1 degree) as plasma membranes. Thus, these data negate one criterion of the theory that an asymmetric distribution of characteristic temperatures exist across the membranes of LM cells."
https://openalex.org/W1594882911,"Binding of alpha-bungarotoxin, labeled with 125I, has been studied in crude membrane preparations of rat cerebral cortex. Membrane-bound receptors appear to consist of at least two saturable subsets: one accounts for the binding of about 50 fmol of toxin/mg of protein, the other binds 120 fmol/mg. For the high affinity sites the dissociation constant for interaction of toxin and receptor extrapolated to zero protein concentration is 9.2 X 10(-10) M. Competition with a variety of agonists and antagonists indicates that toxin binding exhibits the pattern expected for nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Toxin binding is inhibited by low concentrations of Ca2+ ions (50% inhibition at 3 mM) while higher concentrations are required for Mg2+, Na+, K+, and Li+ (50% inhibition at 0.5 M)."
https://openalex.org/W1590811805,"The olfactory marker protein was isolated and characterized from rat olfactory bulbs. Its properties and those of the olfactory marker protein isolated from the mouse are described. The rat protein was less acidic (pI = 5.0) than the mouse protein (pI = 4.7). However, the amino acid compositions were very similar: in both proteins arginine plus lysine accounted for 13 mol% and glutamate plus aspartate for 30 mol% of the total residues. Molecular weights of both proteins estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis were indistinguishable and estimated to be 16,500. The molecular weight of the native rat olfactory marker protein estimated by gel filtration techniques was 30,000, which is identical to the molecular weight of the native mouse and garfish olfactory marker proteins. This suggested a dimeric structure. The purified rat and mouse proteins behaved like species of 35,000 molecular weight on gel filtration."
https://openalex.org/W2053248329,"Embryonal carcinoma cells derived from murine teratocarcinomas are able to differentiate into the same variety of tissue types as early embryonic cells. Because embryonal carcinoma cells resemble those of the embryo at a stage before X chromosome inactivation has occurred in females embryonal carcinoma cells containing two X chromosomes were examined to determine whether both are genetically active. The specific activities of X-linked enzymes were measured in embryonal carcinoma cells containing either one or two X chromosomes. The activities in both cell types were similar, suggesting that only one X chromosome was active in the female cells. Further support for this conclusion came from experiments in which azaguanine-resistant mutants were recovered with similar frequencies from embryonal carcinoma cell lines containing one and two X chromosomes. Late replication of an X chromosome DNA was detected in one embryonal carcinoma cell line with two X chromosomes but not in another. This suggests that cells of these two lines were arrested at different developmental stages, and that late DNA replication may not be a necessary adjunct of X inactivation. Evidence is presented which suggests that X chromosome reactivation does not occur during differentiation of the cells in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1540769916,"The binding of the paramagnetic metal, Mn(II), to bovine prothrombin and the thrombin-mediated cleavage products of prothrombin, i.e. fragment 1 and the prethrombin 1 has been investigated. Analysis of the Scatchard plots of the binding data reveals that prothrombin has two high affinity Mn(II) binding sites with a Kd of 1.2 +/- 1.0 X 10(-5) M and approximately two to three lower affinity Mn(II) sites with a Kd of 1.3 +/- 1.0 X 10(-4) M. Positive cooperativity in Mn(II) binding to prothrombin was observed for the strong sites. Fragment 1, the phospholipid-binding region of prothrombin, possesses two high affinity Mn(II) sites with a Kd of 2.2 +/- 1.0 X 10(-5) M and at least two lower affinity sites with a Kd of approximately 2.5 +/- 1.0 X 10(-4) M. Positive cooperativity was not observed for the binding of Mn(II) to fragment 1. Prethrombin 1 binds one Mn(II) with a Kd of 3.2 +/- 1.0 X 10(-4) M. Using the values of free Mn(II) concentration, as determined by EPR measurements and the observed enhancements of the water proton relaxation rates at various concentrations of Mn(II) and protein, the binary enhancement values (epsilon b) of the metal-protein complexes were obtained. The extrapolated values are 11 +/- 0.4 for the initial prothrombin-binding sites, and 10 +/- 0.3 for the tight binding sites of fragment 1. The unique epsilon b value obtained for prethrombin 1 was 5.3 +/- 0.7. When Mn(II) was used in a Factor Xa-metal ion-phospholipid system for activation of prothrombin, the rate of generation of thrombin was less than or equal to 5% of that obtained when Ca(II) was employed in this activation system. Addition of Mn(II) to the same activation system containing Ca(II) resulted in a marked decrease in the rate of thrombin generation, suggesting that Mn(II) probably competes for the same sites on prothrombin as Ca(II). In agreement with this is the observation that the Mn(II) sites on prothrombin could be displaced by Ca(II) at high concentrations of Ca(II)."
https://openalex.org/W1532553135,"L-Methionine sulfoximine is a substrate of L-amino acid oxidase (Crotalus adamanteus), glutamine transaminase, and gamma-cystathionase. In the reaction catalyzed by L-amino acid oxidase, methionine sulfoximine is converted to aplph-imino-gamma-methylsulfoximinylbutyrate, which undergoes rapid gamma elimination yielding methane sulfinimide and 2-imino-3-butenoic acid. Methane sulfinimide is converted to methane sulfonamide, methane sulfinic acid, and methane sulfonic acid; 2-imino-3-butenoic acid is hydrolyzed to vinylglyoxylate, which polymerizes to an insoluble product. When the reaction is carried out in the presence of semicarbazide, the imine formed initially is quantitatively trapped as alpha-keto-gamma-methylsulfoximinylbutyrate semicarbazone, from which the free alpha-keto acid may be obtained. When the reaction is carried out in the presence of a mercaptan (RSH), a gamma exchange reaction occurs leading to formation of a new alpha-keto acid substituted in the gamma position by an SR-group; thus, alpha-keto-gamma-(beta-hydroxyethiol)butyric acid (S-(hydroxyethyl)-2-keto-4-mercaptobutyric acid) was obtained when L-methionine sulfoximine was oxidized in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol, and enzymatic transamination of this alpha-keto acid with L-glutamine gave the new amino acid, L-omega-hydroxyethionine. The reaction of L-methionine sulfoximine with gamma-cystathionase yields 1 mol each of alpha-ketobutyrate and methane sulfinimide; the latter is hydrolyzed almost exclusively to methane sulfinic acid. Transamination of L-methionine sulfoximine yields the corresponding alpha-keto acid (alpha-keto-gamma-methylsulfoximinylbutyrate), which is stable. Some of these reactions may occur in vivo, and thus contribute to the toxicity of L-methionine sulfoximine."

https://openalex.org/W1492116015,"An endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase has been purified extensively from hen oviduct extracts and found to have a somewhat broader substrate specificity than the previously reported endoglycosidases from Dipolcoccus pneumoniae and Streptomyces plicatus (Arakawa, M., and Muramatsu, T. (1974) J. Biochem. (Tokyo) 76, 307-317; Tarentino, A. L., and Maley, F. (1975) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 67, 455-462. The enzyme was shown to hydrolyze and di-N-acetylchitobiosyl bond in such compounds as Asn(GlcNAc)2(Man)3, Asn(GlcNAc)2(Man)5, Asn(GlcNAc)2(Man)6 and a glycopeptide from immunoglobulin M, (aa)x-Asn(GlcNAc)2(Man)3(Fuc)1. The capacity to hydrolyze the latter compound is a characteristic of the endoglycosidase from D. pneumoniae, but not that from S. plicatus. Competitive inhibition studies indicate that a single enzyme in the hen oviduct endoglycosidase preparation is probably responsible for hydrolyzing both fucose-containing the fucose-depleted substrates. The existence of an endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase in animal tissue may explain why oligosaccharides with N-acetylglucosamine on the reducing terminus accumulate in certain lysosomal storage diseases."

https://openalex.org/W141309616,"A soluble rat liver protein that stimulates microsomal methyl sterol oxidase activity has been isolated and purified to homogeneity by salt fractionation, differential heat inactivation, two calcium phosphate gel association, and Sephadex filtration. The protein, as isolated, may be dissociated with detergent into subunits with a molecular weight of approximately 10,300, as determined electrophoretically. In addition to this stimulatory protein, postmicrosomal supernatant fraction of rat liver contains a low molecular weight methyl sterol oxidase inhibitor, possibly cholesterol ester, which is removed during protein purification. Purified soluble protein enhances the observed rate of oxidative attack of the methyl sterol substrates, 4, 4-dimethyl-5alpha-cholest-7-en-3beta-ol and 4alpha-methyl-5alpha-cholest-7-en-3beta-ol. Addition of increasing amounts of either partially purified or homogeneous soluble protein yields hyperbolic stimulation, from which a K'm of about 7 muM has been calculated (based on a monomeric molecular weight of 10,300). Sequential additions of the soluble protein yield equal increments of stimulation. These results are consistent with the suggestion that the soluble protein may be a reactant in the oxidative process. Methyl sterol oxidase is inhitited in vitro by cholesterol, several oxygenated sterols, and cholesterol esters. The extent of inhibition is much greater when the soluble protein is present in the incubation. The inhibition is competitive with respect to methyl sterol substrate; cholesterol succinate, a water-soluble ester, is strongly inhibitory, K'i (ester)/K'm(substrate) approximately 0.2. Since end product inhibition of methyl sterol oxidase may be produced by accumulation of cholesterol or cholesterol metabolites, the soluble protein may participate in regulation of the activity of some microsomal enzymes of cholesterol biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1552068500,"Lysosome-free preparations of rat liver mitochondria take up hydroxo[57Co]cobalamin by a process which is dependent on mitochondrial swelling, rather than on energy or ion fluxes. The uptake system is saturable and unidirectional, leading to inside/outside concentration ratios of 17. The process also exhibits specificity: cyano[57Co]cobalamin is taken up less rapidly and to a lesser extent than hydroxocobalamin; methylcobalamin and adenoslcobalamin inhibit hydroxocobalamin uptake markedly, while cyanocobalamin does not. The [57Co]cobalamin ([57Co]Cbl) taken up is bound to a mitochondrial protein whose apparent molecular weight is 120,000 by Sephadex G-150 chromatography. Double reciprocal plots of bound [57Co]Cbl versus medium [57Co]Cbl concentration yield estimates for bound Cblmax of 29 pmol/mg of protein and for Kd is 8.2 muM. We conclude that mitochondrial uptake of cobalamins occurs via the diffusion of free cobalamins into the mitochondria and their subsequent binding to a high affinity mitochondrial protein(s) which we propose to be the source of the unidirectional character, the saturability, and the specificity of the uptake system."
https://openalex.org/W1954572762,"Reviewing the reaction of potassium cyanate, an antisickling agent, with alpha-amino groups of hemoglobin, it was found that the reaction was a slow process and requires a large excess of the reagent. The reason for the slow reaction rate of carbamylation of hemoglobin by cyanate is that cyanate itself does not react with hemoglobin. It is rather isocyanic acid, the reactive species, that reacts with hemoglobin. Since the pK of isocyanic acid is 3.8, only one out of 4,000 cyanate ions is present as isocyanic acid at physiological pH. Therefore, it appears that a large excess of cyanate ions is required to achieve the carbamylation of hemoglobin S, both in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, the pH optimum for carbamylation of carboxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin is 5.5 and, at pH 7.4, the reaction velocity drops to one-third for carboxyhemoglobin and one-half for deoxyhemoglobin. To seek an approach to reduce the dosage of cyanate and to increase the reaction velocity, an isocyanate derivative, methylisocyanate which is already in the reactive form, was tested for its antisickling activity and its reaction with hemoglobin S. It was found that methylisocyanate had antisickling activity and that only a stoichiometric amount to 2-fold excess of the reagent over hemoglobin S alpha-amino groups was required to prevent the sickling of erythrocytes. Methylisocyanate-treated sickle erythrocytes showed an increased oxygen affinity compared to untreated methylisocyanate reacted with alpha-amino groups of hemoglobin S and the reaction was complete in less than 1 min. Methylcarbamylated hemoglobin S had a higher minimum gelling concentration than the untreated hemoglobin S. There was no detectable reaction of free sulfhydryl and epsilon-amino groups of hemoglobin S with methylisocyanate. These results indicate that methylisocyanate, and probably other isocyanate derivatives, possesses powerful antisickling activity."
https://openalex.org/W1671041158,"Bovine Factor X is a zymogen involved in blood coagulation that is converted to activated Factor X in the presence of Ca(II) by the coagulant protein of Russell's viper venom. To monitor structural transitions in Factor X during conversion to activated Factor X, the ultraviolet absorption, fluorescence emission, and circular dichroism spectra of activated Factor X and Factor X were compared. The ultraviolet absorption difference spectrum in the aromatic region comparing activated Factor X and Factor X indicates minima at 292.5, 285, and 278 nm and a small maximum at 305 nm; these differences are due to tryptophan and tyrosine perturbations. The activation of Factor X at 25 degrees in the presence of 8.3 mM CaCl2 with the use of Factor X:venom coagulant protein in molar rations of 1500:1 yielded a time-dependent increase in this spectrum which was linear for about 60 min and which temporally paralleled the development of activated Factor X activity. The binding of Ca(II) to factor X or activated Factor X is associated with a red-shifted tryptophan difference spectrum; however, this perturbation appears to make only a small contribution to the total perturbation observed during Factor X activation. Solvent perturbation studies in 20% glycerol suggest that an average of 3.1 tryptophan residues and 9.0 tyrosine residues are exposed to solvent in Factor X in 8.3 mM CaCl2 at pH 7.4; an additional 0.5 tryptophan residue and tyrosine reside become exposed to solvent during activation of Factor X in 8.3 mM CaCl2. The activation of Factor X by the venom coagulant protein is associated with a small red shift in the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence emission spectrum. Far- and near-ultraviolet circular dichroism spectroscopy detected no difference between Factor X and activated Factor X. In summary, the activation of Factor X to activated Factor X appears associated with exposure of tryptophan and tyrosine side chains previously buried within the protein and with minimal changes in the secondary structur. These results suggest that conversion of Factor X to activated Factor X involves functionally important, but structurally subtle, changes in the three-dimentional structure."

These chromatin preparations were dissociated and then reconstituted in the presence of various non-histone protein fractions. cDNAov was used as a probe for measuring the level of mRNAov sequences synthesized in vitro from various reconstituted chromatins. Our results indicate that extractable non-histone proteins from stimulated chromatin are capable of activating the in vitro transcription of the ovalbumin gene when included in the reconstitution of withdrawn chromatin. On the other hand, addition of extractable non-histone proteins from withdrawn chromatin to stimulated chromatin does not affect the synthesis of mRNAov sequences. Therefore, the extractable non-histone proteins from stimulated chromatin contain a positive regulator(s) which controls the in vitro expression of the ovalbumin gene."
https://openalex.org/W1596663822,"A high affinity calcium-binding protein has recently been purified from the adrenal medulla (Kuo, I.C.Y., and Coffee, C.J. (1976) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 1603-1609). This protein is closely related in its chemical and physical properties to troponin-C (TN-C) of muscle tissue. Further examination of the adrenal medulla protein indicates that the removal of calcium is accompanied by a marked change in the conformation. This change in structure is similar, if not identical, to the calcium-dependent conformational change which has been described for skeletal muscle TN-C (Murray, A.C., and Kay, C.M. (1972) Biochemistry 11, 2622). The far ultraviolet circular dichroism spectrum of native adrenal medulla calcium-binding protein (AM-CBP) shows characteristic helical ellipticity bands at 222 and 207 nm. The helical content, as estimated from these data, is between 40 and 45%. Removal of calcium is accompanied by a change in ellipticity which corresponds to a decrease from 40 to 20% in the helical content. The near-ultraviolet circular dichroism spectrum shows negative dichroic bands at 262 and 268 nm which are characteristic of phenylalanine. These bands are relatively insensitive to changes in the calcium ion concentration. Sedimentation velocity studies likewise are indicative of a calcium-dependent structural alteration. The sedimentation coefficient of the native protein was observed to be 1.89 S. Similar measurements performed in the presence of 3 mM ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether) N,N, N', N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) gave a sedimentation coefficient of 1.50 S. The molecular weight, as determined by sedimentation equilibrium studies, was 16,000 regardless of whether the measurements were made in the presence of CaCl2 or EGTA. From the elution properties of AM-CBP on Sephadex G-100, the Stokes radius was observed to be 19.8 A in the presence of calcium and 21.9 A in the presence of EGTA. All of these changes which were induced by the addition of EGTA were completely reversible by the readdition of excess CaCl2. These data suggest that the removal of calcium from AM-CBP is accompanied by a pronounced conformational change which occurs without a molecular weight change. The decreased sedimentation coefficient, the increased Stokes radius, and the reduced helical content, which are observed for the apoprotein, indicate that removal of calcium results in a transformation from a compact symmetrical structure to one that is less ordered and more asymmetrical."
https://openalex.org/W1580703004,"The characteristics of Met-tRNAfMet binding to ribosomes (40 S and 80 S) were studied using a two-stage assay method (Gupta, N.K., Chatterjee, B. and Majumdar, A. (1975) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 65, 797) and the complexes formed were analyzed either by Millipore filtration or by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. The results are summarized as follows: (a) with both assay methods, Met-tRNAfMet binding to 40 S ribosomes was entirely dependent upon addition of a partially purified mixture of initiation factors and AUG codon; (b) this binding occurred over a wide Mg2+ concentration range; significant binding was observed even at 20 mM Mg2+; (c) upon addition of 60 S ribosomes, a significant part of Met-tRNAfMet bound to 40 S ribosomes was transferred to 80 S complex. This transfer reaction had a sharp Mg2+ optimum around 2 mM. Met-tRNAfMet-80 S-AUG complex thus formed was active in Met-puromycin synthesis; (d) Met-tRNAfMet deacylase present in crude 0.5 M KCl ribosomal wash is a potent inhibitor of the binding reaction as it deacylates Met-tRNAfMet in the Met-tRNAfMet-40 S-AUG complex; (e) glutaraldehyde (0.5%) degrades Met-tRNAfMet-40 S-AUG complex but increases the background binding of Met-tRNAfMet to 40 S ribosomes in the absence of AUG codon; (f) polynucleotides containing uracil and adenosine are strong inhibitors of Met-tRNAfMet binding to 40 S ribosomes. The order of inhibitory activities of the polynucleotides tested was as follows: poly(rU)-poly(rA) (2:1) greater than poly(rU)-poly(rA) (1:1) greater than poly(rU) greater than poly(rA). Other RNAs tested such as poly(rC), poly(rI)-poly(rC) and phi6 bacteriophage RNA (double-stranded) were without significant effects on the Met-tRNAfMet-binding reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1481953740,"Binding of a denaturated polypeptide chain derived from chick skin collagen, the alpha 1(I) chain, by isolated membranes of human platelets has been demonstrated. The process is reversible, and time- and protein concentration-dependent. The binding is specific, with an association constant of 1.88 X 10(-6) M. Prior treatment of the isolated membranes with trypsin, chymotrypsin, and pronase, resulted in significant inhibition of the 14C-labeled alpha 1 chain binding, but neuraminidase or collagenase treatment had no effect. Dissociation of the bound radioactivity and subsequent chromatographic analyses on carboxymethylcellulose and agarose A-1.5m revealed that the alpha 1 chain was unaltered. Scatchard plot analysis suggested that there are approximately 20,000 binding sites per platelet. The binding of the alpha 1 chain was inhibited by a glycopeptide derived from alpha 1, alpha 1-CB5 and by purified glucosylgalactosyl hydroxylysine, but was not affected by other cyanogen bromide peptides of alpha 1, namely alpha 1-CB3, -CB4, -CB7, and -CB8. Kinetic studies demonstrated that inhibition by the hydroxylysine glycoside is competitive. Dose-response curves of platelet aggregation induced by alpha 1 and the binding of alpha 1 by platelet membranes correlate closely. These results indicate that there are specific binding sites for collagen alpha 1 chain on platelet membranes, and that the carbohydrate moiety of the alpha 1 chain plays a role in the binding. The findings also support the hypothesis that the chick skin alpha 1 chain mediates platelet aggregation and the release reaction by acting on platelet membranes."

https://openalex.org/W1494636027,"31P relaxation studies reveal a 3-fold enhancement of the longitudinal relaxation rate of both phosphoryl groups of hemoglobin-bound 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate upon conversion of methemoglobin to fluoromethemoglobin presumably due to an order of magnitude increase in the electron spin relaxation time. The enhancement of the longitudinal components of 31P relaxation (T(-1)1pr) upon binding to hemoglobin is not exchange-limited, since it is more than an order of magnitude smaller than the effect observed on the transverse components (T(-1)2pr). From the observed paramagnetic component, T(-1)1M, of the bound state relaxation rate of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate, using the correlation time tau s obtained from the frequency dependence of water proton relaxation, we obtained an NMR root mean sixth distance from the four heme iron atoms to each of the 31P nuclei of 24 +/- 1 A. This is in excellent agreement with the x-ray crystallographic determination of this distance of (25 +/- 1) A in the 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate-deoxyhemoglobin complex, indicating that the spatial disposition of the allosteric site in the deoxy and oxy conformations of hemoglobin relative to the various heme irons may be the same, and that the same protein groups may be involved in binding 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate to the two forms of hemoglobin. Water proton relaxation studies reveal the existence of different conformational states of methemoglobins with 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate and inositol hexaphosphate. Inositol hexaphosphate alters the conformation to a strained (T) state with deoxy-like quaternary and tertiary globin structure as indicated by the finding that equimolar amounts of inositol heasphosphate induce gelation in a 4 mM sickle methemoglobin solution at temperatures greater than or equal 24 degrees. More interestingly, oxyhemoglobin S shows an identical thermodynamically reversible gelation behavior, with the same transition temperature (24 degrees), arguing against a mutual coupling of the protein conformation and the heme spin state in functional ferrohemoglobins. High ionic strengths (approximately 1 M) and pH values above neutrality block inositol hexaphosphate induced gelation of sickle met- and oxyhemoglobins. Unlike inositol hexaphosphate, the presence of saturating amounts of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate does not promote gelation of a 4 mM met- or oxyhemoglobin S solution."

https://openalex.org/W1483019450,"We have previously shown that antibodies specific for hemoglobin S could be fractionated by absorption of an antiserum to hemoglobin S to Sepharose containing a synthetic oligopeptide. betaS (1-13), corresponding to the first 13 amino acid residues of the beta chain of hemoglobin S. We report here that this antibody population, anti-betaS (1-13), shows considerable restriction of heterogeneity in isoelectric focusing studies and monospecificity on velocity ultracentrifugation in the presence of hemoglobin S. The binding of various hemoglobin species to anti-betaS (1-13) was studied using a double antibody radioimmunoassay with [14C]carbamoylated hemoglobin S. Carbonmonoxy-, oxy-, met-, and cyanmethemoglobin S reacted equally with the antibody, but deoxyhemoglobin (with or without organic phosphates) reacted differently. Hemoglobin A and several hemoglobin mutants with alterations in the NH2-terminal region of the beta chain did not displace labeled hemoglobin S from anti-betaS (1-13). BETAS chains reacted with the antibody, but less well than hemoglobin S, while betaA and alpha chains, and globins did not react with the antibody. The synthetic peptide, betaS (1-13), used for fractionation, reacted with the antibody about 300-fold less efficiently than hemoglobin S. BetaS (3-13) was even less reactive, while smaller peptides which included the valine residue at position 6 displaced little of the tracer [14C]carbamoylated hemoglobin S at concentrations as high as 10(-2) M. We interpret these results to indicate that this method of immunoabsorption has produced a monospecific subfraction of antibodies which is specific for the NH2-terminal region of the beta chain of hemoglobin S in its native conformation."
https://openalex.org/W1542160879,"The rate of activation of dog plasminogen by excess streptokinase showed a significant delay as compared to the rate of activation with catalytic amounts of streptokinase. Studies of the reaction at high streptokinase levels with the active center reagent, p-nitrophenyl-p-guanidinobenzoate showed that only a fraction (13%) of the potential active centers were developed in a equimolar mixture of streptokinase and dog plasminogen in 15s and more than 10 min were required for the formation of 1 mol of active sites. In the first 15s, the yield of active sites could not be increased by increasing streptokinase 10-fold over the molar concentration of plasminogen, suggesting that active center development rather than complex formation was the rate-limiting step. The delayed reactivity seen in this system provides an interesting model for the study of conformationally induced active center formation. With catalytic amounts of streptokinase, the activation proceeded rapidly but reached a plateau, indicating the loss of activator activity in the reaction mixture. With successive additions of fresh streptokinase, complete activation was achieved. Polyacrylamide gel electorphoresis showed that a stable streptokinase-plasmin complex formed. However, in contrast to the human plasmin-steptokinase complex, a potent plasminogen activator in which streptokinase is found as a residue of 37,000 daltons, dog plasmin-streptokinase complex contained a residue of 25,700 daltons and the complex was inactive against canine and human plasminogen.

In addition, one peptide, betaS (3-13), has also been synthesized by the original Merrifield method.

Peptides of the purity achieved by these methods may be used to fractionate antibodies to the native hemoglobin S, in the characterization of antigen-binding properties of specific antibodies, and in other studies of peptide-protein interactions."
