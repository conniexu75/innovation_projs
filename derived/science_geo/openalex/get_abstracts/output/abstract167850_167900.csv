https://openalex.org/W1973431915,"Heterozygous Tbx5(del/+) mice were generated to study the mechanisms by which TBX5 haploinsufficiency causes cardiac and forelimb abnormalities seen in Holt-Oram syndrome. Tbx5 deficiency in homozygous mice (Tbx5(del/del)) decreased expression of multiple genes and caused severe hypoplasia of posterior domains in the developing heart. Surprisingly, Tbx5 haploinsufficiency also markedly decreased atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) and connexin 40 (cx40) transcription, implicating these as Tbx5 target genes and providing a mechanism by which 50% reduction of T-box transcription factors cause disease. Direct and cooperative transactivation of the ANF and cx40 promoters by Tbx5 and the homeodomain transcription factor Nkx2-5 was also demonstrated. These studies provide one potential explanation for Holt-Oram syndrome conduction system defects, suggest mechanisms for intrafamilial phenotypic variability, and account for related cardiac malformations caused by other transcription factor mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2073506826,Genome-wide location analysis was used to determine how the yeast cell cycle gene expression program is regulated by each of the nine known cell cycle transcriptional activators. We found that cell cycle transcriptional activators that function during one stage of the cell cycle regulate transcriptional activators that function during the next stage. This serial regulation of transcriptional activators forms a connected regulatory network that is itself a cycle. Our results also reveal how the nine transcriptional regulators coordinately regulate global gene expression and diverse stage-specific functions to produce a continuous cycle of cellular events. This information forms the foundation for a complete map of the transcriptional regulatory network that controls the cell cycle.

Recently we reported that matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) modulate the activity of the CC chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein-3 by selective proteolysis to release the N-terminal tetrapeptide. Here we report the N-terminal processing, also at position 4–5, of the CXC chemokines stromal cell-derived factor (SDF)-1α and β by MMP-2 (gelatinase A). Robustness of the MMP family for chemokine cleavage was revealed from identical cleavage site specificity of MMPs 1, 3, 9, 13, and 14 (MT1-MMP) toward SDF-1; selectivity was indicated by absence of cleavage by MMPs 7 and 8. Efficient cleavage of SDF-1α by MMP-2 is the result of a strong interaction with the MMP hemopexin C domain at an exosite that overlaps the monocyte chemoattractant protein-3 binding site. The association of SDF-1α with different glycosaminoglycans did not inhibit cleavage. MMP cleavage of SDF-1α resulted in loss of binding to its cognate receptor CXCR-4. This was reflected in a loss of chemoattractant activity for CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor stem cells and pre-B cells, and unlike full-length SDF-1α, the MMP-cleaved chemokine was unable to block CXCR-4-dependent human immunodeficiency virus-1 infection of CD4+ cells. These data suggest that MMPs may be important regulatory proteases in attenuating SDF-1 function and point to a deep convergence of two important networks, chemokines and MMPs, to regulate leukocytic activity in vivo.

Two main families are classified by the spacing of the first two cysteine residues: i) the CC chemokine family that includes monocyte chemoattractant proteins (MCP)1-1 to -4 (2Van Coillie E.

Nature. 1996; 382: 829-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar). The two SDF-1 isoforms (α and β) of 67 and 72 amino acid residues, respectively, differ only at the C terminus due to differential splicing of a single gene. SDF-1 binds a specific cell surface receptor, CXCR-4, and is a potent chemoattractant for a variety of cells including resting T lymphocytes, monocytes, and CD34+ stem cells. One of the primary roles of SDF-1α and its cognate receptor is in the homing, retention, and maturation of early progenitor cells in the bone marrow (7Shen H. Cheng T. Olszak I. Garcia-Zepeda E. Lu Z. Herrmann S. Fallon R. Luster A.D. Scadden D.T. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 5027-5033Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), a major source of SDF-1α. However, SDF-1α is also involved in other cellular functions as demonstrated from gene-disruption studies (8Nagasawa T. Hirota S. Tachibana K. Takakura N. Nishikawa S. Kitamura Y. Yoshida N. Kikutani H. Kishimoto T. Nature. 1996; 382: 635-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1994) Google Scholar). Both SDF-1α and CXCR-4 knock-out mice exhibit similar phenotypes: they die in utero with severe developmental defects in the immune, circulatory, and central nervous systems (9Ma Q. Jones D. Borghesani P.R. Segal R.A. Nagasawa T. Kishimoto T. Bronson R.T. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9448-9453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1410) Google Scholar) indicating that this chemokine has important roles outside of the immune system. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 entry into CD4-expressing target cells is dependent upon binding CXCR-4 (10Feng Y. Broder C.C. Kennedy P.E. Berger E.A. Science. 1996; 272: 872-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (3622) Google Scholar) or CCR-5 (11Deng H. Liu R. Ellmer W. Choe S. Unutmaz D. Burkhardt M. Di Marzio P. Marmon S. Sutton R.E. Hill C.M. Davis C.B.

Nature. 1996; 381: 661-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (3189) Google Scholar), which are coreceptors for the T-tropic and M-tropic strains of HIV, respectively. That CXCR-4 interaction is required for viral entry is demonstrated by the ability of SDF-1α and synthetic CXCR-4-antagonist analogues to inhibit HIV infection (12Oberlin E. Amara A. Bachleerie F. Bessiaa C. Virelizier J.L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Schwartz O. Heard J.M. Clark-Lewis I. Legler D.F. Loetscher M. Baggiolini M. Moser B.

Med. 1996; 184: 1101-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (1267) Google Scholar). Tumor cell CXCR-4 expression has also been very recently shown to target circulating metastatic breast cancer cells to sites with high SDF-1 levels, such as bone and brain (14Muller A. Homey B. Soto H. Ge N. Catron D. Buchanan M.E. McClanghan T. Murphy E. Yuan W. Wagner S.N. Barrera J.L. Mohar A. Verastegui E. Zlotnik A. Nature. 2001; 410: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (4410) Google Scholar).In vivo, chemokines form chemoattractant gradients at very low tissue concentrations aided by binding and immobilization to glycosaminoglycan (GAG) side-chains of extracellular matrix proteoglycans. Chemokine activity is also regulated by chemokine and chemokine receptor expression, plasma membrane trafficking, endocytosis, and by proteolysis by CD 26 (15) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) of CC chemokines (16McQuibban G.A. Gong J.H. Tam E.M. McCulloch C.A.G. Clark-Lewis I. Overall C.M. Science. 2000; 289: 1202-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar) to modulate cellular responsiveness. MMPs are zinc-dependent endoproteinases with extracellular matrix-degrading activity that has been well characterized in vitro (17Nagase H. Woessner J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21491-21494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3852) Google Scholar). While this may prove to be an important aspect of MMP biology for the removal of large amounts of extracellular matrix in processes such as uterus involution and severe inflammatory disorders, evidence for the role of secreted MMPs in normal tissue remodeling and cell migration is extremely limited (18Sodek J. Overall C.M. Davidovitch Z. The Biological Mechanisms of Tooth Eruption and Root Resorption. EBSCO Media, Birmingham, AL1988: 303-311Google Scholar). Apart from MT1-MMP, knock-out mice of MMPs display remarkably minimal effects on matrix degradation, and only a few reports have demonstrated MMP cleavage products of matrix components in vivo (19Hughes C.E.

However, growing evidence shows that specific proteolysis and processing of both cell surface and secreted factors by MMPs alters the biological activity of these substrates. Examples of MMP-mediated release or activation of cytokines include Fas ligand (21Powell W.C. Fingleton B. Wilson C.L. Boothby M. Matrisian L.M. Curr.

Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33008-33013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and the CC chemokine MCP-3 (16McQuibban G.A. Gong J.H. Tam E.M. McCulloch C.A.G. Clark-Lewis I. Overall C.M. Science. 2000; 289: 1202-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar).Since MCP-3 and IL-8 are processed by MMPs, we hypothesized that other chemokines may also be novel substrates in the MMP degradome. Here, we have characterized the N-terminal processing of the CXC chemokine SDF-1 by MMP activity. The MMP-mediated removal of the first four residues of SDF-1α results in loss of CXCR-4 binding and agonist activity with a commensurate loss of ability to block HIV infection of CD4+ cells. This report presenting a new example of chemokine processing leading to inactivation by MMP activity and the first for CXC chemokine inactivation further suggests that MMPs may also process other chemokines in both the CXC and CC chemokine families. Hence, MMP proteolysis of chemokines may be an important emerging function of MMPs in vivo to control leukocyte migration and activity in a variety of normal processes and pathologies.DISCUSSIONChemokines are important regulators of leukocyte migration and function. For some chemokines maintenance of expression levels is critical for normal immune system function and tissue homeostasis, for others acute release induces transient fluxes of leukocyte migration in tissues. Indeed, inappropriate chemotactic signals are a contributing factor to pathological conditions including arthritis and fibrosis (42Gerard C. Rollins B.J. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 108-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar). In many pathologies disturbances in the proteinase/inhibitor balance leads to extracellular matrix destruction with MMPs proposed to be important effectors of this process. MMP activity is also critical for leukocyte and tumor cell migration (43Madri J. Graesser D. Haas T. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 749-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 44Deryugina E.I.

J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 160-167PubMed Google Scholar). Here we have investigated the proteolytic processing by MMPs of the CXC chemokine SDF-1α, a chemokine important for hematopoietic progenitor stem cell migration (7Shen H. Cheng T. Olszak I. Garcia-Zepeda E. Lu Z. Herrmann S. Fallon R. Luster A.D. Scadden D.T. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 5027-5033Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and for breast cancer metastasis (14Muller A. Homey B. Soto H. Ge N. Catron D. Buchanan M.E. McClanghan T. Murphy E. Yuan W. Wagner S.N. Barrera J.L. Mohar A. Verastegui E. Zlotnik A. Nature. 2001; 410: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (4410) Google Scholar).MMP-2 efficiently converts SDF-1α from a potent chemoattractant and HIV antagonist to a molecule, SDF-1α-(5–67), devoid of biological activity. Six of eight MMPs tested could cleave SDF-1α and β at position 4–5, and this redundancy suggests that physiologically SDF-1α cleavage in vivo is very likely a consequence of MMP expression. Indeed, MMP activity is present in bone marrow upon stimulation (46Janowska-Wieczorek A. Marquez L.A. Nabholtz J.M. Cabuhat M.L. Montano J. Chang H. Rozmus J. Russell J.A. Edwards D.R. Turner A.R. Blood. 1999; 93: 3379-3390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in inflammation of the brain (47Johnston J.B. Jiang Y. van Marle G. Mayne M.B. Ni W. Holden J. McArthur J.C. Power C. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 7211-7220Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The presence of a MMP-susceptible bond at position 4–5 in SDF-1α as well as MCP-3 (16McQuibban G.A. Gong J.H. Tam E.M. McCulloch C.A.G. Clark-Lewis I. Overall C.M. Science. 2000; 289: 1202-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar) and MCP-1, -2, and -4 3G. A. McQuibban, J.-H. Gong, J. P. Wong, I. Clark-Lewis, and C. M. Overall, submitted for publication.indicates that this may be a feature present in many chemokine sequences leading to widespread MMP cleavage susceptibility and resultant modulation of activity throughout the chemokine superfamily.Binding and cleavage specificities of MMPs is expanded by utilizing substrate-binding exosites on domains outside the catalytic domain (38Overall C.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 151: 79-120PubMed Google Scholar). Our previous study showed the importance of the hemopexin C domain in binding MCP-3 (16McQuibban G.A. Gong J.H. Tam E.M. McCulloch C.A.G. Clark-Lewis I. Overall C.M. Science. 2000; 289: 1202-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar) and here we demonstrate that it also binds SDF-1α. Moreover, the binding site for SDF-1α overlaps that for MCP-3 as shown by competition studies. This supports the hypothesis that a common chemokine-binding exosite is present on the MMP-2 hemopexin C domain. From the crystal structure of human MMP-2 (48Morgunova E. Tuuttila A. Bergmann U. Isupov M. Lindqvist Y. Schneider G. Tryggvason K. Science. 1999; 284: 1667-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar), a potential substrate-binding groove is formed at the contact face between the catalytic and hemopexin C domains. Molecular modeling suggests that this cleft may bind MCP-3 and from our competition experiments may therefore also bind SDF-1α. This is now under investigation in our laboratory.In addition to transcriptional regulation of chemokine expression following cytokine exposure and release by environmental stimuli (49Vecchi A. Massimiliano L. Ramponi S. Luini W. Bernasconi S. Bonecchi R. Allavena P. Parmentier M. Mantovani A. Sozzani S. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1999; 66: 489-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) the maintenance of tissue levels of chemokines is greatly facilitated by interactions with GAGs that “freeze” chemotactic gradients in the extracellular matrix. Chemokine association with GAGs has been well established for SDF-1α (50Amara A. Lorthioir O. Valenzuela A. Magerus A. Thelen M. Montes M.J. Virelizier L. Delepierre M. Baleux F. Lortat-Jacob H. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23916-23925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). A recent report has identified the C-terminal regions of SDF-1α that are responsible for GAG interaction and the mechanism for GAG-mediated presentation of the free N terminus of SDF-1α to CXCR-4 (40Sadir R. Baleux F. Grosdidier A. Imberty A. Lorat-Jacob H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8288-8296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). MMP-2 is also known to bind heparin sulfate via the hemopexin C domain (32Wallon U.M. Overall C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7473-7481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In the presence of molar excess GAGs, SDF-1α was still processed by MMPs to release the N-terminal tetrapeptide. This is an important finding as the in vivoactivity of SDF-1α is tightly linked to its GAG-binding properties, and in this GAG-bound form our data shows that SDF-1α retains MMP cleavage susceptibility.The in vivo role of SDF-1 processing by MMPs remains to be elucidated. However, our biochemical and cell culture data shows the potency of cleavage and inactivation of SDF-1 by multiple MMPs indicating that in physiological or pathological situations MMP activity has the potential to modulate multiple cellular processes mediated by SDF-1. A physiological consequence of MMP cleavage of SDF-1α may be to reduce the protective effects of SDF-1 in modulating HIV infection. Indeed, induction of MMP expression by HIV (47Johnston J.B. Jiang Y. van Marle G. Mayne M.B. Ni W. Holden J. McArthur J.C. Power C. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 7211-7220Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) leading to SDF-1 cleavage may be a virulence factor to increase infectivity. Together, this suggests the potential of MMP inhibitor drugs for novel therapeutic uses in AIDS.The mobilization and timed release of mature leukocytes and stem cells from the bone marrow may also be regulated by MMP activities. SDF-1α is involved in the homing and retention of early progenitor cells, in particular the migration of CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor stem cells between the fetal liver and bone marrow during development and maturation (52Peled A. Petit I. Kollet O. Magid M. Ponomaryov T. Byk T. Nagler A. Ben-Hur H Many A Shultz L. Lider O. Alon R. Zipori D. Lapidot T. Science. 1999; 283: 845-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (1452) Google Scholar). In mature animals the cytokine-stimulated release of CD34+ cells from the bone marrow is correlated with a significant increase in MMP expression, notably MMP-2 (46Janowska-Wieczorek A. Marquez L.A. Nabholtz J.M. Cabuhat M.L. Montano J. Chang H. Rozmus J. Russell J.A. Edwards D.R. Turner A.R. Blood. 1999; 93: 3379-3390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although it has been previously hypothesized that increased MMP expression facilitates chemotaxis of these cells across basement membranes by matrix degradation (51Janowska-Wieczorek A. Marquez L.A. Dobrowsky A. Ratajczak M.Z. Cabuhat M.L. Exp. Hematol. 2000; 28: 1274-1285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) we suggest that this increase may be primarily important in the processing of SDF-1α to an inactive form that induces the transient release of this population of cells into the circulation. Overall, the studies reported here reveal that MMP processing of chemokines is not limited to the CC-family and indicate that the intersection between the chemokine and MMP networks is broad with potentially important biological consequences. In particular, the inactivation of SDF-1 by multiple MMPs suggests a novel mechanism for the regulation of SDF-1 function in physiological and pathological situations. Chemokines are a super-family of structurally related chemoattractant cytokines critical for the directed migration of leukocytes (1Baggiolini M.

Med. 1996; 184: 1101-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (1267) Google Scholar). Tumor cell CXCR-4 expression has also been very recently shown to target circulating metastatic breast cancer cells to sites with high SDF-1 levels, such as bone and brain (14Muller A. Homey B. Soto H. Ge N. Catron D. Buchanan M.E. McClanghan T. Murphy E. Yuan W. Wagner S.N. Barrera J.L. Mohar A. Verastegui E. Zlotnik A. Nature. 2001; 410: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (4410) Google Scholar). In vivo, chemokines form chemoattractant gradients at very low tissue concentrations aided by binding and immobilization to glycosaminoglycan (GAG) side-chains of extracellular matrix proteoglycans. Chemokine activity is also regulated by chemokine and chemokine receptor expression, plasma membrane trafficking, endocytosis, and by proteolysis by CD 26 (15) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) of CC chemokines (16McQuibban G.A. Gong J.H. Tam E.M. McCulloch C.A.G. Clark-Lewis I. Overall C.M. Science. 2000; 289: 1202-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar) to modulate cellular responsiveness. MMPs are zinc-dependent endoproteinases with extracellular matrix-degrading activity that has been well characterized in vitro (17Nagase H. Woessner J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21491-21494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3852) Google Scholar). While this may prove to be an important aspect of MMP biology for the removal of large amounts of extracellular matrix in processes such as uterus involution and severe inflammatory disorders, evidence for the role of secreted MMPs in normal tissue remodeling and cell migration is extremely limited (18Sodek J. Overall C.M. Davidovitch Z. The Biological Mechanisms of Tooth Eruption and Root Resorption. EBSCO Media, Birmingham, AL1988: 303-311Google Scholar). Apart from MT1-MMP, knock-out mice of MMPs display remarkably minimal effects on matrix degradation, and only a few reports have demonstrated MMP cleavage products of matrix components in vivo (19Hughes C.E.

However, growing evidence shows that specific proteolysis and processing of both cell surface and secreted factors by MMPs alters the biological activity of these substrates. Examples of MMP-mediated release or activation of cytokines include Fas ligand (21Powell W.C. Fingleton B. Wilson C.L. Boothby M. Matrisian L.M. Curr.

Overall C.M. Science. 2000; 289: 1202-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). Since MCP-3 and IL-8 are processed by MMPs, we hypothesized that other chemokines may also be novel substrates in the MMP degradome. Here, we have characterized the N-terminal processing of the CXC chemokine SDF-1 by MMP activity. The MMP-mediated removal of the first four residues of SDF-1α results in loss of CXCR-4 binding and agonist activity with a commensurate loss of ability to block HIV infection of CD4+ cells. This report presenting a new example of chemokine processing leading to inactivation by MMP activity and the first for CXC chemokine inactivation further suggests that MMPs may also process other chemokines in both the CXC and CC chemokine families. Hence, MMP proteolysis of chemokines may be an important emerging function of MMPs in vivo to control leukocyte migration and activity in a variety of normal processes and pathologies. DISCUSSIONChemokines are important regulators of leukocyte migration and function. For some chemokines maintenance of expression levels is critical for normal immune system function and tissue homeostasis, for others acute release induces transient fluxes of leukocyte migration in tissues. Indeed, inappropriate chemotactic signals are a contributing factor to pathological conditions including arthritis and fibrosis (42Gerard C. Rollins B.J. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 108-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar). In many pathologies disturbances in the proteinase/inhibitor balance leads to extracellular matrix destruction with MMPs proposed to be important effectors of this process. MMP activity is also critical for leukocyte and tumor cell migration (43Madri J. Graesser D. Haas T. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 749-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 44Deryugina E.I.

Here we have investigated the proteolytic processing by MMPs of the CXC chemokine SDF-1α, a chemokine important for hematopoietic progenitor stem cell migration (7Shen H. Cheng T. Olszak I. Garcia-Zepeda E. Lu Z. Herrmann S. Fallon R. Luster A.D. Scadden D.T. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 5027-5033Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and for breast cancer metastasis (14Muller A.

Nature. 2001; 410: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (4410) Google Scholar).MMP-2 efficiently converts SDF-1α from a potent chemoattractant and HIV antagonist to a molecule, SDF-1α-(5–67), devoid of biological activity. Six of eight MMPs tested could cleave SDF-1α and β at position 4–5, and this redundancy suggests that physiologically SDF-1α cleavage in vivo is very likely a consequence of MMP expression. Indeed, MMP activity is present in bone marrow upon stimulation (46Janowska-Wieczorek A. Marquez L.A. Nabholtz J.M. Cabuhat M.L. Montano J. Chang H. Rozmus J. Russell J.A. Edwards D.R. Turner A.R.

Virol. 2000; 74: 7211-7220Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The presence of a MMP-susceptible bond at position 4–5 in SDF-1α as well as MCP-3 (16McQuibban G.A. Gong J.H. Tam E.M. McCulloch C.A.G. Clark-Lewis I. Overall C.M. Science. 2000; 289: 1202-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar) and MCP-1, -2, and -4 3G. A. McQuibban, J.-H. Gong, J. P. Wong, I. Clark-Lewis, and C. M. Overall, submitted for publication.indicates that this may be a feature present in many chemokine sequences leading to widespread MMP cleavage susceptibility and resultant modulation of activity throughout the chemokine superfamily.Binding and cleavage specificities of MMPs is expanded by utilizing substrate-binding exosites on domains outside the catalytic domain (38Overall C.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 151: 79-120PubMed Google Scholar). Our previous study showed the importance of the hemopexin C domain in binding MCP-3 (16McQuibban G.A. Gong J.H. Tam E.M. McCulloch C.A.G. Clark-Lewis I. Overall C.M. Science. 2000; 289: 1202-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar) and here we demonstrate that it also binds SDF-1α. Moreover, the binding site for SDF-1α overlaps that for MCP-3 as shown by competition studies. This supports the hypothesis that a common chemokine-binding exosite is present on the MMP-2 hemopexin C domain. From the crystal structure of human MMP-2 (48Morgunova E. Tuuttila A. Bergmann U. Isupov M. Lindqvist Y. Schneider G. Tryggvason K. Science. 1999; 284: 1667-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar), a potential substrate-binding groove is formed at the contact face between the catalytic and hemopexin C domains. Molecular modeling suggests that this cleft may bind MCP-3 and from our competition experiments may therefore also bind SDF-1α. This is now under investigation in our laboratory.In addition to transcriptional regulation of chemokine expression following cytokine exposure and release by environmental stimuli (49Vecchi A. Massimiliano L. Ramponi S. Luini W. Bernasconi S. Bonecchi R. Allavena P. Parmentier M. Mantovani A. Sozzani S. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1999; 66: 489-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) the maintenance of tissue levels of chemokines is greatly facilitated by interactions with GAGs that “freeze” chemotactic gradients in the extracellular matrix. Chemokine association with GAGs has been well established for SDF-1α (50Amara A. Lorthioir O. Valenzuela A. Magerus A. Thelen M. Montes M.J. Virelizier L. Delepierre M. Baleux F. Lortat-Jacob H. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23916-23925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). A recent report has identified the C-terminal regions of SDF-1α that are responsible for GAG interaction and the mechanism for GAG-mediated presentation of the free N terminus of SDF-1α to CXCR-4 (40Sadir R. Baleux F. Grosdidier A. Imberty A. Lorat-Jacob H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8288-8296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). MMP-2 is also known to bind heparin sulfate via the hemopexin C domain (32Wallon U.M. Overall C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7473-7481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In the presence of molar excess GAGs, SDF-1α was still processed by MMPs to release the N-terminal tetrapeptide. This is an important finding as the in vivoactivity of SDF-1α is tightly linked to its GAG-binding properties, and in this GAG-bound form our data shows that SDF-1α retains MMP cleavage susceptibility.The in vivo role of SDF-1 processing by MMPs remains to be elucidated. However, our biochemical and cell culture data shows the potency of cleavage and inactivation of SDF-1 by multiple MMPs indicating that in physiological or pathological situations MMP activity has the potential to modulate multiple cellular processes mediated by SDF-1. A physiological consequence of MMP cleavage of SDF-1α may be to reduce the protective effects of SDF-1 in modulating HIV infection. Indeed, induction of MMP expression by HIV (47Johnston J.B. Jiang Y. van Marle G. Mayne M.B. Ni W. Holden J. McArthur J.C. Power C. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 7211-7220Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) leading to SDF-1 cleavage may be a virulence factor to increase infectivity. Together, this suggests the potential of MMP inhibitor drugs for novel therapeutic uses in AIDS.The mobilization and timed release of mature leukocytes and stem cells from the bone marrow may also be regulated by MMP activities. SDF-1α is involved in the homing and retention of early progenitor cells, in particular the migration of CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor stem cells between the fetal liver and bone marrow during development and maturation (52Peled A. Petit I. Kollet O. Magid M. Ponomaryov T. Byk T. Nagler A. Ben-Hur H Many A Shultz L. Lider O. Alon R. Zipori D. Lapidot T. Science. 1999; 283: 845-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (1452) Google Scholar). In mature animals the cytokine-stimulated release of CD34+ cells from the bone marrow is correlated with a significant increase in MMP expression, notably MMP-2 (46Janowska-Wieczorek A. Marquez L.A. Nabholtz J.M. Cabuhat M.L. Montano J. Chang H. Rozmus J. Russell J.A. Edwards D.R. Turner A.R. Blood. 1999; 93: 3379-3390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although it has been previously hypothesized that increased MMP expression facilitates chemotaxis of these cells across basement membranes by matrix degradation (51Janowska-Wieczorek A. Marquez L.A. Dobrowsky A. Ratajczak M.Z. Cabuhat M.L. Exp. Hematol. 2000; 28: 1274-1285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) we suggest that this increase may be primarily important in the processing of SDF-1α to an inactive form that induces the transient release of this population of cells into the circulation. Overall, the studies reported here reveal that MMP processing of chemokines is not limited to the CC-family and indicate that the intersection between the chemokine and MMP networks is broad with potentially important biological consequences. In particular, the inactivation of SDF-1 by multiple MMPs suggests a novel mechanism for the regulation of SDF-1 function in physiological and pathological situations.

https://openalex.org/W2083312621,"Covalent attachment of the ubiquitin-related protein SUMO to other proteins participates in many processes including signal transduction, transcriptional regulation, and growth control. We report the characterization of Siz1 as an E3-like factor in the SUMO pathway. Siz1 is required for SUMO attachment to the S. cerevisiae septins in vivo and strongly stimulates septin sumoylation in vitro. Siz1 and the related protein Siz2 promote SUMO conjugation to different substrates at different stages of the cell cycle and, together, are required for most SUMO conjugation in yeast. Siz1, Siz2, and the PIAS (protein inhibitor of activated STAT) proteins form a conserved family defined by an unusual RING-related motif. Our results suggest that this family functions by promoting SUMO conjugation to specific substrates."
https://openalex.org/W2160855812,"Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV) has been implicated in the regulation of CRE-dependent transcription. To investigate the role of this kinase in neuronal plasticity and memory, we generated transgenic mice in which the expression of a dominant-negative form of CaMKIV (dnCaMKIV) is restricted to the postnatal forebrain. In these transgenic mice, activity-induced CREB phosphorylation and c-Fos expression were significantly attenuated. Hippocampal late LTP (L-LTP) was also impaired, whereas basic synaptic function and early LTP (E-LTP) were unaffected. These deficits correlated with impairments in long-term memory, specifically in its consolidation/retention phase but not in the acquisition phase. These results indicate that neural activity-dependent CaMKIV signaling in the neuronal nucleus plays an important role in the consolidation/retention of hippocampus-dependent long-term memory."
https://openalex.org/W2008431663,"Butyrate is derived from the microbial metabolism of dietary fiber in the colon where it plays an important role in linking colonocyte turnover and differentiation to luminal content. In addition, butyrate appears to have both anti-inflammatory and cancer chemopreventive activities. Using confocal microscopy and cell fractionation studies, butyrate pretreatment of a human colon cell line (HT-29 cells) inhibited the tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-induced nuclear translocation of the proinflammatory transcription factor NF-κB. Butyrate inhibited NF-κB DNA binding within 30 min of TNF-α stimulation, consistent with an inhibition of nuclear translocation. IκB·NF-κB complexes extracted from butyrate-treated cells were relatively resistant to in vitro dissociation by deoxycholate, suggesting a change in cellular IκB composition. Butyrate treatment increased p100 expression, an IκB that was not degraded upon TNF-α treatment. Butyrate also reduced the extent of TNF-α-induced IκB-α degradation and enhanced the presence of ubiquitin-conjugated IκB-α. The suppression of IκB-α degradation corresponded with a reduction in cellular proteasome activity as determined by in vitro proteasome assays and the increased presence of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins. The butyrate suppression of IκB-α degradation and proteasome activity may derive from its ability to inhibit histone deacetylases since the specific deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A had similar effects. These results suggest a potential mechanism for the anti-inflammatory activity of butyrate and demonstrate the interplay between short chain fatty acids and cellular proteasome activity.

The suppression of IκB-α degradation corresponded with a reduction in cellular proteasome activity as determined by in vitro proteasome assays and the increased presence of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins. The butyrate suppression of IκB-α degradation and proteasome activity may derive from its ability to inhibit histone deacetylases since the specific deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A had similar effects. These results suggest a potential mechanism for the anti-inflammatory activity of butyrate and demonstrate the interplay between short chain fatty acids and cellular proteasome activity. trichostatin A tumor necrosis factor-α nuclear factor-κB inhibitor-κB electrophoretic mobility shift assay 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid N-succinyl-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin Butyrate and other short chain fatty acids are generated in the intestine by the bacterial metabolism of dietary fiber.

Colonocytes utilize short chain fatty acids as their primary energy source, and evidence has been obtained that they undergo apoptosis in its absence (2Hague A. Butt A.J. Paraskeva C. Proc. Nutr.

The ability of butyrate to induce cancer cell apoptosis may contribute to the cancer preventive activities of dietary fiber (1Velazquez O.C. Rombeau J.L. Adv. Exp. Med.

Short chain fatty acids can also suppress intestinal inflammation: butyrate is effective for treating selected inflammatory conditions of the distal alimentary tract (13Kanauchi O. Iwanaga T.

Understanding the effects of short chain fatty acids on normal and transformed colonocytes could provide insight into the mechanisms that maintain intestinal health and function. It is not clear how all the beneficial aspects of short chain fatty acids are achieved. Considerable attention has focused on the influence of butyrate on cellular gene expression, derived in part from its ability to inhibit histone deacetylases (16Boffa L.C. Vidali G. Mann R.S. Allfrey V.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 3364-3366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Sealy L. Chalkley R. Cell. 1978; 14: 115-121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Histone acetylation plays a central role in regulating gene expression, and cellular treatment with butyrate stabilizes histones in their acetylated state. In addition, a number of transcription factors are directly regulated by acetylation, and butyrate can enhance their activity (including GATA-1 and p53) (18Liu L. Scolnick D.M. Trievel R.C.

We and others have reported that butyrate can modulate the activity of the transcription factor NF-κB in a number of different cell types including colon cancer cell lines, cells isolated from the lamina propria of the colon, and macrophages (22Chakravortty D.

Gastroenterology. 2000; 118: 724-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). The ability of butyrate to modulate NF-κB activity may arise from its ability to inhibit protein deacetylases. This conclusion is based on the finding that the specific deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA)1 also modulates NF-κB activity and that propionate, a weaker deacetylase inhibitor, is less effective than butyrate in altering NF-κB activity (25Inan M.S. Rasoulpour R.J. Yin L. Hubbard A.K. Rosenberg D.W. Giardina C. Gastroenterology. 2000; 118: 724-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). The ability of butyrate to modulate NF-κB activity resonates with its proposed cancer chemopreventive and anti-inflammatory activities since NF-κB regulates genes involved in controlling cell proliferation, cell death, immune response, and inflammatory responses. We have been particularly interested in the mechanism by which butyrate influences NF-κB activation since understanding this mechanism could reveal how colonocyte growth and inflammatory responses are designed to sense luminal content. For this reason we have been studying the mechanism by which butyrate influences NF-κB activation in the human colon-derived HT-29 cell line. NF-κB is regulated through the binding of inhibitory molecules referred to collectively as IκBs (26Baeuerle P.A. Cell. 1998; 95: 729-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 27Gilmore T.D. Koedood M. Piffat K.A. White D.W.

There are a number of IκBs, including IκB-α, IκB-β, IκB-ε, p105, and p100. NF-κB activation usually requires the phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome degradation of one or more IκB molecules (29Hatakeyama S. Kitagawa M. Nakayama K. Shirane M. Matsumoto M. Hattori K. Higashi H. Nakano H. Okumura K. Onoe K. Good R.A. Nakayama K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3859-3863Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 30Crinelli R.

Here we provide evidence that butyrate prevents the entrance of NF-κB into the nucleus triggered by TNF-α in part by suppressing cellular proteasome activity. Butyrate therefore influences the cell in a manner similar to the relatively new class of cancer chemotherapeutic and anti-inflammatory agents, the proteasome inhibitors (33Adams J. Palombella V.J.

HT-29 cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and were propagated in McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, nonessential amino acids, streptomycin (50 μg/ml), and penicillin (50 units/ml). All media were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. TNF-α was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) and used at a final concentration of 100 ng/ml. MG-132 was purchased from Calbiochem and used at a final concentration of 60 μm. Sodium butyrate was used at a final concentration of 4 mm. All butyrate treatments were performed for ∼24 h prior to further manipulation of the cells. TSA, purchased from Calbiochem, was used at a 10 μm concentration with TSA preincubations also performed for ∼24 h. Nuclear extracts were prepared based on a previously reported protocol with minor modifications as described in Inan et al. (25Inan M.S. Rasoulpour R.J. Yin L. Hubbard A.K. Rosenberg D.W. Giardina C. Gastroenterology. 2000; 118: 724-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). For the DNA binding assays, double strand NF-κB DNA oligonucleotide (Promega, Madison, WI) were end-labeled with [γ-32P] adenosine triphosphate (3000 Ci/mmol at 10 mCi/ml, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Binding reactions were performed by mixing 7.5 μg of nuclear extract (in 7.5 μl) with 2.5 μg of poly(dIdC) and 1 μg of bovine serum albumin to give a final volume of 14 μl. After a 15-min incubation on ice, 40 fmol of labeled oligonucleotide (1 μl) was added to each reaction mixture. Reaction mixtures were then transferred to room temperature for an additional 15 min. Reaction products were separated on a 4% polyacrylamide/Tris borate/EDTA gel and analyzed by autoradiography. EMSA and immunoblot images were scanned and quantified using NIH Image software. For supershift experiments, 1 μl (0.2 μg) of antibody was preincubated with cellular extract on ice for 30 min. After this preincubation, the binding reaction was performed as usual. The p65 C-20 and p50 N-19 supershifting antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Evidence for the specificity of the supershifting antibodies comes from the observation that they do not supershift nonspecific protein·DNA complexes observed on the EMSA gel, and they do not bind to nonspecific proteins on an immunoblot. In addition, antibodies against the other three NF-κB subunits do not supershift the TNF-α-activated NF-κB complexes from HT-29 cells, providing evidence that p65 and p50 are the predominant NF-κB subunits active in these cells (25Inan M.S. Rasoulpour R.J. Yin L. Hubbard A.K. Rosenberg D.W. Giardina C. Gastroenterology. 2000; 118: 724-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). For deoxycholate activation (38Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1988; 242: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1689) Google Scholar, 39Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1689-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), 10 μg of cytosolic extract was first incubated with deoxycholate at a final concentration of 0.6% for 10 min at 4 °C. One microliter of 10% Nonidet P-40 was then added, and the incubation continued for another 10 min at 4 °C. After this pretreatment, the supershift assay or regular binding reaction was performed as usual. For immunoblotting studies, 25 μg of cytoplasmic or nuclear protein (quantified by the Bio-Rad protein assay) was denatured under reducing conditions, separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose by voltage gradient transfer. The resulting blots were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk. Specific proteins were detected with appropriate antibodies using enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as recommended by the manufacturer. Immunoblotting antibodies against p52/p100 (K-27) and IκB-α (C-21) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. For immunofluorescence, HT-29 cells were grown on glass coverslips to 50–70% confluence. Following appropriate treatments, the cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with 100% methanol for 30 min at −20 °C. The methanol was removed, and permeabilizing reagent (0.3% Triton X-100, 2 mm EGTA, and 5 mm Pipes) was added to the surface of cells for 5 min at 4 °C. Goat serum (10%) diluted in phosphate-buffered saline was used to block nonspecific binding for 30 min following permeabilization. After blocking, the cells were incubated with a rabbit anti-p65 antibody (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a 1:200 dilution followed by incubation with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). Confocal imaging of cells was performed using a Bio-Rad MRC 600 microscope equipped with a 25-milliwatt krypton-argon laser. Cytosolic extract was prepared from control or butyrate-treated cells using a Nonidet P-40-containing lysis buffer (0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 m sucrose, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μm clasto-lactacystin β-lactone (Calbiochem)). Cytosolic extract (200 μl) was precleared with 10 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and then incubated with 3 μl of an anti-ubiquitin rabbit antibody (Calbiochem) overnight on ice. To demonstrate that the anti-ubiquitin immunoprecipitation was specific, control immunoprecipitation reactions were performed with a rabbit antibody raised against IκB-β (N-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Precipitation was performed by incubating extracts with 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose (3 h at 4 °C), centrifuging for 1 min at 12,000 × g, and then washing the pellet three times with ice cold lysis buffer. The pellets were then suspended in 60 μl of SDS gel loading buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting using an IκB-α antibody (C-21, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Proteasome activity in cytosolic extracts was quantified using the fluorogenic proteasome substrate Suc-LLVY-AMC (Calbiochem) (40Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2206) Google Scholar). Cytosolic extract (10 μg of protein in 5 μl) was incubated in a 100-μl reaction containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.035% SDS, and 70 μm Suc-LLVY-AMC at room temperature for 30 min. Fluorescence was measured in a microtiter plate fluorometer (excitation, 360 nm; emission, 460 nm). Proteasome-dependent activity was determined by performing the assay in the presence of the proteasome inhibitorclasto-lactacystin β-lactone (final concentration, 10 μm) (Calbiochem). Proteasome activity values shown were derived by subtracting the fluorescence obtained in the presence of this inhibitor from the values obtained in its absence. Assays were performed in triplicate, and statistical significance was determined with a paired Student's t test. Previous reports have indicated that the treatment of HT-29 cells with butyrate for 24 h dampens their ability to activate NF-κB in response to TNF-α stimulation (25Inan M.S. Rasoulpour R.J. Yin L. Hubbard A.K. Rosenberg D.W. Giardina C. Gastroenterology. 2000; 118: 724-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). NF-κB activation can be regulated at numerous steps, including its translocation into the nucleus. To determine whether nuclear translocation was being suppressed in butyrate-treated cells, the cellular localization of the NF-κB p65 subunit was determined by immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy. As shown in Fig.1 A, treatment of HT-29 cells with TNF-α alone resulted in the translocation of some of the cellular p65 into the nucleus. As has been described by other groups, p65 translocation into the nucleus is only partial in stimulated HT-29 cells and a large fraction of NF-κB remains in the cytoplasm (41Jobin C. Haskill S. Mayer L. Panja A. Sartor R.B. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 226-234PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of the HT-29 cells with 4 mm butyrate for 24 h prior to TNF-α stimulation prevented much of the TNF-α-induced nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit (Fig. 1 A). To confirm these data, a cell fractionation study was performed (Fig.1 B). In unstimulated cells, most of the cellular p65 was found in the cytosolic fraction of HT-29 cells. After TNF-α stimulation of HT-29 cells, a small fraction of the total cellular p65 appeared in the nuclear fraction. Consistent with the immunocytochemical analysis, pretreatment of cells with butyrate reduced the nuclear translocation of p65 into the nucleus by ∼50%. The inhibition of nuclear translocation is not observed for IκB-α or IκB-β, two proteins that can also shuttle between the cytoplasm and nucleus (Ref. 25Inan M.S. Rasoulpour R.J. Yin L. Hubbard A.K. Rosenberg D.W. Giardina C. Gastroenterology. 2000; 118: 724-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar and data not shown). These data indicate that butyrate inhibits a step in NF-κB activation at or prior to nuclear translocation. Fig. 2 A shows the influence of butyrate on the NF-κB DNA binding activity induced by TNF-α. The butyrate inhibition of NF-κB nuclear translocation (shown in Fig. 1) corresponded with a decrease in its DNA binding activity (with an estimated inhibition of 75%). The time course analysis shown in Fig.2 A revealed a consistent level of inhibition, consistent with a model in which butyrate suppresses the movement of NF-κB from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (as opposed to an increase in the rate of NF-κB nuclear export). Also shown in Fig. 2 B is a DNA competition analysis, which demonstrated that the protein·DNA complex inhibited by butyrate is a specific NF-κB complex. The butyrate suppression of NF-κB DNA binding activity is reflected in a reduced level of NF-κB-regulated gene expression (24Wu G.D. Huang N. Wen X. Keilbaugh S.A. Yang H. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1999; 66: 1049-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 25Inan M.S. Rasoulpour R.J. Yin L. Hubbard A.K. Rosenberg D.W. Giardina C. Gastroenterology. 2000; 118: 724-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). A number of different IκB molecules control NF-κB activity in HT-29 cells, and it is possible that butyrate is suppressing NF-κB nuclear translocation by altering the IκB composition of the cytoplasm. To determine whether this was the case, we first characterized the IκB·NF-κB complexes extracted from control and butyrate-treated cells. The IκB·NF-κB complexes can be disrupted in vitro by incubation of cytosolic extracts with deoxycholate (38Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1988; 242: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1689) Google Scholar,39Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1689-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The level of NF-κB DNA binding activity activated in vitro by deoxycholate was consistently lower in extracts from butyrate-treated cells (Fig.3 A). The identity of the deoxycholate-activated DNA binding activity as NF-κB was confirmed by a supershift reaction using antibodies that have previously been shown to specifically recognize the p65 and p50 NF-κB subunits (Fig.3 A). Fig. 3 B shows that the level of p65 was the same in butyrate-treated and control cells. These data suggest that there is an alteration in the composition of IκB·NF-κB complexes in butyrate-treated cells with butyrate inducing the formation of complexes that are relatively resistant to deoxycholate dissociation. To determine how IκB·NF-κB complexes might be altered in butyrate-treated HT-29 cells, we determined the expression levels of a number of known IκBs by immunoblotting. We were unable to detect increased expression of IκB-β, IκB-ε, or p105 (data not shown). The p100 IκB, however, was increased in HT-29 cells treated with butyrate, and it was not degraded upon TNF-α treatment (Fig.4 A). The resistance of p100 to TNF-α-induced degradation has been reported in other cell types as well (42Dejardin E. Deregowski V. Chapelier M. Jacobs N. Gielen J. Merville M.P. Bours V. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2567-2577Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). IκB-α was also influenced by butyrate treatment. In control cells, IκB-α was completely degraded in response to TNF-α (at 15 min), whereas its degradation was dampened in butyrate-treated cells (Fig. 4 A). In addition, butyrate treatment of HT-29 cells caused a number of larger proteins to appear on the IκB-α immunoblot (marked with an asterisk in Fig. 4 A). One possibility is that some of these larger bands are ubiquitinated forms of IκB-α, which could appear as a result of decreased proteasome activity. An overlapping set of bands also appeared in cells treated with the MG-132 proteasome inhibitor (although intensities of the individual bands differ). Additional evidence for the accumulation of ubiquitinated IκB-α after butyrate treatment was obtained by performing an immunoprecipitation experiment (Fig. 4 B). An anti-ubiquitin antibody precipitated more IκB-α from butyrate-treated cells than from control cells (relative to the amount of unconjugated IκB-α in the extract, Fig. 4 B). The finding that an antibody against IκB-β could not precipitate IκB-α-reactive proteins under the same immunoprecipitation conditions supports the specificity of the anti-ubiquitin immunoprecipitation. These results suggested that butyrate may be interfering with proteasomal degradation of IκB-α. To determine whether butyrate was affecting proteasome activity in the cell, cytosolic extracts prepared from control and butyrate-treated HT-29 cells were tested for proteasome activity using the synthetic substrate Suc-LLVY-AMC (40Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2206) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.5 A, butyrate treatment decreased proteasome activity in the extract by ∼40%. Since a decrease in proteasome activity may generally increase the presence of polyubiquitinated proteins in the cell, a blot of cytosolic proteins from control and butyrate-treated cells was probed with an anti-ubiquitin antibody (Fig. 5 B). Exposure of the HT-29 cells to butyrate resulted in the accumulation of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins. These data indicate butyrate suppresses proteasome activity in HT-29 cells. Since NF-κB activation in the absence of IκB degradation has been reported (41Jobin C. Haskill S. Mayer L. Panja A. Sartor R.B. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 226-234PubMed Google Scholar, 43Wilson L. Szabo C. Salzman A.L. Gastroenterology. 1999; 117: 106-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), we determined whether proteasome activity was required for NF-κB activation by TNF-α in HT-29 cells. As shown in Fig. 5 C, the MG-132 proteasome inhibitor was able to suppress both TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation (Fig. 5 C) and IκB-α degradation (Fig. 4 A). The ability of butyrate to suppress proteasome activity could therefore contribute to the inhibition of NF-κB activation by TNF-α. Butyrate influences a number of cellular activities, including ion transport, glutathione synthesis, reactive oxygen generation, and protein acetylation (16Boffa L.C. Vidali G. Mann R.S. Allfrey V.G.

We have reported previously that the influence of butyrate on NF-κB activation arises from its ability to inhibit histone deacetylases (25Inan M.S. Rasoulpour R.J. Yin L. Hubbard A.K. Rosenberg D.W. Giardina C. Gastroenterology. 2000; 118: 724-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). We therefore determined whether the effects of butyrate on p100 expression, IκB-α degradation, and proteasome activity were also obtained with the deacetylase inhibitor TSA. As shown in Fig. 6, TSA was able to inhibit proteasome activity (Fig. 6 A), suppress TNF-α-induced IκB-α degradation (Fig. 6 B), and increase p100 expression (Fig. 6 B). These data are consistent with a model in which the influence of butyrate on NF-κB activation and proteasome activity derives from its ability to inhibit histone deacetylases. It should be noted, however, that butyrate and TSA might be accomplishing these outcomes through different molecular mechanisms.

https://openalex.org/W1988472050,"We have cloned and characterized a novel human serine/threonine protein kinase gene from chromosome 12p13.3 encoding 2382 amino acids. Remarkably, the catalytic domain sequence contains a cysteine in place of a lysine residue conserved in subdomain II of most kinases. The same amino acid alteration was recently described for rat WNK1 (with no K=lysine) in which another nearby lysine residue was shown to confer kinase activity to the protein. Rat WNK1 is 85% identical to a splice variant lacking exons 11 and 12 of the described human kinase which we have called human WNK1. The WNK1 catalytic domain has closest homology with human PAK2, MEKK3, and Raf-1. Three additional, partial human protein kinase sequences, WNK2, WNK3 and WNK4, are also reported here with catalytic domains that are 95% homologous to WNK1. These genes differ both in chromosomal location and tissue-specific expression. Moreover, we have identified in the database a total of 18 WNK-related genes, all exclusively from multi-cellular organisms, which share a WNK kinase sequence signature within subdomains I and II of the catalytic domain. We suggest that they constitute a novel subfamily of protein kinases that evolved together with cell adhesion and tissue-formation."
https://openalex.org/W1569377852,"Four integrins, namely α1β1, α2β1, α10β1, and α11β1, form a special subclass of cell adhesion receptors. They are all collagen receptors, and they recognize their ligands with an inserted domain (I domain) in their α subunit. We have produced the human integrin α10I domain as a recombinant protein to reveal its ligand binding specificity. In general, α10I did recognize collagen types I–VI and laminin-1 in a Mg2+-dependent manner, whereas its binding to tenascin was only slightly better than to albumin. When α10I was tested together with the α1I and α2I domains, all three I domains seemed to have their own collagen binding preferences. The integrin α2I domain bound much better to fibrillar collagens (I–III) than to basement membrane type IV collagen or to beaded filament-forming type VI collagen. Integrin α1I had the opposite binding pattern. The integrin α10I domain was similar to the α1I domain in that it bound very well to collagen types IV and VI. Based on the previously published atomic structures of the α1I and α2I domains, we modeled the structure of the α10I domain. The comparison of the three I domains revealed similarities and differences that could potentially explain their functional differences. Mutations were introduced into the αI domains, and their binding to types I, IV, and VI collagen was tested. In the α2I domain, Asp-219 is one of the amino acids previously suggested to interact directly with type I collagen. The corresponding amino acid in both the α1I and α10I domains is oppositely charged (Arg-218). The mutation D219R in the α2I domain changed the ligand binding pattern to resemble that of the α1I and α10I domains and, vice versa, the R218D mutation in the α1I and α10I domains created an α2I domain-like ligand binding pattern. Thus, all three collagen receptors appear to differ in their ability to recognize distinct collagen subtypes. The relatively small structural differences on their collagen binding surfaces may explain the functional specifics.

The relatively small structural differences on their collagen binding surfaces may explain the functional specifics. metal ion-dependent adhesion site polymerase chain reaction maltose-binding protein glutathioneS-transferase phosphate-buffered saline bovine serum albumin Collagens are abundant structural proteins in the extracellular matrix. So far, 19 different triple helical protein trimers have been classified as a collagen subtype (1Prockop D.J. Kivirikko K.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 403-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1388) Google Scholar). The collagens can be grouped into subclasses according to their structural details. Many collagen subtypes (namely types I, II, III, V, and XI) have long continuous triple helices, and they can form large fibrils. In other collagens the triple helix has interruptions. Some collagens form networks (types IV, VIII, and X) or beaded filaments (type VI). Other collagen subclasses include fibril-associated collagen with short interruptions in the triple helices (collagen types IX, XII, XIV, XVI, and XIX), anchoring fibril-forming collagen (type VII), and transmembrane collagen (types XIII and XVII). Collagen types XV and XVIII are found in association with basement membranes (the multiplexins; see Ref. 2Oh S.P. Warman M.L. Seldin M.F. Cheng S.D. Knoll J.H. Timmons S. Olsen B.R. Genomics. 1994; 19: 494-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The integrins form a large family of heterodimeric cell surface receptors involved in cell-extracellular matrix as well as in cell-cell adhesion and communication. Of the 24 different integrin receptors presently known, 5 function as a collagen receptor (3Heino J. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 319-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The collagen receptors are composed of the β1 subunit in complex with either an α1, α2, α3, α10, or an α11 subunit. Integrin α1β1 is the collagen receptor of many mesenchymal cells. α1 null mice are viable (4Gardner H.A. Kreidberg J. Koteliansky V. Jaenisch R. Dev. Biol. 1996; 175: 301-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), but they seem to have defects in the feedback regulation of collagen synthesis (5Gardner H.A. Broberg A. Pozzi A. Laato M. Heino J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 263-272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in the regulation of matrix metalloproteinase expression (5Gardner H.A. Broberg A. Pozzi A. Laato M. Heino J. J.

Immunol. 2000; 201: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Integrin α2β1 is an important collagen receptor on platelets and epithelial cells (8Zutter M.M. Santoro S.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1990; 137: 113-120PubMed Google Scholar). Little is known about the biology of the recently identified α10β1 and α11β1integrins. α10β1 is one of the collagen receptors on chondrocytes (9Camper L. Hellman U. Lundgren-Åkerlund E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20383-20389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), and α11β1was originally found in fetal muscle (10Velling T. Kusche-Gullberg M. Sejersen T. Gullberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25735-25742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Integrin α3β1 can bind some collagens, but it may function as an assisting collagen receptor rather than as a primary receptor (11DiPersio C.M. Shah S. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2321-2336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One notable feature common to the primary collagen receptors is the existence of an I (“inserted”) domain at the N terminus of the α subunit. No other extracellular matrix receptor contains this independently folding domain, but five integrin-type cell-cell adhesion receptors do have it. The I domain is built up of β sheets surrounded by amphipathic α helices (12Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). I domains are homologous to the A domains found in von Willebrand factor and in cartilage matrix protein, in some collagen subtypes, and in components of the complement system. The A and I domains are commonly involved in molecular interactions, and they are responsible for the collagen binding activity of von Willebrand factor and collagen receptor integrins (13Cruz M.A. Yuan H. Lee J.R. Wise R.J. Handin R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10822-10827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 14Kamata T. Takada Y. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 22811-22816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At the “top” of the I domain, where ligands bind, resides a metal ion in a conserved coordination site called MIDAS1 (metal ion-dependent adhesion site; see Ref. 16Mischishita M. Videm V. Arnaout M.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 857-867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Five amino acid side chains bind the magnesium ion, directly or through water molecules, and a water molecule or glutamate from a collagenous ligand may complete the coordination to the metal ion. The MIDAS site is centered on a groove restricted on one side by a helix called the αC helix. This αC helix can be found only in collagen binding integrin αI domains. Ligand binding induces a conformational change in the α2I domain resulting in the unwinding of the αC helix and opening of the binding site (17Emsley J. Knight C.G. Farndale R.W. Barnes M.J. Liddington R.C. Cell. 2000; 100: 47-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (845) Google Scholar). Recombinant α2I domain missing the αC helix has been shown to have altered kinetics in binding type I collagen (18Käpylä J. Ivaska J. Riikonen R. Nykvist P. Pentikäinen O. Johnson M. Heino J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3348-3354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A prominent feature in the αI domain binding surface is the presence of several charged amino acids surrounding the MIDAS site. The binding surface of α2I is more negatively charged than the binding surfaces of α1I and α10I (19Pentikäinen O. Hoffren A.-M. Ivaska J. Käpylä J. Nyrönen T. Heino J. Johnson M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31493-31505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Despite the structural similarity of the integrins α1β1 and α2β1, their binding specificity differs from each other. Integrin α1β1 prefers network-forming collagen type IV over fibrillar collagen type I, whereas α2β1 binds type I collagen more strongly than collagen type IV (20Kern A. Eble J. Golbik R. Kuhn K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Moreover, α1β1is a much better receptor for type XIII collagen than α2β1 (21Nykvist P. Tu H. Ivaska J. Käpylä J. Pihlajaniemi T. Heino J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8255-8261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The same binding pattern can also be seen with the corresponding recombinant I domains. Here we have tested the binding of α1I and α2I domains to various collagen subtypes. We have also unveiled the ligands recognized by the α10I domain. The similarities and differences in the ligand binding patterns were correlated with the atomic structures, and based on experiments with mutated αI domains, we suggest that Asp-219 in the α2I domain, and the corresponding amino acid Arg-218 in the α1I and α10I domains, is a critical residue in the determination of collagen binding specificity. α10I domain cDNA was generated by reverse transcription-PCR from RNA isolated from KHOS-240 cells (human Caucasian osteosarcoma). Total cellular RNA was isolated by using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). Reverse transcription-PCR was done using the Gene Amp PCR kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The α10I forward primer (5′-CAG GGA TCC CCA ACA TAC ATG GAT GTT GTC-3′) contained a Bam HI restriction site at the 5′-end. The reverse primer (5′-GGC TGA ATT CCC CTT CAA GGC CAA AAA TCC G-3′) also contained an Eco RI restriction site at the 5′-end. The primers were delivered by CyberGene, Sweden. Forty cycles of PCR amplification were done in 2 mm MgCl2 using the following protocol: denaturation for 1 min at 94 °C, annealing for 1 min at 67 °C, and extension for 2 min at 72 °C. The amplified α10I domain cDNA was digested along with the pMAL-c expression vector (New England Biolabs) or pGEX-2T expression vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using the Bam HI and Eco RI restriction enzymes (Promega). The cDNA was ligated to the pMAL-c vector with T4 DNA ligase (Promega). To the pGEX-2T vector the α10I domain cDNA was ligated with the SureClone ligation kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The constructs were transformed into the Escherichia coli BL21 strain for production. The DNA sequences of the constructs were checked with DNA sequencing and compared with the published α10 DNA sequence (10Velling T. Kusche-Gullberg M. Sejersen T. Gullberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25735-25742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Site-directed mutation of the α10I domain cDNA in a pGEX-2T vector was made using PCR according to Stratagene’s QuikChange mutagenesis kit instructions. Briefly, mutagenesis was based on primers that contained the planned mutations (primers were delivered by CyberGene). At 68 °C the proofreading Pfu DNA polymerase (Promega) makes only one copy of the plasmid without replacing the primers. The mutated strands were then selected from parental ones by digesting the template withDpn I endonuclease (Promega), which digests only methylated and hemimethylated DNA. By that means only mutated strands remained. The presence of mutations was checked by DNA sequencing. Mutant constructs were then transformed into E. coli strain BL21 for production of recombinant protein. The α1I domain was cloned into the pGEX-4T vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described earlier by Nykvistet al. (21Nykvist P. Tu H. Ivaska J. Käpylä J. Pihlajaniemi T. Heino J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8255-8261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The full-length integrin α1cDNA was a gift from Dr. E. Marcantonio (Columbia University, New York). The α1I domain cDNA sequence differed from the originally published sequence (23Briesewitz R. Epstein M.R. Marcantonio E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2989-2996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at one position, and as a result the amino acid lysine was replaced with glutamate at position 170 (numbered from the beginning of the mature peptide). Site-directed mutations to α1I domain cDNA were made as stated above for the α10I domain. Human integrin α2I domain was generated as described earlier by Ivaska et al. (24Ivaska J. Käpylä J. Pentikäinen O. Hoffren A.-M. Hermonen J. Huttunen P. Johnson M.S. Heino J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3513-3521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The integrin α2 cDNA was a gift from Dr. M. Hemler, Dana Farber, Boston. The α2I domain was cloned into the pGEX-2T vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The site-directed mutations were made as stated above for the α10I domain. To produce the wild type α10I domain as a fusion with the maltose-binding protein (MBP), 500 ml of LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin was inoculated with an overnight culture of 10 ml ofE. coli BL21 cells transformed with the pMAL-cα10I vector. Cells were grown at 37 °C for about 4 h. Protein production was induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and allowed to continue for 2 h. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation (4,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C). Cell pellets were resuspended in column buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and stored at −20 °C until purification. The cell suspension was thawed on ice and sonicated in 15-s bursts for 3 min. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (9,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C). The supernatant was incubated with amylose resin (New England BioLabs) in an end-over-end rotor at 4 °C overnight. Amylose resin with bound MBP-α10I fusion was transferred to 10-ml columns (Bio-Rad) and washed three times with 10 ml of column buffer. The bound fusion protein was eluted with 5 mm maltose in column buffer after a 2–3-h incubation at room temperature. Maltose was removed using hydroxyapatite, first washed with column buffer. One ml of washed hydroxyapatite was mixed with eluted protein and incubated in an end-over-end rotor for 1 h at 4 °C, after which the fusion protein was attached to the hydroxyapatite. Soluble maltose was washed away with column buffer, repeated three times. The fusion protein was eluted from the hydroxyapatite with sodium phosphate buffer after a 30-min incubation at 4 °C. The protein concentrations were measured using Bradford’s method (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar). The purity and folding of the proteins were checked by SDS- and native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PhastSystem, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; data not shown). The wild type and mutated α1I, α2I, and α10I domains were produced as glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-αI domain fusion proteins. 500 ml of LB medium (with 50 μg/ml ampicillin) was inoculated with an overnight culture of E. coli BL21 cells transformed with either wild type or mutant plasmid. The cultures were grown at 37 °C until theA 600 was in the range of 0.5–1. Next, an inducer of the tac promoter, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside, was added to a final concentration of 0.4 mm, and the temperature was lowered to room temperature. The bacteria were allowed to produce the recombinant protein for 3–4 h after which the cultures were centrifuged (5,550 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C) to collect the cells. Cells were stored until purification at −20 °C overnight and at −70 °C for longer times. The bacterial cells were resuspended in PBS for purification. The cell suspension was sonicated and detergent (Triton X-100) was added to a final concentration of 1%. To dissolve the recombinant protein, the disrupted cells were incubated with agitation and Triton X-100 for 1 h. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (17,000 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C). Glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added to the supernatant, and the mixture was incubated for 1–1.5 h in gentle agitation. The glutathione-Sepharose 4B was then transferred to columns (Bio-Rad), and unbound proteins were washed away with PBS. The bound fusion protein was eluted with reduced glutathione (Sigma). Protein concentrations were measured with Bradford’s method (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar). The purity and folding of the fusion proteins were checked with SDS- and native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown). The binding of wild type or mutated I domains to collagen was studied using solid phase binding assays. Ninety-six-well microtiter plates (Wallac) were coated with each collagen type: I (rat tail, Sigma), II (bovine, Chemicon), III (human, Chemicon), IV (Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm mouse sarcoma basement membrane, Sigma), V (human, Chemicon), or VI (human, Biodesign International) or with laminin-1 (Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm mouse sarcoma basement membrane, Sigma), tenascin (chicken, Chemicon) 5 μg/cm2 in PBS and control wells with Diluent II (containing BSA, Wallac) 1:2 in PBS at 4 °C overnight. Before carrying out the binding assays, wells were blocked with Diluent II for 1 h at 37 °C. Dilutions of the I domains were made with assay buffer (Wallac) and added to the wells. A concentration series of 1–500 nm was used for the I domains. The I domains were allowed to attach to the wells for 1 h at 37 °C in the presence of 2 mm MgCl2, unless stated otherwise. The unattached I domain was washed away with PBS containing 2 mm MgCl2, repeated three times. Detection of the I domain was based on the existence of the GST or MBP fusion partner. Goat anti-GST antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or anti-MBP (New England Biolabs) was added to the wells in a 1:8,000 or 1:1,000 dilution, respectively, in assay buffer and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The wells were then washed three times with PBS containing 2 mm MgCl2. Europium3+-labeled protein G (Wallac) (1:100 in assay buffer) was then added to the wells and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Wells were washed three times with PBS containing MgCl2. Enhancement solution (Wallac) was used to dissociate the highly fluorescent Europium3+ label. The fluorescence was measured with a time-resolved fluorometer (Victor2, Wallac). All assays were performed at least in triplicate.

The sequence alignment of human α1I, α2I, and α10I domains was made using MALIGN (28Johnson M.S. Overington J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 716-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) in the BODIL modeling package 2J. Lehtonen, V.-V. Rantanen, D.-J. Still, M. Gyllenberg, and M. S. Johnson, unpublished results. using a structure-based sequence comparison matrix (29Johnson M.S. May A.C.W. Rodionov M.A. Overington J.P. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 575-598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MALIGN constructs a multiple sequence alignment from pairwise alignments according to a tree relating the sequences being matched. The alignment between the three I domains contains no gaps and for α1I and α2I matches their structural alignment. The sequence identity between the α2I domain and the α1I domain is 52% and between the α2I domain and the α10I domain is 46%, thus leading to high quality reliable models. The program MODELLER 4.0 (30Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10636) Google Scholar) was used to construct three-dimensional model structures of the holo form of the α1I domain and both the apo and holo forms of the α10I domain. α10I domain was produced in E. coli as a recombinant protein fused to MBP or GST. The recombinant proteins were purified with affinity chromatography and characterized with SDS- and native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown). The proteins appeared as one band in native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, suggesting the presence of a single molecular form. The binding of purified recombinant α10I domain to collagen was studied using a solid phase binding assay. Wells were coated with different collagens, laminin-1, or tenascin (5 μg/cm2). α10I fusion protein (300 nm) was allowed to bind to the coated wells. The α10I domain was found to bind to cartilage-derived type II collagen in a magnesium-dependent manner (Fig.1 A) because 5 mmEDTA inhibited binding completely. Thus, the basic binding mechanism of α10I is cation-dependent as are the other integrin αI domains (16Mischishita M. Videm V. Arnaout M.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 857-867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 17Emsley J. Knight C.G. Farndale R.W. Barnes M.J. Liddington R.C. Cell. 2000; 100: 47-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (845) Google Scholar). To investigate whether other fibrillar collagens, namely subtypes I, II, III, and V, also can function as ligands for α10I, a binding assay was carried out (Fig.1 B). The α10I domain bound to the collagen subtypes I–III nearly equally, but in repeated experiments the binding to type V collagen was weaker. Collagen receptors α1β1 and α2β1can both bind to laminin-1 (31Tomaselli K.J. Hall D.E. Flier L.A. Gehlsen K.R. Turner D.C. Carbonetto S. Reichardt L.F. Neuron. 1990; 5: 651-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 32Languino L.R. Gehlsen K.R. Wayner E. Carter W.G. Engvall E. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2455-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). α2β1is also able to bind tenascin (33Sriramarao P. Mendler M. Bourdon M.A. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 1001-1012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of α10I to these extracellular matrix proteins was also studied. The α10I domain was found to bind to laminin-1, but binding to tenascin was only slightly better than to BSA (Fig.1 C). The ligand recognition patterns of α10I-GST and α10I-MBP were identical. In some experiments the α10I-MBP showed higher unspecific binding to BSA than α10I-GST (data not shown). Integrins α1β1 and α2β1and their corresponding αI domains differ in collagen binding specificity even though they are structurally highly similar. Overall about half of their αI domain sequence is identical, and the αI domain binding surfaces resemble each other. The α1I domain prefers type IV collagen over type I collagen, whereas the preference of α2I is reversed (20Kern A. Eble J. Golbik R. Kuhn K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). To study the binding of these αI domains to collagen type VI in addition to collagen types I and IV, binding assays with an αI domain concentration series of 1–500 nm were carried out (Fig.2). The results were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation to obtain estimates of theKd of binding. In accordance with previous studies, the integrin α1I domain bound better to type IV collagen (Kd ≈ 65 ± 20 nm;panel A) than type I collagen (Kd ≈ 160 ± 40 nm). The integrin α2I domain, in contrast, associated considerably better with collagen type I (Kd ≈ 20 ± 5 nm) than with collagen type IV (Kd ≈ 140 ± 30 nm; panel B). Type VI collagen forms beaded filaments, and it has been reported to be a ligand of both α1β1 and α2β1 integrins (34Loeser R.F. Arthritis Rheum. 1997; 40: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). However, in chondrocytes α1β1 may be the preferred receptor for collagen type VI (35Loeser R.F. Sadiev S. Tan L. Goldring M.B. Osteoarthr. Cartil. 2000; 8: 96-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Here, the binding of the α1I and α2I domains to type VI collagen was tested (Fig. 2). Integrin α1I domain showed the strongest binding (Kd ≈ 200 ± 80 nm; Fig. 2 C), whereas the binding of the α2I domain was so weak that no reasonable estimate of the half-maximal value for binding could be obtained (Fig. 2 D). To test whether the α10I domain can also bind collagens other than the fibrillar subtypes and to get quantitative information, a binding assay with collagen types I, IV, and VI was carried out. In the solid phase assay the range of α10I domain concentrations spanned 1–500 nm. The α10I domain was found to bind type IV collagen slightly better (Kd ≈ 300 ± 100 nm) than collagen types I and VI (Fig.3). The estimatedKd for binding to fibrillar collagen type I was 350 ± 150 nm, similar to the value for collagen type VI binding (Kd ≈ 350 ± 200 nm). In terms of binding properties, these results place the α10I domain closer to the α1I domain, which prefers collagen type IV over collagen type I or VI. Moreover, the fact that the α10I domain binds well to collagen type VI, in contrast to the α2I domain, suggests that the binding preferences of the α1I and α10I domains are similar. Sequence differences in the vicinity of the binding site were identified by using the sequence alignment of the α1I, α2I, and α10I domains, and the x-ray structures of the apo form of the α1I domain (25Salminen T.A.

To make it easier to visualize the differences among the surface regions surrounding the MIDAS site, both the α1I (holo form) and α10I (apo and holo forms) domain structures were modeled using MODELLER 4.0. The electrostatic potentials were mapped to the solvent accessible surfaces of the apo and holo forms (Fig. 4) for each of the αI domains, and the sequence differences are listed in Table I.Table ISequence differences in the vicinity of the MIDAS site in the α1I, α2I, and α10I domainsAmino acid numberingThree-letter code for an amino acidα1,10α2α1α2α10218219ArgAspArg219220QlnLeuGlu259260AsnGlyGly260261HisSerGlu285286TyrLeuTyr288289GlyAsnArg290291LeuLeuArg291292SerAspAsp294295LysAsnSer297298GluLysArg301302SerAlaThrAmino acids that are conservatively replaced among the integrins or are less likely to be involved in ligand bindingα1,10α2α1α2α10284285SerTyrHis286287AsnAsnLeu289290AsnAlaQln292293ThrThrPro293294"

Using the highly invasive melanoma cell line BLM, we demonstrate that the chemokine Mig, a ligand for CXCR3, activates the small GTPases RhoA and Rac1, induces a reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, and triggers cell chemotaxis and modulation of integrin VLA-5- and VLA-4-dependent cell adhesion to fibronectin. Furthermore, the chemokine SDF-1α, the ligand of CXCR4, triggered modulation of β1 integrin-dependent melanoma cell adhesion to fibronectin.

The chemokines have been classified into four families, CXC, CC, C, and CX3C, which differ in the position of four conserved cysteines. The two major families are the CXC and CC chemokines, which interact with seven-transmembrane G-protein-linked CXCR and CCR receptors, respectively (1Premack B.A. Schall T.J. Nat.

Important roles for chemokines have been demonstrated in inflammatory diseases, hematopoiesis, angiogenesis, tumor rejection, and human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 infection (4Rossi D. Zlotnik A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 217-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (2101) Google Scholar, 5Sallusto F. Mackay C.R. Lanzavecchia A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 593-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). Binding of chemokines to their receptors triggers the activation of several molecules and signaling pathways, including the activation of the Janus tyrosine kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription pathway, activation of small GTPases of the Rho family, and activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and MAP1 kinase pathways (3Mellado M.

Cells respond to chemokines by altering their morphology during migration in which cell polarization with redistribution of several membrane receptors and rearrangement of actin cytoskeleton takes place (7Sánchez-Madrid F. del Pozo M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Cell migration also involves sequential adhesion and detachment steps, and transient up-regulation of the activity of cell adhesion receptors mediated by chemokines is likely to play an important role during migration. Hence, several chemokines including the CXC chemokine SDF-1α (CXCL12) and the CC chemokines monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (CCL2) and RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted) (CCL5) modulate the adhesive activity of integrins VLA-4 and VLA-5 in lymphocytes and in bone marrow hematopoietic progenitor and myeloma cells (8del Pozo M.A. Sánchez-Mateos P.

Blood. 2000; 97: 346-351Crossref Scopus (230) Google Scholar). In addition to tumor cells, the tumor microenvironment includes inflammatory cells such as macrophages and T lymphocytes, which are attracted by cytokines and chemokines secreted by tumor cells (13Balkwill F. Mantovani A. Lancet. 2001; 357: 539-545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6050) Google Scholar). Moreover, activation of macrophages and T lymphocytes results in secretion of additional chemokines. IL-8 (CXCL8), MGSA/GROα (melanoma growth-stimulatory activity/growth-regulated oncogene α) (CXCL1), Mig (CXCL9), and IP-10 (CXCL10) are found in the tumor microenvironment in melanoma (14Schadendorf D. Möller A. Algermissen B. Worm M. Sticherling M. Czarnetzki B.M. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 2667-2675PubMed Google Scholar, 15Singh R.K. Gutman M. Radinsky R. Bucana C.D. Fidler I.J.

Pathol. 1999; 189: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and therefore they potentially could bind to their receptors on cells present in the tumor. Most of the work on chemokines in melanoma has centered on IL-8, which is produced by melanoma cells and contributes to their growth (14Schadendorf D. Möller A. Algermissen B. Worm M. Sticherling M. Czarnetzki B.M. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 2667-2675PubMed Google Scholar, 15Singh R.K. Gutman M. Radinsky R. Bucana C.D. Fidler I.J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3242-3247PubMed Google Scholar,17Luca M. Huang S. Gershenwald J.E. Singh R.K. Reich R. Bar-Eli M. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 151: 1105-1113PubMed Google Scholar). Mig (monokine induced by interferon-γ) is produced mainly by activated macrophages and binds to CXCR3, which is functionally expressed on activated T and B cells and on endothelial cells (18Liao F. Rabin R.L. Yannelli J.R. Koniaris L.G. Vanguri P. Farber J.M. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1301-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 19Loetscher M. Gerber B. Loetscher P. Jones S.A. Piali L.

On the other hand, SDF-1α is expressed on most tissues and exerts its chemoattractive and activating functions upon interaction with its receptor CXCR4 (22Nagasawa T. Tachibana K. Kawabata K. Adv. Immunol. 1999; 71: 211-228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During invasion and dissemination, tumor cells migrate through tissues involving dynamic regulation of cell adhesion associated with morphological alterations that must include changes in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. Chemokines are potential candidates to induce such cellular responses upon binding to their receptors. In the present work we found that human melanoma cells express the chemokine receptors CXCR3 and CXCR4, which mediate agonist-dependent cell migration and activation, raising the possibility that these receptors could play a relevant role during tumor cell invasion and growth. The human melanoma cell line BLM was cultured in DMEM medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (BioWhittaker, Verviers, Belgium) and antibiotics. The melanoma cell lines MeWo, SK-Mel 37, and A375 were grown with RPMI 1640 medium (BioWhittaker) and 10% FBS. Melanoma metastatic lymph nodes were obtained after informed consent from patients undergoing surgery at the Department of Immuno-Oncology and Surgery, Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Marañón, Madrid. Histopathological diagnosis was confirmed for each specimen. A homogeneous cell suspension was obtained by mechanic disruption of tumoral tissue fragments in RPMI 1640 medium. Monoclonal antibodies to CXCR3, CXCR4, CXCR1, and CXCR2 were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). The integrin anti-α4HP 1/2 and anti-β1 Lia 1/2.1, anti-VE-cadherin TEA 1/31, and control antibody P3X63 mAb were gifts of Dr. Francisco Sánchez-Madrid (Hospital de la Princesa, Madrid), and anti-α5 P1D6 mAb was from Life Technologies, Inc. Antibody against S-100 was obtained from Novocastra Laboratories (Newcastle upon Tyne, UK), and normal rabbit serum (Zymed Laboratories Inc. San Francisco, CA) was used as its negative control. Anti-fibroblast AS02-clon was purchased from Dianova (Hamburg, Germany), and anti-gp100 HMB-45 mAb was from Signet Laboratories Inc. (Dedham, MA). Melanoma cells at subconfluency (50–70%) were detached with 2 mm EDTA in PBS, washed, resuspended in ice-cold PBS, and incubated on ice for 30 min with primary antibodies. After washing, cells were incubated with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibodies (DAKO A/S, Copenhagen, Denmark) and analyzed on a Coulter Epics XL flow cytometer. The levels of chemokine receptor expression were quantified as we reported previously (23Mellado M. Rodrı́guez-Frade J.M. Vila-Coro A.J. Fernández S. Martin de Ana A. Jones D.R. Torán J.L. Martı́nez-A C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2497-2507Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) based on a modification of the Dako Qifikit (DAKO A/S) (24Poncelet P.G. Lavabre-Bertrand T. Masseyeff R.F. Albert W.H. Staines N.A. Methods of Immunological Analysis. VCH, Weinheim, Germany1993: 388-418Google Scholar). For melanoma cells from metastatic lymph nodes we used phycoerythrin-labeled goat anti-mouse as secondary antibodies (BD Biosciences, Erembodegem, Belgium). Subsequently cells were incubated with mouse serum followed by incubation with anti-CD45-FITC (BD Biosciences) and 7-amino-actinomycin D (Via-ProbeTM, Pharmingen). For S-100 intracellular staining, cells were fixed and permeabilized with the Cytofix/CytopermTM kit (Pharmingen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Analysis was performed with a FACScan cytofluorometer (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems, Mountain View, CA), and results were obtained using CellQuest software. Phenotypic analysis was performed excluding CD45+ and nonviable cells. Normal lymph nodes contained less than 1% S-100-positive cells that corresponded to interdigitating reticulum cells expressing CD45, and therefore they were excluded in the analysis of melanoma tumor cells. To detect F-actin, cells were sequentially grown in DMEM, 2% FBS and DMEM, 0.5% FBS on coverslips in 24-well plates. After 24 h the medium was removed, and samples were treated at 37 °C with or without chemokines in DMEM, 0.4% BSA. After washing, cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS, rinsed, and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS. Samples were blocked with 1% BSA in PBS, and cells were labeled with FITC-phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 30 min at 37 °C. Coverslips were washed and mounted on slide glasses with Mowiol, and observations were performed with a fluorescence microscope connected to a laser scanning cytometer (CompuCyte Corp., Cambridge, MA). For the detection of chemokine receptors, melanoma cells grown on coverslips in complete medium were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in Tris-buffered saline, and blocked with 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoate solution. Cells were incubated for 30 min with primary antibodies, and after washing, they were incubated for 10 min with FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies in 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoate solution. Chemokine receptors were visualized on a Zeiss microscope with epifluorescence, and images were acquired with a CCD camera Photometrics CH 250/A. For immunohistochemistry, acetone-fixed 4-μm-thick sections of cryopreserved human melanoma tissues were incubated for 1 h with different mAbs (1 μg/ml) followed by staining with a standard indirect avidin-biotin alkaline phosphatase method. Color was developed with fuchsin substrate-chromogen (Dako), and sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. We followed essentially the method previously reported (25Jiménez C. Armas Portela R. Mellado M. Rodrı́guez-Frade J.M. Collard J. Serrano A. Martı́nez-A C. Avila J. Carrera A.C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 249-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Subconfluent cultures of melanoma cells were incubated for 16 h in growth medium with or without 100 ng/ml of pertussis toxin (Calbiochem). Cells were detached with trypsin/EDTA followed by washing with DMEM, 10% FBS and resuspension in migration medium. Cells (200 μl/well, 7.5 × 105/ml) were placed in the upper wells and allowed to migrate across filters coated with fibronectin or collagen type IV (Sigma) (20 μg/ml) to lower wells containing migration medium alone or with chemokines (R&D Systems). The chamber was incubated for 5 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2, and filters were processed and analyzed as described previously (25Jiménez C. Armas Portela R. Mellado M. Rodrı́guez-Frade J.M. Collard J. Serrano A. Martı́nez-A C. Avila J. Carrera A.C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 249-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The migration index was calculated by mean spot intensity. The GST-PAK-CD and GST-C21 fusion proteins were generated as previously described (26Sander E.E. van Delft S. ten Klooster J.P. Reid T. van der Kamen R.A. Michiels F. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1385-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Melanoma cells were starved in DMEM without serum for 1.5–2 h, and after detachment with EDTA/PBS, they were washed and resuspended at 2.5 × 106 cells/ml in DMEM, 0.4% BSA. Chemokines were added, and the incubation was carried out at 37 °C for different times followed by rapid washing with ice-cold PBS. Cells were lysed at 4 °C in 200 μl of a buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm benzamidine, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin, aprotinin, soybean trypsin inhibitor, and antipain (Sigma). Lysates were centrifuged, 15 μl were kept for total lysate samples, and the remaining 185 μl were mixed with fusion proteins in the presence of glutathione-agarose beads. The mixtures were incubated for 16 h at 4 °C followed by pelleting the beads, which were washed, and bound proteins were eluted in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer. Proteins were resolved on 12% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Hybond-P, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), which were incubated with antibodies to Rac1 (Pharmingen/Transduction Laboratories, San Diego, CA) or to RhoA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Amounts of active Rac or Rho, which bound to PAK and C21, respectively, were normalized relative to the total amounts of Rac or Rho present in the cell extracts by scanning densitometry. Plasma fibronectin (10 μg/ml) or the FN-H89 fragment of fibronectin (5 μg/ml) (27Mould A.P. Askari J.A. Craig S.E. Garrat A.N. Clements J. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27224-27230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was coated on 96-well plates as described previously (28Robledo M.M. Sanz-Rodrı́guez F. Hidalgo A. Teixidó J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12056-12060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Melanoma cells at subconfluency were labeled with BCECF-AM (Molecular Probes), detached with EDTA/PBS, and resuspended in ice-cold DMEM, 0.4% BSA containing different concentrations of chemokines. 2 × 104 cells in 100 μl were added in triplicates to plates, which were kept for 15 min on ice to place cells in contact with ligands. Subsequently plates were transferred to a 37 °C incubator, and after 3.5 min, nonadhered cells were removed by three washes with DMEM. Bound cells were lysed with 1% SDS in PBS, and the extent of adhesion was quantified using a fluorescence analyzer (POLARstar Galaxy, BMG Labtechnologies, Offenburg, Germany). For adhesion assays involving immobilized Mig, this chemokine was co-immobilized with fibronectin for 2 h at 37 °C onto 96-well plates. 2 × 104BCECF-AM-labeled cells were added in triplicate to plates, which were incubated for 6 min at 37 °C. Nonadherent cells were removed, and bound cells were quantified as described above. For p44/42 and p38 MAP kinase analysis, melanoma cells in subconfluent monolayers were first starved in DMEM without serum, detached, and resuspended in DMEM, 0.4% BSA. After incubation with chemokines at 37 °C, cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 μm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a protease inhibitor mixture. Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrophoretically transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes that were incubated with anti-phospho MAP kinase antibodies (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). After washing, membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-rabbit antibody (DAKO). Proteins were visualized using ECL detection (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After stripping and blocking, the same blots were reprobed with anti-MAP kinase antibodies (New England Biolabs) to test for total protein content. Analysis by flow cytometry of several melanoma cell lines indicated that CXCR3, a receptor for chemokines Mig, IP-10, and interferon-inducible T cell α-chemoattractant, was moderately expressed mainly on the highly invasive BLM cell line and to a lesser degree on SK-Mel 37 cells, whereas low or no expression was detected on MeWo and A375 cells (Fig. 1 A). The SDF-1α receptor, CXCR4, was mainly expressed on MeWo and A375 cells and at lower levels on BLM cells. Quantitative analysis of CXCR3 and CXCR4 expression using BLM and MeWo cells showed 47,179 ± 1,554 receptor sites/cell for CXCR3 and 111,354 ± 11,503 receptor sites/cell for CXCR4. Expression of CXCR1 and CXCR2, receptors for IL-8, was barely detected on these melanoma cell lines (not shown). Immunofluorescence microscopy analysis of permeabilized melanoma cells confirmed the expression of CXCR3 and CXCR4 on BLM and MeWo cells, respectively (Fig. 1 B). To study whether CXCR3 and CXCR4 were expressed by melanoma cells in tumoral tissues we performed flow cytometry and histochemical analysis using a combination of quite selective melanoma markers, S-100 and gp100/pmel 17 (29–31). For flow cytometry determinations, we obtained single cell suspensions from metastatic melanoma surgical specimens and immediately determined the expression of these chemokine receptors. Analysis showed that CXCR3 and CXCR4 were expressed on the surface of metastatic melanoma cells from macroscopically infiltrated lymph nodes (n = 5) (Fig.2 A). CXCR1 was expressed at low levels, whereas no expression of CXCR2 was detected. S-100 was expressed by 99% of the cells, whereas less than 1% reacted with antibodies to fibroblast and endothelial markers (not shown), and analysis was performed excluding CD45+ cells. Immunohistochemical analysis of seven cases with lymph node metastases and three cases with subcutaneous metastases revealed in all cases low to moderate expression of CXCR3 and CXCR4 on melanoma cells (Fig.2 B) with some heterogeneity in the level of expression of both molecules. In most instances, expression of CXCR4 was less intense than that of CXCR3. Tumor cells were identified by their expression of the melanocyte-specific antigen gp100 with the HMB-45 mAb. Altogether these data indicate that human melanoma cells express the chemokine receptors CXCR3 and CXCR4, raising the possibility that they could mediate agonist-dependent cell responses. Small GTPases of the Rho family, like RhoA and Rac1, are key regulators of the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, and changes in their activation state influence cell morphology and migration (32Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5220) Google Scholar, 33Kaibuchi K. Kuroda S. Amano M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 459-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). Upstream events leading to exchange of GDP for GTP binding to Rho GTPases activate these proteins, which can then interact with downstream targets to produce different biological responses. We used the BLM melanoma cell line to study whether Mig could influence the activation of RhoA and Rac1 by using “pull-down” assays with GST fusion proteins containing domains derived from Rho GTPase targets. Untreated BLM cells exhibited very low levels of active RhoA, but after a short (1-min) incubation with Mig there was a 15–20-fold increase in the amount of active RhoA as detected with the GST-C21 fusion protein (Fig.3). Although active Rac1 levels were high in untreated BLM cells, there was an increase (2-fold) in active Rac1 after a 1-min exposure to Mig as detected with the GST-PAK-CD fusion protein. Activation of RhoA and Rac1 by Mig on BLM cells was transient as longer times of incubation with the chemokine resulted in a decrease in the activation of these GTPases (Fig. 3). Investigation of the capability of Mig to alter the organization of the actin cytoskeleton on BLM melanoma cells was followed by FITC-phalloidin using a laser scanning cytofluorometer. Whereas no changes in total fluorescence values were obtained comparing samples incubated with or without Mig, we observed that in samples incubated with this chemokine (Fig. 4, band d) there was a higher proportion of BLM cells showing a polarized pattern of F-actin staining than in samples incubated in the absence of Mig (Fig. 4, a and c). Evaluation of these differences indicated that 71 ± 8% of cells incubated with Mig for 1 min displayed a polarized pattern of F-actin staining, mostly at cell edges, whereas 45 ± 8% of the cells incubated with medium without Mig showed this type of staining (n = 3). The percentages of cells showing a homogeneous F-actin staining were 23 ± 6% for cells incubated with Mig and 51 ± 7% of cells incubated in medium alone (n = 3). These differences were maintained for up to 7 min of incubation (not shown). To determine whether Mig could induce migration on BLM cells, we carried out chemotaxis assays through filters coated with extracellular matrix proteins. Mig was capable of triggering a chemotactic response on BLM cells across fibronectin and, to a lesser extent, across collagen in the range of 50–200 ng/ml of the chemokine (Fig.5). As expected due to the fact that Mig signals through a receptor coupled to Gi (19Loetscher M. Gerber B. Loetscher P. Jones S.A. Piali L. Clark-Lewis I. Baggiolini M. Moser B. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 963-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar, 34Loetscher M. Loetscher P. Brass N. Meese E. Moser B. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 3696-3705Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), pertussis toxin, an inhibitor of the Gαi subunit of G-proteins, completely abolished the Mig-induced BLM chemotaxis. Taken together these results indicate that Mig promotes migration of BLM melanoma cells and affects their cytoskeleton. To investigate whether Mig and SDF-1α were capable of influencing melanoma cell adhesion, we performed adhesion assays to both whole plasma fibronectin, which contains interaction sites for integrins VLA-5 and VLA-4, and to FN-H89, a fragment of fibronectin that contains the CS-1 site for interaction with VLA-4 but lacks the RGD central binding domain, a binding site for VLA-5. Mig up-regulated by 1.7–2.9-fold (n = 5) the adhesion of BLM cells to whole fibronectin with an optimal increase at 50 ng/ml of the chemokine and an adhesion time of 3.5 min, whereas anti-α5 mAb substantially, but not totally, inhibited the up-regulated BLM adhesion (Fig. 6 A). Mig also augmented BLM adhesion to FN-H89 (1.3–2.2-fold increase, n = 5), which was blocked by anti-α4 mAb, and anti-α4 mAb partially inhibited the enhanced adhesion to whole FN (Fig. 6 A). Together these data suggest that both integrins, but preferentially VLA-5, are used by BLM cells to attach to fibronectin. As several chemokines, including SDF-1α and SLC (CXCL21), can be found attached on endothelium (10Peled A. Grabovsky V. Habler L. Sandbank J. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Petit I. Ben-Hur H. Lapidot T.

Dorf M.E. von Adrian U.H. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 61-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), we investigated whether Mig coimmobilized with whole FN could also modulate melanoma cell adhesion. We obtained an average of a 2.2-fold increase of BLM adhesion to FN triggered by coimmobilized Mig at an optimal coating concentration of 200 ng/ml of the chemokine (Fig.6 A). Anti-β1 mAb completely blocked the up-regulated adhesion, suggesting that VLA-5 and/or VLA-4 were involved in this adhesion. Instead, IL-1β coimmobilized with FN did not influence BLM adhesion, and Mig alone did not support adhesion (Fig.6 A). SDF-1α was also capable of increasing MeWo cell adhesion to whole FN and FN-H89, involving both VLA-5 and VLA-4 (Fig. 6 B). To study whether Mig and SDF-1α could activate MAP kinases on melanoma cells, we incubated BLM and MeWo cells for different times with these chemokines, and changes in the phosphorylation of p44/42 (Erk1/2) and p38 MAP kinases were analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies recognizing the phosphorylated form of these kinases. Mig rapidly (0.5 min) up-regulated the phosphorylation of p44/42 MAP kinase on BLM cells; this increase was still detected after 7 min of exposure to the chemokine although to a lesser degree (Fig. 7 A). Untreated BLM cells displayed significant phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase, but exposure to Mig triggered an increase in this phosphorylation, but slower and to a lesser extent compared with p44/42 (Fig. 7 A). No detectable basal phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase was observed in MeWo melanoma cells in the absence of chemokines (Fig. 7 B). Incubation with SDF-1α notably up-regulated the phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase, which was already detected at 0.5 min, peaked at 1 min, and remained highly phosphorylated at 10 min of incubation (Fig. 7 B). During tumorigenesis, melanoma cells might encounter different chemokines produced in the tumor microenvironment by infiltrating inflammatory cells, such as macrophages and activated T lymphocytes, as well as by tumor cells (13Balkwill F. Mantovani A. Lancet. 2001; 357: 539-545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6050) Google Scholar) or displayed on the endothelium at metastasis sites. In the present study we show that several melanoma cell lines, including the highly invasive melanoma cell line BLM, and melanoma cells from macroscopically infiltrated lymph nodes express CXCR3, the receptor for chemokines Mig, IP-10, and interferon-inducible T cell α"

After transfection into host cells, the proteolytic cleavage of FK was blocked by TACE-specific inhibitors and was not detected in cells genetically altered to remove TACE activity. In contrast, the constitutive cleavage of FK was not mediated by TACE and proceeded normally in TACE-null fibroblasts. We conclude that TACE is primarily responsible for the inducible cleavage of FK.

A number of functionally diverse proteins exist both in full-length, membrane-bound forms and in soluble forms generated by post-translational cleavage. These include tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which is involved in inflammatory responses (8Black R.A. Rauch C.T. Kozlosky C.J. Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Wolfson M.F. Castner B.J. Stocking K.L.

An appropriate balance between the full-length and soluble forms of these proteins appears to be critical for homeostasis. For example, a failure of the proper cleavage of the β-amyloid precursor protein by secretase leads to formation of the amyloid-β peptide, found in the plaques of Alzheimer's patients (12Hooper N.M. Karran E.H. Turner A.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 265-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). The mechanism for regulating the cleavage of FK is unknown and may have important implications for understanding how cells are attracted to and captured by and eventually migrate through epithelial cells, including the vascular endothelium. Here we report that the protease responsible for the inducible cleavage of FK is TNF-α-converting enzyme (TACE; Ref. 8Black R.A. Rauch C.T. Kozlosky C.J. Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Wolfson M.F. Castner B.J. Stocking K.L. Reddy P. Srinivasan S. Nelson N. Boiani N. Schooley K.A. Gerhart M. Davis R. Fitzner J.N. Johnson R.S. Paxton R.J. March C.J. Cerretti D.P. Nature. 1997; 385: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (2728) Google Scholar). FK is also cleaved constitutively by a non-TACE protease, and neither the inducible nor the constitutive cleavage requires the di-arginine sequence. These studies provide the first evidence that TACE, a well-characterized protease critical for the production of the potent cytokine TNF-α, is involved in the generation of functional chemokines. Recombinant human soluble FK and a biotinylated polyclonal anti-FK antibody were obtained from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Rabbit anti-human FK antibody was from Torrey Pines Biolabs (San Diego, CA). TAPI-2 (IC-3) was a generous gift from Drs. Douglas Cerretti and Roy Black (Immunex, Seattle, WA).

Schall (ChemoCentryx, San Carlos, CA) and were maintained in minimal essential medium and Earle's balanced salt solution supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. ECV cells were also transfected with full-length FK in which the FLAG epitope (GSDYKDDDDK) was inserted between the chemokine domain and the mucin stalk or with a mutated form of FK in which the arginines at positions 347 and 348 were changed to alanines. All cDNA constructs were made in pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and all transfections were done with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies), following the manufacturer's instructions.

These cells express a neomycin resistance gene, and transfectants were produced by co-transfecting full-length FK and a zeocin resistance gene, pZeoSV2. These cells were maintained in minimal essential medium and Earle's balanced salt solution supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin and streptomycin, Geneticin (800 μg/ml), and zeocin (400 μg/ml; Invitrogen). Stably transfected cell lines were selected by flow cytometry by staining the cells with biotinylated polyclonal anti-FK antibody (1.5 μg/ml; R & D Systems), followed by streptavidin-phycoerythrin (1 μg/ml; Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). Wild-type CHO cells stably expressing FK were also prepared. TACE−/− and TACE+/+ fibroblasts were generous gifts from Drs. Douglas Cerretti and Roy Black. These cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 1% fetal calf serum and antibiotics and were co-transfected with full-length FK and pZeoSV2 as described above. High-expressing lines were selected by flow cytometry and grown in the presence of Geneticin (800 μg/ml) and zeocin (400 μg/ml). Transfected cell lines were seeded at ∼2.5 × 106 cells/100-mm plate 1 day before the experiment. One hour before the experiment, the medium was changed to serum-free minimal essential medium and Earle's balanced salt solution; 20 min before the addition of PMA, metalloprotease inhibitors (or control vehicle) were added. PMA (1 μm dissolved in Me2SO) was added to the cells for 30 min. The conditioned medium was collected, spun for 30 min at 30,000 × g to remove cellular debris, and concentrated with a Centricon column (CentriPlus YM-10). One-third of the concentrated conditioned medium was mixed with 4 × sample buffer (0.004% bromphenol blue, 120 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 6% SDS, and 10% 2-mercaptoethanol) and added to each lane of an SDS 10% polyacrylamide gel. In experiments involving transfected fibroblasts, it was necessary to deglycosylate the proteins before detection by Western blotting. This was done using a glycoprotein deglycosylation kit (Calbiochem), following the manufacturer's instructions. After transfer of proteins to nitrocellulose membranes, the blots were probed with the biotinylated anti-human FK antibody (0.1 μg/ml; R & D Systems), followed by streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (1:1000 dilution;Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Blots were developed with the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and band intensities were quantitated on a Molecular Imager FX instrument (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). In some experiments, cell lysates were examined for FK content. After the conditioned medium was collected, the cells were lysed by adding immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Na pyrophosphate, and 1% Triton X-100) supplemented with protease inhibitors (1 μmleupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2.1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin). The cell lysates were precleared by incubation with 100 μl of anti-rabbit IgG-agarose (Sigma) that had been blocked by preincubation with 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in immunoprecipitation buffer for 2 h at 4 °C. The samples were spun for 10 min in a microfuge, and FK was immunoprecipitated by incubation with rabbit anti-human FK antibody (6 μg/ml; Torrey Pines) overnight at 4 °C. Anti-rabbit IgG-agarose (100 μl, preblocked with 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin) was used to precipitate the FK-antibody complex. Samples were resuspended in SDS sample buffer, incubated for 10 min without heating, and electrophoresed as described above. To study the cleavage of FK, we used cell lines that stably expressed either wild-type or mutated forms of full-length FK. Each was expressed at the cell surface at similar levels, as determined by flow cytometry (data not shown). Soluble FK was detected in the conditioned medium of transfected epithelial cells, and its concentration was markedly increased by the addition of PMA for 30 min (Fig.1 A). Inclusion of EDTA in the medium reduced cleavage, indicating that the protease activity depends on divalent cations. The di-arginine sequence in FK located in juxtoposition to the transmembrane domain has been implicated as the cleavage site. To examine the importance of this sequence in the proteolysis of FK, we mutated these two arginines to alanines. This mutation had no effect on the PMA-induced cleavage (Fig.1 B). Metalloproteases are divalent cation-dependent enzymes and are known to cleave membrane proteins. We therefore asked whether cleavage of FK was mediated by a metalloprotease. The metalloprotease inhibitor 1,10-phenanthroline (14Dri P. Gasparini C. Menegazzi R. Cramer R. Albéri L. Presani G. Garbisa S. Patriarca P. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2165-2172Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) partially blocked FK cleavage, and the effect was dose-dependent (Fig.2 A); additional inhibition was not seen at higher concentrations (data not shown). Similar results were obtained with GM6001 (15Ilan N. Mohsenin A. Cheung L. Madri J.A. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 362-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), a metalloprotease inhibitor of broad specificity (Fig. 2 B). TAPI-2 is a hyroxamate-based inhibitor of matrix metalloproteases that has high activity against TACE, the protease that cleaves TNF-α (13Arribas J. Coodly L. Vollmer P. Kishimoto T.K. Rose-John S.

These data suggested that the enzyme that cleaved FK is very similar or possibly identical to TACE.Figure 3Inhibition of PMA-induced FK cleavage by TAPI-2.

After transfection with full-length FK, we noted higher levels of soluble FK in the conditioned medium of wild-type CHO cells than in the medium of transfected ECV304 cells (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3), suggesting a higher rate of constitutive cleavage (Fig. 4 A). Addition of PMA induced further cleavage of FK in both wild-type CHO and CHO-M1 cells but at a markedly lower level in the CHO-M1 cells (Fig. 4 A). Addition of TAPI-2 did not affect the amount of soluble FK in the medium, confirming the absence of TACE activity in the CHO-M1 cells (data not shown). Western blots of the cell lysates confirmed that FK was expressed at comparable levels in the CHO wild-type and CHO-M1 cell lines (Fig. 4 B). To determine whether TACE was responsible for the constitutive cleavage, we followed the accumulation of soluble FK in the conditioned medium of unactivated transfected CHO and CHO-M1 cells (Fig.5). The rate of accumulation of soluble FK was similar in these two cell lines, particularly at the later time points. These data suggest that, unlike the PMA-induced cleavage of FK, TACE is not primarily responsible for the constitutive cleavage. Consistent with this result, TAPI-2 had little or no effect on the rate of constitutive cleavage of FK (data not shown). To further test the hypothesis that TACE was the protease responsible for the induced cleavage of FK, we transfected TACE−/−fibroblasts with FK. Similar surface expression of FK was obtained in stably transfected TACE−/− and TACE+/+fibroblasts (Fig. 6). Western blots of cell lysates also indicated very similar levels of FK expression in the wild-type and TACE−/− fibroblasts (data not shown). Addition of PMA resulted in robust cleavage of FK in the wild-type but not in the TACE−/− fibroblasts (Fig. 6, B andC). Emerging in vivo data suggest an important role for FK in transplant rejection (18Haskell C.A. Hancock W.W. Salant D.J. Gao W. Csizmadia V. Peters W. Faia K. Fituri O. Rottman J.B. Charo I.F. J.

Because regulation of the cleavage event that generates soluble FK is likely to have profound effects on the biological functions of FK, we sought to identify the responsible protease(s). The major finding in this paper is that TACE, a well-characterized protease that generates biologically active TNF-α, accounts for virtually all of the inducible cleavage of FK. In contrast, the constitutive cleavage of FK was not mediated by TACE and was not blocked by typical metalloprotease inhibitors. The di-arginine sequence of fractalkine at the plasma membrane interface was not required for either the inducible or the constitutive cleavage. Several lines of evidence support the claim that TACE is responsible for the inducible cleavage of FK. First, cleavage was blocked by chelation of divalent cations with EDTA. Second, three structurally diverse metalloprotease inhibitors blocked cleavage. Third, there was little inducible cleavage detected when FK was expressed in CHO cells that had been genetically modified to prevent the generation of proteolytically active TACE. Fourth, little or no inducible cleavage of FK was evident in fibroblasts derived from TACE−/− mice. Taken together, these data provide strong evidence that virtually all of the inducible cleavage of FK is mediated by TACE. Interestingly, the constitutive cleavage of FK seen in both the ECV and CHO cells was also present in the TACE-null CHO-M1 and TACE−/− fibroblasts. These data indicate that TACE is not responsible for the constitutive cleave of FK. Several full-length membrane proteins are cleaved to generate soluble forms that retain biological activity. These include such structurally and functionally unrelated proteins as angiotensin-converting enzyme (12Hooper N.M. Karran E.H. Turner A.J. Biochem.

In many cases, cleavage occurs in a stalk region near the plasma membrane and is often up-regulated by activators of protein kinase C (12Hooper N.M. Karran E.H. Turner A.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 265-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). The proteinases that mediate this cleavage have been termed sheddases or secretases, and many are zinc-dependent metalloproteinases (12Hooper N.M. Karran E.H. Turner A.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 265-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). TACE is a member of a family of proteins containing a disintegrin and metalloprotease domain (ADAMS proteins). There are >30 ADAMS proteins, and they are involved in functions as diverse as neurogenesis, myotube formation, and proteolytic cleavage of cell surface proteins (for a recent review of the ADAMS proteins, see Ref. 21Black R.A. White J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 654-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). To date, TACE is the only ADAMS protein that has been cloned and characterized in vivo.

The physiological importance of TACE is underscored by the fact that TACE-null mice are not viable (9Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Reddy P. Stocking K.L. Sunnarborg S.W. Lee D.C. Russell W.E. Castner B.J.

Science. 1998; 282: 1281-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar). The current study adds FK to the list of proteins that are post-translationally modified by TACE. Like other members of the ADAMS family of metalloproteases, TACE is a multidomain, type I transmembrane protein consisting of a zinc-dependent catalytic domain, a disintegrin domain that mediates the binding to integrins, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail. As noted above, TACE cleaves a number of membrane-bound proteins, but amino acid sequences at the cleavage sites of these proteins do not resemble the TNF-α cleavage site, which under physiological conditions is between alanine 76 and valine 77 (12). Analysis of the cleavage site of TACE substrates does not reveal the presence of a well-defined consensus sequence but instead suggests that the length of the stalk between the cleavage site and the plasma membrane is important (12Hooper N.M. Karran E.H. Turner A.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 265-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). One interpretation of these data is that the binding of TACE to its substrate is the critical event and that, once bound, the protease can cleave at a number of different amino acid sequences. Consistent with this hypothesis, deletion of at least 12 amino acids was necessary to completely block shedding of TNF-α (24Decoster E. Vanhaesebroeck B. Vandenabeele P. Grooten J. Fiers W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18473-18478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The di-arginine sequence near the plasma membrane has been implicated as the cleavage site that generates soluble FK (1Bazan J.F. Bacon K.B. Hardiman G. Wang W. Soo K. Rossi D. Greaves D.R. Zlotnik A. Schall T.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 640-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar, 3Harrison J.K. Jiang Y. Chen S. Xia Y. Maciejewski D. McNamara R.K. Streit W.J. Salafranca M.N.

In this study, we found that mutation of these two arginines to alanines had no effect on either the inducible or the constitutive cleavage of FK. These data suggest that extensive mutatgenesis of the FK stalk just amino-terminal to the plasma membrane may be required to create a noncleavable form of FK. Recently, Matloubian et al. (25Matloubian M. David A. Engel S. Ryan J.E. Cyster J.G. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 298-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar) described CXCL16, a second member of the CX3C family of chemokines. CXCL16 is expressed on dendritic cells, and binds to naive CD8 T cells, natural killer T cells, and a subset of CD4 T cells (25Matloubian M. David A. Engel S. Ryan J.E. Cyster J.G. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 298-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). CXCL16 exists in both membrane-bound and soluble forms, and it is reasonable to speculate that soluble CXCL16 might attract T cells to the dendritic cells. This chemokine may therefore serve to facilitate interactions between dendritic cells and T cells. The protease responsible for CXCL16 cleavage has not been characterized, but the findings presented here make TACE a likely candidate. Whether mice expressing a noncleaveable form of CXCL16 would have an immune deficit remains to be determined. In summary, we have found that TACE, the ADAMS family metalloprotease that cleaves TNF-α, is primarily responsible for the inducible cleavage of FK. The relative contributions of the full-length and soluble forms of FK in mediating cell-cell interactions are not known, but the identification of TACE as the cleavage enzyme should aid in this effort, as well as facilitate creation of a mouse with a noncleavable form of FK. This novel role for TACE identifies a potentially important link between local cytokine production and the cleavage of FK in activated cells. While this paper was in the review process, Gartonet al.

https://openalex.org/W2075879183,"Here, we show that a nucleosome obstructing transcription from the IFN-beta promoter slides in vivo in response to virus infection, thus exposing the previously masked TATA box and the initiation site, a requirement for transcriptional activation. Our experiments also revealed that this mode of chromatin remodeling is a two-step reaction. First, the enhanceosome recruits the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex that modifies the nucleosome to allow binding of TBP. Second, DNA bending is induced by TBP binding, and the nucleosome slides to a new position. Experiments with other DNA binding proteins demonstrated a strong correlation between the ability to bend DNA and nucleosome sliding, suggesting that the sliding is induced by the bend."

By binding to the prosthetic heme group of GC, NO leads to the up to 200-fold activation of the enzyme (3Humbert P. Niroomand F. Fischer G. Mayer B. Koesling D. Hinsch K.D. Gausepohl H. Frank R.

Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1093-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The subsequent increase in cGMP formation results in the activation of cGMP effector molecules (cGMP-activated protein kinases, cGMP-regulated phosphodiesterases, cGMP-gated ion channels), which mediate the NO-induced effects. Besides its role in the cardiovascular system, NO acts as a freely diffusible transmitter in numerous pathways in the central and peripheral nervous systems (2Garthwaite J. Boulton C.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 683-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (1533) Google Scholar, 5Snyder S.H. Jaffrey S.R. Zakhary R. Brain. Res. Brain Res.

Schultz G. Koesling D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6863-6868Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The NO-sensitive GC is a heterodimeric enzyme consisting of an α and a β subunit (8Harteneck C. Koesling D. Soling A. Schultz G. Böhme E. FEBS Lett. 1990; 272: 221-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 9Buechler W.A. Nakane M. Murad F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 174: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The α1β1 heterodimer corresponds to the enzyme purified from lung; homology screening yielded the α2 and β2 subunits (10Yuen P.S. Potter L.R. Garbers D.L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10872-10878Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 11Harteneck C. Wedel B. Koesling D. Malkewitz J. Böhme E. Schultz G. FEBS Lett. 1991; 292: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In contrast to the β2 subunit that did not form a catalytically active enzyme with any other subunit in most experimental settings, the α2 subunit yielded a NO-sensitive cGMP-forming enzyme upon coexpression with the β1 subunit (11Harteneck C. Wedel B. Koesling D. Malkewitz J. Böhme E. Schultz G. FEBS Lett. 1991; 292: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). On the protein level, the α2 subunit was shown to occur in placenta, and the β1 subunit was identified as the dimerizing partner (12Russwurm M. Behrends S. Harteneck C. Koesling D. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis showed comparatively high amounts of α2 message in placenta, uterus, and brain (13Budworth J. Meillerais S. Charles I. Powell K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 696-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Recently, the wide distribution of α2 mRNA in rat brain with a particular abundance in cerebellum and hippocampus was demonstrated using in situhybridization (14Gibb B.J. Garthwaite J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2001; 13: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). All GC subunits contain the so-called cyclase catalytic domain also conserved in the membrane-bound GC and in the adenylyl cyclase within the C-terminal regions; the N termini of the α1 and the β1 subunits have been shown to be required for proper coordination of the prosthetic heme group (15Wedel B. Humbert P. Harteneck C. Foerster J. Malkewitz J. Böhme E. Schultz G. Koesling D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2592-2596Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 16Zhao Y. Schelvis J.P. Babcock G.T. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4502-4509Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). With only 30% of identical amino acids, the N-terminal region of the α2subunit differs considerably from the corresponding part of the α1 subunit. Although the catalytic domains are very much conserved, the very C-terminal amino acids are unrelated. Despite these differences in primary structure, extensive analysis of the purified isoforms of GC (α1β1 and α2β1) did not reveal any regulatory or kinetic differences (12Russwurm M. Behrends S. Harteneck C. Koesling D. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Therefore, the physiological relevance of two similarly operating isoforms of GC remained unclear. It has been suggested that the C terminus of the α2subunit contains a sequence that allows the interaction with the PDZ domain of α1-synthrophin (17Hoffmüller U. Russwurm M. Kleinjung F. Ashurst J. Oschkinat H. Volkmer-Engmert R. Koesling D. Schneider-Mergener J. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1999; 38: 2000-2004Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). PDZ domains, their name being derived from the first proteins in which they were discovered (PSD-95, Dlg, ZO-1) are protein modules of about 100 amino acids that apparently mainly occur in proteins of the cytoskeleton. They are supposed to function as molecular adaptors to form functional complexes by interacting with the C termini of their binding partners in most cases (for reviews see Refs. 18Craven S.E.

In addition, the neuronal NO synthase has been shown to interact with the PDZ domain-containing PSD-95 (postsynaptic-density-95) (21Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Gee S.H. McGee A.W. Craven S.E.

PSD-95 was the first member of a family of synaptic proteins containing typical protein-interaction motives: three N-terminal PDZ domains, one SH3 domain, and a C-terminal guanylate kinases homology region. Three other members of this family are known up to this date: SAP97 (23Müller B.M. Kistner U. Veh R.W. Cases-Langhoff C. Becker B. Gundelfinger E.D. Garner C.C. J.

Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7407-7415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We considered the PDZ domain-containing protein PSD-95 as a tempting candidate for a α2β1GC interaction. In the current report, we present multiple lines of evidence for an interaction of the α2β1 isoform of GC with PSD-95. We show that the C-terminal peptide of the α2subunit interacts with the PDZ domains of PSD-95 and related proteins (PSD-93, SAP97, SAP 102) in brain homogenates; vice versa, the PDZ domains of PSD-95 are shown to exclusively bind the α2β1 and not the α1β1GC isoform both present in brain. Thein vivo existence of α2β1-PSD-95 complexes is shown in coprecipitation experiments. In contrast to the α1β1 isoform, the α2β1 heterodimer is found in the membrane fraction of synaptosomes demonstrating that the PSD-95 interaction results in the membrane association of this so far soluble-considered GC isoform. Antibodies directed against the C-terminal peptides of the α1 subunit (KKDVEEANANFLGKASGID), α2 subunit (KKVSYNIGTMFLRETSL), and β1 subunit (SRKNTGTEETEQDEN) were obtained as described in Ref. 27Koesling D.

Immunoaffinity purification of the antibodies was performed according to standard protocols using the respective cysteine-tagged antigenic peptides coupled to Sulfolink Coupling Gel (Pierce). Protein samples were resolved on 7.5% or 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. After blocking the membranes, the following antibodies were used for detection: immunoaffinity-purified antibodies against the three GC subunits (α1, α2, and β1), monoclonal anti-PSD-95 antibody (Clone 7E3–1B8, Affinity Bioreagents), antisera against SAP102, SAP97, and PSD-93 (Affinity Bioreagents). Secondary peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse IgG and anti-rabbit IgG antibodies were from Sigma. Detection was performed using ECL and ECL+ Western blotting detection reagents from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. GC activity was determined by incubation of the samples (containing 5–15 μg of protein) for 10 min at 37 °C with 1 mm cGMP, 250 μm [α-32P]GTP (about 0.2 μCi), 3 mm MgCl2, 3 mmdl-dithiothreitol, 0.5 g/liter bovine serum albumin, 0.25 g/liter creatine phosphokinase, 5 mm creatine phosphate, 1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and 50 mmtriethanolamine hydrochloride, pH 7.4, in a total volume of 100 μl. The incubation was started by addition of diethylamine-NO (final concentration 100 μm) and by transferring the tubes from ice to 37 °C. Reactions were stopped by ZnCO3precipitation, and isolation of the enzymatically formed cGMP was performed as described by Schultz and Böhme (28Schultz G. Böhme E. Bergmeyer J. Grassl M. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. IV. Verlag Chemie, Weinheim, Deerfield Beach, Basel1984: 379-389Google Scholar). Rat cDNAs encoding for PDZ 1 (amino acids 62–156), PDZ 2 (amino acids 157–256), and PDZ 3 (amino acids 310–404) of PSD-95 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into pGEX2T vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The identity of the clones was verified by sequencing and expression was performed in DH5α cells (Life technologies). After induction of expression with 0.4 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for at least 6 h, cells were collected by centrifugation at 7700 × gfor 10 min and lyzed in phosphate-buffered saline by sonication. The lysate (1–3 mg/ml) was cleared by centrifugation at 50,000 ×g for 15 min. Rat brains were homogenized in 5 volumes of phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors (0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mmbenzamidine, 1 μm pepstatin A). Subsequently, SDS was added to a final concentration of 1% to solubilize the membranes, and the homogenate was incubated (10 min, 4 °C) and cleared by centrifugation (50,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad) following trichloroacetic acid precipitation. Proteins (40 μg) were analyzed in Western blots. The cysteine-tagged α2 C-terminal peptide (C-FLRETSL-COOH) and, as control, a scrambled peptide (C-SLFTRLE-COOH) were coupled to Sulfolink Coupling Gel (Pierce) according to instructions of the manufacturer. Rat brains were homogenized in 5 volumes of 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 (Calbiochem), and 25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, and centrifuged for 30 min at 15,000 × g. The resulting supernatant (1.8 ml containing ∼18 mg of protein) was incubated with the respective immobilized peptides (50 μl of resin) on an overhead rotator for 2 h at 4 °C. After extensive washing, interacting proteins were eluted with Laemmli buffer, and aliquots (5%) of the samples were analyzed by Western blotting. Cleared lysates (1.8 ml) of Escherichia coli expressing the three PDZ domains of PSD-95 as GST fusion proteins prepared as described above were incubated for 30 min with the immobilized peptides (25 μl of resin). After washing, sample buffer was added, and aliquots (5%) of the samples were analyzed in Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained gels. The identity of the fusion proteins was confirmed in Western blots using anti-GST antibodies (Sigma). Crude synaptosomes were prepared by combination of the methods described by Cohen et al. (29Cohen R.S. Blomberg F. Berzins K. Siekevitz P. J. Cell Biol. 1977; 74: 181-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) and Mayer et al. (30Mayer B. Klatt P. Böhme E. Schmidt K. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 2024-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Rat brains were homogenized in 4 volumes of buffer A (0.32 msucrose, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 containing 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mm benzamidine, 1 μm pepstatin A, and 2 mmdl-dithiothreitol) by 15 strokes with a glass-Teflon Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer. The homogenate was diluted 1:10 in buffer A, and a low speed pellet was removed by centrifugation (750 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). The resulting supernatant was recentrifuged (17,300 × g, 10 min, 4 °C) to pellet the crude synaptosomal fraction. The crude synaptosomes were lyzed by hypoosmotic shock and ultrasound in 1 mm EDTA and 50 mm triethanolamine hydrochloride, pH 7.4, containing protease inhibitors and dl-dithiothreitol as in buffer A. The lysate was kept 10 min at 4 °C, and subsequently the NaCl concentration was increased to 150 mm to remove loosely associated proteins of the membrane. The lysate was then recentrifuged (32,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C). The resulting synaptosomal cytosol and membranes were analyzed in Western blots, and cGMP-forming activity in the fractions was determined as described above. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad) after trichloroacetic acid precipitation of the proteins. Crude synaptosomes were prepared as described above and resuspended in buffer A. Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1% to extract a fraction of PSD-95 and associated proteins. After a 10-min incubation at 4 °C, the Triton X-100 extract was centrifuged (32,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C) to remove the cell debris. PSD-95 immunoprecipitation was carried out as follows: the synaptosomal extract (4.2 ml containing ∼10 mg of protein) was incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with monoclonal anti PSD-95-antibody (15 μl, Clone 7E3–1B8, Affinity Bioreagents) and 250 μl of Dynabeads Pan-mouse IgG (Dynal); as control, the incubation was performed without the monoclonal anti PSD-95 antibody. Dynabeads were precipitated using a magnet, and the beads were extensively washed with buffer A. Precipitated proteins were eluted with 65 μl of SDS-containing sample buffer, and 20 μl of the samples were analyzed in Western blots. The three PDZ-GST fusion proteins prepared as described above were loaded onto glutathione-Sepharose CL4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as suggested by the manufacturer. The amounts of loaded GST fusion proteins were checked by Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). Rat brains were homogenized in 5 volumes of a buffer containing 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mm benzamidine, 1 μm pepstatin A, 2 mmdl-dithiothreitol, and 50 mm triethanolamine hydrochloride, pH 7.4, and centrifuged for 1 h at 220,000 × g to obtain a cytosolic fraction. Cytosolic proteins (10 mg of protein in 2.5 ml) were incubated with each of the three immobilized PDZ-GST fusion proteins (200 μl of Sepharose with ∼1.2 mg of GST fusion protein) for 30 min at 4 °C. After extensive washing, 2.5 μl of the Sepharose were used to detect bound GC by measuring NO-stimulated cGMP-forming activity as described above. For Western blots, PDZ interacting proteins were eluted with SDS-containing sample buffer and analyzed in Western blots (2.5 μl of resin/lane). To date, the existence of the α2 subunit of GC on protein level has been demonstrated only in human placenta (12Russwurm M. Behrends S. Harteneck C. Koesling D. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). As the occurrence of the α2 subunit in brain was a prerequisite for a possible PSD-95/α2 interaction, we studied the expression of this subunit in rat brain using immunoaffinity-purified antibodies generated against the C-terminal peptide of the α2 subunit. As can be seen on the Western blot (Fig.1), a protein with the appropriate molecular mass was detected in brain homogenates showing the expression of the α2 subunit in rat brain. In addition, the presence of the α1 and β1 subunits was demonstrated with the respective affinity-purified antibodies. The antibody against the α1 subunit detected an additional high molecular mass band; however the nature of this band remains to be clarified. The existence of the α2 subunit in brain encouraged us to investigate whether the C-terminal peptide of the α2subunit was capable of interacting with the PDZ domain-containing protein PSD-95 and related proteins. For that reason, we incubated the immobilized C-terminal α2 peptide with brain extracts and subsequently separated interacting proteins on SDS gels. Western blots performed with antibodies against members of the PSD-95 family revealed that PSD-95 and the related proteins PSD-93, SAP97, and SAP102 bound to the α2 peptide (Fig. 2). The reaction was specific as binding of the synaptic proteins to the immobilized α2 peptide was abolished in the presence of free α2 peptide (0.05 mg/ml, not shown) and a scrambled α2 peptide did not bind any of these proteins (see Fig.2). Furthermore, these results indicate that the peptide corresponding to the C-terminal sequence of the α2 subunit was able to interact with members of PSD-95 family. In vivo interaction of α2β1GC and PSD-95 should lead to the colocalization of the α2β1 isoform and PSD-95 in synaptic membranes. As PSD-95 has been shown to be enriched in membranes of synaptosomal preparations (22Cho K.O. Hunt C.A. Kennedy M.B. Neuron. 1992; 9: 929-942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar), we proceeded to study the subcellular distribution of GC subunits in this material. All GC subunits were detected in crude synaptosomes (not shown); however, after disruption of the synaptosomes, the α1 subunit was almost exclusively found in the synaptosomal cytosol, whereas the majority of the α2 subunit was detected in the membrane fraction (Fig. 3 A). The β1 subunit was distributed almost equally between membranes and cytosol. This finding is in accordance with our former observation that the β1 subunit represents the dimerizing partner for both the α2 and α1 subunits. The immunological evidence of a cytosolic and a membrane-associated NO-sensitive GC was further supported by determination of NO-stimulated cGMP formation in the respective fractions (Fig. 3 B). Enzyme activities in the presence of NO amounted to ∼4 and ∼1 nmol × mg−1 × min−1 in cytosolic and membrane fractions, respectively. Non-stimulated cGMP-forming activities were below the detection limit. These results show that the membrane-associated isoform of GC was responsible for a substantial amount of the NO-stimulated cGMP-forming activity in synaptosomes and established the α1β1GC as the cytosolic and the α2β1GC as the membrane-associated isoform of GC. Moreover, the results demonstrate the presence of the α2β1 heterodimer in the PSD-95-containing compartment. To study the existence of in vivo formed α2β1/PSD-95 complexes in rat brain, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments. To be able to precipitate PSD-95, synaptosomes had to be extracted with Triton X-100 to solubilize at least a portion of the otherwise membrane-associated PSD-95. The Triton extracts were incubated with monoclonal antibodies against PSD-95, and precipitated proteins were analyzed in Western blots using immunoaffinity-purified antibodies against each of the GC subunits. In the PSD-95 precipitate, the α2 antibodies recognized a protein with the appropriate molecular mass clearly showing that the α2 subunit is associated with PSD-95 (Fig. 4). The dimerizing partner of the α2 subunit, the β1 subunit, was found in the PSD-95 precipitate, too. In contrast, the α1 subunit was not detected in the PSD-95 precipitate, indicating that only the α2 subunit but not the α1 subunit is able to interact with PDZ domains. To study the molecular basis for the α2β1/PSD-95 interaction, we generated GST fusion proteins of each of the PDZ domains of PSD-95 and tried to precipitate these fusion proteins with the immobilized α2C-terminal peptide. As can be seen on the Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained gel (Fig. 5), all three PDZ domains were precipitated by the α2 peptide showing that the PSD-95/α2 subunit interaction was mediated by the PDZ domains of PSD-95 and the C-terminal peptide of the α2subunit. However, in this experimental setting no binding preference of the α2 peptide to one of the three PDZ domains was detectable. We attributed this lack of differential binding to the fact that only the minimal parts of both binding partners required for interaction were present in the experiment. Therefore, we used the immobilized PDZ-GST fusion proteins to precipitate the complete α2β1 enzyme of brain cytosol and quantified the amount of PDZ domain-bound GC by measuring GC activity. Here, the third PDZ domain of PSD-95 precipitated substantially more NO-stimulated cyclic GMP-forming activity than the first and second PDZ domains (Fig. 6 A) indicating a higher affinity of the complete α2β1 enzyme to the third PDZ domain. To ensure that PDZ domain-bound cGMP-forming activity was solely due to the α2β1isoform, we performed Western blot analysis of the PDZ precipitates. As shown in Fig. 6 B, only the α2 and β1 subunits but not the α1 subunit were detected, again demonstrating that the α2β1but not the α1β1 isoform interacted with PSD-95.Figure 6α2β1GC preferentially binds to the third PDZ domain of PSD-95. Brain cytosol was incubated with GST fusion proteins of the three PDZ domains of PSD-95 (PDZ 1, PDZ 2, PDZ 3) bound to GSH-Sepharose. As control, an unrelated GST fusion protein was used. Shown are the NO-stimulated cGMP formation (A) and the Western blots of the GC subunits (B) in the respective precipitate. The input lane represents 50% of the cytosolic proteins used for precipitation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Nitric oxide has been implicated to be involved in synaptic transmission since the late 1980's, and a role in neuronal plasticity has been proposed. Although other targets for NO might exist, the NO-sensitive GC is the best studied NO receptor. However, little information about NO-sensitive GC in brain is available. In the current report, we studied the so far unnoticed guanylyl cyclase isoform α2β1 and present evidence that the special quality of this isoform is defined by the α2C-terminal peptide which is able to mediate the interaction with PDZ domains. In particular, we studied the α2β1/PSD-95 interaction, thereby demonstrating for the first time the existence of the α2β1 heterodimer in brain and addressing the so far unattended aspect in the GC research, i.e. the membrane association of the until now considered cytosolic enzyme. PDZ domains are present in a plethora of proteins and have been reported to act as molecular adaptors to direct the subcellular distribution of proteins thereby mediating the formation of functional complexes. In brain, PSD-95 and related proteins have been proposed to play important roles e.g. by clustering NMDA receptors at excitatory synapses and by anchoring the receptor to downstream effector proteins like the neuronal NO synthase. Mice deficient in PSD-95 showed unaffected synaptic morphology and NMDA-receptor function but featured impaired learning and enhanced long-term potentiation (31Migaud M. Charlesworth P. Dempster M. Webster L.C. Watabe A.M. Makhinson M. He Y. Ramsay M.F. Morris R.G. Morrison J.H. O'Dell T.J. Grant S.G. Nature. 1998; 396: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). These results emphasize the importance of the formation of “transducisomes” downstream the NMDA receptor for synaptic plasticity and learning. In most cases, PDZ domains bind to the C-terminal sequence of their binding partners, although in the case of the NO synthase an internal stretch of amino acids has been reported to account for the interaction with PSD-95 (32Christopherson K.S. Hillier B.J. Lim W.A. Bredt D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27467-27473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). A C-terminal consensus sequence (S/T)X(V/I) for proteins interacting with the PDZ domains of PSD-95 has been deduced from the known binding partners of PSD-95 (18Craven S.E. Bredt D.S. Cell. 1998; 93: 495-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that the α2 peptide (RETSL) contains a leucine residue at the C-terminal position, we were able to show that the C-terminal α2 peptide does bind to the PDZ domains of PSD-95. The relevance of this finding is corroborated by the demonstration that the recombinantly expressed PDZ domains are able to precipitate the α2β1 holoenzyme of brain extracts. As binding of the α2β1GC isoform to the third PDZ domain was most pronounced, this PDZ domain very likely represents the structure responsible for binding of the α2 C-terminal peptide in vivo. The physiological occurrence of the α2/PSD-95 interaction observed ex vivo was confirmed in coimmunoprecipitation experiments with PSD-95. Moreover, not only the α2 but also the β1 subunit was found in PSD-95 precipitates. These results clearly show that the α2β1isoform is associated with PSD-95 and support our former finding that the β1 subunit represents the physiological dimerizing partner of the α2 subunit. Our data indicate targeting of a central component of the NO/cGMP cascade by PSD-95. PSD-95 as a molecular adaptor contains three PDZ domains; binding of NMDA-receptor has been shown to occur via the first and second PDZ domains (33Kornau H.C. Schenker L.T. Kennedy M.B. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1995; 269: 1737-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (1622) Google Scholar, 34Niethammer M. Kim E. Sheng M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2157-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the neuronal NO synthase has been reported to interact with the second PDZ motif (21Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Gee S.H. McGee A.W. Craven S.E. Santillano D.R. Wu Z. Huang F. Xia H. Peters M.F. Froehner S.C. Bredt D.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 757-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). Moreover, the neuronal NO synthase has been shown to be selectively stimulated by Ca2+ entering the cell through NMDA receptors while Ca2+ provided by other channels is not as effective (35Garthwaite J. Charles S.L. Chess-Williams R. Nature. 1988; 336: 385-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (2271) Google Scholar, 36Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (3118) Google Scholar, 37Kiedrowski L. Costa E. Wroblewski J.T. J. Neurochem. 1992; 58: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The interaction of the α2β1GC with the PSD-95 third PDZ domain would lead to the formation of a signaling microdomain composed of Ca2+-permeable NMDA receptors, Ca2+-dependent neuronal NO synthase, and the NO effector α2β1GC within the postsynaptic density. The proximity of the NO-generating and the NO-sensing enzyme suggests that NO concentrations differ within a cell, and a close contact between the neuronal NO synthase and the α2β1GC is required to transduce NO signals in certain cellular compartments without rising the overall NO concentration. On the other hand, PSD-95 may not be the only interaction partner of α2β1GC since the C-terminal peptide of the α2 subunit precipitates other members of the PSD-95 family of proteins. Presynaptic targeting of α2β1GC by PDZ-containing proteins such as SAP97 also appears reasonable. In this case, NO produced in the postsynaptic nerve terminal could act as a retrograde messenger for presynaptically located GC. The current lack of suitable antibodies for immunohistochemistry addresses these questions to future studies. However, our results provide the necessary requirements for a synaptic localization of the α2β1 isoform of the NO-sensitive GC, thereby enabling the enzyme to act as the mediator of the NO effects in synaptic transmission. By the interaction with PSD-95, the α2β1heterodimer is recruited to the membrane as shown by Western blot analysis and determination of GC activity in cytosolic and membrane fractions of synaptosomes. Thus, in the current report, we show for the first time the association of a substantial portion of the NO-stimulated cGMP-forming activity to the membrane, which is not due to nonspecific binding of the soluble α1β1isoform but to the specific targeting of the α2β1GC by a PDZ domain-containing protein. Further experiments have to show whether this membrane association of the α2β1 isoform of GC via PDZ domains represents a general biological principle also found in other tissues. Up to this date, GCs have been divided in membrane-bound and soluble enzymes. This categorization may be the reason why this membrane-associated NO-sensitive GC has been overlooked for the past 20 years. The classification in membrane-bound and soluble guanylyl cyclase enzymes is incompatible with the physiological existence of receptor-linked membrane-bound GCs, a membrane-associated NO-sensitive GC (α2β1), and a soluble NO-sensitive GC (α1β1). Rather, we suggest the classification of the enzyme family according to the regulatory properties of their members, i.e. receptor-linked GCs and NO-sensitive GCs.

Diabetic retinopathy is characterized by an increased retinal neovascularization due to the action of the angiogenic factor, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). In this report, we show that injection of insulin and glycated albumin (Alb-AGE) to mice increases VEGF mRNA expression in eyes. Insulin and Alb-AGE stimulate VEGF mRNA and protein expression in retinal epithelial cells (ARPE-19). Alb-AGE-induced VEGF expression is not modulated by the use of antioxidants,N-acetyl-l-cysteine or pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate, or by an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), wortmannin. However, using an inhibitor of ERK activation, U0126, we show that Alb-AGE stimulates VEGF expression through an ERK-dependent pathway. Accordingly, we found that Alb-AGE activated mitogen-activate protein kinase, ERK1/2, JNK1/2, but not p38, and that Alb-AGE did not activate PI3K and PKB. Moreover, Alb-AGE activated the transcription factor, hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) DNA binding activity. This activation is mediated by an increase in accumulation of the HIF-1α protein through an ERK-dependent pathway.

Marceau L. Lancet. 2000; 356: 757-761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Chronic hyperglycemia, per se, has several effects on cell homeostasis. Among them, hyperglycemia induces the production of advanced glycation end products (AGEs1), generated by non-enzymatic reactions between glucose and free amino reactive group of proteins and lipids (2Brownlee M. Cerami A. Vlassara H. N. Engl. J. Med. 1988; 318: 1315-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (2345) Google Scholar). AGEs and their intermediates have been implicated in pathophysiological dysfunction associated with the vascular complications of diabetes mellitus, such as retinopathy (3Brownlee M. Annu. Rev. Med. 1995; 46: 223-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar). Diabetic retinopathy remains a leading cause of blindness in the Western countries. Retinopathy is characterized by a progressive alteration of retinal microvasculature, increased vasopermeability, and the pathologic intraocular neovascularization leading to loss of vision (4Miller J.W. Adamis A.P. Aiello L.P. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1997; 13: 37-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that an angiogenic factor released from the retina may stimulate this neovascularization. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is such an angiogenic factor and has been linked to the development of diabetic retinopathy. Indeed, it has been observed that intraocular VEGF levels are increased in diabetic patients and that a correlation exists between the levels of glycated proteins and the development of retinopathy (5Fonseca V.

HIF-1 is a basic-helix-loop-helix transcription factor, which is composed of two subunits, HIF-1α and HIF-1β. HIF-1β, also known as the arylhydrocarbon nuclear translocator, is constitutively expressed, whereas HIF-1α expression is increased upon hypoxia. In the absence of adequate signals (hypoxia or growth factor stimulation), HIF-1α is rapidly ubiquitinated by the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor E3 ligase complex, and subjected to proteasomal degradation (23Jaakkola P.

Several AGE-binding proteins have been identified, including p60 homologous to OST-48, p90 homologous to 80K-H (a protein kinase C substrate), galectin-3, and RAGE (33Vlassara H. Li Y.M. Imani F.

Cell treatment with glycated proteins leads to generation of reactive oxygen species, activation of ERK1/2, and activation of the transcription factor NF-κB (36Yan S.D. Schmidt A.M. Anderson G.M.

The signaling pathways activated by AGEs and implicated in VEGF expression remain to be defined. In this report, we found that AGEs stimulate VEGF mRNA expression through an increase in HIF-1α accumulation and activation of HIF-1. Moreover, AGEs-induced VEGF expression and HIF-1α accumulation are dependent on ERK. Human glycated albumin was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). Each lot was tested for insulin-like growth factor-I contamination by IGF-I-D-RIA-CT (BIOSOURCE Europe, Nivelles, Belgium). cDNA for VEGF 165 was obtained from J.

U0126 was purchased from Promega Inc. (Madison, WI). Culture media were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD). Male OF1 mice (20–22 weeks old) (Iffa-Credo, L'Arbresle, France) were deprived of food for 24 h prior to intraperitoneal injection with insulin (Actrapid Hmge, Novo-Nordisc, Denmark), glycated albumin, or saline. Animals were euthanized by cervical dislocation, and the eyes were removed, weighed, and processed for preparation of total RNA. ARPE-19 cells (Arising Retinal Pigment Epithelia cell line; ATCC no. CRL-2302) were grown in F12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used to extract total cellular RNA from tissues or confluent cells grown in 100-mm tissue culture plates according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were serum-deprived overnight in medium containing 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and cells were pretreated or not with inhibitors for 30 min and stimulated for indicated times. RNA was extracted, and 10 μg of total RNA was denatured in formamide and formaldehyde and separated by electrophoresis in formaldehyde-containing agarose gels. RNA was transferred to Hybond-N membranes (Amersham Biosciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden) and cross-linked to the membrane by UV radiation. Probes were labeled with [γ-32P]dCTP by random priming using the Rediprime kit (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) and purified with the Probequant kit (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Hybridizations were performed at 42 °C in NorthernMax hybridization buffer (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX). Membranes were washed in 1× SSC, 0.5% SDS, and radioactivity was quantitated using a Storm 840 PhosphorImager, Molecular Dynamics. Serum-starved cells were treated with ligands, chilled to 4 °C, and washed with ice-cold phosphate buffer saline (PBS: 140 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 6 mmNa2HPO4, 1 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.4), and solubilized with lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mmNa4P2O7, 100 mm NaF, 2 mm vanadate, 1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonylfluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100) for 20 min at 4 °C. Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred by electroblotting to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond C, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The membranes were soaked first in blocking buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 137 mmNaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) containing 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin or nonfat milk and then soaked in blocking buffer containing antibodies. After washes, proteins were detected using horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Nuclear extracts were prepared as previously described (38Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (2224) Google Scholar). Serum-starved cells were treated with ligands, chilled to 4 °C, and washed with ice-cold PBS. Cells were scraped into 5 ml of PBS and pelleted by centrifugation at 1500 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Cell pellets were washed with four packed cell volumes of buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, supplemented with 2 mm DTT, 0.4 mm PMSF, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm Na3VO4), resuspended in four packed cell volumes of buffer A, and incubated on ice for 10 min. Cells were lysed by 20 strokes in a glass Dounce homogenizer with a type B pestle. Nuclei were pelleted at 3000 rpm for 10 min and resuspended in three packed nuclear volumes of buffer C (0.42 m KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2) supplemented with 2 mmDTT, 0.4 mm PMSF, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mmNa3VO4. Nuclear proteins were extracted by stirring at 4 °C for 30 min. After centrifugation at 13,500 rpm for 30 min, the supernatant was dialyzed against buffer Z-100 (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 2 mm DTT, 0.4 mm PMSF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 100 mm KCl) at 4 °C. The dialysate was clarified by centrifugation at 13,500 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C and designated as crude nuclear extract. The nuclear extracts were aliquoted, frozen in liquid N2, and stored at −80 °C. Protein concentration was determined by a Bio-Rad assay using bovine serum albumin as standard. Sense and antisense oligonucleotides corresponding to the erythropoietin promoter 5′-GATCGCCCTACGTGCTGTCTCA-3′ were used (39Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1230-1237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were annealed, and the double-stranded oligonucleotide (10 pmol) was labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]dATP. The probe was purified with the Probequant kit (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Binding reactions were performed as described previously (38Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (2224) Google Scholar). Reactions contained 10 μg of nuclear extract and 0.1 μg of denatured salmon sperm DNA (Sigma) in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, and 5% (v/v) glycerol. After preincubation for 5 min at room temperature, probe (2.5 × 105 cpm) was added and the incubation was continued for an additional 15 min, after which the reaction mixtures were loaded onto 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Electrophoresis was performed at 185 V in 0.25× TBE (22.25 mm Tris-HCl, 22.25 mm boric acid, and 1.25 mm EDTA) at 4 °C. Gels were vacuum-dried, and radioactivity was determined on a Storm 840. Competitor DNAs were preincubated with nuclear extract and salmon sperm DNA for 5 min prior to addition of labeled probe. To study the regulation of VEGF mRNA expression, mice were injected with saline solution alone (control) or with insulin, albumin (Alb), or glycated albumin (Alb-AGE). After the indicated times, eyes were removed from the animals, and RNA was extracted and analyzed by Northern blotting using a VEGF165 cDNA probe. RNA loading and integrity were verified by a Northern blot using 18 S as a probe, and expression of VEGF mRNA was normalized as the ratio of VEGF mRNA over 18 S (Fig. 1). We observed that both insulin and Alb-AGE induced a 2-fold increase in the level of VEGF mRNA in eyes of mice compared with control injection. Albumin alone had no effect on VEGF expression. Because Lu et al. (29Lu M. Kuroki M. Amano S. Tolentino M. Keough K. Kim I. Bucala R. Adamis A.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1219-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar) have shown that in retina the VEGF mRNA level is increased in the ganglion, inner nuclear layer, the retinal pigment epithelial, and the choroids, we have chosen here to study the effect of AGEs on VEGF mRNA expression in retinal epithelial cells. Human retinal epithelial cells (ARPE-19) were treated for 6 h with Alb-AGE, insulin, or with both molecules, and RNA was extracted. RNA was analyzed by Northern blotting for VEGF mRNA expression (Fig.2 A). As observed, Alb-AGE and insulin induced a 2- and 3-fold increase in VEGF mRNA expression, respectively. Co-treatment with Alb-AGE and insulin had an additive effect, because together they induce a 5-fold increase in VEGF mRNA expression. As shown in Fig. 2 B, we verified that the increase in VEGF mRNA expression was associated to an increase in the protein levels. ARPE-19 cells were treated with Alb-AGE or with insulin, and whole cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting using antibody to VEGF. Both Alb-AGE and insulin stimulated the expression of VEGF isoforms (VEGF121, VEGF165, VEGF189) in ARPE-19 cells. Signaling pathways involved in insulin-induced VEGF expression have been studied (17Miele C. Rochford J.J. Filippa N. Giorgetti-Peraldi S. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21695-21702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In contrast, the regulation of VEGF mRNA expression in response to glycated proteins is poorly documented. For this reason, we have focused our work on the signaling pathways activated by AGEs and implicated in VEGF expression. Because stimulation of cells with Alb-AGE has been shown to produce reactive oxygen species (36Yan S.D. Schmidt A.M. Anderson G.M. Zhang J. Brett J. Zou Y.S. Pinsky D. Stern D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9889-9897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated whether antioxidants modulate Alb-AGE-stimulated VEGF expression. ARPE-19 cells were treated with Alb-AGE in the absence or presence of antioxidants,N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) or pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate (PDTC). RNA was extracted and analyzed by Northern blotting using a VEGF165 cDNA probe. As shown in Fig. 3 A, we observed that the level of VEGF mRNA detected after Alb-AGE treatment is increased by the use of NAC and is not modified by PDTC treatment. The observation that NAC increases VEGF mRNA level could be due to its ability to activate HIF-1 (40Haddad J.J. Olver R.E. Land S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21130-21139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Then, we investigated the role of ERK and PI3K on Alb-AGE-induced VEGF mRNA expression. ARPE-19 cells were treated with Alb-AGE in the absence or presence of specific inhibitors for MEK, U0126, or for PI3K, wortmannin. RNA was extracted and Northern blot analysis was performed using a VEGF165 cDNA probe (Fig. 3 B). Alb-AGE stimulated VEGF mRNA expression in ARPE-19 cells (5-fold increase). Inhibition of MAPK activation by U0126 blocked the Alb-AGE-induced VEGF mRNA expression, whereas inhibition of PI3K by wortmannin did not seem to affect the ability of Alb-AGE to induce VEGF mRNA expression. In conclusion, our data show that Alb-AGE stimulates VEGF expression through an ERK-dependent pathway. We investigated the signaling pathways activated by Alb-AGE. First, we studied the ability of Alb-AGE to activate the MAPK family members, extracellular signal-related kinases (ERK), Jun amino-terminal kinases (JNK), and p38 MAPK. ARPE-19 cells were stimulated with Alb-AGE for 10 or 20 min, and whole cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies to phosphorylated forms of JNK, ERK, or p38 MAPK (Fig.4, A–C). Alb-AGE activated JNK1 and JNK2. Maximal activation of ERK1 and ERK2 by Alb-AGE was reached within 10 min of stimulation. However, we were unable to detect any activation of p38 MAPK after Alb-AGE treatment of ARPE-19 cells. To determine whether Alb-AGE activates the PI3K-dependent cascade, we measured the phosphorylation of a downstream effector of PI3K, PKB (Fig. 4 D). ARPE-19 cells were treated with Alb-AGE or insulin, and whole cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies to PKB phosphorylated on serine residue 473 or to total PKB. We observed that insulin induced a rapid and strong phosphorylation and activation of PKB, whereas no phosphorylation of PKB could be detected after Alb-AGE treatment. Using a PI3K assay, we did not detect activation of PI3K in response to glycated albumin (data not shown). To study whether glycated proteins stimulate VEGF expression through HIF-1 activation, we first investigated whether Alb-AGE induced an accumulation of HIF-1α. ARPE-19 cells were treated with Alb-AGE or with a known inducer of HIF-1α, CoCl2, for 4 h, and cell lysates or nuclear extracts were analyzed by Western blotting using an antibody to HIF-1α (Fig. 5,A and B). Expression of HIF-1α was normalized using a Western blot with antibodies to Shc or to CREB (cAMP-response element-binding protein). Expression of the HIF-1α protein was increased upon Alb-AGE stimulation (2.5-fold) in both total cell lysates and in the nucleus. As expected, CoCl2 treatment of cells led to a greater accumulation of HIF-1α in ARPE-19 cells (10-fold stimulation). Because Alb-AGE was found to stimulate HIF-1α accumulation, we determined whether this accumulation was correlated with an activation of HIF-1 DNA binding activity. ARPE-19 cells were treated in the absence or presence of Alb-AGE, and nuclear extracts were isolated. Double-strand oligonucleotides containing the hypoxia response element site present in erythropoietin promoter were used to measure the ability of HIF-1 to bind to a specific sequence (Fig.5 C). We observed that Alb-AGE induced an increase in the DNA binding activity of HIF-1. This binding is specific, because it is abolished in the presence of an excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides. Because Alb-AGE stimulated VEGF mRNA expression through an ERK-dependent pathway (Fig. 3), we determined whether ERKs are implicated in the induction of HIF-1α in response to AGEs. ARPE-19 cells were pretreated with wortmannin or U0126 and then stimulated with Alb-AGE. Whole cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies to HIF-1α or to Shc (Fig.6). As a positive control, we used CoCl2 to stimulate HIF-1α accumulation. Alb-AGE induced a 3-fold increase in HIF-1α expression, which was not affected by pretreatment with the PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin. Inhibition of ERK activation by U0126 completely inhibited the expression of HIF-1α in response to Alb-AGE. In conclusion, we found that Alb-AGE stimulated HIF-1α expression through an ERK-dependent pathway. In the present study, we showed that Alb-AGE stimulates VEGF mRNA expression in an ERK-dependent pathway. Moreover, Alb-AGE activates the transcription factor, HIF-1. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report showing that AGEs stimulate VEGF expression and HIF-1 DNA binding activity. AGEs stimulate expression of VEGF mRNA and protein in ARPE-19. This is not due to an increase in the stability of the messenger (data not shown) and results from an increase in the transcription of the gene. We found that AGEs stimulate VEGF expression through an ERK-dependent pathway, but not through a PI3K-dependent pathway. Moreover, we have observed that the antioxidant, NAC, did not inhibit VEGF mRNA expression in ARPE-19 but rather increased VEGF mRNA level. It has been reported that NAC appears to increase both the elevation of glutathione and reduction of the oxidized form of glutathione, and then, induces an increase in HIF-1α nuclear abundance and activity (40Haddad J.J. Olver R.E. Land S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21130-21139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). These observations could explain the fact that NAC increases VEGF mRNA level. PDTC, like NAC, induces HIF-1α nuclear translocation but fails to activate DNA binding activity (40Haddad J.J. Olver R.E. Land S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21130-21139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), explaining the observation that PDTC did not modify the level of VEGF mRNA. However, our results are in contrast with a previous report, which shows that antioxidants,N,N′-dimethylthiourea and NAC, inhibit AGEs-induced VEGF mRNA expression in bovine smooth muscle cells (29Lu M. Kuroki M. Amano S. Tolentino M. Keough K. Kim I. Bucala R. Adamis A.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1219-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). We correlated the ability of AGEs to stimulate VEGF expression through an ERK-dependent pathway with their ability to activate MAPK family members. Indeed, in ARPE-19 cells, we found that AGEs activate ERK and JNK but not p38 MAPK. Activation of ERK has been observed in numerous cell types (36Yan S.D. Schmidt A.M. Anderson G.M. Zhang J. Brett J. Zou Y.S. Pinsky D. Stern D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9889-9897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Lander H.M. Tauras J.M. Ogiste J.S. Hori O. Moss R.A. Schmidt A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17810-17814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). However, activation of stress-activated protein kinases (SAPK), JNK and p38, is more controversial. In C6 glioma cells, activation of RAGE, a receptor for AGEs, leads to activation of both JNK and p38 MAPK (41Taguchi A. Blood D.C. del Toro G. Canet A. Lee D.C. Qu W. Tanji N. Lu Y. Lalla E. Fu C. Hofmann M.A. Kislinger T. Ingram M. Lu A. Tanaka H. Hori O. Ogawa S. Stern D.M. Schmidt A.M. Nature. 2000; 405: 354-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar). In contrast, in THP-1 monocytes, AGEs activate only p38 MAPK, without activation of JNK (42Yeh C.H. Sturgis L. Haidacher J. Zhang X.N. Sherwood S.J. Bjercke R.J. Juhasz O. Crow M.T. Tilton R.G. Denner L. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1495-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that activation of MAPKs could be cell-specific. However, SAPK are not involved in the activation of the transcription of VEGF mRNA but in its stability (43Pages G. Berra E. Milanini J. Levy A.P. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26484-26491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). We did not detect activation of PI3K/PKB by AGEs. Such AGEs action has been reported only in Jurkat and in PC12 cells (44Deora A.A. Win T. Vanhaesebroeck B. Lander H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29923-29928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Because AGEs activate neither PI3K nor PKB in ARPE-19 cells, it is possible that PI3K activation is also cell-specific. AGEs stimulate VEGF expression through the accumulation of HIF-1α and the subsequent activation of the transcription factor HIF-1. The induction of HIF-1α by AGEs occurs through an ERK-dependent pathway. This is in agreement with results from Agani and Semenza (45Agani F. Semenza G.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 749-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), who show that ERKs are involved in HIF-1α accumulation in response to mersalyl, an organomercurial compound. ERKs have also been implicated in VEGF expression in response to hypoxia by phosphorylating HIF-1α subunit and then leading to an activation of the transcriptional activity of HIF-1 (24Minet E. Arnould T. Michel G. Roland I. Mottet D. Raes M. Remacle J. Michiels C. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 25Richard D.E. Berra E. Gothie E. Roux D. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32631-32637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). However, HIF-1 expression and activity can be regulated through other mechanisms. Indeed, overexpression of an activated form of PI3K or PKB, or expression of dominant-negative phosphatase and tensin homolog stimulates HIF-1α expression in response to hypoxia and induces angiogenesis (26Jiang B.H. Zheng J.Z. Aoki M. Vogt P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1749-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 27Zundel W. Schindler C. Haas-Kogan D. Koong A. Kaper F. Chen E. Gottschalk A.R. Ryan H.E. Johnson R.S. Jefferson A.B. Stokoe D. Giaccia A.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 391-396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, epidermal growth factor regulates HIF-1α expression through the signaling cascade PI3K/PKB/FRAP (FKBP-rapamycin-associated protein) (28Zhong H. Chiles K. Feldser D. Laughner E. Hanrahan C. Georgescu M.M. Simons J.W. Semenza G.L. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1541-1545PubMed Google Scholar). Additional studies are required to determine whether PI3K- or ERK-dependent signaling pathways modulate the degradation of HIF-1α through the proteasome. Finally, we have observed that, compared with insulin or glycated albumin alone, a co-treatment of ARPE-19 cells with both insulin and glycated albumin has a synergistic action on expression of VEGF mRNA. Insulin induces VEGF expression mainly through a PI3K-dependent pathway (17Miele C. Rochford J.J. Filippa N. Giorgetti-Peraldi S. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21695-21702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Because AGEs stimulate VEGF expression through an ERK-dependent pathway, it is possible that the two polypeptides use distinct signaling pathways, leading to an additive action on VEGF expression. In conclusion, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report showing that AGEs stimulate VEGF expression through an ERK-dependent pathway. Moreover, our results suggest that AGEs-induced expression of VEGF is dependent on the transcription factor HIF-1. Based on these observations, we suggest that blockage of HIF-1 activity by ERK inhibitors could be used as a therapeutic approach to inhibit AGE-induced neovascularization during diabetes. We thank.

https://openalex.org/W2314257098,"The INK4a/ARF locus encodes the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor, p16INK4a and the p53 activator, p14ARF. These two proteins have an independent first exon (exon 1α and exon 1β, respectively) but share exons 2 and 3 and are translated in different reading frames. Germline mutations in this locus are associated with melanoma susceptibility in 20–40% of multiple case melanoma families. Although most of these mutations specifically inactivate p16INK4a, more than 40% of the INK4a/ARF alterations located in exon 2, affect both p16INK4a and p14ARF. We now report a 16 base pair exon 1β germline insertion specifically altering p14ARF, but not p16INK4a, in an individual with multiple primary melanomas. This mutant p14ARF, 60ins16, was restricted to the cytoplasm, did not stabilize p53 and was unable to arrest the growth of a p53 expressing melanoma cell line. This is the first example of an exon 1β mutation that inactivates p14ARF, and thus implicates a role for this tumour suppressor in melanoma predisposition."

These estradiol binding-sites co-purify with 5'-nucleotidase, a plasma membrane-marker enzyme, and are free from major contamination by cytosol or nuclei. Electrophoresis of membrane fractions allowed detection of a primary 67-kDa protein and a secondary 46-kDa protein recognized by estradiol-17beta and by a monoclonal antibody directed to the ligand-binding domain of the nuclear form of estrogen receptor. Estrogen-induced growth of MCF-7 breast cancer cells in vitro was blocked by treatment with the antibody to estrogen receptor and correlated closely with acute hormonal activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and Akt kinase signaling. Estrogen-promoted growth of human breast cancer xenografts in nude mice was also significantly reduced by treatment in vivo with the estrogen receptor antibody. Thus, membrane-associated forms of estrogen receptor may play a role in promoting intracellular signaling for hormone-mediated proliferation and survival of breast cancers and offer a new target for antitumor therapy."

Overexpression of wild-type p53 protein in p53-deficient cells can arrest cell proliferation, reverse a tumorigenic phenotype, and sometimes induce apoptosis or differentiation (1Vogelstein B.

A number of investigators have identified a consensus DNA binding sequence for wild-type p53. El-Deiry et al. (4El-Deiry W.S. Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat.

Although the number of identified p53 target genes keeps growing, it is conceivable that large fraction of the p53 target genes have not yet been identified. The ultimate challenge to p53 biology is to define the complete gene regulatory network. In facing this challenge, the complete human genome “draft” sequence is an invaluable resource (15International Human Genome Sequence Consortium Nature. 2001; 409: 860-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (17821) Google Scholar, 16Venter J.C. et al.Science. 2001; 291: 1304-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (10634) Google Scholar). Knowledge of genes containing p53 consensus binding sequence in the regulatory region will greatly assist the identification of p53 target genes, which could be potential targets for cancer chemotherapeutic drugs. Bioinformatics methods become immediately more useful if they can be integrated with high-throughput gene expression analysis on the same scale. In this report we described analysis of global p53 gene regulatory network through computational methods and genome-wide gene expression analysis. All noncommercial software used in these studies was written in PERL 5.0. The results of subsequent analyses were organized in a relational data base (Sybase, SQL Server Release 11.0, Emeryville, CA, Sybase Inc.). The human lung cancer cell line A549, the human ovarian cancer cell lines PA-1 and 2774, and the human osteogenic sarcoma cell line Saos2, were obtained from American Type Cell Collection (ATCC). The cell line, 2774qw1, was a single clone derived from human ovarian cancer cell line 2774. Culture conditions of all cell lines followed the instruction from ATCC. To introduce exogenous p53, 2774qw1 cells were infected with recombinant adenovirus expressing p53 or adenovirus containing empty vector for 1 h. The recombinant adenovirus was then removed and cells were washed 1–2 times with phosphate-buffered saline (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were then refed with fresh culture medium and cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 2–24 h as indicated. Cells were harvested and total RNA was isolated using a CsCl purification method as described (17Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16654) Google Scholar). Poly(A) selection was carried out using Qiagen Oligotex kit for microarray experiments. The quantitative RT-PCR of 13 genes was performed as described previously (18Wen S.F. Xie L. McDonald M. DiGiacomo R. Chang A. Gurnani M. Shi B. Liu S. Indelicato S.R. Hutchins B. Nielsen L.L. Cancer Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 1469-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The primers and probe specific to 13 genes were designed (see Supplementary Material, Table S1). Human β-glucronidase gene, whose expression was not influenced by p53 across the test samples, was used as an internal positive control to ensure that equivalent amounts of RNA were included in each assay. Approximately 1 × 107 A549, PA-1 and Saos2 cells were treated with 500 nm adriamycin or Me2SO (only for PA-1) for 24 h, respectively. ChIP assays were performed using a modification of a protocol provided by Bruno Amati's laboratory in DNAX (19Frank, S. R., Schroeder, M., Fernandez, P., Taubert, S., and Amati, B. (2001) Genes Dev., in press.Google Scholar). Precleared chromatin was immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal antibody against p53 (Ab-6, Oncogene Research Products), or no antibody added as a negative control. The enrichment of specific DNA fragments was analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR on Taqman (PE 7700) with primers and probes flanking the putative p53-binding sites of each genes. Sequences of primers and probes are available in Supplementary Material, Tables S2 and S3. The RNA purified from 2774qw1 cells infected with rAd-p53 or rAd-control was fluorescent labeled and hybridized on 6 Incyte GeneAlbum GEM microarrays by Incyte Genomics, Inc. The Enrichment Factor (EF) is a parameter that estimates the extent to which genes identified in the p53 Target Data base are overrepresented in pools of genes that show changes in expression in cDNA microarray experiments. We classify genes into three categories: those directly regulated by p53, those not regulated by p53, and those indirectly regulated by p53. The numbers of genes in these categories are indicated by GNR, GD, and GIND, respectively. The ratio between p53 target genes and nontarget genes in the human genome is therefore, T0=GD/(GIND+GNR)Eq. 1 The fraction of p53 target genes included in the p53 Target Data base is defined as p, and the fraction of indirectly regulated and non-p53 regulated genes included in p53 Target Data base is q, such that (p, q < 1). We assume the same value of q for nonregulated and indirectly regulated genes. For the p53 Target Data base then,T1=p·GD/q·(GIND+GNR)=(p/q)[GD/(GIND+GNR)]Eq. 2 EF is then defined as,EF=T1/T0=(p/q)[GD/(GIND+GNR)]/GD/(GIND+GNR)=p/qEq. 3 with a value for EF > 1 indicating bona fideenrichment for p53 target genes in the p53 Target Data base. We can use cDNA microarray to represent a large random subset of the complete genome and use hybridization experiments to determine the p53 responsive genes within the subset. The ratio of p53-responsive genes to p53 nonresponsive genes for such a set of genes is,R0=Rrandom/(Trandom−Rrandom)=(GD+GIND)/GNREq. 4 where Rrandom is the number of p53-responsive genes observed in microarray experiments and Trandom is the total number of genes on the microarrays. Similarly, the ratio of p53-responsive genes to p53 nonresponsive genes for genes in the p53 Target Database that are included on the cDNA microarray,R1=Rtarget/(Ttarget−Rtarget)=(p·GD+q·GIND)/q·GNREq. 5 where Rtarget is the number of p53-responsive genes observed in the microarray experiments that are in the p53 Target Data base and Ttarget is the total number of genes on the microarrays that are in the p53 Target Database. Therefore, the ratio of Equations 4 and 5 is given by,R1/R0=[(p/q)GD+GIND]/(GD+GIND)<p/qEq. 6 Since EF = p/q, EF is always greater than the ratio of R1/R0. Hence, the lower boundary for EF can be calculated by the equation.EF>[Rtarget/(Ttarget−Rtarget)]/[Rrandom/(Trandom−Rrandom)]Eq. 7 To identify potential p53 target genes in human genomic sequences, the “FindPatterns” program (Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package Version 10) was used to search the primate division of GenBankTMRelease 120 (October, 2000) for the p53 consensus sequence, 5′-RRRCWWGYYY (n = 0–13) RRRCWWGYYY-3′ (4El-Deiry W.S. Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar). In this motif, R = G or A, W = T or A, Y = C or T,n = any base. Some p53 target genes (human mdm2, IGFBP3, and gadd45) have functional p53 response elements in their intron regions (5Juven T. Barak Y. Zauberman A. George D.L. Oren M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3411-3416PubMed Google Scholar, 7Hollander M.C. Alamo I. Jackman J. Wang M.G. McBride O.W. Fornace Jr., A.J. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 1997; 14: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The data base search therefore includes intronic sequences. We took advantage of annotated features present in GenBankTM entries to restrict matches to the regulatory region of the genes, which consisted of 6,541 annotated human 5′-flanking sequences and 24,659 annotated human intron sequences. On the basis of the statistics of known p53 target genes (20Bourdon J.-C. Deguin-Chambon V. Lelong J.-C. Dessen P. May P. Debuire B. May E. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), no more than 3 mismatches to the canonical consensus sequence were permitted in the selection. We collected 13 nucleotide sequences known to be functional p53-responsive elements in 10 genes; 23 out of 26 decamers bear a cytosine at position 4, and 25 out of 26 decamers have a guanine at position 7 (Table I). Hence, the sequence matches were further sorted with no mismatch allowed for C at position 4 or G at position 7. Using this approach, we identified 1,121 genes with at least one p53 binding sequence in the region 2,000 base pair upstream of the transcription start site, and 558 genes with at least one p53 binding site within the first 3 introns.Table IPublished p53 DNA binding sequences and the computational search results of known p53 target genesGeneFunctional p53-binding site documented in literature1-aThese are rapidly expanding areas of the investigation and are likely to be incomplete.No. of p53-binding sites found in silicoGenBank™ No.Position1-bThe regulatory region is defined as 5′-flanking region (2 kilobase cutoff) and the first 3 introns.Sequence1-cLowercase letters refer to the insert sequence between two decamers, whose sequence is shown in uppercase letters.Ref.Human baxU17193488 (promoter)TCACAAGTTA g 64 (promoter)AGACAAGCCTHuman proliferating cell nuclear antigenJ056141035 (promoter)ACATATGCCC 82 (promoter)GGACTTGTTCHuman MMP-2U9609811 (promoter)AGACAAGCCT142 (promoter)GAACTTGTCTHuman ACTAJ05193584 (promoter)AACCATGCCT122 (promoter)GCATCTGCCC3 (intron)Human epidermal growth factor receptorJ0320640 (promoter)GAGCTAGACG ttc132 (promoter)GGGCAGCCCC2 (intron)Human mdm2U28935138 (intron 1)GGTCAAGTTC 52 (promoter)176 (intron 1)AGACACGTTC2 (intron)AGTTAAGTCCTGACTTGTCTHuman IGFBP3M358785064 (intron 1)AAACAAGCCA c201 (promoter)5983 (intron 1)CAACATGCTT4 (intron)GGGCAAGACCTGCCAAGCCTHuman gadd45L244983832 (intron 3)GAACATGTCT 71 (promoter)AAGCATGCTGHuman TGF-αAC005234.150848 (promoter)GGGCAGGCCC311 (promoter)TGCCTAGTCT51428 (promoter)AGCCAAGTCTTGGCAAGCGGHuman p21/WAF1U241702303 (promoter)GAACATGTCC 9CAACATGTTC1-a These are rapidly expanding areas of the investigation and are likely to be incomplete.1-b The regulatory region is defined as 5′-flanking region (2 kilobase cutoff) and the first 3 introns.1-c Lowercase letters refer to the insert sequence between two decamers, whose sequence is shown in uppercase letters. Open table in a new tab The efficiency of the computational analysis was evaluated with known p53 target genes (Table I). The p53 response elements of bax, MMP-2, mdm2, IGFBP3, TGF-α, and gadd45 were recognized by this analysis. Additional p53 consensus sequences were found in the promoter or intron regions of these genes. Although they have a nucleotide in the positions 4 or 7 other than C or G in their p53 response elements, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, ACTA, and epidermal growth factor receptor genes were also selected because additional binding sequence matches were found in their regulatory sequences. p21/WAF1 was not selected because its p53 response element is located more than 2 kilobases from its transcriptional start site. This annotation-based approach is limited by the availability of annotated human gene sequences in GenBankTM. To circumvent this shortcoming, a transcript mapping approach was used to locate the promoter sequence on a genomic template. A collection of human mRNA was first extracted from the primate division of GenBankTMflat file (October, Release 120) primate division. The draft human genome sequence was used to identify or to extend the 5′-flanking region of many existing mRNA sequences for which the annotated gene structures are not available or are very short in their respective individual GenBankTM records. To ensure that the 5′ end of an available mRNA is close to the transcription start site, only mRNAs that encode the NH2 terminus of the protein were used for transcript mapping. Both finished and draft human genomic sequences were used as genomic templates. The analysis was done when ∼94% of the human genome was deposited (63% as working draft sequence) into GenBankTM. Within the 22,034 promoters mapped in this way, 4,428 genes were identified that have at least one potential p53-binding site. For a sample of 150 promoters annotated in GenBankTM, 132 (88%) were perfectly predicted by the transcript mapping, suggesting that the transcript mapping procedure could properly predict most promoters. Nevertheless, a small portion of predicted promoters (12%) still differ from GenBankTMannotated promoters. This resulted from either a duplicated copy, a different transcript start site of the annotated gene due to gene duplication, or a 5′ end splice variant. To remove redundancy, we collapsed all candidate genes identified by these two approaches, resulting in 4,852 candidate genes in the p53 Target Database. To assess the validity of the in silico prediction, 13 genes were randomly selected from the p53 Target Database and tested for their p53 responsiveness using real-time quantitative RT-PCR. Total RNA samples were purified from human ovarian cancer cell line, 2774qw1, at various times post-infection with rAd-p53 or rAd-control. As shown in Fig.1, the expression of myogolbin, cardiotrophin-1, catechol o-methyltransferase, IGFBP4, and α1-acid glycoprotein 2 genes was induced very early (2 h post-infection of rAd-p53). In contrast, the activation of carboxyl ester lipase and l-histidine decarboxylase genes were observed relatively late (8 h post-infection). α-Fetoprotein and interleukin 8 receptor α genes were repressed by p53 (Fig.1 A). It is interesting to note that although it has not previously been demonstrated for human α-fetoprotein, expression of the mouse homologue of the α-fetoprotein gene is repressed by p53 through sequence specific DNA binding in the promoter (21Lee K.C. Crowe A.J. Barton M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1279-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). ATP synthase-β and mitochondrial ATP synthase C genes slightly changed at the mRNA level following the expression of p53 (data not shown). It is also interesting to note that α1-acid glycoprotein 2 and complement component C1-inhibitor genes, which only have p53 DNA consensus sequences in their introns, were also activated by p53 (Fig.1), confirming that sequences of introns should be included in searching for p53 DNA binding consensus sequences. The 11 genes shown to respond to p53 at the mRNA level in Fig. 1contain p53-binding sites in their regulatory regions, suggesting that they might be directly bound by p53. To test this, we took advantage of the chromatin immunoprecipitation technique that allows us to study p53 protein-DNA interaction in vivo. Five genes that respond to p53, l-histidine decarboxylase, α1-acid glycoprotein 2, cathechol-o-methyltransferase, myoglobin, and cardiotrophin-1, were evaluated in this way. One or two putative p53-binding sites were selected to design site-specific primers for each gene. A human PA-1 ovarian carcinoma cell line was used because it expresses endogenous functional wild-type p53 (22Yaginuma Y. Westphal H. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 4196-4199PubMed Google Scholar), which is induced by the treatment with the DNA damaging agent adriamycin. Using antibodies against p53, chromatin was immunoprecipitated from PA-1 cells treated with 500 nm adriamycin or Me2SO for 24 h. The ChIP assays showed that genomic fragments containing p53-binding sites for all sites tested were enriched after immunoprecipitation using the p53-specific antibody, and the enrichment after treatment of adriamycin are greater than control samples (Fig.2 A). Negligible quantities of chromatin were recovered when no antibody was used. Similar results were observed with the lung carcinoma cell line, A549, which expresses wild type p53 (Fig. 2 B). Furthermore, only background levels of the promoter fragments were precipitated from a human osteogenic sarcoma cell line, Saos2 (null for p53), in the presence of p53 antibody (Fig. 2 B). Two known p53 target genes, p21/WAF1 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen, were checked for the interactions of p53 with their promoters and were both positive (data not shown). The results demonstrated that endogenous p53 protein interacts directly with predicted p53 binding sequences in these 5 genes, and that in silico prediction can greatly assist us in focusing on regions likely to confer p53-mediated expression. The biological properties of these genes are consistent with the functions that have been attributed to p53, such as, cell cycle checkpoints, apoptosis, inhibition of angiogenesis, and genetic stability (2Somasundaram K. El-Deiry W.S. Front. Biosci. 2000; 5: 424-437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Ferrer F.A. Pantschenko A.G. Miller L.J. Anderson K. Grunnet M. McKenna P.H. Kreutzer D. J.

IGF Res. 1998; 8: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The data suggest that these genes could be mediators of p53 expression through transcriptional regulation. High-density DNA microarrays appear to be the sole approach to study gene expression at the scale comparable to that of the p53 Target Data base. In an attempt to identify p53 target genes on a genomic scale, Incyte GeneAlbum microarrays (∼60,000 cDNAs) were hybridized with the same batch of mRNA used in Taqman analysis described above. 1,501 genes (4.4%) were found to be responsive to p53 using a 2.5-fold change up or down as a cutoff. Approximately 80% of these were repressed by p53. 2S. Liu, manuscript in preparation.Here we focus on the overlap of p53 target genes predicted in silico with those identified by hybridization to microarrays. However, there was no single established method to estimate the significance of an observed degree of in silico prediction. Accordingly, we developed the EF to test the validity of our in silico predictions. T0 is the ratio of genes directly regulated by p53 in human genome to those that are not regulated by p53. T1 is the similar ratio for genes in our p53 Target Database. The EF is defined as the comparison of these ratios (EF =T1/T0), such that an EF > 1 indicates enrichment for genes regulated by p53 in the p53 Target Data- base. Since the actual number of genes in the human genome are not known, we used the genes on the microarrays as a large representative set for this analysis. As described under “Materials and Methods,” the low boundary for the EF can be estimated from the following equation,EF>[Rtarget/(Ttarget−Rtarget)]/[Rrandom/(Trandom−Rrandom)]Eq. EEq._7 where Rtarget is the number of p53-responsive genes observed in the microarray experiments that are in the p53 Target Data base, Ttarget is the total number of genes on the microarrays that are in the p53 Target Data base, Rrandom is the number of p53-responsive genes observed in microarray experiments, and Trandom is the total number of genes on the microarrays. The six Incyte GeneAlbum microarrays used in hybridization represent 33,615 individual genes (Trandom) based on “assembling” of the sequences into gene-based groups. Of 4,852 unique genes in the p53 Target Database, 3,387 of them (Ttarget) are represented on the GeneAlbum microarrays. In the microarray experiments using 2774qw1 ovarian cancer cells infected with rAd-p53, 217 genes (Rrandom) showed activation following p53 expression. Of those, 68 genes (Rtarget) were found to have at least one p53 DNA binding sequence in their regulatory region, and the resulting EF is greater than 3.2. It suggests that the p53 Target Database enriched p53 direct target genes at least 3.2-fold compared with a randomly selected gene pool. We observed that 1,205 genes (Rrandom) are repressed following p53 expression, suggesting that transcriptional repression is also an important mechanism through which p53 exerts its function. Of those, 296 genes (Rtarget) that are represented in the p53 Target Database, and the EF for the repressed genes was estimated to be 2.6. It is well known that p53 mediates transcriptional activation through sequence specific DNA binding (5Juven T. Barak Y. Zauberman A. George D.L. Oren M.

In contrast to transcriptional activation, the molecular basis of transcriptional repression by p53 is poorly understood. This is because most genes that have been reported were repressed by p53 have no classical p53-binding sites in their promoter. In general, genes repressed by p53 can be classified into two types. For the first type of genes, the mechanism is ascribed to sequestration of components of the basal transcription machinery by p53 through protein-protein interactions in the absence of direct DNA binding (26Gopalkirshman R.V.

However, p53 mediated repression of target gene expression by direct DNA binding has been demonstrated in several instances (21Lee K.C. Crowe A.J. Barton M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1279-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 29Budhram-Mahadeo V. Morris P.J. Smith M.D. Midgley C.A. Boxer L.M. Latchman D.S. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 544-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In these cases, p53 binds to the DNA-binding site, which overlaps the binding site of another transactivator protein. The repression by p53 results from displacement of the activator binding. Our data gave higher EFs than background for both activated and repressed genes, indicating that p53-activated genes as well as p53-repressed genes, at least some of them, are directly regulated through p53 specific DNA binding. The EF for p53-repressed genes is lower than that for p53-activated genes, supporting the notion that repression by p53 has multiple mechanisms with or without requirement of sequence specific DNA binding by p53. This could result in “dilution” of overall EF values for repressed genes. Obviously, the complexity of regulation of p53 repressed genes is significant and requires further study. To verify these observations, another data set of microarray experiment, derived from human leiomyosarcoma cell line, SKUT-1, infected with rAd-p53 or rAd-control, 3Y. Wang, manuscript in preparation. was subjected to the EF analysis. Similar trends were observed (data not shown), suggesting that the EF is a valid measure for the selectivity of in silico prediction and is sensitive enough to reflect the specificity of p53-binding sites. In principle, genes directly regulated by p53 should respond to p53 expression more quickly than secondary responsive genes. However, it is difficult to determin"

We show here that TAV function depends on its association with polysomes and eukaryotic initiation factor eIF3 in vitro and in vivo. TAV physically interacts with eIF3 and the 60S ribosomal subunit. Two proteins mediating these interactions were identified: eIF3g and 60S ribosomal protein L24. Transient expression of eIF3g and L24 in plant protoplasts strongly affects TAV-mediated reinitiation activity. We demonstrate that TAV/eIF3/40S and eIF3/TAV/60S ternary complexes form in vitro, and propose that TAV mediates efficient recruitment of eIF3 to polysomes, allowing translation of polycistronic mRNAs by reinitiation, overcoming the normal cell barriers to this process."

Rhombomeres and compartments in the ectoderm and imaginal discs of Drosophila are examples in which initially homogenous populations of cells come to be separated by boundaries of lineage restriction. Boundary formation depends in part on signaling between the distinctly specified cell populations that comprise compartments and in part on formation of affinity boundaries that prevent intermingling of these cell populations. Here, we present evidence that two transmembrane proteins with leucine-rich repeats, known as Capricious and Tartan, contribute to formation of the affinity boundary between dorsal and ventral compartments during Drosophila wing development."

In this study, NR1 and NR2A subunits were altered by mutagenesis and tested for sensitivity to ethanol. Three NR1 mutants (W636A, F817A, and L819A) and one NR2A mutant (F637A) failed to generate functional receptors.

Combinations of NMDA receptor 1 (NR1) and NR2 subunits yield receptors with different biophysical and pharmacological properties such as differences in desensitization and sensitivity to agonists and antagonists. NMDA receptors play an important role in neuronal development and are required for some forms of synaptic plasticity such as associative long-term potentiation that may underlie some forms of learning and memory (1Feldmeyer D.

Despite the wealth of knowledge indicating that the NMDA receptor is an important target for ethanol in the brain, there is no consensus as to how ethanol inhibits receptor function. Ethanol behaves as a noncompetitive and voltage-independent antagonist of the receptor, and attempts to correlate its inhibitory actions with any of the known modulatory sites on the receptor have been largely negative (14Woodward J.J. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 987-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 15Peoples R.W. White G. Lovinger D.M. Weight F.F. Br. J.

In single-channel studies, the inhibitory effects of ethanol were best accounted for by decreases in the mean open time and frequency of channel opening, effects consistent with an allosteric reduction in agonist-induced channel gating (17Wright J.M. Peoples R.W. Weight F.F. Brain Res. 1996; 738: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).Studies with recombinant NMDA receptors have shown that receptors containing NR1/2A or NR1/2B subunits are generally more sensitive to ethanol inhibition than NR1/2C or NR1/2D receptors (16Chu B. Anantharam V. Treistman S.N. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 140-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 18Masood K. Wu C. Brauneis U. Weight F.F. Mol.

In addition, ethanol inhibition of NMDA-induced currents in oocytes expressing NR1, NR2A, and NR2C subunits was less than that observed with NR1 and NR2A receptors, suggesting that subunit composition significantly influences overall ethanol sensitivity (19Mirshahi T. Woodward J.J. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 347-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Recent studies from this laboratory have also shown that ethanol inhibition of NR1/2A receptors expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells is reduced by Fyn tyrosine kinase-mediated phosphorylation of the NR2A subunit as well as by conditions that block calcium-dependent inactivation of NR1/2A receptors (20Anders D.L.

Chem. 2000; 275: 15019-15024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, these manipulations only partially reduce ethanol inhibition of receptor function and C-terminal truncated NMDA subunits retain substantial sensitivity to inhibition by ethanol (21Anders D.L.

Overall, these data suggest that although C-terminal modifications may influence the ethanol sensitivity of the NMDA receptor, it is unlikely that these intracellular domains represent the major site of action for ethanol.Results from recent mutagenesis studies with alcohol- and anesthetic-sensitive γ-aminobutyric acid A (GABAA) and glycine receptors have shown that mutation of a serine residue in the second transmembrane (TM) domain or an alanine residue in the TM3 greatly affected the potentiation of GABAA and glycine channel function by ethanol and volatile anesthetics (24Mihic S.J. Ye Q. Wick M.J. Koltchine V.V. Krasowski M.A. Finn S.E. Mascia M.P. Valenzuela C.F. Hanson K.K. Greenblatt E.P. Harris R.A. Harrison N.L. Nature. 1997; 389: 385-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar). The magnitude of this effect was correlated with the molecular volume of the substituted amino acid, with larger amino acids producing inhibition by ethanol and volatile anesthetics and smaller amino acids producing enhanced potentiation. These results suggested that specific amino acids in these subunits may define an alcohol- and anesthetic-sensitive site (25Koltchine V.V. Finn S.E. Jenkins A. Nikolaeva N. Lin A. Harrison N.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1087-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Although the sequence identity and structural homology between GABAA and glycine receptors and glutamate receptors is extremely low, we hypothesized that NMDA receptors also possess an ethanol-sensitive site that is defined by specific amino acids contained in one or more of the TM domains of the receptor. We reasoned that these amino acids would be relatively large and conserved between various NMDA subunits and not face the pore of the ion channel.In this study, a series of amino acids fitting these criteria were altered by site-directed mutagenesis, and the resulting mutant receptors were tested for their ethanol sensitivity. The results demonstrate that substitution of a single phenylalanine residue in the TM3 domain markedly reduces ethanol inhibition of NMDA receptor currents and that this effect is influenced by amino acid volume. A preliminary report of these findings has been presented in abstract form (26Ronald K.M. Anders D.L. Blevins T. Woodward J.J. Alcohol. Clin. Exp. Res. 2000; 24 (abstr.).: 9Google Scholar).RESULTSFig. 1 shows the sequences of the TM domains of the NR1 and NR2 NMDA receptor subunits.

Residues in the NR1 subunit shown in boldface were mutated to alanine in the present study and tested for ethanol sensitivity. Most of these mutant receptor subtypes gave rise to large NMDA-mediated currents when expressed in Xenopus oocytes (TableI). However, some of the NR1 mutants (W636A, F817A, and L819A) and NR2A mutants (F637A) tested did not yield reproducible currents and were not further investigated. None of the mutants tested appeared to be tonically active in the absence of agonist based on analysis of holding currents at −80 mV. Ethanol inhibition of wild-type NMDA receptors was determined the same day as that of mutant receptors to control for any seasonal variability. These control data were pooled where appropriate to give an average value of ethanol inhibition and are consistent with previously published results using oocytes (19Mirshahi T. Woodward J.J.

Receptors composed of NR1 I546A, L551A, F554A, or F558A plus the NR2A subunit were all inhibited to the same extent by 25–100 mm ethanol (Fig.2 A). The range of ethanol sensitivity among these mutants was not different from that determined for wild-type NR1/2A receptors. Similarly, selected mutations made in either the TM1 (W563A) or TM2 (W611A) domain of the NR1 receptor resulted in functional NMDA receptors that showed normal sensitivity to ethanol (Fig. 3, A andB).Figure 2Ethanol sensitivity of NMDA receptors carrying mutations in the pre-TM1 domain of the NR1 subunit.

This effect was manifested as a rightward and downward shift in the ethanol dose-response curve and persisted over ethanol concentrations from 10 to 200 mm (Fig. 4 B). Concentrations of ethanol >200 mm produced unstable responses in voltage-clamped oocytes and were not tested. Mutation of the nearby methionine (Met641) to alanine did not alter the inhibitory effect of ethanol compared with wild-type receptors (Fig. 4 C). In addition, mutation of NR1(F639A) to the larger tryptophan residue (F639W) produced receptors that were slightly more sensitive to ethanol than wild-type receptors (Fig. 4 D).Figure 4Ethanol inhibition of NMDA receptors carrying mutations in the TM3 domain of the NR1 subunit.

The ethanol sensitivity of both NR1(F639A)/2B and NR1 (F639A)/2C receptors was also significantly less than that determined for their respective wild-type counterparts (Fig. 5, A andB). Expression of NR1(F639A) with NR2A, NR2B, or NR2C subunits in HEK293 cells also significantly reduced the inhibitory effects of 100 mm ethanol compared with wild-type receptors (Fig. 5 C).Figure 5Ethanol inhibition in oocytes or HEK293 cells by various NR2 subunits and the NR1 TM3 mutant NR1(F639A).

In addition, expression of NR1(F639A) with the NR2A subunit did not significantly alter the ability of the physiological agonist glutamate to activate the receptor (Fig. 6 A). However, the F639A substitution in the NR1 subunit shifted the concentration response for glycine to the left of that of the wild-type receptor (Fig. 6 B). Calculated EC50 values for the wild-type (NR1/2A) and mutant (NR1(F639A)/2A) receptors were 0.94 μm (Hill slope, 1.58) and 0.38 μm (Hill slope, 1.40), respectively. This effect of the F639A mutation on glycine potency was even more pronounced in receptors co-expressing NR2B subunits (Fig. 6 C). The glycine EC50 value for wild-type NR1/2B receptors was 0.18 μm (Hill slope, 2.00). When NR1(F639A) was co-expressed with the NR2B subunit, significant receptor activation was observed even in the absence of added glycine. This effect prevented an accurate calculation of the EC50 value for this subunit combination. The activation of NR1(F639A)/2B receptors in solutions lacking added glycine was blocked by the glycine site antagonist 5,7-dichlorokynurenic acid (5,7-DCK; data not shown). The glycine sensitivity of receptors expressing NR1(F639A) and NR2C subunits (EC50, 0.18 μm; Hill slope, 1.44) was not significantly different from wild-type NR1/2C receptors (EC50, 0.31 μm; Hill slope, 1.96; Fig. 6 D).Figure 6Agonist sensitivity of NR1 TM3 mutant NR1(F639A)/2A receptors expressed in oocytes. Shown are dose-response curves for glutamate (A) and glycine (B–D) in oocytes expressing either wild-type NR1/2A or NR1(F639A) plus an NR2 subunit.

Expression of NR1(F639A)/2A receptors shifted the concentration-response curve for 5,7-DCK to the right and increased the IC50 value to 2.37 μm.Figure 7Modulation of wild-type NR1/2A and NR1 TM3 mutant NR1(F639A)/2A receptors by glycine site compounds.

Oocytes expressing either wild-type NR1/2A or NR1(F639A)/2A receptors were stimulated with NMDA (100 μm) and increasing concentrations of (+)-HA-966 in the absence of any added glycine. The currents obtained in the presence of each concentration of (+)-HA-966 were normalized to the current produced in each oocyte by a maximum concentration of NMDA and glycine. In the absence of any added glycine, NMDA application resulted in currents from both wild-type and NR1(F639A)/2A receptors that were ∼5–10% of the response obtained in the presence of saturating concentrations of NMDA and glycine (Fig.7 B). Addition of (+)-HA-966 up to 300 μm to NMDA-containing solutions lacking added glycine did not significantly increase the amplitude of currents from wild-type receptors. In contrast, (+)-HA-966 dose-dependently increased the amplitude of NMDA-stimulated currents in oocytes expressing NR1(F639A)/2A subunits, reaching a maximum of ∼30% at 300 μm.DISCUSSIONThe major goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that the inhibition of NMDA receptor currents by ethanol is mediated via an interaction with one or more amino acids contained within transmembrane domains of the receptor. Because ethanol inhibition of NMDA receptor currents does not resemble that of channel-blocking drugs such as MK801 or ketamine, we initially selected amino acids that were not thought to be pore-facing (29Kuner T. Wollmuth L.P. Karlin A. Seeburg P.H. Sakmann B. Neuron. 1996; 17: 343-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Subsequent cysteine scanning studies revealed that some of the pre-TM1 residues tested (Phe554 and Phe558) were accessible to sulfhydryl-modifying agents, suggesting that the pre-TMI domain contains amino acids that contribute to the outer vestibule of the channel (30Beck C. Wollmuth L.P. Seeburg P.H. Sakmann B. Kuner T. Neuron. 1999; 22: 559-570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The pre-TM1 domain of NR2 subunits also contains amino acids involved in regulating part of the glycine-independent desensitization of the NR2A- and NR2B-containing receptors (31Krupp J.J. Vissel B. Heinemann S.F. Westbrook G.L. Neuron. 1998; 20: 317-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In the present study, none of the NR1 subunit pre-TMI mutants tested modified the NMDA receptor sensitivity to ethanol inhibition. Although it is possible that changes in ethanol sensitivity may have been seen by modifying NR2 residues specifically involved in regulating glycine-independent desensitization, nondesensitizing receptor subtypes (e.g. NR1/2C) are still significantly inhibited by ethanol, suggesting that these amino acids are not likely sites of ethanol interaction.Mutation of Phe639 to alanine in the TM3 domain of the NR1 subunit significantly decreased the ethanol inhibition of NMDA receptors expressed in either oocytes or HEK293 cells. Substitution of the slightly larger tryptophan residue at Phe639 resulted in receptors that were slightly more sensitive to ethanol inhibition than wild-type receptors, suggesting that some physical or chemical property of the amino acid substitution at this position may be an important determinant of ethanol sensitivity.This has been more carefully studied in mutagenesis experiments on GABAA and glycine receptors. In those receptors, residues in TM2 and TM3 have been shown to influence the degree of potentiation of receptor function by ethanol and volatile anesthetics such as isoflurane (24Mihic S.J. Ye Q.

Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1087-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Replacement of the conserved TM2 serine with amino acids of different volumes resulted in receptors that were either potentiated (small amino acids), inhibited (large amino acids), or insensitive to these compounds (25Koltchine V.V. Finn S.E. Jenkins A. Nikolaeva N. Lin A. Harrison N.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1087-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 32Ye Q. Koltchine V.V. Mihic S.J. Mascia M.P. Wick M.J. Finn S.E. Harrison N.L. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3314-3319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Whether these amino acids are involved in defining a binding site or pocket for ethanol or whether they indirectly affect ethanol sensitivity by altering channel gating is unknown. However, replacement of the TM2 serine in GABAAand glycine receptors with amino acids that reduce ethanol potentiation are often associated with a significant leftward shift in the agonist dose-response curves for these receptors. This mutation-induced leftward shift in agonist potency often reduces further potentiation by alcohols and inhaled volatile anesthetics.In the present study, the F639A mutation caused a significant leftward shift in the potency of the receptor for glycine, with less effect on that for glutamate. This was NR2 subunit-dependent and was especially marked for receptors containing the NR2B subunit. The reduction in glycine but not glutamate potency is consistent with previous studies suggesting that NR1 subunits contribute the glycine binding site of the receptor, whereas NR2 subunits provide the glutamate binding site. The leftward shift in the concentration-response curve for glycine may have resulted from a change in the affinity of the NR1 subunit for glycine or in an increase in the efficacy of glycine as a receptor agonist. Results obtained with the glycine site competitive antagonist 5,7-DCK were not conclusive, because the reduced sensitivity of F639A mutant receptors to this antagonist may have resulted from an increase in the binding affinity for glycine. However, for several reasons, it seems unlikely that the effect of the F639A mutation on glycine potency is attributable to a change in glycine affinity. First, amino acids that regulate glycine binding to the NMDA receptor are located in the extracellular S1 and S2 lobes of the NR1 subunit. Most of these map to homologous positions shown by x-ray crystallography to define the glutamate binding site of the GluR2 subunit (33Armstrong N. Sun Y. Chen G.-Q. Gouaux E.

https://openalex.org/W2072339920,"It has recently been shown that the high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) E6 proteins can target the PDZ-domain containing proteins, Dlg, MUPP-1, MAGI-1 and hScrib for proteasome-mediated degradation. However, the E6 proteins from HPV-16 and HPV-18 (the two most common high-risk virus types) differ in their ability to target these proteins in a manner that correlates with their malignant potential. To investigate the underlying mechanisms for this, we have mutated HPV-16 and HPV-18 E6s to give each protein the other's PDZ-binding motif. Analysis of these mutants shows that the greater ability of HPV-18 E6 to bind to these proteins and to target them for degradation is indeed due to a single amino acid difference. Using a number of assays, we show that the E6 proteins interact specifically with only one of the five PDZ domains of MAGI-1, and this is the first interaction described for this particular PDZ domain. We also show that the guanylate kinase homology domain and the regions of MAGI-1 downstream of amino acid 733 are not required for the degradation of MAGI-1. Finally, in a series of comparative analyses, we show that the degradation of MAGI-1 occurs through a different mechanism from that used by the E6 protein to induce the degradation of Dlg and p53."
https://openalex.org/W2314683555,"Recent evidence identified a genetic and functional link between Chk2 kinase and p53 as a candidate genome integrity checkpoint and a tumour suppressor pathway. Here we report that in human cells, Chk2 and p53 form protein-protein complexes whose abundance increased upon DNA damage, and whose formation was abrogated through cancer associated mutations in the FHA domain of Chk2, or mutations in the tetramerization domain of p53. Whereas among Li-Fraumeni syndrome families mutations of Chk2 or p53 occur in a mutually exclusive manner, we document that the colon cancer cell line HCT-15 concomitantly lacks functions of both Chk2 and p53, the latter demonstrated by a non-invasive reporter assay monitoring p53-dependent transactivation in live cells. Despite the preserved ability of common cancer-derived mutant p53 proteins to bind and potentially 'titrate' activated Chk2, the integrity of the S phase checkpoint response to ionizing radiation remained largely intact and dependent on Chk2 in cells with wild-type, mutant, or no p53. These results provide new mechanistic insights into the Chk2-p53 interplay, suggest how mutations in Chk2 may abrogate its tumour suppressor function, and indicate that compared with individual defects in either Chk2 or p53, concomitant mutations in both of these cell cycle checkpoint regulators may provide some additional selective advantage to tumour cells."

CS-A and DS (625 nmol as galactosamine) were digested with chondroitinase ACII and chondroitinase ABC, respectively. The digested materials (25 nmol as galactosamine for determination of ΔDi-4S and 500 nmol for determination of GalNAc(4SO4)) were subjected to SAX-HPLC together with Na235SO4as an internal standard. GalNAc(4SO4) and ΔDi-4S were monitored by absorption at 210 nm (Fig. 5). At 210 nm, the observed ratio of (molecular absorption of monosaccharides)/(molecular absorption of unsaturated disaccharides) was 0.32 (29Ito Y. Habuchi O. J. Biol.

A portion of the purified GalNAc4S-6ST (10 μg as protein) was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10% gel) according to the method of Laemmli (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) after reduction and denaturation in loading buffer containing 5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol. The polyacrylamide gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and the band of the 63-kDa protein was excised. The excised gel containing the protein was sent to Apro Science Co. Ltd. (Naruto, Japan) for the amino-terminal amino acid sequencing of peptides separated by reverse phase HPLC after limited digestion of the protein with proteinase Lys-C. Squid cranial cartilage was dissected, freed of soft tissues by wiping with cotton cloth, and put into liquid nitrogen. The frozen cartilage was ground to powder in a mortar in the presence of liquid nitrogen. The cartilage powder was placed in 10 volumes of an ice-cold guanidine thiocyanate solution and homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 30 min. The clear supernatant fraction was used for isolation of total RNA by the guanidine thiocyanate/CsCl methods (36Kingston R.E. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A.

Degenerate oligonucleotide primers were designed as indicated in Fig.1 A. Two sense primers (5s-1 and 5s-2) and two antisense primers (4a-1 and 4a-2) were prepared from the amino acid sequences of peptide 5 and peptide 4, respectively. The first strand of cDNA was synthesized by the reverse transcriptase reaction using poly(A)+ RNA from the squid cartilage as a template and oligo(dT) or random oligonucleotide as a primer. The reverse transcriptase reaction mixture contained, in a final volume of 20 μl, 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA, 0.5 μg of oligo(dT) or random primers, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm each of four deoxynucleoside triphosphates, 30 units of RNase inhibitor (Takara), and 400 units of reverse transcriptase (Superscript II, Life Technologies, Inc.). The reaction was carried out at 42 °C for 50 min. After the reaction was stopped by heating at 70 °C for 15 min, 0.5 unit of RNase H (Life Technologies, Inc.) was added and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. The PCR reaction was carried out in a final volume of 25 μl containing 25 pmol each of the oligonucleotide primers (5s-1 and 4a-2), 1 μl of the reverse transcriptase reaction mixture in which the first strand cDNA was synthesized, 0.2 mm each of four deoxynucleoside triphosphates, and 1.5 units of Taq polymerase (Qiagen). Amplification was carried out by 40 cycles of 94 °C for 45 s, x °C for 1.5 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. The annealing temperature (x °C) was decreased from 48 °C to 32 °C by 4 °C/3 cycles, and retained at 28 °C for an additional 25 cycles. The second PCR was carried out using the reaction mixture of the first PCR as a template and oligonucleotide primer 5s-2 and 4a-1 under the same reaction conditions as the first PCR. Reaction products of the second PCR were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig.1 B, lane 1). The amplified DNA band (indicated by an arrowhead in Fig. 1 B) was cut out, and the DNA fragment was recovered from the gel, and cycle sequenced using primer 5s-2 and 4a-1 as sequence primers. The nucleotide sequence was determined by the dideoxy chain termination method using a DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems model 373A). To construct the plasmid containing the human GalNAc4S-6ST cDNA named pcDNAGalNAc4S-6ST, the pBluescript II plasmid containing the human GalNAc4S-6ST cDNA (accession no. AB011170, gene no. KIAA 0598), which was a generous gift from Kazusa DNA Research Institute (Kisarazu, Japan), was cut with EcoRI and the fragment with 2258 nucleotides was ligated into EcoRI site of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). COS-7 cells were transfected with pcDNAGalNAc4S-6ST using the DEAE-dextran method as described previously (37Aruffo A. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K.

After transfection, the cells were extracted with 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 20% glycerol for 30 min on a rotatory shaker. The extracts were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The sulfotransferase activities in the supernatant fractions were measured using CS-A or the 4-sulfated trisaccharide as acceptors. Recombinant GalNAc4S-6ST was expressed as a fusion protein with FLAG peptide and was affinity-purified. A DNA fragment that codes for full open reading frame was amplified by PCR using the human GalNAc4S-6ST cDNA (accession no. AB011170) as a template. The 5′ and 3′ primers were CGCAAGCTTATGAGGCACTGCATTAATTGCTGC and CAGGAATTCTCACGTCGTCTTCCACGCAAAC, respectively. At the 5′ end of the oligonucleotide primers, restriction enzyme recognition sites were introduced: HindIII site for the sense primer and EcoRI site for the antisense primer. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and HindIII and subcloned into these sites of pFLAG-CMV-2 plasmid (Eastman Kodak Co.). The resulting plasmid was transfected in COS-7 cells, and the fusion protein produced was extracted as described above. The cellular extracts from 10 10-cm dishes were applied to an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody-conjugated agarose column (0.5 ml) (Sigma). The absorbed materials were eluted with 1.5 ml of a buffer containing FLAG peptide under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer. GalNAc4S-6ST activity was assayed by the method described previously (29Ito Y. Habuchi O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34728-34736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) with a slight modification. The standard reaction mixture contained, in a final volume of 50 μl, 2.5 μmol of imidazole-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.5 μmol of CaCl2, 1 μmol of reduced glutathione, 25 nmol (as galactosamine) of CS-A, 50 pmol of [35S]PAPS (about 5.0 × 105 cpm), and enzyme. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min, and the reaction was stopped by immersing the reaction tubes in a boiling water bath for 1 min. After the reaction was stopped, 35S-labeled glycosaminoglycans were isolated by the precipitation with ethanol followed by gel chromatography with a fast desalting column as described previously (39Habuchi O. Matsui Y. Kotoya Y. Aoyama Y. Yasuda Y. Noda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21968-21974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and radioactivity was determined. For determining the activity toward various glycosaminoglycans, CS-A was replaced with 25 nmol (as galactosamine for CS-C, DS, 4-sulfated oligosaccharides, and nonsulfated oligosaccharides; or glucosamine for heparan sulfate, CDSNS-heparin, and keratan sulfate) of glycosaminoglycans or oligosaccharides. For determining the position of sulfate transferred to CS-A and DS, 35S-labeled glycosaminoglycans were digested with chondroitinase ACII, chondroitinase ABC, chondroitinase ACII plus chondro-6-sulfatase, or chondroitinase ABC plus chondro-6-sulfatase as described previously (29Ito Y. Habuchi O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34728-34736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The radioactive products formed after the enzymatic digestion were separated with HPLC using a Whatman Partisil-10 SAX column as described below, and35S radioactivity was determined. When oligosaccharides were used as acceptors, the reaction mixtures were applied directly to the Superdex 30 column as described below and the35S-labeled oligosaccharides were separated from35SO4 and [35S]PAPS. A Superdex 30 16/60 column was equilibrated with 0.2 mNH4HCO3, and run at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. One-ml fractions were collected. Separation of the degradation products formed from 35S-labeled glycosaminoglycans and35S-labeled oligosaccharides were carried out by HPLC using a Whatman Partisil-10 SAX column (4.6 mm × 25 cm) equilibrated with 10 mm KH2PO4. The column was developed with 10 mm KH2PO4 for 10 min, followed by a linear gradient from 10 to 450 mmKH2PO4 as indicated in Fig. 4. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected at a flow rate of 1 ml/min and a column temperature of 40 °C. We obtained amino acid sequences of five peptides from the purified squid GalNAc4S-6ST (TableI). When primer 5s-1 and 4a-2 (for the nucleotide sequences of the primers, see Fig.1 A) designed from the amino acid sequences of peptides 5 and 4, respectively, were used in a PCR with poly(A)+ RNA from squid cartilage as a template, no amplification of DNA was observed (data not shown); however, a DNA fragment of about 380 base pairs was clearly amplified on the second PCR, in which the reaction mixture of the first PCR was used as a template and oligonucleotide 5s-2 and 4a-1 were used as primers (Fig.1 B, lane 1). When the amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the amplified DNA was used for FASTA search, we found a human cDNA clone (accession no. AB011170) located to chromosome 10 that showed significant homology to the squid DNA. Comparison of the sequence of the human cDNA clone with the amplified squid DNA revealed ∼40% identity and ∼61% similarity at the amino acid level (Fig. 2). This clone contained an open reading frame that predicts a protein composed of 561 amino acids. Examining the amino acid sequence of this protein revealed the presence of a transmembrane domain of type II topology and putative PAPS binding domains (5′-PSB and 3′-PB) (Fig. 2), suggesting that this cDNA may encode a novel sulfotransferase. In addition, the four of five peptides derived from the purified squid GalNAc4S-6ST nearly matched the human protein (Fig. 2). Taken together, the results indicated that the protein deduced from the human cDNA may be a human counterpart for the purified squid GalNAc4S-6ST. We also found another human clone (accession no. AF026477) whose nucleotide sequence is nearly identical to the human cDNA with accession no. AB011170. The cDNA with accession no. AF026477 was reported as human B cell RAG-associated gene (hBRAG) (30Verkoczy L. Marsden P.A. Berinstein N.L. Eur. J.

KIAA 0598) (40Nagase T. Ishikawa K. Miyajima N. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Nomura N. Ohara O. DNA Res. 1998; 5: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), which had been found in the GenBank™ data base by FASTA search, was a generously gift from the Kazusa DNA Research Institute (Kisarazu, Japan). We confirmed that the nucleotide sequence of the open reading frame of this cDNA was strictly the same as the sequence that appeared in the data base. Evidence that the human cDNA encodes a novel sulfotransferase was obtained by expressing it in COS-7 cells. COS-7 cells were transfected with the pcDNAGalNAc4S-6ST, a recombinant plasmid containing the cDNA in a mammalian expression vector, pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The transfected cells were scraped at 67 h after transfection, extracted with gentle shaking in a buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100, and centrifuged. The sulfotransferase activities in the supernatant fractions were determined using CS-A or a trisaccharide having sulfate groups at position 4 of GalNAc residues as acceptors. As shown in Fig. 3, when the plasmid containing the human cDNA was used, the sulfotransferase activity toward the 4-sulfated trisaccharide was increased more than 5-fold over the control, although the sulfotransferase activity toward CS-A was increased only 2-fold. We hypothesized that this sulfotransferase might transfer sulfate predominantly to the nonreducing terminal sugar residue, because the 4-sulfated trisaccharide was a better acceptor than CS-A. To determine the substrate specificity of the expressed enzyme, we prepared the affinity-purified protein from the extracts of COS-7 cells transfected with pFLAGGalNAc4S-6ST and the sulfotransferase activity was determined using various acceptors. In Table II, the sulfotransferase activity toward various glycosaminoglycans and oligosaccharides is shown. Among glycosaminoglycans, CS-A and DS were able to serve as acceptors. Chondroitin was a poor acceptor. CS-C, CS-E, keratan sulfate, heparan sulfate, and CDSNS-heparin hardly served as acceptors. Sulfation of oligosaccharides having GalNAc(4SO4) residue at the nonreducing end (4-sulfated trisaccharide and 4-sulfated pentasaccharide) proceeded at much higher rates than the sulfation of CS-A. In contrast, the nonsulfated trisaccharide and nonsulfated pentasaccharide did not serve as acceptors at all.Table IIAcceptor substrate specificity of the affinity-purified human GalNAc4S-6STAcceptorsSulfotransferase activitypmol/min/mlCS-A33.7CS-C0.5CS-E0.5DS4.9Chondroitin2.5Keratan sulfate0.3Heparan sulfate0.0CDSNS-heparin0.04-Sulfated trisaccharide95.24-Sulfated pentasaccharide99.9Nonsulfated trisaccharide0.0Nonsulfated pentasaccharide0.0COS-7 cells were transfected with pFLAGGalNAc4S-6ST or vector alone, and the affinity-purified protein was prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Sulfotransferase activities were assayed using various glycosaminoglycans and oligosaccharides as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The activity of the affinity-purified fraction obtained from COS-7 cells transfected with the vector alone was less than 0.6 pmol/min/ml for any acceptor used and was subtracted from the individual activity.

https://openalex.org/W2047132622,"To maintain various T cell responses and immune equilibrium, activation signals triggered by T cell antigen receptor (TCR) must be regulated by inhibitory signals. Gab2, an adaptor protein of the insulin receptor substrate-1 family, has been shown to be involved in the downstream signaling from cytokine receptors. We investigated the functional role of Gab2 in TCR-mediated signal transduction. Gab2 was phosphorylated by ZAP-70 and co-precipitated with phosphoproteins, such as ZAP-70, LAT, and CD3ζ, upon TCR stimulation. Overexpression of Gab2 in Jurkat cells or antigen-specific T cell hybridomas resulted in the inhibition of NF-AT activation, interleukin-2 production, and tyrosine phosphorylation. The structure-function relationship of Gab2 was analyzed by mutants of Gab2. The Gab2 mutants lacking SHP-2-binding sites mostly abrogated the inhibitory activity of Gab2, but its inhibitory function was restored by fusing to active SHP-2 as a chimeric protein. A mutant with defective phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase binding capacity also impaired the inhibitory activity, and the pleckstrin homology domain-deletion mutant revealed a crucial function of the pleckstrin homology domain for localization to the plasma membrane. These results suggest that Gab2 is a substrate of ZAP-70 and functions as a switch molecule toward inhibition of TCR signal transduction by mediating the recruitment of inhibitory molecules to the TCR signaling complex."

We developed a method for sequential chromatin immunoprecipitation of distinct nuclear proteins that are simultaneously cross-linked to nucleosome-sized genomic DNA segments. We find that core histone H2A co-occupies, along with the FoxA (hepatocyte nuclear factor-3) transcription factor, DNA for the albumin transcriptional enhancer in native liver chromatin, where the enhancer is active. Because histone H2A on nuclear DNA is only known to exist in nucleosomes, we conclude that transcription factors can form a stable complex on nucleosomes at an active enhancer element in vivo.

Mäder A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (6725) Google Scholar). Specifically, the DNA is bent and in some places kinked on the nucleosome (2Richmond T.J. Finch J.T. Rushton B. Rhodes D. Klug A. Nature. 1984; 311: 532-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar, 3Hogan M.E. Rooney T.F. Austin R.H. Nature. 1987; 328: 554-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar); histone binding occludes part of the DNA surface; and the nearly two wraps of DNA around the histone octamer place the double helices in close proximity. Although much research has focused on the ways that these parameters are inhibitory to transcription factor binding, DNA bending and interactions with histones could promote certain factors to bind nucleosomes, and DNA wrapping can bring cooperative sites together. Furthermore, targeting of chromatin-modifying complexes and other gene regulatory proteins (4Workman J.L. Kingston R.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 545-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar, 5Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6448) Google Scholar) to inactive, closed chromatin domains would appear to require prior site-specific DNA binding by factors that are not inhibited by nucleosome structure. We recently found that the FoxA (HNF3)1 transcription factor, one of the first factors to bind the albumin gene in development (6Gualdi R. Bossard P. Zheng M. Hamada Y. Coleman J.R. Zaret K.S. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1670-1682Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar), can bind its sites on nucleosomal DNA in vitro, regardless of histone acetylation state (7Cirillo L.A. Zaret K.S. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 961-969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). However, whether factors such as FoxA can bind to nucleosomes in vivo is not clear and is the subject of this paper. If initial DNA binding factors are not inhibited by nucleosomes, might such factor-bound nucleosomes persist as parts of active gene regulatory complexes? Consistent with this idea, a variety of transcriptional enhancers have been found to exist in a short array of nucleosome-like particles in the cell types in which the enhancers are active (8Richard-Foy H. Hager G.L. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2321-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 9Verdin E. Paras Jr., P. Van Lint C.

Bonifer C. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 236: 63-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), including the albumin gene enhancer (14McPherson C.E. Shim E.-Y. Friedman D.S. Zaret K.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 387-398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Also, there are now many examples of chromatin immunoprecipitation data indicating that acetylated core histone proteins are in the vicinity of regulatory sequences to which transcription factors are bound. Furthermore, genome-wide studies in yeast showed that depletion of core histone proteins causes a decrease in expression of a significant fraction of genes (15Wyrick J.J. Holstege F.C. Jennings E.G. Causton H.C. Shore D. Grunstein M. Lander E.S. Young R.A. Nature. 1999; 402: 418-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), indicating that histones could contribute positively to their expression. In all such instances in which nucleosomes are not inhibitory to factor binding in vitro, in which nucleosomes may be positive for enhancer function, or in which histones are in the vicinity of chromatin-bound factors, it has not been determined whether transcription factors can stably co-occupy their target sites with core histone proteins in the native chromatin of a cell. Specifically, the existing models are drawn from nuclease cleavage patterns that resemble nucleosome ladders but that might reflect “enhanceosome” complexes consisting solely of transcription factors bound to DNA (16Giese K. Kingsley C. Kirshner J.R. Grosschedl R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 995-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 17Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 83: 1091-1100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). A significant prior study revealed a depletion of linker histone H1 but not of core histone H2B, during glucocorticoid receptor binding to mouse mammary tumor virus nucleosomes in cells (18Bresnick E.H. Bustin M. Marsaud V. Richard-Foy H. Hager G.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 273-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). However, these and other chromatin immunoprecipitation data could reflect transcription factors and histones being bound to DNA in separate subpopulations of cells. In this paper, we asked whether, in native chromatin, transcription factors and core histone proteins could be bound simultaneously to the same underlying DNA segment. Our approach has been to perform sequential immunoprecipitations of proteins bound to the serum albumin gene enhancer in the native chromatin of liver cells, focusing on the FoxA (HNF3) transcription factor. In vivo footprinting studies have shown that in mouse liver, where virtually all hepatocytes express the albumin gene, FoxA binding sites that are essential for enhancer activity are occupied by protein (6Gualdi R. Bossard P. Zheng M. Hamada Y. Coleman J.R. Zaret K.S. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1670-1682Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 14McPherson C.E. Shim E.-Y. Friedman D.S. Zaret K.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 387-398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The extent of footprint protection indicates that the FoxA sites are occupied in the majority of hepatocytes that populate the liver. The N1 nucleosome-like particles at the albumin enhancer, observed by micrococcal nuclease digestion of liver nuclei, is positioned over the FoxA binding sites and is DNase I-hypersensitive. In contrast, in nonliver tissues, where the FoxA sites are not occupied, nucleosome-like particles are not precisely positioned over the enhancer, and the enhancer is not hypersensitive (14McPherson C.E. Shim E.-Y. Friedman D.S. Zaret K.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 387-398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Although the albumin enhancer and the albumin promoter are separated by 10 kb, these elements are simultaneously DNase I-hypersensitive on individual albumin genes in liver nuclei, suggesting that most of the factor-bound enhancers are active (19Liu J.-K. Bergman Y. Zaret K.S. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 528-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In addition, purified FoxA protein in vitro binds to its sites on nucleosomes with a lower off rate than on free DNA (7Cirillo L.A. Zaret K.S. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 961-969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Herein, we used several approaches to show that the high percentage of occupancy of FoxA factors on active, nucleosome-like enhancer complexes in liver nuclei reflects co-occupancy with core histone proteins. The results indicate that nucleosomes can serve as positive architectural components of gene regulatory complexes. Liver nuclei were isolated essentially as described by Kornberg et al. (20Kornberg R.D. LaPointe J.W. Lorch Y. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Nuclear pellets were resuspended in Kornberg buffer C, warmed to 37 °C for 60 s, and then digested with added MNase for an additional 60 s. Reactions were adjusted to 25 mm EDTA and placed on ice. Aliquots of chromatin were removed for analysis of bulk digestion and indirect end label analysis by Southern blotting (19Liu J.-K. Bergman Y. Zaret K.S. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 528-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The remaining chromatin was gently rocked at 4 °C for 5 min and spun at 15,600 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant containing solubilized nucleosomes was removed and saved. To isolate DNA, aliquots of bulk and solubilized chromatin were incubated in 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, and 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K at 37 °C for 18–24 h, extracted once with phenol-chloroform and twice with chloroform alone, ethanol-precipitated, and resuspended in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 1 mm EDTA. For Southern blot analysis of solubilized nucleosomes, 1.6 μg of DNA/lane was electrophoresed on a 1.6% agarose gel, transferred to Duralon membranes (Stratagene), and UV cross-linked. Dot blots with 1–100 pg of albumin enhancer-containing plasmid on a separate membrane were included in the hybridizations as an internal control to measure the efficiency of hybridization of the different oligonucleotides. Oligonucleotide probes corresponded to the N1 particle at the eG HNF3 site (oligo B), the upstream linker region (oligo A), and the downstream linker region (oligo C), where the linker and N1 particle regions were defined by the LM-PCR analysis of McPhersonet al. (14McPherson C.E. Shim E.-Y. Friedman D.S. Zaret K.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 387-398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Blots were analyzed with a Fuji BAS phosphorimager and autoradiography. C3H male mice were killed by vertebral dislocation, and their abdominal cavities were exposed on a heat block set to 30 °C. The anterior vena cava was ligated; a catheter needle was inserted into the posterior vena cava; and the portal vein was cut. Livers were retrograde-perfused with 10 ml of PBS with 50 mg/ml heparin (30 °C), causing blanching, followed by 5 ml of PBS with 1% formaldehyde (Fisher Scientific) at 30 °C. Fixation proceeded for 5 min, and then the livers were dissected from the animal and incubated another 5 min in a 30 °C oven. The reactions were stopped by placing the liver on ice in 10 ml of buffer A (15 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 60 mm KCl, 15 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, pH 8, 0.5 mmEGTA, pH 8, 0.34 m sucrose, 0.15 mm2-mercaptoethanol, and 125 mm glycine) and mincing with small scissors. Crude nuclei were prepared by Dounce homogenization and centrifugation steps in an SS-34 fixed angle rotor (Sorvall) at 10,000 rpm for 10 min and 5000 rpm for 10 min on 1.5-ml cushions of 1:1 buffer A:buffer B (15 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 60 mmKCl, 15 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8, 0.1 mm EGTA, pH 8, 2.1 m sucrose, and 0.15 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). Nuclei were resuspended in 5 ml of sonication buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8, 0.5% N-lauroylsarcosine, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, trypsin inhibitor, and antipain), incubated 5 min at room temperature, 5 min on ice, and sonicated with a Branson 250 sonifier mounted with a microtip for two 30-s pulses (duty cycle constant; output, 20%). Cross-linked chromatin was purified on a CsCl step gradient (1 ml of 1.75 g/ml, 1 ml of 1.5 g/ml, and 1 ml of 1.35 g/ml CsCl in 0.5%N-lauroylsarcosine and 1 mm EDTA, pH 8) in a Beckman SW50 rotor for 20 h at 31,000 rpm at 20 °C (21Cohen-Kaminsky S.

Peak DNA-containing fractions, identified by agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining, were pooled, treated with 25 ng/ml RNase A for 20 min at 37 °C, and then dialyzed against Tris-EDTA (10 mm Tris, pH 8, and 1 mm EDTA). The purified, cross-linked chromatin was aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. The immunoprecipitation of the chromatin procedure was adapted from existing protocols for mammalian cells by Orlando et al.

Cross-linked chromatin was digested with MnlI for 3 h at 37 °C and dialyzed overnight in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Igepal, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, and 0.1% SDS). After a preclearing step with rabbit serum or immunoglobulins and protein A-Sepharose (Sigma; P-3391), 100 μg of purified chromatin was incubated overnight at 4 °C, rotating with 200 μg of rabbit antiserum against HNF3α or the control preimmune serum (24Stevens K. Cirillo L. Zaret K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30471-30477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), 300 μg of rabbit antiserum against histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 (25Bustin M.

Protein A beads were blocked before use by incubating overnight at 4 °C in 1:1 radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer with 100 μg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA. We added 40–50 μl of blocked protein A-Sepharose beads to the chromatin and incubated 2 h at 4 °C while rotating. Bound material was recovered by centrifugation at 2500 rpm for 1 min, and the immunoprecipitated products were washed four times with 400–500 μl of radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer containing 500 mm NaCl. We then added 100 μl of Tris-EDTA, and cross-linking was reversed by incubating at 68 °C for 3 h. To analyze the DNA, the material was treated with proteinase K, extracted with phenol:chloroform, and ethanol-precipitated in the presence of 10 μg of glycogen as carrier. The final immunoprecipitated DNA products were resuspended in 30 μl of Tris-EDTA for PCR analysis. Each PCR amplification was performed using 110 of the immunoprecipitated DNA products in a final volume of 50 μl. PCR reactions contained a 2 ng/μl concentration of each primer, 1 ng of 32P end-labeled primer, a 0.25 ng/μl concentration of each dNTP, 3 mm MgCl2, 4% Me2SO, 1× PCR buffer (Perkin-Elmer), and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase. PCR conditions for all primers were initial denaturation at 94 °C for 4 min; 26, 29, and 32 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 90 s, and 72 °C for 45 s; and final elongation at 72 °C for 5 min. Amplification products were analyzed on 6% polyacrylamide gels, which were dried and exposed to Eastman Kodak Co. XAR film. Signals were quantitated with a Fuji BAS phosphoimager. PCR reactions used the following primers: N1 particle (161 bp), 206 (5′-CGAGATGGTACTTTGTGTCTCCTGC-3′) and 276+ (5′-GGCAGAGGACTGTATTGATCAG-3′); and N2 particle (66 bp), 596 (5′-TCTGCAAGCATAGCACAGAGCA-3′) and 597 (5′-GGCTGTGAGGATACAAGAAAATGAA-3′). Partially sonicated, cross-link-reversed genomic DNA (25 μg) was digested with MnlI and electrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose gel. The gel was depurinated for 10 min in 0.25n HCl, denatured for 20 min in 1.5 m NaCl and 0.5 m NaOH, and neutralized for 10 min in 1.5 mNaCl and 0.5 m Tris, pH 7. Samples were transferred onto a nylon membrane (Duralon-UV; Stratagene) with 20× SSC (3 mNaCl and 0.3 m sodium citrate, pH 7) by capillary transfer and UV cross-linked with a Stratalinker (Stratagene). The blot was prehybridized for 4 h at 65 °C in 10 ml of hybridization buffer (5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, 1% SDS, and 0.1 μg/ml denatured sonicated salmon sperm) and hybridized overnight at 65 °C in 5 ml of hybridization buffer containing 5 × 106 cpm of N1 sequence probe. Probes were internally labeled with α-32P by PCR using primers described above and plasmid DNA templates, purified on agarose gels, and denatured at 95 °C for 5 min before use. Blots were washed with 0.2× SSC and 0.1% SDS twice for 15 min at 65 °C and exposed to Kodak XAR film for 10 days with intensifying screens. Mouse Foxa1 (HNF3α) full-length protein was generated by in vitro transcription from plasmid pET28b-mHNF3α (26Cirillo L.A. McPherson C.E. Bossard P. Stevens K. Cherian S. Shim E.-Y. Clark E.A. Burley S.K. Zaret K.S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 244-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) followed by in vitro translation with35S, using rabbit reticulocyte lysates (27Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999Google Scholar). We first sought to determine whether in liver nuclei, the N1 particles positioned at the albumin enhancer share biochemical solubility properties of nucleosomes. Southern blotting was used to assess the nucleosomal phasing pattern over the albumin enhancer in liver chromatin digested with a low concentration of MNase. Under conditions in which ∼50% of the albumin genes in the nuclear population remain undigested, an indirect end label probe shows that MNase discretely cleaves the boundaries of the ∼180-bp N1 region of the enhancer sequence (N1; Fig. 1 A, lane 2). The N1 sequence spans FoxA binding sites for the albumin enhancer (Fig. 1 D). We next determined whether much higher concentrations of MNase would release the N1 particle and solubilize it as a mononucleosome. Liver nuclei were digested so that the majority of chromatin was in fragments of one to seven nucleosomes in length (Fig.1 B, lanes 3–5). The digested liver nuclei were pelleted, and the solubilized material in the supernatant was analyzed. Under these conditions, the supernatant contains solubilized mononucleosomes, as seen by the MNase-dependent appearance of ∼150-bp fragments of DNA (Fig. 1 B, lanes 7–9) and all four core histone proteins (Fig. 1 C, lanes 2–5). There was essentially no endogenous nuclease activity (Fig. 1, B, lanes 2 and 6, and C, lane 2). Three sets of DNA from solubilized nucleosomes were run on an agarose gel (Fig. 1 E, bottom panel) and blotted to a nylon filter. The filter was cut into three strips, and each was hybridized to an oligonucleotide probe for either the middle of the N1 region (Fig.1 D, probe B) or the expected linker regions flanking N1 (Fig. 1 D, probes A and C). As seen in Fig. 1 E, top panel, sequences hybridizing to the N1 probe B exhibited strong enrichment in the nucleosome fraction, whereas sequences hybridizing to probes A andC were under-represented. As described under “Experimental Procedures,” we controlled for probe hybridization efficiency. We conclude that albumin enhancer sequences spanning the N1 region are in a nucleosome-like conformation in liver chromatin. To avoid potential artifacts of chromatin rearrangement that might occur during the isolation of nuclei (28Pfeifer G. Riggs A.D. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1102-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), we performed chromatin cross-linking in intact liver cells. Although it is convenient to isolate hepatocytes by collagenase perfusion of intact livers or to study liver cell lines, hepatocyte dedifferentiation commences shortly after disruption of the three-dimensional organization of the liver, as seen by the rapid decline in the transcription rates of liver-specific genes (29Clayton D.F. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 1552-1561Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). We therefore established conditions for perfusing mouse livers in situwith 1% formaldehyde, thereby cross-linking hepatocyte chromatin in the native tissue environment (see “Experimental Procedures”). Unlike the results with the non-cross-linked chromatin described above, Southern blotting of the cross-linked chromatin revealed that even high levels of MNase only partially digested the albumin enhancer N1 sequence to mononucleosome-sized particles (data not shown). Under such conditions, MNase digestion of bulk cross-linked chromatin was partially inhibited, although the majority of DNA was still in mono- and dinucleosome-sized fragments. Apparently, cross-linking generates structures at a number of genomic sites, including the albumin enhancer, that are refractory to MNase digestion. To assess whether core histones are bound specifically to the albumin enhancer N1 region by immunoprecipitation, it was critical to digest the cross-linked chromatin at the boundaries of the N1 particle seen in liver nuclei. If the chromatin was sonicated extensively to nucleosome-sized fragments, the fragments would still represent a mixed population with regard to their content of enhancer N1 sequencesversus adjacent sequences, and we wished to establish definitively whether the N1 sequence was nucleosomal. We therefore developed a procedure (Fig.2 A) in which the perfusion-cross-linked chromatin was first sonicated partially, purified on CsCl gradients (Fig. 2 C), and the soluble fractions were pooled, treated with RNase, and dialyzed. The relatively large purified chromatin segments were then digested with the restriction enzyme MnlI. Extensive trial experiments showed that quantitative MnlI digestion was facilitated by the partial sonication, gradient purification, and RNase treatment.MnlI cuts in the linker regions on either side of the albumin enhancer N1 particle, yielding an N1 fragment of 198 bp;MnlI also releases an 85-bp fragment within the N2 particle (see Fig. 2 B). When MnlI was used to digest chromatin from perfusion cross-linking experiments, and the DNA was then thermal-reversed and analyzed by Southern blotting, it quantitatively revealed the N1 sequence within the correctly sizedMnlI fragment (Fig. 2 D, lane 2). Similar analysis with an N2 region probe detected the expected MnlI fragment, although it was much fainter (data not shown), perhaps because cleavage of these sites is inhibited on the N2 particle (Fig. 2 B). In conclusion, MnlI can access the linker regions that flank the N1 particle in cross-linked chromatin, whereas MNase cannot. Thus, proteins that would co-immunoprecipitate with the N1 MnlI DNA fragment would be bound specifically to this sequence. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments that use parallel immunoprecipitation reactions for distinct proteins cannot distinguish whether the proteins are bound to the same DNA molecule or whether they are bound to two distinct DNA molecules, of the same sequence, in the population. To address whether individual albumin N1 MnlI fragments are simultaneously bound to HNF3 and core histone proteins, we developed a sequential, rather than parallel, chromatin immunoprecipitation procedure. We first bound HNF3 antiserum (24Stevens K. Cirillo L. Zaret K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30471-30477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and preimmune control serum covalently to protein A-Sepharose beads. Covalent binding of antibody to beads would prevent antibody from the first immunoprecipitation, after release of antigen, from persisting through a second immunoprecipitation. We sought to first immunoprecipitate HNF3, rather than the core histones, because the latter were in vast excess in the input chromatin.35S-labeled, in vitro-translated HNF3 was efficiently immunoprecipitated by the HNF3 antibody beads but not by the preimmune beads (Fig. 3 A, compare lanes 2 and 6). To establish sequential immunoprecipitation conditions, we tested a brief exposure of acid or base to elute 35S-labeled HNF3 from the beads (30Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Base but not acid treatment efficiently eluted immunoprecipitated HNF3 from the HNF3 antibody beads (Fig. 3 A, lanes 7 and 8). We then used the antibody beads for immunoprecipitation with perfusion-cross-linked, MnlI-digested liver chromatin. After immunoprecipitation, the pulled-down chromatin material was subjected to thermal reversion of the cross-links, DNA purification, and PCR cycle step analysis with primers specific to the N1 and N2 enhancerMnlI fragments (Fig. 2 B). We used PCR increments of three cycles to the level at which background preimmune and no-antibody control signals were just above detection levels (Fig.3 B) and then quantitated the HNF3 immune signal to preimmune control ratios (Fig. 3 C). In most experiments, the preimmune and no-antibody signals were within a few fold of each other. Phosphorimager analysis showed that, within the exponential range of two independent chromatin immunoprecipitation and PCR experiments, the N1 region was enriched an average of 10-fold by the HNF3 antibody beads, relative to the preimmune beads, whereas the N2 region was enriched ∼0.5-fold by the HNF3 antiserum relative to the control (Fig. 3 C). Note that the N2 region lacks an HNF3 binding site (31Shim E.Y. Woodcock C. Zaret K.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 5-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Thus, the N1 region was selectively immunoprecipitated compared with the N2 region. These data corroborate prior in vivo footprinting and trans-activation data (6Gualdi R. Bossard P. Zheng M. Hamada Y. Coleman J.R. Zaret K.S. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1670-1682Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 14McPherson C.E. Shim E.-Y. Friedman D.S. Zaret K.S.

Development. 1998; 125: 4909-4917Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by showing that HNF3 protein indeed occupies the albumin enhancer N1 region. The data also show that proteins binding to the N1 region can be distinguished from those binding to immediately flanking sequences in chromatin. We first screened previously characterized antibodies to histone H2A, H2B, and H3 (25Bustin M. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 214-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 33Goldblatt D. Bustin M. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 1689-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and commercial antibodies to the N-terminal 20 amino acids of histone H3 and acetylated H3 (Upstate Biotechnology) for their ability to immunoprecipitate albumin enhancer sequences. The H2A and commercial H3 antibodies markedly immunoprecipitated the enhancer N1 sequence relative to controls (Fig.4, A, lanes 11 and12, and B, lanes 10 and 11). The acetylated H3, noncommercial H3, and H2B antibodies also enriched the N1 sequence but not as strongly (Fig. 4, A, lanes 6, 9, and15, and B, lane 15). Limited experiments with the antibodies immunoprecipitating purified core histone proteins showed that the most effective antibodies were also more effective in the chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments (data not shown). In summary, most of the core histone proteins are detectable at the albumin enhancer N1 sequence. To determine whether HNF3 co-occupies the albumin enhancer with core histone proteins, we performed sequential immunoprecipitations with HNF3 antibody beads and then antibodies to core histone proteins H2A and H3, which were strongly positive in single immunoprecipitations. Liver chromatin was cross-linked by perfusion, partially sonicated, purified, digested with MnlI, immunoprecipitated with anti-HNF3 antibody beads, released and rapidly brought to neutral pH, and then immunoprecipitated with a subset of the original panel of anti-core histone antibodies. PCR cycle step analysis of the final products showed that the anti-H2A antibody robustly immunoprecipitated the albumin enhancer N1 sequence relative to the control antibody for the H2A reaction (Fig. 5 A, lanes 4–9). Importantly, the low signals in the control antibody reaction demonstrate that HNF3 antibody was not released from the beads during antigen elution. These data show that histone H2A is part of a nucleoprotein enhancer complex containing the transcription factor HNF3. Notably, in all known instances of H2A bound to DNA in nuclei, the histone is within a nucleosome core particle (34van Holde K.E. Chromatin. 1. Springer-Verlag, New York1989Google Scholar). Neither of the histone H3 antibodies that worked in single immunoprecipitations was able to immunoprecipitate the N1 sequence relative to control antibody in a sequential immunoprecipitation after the anti-HNF3 antibody beads (Fig. 5 B, lanes 1–9). A parallel experiment for H2A worked as described above (Fig. 5 B, lanes 10–15). Thus, the population of histone H3-bound enhancer complexes detected by single anti-histone H3 immunoprecipitation (Fig.4) does not represent the population of enhancer molecules detected by the HNF3 immunoprecipitations (Fig. 5). These data illustrate the difficulty in trying to draw conclusions about multiple regulatory factors in a complex from immunoprecipitation experiments done in parallel, as in Fig. 4, and emphasize the importance of the sequential immunoprecipitation approach, as in Fig. 5. The occurrence of histone H2A bound to DNA with HNF3 is consistent with the appearance of albumin enhancer sequences within the solubilized nucleosome fraction from native liver chromatin (Fig. 1 E). HNF3 can form stable complexes with nucleosome core particlesin vitro, along with other albumin enhancer binding factors (7Cirillo L.A. Zaret K.S. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 961-969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), and the boundaries of the enhancer N1 particle in liver nuclei are nucleosomal in size, extending well beyond the boundaries of footprinted proteins (14McPherson C.E. Shim E.-Y. Friedman D.S. Zaret K.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 387-398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Furthermore, all of the enhancer factor binding sites are critical for enhancer function (32Bossard P. Zaret K. Development. 1998; 125: 4909-4917Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Goldblatt D. Bustin M. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 1689-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 36Liu J.-K. DiPersio C.M. Zaret K.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 773-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). It therefore appears that the active albumin enhancer consists of a complex of transcription factors, including HNF3, that are bound to a nucleosome. We expect that histone H3 should be in such an enhancer nucleosome complex, although it was not detected by sequential immunoprecipitation. We suggest that bound HNF3 or other enhancer binding factors hide the histone H3 epitope in the enhancer complex. This is underscored by recent evidence that HNF3 protein interacts directly with histone H3 and not H2A, 2L. A. Cirillo, F. R. Lin, I. Cuesta, M. Jarnik, and K. S. Zaret, submitted for publication. and that NF1, another factor present at the N1 enhancer complex (14McPherson C.E. Shim E.-Y. Friedman D.S. Zaret K.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 387-398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), also binds to core histone H3 (35Alevizopoulos A. Dusserre Y. Tsai-Pflugfelder M. von der Weid T. Wahli W. Mermod N. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3051-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Thus, at least two albumin enhancer binding factors could mask an H3 epitope on a nucleosome. In conclusion, we suggest that core histone proteins can serve as an architectural component that could promote specific transcription factor interactions within a stable, higher-order enhancer complex. The co-occupancy of nuclear DNA by HNF3 and H2A and many recent studies that have found transcription factors and core histones that are separately immunoprecipitable at other enhancers and promoters suggest that nucleosomes might be intrinsically positive in many contexts of eukaryotic gene regulation.

https://openalex.org/W2055852855,"The cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) is essential for pathogenesis and transmission of prion diseases. Although prion replication in the brain is accompanied by neurodegeneration, prions multiply efficiently in the lymphoreticular system without any detectable pathology. We have used pulse-chase metabolic radiolabeling experiments to investigate the turnover and processing of PrP(C) in primary cell cultures derived from lymphoid and nervous tissues. Similar kinetics of PrP(C) degradation were observed in these tissues. This indicates that the differences between these two organs with respect to their capacity to replicate prions is not due to differences in the turnover of PrP(C). Substantial amounts of a soluble form of PrP that lacks the glycolipid anchor appeared in the medium of splenocytes and cerebellar granule cells. Soluble PrP was detected in murine and human serum, suggesting that it might be of physiological relevance."
https://openalex.org/W1968638010,"The primitive gonad of the Drosophila embryo is formed from two cell types, the somatic gonad precursor cells (SGPs) and the germ cells, which originate at distant sites. To reach the SGPs the germ cells must undergo a complex series of cell movements. While there is evidence that attractive and repulsive signals guide germ cell migration through the embryo, the molecular identity of these instructive molecules has remained elusive. Here, we present evidence suggesting that hedgehog (hh) may serve as such an attractive guidance cue. Misexpression of hh in the soma induces germ cells to migrate to inappropriate locations. Conversely, cell-autonomous components of the hh pathway appear to be required in the germline for proper germ cell migration."

Here we have identified and characterized the human homolog of mouse wig-1. The human wig-1 protein is 87% identical to the mouse protein and contains three zinc finger domains and a putative nuclear localization signal. Human wig-1 mRNA and protein is induced following activation of wild type p53 expression in our BL41-ts p53 Burkitt lymphoma cells. Wig-1 is also induced in MCF7 cells following treatment with the DNA-damaging agent mitomycin C. Northern blotting detected low levels of wig-1 mRNA in normal human tissues. Fluorescence in situ hybridization mapped wig-1 to human chromosome 3q26.3-27. FLAG-tagged human wig-1 localizes to the nucleus. Ectopic overexpression of human wig-1 inhibits tumor cell growth in a colony formation assay. These results suggest that human wig-1 has a role in the p53-dependent growth regulatory pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2316247292,"HoxB8 was the first homeobox gene identified as a cause of leukemia. In murine WEHI3B acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, proviral integration leads to the expression of both HoxB8 and Interleukin (IL-3). Enforced expression of HoxB8 blocks differentiation of factor-dependent myeloid progenitors, while IL-3 co-expression induces autocrine proliferation and overt leukemogenicity. Previously, we demonstrated that HoxB8 binds DNA cooperatively with members of the Pbx family of transcription factors, and that HoxB8 makes contact with the Pbx homeodomain through a hexameric sequence designated the Pbx-interaction motif (PIM). E2a-Pbx1, an oncogenic derivative of Pbx1, both retains its ability to heterodimerize with Hox proteins and arrest myeloid differentiation. This observation prompts the question of whether E2a-Pbx1 and Hox oncoproteins use endogenous Hox and Pbx proteins, respectively, to target a common set of cellular genes. Here, we use four different models of neutrophil and macrophage differentiation to determine whether HoxB8 needs to bind DNA or Pbx cofactors in order to arrest myeloid differentiation. The ability of HoxB8 to bind DNA or to bind Pbx was essential (1) to block differentiation of factor-dependent myeloid progenitors from primary marrow; (2) to block IL-6-induced monocytic differentiation of M1-AML cells; and (3) to block granulocytic differentiation of GM-CSF-dependent ECoM-G cells. However, while DNA-binding was required, the HoxB8 Pbx-interaction motif was unnecessary for preventing macrophage differentiation of ECoM-M cells. We conclude that HoxB8 prevents differentiation by directly influencing cellular gene expression, and that the genetic context within a cell dictates whether the effect of HoxB8 is dependent on a physical interaction with Pbx proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2318901649,"The expression of VEGF and the relapse-free survival rate of breast cancer patients are inversely related. While VEGF induces the proliferation and migration of vascular endothelial cells, its function in breast cancer cells is not well studied. We reported previously that fibronectin increased VEGF-dependent migration in breast cancer cells. Since VEGF has an extracellular matrix (ECM)-binding domain and possesses binding affinity for heparin, we sought to determine the effects of VEGF in breast cancer cells and the role of heparin and/or fibronectin in VEGF-induced signaling. Cells grown on plastic were compared to those grown on fibronectin or to those grown on plastic in the presence of heparin, and analysed for intracellular signaling, proliferation and migration in response to VEGF165. Both heparin and fibronectin enhanced the binding of VEGF to T47D cells. After treatment with VEGF, [3H]thymidine incorporation, c-fos induction, and the number of migrating cells were significantly higher (∼twofold) in cells grown on fibronectin or in cells grown on plastic in the presence of heparin when compared to those grown on plastic only. Likewise, tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGF receptors, MAPK activity and PI3-kinase activity were all several-fold higher in cells seeded on fibronectin or in the presence of heparin as compared to cells exposed to VEGF alone. VEGF-dependent c-fos induction was found to be regulated through a MAPK-dependent, but PI3-kinase-independent pathway. In contrast, the migration of T47D cells in response to VEGF, in the presence of ECM, was regulated through PI3-kinase. Therefore, VEGF requires ECM components to induce a mitogenic response and cell migration in T47D breast cancer cells."

There are other Glut sugar transporter isoforms; of these, Glut2–5 have very high homology to Glut1, which suggests strong structural conservation between the different members of the family. By applying mutagenetic techniques to Glut1, selected conserved amino acids and whole domains have been altered, swapped, and deleted. The mutagenesis data have provided insight into locations, which are crucial for substrate binding and for conformational changes that result in d-glucose translocation (18Barrett M.P. Walmsley A.R. Gould G.W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 496-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Glut1 admits dehydroascorbic acid as a substrate (19Vera J.C. Rivas C.I. Fischbarg J. Golde D.W. Nature. 1993; 364: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar), and also exhibits a modest water conductance (20Fischbarg J. Kuang K. Vera J.C. Arant S. Silverstein S.C. Loike J. Rosen O.M.

Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Application to lac permease of cysteine scanning mutagenesis in conjunction with biochemical, biophysical, and immunological techniques has resulted in some 100 interactions mapped between residues in different helices. Based on the above, a helix-packing model of lac permease has been advanced (24Frillingos S. Sahin-Toth M. Wu J. Kaback H.R. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1281-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 25Venkatesan P. Liu Z. Hu Y. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10649-10655Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In addition, from cysteine scanning mutagenesis of Glut1, Hruz and Mueckler (26Hruz P.W. Mueckler M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36176-36180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 27Hruz P.W. Mueckler M.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9367-9372Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and Keller and collegues (28Olsowski A. Monden I. Keller K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10738-10745Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 29Olsowski A. Monden I. Krause G. Keller K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2469-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) have described residues related to glucose transport, and solvent accessible residues in helices II, V, VII, and XI. From this, a helix-packing model of Glut1 similar to that of lac permease has been suggested (27Hruz P.W. Mueckler M.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9367-9372Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).Our understanding of the sequence, biology, and biochemistry of Glut1 is increasing rapidly. However, given the attending difficulties in crystallizing membrane proteins, there is also growing interest in the development and application of molecular modeling techniques to understand the structure of Gluts and relate it to their function. The lack of crystallographic structures for most classes of membrane proteins (including Gluts) means that there are no suitable templates that can be used to generate structures by homology modeling. This creates a need for alternative modeling approaches in which the available experimental biological and biophysical data are used as a reference for the modeling process. The glucose transporter Glut1 is unique given the large amount of experimental data that are available. Therefore, starting from the helical packing schemes referred to above for lac permease and Glut1, we have been able to arrive at a three-dimensional structure of Glut1. We describe here the procedures utilized and offer validation for our structure using stereochemical analysis and mutagenesis data.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESThere are no crystallographic or NMR structure of any proteins with significant overall sequence similarity to Glut1 in the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics Protein Data Bank. Thus we could not construct Glut1 by homology modeling. Instead, we chose to use a piecemeal strategy.Helical AssignmentsWe used the GTR1_HUMAN sequence of Glut1 from Swiss Protein Data Base P11166. For the initial structure, α-helices were predicted using the consensus of the programs PHD (30Rost B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 525-539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), TMPRED (31Pasquier C. Promponas V.J. Palaios G.A. Hamodrakas J.S. Hamodrakas S.J. Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 381-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and PSA (32Stultz C.M. White J.V. Smith T.F. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar).ModelingFor molecular modeling we utilized a Silicon Graphics Octane work station with InsightII software (Molecular Simulations, Inc.). The predicted helices were given the tilt and the three-dimensional proximity depicted in Kaback's scheme for lactose permease (24Frillingos S. Sahin-Toth M. Wu J. Kaback H.R. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1281-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 25Venkatesan P. Liu Z. Hu Y. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10649-10655Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For the rotation around their z axis, we assumed that the helices were arranged with their hydrophilic sides facing a central channel. This was done based on deuterium exchange studies suggesting that 80% of the Glut1 backbone is accessible to water (1Alvarez J. Lee D.C. Baldwin S.A. Chapman D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3502-3509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Jung E.K. Chin J.J. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9155-9160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and on evidence that Glut1 has a modest but finite permeability to water (20Fischbarg J. Kuang K. Vera J.C. Arant S. Silverstein S.C. Loike J. Rosen O.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3244-3247Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 34Zhang R. Alper S. Thorens B. Verkman A.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1553-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). For helices II, V, VII, and XI, the rotation was determined using the results of cysteine-scanning mutagenesis studies. For the rest of the helices, we used the results of Ducarme et al. (35Ducarme P. Rahman M. Lins L. Brasseur R. J. Mol. Modeling. 1996; 2: 27-45Google Scholar) to determine the solvent-accessible faces. Loops were generated and connected using the “filgap” command in the program Whatif (36Oliveira L. Paiva A.C. Vriend G. Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).RefinementThe ensemble obtained was subject to energy minimization using the Discover module of InsightII (100 iterations with the steepest descent algorithm, and 1000 more with the conjugate gradients algorithm). By then, the root mean square derivative was <0.1 kcal mol−1 Å-1. We then used the program ProsaII (37Sippl M.J. Proteins. 1993; 17: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1750) Google Scholar) to assess and improve the locations of helical caps based on Prosa energy plots and Z-scores. The resulting residue assignments for the 12 α-helices are H1, 19–27; H2, 67–81; H3, 99–111; H4, 124–143; H5, 156–175; H6, 191–204; H7, 276–290; H8, 309–326; H9, 347–356; H10, 366–378; H11, 403–417; and H12, 424–445. At this stage of modeling, helical residues fell well into the most favored Ramachandran regions, but many loop residues fell in disallowed regions and exhibited close contacts (distances < 2.2 Å) and undesirable torsion angles. We therefore searched for homologous loops with better conformations using the program Swiss-Pdb Viewer (V3.5) (38Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9467) Google Scholar). The structure was then subjected to minimization as above, and to molecular dynamics (CVFF forcefield; 298 K; 5 ps of initial equilibration followed by 5 ps dynamics run) with the backbone fixed to optimize the position of the side chains.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONA ribbon representation of the Glut1 structure we found is given in Fig. 1. Helices 1–5, 8, and 10–12 are arranged in a 9-member barrel-like manner, delimiting a hydrophilic central channel. Helix 7 projects itself into the channel, suggesting a central role in regulating putative transport of solutes through that channel. From the side view, the structure appears roughly symmetrical, as in other barrel proteins. The arrangement of the helices is conical, the shorter side facing exofacially. This may be related to the fact that, as a rule, the exofacial loops tend to be shorter than the endofacial ones.The quality of the Glut1 structure was ascertained using the program PROCHECK (version 3.3.2) (39Laskowki R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallog. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). For comparison, we also determined the quality of the structures reported for two α-helical membrane proteins solved by crystallography, the KcsA K+ channel (40Doyle D.A. Cabral J.M. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5684) Google Scholar), and the aquaporin 1 (AQP1) water channel (41Ren G. Reddy S. Cheng A. Melnyk P. Mitra A.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1398-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). TableI gives the distribution of the φ, ψ angles in the different regions of the Ramachandran plot. As can be seen, the Glut1 structure is at least as good as those of the other proteins. Several PROCHECK stereochemical parameters and the stereochemical quality are summarized in TableII. From this table, the quality of the Glut1 structure appears as good as (or better) that of two α-helical membrane proteins, the Kcsa and AQP1 channels, implying excellent structural quality for our model structure. To be noted, the PDB data base from which the loops were derived is composed overwhelmingly by globular proteins. It is unclear whether the standard quality factors for facilitator/channel membrane proteins would be precisely the same as those for globular ones, as facilitators/channels would be expected to include a water-filled internal pore in their fold. Hence, that the quality of our structure may appear “better” than those of the comparison channels may be simply related to the data base peculiarity noted.Table IPROCHECK Ramachandran scores for the structures of Glut1, the KcsA K+ channel, and the AQP1 water channelStructureRamachandran plot (%)CoreAllowedGenerousDisallowedGlut11-aProtein Data Bank number:1JA5.81.516.91.70.0KCSA1-bProtein Data Bank number: 1BL8.74.724.11.20.0AQP11-cProtein Data Bank number: 1IH5.70.720.98.40.01-a Protein Data Bank number:1JA5.1-b Protein Data Bank number: 1BL8.1-c Protein Data Bank number: 1IH5.

Open table in a new tab We next sought to determine if our structure agrees with the functional and biochemical characteristics experimentally determined for Glut1 by many laboratories. Using the program HOLE (42Smart O.S. Goodfellow J.M. Wallace B.A. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 2455-2460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar), we looked for solvent-accessible channels that might serve as transport pathways. We find two channels in our structure. One (the main one) traverses both α-helical and loop regions, and passes close to and curls around helix 7 (cf. Figs. 2 and3). This channel could serve as the glucose transport channel, as elaborated below. The second one (auxiliary channel) is delimited by helices 1, 2, 3, and 7; it is open only at the endofacial site, where it overlaps with the main channel. A study by Keller's (29Olsowski A. Monden I. Krause G. Keller K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2469-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) laboratory concluded there is an exofacial solvent accessible cleft between helices 2 and 7, and that such a cleft could serve as a pathway for substrates other than sugars. The presence of the auxiliary channel in our structure is consistent with such conclusion. In addition, the existence of two solvent-filled channels in the Glut1 structure is also supported by the deuterium exchange studies cited above suggesting that 80% of the Glut1 backbone is accessible to water (1Alvarez J. Lee D.C. Baldwin S.A. Chapman D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3502-3509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Jung E.K. Chin J.J. Jung C.Y. J. Biol.

The main channel enters the 12 α-helical domain close to residues Thr310 (43Klepper J. Wang D. Fischbarg J. Vera J.C. Jarjour I.T. O'Driscoll K.R. De Vivo D.C. Neurochem. Res. 1999; 24: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) (H8), Gly175 (H5), and to H7. The figure then shows the proximity of the channel to H7 and residues Gln172 , Val290 ,Phe416 , Ile287 , and Asn288. About midway, the main channel turns toward H2 (Fig. 2 b), passing close to Ser80,Leu280 ,Ser281, and Gln282. It then turns once more and goes toward the cytoplasmic side passing near Leu278 ,Val277 , andVal276 . The channel has two segments joined by a bottleneck region near the level of the QLS motif. As Fig. 2 shows, H7, H8, and H11 are all crucial components of the channel. Interestingly, this organization is strikingly reminiscent of the one in a Glut1 model suggested by Jung and colleagues (44Zeng H. Parthasarathy R. Rampal A.L. Jung C.Y. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 14-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Of the two Glut1 models offered there, both of them had H7, H8, and H11 forming part of the channel, as in this one. While on the subject of Glut models, importantly, D. S. Dwyer (45Dwyer D.S. Proteins. 2001; 42: 531-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) has recently described a three-dimensional model for Glut3, which is the major glucose transporter of neuronal cells and is highly homologous to Glut1. Dwyer arrived at his structure differently than ourselves. He used homology modeling on the basis of structural data from the MscL protein, a mechanosensititive ion channel, and general insights from aquaporin 1. A detailed comparison of his model with our current one cannot be offered, as no three-dimensional coordinates for Dwyer's model have appeared in the PDB data base at this writing. In broad terms, in Dwyer's approach, functional correlations with Glut3 residues at equivalent positions of Glut1 mutants are unclear, the pore appears somewhat narrower than that in our model (perhaps as a result of his assumption that only 6 helices limit the pore), and the fold of his long intracellular segment is more extended than ours. On the other hand, in the molecular dynamics he presents, glucose does move 3.5 Å along the pore. In addition, although the helical tilts from the vertical appear less pronounced in his case, there is similarity with the overall packing of our own model (and Kaback's scheme) both in the relative positions of the helices and in the fact that his helix 7 also appears inside a large hydrophilic cavity and borders on the pore. Given the different starting points referred to, such similarity between the models appears quite significant.To return to our structure, the exofacial segment of the main channel is surrounded by the periplasmic ends of H5, H7, H8, H9, and H10 (Figs.1 b and 2), and the endofacial segment by the cytoplasmic ends of H1, H2, H3, H7, and H11. Fittingly, there is evidence (26Hruz P.W. Mueckler M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36176-36180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) that the periplasmic segments of H5 and H7 were accessible to extracellular pCMBS while their cytoplasmic segments were not. From Fig. 2, the main channel curls around H7, away from the cytoplasmic portion of H5, and moving toward the opposite face of H7 as it forms its endofacial segment. Although the cytoplasmic portion of H7 is close to the endofacial segment of the channel, it is structurally not easily accessed by extracellular pCMBS because of the bottleneck. However, it can be accessed by NEM (26Hruz P.W. Mueckler M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36176-36180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), as referred to below.To investigate the location of the exofacial-binding site, we positioned a glucose molecule in the widest part of the exofacial segment of the main channel (not shown). During a subsequent 10-ps molecular dynamics simulation, the glucose molecule remained in that general area and formed a hydrogen bond to Asn288. This is consistent with experimental evidence: the mutation N288C resulted in a 10-fold reduction in normalized glucose transport (27Hruz P.W. Mueckler M.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9367-9372Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It would appear that the minimized structure we have arrived at corresponds to or is near the so-called endofacial conformation. The exploration of putative intermediate conformations leading to an exofacial one will be the subject of future studies.We next determined the spatial relations between the main channel in our structure and the locations of conserved residues and motifs, which are characteristic of the family of hexose transporters. From mutagenesis experiments, the conserved QLS motif in helix 7 forms part of the exofacial substrate-binding site and acts as a selectivity filter allowing Glut1, -3, and -4 to transport glucose, but not fructose (46Seatter M.J. De la Rue S.A. Porter L.M. Gould G.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In our structure (Fig. 3), the QLS motif delimits the main channel (herein after channel) and is in the vicinity of the putative exofacial substrate occupancy site. Similarly, it is known that substitutions of the conserved residues Tyr292/293, and Trp412 markedly affect transporter function (18Barrett M.P. Walmsley A.R. Gould G.W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 496-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Fittingly, in our structure (Fig. 3), Tyr292/293 delimit the channel, and Trp412 is in close proximity to it. Turning now to the cytochalasin B-binding site, evidence locates it somewhere near residues 388–412 (47Holman G.D. Rees W.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 897: 395-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). As highlighted in Fig. 3, those residues are very close to the endofacial end of both channels. Finally, it is known that none of the native Glut1 cysteine residues are essential for transport function (48Wellner M. Monden I. Keller K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 19-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Once more, as Fig. 3 shows, the structure conforms to prior evidence: in our structure, all cysteines are far from the channel. From all this, our structure accounts very well for the experimental evidence this far.There are studies suggesting that Glut1 in erythrocytes can exist as an oligomer with a putative disulfide bond between cysteine residues 347 and 421 (49Zottola R.J. Cloherty E.K. Coderre P.E. Hansen A. Hebert D.N. Carruthers A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9734-9747Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). However, when the Glut1 construct with all the cysteine residues replaced (C-less Glut1 (48Wellner M. Monden I. Keller K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 19-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 50Mueckler M. Makepeace C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30141-30146Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar)) is expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, glucose transport is practically unaffected. Moreover, other studies suggest the existence of monomeric functional Glut transporters (forms 1–3) with no alteration in the kinetic parameters when expressed in X. laevis oocytes (51Burant C.F. Bell G.I. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10414-10420Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The significance of the polymeric nature of Gluts is an interesting, still unclear question. In contrast, as detailed in the context, using our model for a monomer we can explain the results of almost all the mutagenic studies done so far.As a further test of our structure, we next sought to quantify the degree to which the locations of the channels in the structure correspond to those of all Glut1 94 residues which have been mutated (26Hruz P.W. Mueckler M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36176-36180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 27Hruz P.W. Mueckler M.M.

https://openalex.org/W2092986293,"C to U editing of apolipoprotein B (apoB) RNA requires a multicomponent holoenzyme complex in which minimal constituents include apobec-1 and apobec-1 complementation factor (ACF). We have examined the predicted functional domains in ACF in binding apoB RNA, interaction with apobec-1, and complementation of RNA editing. We demonstrate that apoB RNA binding and apobec-1-interacting domains are defined by two partially overlapping regions containing the NH2-terminal RNA recognition motifs of ACF. Both apoB RNA binding and apobec-1 interaction are required for editing complementation activity. ACF is a nuclear protein that upon cotransfection with apobec-1 results in nuclear colocalization and redistribution of apobec-1 from the cytoplasm. ACF constructs with deletions or mutations in the putative nuclear localization signal (NLS) still localize in the nucleus of transfected cells but do not colocalize with apobec-1, the latter remaining predominantly cytoplasmic. These observations suggest that the putative NLS motif in ACF is not responsible for its nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking. By contrast, protein-protein interaction is important for the nuclear import of apobec-1. Taken together, these data suggest that functional complementation of C to U RNA editing by apobec-1 involves the NH2-terminal 380 residues of ACF. C to U editing of apolipoprotein B (apoB) RNA requires a multicomponent holoenzyme complex in which minimal constituents include apobec-1 and apobec-1 complementation factor (ACF). We have examined the predicted functional domains in ACF in binding apoB RNA, interaction with apobec-1, and complementation of RNA editing. We demonstrate that apoB RNA binding and apobec-1-interacting domains are defined by two partially overlapping regions containing the NH2-terminal RNA recognition motifs of ACF. Both apoB RNA binding and apobec-1 interaction are required for editing complementation activity. ACF is a nuclear protein that upon cotransfection with apobec-1 results in nuclear colocalization and redistribution of apobec-1 from the cytoplasm. ACF constructs with deletions or mutations in the putative nuclear localization signal (NLS) still localize in the nucleus of transfected cells but do not colocalize with apobec-1, the latter remaining predominantly cytoplasmic. These observations suggest that the putative NLS motif in ACF is not responsible for its nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking. By contrast, protein-protein interaction is important for the nuclear import of apobec-1. Taken together, these data suggest that functional complementation of C to U RNA editing by apobec-1 involves the NH2-terminal 380 residues of ACF. apolipoprotein B apobec-1 complementation factor RNA recognition motif glycine-arginine-tyrosine-rich RNA-binding protein arginine-glycine nuclear localization signal polymerase chain reaction polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ribonucleoprotein cyanine Posttranscriptional modification of RNA is an important mechanism, whereby the genetic repertoire of the organism may be amplified beyond that encoded in the chromosomal template (reviewed in Ref. 1Maas S.

A comparison of the modular structure of ACF has been further facilitated by the recent identification of a related gene, GRY-RBP, which while sharing several of the domains present in ACF and described below does not complement apobec-1 in mediating C to U editing of apoB RNA (20Blanc V.

One of the unresolved issues concerning the biochemical mechanisms of C to U editing of apoB RNA, however, is the importance of substrate binding in constraining cytidine deamination to a single nucleotide. This is a particularly perplexing issue, because apobec-1 itself has RNA binding activity albeit low affinity and yet exhibits an absolute cofactor requirement (24Anant S. MacGinnitie A.J.

Accordingly, a central objective of our investigation was to resolve the requirement for RNA binding in the function of ACF and to identify the domains responsible. For example, in addition to three RRMs, ACF contains a region with six RG residues and a COOH-terminal double-stranded RNA binding domain (Fig. 1) (18Mehta A. Kinter M.T. Sherman N.E. Driscoll D.M.

Available evidence suggests that apoB RNA editing is predominantly a nuclear event, although recent work suggests that it may also occur in the cytoplasmic compartment of transfected cells (27Lau P.P.

Confocal immunolocalization studies suggest that apobec-1 is distributed both in the nucleus and cytoplasm of transfected cells (20Blanc V. Navaratnam N. Henderson J.O. Anant S. Kennedy S. Jarmuz A.

However, following cotransfection with ACF, the distribution of apobec-1 becomes predominantly nuclear, suggesting that the interaction of these two proteins leads to translocation of a complex into the nucleus (20Blanc V.

The functional relevance of a putative bipartite NLS in the NH2 terminus of apobec-1 has been called into question as a result of studies from Smith and colleagues (30Yang Y. Sowden M.P. Smith H.C. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 267: 153-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), suggesting that two distinct domains are required for nuclear distribution beyond the putative NLS regionper se. By contrast, ACF contains a seven-residue stretch (144PKTKKRE150) that resembles an SV40-type NLS (18Mehta A. Kinter M.T. Sherman N.E. Driscoll D.M. Mol. Cell.

This result raised the possibility that the determinants of nuclear distribution of the holoenzyme reside not in apobec-1 but perhaps in ACF.We have undertaken studies to localize specific domains in ACF responsible for its RNA binding activity and for mediating protein-protein interaction with apobec-1. Our findings indicate that these functional activities are distributed in distinct but partially overlapping regions of the protein, and both activities are required for efficient complementation of C to U editing. Epitope-tagged ACF bearing deletions or mutations in the putative NLS revealed a nuclear distribution, suggesting that this domain is not required for nuclear localization. However, the interaction of the NLS mutants with apobec-1 was impaired, and the distribution of apobec-1 in cotransfected cells remained predominantly cytoplasmic compared with the nuclear colocalization found with wild-type ACF. The collective results suggest that the functional domains of ACF involved in C to U editing of apoB RNA are localized in the regions spanning residues 1–380, particularly the second and third RRM. Posttranscriptional modification of RNA is an important mechanism, whereby the genetic repertoire of the organism may be amplified beyond that encoded in the chromosomal template (reviewed in Ref. 1Maas S.

Our findings indicate that these functional activities are distributed in distinct but partially overlapping regions of the protein, and both activities are required for efficient complementation of C to U editing. Epitope-tagged ACF bearing deletions or mutations in the putative NLS revealed a nuclear distribution, suggesting that this domain is not required for nuclear localization. However, the interaction of the NLS mutants with apobec-1 was impaired, and the distribution of apobec-1 in cotransfected cells remained predominantly cytoplasmic compared with the nuclear colocalization found with wild-type ACF. The collective results suggest that the functional domains of ACF involved in C to U editing of apoB RNA are localized in the regions spanning residues 1–380, particularly the second and third RRM.

https://openalex.org/W2037179118,"The Survival of Motor Neurons(SMN) is the disease gene of spinal muscular atrophy. We have previously established a genetic system based on the chicken pre-B cell line DT40, in which expression of SMN protein is regulated by tetracycline, to study the function of SMN in vivo. Depletion of SMN protein is lethal to these cells. Here we tested the functionality of mutant SMN proteins by determining their capacity to rescue the cells after depletion of wild-type SMN. Surprisingly, all of the spinal muscular atrophy-associated missense mutations tested were able to support cell viability and proliferation. Deletion of the amino acids encoded by exon 7 of the SMN gene resulted in a partial loss of function. A mutant SMN protein lacking both the tyrosine/glycine repeat (in exon 6) and exon 7 failed to sustain viability, indicating that the C terminus of the protein is critical for SMN activity. Interestingly, the Tudor domain of SMN, encoded by exon 3, does not appear to be essential for SMN function since a mutant deleted of this domain restored cell viability. Unexpectedly, a chicken SMN mutant (ΔN39) lacking the N-terminal 39 amino acids that encompass the Gemin2-binding domain also rescued the lethal phenotype. Moreover, the level of Gemin2 in ΔN39-rescued cells was significantly reduced, indicating that Gemin2 is not required for ΔN39 to perform the essential function of SMN in DT40 cells.

Deletions of the telomericSMN gene (SMN1) have been found in a vast majority of SMA patients. As a result, the SMN protein is solely expressed from the centromeric SMN gene (SMN2), which often leads to a lower SMN level in SMA patients compared with unaffected individuals. The extent of reduction of the SMN level appears to closely correlate with the severity of the disease (10Lefebvre S. Burlet P. Liu Q. Bertrandy S. Clermont O. Munnich A. Dreyfuss G. Melki J. Nat.

Although the two SMN genes encode an identical protein, the splicing patterns of the pre-mRNAs transcribed from theSMN1 and SMN2 genes are different (2Lefebvre S. Burglen L. Reboullet S. Clermont O. Burlet P. Viollet L. Benichou B. Cruaud C. Millasseau P. Zeviani M. Le Paslier D. Frezal J. Cohen D. Weissenbach J. Munnich A. Melki J.

Although both pre-mRNAs are spliced into full-length SMN mRNAs, most of the SMN2-derived pre-mRNA is alternatively spliced to generate an SMN mRNA lacking exon 7 (Ex7) that encodes the last C-terminal 16 amino acids. In addition to the deletions, missense point mutations have been found in SMA patients who still retain one SMN1allele (12Wirth B. Hum. Mutat. 2000; 15: 228-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which a reduction of the SMN protein causes motor neuron degeneration remains unclear. SMN does not contain any domain with a known function. However, alignment of SMN proteins of several species ranging fromSchizosaccharomyces pombe to human reveals two highly conserved regions located at the N and C termini, which suggests functional importance of the two regions (13Miguel-Aliaga I.

Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1997; 90: 1013-1021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 24Fischer U. Liu Q. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1997; 90: 1023-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Gemin2 interacts directly with SMN in vitro and can be co-immunoprecipitated with SMN from cell extracts. SMN and Gemin2 are co-localized in cells. Fractionation of cell extracts by chromatography showed that the SMN and Gemin2 proteins coeluted in a high molecular mass peak, indicating that SMN and Gemin2 exist in a macromolecular complex in vivo. Moreover, depletion of the SMN protein in cells results in a significant reduction of the level of Gemin2, suggesting that Gemin2 is stabilized by SMN binding (25Wang J. Dreyfuss G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9599-9605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The interaction of SMN and Gemin2 is mediated by the phylogenetically conserved N terminus of SMN (16Liu Q. Fischer U. Wang F. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1997; 90: 1013-1021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Recently, a protein in the fission yeast S. pombe that binds to the N terminus of the yeast ortholog of SMN has been identified and shown to share low sequence homology with Gemin2 (26Hannus S. Buhler D. Romano M. Seraphin B. Fischer U. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 663-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In addition to Gemin2, several other proteins are co-immunoprecipitated with SMN from cell extracts, including Gemin3, Gemin4, and the core Sm proteins of spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs). Gemin3 is a DEAD box-containing putative RNA helicase (18Charroux B. Pellizzoni L. Perkinson R.A. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1181-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), whereas Gemin4 does not share significant homology with any known protein (22Charroux B. Pellizzoni L. Perkinson R.A. Yong J. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1177-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The C terminus of SMN, including the sequence encoded by Ex7 and the highly conserved tyrosine/glycine-rich sequence (Y/G box), is required for SMN to interact directly with Gemin3 and the Sm proteins as well as for its oligomerization (18Charroux B.

Deletion of Ex7 and, to a lesser extent, a point mutation found in SMA patients that changes a tyrosine residue in the Y/G box to cysteine (Y272C) significantly reduces these interactions. The central region of SMN shares homology with the Tudor domain of the Drosophila Tudor protein (29Ponting C.P. Trends Biochem.

Sattler M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The structure and in vitro binding assays suggest that the Tudor domain of SMN mediates the interaction with Sm proteins (32Selenko P. Sprangers R. Stier G. Buhler D. Fischer U. Sattler M. Nat.

Several lines of evidence have suggested that SMN plays a critical role in snRNP metabolism, pre-mRNA splicing, and gene transcription (24Fischer U. Liu Q. Dreyfuss G.

Genetic studies have shown that SMN is an essential gene in various organisms, indicating that the SMN protein is required for fundamental cellular process(es) (13Miguel-Aliaga I. Culetto E.

A. 1997; 94: 9920-9925Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar); yet partial loss of SMN function leads to selective motor neuron degeneration. Mice that are null in the smn gene and carry a humanSMN2 transgene are viable, but develop symptoms that bear resemblance to human SMA (37Hsieh-Li H.M. Chang J.G. Jong Y.J. Wu M.H. Wang N.M. Tsai C.H. Li H. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar, 38Monani U.R. Sendtner M. Coovert D.D. Parsons D.W. Andreassi C. Le T.T. Jablonka S. Schrank B. Rossol W. Prior T.W. Morris G.E. Burghes A.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Histological studies in these mice have confirmed the presence of defects and massive loss of motor neurons in the spinal cord. These findings further demonstrate thatSMN is the disease gene of SMA, but do not reveal the specific functions of SMN. To gain further insight into the function of SMN, we employed the chicken pre-B cell line DT40 to develop a cell-based genetic system (25Wang J. Dreyfuss G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9599-9605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In the conditional SMN knockout cell line S5, the endogenous SMN gene is disrupted by homologous recombination, and the SMN protein is expressed from a cDNA under the control of a tetracycline (tet)-repressible promoter. Depletion of SMN by tet repression results in cell death, indicating that the function of SMN is required for viability of DT40 cells (25Wang J. Dreyfuss G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9599-9605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Using cell viability and proliferation as an indicator, we have set up a functional assay to test whether a given protein can functionally substitute for SMN. Here we determined the role of each domain of SMN in its essential function. To generate missense and deletion mutations, human and chicken SMN cDNAs were used as templates for polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis. Appropriate primers were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Polymerase chain reaction products were digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes and ligated into the retroviral vector pMX (39Burns J.C. Friedmann T. Driever W. Burrascano M. Yee J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8033-8037Crossref PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar). The resulting clones were fully sequenced to confirm each mutation. S5 cells were routinely maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories), 1% chicken serum (Sigma), 2 mml-glutamine, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10 ng/ml tetracycline (Sigma). To deplete SMN, S5 cells were split into medium containing 1 μg/ml tetracycline. Retroviral production and infection were performed essentially as described (25Wang J. Dreyfuss G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9599-9605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). S5 cells rescued by retroviral infections were maintained in medium containing 1 μg/ml tetracycline. Anti-β-tubulin antibody was purchased from Sigma. A rabbit anti-SMN polyclonal antibody and anti-Gemin2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) 2E17 have been described (16Liu Q. Fischer U. Wang F. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1997; 90: 1013-1021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 25Wang J. Dreyfuss G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9599-9605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Anti-SMN mAb 62E7 was generated in our laboratory. The number of cells in each sample was counted prior to protein analysis. A pellet of 1 × 106 cells was lysed in 40 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer. 20 μl of the lysate was loaded on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (18Charroux B. Pellizzoni L. Perkinson R.A. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1181-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The dilutions of antibodies were 1:3000 for anti-β-tubulin antibody, 1:500 for rabbit anti-SMN polysera and mAb 2E17, and 1:1000 for mAb 62E7. To radioactively label cellular proteins, 5 × 106cells were incubated for 6 h in 2 ml of methionine-free RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum, 1% chicken serum, and 40 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 1 μg/ml tetracycline was added to the labeling medium for cells rescued by retroviral infections. Immunoprecipitation of the SMN complex was performed essentially as described (18Charroux B. Pellizzoni L. Perkinson R.A. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1181-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). About 4% of SMA patients retain at least one allele of the SMN1 gene (12Wirth B. Hum. Mutat. 2000; 15: 228-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Intragenic mutations have been found in a few of them. Several missense mutations cluster in and around the highly conserved Y/G box, including S262I, Y272C, T274I, G275S, and G279V (Fig.1). Another missense mutation converts glutamic acid to lysine (E134K) in the Tudor domain of SMN. All these amino acids are conserved between chicken SMN (cSMN) and human SMN (huSMN) (Fig. 1). Among them, Y272C and G279V have been reported to be associated with the most severe form of the disease, type I SMA (12Wirth B. Hum. Mutat. 2000; 15: 228-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). In the S5 cell line, the SMN protein is expressed exclusively from a cSMN cDNA driven by a tet-repressible promoter. Addition of 1 μg/ml tet to the culture medium shuts off the expression and results in depletion of the cSMN protein and consequent cell death. Previously, we have shown that expression of the huSMN protein by retroviral infection completely rescued S5 cells treated with 1 μg/ml tet (25Wang J. Dreyfuss G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9599-9605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Using the same assay, we tested whether the missense mutations mentioned above have deleterious effects on the function of SMN that is required for DT40 cell viability. S5 cells were infected with a retrovirus containing wild-type huSMN cDNA or an huSMN cDNA harboring one missense mutation. Following infection, the cells were incubated with 1 μg/ml tet. The majority of cells from all infections survived and continued to proliferate. Lysates of the rescued cells were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by Western blotting using an anti-SMN antibody (Fig.2). As expected, the cSMN protein, which is smaller than huSMN, was completely depleted in the presence of 1 μg/ml tet and was thus undetectable on the Western blot (also see Fig. 3). The level of each mutant huSMN expressed in the cells was comparable to that of wild-type huSMN. For an unknown reason, huSMN E134K showed a slightly faster migration upon SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The same blot was probed with anti-β-tubulin antibody as a control for equal loading of total protein (Fig. 2). The rescued cells were maintained in medium containing 1 μg/ml tet, and the growth rates of the various cell lines were compared. No significant difference was detected between the cells expressing wild-type and mutant huSMN proteins (data not shown). As a negative control, none of the S5 cells infected with a retrovirus containing an enhanced green fluorescence protein cDNA remained viable after a 1-week incubation with 1 μg/ml tet. We also mutated tyrosine 240 of cSMN to cysteine, which is equivalent to huSMN Y272C (Fig. 1). The mutant cSMN protein rescued the lethal phenotype as efficiently as did wild-type cSMN (data not shown). Taken together, these data indicate that the SMA-associated missense mutations tested here do not have significant effects on the function of SMN, at least as assessed by cell viability.Figure 3Deletion of Ex7 results in a partial loss of function. S5 cells were infected with a retrovirus containing a cDNA encoding cSMN, cSMNΔEx7, huSMN, or huSMNΔEx7 and selected in the presence of 1 μg/ml tet. Viable cells from tet selection were maintained in medium containing 1 μg/ml tet. After cells expressing cSMNΔEx7 or huSMNΔEx7 reached a steady growth rate, lysates of the rescued cells (lanes 2–5) and control S5 cells (lane 1) were analyzed by Western blotting using rabbit anti-SMN polysera. The positions of β-tubulin, cSMN, cSMNΔEx7, huSMN, and huSMNΔEx7 are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Next we asked whether the highly conserved C terminus of SMN is required for SMN activity. To this end, we generated deletion mutants of cSMN and huSMN and tested whether expression of these mutants could rescue the tet-induced lethality as described above. S5 cells were infected with a retrovirus containing a cSMN or an huSMN cDNA deleted of Ex7 (ΔEx7) and subsequently cultured in medium containing 1 μg/ml tet. Viable cells were readily seen after 1 week, indicating that both cSMNΔEx7 and huSMNΔEx7 are functional. However, clear differences were noted when compared with S5 cells infected with a virus containing a full-length SMN cDNA. A large percentage of S5 cells infected with the ΔEx7 virus died during tet treatment, and the remaining viable cells grew poorly. However, the growth rates of ΔEx7-rescued cells gradually increased when maintained in medium containing 1 μg/ml tet. Eventually, cSMNΔEx7-rescued cells reached a steady doubling time of 22 h, whereas the growth pattern of huSMNΔEx7-rescued cells was nearly identical to that of either cSMN- or huSMN-rescued cells, with a doubling time of 16 h. At this point, expression of the full-length protein or ΔEx7 was analyzed by Western blotting using an anti-SMN antibody (Fig.3). As expected, in cSMNΔEx7-rescued cells, only ΔEx7 (but no cSMN) was detected (Fig. 3, lane 3), and the level of ΔEx7 was comparable to that of cSMN in cSMN-rescued cells (compare lanes 2 and 3). Expression of huSMNΔEx7 was more efficient than that of huSMN in the rescued cells (Fig. 3, compare lanes 4 and 5). We also noticed that the gain-of-growth rate of ΔEx7-rescued cells was accompanied by an increase in the ΔEx7 level. Apparently, cells with high expression of the ΔEx7 protein were selected during the course of this experiment. Taken together, these results indicate that deletion of Ex7 results in a partial loss of SMN function and that the partial loss of function is compensated by higher expression of the mutant protein. Deletion of the Y/G box in addition to Ex7 (ΔY/G) (Fig. 1) abolished SMN function, as neither cSMNΔY/G nor huSMNΔY/G restored cell viability in the presence of 1 μg/ml tet. Expression of ΔY/G proteins was confirmed by Western blotting shortly after retroviral infection and tet treatment, when cell death had not yet occurred (data not shown). Thus, the C terminus of SMN including the Y/G box and Ex7 is essential for the function of SMN. Sequences near the N terminus of SMN mediate its interaction with Gemin2 (16Liu Q. Fischer U. Wang F. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1997; 90: 1013-1021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Most, if not all, of the SMN and Gemin2 proteins in cells are bound to each other and exist in a high molecular mass complex, suggesting that Gemin2 is a critical functional partner of SMN. We therefore anticipated that deletion of the Gemin2-binding domain would disrupt the function of SMN. However, S5 cells treated with 1 μg/ml tet were rescued by expression of a mutant cSMN protein (ΔN39) with the first 39 amino acids truncated, including the Gemin2-binding domain and the entire phylogenetically conserved N terminus (Fig. 1). ΔN39-rescued cells showed only a slightly lower growth rate compared with full-length cSMN-rescued cells, but no other obvious abnormality (data not shown). Lysates of S5, cSMN-depleted S5, and cSMN- and ΔN39-rescued cells were analyzed by Western blotting using an anti-SMN antibody (Fig. 4,upper panel). In ΔN39-rescued cells, there was no detectable full-length cSMN, whereas ΔN39 was efficiently expressed (upper panel, lane 4). As we reported previously (25Wang J. Dreyfuss G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9599-9605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), the Gemin2 level was greatly reduced following depletion of SMN (lower panel, lane 2), suggesting that Gemin2 is unstable when not bound with SMN. If ΔN39 indeed does not interact with Gemin2, a similar reduction of Gemin2 would be expected in ΔN39-rescued cells. The same lysates were therefore probed with an anti-Gemin2 antibody (lower panel). As predicted, a significant decrease in the amount of Gemin2 was observed in ΔN39-rescued cells compared with S5 or cSMN-rescued cells (lower panel, lane 4). The extent of this decrease was identical to that found following SMN depletion (lower panel, compare lanes 2 and 4). We also confirmed that ΔN39 did not interact with Gemin2 in anin vitro binding assay (data not shown). Immunoprecipitation of extracts of ΔN39-rescued cells using an anti-SMN antibody failed to copurify Gemin2 and vice versa (see Fig. 7). Therefore, an interaction with Gemin2 is not required for ΔN39 to perform the function of SMN that is essential for viability of DT40 cells.Figure 7SMNΔN39 does not interact with Gemin2 or Sm proteins in vivo.Total proteins of DT40 cells (wt; lanes 2 and5), S5 cells depleted of cSMN (S5-cSMN;lane 1), and S5 cells expressing only ΔN39 (lanes 3 and 6) were radioactively labeled with [35S]methionine and subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) using rabbit anti-SMN polysera (lanes 1–3) or anti-Gemin2 mAb 2E17 (lanes 5 and 6). Immunoprecipitation of DT40 cell extracts by control antibody SP2/O was used as a control for antibody specificity (lane 4). The positions of protein bands of interest and protein molecular mass markers are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The unexpected finding regarding ΔN39 prompted us to investigate whether any other regions of SMN, besides the C terminus, are essential. Internal deletions were generated to remove amino acids 45–76 (ΔK), 85–133 (ΔTudor), or 131–192 (ΔP) of cSMN (Fig. 1). S5 cells were transduced with a retrovirus containing ΔK, ΔP, or ΔTudor cDNA and incubated with 1 μg/ml tet. The majority of cells remained viable after 1 week. The growth rate of the mutant-rescued cells was nearly identical to that of the full-length cSMN-rescued cells. Expression of each mutant cSMN was confirmed by Western blot analysis of lysates of the rescued cells (Fig.5). Thus, despite the fact that the SMN Tudor domain is conserved among vertebrates (although we note that it is entirely absent in the S. pombe Smn protein), our data indicate that it is functionally dispensable. On the other hand, it is not surprising that the poorly conserved region covering either amino acids 45–76 or 131–192 is not essential for SMN function. Biochemical studies have demonstrated that huSMN is a component of a large multimeric complex in vivo, which also contains Gemin2, Gemin3, and Gemin4 as well as associated proteins including the Sm proteins (16Liu Q.

https://openalex.org/W1973920571,"Cholesterol accumulation in an aberrant endosomal/lysosomal compartment is the hallmark of Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease. To gain insight into the etiology of the NPC compartment, we studied a novel Chinese hamster ovary cell mutant that was identified through a genetic screen and phenocopies the NPC1 mutation. We show that the M87 mutant harbors a mutation in a gene distinct from the NPC1 and HE1/NPC2 disease genes. M87 cells have increased total cellular cholesterol with accumulation in an aberrant compartment that contains LAMP-1, LAMP-2, and NPC1, but not CI-MPR, similar to the cholesterol-rich compartment in NPC mutant cells. We demonstrate that low-density lipoprotein receptor activity is increased 3-fold in the M87 mutant, and likely contributes to accumulation of excess cholesterol. In contrast to NPC1-null cells, the M87 mutant exhibits normal rates of delivery of endosomal cholesterol to the endoplasmic reticulum and to the plasma membrane. The preserved late endosomal function in the M87 mutant is associated with the presence of NPC1-containing multivesicular late endosomes and supports a role for these multivesicular late endosomes in the sorting and distribution of cholesterol. Our findings implicate cholesterol overload in the formation of an NPC-like compartment that is independent of inhibition of NPC1 or HE1/NPC2 function."

We show here that Pus1p becomes essential when another tRNA:pseudouridine synthase, Pus4p, or the essential minor tRNA for glutamine are mutated. Strikingly, this mutant tRNA, which carries a mismatch in the TψC arm, displays a nuclear export defect. Furthermore, nuclear export of at least one wild-type tRNA species becomes defective in the absence of Pus1p. Our data, thus, show that the modifications formed by Pus1p are essential when other aspects of tRNA biogenesis or function are compromised and suggest that impairment of nuclear tRNA export in the absence of Pus1p might contribute to this phenotype.

Crain P.F. McCloskey J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 196-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). The modifications have been implicated in a plethora of physiological functions, e.g. discrimination of tRNAs as in the case of initiator and elongator tRNAMet, efficiency and accuracy of aminoacylation and codon recognition, and extension or restriction of wobble base pairing (reviewed in Refs. 2Björk G.R. Söll D. RajBhandary U.L. tRNA: Structure, Biosynthesis, and Function. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995: 165-205Google Scholar and 3Agris P.F. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol.

Some tRNA modifications, e.g. m1G at position 37 or pseudouridine (ψ) at position 55 seem to be universal, as they are found in a similar subset or all of the tRNAs from all three kingdoms of life (5Sprinzl M. Horn C. Brown M. Ioudovitch A. Steinberg S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 148-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). These modifications might thus be important for basic functions of the translational apparatus (for a discussion, see Ref.6Björk G.R. Jacobsson K. Nilsson K. Johansson M.J. Bystrom A.S. Persson O.P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Other modifications are only found in a subset of organisms, such as ψs at positions 34–36 (the anticodon) or 26–28, which are found only in eukaryotic tRNAs, or 2′-O-ribosyl phosphate, which occurs only in plant and fungal intiator tRNAMet (1Rozenski J. Crain P.F. McCloskey J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 196-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). These modifications might, consequently, serve more specific functions. Intriguingly, Pus1p, the enzyme that introduces ψs at positions 26–28, 34–36, 65, and 67 (7, 8) was identified through its genetic interaction with the tRNA nuclear export machinery (7Simos G. Tekotte H. Grosjean H. Segref A. Sharma K. Tollervey D. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2270-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). A mutation in the PUS1 gene is lethal when combined with mutations in theLOS1 gene encoding a karyopherin-type nuclear export receptor and the NSP1 gene coding for a nucleoporin. A combined disruption of the PUS1 and LOS1 genes causes lethality at increased temperature. These strong genetic interactions and the nuclear localization of Pus1p led to the proposal that Pus1p might be somehow involved in nuclear tRNA export (7Simos G. Tekotte H. Grosjean H. Segref A. Sharma K. Tollervey D. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2270-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Nuclear export of tRNA in yeast is mediated by Los1p, a member of the importin (or karyopherin) β family of transport receptors (Refs.9Groβhans H. Hurt E. Simos G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 830-840PubMed Google Scholar, 10Hellmuth K. Lau D.M. Bischoff F.R. Künzler M. Hurt E.C. Simos G. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 2000; 129: 288-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Like other members of the karyopherin family Los1p was found to exhibit increased affinity toward its cargo in the presence of the GTP-bound form of the small GTPase Ran (10Hellmuth K. Lau D.M. Bischoff F.R. Künzler M. Hurt E.C. Simos G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6374-6386Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Formation of a trimeric export complex consisting of Los1p, Ran-GTP, and tRNA is, thus, thought to occur in the nucleus where the Ran-GTP concentration is high due to the presence of RanGEF (guanosine nucleotide exchange factor). After translocation through the nuclear pore complex, cytoplasmic RanGAP (GTPase-activating protein) would trigger dissociation of this complex through the conversion of Ran-GTP to Ran-GDP. The fact that Los1p is not essential for cell viability (13Hurt D.J. Wang S.S., Yu- Huei L. Hopper A.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1208-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and that absence of Los1p leads to nuclear accumulation of only a subset of tRNAs (9Groβhans H. Hurt E. Simos G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 830-840PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that an alternative nuclear tRNA export pathway exists in yeast. Recently, aminoacylation and the translation elongation factor eEF-1A were identified as components of such an alternative export pathway (9Groβhans H. Hurt E. Simos G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 830-840PubMed Google Scholar, 14Sarkar S. Azad A.K. Hopper A.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14366-14371Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 15Lund E.

Cell. 2001; 12: 1381-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In this study we show that Pus1p is genetically linked to the pseudouridine synthase Pus4p. Moreover, we find that Pus1p becomes indispensable for cell viability in the presence of defects in the minor tRNAGln (anticodon CUG). Strikingly, the mutation rendering this tRNA synthetically lethal with the pus1mutation also impairs its nuclear export. Moreover, absence of Pus1p impairs nuclear export of a wild-type tRNA, minor tRNAIle(UAU). Our data, thus, suggest that Pus1p-dependent tRNA modification might facilitate efficient nuclear export of specific tRNAs. The yeast strains used in this study are shown in Table I. The plasmids listed in Table II were previously described or constructed as follows: pHT4467-PUS1 was prepared by cloning a 2.2-kilobase XbaI fragment containingPUS1 from pUN100-PUS1 into pHT4467 (7Simos G. Tekotte H. Grosjean H. Segref A. Sharma K. Tollervey D. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2270-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). To obtain pUN100-TEF1 TEF1 was released bySnaBI/Eco47I from YEp352-TEF1 (ref. 9Groβhans H. Hurt E. Simos G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 830-840PubMed Google Scholar), theEco47I overhang filled in, and the fragment inserted into pUN100 cut SmaI. tQ(CUG)M was amplified as a 0.4-kilobase fragment using primers tQ(CUG)M-For (TTT GGA TCC GAG AGC TTC TAC TAT AAA CC; BamHI) and tQ(CUG)M-Rev (TTT TCT AGA AGT ATA TCG AGA TGA GCG AT;XbaI) and ligated into pUN100 cut BamHI andXbaI to yield pUN100-tQ. pUN100-tQ* harbors the C50U mutation in tQ(CUG)M and was amplified using the same primers as for the wild-type gene, but slc58 genomic DNA was used as template. The resulting fragment was phosphorylated and ligated into pUN100 cut PvuII. PUS4 was subcloned as a 3.3-kilobase PstI fragment from a plasmid containing the appropriate genomic DNA into pRS315 likewise cut PstI to yield pRS315-PUS4. The plasmids carrying the synthetic genes of yeast tRNAAsp and of yeast tRNATrp downstream of the T7 promoter were as described in Ref. 8Motorin Y. Keith G. Simon C. Foiret D. Simos G. Hurt E. Grosjean H. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 856-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar. The gene of the yeast tRNAGln (anticodon CUG) and the corresponding mutant C50U were amplified by PCR1 from the corresponding sequence present in the plasmids pUN100-tQ and pUN100-tQ* described in Table II using two complementary oligonucleotides, one bearing a T7 promoter sequence and the other the restriction site MvaI. The resulting PCR product was purified by electrophoresis on an agarose gel and used as template for T7 polymerase reactions (see below).Table IYeast strainsStrainGenotypeRef.Ba , his3, ura3, ade2, ade3, pus1∷HIS3This studyCα, his3, ura3, ade2, ade3, pus1∷HIS3This studyslb18a, his3, ura3, ade2, ade3, pus1∷HIS3 pus4 <URA3, ADE3, PUS1>This studyslc58α, his3, ura3, ade2, ade3, pus1∷HIS3This studytQ*(CUG)M <URA3, ADE3, PUS1CH1462α, leu2, his3, ura3, ade2, ade347Kranz J.E.

E. coli tRNA does not compete with the probes directed against yeast tRNA (data not shown). Hybridization reactions were performed in hybridization buffer containing 50% formamide with probes at 4 pmol/μl at 37 °C overnight. The described probes (9Groβhans H. Hurt E. Simos G.

This probe weakly cross-reacts with the major tRNAGln in Northern analysis (data not shown); however, shorter probes yielded insufficient signal for fluorescence microscopy. DNA was stained with 50 ng/ml DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride) and slides mounted with Mowiol. Total RNA was extracted from yeast cells as described previously (17Sharma K.

Hybridization with radioactively labeled oligonucleotides having identical sequences with the probes used for FISH was performed at 37 °C in 6 × SSPE (900 mmNaCl, 60 mm NaH2PO4, 0.3 mm EDTA) overnight. Acidic extraction of tRNA and separation of tRNA on an acidic urea gel to determine aminoacylation status were done as described previously (18Varshney U. Lee C.P. RajBhandary U.L. J. Biol.

In vitro T7-polymerase transcription using one of the four nucleoside triphosphates α-32P-radiolabeled and purification of the resulting selectively radiolabeled T7 run-off tRNA transcripts by urea gels were performed as described elsewhere (19Jiang H.Q.

After the incubation time (as indicated in the graphs or the legends of figures), reactions were stopped by addition of phenol:chloroform. The phenol-extracted RNA were precipitated with ethanol and redissolved in appropriate buffer for further hydrolysis with nuclease P1 or RNase T2. Each hydrolysate was chromatographed in two dimensions on thin-layer cellulose plates. Nucleotide identification in each spot was achieved by comparison with standard maps and the corresponding radioactivity was evaluated (for details, see Refs. 8Motorin Y. Keith G. Simon C. Foiret D.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2694-2701Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Screening strains B and C, bothpus1::HIS3 but of opposite mating type, were prepared by mating the previously described strain Y572 to CH1462 and subsequent tetrad dissection. These strains are red in the presence of pHT4467-PUS1 (the resulting relevant genotype beingade2 − ADE3), and white after its loss. Strains were plated on YPD plates supplemented with 4% glucose, irradiated with UV light to a survival rate of ∼5%, and ∼75,000 surviving colonies screened for all red colonies without white sectors, indicative of the inability to lose plasmid pHT4467-PUS1. This was confirmed by the cells' inability to grow on plates containing FOA,i.e. selecting against the URA3 gene product. Strains that after transformation with pUN100-PUS1 were able to grow in the presence of FOA and displayed white sectors within the red colony, indicating the regained ability to lose pHT4467-PUS1, were further analyzed. Four sl mutants were found in this screen, two of which have been cloned and are the subject of this publication. Sl mutants were complemented by transformation with a previously described yeast genomic library on a low copy number plasmid (22Bergès T. Petfalski E. Tollervey D. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3136-3148Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Clones were scored positive when colonies displayed a red/white sectoring phenotype and grew in the presence of FOA. Western analysis of cell extracts from positive clones using a polyclonal antibody against Pus1p revealed clones producing this protein; these were subsequently discarded. Plasmids were recovered from the remaining clones and sequenced when appropriate. TEF1 and TEF2 genes were initially identified through sequencing of complementing plasmids but found to be suppressing rather than complementing the various slmutations. In later complementation experiments these plasmids were identified and discarded prior to the sequencing step through restriction analysis and complementation of atef1 − tef2 −double mutant strain (9Groβhans H. Hurt E. Simos G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 830-840PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids with the following genomic inserts were obtained (those containing TEF1 or TEF2 are not listed): slb18: chromosome XIV, 71400–84274, and 81414–93176; slc58: chromosome XIII and 803816–817190. Subcloning established the identity of the respective complementing activity. Cells were examined using a Zeiss Axioskop fluorescence microscope equipped with a Xillix Microimager CCD camera. Data were processed using the Improvision Openlab and Adobe Photoshop softwares. All experiments were performed on exponentially growing cells. All shifts to 37 °C were performed in rich glucose-containing medium (YPD). DNA manipulations such as restriction analysis, PCR amplification, and ligation were performed according to standard protocols (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.T. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Pus1p was previously identified through its genetic interaction with NSP1 (a nucleoporin) and LOS1 (a tRNA nuclear export receptor) (7Simos G. Tekotte H. Grosjean H. Segref A. Sharma K. Tollervey D. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2270-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The function of Pus1p-dependent tRNA modification, however, remained unclear. To clarify this issue, we sought to identify additional interaction partners of Pus1p through a synthetic lethality screen using a strain lacking Pus1p. This sl screen (for details, see “Materials and Methods”) yielded four mutants that are inviable in the absence of Pus1p. Two mutants, slc58 andslb18, have been characterized and are subject of this study. Transformation of slb18 cells with a yeast genomic library yielded several plasmids that restored viability in the absence of pURA-PUS1. Sequencing and subcloning revealed that the PUS4gene complemented the sl mutant (Fig.1 A). PUS4 codes for another pseudouridine synthase, which was discovered through its sequence homology to the bacterial enzyme truB (20Becker H.F. Motorin Y. Planta R.J. Grosjean H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4493-4499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Like the latter, Pus4p converts U55 to ψ55, a modification that is found in all sequenced tRNAs from all three kingdoms. Similar toPUS1, PUS4 is not required for cell viability under standard laboratory experimental conditions (20Becker H.F. Motorin Y. Planta R.J. Grosjean H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4493-4499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To show directly that Pus4p activity was affected in theslb18 mutant we analyzed the enzymatic activities of yeast cell extracts. In vitro transcribed yeast tRNATrp and tRNAAsp were used as substrates to test the formation of ψ27 and ψ55, respectively, as described (8Motorin Y. Keith G. Simon C. Foiret D. Simos G. Hurt E. Grosjean H. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 856-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Fig. 1, B and C, show that extracts fromslb18 cells carrying a PUS1-containing plasmid efficiently formed the Pus1p-dependent ψ27 in tRNATrp, whereas no formation of the Pus4p-dependent ψ55 was observed in tRNAAsp. The reverse was observed when cell extracts were prepared fromslb18 cells with a PUS4-containing but noPUS1-containing plasmid: ψ55 was efficiently formed, while no formation of ψ27 was observed. Finally, both ψ55 and ψ27 were quantitatively formed in extracts from cells carrying both plasmids containing PUS1 and PUS4. Our data, thus, clearly show that slb18 cells lack Pus4p activity. To generate a synthetically lethal interaction of PUS1 andPUS4 in a defined way, haploid pus1 −and pus4 − cells were mated and tetrads dissected after sporulation. After incubation at 30 °C several incomplete tetrads were observed, and analysis of the genetic markers revealed that the missing spores were the pus1 − pus4 − double mutant cells (Fig. 1 D). However, also slow growing pus1 − pus4 − haploid could be recovered, which exhibit a ts phenotype at 37 °C (Fig. 1 E). We conclude that combined absence of Pus1p and Pus4p severely impair cell viability, the extent of this effect depending on the genetic background. This observation suggests that the functionality of some or all of the resulting under-modified tRNAs is significantly reduced. The second sl mutant obtained in the screen, slc58, was complemented by the essential yeast gene coding for minor tRNAGln(CUG), tQ(CUG)M (in the following abbreviated tQ; Fig.2 A) (24Edelman I. Culbertson M.R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1481-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 25Lin J.P. Aker M. Sitney K.C. Mortimer R.K. Gene (Amst.). 1986; 49: 383-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 26Weiss W.A. Edelman I. Culbertson M.R. Friedberg E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8031-8034Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Interestingly,slc58 mutant cells were inviable at 37 °C, and thists phenotype was complemented by a plasmid harboringtQ but not by PUS1 (Fig. 2 B). To find out how Pus1p and minor tRNAGln(CUG) are functionally linked, we performed Northern blot analysis on total RNA extracted from wild-type and slc58 mutant cells. We observed a significant reduction of tRNAGln(CUG) levels when we compared the mutant to the wild-type situation (Fig.3 A). This effect was even more pronounced when RNA was analyzed that had been extracted fromslc58 cells grown at elevated temperature. Other tRNAs such as the major tRNAGln(UUG) appeared to be unaffected. The reduction in minor tRNAGln(CUG) levels suggested that its stability might be negatively affected by a mutation. We examined this possibility through amplification of the tQ gene by PCR on genomic DNA prepared from slc58 mutant cells. Direct sequencing of the PCR product revealed a single nucleotide exchange in this tRNA, which occurred in the TψC arm (Fig. 3 B), thus agreeing with the idea of reduced tRNA stability. Fully matured tRNAGln(CUG) has not yet been sequenced, only the tDNA sequence is known (24Edelman I. Culbertson M.R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1481-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 25Lin J.P. Aker M. Sitney K.C. Mortimer R.K. Gene (Amst.). 1986; 49: 383-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 26Weiss W.A. Edelman I. Culbertson M.R. Friedberg E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8031-8034Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was not clear whether this tRNA was a substrate of the pseudouridine synthase Pus1p, although the presence of thymidines in the genomic sequence at positions 26 through 28 (Fig. 3 B), i.e. at sites where Pus1p acts (8Motorin Y. Keith G. Simon C. Foiret D. Simos G. Hurt E. Grosjean H. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 856-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), strongly suggested so. We, therefore, analyzed the activity of recombinant purified Pus1p on this tRNA produced byin vitro transcription. Efficient formation of ψ was observed at positions 26 + 27 and 28 in both the wild-type and the mutant tRNAGln (Fig. 3 B, notice that our assay cannot resolve whether ψ26 or ψ27 or both is formed; however, from our earlier results (8Motorin Y. Keith G. Simon C. Foiret D. Simos G. Hurt E. Grosjean H. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 856-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) we know that Pus1p does not easily catalyze ψ26 in vitro, so that the value indicated in the figure for positions 26 + 27 probably represents the value for ψ27). ψ28 formation was slightly less efficient for the mutant than the wild-type tRNA. We next examined how other tRNA modification reactions might be affected by the C50U mutation in vitro. Three more pseudouridine synthases were available to us as pure recombinant proteins: Pus3p catalyzing the formation of ψ38 and ψ39, Pus4p catalyzing the formation of ψ55, and Pus8p catalyzing the formation of ψ32 (20Becker H.F. Motorin Y. Planta R.J. Grosjean H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4493-4499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Lecointe F. Simos G. Sauer A. Hurt E.C. Motorin Y. Grosjean H. J. Biol.

In addition, using S10 cell extracts we could analyze formation of two AdoMet-dependent methylations, m5U54=T54 and m1A58. The data obtained through this analysis are summarized in Fig. 3, B and C. Clearly, all the modifications that were found in the wild-type are also formed in the mutant tRNA. However, efficiencies are generally lower as determined by the amount of tRNA modified after 1-h incubation under identical conditions. The only exception is ψ13, whose formation is slightly more efficient in the mutant tRNA than in the wild-type tRNAGln. These results thus show that the mutant tRNA is still a good substrate for various modification enzymes in vitro. However, our data also indicate the possibility that the mutant tRNAGln might be under-modified in vivo. Indeed, it is possible that under-modification rather than the mutationper se might cause Pus1p to become essential in this mutant. The structural integrity of a tRNA has been shown to be important for its nuclear export in the Xenopus oocyte system (28Lipowsky G. Bischoff F.R. Izaurralde E. Kutay U. Schäfer S. Gross H.J. Beier H. Görlich D. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 539-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 29Tobian J.A. Drinkard L. Zasloff M. Cell. 1985; 43: 415-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In particular, it has been shown that the TψC arm is an important determinant for the interaction of a tRNA with the nuclear export machinery (28Lipowsky G. Bischoff F.R. Izaurralde E. Kutay U. Schäfer S. Gross H.J. Beier H. Görlich D. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 539-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We therefore performed FISH analysis onslc58 cells to examine the distribution of the mutated tRNA. As tRNAGln(CUG) is encoded by a single gene (30Hani J. Feldmann H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 689-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), we observed only a weak signal for this tRNA in wild-type cells (data not shown). Clearly, however, the signal distribution paralleled that previously seen for other tRNAs, i.e. a cytoplasmic signal that is largely excluded from nucleus and vacuole (data not shown). In agreement with the Northern blot results (Fig. 3 A),slc58 cells displayed an even weaker signal for minor tRNAGln (data not shown). In addition to this quantitative difference, a major change in signal distribution was observed with a significant number of the mutant cells displaying nuclear accumulation of the tRNA (Fig. 4 A). This phenotype became more evident when the amount of the mutated tRNA was increased by introduction of a low copy plasmid harboring the mutant tRNAGln allele into slc58 cells (Fig.4 A). Under these conditions, the tRNAGln amounts in the mutant are still below those in wild-type cells as evidenced by fluorescence intensities (data not shown), suggesting that the improved visibility of nuclear accumulation is not an artifact due to overexpression of the mutant tRNA. Indeed, when we localized another tRNA, tRNAGly(GCC), under the same conditions, it was distributed normally, i.e. the signal was excluded from the nucleus (Fig. 4 B). Other mutations in tRNAGln(CUG) have been published, G31A (designated sup70–65) and G68A (sup70–33; Ref.31Murray L.E. Rowley N. Dawes I.W. Johnston G.C. Singer R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8619-8624Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Unlike the C50U mutation, however, these mutations do not lead to nuclear accumulation. 4H. Großhans, E. Hurt, and G. Simos, unpublished observations. Our data, thus, indicate that the mutation in the TψC arm specifically affects nuclear export of the minor tRNAGln(CUG). It is,"

ICOS binds to a newly identified ligand on antigen presenting cells different from the CD152 ligands CD80 and CD86. We used soluble ICOSIg and a newly developed murine anti-human ICOS ligand (ICOSL) monoclonal antibody to further characterize the ICOSL during ontogeny of antigen presenting cells. In a previous study, we found that ICOSL is expressed on monocytes, dendritic cells, and B cells. To define when ICOSL is first expressed on myeloid antigen presenting cells, we examined ICOSL expression on CD34+ cells in bone marrow. We found that CD34bright cells regardless of their myeloid commitment were ICOSL−, whereas ICOSL was first expressed when CD34 expression diminished and the myeloid marker CD33 appeared. However, acute myeloid leukemia cells were ICOSL-negative, whereas among B-cell malignancies only some cases of the most mature tumors such as prolymphocytic leukemia and hairy cell leukemia were positive. Next, we investigated purified CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells that did not constitutively express ICOSL but were induced to express ICOSL within 12 h after granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor/tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) stimulation. Interestingly, ICOSL was induced prior to CD80/CD86 induction on CD34+cells so that ICOSL was expressed in the absence of CD80/CD86. This suggests that ICOSL is an early differentiation marker along the monocytic/dendritic maturation pathway. Induction of ICOSL was dependent on TNF-α and was regulated via NF-κB as revealed by use of inhibitors specific for IκBα phosphorylation such as BAY 11-7082 and BAY 11-7085. The antigen presenting capacity of TNF-α stimulated CD34+ cells was strongly inhibited by ICOSIg fusion proteins or by NF-κB inhibition. Thus, TNF-α-induced ICOSL expression seemed to be functionally important for the costimulatory capacity of CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells.

During this process, CD28 or CD152 (CTLA-4) expressed on T cells is engaged by the ligands CD80 (B7-1) or CD86 (B7-2) expressed on antigen presenting cells (1Slavik J.M. Hutchcroft J.E. Bierer B.E.

The inducible costimulator (ICOS) is a recently defined third member of the CD28 family, but unlike CD28, it is not constitutively expressed on T cells (3Hutloff A. Dittrich A.M. Beier K.C.

ICOS expression requires the activation of T cells via the TCR·CD3 complex. ICOS shows structural homology to CD28 and CD152, but it differs in the MYPPPY homology domain necessary for binding of CD28/CD152 to CD80 or CD86 (4Peach R.J. Bajorath J. Brady W. Leytze G.

Instead, ICOS up-regulates expression of IL-4, IL-5, GM-CSF, IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-10 (3Hutloff A. Dittrich A.M. Beier K.C. Eljaschewitsch B. Kraft R. Anagnostopoulos I. Kroczek R.A.

The expression of ICOS on T cells varies depending on the source of lymphoid tissue; T cells in tonsillar germinal centers express high levels of ICOS, suggesting a role in the regulation of germinal center B cell differentiation (3Hutloff A.

Among the ligands of the CD28 receptor family, CD80 is expressed on antigen presenting cells after induction by microbes, cytokines, or CD40 ligation and is also expressed on fibroblasts, whereas CD86 is constitutively expressed on monocytes and is inducible upon stimulation (8McAdam A.J. Schweitzer A.N. Sharpe A.H. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 165: 231-247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most lymphoma and leukemia cells lack CD80, but ∼50% of cases express CD86 (9Zheng Z. Takahashi M. Aoki S.

In addition, it appears that ICOS stimulation also has a prominent role in secondary cytotoxic CD8+ T cell responses, leading to effective mobilization of adoptively transferred T cells (20Wallin J.J.

Allophycocyanin (APC)- or phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated monoclonal antibodies against CD1a (SK9), CD3 (SK7), CD4 (SK3), CD11c (S-HCL-3), CD13 (L138), CD14 (MΦP9), CD15 (MMA), CD19 (4G7), CD20 (L27), CD22 (S-HCL-1), CD33 (P67.6), CD34 (8G12), CD38 (HB-7), CD56 (My31), CD80 (L307.4), HLA-DR (L243), and isotype control mAb (MOPC-21) were purchased from Becton Dickinson (Heidelberg, Germany). Antibodies against CD83 (HB15a) and CD86 (FUN-1) were from Coulter Immunotech and PharMingen (both Hamburg, Germany), respectively. The ICOSIg and CD152Ig fusion proteins were produced as described previously (7Aicher A. Hayden-Ledbetter M. Brady W.A. Pezzutto A. Richter G. Magaletti D. Buckwalter S. Ledbetter J.A. Clark E.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 4689-4696Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Briefly, stable Chinese hamster ovary lines expressing ICOSIg or CD152Ig were grown in Excell 302 Chinese hamster ovary media (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS) containing 0.5 mg/ml recombinant insulin (Life Technologies, Inc.), sodium pyruvate (Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA), 4 mm l-glutamine (Irvine Scientific), 23 nonessential amino acids for minimal essential medium (Irvine Scientific), and 100 nm methotrexate (Sigma). Spent supernatants were harvested from large scale cultures, and Ig fusion proteins were purified by protein A affinity chromatography over a 2-ml protein A-agarose column (Repligen, Cambridge, MA). Fusion protein was eluted from the column as 0.8-ml fractions in 0.1 m citrate buffer (pH 2.7) and neutralized using 100 ml of 1 mTris-HCl (pH 7.4). Eluted fractions were assayed for absorbance at 280 nm, and fractions containing fusion protein were pooled, dialyzed overnight in several liters of PBS (pH 7.4), and filter-sterilized through 0.2-μm syringe filter units (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Staining capacity was tested by serial dilutions on U937 cells that have been shown to be positive for ICOSIg and CD152Ig binding. Optimal staining was usually obtained with 1–2 μg of fusion protein/106 cells. Bone marrow cells were collected after informed consent from patients with breast cancer or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma undergoing evaluation for bone marrow involvement and found to be negative. Cells were isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque (Seromed, Berlin, Germany) density gradient centrifugation. Interphases were harvested and washed three times and subjected directly to flow cytometry analysis. For positive selection of T cells, B cells, and CD33+ and CD34+ cells from bone marrow, cells were labeled with anti-CD3 mAb (SK7), anti-CD19 mAb (HD37), anti-CD33 mAb (P67.6), or anti-CD34 (My10), respectively and then positively selected with goat anti-mouse IgG immunomagnetic beads according to the manufacturer's instructions (Dynal, Hamburg, Germany). Purity was greater than 95%, as assessed by flow cytometry. For purification of CD34+ cells for dendritic cell differentiation assays, mononuclear cells were collected by leukapheresis from peripheral blood of breast cancer patients in the context of a high dose chemotherapy program using an AS104 cell separator (Fresenius, Wiesbaden, Germany). CD34+ cells were enriched by use of an Isolex 300 device (Baxter Biotech, München, Germany) as described previously (23Mapara M.Y. Körner I.J. Hildebrandt M. Bargou R. Krahl D. Reichardt P. Dörken B. Blood. 1997; 89: 337-344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The positively selected cell fraction (purity > 90%) was cryopreserved and stored within the vapor phase of liquid nitrogen. For stimulation CD34+ cells were plated in six-well Nunclon plates (Nunc, Naperville, IL) at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml in 2 ml of RPMI 1640 medium with l-glutamine, 2-mercaptoethanol, antibiotics, and 10% fetal calf serum. Culture medium was supplemented with different cytokines at the following concentrations depending on the stimulation mixture used: 100 ng/ml human GM-CSF (Leukomax®, Novartis), 1000 units/ml human IL-4 (kindly provided by Dr. Satwant Narula, Schering Plough Research Institute, Kenilworth, NJ), 50 ng/ml human TNF-α (Bender, Vienna, Austria), and 1000 units/ml human IL-3 (R&D Systems, Wiesbaden, Germany). Every other day, 50% of the medium was removed and the same volume of fresh medium containing twice the amount of cytokines was added. Cells were analyzed at different time points for differentiation markers and for ICOSIg or CD152Ig binding. Responder T cells for the MLR were obtained from normal donors after centrifugation over Ficoll-Hypaque and subsequent positive selection via CD4 positive isolation kit with immunomagnetic beads according to the manufacturer's instructions (Dynal). To induce ICOS expression, CD4+ T cells (purity > 95%) were preactivated before use in the MLR by soluble anti-CD3 (OKT3, Ortho Pharmaceuticals, Raritan, NJ) for 12 h at 37 °C at a concentration that does not induce proliferation (0.5 μg/ml). MLRs were set up by culturing 5 × 103 γ-irradiated CD34+ cells (3,000 rad 137Cs) that had been precultivated for 12 h under the conditions indicated in the results, with 5 × 104 prestimulated CD4+T cells. Cells were cocultured in 96-well round-bottom microtiter plates for 3 days. T cell proliferation was assessed after addition of 1 μCi/well [3H]-thymidine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Freiburg, Germany) for the final 9 h. [3H]-Thymidine incorporation was measured by liquid scintillation counting. All determinations were performed in triplicate and measured as the mean counts/min ± S.E. Tumor cells were obtained after informed consent from freshly diagnosed or cryopreserved samples of patients with acute and chronic leukemia or follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma undergoing routine phenotype analysis. All lymphoma cases were leukemic, and cell populations contained at least 75% neoplastic cells according to FACS analysis. Lymphoma diagnoses had been independently confirmed by routine histology; acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, hairy cell leukemia, and prolymphocytic leukemia cases had been diagnosed by a combination of standard morphology, histochemistry, and phenotype analysis. All the AML cases were positive for CD13 and/or CD33; all B cell leukemias and lymphomas were positive for CD19. For reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), cells were lysed in Trizol® (Life Technologies, Karlsruhe, Germany), RNA prepared and converted to first strand cDNA by use of random hexamer or oligo(dT) primers and murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Weiterstadt, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Success of cDNA synthesis was monitored by PCR with β2-microglobulin-specific primers 5′-CCAGCAGAGAATGGAAAGTC-3′ and 5′-GATGCTGCTTACATGTCTCG-3′, amplifying after 27 cycles a PCR product of 268 base pairs in size. Primers used for analysis of ICOSL expression were derived from B7-H2 sequence (GenBank™ accession no. AF289028; Ref. 13Wang S. Zhu G. Chapoval A.I. Dong H. Tamada K. Ni J. Chen L. Blood. 2000; 96: 2808-2813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and were 5′-GGTTACACTGCATGTGGCAGC-3′ and 5′-GTGAGCTCCGGTCAAACGTGG-3′. PCR synthesis was run for 40 cycles, amplifying a 534-base pair product. For isolation of nuclear proteins, 2 × 106 CD34+ cells were washed in cold PBS before addition of 200 μl of cold low salt buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μm leupeptin). After a 15-min incubation on ice, 12 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40 was added and samples were vortexed. Nuclei were spun down and resuspended in 25 μl of high salt buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 25% (v/v) glycerol, 0.4 mNaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μm leupeptin). For extraction of proteins, samples were vigorously rocked at 4 °C for 20 min. After subsequent centrifugation, nuclear extracts were collected as supernatants and stored at −80 °C until use. The NF-κB oligonucleotide (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany) was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in the presence of T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega, Mannheim, Germany). Unincorporated [γ-32P]ATP was removed by a NICK™ Sephadex column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Binding reactions were performed for 30 min on ice with 3 μg of protein and 20,000 cpm of radiolabeled NF-κB oligonucleotide in 20 μl of binding buffer (4% Ficoll, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). The DNA-protein complexes were then separated from unbound oligonucleotides on nondenaturing 4.5% polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× TBE buffer, fixed, and analyzed using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). As described previously (7Aicher A. Hayden-Ledbetter M. Brady W.A. Pezzutto A. Richter G. Magaletti D. Buckwalter S. Ledbetter J.A. Clark E.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 4689-4696Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), cells were incubated in staining buffer (2% fetal calf serum in PBS, 0.05% NaN3), nonspecific Fc-binding was blocked by preincubation with mouse anti-human CD32 F(ab′)2 antibody (Ancell, Bayport, MN) at 1 μg/ml for 30 min at 4 °C. When evaluating AML cells, it was important to use human Ig to block nonspecific Fc receptor binding, as CD32 antibody treatment was not sufficient because of high expression of other Fc receptors in AML cells. After Fc blocking, cells were washed once in staining buffer and incubated 45 min on ice with 10 μg/ml Ig fusion protein. Cells were again washed once with binding buffer and subsequently incubated with second step reagent FITC-conjugated goat anti-human IgG F(ab′)2(Jackson) at 1:50 dilution for 45 min on ice. Finally cells were washed three times in staining buffer, resuspended in PBS, and analyzed on a FACScalibur (Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany). For staining of DC generated from CD34+ cells, APC- and/or PE-conjugated mAbs directed against CD1a, CD3, CD4, CD11c, CD14, CD15, CD33, CD34, CD38, CD54, CD58, CD80, CD83, CD86, HLA-DR, and their corresponding isotype controls (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA) were used. In addition, for two/three-color immunofluorescence of bone marrow and CD34+ cells, cells were preblocked with 50 μg/ml human Ig (Biotest Pharma, Dreieich, Germany) instead of CD32 antibody and stained with a murine mAb against the extracellular domain of human ICOSL developed with the help of Genovac (Freiburg, Germany). Previously, we found that the ligand of ICOS (ICOSL) is expressed on antigen presenting cells of myeloid origin and on ∼40% of peripheral blood CD19+ B cells (7Aicher A. Hayden-Ledbetter M. Brady W.A. Pezzutto A. Richter G. Magaletti D. Buckwalter S. Ledbetter J.A. Clark E.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 4689-4696Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In this study we wanted to determine whether ICOSL is expressed early during ontogeny of myeloid antigen presenting cells. Human bone marrow mononuclear cells were isolated and stained with mouse anti-human ICOSL mAb followed by goat anti-mouse FITC, and then counterstained with APC- and PE-conjugated mAb. Fig. 1 shows the staining of ICOSL on CD34-positive cells according to their CD33 expression. When gating on the small lymphoid cells in the bone marrow (Fig. 1 A, upper part), almost all cells were ICOSL-negative. Only a few cells in this population coexpress CD33. In total bone marrow, a large proportion of the CD34+ cells coexpressed CD33 (Fig. 1 A, lower half). Only the CD34dullCD33+fraction (R9 in Fig. 1 A) showed some staining for ICOSL (25 ± 4%), suggesting that ICOSL expression is acquired as soon as hematopoietic progenitor cells have a clear myeloid commitment, as indicated by strong CD33 expression and beginning loss of CD34 antigen expression. The amount of CD34+CD38−cells in our preparations was too small to allow for a clear evaluation of ICOSL expression on this fraction of more primitive hematopoietic precursor cells (data not shown). We also examined ICOSL expression on purified bone marrow fractions by RT-PCR. We isolated bone marrow cells according to their expression of CD34 and lineage markers for B cells, T cells, and myeloid cells by immunomagnetic separation for CD34, CD19, CD3, and CD33, respectively. Primers for RT-PCR were designed from the sequence of the B7-H2 gene to which protein binding of ICOSIg recently has been shown (13Wang S. Zhu G. Chapoval A.I. Dong H. Tamada K. Ni J. Chen L. Blood. 2000; 96: 2808-2813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Calibrated cDNA of purified cell populations (see “Experimental Procedures”) confirmed the lack or very weak expression in the CD34bright fraction that was isolated and revealed a clear presence of the ICOSL transcript in the CD33+ myeloid cells and in the CD19+ B cell population, consistent with the ICOSL expression on peripheral blood cells (Fig. 1 B). The weak expression of ICOSL transcripts in the CD3+ T cell fraction is consistent with a weak expression on a small number of T cells by flow cytometry (data not shown) and deserves further investigation. Thus, the lack of ICOSL staining on CD34brightCD33− and CD34brightCD33+cells suggested that hematopoietic progenitors do not express the ligand for ICOS and that its expression is acquired later during differentiation into myeloid committed CD34dull/−CD33bright cells. We reasoned that ICOSL is first acquired when hematopoietic cells differentiate into antigen presenting cells of myeloid (monocytes and DC) or lymphoid (B cells) origin. Because the phenotype of leukemia and lymphoma cells may correspond to frozen stages of lymphoid and myeloid differentiation, we examined leukemic cells for ICOSIg binding. None of seven cases of CD13+CD33+ AML nor any of six cases of B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia examined was bound by ICOSIg (Table I). These data suggest that the very early myeloid cells and B cell progenitor cells do not express ICOSL. Surprisingly, some of the leukemias stained positive for CD80 and/or CD86. Four of five cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, which is thought to represent a disease of immature, virgin B-lymphocytes, were ICOSL−, whereas two of four prolymphocytic leukemia and four of six hairy cell leukemia were ICOSL+. Because both prolymphocytic leukemia and hairy cell leukemia correspond to mature, almost preterminally differentiated B cells, the results suggest that ICOSL is expressed relatively late during B cell maturation. None of seven cases of follicular lymphoma (which correspond to germinal center B cells) reacted with our ICOSIg reagent.Table IICOSL versus CD80/CD86 expression on leukemias and lymphomasTumor typeMarkerCD801-aNumber of positive cases/cases tested.CD861-aNumber of positive cases/cases tested.ICOSL1-aNumber of positive cases/cases tested.

https://openalex.org/W2062789389,"The tumour suppressor p53 is a multifunctional protein important for the maintenance of genomic integrity. It is able to form molecular complexes with different DNA targets and also with cellular proteins involved in DNA transcription and DNA repair. In mammalian cells the biochemical processing of DNA occurs on a nuclear sub-structure termed the nuclear matrix. Previously Deppert and co-workers have identified p53 in association with the nuclear matrix in viral- and non-viral transformed cell lines. In the present study we demonstrate, for the first time, that p53 is bound to the nuclear matrix in primary cultures of normal mammalian cells and that this binding increases following DNA damage. Analysis of cell lines expressing structural mutants of p53 revealed that association with the nuclear matrix is independent of the tertiary and quaternary structure of p53. However, the proline-rich domain towards the N-terminus of p53 (residues 67 to 98) appeared important for binding to the nuclear matrix. This was demonstrated by TET-ON regulated expression of p53-derived constructs in p53−/− murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEF p53−/−). The proline-rich domain of p53 has potential for SH3 protein–protein interaction, and has a role in p53-mediated apoptosis and possibly base excision repair of DNA damage. We discuss our observations in relation to the ability of p53 to facilitate DNA repair and also review evidence indicating that matrix-bound p53 in SV40-transformed cells may facilitate the transforming potential of SV40 large T antigen."
https://openalex.org/W2052038365,"Many of the functions ascribed to p53 tumor suppressor protein are mediated through transcription regulation. We have shown that p53 represses hepatic-specific α-fetoprotein (AFP) gene expression by direct interaction with a composite HNF-3/p53 DNA binding element. Using solid-phase, chromatin-assembled AFP DNA templates and analysis of chromatin structure and transcription in vitro, we find that p53 binds DNA and alters chromatin structure at the AFP core promoter to regulate transcription. Chromatin assembled in the presence of hepatoma extracts is activated for AFP transcription with an open, accessible core promoter structure. Distal (−850) binding of p53 during chromatin assembly, but not post-assembly, reverses transcription activation concomitant with promoter inaccessibility to restriction enzyme digestion. Inhibition of histone deacetylase activity by trichostatin-A (TSA) addition, prior to and during chromatin assembly, activated chromatin transcription in parallel with increased core promoter accessibility. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses showed increased H3 and H4 acetylated histones at the core promoter in the presence of TSA, while histone acetylation remained unchanged at the site of distal p53 binding. Our data reveal that p53 targets chromatin structure alteration at the core promoter, independently of effects on histone acetylation, to establish repressed AFP gene expression.

We have established that p53 binds within the AFP1 distal developmental repressor region, displacing bound trans-activator HNF-3 (FoxA) protein, and contributes to post-natal, tissue-specific repression of AFP (6Lee K.C. Crowe A.J. Barton M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1279-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). AFP is normally expressed at high levels in the liver of the developing fetus and silenced after birth. Adult expression of AFP is monitored as a tumor marker: aberrant reactivation occurs in up to 85% of all hepatocellular carcinoma cases (reviewed in Ref. 10Tilghman S.M. Oxf. Surv. Eukaryotic Genes. 1985; 2: 160-206PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we find that p53 binds to DNA during chromatin structure organization as an obligate step in transcription repression. DNA binding of p53 mediates distal regulation of AFP transcription through alteration of chromatin structure at the core promoter. The ability of p53 to regulate nucleosome positioning at the core promoter is independent of histone modification. We show that histone hyperacetylation has direct consequences for core promoter chromatin accessibility and gene activation. These effects are overridden by addition of p53, which represses transcription by restricting chromatin accessibility even in the presence of hyperacetylated histone H3 and H4 N-terminal tails at the core promoter. AFP/lacZ contains 3.8-kilobbase pair upstream DNA including proximal and distal promoter and enhancer I, fused to the coding region of β-galactosidase (11Spear B.T. Longley T. Moulder S. Wang S.L.

DelA/lacZ is identical except that it contains a 10-base pair deletion in one p53 binding half-site between −850 and −840, as well as a 4-bp mutation in the other half-site. It was constructed by polymerase chain reaction mutation of the previously described AFP/mut5 template (6Lee K.C. Crowe A.J. Barton M.C. Mol. Cell.

Protein-DNA complexes were cross-linked by exposure to 1% formaldehyde (final concentration) for 10 min at room temperature, followed by 50 min on ice. These reactions were diluted 3-fold in Xenopus egg extract buffer (12Crowe A.J. Barton M.C. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1999; 17: 173-187Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and mixed gently. The supernatant was removed after magnetic concentration, and bead/DNA was resuspended in 1× SM2 buffer (500 mmsucrose, 80 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 3.5 mm ATP, 6 mm CaCl2) plus 1.5 units of micrococcal nuclease (MNase, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) (12Crowe A.J. Barton M.C. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1999; 17: 173-187Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). A 5-min incubation with MNase digested cross-linked chromatin into 200–500-nucleotide size fragments, as determined empirically by agarose gel electrophoresis and Southern blotting. After stopping digestions in 20 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA (final concentration), 9 volumes of ChIP dilution buffer (16.7 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.1, 167 mm NaCl, 1.1% Triton X-100, 0.01% SDS, 1.2 mm EDTA) were added to each sample. This diluted sample of chromatin/protein/DNA fragments was removed as a supernatant from the immobilized paramagnetic beads and divided among several reaction tubes for incubation with control and specific antibodies as described previously (18Kuo M.H. Allis C.D. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1999; 19: 425-433Crossref Scopus (488) Google Scholar). The presence of immunoprecipitated DNA sequences was determined by Southern blotting using a slot-blot manifold for binding DNA to GeneScreen Plus membrane (Beckman Chemical Co.). Hybridization with 32P-end-labeled, double-stranded oligomers encompassing AFP/lacZ sequences from +4 to +26 (promoter probe), from −860 to −830 (p53-binding site), and random-primed labeled full-length template was performed as described previously (17Crowe A.J. Sang L. Li K.K. Lee K.C. Spear B.T. Barton M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25113-25120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Results were quantified by ImageQuant analysis of scanned autoradiograms. Values are expressed as a ratio of bound to input, corrected by comparison to no antibody and full-length template controls. We employed in vitro chromatin assembly of solid-phase AFP DNA templates to reconstitute repression of AFP transcription through a distal p53-regulatory element. We showed previously that chromatin assembly by this method establishes physiologically spaced nucleosomes over the entire DNA template and renders in vitro transcription tissue-specific, in contrast to nucleosome-free DNA (12Crowe A.J. Barton M.C. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1999; 17: 173-187Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 17Crowe A.J. Sang L. Li K.K. Lee K.C. Spear B.T. Barton M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25113-25120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These templates were either transcribed for functional analysis or structurally analyzed for promoter accessibility or histone modification status (Fig. 1 A). Nucleosome assembly silences AFP transcription compared with unassembled DNA templates (Fig. 1 B, lane 1, compared with β-globin transcripts). Addition of HepG2 extract, prepared from cultured human hepatoma cells that express AFP, during chromatin assembly derepresses and/or activates AFP transcription an average of 5-fold (lane 2). Titration of increasing amounts of recombinant p53, in addition to HepG2 extract, during chromatin assembly represses AFP chromatin transcription up to 3-fold (lanes 6 and 7). However, p53 introduced after chromatin structure was established had no significant effect on transcription (p53post, average of 1.1-fold increase, lanes 3–5). We have utilized restriction enzyme accessibility to monitor changes in promoter chromatin structure induced by p53 DNA binding (Fig. 2). HincII restriction digestion at sites that flank the AFP promoter at −55 and +29, Fig. 2 A, correlates with a core promoter region relatively free of a bound nucleosome and open to transcription complex assembly (12Crowe A.J. Barton M.C. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1999; 17: 173-187Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar,17Crowe A.J. Sang L. Li K.K. Lee K.C. Spear B.T. Barton M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25113-25120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Structural analysis mirrored the functional effects of p53 addition both during and post-chromatin assembly (Fig. 2 B). Compared with chromatin assembly in buffer only, HepG2 extract established an open core promoter (lane 3 compared with lane 2). Addition of p53 protein during chromatin assembly revealed a dose-dependent chromatin closure (lanes 4–6, compared with lane 3). The core promoter chromatin structure remained relatively inert to p53 protein addition post-assembly (lanes 7 and 8). A quantitative average of these data and similar experiments are graphed in Fig. 2 C. Comparison of both transcription and chromatin structural consequences of p53 addition pre- and post-chromatin assembly support the view that p53 action is primarily at the level of chromatin structure organization rather than targeting modification of an established chromatin structure. The p53 DNA-binding site within the AFP upstream region (−860/−830, Fig. 3 A) fits the consensus binding sequence for a p53 tetramer at the 5′ half-site (PuPuPuCA/TA/TGPyPyPy (19El-Deiry W.S. Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar)). However, this p53 repressor element has a 3′ half-site following a 3-base pair nucleotide spacer that deviates from consensus (PyPyPyCTAGPuPyPu). The influence of DNA binding sequence on p53 conformation and function has been described previously (20Thornborrow E.C. Manfredi J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33747-33756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), but the specific way in which this response element dictates p53 regulation of AFP is not known. Deletion and mutation of the p53-binding site (DelA) abolishes both p53 and HNF-3 binding at this site (data not shown). Consistent with lack of p53 binding, repression of chromatin transcription (Fig. 3 B) and structure accessibility at the core promoter (Fig. 3 C) are lost. Nucleosome positioning, which restricts core promoter access to restriction enzymes and transcription preinitiation complexes, may be affected by histone N-terminal tail interactions with DNA. Chromatin composed of highly acetylated histones, in general, may be more dynamic and readily activated for transcription; whereas, the opposite may be true for underacetylated nucleosomes. Multiple transcription factors interact with protein complexes displaying intrinsic enzymatic activity, such as histone acetyl transferases (HAT’s) or histone deacetylases (HDAC’s), and target modification of chromatin by virtue of their DNA binding ability (recently reviewed in Refs. 21Mizzen C. Kuo M.H. Smith E. Brownell J. Zhou J. Ohba R. Wei Y. Monaco L. Sassone-Corsi P. Allis C.D. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 469-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 22Howe L.

Rev. 2000; 64: 435-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (1412) Google Scholar). Several studies have shown interactions between both HAT and HDAC complexes and p53, interactions that may promote histone modification, p53 modification, or p53 stabilization (24Murphy M. Ahn J.

Biol. 2001; 21: 3974-3985Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Our base-line study of histone modification at the core promoter and the p53-binding site at −850 revealed no significant variation in histone H3 acetylation between these regions, in the presence or absence of p53. Four separate ChIP experiments were performed and the percent of acetylated histone H3 present at these regions averaged: at the core promoter, 27.8% ± 9.3 (in the absence of p53) and 27.6% ± 9.2 (in the presence of p53); and at the p53-binding site, 35.1% ± 5.7 (−p53) and 32.2% ± 5.9 (+p53). Although there were no significant variances between histone modification states localized at the core promoter or p53-binding site, there were striking differences in acetylation states when the equilibrium between acetylases and deacetylases was shifted by addition of TSA to Xenopus egg extract in the absence of hepatoma proteins (Fig. 4). In response to increasing concentration of TSA, nucleosomes present at the core promoter region increased in both H3 and H4 acetylation 2–3-fold. However, in the local region of p53 binding, histone modification was maintained at a base-line level over the concentration range of TSA (Fig. 4 A). Somewhat surprisingly, the presence or absence of p53 protein made little difference to the state of histone modification at all levels of TSA. Thus, we find no evidence that p53 alone targets modification of histone tails at the p53-binding site or at the core promoter. The specific increases in histone H3 and H4 acetylation at the core promoter led directly to derepression of transcription in the absence of any exogenous activator proteins (Fig. 4 B). Functionally, the 2–3-fold changes in histone acetylation at the core promoter mediated a 2-fold increase in transcription of chromatin assembled in Xenopus egg extract treated with TSA (lanes 1–5). The increase in transcription was not dependent on the p53/HNF3-binding site, as similar transcription of the DelA AFP template in TSA-treated egg extract also showed transcription increase with increasing TSA (Fig. 4 C, lanes 2 and 3 compared with lane 1). Despite the presence of highly acetylated histones at the core promoter, p53 was able to repress transcription fully when added during chromatin assembly (Fig. 4 B, lane 7 compared with lanes 1 and 6). The ability to repress chromatin transcription was absolutely dependent on DNA binding of p53 as the DelA AFP template remained transcriptionally active in the presence of p53 (Fig. 4 C, lanes 4 and 5). Restriction accessibility analysis of core promoter chromatin (Fig. 4 D) showed a parallel increase of 2-fold in the presence of TSA (lane 3), and repression to base-line levels in the presence of added p53 (lanes 4 and 5), both in parallel with effects on transcription function (Fig. 4 B). The ability of p53 to modify nucleosome/DNA interactions at the core promoter, resulting in chromatin structure closure and repression of transcription, is not dependent on tissue-specific factors or targeted modification of histone acetylation and occurs even in the presence of highly acetylated nucleosomes. During hepatic development and post-natal silencing of AFP expression, specific changes in chromatin structure of the AFP gene occur, which likely play a role in regulation (31Chou J.Y. Wan Y.-J.Y. Oxf. Surv. Eukaryot. Genes. 1989; 6: 1-31PubMed Google Scholar, 32Godbout R. Tilghman S.M. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 949-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Our present study reveals that the functional outcome of p53 DNA binding within the AFP distal repressor region is dictated by chromatin structure organization. Chromatin structure can influence transcription regulation by obstructing transcription factor access to DNA or by facilitating interactions between distal regulatory factors and proximal promoter elements to repress or activate transcription (33Schild C. Claret F.-X. Wahli W. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 423-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 34Wallrath L.L. Lu Q. Granok H. Elgin S.C.R.

Our in vitro chromatin transcription system recapitulates distal regulation of AFP transcription by p53 bound to DNA 850 base pairs 5′ of the transcription start site within the AFP developmental repressor domain. As best studied in Drosphila, distal repressors, like distal enhancers, are essential in regulation of development and differentiation (39Gray S. Levine M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 358-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Proteins that interact with DNA regulatory elements dictate chromatin activation or repression, as well as the consequences of p53 regulation. AFP chromatin is derepressed or activated in the presence of hepatoma extract, but remains transcriptionally repressed when assembled in HeLa extract (17Crowe A.J. Sang L. Li K.K. Lee K.C. Spear B.T. Barton M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25113-25120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). As shown here, p53 mediates repression of hepatoma-activated chromatin, but in the presence of HeLa extract a low level of transcription activation is observed instead (40Ogden S.K. Lee K.C. Barton M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27806-27814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Thus, the interpretation of p53 protein interaction with DNA, whether activating or repressing chromatin structure, is influenced by multiple trans-acting factors. The timing of these interactions relative to chromatin assembly is important as well. We find that p53 lacks the ability to alter an established, activated chromatin structure. HNF-3 (FoxA) protein, present in the HepG2 extract, mediates core accessibility to HincII restriction enzyme and basal transcription factors in chromatin transcription (17Crowe A.J. Sang L. Li K.K. Lee K.C. Spear B.T. Barton M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25113-25120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Zaret and co-workers (41McPherson C.E. Eun-Yong S. Friedman D.S. Zaret K.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 387-398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 42Shim E.Y. Woodcock C. Zaret K.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 5-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) established that HNF-3 is an architectural transcription factor that can position nucleosomes along the albumin enhancer, rendering it competent for later trans-activator binding. Thus, HNF-3 acts as primary effector of chromatin modification and derepression, and this established chromatin structure cannot be altered by post-assembly addition of p53. Previous investigations revealed that p53 binding to DNA induces considerable bending and twisting at its binding site, and the inherent sequence-dependent form that DNA assumes greatly affects p53 DNA binding properties (43Nagaich A.K. Zhurkin V.B. Durell S.R. Jernigan R.L. Appella E. Harrington R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1875-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The manipulation of DNA and chromatin structure by proteins such as HNF-3 and/or p53 may establish a requisite order of transcription factor binding to induce specific chromatin-repressed or -activated forms. Studies of Swi5p-mediated recruitment of Swi/Snf and SAGA complexes at the yeast HOendonuclease gene promoter (44Cosma M.P. Tanaka T. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1999; 97: 299-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar), as well as temporal recruitment of chromatin remodeling and histone modifying complexes by nuclear receptors (45Dilworth F.J. Fromental-Ramain C. Yamamoto K. Chambon P. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1049-1058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), support the idea that only specific transcription factors can interact with chromatin to initiate a series of regulatory steps. This temporal order is likely influenced by flanking DNA sequence, the complexity of the regulatory element(s), and interacting proteins. Our results showing that p53 cannot bind and repress a previously activated chromatin template are in contrast to p53 action at a chromatin-repressed (assembled in buffer) p21 gene template (46Espinosa J.M. Emerson B.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 57-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). In this case, p53 can bind to chromatin and target p300 to acetylate histone tails at a p53-binding site, which then spreads distally to the core promoter. Together, p53 and p300 activate transcription of chromatin-repressed p21 gene templates. The ability of p53 protein to target histone modification was also suggested by previous studies. Transcription repression of the MAP4 gene is correlated with p53-mediated histone deacetylation and promoter-localized histone modification in cultured cells (24Murphy M. Ahn J. Walker K.K. Hoffman W.H. Evans R.M. Levine A.J. George D.L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2490-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Our studies of histone modification revealed little change in histone acetylation mediated by p53 addition during chromatin assembly in untreated Xenopus egg extract. When the equilibrium between histone acetylase and deacetylase activities was shifted toward acetylation by TSA addition, the p53-binding site region was maintained in a state of reduced acetylation, even in the absence of exogenous p53, compared with the core promoter. We propose that local histone modification at the AFP repressive p53-binding site is maintained by multiple protein complexes. 2S. Ogden and M. Barton, unpublished results. Regional, regulated shifts in acetylation/deacetylation equilibria may be revealed by disruption of histone acetylase or deacetylase activities (47Vogelauer M. Wu J. Suka N. Grunstein M. Nature. 2000; 408: 495-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar), which exist endogenously in Xenopus egg extract. Despite increased histone acetylation, p53 regulates chromatin structure alteration that creates inaccessibility at the AFP core promoter. The ability of p53 to modify chromatin structure at the core promoter is not dependent on the presence of hepatoma-specific factors and is inhibited when tissue-specific factors have previously established active chromatin. Our studies reveal a hierarchy of transcription regulation by p53 in which distal alterations in chromatin structure rather than local modification of histone tails play a key role in repressing AFP gene expression. It will be of great interest to compare other p53-repressed and -activated genes and establish whether the interpretation of p53 induction as a transcription activation or repression signal is dictated by DNA regulatory site complexity, interacting proteins, and consequent chromatin structure alteration.

These biologic actions are mediated by the HGF/SF receptor c-Met, a transmembrane tyrosine kinase (7Bottaro D.P. Rubin J.S. Faletto D.L. Chan A.M.-L. Kmiecik T.E. Vande Woude G.F. Aaronson S.A.

We found that, in addition to stimulating cell invasion and angiogenesis, HGF/SF protects various epithelial and carcinoma cell types against apoptosis and cytotoxicity induced by DNA-damaging agents (13Fan S. Wang J.-A. Yuan R.-Q. Rockwell S. Andres J. Zlatapolskiy A. Goldberg I.D. Rosen E.M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Preincubation with HGF/SF (50–100 ng/ml) strongly protected Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells and breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-453 and EMT6) against toxicity and apoptosis caused by adriamycin (ADR, a DNA topoisomerase IIα inhibitor), x-rays, and UV light. Cell protection was demonstrated in multiple assay systems reflecting different end points, specifically MTT dye conversion (mitochondrial integrity), trypan blue dye exclusion (membrane integrity), colony formation (reproductive viability), and DNA ladder formation (apoptosis).Maximal protection of MDA-MB-453 human breast cancer cells against ADR required preincubation with HGF/SF for ≥48 h (13Fan S. Wang J.-A. Yuan R.-Q. Rockwell S. Andres J. Zlatapolskiy A. Goldberg I.D. Rosen E.M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). When HGF/SF was added during exposure to ADR and thereafter, there was no cell protection. A clue to HGF/SF-mediated protection was the finding that ADR caused the disappearance of the survival-promoting protein Bcl-XL, whereas preincubation with SF blocked the ADR-induced loss of Bcl-XL. Interestingly, the alterations of Bcl-XL occurred at the protein level because subsequent studies revealed that neither ADR nor HGF/SF caused any changes in Bcl-XL mRNA expression. But like HGF/SF cell protection, the ability of HGF/SF to prevent the ADR-induced loss of the Bcl-XL protein required a prolonged preincubation with HGF/SF. Thus, HGF/SF-induced transcriptional alterations during the 48-h preincubation may contribute to stabilization of the Bcl-XL protein and cell protection.Similar to epithelial and carcinoma cells, HGF/SF protected glioma cell lines against apoptosis induced by ionizing radiation, cis-platinum (a DNA cross-linking agent), camptothecin (a topoisomerase I inhibitor), and etoposide (a topoisomerase IIα inhibitor) (14Bowers D.C.

The protection of epithelial, breast cancer, prostate cancer, and glioma cell lines against DNA damage-induced apoptosis was due, at least in part, to activation of a cell survival pathway involving phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), c-Akt (protein kinase B), and signaling downstream of c-Akt (14Bowers D.C.

This HGF/SF-induced c-Met → PI3K → c-Akt pathway also resulted in an increased rate of DNA repair (i.e. strand break rejoining), and both the HGF/SF-mediated cell protection and the HGF/SF enhancement of DNA repair were abrogated or significantly attenuated by the expression of a dominant-negative (kinase inactive) c-Akt expression vector (15Fan S.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2212-2223Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar).These studies have not directly addressed the mechanism(s) of HGF/SF-mediated cell protection at the level of the specific component(s) of the apoptotic cascade that is activated by DNA-damaging agents like ADR, nor have they identified the apoptosis-signaling pathways that are blocked by HGF/SF. The goal of the present study was to identify the specific pathway(s) of ADR-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis in a human breast cancer cell line that is protected by HGF/SF (MDA-MB-453) and to determine which component(s) of the apoptosis pathway are blocked by HGF/SF.DISCUSSIONThese findings suggest that HGF/SF inhibits ADR-induced mitochondrial apoptosis signaling at the level of or upstream of the mitochondria by blocking the release of apoptosis-promoting mitochondrial factors, including cytochrome c and AIF. However, our findings do not rule out the possibility that ADR also inhibits postmitochondrial apoptosis signaling, because the latter events would not be detectable if the mitochondria were prevented by HGF/SF from releasing their cytochrome c. In our experimental assay system, the earliest detectable ADR-induced release of cytochrome c occurred at t = 16 h after a 2-h exposure to ADR.The skeletal events involved in the mitochondrial apoptosis pathways in mammalian cells are well established. These events include release of cytochrome c from the intermitochondrial membrane space to the cytosol, the formation of the aposome (a high molecular weight complex of cytochrome c-Apaf-1-procaspase-9), caspase-9 activation, caspase-3 activation, and cleavage of key cellular proteins (e.g. PARP, lamins, etc.) (22Zou H.

Biol. 1999; 15: 269-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (2249) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that following an apoptogenic stimulus, individual cells release all of their mitochondrial cytochrome c content very rapidly over a 5–10-min interval. However, different cells within the same cell population initiate cytochrome c release at different times (31Goldstein J.C. Waterhous N.J. Juin P. Evan G.I. Green D.R. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). Although the latent period before cytochromec release varies from cell to cell, there is a minimal time interval before which no cells release cytochrome c.Our time course studies suggest a latent period of about t =16 h before ADR-induced cytochrome c release. Of course, this time interval could vary according to the cell type, ADR dose, and other factors. However, our findings do suggest that as yet unidentified premitochondrial molecular events must be completed before any cytochrome c release can be initiated. Our findings further indicate that the amount of cytochrome c released into the cytosol increases progressively between 24 and 72 h. If it is true that once cytochrome c release is initiated a cell releases its entire cytochrome c content, then the findings suggest that between 24 and 72 h an increasing proportion of cells undergo cytochrome c release.Recent studies also suggest that mitochondrial depolarization (i.e. loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, Δψ) is not the cause of cytochrome c release but is a reflection of cytochrome c release or a temporally independent event (32Bossy-Wetzel E. Newmeyer D.D. Green D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). Studies utilizing the DePsipher dye suggest that ADR-induced mitochondrial membrane depolarization follows a time course similar to that for the release of cytochrome c and AIF. Thus, no loss of Δψ was observed at t = 8 h post-ADR exposure, while the proportion of depolarized cells increased progressively fromt = 24 h to 72 h. Again, pretreatment with HGF/SF completely blocked the ADR-induced depolarization, suggesting that HGF/SF may inhibit a common upstream event leading to both cytochrome release and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. The early premitochondrial signaling events that lead to mitochondrial dysfunction have not been identified. However, in some contexts these events may include proapoptotic sphingolipid signaling (i.e.ceramide production) (33Senchenkov A Litvak D.A. Cabot M.C. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2001; 93: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), the translocation of proapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins (e.g. Bax, Bim, tBid) to the mitochondrial membrane, and the accumulation of other, partially characterized, apoptogenic factors within the cytoplasm (25Gross A.

Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5542-5548PubMed Google Scholar).ADR induced the activation of various caspases, including caspase-9, -3, -7, -8, and -2. The earliest caspase activation (caspase-9 and -7), along with evidence of PARP cleavage, occurred at 24 h after exposure to ADR, suggesting that caspase activation occurs simultaneously with or later than cytochrome c release. Caspase-8 activation and up-regulation of Fas ligand were observed att = 48 to 72 h, suggesting that death receptor signaling induced by ADR is a relatively late event. However, these studies must be interpreted with the caution that the sensitivity of detection of the cleaved protein fragments may vary depending upon the antibody used and other factors. In any event, all detectable ADR-induced events, including the activation of multiple caspases (caspase-9, -7, -3, -8, and -2) and the up-regulation of Fas ligand, were blocked by preincubation with HGF/SF.This finding is consistent with a scheme in which a caspase cascade triggered by the release of cytochrome c is blocked by HGF/SF at a premitochondrial and/or mitochondrial level. Again, we cannot rule out the possibility that HGF/SF independently inhibits apoptosis signaling downstream of the mitochondria. Thus, a recent study suggests that c-Akt, which we previously showed to be activated by HGF/SF in various cell types (14Bowers D.C. Fan S. Walter K. Abounder R. Williams J.A. Rosen E.M. Laterra J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4277-4283PubMed Google Scholar, 15Fan S. Ma Y.X. Wang J.-A. Yuan R.-Q. Meng Q. Laterra J.J. Goldberg I.D. Rosen E.M.

Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 483-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Studies utilizing the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk yielded interesting findings. Based on the MTT assay, z-VAD-fmk partially protected the cells against ADR, giving about two-thirds of the protection afforded by HGF/SF. Also, z-VAD-fmk blocked some apoptosis signaling events (e.g.caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage). However, z-VAD-fmk failed to inhibit the release of cytochrome c or AIF, nor did it block mitochondrial membrane depolarization. Thus, z-VAD-fmk appears to inhibit postmitochondrial events in our experimental system.Although the MTT assays revealed a viability level of at least 65% in cells treated with [z-VAD-fmk+ADR], the DePsipher staining showed that about 80% of the cells treated with [z-VAD-fmk+ADR] exhibited mitochondrial depolarization at t = 72 h after exposure to ADR. The finding that z-VAD-fmk protects MDA-MB-453 cells against ADR (based on MTT assays) but does not block mitochondrial dysfunction suggests the existence of a caspase-dependent cell death checkpoint downstream of the mitochondria. However, MTT assays do not measure cell survival per se but assess mitochondrial function (i.e. the ability to reduce a tetrazolium dye). Thus, increased MTT dye conversion in [z-VAD-fmk+ADR]-treated cells could represent more surviving cells or the same number of surviving cells with more active mitochondria per cell.We previously established the role of a PI3K → c-Akt signaling pathway and signaling downstream of c-Akt in HGF/SF-mediated cell protection in several different cell types, including MDA-MB-453 cells, Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells, and human glioma cell lines (14Bowers D.C. Fan S. Walter K. Abounder R. Williams J.A. Rosen E.M. Laterra J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4277-4283PubMed Google Scholar, 15Fan S. Ma Y.X. Wang J.-A. Yuan R.-Q. Meng Q. Laterra J.J. Goldberg I.D.

Biol. 2001; 21: 4968-4984Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In these studies, HGF/SF induced the phosphorylation and activation of c-Akt, and selective pharmacologic inhibitors of PI3K enzymatic activity significantly inhibited the HGF/SF-mediated cell protection. Furthermore, expression vectors encoding dominant-negative inhibitory forms of p85 (the regulatory subunit of PI3K) and c-Akt blocked or substantially attenuated the HGF/SF-mediated cell protection, whereas wild-type and constitutively active forms of c-Akt afforded some cellular protection in the absence of HGF/SF. Although the molecular pathways through which c-Akt mediates the protection by HGF/SF are unclear at this time, we did show that in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, HGF/SF causes the phosphorylation of a forkhead family transcription factor (FKHR). FKHR is a proapoptotic transcription factor for which phosphorylation by c-Akt within the forkhead domain causes nuclear exclusion and, therefore, inactivation (38Tang E.D. Nunez G. Barr F.G.

Because we were unable to detect Bad protein in MDA-MB-453 or Madin-Darby canine kidney cells using several different antibodies, it is unlikely that the inactivation of Bad is required for HGF/SF-mediated cell protection. c-Akt has other phosphorylation targets that may participate in cell signaling related to apoptosis/survival, such as the apoptosis-signaling kinase ASK-1 and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) (42Kim A.H.

Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4324) Google Scholar). The role of these substrates, if any, in HGF/SF-mediated cell protection remains to be determined.Finally, recent studies have established an additional level of regulation of apoptosis signaling through members of the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) family of proteins (44Yang Y.L. Li X.M. Cell Res. 2000; 10: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 45Chai J. Shiozaki E. Srinivasula S.M. Wu Q. Dataa P. Alnemri E.S. Shi Y.

These are endogenous cellular proteins that bind to various caspases and either prevent their activation or inhibit their enzymatic activity. In addition, the mitochondrial protein SMAC (also known as DIABLO) is released into the cytosol in the setting of apoptosis and disrupts the IAP-mediated inhibition of caspases, thereby promoting apoptosis (48Du C.

The roles of the IAPs and SMAC in DNA damage-induced apoptosis and in HGF/SF-mediated cell protection are unclear at present. However, it is interesting that overexpression of XIAP protected ovarian epithelial cancer cells against cis-platinum-induced apoptosis, in part, by enhancing c-Akt activity and inhibiting caspase-3 activity (51Asselin E. Mills G.B. Tsang B.K. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1862-1868PubMed Google Scholar). Further study is required to determine whether HGF/SF either blocks the expression or release of SMAC or enhances the function of IAP proteins as a means of cell protection. The cytokine hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF)1 stimulates cell motility, invasion, and proliferation and induces epithelial morphogenesis and angiogenesis in different cellular contexts (1Stoker M.

These biologic actions are mediated by the HGF/SF receptor c-Met, a transmembrane tyrosine kinase (7Bottaro D.P. Rubin J.S. Faletto D.L. Chan A.M.-L. Kmiecik T.E. Vande Woude G.F. Aaronson S.A.

Previous studies indicate that the expression of HGF/SF and its receptor (c-Met) increases significantly during the progression of breast cancer, gliomas, and other tumor types and that high levels of HGF/SF are associated with invasion, angiogenesis, and poor prognosis (8Yao Y.

We found that, in addition to stimulating cell invasion and angiogenesis, HGF/SF protects various epithelial and carcinoma cell types against apoptosis and cytotoxicity induced by DNA-damaging agents (13Fan S. Wang J.-A. Yuan R.-Q. Rockwell S. Andres J. Zlatapolskiy A. Goldberg I.D. Rosen E.M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Preincubation with HGF/SF (50–100 ng/ml) strongly protected Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells and breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-453 and EMT6) against toxicity and apoptosis caused by adriamycin (ADR, a DNA topoisomerase IIα inhibitor), x-rays, and UV light. Cell protection was demonstrated in multiple assay systems reflecting different end points, specifically MTT dye conversion (mitochondrial integrity), trypan blue dye exclusion (membrane integrity), colony formation (reproductive viability), and DNA ladder formation (apoptosis). Maximal protection of MDA-MB-453 human breast cancer cells against ADR required preincubation with HGF/SF for ≥48 h (13Fan S. Wang J.-A. Yuan R.-Q. Rockwell S. Andres J. Zlatapolskiy A. Goldberg I.D. Rosen E.M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). When HGF/SF was added during exposure to ADR and thereafter, there was no cell protection. A clue to HGF/SF-mediated protection was the finding that ADR caused the disappearance of the survival-promoting protein Bcl-XL, whereas preincubation with SF blocked the ADR-induced loss of Bcl-XL. Interestingly, the alterations of Bcl-XL occurred at the protein level because subsequent studies revealed that neither ADR nor HGF/SF caused any changes in Bcl-XL mRNA expression. But like HGF/SF cell protection, the ability of HGF/SF to prevent the ADR-induced loss of the Bcl-XL protein required a prolonged preincubation with HGF/SF. Thus, HGF/SF-induced transcriptional alterations during the 48-h preincubation may contribute to stabilization of the Bcl-XL protein and cell protection. Similar to epithelial and carcinoma cells, HGF/SF protected glioma cell lines against apoptosis induced by ionizing radiation, cis-platinum (a DNA cross-linking agent), camptothecin (a topoisomerase I inhibitor), and etoposide (a topoisomerase IIα inhibitor) (14Bowers D.C. Fan S. Walter K. Abounder R. Williams J.A. Rosen E.M. Laterra J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4277-4283PubMed Google Scholar). The protection of epithelial, breast cancer, prostate cancer, and glioma cell lines against DNA damage-induced apoptosis was due, at least in part, to activation of a cell survival pathway involving phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), c-Akt (protein kinase B), and signaling downstream of c-Akt (14Bowers D.C.

The G2 checkpoint operates through a different mechanism, and the details of this pathway are beginning to emerge (7O'Connell M. Walworth N. Carr A. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 296-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). In the current model, regulation is exerted through a phosphorylation cascade and by control of the subcellular localization of enzymes and their substrates. ATM1 and ATR kinases play a role in the early signaling of DNA damage and cause phosphorylation of Chk1 and Chk2 kinases (8Durocher D. Jackson S.P. Curr. Opin.

Phosphorylation of the phosphatase Cdc25C by Chk1 and Chk2 creates a 14–3-3 binding site and inhibits its phosphatase activity in vitro, preventing its activation of Cdc2 kinase, the master regulator of mitosis (13Sanchez Y.

Cdc2 activity is also regulated by inhibitory phosphorylation by Wee1 and Myt1 kinases (16Mueller P.R. Coleman T.R. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G.

Inhibitors of the G2 checkpoint, such as caffeine, 2-aminopurine, pentoxifylline, staurosporine, and UCN-01, have been studied extensively in tissue culture model systems (18Russell K.J. Wiens L.W.

More recently, we have identified isogranulatimide (IGR) and debromohymenialdisine (DBH) as checkpoint inhibitors from marine invertebrate extracts (23Roberge M. Berlinck R.G.S. Xu L. Anderson H.J. Lim L.Y. Curman D. Stringer C.M. Friend S.H. Davies P. Haggarty S.J. Kelly M.T. Britton R. Piers E. Andersen R.J. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5701-5706PubMed Google Scholar, 24Curman D. Cinel B.

In vitro, most G2 checkpoint inhibitors can sensitize cancer cells that lack p53 function (and thus have a defective G1 checkpoint) to the effects of DNA-damaging cancer chemotherapeutic agents and ionizing radiation (22Wang Q.

This suggests that these inhibitors are of potential benefit in the treatment of cancer, and clinical trials of UCN-01 are underway (29Sausville E.A. Arbuck S.G. Messmann R. Headlee D. Bauer K.S.

To find new inhibitors of the G2 checkpoint, we have screened plant extracts from the NCI National Institutes of Health Natural Products Repository. From this screening, we have identified 13-hydroxy-15-oxozoapatlin (OZ) and describe its activity as a checkpoint inhibitor and as an antimitotic agent. A methanol extract of Parinari curatellifolia bark was initially fractionated by a modified Kupchan partitioning scheme (30Kupchan S. Britton R. Laccadie J. Ziegler M. Sigel C. J. Org. Chem. 1975; 40: 648-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The extract was dissolved in 500 ml of MeOH/H20 (1:4) and sequentially extracted with hexane (3 × 200 ml), chloroform (3 × 200 ml), and ethyl acetate (3 × 200 ml). G2 checkpoint inhibition assays revealed activity in the hexane- and chloroform-soluble fractions (23Roberge M. Berlinck R.G.S. Xu L. Anderson H.J. Lim L.Y. Curman D. Stringer C.M. Friend S.H. Davies P. Haggarty S.J. Kelly M.T. Britton R. Piers E. Andersen R.J. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5701-5706PubMed Google Scholar). The chloroform fraction was subjected to silica gel flash chromatography (eluent, ethyl acetate: hexane, 20:80) to yield two compounds. Their structures were determined by 1H and13C NMR and mass spectrometry and found to be identical with published values for 13-hydroxy-15-oxozoapatlin and an analogue that differs by the addition of two hydrogen atoms (31Lee I.-K. Shamon L.A. Chai B.H. Chagwedera T.E. Besterman J.M. Farnsworth N.R. Cordell G.A. Pezzuto J.M. Kinghorn A.D. Chem. Biol.

The first compound demonstrated higher activity and was chosen for further study. DNA and mitotic epitopes were labeled by modification of the Braylan procedure for dual labeling of DNA and cell surface markers (33Braylan R. Cytometry. 1982; 2: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 34Robinson J. Robinson J.P. Darzynkiewicz Handbook of Flow Cytometry Methods. John Wiley & Sons, New York1993: 98Google Scholar). Cells were collected by trypsinization, washed in standard azide buffer (SAB; phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% fetal calf serum, and 0.1% sodium azide), fixed in 70% ethanol, and stored at 4 °C overnight. Cells were then washed twice in Tw-SAB (SAB containing 0.5% Tween 20), incubated in the same buffer for 30 min on ice to block nonspecific binding sites, and then suspended at a concentration of 10 × 106/ml in Tw-SAB containing 5% additional fetal calf serum. Mitotic epitopes were labeled by incubation with GF-7 or TG-3 antibodies (1:100 dilution in Tw-SAB; generously provided by Dr. P. Davies, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY) on ice for 30–90 min. After washing twice in Tw-SAB, cells were suspended as for primary antibody labeling and incubated with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse (IgG + IgM, H+L) secondary antibody (Pierce, diluted 1:150 in Tw-SAB) for 30 min on ice in darkness. Cells were then washed twice in Tw-SAB and treated with RNase A (Roche Diagnostics, 500 units/ml in 4 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 8.4) for 30 min at 37 °C. To label DNA, an equal volume of 50 μg/ml propidium iodide (PI) in sodium citrate buffer was added, and the incubation was continued for 20 min. Cells were finally suspended at a concentration of 1 × 106/ml in dilute PI solution (25 μg/ml in sodium citrate buffer) and stored in darkness at 4 °C overnight. Cells fixed and labeled as described above were analyzed in a Becton-Dickinson FACScan with standard laser and filter configurations. Data were collected for a minimum of 20,000 PI-triggered events on the low flow rate setting (∼100 events/s). The parameters measured were: forward and side scatters, FITC intensity, PI intensity, and PI pulse area and width. The FITC signal was compensated for PI emission overlap and recorded in 4-decade logarithmic mode. All other parameters were measured in linear mode. The data were saved in listmode format and analyzed in WinMDI freeware. Clumps and debris were categorized on the basis of DNA pulse width and scatter measurements, respectively, and excluded from the data analysis. MCF-7 cells expressing a dominant negative mutant p53 (mp53) or HCT116 cells in which the p53 gene was removed by targeted deletion (HCT116p53 −/−) were seeded into 10-cm2 dishes (2.2 × 106cells/dish). MCF-7 mp53 or HCT116p53 −/−cells were irradiated the next day with 10 or 12 grays, respectively, from a 60Co source (Gammacell 200, Atomic Energy Commission of Canada). Cells were subsequently cultured for 16 h to allow the population to fully arrest in G2 (23Roberge M. Berlinck R.G.S. Xu L. Anderson H.J. Lim L.Y. Curman D. Stringer C.M. Friend S.H. Davies P. Haggarty S.J. Kelly M.T. Britton R. Piers E. Andersen R.J. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5701-5706PubMed Google Scholar). They were then exposed for 8 h to checkpoint inhibitors and/or nocodazole at 100 or 300 ng/ml, respectively, to block cells in mitosis. To assess the degree of G2 checkpoint inhibition, mitotic cells were then detected by flow cytometry using the mitosis-specific antibody GF-7. Cells were seeded onto poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips (150,000 cells/1.5 ml) in 6-well tissue culture plates. On the following day, cells were treated with Me2SO or OZ (10 μm, 8 h). After fixation in formaldehyde (3.7% in TBS, 30 min), the coverslips were washed twice in TBS. Cells were permeabilized in blocking solution (1% bovine serum albumin in TBS) containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and then incubated for 1 h with E7 β-tubulin monoclonal antibody (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa) diluted 1:20 in blocking solution. After washing twice in TBS, cells were incubated with Alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular Probes; diluted 1:500 in blocking solution) for 50 min. Coverslips were washed twice in sodium citrate buffer (40 mm, pH 8.4) and incubated with RNase A (Roche Diagnostics, 500 units/ml) in citrate buffer for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing twice in TBS, DNA was stained by incubation with TOTO-3 (Molecular Probes; 2 μm) for 20 min in darkness. After washing twice in TBS, the coverslips were mounted in 90% glycerol in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2m N-propyl gallate. Cells were visualized with a Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 confocal on a Zeiss Axiovert S100TV microscope with a ×63 oil immersion objective lens (N. A. 1.4). Samples were excited with 488- and 638-nm light from argon and red diode lasers. The emission filters were HQ515/30 and HQ660L, respectively. Red and green signals were collected sequentially to avoid bleed through, in sections spaced 0.15 μm apart. Images were projected using NIH Image and Adobe Photoshop software. A cell-based assay for G2 checkpoint inhibitors was used to screen extracts from the NCI National Institutes of Health Natural Products Repository (23Roberge M. Berlinck R.G.S. Xu L. Anderson H.J. Lim L.Y. Curman D. Stringer C.M. Friend S.H. Davies P. Haggarty S.J. Kelly M.T. Britton R. Piers E. Andersen R.J. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5701-5706PubMed Google Scholar). Bark extract from the South African tree P. curatellifolia contained a checkpoint-inhibiting activity that was purified by chromatographic techniques (see “Experimental Procedures”). By analysis of its mass spectrometry and NMR data, the active compound was identified as the previously described ent-kaurene diterpenoid 13-hydroxy-15-oxozoapatlin (31Lee I.-K. Shamon L.A. Chai B.H. Chagwedera T.E. Besterman J.M. Farnsworth N.R. Cordell G.A. Pezzuto J.M. Kinghorn A.D. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1996; 99: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) (Fig.1, OZ). OZ was originally identified as a compound with broad spectrum cytotoxic activity toward human cancer cell lines and causing cell cycle arrest in G2/M (31Lee I.-K. Shamon L.A. Chai B.H. Chagwedera T.E. Besterman J.M. Farnsworth N.R. Cordell G.A. Pezzuto J.M. Kinghorn A.D. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1996; 99: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). For this reason, we first examined the effects of OZ on the cell cycle using flow cytometry. Treatment of exponentially growing MCF-7 mp53 cells with 10 μm OZ for 8 h decreased the proportion of G1 phase cells from 33% to 19 ± 2% (mean ± S.D., n = 2), caused little or no change in the number of S phase cells, and increased the proportion of G2/M cells from 35 ± 4% to 52 ± 1% (Fig.2 A). To determine whether the increase occurred in G2 or M phase, cells were also labeled with the mitosis-specific monoclonal antibody GF-7 (Fig.2 B). This revealed that the main effect of the compound was an increase in the number of mitotic cells from 3% to 14 ± 4%. This effect became more pronounced after longer incubation times. Similar results were observed in HCT116p53 −/−cells (not shown). We next studied the effects of the compound on cells arrested at the G2 checkpoint by ionizing radiation (Fig. 2, C and D). Consistent with earlier work (23Roberge M. Berlinck R.G.S. Xu L. Anderson H.J. Lim L.Y. Curman D. Stringer C.M. Friend S.H. Davies P. Haggarty S.J. Kelly M.T. Britton R. Piers E. Andersen R.J. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5701-5706PubMed Google Scholar), treatment with 10 grays caused about 90% of the cells to arrest in G2 phase by 16 h after irradiation (88 ± 2%, n = 5). Cells that did not receive further treatment remained arrested in G2 during the next 8 h. Treatment with 10 μm OZ at 16 h after irradiation caused 21% of the cells to escape G2. The cells released from G2arrest did not progress into G1 but became blocked in mitosis. That the cells were indeed in mitosis was confirmed by using an enzyme-linked immunocytochemical assay with a different mitosis-specific monoclonal antibody, TG-3 (23Roberge M. Berlinck R.G.S. Xu L. Anderson H.J. Lim L.Y. Curman D. Stringer C.M. Friend S.H. Davies P. Haggarty S.J. Kelly M.T. Britton R. Piers E. Andersen R.J. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5701-5706PubMed Google Scholar), and by counting mitotic figures under the microscope (data not shown). Taken together, these results show that OZ inhibits the G2 checkpoint and also arrests cells in mitosis. Irradiated MCF-7 mp53 or HCT116p53 −/− cells were treated with a range of OZ concentrations and analyzed by flow cytometry as described above. At 10 μm, the compound inhibited G2 arrest after irradiation in ∼20% of MCF-7 mp53 and 30% of HCT116p53 −/− cells (17 ± 1%, n = 3 and 32 ± 4%, n = 2, respectively) (Fig. 3). Entry into mitosis was strongly reduced at higher concentrations of OZ. We next investigated the mitotic arrest caused by OZ by examining its effects on chromosome condensation and mitotic spindle formation, two morphological hallmarks of mitosis. Cycling MCF-7 cells expressing wild-type p53 were treated with 10 μm OZ for 8 h and then immunostained with a β-tubulin monoclonal antibody to examine the mitotic spindle and counterstained with the DNA dye TOTO-3 to examine the chromosomes (Fig.4). The nuclei and microtubules of interphase OZ-treated cells were indistinguishable from the no-drug controls. However, after OZ treatment, no prophase, anaphase, or telophase cells were observed. All mitotic cells had a similar and atypical appearance in which the spindle poles were separated but the overall appearance of the spindles was disorganized in comparison with controls. At much higher concentrations of OZ, the disordered appearance of the microtubules was more pronounced. However, OZ did not affect microtubule polymerization or depolymerization in vitro (not shown), unlike other agents that block cells in mitosis. The chromosomes resembled those in normal metaphase except that they failed to align at the spindle equator. Because dual-labeling images showed that the chromosomes co-localized with the spindles, we infer that the chromosomes were in contact with the spindle apparatus. The overall appearance of the OZ-treated mitotic cells suggests that they were arrested in a stage resembling prometaphase. Similar effects were observed in MCF-7 mp53, HCT116p53 +/+ and HCT116p53 −/− cells (not shown). Flow cytometry had shown that OZ inhibited the G2 checkpoint in only 15–20% of G2-arrested MCF-7 mp53 cells. We next asked whether the extent of checkpoint inhibition could be increased by combining OZ with other checkpoint inhibitors. G2-arrested MCF-7 mp53 cells were treated for 8 h with 10 μm OZ and/or optimal checkpoint-inhibiting concentrations of caffeine (2 mm), UCN-01 (100 nm), DBH (40 μm), or IGR (20 μm) in the presence of nocodazole to arrest cells in mitosis. Cells were labeled with GF-7-FITC and PI, and mitotic cells were counted by flow cytometry (Fig. 5). UCN-01 and caffeine alone released 59 ± 8% and 65 ± 13% (means ± S.D.,n = 2) of cells, respectively, from G2arrest. The effects of caffeine and UCN-01 were not increased by co-incubation with OZ. IGR and DBH alone induced a more moderate response, releasing 23 ± 3% and 30 ± 1% of cells, respectively. However, this response was increased to 43 ± 3% and 52 ± 4%, respectively, when OZ was added, almost reaching the levels attained by caffeine or UCN-01. Therefore, the effects of OZ were additive with those of IGR or DBH. One measure of the therapeutic potential of checkpoint inhibitors is their ability to increase cell death after irradiation. To test whether OZ has this property, we first examined its effects on the proliferation of non-irradiated cells. MCF-7 mp53 cells were incubated with different concentrations of OZ for 24 h, the compound was washed away, and cell proliferation was measured 2 days later using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay (24Curman D. Cinel B. Williams D. Rundle N. Block W. Goodarzi A. Hutchins J. Clarke P. Zhou B.-B. Lees-Miller S. Andersen R. Roberge M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17914-17919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). OZ was a potent inhibitor of cell proliferation with an IC50 of 0.8 μm and IC90 of 2 μm (data not shown). We next treated cells with ionizing radiation followed immediately by a range of OZ concentrations for 24 h, and cell proliferation was assessed as above. OZ did not kill irradiated cells more potently than non-irradiated cells (data not shown). Considering that a combination of OZ with DBH showed enhanced G2 checkpoint-inhibiting activity, we next asked whether this combination would also enhance inhibition of cell proliferation (Fig. 6). In non-irradiated cells, 30 μm DBH inhibited proliferation to 58 ± 12% of no-drug controls, consistent with published values (24Curman D. Cinel B. Williams D. Rundle N. Block W. Goodarzi A. Hutchins J. Clarke P. Zhou B.-B. Lees-Miller S. Andersen R. Roberge M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17914-17919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). OZ (0.6 μm) inhibited cell proliferation to 81 ± 11%, and this was reduced in the presence of 30 μm DBH to 24 ± 15%. Similarly, in irradiated cells, treatment with DBH and OZ strongly inhibited proliferation in an additive manner. However, this combination of treatments did not lower the survival of irradiated cells significantly more than that of non-irradiated cells. This compound is unusual among checkpoint inhibitors because it has an α, β-unsaturated carbonyl group that makes it reactive to nucleophiles. As a result, OZ has the potential to covalently link to cysteine residues in proteins through Michael-type addition. To test whether this reaction is required for G2 checkpoint inhibition by OZ, the unsaturated group was modified by reaction with β-mercaptoethanol (Fig.7 A) and tested in the G2 checkpoint inhibition assay. The reaction product did not retain any G2 checkpoint inhibitory activity (Fig.7 B). We next investigated whether this compound is an inhibitor of known checkpoint proteins. In vitro, OZ did not inhibit the checkpoint kinases Chk1, Chk2, Plk1, ATM, and ATR. 2S. Lees-Miller, T. Holström, P. R. Clarke, and E. Nigg, personal communications. Furthermore, it did not inhibit the activities of purified PP1 and PP2A or the activity of protein Ser/Thr phosphatases present in MCF-7 cell extracts (data not shown), suggesting that OZ inhibits the G2 checkpoint by a mechanism distinct from that of other checkpoint inhibitors. 13-Hydroxy-15-oxozoapatlin was first described in 1996 (31Lee I.-K. Shamon L.A. Chai B.H. Chagwedera T.E. Besterman J.M. Farnsworth N.R. Cordell G.A. Pezzuto J.M. Kinghorn A.D. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1996; 99: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) as a compound that inhibited the proliferation of a number of human cancer cell lines and triggered an increase in the G2/M peak of the cell cycle profile. This effect was attributed to an arrest in G2 phase rather than M phase because OZ failed to block a microtubule-dependent change in the morphology of rat astrocytes that has been used as an indirect assay to detect antimitotic agents (35Suffness M. Douros J. J. Nat. Prod. (Lloydia). 1982; 45: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 36Abe K. Saito H. Brain Res. 1999; 837: 306-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 37Baden D.

We rediscovered this compound while screening extracts from the NCI National Institutes of Health Natural Products Repository for inhibitors of the G2 checkpoint. The use of a mitosis-specific monoclonal antibody in flow cytometry allowed us to show that OZ exerts two main cell cycle effects: it inhibits the G2 DNA damage checkpoint, and it causes mitotic arrest. As a G2 checkpoint inhibitor, OZ acts in the low micromolar range, comparing favorably to other checkpoint inhibitors, which act in the millimolar range (caffeine (19Rowley R. Radiat.

At its optimal concentration, it released 15–20% of MCF-7 mp53 cells from G2 arrest, compared with 30–40% for DBH and IGR and 60–70% for caffeine and UCN-01. OZ showed higher efficacy toward HCT116p53 −/− cells. The most efficacious checkpoint inhibitors found so far inhibit either DNA damage-proximal targets such as ATM for caffeine (43Sarkaria J.

An attractive possibility is that OZ owes its lower efficacy to the targeting of a discrete branch of the checkpoint pathway. The property of a G2 checkpoint inhibitor that may be of value in the clinical setting is its ability to sensitize cells with mutated p53 to DNA-damaging agents. OZ is toxic to non-irradiated cells at concentrations that inhibit the checkpoint. This fact and the narrow active concentration range of the compound make OZ unsuitable as a drug candidate. However, less toxic analogues of OZ could be synthesized. Lee et al. (31Lee I.-K. Shamon L.A. Chai B.H. Chagwedera T.E. Besterman J.M. Farnsworth N.R. Cordell G.A. Pezzuto J.M. Kinghorn A.D. Chem.

We found that the same reaction prevented checkpoint inhibition, indicating that the regions of OZ responsible for checkpoint inhibition and toxicity may be separable. For several reasons, the action of OZ as a checkpoint inhibitor is unusual. The G2 checkpoint inhibitors identified to date act upon checkpoint kinases (caffeine, pentoxifylline, 2-aminopurine, DBH, and UCN-01) (19Rowley R. Radiat.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 976-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). OZ is not an in vitro inhibitor of checkpoint kinases or Ser/Thr protein phosphatases. Second, the chemical structure of OZ does not resemble that of other checkpoint inhibitors. Furthermore, the requirement of an unsaturated α, β-carbonyl group for the checkpoint-inhibiting activity of OZ suggests that the drug interacts with cysteine residues on its target, a mechanism that has not been reported for checkpoint inhibitors. Agents that block cells in mitosis typically interact directly with tubulin, impeding the formation and function of the mitotic spindle.In vitro, vinblastine and nocodazole prevent microtubule polymerization, whereas paclitaxel stimulates microtubule polymerization (reviewed in Ref. 49Jordan M. Wilson L. Methods Cell Biol. 1999; 61: 267-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, OZ had neither activity, indicating that it does not target microtubules. Individually, the chromosomes of OZ-treated cells did not appear different from those in normal metaphase. However, their scattered distribution along the spindle apparatus suggests a defect in their movement to the midline. It is possible that OZ inhibits a spindle-associated motor protein that is required for chromosome congression. This phenotype resembles that of Xenopus laevis extracts lacking the chromokinesin Xkid1 (50Funabiki H. Murray A. Cell. 2000; 102: 411-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 51Antonio C. Ferby I. Wilhelm H. Jones M. Karsenti E. Nebreda A.R. Vernos I. Cell. 2000; 102: 425-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) with the exception that the chromosomes of OZ-treated cells do not appear stretched. Alternatively, OZ may interfere with the attachment of chromosome kinetochores to the K fibers of the spindle and thus prevent their equatorial movement. We chose to screen a natural product collection because these contain diverse and complex compounds, increasing our chances of finding drugs that act in new ways to inhibit the G2 checkpoint. This work suggests that OZ does not act through the checkpoint kinases or phosphatases known at present. We have found that OZ-treated cells also arrest in mitosis but that, unlike most antimitotic agents, OZ is not a spindle poison. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that OZ interacts with more than one target, an attractive concept is that OZ inhibits an activity that is part of the checkpoint pathway and that also plays a role in chromosomal movement during mitosis. This hypothesis is currently under investigation in experiments designed to identify the target of OZ. We thank Gordon M.

The predicted sequence of the UNP protein features motifs common to viral oncoproteins through which these proteins interact with the retinoblastoma gene product pRb, as well as the related 'pocket proteins' p107 and p130. We have explored the possibility that UNP interacts with pocket proteins, and report here that such associations can be detected in vitro and in cells. Associations of UNP and pocket proteins are sensitive to site-directed mutations in a manner directly analogous to those documented in viral oncoproteins.

https://openalex.org/W2034333358,"The epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) is a heteromultimer composed of three subunits, each having two membrane-spanning domains with intracellular amino and carboxyl termini. Several hormones and proteins regulate channel activity, but the molecular nature of this regulation is unknown. We conducted experiments to determine a possible new site within the carboxyl terminus of the α-subunit involved in enhanced channel activity through endogenous kinases. When an α-subunit that was truncated to remove a PY motif was expressed in <i>Xenopus</i> oocytes with wild type human β- and γ-ENaC subunits, channel activity was greatly enhanced. The removal of the entire intracellular carboxyl terminus of the α-subunit eliminated this enhanced basal activity. Using several point mutations, we localized this site to two amino acid residues (Pro<sup>595</sup>-Gly<sup>596</sup>) near the second membrane-spanning domain. The nonspecific kinase inhibitor staurosporine inhibits basal channel activity of wild type ENaC but was ineffective in inhibiting channels mutated at this site. The major effect of these mutations was not on channel kinetics but was largely, if not entirely, on the number of active channels on the cell surface. This region is potentially important in effecting kinase-mediated increases in ENaC activity."
https://openalex.org/W2323746005,"Mutations of PTEN, which encodes a protein-tyrosine and lipid phosphatase, are prevalent in a variety of human cancers. The human genome ‘draft’ sequence still lacks organization and much of the PTEN and adjacent loci remain undefined. The pufferfish, Fugu rubripes, by virtue of having a compact genome represents an excellent template for rapid vertebrate gene discovery. Sequencing of 56 kb from the Fugu pten (fpten) locus identified four complete genes and one partial gene homologous to human genes. Genes neighboring fpten include a PAPS synthase (fpapss2) differentially expressed between non-metastatic/metastatic human carcinoma cell lines, an inositol phosphatase (fminpp1) and an omega class glutathione-S-transferase (fgsto). We have determined the order of human BAC clones at the hPTEN locus and that the locus contains hPAPSS2 and hMINPP1 genes oriented as are their Fugu orthologs. Although the human genes span 500 kb, the Fugu genes lie within only 22 kb due to the compressed intronic and intergenic regions that typify this genome. Interestingly, and providing striking evidence of regulatory element conservation between widely divergent vertebrate species, the compact 2.1 kb fpten promoter is active in human cells. Also, like hPTEN, fpten has a growth and tumor suppressor activity in human glioblastoma cells, demonstrating conservation of protein function."

Reznikoff W.S. Craig M.L. McQuade K.L. Schlax P.J. Neidhardt F.C. Curtis III, R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.R. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular biology, 2nd ed. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 792-820Google Scholar). In addition to these core promoter elements many promoters contain an A-T-rich region located upstream of the −35 region (reviewed recently in Ref. 2Gourse R.L. Ross W. Gaal T. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 687-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). This so-called UP element was discovered first in promoters for ribosomal RNA where it was recognized that the UP element increased transcription from these promoters in a factor-independent fashion, suggesting its direct effect on RNA polymerase (3Leirmo S. Gourse R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 555-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The α-subunit of RNA polymerase was subsequently identified as a target for a direct contact with the UP element (4Ross W. Gosink K.K. Salomon J. Igarashi K. Zou C. Ishihama A. Severinov K. Gourse R.L. Science. 1993; 262: 1407-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Mutations of the α-subunit defective in UP element binding were found in the C-terminal domain of the α-subunit, identifying two regions (vicinity of residues 265 and 298, respectively) in this domain as important for UP element recognition (5 and 6). The C-terminal DNA-binding domain of α is attached to the N-terminal domain of the protein by a long, flexible linker (7 and 8). 1E. Heyduk, S. Callaci K. Murakami, A. Ishihama, and T. Heyduk, unpublished manuscript.1E. Heyduk, S. Callaci K. Murakami, A. Ishihama, and T. Heyduk, unpublished manuscript. Site selection experiments were used to identify the consensus UP element sequence (9Estrem S.T. Gaal T. Ross W. Gourse R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9761-9766Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Further studies revealed that the UP element consists of two subsites, the proximal and the distal site, and each of these sites binds one monomer of the α-subunit (10Estrem S.T. Ross W. Gaal T. Chen Z.W.S. Niu W. Ebright R.H. Gourse R.L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2134-2147Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Fine mapping of the α-subunit-UP element interactions revealed that the α-subunit interacted with the bases in the minor groove and with the DNA backbone along the minor groove. The interactions with the major groove were found to be minimal (11Ross W. Ernst A. Gourse R.L. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 491-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).The mechanism of UP element-induced enhancement of transcription is not completely clear. The simplest model could be that the additional contact between the UP element and the α-subunit activates transcription by facilitating the initial recognition of promoter DNA by RNA polymerase. The data available for rrnB P1 promoter show that indeed the UP element enhances recruitment of polymerase to the promoter (3Leirmo S. Gourse R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 555-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 12Rao L. Ross W. Appleman J.A. Gaal T. McQuade K.L. Schlax P.J. Record Jr., M.T. Gourse R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1421-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). However, there is also evidence that at some step downstream the initial recognition could be affected by the UP element-α-subunit interaction (12 and 13). Moreover, evidence exists that α-subunit-DNA interactions could inhibit promoter clearance (14Ellinger T. Behnke D. Knaus R. Bujard H. Gralla J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 466-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and facilitate formation of non-productive complexes (15Tagami H. Aiba H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7202-7207Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The effects of α-subunit-UP element interactions on transcription in principle could be a result of the additional binding energy provided by this contact or could also involve conformational changes within the polymerase-promoter complex induced by α-subunit-DNA contact. DNase I footprinting experiments suggested that an interaction of the α-subunit with the UP element in the context of RNA polymerase holoenzyme and promoter involved distortions within or nearby the UP element DNA (10, 16, and 17). No information regarding the effects of DNA on an α-subunit conformation is available. Here we show the thermodynamic and structural data suggesting that the interaction between an isolated α-subunit with UP element-containing DNA has a rigid body character. No significant perturbation of either the DNA or the protein structure could be detected.DISCUSSIONThe thermodynamics of many site-specific DNA-binding proteins have been studied (33Härd T. Lundbäck T. Bipohys. Chem. 1996; 62: 121-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 34Jen-Jacobson L. Biopolymers. 1997; 44: 153-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 35Jen-Jacobson L.

Supramol. Chem. 2000; 12: 143-153Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Although it has been difficult to make generalized conclusions regarding the energetics of these interactions, certain correlations between the energetics and the specificity or the energetics and the distortion of DNA in protein-DNA complex formation emerged. Proteins exhibiting site-specific DNA binding activity are also able to bind more weakly to nonspecific DNA. Comparison of the thermodynamics of binding to specific and nonspecific sequences showed that specific binding most often is characterized by a large negative Δcp, whereas nonspecific binding exhibited Δcp close to zero (36Jen-Jacobson L. Engler L.E. Ames J.T. Kurpiewski M.R. Grogorescu A. Supramol. Chem. 2000; 12: 143-153Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that a negative Δcp is the thermodynamic signature of tight site-specific binding in which a tight complementary recognition interface is formed (36Jen-Jacobson L. Engler L.E. Ames J.T. Kurpiewski M.R. Grogorescu A. Supramol. Chem. 2000; 12: 143-153Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The large negative Δcp has been proposed to arise from the burial of large amounts of hydrophobic surfaces in protein-DNA complex as a result of local folding coupled to protein-DNA complex formation (37Spolar R.S Record Jr., M.T. Science. 1994; 263: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (1367) Google Scholar). Many protein-DNA complexes are formed with a significant distortion of the DNA. When the thermodynamics of ten protein-DNA complexes involving varying degrees of DNA distortions were examined, a striking new correlation was found (35Jen-Jacobson L. Engler L.E. Jacobson L.A. Structure. 2000; 8: 1015-1023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Formation of site-specific protein-DNA complexes involving significant distortion of DNA was entropy-driven, whereas for the complexes involving relatively undistorted DNA unfavorable entropy and favorable enthalpy was observed (35Jen-Jacobson L. Engler L.E. Jacobson L.A. Structure. 2000; 8: 1015-1023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). In agreement with such correlation between the energetics and distortion of DNA in protein-DNA complex, the nonspecific DNA binding for many proteins was found to be enthalpy-driven (36Jen-Jacobson L. Engler L.E. Ames J.T. Kurpiewski M.R. Grogorescu A. Supramol. Chem. 2000; 12: 143-153Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Nonspecific interactions are not expected to involve large distortion of DNA.Interaction of the α-subunit with UP element DNA is enthalpy-driven and exhibits near zero value of Δcp. Comparison of the thermodynamic parameters describing α-UP element interaction with the described above observed for other DNA binding proteins implies that a tight complementary recognition interface is not formed, and the α-subunit-UP element contact resembles more the nonspecific rather then specific interaction. Such a thermodynamic signature seems to be consistent with a rather modest discrimination between the UP element DNA and nonspecific DNA (Fig. 1). A rather fine balance between specific and nonspecific DNA binding activity of the α-subunit is probably functionally significant. In addition to the RNA polymerase activation through UP element-α-subunit contact, interaction of the α-subunit with nonspecific DNA is likely to play a role in the activity of some transcriptional activators. It has been observed that protein-protein contact between the activator and the polymerase can induce nonspecific α-subunit-promoter DNA contact, and it is likely that these two macromolecular contacts cooperate to activate polymerase (2Gourse R.L. Ross W. Gaal T. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 687-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 38Murakami K. Owens J.T. Belyaeva T.A. Meares C.F. Busby S.J. Ishihama A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11274-11278Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Due to a low affinity of the α-subunit for nonspecific DNA, we were unable to perform a protein footprinting experiment in this case, but it is very likely that the same region of α-subunit would be involved in binding to specific and nonspecific DNA.The high entropy cost of the α-subunit-UP element complex formation can be rationalized by observing that DNA binding elements of the α-subunit are located in the C-terminal domain of the protein, which is attached to the rest of the protein by a long, flexible linker. The flexibility of the C-terminal domains of the α-subunit is reflected in the absence of the interpretable electron density corresponding to the C-terminal domains in the crystal structure of the core polymerase (39Zhang G. Campbell E.A. Minakhin L. Richter C. Severinov K. Darst S. Cell. 1999; 98: 811-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar) and was also detected by NMR (8Jeon Y.H. Yamazaki T. Otomo T. Ishihama A. Kyogoku Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 953-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and fluorescence 1E. Heyduk, S. Callaci K. Murakami, A. Ishihama, and T. Heyduk, unpublished manuscript.experiments. The UP element was shown to contain two subsites, each of which interacted with one of the monomers in the α-subunit dimer (10Estrem S.T. Ross W. Gaal T. Chen Z.W.S. Niu W. Ebright R.H. Gourse R.L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2134-2147Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Formation of the α-subunit-UP element complex would restrict the mobility of these flexible domains resulting in large, unfavorable entropic contribution.The thermodynamic features of the α-subunit-UP element complex formation are also consistent with the absence of major distortions in either DNA or in the protein molecule. We have performed two additional experiments in which the conformational changes in the protein and in the DNA upon protein-DNA complex formation were probed. Protein footprinting experiments revealed no changes in the protein other then those that could be assigned to a direct protein-DNA contact (Fig. 4). CD spectroscopy showed no perturbation of DNA structure upon protein-DNA complex formation (Fig. 5). It appears, therefore, that the α-subunit-UP element complex formation involves rigid body interactions between the C-terminal domains of the α-subunit and UP element DNA without significant perturbation of the structure of either the protein or the DNA component of the complex. This conclusion is consistent with both the thermodynamic characteristics of the binding as well as with direct probing of the structure of the components of the complex. The role of the α-subunit-UP element contact formation in the context of promoter DNA has been proposed to be the enhancement of the recruitment of the polymerase to the promoter (27Baichoo N Heyduk T. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 518-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A simple, rigid-body-like nature of the α-subunit-UP element contact would be consistent with such a role.It is interesting to observe that DNA footprinting experiments with promoter DNA containing the UP element detected perturbation of DNA structure in the vicinity of the UP element (10, 16 and 17). Our experiments with isolated UP element and isolated α-subunit showed no perturbation of either DNA or the protein structure. It can be concluded, therefore, that the perturbation of DNA structure by the α-subunit-UP element contact requires constraints imposed by other protein-nucleic acid interactions involved in RNA polymerase binding to promoter DNA.

The data available for rrnB P1 promoter show that indeed the UP element enhances recruitment of polymerase to the promoter (3Leirmo S. Gourse R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 555-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 12Rao L. Ross W. Appleman J.A. Gaal T. McQuade K.L. Schlax P.J. Record Jr., M.T. Gourse R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1421-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). However, there is also evidence that at some step downstream the initial recognition could be affected by the UP element-α-subunit interaction (12 and 13). Moreover, evidence exists that α-subunit-DNA interactions could inhibit promoter clearance (14Ellinger T. Behnke D. Knaus R. Bujard H. Gralla J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 466-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and facilitate formation of non-productive complexes (15Tagami H. Aiba H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7202-7207Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The effects of α-subunit-UP element interactions on transcription in principle could be a result of the additional binding energy provided by this contact or could also involve conformational changes within the polymerase-promoter complex induced by α-subunit-DNA contact. DNase I footprinting experiments suggested that an interaction of the α-subunit with the UP element in the context of RNA polymerase holoenzyme and promoter involved distortions within or nearby the UP element DNA (10, 16, and 17). No information regarding the effects of DNA on an α-subunit conformation is available. Here we show the thermodynamic and structural data suggesting that the interaction between an isolated α-subunit with UP element-containing DNA has a rigid body character. No significant perturbation of either the DNA or the protein structure could be detected. DISCUSSIONThe thermodynamics of many site-specific DNA-binding proteins have been studied (33Härd T. Lundbäck T. Bipohys. Chem. 1996; 62: 121-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 34Jen-Jacobson L. Biopolymers. 1997; 44: 153-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 35Jen-Jacobson L. Engler L.E. Jacobson L.A. Structure. 2000; 8: 1015-1023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 36Jen-Jacobson L. Engler L.E. Ames J.T. Kurpiewski M.R. Grogorescu A. Supramol. Chem. 2000; 12: 143-153Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Although it has been difficult to make generalized conclusions regarding the energetics of these interactions, certain correlations between the energetics and the specificity or the energetics and the distortion of DNA in protein-DNA complex formation emerged. Proteins exhibiting site-specific DNA binding activity are also able to bind more weakly to nonspecific DNA. Comparison of the thermodynamics of binding to specific and nonspecific sequences showed that specific binding most often is characterized by a large negative Δcp, whereas nonspecific binding exhibited Δcp close to zero (36Jen-Jacobson L. Engler L.E. Ames J.T. Kurpiewski M.R. Grogorescu A. Supramol. Chem. 2000; 12: 143-153Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that a negative Δcp is the thermodynamic signature of tight site-specific binding in which a tight complementary recognition interface is formed (36Jen-Jacobson L. Engler L.E. Ames J.T. Kurpiewski M.R. Grogorescu A. Supramol. Chem. 2000; 12: 143-153Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The large negative Δcp has been proposed to arise from the burial of large amounts of hydrophobic surfaces in protein-DNA complex as a result of local folding coupled to protein-DNA complex formation (37Spolar R.S Record Jr., M.T. Science. 1994; 263: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (1367) Google Scholar). Many protein-DNA complexes are formed with a significant distortion of the DNA. When the thermodynamics of ten protein-DNA complexes involving varying degrees of DNA distortions were examined, a striking new correlation was found (35Jen-Jacobson L. Engler L.E. Jacobson L.A. Structure. 2000; 8: 1015-1023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Formation of site-specific protein-DNA complexes involving significant distortion of DNA was entropy-driven, whereas for the complexes involving relatively undistorted DNA unfavorable entropy and favorable enthalpy was observed (35Jen-Jacobson L. Engler L.E. Jacobson L.A. Structure. 2000; 8: 1015-1023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). In agreement with such correlation between the energetics and distortion of DNA in protein-DNA complex, the nonspecific DNA binding for many proteins was found to be enthalpy-driven (36Jen-Jacobson L. Engler L.E. Ames J.T. Kurpiewski M.R. Grogorescu A. Supramol. Chem. 2000; 12: 143-153Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Nonspecific interactions are not expected to involve large distortion of DNA.Interaction of the α-subunit with UP element DNA is enthalpy-driven and exhibits near zero value of Δcp. Comparison of the thermodynamic parameters describing α-UP element interaction with the described above observed for other DNA binding proteins implies that a tight complementary recognition interface is not formed, and the α-subunit-UP element contact resembles more the nonspecific rather then specific interaction. Such a thermodynamic signature seems to be consistent with a rather modest discrimination between the UP element DNA and nonspecific DNA (Fig. 1). A rather fine balance between specific and nonspecific DNA binding activity of the α-subunit is probably functionally significant. In addition to the RNA polymerase activation through UP element-α-subunit contact, interaction of the α-subunit with nonspecific DNA is likely to play a role in the activity of some transcriptional activators. It has been observed that protein-protein contact between the activator and the polymerase can induce nonspecific α-subunit-promoter DNA contact, and it is likely that these two macromolecular contacts cooperate to activate polymerase (2Gourse R.L. Ross W. Gaal T. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 687-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 38Murakami K. Owens J.T. Belyaeva T.A. Meares C.F. Busby S.J. Ishihama A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11274-11278Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Due to a low affinity of the α-subunit for nonspecific DNA, we were unable to perform a protein footprinting experiment in this case, but it is very likely that the same region of α-subunit would be involved in binding to specific and nonspecific DNA.The high entropy cost of the α-subunit-UP element complex formation can be rationalized by observing that DNA binding elements of the α-subunit are located in the C-terminal domain of the protein, which is attached to the rest of the protein by a long, flexible linker. The flexibility of the C-terminal domains of the α-subunit is reflected in the absence of the interpretable electron density corresponding to the C-terminal domains in the crystal structure of the core polymerase (39Zhang G. Campbell E.A. Minakhin L. Richter C. Severinov K. Darst S. Cell. 1999; 98: 811-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar) and was also detected by NMR (8Jeon Y.H. Yamazaki T. Otomo T. Ishihama A. Kyogoku Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 953-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and fluorescence 1E. Heyduk, S. Callaci K. Murakami, A. Ishihama, and T. Heyduk, unpublished manuscript.experiments. The UP element was shown to contain two subsites, each of which interacted with one of the monomers in the α-subunit dimer (10Estrem S.T. Ross W. Gaal T. Chen Z.W.S. Niu W. Ebright R.H. Gourse R.L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2134-2147Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Formation of the α-subunit-UP element complex would restrict the mobility of these flexible domains resulting in large, unfavorable entropic contribution.The thermodynamic features of the α-subunit-UP element complex formation are also consistent with the absence of major distortions in either DNA or in the protein molecule. We have performed two additional experiments in which the conformational changes in the protein and in the DNA upon protein-DNA complex formation were probed. Protein footprinting experiments revealed no changes in the protein other then those that could be assigned to a direct protein-DNA contact (Fig. 4). CD spectroscopy showed no perturbation of DNA structure upon protein-DNA complex formation (Fig. 5). It appears, therefore, that the α-subunit-UP element complex formation involves rigid body interactions between the C-terminal domains of the α-subunit and UP element DNA without significant perturbation of the structure of either the protein or the DNA component of the complex. This conclusion is consistent with both the thermodynamic characteristics of the binding as well as with direct probing of the structure of the components of the complex. The role of the α-subunit-UP element contact formation in the context of promoter DNA has been proposed to be the enhancement of the recruitment of the polymerase to the promoter (27Baichoo N Heyduk T. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 518-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A simple, rigid-body-like nature of the α-subunit-UP element contact would be consistent with such a role.It is interesting to observe that DNA footprinting experiments with promoter DNA containing the UP element detected perturbation of DNA structure in the vicinity of the UP element (10, 16 and 17). Our experiments with isolated UP element and isolated α-subunit showed no perturbation of either DNA or the protein structure. It can be concluded, therefore, that the perturbation of DNA structure by the α-subunit-UP element contact requires constraints imposed by other protein-nucleic acid interactions involved in RNA polymerase binding to promoter DNA.

https://openalex.org/W2334828688,"CAG/CTG repeat expansions in genomic DNA of testicular tumour cell lines, and germline DNA from members of families predisposed to this malignancy, have been previously described. In order to identify genes possibly concerned by this alteration, we attempted to clone all possible human testis cDNA containing at least five CAG/CTG repeats. Thirty-four different transcripts were identified. By using PCR and non denaturing gel electrophoresis, we determined the size of their repeats, as well as their polymorphisms in a collection of human testicular germ cell tumours and the normal surrounding tissues. For all tested genes, we detected the presence of several species of the same mRNA for each person. Nine genes exhibited specific patterns of expression among different groups of individuals, indicative of polymorphism. None of these polymorphisms was related to human testicular tumours."
