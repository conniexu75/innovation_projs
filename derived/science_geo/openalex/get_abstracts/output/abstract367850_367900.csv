https://openalex.org/W2098597355,"Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder with a lifetime risk of about 1%, characterized by hallucinations, delusions and cognitive deficits, with heritability estimated at up to 80%1,2. We performed a genome-wide association study of 3,322 European individuals with schizophrenia and 3,587 controls. Here we show, using two analytic approaches, the extent to which common genetic variation underlies the risk of schizophrenia. First, we implicate the major histocompatibility complex. Second, we provide molecular genetic evidence for a substantial polygenic component to the risk of schizophrenia involving thousands of common alleles of very small effect. We show that this component also contributes to the risk of bipolar disorder, but not to several non-psychiatric diseases."

After 2 x 10(6) hMSCs were i.v. infused into mice, most of the cells were trapped as emboli in lung. The cells in lung disappeared with a half-life of about 24 hr, but <1000 cells appeared in six other tissues. The hMSCs in lung upregulated expression of multiple genes, with a large increase in the anti-inflammatory protein TSG-6. After myocardial infarction, i.v. hMSCs, but not hMSCs transduced with TSG-6 siRNA, decreased inflammatory responses, reduced infarct size, and improved cardiac function. I.v. administration of recombinant TSG-6 also reduced inflammatory responses and reduced infarct size. The results suggest that improvements in animal models and patients after i.v. infusions of MSCs are at least in part explained by activation of MSCs to secrete TSG-6."
https://openalex.org/W2127205775,"Based on its symptoms, schizophrenia has been considered a discrete disease, and yet genome-wide association studies for copy number variations (CNVs) associated with the disease have revealed that some CNVs confer high relative risk of schizophrenia but also of other psychiatric disorders. But CNVs can affect several genes. Now, a genome-wide association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using data from several large genome-wide scans reveals significant associations to individual loci that implicate immunity, brain development, memory and cognition in predisposition to schizophrenia. Here, in the first of three papers on the genetics of schizophrenia, a genome-wide association study of single nucleotide polymorphisms using data from several large genome-wide scans reveals significant associations to individual loci that implicate perturbations in immunity, brain development, memory and cognition in the predisposition to schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a complex disorder, caused by both genetic and environmental factors and their interactions. Research on pathogenesis has traditionally focused on neurotransmitter systems in the brain, particularly those involving dopamine. Schizophrenia has been considered a separate disease for over a century, but in the absence of clear biological markers, diagnosis has historically been based on signs and symptoms. A fundamental message emerging from genome-wide association studies of copy number variations (CNVs) associated with the disease is that its genetic basis does not necessarily conform to classical nosological disease boundaries. Certain CNVs confer not only high relative risk of schizophrenia but also of other psychiatric disorders1,2,3. The structural variations associated with schizophrenia can involve several genes and the phenotypic syndromes, or the ‘genomic disorders’, have not yet been characterized4. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based genome-wide association studies with the potential to implicate individual genes in complex diseases may reveal underlying biological pathways. Here we combined SNP data from several large genome-wide scans and followed up the most significant association signals. We found significant association with several markers spanning the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region on chromosome 6p21.3-22.1, a marker located upstream of the neurogranin gene (NRGN) on 11q24.2 and a marker in intron four of transcription factor 4 (TCF4) on 18q21.2. Our findings implicating the MHC region are consistent with an immune component to schizophrenia risk, whereas the association with NRGN and TCF4 points to perturbation of pathways involved in brain development, memory and cognition."
https://openalex.org/W1987774343,"Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) outwardly appear to be indistinguishable from embryonic stem cells (ESCs). A study of gene expression profiles of mouse and human ESCs and iPSCs suggests that, while iPSCs are quite similar to their embryonic counterparts, a recurrent gene expression signature appears in iPSCs regardless of their origin or the method by which they were generated. Upon extended culture, hiPSCs adopt a gene expression profile more similar to hESCs; however, they still retain a gene expression signature unique from hESCs that extends to miRNA expression. Genome-wide data suggested that the iPSC signature gene expression differences are due to differential promoter binding by the reprogramming factors. High-resolution array profiling demonstrated that there is no common specific subkaryotypic alteration that is required for reprogramming and that reprogramming does not lead to genomic instability. Together, these data suggest that iPSCs should be considered a unique subtype of pluripotent cell."

https://openalex.org/W2086316954,"Stem cells are controlled, in part, by genetic pathways frequently dysregulated during human tumorigenesis. Either stimulation of Wnt/beta-catenin signalling or overexpression of telomerase is sufficient to activate quiescent epidermal stem cells in vivo, although the mechanisms by which telomerase exerts these effects are not understood. Here we show that telomerase directly modulates Wnt/beta-catenin signalling by serving as a cofactor in a beta-catenin transcriptional complex. The telomerase protein component TERT (telomerase reverse transcriptase) interacts with BRG1 (also called SMARCA4), a SWI/SNF-related chromatin remodelling protein, and activates Wnt-dependent reporters in cultured cells and in vivo. TERT serves an essential role in formation of the anterior-posterior axis in Xenopus laevis embryos, and this defect in Wnt signalling manifests as homeotic transformations in the vertebrae of Tert(-/-) mice. Chromatin immunoprecipitation of the endogenous TERT protein from mouse gastrointestinal tract shows that TERT physically occupies gene promoters of Wnt-dependent genes. These data reveal an unanticipated role for telomerase as a transcriptional modulator of the Wnt/beta-catenin signalling pathway."

The poor survival of AML patients raises expectations that LSC-targeted therapies might achieve durable remissions. We report that an anti-interleukin-3 (IL-3) receptor α chain (CD123)-neutralizing antibody (7G3) targeted AML-LSCs, impairing homing to bone marrow (BM) and activating innate immunity of nonobese diabetic/severe-combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice. 7G3 treatment profoundly reduced AML-LSC engraftment and improved mouse survival. Mice with pre-established disease showed reduced AML burden in the BM and periphery and impaired secondary transplantation upon treatment, establishing that AML-LSCs were directly targeted. 7G3 inhibited IL-3-mediated intracellular signaling of isolated AML CD34+CD38− cells in vitro and reduced their survival. These results provide clear validation for therapeutic monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting of AML-LSCs and for translation of in vivo preclinical research findings toward a clinical application.

These results provide clear validation for therapeutic monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting of AML-LSCs and for translation of in vivo preclinical research findings toward a clinical application. The 5 year survival rate of patients under 60 years of age with AML is less than 30%, with progressively worse prognosis for more elderly patients (Estey and Dohner, 2006Estey E. Dohner H.

The cellular and molecular basis for this dismal picture is unclear; however, a large body of work is emerging in experimental systems that predicts LSCs may lie at the heart of posttreatment relapse and chemoresistance.

LSCs are the only AML cells capable of self-renewal while still generating rapidly proliferating progenitors and terminal leukemic blasts. The rare occurrence, generally dormant nature, and abnormal apoptotic response via the NF-κB pathway of LSCs are all properties that may render them resistant to conventional chemotherapeutics that target proliferating cells (Bonnet and Dick, 1997Bonnet D.

In addition, minimal residual disease occurrence and poor survival have been attributed to the ability of LSCs to engraft NOD/SCID mice (Pearce et al., 2006Pearce D.J. Taussig D. Zibara K. Smith L.L. Ridler C.M. Preudhomme C. Young B.D. Rohatiner A.Z. Lister T.A. Bonnet D.

Consequently, it is imperative that new treatments are developed to complement established chemotherapy by specifically eliminating AML-LSCs for the long-term management of the disease (Abutalib and Tallman, 2006Abutalib S.A.

As with normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), very little is known of the molecular regulation that governs the self-renewal, differentiation, and survival of AML-LSCs, although both of these stem cell types share the properties of slow division, self-renewal ability, and expression of some surface markers including the CD34+CD38− immunophenotype (Bhatia et al., 1997Bhatia M.

CD123 is the α subunit of the IL-3 receptor (IL-3R), the major binding protein for IL-3, which together with CD131 (βc) forms the functional heterodimeric high-affinity IL-3R. The binding of IL-3 to CD123 is species specific and leads to activation of the receptor that promotes cell survival and proliferation (Bagley et al., 1997Bagley C.J. Woodcock J.M. Stomski F.C.

Moreover, high-level CD123 expression on AML cells correlates with the level of IL-3-stimulated and spontaneous signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) activation, the proportion of cycling cells, a more primitive cell-surface phenotype, and resistance to apoptosis (Graf et al., 2004Graf M.

Clinically, high CD123 expression in AML is associated with higher blast counts at diagnosis and a lower complete remission rate that results in reduced survival (Graf et al., 2004Graf M. Hecht K.

Collectively, these data point to the significance of CD123 expression in leukemia cell stimulation and AML patient outcome. The increased expression of CD123 on LSCs compared with HSCs presents an opportunity for selectively targeting AML-LSCs with a therapeutic antibody. Besides the possibility that IL-3 is required for LSC functions, an antibody to CD123 could stimulate host immune-mediated mechanisms for cell killing. An antibody with both IL-3R-neutralizing and innate immunity-activating properties could represent an ideal therapeutic candidate for clinical testing. The mAb 7G3, raised against CD123, has previously been shown to inhibit IL-3-mediated proliferation of leukemic cell lines (Sun et al., 1996Sun Q. Woodcock J.M. Rapoport A. Stomski F.C. Korpelainen E.I. Bagley C.J. Goodall G.J. Smith W.B. Gamble J.R. Vadas M.A. et al.Monoclonal antibody 7G3 recognizes the N-terminal domain of the human interleukin-3 (IL-3) receptor alpha-chain and functions as a specific IL-3 receptor antagonist.Blood. 1996; 87: 83-92Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). While AML-LSCs are often cited to be enriched in the CD34+CD38− fraction, recent reports have demonstrated that other fractions, such as the CD34+CD38+ subpopulation, also have NOD/SCID repopulating capacity (McKenzie et al., 2006McKenzie J.L. Gan O.I. Doedens M. Wang J.C. Dick J.E. Individual stem cells with highly variable proliferation and self-renewal properties comprise the human hematopoietic stem cell compartment.Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 1225-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, Taussig et al., 2008Taussig D.C. Miraki-Moud F. Anjos-Afonso F. Pearce D.J. Allen K. Ridler C. Lillington D. Oakervee H.

In this report, we show that CD123 is highly expressed on the bulk of AML cells as well as the CD34+CD38− fraction compared to normal hematopoietic cells. Importantly, we demonstrate that 7G3 targeting of CD123 in the absence of exogenous human cytokines impairs AML-LSCs in vivo. This occurs through at least two mechanisms involving inhibition of homing of CD34+CD38− cells and engraftment of AML-LSCs in the NOD/SCID xenograft model, as well as activation of innate immunity in NOD/SCID mice. As a prerequisite for the potential role of 7G3 in inhibiting IL-3-mediated growth advantages on AML-LSCs, we demonstrate that both the unsorted and the CD34+CD38− subpopulations of AML cells proliferate and survive via IL-3-mediated intracellular signaling pathways and that these are inhibited by 7G3 in vitro. The recent characterization of defined populations of cancer stem cells (CSCs) in a range of human malignancies (Wang, 2007Wang J.C. Evaluating therapeutic efficacy against cancer stem cells: new challenges posed by a new paradigm.Cell Stem Cell. 2007; 1: 497-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), as well as their relative resistance to conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy (Rich and Bao, 2007Rich J.N. Bao S.

Since AML-LSCs are central to long-term AML growth and they are difficult to assay in vitro, we used the SCID-leukemia initiating cell (SL-IC) assay to determine whether 7G3 can directly target AML-LSCs and inhibit their repopulating ability. Ex vivo 7G3 incubation markedly reduced the engraftment of 10 of 11 primary AML samples in sublethally irradiated NOD/SCID mice to a mean of 11.4% ± 1.9% of isotype-matched (IgG2a-treated) controls (p = 0.00021, Figure 1A, Table 1). This reduction in engraftment was sustained in five of seven samples when assessed between 8 and 10 weeks following inoculation (5.7% ± 1.7% of controls, p = 0.004). Ex vivo 7G3 treatment inhibited the engraftment of AML-8 harvested at both diagnosis and relapse to a similar extent. AML-5 was the only AML sample in which engraftment was not reduced by ex vivo 7G3 treatment. Although the reason for this is unknown, it is noteworthy that AML-5 is a monosomy 7 sample (noted for poor prognosis) with relatively low CD123 expression (Table 1).Table 1Patient Characteristics, CD123 Expression, and Effects of mAb 7G3 on Engraftment of AML and Normal Hematopoietic CellsCells TransplantedAge/SexAML SubtypeCytogeneticsFlt3 Mutational StatusWCCCurrent Clinical StatusSample TypeOverall Survival (Days)CD34+ CD38− (%)CD123 (RFI)Effect of 7G3 (Engraftment as % Control)AML169/FaAt diagnosis (this column).M0bFAB criteria (this column).NormalMutant231aAt diagnosis (this column).DeceasedApheresis288cFrom date of initial diagnosis (this column).2.9dPercent of total population (this column).52.1eRFI of CD34+CD38− population (this column).15.2fMean engraftment in the ex vivo 7G3-treated group as a percentage of the IgG2a-treated group, based on Figures 1A and 1B (this column).270/FM1NormalMutant270DeceasedApheresis1962.226.15.3364/FM5bNormalWild-type80DeceasedBM13780.0489.9gSample had very low proportion of CD34+ cells.19.5475/MM5aTrisomy 8Mutant300DeceasedApheresis273.536.54.7519/FM2Maturation/monosomy 7NA108DeceasedNANA6.213.897.1653/MM4EoInv16Mutant300DeceasedBM5044.924.21.5780/MM5NANA122NAApheresis451.9802847/FM4NANA33DeceasedApheresis4368.284611.18—Relapse47/FM4NANA33DeceasedApheresis4366.652.417.3955/FM5a46XXNA161NAApheresis435.176.11.41080/FM246XXNA130NAApheresisNA38.57.623.21178/MM2NormalWild-type166DeceasedBM260.251.7gSample had very low proportion of CD34+ cells.NE1267/MM5bNormalMutant212DeceasedBM2020gSample had very low proportion of CD34+ cells.NENormalNBM-126/M–––––BM–0.412139.9NBM-235/M–––––BM–2.36.734.8NBM-332/M–––––BM–0.4750.4NBM-4NA–––––BM–NANA70.3CB-1NA–––––CB–NA12.779.1NBM-3 was a CD34+ sorted normal BM sample.

We next investigated the sensitivity of normal cord blood (CB) and BM (NBM) to 7G3 using the same strategy as for AML samples to determine if there was differential targeting of normal HSCs. When measured at 4–11 weeks postinoculation, 7G3 significantly reduced the engraftment of only two of five normal samples (Figure 1B and Table 1). The inhibitory effect of 7G3 on the engraftment of normal cells (76.5% ± 8.9% engraftment relative to IgG2a controls) was significantly less (p < 0.0001) than against AML cells. Additionally, 7G3 treatment did not alter the differentiation profiles of the engrafted normal human hematopoietic populations (data not shown). Furthermore, to demonstrate the clinical relevance and specificity of 7G3 treatment against LSCs and not normal HSCs, we showed that a mouse anti-human HLA-A,B,C antibody indiscriminately inhibited the engraftment of two AML and three normal samples (see Figure S1 available online). Independent analysis at two different institutions (Sydney and Toronto) revealed that CD123 expression on AML CD34+CD38− cells (relative fluorescence index [RFI] 38.2 ± 6.6) was significantly higher than on their normal counterparts (RFI 9.6 ± 1.6) (Figure 1C and Table 1). The engraftment levels of ex vivo 7G3-treated samples were inversely correlated with the intensity of CD123 expression on the CD34+CD38− population (Figure S2; Spearman R = −0.69). Taken together, we can conclude that normal HSCs are considerably less sensitive to 7G3 than AML-LSCs, due, at least in part, to their relatively low levels of cell-surface CD123 expression. The reduction in AML engraftment caused by ex vivo 7G3 treatment was also associated with improved survival. Mice transplanted with IgG2a- or 7G3-treated AML-9 cells exhibited median survival of 11.5 and 24 weeks, respectively (Figure 1D), with 40% of the 7G3 group surviving beyond the end of the experiment (25 weeks), in contrast with the control group, in which no mice survived beyond 20 weeks. To gain insight into the mechanism whereby 7G3 inhibited AML-LSC engraftment, we investigated the influence that antibody binding had on AML cell trafficking, since the SL-IC assay requires AML-LSCs to traffic to the BM in order to survive and proliferate, thereby establishing a leukemic graft. Homing assays were performed on two AML samples (AML-8-rel and -9) following ex vivo 7G3 treatments. 7G3 reduced the homing efficiency of AML-9 in the BM to 12.2% ± 2.7% and in the spleen to 9.4% ± 2.4% of controls (Figure 2A), and inhibited the homing of AML-8-rel in the BM to 34.7% ± 5.6% (Figure 3A) and in the spleen to 46.9% ± 3.5% of controls. To better distinguish the effects of 7G3 on AML homing, lodgment, and proliferation, ex vivo-treated AML-8-rel cells were transplanted intravenously (i.v.) via the tail vein or directly into the right femur (RF). The intrafemoral (IF) approach circumvents the AML-LSC trafficking/homing processes associated with the circulation (Mazurier et al., 2003Mazurier F. Doedens M. Gan O.I. Dick J.E. Rapid myeloerythroid repopulation after intrafemoral transplantation of NOD-SCID mice reveals a new class of human stem cells.Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 959-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). While 7G3 remained effective in significantly reducing the engraftment in both the injected femur and the noninjected bones, IF inoculation did attenuate the inhibitory effects of 7G3 on engraftment in comparison with i.v. inoculation (Figure 2B). In order to more directly demonstrate 7G3 inhibition of AML-LSCs, we investigated the impact of 7G3 treatment on CD34+CD38− cells since AML-LSCs are significantly enriched in this fraction (Bonnet and Dick, 1997Bonnet D. Dick J.E. Human acute myeloid leukemia is organized as a hierarchy that originates from a primitive hematopoietic cell.Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 730-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (5132) Google Scholar). The number of CD34+CD38− cells from AML-8-rel and AML-9 homing to the BM was reduced by ex vivo 7G3 treatment to 8.4% ± 0.018% and 12.0% ± 4.3% of control, respectively (Figure 2C). Similarly, the number of AML-9 CD34+CD38− cells homing to the spleen was reduced to 3.8% ± 1.5% of control. To further confirm this finding, the homing assay was repeated with sorted CD34+CD38− cells from AML-9 following ex vivo antibody treatment. The homing efficiency of human cells in the 7G3-treated group was reduced to 7.8% ± 1.7% of IgG2a controls in the BM and 11.2% ± 0.84% in the spleen (Figure 2D). Consistent with the observation that 7G3 diminished AML-LSC homing capacity, ex vivo 7G3 treatment reduced the number of CD34+CD38− cells in the BM xenografts of three AML samples (Figure 2E). By contrast, the number of CD34+CD38− cells present in xenografts established from four independent normal hematopoietic samples following ex vivo 7G3 treatment was 81.9% ± 11.6% of IgG2a controls (p = 0.19, data not shown). Collectively, we can conclude that 7G3 inhibits not only homing but also lodgment and proliferation of AML-LSCs in the BM microenvironment. In order to determine whether the inhibitory effects of 7G3 are Fc mediated, the homing efficiency of AML cells was examined following treatment with F(ab′)2 fragments of various CD123-targeting antibodies. Incubation of AML-8-rel with two MAbs clones, 6H6 and 9F5, that bind CD123 but are weakly neutralizing reduced the homing efficiency in the BM to a similar extent as 7G3 (Figure 3A). In contrast, when AML-8-rel cells were treated ex vivo with 7G3 or"

These extreme luminosities - if the emission is isotropic and below the theoretical (i.e. Eddington) limit, where the radiation pressure is balanced by the gravitational pressure - imply the presence of an accreting black hole with a mass of ~10^2-10^5 times that of the Sun. The existence of such intermediate mass black holes is in dispute, and though many candidates have been proposed, none are widely accepted as definitive. Here we report the detection of a variable X-ray source with a maximum 0.2-10 keV luminosity of up to 1.2 x 10^42 erg s^-1 in the edge-on spiral galaxy ESO 243-49, with an implied conservative lower limit of the mass of the black hole of ~500 Msun. This finding presents the strongest observational evidence to date for the existence of intermediate mass black holes, providing the long sought after missing link between the stellar mass and super-massive black hole populations."
https://openalex.org/W2039794026,"Neurotransmission relies on synaptic vesicles fusing with the membrane of nerve cells to release their neurotransmitter content into the synaptic cleft, a process requiring the assembly of several members of the SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) family. SNAREs represent an evolutionarily conserved protein family that mediates membrane fusion in the secretory and endocytic pathways of eukaryotic cells. On membrane contact, these proteins assemble in trans between the membranes as a bundle of four alpha-helices, with the energy released during assembly being thought to drive fusion. However, it is unclear how the energy is transferred to the membranes and whether assembly is conformationally linked to fusion. Here, we report the X-ray structure of the neuronal SNARE complex, consisting of rat syntaxin 1A, SNAP-25 and synaptobrevin 2, with the carboxy-terminal linkers and transmembrane regions at 3.4 A resolution. The structure shows that assembly proceeds beyond the already known core SNARE complex, resulting in a continuous helical bundle that is further stabilized by side-chain interactions in the linker region. Our results suggest that the final phase of SNARE assembly is directly coupled to membrane merger."

Although pluripotent stem cells have been obtained from defined germline stem cells (GSCs) of mouse neonatal testis, only multipotent stem cells have been obtained so far from defined cells of mouse adult testis. In this study we describe a robust and reproducible protocol for obtaining germline-derived pluripotent stem (gPS) cells from adult unipotent GSCs. Pluripotency of gPS cells was confirmed by in vitro and in vivo differentiation, including germ cell contribution and transmission. As determined by clonal analyses, gPS cells indeed originate from unipotent GSCs. We propose that the conversion process requires a GSC culture microenvironment that depends on the initial number of plated GSCs and the length of culture time."
https://openalex.org/W2069144282,"The cellular mechanisms that regulate the maintenance of adult tissue stem cells are still largely unknown. We show here that the p53 family member, TAp63, is essential for maintenance of epidermal and dermal precursors and that, in its absence, these precursors senesce and skin ages prematurely. Specifically, we have developed a TAp63 conditional knockout mouse and used it to ablate TAp63 in the germline (TAp63(-/-)) or in K14-expressing cells in the basal layer of the epidermis (TAp63(fl/fl);K14cre+). TAp63(-/-) mice age prematurely and develop blisters, skin ulcerations, senescence of hair follicle-associated dermal and epidermal cells, and decreased hair morphogenesis. These phenotypes are likely due to loss of TAp63 in dermal and epidermal precursors since both cell types show defective proliferation, early senescence, and genomic instability. These data indicate that TAp63 serves to maintain adult skin stem cells by regulating cellular senescence and genomic stability, thereby preventing premature tissue aging."
https://openalex.org/W2053941125,"Nod1 and Nod2 are members of the Nod-like receptor family that detect intracellular bacterial peptidoglycan-derived muramyl peptides. The biological effects of muramyl peptides have been described for over three decades, but the mechanism underlying their internalization to the cytosol remains unclear. Using the human epithelial cell line HEK293T as a model system, we demonstrate here that Nod1-activating ligands entered cells through endocytosis, most likely by the clathrin-coated pit pathway, as internalization was dynamin-dependent but not inhibited by methyl-β-cyclodextrin. In the endocytic pathway, the cytosolic internalization of Nod1 ligands was pH-dependent, occurred prior to the acidification mediated by the vacuolar ATPase, and was optimal at pH ranging from 5.5 to 6. Similarly, the Nod2 ligand MDP was internalized into host cytosol through a similar pathway with optimal pH for internalization ranging from 5.5 to 6.5. Moreover, Nod1-activating muramyl peptides likely required processing by endosomal enzymes, prior to transport into the cytosol, suggesting the existence of a sterically gated endosomal transporter for Nod1 ligands. In support for this, we identified a role for SLC15A4, an oligopeptide transporter expressed in early endosomes, in Nod1-dependent NF-κB signaling. Interestingly, SLC15A4 expression was also up-regulated in colonic biopsies from patients with inflammatory bowel disease, a disorder associated with mutations in Nod1 and Nod2. Together, our results shed light on the mechanisms by which muramyl peptides get access to the host cytosol, where they are detected by Nod1 and Nod2, and might have implications for the understanding of human diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease.

Innate immunity relies on the detection of conserved microbial- or danger-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs or DAMPs), 2The abbreviations used are: MAMPmicrobial-associated molecular patternsDAMPdanger-associated molecular patternTLRToll-like receptorNLRNod-like receptorLPSlipopolysaccharideMDPmuramyl dipeptideDAPdiaminopimelic acidM-Tri-DAPN-acetylmuramyl-l-Ala-d-Glu-mesoDAPiE-DAPdipeptide d-Glu-mesoDAPIBDinflammatory bowel diseaseV-ATPasevascular ATPaseDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumsiRNAsmall interference RNAMβCDmethyl-β-cyclodextrinSLCsolute carrierIBisotonic bufferCDCrohn's diseaseUCulcerative colitis. by pattern-recognition molecules. In mammals, several families of pattern-recognition molecules have been recently identified, including the transmembrane Toll-like receptors (TLRs), cytosolic Nod-like receptors (NLRs), and RIG-I-like receptors (1.Akira S. Uematsu S. Takeuchi O. Cell. 2006; 124: 783-801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8791) Google Scholar). NLR proteins include Nod1 and Nod2, which trigger pro-inflammatory pathways such as NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinases, in response to bacterial peptidoglycan (2.Fritz J.H. Ferrero R.L. Philpott D.J. Girardin S.E. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 1250-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar), and NLRPs (also known as Nalps), such as NLRP1 and NLRP3, which induce the activation of caspase-1 inflammasomes in response to various MAMPs and DAMPs (3.Benko S.

In the case of TLRs, there is accumulating evidence that the subcellular localization and the function of these pattern-recognition molecules is tightly associated, at multiple levels, with endocytosis and phagocytosis, which represent evolutionary conserved mechanisms for the internalization of small (<0.5 μm) and large (>0.5 μm) particles, respectively. Indeed, whereas some TLRs are expressed at the plasma membrane, others (such as TLR3, -7, and -9) are found predominantly associated with the endoplasmic reticulum and endosomal compartments, where they detect their respective microbial-derived nucleic acid MAMPs (4.Akira S. Takeda K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6702) Google Scholar). In particular, TLR9 has been shown to move from the endoplasmic reticulum to CpG DNA-containing endosomes, concurrent with the accumulation of MyD88, thus showing that endosomes represent the physiological location where TLR9-dependent signaling arises (5.Latz E. Schoenemeyer A. Visintin A. Fitzgerald K.A. Monks B.G. Knetter C.F. Lien E. Nilsen N.J. Espevik T. Golenbock D.T. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar). In addition, studies on TLR4 have demonstrated that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is endocytosed by a receptor-mediated mechanism dependent on dynamin and clathrin and co-localized with TLR4 on early/sorting endosomes (6.Husebye H. Halaas Ø. Stenmark H. Tunheim G. Sandanger Ø. Bogen B. Brech A. Latz E. Espevik T. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). In the case of this TLR, it is believed that endosomal trafficking is associated with termination of the MyD88-dependent pro-inflammatory signal (6.Husebye H. Halaas Ø. Stenmark H. Tunheim G. Sandanger Ø. Bogen B. Brech A. Latz E. Espevik T. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). In contrast, TLR4 in early endosomes has been shown recently to engage TRAM and TRIF adaptors, resulting in the ignition of type I interferon signaling in response to LPS (7.Kagan J.C. Su T. Horng T. Chow A. Akira S. Medzhitov R. Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). Therefore, the nature of the cellular response to LPS is dependent upon the subcellular localization of TLR4, thus reinforcing the importance of the interplay between TLR signaling and endosomal trafficking. A number of studies have also linked TLR signaling with phagosome maturation. Although it remains controversial whether TLR-dependent signaling actually drives phagosomal maturation (8.Blander J.M. Medzhitov R. Science. 2004; 304: 1014-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar, 9.Yates R.M. Russell D.G. Immunity. 2005; 23: 409-417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), it is clear that the processing of engulfed microbes within phagosomes regulates the availability of MAMPs within this compartment. Accordingly, Herskovits et al. have recently demonstrated that, in interferon Γ-activated macrophages, the degradation of Listeria monocytogenes in the phagolysosome generates bacterial molecules, which could specifically trigger type I interferon responses through a Nod2-dependent pathway (10.Herskovits A.A. Auerbuch V. Portnoy D.A. PLoS Pathog. 2007; 3: e51Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). This interesting observation suggests that innate immune signaling and microbial degradation within the phagolysosome are processes that are intimately linked. It also provides support to the concept that Nod-dependent signaling is associated with intracellular vesicular trafficking. Nod1 and Nod2 both detect specific structures from bacterial peptidoglycan (11.Girardin S.E. Travassos L.H. Hervé M. Blanot D. Boneca I.G. Philpott D.J. Sansonetti P.J. Mengin-Lecreulx D. J. Biol.

Interestingly, long before the identification of Nod1 and Nod2 as sensors of muramyl peptides and bacterial peptidoglycan, the biological activities of these bacterial-derived molecules had been studied extensively (17.Lederer E. J. Med. Chem. 1980; 23: 819-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 18.Lederer E. Drugs Exp. Clin. Res. 1986; 12: 429-440PubMed Google Scholar). It is well documented that these muramyl peptides trigger a multitude of immune responses, such as the induction of cytokines/chemokines, the production of nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species, and the clearance of microbes by phagocytic cells (17.Lederer E. J. Med. Chem. 1980; 23: 819-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 18.Lederer E. Drugs Exp. Clin. Res. 1986; 12: 429-440PubMed Google Scholar). A considerable literature also demonstrated that these muramyl peptides synergize with MAMPs detected by TLRs, such as LPS (19.Traub S. Kubasch N. Morath S. Kresse M. Hartung T. Schmidt R.R. Hermann C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8694-8700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Although the identification of Nod1 and Nod2 as sensors of muramyl peptides has provided an acceleration in this field of investigation, it also brought the question of how such microbial molecules could get access to the host cytosol, where Nod1 and Nod2 reside. Interestingly, research aiming at improving the biological activities of these muramyl peptides demonstrated early on that the addition of lipophilic groups to these molecules enhanced their activity considerably, suggesting that their internalization was likely a key factor in determining their efficiency (20.Fogler W.E. Fidler I.J. Int. J. Immunopharmacol. 1987; 9: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 21.Mehta K. Lopez-Berestein G. Hersh E.M. Juliano R.L. J. Reticuloendothel.

Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 161-167PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which muramyl peptides get access to the host cytosol remain unclear. This question is of fundamental importance for our understanding of Nod-dependent signaling and potentially holds broad therapeutic implications. Indeed, mutations in Nod1 and Nod2 have been associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in humans (24.Le Bourhis L. Benko S. Girardin S.E. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2007; 35: 1479-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In particular, Nod2 has been identified as the first susceptibility gene for Crohn's disease (25.Hugot J.P. Chamaillard M. Zouali H. Lesage S. Cézard J.P. Belaiche J. Almer S. Tysk C. O'Morain C.A. Gassull M. Binder V. Finkel Y. Cortot A. Modigliani R. Laurent-Puig P. Gower-Rousseau C. Macry J. Colombel J.F. Sahbatou M.

In this report, we used the HEK293T epithelial cell line to study the mechanism of internalization of Nod1 ligands. We demonstrated that these peptidoglycan-derived molecules enter cells by endocytosis, and that the composition of the Nod1-activating molecules dramatically affected their intrinsic uptake capacity. Our data also suggested that this internalization was mediated by clathrin-dependent endocytosis, because internalization of Nod1 ligands required dynamin and was independent from caveolae. Further, we showed that, within endosomes, the internalization of Nod1 ligands was critically dependent on pH, and was optimal at pH ranging from 5.5 to 6, which are characteristic of early endosomes. Accordingly, internalization of Nod1-activating molecules did not require the action of the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) complex. We also provide evidence that the Nod2 ligand MDP enters cells through a similar endocytic process. Our results also show that the internalization of Nod1 ligands is a process that is sterically gated, and likely requires the action of hydrolytic endosomal enzymes prior to transport into the cytosol, thus suggesting the existence of one or several specific transporters for Nod1 ligands in early endosomes. Using knockdown assays, we identified SLC15A4 as a putative transporter for Nod1 ligands in early endosomes. SLC15A4 expression was found to be significantly up-regulated in tissue biopsies from IBD patients, therefore highlighting a potential role for the modulation of peptidoglycan access to the cytosol in IBD etiology. Together, our results uncover the mechanism by which Nod ligands traffic into cells and get access to the cytosol where they are detected by Nod1 and Nod2. Our observations also highlight the previously unappreciated link between endosomal acidification/maturation and Nod-dependent signaling. Human embryonic kidney epithelial cell line HEK293T (American Type Culture Collection) was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were maintained in 95% air, 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Endotoxin-free fetal calf serum and phosphate-buffered saline were from Wisent (St-Bruno, Quebec). Fetal calf serum was used after heat inactivation at 56 °C for 30 min. All cell culture reagents and antibiotics were also from Wisent. Nod1 ligands, iE-DAP (γ-d-Glu-mesoDAP), Tri-DAP (l-Ala-d-Glu-mesoDAP), M-Tri-DAP (MurNAc-l-Ala-d-Glu-mesoDAP), C12-iE-DAP, were from InvivoGen. iE-DAP, Tri-DAP, and M-Tri-DAP were used at concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 μg/ml, whereas C12-iE-DAP was used from 0.01 to 1 μg/ml. Nod2 ligand, MDP was also from InvivoGen and used at a concentration of 10 μg/ml. The inhibitors of endocytosis were purchased from Sigma and used at the following concentrations: valinomycin (1–10 μm), bafilomycin A1 (10–50 nm), Dynasore monohydrate (80 μm), nocodazole (1 μg/ml), cytochalasin D (1 μg/ml), carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (1–10 μm), and methyl-β-cyclodextrin (2.5–10 mm). To examine the effect of extracellular pH on ligand uptake, isotonic buffer (IB) (50 mm HEPES, pH 7, 100 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 85 mm sucrose, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm ATP, and 0.1 mm GTP) was prepared with pH modified to 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, or 7, and ATP, dithiothreitol, and GTP were added freshly for each experiment. Cells were then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with the respective ligands in 500 μl of IB at varying pH. Subsequently, IB was removed and replaced with DMEM plus 5% fetal-calf serum for 5 h before performing luciferase measurements. Transfections were carried out using polyethylenimine (Polysciences Inc., Warrington, PA) in HEK293T according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were transfected overnight with 75 ng of NF-κB luciferase reporter plasmid (Igκ-luc, Invitrogen). The empty vector (pcDNA3.1, Invitrogen) was used to balance the transfected DNA concentration. The expression vector for human Nod2 (0.2 ng/well) was a kind gift from Dr. G. Nunez (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI). Following transfection, Nod1 or Nod2 ligands were added the next day for 6 h (unless specified) before performing luciferase measurements. For NF-κB activation assays in digitonin-permeabilized cells, HEK293T were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C with Nod1 ligands in isotonic digitonin buffer (DB) (500 μl) with or without 10 μg/ml digitonin (Sigma), and then placed in DMEM for 6 h, as previously described (15.Girardin S.E. Boneca I.G. Carneiro L.A. Antignac A. Jéhanno M. Viala J. Tedin K. Taha M.K. Labigne A. Zähringer U. Coyle A.J. DiStefano P.S. Bertin J. Sansonetti P.J. Philpott D.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1584-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar). As a control for the possible toxicity of the trafficking inhibitors used toward NF-κB activation, we systematically transfected overnight the Igκ-luci reporter vector together with 50 ng of expression vector encoding for Rip2 (from Dr. M. Thome, Université de Lausanne, Lausanne), the Nod1 adaptor protein acting downstream of the detection of peptidoglycan by Nod1. In all the experiments presented in this study, the doses of the drugs used had no effect on Rip2-mediated activation of NF-κB (data not shown). NF-κB-dependent luciferase assays were performed in duplicate, and data represent at least three independent experiments. Data show mean ± S.E. HEK293T cells were incubated in DMEM without fetal calf serum for 1 h prior to incubation in IB at pH 5.5 or 7 plus transferrin conjugated to Alexa Fluor 568 (10 μg/ml, Molecular Probes Inc.) for 1 h at 37 °C. Rab5-RFP expression vector was a kind gift from Dr. John Brumell (the Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto). SLC15A4-V5 was obtained from Dr. Knipp (The State University of New Jersey). Cells were co-transfected with either Rab5-RFP (500 ng) or SLC15A4-V5 (500 ng) or both overnight, and incubated in IB at pH 5.5 or 7 for 1 h at 37 °C the next day. Cells were then washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, fixed for 15 min at room temperature with paraformaldehyde (3.7% w/v in phosphate-buffered saline), permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min, stained with anti-V5 (anti-mouse-fluorescein isothiocyanate) for 1 h, and mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Coverslips were visualized on a Carl Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope with a 63× oil fluorescence objective. Total RNA samples from untreated cells were prepared according to the manufacturer's protocols (Qiagen). After genomic DNA elimination with RNase-free DNase, the complementary DNA was generated from 1 μg of RNA using a mixture of oligo(dT) and random primers and Omniscript Reverse Transcriptase (Qiagen). PCR was performed with Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) using the following primers: 5′-TTGCTTCTGGTCGTCTGTG-3′ and 5′-GCCCCTGACATGAAATATGG-3′ for SLC15A1, 5′-GCCCTGTCTTGAAGCATTTT-3′ and 5′-AGAGTCTCTGGGGCCTTGTT-3′ for SLC15A2, 5′-GCTTAAGCTCGCTCTCCAAA-3′ and 5′-GCAAGATCTTCACCAGCAC-3′ for SLC15A3, and 5′-AGCGATCCTGTCGTTAGGTG-3′ and 5′-AGGAGGCTTGGTGATGAAAA-3′ for SLC15A4. The sequences of the siRNA specifically targeting SLC15A4 gene were purchased from Ambion (Silencer Pre-designed siRNA) siRNA ID # S42440 and siRNA ID #S42441 or designed through siRNA Wizard v3.0 (InvivoGen). The sequences were the following: 5′-CGGCTGCTATTTGAACTAT-3′ for #B, 5′-GCAGACAACATATGTTTTA-3′ for #A, 5′-GAGTCTTTCAGCAATCTTCTA-3′ for #C, 5′-GATTCATGTAAGATGTCTCAT-3′ for #D, 5′-GTGGAGAGCGCCAGAGTAA-3′ for #E, 5′-GATTCATGTAAGATGTCTCAT-3′ for #F, and 5′-CGGCTGCTATTTGAACTAT-3′ for scrambled. Two different vectors were used to generate shRNA against SLC15A4; pLKO.1 vector (Addgene, Cambridge, MA) for lentiviral knockdown system, and psiRNA-h7SK-GFPzeo transient knockdown of SLC15A4 expression. For both vectors, positive clones were identified by restriction digestion and confirmed by sequencing. The sense and antisense oligonucleotides were resuspended in water at 20 μm and annealed by incubating at 95 °C for 4 min, 70 °C for 10 min, then decreasing the temperature to room temperature slowly (0.1 °C/min). The resulting lentiviral shRNA vector was confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion with Agel/EcoRI. The constructed vector was also confirmed by DNA sequencing with pLKO.1 sequencing primer (5′-CAAGGCTGTTAGAGAGATAATTGGA-3′). Packaging and purification of the lentivirus were performed according to classic procedures. Briefly, HEK293T cells were seeded 1.5 × 106 in a 10-cm culture dish, in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum without antibiotics. The following day, cells were co-transfected with the lentiviral vector (1 μg), and the lentiviral packaging/envelope vectors psPAX2 (750 ng) and pMD2.G (250 ng). Viruses were collected from the culture supernatant 48 h post-transfection and spun at 1250 rpm for 5 min, and the media were passed through a 0.45-μm filter. Cells were seeded in either 6-well plates or 24-well plates, and then incubated with lentivirus for 3 days. Polybrene (10 μg/ml) was added to increase the efficiency of lentiviral transduction. Following transduction, cells were co-transfected with NF-κB luciferase constructs, and luciferase assays were performed as above. HEK293T cells were centrifuged, and the pellet was lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma P8340)). Total cell lysates were boiled for 10 min and subsequently subjected to SDS-PAGE. Western blot was performed according to a standard protocol, using a rabbit polyclonal anti-SLC15A4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, dilution 1:500), followed by incubation with a secondary anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase antibody (Thermo Scientific, 1:10,000) and an enhanced Chemiluminescence Kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Mouse monoclonal anti-tubulin (Sigma, T9026, 1:10,000) was used as loading control. The analysis of SLC15A4 expression in 49 CD patients and 53 UC patients was performed in the context of a larger study, which was reported elsewhere (36.Wojtal K.A. Eloranta J.J. Hruz P. Gutmann H. Drewe J. Beglinger C. Fried M. Kullak-Ublick G.A. Vavricka S.R. Drug Metab. Dispos.2009Google Scholar). HEK293T cells transfected overnight with an expression vector encoding for luciferase under the control of an NF-κB-responsive promoter (Igκ-luci) were stimulated with increasing concentrations of the Nod1 ligands iE-DAP, Tri-DAP, or M-Tri-DAP for 6 h. iE-DAP represents the minimal peptide activating Nod1, whereas Tri-DAP is the minimal naturally occurring Nod1 ligand, and M-Tri-DAP is the minimal muramyl peptide stimulating Nod1 (11.Girardin S.E. Travassos L.H. Hervé M. Blanot D. Boneca I.G. Philpott D.J. Sansonetti P.J. Mengin-Lecreulx D. J. Biol.

Although Tri-DAP and M-Tri-DAP activated cells comparably, iE-DAP appeared to be a very poor agonist, even at the highest dose tested (10 μg/ml) (Fig. 1B). We next stimulated cells for 1–6 h with 10 μg/ml of Tri-DAP or M-Tri-DAP, and observed that these Nod1 ligands required at least 3–4 h of stimulation to induce measurable activation of the NF-κB reporter gene (Fig. 1C). We and others have previously demonstrated that iE-DAP is able to trigger Nod1-dependent NF-κB activation in a setting where the ligands were added overnight together with a liposomal transfection reagent (11.Girardin S.E. Travassos L.H. Hervé M. Blanot D. Boneca I.G. Philpott D.J. Sansonetti P.J. Mengin-Lecreulx D. J. Biol.

Therefore, the results above likely reflect the fact that iE-DAP, contrary to Tri-DAP or M-Tri-DAP, is inefficiently internalized by HEK293T cells. To study this question further, we used a derivative iE-DAP that contains a lauroyl (C12) group attached to the glutamic residue of iE-DAP (see Fig. 1A). The rationale for such a modification is that the fatty acids may form micelle-like structures and display enhanced internalization. We observed that the addition of the fatty acid moiety to iE-DAP enhanced >100-fold the capacity of the Nod1 ligand to trigger NF-κB (Fig. 1D). This suggests that iE-DAP-activated cells poorly as a result of defective trafficking, rather than because of an intrinsic inefficiency to stimulate Nod1. Next, we questioned if the Nod1 ligands actually needed to get access to the host cytosol to trigger cellular responses, or if trafficking and targeting to a specific subcellular compartment were the only requirement for Nod1-dependent activation. To answer this question, we pulsed HEK293T cells with iE-DAP, Tri-DAP, or M-Tri-DAP for 10 min in the presence of digitonin, a membrane-permeabilizing toxin, then replaced back the cell culture medium to neutralize the action of digitonin, and lysed cells 6 h post-stimulation. Interestingly, in this experimental setting, all Nod1 ligands potently stimulated cells (Fig. 1E), therefore showing that presentation to the host cytosol is the limiting factor for their activating capacities. It must be noted, however, that, in this context, iE-DAP remained a weaker agonist than Tri-DAP or M-Tri-DAP (Fig. 1E), which correlates well with our previous observations using a different experimental setting (11.Girardin S.E. Travassos L.H. Hervé M. Blanot D. Boneca I.G. Philpott D.J. Sansonetti P.J. Mengin-Lecreulx D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41702-41708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar), and may reflect a difference in the intrinsic capacity of this dipeptide to trigger Nod1, as compared with the naturally occurring tripeptide forms. Together, these results show that epithelial cells have the capacity to internalize Nod1 ligands and that these molecules display different trafficking abilities and demonstrate that these agonists must reach the host cytosol to trigger Nod1-dependent responses. We next investigated the cellular pathways responsible for the internalization of Nod1 ligands into HEK293T cells. Nocodazole and cytochalasin D, two drugs that block macropinocytosis by disrupting microtubules and actin cytoskeleton, respectively, did not affect the capacity of Tri-DAP or M-Tri-DAP to stimulate cells (Fig. 2A). In contrast, Dynasore, a highly specific inhibitor of dynamin (27.Macia E. Ehrlich M. Massol R. Boucrot E. Brunner C. Kirchhausen T. Dev. Cell. 2006; 10: 839-850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1511) Google Scholar), potently blocked Tri-DAP- and M-Tri-DAP-dependent activation of NF-κB (Fig. 2A). We next took advantage of the fact that Dynasore blocks dynamin in seconds or minutes (27.Macia E. Ehrlich M. Massol R. Boucrot E. Brunner C. Kirchhausen T. Dev. Cell. 2006; 10"
https://openalex.org/W2145883703,"Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) undergo self-renewal division and support spermatogenesis. Although several cytokines coordinate to drive SSC self-renewal, little is known about the mechanisms underlying this process. We investigated the molecular mechanism by reconstructing SSC self-renewal in vitro without exogenous cytokines. Activation of Ras or overexpression of cyclins D2 and E1, both of which were induced by Ras, enabled long-term self-renewal of cultured spermatogonia. SSCs with activated Ras responded properly to differentiation signals and underwent spermatogenesis, whereas differentiation was abrogated in cyclin transfectants after spermatogonial transplantation. Both Ras- and cyclin-transfected cells produced seminomatous tumors, suggesting that excessive self-renewing stimulus induces oncogenic transformation. In contrast, cells that overexpressed cyclin D1 or D3 failed to make germ cell colonies after transplantation, which indicated that cyclin expression pattern is an important determinant to long-term SSC recolonization. Thus, the Ras-cyclin D2 pathway regulates the balance between tissue maintenance and tumorigenesis in the SSC population."
https://openalex.org/W2036929002,"XX female mammals undergo transcriptional silencing of most genes on one of their two X chromosomes to equalize X-linked gene dosage with XY males in a process referred to as X-chromosome inactivation (XCI). XCI is an example of epigenetic regulation. Once enacted in individual cells of the early female embryo, XCI is stably transmitted such that most descendant cells maintain silencing of that X chromosome. In eutherian mammals, XCI is thought to be triggered by the expression of the non-coding Xist RNA from the future inactive X chromosome (Xi); Xist RNA in turn is proposed to recruit protein complexes that bring about heterochromatinization of the Xi. Here we test whether imprinted XCI, which results in preferential inactivation of the paternal X chromosome (Xp), occurs in mouse embryos inheriting an Xp lacking Xist. We find that silencing of Xp-linked genes can initiate in the absence of paternal Xist; Xist is, however, required to stabilize silencing along the Xp. Xp-linked gene silencing associated with mouse imprinted XCI, therefore, can initiate in the embryo independently of Xist RNA."

By contrast, in the salvage pathway, lipoate-protein ligase (LplA) attaches free lipoic acid to proteins in a two-step reaction.

Lett. 2001; 199: 131-136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Sulo P. Martin N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17634-17639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that yeast either cannot use exogenously supplied lipoic acid or there is no yeast equivalent of the E. coli LplA-driven salvage pathway.Here we report the involvement of two additional enzymes in protein lipoylation in yeast mitochondria. The first, Lip3, is a lipoate-protein ligase homolog and is required with Lip2 and Lip5 for lipoylation of the E2 subunits of PDH (Lat1) and α-KDH (Kgd2). The second enzyme, Gcv3, the H protein of the GC enzyme, is absolutely required for lipoylation of all proteins in yeast.DiscussionHere we show that four enzymes are involved in protein lipoylation in yeast mitochondria; one is a target of lipoic acid modification itself. Lip2 and Lip5, the homologs of E. coli LipB and LipA, are required for lipoylation of three lipoic acid-modified proteins as follows: Lat1, Kgd2, and Gcv3. Lip3, the homolog of lipoate-protein ligase (LplA) in E. coli, is required for lipoylation of two of the three lipoate-modified proteins, Lat1 and Kgd2. The invariant Lys-249 residue in the active site of Lip3 is essential for this function. Finally, lipoylated Gcv3 is also required for lipoylation of Lat1 and Kgd2. We conclude that protein lipoylation in yeast is different from E. coli in three ways as follows: 1) Lip2 plus Lip5 are not sufficient to lipoylate all target proteins; 2) Lip3 is not sufficient to lipoylate any target protein alone; and 3) Gcv3, a target of lipoylation, is required for lipoylation.Lip2, Lip5, Lip3, and Gcv3 were all first identified in studies of other cellular processes (19.Marvin M.E. Williams P.H. Cashmore A.M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2001; 199: 131-136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Sulo P. Martin N.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 4444-4450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Our data showing that all four proteins are required for protein lipoylation, and thus for respiratory competence, lead us to suggest a model in which the four proteins function in a lipoylation complex (Fig. 6). As deletion of LPD1, which codes for the dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase subunit common to all three lipoic acid-dependent enzyme complexes, causes a reduction in protein lipoylation (Fig. 5A), some molecules of Lpd1 may function also in the lipoylation complex. An alternative hypothesis is that loss of Lpd1 may lead to destabilization of the complexes. The model proposes that some molecules of Gcv3 function in the glycine cleavage enzyme, whereas others participate in the lipoylation complex. In independent support of the complex model, Lip2 purified with Gcv3 in a global tandem affinity purification tag study for protein interactions (42.Krogan N.J. Cagney G. Yu H. Zhong G. Guo X. Ignatchenko A. Li J. Pu S. Datta N. Tikuisis A.P. Punna T. Peregrín-Alvarez J.M. Shales M. Zhang X. Davey M. Robinson M.D. Paccanaro A. Bray J.E. Sheung A. Beattie B. Richards D.P. Canadien V.

Nature. 2006; 440: 637-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (2317) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the enzymes may function separately as part of one lipoylation pathway in which Lip2 and Lip3 are both required for the transfer of lipoic acid, and lipoylated Gcv3 is required, in some novel way, for the lipoylation of Lat1 and Kgd2.Regardless of the existence of a complex, the organization of the yeast enzymes in a single pathway differs from the two alternative lipoylation pathways in E. coli. In E. coli, attachment of lipoic acid to apoproteins can be catalyzed by one of two different enzymes, LipB or LplA. LipB transfers the lipoyl (or octanoyl) group endogenously synthesized on ACP to the acceptor lysine residue of target apoproteins (11.Jordan S.W. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 1582-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 12.Nesbitt N.M. Baleanu-Gogonea C. Cicchillo R.M. Goodson K. Iwig D.F. Broadwater J.A. Haas J.A. Fox B.G. Booker S.J. Protein Expr. Purif. 2005; 39: 269-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Alternatively, LplA catalyzes the attachment of exogenously supplied lipoic acid in a two-step reaction. ATP and lipoic acid are first joined in formation of a lipoyl-AMP intermediate, and then the lipoyl group is transferred to the conserved lysine residue within the acceptor lipoyl domain of the targets. Although E. coli LplA can independently lipoylate target proteins using lipoic acid from the medium, lipoylation of Lat1 and Kgd2 in yeast requires Lip2, Lip5, and Gcv3 in addition to the homolog of LplA, Lip3. Hence, the role of yeast Lip3 is not the same as that of E. coli LplA.Our most detailed view of the function of LplA-like enzymes comes from analyses of crystal structures of bacterial, archaeal, and bovine enzymes (36.Fujiwara K.

Similar to E. coli LplA, Ta LplA catalyzes both the activation and transfer of lipoic acid in vivo, however, the protein expressed for crystallization is homologous to only the N-terminal domain of E. coli LplA. This form of the enzyme is inactive and needs the noncovalent association of the product of an adjacent gene that has homology to the E. coli C-terminal domain (43.McManus E. Luisi B.F. Perham R.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 356: 625-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). 4Christensen, Q. H., and Cronan, J. E. (2009) J. Biol. Chem. 284, 21317–21326 However, lipoyl-AMP binds to the crystallized Ta LplA domain at a site structurally equivalent to that of the bovine enzyme (see below) (37.Fujiwara K. Hosaka H. Matsuda M. Okamura-Ikeda K. Motokawa Y. Suzuki M. Nakagawa A. Taniguchi H. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 371: 222-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Lipoyl-AMP adopts a U-shaped structure within the bifurcated binding pocket. The lipoyl group of the intermediate is buried within a hydrophobic channel, and the AMP moiety forms hydrogen bonds with residues in the other tunnel of the two-lobed pocket. The bent arrangement orients the carbon atom subject to nucleophilic attack at the surface of Ta LplA. The carbonyl oxygen atom of the lipoyl group interacts with Lys-145 (the invariant lysine residue analogous to Lys-133 in E. coli and Lys-249 in S. cerevisiae) in the binding pocket. This interaction likely aids nucleophilic attack of the exposed carbon atom of lipoyl-AMP by the ϵ-amino group of the acceptor lysine, resulting in an amide linkage.Two separate enzymes are required in cows for catalysis of the two reactions carried out by lipoate-protein ligases in prokaryotes. Lipoate-activating enzyme, which is a medium-chain acyl-CoA synthetase, activates lipoic acid with GTP (44.Fujiwara K. Takeuchi S. Okamura-Ikeda K. Motokawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28819-28823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), whereas lipoyltransferase catalyzes the transfer of the lipoyl group to the acceptor lysine residue of target proteins (45.Fujiwara K. Okamura-Ikeda K. Motokawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16605-16609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The crystal structure of bovine lipoyltransferase, similar to E. coli LplA, contains both N-terminal and C-terminal domains (37.Fujiwara K. Hosaka H. Matsuda M. Okamura-Ikeda K. Motokawa Y. Suzuki M. Nakagawa A. Taniguchi H. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 371: 222-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the N-terminal domain of the recombinant bovine protein produced in E. coli had lipoyl-AMP bound in the active site, indicating a high affinity of bovine lipoyltransferase for lipoyl-AMP. The invariant lysine residue in bovine lipoyltransferase (Lys-135) forms similar bonds with lipoyl-AMP as does Lys-145 of Ta LplA and, most likely, Lys-133 of E. coli LplA. The gene encoding the human lipoyltransferase has been isolated (16.Fujiwara K. Suzuki M. Okumachi Y. Okamura-Ikeda K. Fujiwara T. Takahashi E. Motokawa Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 761-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and amino acid sequence alignment reveals regions of significant similarity with other LplA-like enzymes and includes the invariant lysine residue (Fig. 1). It seems likely that the mammalian lipoyltransferase transfers lipoic acid obtained from the diet or from intestinal bacteria to target proteins, but recent reports of a soluble mitochondrial ACP (46.Cronan J.E. Fearnley I.M. Walker J.E. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 4892-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and of lipoic acid synthase (a Lip5-like enzyme) (47.Morikawa T. Yasuno R. Wada H. FEBS Lett. 2001; 498: 16-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 48.Yi X. Maeda N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 8387-8392Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) indicate the existence of a de novo lipoic acid biosynthetic pathway, which may be important for development or for certain tissues.A third major difference between lipoylation in yeast and that in E. coli is the requirement for Gcv3, the lipoylated subunit of the GC complex. How is Gcv3, a target of lipoylation, required for lipoylation? Because lipoylated Gcv3 is required for lipoylation of Lat1 and Kgd2, Gcv3 may act as a sensor for the metabolic state of the cell. When acetyl-CoA is abundant, the lipoylation complex model proposes that octanoic acid produced by the FAS II pathway is available for lipoylation of Gcv3 by Lip2 and Lip5. Lipoylated Gcv3 in turn may be required either for assembly of the active lipoylation complex or for a conformational change in one or more enzymes in the complex. The assembled, active complex then lipoylates Lat1 and Kgd2, leading to cellular respiration. Under conditions of low availability of acetyl-CoA, low levels of lipoylated Gcv3 may act as a switch to turn off PDH and α-KDH activities by blocking lipoylation of Lat1 and Kgd2. Because PDH requires lipoic acid for the production of acetyl-CoA that is fed into the FAS II pathway, lower levels of octanoic acid and therefore lipoic acid are produced. However, Kgd2 and Gcv3 are lipoylated in the lat1Δ strain, indicating that, when the cells are grown in rich glucose medium, acetyl-CoA from another source, such as amino acid breakdown, β-oxidation of fatty acids, or the pyruvate dehydrogenase bypass pathway, can be fed into the FAS II pathway. Inactive PDH and α-KDH lead to a decrease in or loss of cellular respiration, and mitochondrial gene expression may also be affected by inhibition of tRNA processing (18.Schonauer M.S. Kastaniotis A.J. Hiltunen J.K. Dieckmann C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 6646-6657Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).Together, our results suggest that proteins are lipoylated in yeast mitochondria via one pathway or lipoylation complex, unlike in E. coli, which has two redundant lipoylation pathways. Future investigations will reveal whether protein lipoylation in mammalian mitochondria is similar to that in yeast. Of particular interest will be discovering whether the eukaryotic pathway/complex is regulated in response to the availability of acetyl-CoA, and then in turn serves to regulate mitochondrial gene expression via tRNA processing (18.Schonauer M.S. Kastaniotis A.J. Hiltunen J.K. Dieckmann C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 6646-6657Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). One piece of evidence reported by Autio et al. (49.Autio K.J. Kastaniotis A.J. Pospiech H. Miinalainen I.J. Schonauer M.S. Dieckmann C.L. Hiltunen J.K. FASEB J. 2008; 22: 569-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) suggests that mitochondrial gene expression may be regulated by the availability of acetyl-CoA in human cells. A bicistronic cDNA was found to encode an FAS II enzyme and an RNase P protein subunit. This gene arrangement has been conserved throughout vertebrate evolution from fish to humans. The link between mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis and RNA processing in yeast (18.Schonauer M.S. Kastaniotis A.J. Hiltunen J.K. Dieckmann C.L. Mol. Cell.

FASEB J. 2008; 22: 569-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) along with the finding that protein lipoylation in yeast occurs via one pathway/complex suggest that eukaryotic mitochondrial function is highly regulated in response to cellular metabolism. Several oxidative decarboxylation reactions are carried out in prokaryotes and eukaryotes by multienzyme complexes. The function of these complexes requires the action of a sulfur-containing cofactor, lipoic acid (6,8-thioctic acid) (1.Perham R.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 961-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 2.Herbert A.A. Guest J.R. Arch. Microbiol. 1975; 106: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).

The lipoyl moiety serves as a swinging arm that shuttles reaction intermediates between active sites within the complexes (1.Perham R.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 961-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Despite the well characterized function of lipoic acid as a prosthetic group, the mechanisms of its synthesis and attachment to proteins are the subject of ongoing investigations (4.Cronan J.E.

Biol. 2003; 10: 1293-1302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). By contrast, in the salvage pathway, lipoate-protein ligase (LplA) attaches free lipoic acid to proteins in a two-step reaction. Lipoic acid, which can be scavenged from the medium, is first activated to lipoyl-AMP and then the lipoyl group is transferred to the proteins (14.Morris T.W. Reed K.E. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16091-16100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lipoic acid synthesis and attachment to target proteins are less well understood in eukaryotes. Homologs of the E. coli enzymes have been found in fungi, plants, protists, and mammals, but many mechanistic details are unclear (15.Kang S.G. Jeong H.K. Lee E. Natarajan S.

https://openalex.org/W2091781796,"Lysine acetyltransferases (KATs), p300 (KAT3B), and its close homologue CREB-binding protein (KAT3A) are probably the most widely studied KATs with well documented roles in various cellular processes. Hence, the dysfunction of p300 may result in the dysregulation of gene expression leading to the manifestation of many disorders. The acetyltransferase activity of p300/CREB-binding protein is therefore considered as a target for new generation therapeutics. We describe here a natural compound, plumbagin (RTK1), isolated from Plumbago rosea root extract, that inhibits histone acetyltransferase activity potently in vivo. Interestingly, RTK1 specifically inhibits the p300-mediated acetylation of p53 but not the acetylation by another acetyltransferase, p300/CREB-binding protein -associated factor, PCAF, in vivo. RTK1 inhibits p300 histone acetyltransferase activity in a noncompetitive manner. Docking studies and site-directed mutagenesis of the p300 histone acetyltransferase domain suggest that a single hydroxyl group of RTK1 makes a hydrogen bond with the lysine 1358 residue of this domain. In agreement with this, we found that indeed the hydroxyl group-substituted plumbagin derivatives lost the acetyltransferase inhibitory activity. This study describes for the first time the chemical entity (hydroxyl group) required for the inhibition of acetyltransferase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2051573801,"Transgenic expression of human amyloid beta (A beta) peptide in body wall muscle cells of Caenorhabditis elegans has been used to better understand aspects of Alzheimer disease (AD). In human aging and AD, A beta undergoes post-translational changes including covalent modifications, truncations, and oligomerization. Amino truncated A beta is increasingly recognized as potentially contributing to AD pathogenesis. Here we describe surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry mass spectrometry of A beta peptide in established transgenic C. elegans lines. Surprisingly, the A beta being expressed is not full-length 1-42 (amino acids) as expected but rather a 3-42 truncation product. In vitro analysis demonstrates that A beta(3-42) self-aggregates like A beta(1-42), but more rapidly, and forms fibrillar structures. Similarly, A beta(3-42) is also the more potent initiator of A beta(1-40) aggregation. Seeded aggregation via A beta(3-42) is further enhanced via co-incubation with the transition metal Cu(II). Although unexpected, the C. elegans model of A beta expression can now be co-opted to study the proteotoxic effects and processing of A beta(3-42)."

Fibulin-4 is widely expressed from early embryogenesis and is necessary for normal vascular, lung, and skin development, since mice that lack fibulin-4 do not form elastic fibers and die perinatally (5.McLaughlin P.J.

Initial pericellular microassembly of tropoelastin, which may involve the 67-kDa elastin-binding protein receptor, generates elastin globules that are stabilized by desmosine cross-links catalyzed mainly by lysyl oxidase (LOX) but also by LOXL1 (LOX-like 1). These globules are deposited on a fibrillin microfibril template, where they coalesce and undergo further cross-linking to form the elastin core of mature fibers. The ability of fibulin-4 and -5 to bind tropoelastin and fibrillin-1, the major structural component of microfibrils, supports a model in which these fibulins direct elastin deposition on microfibrils (4.Kobayashi N.

This model does not delineate the unique molecular contributions of fibulin-4 and -5 to elastic fiber formation, but some molecular differences have emerged. Tropoelastin was bound more strongly by fibulin-5 than by fibulin-4, whereas fibulin-5 was at the microfibril-elastin interface, but perichondrial fibulin-4 localized mainly to microfibrils (4.Kobayashi N.

They had dramatically reduced (94%) desmosine cross-links despite no change in elastin or LOX expression levels, and electron-dense rodlike structures were prominent within elastin aggregates. Morphologically similar structures seen after chemically inhibiting LOX were previously identified as glycosaminoglycans, which can bind charged free ϵ-amino groups on lysines in tropoelastin (26.Fornieri C.

However, fibulin-4+/− mice showed ∼20% increase in desmosine (5.McLaughlin P.J. Chen Q. Horiguchi M. Starcher B.C. Stanton J.B. Broekelmann T.J. Marmorstein A.D. McKay B. Mecham R. Nakamura T.

In contrast, LOXL1-null mice are viable but have reduced desmosine (29.Liu X. Zhao Y. Gao J. Pawlyk B. Starcher B. Spencer J.A. Yanagisawa H. Zuo J. Li T. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 178-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar), whereas fibulin-5 null mice have a 16% reduction in desmosine cross-links and survive well into adulthood (7.Yanagisawa H.

Detection of the LOXL1 pro-domain in fibulin-5 null mice skin but not wild-type skin implicates fibulin-5 in activation of LOXL1 (30.Choi J. Bergdahl A. Zheng Q. Starcher B. Yanagisawa H. Davis E.C.

However, the fibulin-null mice show that the fibrillin-1 interaction with tropoelastin is insufficient to support elastic fiber formation in vivo. Fibulin-5 has been reported to facilitate tropoelastin binding to the N-terminal half of fibrillin-1 (21.El-Hallous E. Sasaki T. Hubmacher D. Getie M. Tiedemann K. Brinckmann J. Bätge B. Davis E.C. Reinhardt D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 8935-8946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). A study of elastin polypeptide self-assembly through coacervation and maturation phases showed that, although the N-terminal half of fibrillin-1 increased maturation velocity and droplet clustering, fibulin-4 and -5 both slowed maturation and limited globule growth (35.Cirulis J.T.

These studies imply that fibulins and fibrillin-1 act together to regulate elastin accretion on microfibrils. To gain further insights into the contributions of fibulin-4 and -5 to elastic fiber formation, we have delineated how they interact with tropoelastin, LOX, and fibrillin-1. Novel findings are that fibulin-4 directly binds LOX, and this interaction enhances fibulin-4 binding to tropoelastin, thus forming a ternary complex that may be critical for elastin cross-linking. Fibulin-5 can concurrently bind fibulin-4 and tropoelastin, but the interaction of both fibulins with fibrillin-1 strongly inhibits their binding to tropoelastin. These interactions indicate the molecular basis of how fibulins act as chaperones for deposition of elastin onto microfibrils. Our study thus provides a molecular account of the differential roles of fibulins-4 and -5 in elastic fiber formation. All human elastic fiber proteins were expressed with an N-terminal His6 tag, using the mammalian expression vector pCEP-His and 293-EBNA cells, and purified using nickel affinity chromatography as described (22.Freeman L.J.

Purified F4 monomers in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 500 mm NaCl (TBS) were adsorbed onto glow-discharged carbon-coated 400-mesh copper grids, negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate, and analyzed by single particle averaging, as described (Fig. 2) (37.Baldock C.

Briefly, samples were observed at ×52,000 magnification using an FEI Tecnai 12 transmission electron microscope operating at 120 kV with a LaB6 filament, and images were recorded by a CCD camera (TVIPS Tem Cam, 2048 × 2048 resolution) using low dose (<10e−/Å2) at defocus values of 2 μm. The pixel size was 1.9 Å. Images were analyzed using electron microscopy analysis (EMAN) (44.Ludtke S.J. Baldwin P.R. Chiu W. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 82-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (2110) Google Scholar) for all data processing. The data set contained 3538 particles, which were aligned and classified by reference-free methods. A preliminary three-dimensional structure was calculated by averaging classes that represented distinct views of the sample. Fourier common lines were applied to determine the relative orientation of these classes. The preliminary structure was subsequently refined by iterative (eight times) projection matching. Each refinement was examined by the convergence of the Fourier shell correlation coefficient. Final resolution of the F4 reconstruction was ∼20 Å using the Fourier shell correlation = 0.5 criterion. For kinetic binding studies by surface plasmon resonance, a BIAcore biosensor was used (BIAcore 3000; GE Healthcare). Tropoelastin or LOX was immobilized onto CM5 sensor chips by amine coupling using 1-ethyl-3(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride, N-hydroxysuccinimide, and ethanolamine-HCl, as described (33.Rock M.J.

LOX, fibulin-4, or fibulin-5 was injected at concentration ranges of 2–10 μg/ml for F4 or 0.4–10 μg/ml for F5 or LOX for 3–5 min at a flow rate of 30 μl/min. Curves were fitted using a 1:1 Langmuir association/dissociation model (BIAevaluation 4.1; GE Healthcare). This model was found to fit the tropoelastin-fibulin-5 and LOX-fibulin-4 data, with low χ2 values. χ2 values are a standard statistical measure of the closeness of fit (mean square of the signal noise). Each binding interaction was performed at least twice, with one concentration in duplicate each time. Some BIAcore experiments investigated potential inhibitory effects of a given elastic fiber protein on binding of a second protein to immobilized tropoelastin or LOX. Kinetic analysis was performed using ligand protein (F5 at 100 nm; F4 at 200 nm; LOX at 200 nm) preincubated with a 0.01 nm to 3 μm concentration of the potential inhibitor protein or with a non-binding control fibrillin-1 fragment PF12, in HBS+Ca, as described (38.Cain S.A.

Inhibition curves were plotted using the response value of each normalized curve at the end of the association period. Because fibrillin-1 and the two fibulins when immobilized to BIAcore CM5 chips do not interact sufficiently with other proteins and to investigate further the interactions between LOX and tropoelastin and between fibrillin-1 and LOX, solid phase assays were utilized, as described (22.Freeman L.J.

The TEL-AML1 gene fusion, the hallmark translocation in Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia and the first hit, occurs years before the clinical disease, most often in utero. We have generated mice in which TEL-AML1 expression is driven from the endogenous promoter and can be targeted to specific populations. TEL-AML1 renders mice prone to malignancy after chemical mutagenesis when expressed in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), but not in early lymphoid progenitors. We reveal that TEL-AML1 markedly increases the number of HSCs and predominantly maintains them in the quiescent (G(0)) stage of the cell cycle. TEL-AML1(+) HSCs retain self-renewal properties and contribute to hematopoiesis, but fail to out-compete normal HSCs. Our work shows that stem cells are susceptible to subversion by weak oncogenes that can subtly alter their molecular program to provide a latent reservoir for the accumulation of further mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2093078995,"ABC50 is an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) protein, which, unlike most ABC proteins, does not possess membrane-spanning domains. ABC50 interacts with eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2), which plays a key role in translation initiation and its control. ABC50 binds to ribosomes, and this interaction requires both the N-terminal domain and at least one ABC domain. Knockdown of ABC50 by RNA interference impaired translation of both cap-dependent and -independent reporters, consistent with a positive role for ABC50 in the function of eIF2, which is required for both types of translation initiation. Mutation of the Walker box A or B motifs in both ABC regions of ABC50 yielded a mutant protein that exerted a dominant-interfering phenotype with respect to protein synthesis and translation initiation. Importantly, although dominant-interfering mutants of ABC50 impaired cap-dependent translation, translation driven by certain internal ribosome entry segments was not inhibited. ABC50 is located in the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm but not in the nucleolus. Thus, ABC50 is not likely to be directly involved in early ribosomal biogenesis, unlike some other ABC proteins. Taken together, the present data show that ABC50 plays a key role in translation initiation and has functions that are distinct from those of other non-membrane ABC proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2055989227,"Activation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1) has been shown to mediate cell death induced by genotoxic stimuli. The role of poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG), the enzyme responsible for polymer degradation, has been largely unexplored in the regulation of cell death. Using lentiviral gene silencing we generated A549 lung adenocarcinoma cell lines with stably suppressed PARG and PARP1 expression (shPARG and shPARP1 cell lines, respectively) and determined parameters of apoptotic and necrotic cell death following hydrogen peroxide exposure. shPARG cells accumulated large amounts of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated proteins and exhibited reduced PARP activation. Hydrogen peroxide-induced cell death is regulated by PARG in a dual fashion. Whereas the shPARG cell line (similarly to shPARP1 cells) was resistant to the necrotic effect of high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide, these cells exhibited stronger apoptotic response. Both shPARP1 and especially shPARG cells displayed a delayed repair of DNA breaks and exhibited reduced clonogenic survival following hydrogen peroxide treatment. Translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor could not be observed, but cells could be saved by methyl pyruvate and α-ketoglutarate, indicating that energy failure may mediate cytotoxicity in our model. These data indicate that PARG is a survival factor at mild oxidative damage but contributes to the apoptosis-necrosis switch in severely damaged cells.—Erdélyi, K., Bai, P., Kovács, I., Szabó, E., Mocsar, G., Kakuk, A., Szabó, C., Gergely, P., Virag, L.

Until now, however, seismic images of molten sills within the lower crust have been elusive. Canales et al. report deep crustal seismic reflections off the southern Juan de Fuca Ridge, which they interpret as originating from a molten sill currently forming within the lower oceanic crust. The style of accretion of the lower oceanic crust at mid-ocean ridges is disputed, with some models proposing that the lower oceanic crust is accreted from melt sills intruded at multiple levels within the lower crust. However, seismic images of such sills have been elusive; here, deep crustal seismic reflections off the southern Juan de Fuca ridge are interpreted as originating from a molten sill presently forming within the lower oceanic crust. The oceanic crust extends over two-thirds of the Earth’s solid surface, and is generated along mid-ocean ridges from melts derived from the upwelling mantle1. The upper and middle crust are constructed by dyking and sea-floor eruptions originating from magma accumulated in mid-crustal lenses at the spreading axis2,3,4,5,6, but the style of accretion of the lower oceanic crust is actively debated7. Models based on geological and petrological data from ophiolites propose that the lower oceanic crust is accreted from melt sills intruded at multiple levels between the Moho transition zone (MTZ) and the mid-crustal lens8,9,10,11, consistent with geophysical studies that suggest the presence of melt within the lower crust12,13,14,15,16. However, seismic images of molten sills within the lower crust have been elusive. Until now, only seismic reflections from mid-crustal melt lenses2,17,18 and sills within the MTZ have been described19, suggesting that melt is efficiently transported through the lower crust. Here we report deep crustal seismic reflections off the southern Juan de Fuca ridge that we interpret as originating from a molten sill at present accreting the lower oceanic crust. The sill sits 5–6 km beneath the sea floor and 850–900 m above the MTZ, and is located 1.4–3.2 km off the spreading axis. Our results provide evidence for the existence of low-permeability barriers to melt migration within the lower section of modern oceanic crust forming at intermediate-to-fast spreading rates, as inferred from ophiolite studies9,10."
https://openalex.org/W1987940021,"The transplantation of germ cells into adult recipient gonads is a tool with wide applications in animal breeding and conservation of valuable and/or endangered species; it also provides a means for basic studies involving germ cell (GC) proliferation and differentiation. Here we describe the establishment of a working model for xenogeneic germ cell transplantation (GCT) in sexually competent fish. Spermatogonial cells isolated from juveniles of one species, the pejerrey Odontesthes bonariensis (Atherinopsidae), were surgically transplanted into the gonads of sexually mature Patagonian pejerrey O. hatcheri, which have been partially depleted of endogenous GCs by a combination of Busulfan (40 mg/kg) and high water temperature (25°C) treatments. The observation of the donor cells' behavior showed that transplanted spermatogonial cells were able to recolonize the recipients' gonads and resume spermatogenesis within 6 months from the GCT. The presence of donor-derived gametes was confirmed by PCR in 20% of the surrogate O. hatcheri fathers at 6 months and crosses with O. bonariensis mothers produced hybrids and pure O. bonariensis, with donor-derived germline transmission rates of 1.2–13.3%. These findings indicate that transplantation of spermatogonial cells into sexually competent fish can shorten considerably the production time of donor-derived gametes and offspring and could play a vital role in germline conservation and propagation of valued and/or endangered fish species."
https://openalex.org/W2168072191,"In this paper, we apply both agent-based models and queuing models to investigate patient access and patient flow through emergency departments. The objective of this work is to gain insights into the comparative contributions and limitations of these complementary techniques, in their ability to contribute empirical input into healthcare policy and practice guidelines. The models were developed independently, with a view to compare their suitability to emergency department simulation. The current models implement relatively simple general scenarios, and rely on a combination of simulated and real data to simulate patient flow in a single emergency department or in multiple interacting emergency departments. In addition, several concepts from telecommunications engineering are translated into this modeling context. The framework of multiple-priority queue systems and the genetic programming paradigm of evolutionary machine learning are applied as a means of forecasting patient wait times and as a means of evolving healthcare policy, respectively. The models' utility lies in their ability to provide qualitative insights into the relative sensitivities and impacts of model input parameters, to illuminate scenarios worthy of more complex investigation, and to iteratively validate the models as they continue to be refined and extended. The paper discusses future efforts to refine, extend, and validate the models with more data and real data relative to physical (spatial-topographical) and social inputs (staffing, patient care models, etc.). Real data obtained through proximity location and tracking system technologies is one example discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1966156998,"Ras homolog enriched in brain (Rheb), a small GTPase, positively regulates the mTORC1 pathway. The GDP-GTP exchange of Rheb has been suggested to be facilitated by translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP). Here we demonstrate that human TCTP (hTCTP) interacts with human Rheb (hRheb) and accelerates its GDP release in vitro and that hTCTP activates the mTORC1 pathway in vivo. To investigate the underlying mechanism, we built structure models of GDP- and GTP-bound hRheb in complexes with hTCTP and performed molecular dynamics simulations of the models, which predict key residues involved in the interactions and region of hRheb undergoing conformational change during the GDP-GTP exchange. These results are verified with site-directed mutagenesis and in vitro biochemical and in vivo cell biological analyses. Furthermore, a crystal structure of the E12V mutant hTCTP, which lacks the guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity, shows that the deficiency appears to be caused by loss of a salt-bridging interaction with Lys-45 of hRheb. These data collectively provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of how hTCTP interacts with hRheb and activates the mTORC1 pathway."

Herein, we report that the natural product pateamine A (PatA) is capable of inhibiting NMD through direct interaction with eIF4AIII, which is independent of its inhibition of translation initiation. Furthermore, we have characterized the mechanisms by which PatA and cycloheximide modulate NMD.

Although progress has been made in understanding the biochemical role of some human RECQ helicases, that of RECQL5 remains elusive. We recently reported that RECQL5 interacts with RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), pointing to a role for the protein in transcription. Here, we show that RECQL5 inhibits both initiation and elongation in transcription assays reconstituted with highly purified general transcription factors and RNAPII. Such inhibition is not observed with the related, much more active RECQL1 helicase or with a version of RECQL5 that has normal helicase activity but is impaired in its ability to interact with RNAPII. Indeed, RECQL5 helicase activity is not required for inhibition. We discuss our findings in light of the fact that RECQ5(-/-) mice have elevated levels of DNA recombination and a higher incidence of cancer."

Targeting some of the components in endothelial Weibel-Palade bodies (WPBs) effectively inhibits VEGF-induced inflammation, but little is known about how VEGF regulates WPB exocytosis.

This is in good contrast to VEGF-stimulated interleukin-6 release from endothelium, which is selectively mediated through VEGFR1. We further demonstrated that VEGFR2-initiated phospholipase C-γ1 (PLCγ1)/calcium signaling is important but insufficient for full vWF release, suggesting the possible participation of another effector pathway. We found that cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) signaling is required for full vWF release. Importantly, a single mutation of Tyr1175 in the C terminus of VEGFR2, a tyrosine residue crucial for embryonic vasculogenesis, abolished vWF release, concomitant with defective activations of both PLCγ1 and PKA.

WPB exocytosis, which gives rise to rapid release of vWF and other mediators such as interleukin-8 (IL-8) (17.Babich V. Meli A. Knipe L. Dempster J.E. Skehel P. Hannah M.J. Carter T. Blood. 2008; 111: 5282-5290Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and translocation of P-selectin from within granules to the endothelial surfaces triggering leukocyte rolling, are critical early events in endothelial activation and vascular inflammation (16.Wagner D.D. Thromb. Haemost. 1993; 70: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). It has been reported that VEGF regulates vWF/WPB release (20.Matsushita K. Yamakuchi M. Morrell C.N. Ozaki M. O'Rourke B. Irani K. Lowenstein C.J. Blood. 2005; 105: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), but the precise roles of VEGF receptors and their downstream effectors in this process have not been defined. In this study, we sought to dissect the signaling pathway by which VEGF induces vWF/WPB release. Additional procedures are described in the supplemental Materials and Methods. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were grown in medium 199 (Invitrogen) containing fibroblast growth factor, heparin, and 20% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Ogden, UT). Human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) were grown in endothelial growth medium 2-MV (Clonetics, San Diego, CA). Cells were used from passages 3 to 6 and were serum-starved in 2% bovine serum albumin for 4 h before stimulation. To silence phospholipase C-γ1 (PLCγ1) and protein kinase A (PKA) (catalytic α and β subunits), we used a lentiviral system (Sigma) for delivering short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) into HUVECs. The target sequences (see supplemental Materials and Methods) and control scrambled sequences were selected according to an open program on the official website of Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Preparation of lentiviruses and infection of HUVECs were carried out based on a published method (21.Berger R. Lin D.I. Nieto M. Sicinska E. Garraway L.A. Adams H. Signoretti S. Hahn W.C. Loda M. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 5723-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). HUVECs or HAECs were grown until confluent on 48-well plates and serum-starved for 5 h before stimulation with agonists. The amount of vWF released into the medium was determined from American Diagnostica (Greenwich, CT) or from the Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Soochow University, Jiangsu, China (22.Zhou Q.S. Zhao Y.M. Xu C.S. Yu Z.Y. Yao D.Y. Gao Y.M. Ruan C.G. Thromb. Res. 1992; 68: 109-118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The amount of IL-8 was measured by an ELISA from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). The chimeric VEGF receptors used in this study comprised the intracellular and transmembrane domains of VEGFR1 (EGLT) or VEGFR2 (EGDR) fused to the extracellular domain of the human EGF receptor (23.Zeng H. Dvorak H.F. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26969-26979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Construction of tyrosine-to-phenylalanine mutants of Y1175F and Y1214F was as described before (24.LeCouter J. Moritz D.R. Li B. Phillips G.L. Liang X.H. Gerber H.P. Hillan K.J. Ferrara N. Science. 2003; 299: 890-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). EGDR-Y951F was generated by PCR and cloned into the pMMP retroviral vector. See supplemental Materials and Methods for detailed primer sequences. Intracellular free Ca2+ was measured by fluo-4 AM with laser scanning confocal microscopy (Leica, Heidelberg, Germany). Endothelial cells were plated onto collagen-coated coverslips and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C with fluo-4 AM in medium 199 containing 2% bovine serum albumin. For pharmacological studies, cells were pretreated for 30 min with 20 μm 1,2-bis- (2-aminophenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid-acetoxymethyl ester (BAPTA-AM) before stimulation with 50 ng/ml VEGF, PlGF, or VEGF-E. Similar experiments on EGF stimulation were applied to HUVECs, which were transduced with EGLT, EGDR, and its mutants. The concentration of cAMP in HUVECs was measured according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Group differences were analyzed by a standard Student's t test or by Dunnett's test (using GraphPad Prism software, otherwise mentioned in the legends of FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4). All values are expressed as mean ± S.D. Statistical significance was set at a p value less than 0.05 (*) or 0.01 (**). A previous study showed that VEGF stimulates WPB exocytosis from HAECs, as evaluated by vWF release as well as P-selectin translocation (20.Matsushita K. Yamakuchi M. Morrell C.N. Ozaki M. O'Rourke B. Irani K. Lowenstein C.J. Blood. 2005; 105: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To extend this finding, we studied the action of VEGF on vWF release from HUVECs by using a standard vWF ELISA. VEGF rapidly induced a time- and dose-dependent vWF release (Fig. 1, A and B), indicating that VEGF promotes vWF secretion from human venous endothelial cells as well. Interestingly, VEGF was somewhat more powerful than thrombin on a molar basis because stimulation with 1 nm VEGF (50 ng/ml) led to 13 milliunits/ml vWF release, whereas stimulation with 38 nm thrombin (1 unit/ml) led to 7.5 milliunits/ml vWF release (Fig. 1B). A recent study has shown that histamine-induced WPBs can undergo a form of exocytosis during which vWF is retained, whereas smaller molecules, such as IL-8, are released (17.Babich V. Meli A. Knipe L. Dempster J.E. Skehel P. Hannah M.J. Carter T. Blood. 2008; 111: 5282-5290Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Therefore, we also examined IL-8 release from HUVECs in response to VEGF stimulation. VEGF-triggered IL-8 secretion followed a time course similar to that of vWF release (Fig. 1F), suggesting that during VEGF-induced exocytosis, the proportion of WPBs fused with plasma membrane (so-called “lingering kiss”) might be too low to be estimated by our experimental system. This is consistent with the recent study in which the histamine-induced lingering kiss fusion events appeared to be 10∼25% (17.Babich V. Meli A. Knipe L. Dempster J.E. Skehel P. Hannah M.J. Carter T. Blood. 2008; 111: 5282-5290Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). A previous report showed that VEGF induced IL-6 selectively mediated through VEGFR1 but not VEGFR2 (24.LeCouter J. Moritz D.R. Li B. Phillips G.L. Liang X.H. Gerber H.P. Hillan K.J. Ferrara N. Science. 2003; 299: 890-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). To study which receptor mediates the VEGF effect on vWF release, we first examined the expression of VEGF receptors. Both VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 are expressed in HUVECs and HAECs (Fig. 1C). We then used PlGF, a VEGFR1-specific ligand, and VEGF-E, a VEGFR2-specific ligand. Treatment of HUVECs with PlGF resulted in no vWF release, although PlGF was biologically active (supplemental Fig. S1B). In contrast, treatment with VEGF-E rapidly led to vWF release comparable with that of VEGF treatment, indicating that the activation of VEGFR2 alone is sufficient to induce vWF release (Fig. 1, D and E). Similar results were obtained with HAECs (supplemental Fig. S1A). These data suggest that VEGF stimulates vWF release mainly through VEGFR2. VEGF-induced IL-8 release was also mediated via VEGFR2 (Fig. 1F). To validate further the distinctive roles of VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 in vWF secretion, we employed a chimeric receptor approach in which the extracellular domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was substituted for that of VEGFR1 (EGFR-Flt-1, designated EGLT) or VEGFR2 (EGFR-KDR, designated EGDR), and both were expressed in HUVECs by using a retrovirus system (23.Zeng H. Dvorak H.F. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26969-26979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). This system allows independent activation of either receptor by using EGF as an agonist to stimulate the kinase activity of Flt or KDR without activating the endogenous VEGF receptors. As expected, HUVECs transduced with LacZ-expressing viruses did not respond to EGF stimulation. In response to EGF treatment, HUVECs transduced with EGDR rapidly released vWF in a pattern similar to HUVECs responding to VEGF stimulation (Fig. 1, F and G). In contrast, no response was found in HUVECs transduced with EGLT, although it was expressed at a level similar to that of EGDR and became weakly phosphorylated after EGF stimulation (Fig. 1G and supplemental Fig. S2), which is consistent with the nature of VEGFR1 as a weak tyrosine kinase (1.Ferrara N. Gerber H.P. LeCouter J. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (7866) Google Scholar, 2.Shibuya M. Claesson-Welsh L. Exp. Cell Res. 2006; 312: 549-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). These results confirmed that VEGFR2 plays a predominant role in VEGF-induced vWF secretion. Intracellular calcium (Ca2+) increase triggers vWF/WPB exocytosis (16.Wagner D.D. Thromb. Haemost. 1993; 70: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 17.Babich V. Meli A. Knipe L. Dempster J.E. Skehel P. Hannah M.J. Carter T. Blood. 2008; 111: 5282-5290Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Previously, several groups, including ours, found that VEGFR2 activates the PLCγ1/Ca2+ signaling pathway (23.Zeng H. Dvorak H.F. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26969-26979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 25.Takahashi T. Yamaguchi S. Chida K. Shibuya M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2768-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Therefore, we speculated that differential activation of the PLCγ1/Ca2+ pathway by VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 may account for their different roles in the induction of vWF release. The abilities of the two VEGF receptors to activate PLCγ1 and Ca2+ mobilization were further compared by approaches using receptor-specific ligands and the chimeric receptors. As shown in Fig. 2, A–D, both approaches confirmed that the activation of VEGFR2, but not VEGFR1, led to PLCγ1 phosphorylation and elevated the level of intracellular Ca2+ in HUVECs. Similar results were obtained with HAECs (supplemental Fig. S3). A previous study using U73211 (20.Matsushita K. Yamakuchi M. Morrell C.N. Ozaki M. O'Rourke B. Irani K. Lowenstein C.J. Blood. 2005; 105: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), a potent PLCγ1 inhibitor, showed that PLCγ1-activated Ca2+ signaling is important for VEGF-triggered vWF/WPB exocytosis. Because U73122 may affect intracellular Ca2+ levels independent of PLC inhibition (26.Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Ford D.L. Hurt K.J. Bae S.S. Suh P.G. Kurosaki T. Snyder S.H. Gill D.L. Cell. 2002; 111: 529-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 27.Wilsher N.E. Court W.J. Ruddle R. Newbatt Y.M. Aherne W. Sheldrake P.W. Jones N.P. Katan M. Eccles S.A.

BMC Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), we employed PLCγ1-specific shRNAs to inactivate its function to avoid nonspecific effects of U73211. PLCγ1-specific shRNAs were constructed and transduced into HUVECs by using a highly efficient lentiviral system (21.Berger R. Lin D.I. Nieto M. Sicinska E. Garraway L.A. Adams H. Signoretti S. Hahn W.C. Loda M. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 5723-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). shRNA1 was identified as a suitable construct, which reproducibly reduced PLCγ1 expression with an efficiency of ∼90% (Fig. 2E and supplemental Fig. S4). The specificity of this construct was confirmed by the observations that it neither reduced PLCγ2 expression (Fig. 2E and supplemental Fig. S4) nor interfered with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced vWF release (Fig. 2G), which is known to be independent of Ca2+ signaling (29.Carew M.A. Paleolog E.M. Pearson J.D. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Although the expression of a scrambled RNA had no effect on intracellular Ca2+ mobilization, the expression of shRNA1 completely blocked the VEGF-triggered Ca2+ increase at the phases of both initial peak and sustained plateau (Fig. 2F). This result indicates that VEGF-induced intracellular Ca2+ mobilization is critically dependent on PLCγ1. We then assessed the effect of PLCγ1 down-regulation on vWF release. VEGF-induced vWF release was decreased significantly (70% reduction) in shRNA1-expressing HUVECs when compared with that in noninfected cells or scrambled RNA-expressing cells (Fig. 2G), indicating that PLCγ1 is essential for VEGF-induced vWF release. The results indicating that inhibition of VEGFR2-triggered Ca2+ signaling by down-regulating PLCγ1 is unable to block VEGF-induced vWF release completely also strongly suggest the possible participation of another effector pathway. cAMP/PKA signaling is another distinct pathway for the regulation of vWF/WPB exocytosis from endothelial storage granules in response to cAMP-raising agonists (18.Rondaij M.G. Bierings R. Kragt A. van Mourik J.A. Voorberg J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2006; 26: 1002-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 19.Sadler J.E. Mancuso D.J. Randi A.M. Tuley E.A. Westfield L.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1991; 614: 114-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). So far, however, PKA is known only to negatively regulate VEGF functions, such as the inhibition of VEGF-induced endothelial migration (30.Bodnar R.J. Yates C.C. Wells A. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 617-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 31.Mirzapoiazova T. Kolosova I. Usatyuk P.V. Natarajan V. Verin A.D. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2006; 291: L718-L724Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To assess the role of the cAMP/PKA pathway in VEGF-induced vWF release, we first examined the effect of VEGF on the intracellular cAMP level. VEGF stimulation of HUVECs elicited a small, but significant, rise in the intracellular cAMP level as measured by a standard ELISA (Fig. 3A), consistent with a previous report (31.Mirzapoiazova T. Kolosova I. Usatyuk P.V. Natarajan V. Verin A.D. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2006; 291: L718-L724Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To investigate whether intracellular cAMP increase mediates VEGF-induced vWF release, we incubated HUVECs with VEGF in the presence of cAMP analog Rp-8CPT-cAMPS (Rp). Incubation with Rp significantly reduced vWF release (Fig. 3A), indicating an involvement of cAMP increase in VEGF-induced vWF release. The increase in cAMP levels commonly leads to the activation of PKA, which subsequently results in the phosphorylation of target proteins. The activation of PKA, as estimated by measuring the phosphorylation level of the cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB), a PKA substrate (32.Desloges N. Rahaus M. Wolff M.H. Med. Microbiol. Immunol. 2008; 197: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), was increased upon VEGF stimulation (Fig. 3B). To explore the role of PKA in VEGF-induced vWF release, two potent PKA inhibitors (H89 and myristoylated protein kinase inhibitor (14–22)) were used at concentrations that efficiently inhibit the phosphorylation of CREB. Pretreatment of HUVECs slightly, but significantly, inhibited vWF release (20–30% reduction) (Fig. 3C). These data strongly suggest that the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway also plays a role in VEGF-induced vWF release, which is in striking contrast to its negative role in the regulation of endothelial migration (31.Mirzapoiazova T. Kolosova I. Usatyuk P.V. Natarajan V. Verin A.D. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2006; 291: L718-L724Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 33.Mahadev K. Wu X. Donnelly S. Ouedraogo R. Eckhart A.D. Goldstein B.J. Cardiovasc. Res. 2008; 78: 376-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To explore the relationship between the PLCγ1 and PKA pathways, PLCγ1 shRNA-expressing HUVECs were pretreated with two PKA inhibitors before VEGF stimulation. PKA inactivation by either inhibitor significantly suppressed the residual vWF release (about 25% reduction) (Fig. 3D), indicating that the PKA pathway acts in parallel with the PLCγ1/Ca2+ pathway. To validate further the role of PKA in VEGF-induced vWF release, specific shRNAs targeting the catalytic α and β subunits of PKA were screened, and two efficient shRNAs (shRNA Cα1 and shRNA Cβ1) were identified (Fig. 3E and supplemental Fig. S5). Knockdown of either the α subunit or the β subunit of PKA significantly attenuated VEGF-induced vWF release (Fig. 3F), suggesting that PKA is required for vWF release. To confirm that the VEGF-activated PLCγ1 and PKA pathways are distinct, the effect of PLCγ1 shRNAs on the activation of PKA and the effect of PKA shRNAs on the activation of PLCγ1 were examined. Although PKA shRNAs did not show any inhibitory effect on VEGF-induced PLCγ1 phosphorylation, PLCγ1 shRNAs slightly but insignificantly interfered with VEGF-induced activation of PKA (Fig. 3, H and I). Taken together, the results show that VEGF-induced vWF release requires both PLCγ1/Ca2+-dependent and PKA-dependent signaling pathways. Similarly, PLCγ1 and PKA pathways are also required for VEGF-induced IL-8 release (Fig. 3G). So far, Tyr951, Tyr1175, and Tyr1214 in VEGFR2, the most prominent noncatalytic autophosphorylation sites (4.Kowanetz M. Ferrara N. Clin. Cancer Res. 2006; 12: 5018-5022Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 34.Matsumoto T. Bohman S. Dixelius J. Berge T. Dimberg A. Magnusson P. Wang L. Wikner C. Qi J.H. Wernstedt C. Wu J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 27081-27087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the roles of these residues in PLCγ1 activation and vWF release by point mutagenesis. We first showed that the various VEGFR2 mutants (Y951F, Y1175F, and Y1214F) were expressed at similar levels in HUVECs (Fig. 4A), and then we compared their capacities to stimulate PLCγ1 phosphorylation. Interestingly, a single mutation Y1175F abolished EGF-induced PLCγ1 phosphorylation (Fig. 4B). Consistently, the Y1175F mutation abolished EGF-induced Ca2+ release and entry (Fig. 4C). In contrast, mutant receptors with Y951F and Y1214F retained their capacities to activate PLCγ1 (Fig. 4B), whereas mutations Y1214F and Y951F did not or only slightly affected Ca2+ mobilization (Fig. 4C). We further examined the abilities of the mutants to stimulate vWF release. Interestingly, the Y1175F mutant completely lost its ability to induce vWF release, whereas Y951F and 1214F mutants were still able to activate as effectively as the wild type receptor (Fig. 4D), indicating that Tyr1175 is essential for VEGF-induced vWF release. This result also suggests that the Y1175F mutant may fail to activate the cAMP/PKA pathway. Consistent with this, the Y1175F, but not other mutants, had a defective activation of PKA in response to EGF stimulation, which was accompanied by lower cAMP levels than wild type (Fig. 4, E and F). These data indicate that Tyr1175 plays an essential role in vWF release through mediating both PLCγ1/Ca2+-dependent and cAMP/PKA-dependent signaling pathways. vWF/WPB exocytosis is one of the earliest events in endothelial activation and vascular inflammation (16.Wagner D.D. Thromb. Haemost. 1993; 70: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 19.Sadler J.E. Mancuso D.J. Randi A.M. Tuley E.A. Westfield L.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1991; 614: 114-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Targeting some components of WPBs, such as P-selectin, reduced VEGF-induced inflammation (6.Detmar M. Brown L.F. Schön M.P. Elicker B.M. Velasco P. Richard L. Fukumura D. Monsky W. Claffey K.P. Jain R.K. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1998; 111: 1-6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar), suggesting that VEGF stimulation of vWF/WPB exocytosis may be an important mechanism by which VEGF contributes to inflammation. Recently, potent VEGF-capturing reagents such as antibodies against VEGF or inhibitors of VEGF receptor kinase have proven to be very effective in animal inflammation models (8.Reinders M.E. Sho M. Izawa A. Wang P. Mukhopadhyay D. Koss K.E. Geehan C.S. Luster A.D. Sayegh M.H. Briscoe D.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 1655-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 9.Yano K. Liaw P.C. Mullington J.M. Shih S.C. Okada H. Bodyak N. Kang P.M. Toltl L. Belikoff B. Buras J. Simms B.T. Mizgerd J.P. Carmeliet P. Karumanchi S.A. Aird W.C. J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 1447-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Because VEGF receptors are critical not only for endothelial cell function but also for cellular processes such as neuronal survival (37.Brockington A. Lewis C. Wharton S. Shaw P.J. Neuropathol. Appl. Neurobiol. 2004; 30: 427-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), inhibition of specific VEGFR-induced signaling pathways may be preferable in long term treatments, especially for chronic inflammation. In this study, we clearly demonstrate that VEGF is a potent agonist that stimulates vWF/WPB release from endothelial cells, and this stimulation is mediated by VEGFR2 through both PLCγ1-dependent (in large part) and PKA-dependent (to a lesser extent) dependent signaling pathways (Fig. 5). This is in contrast to the role that VEGR1 plays in inflammation by promoting the migration and secretion of monocytes/macrophages in which only VEGFR1 is expressed (11.Brown L.F. Harrist T.J. Yeo K.T. Ståhle-Bäckdahl M. Jackman R.W. Berse B. Tognazzi K. Dvorak H.F. Detmar M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 104: 744-749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 14.Pickkers P. Sprong T. Eijk L. Hoeven H. Smits P. Deuren M. Shock. 2005; 24: 508-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In addition, this is also in good contrast to VEGF-stimulated IL-6 release from endothelium, which is selectively mediated through VEGFR1 (24.LeCouter J. Moritz D.R. Li B. Phillips G.L. Liang X.H. Gerber H.P. Hillan K.J. Ferrara N. Science. 2003; 299: 890-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). We show, to our knowledge, for the first time that the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway plays a positive role in the regulation of VEGF function (Fig. 5), in a manner opposite to its inhibitory effect on endothelial migration and tube formation (30.Bodnar R.J. Yates C.C. Wells A. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 617-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 31.Mirzapoiazova T. Kolosova I. Usatyuk P.V. Natarajan V. Verin A.D. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2006; 291: L718-L724Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, this is not unexpected because PKA is a critical effector for vWF/WPB exocytosis from endothelial storage granules in response to cAMP-raising agonists (18.Rondaij M.G. Bierings R. Kragt A. van Mourik J.A. Voorberg J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2006; 26: 1002-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Interestingly, unlike cAMP-raising agonists, VEGF disrupts endothelial barrier function (38.Weis S. Cui J. Barnes L. Cheresh D. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), which may also contribute to inflammation. When compared with the vWF release triggered by PLCγ1/Ca2+ signaling, which occurs within 2–5 min after VEGF stimulation, the release induced by cAMP/PKA signaling occurs about 5 min or more after VEGF stimulation and is relatively mild. 3Y. Xiong and J. Luo, unpublished data. The use of both signaling pathways by VEGFR2 may ensure rapid and continuous vWF/WPB release in response to VEGF stimulation. In previous studies, in addition to Tyr1175, the residues Tyr951 and Tyr1214 were also linked to PLCγ1 activation by VEGFR2 (25.Takahashi T. Yamaguchi S. Chida K. Shibuya M.

Our data showed that receptor with the Tyr1175 mutant was completely incapable of activating PLCγ1 phosphorylation and intracellular Ca2+ mobilization, whereas receptors with the Y951F or Y1214F mutation retained these functions (Fig. 4). The discrepancies concerning the residues responsible for PLCγ1 activation found in this study from those in the literature may be due to the different experimental systems. For example, one study on the interaction between Tyr951 and PLCγ1 was performed in a yeast two-hybrid system (35.Wu L.W. Mayo L.D. Dunbar J.D. Kessler K.M. Baerwald M.R. Jaffe E.A. Wang D. Warren R.S. Donner D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5096-5103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the data obtained with the yeast system are sometimes inconsistent with protein-protein interaction events in mammalian cells (39.Fukuhara S. Sakurai A. Sano H. Yamagishi A.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 480: 32-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Our work compared the roles of all three of these residues in VEGFR2 in the activation of PLCγ1/Ca2+ signaling in primary human endothelial cells. In a recent report, an adaptor molecule TSAd was suggested to be a more important Tyr951-binding protein than PLCγ1 in the regulation of endothelial cell migration (31.Mirzapoiazova T. Kolosova I. Usatyuk P.V. Natarajan V. Verin A.D. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2006; 291: L718-L724Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), consistent with our finding. Tyr1175 of VEGFR2 is a critical residue for the regulation of vascular functions. A recent study from the Shibuya group (41.Sakurai Y. Ohgimoto K. Kataoka Y. Yoshida N. Shibuya M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 1076-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) showed that exchange of Tyr1173 (corresponding to Tyr1175 in VEGFR2/KDR) for Phe in mouse VEGFR2/Flk-1 resulted in a loss-of-function phenotype and embryonic lethality, indicating that signaling via Tyr1175 is essential for VEGFR2 functions during mouse vasculogenesis. Our study suggests a new role that Tyr1175 plays in the induction of vWF/WPB exocytosis from endothelial cells within adult vessels. In addition, Tyr1175 mediates the PLCγ1/MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling pathway by which VEGF stimulates endothelial DNA synthesis (25.Takahashi T. Yamaguchi S. Chida K. Shibuya M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2768-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar) and also mediates cell migration through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase mediated by the adaptor proteins Shb and ShcB (1.Ferrara N. Gerber H.P. LeCouter J. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (7866) Google Scholar, 2.Shibuya M. Claesson-Welsh L. Exp. Cell Res. 2006; 312: 549-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar, 3.Rahimi N. Exp. Eye Res. 2006; 83: 1005-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Therefore, Tyr1175 is a unique residue that mediates multiple functions via several signaling pathways in both embryonic development and adult pathophysiological conditions. The identification of cAMP/PKA signaling as a novel Tyr1175-mediated pathway raises new questions. For example, how does Tyr1175 regulate the activation of the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway? Previously, several groups, including ours, found a cross-talk between G protein-coupled receptors and VEGFR2 (42.Zeng H. Zhao D. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46791-46798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that Tyr1175 may transmit a signal from VEGFR2 to G protein-coupled receptors through adaptor proteins (such as Shb/ShcB) and in turn transactivate adenylate cyclase to induce cAMP/PKA signaling (Fig. 5). It is equally possible that VEGFR2 may activate PKA directly via a cAMP-independent mechanism (43.Ma Y. Pitson S. Hercus T. Murphy J. Lopez A. Woodcock J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26011-26017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In summary, our study demonstrates a key role of Tyr1175 in VEGFR2 in vWF/WPB exocytosis from endothelial cells in response to VEGF stimulation and indicates its usefulness as a potential target in the future development of anti-inflammatory strategies. During the preparation of this manuscript, a report described the role of PKCδ in VEGF-induced vWF secretion (44.Lorenzi O. Frieden M. Villemin P. Fournier M. Foti M. Vischer U.M. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2008; 11: 1962-1969Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Because PKC functions downstream of PLCγ1, it appears that PLCγ1-dependent vWF release from endothelial cells in response to VEGF is mediated through both Ca2+ signaling and PKC signaling pathways.

https://openalex.org/W2101792144,"Human FGF1 (fibroblast growth factor 1) is a powerful signaling molecule with a short half-life in vivo and a denaturation temperature close to physiological. Binding to heparin increases the stability of FGF1 and is believed to be important in the formation of FGF1.fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) active complex. In order to reveal the function of heparin in FGF1.FGFR complex formation and signaling, we constructed several FGF1 variants with reduced affinity for heparin and with diverse stability. We determined their biophysical properties and biological activities as well as their ability to translocate across cellular membranes. Our study showed that increased thermodynamic stability of FGF1 nicely compensates for decreased binding of heparin in FGFR activation, induction of DNA synthesis, and cell proliferation. By stepwise introduction of stabilizing mutations into the K118E (K132E) FGF1 variant that shows reduced affinity for heparin and is inactive in stimulation of DNA synthesis, we were able to restore the full mitogenic activity of this mutant. Our results indicate that the main role of heparin in FGF-induced signaling is to protect this naturally unstable protein against heat and/or proteolytic degradation and that heparin is not essential for a direct FGF1-FGFR interaction and receptor activation."

All of the human enzymes involved in mitochondrial FAS have been characterized except for β-ketoacyl thioester reductase (HsKAR), which catalyzes the second step in the pathway. We report here the unexpected finding that a heterotetramer composed of human 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 8 (/M7β-HSD8) and human carbonyl reductase type 4 (HsCBR4) forms the long-sought HsKAR Both proteins share sequence similarities to the yeast 3-oxoacyl-(acyl carrier protein) reductase (Oarlp) and the bacterial FabG, although HsKAR is NADH dependent, whereas FabG and Oarlp are NADPH dependent. Hs17β-HSD8 and HsCBR4 show a strong genetic interaction in vivo in yeast, where, only if they are expressed together, they rescue the respiratory deficiency and restore the lipoic acid content of oarl∆ cells. Moreover, these two proteins display a stable physical interaction and form an active heterotetramer. Both Hs17β-HSD8 and HsCBR4 are targeted to mitochondria in vivo in cultured HeLa cells. Notably, 17β-HSD8 was previously classified as a steroid-metabolizing enzyme, but our data suggest that 17β-HSD8 is primarily involved in mitochondrial FAS.—Chen, Z., Kastaniotis, A.

https://openalex.org/W2032151823,"Coronavirus host and cell specificities are determined by specific interactions between the viral spike (S) protein and host cell receptor(s). Avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis (IBV) has been adapted to embryonated chicken eggs, primary chicken kidney (CK) cells, monkey kidney cell line Vero, and other human and animal cells. Here we report that acquisition of the cell–cell fusion activity by amino acid mutations in the S protein determines the infectivity of IBV in cultured cells. Expression of S protein derived from Vero- and CK-adapted strains showed efficient induction of membrane fusion. However, expression of S protein cloned from the third passage of IBV in chicken embryo (EP3) did not show apparent syncytia formation. By construction of chimeric S constructs and site-directed mutagenesis, a point mutation (L857-F) at amino acid position 857 in the heptad repeat 1 region of S protein was shown to be responsible for its acquisition of the cell–cell fusion activity. Furthermore, a G405-D point mutation in the S1 domain, which was acquired during further propagation of Vero-adapted IBV in Vero cells, could enhance the cell–cell fusion activity of the protein. Re-introduction of L857 back to the S gene of Vero-adapted IBV allowed recovery of variants that contain the introduced L857. However, compensatory mutations in S1 and some distant regions of S2 were required for restoration of the cell–cell fusion activity of S protein carrying L857 and for the infectivity of the recovered variants in cultured cells. This study demonstrates that acquisition of the cell–cell fusion activity in S protein determines the selection and/or adaptation of a coronavirus from chicken embryo to cultured cells of human and animal origins."
https://openalex.org/W1999094671,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis remains a widespread and devastating human pathogen, whose ability to infiltrate macrophage host cells from the human immune system is an active area of investigation. We have recently reported the discovery of a novel diterpene from M. tuberculosis, edaxadiene, whose ability to arrest phagosomal maturation in isolation presumably contributes to this critical process in M. tuberculosis infections. (Mann, F. M., Xu, M., Chen, X., Fulton, D. B., Russell, D. G., and Peters, R. J. (2009) J. Am. Chem. Soc., in press). Here, we present characterization of the class II diterpene cyclase that catalyzes the committed step in edaxadiene biosynthesis, i.e. the previously identified halimadienyl-diphosphate synthase (HPS; EC 5.5.1.16). Intriguingly, our kinetic analysis suggests a potential biochemical regulatory mechanism that triggers edaxadiene production upon phagosomal engulfment. Furthermore, we report characterization of potential HPS inhibitors: specifically, two related transition state analogs (15-aza-14,15-dihydrogeranylgeranyl diphosphate (7a) and 15-aza-14,15-dihydrogeranylgeranyl thiolodiphosphate (7b)) that exhibit very tight binding. Although arguably not suitable for clinical use, these nevertheless provide a basis for pharmaceutical design against this intriguing biosynthetic pathway. Finally, we provide evidence indicating that this pathway exists only in M. tuberculosis and is not functional in the closely related Mycobacterium bovis because of an inactivating frameshift in the HPS-encoding gene. Thus, we hypothesize that the inability to produce edaxadiene may be a contributing factor in the decreased infectivity and/or virulence of M. bovis relative to M. tuberculosis in humans."

Mutations in three of the five known RecQ family members in humans, BLM, WRN and RecQ4, lead to disorders that are characterized by predisposition to cancer and premature aging. Methodology/Principal Findings To address the in vivo functions of Drosophila RecQ4 (dRecQ4), we generated mutant alleles of dRecQ4 using the targeted gene knock-out technique. Our data show that dRecQ4 mutants are homozygous lethal with defects in DNA replication, cell cycle progression and cell proliferation. Two sets of experiments suggest that dRecQ4 also plays a role in DNA double strand break repair. First, mutant animals exhibit sensitivity to gamma irradiation. Second, the efficiency of DsRed reconstitution via single strand annealing repair is significantly reduced in the dRecQ4 mutant animals. Rescue experiments further show that both the N-terminal domain and the helicase domain are essential to dRecQ4 function in vivo. The N-terminal domain is sufficient for the DNA repair function of dRecQ4. Conclusions/Significance Together, our results show that dRecQ4 is an essential gene that plays an important role in not only DNA replication but also DNA repair and cell cycle progression in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2082780838,"Rin1 is a Rab5 guanine nucleotide exchange factor that plays an important role in Ras-activated endocytosis and growth factor receptor trafficking in fibroblasts. In this study, we show that Rin1 is expressed at high levels in a large number of non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, including Hop62, H650, HCC4006, HCC827, EKVX, HCC2935, and A549. Rin1 depletion from A549 cells resulted in a decrease in cell proliferation that was correlated to a decrease in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling. Expression of wild type Rin1 but not the Rab5 guanine nucleotide exchange factor-deficient Rin1 (Rin1Delta) complemented the Rin1 depletion effects, and overexpression of Rin1Delta had a dominant negative effect on cell proliferation. Rin1 depletion stabilized the cell surface levels of EGFR, suggesting that internalization was necessary for robust signaling in A549 cells. In support of this conclusion, introduction of either dominant negative Rab5 or dominant negative dynamin decreased A549 proliferation and EGFR signaling. These data demonstrate that proper internalization and endocytic trafficking are critical for EGFR-mediated signaling in A549 cells and suggest that up-regulation of Rin1 in A549 cell lines may contribute to their proliferative nature."
https://openalex.org/W2065297126,"Background Insights into how the Frizzled/LRP6 receptor complex receives, transduces and terminates Wnt signals will enhance our understanding of the control of the Wnt/ß-catenin pathway. Methodology/Principal Findings In pursuit of such insights, we performed a genome-wide RNAi screen in Drosophila cells expressing an activated form of LRP6 and a β-catenin-responsive reporter. This screen resulted in the identification of Bili, a Band4.1-domain containing protein, as a negative regulator of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. We found that the expression of Bili in Drosophila embryos and larval imaginal discs significantly overlaps with the expression of Wingless (Wg), the Drosophila Wnt ortholog, which is consistent with a potential function for Bili in the Wg pathway. We then tested the functions of Bili in both invertebrate and vertebrate animal model systems. Loss-of-function studies in Drosophila and zebrafish embryos, as well as human cultured cells, demonstrate that Bili is an evolutionarily conserved antagonist of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Mechanistically, we found that Bili exerts its antagonistic effects by inhibiting the recruitment of AXIN to LRP6 required during pathway activation. Conclusions These studies identify Bili as an evolutionarily conserved negative regulator of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2023974182,"The metalloenzyme aminopeptidase P catalyzes the hydrolysis of amino acids from the amino termini of peptides with a prolyl residue in the second position. The human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum expresses a homolog of aminopeptidase P during its asexual intraerythrocytic cycle. P. falciparum aminopeptidase P (PfAPP) shares with mammalian cytosolic aminopeptidase P a three-domain, homodimeric organization and is most active with Mn(II) as the cofactor. A distinguishing feature of PfAPP is a 120-amino acid amino-terminal extension that appears to be removed from the mature protein. PfAPP is present in the food vacuole and cytosol of the parasite, a distribution that suggests roles in vacuolar hemoglobin catabolism and cytosolic peptide turnover. To evaluate the plausibility of these putative functions, the stability and kinetic properties of recombinant PfAPP were evaluated at the acidic pH of the food vacuole and at the near-neutral pH of the cytosol. PfAPP exhibited high stability at 37 degrees C in the pH range 5.0-7.5. In contrast, recombinant human cytosolic APP1 was unstable and formed a high molecular weight aggregate at acidic pH. At both acidic and slightly basic pH values, PfAPP efficiently hydrolyzed the amino-terminal X-Pro bond of the nonapeptide bradykinin and of two globin pentapeptides that are potential in vivo substrates. These results provide support for roles for PfAPP in peptide catabolism in both the food vacuole and the cytosol and suggest that PfAPP has evolved a dual distribution in response to the metabolic needs of the intraerythrocytic parasite."
https://openalex.org/W2081304464,"Previously, we showed that interactions between p90RSK1 (RSK1) and the subunits of type I protein kinase A (PKA) regulate the activity of PKA and cellular distribution of active RSK1 (Chaturvedi, D., Poppleton, H. M., Stringfield, T., Barbier, A., and Patel, T. B. (2006) Mol. Cell Biol. 26, 4586–4600). Here we examined the role of the PKARIα subunit of PKA in regulating RSK1 activation and cell survival. In mouse lung fibroblasts, silencing of the PKARIα increased the phosphorylation and activation of RSK1, but not of RSK2 and RSK3, in the absence of any stimulation. Silencing of PKARIα also decreased the nuclear accumulation of active RSK1 and increased its cytoplasmic content. The increased activation of RSK1 in the absence of any agonist and changes in its subcellular redistribution resulted in increased phosphorylation of its cytoplasmic substrate BAD and increased cell survival. The activity of PKA and phosphorylation of BAD (Ser-155) were also enhanced when PKARIα was silenced, and this, in part, contributed to increased cell survival in unstimulated cells. Furthermore, we show that RSK1, PKA subunits, D-AKAP1, and protein phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit (PP2Ac) exist in a complex, and dissociation of RSK1 from D-AKAP1 by either silencing of PKARIα, depletion of D-AKAP1, or by using a peptide that competes with PKARIα for binding to AKAPs, decreased the amount of PP2Ac in the RSK1 complex. We also demonstrate that PP2Ac is one of the phosphatases that dephosphorylates RSK, but not ERK1/2. Thus, in unstimulated cells, the increased phosphorylation and activation of RSK1 after silencing of PKARIα or depletion of D-AKAP1 are due to decreased association of PP2Ac in the RSK1 complex. Previously, we showed that interactions between p90RSK1 (RSK1) and the subunits of type I protein kinase A (PKA) regulate the activity of PKA and cellular distribution of active RSK1 (Chaturvedi, D., Poppleton, H.

We have shown that the PKARIα and PKAcα subunits of PKA interact with the inactive and active forms of p90RSK1 (RSK1), respectively (15.Chaturvedi D. Poppleton H.M. Stringfield T. Barbier A. Patel T.B. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 4586-4600Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).

Importantly, however, loss of heterozygosity or alterations in PKA activity may not contribute toward the tumorigenicity in either CNC patients or mouse model of CNC (21.Veugelers M. Wilkes D.

This suggests that loss of function(s) of PKARIα other than inhibition of PKA activity is(are) involved in the enhanced tumorigenicity in CNC patients and in the murine CNC model.

Poppleton H.M. Stringfield T. Barbier A. Patel T.B. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 4586-4600Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), we reasoned that in conditions such as CNC where PKARIα levels are decreased, the increase in tumorigenicity may emanate from aberrant regulation of the activity and/or subcellular localization of RSK1. Therefore, herein we have investigated whether PKARIα regulates the activation of RSK1 and its biological functions. Decreasing expression of PKARIα by small interfering RNA (siRNA) enhanced the activation of RSK1, but not RSK2 or RSK3, in the absence of an agonist such as EGF. This was accompanied by an increase in the cytoplasmic localization of the active RSK1 and enhanced cell survival in the absence of any growth factor. Silencing of PKARIα also increased PKAc activity and while part of the anti-apoptotic response could be attributed to an increase in PKAc activity, activation of RSK1 under basal conditions contributed significantly to cell survival. The elevation in RSK1 activity upon PKARIα silencing was not due to increased PKAc activity. Rather the activation of RSK1 in the absence of PKARIα was due to a decrease in PP2A in the RSK1 complex. These findings demonstrate a novel role for PKARIα in the regulation of RSK1 activation, a key enzyme that mediates the downstream actions of the ERK1/2 cascade. Mouse lung fibroblasts (B82L) overexpressing EGF receptor were from Dr. Paul J. Bertics, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI. Anti-phospho BAD (Ser-112 and Ser-155), anti-BAD, anti-phospho-PKA substrate antibody, anti-phospho-RSK (Thr-573), anti-phospho-RSK (Ser-380), and anti-cleaved PARP antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Anti-phospho-RSK1 (Ser-380) from Epitomics (Burlingame, CA), anti-phospho-RSK1/2 (Ser-221) from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN), monoclonal anti-actin antibody (MP Biomedicals, Aurora, OH), anti-Erk1/2 and anti-PP2Ac antibodies (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions, Temecula, CA), anti-RSK1 and anti-PKAc antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) were also used. The anti-PKARIα and monoclonal D-AKAP (catalog no. 611573) antibodies were from BD Biosciences (Palo Alto, CA). The polyclonal D-AKAP1 antibody was provided by Dr. Susan Taylor (University of California at San Diego). Control and shRNA-expressing D-AKAP1 (Mouse pLKO.1 lentiviral target gene shRNA set, catalog no. RMM4534) constructs were from OpenBiosystems. Control and shRNA expressing D-AKAP1-stable B82L cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and maintained in 4 μg/ml puromycin. B82L cells were plated at 50–70% confluency in serum containing media. After 24 h, and just prior to siRNA transfections, the culture medium was replaced with serum free media. Control or PKARIα (20 nm)-specific or PP2Ac (40 nm)-specific siRNAs were transfected using transit TKO (Mirus) as described by the manufacturer. Cells were incubated for 72 h before experimentation. The 27 ± 2 ribonucleotide long PKARIα-specific siRNA (sequence: 5′-GGA GGA GGC AAG ACA GAU UCA GUG UCU AC-3′ (sense)/5′-AGA CAC UGA AUC UGU CUU GCC UCC UCC UU-3′ (antisense)), PP2Ac siRNA (sequence: 5′-CGU UCA AGA GGU UCG AUG UCC AGU CAC TG-3′ (sense)/5′-GUG ACU GGA CAU CGA ACC UCU UGA ACG TT-3′ (antisense)) and control siRNA (sequence: 5′-GGA GCU GCG UUC ACU GUA AGA GAC UGU AC-3′ (sense)/5′-ACA GUC UCU UAC AGU GAA CGC AGC UCC UU-3′ (antisense)) were synthesized commercially (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA). BAD siRNA was purchased from Ambion (catalog no. 4390771). B82L cells were transfected with 40 nm BAD siRNA, and the experiments were performed after 72 h of transfections. B82L cells were plated on 60-mm dishes at 50–70% confluency in serum-containing media. After 24 h 2 μg of DNA of shRNA expressing D-AKAP1 constructs (catalog nos. TRCN0000088538, TRCN0000088539, and TRCN0000088541) and control were transfected using transit TKO (Mirus) as described by the manufacturer. After 24 h the culture medium was replaced with fresh medium. After 48 h of transfection 2 μg/ml puromycin was added to the culture medium for 1 week. After 1 week of 2 μg/ml puromycin, concentration of puromycin was raised to 4 μg/ml, and the stable D-AKAP1 cell lines were maintained at this concentration for at least 2 weeks prior to experimentation. These selected cell lines are represented in Fig. 6 (D and E) as 538, 539, and 541. Total RNA was isolated from semi-confluent control, and shRNA-expressing D-AKAP1 B82L cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Equal amounts of RNA were reverse transcribed using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's instructions. For semi-quantitative PCR, equal amounts of reverse-transcribed RNA were used with the following D-AKAP1 primers: forward primer, 5′-TGG CTG GTG GTG GTT TTT-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-CTC TCT CGC TTT CTC TCC-3′. D-AKAP1 primers were designed using mouse D-AKAP1 sequence (accession no. NM_009648.2) nucleotides 50–77 for forward and nucleotides 544–561 for reverse primer. Prolylhydroxylase 2 mRNA (using forward primer, 5′-GAT ACA AGC TTA TGG CCA GTG ACA GC-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-TGT TAT CTA GAC TAG ACG TAT TTG CTG ACT GAA TTG GGC TTG A-3′) was monitored as internal control. Semi-quantitative PCR was performed on RoboCycler Gradient 40 (Stratagene). The reaction mixture consisted of 0.1 μg/μl cDNA template, 100 ng of each primers, 2 μl of DMSO, 50 units of Fast Start TaqDNA polymerase in a 50-μl reaction volume. The PCR protocol consisted of one 4-min denaturation cycle at 95 °C followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 45 s, and extension at 72 °C for 90 s. Final extension cycle was 10 min at 72 °C. Equal volumes of PCR products were analyzed on 1.5% agarose gel. B82L cells that had been serum-starved were transfected with 20 nm each of either PKARI or control siRNA or 40 nm of PP2Ac siRNA. 72 or 48 h after transfection with PKARIα siRNA or PP2Ac siRNA, respectively, cells were subjected to the various treatments as indicated. RSK1 IPs were performed using 250 μg of total cell lysate protein and 700 ng of anti-RSK1 antibody for 2 h at 4 °C. BAD IPs from cells treated with either vehicle, PKI (10 μm, overnight), or 8CPT-cAMP (100 μm for 30 min) at 37 °C were performed at 4 °C overnight using 1 mg of total cell lysate protein and 2 μg anti-BAD antibody. To monitor PP2Ac in complex with RSK1, cells were treated with 20 μm of Ht31 or Ht31P for 15 min at 37 °C. PP2Ac IPs were performed using 1 mg of cell lysate protein and 2 μg of anti-PP2Ac antibody incubated at 4 °C overnight. D-AKAP1 IPs were performed using 20 μl of D-AKAP1 polyclonal antibody (gift from Dr. Susan Taylor, UCSD) and 500 μg of cell lysate at 4 °C overnight. For all IPs, cells were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% CHAPS (ICN Biomedicals Inc., Aurora, OH), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm microcystin, and 1 μg/ml each pepstatin A, aprotinin, and leupeptin. The immune complexes were precipitated by incubation with 30 μl of protein G-agarose beads (Roche Applied Science) at 4 °C and washed three times with lysis buffer. Proteins were separated on 10% polyacrylamide gels for immunoblotting. Triplicate IPs of RSK1, performed as described above, were resuspended in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm MgSO4, 200 μm Kemptide, 125 μm ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (final volume, 120 μl) for 10 min at room temperature. The RSK1/2 inhibitor, SL-0101 (1 μm), was added to the kinase activity reaction buffer as indicated in Fig. 1B. Reactions were terminated by the addition of equal volume of 20% trichloroacetic acid and following centrifugation (16,000 × g, 5 min), aliquots (100 μl) of each supernatant were spotted onto P81 paper (Whatman), air-dried, and washed three times with 0.5% phosphoric acid. The filters were then dried and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. One parallel set of immunoprecipitated proteins were denatured in Laemmli sample buffer, separated on 10% polyacrylamide gels, and analyzed by immunoblotting to ensure that equal amount of RSK1 was immunoprecipitated under different conditions. B82L cells were transfected with 20 nm each of PKARI[α] or control siRNA under serum-free conditions. 72 h after transfection cells were stimulated with 50 nm EGF for 10 min and fixed with 100% methanol for 10 min at −20 °C, followed by 1:1 methanol:acetone for 10 min at −20 °C. After permeabilizing the cells with 0.3% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min, rabbit anti-phospho-Thr-573 RSK (1:250 dilution), and monoclonal anti-PKARIα (1:250 dilution) antibodies were added. The secondary antibodies were goat-anti-rabbit-conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 or goat-anti-mouse-conjugated to 594 (1:500 dilution). Images were captured as described before (15.Chaturvedi D. Poppleton H.M. Stringfield T. Barbier A. Patel T.B. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 4586-4600Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). For quantification, the fluorescence density in at least 10 cells from different fields was quantified using NIH ImageJ software. For PKARIα whole cell fluorescence was quantified. For phospho-Thr-573 RSK1, the nuclear fluorescence intensity was subtracted from the whole cell fluorescence to obtain a value for the cytoplasmic RSK1. The mean ± S.D. values are shown. For cytosolic and nuclear fractions, cells transfected with siRNAs were lysed using a hypotonic buffer from the nuclear extraction kit (Active Motif) and incubated on ice for 15 min. Cell lysates obtained were centrifuged at 200 × g to remove intact cells and cell debris. The supernatant from this step was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to pellet cell nuclei. The nuclear pellet was washed and centrifuged at the same speed. Supernatants obtained were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to pellet mitochondria, etc., and the resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g to generate the cytosolic fraction. The proteins from the cytosolic fractions were precipitated using 4 volumes of acetone followed by 2 washes with acetone:water (4:1). The pellets obtained were air-dried and resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer. The nuclear and cytosolic proteins were analyzed on 10% polyacrylamide gels followed by Western blotting. B82L cells (50,000 cells/well) in a 24-well dish were transfected with control and PKARIα siRNAs in serum-free media as described above. After 72 h of siRNA treatment, cells were stimulated with 50 nm EGF for 10 min. When indicated, the RSK inhibitor (fmk, 3 μm) was added 15 min before EGF treatment. Similarly, when indicated, cells were preincubated with PKI (10 μm) or 8CPT-cAMP (100 μm) at 37 °C for 16 h and 30 min, respectively, and then treated with or without 20 ng/ml TNF-α plus 25 μg/ml cycloheximide (CHX) to induce apoptosis. One hour after TNF/CHX treatment, DNA fragmentation was measured using the Cell Death detection kit (Roche Applied Science) as described before (15.Chaturvedi D. Poppleton H.M. Stringfield T.

As an alternate method to monitor apoptosis, cell lysates were immunoblotted for cleaved PARP. RSK family members represent proteins with two kinase domains, the N-terminal kinase and C-terminal kinase, joined together by a linker region. Activation of RSK1 is absolutely dependent upon the docking of ERK to the C terminus (29.Gavin A.C. Nebreda A.R. Curr.

The C-terminal kinase autophosphorylates RSK1 on Ser-380 (31.Frödin M. Gammeltoft S. Mol. Cell Endocrinol. 1999; 151: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar), which forms a phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 binding site (32.Frödin M. Jensen C.J. Merienne K.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5396-5407Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Finally, phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 phosphorylates RSK1 on Ser-221 in the activation loop of the N-terminal kinase (34.Jensen C.J. Buch M.B. Krag T.O. Hemmings B.A. Gammeltoft S.

Cell Endocrinol. 1999; 151: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Previously, we showed that inactive RSK1 associates with PKARIα while the active RSK1 interacts with PKAc (15.Chaturvedi D. Poppleton H.M. Stringfield T. Barbier A. Patel T.B. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 4586-4600Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This indirect interaction of RSK1 with AKAPs such as D-AKAP1 determines the cellular localization of the active RSK1 (15.Chaturvedi D. Poppleton H.M. Stringfield T. Barbier A. Patel T.B. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 4586-4600Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, whether the interaction of RSK1 with PKA·AKAP complex regulates activation of RSK1 remains unknown. Therefore, we determined the role of the interactions between RSK1, PKARIα, and D-AKAP1 on the activation of RSK1 and its biological function. In B82L, mouse lung fibroblast silencing of PKARIα increased phosphorylation of RSK1 on Ser-380, Ser-221, and Thr-573 under basal, unstimulated, conditions while the phosphorylation of these sites in the presence of EGF was the same (Figs. 1, A and B). In vitro kinase activity assays of immunoprecipitated RSK1 confirmed that silencing of PKARIα increased the basal activity of RSK1 in unstimulated cells and that exposure of cells to EGF elevated RSK1 activity that was not further augmented by down-regulation of PKARIα (Fig. 1B). That the amount of RSK in the IPs was the same is shown by the Western blot of a portion of the IPs used in the in vitro kinase assays (Fig. 1B, top right panel). Moreover, it should be noted that the IPs of RSK1 do not contain any RSK2 or RSK3 (supplemental Fig. S1A) and that the RSK1 inhibitor, SL-0101 (23.Smith J.A. Poteet-Smith C.E. Xu Y. Errington T.M. Hecht S.M. Lannigan D.A. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 1027-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), obliterated the increase in kinase activity due to either PKARIα silencing or EGF treatment (Fig. 1B). These data show that the in vitro kinase activities in the RSK1 IPs are indeed due to RSK1 and not one or more other associated kinases. Additionally, these data demonstrate that, under basal conditions, PKARIα attenuates the activation of RSK1 and that the site-specific anti-phospho-RSK antibodies faithfully reflect the activation state of the immunoprecipitated RSK1. The silencing of PKARIα did not alter the amount of either PKAc (Fig. 1B, top left panel) or PKARII, which is not expressed in B82L cells (supplemental Fig. S1B). To check for specificity, the activation of RSK isoforms (RSK2 and RSK3) that do not interact with PKA subunits (15.Chaturvedi D. Poppleton H.M. Stringfield T. Barbier A. Patel T.B. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 4586-4600Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) was examined. Silencing of PKARIα did not alter activation of either RSK2 or RSK3 (Fig. 1C) demonstrating that disruption of the PKARIα/RSK1 interactions specifically increased activation of RSK1. Moreover, the silencing of PKARIα did not alter the activation state of ERK1/2, the upstream kinases that activate RSK1 (Fig. 1D). Previously we showed that the indirect (via PKA subunits) association of RSK1 with AKAPs is necessary for the nuclear localization of the active RSK1 (15.Chaturvedi D. Poppleton H.M. Stringfield T. Barbier A. Patel T.B. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 4586-4600Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The"
https://openalex.org/W2161914516,"The specificity of the stress-produced antimicrobial peptide cateslytin to fungi membranes has been investigated using complex membrane models made of zwitterionic and negatively charged lipids, cholesterol, or ergosterol. Noninvasive solid-state NMR of deuterated neutral and negatively charged lipids, together with IR spectroscopy, afforded following both changes in membrane fluidity and in peptide secondary structure. Cateslytin, by adopting an aggregated antiparallel β-sheeted structure at membrane interfaces, induces a fluid/rigid membrane separation on ergosterol-containing models only. This effect is accounted for by a 2-fold electronic interaction: attractive dipole-dipole between basic arginine residues and negatively charged lipid head groups, and attractive cation-π between arginine and the conjugated π electrons of the ergosterol fused-ring system. This complex leads to fluid/thinner membranes that laterally separate out from rigid/thicker membranes that are not bound by cateslytin. The boundary defects occurring between domains span several angstroms, as probed by NMR of perdeuterated lipids, and are proposed to trigger peptide permeation through membranes. The intrinsic greater membrane fluidity of ergosterol/acidic lipid components in fungi is shown to be one of the key factors for specific cateslytin biological action.—JeanFrancois, F., Desbat, B., Dufourc, E.

https://openalex.org/W2128025712,"Previous studies showed that cytoplasmic and mitochondrial forms of yeast valyl-tRNA synthetase (ValRS) are specified by the VAS1 gene through alternative initiation of translation. Sequence comparison suggests that the yeast cytoplasmic (or mature mitochondrial) ValRS contains an N-terminal appendage that acts in cis as a nonspecific tRNA-binding domain (TRBD) and is absent from its bacterial relatives. We show here that Escherichia coli ValRS can substitute for the mitochondrial and cytoplasmic functions of VAS1 by fusion of a mitochondrial targeting signal and a TRBD, respectively. In addition, the bacterial ValRS gene can be converted into a dual functional yeast gene encoding both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial activities by fusion of a DNA sequence specifying both the mitochondrial targeting signal and TRBD. In vitro assays suggested that fusion of a nonspecific TRBD to the bacterial enzyme significantly enhanced its yeast tRNA-binding and aminoacylation activities. These results not only underscore the necessity of retaining a TRBD for functioning of a tRNA synthetase in yeast cytoplasm, but also provide insights into the evolution of tRNA synthetase genes."
https://openalex.org/W2083514214,"PDK1 (phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1) catalyzes phosphorylation of Thr-229 in the T-loop of S6K1αII (the 70-kDa 40 S ribosomal protein S6 kinase-1 αII isoform), and Thr-229 phosphorylation is synergistic with C-terminal Thr-389 phosphorylation to activate S6K1αII regulatory functions in protein translation preinitiation complexes. Unlike its common AGC kinase subfamily member S6K1αII, PDK1 does not contain the synergistic C-terminal phosphorylation site, and it has been proposed that phosphorylated Thr-389 in S6K1αII may initially serve to trans-activate PDK1-catalyzed Thr-229 phosphorylation. Herein, we report direct binding and kinetic studies that showed PDK1 to exhibit nearly equal binding affinities and steady-state kinetic turnover numbers toward native (KdS6K1 = 1.2 μm and kcat = 1.1 s−1) and the phosphomimicking T389E mutant S6K1αII (KdS6K1 = 1.5 μm and kcat = 1.2 s−1), although ∼2-fold enhanced specificity was displayed for the T389E mutant (kcat/KmS6K1 = 0.08 μm−1 s−1 compared with 0.04 μm−1 s−1). Considering that transient kinetic binding studies showed all nucleotide and S6K1αII substrates and products to rapidly associate with PDK1 (kon = 1–6 μm−1 s−1), it was concluded that positioning a negative charge at residue Thr-389 reduced ∼2-fold the occurrence of nonproductive binding events that precede formation of a reactive ternary complex for Thr-229 phosphorylation. In addition, steady-state kinetic data were most simply accommodated by an Ordered Bi Bi mechanism with competitive substrate inhibition, where (i) the initially formed PDK1-ATP complex phosphorylates the nucleotide-free form of the S6K1αII kinase and (ii) initial binding of S6K1αII precludes ATP binding to PDK1.

Among these kinases, amino acid sequences are conserved in a segment of the kinase domain known as the activation loop or T-loop as well as in a short segment immediately C-terminal to the kinase domain known as the hydrophobic motif, and phosphorylation sites or acidic residues in these regions play important roles in their catalytic regulation and/or stability. Whereas a single isoform of PDK1 is produced from a single gene, two S6K1 isoforms are produced from a single gene by alternative mRNA splicing and the use of an alternative translational start site (2Grove J.R. Banerjee P. Balasubramanyam A. Coffer P.J. Price D.J. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1991; 11: 5541-5550Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The 525-residue S6K1αI isoform contains an N-terminal 23-residue segment that encodes a polybasic nuclear localization motif, whereas the cytoplasmic αII isoform starts at a Met residue equivalent to Met-24 in the αI isoform, and the sequences of both isoforms are identical thereafter.With combined knowledge from available amino acid sequence alignments and x-ray structures, molecular modeling and biochemical testing now provide strong evidence for a common AGC kinase activation mechanism in which the C-terminal phosphorylated hydrophobic motif interacts with a phosphate binding pocket located in the small N-lobe of the kinase (3Frödin M.

This intramolecular interaction acts synergistically with T-loop phosphorylation to stabilize the active conformation, where a critical Glu residue in the αC-helix forms an ion pair with the catalytic Lys that functions to position the terminal phosphate of ATP for phosphotransfer in the kinase reaction. For the S6K1αI isoform, the phosphorylated residues in the T-loop and hydrophobic motif correspond to Thr-252 and Thr-412, respectively (4Alessi D.R. Kozlowski M.T. Weng Q.P. Morrice N. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 69-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), whereas in the S6K1αII isoform, the identical residues correspond to Thr-229 and Thr-389 (5Pullen N.

Similar to these and other AGC kinases, PDK1 contains a phosphate binding pocket located in the small N-lobe of the kinase (22Biondi R.M. Cheung P.C. Casamayor A. Deak M. Currie R.A. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 979-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 23Biondi R.M. Komander D. Thomas C.C. Lizcano J.M. Deak M. Alessi D.R. van Aalten D.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4219-4228Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). However, PDK1 does not possess a phosphorylated hydrophobic motif C-terminal to its catalytic domain. Given that the catalytically active kinase domain of PDK1 uniquely requires only T-loop (Ser-241) phosphorylation (24Casamayor A. Morrice N.A. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), this raises the question of how it achieves catalytic competency to phosphorylate its protein targets.The common ability of PDK1 to phosphorylate its numerous AGC kinase targets has been explained from the intriguing perspective that PDK1 has the ability to “sense the conformation” of many of its substrates (25Biondi R.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 136-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Here, it has been proposed that the phosphate binding pocket located in the small N-lobe of PDK1 is accessible for interaction with the phosphorylated hydrophobic motifs of its AGC kinase targets. Such docking-based recognition of the AGC kinase target would also serve to trans-activate PDK1-catalyzed T-loop phosphorylation of that target. Subsequently, the phosphorylated C-terminal hydrophobic motif of the target kinase would be released from PDK1 to form an intramolecular interaction with its N-lobe pocket, stabilizing its own active conformation (25Biondi R.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 136-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Both in vivo and in vitro studies indicated the important role of intermolecular interactions in activating PDK1-catalyzed phosphorylation of S6K1, the 90-kDa 40 S ribosomal protein S6 kinase, and serum- and glucocorticoid-induced protein kinase (3Frödin M.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2924-2934Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar).With regard to S6K1, an emerging view is that that phosphorylation of Thr-389 in its C-terminal hydrophobic motif is critical to facilitate PDK1-catalyzed Thr-229 phosphorylation of S6K1 (25Biondi R.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 136-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Primary support for this model was derived from surface plasmon resonance steady-state binding studies, which showed (i) PDK1 to bind the phosphomimic T389E mutant S6K1 catalytic kinase domain with a Kd of ∼8 μm and (ii) PDK1 to bind the native S6K1 catalytic kinase domain with poor affinity (28Balendran A. Currie R. Armstrong C.G. Avruch J. Alessi D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37400-37406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In the latter case, it was not possible to accurately measure Kd due to poor data quality. In addition, it was later inferred from Western analyses that PDK1 in vitro phosphorylated Thr-229 of the native S6K1 kinase domain ∼10-fold less efficiently than its T389E mutant (26Biondi R.M. Kieloch A. Currie R.A. Deak M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4380-4390Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Although x-ray structural and mutagenesis studies have clearly defined phosphate binding pocket residues important to PDK1 reactivity (22Biondi R.M. Cheung P.C. Casamayor A. Deak M. Currie R.A. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 979-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 23Biondi R.M. Komander D. Thomas C.C. Lizcano J.M. Deak M. Alessi D.R. van Aalten D.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4219-4228Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), a detailed kinetic study of this process awaits description.In this paper, we first report generation and characterization of homogeneous preparations of catalytic domain constructs of (i) the Ser-241-monophosphorylated active form of the PDK1 enzyme (His6-PDK1(ΔPH), 2The abbreviations used are: His6-PDK1(ΔPH)N-terminal His6 affinity-tagged recombinant catalytic domain (residues 51–359) of PDK1 with deletion of C-terminal pleckstrin homology domain residues 360–556His6-S6K1αII(ΔAID)N-terminal His6 affinity-tagged recombinant catalytic domain of the αII isoform of S6K1 with deletion of C-terminal autoinhibitory domain residues 399–502Mant-ATPfluorescently labeled N-methylanthraniloyl-adenosine triphosphateESI-TOFelectrospray ionization-time of flight mass spectrometryPIFPDK1-interacting fragmenttamra-PIFN-terminal fluorescently labeled peptide, 5-carboxytetramethylrhodamine-EPRILSEEEQEMFRDFDYIADWCMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidAIDautoinhibitory domain. 2The abbreviations used are: His6-PDK1(ΔPH)N-terminal His6 affinity-tagged recombinant catalytic domain (residues 51–359) of PDK1 with deletion of C-terminal pleckstrin homology domain residues 360–556His6-S6K1αII(ΔAID)N-terminal His6 affinity-tagged recombinant catalytic domain of the αII isoform of S6K1 with deletion of C-terminal autoinhibitory domain residues 399–502Mant-ATPfluorescently labeled N-methylanthraniloyl-adenosine triphosphateESI-TOFelectrospray ionization-time of flight mass spectrometryPIFPDK1-interacting fragmenttamra-PIFN-terminal fluorescently labeled peptide, 5-carboxytetramethylrhodamine-EPRILSEEEQEMFRDFDYIADWCMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidAIDautoinhibitory domain. residues 51–359) and (ii) the unphosphorylated inactive forms of both the native and T389E mutant S6K1αII substrate (His6-S6K1αII(ΔAID), residues 1–398). These constructs were used in a suite of direct binding and kinetic studies aimed to (i) quantify the effect that Thr-389 phosphorylation might provide in activating His6-PDK1(ΔPH)-catalyzed Thr-229 phosphorylation of His6-S6K1αII(ΔAID) and (ii) identify the reaction step in which activation takes place. Although kinetic studies were complicated by substrate-substrate (S6K1-ATP) interactions that resulted in a fair degree of apparent substrate inhibition, a number of surprising new insights became clear. Most important, we found that (i) His6-PDK1(ΔPH) only phosphorylated His6-S6K1αII(ΔAID) that was free of bound nucleotide and (ii) that positioning negative charge at residue Thr-389 increased ∼2-fold the probability of achieving a productively bound ternary complex that leads to Thr-229 phosphorylation.DISCUSSIONThe initial aim of this study was to characterize the extent to which His6-PDK1(ΔPH)-catalyzed Thr-229 phosphorylation of His6-S6K1αII(ΔAID) was enhanced by the phosphomimicking T389E mutation in the conserved C-terminal hydrophobic motif of S6K1αII. From a number of previous accounts (25Biondi R.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 136-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 26Biondi R.M. Kieloch A. Currie R.A.

Chem. 1999; 274: 37400-37406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), it seemed rather clear that the recombinant His6-PDK1(ΔPH) catalytic domain construct would exhibit at least a 10-fold higher affinity and reactivity toward the T389E mutant over the native His6-S6K1αII(ΔAID). But to our surprise, we found that native and T389E mutant His6-S6K1αII(ΔAID) formed nearly equal high affinity complexes with PDK1 and underwent Thr-229 phosphorylation with nearly equal propensity.We believe that the previously reported apparent inability of native His6-S6K1αII(ΔAID) to bind and undergo Thr-229 phosphorylation by His6-PDK1(ΔPH) (25Biondi R.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 136-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 26Biondi R.M. Kieloch A. Currie R.A. Deak M. Alessi D.R.

To a much lesser degree, this was observed for T389E mutant His6-S6K1αII(ΔAID) (Fig. 1C, lane 2). Fortunately, both native and T389E His6-S6K1αII(ΔAID) could be dissociated from such complexes by heparin-Sepharose chromatography, and the resulting purified constructs remained soluble and functionally stable at the concentrations required for binding and kinetic studies, albeit no higher than 25 °C.Given the clear indication of the phosphate binding pocket in the x-ray structure of PDK1(ΔPH) (23Biondi R.M. Komander D. Thomas C.C. Lizcano J.M. Deak M. Alessi D.R. van Aalten D.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4219-4228Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), as well as its proposed activating role inferred from molecular modeling studies (3Frödin M. Antal T.L. Dümmler B.A. Jensen C.J. Deak M. Gammeltoft S. Biondi R.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5396-5407Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), we remained open to the possibility that the T389E mutation retained an ability to bind and activate Thr-229 chemical phosphorylation. In this case, the observed nearly equal steady-state turnover of native and T389E His6-S6K1αII(ΔAID) might simply be a consequence of equal rates of subsequent release of products. Thus, characterization of the substrate and product binding steps ensued. As demonstrated in Table 1, His6-PDK1(ΔPH) exhibited nearly equal affinities as well as nearly equal microscopic association and dissociation rate constants for binary complex formation with the substrate and product forms of native and T389E His6-S6K1αII(ΔAID). Since we have yet to devise effective assays for measuring binding events leading to formation of the ternary complex, kinetic methods were next employed to identify internal reaction steps sensitive to the T389E perturbation.Since the purified Thr-229 unphosphorylated native and T389E His6-S6K1αII(ΔAID) constructs retained abilities to bind ATP, we devised two approaches for steady-state kinetic characterization of His6-PDK1(ΔPH)-catalyzed Thr-229 phosphorylation of His6-S6K1αII(ΔAID). In the first approach (supplemental Figs. S1 and S2), titrations of one substrate were carried out at different fixed total concentrations of the other substrate. In this way, it was possible to demonstrate the relative ability of a given substrate in a substrate-substrate interaction to bind and react with PDK1 enzyme. As expected, depletion of ATP upon titrating with His6-S6K1αII(ΔAID) resulted in the predicted amount of apparent substrate inhibition. But remarkably unexpected was the observation that ATP binding to His6-S6K1αII(ΔAID) precluded reactivity with PDK1 enzyme. This was confirmed by the second approach of calculating and adjusting total concentrations of the nontitrated substrate so as to maintain a fixed free concentration, which indeed yielded hyperbolic plots (Fig. 6).In final consideration, steady-state kinetic characterization of T389E mutant His6-S6K1αII(ΔAID) revealed some degree of true substrate inhibition, which raised suspicions that His6-S6K1αII(ΔAID) binding to PDK1 enzyme precludes ATP binding. Regardless of by which mechanism the kinetic data were analyzed, His6-PDK1(ΔPH) exhibited a ∼2-fold enhanced specificity for the T389E mutant compared with native His6-S6K1αII(ΔAID), which derived predominantly from effects on substrate Km values. Since the substrate Km values were elevated 10–20-fold over their Kd values and approached the S6K1-ATP Kd values, it was not possible to achieve sufficient enzyme saturation levels required for pre-steady-state kinetic detection of (i) chemical phosphorylation and/or (ii) a possible rate-limiting step thereafter.As the name implies, the rapid equilibrium Random Bi Bi mechanism is interpreted with respect to only the enzyme-substrate equilibrium binding affinities and overall turnover number, kcat (Scheme 1). But as elaborated in the supplemental material, King-Altman derivation and the rules of Cleland yielded explicit expressions for the measured steady-state kinetic constants in the Ordered Bi Bi mechanism with competitive substrate inhibition (Scheme 2), which are defined by (Eq. 16), (Eq. 17), (Eq. 18), (Eq. 19), (Eq. 20). kcat=k+3k+4k+5k+3k+4+k+3k+5+k+4k+5(Eq. 16) KdA=k−1k+1(Eq. 17) KmB=kcat(KdBk+3+1k+2)(Eq. 18) KmA=kcatk+1(1+k−1KdBk+3KiB+k−1k+2KiB)(Eq. 19) KBB=kcatk+1KiB(Eq. 20) In these equations, KdB = k−2/k+2, and KiB = k−6/k+6; and the expressions derived for kcat (Equation 16), KdA (Equation 17), and KmB (Equation 18) are identical to those derived for the standard Ordered Bi Bi mechanism (Scheme 2; steps 1–5). With regard to the expression of KmA (Equation 19), the terms in parentheses are additional terms that distinguish the expression for KmA in the Ordered Bi Bi mechanism with competitive substrate inhibition from the standard Ordered Bi Bi mechanism (KmA = kcat/k+1). In final consideration, Equation 10 contains the one additional coefficient × concentration term, KBBBf2, and the unitless coefficient is defined by Equation 20.With such equations in hand, it is possible to further pinpoint the reaction step for which Thr-389 phosphorylation might provide advantage (Fig. 8). Since the measured kcat values for the reactions with native and T389E mutant His6-S6K1αII(ΔAID) were approximately equal, the activating effect does not reside in reaction steps comprising chemical phosphorylation (k+3) and subsequent release of products (k+4, k+5) (Equation 16). Further noting (i) that ATP binding (k+1, k−1) is common to both reactions and (ii) that inhibitory binary complexes of His6-PDK1(ΔPH) with the native and T389E mutant His6-S6K1αII(ΔAID) were nearly equal (k+6, k−6), the activating effect must reside completely in the ability to form the reactive ternary complex (k+2, k−2) (Fig. 8).Since the product dissociation rate constant of ADP (k+5 = 17 s−1) exceeded kcat by ∼17-fold, the rate-limiting step can be either chemical phosphorylation (k+3) or release of Thr(P)-229 His6-S6K1αII(ΔAID) (k+4). In the case that chemistry is rate-limiting (k+3 ≈ kcat), the expressions for KmB (Equation 18) and KmA (Equation 19) each converge to KdB (= k−2/k+2). In the case that fast chemistry precedes rate-limiting product release (k+3 ≫ kcat; k+4 ≈ kcat), the expressions for KmB (Equation 18) and KmA (Equation 19) each converge to kcat/k+2. In either case, the KmA and KmB values are predicted to be nearly equal, and this is what made it difficult to discern from the rapid equilibrium Random Bi Bi mechanism. Since KdA ≈ KdB, negative binding synergism results in αKdA ≈ αKdB.Regardless of whether the ∼2-fold activating effect on Km values by the T389E mutation occurs in either rapid equilibrium (k+3 ≈ kcat) or steady-state (k+3 ≫ kcat), both imply that binding of the second substrate occurs many times before chemistry takes place. For example, the specificity constant values (Table 2, kcat/Km ≈ 0.04 μm−1 s−1 for native and kcat/Km ≈ 0.08 μm−1 s−1 for T389E) were ∼100- and ∼50-fold lower than the microscopic association rate constants measured for binary complex formation of His6-PDK1(ΔPH) with either ATP or His6-S6K1αII(ΔAID) (Table 1) (kon = 4–5 μm−1 s−1). The fractional amount by which the specificity constant values were decreased may be considered to approximate the fractional amount of times that nonproductive binding events preclude reactive chemistry from occurring. Thus, we conclude overall that positioning a negative charge at residue Thr-389 minimizes nonproductive binding events and thereby increases the probability of achieving a productively bound ternary complex that leads to Thr-229 phosphorylation of His6-S6K1αII(ΔAID) (Fig. 8).The Ordered Bi Bi mechanism with competitive substrate inhibition (SCHEME 2, FIGURE 8) must only be regarded as the simplest mechanism that accommodates the in vitro binding and kinetic data for the isolated catalytic kinase domains of PDK1 and S6K1. Accordingly, the observation of dual substrate inhibition by both ATP and His6-S6K1αII(ΔAID) may yet be a consequence of more elaborate forms of Scheme 2. For example, an additional inhibited complex may form between the nucleotide-bound forms of both His6-PDK1(ΔPH) and His6-S6K1αII(ΔAID) (i.e. EA + BA ↔ EABA). Here, ATP binding to His6-S6K1αII(ΔAID) might either (i) simply alter accessibility of Thr-229 in the S6K1 T-loop or (ii) induce more diffuse structural changes in the overall catalytic complex. Less likely, a fair number of inhibited complexes could potentially exist in which ATP binds secondary sites on either His6-PDK1(ΔPH) or His6-S6K1αII(ΔAID).To the extent that the in vitro studies showed a requirement for the nucleotide-free form of His6-S6K1αII(ΔAID) to be Thr-229-phosphorylated, it certainly appears to put constraints on the in vivo activity of PDK1, especially given the high levels of ATP/ADP in the cell. As such, a number of scenarios may be envisioned. For example, it has been shown that the C-terminal autoinhibitory domain of S6K1αII (AID; residues 399–502) suppresses catalytic activation by blocking the upstream kinase-mediated Thr-229 and Thr-389 phosphorylation events (4Alessi D.R.

We surmise that the C-terminal phosphorylated AID in full-length S6K1 may serve to either (i) abrogate nucleotide binding to S6K1 or (ii) correctly position Thr-229 for phosphorylation in a nucleotide-bound form of S6K1. The current formulation of the in vitro binding and kinetic data for the isolated catalytic kinase domains of PDK1 and S6K1 (SCHEME 2, FIGURE 8) now provides an essential framework on which to test and more clearly understand how AID phosphorylation might promote the Thr-389 and Thr-229 activating phosphorylations of the S6K1 kinase domain.In other precautionary notes, the T389E mutation activated Thr(P)-229-monophosphorylated His6-S6K1αII(ΔAID) ∼20-fold (Fig. 2D, lanes 2 and 4), indicating that the single negative charge (Glu) mimicked to some degree the intramolecular activating effect of Thr(P)-389. In contrast, the T389E mutation provided only ∼2-fold intermolecular activation of His6-PDK1(ΔPH)-catalyzed Thr-229 phosphorylation of His6-S6K1αII(ΔAID). Since we have yet to generate Thr(P)-389-monophosphorylated His6-S6K1αII(ΔAID) due to technical issues, we cannot rule out the possibility that the T389E mutant may not be an adequate Thr(P)-389 mimic. In any case, it is clear that pinpointing the reaction step where S6K1 productively binds to PDK1-ATP provides a new focus for future studies aimed to understand the Thr-229 specificity of this reaction as well as PDK1 specifici"

https://openalex.org/W2090553032,"Ultrasensitivity, hysteresis (a form of biochemical memory), and all-or-none (digital) responses are important signaling properties for the control of irreversible processes and are well characterized in the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) system using Xenopus oocytes. Our aim was to study these properties in the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling system under stress conditions that could engage a cell death program, and compare them to the JNK responses. After characterization of Xenopus AMPK, we show here that the response to antimycin (nonapoptotic) was slightly cooperative and graded (analog) in individual oocytes, whereas the response to sorbitol (which induced cytochrome c release and caspase activation) was ultrasensitive, digital in single cells, and without hysteresis, hallmarks of a monostable system. Moreover, initial graded responses of AMPK and JNK turned into digital during a critical period for the execution of the cell death program, although single cell analysis did not show complete correlation between AMPK or JNK activation and cytochrome c release. We propose a model where the life or death decision in the cell is made by integration of multiple digital signals from stress sensors."
https://openalex.org/W2076267516,"Background The fundamental role of the light receptor rhodopsin in visual function and photoreceptor cell development has been widely studied. Proper trafficking of rhodopsin to the photoreceptor membrane is of great importance. In human, mutations in rhodopsin involving its intracellular mislocalization, are the most frequent cause of autosomal dominant Retinitis Pigmentosa, a degenerative retinal pathology characterized by progressive blindness. Drosophila is widely used as an animal model in visual and retinal degeneration research. So far, little is known about the requirements for proper rhodopsin targeting in Drosophila. Methodology/Principal Findings Different truncated fly-rhodopsin Rh1 variants were expressed in the eyes of Drosophila and their localization was analyzed in vivo or by immunofluorescence. A mutant lacking the last 23 amino acids was found to properly localize in the rhabdomeres, the light-sensing organelle of the photoreceptor cells. This constitutes a major difference to trafficking in vertebrates, which involves a conserved QVxPA motif at the very C-terminus. Further truncations of Rh1 indicated that proper localization requires the last amino acid residues of a region called helix 8 following directly the last transmembrane domain. Interestingly, the very C-terminus of invertebrate visual rhodopsins is extremely variable but helix 8 shows conserved amino acid residues that are not conserved in vertebrate homologs. Conclusions/Significance Despite impressive similarities in the folding and photoactivation of vertebrate and invertebrate visual rhodopsins, a striking difference exists between mammalian and fly rhodopsins in their requirements for proper targeting. Most importantly, the distal part of helix 8 plays a central role in invertebrates. Since the last amino acid residues of helix 8 are dispensable for rhodopsin folding and function, we propose that this domain participates in the recognition of targeting factors involved in transport to the rhabdomeres."
