https://openalex.org/W1983069685,"The use of molecular self-assembly to fabricate microstructures suitable for advanced material development is described. Templating techniques that transform biomolecular self-assemblies into rugged and stable nano- and microstructures are described. By using a lipid-based microcylinder (tubule) as a paradigm, the path followed from research and development to emerging technological applications is detailed. This process includes modification of the lipid molecular structure, the formation and subsequent characterization of cylindrical microstructures, the use of these structures as templates for metallization, and the characterization and assessment of these hollow metal microcylinders for several potential applications."

In most instances, the aromatic rings of the phenyl propane structural units are parallel to the plane of the cell-wall surface."
https://openalex.org/W2033143300,"Terrestrial biological diversity is supported by solar energy captured by plants growing in soil. This soil-based plant productivity also provides the foundation for human societies through production of food and renewable forms of energy. Variations in plant productivity, resulting from differences in inherent soil fertility, variations in climate and weather, and differences in chemical inputs and agricultural practices, produce patterns of biological diversity that are associated with the agricultural component of economic productivity. Ecological processes lead to a generally negative relation between the diversity of plant species and potential agricultural productivity at both local and global scales. One implication of this negative relation is that preservation of areas of high plant biodiversity does not require the sacrifice of productive agricultural lands."

From these data, kriging maps of arsenic, cadmium, and fluoride were generated. Results, based on actual concentrations of contaminants in bee tissues, show that the greatest concentrations of contaminants occur close to Commencement Bay and that honey bees are effective as large-scale monitors."
https://openalex.org/W2007669679,"Anisotropy of the inner core of the Earth is proposed to result from the lattice preferred orientation of anisotropic iron crystals during their solidification in the presence of a magnetic field. The resultant seismic anisotropy is related to the geometry of the magnetic field in the core. This hypothesis implies that the observed anisotropy (fast velocity along the rotation axis) indicates a strong toroidal field in the core, which supports a strong field model for the geodynamo if the inner core is made of hexagonal close-packed iron."
https://openalex.org/W2053784433,"Chlorine atoms strongly chemisorbed at dangling bond sites on the Si(100)-(2 × 1) surface are observed by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) to hop between adjacent sites. The origin of this behavior is suggested to be an interaction between the field of the probe tip and the dipole moment of the silicon—chlorine bond. Chlorine atom migration is shown to be facilitated by the presence of a metastable chlorine bridge—bonded minimum. The STM probe was used to excite single chlorine atoms into this bridging configuration, resulting in a local population inversion. Selective application of voltage pulses between the probe tip and the surface rearranged the local bonding and induced transformations between different types of chlorine sites. In this manner, adsorbed species can be dissected and their composition and structure directly probed."
https://openalex.org/W2126196437,"Attorneys of California Rural Legal Assistance are suing the University of California on behalf of 19 farm workers, alleging that publicly funded mechanization research displaces farm workers, eliminates small farmers, hurts consumers, impairs the quality of rural life, and impedes collective bargaining. This article reviews the evidence and finds that it does not support the charges. The mechanization lawsuit is important because applied research by universities is often authorized by legislation stipulating multiple goals, leaving researchers and universities vulnerable to lawsuits alleging that only some of the legislative goals are being pursued."
https://openalex.org/W1994584374,"A specific association with the cyanobacterium Anabaena oscillarioides was established by positive bacterial (pseudomonad) chemotaxis to Anabaena oscillarioides heterocysts. This association enhanced nitrogen fixation in A. oscillarioides, and positive chemotaxis was particularly strong during periods of active nitrogen fixation. Addition of compounds known to elicit positive chemotaxis in pseudomonads interfered with the establishment of the association, while removal of these compounds led to reestablishment of the association. Anabaena oscillarioides excretion products, some of which are exuded from heterocyst-vegetative cell junctions, are likely to be responsible for positive chemotactic responses. Chemotaxis-controlled associations such as this one explain in part why aquatic bacterial-algal and bacterial-particle associations occur sporadically and are heterogeneously distributed in time and space."
https://openalex.org/W2094146004,A process for producing patterned metal deposits on fluoropolymeric substrates is described. A metal ion-chelating organosilane is chemisorbed by self-assembly onto a fluoropolymer surface after radio-frequency glow discharge plasma surface hydroxylation. Positional modulation of the surface hydrophobicity is illustrated by wetting. The silane covalently binds an aqueous palladium catalyst and subsequent electroless deposition yields homogeneous or patterned metal deposits that exhibit excellent adhesion to the fluoropolymer.

It addresses a variety of applications of supercomputers and the characteristics of a large modern supercomputing facility, the radical changes in the design of supercomputers that are impending, and the conditions that are necessary for a conducive climate for the further development and application of supercomputers."
https://openalex.org/W1987906240,"On 9 April 1984, commercial airlines enroute from Tokyo, Japan, to Anchorage, Alaska, reported an unusual mushroom-shaped cloud at about 38.5 degrees N, 146.0 degrees E. On 8 and 9 April the intensity of volcanism from Kaitoku Seamount (26.0 degrees N, 140.8 degrees E), as indicated by T-phase recordings on an array of ocean bottom hydrophones, reached a maximum level and then declined rapidly. An examination was made of the possible relation of the cloud to eruptions of Kaitoku through an analysis of pilot depositions, satellite photos, wind charts, signal strengths and spectra of known man-made underwater explosions, as well as ascent rates of volcanic plumes and cumulonimbus clouds."

https://openalex.org/W4213153069,"Two statements in the article ""Heart panel's conclusions questioned"" by Gina Kolata (Research News, 4 Jan., p. 40) were not accurate. The first, in the third paragraph on page 40, should have read, ""But these trials failed to show that cholesterol-lowering saves lives,"" instead of, ""But these trials failed to show that cholesterol-lowering prevents deaths from heart disease."" A second statement, in the ninth paragraph on page 41, should have read, ""The incidences of angina, bypass surgery, and abnormal exercise electrocardiograms all came down in the cholestyramine group. All but bypass surgery were statistically significant."""

https://openalex.org/W1969353642,Early in March 1610 Galileo was preoccupied with curious brightness variations of the newly discovered satellites of Jupiter. In formulating an incorrect explanation he advanced important generalizations about the existence of planetary atmospheres and counterclockwise circulation within the solar system.
