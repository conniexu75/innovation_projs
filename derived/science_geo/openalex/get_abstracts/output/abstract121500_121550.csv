https://openalex.org/W1888783223,"Studies on mice deficient in nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) subunits have shown that this transcription factor is important for lymphocyte responses to antigens and cytokine-inducible gene expression. In particular, the RelA (p65) subunit is required for induction of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-dependent genes. Treatment of RelA-deficient (RelA−/−) mouse fibroblasts and macrophages with TNF-α resulted in a significant reduction in viability, whereas RelA+/+ cells were unaffected. Cytotoxicity to both cell types was mediated by TNF receptor 1. Reintroduction of RelA into RelA−/− fibroblasts resulted in enhanced survival, demonstrating that the presence of RelA is required for protection from TNF-α. These results have implications for the treatment of inflammatory and proliferative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2082575834,"Many cells are resistant to stimuli that can induce apoptosis, but the mechanisms involved are not fully understood. The activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) by tumor necrosis factor (TNF), ionizing radiation, or daunorubicin (a cancer chemotherapeutic compound), was found to protect from cell killing. Inhibition of NF-kappaB nuclear translocation enhanced apoptotic killing by these reagents but not by apoptotic stimuli that do not activate NF-kappaB. These results provide a mechanism of cellular resistance to killing by some apoptotic reagents, offer insight into a new role for NF-kappaB, and have potential for improvement of the efficacy of cancer therapies."
https://openalex.org/W1492606093,"Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) signaling gives rise to a number of events, including activation of transcription factor NF-kappaB and programmed cell death (apoptosis). Previous studies of TNF-alpha signaling have suggested that these two events occur independently. The sensitivity and kinetics of TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis are shown to be enhanced in a number of cell types expressing a dominant-negative IkappaBalpha (IkappaBalphaM). These findings suggest that a negative feedback mechanism results from TNF-alpha signaling in which NF-kappaB activation suppresses the signals for cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2076092946,"The relative organization of genes and repetitive DNAs in complex eukaryotic genomes is not well understood. Diagnostic sequencing indicated that a 280-kilobase region containing the maize Adh1-F and u22 genes is composed primarily of retrotransposons inserted within each other. Ten retroelement families were discovered, with reiteration frequencies ranging from 10 to 30,000 copies per haploid genome. These retrotransposons accounted for more than 60 percent of the Adh1-F region and at least 50 percent of the nuclear DNA of maize. These elements were largely intact and are dispersed throughout the gene-containing regions of the maize genome."
https://openalex.org/W2019742616,"Conformational changes are thought to underlie the activation of heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein (G protein)-coupled receptors. Such changes in rhodopsin were explored by construction of double cysteine mutants, each containing one cysteine at the cytoplasmic end of helix C and one cysteine at various positions in the cytoplasmic end of helix F. Magnetic dipolar interactions between spin labels attached to these residues revealed their proximity, and changes in their interaction upon rhodopsin light activation suggested a rigid body movement of helices relative to one another. Disulfide cross-linking of the helices prevented activation of transducin, which suggests the importance of this movement for activation of rhodopsin."
https://openalex.org/W2076152999,"The existence of a dominant massive planet, Jupiter, in our solar system, although perhaps essential for long-term dynamical stability and the development of life, may not be typical of planetary systems that form around other stars. In a system containing two Jupiter-like planets, the possibility exists that a dynamical instability will develop. Computer simulations suggest that in many cases this instability leads to the ejection of one planet while the other is left in a smaller, eccentric orbit. In extreme cases, the eccentric orbit has a small enough periastron distance that it may circularize at an orbital period as short as a few days through tidal dissipation. This may explain the recently detected Jupiter-mass planets in very tight circular orbits and wider eccentric orbits around nearby stars."
https://openalex.org/W2069960839,"Two switchable, mesoscopically periodic materials were created by combining crystalline colloidal array (CCA) self-assembly with the temperature-induced volume phase transition of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM). Body-centered-cubic CCAs of hydrated, swollen PNIPAM particles Bragg-diffract infrared, visible, and ultraviolet light weakly, whereas arrays of compact shrunken particles diffract efficiently. A tunable diffracting array was also created by embedding a CCA of polystyrene spheres within a PNIPAM hydrogel that swells and contracts with temperature; thus the array lattice constant varies with temperature, and the diffracted wavelength was thermally tunable across the entire visible spectrum. These materials may find applications in many areas of optics and materials science."
https://openalex.org/W2116537286,"The crystal structure of the human DNA polymerase delta processivity factor PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) complexed with a 22 residue peptide derived from the C-terminus of the cell-cycle checkpoint protein p21(WAF1/CIP1) has been determined at 2.6 angstrom resolution. p21 binds to PCNA in a 1:1 stoichiometry with an extensive array of interactions that include the formation of a beta sheet with the interdomain connector loop of PCNA. An intact trimeric ring is maintained in the structure of the p21-PCNA complex, with a central hole available for DNA interaction. The ability of p21 to inhibit the action of PCNA is therefore likely to be due to its masking of elements on PCNA that are required for the binding of other components of the polymerase assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2091937293,"An estimated 1% of the global human population is infected by hepatitis C viruses (HCVs), and there are no broadly effective treatments for the debilitating progression of chronic hepatitis C. A serine protease located within the HCV NS3 protein processes the viral polyprotein at four specific sites and is considered essential for replication. Thus, it emerges as an attractive target for drug design. We report here the 2.5 angstrom resolution X-ray crystal structure of the NS3 protease domain complexed with a synthetic NS4A activator peptide. The protease has a chymotrypsin-like fold and features a tetrahedrally coordinated metal ion distal to the active site. The NS4A peptide intercalates within a beta sheet of the enzyme core."
https://openalex.org/W2090217559,"Drosophila Enabled is required for proper formation of axonal structures and is genetically implicated in signaling pathways mediated by Drosophila Abl. We have identified two murine proteins, Mena and Evl, that are highly related to Enabled as well as VASP (Vasodilator-Stimulated Phosphoprotein). A conserved domain targets Mena to localized proteins containing a specific proline-rich motif. The association of Mena with the surface of the intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes and the G-actin binding protein profilin suggests that this molecule may participate in bacterial movement by facilitating actin polymerization. Expression of neural-enriched isoforms of Mena in fibroblasts induces the formation of abnormal F-actin-rich outgrowths, supporting a role for this protein in microfilament assembly and cell motility."
https://openalex.org/W2008228521,Interferon consensus sequence binding protein (ICSBP) is a transcription factor of the interferon (IFN) regulatory factor (IRF) family. Mice with a null mutation of ICSBP exhibit two prominent phenotypes related to previously described activities of the IRF family. The first is enhanced susceptibility to virus infections associated with impaired production of IFN(gamma). The second is deregulated hematopoiesis in both ICSBP-/- and ICSBP+/- mice that manifests as a syndrome similar to human chronic myelogenous leukemia. The chronic period of the disease progresses to a fatal blast crisis characterized by a clonal expansion of undifferentiated cells. Normal mice injected with cells from mice in blast crisis developed acute leukemia within 6 weeks of transfer. These results suggest a novel role for ICSBP in regulating the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells.
https://openalex.org/W1995871393,"Tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 (TNFR-1) and CD95 (also called Fas or APO-1) are cytokine receptors that engage the apoptosis pathway through a region of intracellular homology, designated the ""death domain."" Another death domain-containing member of the TNFR family, death receptor 3 (DR3), was identified and was shown to induce both apoptosis and activation of nuclear factor kappaB. Expression of DR3 appears to be restricted to tissues enriched in lymphocytes. DR3 signal transduction is mediated by a complex of intracellular signaling molecules including TRADD, TRAF2, FADD, and FLICE. Thus, DR3 likely plays a role in regulating lymphocyte homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2000043453,"Although cytokinin plays a central role in plant development, little is known about cytokinin signal transduction. Five Arabidopsis thaliana mutants that exhibit typical cytokinin responses, including rapid cell division and shoot formation in tissue culture in the absence of exogenous cytokinin, were isolated by activation transferred DNA tagging. A gene, CKI1, which was tagged in four of the five mutants and induced typical cytokinin responses after introduction and overexpression in plants, was cloned. CKI1 encodes a protein similar to the two-component regulators. These results suggest that CKI1 is involved in cytokinin signal transduction, possibly as a cytokinin receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2065608903,"Tracking human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1) infection at the cellular level in tissue reservoirs provides opportunities to better understand the pathogenesis of infection and to rationally design and monitor therapy. A quantitative technique was developed to determine viral burden in two important cellular compartments in lymphoid tissues. Image analysis and in situ hybridization were combined to show that in the presymptomatic stages of infection there is a large, relatively stable pool of virions on the surfaces of follicular dendritic cells and a smaller pool of productively infected cells. Despite evidence of constraints on HIV-1 replication in the infected cell population in lymphoid tissues, estimates of the numbers of these cells and the virus they could produce are consistent with the quantities of virus that have been detected in the bloodstream. The cellular sources of virus production and storage in lymphoid tissues can now be studied with this approach over the course of infection and treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2031130044,"Whole-cell recordings from optic tectal neurons in Xenopus tadpoles were used to study the maturation of a glutamatergic synapse. The first glutamatergic transmission is mediated only by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and is silent at resting potentials. More mature synapses acquire transmission by alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptors. This maturational program is mimicked by postsynaptic expression of constitutively active calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). Newly formed synapses may be silent unless sufficient depolarization is provided by coincident activity that could activate postsynaptic CaMKII, resulting in the appearance of AMPA responses."
https://openalex.org/W1996486759,"CD22 is a surface glycoprotein of B lymphocytes that is rapidly phosphorylated on cytoplasmic tyrosines after antigen receptor cross-linking. Splenic B cells from mice with a disrupted CD22 gene were found to be hyperresponsive to receptor signaling: Heightened calcium fluxes and cell proliferation were obtained at lower ligand concentrations. The mice gave an augmented immune response, had an expanded peritoneal B-1 cell population, and contained increased serum titers of autoantibody. Thus, CD22 is a negative regulator of antigen receptor signaling whose onset of expression at the mature B cell stage may serve to raise the antigen concentration threshold required for B cell triggering."
https://openalex.org/W2057065474,"During replication of hepatitis C virus (HCV), the final steps of polyprotein processing are performed by a viral proteinase located in the N-terminal one-third of nonstructural protein 3. The structure of NS3 proteinase from HCV BK strain was determined by X-ray crystallography at 2.4 Å resolution. NS3P folds as a trypsin-like proteinase with two β barrels and a catalytic triad of His-57, Asp-81, Ser-139. The structure has a substrate-binding site consistent with the cleavage specificity of the enzyme. Novel features include a structural zinc-binding site and a long N-terminus that interacts with neighboring molecules by binding to a hydrophobic surface patch."
https://openalex.org/W2093640201,"The mammalian thalamus is the gateway to the cortex for most sensory modalities. Nearly all thalamic nuclei also receive massive feedback projections from the cortical region to which they project. In this study, the spatiotemporal properties of synchronized thalamic spindle oscillations (7 to 14 hertz) were investigated in barbiturate-anesthetized cats, before and after removal of the cortex. After complete ipsilateral decortication, the long-range synchronization of thalamic spindles in the intact cortex hemisphere changed into disorganized patterns with low spatiotemporal coherence. Local thalamic synchrony was still present, as demonstrated by dual intracellular recordings from nearby neurons. In the cortex, synchrony was insensitive to the disruption of horizontal intracortical connections. These results indicate that the global coherence of thalamic oscillations is determined by corticothalamic projections."
https://openalex.org/W2089623038,"Mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor are among the most frequently observed genetic alterations in human cancer and map to the 200-amino acid core domain of the protein. The core domain contains the sequence-specific DNA binding activity and the in vitro 53BP2 protein binding activity of p53. The crystal structure of the p53 core domain bound to the 53BP2 protein, which contains an SH3 (Src homology 3) domain and four ankyrin repeats, revealed that (i) the SH3 domain binds the L3 loop of p53 in a manner distinct from that of previously characterized SH3-polyproline peptide complexes, and (ii) an ankyrin repeat, which forms an L-shaped structure consisting of a beta hairpin and two alpha helices, binds the L2 loop of p53. The structure of the complex shows that the 53BP2 binding site on the p53 core domain consists of evolutionarily conserved regions that are frequently mutated in cancer and that it overlaps the site of DNA binding. The six most frequently observed p53 mutations disrupt 53BP2 binding in vitro. The structure provides evidence that the 53BP2-p53 complex forms in vivo and may have a critical role in the p53 pathway of tumor suppression."
https://openalex.org/W1971063170,"Granulocyte [polymorphonuclear leucocyte (PMN)] migration to sites of infection and subsequent activation is essential for host defense. Gene-targeted mice deficient for integrin-associated protein (IAP, also termed CD47) succumbed to Escherichia coli peritonitis at inoccula survived by heterozygous littermates. In vivo, they had an early defect in PMN accumulation at the site of infection. In vitro, IAP-/- PMNs were deficient in beta3 integrin-dependent ligand binding, activation of an oxidative burst, and Fc receptor-mediated phagocytosis. Thus, IAP plays a key role in host defense by participating both in PMN migration in response to bacterial infection and in PMN activation at extravascular sites."
https://openalex.org/W2120533372,"The neurotransmitter functions of nitric oxide are dependent on dynamic regulation of its biosynthetic enzyme, neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). By means of a yeast two-hybrid screen, a 10-kilodalton protein was identified that physically interacts with and inhibits the activity of nNOS. This inhibitor, designated PIN, appears to be one of the most conserved proteins in nature, showing 92 percent amino acid identity with the nematode and rat homologs. Binding of PIN destabilizes the nNOS dimer, a conformation necessary for activity. These results suggest that PIN may regulate numerous biological processes through its effects on nitric oxide synthase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2016808992,"Signals from CD4+ T cells induce two opposite fates in B cells: clonal proliferation of B cells that bind specifically to foreign antigens and clonal deletion of equivalent B cells that bind self-antigens. This B cell fate decision is determined by the concerted action of two surface proteins on activated T cells, CD40- and Fas-ligands (CD40L and FasL), whose effects are switched by signals from the B cell antigen receptor (BCR). Foreign antigens that stimulate the BCR acutely cause CD40L and FasL to promote clonal proliferation. CD40L and FasL trigger deletion, however, when the BCRs become desensitized by chronic stimulation with self-antigens or when BCRs have not bound an antigen. The need for both Fas and CD40L to correctly regulate self-reactive B cell fate may explain the severe autoantibody disorders in Fas- or CD40L-deficient children."
https://openalex.org/W2043835505,"Photoperiodic responses, such as the daylength-dependent control of reproductive development, are associated with a circadian biological clock. The photoperiod-insensitive early-flowering 3 (elf3) mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana lacks rhythmicity in two distinct circadian-regulated processes. This defect was apparent only when plants were assayed under constant light conditions. elf3 mutants retain rhythmicity in constant dark and anticipate light/dark transitions under most light/dark regimes. The conditional arrhythmic phenotype suggests that the circadian pacemaker is intact in darkness in elf3 mutant plants, but the transduction of light signals to the circadian clock is impaired."
https://openalex.org/W2054762986,"Lipid A constitutes the outer monolayer of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and is essential for bacterial growth. Synthetic antibacterials were identified that inhibit the second enzyme (a unique deacetylase) of lipid A biosynthesis. The inhibitors are chiral hydroxamic acids bearing certain hydrophobic aromatic moieties. They may bind to a metal in the active site of the deacetylase. The most potent analog (with an inhibition constant of about 50 nM) displayed a minimal inhibitory concentration of about 1 microgram per milliliter against Escherichia coli, caused three logs of bacterial killing in 4 hours, and cured mice infected with a lethal intraperitoneal dose of E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W2142955330,"Chaperonin-assisted protein folding proceeds through cycles of ATP binding and hydrolysis by the large chaperonin GroEL, which undergoes major allosteric rearrangements. Interaction between the two back-to-back seven-membered rings of GroEL plays an important role in regulating binding and release of folding substrates and of the small chaperonin GroES. Using cryo-electron microscopy, we have obtained three-dimensional reconstructions to 30 Å resolution for GroEL and GroEL–GroES complexes in the presence of ADP, ATP, and the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, AMP-PNP. Nucleotide binding to the equatorial domains of GroEL causes large rotations of the apical domains, containing the GroES and substrate protein–binding sites. We propose a mechanism for allosteric switching and describe conformational changes that may be involved in critical steps of folding for substrates encapsulated by GroES."
https://openalex.org/W2064140853,"The outermost layer of the human placenta is devoid of classical class I human leukocyte antigens (HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C) and class II proteins (HLA-DR, HLA-DQ, and HLA-DP). Although this prevents recognition by maternal T lymphocytes, the lack of class I molecules leaves these cells susceptible to attack by natural killer (NK) cells. However, trophoblast cells directly in contact with the maternal tissues express the class I molecule HLA-G, which may be involved in protecting the trophoblast from recognition by NK cells. Here evidence is provided that expression of HLA-G is sufficient to protect otherwise susceptible target cells from lysis by activated NK1 and NK2 cell lines and clones that are specific for distinct groups of HLA-C alleles. The receptors on NK cells that recognize HLA-G are also identified."
https://openalex.org/W2042050610,"Individual fluorescent molecules and individual singly labeled proteins were observed in the water-filled pores of poly(acrylamide) gels by far-field microscopy. Brownian motion was markedly reduced by the gel framework, thus enabling extended study of single fluorophores in aqueous environments. A highly axially dependent laser field was used both to excite the fluorophores and to image the molecules in three dimensions. Single molecules were followed as they moved within and through the porous gel structure. In contrast to dry polymeric hosts, these water-based gels may form a useful medium for single-molecule studies of biological systems in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2012107116,"Stimulus-evoked oscillatory synchronization of neural assemblies and temporal patterns of neuronal activity have been observed in many sensory systems, such as the visual and auditory cortices of mammals or the olfactory system of insects. In the locust olfactory system, single odor puffs cause the immediate formation of odor-specific neural assemblies, defined both by their transient synchronized firing and their progressive transformation over the course of a response. The application of an antagonist of ionotropic gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors to the first olfactory relay neuropil selectively blocked the fast inhibitory synapse between local and projection neurons. This manipulation abolished the synchronization of the odor-coding neural ensembles but did not affect each neuron's temporal response patterns to odors, even when these patterns contained periods of inhibition. Fast GABA-mediated inhibition, therefore, appears to underlie neuronal synchronization but not response tuning in this olfactory system. The selective desynchronization of stimulus-evoked oscillating neural assemblies in vivo is now possible, enabling direct functional tests of their significance for sensation and perception."
https://openalex.org/W2090521014,"The magnesium-to-calcium (Mg/Ca) ratio of coral skeletons from Ishigaki Island, Ryukyu Islands, Japan, closely tracked sea surface temperature (SST) over an 8-year period. Measurements were made with the fast technique of inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry. The variation of the coral Mg/Ca ratio with SST change is about four times that of the current, widely used coral strontium-to-calcium ratio. The temporal and geographic variation of the seawater Mg2+/Ca2+ ratio probably has little influence on coral Mg/Ca variation. Results indicate that the coral Mg/Ca ratio has the potential to provide fast, precise, high-resolution proxies for past tropical SSTs."
https://openalex.org/W2042181517,"Listeria monocytogenes is a bacterial pathogen that invades cultured nonphagocytic cells. Inhibitors and a dominant negative mutation were used to demonstrate that efficient entry requires the phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinase p85alpha-p110. Infection with L. monocytogenes caused rapid increases in cellular amounts of PI(3, 4)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3, indicating that invading bacteria stimulated PI 3-kinase activity. This stimulation required the bacterial protein InlB, host cell tyrosine phosphorylation, and association of p85alpha with one or more tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. This role for PI 3-kinase in bacterial entry may have parallels in some endocytic events."
https://openalex.org/W2072470725,"Paleoclimate records indicate that the strength of the Asian summer monsoon is sensitive to orbital forcing at the obliquity and precession periods (41,000 and 23,000 years, respectively) and the extent of Northern Hemisphere glaciation. Over the past 2.6 million years, the timing (phase) of strong monsoons has changed by ∼83 degrees in the precession and ∼124 degrees in the obliquity bands relative to the phase of maximum global ice volume (inferred from the marine oxygen isotope record). These results suggest that one or both of these systems is nonstationary relative to orbital forcing."
https://openalex.org/W2036961716,"Variable-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy was used to study the effect of kinetic cluster energy and rare-gas buffer layers on the deposition process of size-selected silver nanoclusters on a platinum(111) surface. Clusters with impact energies of </=1 electron volt per atom could be landed nondestructively on the bare substrate, whereas at higher kinetic energies fragmentation and substrate damage were observed. Clusters with elevated impact energy could be soft-landed via an argon buffer layer on the platinum substrate, which efficiently dissipated the kinetic energy. Nondestructive cluster deposition represents a promising method to produce monodispersed nanostructures at surfaces."
https://openalex.org/W2029774675,"Oligomerization by the formation of alpha-helical bundles is common in many proteins. The crystal structure of a parallel pentameric coiled coil, constituting the oligomerization domain in the cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), was determined at 2.05 angstroms resolution. The same structure probably occurs in two other extracellular matrix proteins, thrombospondins 3 and 4. Complementary hydrophobic interactions and conserved disulfide bridges between the alpha helices result in a thermostable structure with unusual properties. The long hydrophobic axial pore is filled with water molecules but can also accommodate small apolar groups. An ""ion trap"" is formed inside the pore by a ring of conserved glutamines, which binds chloride and probably other monatomic anions. The oligomerization domain of COMP has marked similarities with proposed models of the pentameric transmembrane ion channels in phospholamban and the acetylcholine receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2059007127,"Variable queen mating frequencies provide a unique opportunity to study the resolution of worker-queen conflict over sex ratio in social Hymenoptera, because the conflict is maximal in colonies headed by a singly mated queen and is weak or nonexistent in colonies headed by a multiply mated queen. In the wood ant Formica exsecta, workers in colonies with a singly mated queen, but not those in colonies with a multiply mated queen, altered the sex ratio of queen-laid eggs by eliminating males to preferentially raise queens. By this conditional response to queen mating frequency, workers enhance their inclusive fitness."
https://openalex.org/W2161533283,"The origin recognition complex (ORC) binds to origins of replication in budding yeast. We have cloned a Xenopus homolog of the largest ORC polypeptide (XORC1). Immunodepletion of XOrc1 from Xenopus egg extracts blocks the initiation of DNA replication. We have purified Xenopus ORC, consisting of a protein complex similar to yeast ORC. In Xenopus egg extracts, ORC associates with chromatin throughout G1 and S phases. RLF-M, a component of the replication licensing system, also associates with chromatin early in the cell cycle but dissociates during S phase. We show that the assembly of RLF-M onto chromatin is dependent on the presence of chromatin-bound ORC, leading to sequential assembly of initiation proteins onto replication origins during the cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2151068726,"After the first division of the C. elegans embryo, the posterior blastomere can produce numerous muscles while the anterior blastomere cannot. We show here that maternal-effect lethal mutations in the gene mex-3 cause descendants of the anterior blastomere to produce muscles by a pattern of development similar to that of a descendant of the wild-type posterior blastomere. mex-3 encodes a probable RNA-binding protein that is distributed unequally in early embryos and that is a component of germline-specific granules called P granules. We propose that MEX-3 contributes to anterior-posterior asymmetry by regulating one or more mRNAs involved in specifying the fate of the posterior blastomere."
https://openalex.org/W2018240474,"Maternal hypertension is a common complication of pregnancy and its pathophysiology is poorly understood. This phenomenon was studied in an animal model by mating transgenic mice expressing components of the human renin-angiotensin system. When transgenic females expressing angiotensinogen were mated with transgenic males expressing renin, the pregnant females displayed a transient elevation of blood pressure in late pregnancy, due to secretion of placental human renin into the maternal circulation. Blood pressure returned to normal levels after delivery of the pups. Histopathologic examination revealed uniform enlargement of glomeruli associated with an increase in urinary protein excretion, myocardial hypertrophy, and necrosis and edema in the placenta. These mice may provide molecular insights into pregnancy-associated hypertension in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2067022774,"The V(D)J recombinase subunits Rag-1 and Rag-2 mediate assembly of antigen receptor gene segments. We studied the mechanisms of DNA recognition by Rag-1/Rag-2 using surface plasmon resonance. The critical step for signal recognition is binding of Rag-1 to the nonamer. This is achieved by a region of Rag-1 homologous to the DNA-binding domain of the Hin family of bacterial invertases and to homeodomain proteins. Strikingly, the Hin homeodomain can functionally substitute for the Rag-1 homologous region. Rag-1 also interacts with the heptamer but with low affinity. Rag-2 shows no direct binding to DNA. Once the Rag-1/Rag-2 complex is engaged on the DNA, subsequent cleavage is directed by the heptamer sequence. This order of events remarkably parallels mechanisms that mediate transposition in bacteria and nematodes."
https://openalex.org/W2051649888,"The early asymmetric cleavages of Caenorhabditis elegans embryos produce blastomeres with distinct developmental potentials. Here, we show that the caudal-like homeodomain protein PAL-1 is required to specify the somatic identity of one posterior blastomere in the 4 cell embryo. We find that pal-1 activity is sequentially restricted to this blastomere. First, at the 4 cell stage, it is translated only in the two posterior blastomeres. Then, its function is restricted to one of these blastomeres. This second targeting step is dependent on the activities of the posteriorly localized SKN-1 and asymmetrically segregated PIE-1 proteins. We propose that the segregation of PIE-1, combined with the temporal decay of SKN-1, targets pal-1 activity to this posterior lineage, thus coupling the regulation of this conserved posterior patterning gene to asymmetric cell cleavages."
https://openalex.org/W2131554214,"Recent studies have demonstrated that DNA cleavage during V(D)J recombination is mediated by the RAG1 and RAG2 proteins. These proteins must therefore bind to the recombination signals, but the specific binding interaction has been difficult to study in vitro. Here, we use an in vivo one-hybrid DNA binding assay to demonstrate that RAG1, in the absence of RAG2, can mediate signal recognition via the nonamer, with the heptamer acting to enhance its binding. A region of RAG1 with sequence similarity to bacterial invertases is essential for DNA binding. Localization of RAG2 to the signal is dependent upon the presence of RAG1 and is substantially more efficient with a 12 bp spacer signal than with a 23 bp spacer signal."
https://openalex.org/W2002186904,"Rearrangements of the visual pigment genes are associated with defective color vision and with differences between types of red-green color blindness. Among individuals within the most common category of defective color vision, deuteranomaly, there is a large variation in the severity of color vision loss. An examination of specific photopigment gene sites responsible for tuning photopigment absorption spectra revealed differences that predict these variations in the color defect. The results indicate that the severity of the defect in deuteranomalous color vision depends on the degree of similarity among the residual photopigments that serve vision in the color-anomalous eye."
https://openalex.org/W2012479817,"Homothallic switching of the mating-type MAT a gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae results from replacement by gene conversion of MAT-Ya DNA with Yα sequences copied from one of two unexpressed donors. MAT a preferentially recombines with HMLα, located near the left end of chromosome III, but can use HMRα, near the right chromosome end. MAT a donor preference depends on a 700 bp orientation-independent cis-acting recombination enhancer, located 17 kb proximal to HML. Deletion of this element markedly reduces MAT a's use of a donor inserted at any of four different locations along the leftmost 92 kb of chromosome III. This enhancer is sufficient for donor activation, since it stimulates use of the “wrong” donor, when it is inserted 7 kb proximal to HMR."

Splicing of the AT-AC intron 2 of a sodium channel (SCN4A) precursor messenger RNA in vitro did not require inhibition of conventional splicing and required adenosine triphosphate, magnesium, and U12 small nuclear RNA (snRNA). When exon 3 was followed by the 5′ splice site from the downstream conventional intron, splicing of intron 2 was greatly stimulated. This effect was U1 snRNA-dependent, unlike the basal AT-AC splicing reaction. Therefore, U1-mediated exon definition interactions can coordinate the activities of major and minor spliceosomes."

Applying a formalism that allows departures from radial symmetry and cylindrical anisotropy results in models with P-wave velocity distributions whose strength and pattern are incompatible with frozen-in anisotropy, but rather suggest a simple large-scale convection regime in the inner core."
https://openalex.org/W2067808931,Interfacial charge-transfer rate constants have been measured for n-type Si electrodes in contact with a series of viologen-based redox couples in methanol through analyses of the behavior of these junctions with respect to their current density versus potential and differential capacitance versus potential properties. The data allow evaluation of the maximum rate constant (and therefore the electronic coupling) for majority carriers in the solid as well as of the dependence of the rate constant on the driving force for transfer of delocalized electrons from the n-Si semiconducting electrode into the localized molecular redox species in the solution phase. The data are in good agreement with existing models of this interfacial electron transfer process and provide insight into the fundamental kinetic events underlying the use of semiconducting photoelectrodes in applications such as solar energy conversion.

At initiation, it forms a 5′-phosphotyrosyl DNA link, whereas at termination, a glutamate residue directs hydrolytic cleavage of the newly synthesized origin, and the resulting 3′-hydroxyl group undergoes transesterification with the phosphotyrosine link. The protein is thus released from DNA, and the termination is uncoupled from reinitiation of replication. Replacement of the glutamate with tyrosine in RepA altered this mechanism, so that termination occurred by two successive transesterifications and became coupled to reinitiation. This result suggests that various enzymes involved in DNA cleavage and rejoining may have similar mechanistic and evolutionary roots."
