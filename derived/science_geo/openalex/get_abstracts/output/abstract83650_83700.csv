https://openalex.org/W1972083618,"Somatomedin-C stimulates somatostatin release to a maximum of 390 percent of basal release during short-term (20-minute) incubation of rat hypothalamus. It has no effect on basal or stimulated growth hormone release from primary cultures of rat adenohypophyseal cells during a 4-hour incubation, but inhibits stimulated release by more that 90 percent after 24 hours. These findings suggest that somatomedin-C participates in the growth hormone negative feedback loop with an immediate effect on hypothalamic somatostatin and a delayed effect on the anterior pituitary."
https://openalex.org/W2042077321,"We propose a mechanism for the priming of influenza viral RNA transcription by capped RNAs in which specific 5'-terminal fragments are cleaved from the capped RNAs by a virion-associated endonuclease. These fragments would serve as the actual primers for the initiation of transcription by the initial incorporation by the initial incorporation of a G residue at their 3' end. We show that virions and purified viral cores contain a unique endonuclease that cleaves RNAs containing a 5' methylated cap structure (m7GpppXm) preferentially at purine residues 10 to 14 nucleotides from the cap, generating fragments with 3'-terminal hydroxyl groups. RNAs containing the 5'-terminal structure GpppG could not be cleaved to produce these specific fragments. Consistent with our proposed mechanism, those capped fragments that function as primers could be linked to a G residue in transcriptase reactions containing alpha-32P-GTP as the only ribonucleoside triphosphate. The pattern of G and C incorporation onto these primer fragments suggests that this incorporation is directed by the second and third bases at the 3' end of the virion RNA template, which has the sequence 3' UCG. Primer fragments with a 3'-terminal A residue were used more efficiently than those with a 3'-terminal G residue, indicating a preference for generating an AGC sequence in the viral mRNA complementary to the 3' end of the virion RNA. Cleavage of the RNA primer and initiation of transcription are not necessarily coupled, because a 5' fragment isolated from one reaction could be used as a primer when added to a second reaction. Uncapped ribopolymer inhibitors of viral RNA transcription inhibited the cleavage of capped RNAs."

https://openalex.org/W1549719435,"A sulfated glycoprotein, entactin, of apparent molecular weight 158,000 has been isolated from an extracellular basement membrane-like matrix. This matrix is elaborated in cell culture by a mouse endodermal cell line. Antibodies prepared in rabbits against this sulfated glycoprotein react with mouse and rat basement membranes from a variety of tissues. These antibodies also react in a specific manner with a discrete component of mouse and rat kidney glomeruli. The electrophoretic mobility of this component is identical to that of entactin. The mouse kidney antigen, as shown by immunoelectron microscopic studies, is predominantly localized at the surface of epithelial cells of tubules and glomeruli adjacent to the basement membrane. Some antigen is also present in the basal lamina adjacent to the epithelial cells. Entactin is distinct from the basement membrane-associated protein GP-2, a protein similar to laminin. Entactin differs from GP-2 in electrophoretic mobility, cyanogen bromide peptide fragmentation pattern, immunological cross-reactivity, and incorporation of H235SO4. Entactin is insensitive to treatment with chrondroitinase ABC. It is suggested that this molecule plays a role in the interaction of the extracellular matrix and the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W1517318768,"Adriamycin is reduced to a semiquinone-free radical by microsomal and nuclear enzymes. To investigate the effect of these radicals on DNA, an end-labeled DNA fragment of defined sequence was included in a reaction that contained NADPH, NADPH cytochrome P-450 reductase (EC 1.6.2.4), and adriamycin. Extensive DNA strand scission was observed. The breaks occurred at all nucleotides with equal probability regardless of nucleotide sequence. Single-stranded DNA was as good a substrate as double-stranded DNA for the strand scission reaction. DNA damage occurred during the early phase of the reaction. No strand breaks were observed upon addition of DNA to the reaction 60 min after enzyme activation despite the high concentration of stable free radicals present at this time. The extent of strand scission was greatly reduced when the reaction was carried out in a nitrogen atmosphere. We conclude that DNA breakage created by enzymatically derived adriamycin-free radicals is mediated by molecular oxygen, most probably by hydroxyl-free radicals and hydroxyl ions. We also conclude that the semiquinone-free radicals of adriamycin and radicals of the reduced forms of adriamycin need not intercalate into DNA to create strand breaks."
https://openalex.org/W1588201284,"The human transferrin receptor could be fluorographically detected after immunoprecipitation from a leukemic T-cell line labeled with [3H]palmitic acid. The label was found ony in association with the human transferrin receptor and not in association with two other major plasma membrane glycoproteins, demonstrating that the incorporation of radioactivity was not due to metabolism of the palmitate. Treatment of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels containing the [3H]palmitate-labeled transferrin receptor with hydroxylamine, prior to fluorography, resulted in release of a substantial fraction of the label from the molecule. In addition, at least part of the label released from immunoprecipitates of the transferrin receptor by treatment with hydroxylamine was identified as palmitohydroxamate, providing further evidence that the labeled fatty acid is covalently bound to the receptor. A proteolytic fragment (Mr = 70,000) derived from the portion of the transferrin receptor exposed on the cell surface can be obtained by trypsin digestion of intact or Nonidet P-40-solubilized cells. When cells were labeled with [3H]palmitic acid, none of the radioactivity could be detected in the tryptic fragment. Thus, the bound palmitate appears to be associated with the region of the molecule that is in close proximity to the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1532528754,"The structure of gene sequences coding for the mRNA of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) alpha-subunit was investigated by Southern blot analysis of genomic DNAs using a cloned, full length cDNA probe. While four hormones, lutropin, follitropin, thyrotropin, and choriogonadotropin, have homologous alpha-subunits, only one gene that bears hCG-alpha sequences could be detected per haploid complement. The structure of this single gonadotropin alpha-subunit gene, which contains intervening sequences, is the same in DNA from first trimester and term placentae. However polymorphism was observed for the presence of a HindIII site and of an Eco RI site in the gene's 3' flanking sequences. The organization of hCG-alpha sequences in several trophoblastic and nontrophoblastic tumor cell lines, which produce hCG subunits, was also examined. In each, the same gene copy number and structure were seen as in normal tissue. Thus, the characteristics of ectopic alpha-subunit expression in these cells seem not to be determined by DNA rearrangements."
https://openalex.org/W2059188064,"In hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells, orthodromic synaptic excitation is followed by an early hyperpolarization mediated by Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and a late non-GABA-mediated hyperpolarization that has properties consistent with an increase in potassium conductance. Depolarizations produced by iontophoretically applied glutamate are followed by hyperpolarizations that have features in accordance with an increase in potassium conductance. The hyperpolarizations are independent of chloride and resistant to tetrodotoxin but are blocked by a low-calcium, high-cobalt medium. Voltage clamping the glutamate depolarization does not reduce the subsequent hyperpolarization, indicating that the hyperpolarization results from a direct increase in calcium conductance produced by glutamate, rather than from activation of voltage-sensitive calcium channels. A single transmitter, possibly acting on one type of receptor and channel, may initiate both excitation and inhibition in the same postsynaptic cell."
https://openalex.org/W1508438346,"Conditions which result in DNA strand breakage by the rat liver DNA nicking-closing enzyme lead to the covalent attachment of the 3'-end of the broken strand to the enzyme. Treatment of this complex with pancreatic DNase leaves a residue of 17 +/- 8 nucleotide phosphates still attached to the enzyme. Subsequent nuclease P1 treatment removes all but 2 +/- 1 phosphate residues. Using nuclease P1-treated complexes which had been labeled in the DNA with 32P, the stability of the protein-DNA linkage was studied. The linkage is stable to acid, base, neutral and acidic hydroxylamine, and neutral I2. This pattern of stability rules out essentially all of the possible DNA-protein linkages except for a linkage involving a phosphodiester bond to the amino acid tyrosine. After acid hydrolysis of the 32P-labeled complexes, label was found to be associated with O4-phosphotyrosine, providing a direct demonstration that tyrosine is the amino acid to which the end of the DNA chain is attached."

From 1.5 kg of cells, 520 mg of dnaB protein were obtained in a 58% yield with a purity greater than 99%. The E. coli cells harbor a high copy-number plasmid carrying the dnaB gene and overproduce the enzyme over 200-fold. The subunit molecular weight determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis is 50,000. Based on a native Mr = 290,000 and cross-linking studies that yielded six bands, dnaB protein is judged to be a hexamer, confirming the results of Reha-Krantz, L. J., and Hurwitz, J. (1978) J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1913038587,"Human mitochondrial DNA contains two physically separate and distinct origins of DNA replication. The initiation of each strand (heavy and light) occurs at a unique site and elongation proceeds unidirectionally. Animal mitochondrial DNA is novel in that short nascent strands are maintained at one origin (D-loop) in a significant percentage of the molecules. In the case of human mitochondrial DNA, there are three distinct D-loop heavy strands differing in length at the 5' end. We report here the localization of the 5' ends of nascent daughter heavy strands originating from the D-loop region. Analyses of the map positions of 5' ends relative to known restriction endonuclease cleavage sites and 5' end nucleotides indicate that the points of initiation of D-loop synthesis and actual daughter strands are the same. In contrast, the second origin is located two-thirds of the way around the genome where light strand synthesis is presumably initiated on a single-stranded template. Mapping of 5' ends of daughter light strands at this origin relative to known restriction endonuclease cleavage sites reveals two distinct points of initiation separated by 37 nucleotides. This origin is in the same relative genomic position and shows a high degree of DNA sequence homology to that of mouse mitochondrial DNA. In both cases, the DNA region within and immediately flanking the origin of DNA replication contains five tightly clustered tRNA genes. A major portion of the pronounced DNA template secondary structure at this origin includes the known tDNA sequences."

https://openalex.org/W1550260194,"The reactions of horse heart cytochrome c with succinate-cytochrome c reductase and cytochrome oxidase were studied as a function of ionic strength using both spectrophotometric and oxygen electrode assay techniques. The kinetic parameter Vmax/Km for both reactions decreased very rapidly as the ionic strength was increased, indicating that electrostatic interactions were important to the reactions. A new semiempirical relationship for the electrostatic energy of interaction between cytochrome c and its oxidation-reduction partners was developed, in which specific complementary charge-pair interactions between lysine amino groups on cytochrome c and negatively charged carboxylate groups on the other protein are assumed to dominate the interaction. The contribution of individual cytochrome c lysine amino groups to the electrostatic interaction was estimated from the decrease in reaction rate caused by specific modification of the lysine amino groups by reagents that change the charge to 0 or -1. These estimates range from -0.9 kcal/mol for lysines immediately surrounding the heme crevice of cytochrome c to 0 kcal/mol for lysines well removed from the heme crevice region. The semiempirical relationship for the total electrostatic energy of interaction was in quantitative agreement with the experimental ionic strength dependence of the reaction rates when the parameters were based on the specific lysine modification results. The electrostatic energies of interaction between cytochrome c and its reductase and oxidase were nearly the same, providing additional evidence that the two reactions take place at similar sites on cytochrome c."

https://openalex.org/W1587481583,"In this study, we have density-labeled newly replicated DNA in hepatoma tissue culture cells and separated the newly replicated nucleoprotein from bulk material using density gradient centrifugation. These experiments indicate that only newly synthesized histones H3 and H4 deposit specifically on newly replicated DNA. Histones H2A and H2B show a partial preference and histone H1 shows no preference for deposition on new DNA. These experiments also indicate that for a whole cell cycle, the non-H1 histones remain associated with the same DNA upon which they were initially deposited. However, when that region is replicated during the next cell cycle, the histones distribute equally to both daughter strands. An increase or decrease in the level of histone modification (acetylation) induced by sodium butyrate treatment does not alter the in vivo stability of the histone-DNA interactions. Experiments which involved labeling SV40 minichromosomes with [3H]lysine confirm our observations that only newly synthesized histone H3 and H4 are selectively depend on replicated DNA."

Agarose/urea gel electrophoresis of capped RNA suggests the existence of a precursor to the small (14 S) rRNA.

The yeast RNase P enzyme cleaves Escherichia coli tRNATyr precursor to give tRNATyr containing its mature 5' end. The enzyme activity is inhibited after treatment with nucleases; this indicates the requirement of a nucleic acid component for activity. The enzyme purification was greatly facilitated by using a synthetically prepared radioactive ApApApCOH ligated to the 5'-terminal phosphate of E. coli tRNAfMet (ApApApCp-tRNA) substrate. (p denotes a [32P]phosphate group.) This substrate was cleaved by yeast RNase P to the mature tRNA and a tetranucleoside triphosphate ApApApCOH. The synthetic substrate allowed the utilization of a simple assay procedure measuring the trichloroacetic acid solubility of the ApApApC product, thus avoiding the more cumbersome gel electrophoric separation of reaction products."
https://openalex.org/W1579482312,"The general priming system of dnaB protein and primase (Arai, K., and Kornberg, A. (1979) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 76, 4308-4312) when compared with priming by RNA polymerase shows a number of striking differences. The general priming system is initiated primarily at single-stranded region(S), being active only on single-stranded DNAs (phages and homopolymers) and inhibited by single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSB). Transcripts are only 10 to 60 residues long. By contrast, RNA priming by RNA polymerase is initiated at base-paired regions that are not destabilized by SSB (Geider, K., Beck, E., and Schaller, H. (1978) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 76, 645-649) and transcripts on DNA not coated with SSB are generally longer. In general priming, ATP (or GTP) has three functions: (i) an allosteric effect on dnaB protein in which the nonhydrolyzed analogs adenosine-5'-O-(3'-thiotriphosphate) (or guanosine-5'-O-(3'-thiotriphosphate) can substitute, (ii) initiation of primer synthesis which can incorporate deoxy-, as well as ribonucleotides, and (iii) elongation of the primer, in which the beta, gamma-imido analog can replace ATP (or GTP). An allosteric effect of ATP on RNA polymerase has not been demonstrated, nor has the facile synthesis of hybrid transcripts of ribo- and deoxyribonucleotides."

https://openalex.org/W1643732676,"The vasoactive peptide angiotensin II stimulates phosphorylation of myosin light chain in 32P-labeled confluent cultures of vascular smooth muscle cells derived from rat mesenteric arteries. Myosin light chain was identified and its 32P-phosphorylation level quantitated following selective immunoprecipitation with an antiserum raised against purified human uterine smooth muscle myosin. Following exposure to 0.1 nM angiotensin II, phosphorylation of the light chain peaked at 4 min and then slowly decreased. The stimulation of light chain phosphorylation at 4 min is half-maximal at approximately 0.2 mM angiotensin II; the maximal response is approximately 210% of the unstimulated level. Basal myosin light chain phosphorylation was markedly reduced by incubation of cells with dibutyryl cyclic AMP or the calmodulin-inhibitor chlorpromazine. These data suggest that angiotensin II-mediated contraction in intact blood vessels involves phosphorylation of the myosin light chain, and that phosphorylation is inhibited by a cAMP-mediated process and may be calmodulin-dependent."

https://openalex.org/W1480026831,"Conversion of phi X174 viral, single-stranded circular DNA to the duplex replicative form (RF), previously observed with partially purified enzymes, has now been demonstrated with the participation of 12 nearly pure Escherichia coli proteins containing approximately 30 polypeptides. To complete the synthesis of a full length complementary strand, E. coli DNA polymerase I was needed to fill the short gap left by DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, and to remove the primer and replace it with DNA. Production of supercoiled RF required the further actions of E. coli DNA ligase and gyrase. Net synthesis of viral circles was obtained by coupling the formation of RF supercoils to the actions of the phi X174-encoded gene A protein and E. coli rep protein. Viral DNA circles produced from enzymatically synthesized supercoiled RF, serving as template-substrate, were indistinguishable from those produced from RF isolated from infected cells; synthetic RF and the viral circles generated from it by replication were as biologically active in transfection of spheroplasts as the forms obtained from infected cells and virions. The conversion of single-stranded circular DNA to RF is suggested here as a model for discontinuous synthesis of the lagging strand of the E. coli chromosome. The primosome, a complex of some of the replication proteins responsible for initiations of DNA chains, will be described elsewhere. Multiplication of RF supercoils, described in the succeeding paper, proceeds by a rolling-circle mechanism in which the synthesis of viral strands may have analogies to the continuous synthesis of the leading strand of the E. coli chromosome."

https://openalex.org/W1511898761,"The in vivo stability of methylated and unmethylated cytochrome c in Saccharomyces cerevisiae was studied by pulse-labeling the hemoproteins with [methyl-3H]-methionine and/or [2-14C]methionine and following the fate of these proteins under anaerobiosis and in the presence of cycloleucine. These two conditions will respectively block further cytochrome c synthesis and inhibit methylation by lowering the cellular S-adenosyl-L-methionine pool and, thus, permit an unambiguous interpretation of the data. The results showed that the rate of degradation of unmethylated cytochrome c was constant throughout the chase period, while methylated cytochrome c degradation was seen only in the later part of cold chase. At the end of the chase period (40 h), the extent of degradation of the unmethylated species was three times higher than the methylated species. This indicated that the methylation of cytochrome c has a protective effects against the intracellular proteolytic enzyme attack on itself. Furthermore, this protective effect was considerably reduced in the petite mutant, which lacks high affinity cytochrome c binding sites, functional cytochrome c reductase, and oxidase, and possesses a less integrated and organized mitochondrial membrane. These results led us to the conclusion that the mechanism of methylated cytochrome c stabilization is best explained by a higher efficacy of binding to the mitochondria."

Clones containing sequences complementary to epoxide hydratase mRNA were selected by differential colony hybridization using [32P]cDNA synthesized from immunoenriched mRNA and [32P]cDNA synthesized from nonenriched mRNA. Plasmids from four clones, which only annealed with the enriched probe, were isolated and shown to specifically hybridize with epoxide hydratase mRNA by hybrid selection-translation.

https://openalex.org/W1511167514,"The yolk sac in rats is an organ of exchanges between the mother and fetus. A vitamin D-dependent calcium-binding protein (CaBP) has been recently described in this organ. This led us to investigate the presence of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3) receptor-like proteins in the yolk sac cytosol. For this purpose we have utilized sucrose gradient centrifugation, Scatchard analysis, and DNA-cellulose chromatography. Our results show that cytosol prepared from rat yolk sacs contains a 3.3 S binding protein for 1,25-(OH)2D3. The binding is a highly specific, saturable process with high affinity(2 X 10(-10) M at 25 degrees C). The sterol-protein complex binds to DNA-cellulose. The 1,25-(OH)2D3 binding protein is present in the yolk sac from at least the 15th day until the 21st day of gestation. In contrast, such a binding protein is not found in the amnion, the other component of fetal membranes. The biochemical parameters of the 1,25-(OH)2D3 binding protein in the yolk sac are similar to those of 1,25-(OH)2D3 cytosolic receptors in vitamin D target organs. This strongly suggests that the 3.3 S protein in the yolk sac may function as a specific receptor, indicating that this organ may be a new target organ for vitamin D."

We have purified it to homogeneity from an Escherichia coli strain containing a mutant Tn3 that overproduces transposase. About a 10-fold additional increase in transposase resulted from growth into stationary phase. The initial purification was guided by the presence of a protein band with the electrophoretic mobility of the tnpA gene product. The identity of the purified protein was proven by the agreement of five NH2-terminal amino acids with the nucleotide sequence of the A gene; this, in turn, fixed the initiation codon. Transposase formed large aggregates in the absence of Mg2+ at salt concentrations of 0.1 M or less. In nonaggregating conditions, it had 1 or 2 copies of 113,000-dalton protomers. Subsequent purifications exploited the rapid and simple assay of transposase-mediated retention of labeled DNA to a nitrocellulose filter. Transposase bound tightly to single-stranded DNA but weakly to intact duplex DNA. DNA binding did not require Mg2+ and was highly salt-resistant. Binding did not require specific sequences, because poly(dT) was as good a substrate as phi X174 viral DNA.

https://openalex.org/W1578345157,"The reduction of horse heart ferricytochrome c by reduced adrenodoxin was found by stopped flow spectroscopy to follow second order kinetics with a rate constant of 7.8 X 10(6) M-1 s-1 in Tris/Cl, pH 7.5, at an ionic strength of 0.2 M, 29 degrees C. The temperature dependence of the rate constant was used to determine that the activation parameters were delta H++++ = 7.7 kcal/mol and delta S = -1.5 cal/mol degrees K. The rate constant decreased rapidly with increasing ionic strength, indicating that electrostatic interactions between the two proteins were important to the reaction. The contribution of individual lysine amino groups to the electrostatic interaction was determined by measuring the reaction rate of specifically trifluoroacetylated or trifluoromethylphenylcarbamylated cytochrome c derivatives. Modification of lysines 13, 27, 72, and 79 surrounding the heme crevice decreased the reaction rate by about 2-fold, while modification of lysine amino groups in other regions of cytochrome c had decreasing effects as the distance from the heme crevice was increased. The interaction domain therefore involves specific complementary charge interactions between lysine amino groups immediately surrounding the heme crevice of cytochrome c and carboxylate groups on adrenodoxin. A semi-empirical relationship was developed for the total electrostatic interaction between the two proteins which is in quantitative agreement with both the ionic strength dependence of the reaction rate and the specific lysine modification studies."

https://openalex.org/W1600164836,"Abstract The adrenal gland of the mouse takes up intravenously administered 125I-labeled human low density lipoprotein (LDL) by a high affinity, receptor-mediated mechanism. Uptake is enhanced by treatment of mice with a combination of 4-aminopyrazolopyrimidine, which eliminates endogenous mouse lipoproteins from the plasma, and adrenocorticotropin, which increases the number of adrenal LDL receptors. In the current studies, we show that adrenal uptake of 125I-LDL is blocked when the mice have received a prior intravenous injection of a rabbit antibody directed against the LDL receptor purified from bovine adrenal cortex. The antibody-mediated inhibition of 125I-LDL uptake persisted for 6 h and was reversed by 19 h. Adrenal uptake of 125I-labeled high density lipoprotein was not affected by the antibody, supporting the previous suggestion that high density lipoprotein uptake by the adrenal gland is mediated by a receptor that differs from the LDL receptor. The current studies illustrate the usefulness of antibodies in probing the process of receptor-mediated endocytosis in intact animals."
https://openalex.org/W1526238502,"The biosynthesis of mammalian mitochondrial cytochromes was explored in primary hepatocyte cultures. When these were pulsed with [35S]methionine in the presence of cycloheximide, eight discrete mitochondrial polypeptides were detected by fluorography after their resolution under denaturing conditions by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Since the pulse labeling of the polypeptides was sensitive to chloramphenicol, an inhibitor of mitochondrial translation, they must be translated on mitochondrial ribosomes. Three were identified as the largest subunits of cytochrome oxidase by their immunoprecipitation with antibody directed against purified rat liver cytochrome oxidase. Another (Mr = 28,000) was identified as one of eight subunits of purified rat liver cytochrome b-c1 complex by its immunoprecipitation with antibody directed against bovine heart b-c1 complex. Since cytochrome b apoprotein is the only product of the mitochondrial genome in the yeast cytochrome b-c1 complex (Krieke, J., Bechmann, H., van Hemert, F. J., Schweyan, R. J., Boer, P. H., Kaudewitz, F., and Groot, G. S. P. (1979) Eur. J. Bio-chem. 101, 607-617), the results strongly suggest that the Mr = 28,000 subunit of liver b-c1 complex is cytochrome b apoprotein.

It is different from calmodulin isolated from other species, however, in its molecular weight (4 to 5 times greater), amino acid composition, antigenicity, and binding ability on 2-chloro-10-(3-aminopropyl)-phenothiazine affinity column chromatography. The amino acid composition, gel electrophoresis pattern, and molecular weight of this protein activator are indistinguishable from endotoxin-binding protein which we isolated previously by other independent methods. Immunologic studies demonstrate that these two proteins are essentially identical. The endotoxin-binding protein thus has the dual functions of binding endotoxin, and showing calmodulin-like activity. It may play an important role in degranulation of Limulus amoebocytes which is induced by minute amounts of gram-negative bacterial endotoxin."

https://openalex.org/W1492852500,"Radiolabeled Sendai virus was allowed to fuse with human erythrocytes and inside out vesicles were prepared from the erythrocyte membranes. Viral proteins incorporated into inside out vesicles were released from the membrane following treatment with various agents which perturb protein structure. Disruption products were analyzed by sucrose gradient centrifugation and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to identify the viral proteins. The results indicated that 6 M guanidine, 40 mM lithium diiodosalicylate (pH 11-13), and 4 M potassium thiocyanate removed viral nucleocapsid and M proteins from the vesicles. Urea (6.0 M) and 5 mM p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonate removed only viral nucleocapsid proteins. KCl (1.0 or 0.1 M), 5 or 0.5 mM sodium phosphate, 10 mM EDTA (pH 10), 10 mM lithium diiodosalicylate, 1 M urea, 0.5 mM ATP, or freeze-thaw cycles did not release any viral proteins. By contrast, treatment of inside out vesicles with Triton X-100 solubilizes the lipid bilayer, releasing viral integral membrane glycoproteins and leaving viral nucleocapsids intact. Nucleocapsids isolated from virions do not adsorb nonspecifically to control inside out vesicles. These data imply that Sendai viral nucleocapsid and M proteins interact extensively with the cytoplasmic surface of infected cell membranes, in the manner of peripheral membrane proteins, whereas the glycoproteins, HN and F1, behave as integral membrane proteins."
