https://openalex.org/W2172110387,"Mechanisms, whether man-made or morphological, are boundary conditions harnessing the laws of inanimate nature, being themselves irreducible to those laws. The pattern of organic bases in DNA which functions as a genetic code is a boundary condition irreducible to physics and chemistry. Further controlling principles of life may be represented as a hierarchy of boundary conditions extending, in the case of man, to consciousness and responsibility."

https://openalex.org/W1539181208,"Fibroblasts cultured from patients completely deficient in hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase activity were studied to determine the biochemical bases of the increased rate of purine biosynthesis de novo observed in such patients. Enzyme-deficient fibroblasts had accelerated rates of this pathway and elevated levels of 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate, although the rate of synthesis of this compound was not increased. These cells were sensitive to feedback inhibition of purine synthesis by nucleotides of adenine and 6-methylmercaptopurine ribonucleoside, but the rate of purine synthesis was increased by hypoxanthine and guanine. The concentrations of purine ribonucleotides in mutant cells were normal. The catabolism of inosinate synthesized de novo was increased in enzyme-deficient fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W1597471785,"Abstract Purine nucleoside phosphorylase (purine nucleoside: orthophosphate ribosyltransferase, EC 2.4.2.1) from human erythrocytes has been purified about 7000-fold to a specific activity of 80 µm units per mg of protein. At this state of purity, single coincident peaks of enzymatic activity and protein emerged from Sephadex G-100 columns. Use of the molecular sieve method of Andrews permitted estimation of the molecular weight at about 80,000. The enzyme is inactivated by thiol reagents such as Ellman's reagent or p-chlormercuribenzoate, and the lost activity may be partially restored by thiols such as mercaptoethanol or dithiothreitol. In addition to its phosphorolytic activity, the enzyme catalyzes a slow ribosyl transfer reaction in the absence of inorganic orthophosphate. The ratio of these activities remained relatively constant throughout purification, and it was not possible to detect any separation of these activities. Kinetic measurements with inosine and deoxyinosine as substrates revealed linear Lineweaver-Burk plots at low concentration, but downward curvatures as the concentration was increased. The results of alternative substrate studies were consistent with the hypothesis that the enzyme is multivalent with cooperative interaction between the active sites."
https://openalex.org/W1485480802,"Abstract The mechanism of reaction of human erythrocyte hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase was investigated by initial velocity, product inhibition, and isotope exchange studies. Although initial velocity data are compatible with a mechanism involving binary enzyme-substrate complexes, the product inhibition and isotope exchange studies indicate that the reaction is ordered with the formation of ternary enzyme-substrate complexes. Product and alternative product inhibition data, alternative substrate inhibition experiments, and combined alternative substrate initial velocity data are all consistent with the view that only one enzyme catalyzes this reaction of hypoxanthine and guanine, and that they share a common binding site."
https://openalex.org/W1968577300,"Hammond and Charnley1 have recently given support to the view that the femoral head is almost exactly spherical, that the surfaces of the acetabulum and femoral head are congruent so that “very perfect contact of all parts of the cartilaginous surfaces is to be expected in any position of the hip joint”. In the past, however, several observers2,3 were convinced that the surfaces of this joint are incongruent or, at best, fit one another in only one position. If the latter view is correct, contact will not be made over the entire joint and the site and size of the actual contact areas in a given joint will depend on the relative position of the joint surfaces and on the magnitude and direction of the load transmitted through it."
https://openalex.org/W1482636423,"Three times crystallized metapyrocatechase has a specific activity of about 110 µmoles per min per mg of protein at 24° and contains 1 g atom of iron per mole of enzyme, based on molecular weight of 140,000. The amino acid composition of the enzyme is presented. Metapyrocatechase is easily inactivated by various oxidizing agents, such as air or H2O2. This inactivation appears to be due to oxidation of ferrous ion to the ferric form, which is then released from the enzyme protein. The enzyme thus inactivated can be fully reactivated by incubation with ferrous ion and a reducing agent under anaerobic conditions. Inactivation of the enzyme is prevented by the presence of substrate, catechol. Enzyme activity is inhibited by a variety of nitrogen-containing aromatic compounds, including o-phenanthroline, α,α′-dipyridyl, m-phenanthroline, α-naphthoquinoline, quinoline, and pyridine. Inhibition by these agents is shown to be competitive with respect to the substrate, catechol. On the other hand, these compounds protect the enzyme from inactivation by oxidizing agents, and prevent reactivation of inactivated enzyme. Organic solvents, such as acetone or ethanol, also protect the enzyme from inactivation, and inhibit the enzyme activity nearly competitively with respect to catechol. Metapyrocatechase contains 4 free sulfhydryl groups per mole of enzyme out of 12 total half-cystine residues. When the 4 free sulfhydryl groups are titrated by p-chloromercuribenzoate, no loss of enzymatic activity is observed. However, the enzyme is inactivated by an excess amount of sulfhydryl inhibitors only when they are incubated with the enzyme prior to assay. This inactivation is also counteracted by the presence of substrate, nitrogen bases, or organic solvents. The role of ferrous ion and sulfhydryl groups in the action of metapyrocatechase is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1584430091,"The complete amino acid sequence of spinach ferredoxin was determined by analyses of tryptic, chymotryptic, and thermolytic digests of various derivatives of the protein. There are 97 amino acid residues in the molecule. These include 19 different amino acids. Methionine is not a member of the major sequence, but it is suggested that another species of ferredoxin, containing methionine, might exist. Spinach ferredoxin has 5 cysteine residues, 3 of which are near the center of the molecule. The distribution of the cystein residues in spinach ferredoxin differs from that in nonphotosynthetic bacterial ferredoxins, and this suggested some distinctive features in the mechanisms of electron transfer and in the molecular surroundings of iron atoms. Spinach ferredoxin contains a region similar to the known bacterial ferredoxins, extending over a distance of 19 consecutive amino acid residues. This suggests a common archetype for plant and bacterial ferredoxins. An internal repetition of 9 residues occurs in the molecule of spinach ferredoxin."
https://openalex.org/W1628859900,"Abstract Purified purine nucleoside phosphorylase (purine riboside: orthophosphate ribosyltransferase, EC 2.4.2.1) from human erythrocytes has been subjected to a kinetic analysis, including initial velocity and product inhibition studies. No evidence was seen for a ping-pong, or shuttle, mechanism, which indicates that a ribosylated or phosphorylated enzyme is not an obligatory intermediate in the reaction mechanism. The results of the kinetic analysis are consistent with the predominant mechanism being an ordered Bi-Bi reaction, with the nucleoside the first substrate to add to, and the purine base the last product to leave, the enzyme surface. The binding of isotopically labeled substrates to the enzyme has been examined. No evidence was obtained to indicate the formation of a ribosylated enzyme or the formation of a tight complex of orthophosphate or of ribose 1-phosphate with the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1498785618,"Abstract The long standing question of the source of methylglyoxal formed in glycolyzing tissues was considered. Nonbiological studies, made with chemical model systems, made evident that the formation of methylglyoxal from dihydroxyacetone and from dl-glyceraldehyde under physiological conditions of pH and temperature is catalyzed by Tris and by certain polyvalent anions including phytate, phosphate, tetraborate, arsenate, arsenite, cacodylate, α,β-glycerophosphate, glucose 6-phosphate, fructose 6-phosphate, and fructose 1,6-diphosphate. Borate and bicarbonate also catalyze the reaction at higher pH values. Methylglyoxal does not accumulate in the presence of other inorganic polyvalent anions, adenosine triphosphate, pyrophosphate, amino acids, polyvalent organic acids, monovalent anions or cations, polyvalent cations, or bovine albumin. The reaction between trioses and phosphate appears to follow second order kinetics. The second order rate constant, k2, is estimated to be 1.2 x 10-3 mm-1 hr-1 for dihydroxyacetone, and 6 x 10-4 mm-1 hr-1 for glyceraldehyde. The half-life period of the reaction between triose and phosphate ion may be estimated from the equation, t½ = ln2/k2[A], where [A] is the phosphate concentration (mm). The results are considered to be a possible explanation of many published observations of the appearance of methylglyoxal in glycolyzing tissues. The potential for methylglyoxal formation in biological tissues and in certain buffer systems possibly has wide ranging metabolic implications."
https://openalex.org/W1561483275,"Abstract A purified preparation of clostridial ethanolamine deaminase was shown to be homogeneous by sedimentation in the ultracentrifuge and by disc gel electrophoresis. The enzyme has an s20,w of 14.5 S and a weight average molecular weight of 520,000 g. Treatment with 5 m guanidine hydrochloride results in dissociation of subunits with a weight average molecular weight of 51,000 g. Amino acid analysis of native and performic acid-oxidized deaminase indicated the presence of 3 moles of half-cystine residues per minimum molecular weight of 28,700 g. Titration with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) yielded only 1 mole of free sulfhydryl group per mole of native enzyme (520,000 g) but in the presence of sodium lauryl sulfate 15 sulfhydryl groups per molecule were titratable. The spectrum of the enzyme contains a prominent peak at 470 mµ, with other peaks at 357, 410, and 530 mµ. The chromophore was resolved from the enzyme by treatment with acid-ammonium sulfate. On resolution, the 470 mµ peak of the enzyme disappeared and the dissociated chromophore had a spectrum similar to that of hydroxocobalamin and related cobamides. The chromophore was identified as an α-(adenylyl)cobamide by paper chromatography and paper electrophoresis. Between 1.35 and 3.1 moles of cobamide were found per mole of native enzyme. On resolution, the specific activity of the deaminase, when tested in the presence of added cobamide coenzyme, increased an average of 38%. Hydroxocobalamin, cyanocobalamin, and methylcobalamin were shown to be irreversible inhibitors of ethanolamine deaminase. Incubation of resolved enzyme with varying amounts of hydroxocobalamin resulted in complete inhibition of the enzyme after the binding of 2 to 3 moles of cobamide per mole of enzyme. The enzyme was able to bind about 7 moles of hydroxocobalamin per mole. In both the presence and absence of ethanolamine, incubation of the enzyme resulted in the slow appearance of a spectral peak at 352 mµ. Oxidation and Schmidt degradation of acetaldehyde produced by the enzymatic deamination of 1-14C-ethanolamine hydrochloride showed that the aldehyde carbon of the acetaldehyde is derived from the carbinol carbon of ethanolamine."

https://openalex.org/W1551874167,Abstract Partially methylated polycytidylic acids were used as templates in an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase reaction with enzyme isolated from Micrococcus lysodeikticus. The presence of methylated cytidylic acid residues in the template led to the formation of a copolymer of uridylic and guanylic acids. The composition of this product copolymer was dependent on the extent of methylation of the polycytidylic acid template.

https://openalex.org/W1501419106,"Abstract The dependence of Micrococcus lysodeikticus RNA polymerase on divalent cations was studied in vitro with the use of synthetic polynucleotides as templates. It was found that the various combinations of manganese or magnesium cofactors with polyuridylic, polycytidylic, and polyadenylic acid templates had characteristic activity profiles for the chain initiation and elongation steps. To distinguish between the initiation of chain synthesis and its elongation, appropriate pentanucleotides were added to bypass the rate-limiting chain initiation reaction. In the copying of polycytidylic acid, the divalent cation requirement was independent of substrate concentration. The synthesis of polyadenylate and polyuridylate, however, evinced sharp metal ion optima at levels approximately equimolar with the total ligand concentration (i.e. nucleoside triphosphate plus other chelating species). Whereas manganese stimulated chain initiation and elongation in all functioning polymer systems, magnesium ion exhibited great selectivity in the initiation step. Thus, Mg2+ failed to promote the initiation of polyadenylic and polyuridylic acid synthesis, but still stimulated the elongation of the corresponding exogenous pentanucleotide chains. Polyguanylic acid was the only homopolymer the synthesis of which was initiated by Mg2+. The relevance of this model system to the problem of the initiation of RNA synthesis in vivo is discussed."

The amino acid acceptor activity of three species of transfer RNA and the ribosomal binding of one species of transfer RNA were determined for these modified transfer RNAs. The data indicate that the reductive cleavage of the dihydrouridine residues in these transfer RNAs has no effect upon their ability to accept amino acids or to bind to ribosomes.

The optimal pH was 6.5. Cytidine, deoxycytidine, and 1-β-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine were deaminated, and the respective Km values were 7.53 x 10-5, 7.25 x 10-5, and 1.01 x 10-3. Divalent metals were not required for activity. Inhibition by p-chloromercuribenzoate indicated participation of sulfhydryl groups."
https://openalex.org/W1493693486,"Abstract We have developed a comparatively simple and inexpensive apparatus that can be applied to the rapid determination of pH from 0.003 sec onward. This has been achieved by a combination of (a) a standard pH meter, (b), a driving-mixing arrangement of the Hartridge-Roughton type, and (c) a specially designed glass microelectrode. The glass electrode (2-mm diameter, 120-mm length) has a pH-sensitive tip about 0.5 mm long and has a resistance of 150 megohms at 20°. About 25 ml of reagents are needed for one observation. No significant physical effects (e.g. streaming potentials) have been observed. Thus a precision of ±0.005 pH unit is possible, which is essential for many biochemical studies. To test the performance of this apparatus we have studied the kinetics of dehydration of carbonic acid. The velocity constant for this reaction has been found to be 25.5 and 72.00 sec-1, respectively, at 25° and 37°."

Optical rotatory dispersion and circular dichroism of PPL suggest a protein core lacking any secondary structure.
https://openalex.org/W1542379554,"Abstract The P/2e- ratio of noncyclic photophosphorylation was investigated in the light of recent reports that it is greater than one and may reflect the existence of two types of electron transport, a phosphorylating and a nonphosphorylating type, superimposed on each other. Our results, obtained under experimental conditions that included those reported to be conducive to high ratios, are consistent with the operation in noncyclic photophosphorylation of only one type of electron transport which, in the presence of ADP, orthophosphate, and Mg++, leads to ATP formation with a P/2e- of 1. The reported P/2e- ratios approaching 4 when electron acceptors such as ferricyanide are added at slow rates were not confirmed."
https://openalex.org/W1575378454,"Abstract Purified cobramine B from Naja naja inhibits the accumulation of I- by thyroid and parotid slices or isolated choroid plexus. Accumulation of TcO4- and ReO4- is also inhibited. The effect has a rapid onset, is temperature-dependent, and is prevented by polyanions or antivenom, but it is reversed with great difficulty, presumably because of very firm binding to tissue. Pretreatment with neuraminidase does not influence the inhibition. The major portion of the inhibition is due to increased I- efflux from the slices. Significant increases occur at 2 µg per ml, and I- efflux is a more sensitive measure of the cobramine B effect than is I- accumulation. Cobramine B leads to K+ loss from the cell and increases the rate of equilibration of the sucrose or inulin spaces. Inhibition of I- accumulation is also produced by protamine, histones, polyarginine, polyornithine, and polylysine, but not by lysozyme or ribonuclease A. Tetralysine is ineffective, and a polylysine of average molecular weight 14,000 or greater is maximally effective. Larger polymers are not more potent. As with cobramine B, inhibition is prevented but not easily reversed by polyanions. It is postulated that cobramine B interacts with the negative surface charges of the thyroid cell."
https://openalex.org/W1555717227,"Abstract Adenylate kinase activity was measured in rat tissues by a spectrophotometric procedure in which ADP formation from ATP and AMP was coupled with pyruvate kinase, phosphoenolpyruvate, and lactate dehydrogenase to oxidation of NADH. Activity, at 135 µmoles per min per g of tissue, was extremely high in the supernatant fraction from rat liver obtained by centrifugation of 0.25 m sucrose homogenate at 100,000 x g and was much lower in the mitochondria, at 13 units per g. No activity was found in the microsomes or nuclei. Both supernatant and mitochondrial fractions were nearly as active with other nucleoside monophosphates as cosubstrates as with AMP, but were much less active with other nucleoside triphosphates than with ATP. Apparent Km values for both supernatant and mitochondrial enzymes were 0.3 mm for MgATP and 0.03 mm for AMP. A 48-hour fast increased the liver supernatant enzyme activity to 374 units per g, and this was lowered strikingly in 24 hours, to about 40 units per g, by feeding a high glucose diet. The high fasting level was lowered only slightly by feeding a high fat or a high protein diet. In fed alloxandiabetic rats, activity was about as high as in fasted normal rats, and it was lowered by insulin treatment to levels found in normal fed rats. Activities were somewhat lower in adrenalectomized rats, and the effects of fasting and glucose feeding were not as pronounced as they were in normal rats. The mitochondrial enzyme activity remained essentially unaffected by dietary and hormonal alterations."
https://openalex.org/W1603601819,"Abstract Sangivamycin is incorporated into RNA in the reaction catalyzed by the RNA polymerase from Micrococcus lysodeikticus with the use of calf thymus DNA or the copolymer of deoxyadenosine and deoxythymidine (poly d(A-T)). The incorporation of sangivamycin 5'-triphosphate into RNA is dependent on primer, time, protein concentration, and Mn++ or Mg++. When calf thymus DNA is primer, GTP, CTP, and UTP are necessary for the incorporation of sangivamycin 5'-triphosphate into RNA. In similar experiments when sangivamycin 5'-triphosphate is the only nucleotide in the assay mixture, little or no homopolymer is formed. However, an acid-insoluble product forms when ATP is added. When poly d(A-T) is the primer, UTP is necessary for the incorporation of sangivamycin 5'-triphosphate to form polyribonucleotide. The copolymer formed with poly d(A-T) primer consists of regularly alternating residues of sangivamycin 5'-monophosphate and UMP. Bovine spleen phosphodiesterase can hydrolyze this copolymer. These results indicate that the phosphodiester bonds between sangivamycin and the adjacent uridine residue are susceptible to phosphodiesterase. Sangivamycin 5'-monophosphate and sangivamycin 5'-diphosphate are not inhibitors of RNA polymerase, nor are these compounds incorporated into RNA. It has also been found that 3'-deoxyadenosine 5'-triphosphate inhibits the incorporation of sangivamycin 5'-triphosphate. The data show that sangivamycin 5'-triphosphate competes with ATP in the various polymerization reactions. Nitrogen atom 7 of the purine ring of ATP is not essential for binding to RNA polymerase, as evidenced by the incorporation into RNA of the nucleotide antibiotic, sangivamycin 5'-triphosphate, which has a pyrrolopyrimidine ring."

https://openalex.org/W1604017767,"Abstract The active site of α-chymotrypsin is considered to be composed of parts complementary to the parts of a small molecule natural substrate, l-ethyl N-acetyl β-phenylalaninate, in a conformation in which the β-aryl and hydrolyzing ester groups are transoid: (a) the ar site, a cavity or fold into the enzyme at which the β-aryl substituent provides the primary associative effect; (b) the am site, at or near the enzyme surface, at which the α-acylamido group associates by hydrogen bonding; (c) the h site of restricted volume into which the α-hydrogen atom or other small substituent may fit; (d) the hydrolytic site, n, at or near the enzyme surface, at which the group to be hydrolyzed must be placed if an association is to be effective. High reactivity of noncyclized substrates requires binding at am and ar which restricts rotation about Cα—Cβ and Cβ—Cphenyl (Cφ), and a fit at h, placing the group to be hydrolyzed at n. d Enantiomers hydrolyze (a) when the α substituents associate at ar, and β substituents fit at am or are absent, and (b) when the α substituent may fit at h. Effective association and hydrolysis of d enantiomers lead to absence of or inversion of stereospecificity. dl-Methyl 3,4-dihydroisocoumarin-3-carboxylate (I) [see PDF for structure] has been prepared. It is hydrolyzed rapidly by α-chymotrypsin, leading to l(+)-unhydrolyzed Ester I, and d(-)-Acid VI. The acid l(+)-VI was prepared, stereospecifically, from [see PDF for structure] l(-)-phenyllactic acid, establishing the preferred enzymic hydrolysis of d(-)-I. A convenient stereospecific synthesis of d(-)-1-keto-3-carbomethoxytetrahydroisoquinoline (II) [see PDF for structure] from d(+)-β-phenylalanine has also been developed. Kinetic parameters for hydrolysis by α-chymotrypsin are: d(-)-I, kcat = 42 sec-1, Km = 0.0007 m, kcat:Km = 6.0 x 104 m-1 sec-1; l(+)-I, kcat = 1.8 sec-1, Km = 0.028 m, kcat:Km = 64 m-1 sec-1. The cyclic ester group of d(-)-I may not utilize the am site effectively, and it is concluded that the cyclic amide group of d(-)-II also does not utilize the am site. The α-heteroatoms of d(-)-I and d(-)-II fit at h, the aryl groups at ar, leading to hydrolysis of the d enantiomers. The heterocyclic rings of d(-)-I and d(-)-II lead to high reactivity by restricting rotations at Cα—Cβ and Cβ—Cφ. This, coupled with association of the phenyl ring at ar, places the carbalkoxyl group at n. The lesser reactivity of l-cyclized substrates appears related to diminished access of the aryl group to the ar site when the cyclic amide or ester group in II and I associates or lies at am. The proposal that the carbalkoxyl group in d(-)-I and d(-)-II is more nearly equatorial in the reacting conformation is discussed and supported. The usefulness of cyclized substrates with respect to information about the ar and h sites and their limitation with respect to the am site are indicated."

https://openalex.org/W1590497702,"Abstract Several nonpolar amino acids protect aspartokinase from inactivation by the cationic detergent trimethyloctadecylammonium chloride and by heat. The active agents are l-leucine, l-phenylalanine, l-methionine, l-tryptophan, l-alanine, glycine, l-valine, and l-isoleucine. d-Amino acids and other l-amino acids are inactive. The same nonpolar l-amino acids also reverse the inhibition of aspartokinase caused by the feedback inhibitors, l-threonine and l-lysine. They differ in their specificity toward the feedback inhibitors. Amino acids of Group I (l-tryptophan, l-methionine, and l-norleucine) counteract the inhibition by l-lysine only, amino acids of Group II (l-leucine, l-valine, l-isoleucine, and l-norvaline) counteract the inhibition by l-threonine only, and those of Group III (l-phenylalanine, l-alanine, glycine, and allylglycine) counteract the inhibition by both l-lysine and l-threonine. Cooperativity is not observed between amino acids belonging to different groups in overcoming the inhibition by combinations of the feedback inhibitors or in protecting the enzyme from inactivation by trimethyloctadecylammonium chloride. Group I amino acids antagonize the ability of those of Groups II and III for overcoming the inhibition by l-threonine. Similarly, Group II amino acids counteract those of Groups I and III in overcoming the inhibition by l-lysine. Group I amino acids act cooperatively with l-threonine to inhibit aspartokinase, and those of Group II act cooperatively with l-lysine. There is no correlation between the ability of an amino acid to overcome feedback inhibition and its ability to antagonize the effects of amino acids belonging to other groups. These results can be accounted for by a model that assumes a single binding site for all nonpolar l-amino acids and different patterns of nonexclusive binding of these amino acids to the site in four allosteric states of the enzyme. Some biological implications of the effect of nonpolar l-amino acids on the feedback inhibition of aspartokinase are discussed."

Such preparations are homogeneous when examined by sedimentation, electrophoretic, and immunological techniques. The pure enzyme displays an absorption maximum at 415 mµ in neutral solutions, which is consistent with a Schiff base linkage between pyridoxal phosphate and an amino group donor on the protein. Kinetic analyses performed at pH 8.0 in phosphate buffer gave evidence only for normal Michaelis behavior, even in the absence of the allosteric activator ADP. Cooperative effects were observed between ADP and l-threonine. Assays conducted in the absence of phosphate and ADP, however, exhibited an abnormal kinetic behavior which normalized as reaction time increased. Under similar conditions, the enzyme was observed to dissociate into subunits which reaggregated when ADP or l-threonine was present. These findings suggested that the abnormal kinetics was due to a dissociation-association reaction which occurred under conditions of the enzymatic assay. ADP, threonine, and phosphate were capable of preventing the dissociation to varying extents, but only ADP was observed to have the additional effect of altering the binding of substrate to enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1529841311,"Following a brief intraportal injection of fructose-1-14C or fructose-6-14C in rats, the liver was promptly extirpated and homogenized, and glucose as well as glucose 6-phosphate was isolated. Examination of these metabolic products for the distribution of radioactivity in carbon atoms 1 and 6 showed that the patterns were dissimilar. Fructose-1-14C gave glucose labeled preponderantly in carbon 1, while the label in glucose 6-phosphate was equal in carbon atoms 1 and 6. Following fructose-6-14C injection, the glucose was labeled nearly equally in carbon atoms 1 and 6, while the glucose 6-phosphate was labeled chiefly in carbon 6. These results support the view that glucose can be formed from fructose by another pathway operating in conjunction with the currently accepted one. They further suggest that glucose 6-phosphate is not the immediate precursor of glucose in this alternate pathway."

During a taximetric study of the genus Salix, willows, I2 found it necessary to recognize three concepts of relevance, which I defined as follows: “OTU by OTU relevance” is the ratio of the number of characters used in the comparison of a given pair of OTUs (operational taxonomic units3) to the total number of characters used in the study. Characters for which information is missing in at least one of the OTUs are not used in the comparison. This is relevant in the sense of Sokal and Sneath3. “OTU relevance” is the ratio of the number of characters actually recorded in a particular OTU to the total number of characters used in the study. It is a measure of the amount of missing data in an OTU, whatever the cause. “Character relevance” is the ratio of the number of OTUs in which a real value for the character in question has been recorded to the total number of OTUs in the study."

https://openalex.org/W1550665935,"Abstract An earlier report, that synthetic vasopressin in diluent decreases hepatic lipogenesis from acetate in vitro by inhibiting the citrate-condensing enzyme, has been reinvestigated. It was found that the inhibition of lipogenesis can be attributed to isotope dilution by acetate and ethanol in the diluent. The observed decrease in citrate-condensing enzyme is attributable to a lowering of the pH of the assay medium by the diluent. A more highly concentrated vasopressin preparation had no effect upon lipogenesis."
