https://openalex.org/W3004892753,"Testosterone supplementation is commonly used for its effects on sexual function, bone health and body composition, yet its effects on disease outcomes are unknown. To better understand this, we identified genetic determinants of testosterone levels and related sex hormone traits in 425,097 UK Biobank study participants. Using 2,571 genome-wide significant associations, we demonstrate that the genetic determinants of testosterone levels are substantially different between sexes and that genetically higher testosterone is harmful for metabolic diseases in women but beneficial in men. For example, a genetically determined 1 s.d. higher testosterone increases the risks of type 2 diabetes (odds ratio (OR) = 1.37 (95% confidence interval (95% CI): 1.22–1.53)) and polycystic ovary syndrome (OR = 1.51 (95% CI: 1.33–1.72)) in women, but reduces type 2 diabetes risk in men (OR = 0.86 (95% CI: 0.76–0.98)). We also show adverse effects of higher testosterone on breast and endometrial cancers in women and prostate cancer in men. Our findings provide insights into the disease impacts of testosterone and highlight the importance of sex-specific genetic analyses. Genetic analysis of data from over 400,000 participants in the UK Biobank Study shows that circulating testosterone levels have sex-specific implications for cardiometabolic diseases and cancer outcomes."

https://openalex.org/W3004765765,"Developmental processes underlying normal tissue regeneration have been implicated in cancer, but the degree of their enactment during tumor progression and under the selective pressures of immune surveillance, remain unknown. Here we show that human primary lung adenocarcinomas are characterized by the emergence of regenerative cell types, typically seen in response to lung injury, and by striking infidelity among transcription factors specifying most alveolar and bronchial epithelial lineages. In contrast, metastases are enriched for key endoderm and lung-specifying transcription factors, SOX2 and SOX9, and recapitulate more primitive transcriptional programs spanning stem-like to regenerative pulmonary epithelial progenitor states. This developmental continuum mirrors the progressive stages of spontaneous outbreak from metastatic dormancy in a mouse model and exhibits SOX9-dependent resistance to natural killer cells. Loss of developmental stage-specific constraint in macrometastases triggered by natural killer cell depletion suggests a dynamic interplay between developmental plasticity and immune-mediated pruning during metastasis. Single-cell analysis of lung cancer progression uncovers developmental and regenerative programs co-opted by cancer cells and immune-mediated pruning during metastatic outbreak"
https://openalex.org/W3005528502,"Microbial genomes can be assembled from short-read sequencing data, but the assembly contiguity of these metagenome-assembled genomes is constrained by repeat elements. Correct assignment of genomic positions of repeats is crucial for understanding the effect of genome structure on genome function. We applied nanopore sequencing and our workflow, named Lathe, which incorporates long-read assembly and short-read error correction, to assemble closed bacterial genomes from complex microbiomes. We validated our approach with a synthetic mixture of 12 bacterial species. Seven genomes were completely assembled into single contigs and three genomes were assembled into four or fewer contigs. Next, we used our methods to analyze metagenomics data from 13 human stool samples. We assembled 20 circular genomes, including genomes of Prevotella copri and a candidate Cibiobacter sp. Despite the decreased nucleotide accuracy compared with alternative sequencing and assembly approaches, our methods improved assembly contiguity, allowing for investigation of the role of repeat elements in microbial function and adaptation."
https://openalex.org/W3004632840,"The targeting scope of Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) and its engineered variants is largely restricted to protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) sequences containing G bases. Here we report the evolution of three new SpCas9 variants that collectively recognize NRNH PAMs (where R is A or G and H is A, C or T) using phage-assisted non-continuous evolution, three new phage-assisted continuous evolution strategies for DNA binding and a secondary selection for DNA cleavage. The targeting capabilities of these evolved variants and SpCas9-NG were characterized in HEK293T cells using a library of 11,776 genomically integrated protospacer-sgRNA pairs containing all possible NNNN PAMs. The evolved variants mediated indel formation and base editing in human cells and enabled A•T-to-G•C base editing of a sickle cell anemia mutation using a previously inaccessible CACC PAM. These new evolved SpCas9 variants, together with previously reported variants, in principle enable targeting of most NR PAM sequences and substantially reduce the fraction of genomic sites that are inaccessible by Cas9-based methods."
https://openalex.org/W3005249228,"Engineering a biotechnological microorganism for growth on one-carbon intermediates, produced from the abiotic activation of CO2, is a key synthetic biology step towards the valorization of this greenhouse gas to commodity chemicals. Here we redesign the central carbon metabolism of the model bacterium Escherichia coli for growth on one-carbon compounds using the reductive glycine pathway. Sequential genomic introduction of the four metabolic modules of the synthetic pathway resulted in a strain capable of growth on formate and CO2 with a doubling time of ~70 h and growth yield of ~1.5 g cell dry weight (gCDW) per mol-formate. Short-term evolution decreased doubling time to less than 8 h and improved biomass yield to 2.3 gCDW per mol-formate. Growth on methanol and CO2 was achieved by further expression of a methanol dehydrogenase. Establishing synthetic formatotrophy and methylotrophy, as demonstrated here, paves the way for sustainable bioproduction rooted in CO2 and renewable energy."
https://openalex.org/W3005032553,"Experience-dependent myelination is hypothesized to shape neural circuit function and subsequent behavioral output. Using a contextual fear memory task in mice, we demonstrate that fear learning induces oligodendrocyte precursor cells to proliferate and differentiate into myelinating oligodendrocytes in the medial prefrontal cortex. Transgenic animals that cannot form new myelin exhibit deficient remote, but not recent, fear memory recall. Recording population calcium dynamics by fiber photometry, we observe that the neuronal response to conditioned context cues evolves over time in the medial prefrontal cortex, but not in animals that cannot form new myelin. Finally, we demonstrate that pharmacological induction of new myelin formation with clemastine fumarate improves remote memory recall and promotes fear generalization. Thus, bidirectional manipulation of myelin plasticity functionally affects behavior and neurophysiology, which suggests that neural activity during fear learning instructs the formation of new myelin, which in turn supports the consolidation and/or retrieval of remote fear memories. Fear learning induces myelin formation. In the absence of new myelination, remote fear memory and neurophysiology of fear memory circuits are impaired. Conversely, administration of the pro-myelinating drug clemastine enhances remote fear memory."

https://openalex.org/W3005119588,"Cognitive decline remains an unaddressed problem for the elderly. We show that myelination is highly active in young mice and greatly inhibited in aged mice, coinciding with spatial memory deficits. Inhibiting myelination by deletion of Olig2 in oligodendrocyte precursor cells impairs spatial memory in young mice, while enhancing myelination by deleting the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 1 in oligodendrocyte precursor cells, or promoting oligodendroglial differentiation and myelination via clemastine treatment, rescues spatial memory decline during aging."
https://openalex.org/W3005073090,"Despite rare cancers accounting for 25% of adult tumors1, they are difficult to study due to the low disease incidence and geographically dispersed patient populations, which has resulted in significant unmet clinical needs for patients with rare cancers. We assessed whether a patient-partnered research approach using online engagement can overcome these challenges, focusing on angiosarcoma, a sarcoma with an annual incidence of 300 cases in the United States. Here we describe the development of the Angiosarcoma Project (ASCproject), an initiative enabling US and Canadian patients to remotely share their clinical information and biospecimens for research. The project generates and publicly releases clinically annotated genomic data on tumor and germline specimens on an ongoing basis. Over 18 months, 338 patients registered for the ASCproject, which comprises a large proportion of all patients with angiosarcoma. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) of 47 tumors revealed recurrently mutated genes that included KDR, TP53, and PIK3CA. PIK3CA-activating mutations were observed predominantly in primary breast angiosarcoma, which suggested a therapeutic rationale. Angiosarcoma of the head, neck, face and scalp (HNFS) was associated with a high tumor mutation burden (TMB) and a dominant ultraviolet damage mutational signature, which suggested that for the subset of patients with angiosarcoma of HNFS, ultraviolet damage may be a causative factor and that immune checkpoint inhibition may be beneficial. Medical record review revealed that two patients with HNFS angiosarcoma had received off-label therapeutic use of antibody to the programmed death-1 protein (anti-PD-1) and had experienced exceptional responses, which highlights immune checkpoint inhibition as a therapeutic avenue for HNFS angiosarcoma. This patient-partnered approach has catalyzed an opportunity to discover the etiology and potential therapies for patients with angiosarcoma. Collectively, this proof-of-concept study demonstrates that empowering patients to directly participate in research can overcome barriers in rare diseases and can enable discoveries. A framework of patient-partnered research allows patients with angiosarcoma to share their samples and clinical records securely to accelerate molecular characterization of tumors and identification of therapeutic approaches."
https://openalex.org/W3005405338,"Antidepressants are widely prescribed, but their efficacy relative to placebo is modest, in part because the clinical diagnosis of major depression encompasses biologically heterogeneous conditions. Here, we sought to identify a neurobiological signature of response to antidepressant treatment as compared to placebo. We designed a latent-space machine-learning algorithm tailored for resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) and applied it to data from the largest imaging-coupled, placebo-controlled antidepressant study (n = 309). Symptom improvement was robustly predicted in a manner both specific for the antidepressant sertraline (versus placebo) and generalizable across different study sites and EEG equipment. This sertraline-predictive EEG signature generalized to two depression samples, wherein it reflected general antidepressant medication responsivity and related differentially to a repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation treatment outcome. Furthermore, we found that the sertraline resting-state EEG signature indexed prefrontal neural responsivity, as measured by concurrent transcranial magnetic stimulation and EEG. Our findings advance the neurobiological understanding of antidepressant treatment through an EEG-tailored computational model and provide a clinical avenue for personalized treatment of depression."
https://openalex.org/W3004574736,"Monocyte-derived and tissue-resident macrophages are ontogenetically distinct components of the innate immune system. Assessment of their respective functions in pathology is complicated by changes to the macrophage phenotype during inflammation. Here we find that Cxcr4-CreER enables permanent genetic labeling of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and distinguishes HSC-derived monocytes from microglia and other tissue-resident macrophages. By combining Cxcr4-CreER-mediated lineage tracing with Cxcr4 inhibition or conditional Cxcr4 ablation in photothrombotic stroke, we find that Cxcr4 promotes initial monocyte infiltration and subsequent territorial restriction of monocyte-derived macrophages to infarct tissue. After transient focal ischemia, Cxcr4 deficiency reduces monocyte infiltration and blunts the expression of pattern recognition and defense response genes in monocyte-derived macrophages. This is associated with an altered microglial response and deteriorated outcomes. Thus, Cxcr4 is essential for an innate-immune-system-mediated defense response after cerebral ischemia. We further propose Cxcr4-CreER as a universal tool to study functions of HSC-derived cells."
https://openalex.org/W3005184631,"Attosecond pulses are fundamental for the investigation of valence and core-electron dynamics on their natural timescale. At present the reproducible generation and characterisation of attosecond waveforms has been demonstrated only through the process of high-order harmonic generation. Several methods for the shaping of attosecond waveforms have been proposed, including metallic filters, multilayer mirrors and manipulation of the driving field. However, none of these approaches allow for the flexible manipulation of the temporal characteristics of the attosecond waveforms, and they suffer from the low conversion efficiency of the high-order harmonic generation process. Free Electron Lasers, on the contrary, deliver femtosecond, extreme ultraviolet and X-ray pulses with energies ranging from tens of $\mathrm{\mu}$J to a few mJ. Recent experiments have shown that they can generate sub-fs spikes, but with temporal characteristics that change shot-to-shot. Here we show the first demonstration of reproducible generation of high energy ($\mathrm{\mu}$J level) attosecond waveforms using a seeded Free Electron Laser. We demonstrate amplitude and phase manipulation of the harmonic components of an attosecond pulse train in combination with a novel approach for its temporal reconstruction. The results presented here open the way to perform attosecond time-resolved experiments with Free Electron Lasers."
https://openalex.org/W3005908503,"The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of hamstring eccentric (NHE) strength training versus sprint training programmed as complements to regular soccer practice, on sprint performance and its mechanical underpinnings, as well as biceps femoris long head (BFlh) architecture.In this prospective interventional control study, sprint performance, sprint mechanics and BFlh architecture variables were compared before versus after six weeks of training during the first six preseason weeks, and between three different random match-pair groups of soccer players: ""Soccer group"" (n = 10), ""Nordic group"" (n = 12) and ""Sprint group"" (n = 10).For sprint performance and mechanics, small to large pre-post improvements were reported in ""Sprint group"" (except maximal running velocity), whereas only trivial to small negative changes were reported in ""Soccer group"" and ""Nordic group"". For BFlh architecture variables, ""Sprint"" group showed moderate increase in fascicle length compared to smaller augment for the ""Nordic"" group with trivial changes for ""Soccer group"". Only ""Nordic"" group presented small increases at pennation angle.The results suggest that sprint training was superior to NHE in order to increase BFlh fascicle length although only the sprint training was able to both provide a preventive stimulus (increase fascicle length) and at the same time improve both sprint performance and mechanics. Further studies with advanced imaging techniques are needed to confirm the validity of the findings."
https://openalex.org/W3004986543,"Bile salt hydrolase (BSH) enzymes are widely expressed by human gut bacteria and catalyze the gateway reaction leading to secondary bile acid formation. Bile acids regulate key metabolic and immune processes by binding to host receptors. There is an unmet need for a potent tool to inhibit BSHs across all gut bacteria to study the effects of bile acids on host physiology. Here, we report the development of a covalent pan-inhibitor of gut bacterial BSHs. From a rationally designed candidate library, we identified a lead compound bearing an alpha-fluoromethyl ketone warhead that modifies BSH at the catalytic cysteine residue. This inhibitor abolished BSH activity in conventional mouse feces. Mice gavaged with a single dose of this compound displayed decreased BSH activity and decreased deconjugated bile acid levels in feces. Our studies demonstrate the potential of a covalent BSH inhibitor to modulate bile acid composition in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W3005600142,"Examining the distributional equity of urban tree canopy cover (UTCC) has increasingly become an important interdisciplinary focus of ecologists and social scientists working within the field of environmental justice. However, while UTCC may serve as a useful proxy for the benefits provided by the urban forest, it is ultimately not a direct measure. In this study, we quantified the monetary value of multiple ecosystem services (ESD) provisioned by urban forests across nine U.S. cities. Next, we examined the distributional equity of UTCC and ESD using a number of commonly investigated socioeconomic variables. Based on trends in the literature, we predicted that UTCC and ESD would be positively associated with the variables median income and percent with an undergraduate degree and negatively associated with the variables percent minority, percent poverty, percent without a high school degree, percent renters, median year home built, and population density. We also predicted that there would be differences in the relationships between each response variable (UTCC and ESD) and the suite of socioeconomic predictor variables examined because of differences in how each response variable is derived. We utilized methods promoted within the environmental justice literature, including a multi-city comparative analysis, the incorporation of high-resolution social and environmental datasets, and the use of spatially explicit models. Patterns between the socioeconomic variables and UTCC and ESD did not consistently support our predictions, highlighting that inequities are generally not universal but rather context dependent. Our results also illustrated that although the variables UTCC and ESD had largely similar relationships with the predictor variables, differences did occur between them. Future distributional equity research should move beyond the use of proxies for environmental amenities when possible while making sure to consider that the use of ecosystem service estimates may result in different patterns with socioeconomic variables of interest. Based on our findings, we conclude that understanding and remedying the challenges associated with inequities requires an understanding of the local social-ecological system if larger sustainability goals are to be achieved."
https://openalex.org/W3005532091,"Several cancer immunotherapy approaches, such as immune checkpoint blockade and adoptive T-cell therapy, boost T-cell activity against the tumor, but these strategies are not effective in the absence of T cells specific for displayed tumor antigens. Here we outline an immunotherapy in which endogenous T cells specific for a noncancer antigen are retargeted to attack tumors. The approach relies on the use of antibody–peptide epitope conjugates (APECs) to deliver suitable antigens to the tumor surface for presention by HLA-I. To retarget cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific CD8+ T cells against tumors, we used APECs containing CMV-derived epitopes conjugated to tumor-targeting antibodies via metalloprotease-sensitive linkers. These APECs redirect pre-existing CMV immunity against tumor cells in vitro and in mouse cancer models. In vitro, APECs activated specifically CMV-reactive effector T cells whereas a bispecific T-cell engager activated both effector and regulatory T cells. Our approach may provide an effective alternative in cancers that are not amenable to checkpoint inhibitors or other immunotherapies. Anti-tumor activity of cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific CD8 T cells is achieved by antibody-mediated delivery of CMV epitopes."

In this study, the effects and mechanisms of tuna meat oligopeptides (TMOP) on hyperuricemia and associated renal inflammation were investigated in mice. Dietary administration of TMOP alleviated hyperuricemia and renal inflammation phenotypes, reprogramed uric acid metabolism pathways, inhibited the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathways, and suppressed the phosphorylation of p65-NF-κB. In addition, TMOP treatments repaired the intestinal epithelial barrier, reversed the gut microbiota dysbiosis and increased the production of short-chain fatty acids. Moreover, the antihyperuricemia effects of TMOP were transmissible by transplanting the fecal microbiota from TMOP-treated mice, indicating that the protective effects were at least partially mediated by the gut microbiota. Thus, for the first time, we clarify the potential effects of TMOP as a whole food derived ingredient on alleviating hyperuricemia and renal inflammation in mice, and additional efforts are needed to confirm the beneficial effects of TMOP on humans."

We designed a multiplex droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), which combines a drop-off assay, targeting the clustered hotspot mutations found in exon 8, with an unconventional assay interrogating the E380Q mutation in exon 5. We assessed its sensitivity in vitro using synthetic oligonucleotides, harboring E380Q, L536R, Y537C, Y537N, Y537S, or D538G mutations. Further validation was performed on plasma samples from a prospective study and compared with next generation sequencing (NGS) data. The multiplex ESR1-ddPCR showed a high sensitivity with a limit of detection ranging from 0.07 to 0.19% in mutant allele frequency. The screening of plasma samples from patients with AI-resistant metastatic breast cancer identified ESR1 mutations in 29% of them, all mutations being confirmed by NGS. In addition, this test identifies patients harboring polyclonal alterations. Furthermore, the monitoring of circulating tumor DNA using this technique during treatment follow-up predicts the clinical benefit of palbociclib–fulvestrant. The multiplex ESR1-ddPCR detects, in a single reaction, the most frequent ESR1 activating mutations with good sensitivity. This method allows real-time liquid biopsy for ESR1 mutation monitoring in large cohorts of patients."

They also contribute to the modulation of the immune system and are becoming popular for the treatment of a number of immune and inflammatory diseases. The main objective of this study was to evaluate anti-inflammatory and modulatory properties of Streptococcus thermophilus. We used peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors and assessed modifications in the mRNA expression of their genes related to innate and adaptive immune system. Our results showed strong immune modulatory effects of S. thermophilus 285 to human peripheral blood mononuclear cells with an array of anti-inflammatory properties. S. thermophilus 285 reduced mRNA expression in a number of inflammatory immune mediators and markers, and upregulated a few of immune markers. S. thermophilus is used in the dairy industry, survives during cold storage, tolerates well upon ingesting, and their consumption may have beneficial effects with potential implications in inflammatory and autoimmune disorders."

PIM kinase expression is elevated in PI3K inhibitor-treated breast cancer samples, suggesting a major resistance pathway for PI3K inhibitors in breast cancer, potentially limiting their clinical utility. IBL-302 is a novel molecule that inhibits both PIM and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling. We thus evaluated the preclinical activity of IBL-302, in a range of breast cancer models. Our results demonstrate in vitro efficacy of IBL-302 in a range of breast cancer cell lines, including lines with acquired resistance to trastuzumab and lapatinib. IBL-302 demonstrated single-agent, anti-tumour efficacy in suppression of pAKT, pmTOR and pBAD in the SKBR-3, BT-474 and HCC-1954 HER2+/PIK3CA-mutated cell lines. We have also shown the in vivo single-agent efficacy of IBL-302 in the subcutaneous BT-474 and HCC-1954 xenograft model in BALB/c nude mice. The combination of trastuzumab and IBL-302 significantly increased the anti-proliferative effect in HER2+ breast cancer cell line, and matched trastuzumab-resistant line, relative to testing either drug alone. We thus believe that the novel PIM and PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, IBL-302, represents an exciting new potential treatment option for breast cancer, and that it should be considered for clinical investigation."
https://openalex.org/W3006028094,"Hydrogen sulfide has been implicated in a large number of physiological processes including cell survival and death, encouraging research into its mechanisms of action and therapeutic potential. Results from recent studies suggest that the cellular effects of hydrogen sulfide are mediated in part by sulfane sulfur species, including persulfides and polysulfides. In the present study, we investigated the apoptosis-modulating effects of polysulfides, especially on the caspase cascade, which mediates the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Biochemical analyses revealed that organic or synthetic polysulfides strongly and rapidly inhibit the enzymatic activity of caspase-3, a major effector protease in apoptosis. We attributed the caspase-3 inhibition to persulfidation of its catalytic cysteine. In apoptotically stimulated HeLa cells, short-term exposure to polysulfides triggered the persulfidation and deactivation of cleaved caspase-3. These effects were antagonized by the thioredoxin/thioredoxin reductase system (Trx/TrxR). Trx/TrxR restored the activity of polysulfide-inactivated caspase-3 in vitro, and TrxR inhibition potentiated polysulfide-mediated suppression of caspase-3 activity in situ. We further found that under conditions of low TrxR activity, early cell exposure to polysulfides leads to enhanced persulfidation of initiator caspase-9 and decreases apoptosis. Notably, we show that the proenzymes procaspase-3 and -9 are basally persulfidated in resting (unstimulated) cells and become depersulfidated during their processing and activation. Inhibition of TrxR attenuated the depersulfidation and activation of caspase-9. Taken together, our results reveal that polysulfides target the caspase-9/3 cascade and thereby suppress cancer cell apoptosis, and highlight the role of Trx/TrxR-mediated depersulfidation in enabling caspase activation.

Apoptosis, the best-characterized form of regulated cell death, is a highly ordered process by which unwanted, defective, or damaged cells are swiftly and selectively eliminated from the body. Various stress stimuli activate the intrinsic apoptosis pathway leading to mitochondrial outer-membrane permeabilization, release of cytochrome c (Cyt c), and formation of the apoptosome. This then stimulates the oligomerization and autocatalytic activation of procaspase-9, which in turn cleaves and activates procaspase-3. Active caspase-3 then cleaves multiple substrates to execute apoptosis (6Riedl S.J. Shi Y. Molecular mechanisms of caspase regulation during apoptosis.Nat. Rev. Mol.

These findings highlight the need for a better mechanistic understanding of the proapoptotic and antiapoptotic effects of H2S/RSS. Emerging research indicates that cellular effects of H2S/RSS are mediated in part via protein persulfidation (Cys-SSH), a posttranslational modification of cysteine thiols (Cys-SH) (14Paul B.D.

However, how persulfidation may regulate the cellular apoptotic machinery remains poorly characterized. In addition, although recent studies have established that the thioredoxin/thioredoxin reductase (Trx/TrxR) system catalyzes persulfide reduction in cells (17Dóka É. Pader I. Bíró A. Johansson K.

At present, it is not fully understood how H2S triggers Cys persulfidation in cells. H2S cannot directly react with Cys thiols because the sulfur atoms in both species have the same oxidation state (−2). Accordingly, de novo protein persulfidation is thought to occur via one of the following mechanisms: (i) the reaction of oxidized Cys derivatives with sulfide or (ii) sulfide oxidation products reacting with Cys thiols (19Nagy P.

Regarding the latter, polysulfides (R-S-Sn-S-R′; n≥1) are oxidation products of H2S and potential intermediates in persulfidation reactions. Polysulfides are abundant in some types of food such as garlic (20Münchberg U. Anwar A. Mecklenburg S. Jacob C. Polysulfides as biologically active ingredients of garlic.Org. Biomol.

In the present study we found that polysulfides inhibited apoptosis signaling in cancer cells through a mechanism that involves inhibitory persulfidation of apoptotic caspases, caspase-3 and -9. In addition, we provide evidence that procaspase-3 and -9 are constitutively persulfidated in resting cells and undergo depersulfidation during their activation. Caspase persulfidation is antagonized by the Trx system. Overall, our findings suggest that the balance between persulfidation and Trx-mediated depersulfidation can determine caspase activities and resultant apoptotic cell death. We initiated this study by assessing the effects of several polysulfide compounds as well as a persulfide donor on the activity of purified caspase-3. For this, recombinant human caspase-3 was first subjected to DTT reduction and then the reduced protein (1 μm) was incubated for 20 min at 37 °C with SNAP-P* (S-methoxycarbonyl penicillamine disulfide, a persulfide donor) (27Artaud I. Galardon E. A persulfide analogue of the nitrosothiol SNAP: Formation, characterization and reactivity.Chembiochem. 2014; 15 (25205314): 2361-236410.1002/cbic.201402312Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar); the organic polysulfide diallyl trisulfide (DATS); or the synthetic polysulfides Na2S2, Na2S3, or Na2S4. Thereafter, caspase-3 activity was measured using a fluorogenic assay with the synthetic substrate Ac-DEVD-AMC. As shown (Fig. 1A), caspase-3 activity was effectively inhibited by either SNAP-P* or the polysulfide donors, most potently by Na2S3 and Na2S4 (≥50% inhibition at 2 μm of either compound). Time course experiments performed at room temperature using 0.1 μm caspase-3 demonstrated rapid inactivation of the enzyme upon incubation with 0.5 or 1 μm Na2S4 (Fig. 1B). To ensure that residual polysulfide did not interfere with the caspase activity assay, we employed another assay in which caspase-3 was immobilized onto nickel-coated microplates, enabling the facile removal of excess reactants (see “Experimental procedures” for more details). This assay also showed that Na2S4 potently and dose-dependently inhibited caspase-3 activity (Fig. 1C). In view of these results, we next performed mass spectrometric (MS) analysis to identify cysteine residues in caspase-3 that could be persulfidated. For this purpose, untreated, Na2S4-treated, or SNAP-P*–treated caspase-3 were derivatized by iodoacetamide and subjected to tryptic digestion, and the resulting peptides were analyzed by LC-MS/MS (see “Experimental procedures”). Iodoacetamide derivatization was performed to (i) quench thiol/persulfide reactions that may occur during sample processing and to (ii) generate carbamidomethylated persulfide derivatives (R-S-S-CH2-CO-NH2) to help differentiate persulfides from sulfinic acid (both causing very similar mass changes). The MS analysis resulted in the identification of persulfidated cysteines in the polysulfide- and persulfide-treated, but not in the untreated, caspase-3 (Table S1, A and B). In both the Na2S4 and SNAP-P* samples, the catalytic cysteine (Cys-163) was found to be the predominant site of persulfidation (Fig. 2, A and B; Table S1, A and B). Other, low-abundant modifications, were Cys-170 persulfide, Cys-264 persulfide, and Cys-163–Cys-170 disulfide (Tables S1, A and B). We proceeded to examine possible effects of polysulfides on cellular caspase-3. For this purpose, we exposed HeLa cancer cells to the apoptosis inducer staurosporine (STS) in the presence or absence of Na2S4. We used an experimental design in which the cells were exposed to STS for 4 h with the polysulfide added for the final 1 h. Thereafter, the cells were lysed and caspase-3–like activity in cell lysates was measured. These experiments revealed that Na2S4 dose-dependently inhibited STS-mediated induction of caspase-3 activity (Fig. 3A). Similar to Na2S4, DATS also effectively inhibited STS-dependent caspase activation (Fig. 3A). During its activation, caspase-3 undergoes maturation from its unprocessed, proform, to its processed, cleaved form. It was possible that the polysulfides inhibited the processing of procaspase-3 or disrupted another upstream event. However, immunoblot analysis showed that Na2S4 or DATS did not block STS-induced cleavage of procaspase-3 (Fig. 3B), suggesting that the polysulfides directly inhibited the activity of the processed enzyme. Considering these observations, we sought to examine if cellular caspase-3 was persulfidated under these experimental conditions. For this purpose, we employed the biotin thiol assay (BTA) for protein persulfidation (28Gao X.-H. Krokowski D. Guan B.-J. Bederman I. Majumder M. Parisien M. Diatchenko L. Kabil O. Willard B. Banerjee R. Wang B. Bebek G. Evans C.R. Fox P.L. Gerson S.L. Hoppel C.L. Liu M. Arvan P. Hatzoglou M. Quantitative H2S-mediated protein sulfhydration reveals metabolic reprogramming during the integrated stress response.Elife. 2015; 4 (26595448): e1006710.7554/eLife.10067Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). BTA results indicated that cellular caspase-3 was indeed persulfidated (Fig. 3B). Notably, procaspase-3 was found to be basally (i.e. constitutively) persulfidated in resting HeLa cells (Fig. 3B). Conversely, cleaved caspase-3 (after STS stimulation) was barely persulfidated; however, its persulfidation was markedly increased in cells exposed to Na2S4 or DATS (Fig. 3B). Together, these cellular data suggest that polysulfides trigger the persulfidation of cleaved caspase-3, causing its deactivation. In addition, these results raise the intriguing possibility that endogenous persulfidation of procaspase-3 is involved in the regulation of this protease. We then examined the effects of Na2S4 on other cell types or apoptotic stimuli. Similar to our findings in HeLa cells, we observed that Na2S4 inhibited caspase-3 activity in STS-treated THP-1 monocytic cells (Fig. 3C). Whereas STS activates the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, members of the TNF family of cytokines such as TNF and TRAIL trigger the extrinsic apoptotic pathway (7Taylor R.C. Cullen S.P. Martin S.J. Apoptosis: Controlled demolition at the cellular level.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9 (18073771): 231-24110.1038/nrm2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1738) Google Scholar). We found that Na2S4 effectively suppressed TRAIL-induced caspase-3 activity in HCT116 colon cancer cells (Fig. 3D). Thus, polysulfides can counteract caspase-3 activation in different cell types, and in response to different apoptotic insults. The extent of protein persulfidation reflects the balance between persulfidation and depersulfidation processes. It is known that the Trx/TrxR system mediates caspase-3 denitrosylation (29Benhar M. Forrester M.T. Hess D.T. Stamler J.S. Regulated protein denitrosylation by cytosolic and mitochondrial thioredoxins.Science. 2008; 320 (18497292): 1050-105410.1126/science.1158265Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) and growing evidence suggests that Trx/TrxR acts as a persulfide reductase (17Dóka É.

Sci. 2016; 7 (27170841): 3414-342610.1039/C5SC04818DCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). Employing our in vitro assay with immobilized caspase-3 (as described above in Fig. 1C and depicted in Fig. 4A) we tested if Trx/TrxR could restore the activity of Na2S4-treated caspase-3. The results showed that a 30 min incubation with Trx/TrxR and NADPH resulted in near-complete recovery of caspase-3 activity, an effect almost equal to that achieved by the strong chemical reductant DTT and slightly better compared with the biologically relevant reductant GSH (Fig. 4B). Next, to examine the role of the Trx system in regulating persulfidation in cells we employed auranofin (AUR), a highly potent and selective TrxR inhibitor (30Gromer S. Arscott L.D. Williams Jr., C.H. Schirmer R.H. Becker K. Human placenta thioredoxin reductase. Isolation of the selenoenzyme, steady state kinetics, and inhibition by therapeutic gold compounds.J. Biol.

We found that AUR markedly potentiated the inhibitory effects elicited by Na2S4. Indeed, whereas treatment with 25 μm Na2S4 alone failed to inhibit caspase-3, in the presence of AUR ∼75% inhibition was observed (Fig. 4C). Immunoblot analysis showed that cleavage of procaspase-3 was not inhibited by Na2S4 in the presence of AUR (Fig. 4C), further arguing for a direct effect on the cleaved enzyme. We extended these findings by using Tri-1, a recently described potent and specific inhibitor of TrxR1 (31Stafford W.C. Peng X. Olofsson M.H. Zhang X. Luci D.K. Lu L. Cheng Q. Trésaugues L. Dexheimer T.S. Coussens N.P. Augsten M. Ahlzén H.-S.M. Orwar O. Östman A. Stone-Elander S. et al.Irreversible inhibition of cytosolic thioredoxin reductase 1 as a mechanistic basis for anticancer therapy.Sci. Transl. Med. 2018; 10 (29444979): eaaf744410.1126/scitranslmed.aaf7444Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We found that Tri-1, which has a different chemical structure and a different mechanism of action compared with AUR (31Stafford W.C. Peng X. Olofsson M.H. Zhang X. Luci D.K. Lu L. Cheng Q. Trésaugues L. Dexheimer T.S. Coussens N.P. Augsten M. Ahlzén H.-S.M. Orwar O. Östman A. Stone-Elander S. et al.Irreversible inhibition of cytosolic thioredoxin reductase 1 as a mechanistic basis for anticancer therapy.Sci. Transl. Med. 2018; 10 (29444979): eaaf744410.1126/scitranslmed.aaf7444Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), also augmented Na2S4-mediated inhibition of caspase-3 (Fig. S1), thus corroborating the role of TrxR1 in these effects. We then monitored the cleavage of a well-established caspase-3 substrate, inhibitor of caspase-activated DNase (ICAD). After its cleavage by caspase-3 the cleaved ICAD loses its affinity for CAD, and CAD is thereby released from ICAD and digests the chromosomal DNA (7Taylor R.C. Cullen S.P. Martin S.J. Apoptosis: Controlled demolition at the cellular level.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9 (18073771): 231-24110.1038/nrm2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1738) Google Scholar). Despite the above-noted effects on caspase-3 activity, STS-dependent cleavage of ICAD was not altered in cells exposed to AUR and Na2S4. This lack of effect on ICAD processing is very likely because the polysulfide was added 3 h after STS stimulation, a time point where the key apoptotic processes (including ICAD cleavage) are well under way. Based on the above observations, we next sought to investigate cellular effects induced by polysulfide exposure that precedes or coincides with the initiation of apoptosis. Accordingly, cells were exposed simultaneously to STS and different combinations of Na2S4 and AUR. As shown in Fig. 4D, in the absence of AUR, an early exposure to Na2S4 did not affect STS-induced caspase-3 activation. In contrast, in the presence of AUR, Na2S4 treatment effectively and dose-dependently inhibited caspase activation. Importantly, in this setting, the cleavage of procaspase-3 was also attenuated (Fig. 4D). These observations suggest that under conditions of suppressed Trx/TrxR activity, early administration of Na2S4 disrupts the apoptotic signaling upstream of caspase-3. Of note, analysis of ICAD processing showed that AUR/Na2S4 co-treatment led to decreased ICAD cleavage, indicating a weaker apoptotic response (Fig. 4D). In light of these observations, we postulated that AUR/Na2S4 treatment may disrupt the activity of caspase-9, the initiator caspase that cleaves and activates procaspase-3 during intrinsic apoptosis (7Taylor R.C. Cullen S.P. Martin S.J. Apoptosis: Controlled demolition at the cellular level.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9 (18073771): 231-24110.1038/nrm2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1738) Google Scholar). Supporting this notion, we observed that Na2S4 dose-dependently inhibited caspase-9 activity in apoptotic cell lysates, which was quantitatively similar to the effect toward caspase-3 (Fig. 5A). Next, we found that although cell treatment with Na2S4 alone had very little effect on STS-induced caspase-9 activity, in the presence of AUR, Na2S4 effectively inhibited the enzyme (Fig. 5B). Immunoblot analysis showed that treatment with AUR/Na2S4 (but not Na2S4 alone) partially inhibited the cleavage of procaspase-9 (Fig. 5C); however, the inhibitory effect on caspase-9 activity was far greater than the effect on proenzyme cleavage (Fig. 5, B and C). For example, treatment with 250 μm Na2S4 (in the presence of AUR) led to >90% inhibition of caspase-9 activity as compared with ∼50% decrease in procaspase processing. These data suggested the possibility that c"

The impact of exercise training (ET) on RT efficiency is however largely unknown. Our study aims to investigate the interactions between ET and RT on prostate cancer growth. Athymic mice received a subcutaneous injection of PPC-1 cells and were randomly assigned to either cancer control, cancer ET, cancer RT, or cancer RT combined with ET (CaRT-ET). Mice were sacrificed 24 days post-injection. All three intervention groups had reduced tumor size, the most important decrease being observed in CaRT-ET mice. Apoptotic marker cleaved caspase-3 was not modified by ET, but enhanced with RT. Importantly, this increase was the highest when the two strategies were combined. Furthermore, NK1.1 staining and gene expression of natural killer (NK) cell receptors Klrk1 and Il2rβ were not affected by ET alone but were increased with RT, this effect being potentiated when combined with ET. Overall, our study shows that (a) ET enhances RT efficiency by potentiating NK cell infiltration, and (b) while ET alone and ET combined with RT both reduce tumor growth, the mechanisms mediating these effects are different."

https://openalex.org/W3006022642,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is a chronic liver disease which is associated with obesity and insulin resistance. We investigated the implication of REDD1 (Regulated in development and DNA damage response-1), a stress-induced protein in the development of hepatic steatosis. REDD1 expression was increased in the liver of obese mice and morbidly obese patients, and its expression correlated with hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance in obese patients. REDD1 deficiency protected mice from the development of hepatic steatosis induced by high-fat diet (HFD) without affecting body weight gain and glucose intolerance. This protection was associated with a decrease in the expression of lipogenic genes, SREBP1c, FASN, and SCD-1 in liver of HFD-fed REDD1-KO mice. Healthy mitochondria are crucial for the adequate control of lipid metabolism and failure to remove damaged mitochondria is correlated with liver steatosis. Expression of markers of autophagy and mitophagy, Beclin, LC3-II, Parkin, BNIP3L, was enhanced in liver of HFD-fed REDD1-KO mice. The number of mitochondria showing colocalization between LAMP2 and AIF was increased in liver of HFD-fed REDD1-KO mice. Moreover, mitochondria in liver of REDD1-KO mice were smaller than in WT.

https://openalex.org/W3006370830,"Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3) are among the most common viral causes of childhood bronchiolitis and pneumonia worldwide, and lack effective antiviral drugs or vaccines. Recombinant (r) HPIV3 was modified to express the RSV fusion (F) glycoprotein, the major RSV neutralization and protective antigen, providing a live intranasal bivalent HPIV3/RSV vaccine candidate. This extends previous studies using a chimeric bovine-human PIV3 vector (rB/HPIV3). One advantage is that rHPIV3 expresses all of the HPIV3 antigens compared to only two for rB/HPIV3. In addition, the use of rHPIV3 as vector should avoid excessive attenuation following addition of the modified RSV F gene, which may occur with rB/HPIV3. To enhance its immunogenicity, RSV F was modified (i) to increase the stability of the prefusion (pre-F) conformation and (ii) by replacement of its transmembrane (TM) and cytoplasmic tail (CT) domains with those of HPIV3 F (H3TMCT) to increase incorporation in the vector virion. RSV F (+/- H3TMCT) was expressed from the first (F/preN) or the second (F/N-P) gene position of rHPIV3. The H3TMCT modification dramatically increased packaging of RSV F into the vector virion and, in hamsters, resulted in significant increases in the titer of high-quality serum RSV-neutralizing antibodies, in addition to the increase conferred by pre-F stabilization. Only F-H3TMCT/preN replication was significantly attenuated in the nasal turbinates by the RSV F insert. F-H3TMCT/preN, F/N-P, and F-H3TMCT/N-P provided complete protection against wt RSV challenge. F-H3TMCT/N-P exhibited the most stable and highest expression of RSV F, providing impetus for its further development."
https://openalex.org/W3006582935,"A key requirement for longitudinal studies using routinely-collected health data is to be able to measure what individuals are present in the datasets used, and over what time period. Individuals can enter and leave the covered population of administrative datasets for a variety of reasons, including both life events and characteristics of the datasets themselves. An automated, customizable method of determining individuals’ presence was developed for the primary care dataset in Swansea University’s SAIL Databank. The primary care dataset covers only a portion of Wales, with 76% of practices participating. The start and end date of the data varies by practice. Additionally, individuals can change practices or leave Wales. To address these issues, a two step process was developed. First, the period for which each practice had data available was calculated by measuring changes in the rate of events recorded over time. Second, the registration records for each individual were simplified. Anomalies such as short gaps and overlaps were resolved by applying a set of rules. The result of these two analyses was a cleaned set of records indicating start and end dates of available primary care data for each individual. Analysis of GP records showed that 91.0% of events occurred within periods calculated as having available data by the algorithm. 98.4% of those events were observed at the same practice of registration as that computed by the algorithm. A standardized method for solving this common problem has enabled faster development of studies using this data set. Using a rigorous, tested, standardized method of verifying presence in the study population will also positively influence the quality of research."
https://openalex.org/W3006081850,"Aiming to identify immune molecules with a novel function in cancer pathogenesis, we found the cluster of differentiation 177 (CD177), a known neutrophil antigen, to be positively correlated with relapse-free, metastasis-free, or overall survival in breast cancer. In addition, CD177 expression is correlated with good prognosis in several other solid cancers including prostate, cervical, and lung. Focusing on breast cancer, we found that CD177 is expressed in normal breast epithelial cells and is significantly reduced in invasive cancers. Loss of CD177 leads to hyperproliferative mammary epithelium and contributes to breast cancer pathogenesis. Mechanistically, we found that CD177-deficiency is associated with an increase in β-catenin signaling. Here we identified CD177 as a novel regulator of mammary epithelial proliferation and breast cancer pathogenesis likely via the modulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, a key signaling pathway involved in multiple cancer types."
https://openalex.org/W3006098579,"Medical practitioners, trained to isolate health within and upon the body of the individual, are now challenged to negotiate research and population health theories that link health status to geographic location as evidence suggests a connection between place and health. This paper builds an integrated place-health model and structural competency analytical framework with nine domains and four levels of proficiency that is utilized to assess a community-based photovoice project's ability to shift the practice of medicine by medical students from the surface of the body to the body within a place. Analysis of the medical student's photovoice data demonstrated that the students achieved structural competency level 1 proficiency and came to understand how health might be connected to place represented by six of the nine domains of the structural competency framework. Results suggest that medical student's engagement with place-health systemic, institutional and structural forces deepens when they co-create narratives of their lived experiences in a place with patients as community members during a community-based photovoice project. Given the importance of place-health theories to explain population health outcomes, a place-health model and structural competency analytical framework utilized during a community-based photovoice project could help medical students merge the image of patients as singular bodies into bodies set within a context."
https://openalex.org/W3006139587,"Typhoons frequently affect the South China Sea (SCS), playing an important role in changing the coastal marine system. To determine which process has the greatest impact on material transport in the coastal marine area during a typhoon, the sea temperature, salinity, concentration of nutrients, chlorophyll-a, total suspended matter, and δ13C of particulate organic carbon (δ13C-POC) in the water column of coastal Northern SCS (NSCS) were measured during two cruises in June 2017, in the pre- and post-typhoon Merbok periods. The results show that all parameters changed significantly between the two periods. During the pre-typhoon period, stratification of nutrients and physicochemical parameters, combined to high nutrient concentrations, high temperature, and low salinity in the water column of the nearshore area, suggests that the nearshore area is influenced by the river diluted water originated in the coastal cities adjacent to our study area. In the offshore area, mineralization may be responsible for the high nutrient concentration in the bottom water. However, during the post-typhoon, the stratification of nutrients is less significant and their distribution more homogenous in the whole water column of the nearshore area. In the upper water, the nutrient concentration increased and the temperature decreased significantly. These results suggest that the enhanced vertical mixing induced by the typhoon was the dominant process in changing the nutrient distribution pattern in the coastal NSCS."
https://openalex.org/W3005875005,"Data on the true prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in the general population is essential. We evaluated a program implementing free universal HCV screening using a non-invasive point-of-care test (POCT) (OraQuick-HCV rapid test) in oral fluid in an urban area in Valencia, South-Eastern Spain.A cross-sectional study was performed during 2015-2017. Free HCV screening was offered by regular mail to 11,500 individuals aged 18 and over, randomly selected from all census residents in the Health Department. All responding participants filled in a questionnaire about HCV infection risk factors and were tested in their tertiary Hospital. In those with a positive POCT, results were confirmed by enzyme-immunoassay and HCV-RNA.1,206 persons agreed to participate (response rate: 11.16%). HCV antibodies were detected in 19 (1.60%) cases (age-sex standardized rate: 1.31%; 95%CI: 0.82-2.07), but only 8 showed positive HCV-RNA (age-sex standardized rate: 0.56%; 95%CI: 0.28-1.14). The majority (89%) of the cases were born before 1965 and 74% had at least one known risk factor for HCV infection. All anti-HCV positive individuals were already aware of their infection, and no undiagnosed cases were detected. The performance of the POCT was excellent for detecting active infection.These preliminary data suggest that HCV population screening with a POCT is feasible but, in our setting, mailing recruiting is not effective (11% response rate). The low prevalence of HCV antibodies and active infection in the participant population (with no new diagnoses made) suggests that, in our setting, underdiagnosis may be uncommon."
https://openalex.org/W3005962754,"Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a glycoprotein hormone that is essential for the maintenance of pregnancy. Glycosylation of hCG is known to be essential for its biological activity. “Hyperglycosylated” variants secreted during early pregnancy have been proposed to be involved in initial implantation of the embryo and as a potential diagnostic marker for gestational diseases. However, what constitutes “hyperglycosylation” is not yet fully understood. In this study, we perform comparative N-glycomic analysis of hCG expressed in the same individuals during early and late pregnancy to help provide new insights into hCG function, reveal new targets for diagnostics and clarify the identity of hyperglycosylated hCG. hCG was isolated in urine collected from women at 7 weeks and 20 weeks’ gestation. hCG was also isolated in urine from women diagnosed with gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD). We used glycomics methodologies including matrix assisted laser desorption/ionisation–time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) and MS/MS methods to characterise the N-glycans associated with hCG purified from the individual samples. The structures identified on the early pregnancy (EP-hCG) and late pregnancy (LP-hCG) samples corresponded to mono-, bi-, tri-, and tetra-antennary N-glycans. A novel finding was the presence of substantial amounts of bisected type N-glycans in pregnancy hCG samples, which were present at much lower levels in GTD samples. A second novel observation was the presence of abundant LewisX antigens on the bisected N-glycans. GTD-hCG had fewer glycoforms which constituted a subset of those found in normal pregnancy. When compared to EP-hCG, GTD-hCG samples had decreased signals for tri- and tetra-antennary N-glycans. In terms of terminal epitopes, GTD-hCG had increased signals for sialylated structures, while LewisX antigens were of very minor abundance. hCG carries the same N-glycans throughout pregnancy but in different proportions. The N-glycan repertoire is more diverse than previously reported. Bisected and LewisX structures are potential targets for diagnostics. hCG isolated from pregnancy urine inhibits NK cell cytotoxicity in vitro at nanomolar levels and bisected type glycans have previously been implicated in the suppression of NK cell cytotoxicity, suggesting that hCG-related bisected type N-glycans may directly suppress NK cell cytotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W3005576133,"Influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 virus emerged in North America in 2009 and has been established as a seasonal strain in humans. After an antigenic stasis of about six years, new antigenically distinct variants of the virus emerged globally in 2016 necessitating a change in the vaccine formulation for the first time in 2017. Herein, we analyzed thirty-eight HA sequences of influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 strains isolated in Kenya during 2015-2018 seasons, to evaluate their antigenic and molecular properties based on the HA1 sub-unit. Our analyses revealed that the A (H1N1) pdm09 strains that circulated in Kenya during this period belonged to genetic clade 6B, subclade 6B.1 and 6B.2. The Kenyan 2015 and 2016 isolates differed from the vaccine strain A/California/07/2009 at nine and fourteen antigenic sites in the HA1 respectively. Further, those isolated in 2017 and 2018 correspondingly varied from A/Michigan/45/2015 vaccine strain at three and fifteen antigenic sites. The predicted vaccine efficacy of A/California/07/2009 against Kenyan 2015/2016 was estimated to be 32.4% while A/Michigan/45/2015 showed estimated vaccine efficacies of 39.6% - 41.8% and 32.4% - 42.1% against Kenyan 2017 and 2018 strains, respectively. Hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) assay using ferret post-infection reference antiserum showed that the titers for the Kenyan 2015/2016 isolates were 2-8-fold lower compared to the vaccine strain. Overall, our results suggest the A (H1N1) pdm09 viruses that circulated in Kenya during 2015/2016 influenza seasons were antigenic variants of the recommended vaccine strains, denoting sub-optimal vaccine efficacy. Additionally, data generated point to a swiftly evolving influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 virus in recent post pandemic era, underscoring the need for sustained surveillance coupled with molecular and antigenic analyses, to inform appropriate and timely influenza vaccine update."
https://openalex.org/W3006091065,"GPS collars have revolutionized the field of animal ecology, providing detailed information on animal movement and the habitats necessary for species survival. GPS collars also have the potential to cause adverse effects ranging from mild irritation to severe tissue damage, reduced fitness, and death. The impact of GPS collars on the behavior, stress, or activity, however, have rarely been tested on study species prior to release. The objective of our study was to provide a comprehensive assessment of the short-term effects of GPS collars fitted on scimitar-horned oryx (Oryx dammah), an extinct-in-the-wild antelope once widely distributed across Sahelian grasslands in North Africa. We conducted behavioral observations, assessed fecal glucocorticoid metabolites (FGM), and evaluated high-resolution data from tri-axial accelerometers. Using a series of datasets and methodologies, we illustrate clear but short-term effects to animals fitted with GPS collars from two separate manufacturers (Advanced Telemetry Systems—G2110E; Vectronic Aerospace—Vertex Plus). Behavioral observations highlighted a significant increase in the amount of headshaking from pre-treatment levels, returning below baseline levels during the post-treatment period (>3 days post-collaring). Similarly, FGM concentrations increased after GPS collars were fitted on animals but returned to pre-collaring levels within 5 days of collaring. Lastly, tri-axial accelerometers, collecting data at eight positions per second, indicated a > 480 percent increase in the amount of hourly headshaking immediately after collaring. This post-collaring increase in headshaking was estimated to decline in magnitude within 4 hours after GPS collar fitting. These effects constitute a handling and/or habituation response (model dependent), with animals showing short-term responses in activity, behavior, and stress that dissipated within several hours to several days of being fitted with GPS collars. Importantly, none of our analyses indicated any long-term effects that would have more pressing animal welfare concerns."
https://openalex.org/W3006588499,"A facultative parasite of cereals, Fusarium culmorum is a soil-, air- and seed-borne fungus causing foot and root rot, fusarium seedling blight, and especially Fusarium head blight, a spike disease leading to decreased yield and mycotoxin contamination of grain. In the present study, we tested changes in expression of wheat genes (B2H2, ICS, PAL, and PR2) involved in defence against diseases. We first compared expression of the analysed genes in seedlings of non-inoculated and artificially inoculated wheat (variety Bohemia). The second part of the experiment compared expression of these genes in seedlings grown under various treatment conditions. These treatments were chosen to determine the effects of prochloraz, sodium bicarbonate, ergosterol, aescin and potassium iodide on expression of the analysed defence genes. In addition to the inoculated and non-inoculated cultivar Bohemia, we additionally examined two other varieties of wheat with contrasting resistance to Fusarium sp. infection. These were the blue aleurone layer variety Scorpion that is susceptible to Fusarium sp. infection and variety V2-49-17 with yellow endosperm and partial resistance to Fusarium sp. infection. In this manner, we were able to compare potential effects of inductors upon defence gene expression among three varieties with different susceptibility to infection but also between inoculated and non-inoculated seedlings of a single variety. The lowest infection levels were detected in the sodium bicarbonate treatment. Sodium bicarbonate had not only negative influence on Fusarium growth but also positively affected expression of plant defence genes. Expression of the four marker genes shown to be important in plant defence was significantly affected by the treatments. The greatest upregulation in comparison to the water control was identified under all treatments for the B2H2 gene. Only expression of PAL under the ergosterol and prochloraz treatments were not statistically significant."
https://openalex.org/W3006001142,"The risk of metabolic abnormalities in menopausal women increases significantly due to the decline in estrogen level. Nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (NRF2) is an important oxidative stress sensor that plays regulatory role in energy metabolism. Therefore, an ovariectomized menopausal model in Nrf2-knockout (KO) mice was applied to evaluate the effect of Nrf2 deficiency on metabolism in menopausal females. The mice were divided into four groups according to their genotypes and treatments. Blood samples and bodyweights were obtained preoperatively and in the first to ninth postoperative weeks after overnight fasting. Serum levels of triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (T-CHO), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and glucose (GLU) were measured at postoperative weeks 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. Neurotransmitter dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) was analyzed in brain tissues after sacrifice at postoperative week 9. The results demonstrated that, compared with the corresponding wild-type (WT) mice, KO ovariectomized mice had a greater bodyweight gain (P<0.01). Serum analysis showed that the serum GLU, T-CHO, and TG were significantly lower (P<0.05) but LDL was significantly higher (P<0.05) in the KO control mice than that in WT control mice. However, different from the WT counterparts, an increase in blood GLU level (P<0.05), unchanged T-CHO, TG, and HDL levels, and a significant reduction in LDL (P<0.01) was found in the KO ovariectomized mice. In addition, the level of 5-HT was significantly reduced (P<0.05) in the KO mice after ovariectomy. In conclusion, the combination of Nrf2 deletion and a decline in estrogen level induced a significant increase in bodyweight, which may be associated with their altered glucose and LDL metabolism and decreased 5-HT levels. From a clinical perspective, women with antioxidant defense deficiency may have an increased risk of metabolic abnormalities after menopause."
https://openalex.org/W3006504432,"Objectives Oncology has become more reliant on new testing methods and a greater use of electronic medical records, which provide a plethora of information available to physicians and researchers. However, to take advantage of vital clinical and research data for precision medicine, we must initially make an effort to create an infrastructure for the collection, storage, and utilization of this information with uniquely designed disease-specific registries that could support the collection of a large number of patients. Materials and methods In this study, we perform an in-depth analysis of a series of lung adenocarcinoma patients (n = 415) with genomic and clinical data in a recently created thoracic patient registry. Results Of the 415 patients with lung adenocarcinoma, 59% (n = 245) were female; the median age was 64 (range, 22–92) years with a median OS of 33.29 months (95% CI, 29.77–39.48). The most common actionable alterations were identified in EGFR (n = 177/415 [42.7%]), ALK (n = 28/377 [7.4%]), and BRAF V600E (n = 7/288 [2.4%]). There was also a discernible difference in survival for 222 patients, who had an actionable alteration, with a median OS of 39.8 months as compared to 193 wild-type patients with a median OS of 26.0 months (P<0.001). We identified an unprecedented number of actionable alterations [53.5% (222/415)], including distinct individual alteration rates, as compared with 15.0% and 22.3% in TCGA and GENIE respectively. Conclusion The use of patient registries, focused genomic panels and the appropriate use of clinical guidelines in community and academic settings may influence cohort selection for clinical trials and improve survival outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3006125724,"The alpine meadow is highly sensitive to global climate change due to its high elevation and cold environment. To understand the dynamics of ecosystem carbon cycling, CO2 fluxes were measured over the Suli alpine meadow, which is located at the upper reach of the Shule River basin at the northeastern edge of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), China. The measurements were taken from October 2008 to September 2012 using the eddy covariance technique. Obvious seasonal and inter-annual variations were observed in the CO2 flux. The annual net carbon exchange ranged from -195.28 g·CO2·m-2 to -118.49 g·CO2·m-2, indicating that the alpine meadow ecosystem in this area played a role as a carbon sink. The inter-annual variability in the net carbon exchange was significantly related to the length of the growing season for the alpine meadow. The results showed that the months of June, July and August were the strongest CO2 absorption periods, while April, May and October were the strongest CO2 release periods. The annual net exchanges of CO2 in the four years were -118.49 g·CO2·m-2, -130.75 g·CO2·m-2, -195.83 g·CO2·m-2 and -160.65 g·CO2·m-2, and the average value was -151.43 g·CO2·m-2. On a seasonal scale, the monthly CO2 fluxes were largely controlled by temperature. At the annual scale, there was no dominant factor that influenced the interannual variations in the CO2 flux."

https://openalex.org/W3005639790,"Saccadic eye movements bring events of interest to the center of the retina, enabling detailed visual analysis. This study explored whether irrelevant auditory (experiments A, B & F), visual (C & D) or tactile signals (E & F) delivered around the onset of a visual target modulates saccade latency. Participants were instructed to execute a quick saccade toward a target stepping left or right from a fixation position. We observed an interaction between auditory beeps or tactile vibrations and the oculomotor reaction that included two components: a warning effect resulting in faster saccades when the signal and the target were presented simultaneously; and a modulation effect with shorter-or longer-latencies when auditory and tactile signals were delivered before-or after-the target onset. Combining both modalities only increased the modulation effect to a limited extent, pointing to a saturation of the multisensory interaction with the motor control. Interestingly, irrelevant visual stimuli (black background or isoluminant noise strips in peripheral vision, flashed for 10 ms) increased saccade latency whether they were presented just before or after target onset. The lack of latency reduction with visual signals suggests that the modulation observed in the auditory and tactile experiments was not related to priming effects but rather to low-level audio- and tactile-visual integration. The increase in saccade latency observed with irrelevant visual stimuli is discussed in relation to saccadic inhibition. Our results demonstrate that signals conveying no information regarding where and when a visual target would appear modulate saccadic reactivity, much like in multisensory temporal binding, but only when these signals come from a different modality."
https://openalex.org/W3006623124,"Humans are entertained and emotionally captivated by a good story. Artworks, such as operas, theatre plays, movies, TV series, cartoons, etc., contain implicit stories, which are conveyed visually (e.g., through scenes) and audially (e.g., via music and speech). Story theorists have explored the structure of various artworks and identified forms and paradigms that are common to most well-written stories. Further, typical story structures have been formalized in different ways and used by professional screenwriters as guidelines. Currently, computers cannot yet identify such a latent narrative structure of a movie story. Therefore, in this work, we raise the novel challenge of understanding and formulating the movie story structure and introduce the first ever story-based labeled dataset-the Flintstones Scene Dataset (FSD). The dataset consists of 1, 569 scenes taken from a manual annotation of 60 episodes of a famous cartoon series, The Flintstones, by 105 distinct annotators. The various labels assigned to each scene by different annotators are summarized by a probability vector over 10 possible story elements representing the function of each scene in the advancement of the story, such as the Climax of Act One or the Midpoint. These elements are learned from guidelines for professional script-writing. The annotated dataset is used to investigate the effectiveness of various story-related features and multi-label classification algorithms for the task of predicting the probability distribution of scene labels. We use cosine similarity and KL divergence to measure the quality of predicted distributions. The best approaches demonstrated 0.81 average similarity and 0.67 KL divergence between the predicted label vectors and the ground truth vectors based on the manual annotations. These results demonstrate the ability of machine learning approaches to detect the narrative structure in movies, which could lead to the development of story-related video analytics tools, such as automatic video summarization and recommendation systems."
https://openalex.org/W3006065877,"The development of the neuromuscular junction depends on signaling processes that involve protein phosphorylation. Motor neuron releases agrin to activate muscle protein Dok-7, a key tyrosine kinase essential for the formation of a mature and functional neuromuscular junction. However, the signaling cascade downstream of Dok-7 remains poorly understood. In this study, we combined the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/Cas9 technique and quantitative phosphoproteomics analysis to study the tyrosine phosphorylation events triggered by agrin/Dok-7. We found tyrosine phosphorylation level of 36 proteins increased specifically by agrin stimulation. In Dok-7 mutant myotubes, however, 13 of the 36 proteins failed to be enhanced by agrin stimulation, suggesting that these 13 proteins are Dok-7-dependent tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, could work as downstream molecules of agrin/Dok-7 signaling. We validated one of the proteins, Anxa3, by in vitro and in vivo assays. Knocking down of Anxa3 in the cultured myotubes inhibited agrin-induced AChR clustering, whereas reduction of Anxa3 in mouse muscles induced abnormal postsynaptic development. Collectively, our phosphoproteomics analysis provides novel insights into the complicated signaling network downstream of agrin/Dok-7."

It is still unclear how much growth in adolescence is affected by pregnancy; therefore, this study was designed to study the association between prenatal serum concentrations of leptin, IGF-I, and estradiol and the increase in the height of a group of pregnant adolescents between the 28th week of gestation to one year postpartum. We conducted a cohort study from 2009 to 2017 in pregnant adolescents in their third trimester of pregnancy receiving prenatal care at Mexico's National Institute of Perinatology. Data on hormones, other covariates, and confounding variables were analyzed through bivariate analysis and then a linear univariate analysis. Our patients were an average of 15.5±1 years and gained an average of 9.5 mm during the study period. A Pearson's correlation showed a positive and significant height increase between height and leptin and IGF-I, and negative between height and estradiol. The general linear model (adjusted by age, bone age, gynecological age, parent's stature, breastfeeding, body fat, energy intake, and BMI) found that leptin and estradiol serum concentrations explained 39.6% of height increase; IGF-I did not have any predictive effect. Leptin and estradiol concentrations in the third trimester of pregnancy are associated with increased height in our group of teenage mothers. No effect association was observed between height and IGF-I concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W3005572372,"A hand-made, radiolucent, custom-designed device having a mobile and a non-mobile platforms was used to objectively quantify the in vivo cranial tibial translation, in order to assess the functional status of cranial-cruciate-ligament (CrCL) in dogs. The hypothesis was that changes in CrCL integrity would result in detectable changes in tibial translation. To validate the diagnostic method, data from injured (PA, n = 32), contralateral (CO, n = 32) and healthy stifles (HE, n = 32) were compared. Normalized tibial translation (ΔN) of each stifle was measured in medio-lateral radiographic projection obtained before and during standard thrust force application, in PA (43.59±12.97%), CO (20.32±6.69%) and HE (12.22±3.77%). Comparing PA with HE and CO (ΔN cut-off value: 29.73%), diagnosis could be issued with very high probability. Comparing HE with CO (ΔN cut-off value: 14.80%), high performance was obtained. The translator device could be a useful tool to objectively quantify the in vivo tibial translation in dogs with CrCL rupture, before surgery and during post-operatory follow-up."
