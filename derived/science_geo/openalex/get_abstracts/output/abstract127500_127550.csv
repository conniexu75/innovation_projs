https://openalex.org/W2580449060,"&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Background:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Anemia, a common complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD), has previously been attributed primarily to decreased production of erythropoietin. More recently, it has become apparent that the etiology of anemia involves several other factors, most notably dysfunctional iron metabolism, mediated via increased hepcidin activity and reduced clearance. Current management of anemia in patients with advanced CKD is based on erythropoiesis-stimulating agents and iron supplementation, along with red blood cell transfusions when necessary; however, safety considerations associated with these therapies highlight the need to pursue alternative treatment options targeting other mechanisms such as hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) that act as central regulators of erythropoiesis by coordinating a series of graded hypoxic responses. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Summary:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; This review discusses the discovery of the HIF pathway and its regulation via HIF prolyl hydroxylase enzymes in the context of erythropoiesis and iron metabolism. The rationale for targeting this pathway and the clinical development of HIF prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors are reviewed, with a commentary on the potential implications of this class of agents in CKD anemia management. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Key Messages:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Pharmacologic activation of the HIF pathway results in a transient pseudo-hypoxic state that stimulates erythropoiesis in CKD patients with anemia. Results from clinical studies of a number of HIF prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors are increasingly available and provide support for the continued evaluation of the risk-benefit ratio of this novel therapeutic approach to the treatment of anemia in CKD."
https://openalex.org/W1538903611,"The estrogen receptor (ER) is expressed in two forms, ERα and ERβ. Here we show that ERα and ERβ, expressed both in vitro and in vivo, form heterodimers which bind to DNA with an affinity (K d of approximately 2 nm) similar to that of ERα and greater than that of ERβ homodimers. Mutation analysis of the hormone binding domain of ERα suggests that the dimerization interface required to form heterodimers with ERβ is very similar but not identical to that required for homodimer formation. The heterodimer, like the homodimers, are capable of binding the steroid receptor coactivator-1 when bound to DNA and stimulating transcription of a reporter gene in transfected cells. Given the relative expression of ERα and ERβ in tissues and the difference in DNA binding activity between ERα/ERβ heterodimers and ERβ it seems likely that the heterodimer is functionally active in a subset of target cells.

Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis indicates that ERβ is highly expressed in prostate and ovary (1Mosselman S. Polman J. Dijkema R.

Carlsson B. Grandien K. Enmark E. Haggblad J. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J.-A. Endocrinology. 1997; 183: 863-870Crossref Scopus (4104) Google Scholar). The two receptors which share about 95% homology in the DNA binding domain and 55% homology in the ligand binding domain, both bind to a consensus estrogen response element (ERE) (4Tremblay G.B. Tremblay A. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Labrie F. Giguere V. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 353-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar) and exhibit similar ligand binding properties (3Kuiper G.G.J.M. Carlsson B. Grandien K. Enmark E. Haggblad J. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J.-A. Endocrinology. 1997; 183: 863-870Crossref Scopus (4104) Google Scholar). They are poorly conserved in the N-terminal domain but ERβ, like ERα, appears to contain a similar activation domain, activation function 1 (AF-1) sensitive to a mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (4Tremblay G.B.

Thus, although the relative expression of ERα and ERβ varies in cells, their ligand binding, DNA binding, and transactivation properties are rather similar to one another.Steroid hormone receptors usually bind to inverted DNA repeats as homodimers, although the glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors have been reported to form heterodimers, at least in vitro(11Parker M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 12Trapp T. Rupprecht R. Castren M. Reul J.M.H.M. Holsboer F. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1457-1462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). In the classically accepted model of steroid hormone action, the estrogen receptor is sequestered in an inactive state in a multiprotein complex in the absence of hormone (13Parker M.G. Litwack G. Vitamins & Hormones. Academic Press, San Diego1995: 267-287Google Scholar). Upon estrogen binding, the receptor forms homodimers which then interact with response elements in the vicinity of target genes and modulate rates of gene transcription. In view of the similarity of the ligand binding domain of ERα and ERβ we investigated the possibility that the two receptors may form functional heterodimers in target cells. ERα and ERβ were capable of forming heterodimers on DNA that could bind the coactivator, SRC-1, and appeared to stimulate transcription of a reporter gene. Moreover, we demonstrate that while the region of ERα required for homodimerization overlaps with that required for heterodimerization the two regions are not coincident.RESULTSThe DNA binding activity of ERα and ERβ was tested usingin vitro translated receptors and a consensus estrogen response element in a gel shift assay. Both ERα and ERβ bound to the element, and the mobility of ERα, but not that of ERβ, was retarded in the presence of the hERα antibody, H226 (Fig.1). When the two receptors were cotranslated we were able to detect a complex with an intermediate mobility corresponding to ERα/ERβ heterodimers, in addition to ERα homodimers (Fig. 1, tracks 7–12). Their mobility was retarded by H226 consistent with the presence of ERα in both complexes. Their relative amounts varied depending on the input ratio of the two receptors but it is noteworthy that ERβ homodimers were barely detected even when ERβ was expressed in 2-fold excess over ERα (Fig. 1, track 11). Their affinity for DNA was then determined by carrying out gel shift experiments over a wide range of probe concentrations (Fig. 2). We found that ERα homodimers and ERα/ERβ heterodimers bound to DNA with a similar K d of approximately 2 nm whereas that of ERβ homodimers was about 4-fold greater.Figure 2DNA binding affinity of ERα, ERβ, and ERα/ERβ heterodimers. In vitro translated ERα, ERβ, or both (at a ratio of 2:1 in favor of ERβ) were analyzed for DNA binding activity in a gel shift assay over the range of DNA concentrations indicated. Radiolabeled probe alone was used up to a concentration of 6 nm (2 ng), and higher concentrations were achieved by diluting the labeled probe with nonlabeled oligonucleotide, and the resultant reduction in specific activity was taken into account in the calculations. Gels were then scanned with a PhosphorImager, and the relative binding of the different dimeric states was plotted against the concentration of ERE. Scatchard analysis was then used to determine the K d for the different forms of receptor dimer.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next analyzed the DNA binding activity of ERα and ERβ when they were expressed in COS-1 cells. When ERα alone was expressed, we observed two complexes, a major upper complex, corresponding to the ERα homodimer, and an additional complex that is probably generated by proteolysis. It seems to lack N-terminal sequences since it is recognized by a monoclonal antibody specific for the C-terminal F region (21Le Douarin B. Pierrat B. vom Baur E. Chambon P. Losson R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 876-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Similar results have been reported previously (22Metzger D. Berry M. Ali S. Chambon P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 579-591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, the mobility of ERα but not ERβ was retarded in the presence of the specific hERα antibody, H226. When equivalent amounts of ERα and ERβ expression vector were coexpressed, heterodimers were the predominant form observed, and ERβ homodimers were not detected (Fig.3 A). We then used these extracts to compare the effect of 17β-estradiol and 4-hydroxytamoxifen on the DNA binding activity of the three dimeric forms (Fig. 3 B). As previously demonstrated for ERα (7Lees J.A. Fawell S.E. Parker M.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 5477-5488Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), the DNA binding activity of both ERβ and ERα/ERβ heterodimers was unaffected by ligand binding, but their mobilities were slightly increased in the presence of 17β-estradiol (Fig. 3 B,tracks 2, 5, and 8). Thus, we conclude that ERα/ERβ heterodimers, expressed in intact cells, are capable of forming on DNA and that ERα homodimers and ERα/ERβ heterodimers are preferentially formed.Figure 3ERα and ERβ, expressed in COS-1 cells, bind as heterodimers to DNA. Equal amounts of whole cell extracts, prepared from cells expressing ERα, ERβ, or both, were incubated with a 32P-labeled ERE in the presence or absence of H226 antibody (A) or different ligands (B). 17β-Estradiol or 4-hydroxytamoxifen were tested at 2 × 10−8m and 1 × 10−6m, respectively. When ERα alone was expressed, we observed two complexes, a major upper complex, corresponding to the ERα homodimer, and an additional complex that is probably generated by proteolysis. It seems to lack N-terminal sequences since it is recognized by a monoclonal antibody specific for the C-terminal F region (21Le Douarin B. Pierrat B. vom Baur E. Chambon P. Losson R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 876-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The position of the α/α homodimer, α/β heterodimer, and β/β homodimer is shown on the right-hand side.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Previous work with a series of ERα mutants has identified a region within the ligand binding domain of the estrogen receptor which is required for both receptor dimerization and high affinity DNA binding (15Fawell S.E. Lees J.A. White R. Parker M.G. Cell. 1990; 60: 953-962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). We have used these mutants to determine whether the region required to form homodimers with a truncated version of ERα (mouse estrogen receptor (MOR)-182–599) is similar to that required to form heterodimers with ERβ on DNA. We find that the ability of R507A to form either ERα homodimers or ERα/ERβ heterodimers is markedly reduced (Fig. 4, compare tracks 4 and 11) while L511R and I518R, which show negligible homodimer formation, retain some ability to form ERα/ERβ heterodimers (Fig. 4, compare tracks 6 with 13and 7 with 14). In contrast, mutation of Q510A had no affect on the dimerization of either receptor. A series of other mutations in this region of the receptor (A509R, L512V, L513G, I514R, L515G, L516A, H517A, R519G) was then screened to attempt to identify additional residues which could discriminate between homo- and heterodimerization, but all the mutants retained their DNA binding activity both as ERα homodimers and ERα/ERβ heterodimers (data not shown). We conclude that the region of ERα required for homodimerization overlaps that required for heterodimerization, but the two regions are not coincident.Figure 4DNA binding activity of wild-type, mutant ERα, and ERβ. The wild-type mouse ERα, MOR, and a series of mutants were cotranslated with either MOR-(182–599) (tracks 3–7) or ERβ (tracks 10–14) and tested for DNA binding activity using the gel shift assay. As controls, the wild type (tracks 1 and 8), truncated receptor MOR-(182–599) (track 2), and hERβ (track 9) were analyzed individually.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next assessed the transcriptional activity of ERα/ERβ heterodimers in transiently transfected COS-1 cells using the pEREBLCAT reporter gene. ERα and ERβ expression vectors were tested individually or in combination at a ratio of 1:1 or 1:2 to minimize the relative amount of ER homodimers formed (see Fig. 3). The ability of ERα to stimulate transcription was slightly greater than that of ERβ (Fig. 5 A), as previously reported for this reporter (4Tremblay G.B. Tremblay A. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Labrie F. Giguere V. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 353-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). Coexpression of ERα and ERβ resulted in an intermediate level of transcription that was blocked by the addition of the antiestrogens, 4-hydroxytamoxifen and ICI 182780. Similar results were obtained in HeLa cells (Fig. 5 B). Therefore, since the heterodimer is the major dimeric form of the receptor under these conditions, it appears to retain its ability to stimulate transcription.Figure 5Transcriptional activity of coexpressed ERα and ERβ. The ability of ERα and ERβ, expressed individually or in combination, to stimulate transcription of a reporter gene pEREBLCAT was tested by transient transfection in COS-1 (A) and HeLa cells (B). Transcriptional activity was determined in the absence or presence of 1 × 10−8m17β-estradiol (E 2), 1 × 10−7m 4-hydroxytamoxifen, and 1 × 10−7m ICI 182780 and corrected for the activity of the internal control pJ7lacZ. Activity of the reporter was also analyzed in the absence of transfected ER as a control (C). The error bars represent standard errors determined from two transfection experiments each carried out in duplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To obtain additional evidence to support our suggestion that ERα/ERβ heterodimers are capable of stimulating transcription we tested whether they were able to bind the coactivator, SRC-1, as previously demonstrated for ERα (10White R. Sjöberg M. Kalkhoven E. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1427-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and ERβ homodimers (4Tremblay G.B. Tremblay A. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Labrie F. Giguere V. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 353-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). This was achieved by analyzing the ability of the receptors, bound to DNA, to interact with a fragment of SRC-1, residues 570–780, that binds nuclear receptors in a ligand-dependent manner. 2E. Kalkhoven, data not shown. As shown in Fig.6, when ERα, ERβ, or both were incubated with increasing amounts of GST-SRC-(570–780) in the presence and absence of ligand we could detect additional complexes in the gel shift assay. The interaction of SRC-(570–780) with ERα was dependent on the presence of ligand (Fig. 6, compare tracks 7 and8) whereas there was an appreciable interaction with ERβ in the absence of ligand (Fig. 6, compare tracks 13 and14). The interaction of SRC-1 with the heterodimer was enhanced in the presence of ligand (Fig. 6, compare tracks 19 and 20). As a control, we showed that these retarded complexes were not due to the binding of SRC-1 directly to an ERE (Fig.6, tracks 1 and 2) but required the presence of receptor. Thus ERα/ERβ heterodimers, bound to DNA, are capable of recruiting SRC-1.Figure 6SRC-1 binds to ERα/ERβ heterodimers bound to DNA. Equal amounts of ERα, ERβ, and ERα/ERβ heterodimers were incubated with increasing amounts of GST-SRC-(570–780) in the presence or absence of 2 × 10−8m 17β-estradiol. As controls, GST-SRC-(570–780) was tested for its DNA binding activity in the absence of receptor. The position of receptors complexed with GST-SRC is indicated by solid arrowheads.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONThe main conclusion from our study is that human ERα and ERβ are capable of forming functional heterodimers on DNA. The relative distribution of ER homodimers and heterodimers will, at least in part, be dependent on the relative expression of the two receptors which varies widely in different cell types. Both ERα and ERβ have been detected in many tissues by reverse transcription-PCR or in situ hybridization (3Kuiper G.G.J.M. Carlsson B. Grandien K. Enmark E. Haggblad J. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J.-A. Endocrinology. 1997; 183: 863-870Crossref Scopus (4104) Google Scholar, 23Shughrue P.J. Komm B. Merchenthaler I. Steroids. 1996; 61: 678-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) but the relative amounts of receptor protein in specific cell types have yet to be determined. Nevertheless this preliminary analysis suggests that the expression of ERα may be greater than that of ERβ in epididymis, testis, pituitary ovary, uterus, adrenals, and heart. Given that ERα homodimers and ERα/ERβ heterodimers are preferentially formed over ERβ homodimers it seems that heterodimers are more likely to be formed than ERβ homodimers in these tissues. On the other hand, ERβ is expressed at higher levels in prostate, bladder, lung, thymus, and certain hypothalamic cells (3Kuiper G.G.J.M. Carlsson B. Grandien K. Enmark E. Haggblad J. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J.-A. Endocrinology. 1997; 183: 863-870Crossref Scopus (4104) Google Scholar, 23Shughrue P.J. Komm B. Merchenthaler I. Steroids. 1996; 61: 678-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), and so ERβ homodimers may be formed in these tissues.The molecular basis for the reduced DNA binding activity of ERβ compared with that of ERα and ERα/ERβ heterodimers is unclear, but recent work indicates that the mouse ERβ also binds to an ERE less strongly than ERα (4Tremblay G.B. Tremblay A. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Labrie F. Giguere V. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 353-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). Differences in the DNA binding domains of the two receptors are unlikely to account for the variation since they differ by only two residues (1Mosselman S. Polman J. Dijkema R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (2037) Google Scholar, 2Kuiper G.G.J.M. Enmark E. Pelto-Huikko M. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J.-A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5925-5930Crossref PubMed Scopus (4196) Google Scholar), neither of which seems to be in a position that is likely to affect its DNA binding properties (24Schwabe J.W.R. Chapman L. Finch J.T. Rhodes D. Cell. 1993; 75: 567-578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). An alternative possibility is that the receptors differ in their ability to dimerize. The major dimer interface in ERα has been mapped to a region of the hormone binding domain (15Fawell S.E. Lees J.A. White R. Parker M.G. Cell. 1990; 60: 953-962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 25Kumar V. Chambon P. Cell. 1988; 55: 145-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar) which is conserved and likely to correspond to helix 10 in nuclear receptors (26Wurtz J.-M. Bourguet W. Renaud J.-P. Vivat V. Chambon P. Moras D. Gronemeyer H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the ligand binding domain of RXR also indicates that the dimer interface comprises this helix and, to a lesser extent, helix 9 and the loop between helix 7 and 8 (27Bourguet W. Ruff M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 375: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). Comparison of the sequence of the corresponding region in ERα and ERβ indicates that helix 10 is similar (13/18 residues are identical) but the loop region and helix 9 are poorly conserved in the two receptors. Thus, it seems likely that the residues required to form the dimer interface in ERα and ERβ homodimers are distinct. Although the precise dimerization interfaces in these receptors have yet to be identified, functional analysis of a series of mutations in helix 10 of ERα indicates that the residues required for the formation of ERα homodimers are similar but not identical to those required for ERα/ERβ heterodimerization.Both ERα and ERβ are capable of stimulating the transcription of reporter genes in transfected cells and the activation functions, AF-1 and AF-2 characterized in ERα (5Bunone G.

Steroid Biochem. 1989; 34: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), appear to be conserved in ERβ (4Tremblay G.B. Tremblay A. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Labrie F. Giguere V. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 353-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). When ERα and ERβ are expressed, under conditions when heterodimers are the predominant dimeric species, transcription of an ERE reporter gene is stimulated to an intermediate level compared with that of either homodimer suggesting that ERα/ERβ heterodimers are transcriptionally active. This is supported by our observation that ERα/ERβ heterodimers are capable of binding the coactivator SRC-1 (9Onate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1995; 270: 1354-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2042) Google Scholar, 29Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.-C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1996; 85: 403-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar). We found that SRC-1 interacts with all three dimeric states of ER bound to DNA although its interaction with heterodimers was less dependent on ligand than that observed with ERα homodimers. The interaction of ERβ homodimers with SRC-1 was dependent on ligand in solution (4Tremblay G.B. Tremblay A. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Labrie F. Giguere V. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 353-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar) 3S. M. Cowley, S. Hoare, S. Mosselman, and M. G. Parker, unpublished observations. but not on DNA and, consistent with this, SRC-1 was found to augment the transcriptional activity of ERβ in the absence of ligand (4Tremblay G.B. Tremblay A. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Labrie F. Giguere V. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 353-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). Finally, the ability of the heterodimer to stimulate transcription was blocked by the antiestrogens, 4-hydroxytamoxifen and ICI 182780, as previously demonstrated for ER homodimers (4Tremblay G.B. Tremblay A. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Labrie F. Giguere V. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 353-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar, 7Lees J.A. Fawell S.E. Parker M.G.

EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2811-2818Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar).The discovery of a second estrogen receptor raises many questions, most notably relating to their respective functions. The ability of ERα and ERβ to form heterodimers suggests that estrogen receptor may function in different dimeric states, and it is possible that they could be activated by selective ligands. In view of the similarity of their DNA binding domains it is doubtful whether different forms bind to distinct response elements, but they could activate different genes in different target cells given their distinct expression patterns. Estrogen receptors (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ER, estrogen receptor; ERE, estrogen response element; AF-1, activation function 1; AF-2, activation function 2; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MOR, mouse estrogen receptor; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; SRC-1, steroid receptor coactivator 1; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. 1The abbreviations used are: ER, estrogen receptor; ERE, estrogen response element; AF-1, activation function 1; AF-2, activation function 2; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MOR, mouse estrogen receptor; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; SRC-1, steroid receptor coactivator 1; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase.were recently shown to be encoded by two distinct genes,ERα and ERβ (1Mosselman S.

Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis indicates that ERβ is highly expressed in prostate and ovary (1Mosselman S. Polman J. Dijkema R.

Carlsson B. Grandien K. Enmark E. Haggblad J. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J.-A. Endocrinology. 1997; 183: 863-870Crossref Scopus (4104) Google Scholar). The two receptors which share about 95% homology in the DNA binding domain and 55% homology in the ligand binding domain, both bind to a consensus estrogen response element (ERE) (4Tremblay G.B.

They are poorly conserved in the N-terminal domain but ERβ, like ERα, appears to contain a similar activation domain, activation function 1 (AF-1) sensitive to a mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (4Tremblay G.B.

We observe the activation of three stress-inducible mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases in these tissues: p38 MAP kinase and the 46- and 55-kDa isoforms of Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK46 and JNK55). The heart and kidney show distinct time courses in the activation of p38 MAP kinase during ischemia but no activation of either JNK46 or JNK55. These two tissues also respond differently to ischemia/reperfusion. In the heart we observe activation of JNK55 and p38 MAP kinase, whereas in the kidney all three kinases are active. We also examined the expression pattern of two stress-responsive genes, c-Jun and ATF3. Our results indicate that in the heart both genes are induced by ischemia and ischemia/reperfusion. However, in the kidney c-Jun and ATF3 expression is induced only by ischemia/reperfusion. To correlate these molecular events with tissue damage we examined DNA laddering, a common marker of apoptosis. A significant increase in DNA laddering was evident in both heart and kidney following ischemia/reperfusion and correlated with the pattern of kinase activation, supporting a link between stress kinase activation and apoptotic cell death in these tissues. In this report we investigate the molecular mechanisms that contribute to tissue damage following ischemia and ischemia coupled with reperfusion (ischemia/reperfusion) in the rat heart and kidney.

Ischemia and ischemia coupled with reperfusion (ischemia/reperfusion) in the heart and kidney result in cell death and scar formation in these tissues, which can ultimately lead to congestive heart failure or renal failure and death. Recent studies in heart tissue, both in vitro and in vivo, suggest that cell death upon reperfusion is largely apoptotic in nature (1Gottlieb R.A. Burleson K.O. Kloner R.A. Babior B.M. Engler R.L. J.

Cell Death & Differ. 1995; 2: 235-241PubMed Google Scholar).In vivo studies demonstrated that apoptosis following occlusion of the coronary artery in the rat is the major contributing factor to myocardial damage after the insult. Subsequently, necrosis occurs and contributes to the progressive loss of cardiomyocytes with time after infarction (5Kajstura J. Cheng W. Reiss K. Clark W.A. Sonnenblick E.H. Krajewski S. Reed J.C. Olivetti G. Anversa P. Lab. Invest. 1996; 74: 86-107PubMed Google Scholar). Apoptotic cell death also appears to play a role in hypertrophy of cardiac tissue in response to pressure overload (6Teiger E. Dam T.-V. Richard L. Wisnewsky C. Tea B.-S. Gaboury L. Tremblay J.

The occurrence of apoptotic cell death in renal tissue has also been demonstrated following brief periods of ischemia and subsequent reperfusion (8Schumer M. Colombel M.C. Sawczuk I.S. Gobe G. Connor J. O'Toole K.M.O. Olsson C.A. Wise G.J. Buttyan R. Am. J. Pathol. 1992; 140: 831-838PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms by which ischemia and ischemia/reperfusion lead to cell death and eventually to tissue damage have not yet been defined. Recent studies suggest that members of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) 1The abbreviations used are: MAP, mitogen-activated protein; JNK, Jun N-terminal kinase; DTT, dithiothreitol. kinase family, in particular Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), are activated in the heart and kidney following ischemia and reperfusion of these tissues (9Knight R.J.

Therefore, this kinase signaling pathway may be an important molecular component responsible for tissue injury following ischemia and ischemia/reperfusion in the heart and kidney. However, the role of individual isoforms of JNK or the role of p38 MAP kinase has not been addressed. The MAP kinase family, members of which are characterized as proline-directed serine/threonine-protein kinases, can be divided into three subgroups: the extracellular signal-regulated kinases, JNKs (also referred to as stress-activated protein kinases), and p38 MAP kinases. These kinase pathways are distinguished by activating signals, substrate specificity, and cellular responses (for review, see Refs.11Davis R.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 470-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar, 12Cano E. Mahadevan L.C. Trends Biochem.

While the extracellular signal-regulated kinases are predominantly activated by growth factors, the JNKs and p38 MAP kinases are activated by stress signals such as inflammatory cytokines, heat shock, ultraviolet light, and ischemia (9Knight R.J.

Because JNKs and p38 MAP kinases are generally activated by the same stress signals, they have been collectively referred to as the stress kinases. Two members of the JNK family (JNK1 (46 kDa) and JNK2 (55 kDa)) were initially identified as kinases with high affinity for the transcription factor c-Jun. JNKs phosphorylate c-Jun on specific N-terminal serine residues (Ser-63 and Ser-73) and enhance the ability of c-Jun to activate expression of genes containing c-Jun-responsive promoter elements (14Kyriakis J.M.

Additional substrates for JNKs have been defined since their first identification; the substrates include ATF2 and Elk-1 (21Cavigelli M. Dolfi F. Claret F.-X. Karin M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5957-5964Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 22Gupta S. Campbell D. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1339) Google Scholar). Recently, at least 10 isoforms of JNK have been identified, which correspond to alternatively spliced variants derived from three genes. These JNK isoforms differ in their interaction with substrate proteins in vitro, suggesting that these isoforms may play specific roles in vivo (23Gupta S. Barrett T. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J.

However, specific activation of individual isoforms in vivohas not been demonstrated to date. Multiple isoforms of p38 MAP kinase have also been identified (24Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C.

Although p38 MAP kinases and JNKs are activated by similar stress signals, the kinase cascade leading to the activation of p38 MAP kinases is distinct from the kinase cascade leading to the activation of JNKs (for review, see Ref. 28Woodgett J.R. Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Zon L.I. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond-Biol. Sci. 1996; 351: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the substrate specificity of p38 MAP kinase, although not well defined, is distinct from that of JNKs: p38 MAP kinase phosphorylates mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase-2 and -3 and CHOP, which are not substrates for JNKs (29Rouse J.

A number of recent studies have indicated an important role for the stress kinases (JNKs and p38 MAP kinase) in stress-induced apoptosis (32Chen Y.-R. Meyer C.F. Tan T.-H. J. Biol.

Furthermore, one of the major JNK substrates, c-Jun, has been implicated to be important in neuronal apoptosis (36Estus S. Zaks W.J. Freeman R.S. Gruda M. Bravo R. Johnson E.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1717-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar,37Ham J. Babji C. Whitfield J. Pfarr C.M. Lallemand D. Yaniv M. Rubin L.L. Neuron. 1995; 14: 927-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). In light of these observations, we examined the patterns of stress kinase activation in ischemic and ischemic/reperfused heart and kidney. Our results demonstrate specific patterns of stress kinase activation in these injured tissues. Furthermore, we observe a strong correlation between stress kinase activation, increased expression of stress kinase responsive genes, and initiation of apoptotic cell death. These results provide insight into the molecular events leading to tissue injury following ischemia/reperfusion. Their implications with respect to the tissue-specific patterns of injury progression are discussed. Antibodies specific for phosphorylated p38 MAP kinase (catalog number 9211S) were purchased from New England Biolabs and used at 1 μg/ml for Western blot analysis. Anti-p38 MAP kinase C-terminal antibodies (catalog number sc-535) and anti-JNK antibodies (catalog number sc-571) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., and 0.5 μg/ml was used for Western blot analysis. The ECL kit for Western blot analysis was obtained from Amersham Life Science. GST·c-Jun (amino acids 1–223) protein was produced inEscherichia coli and purified using glutathione-Sepharose-4B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with heparin (5000 IU/kg, body weight intraperitoneally) and then were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (75 mg/kg, body weight, intraperitoneally). The hearts were excised and were placed in ice-cold Krebs-Henseleit buffer (containing 118 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 25 mmNaHCO3, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 5 mmglucose). Each heart was immediately cannulated at the aorta, and perfusion was initiated with oxygenated (95% O2, 5% CO2) Krebs-Henseleit buffer (37 °C) at a constant pressure of 75 mm Hg. Hearts were perfused for 30 min with Krebs-Henseleit buffer for equilibration. At this point hearts were subjected to global ischemia for 20 or 45 min and then were reperfused for a designated period of time. At the end of the experiment, the hearts were freeze-clamped, and the frozen tissue was pulverized and was stored at −70 °C. Purpose-bred mongrel dogs (Barton's West End Farms, Oxford, NJ) were anesthetized (pentobarbital sodium, 30 mg/kg intravenously), intubated, and ventilated with room air. Arterial blood gases and pH were maintained within normal limits by intravenous infusion of bicarbonate and adjustment of the ventilation rate. Rectal temperature was maintained within ±0.5 °C of base-line temperature. Cannulas were inserted into a femoral artery and vein for obtaining arterial blood samples and administering bicarbonate and supplemental doses of pentobarbital, respectively. Arterial pressure was measured with a pressure transducer cannula (Millar Instruments, Inc., Houston, TX) inserted into the aortic arch via the contralateral femoral artery. The thorax was opened at the left fifth intercostal space, and a pericardial cradle was created. Left ventricular pressure and its first derivative (dP/dt) were measured with a Millar catheter inserted into the left ventricular chamber through an apical stab wound. Hemodynamic signals were monitored continuously with a strip chart recorder and a digital data acquisition system (Modular Instruments, Inc., Malvern, PA). A short segment of the left anterior descending coronary artery was isolated distal to its first major branch. After allowing hemodynamic stabilization for at least 30 min, the experimental protocol was initiated. Regional myocardial ischemia was achieved by occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery for 60 min followed by reperfusion for an additional 60 min. The presence of an ischemic insult was verified by a discernible darkening of the myocardial surface circumscribed by the epicardial coronary vasculature distal to the occlusion site. Transmural myocardial biopsy samples (∼10–20 mg) were obtained serially from the core of the ischemic region with a 14-gauge biopsy needle (Tru-Cut, Baxter, Deerfield, IL) at base line (i.e.preischemia), at the end of the ischemic period, and at 2, 5, 10, 11, 22, 26, 30, and 60 min of reperfusion. All samples were obtained from distal to proximal in the perfusion bed to minimize potential confounding effects of localized disruption of blood flow to regions distal to the sampling sites. Additional control tissue specimens were acquired from the nonischemic cardiac region perfused by the left circumflex coronary artery at base line, at the end of ischemia, and at various times during the reperfusion period. Myocardial tissue samples were removed from the needle, rinsed with saline, and quickly (within ∼10 s) frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen samples were stored at −70 °C until the time of assay. All experiments were performed in male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing between 300 and 500 g. Following induction of anesthesia (Inactin, 100 mg/kg intraperitoneally), the left kidney was exposed via a flank incision, and left renal artery occlusion was performed using an atraumatic vascular clamp. Reperfusion was achieved by removing the clamp. The effect of varying the duration of reperfusion was assessed by occluding the renal artery for 60 min and then reperfusing the kidney for indicated periods. The right kidney served as a nonischemic control. Rats were sacrificed upon completion of either ischemia or ischemia/reperfusion, and kidneys were immediately removed and were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen. All renal tissues were then kept at −70 °C until further assay. A powder of frozen heart and kidney tissues was prepared using a mortar and pestle. For homogenization, 100 mg of tissue powder was weighed out and was homogenized in 1 ml of buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.2 mm sodium vanadate, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm benzamidine, 1 mm DTT, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.2 mmpefabloc SC) using a Dounce homogenizer. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), and the supernatant was stored in aliquots at −70 °C. In gel kinase assays were performed as described previously (38Cano E. Hazzalin C.A. Mahadevan L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7352-7362Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Proteins (80 μg/sample) extracted from heart and kidney tissues were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel that had been polymerized in the presence of 50 μg/ml GST·c-Jun (amino acids 1–223). After electrophoresis, the gel was washed five times for 10 min with 60 ml of buffer A (20% isopropyl alcohol in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)) to remove SDS. Next, the gel was washed five times for 10 min with 60 ml of buffer B (1 mm DTT, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)). To denature proteins, the gel was incubated with 60 ml of buffer C (6m guanidine HCl, 20 mm DTT, 2 mmEDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)) for 1 h at room temperature with shaking. Finally, the gel was incubated in 300 ml of buffer D (1 mm DTT, 2 mm EDTA, 0.05% Tween 20, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)) for 16 h at 4 °C to renature proteins. For the kinase assay, the gel was first equilibrated with kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 20 mmMgCl2, 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 20 mm p-nitrophenylphosphate, 2 mm DTT, 0.2 mm sodium vanadate) for 1 h at room temperature with shaking. The kinase assay was initiated by adding 10 ml of kinase buffer containing 20 mm ATP and 10 μCi/ml of [γ-32P]ATP, and the gel was incubated at 30 °C for 60 min with shaking. The gel was washed several times with 5% trichloroacetic acid and 1% sodium pyrophosphate to remove free radioactivity, followed by drying and autoradiography. The procedures for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were described previously (39Yin T. Keller S.R. Quelle F.W. Witthuhn B.A. Tsang M.L.-S. Lienhard G.E. Ihle J.N. Yang Y.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20497-20502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In short, proteins (500 μg/sample) extracted from heart and kidney tissues were incubated with 2 μg of anti-p38 MAP kinase C-terminal antibodies at 4 °C for 2 h with rotation. Protein A-agarose beads (20 μl/sample) were then added to each sample and incubated for an additional 40 min at 4 °C with rotation. The immune complexes precipitated with protein A-agarose were washed four times with buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm sodium vanadate, 0.2 mm pefabloc SC, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm sodium fluoride, and 0.1% Triton X-100. The immunoprecipitates were immobilized on polyvinylidene difluoride membrane after separation on 10% SDS-PAGE. The membrane was immunoblotted with anti-phospho-p38 MAP kinase antibodies using the ECL method to evaluate tyrosine phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase. The same membrane was then reblotted with anti-p38 MAP kinase antibodies after stripping to verify that equivalent amounts of p38 MAP kinase protein were loaded in each lane. Ischemic and ischemic/reperfused hearts were obtained from rats as described previously (40Chen B.P.C. Wolfgang C.D. Hai T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1157-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Ischemic and ischemic/reperfused kidneys were obtained as described above. The tissues were frozen in isopentane prechilled with liquid nitrogen and kept at −70 °C until further assay. In situhybridization was carried out using ATF3 or c-Jun antisense RNA probes as described previously (40Chen B.P.C. Wolfgang C.D. Hai T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1157-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated using a guanidium isothiocyanate and organic extraction method as outlined by the manufacturer (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO). 5 μg of total RNA was loaded onto a 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel, transferred to Hybond membrane (Amersham), UV-cross-linked, hybridized to 32P-labeled rat c-Jun or rat ATF3 partial cDNAs using QuikHyb (Stratagene), and washed at high stringency as outlined by the manufacturer. The pulverized tissues from rat heart and kidney were lysed with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, and 100 mm NaCl) and digested in lysis buffer containing 1 mg/ml of protease K at 55 °C for 16 h. DNA was then extracted with Isoquik rapid DNA isolation kit (ORCA Research Inc., Bothell, WA) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the concentration was determined based on absorbance at 260 nm. For visualization of DNA laddering, DNA (1 μg/sample) was labeled at room temperature for 10–15 min using 5 units of Klenow fragment (NEB 212) in a total volume of 10 μl containing 0.5 μCi of [α-32P]dATP. The labeled DNA was then subjected to electrophoresis on a 1 or 1.8% agarose gel. The gels were fixed with 10% acetic acid for 2 h at room temperature followed by drying, or the DNA was transferred to nylon membranes and UV-cross-linked followed by baking at 80 °C for 1 h. The dried gels and membranes were then autoradiographed for periods ranging from 2 h to overnight as indicated in Fig. 8.Figure 1Activation of JNK in ischemic and ischemic/reperfused rat and dog heart. A, in gel kinase assay of extracts from control rat hearts or rat hearts subjected to ischemia (45 min) or ischemia/reperfusion for the indicated times. Aliquots of extracts containing 80 μg of protein were loaded on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel polymerized in the presence of GST·c-Jun (amino acids 1–223). B, Western blot analysis of the protein levels of JNK isoforms. Aliquots of samples as described inA were resolved on a regular 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by immunoblot using anti-JNK antibodies (0.5 μg/ml) that react with both JNK46 and JNK55 to estimate the protein levels of the isoforms.

DNAs from control, ischemic, and ischemic/reperfused heart (A) and kidney (B) were isolated, and 1 μg of DNA/sample was labeled with radioisotope as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, the labeled DNAs were analyzed on 1% agarose gel transferred to a nylon membrane, UV-cross-linked, and autoradiographed overnight. B, the labeled DNAs were resolved on a 1.8% agarose gel, fixed with acetic acid, dried, and autoradiographed for 2 h.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Isolated rat hearts were subject to global ischemia for either 20 or 45 min prior to reperfusion. Individual hearts were reperfused for various periods ranging from 1 min to 3 h. Extracts from the hearts were then prepared, and stress kinase activity was measured by either in gel kinase assay using c-Jun (amino acids 1–223) as a substrate, or Western blotting using phospho-specific antibodies. Neither JNK46 nor JNK55 activity, measured by in gel kinase assay, was detectable in control hearts or in hearts subjected to ischemia for either 20 min (data not shown) or 45 min (Fig. 1 A). However, JNK55 activity was detectable within 1 min following reperfusion; it continued to increase, reaching maximal activity at approximately 1 h postreperfusion. Significant levels of JNK55 activity were still present at 3 h postreperfusion. Interestingly, no significant levels of JNK46 activity were detectable upon reperfusion of the heart until 1 h postreperfusion, when some weak JNK46activity was evident. The lack of significant JNK46activation in the heart was not a consequence of the absence of JNK46 expression, because JNK46 protein was readily detectable by Western analysis using an antibody recognizing both isoforms (Fig. 1 B). Furthermore, the Western analysis confirmed that similar levels of JNK were present in all samples. This result indicates that there is a preferential activation of JNK55 in the isolated heart following reperfusion. The preferential activation of JNK55 was confirmed in vivo by examining JNK activation in dog heart tissue following ischemia/reperfusion (Fig. 1 C). Small biopsies of cardiac tissue were removed from the exposed dog heart in vivo prior to ischemia and at the indicated time points following ischemia and reperfusion. The profile of JNK activation is essentially identical to that observed in the isolated rat heart. However, the peak in JNK55 activity appears to be reached sooner in vivo. Preferential activation of a JNK isoform in tissues has not been reported previously, and these observations may suggest a specific role for a JNK55 in the heart. p38 MAP kinase activity was measured by Western analysis using anti-phospho-p38 antibodies (Fig.2 A). In a parallel experiment, p38 MAP kinase protein levels were measured by Western analysis using an anti-p38 antibody to ensure that similar levels of p38 MAP kinase protein were present in all samples (Fig. 2 B). No detectable p38 MAP kinase activity was present in control hearts. However, consistent with the recent report by Bogoyevitch et al.(41Bogoyevitch M.A. Gillespie-Brown J. Ketterman A.J. Fuller S.J. Ben-Levy R. Ashworth A. Marshall C.J. Sugden P.H. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 162-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar), p38 MAP kinase was activated in the heart subjected to 20 min of ischemia (Fig. 2 B, right part). This activation was transient, because p38 MAP kinase activity was not detectable after 45 min of ischemia (Fig. 2 A, left part). Significantly, upon reperfusion following 45 min of ischemia, p38 MAP kinase was rapidly reactivated: the kinase activity was detectable within 1 min postreperfusion, reached a maximal level at approximately 15 min, and returned to a low level within 3 h. We conclude that in the ischemic heart, p38 MAP kinase is transiently activated. Independent of the time of ischemia, p38 MAP kinase is active upon reperfusion. Rat kidneys, in vivo, were made ischemic by ligation of the renal artery for 1 h. Kidneys were reperfused for various periods ranging from 5 min to 3 h. Extracts were then prepared from the treated kidney or control (i.e. contralateral) kidney. JNK activity was measured by in gel kinase analysis. As observed in the heart, no JNK activity was detectable in the control kidneys or in the ischemic kidney. Upon reperfusion, however, both JNK46 and JNK55 were activated within 10 min, unlike in the heart where JNK55 was preferentially activated. The activities of both kinases were high for approximately 90 min and returned to near basal level by 2 h (Fig.3 A). Therefore, the pattern of JN"

Here, we present a cell culture model capable of expressing Tf mRNA in an oxygen-dependent manner. A 4-kilobase pair Tf promoter/enhancer fragment as well as the 300-base pair liver-specific Tf enhancer alone conveyed hypoxia responsiveness to a heterologous reporter gene construct in hepatoma but not HeLa cells. Within this enhancer, a 32-base pair hypoxia-responsive element was identified, which contained two hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) binding sites (HBSs). Mutation analysis showed that both HBSs function as oxygen-regulated enhancers in Tf-expressing as well as in non-Tf-expressing cell lines. Mutation of both HBSs was necessary to completely abolish hypoxic reporter gene activation. Transient co-expression of the two HIF-1 subunits HIF-1α and aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT)/HIF-1β resulted in enhanced reporter gene expression even under normoxic conditions. Overexpression of a dominant-negative ARNT/HIF-1β mutant reduced hypoxic activation. DNA binding studies using nuclear extracts from the mouse hepatoma cell line Hepa1 and the ARNT/HIF-1β-deficient subline Hepa1C4, as well as antibodies raised against HIF-1α and ARNT/HIF-1β confirmed that HIF-1 binds the Tf HBSs. Mutation analysis and competition experiments suggested that the 5′ HBS was more efficient in binding HIF-1 than the 3′ HBS. Finally, hypoxic induction of endogenous Tf mRNA was abrogated in Hepa1C4 cells, confirming that HIF-1 confers oxygen regulation of Tf gene expression by binding to the two HBSs present in the Tf enhancer.

Iron is an essential trace metal in all living organisms. Both iron overload and iron depletion can severely affect physiological processes such as development, erythropoiesis, or biochemical metabolism (reviewed in Refs. 1Bonkovsky H.L. Am. J. Med. Sci. 1991; 301: 32-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar and 2Finch C. Blood. 1994; 84: 1697-1702Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The liver represents the major organ of iron storage in the body and is most susceptible to injuries due to iron overload (1Bonkovsky H.L. Am. J. Med. Sci. 1991; 301: 32-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Thus, iron hemostasis has to be tightly balanced, and, as a consequence, free iron occurs only transiently in the serum. When iron is absorbed from the small intestine into the blood, it immediately binds apotransferrin to form transferrin (Tf) 1The abbreviations used are: Tf, transferrin; AhR, aryl hydrocarbon receptor; ARNT, AhR nuclear translocator; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; Epo, erythropoietin; HBS, HIF-1 binding site; HIF, hypoxia-inducible factor; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase pair(s). 1The abbreviations used are: Tf, transferrin; AhR, aryl hydrocarbon receptor; ARNT, AhR nuclear translocator; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; Epo, erythropoietin; HBS, HIF-1 binding site; HIF, hypoxia-inducible factor; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase pair(s)., which is then transported by the plasma to all tissues of the vertebrate's body. Delivery of iron occurs by binding of Tf to the Tf receptor followed by endocytosis. In erythroblasts, iron is primarily required for heme synthesis in mitochondria. Tissue-specific expression of the Tf gene is controlled by distinct positive and negative regulatory elements located 5′ to the transcription initiation site. Apart from the promoter, the best studied element within this region is the −3600/−3300 enhancer (hereafter referred to as the Tf enhancer). Thiscis-acting element enhances the activity of the Tf promoter in human Hep3B hepatoma cells in a tissue-specific manner (3Boissier F. Augé-Gouillou C. Schaeffer E. Zakin M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9822-9828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Sawaya B.E. Aunis D. Schaeffer E. J. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 43: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Studies in Hep3B and HeLa cells revealed that multiple liver-enriched and ubiquitous factors interact with the Tf enhancer (3Boissier F. Augé-Gouillou C. Schaeffer E. Zakin M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9822-9828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Augé-Gouillou C. Petropoulos I. Zakin M.M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 323: 4-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 6Petropoulos I. Augé-Gouillou C. Zakin M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24220-24225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Tf enhancer, however, is inactive in Tf-expressing neuronal and Sertoli cells (4Sawaya B.E. Aunis D. Schaeffer E. J. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 43: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 5Augé-Gouillou C. Petropoulos I. Zakin M.M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 323: 4-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Hypoxia, a reduction in oxygen concentration, is increasingly recognized as an important regulator of gene expression (reviewed in Ref. 7Bunn H.F. Poyton R.O. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 839-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar). The best established example of oxygen-regulated gene expression is provided by the erythropoietic growth factor erythropoietin (Epo, reviewed in Ref. 8Jelkmann W. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72: 449-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar). The two human hepatoma cell lines HepG2 and Hep3B are so far the only permanent cell culture models available to investigate oxygen-regulated Epo expression (9Goldberg M.A. Glass G.A. Cunningham J.M. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7972-7976Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Apart from Epo, we recently demonstrated hypoxic induction of several acute phase genes in HepG2 cells (10Wenger R.H. Rolfs A. Marti H.H. Bauer C. Gassmann M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27865-27870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Acute phase reactants are liver-derived serum proteins whose production is induced by proinflammatory cytokines (reviewed in Ref. 11Heinrich P.C. Castell J.V. Andus T. Biochem. J. 1990; 165: 621-636Crossref Scopus (2262) Google Scholar). Tf expression was of particular interest since this protein is one of the rare examples of acute phase reactants that are down-regulated during the acute phase response in both human serum and HepG2 cells (11Heinrich P.C. Castell J.V. Andus T. Biochem. J. 1990; 165: 621-636Crossref Scopus (2262) Google Scholar). In contrast, we found a marked increase in Tf transcription following hypoxic (1% O2) culture of HepG2 cells (10Wenger R.H. Rolfs A. Marti H.H. Bauer C. Gassmann M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27865-27870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), suggesting that different signaling pathways are mediating the effects of these two stimuli. Given that the erythroid marrow uses more than 80% of plasma iron (2Finch C. Blood. 1994; 84: 1697-1702Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and considering that hypoxia increases erythropoiesis, it is conceivable that an increase in plasma iron transport capacity is required for hypoxia-induced Epo-mediated erythropoiesis. Indeed, hypoxia was shown to increase iron absorption (12Mendel G.A. Blood. 1961; 18: 727-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and hypoxic up-regulation of Tf serum protein concentrations has previously been found in mice (13Simpson R.J. Ann. Hematol. 1992; 65: 260-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and rats (14Colehour J.K. Borsook H. Graybiel A. Am. J. Physiol. 1957; 191: 113-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 15Osterloh K.R.S. Simpson R.J. Snape S. Peters T.J. Blut. 1987; 55: 421-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) exposed to hypobaric hypoxia (0.5 atm) for 1–3 days. Although some of these experiments were established some 40 years ago, the molecular mechanisms leading to hypoxically enhanced Tf expression have not been unraveled so far, mainly due to the lack of a suitable cell culture model. The hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) was originally identified by its ability to bind to a hypoxia-responsive cis-element located 3′ to the Epo gene (16Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (2137) Google Scholar). HIF-1 is a heterodimer consisting of an α and a β subunit, both belonging to the basic-helix-loop-helix-Per-AhR/ARNT-Sim family of transcription factors (17Wang G.L. Jiang B.-H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (4928) Google Scholar). Whereas the α subunit is a novel member of this family, the β subunit is identical to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) known to heterodimerize with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor/dioxin receptor (AhR) following ligand binding (reviewed in Refs. 7Bunn H.F. Poyton R.O. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 839-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar and 18Wenger R.H. Gassmann M. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 609-616PubMed Google Scholar). We have established cell culture models to study oxygen-dependent Tf expression and have subsequently analyzed the regulation of the Tf enhancer. Our results demonstrate the presence of two HIF-1 binding sites (HBSs) within the Tf enhancer and show that binding of HIF-1 to these sites confers oxygen-regulated Tf gene expression. The human hepatoma cell lines Hep3B and HepG2 were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC numbers HB-8064 and HB-8065, respectively). The mouse hepatoma cell lines Hepa1 (also termed Hepa1c1c7) and Hepa1C4 (19Gradin K. McGuire J. Wenger R.H. Kvietikova I. Whitelaw M.L. Toftgård R. Tora L. Gassmann M. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5221-5231Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) were kind gifts of L. Poellinger (Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden). All cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose, Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Boehringer Mannheim), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 1 × non-essential amino acids, 2 mml-glutamine, and 1 mmsodium pyruvate (all Life Technologies, Inc.) in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Oxygen tensions in the incubator (Forma Scientific, model 3319) were either 140 mm Hg (20% O2, v/v, normoxia) or 7 mm Hg (1% O2, v/v, hypoxia). Cells were subjected to hypoxic induction at a cell density of 2 × 105 cells/cm2. The human epitheloid carcinoma cell line HeLaS3 (ATCC CCL-2.2) was cultured in suspension in Ham's F-12 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented as described above. Hypoxic induction was achieved as described elsewhere (20Jiang B.-H. Semenza G.L. Bauer C. Marti H.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1172-C1180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, HeLaS3 cells were incubated at a density of 1 × 107 cells/ml in an IL 237 tonometer (Instrumentation Laboratory) under continuous stirring for 4 h at 37 °C using gas mixtures of either 20% O2, 5% CO2, and 75% N2 (normoxia), or 1% O2, 5% CO2 and 94% N2 (hypoxia) at a flow rate of 500 ml/min. Immediately following stimulation, RNA was isolated as described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (21Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162 (2nd Ed.): 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). Total RNA (10 μg) was denatured in formamide/formaldehyde and electrophoresed through a 1% agarose gel containing 6% formaldehyde as described (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Following pressure blotting (Stratagene) to nylon membranes (Biodyne A, Pall) and UV cross-linking (Stratalinker, Stratagene), the filters were hybridized to cDNA probes labeled with [α-32P]dCTP to a specific activity of 1 × 109 dpm/μg using the random-primed DNA labeling method (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Hybridization was performed in 50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 200 μg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA, 1% SDS, 0.9 m NaCl, 60 mmNaH2PO4, 6 mm EDTA (pH 7.0) for 14 h at 42 °C. The filters were washed to a final stringency of 55 °C in 0.1 × SSC, 0.2% SDS and the signals recorded using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The Tf, α1-antitrypsin, β-actin, ribosomal protein L28, and 28 S ribosomal RNA cDNA probes were obtained as described previously (10Wenger R.H. Rolfs A. Marti H.H. Bauer C. Gassmann M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27865-27870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 23Wenger R.H. Marti H.H. Schuerer-Maly C.C. Kvietikova I. Bauer C. Gassmann M. Maly F.E. Blood. 1996; 87: 756-761Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All probes were purified free of vector sequences by restriction digestion and agarose gel purification. pGLTf4000 was constructed by insertion of the 4-kb KpnI-BamHI fragment from the Tf promoter/enhancer-containing plasmid pTfCAT (kindly provided by M. M. Zakin, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France) into theKpnI-BglII sites of pGL3Basic (Promega). Luciferase reporter gene constructs containing the heterologous SV40 promoter were obtained by inserting the DNA sequences of interest into the BamHI site 3′ to the luciferase gene of the pGL3Promoter plasmid (Promega). The liver-specific Tf enhancer from nucleotide position −3.6 kb to −3.3 kb relative to the transcriptional start site (3Boissier F. Augé-Gouillou C. Schaeffer E. Zakin M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9822-9828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was obtained by polymerase chain reaction amplification of genomic DNA using the oligonucleotide primers 5′-GGTCAGGCAGAGGACACTG-3′ and 5′-CAGTTCTAGACCAACCCAAG-3′. The oligonucleotides containing wild type and mutated HBSs are shown in Fig. 4. Copy number and orientation were determined using RVprimer4 (Promega) by T7 polymerase-mediated single-stranded DNA sequencing following the manufacturer's instructions (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The β-galactosidase expression vector pCMVlacZ was a kind gift of S. Kozlov (Institute of Biochemistry, Zürich, Switzerland). The HIF-1α (pCMVhHIF-1α) and ARNT/HIF-1β (pCMVhARNT and pCMVΔbARNT) expression vectors (19Gradin K. McGuire J. Wenger R.H. Kvietikova I. Whitelaw M.L. Toftgård R. Tora L. Gassmann M. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5221-5231Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) were generously provided by L. Poellinger. Hep3B, HepG2, and HeLa cells (0.2–1 × 107 in 350 μl of medium without fetal calf serum) were co-transfected with 25 μg each of luciferase and β-galactosidase reporter gene constructs by electroporation at 250 V and 960 microfarads (Gene Pulser, Bio-Rad). After recovering, the cells were split in two aliquots and incubated for 36 h at 20% or 1% O2, respectively. After washing twice with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were lysed in reporter lysis buffer (Promega) and luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were determined according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega) using a Biocounter M1500 luminometer (Lumac) and a DU-62 spectrophotometer (Beckman), respectively. Differences in the transfection efficiency and extract preparation were corrected by normalization to the corresponding β-galactosidase activities. Luciferase activities were expressed relative to the empty parental vector (pGL3Basic or pGL3Promoter) transfectants. For transient overexpression assays in Hep3B cells, 10 μg of each expression vector was co-transfected together with equal amounts of the luciferase reporter construct pTfHBSww and the control plasmid pCMVlacZ. The unrelated vector plasmid pBluescript (Stratagene) was added to adjust the total amount of DNA per electroporation to 50 μg. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (24Kvietikova I. Wenger R.H. Marti H.H. Gassmann M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4542-4550Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 × 108 cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and once with buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl). After incubation on ice for 10 min, the cells were lysed by 10 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer, and the nuclei were pelleted and resuspended in buffer C (420 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 20% glycerol) and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with gentle agitation. Immediately before use, buffers A and C were supplemented with 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin, and 1 mm Na3VO4 (all obtained from Sigma). The nuclear extract was centrifuged, and the supernatant was dialyzed twice against buffer D (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as standard. Sequences of the oligonucleotide probes used for EMSA are shown in Fig. 4. The EPOHBS oligonucleotides have been described previously (24Kvietikova I. Wenger R.H. Marti H.H. Gassmann M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4542-4550Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). All oligonucleotides (Microsynth) were purified on 10% polyacrylamide gels prior to 5′ end-labeling of the sense strand with [γ-32P]ATP (Hartmann) using T4-polynucleotide kinase (Fermentas). Unincorporated nucleotides were removed by gel filtration over Bio-Gel P60 (fine) columns (Bio-Rad). Labeled sense strands were annealed to a 2-fold molar excess of unlabeled antisense strands. DNA-protein binding reactions were carried out for 20 min at 4 °C in a total volume of 20 μl containing 4–5 μg of nuclear extract, 0.1–0.4 μg of sonicated, denatured calf thymus DNA (Sigma), and 1 × 104 cpm of oligonucleotide probe in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol and run on 4% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Electrophoresis was performed at 200 V in TBE buffer (89 mm Tris, 89 mm boric acid, 5 mm EDTA) at 4 °C, and dried gels were autoradiographed. For supershift analysis, each 1 μl of rabbit polyclonal antisera derived against HIF-1α or ARNT/HIF-1β (kind gift of L. Poellinger) was added to the completed EMSA reaction mixture and incubated for 16 h at 4 °C prior to loading. For competition experiments, a 4–500-fold molar excess of unlabeled annealed oligonucleotides was added to the binding reaction prior to addition of labeled probes. We previously reported on oxygen-regulated mRNA expression of several acute phase genes in the human hepatoma cell line HepG2 (10Wenger R.H. Rolfs A. Marti H.H. Bauer C. Gassmann M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27865-27870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Regulation of the Tf gene was of special interest since Tf transcription was down-regulated in response to proinflammatory cytokines (e.g. interleukin-6), but was up-regulated following exposure to low oxygen concentrations. To test whether hypoxic Tf induction observed in HepG2 cells might represent a general phenomenon in liver cells, we also exposed Hep3B cells, another human hepatoma cell line, to 1% O2 for 1–3 days. As shown by RNA blotting experiments, Tf mRNA was up-regulated about 1.5-fold in Hep3B cells (Fig. 1 A) and up to 4.5-fold in HepG2 cells (Fig. 1 B). A similar hypoxic induction pattern of endogenous gene expression in the two cell lines was observed for the acute phase reactant α1-antitrypsin, which was included as positive control (Fig. 1, A andB). Specificity of hypoxic up-regulation was shown using L28 and 28 S control hybridizations since β-actin mRNA was also slightly up-regulated in both hepatoma cell lines and thus not suitable as a normalization probe (10Wenger R.H.

Chem. 1991; 266: 9822-9828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) Tf promoter/enhancer DNA fragment (Fig.2 A) was inserted upstream of a promoterless luciferase reporter gene vector. Following transient transfection into Tf-expressing Hep3B and HepG2 cells, as well as into non-Tf-expressing HeLa cells, this 4-kb Tf promoter/enhancer induced basal luciferase expression 10-, 26-, and 8-fold in Hep3B, HepG2 and HeLa cells, respectively (Fig. 2 B, open bars). Hypoxia (1% O2) stimulated luciferase expression 4.1- and 5.6-fold in Hep3B and HepG2 cells, respectively, but no significant hypoxic induction could be observed in HeLa cells (Fig. 2 B,filled bars). Thus, hypoxia responsiveness seems to be coupled to liver-specific cis-acting elements present within this Tf promoter/enhancer DNA fragment. In analogy to the liver-specific enhancer and the hypoxia-responsive element residing in close vicinity in the Epo 3′ flanking region (16Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (2137) Google Scholar), we wondered whether the −3600/−3300 bp liver-specific Tf enhancer (Fig. 2 A) might be responsible for oxygen responsiveness of the Tf gene. To test this, we subcloned the 300-bp Tf enhancer downstream of a luciferase reporter gene driven by a heterologous SV40 promoter. The Tf enhancer induced normoxic luciferase expression by 8.1-, 1.6-, and 2.0-fold in Hep3B, HepG2, and HeLa cells, respectively (Fig. 3, open bars). This expression level was further up-regulated by exposing the cells to hypoxia; luciferase activity in Hep3B, HepG2, and HeLa cells increased 3.1-, 6.8-, and 1.8-fold, respectively (Fig. 3, filled bars). The weak hypoxic inducibility (1.4-fold) of the pGL3Promoter plasmid itself has been reported previously (24Kvietikova I. Wenger R.H. Marti H.H. Gassmann M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4542-4550Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Thus, similar to the observations using the 4-kb Tf promoter/enhancer, the 300-bp Tf enhancer alone conferred hypoxia inducibility in Hep3B and HepG2 hepatoma cells, but was not significantly active in non-Tf-expressing HeLa cells. A computer-assisted search using a HIF-1 consensus DNA-binding site (24Kvietikova I. Wenger R.H. Marti H.H. Gassmann M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4542-4550Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) as query revealed the presence of two tandemly arrayed putative HBSs beginning at nucleotide positions 174 and 191, respectively (Fig. 4), within the 300-bp Tf enhancer (numbering according to Ref. 3Boissier F. Augé-Gouillou C. Schaeffer E. Zakin M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9822-9828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No other matches to the HIF-1 query were found in the published nucleotide sequences of the Tf gene. To test whether these two putative HBSs were functionally oxygen-responsive, we synthesized oligonucleotides containing both sites in either the wild type configuration (TfHBSww), or with one (TfHBSwm or TfHBSmw) or both (TfHBSmm) HBS sitesmutated (Fig. 4). Single copies of these oligonucleotides were inserted 3′ to a luciferase reporter gene driven by a heterologous SV40 promoter. For comparison, a hypoxia-responsive luciferase construct (pGLEPOHBS.3) containing three concatamerized copies of the Epo HBS was included in this study (24Kvietikova I. Wenger R.H. Marti H.H. Gassmann M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4542-4550Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was determined following transient transfection of Hep3B and HeLa cells, splitting in two aliquots and 36 h of normoxic or hypoxic cell culture. Compared with the normoxic control cells, hypoxia increased luciferase expression from the control plasmid (pGLEPOHBS.3) 4.1- and 6.8-fold in Hep3B and HeLa cells, respectively (Fig.5). Hypoxic induction mediated by the two tandemly arrayed, putative Tf HBSs (pGLTfHBSww) was more effective in Hep3B cells (9.4-fold) than in HeLa cells (3.7-fold). Although again less pronounced in HeLa cells compared with Hep3B cells (similar to the 300-bp Tf enhancer; see Fig. 3), the putative Tf HBSs functioned as hypoxia-dependent enhancer in both cell lines that do or do not express Tf (Fig. 5). This observation is reminiscent of the Epo HBS, which has previously been reported to enhance hypoxic gene expression in Epo-expressing and non-Epo-expressing cell lines (25Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2423-2427Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar,26Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4304-4308Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar). Mutation of either one of the two putative Tf HBSs (plasmids pGLTfHBSwm and pGLTfHBSmw) only partially reduced hypoxic luciferase expression, and a double mutation of both sites (plasmid pGLTfHBSmm) was necessary to completely abrogate oxygen responsiveness down to the basal level observed with the empty vector alone (Fig. 5). To investigate the involvement of the HIF-1 protein complex in Tf regulation, we performed transient expression experiments using the HIF-1α and/or ARNT/HIF-1β expression vectors pCMVhHIF-1α and pCMVhARNT, respectively (19Gradin K. McGuire J. Wenger R.H. Kvietikova I. Whitelaw M.L. Toftgård R. Tora L. Gassmann M. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5221-5231Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). They were co-transfected into Hep3B cells together with the reporter gene construct pGLTfHBSww (depicted in Fig.5), the normalization plasmid pCMVlacZ and the unrelated plasmid pBluescript used to equalize the total amount of DNA per transfection. As shown in Fig. 6(open bars), transient overexpression, under normoxic conditions, of either of the two HIF-1 subunits weakly (about 2-fold) induced reporter gene expression, whereas expression of both HIF-1 subunits induced luciferase expression by 5.8-fold (Fig. 6, open bars). Co-expression with a reporter gene construct containing mutant HBSs (pGLTfHBSmm) did not result in enhanced luciferase expression (data not shown), implying that HIF-1 needs to bind to the Tf HBSs to transactivate reporter gene expression. Hypoxia also activated the Tf HBSs (Fig. 6, filled bars), and overexpression of the two HIF-1 subunits further enhanced this effect 1.8-fold. Interestingly, overexpression of a dominant negative ARNT/HIF-1β mutant (pCMVΔbARNT), which lacks the basic domain and hence is still capable of heterodimerizing with HIF-1α but cannot bind DNA (19Gradin K. McGuire J. Wenger R.H. Kv"

Within the ME promoter, two direct repeat (DR)-1-like elements, MEp and MEd, have been identified as putative PPAR response elements (PPRE). We demonstrate that only MEp and not MEd is able to bind PPAR/retinoid X receptor (RXR) heterodimers and mediate peroxisome proliferator signaling. Taking advantage of the close sequence resemblance of MEp and MEd, we have identified crucial determinants of a PPRE.

This latter feature of the PPRE lead us to consider the polarity of the PPAR/RXR heterodimer bound to its cognate element. We demonstrate that, in contrast to the polarity of RXR/TR and RXR/RAR bound to DR4 and DR5 elements respectively, PPAR binds to the 5′ extended half-site of the response element, while RXR occupies the 3′ half-site. Consistent with this polarity is our finding that formation and binding of the PPAR/RXR heterodimer requires an intact hinge T region in RXR while its integrity is not required for binding of the RXR/TR heterodimer to a DR4.

Members of this superfamily are characterized by a structural organization in functional modules, comprising a N-terminal domain, a DNA binding domain, a hinge region, and a ligand binding domain that also contains a potent ligand-dependent transactivation domain and offers several interfaces for dimerization and protein-protein interaction. Although some of these receptors may bind to DNA as monomers, the majority binds as dimers to specific DNA sequences formed of two consensus half-sites. PPAR, thyroid hormone receptor (TR), vitamin D receptor (VDR), and all-trans-retinoic acid receptor (RAR) form a subgroup within the superfamily which heterodimerize with the 9-cis-retinoic acid receptor (RXR) and bind to response elements composed of two AGGTCA half-sites predominantly organized in a direct repeat. All the natural PPAR response elements (PPREs) described so far indeed consist of a direct repeat of two more or less conserved AGGTCA hexamers separated by a single base pair and are thus referred to as DR1 elements (1Dreyer C. Krey G. Keller H. Givel F. Helftenbein G. Wahli W. Cell. 1992; 68: 879-887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar, 2Tugwood J.D. Issemann I. Anderson R.G. Bundell K.R. McPheat W.L. Green S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). This organization as direct repeat imposes a head to tail polarity to the bound heterodimer complex. Recent work has shown that in the case of TR/RXR and RAR/RXR bound to a DR4 and DR5, respectively, RXR occupies the 5′ half-site (3Perlmann T. Rangara P.N. Umesono K. Evans R.M.

However, the polarity of RAR/RXR bound to a DR1 is opposite and results in a silencing of the ligand-dependent transactivation properties of RAR (6Kurokawa R. DiRenzo J. Boehm M. Sugarman J. Gloss B.

So far, the polarity of the PPAR/RXR heterodimer has not been determined. Three different PPAR subtypes have been identified (α, β/δ, and γ). Each of them displays a distinct expression pattern in adult amphibians and rodents. PPARα is predominantly expressed in hepatocytes, cardiomyocytes, proximal tubule cells of the kidney, and enterocytes. PPARβ (also called PPARδ or FAAR in rodents and NUCI in man) is more widely and often more abundantly expressed than PPARα and γ, whereas PPARγ is mainly restricted to the adipose tissue with some expression in spleen, retina, and hematopoietic cells (reviewed in Refs. 9Lemberger T. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 335-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar and 10Wahli W. Braissant O. Desvergne B. Chem. Biol. 1995; 2: 261-266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). PPARs were named by virtue of their ability to be activated by peroxisome proliferators. However, new specific activators and ligands for the different PPAR subtypes are now emerging. Recent studies have shown that various fatty acids, eicosanoids, and hypolipidemic compounds, such as fibrates, directly bind to PPARα, β, and γ. In addition, PPARγ binds antidiabetic thiazolidinediones, which lower the plasma levels of glucose, triglycerides, and insulin (reviewed in Ref. 11Willson, T. M., and Wahli, W. (1997) Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol., in press.Google Scholar). Interestingly, not only can PPARγ direct adipocyte differentiation but all the PPAR target genes identified so far are involved in major steps of fatty acid metabolism, including fatty acid transport, intracellular binding, ω- and β-oxidation, as well as fatty acid synthesis and storage as triglycerides (reviewed in Ref. 10Wahli W. Braissant O. Desvergne B. Chem. Biol. 1995; 2: 261-266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Thus, the nature of the PPAR ligands together with the observation that all PPARα and γ target genes discovered so far are directly involved in lipid metabolism reinforce the novel concept of fatty acids and their derivatives acting as hormones and controlling their own fate through these specific nuclear receptors (reviewed in Refs. 12MacDougald O.A. Daniel Lane M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 345-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar, 13Desvergne B. Wahli W. Baeuerle P.A. Inducible Gene Expression. 1.

The malic enzyme (ME) gene is one of the PPAR target genes whose product is involved in lipogenesis. ME catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of malate to pyruvate, which results in the production of NADPH for fatty acid synthesis. Thyroid hormone (T3) leads to a pronounced stimulation of ME gene expression in the liver (15Dozin B. Magnuson M.A. Nikodem V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10290-10292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is involved in adipose differentiation for which ME is a late marker (16Teboul M. Bismuth J. Gharbi-Chihi J. Vallette A. Bonne J. Ghiringhelli O. Torresani J. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 1475-1482PubMed Google Scholar, 17Garcia-Jimenez C. Hernandez A. Obregon M.J. Santisteban P. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 1537-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Interestingly, thyromimetic effects of hypolipidemic fibrates on ME expression in rat liver have been observed (18Hertz R. Aurbach R. Hashimoto T. Bar-Tana J. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 745-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 19Castelein H. Declerq P.E. Mannaerts G.P. Baes M.I. FEBS Lett. 1993; 332: 24-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Since these compounds are PPAR ligands, these thyromimetic effects may be mediated by PPAR/RXR heterodimers binding to the ME promoter. We 2A. IJpenberg, E. Jeannin, W. Wahli, and B.

However, conflicting results have been reported on the respective role of these two elements in PPAR-mediated regulation of ME gene expression; Castelein et al. (20Castelein H. Gulick T. Declercq E.P. Mannaerts G.P. More D.D. Baes M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26754-26758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have identified MEp and Hertz et al. (21Hertz R. Nikodem V. Ben-Ishai A. Berman I. Bar-Tana J. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) MEd as the functional PPRE. Our interest in the hormonal cross-talk in adipocytes between the T3 and fatty acids signaling pathways prompted us to pursue the characterization of the ME promoter with respect to PPAR-mediated gene regulation. In particular, we studied its regulation by PPARγ, the subtype abundantly expressed in adipose tissue. In this work, the demonstration that only MEp and not MEd is a functional PPRE gave us a tool to identify the determinants of a functional PPRE, which go beyond the characteristics of the core DR1 element. Furthermore, we unveiled the polarity of the heterodimer PPAR/RXR bound to a DR1, which explains the nature of the PPRE-specific requirements. The Xenopus PPARγ (1Dreyer C. Krey G. Keller H. Givel F. Helftenbein G. Wahli W. Cell. 1992; 68: 879-887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar), human RXRα (22Jansen J.H. Mahfoudi A. Rambaud S. Lavau C. Wahli W. Dejean A. Proc. Natl.

To optimize in vitrotranslation of the PPARγ and RXRα receptors, a Kozak (23Kozak M. Nature. 1984; 308: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) consensus sequence was introduced by recombinant polymerase chain reaction at the translational start site of the receptor. The P box mutants of PPARγ and RXRα were obtained in two sequential mutagenic steps using the Kunkel et al. (24Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar) method. The primers 5′-GCGTCCATGCATGTGGATCTTGCAAGGGGTTCTT-3′ and 5′-GTGGATCTTGCAAGGTGTTCTTTAGAAGAAC-3′ were used to create PPARpgr; the primers 5′-GAGTGTACAGCTGCGGGTCGTGCAAGGGCTTCTT-3′ and 5′-GCGGGTCGTGCAAGGTCTTCTTCAAGCGGAC-3′ were used to create RXRpgr. The primer 5′-GGCATGAAGCGGGAATTCGAGGGGGAGGAGCGGCAGCG-3′ was used to create the RXR(T) mutant, using the same approach. pME775 was created by cloning the 809-bpXbaI-BamHI fragment (bp −775/+34) of the pME882 plasmid (25Morioka H. Tennyson G.E. Nikodem V.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3542-3545Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) into pBLCAT3 (26Luckow B. Schütz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). The mutant reporter plasmids pME775pko and pME775dko, in which, respectively, the proximal or the distal putative PPRE has been mutated, were generated by recombinant polymerase chain reaction using the Expand™ High Fidelity kit (Boehringer Mannheim). The mutated sequences are as follow: within pME775dko from bp −469 to −445: TGCACTAGATCTGTCCGGTCTAACA; within pME775pko from bp −346 to −322: CATTCTAAGCTTGAGTTGATCCCCT. The reporter constructs containing the wild-type or mutated PPREs upstream of the heterologous thymidine kinase promoter were created by cloning a single copy of the response element into theBamHI/HindIII sites of the pBL-CAT8+ plasmid. All the constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. NIH3T3 cells were maintained in culture and transfected as described previously (27Desvergne B. Petty K.J. Nikodem V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1008-1013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, each cuvette for electroporation contained 4 × 106 cells at a density of 12.5 × 106 cells/ml and a total of 70 μg of plasmid DNA (20 μg of chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT)-reporter plasmid, 12 μg of each expression vector as indicated in the figure legends, 1 μg of pCMVβgal as internal control for transfection efficiency, and pUC19 or salmon sperm DNA to complete to 70 μg). After electroporation, cells were resuspended and equally distributed in four 60-mm dishes containing the transfection medium supplemented with the appropriate activator. After 48 h, cell extracts were prepared and β-galactosidase and CAT activities were determined as described previously (27Desvergne B. Petty K.J. Nikodem V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1008-1013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins for electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were obtained by in vitro transcription and translation using the TNT®coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). Parallel translations using [35S]methionine (Amersham Corp.) followed by SDS-PAGE analysis and exposure in the phosphor-analyst (Bio-Rad) allowed standardization of the different protein preparations. Alternatively, nuclear extracts from Sf9 cells infected with a recombinant baculovirus overexpressing the mouse RXRβ were used. The probes and competitors corresponded to the double-stranded oligonucleotides indicated in the figures flanked on their 5′ side and 3′ side by the BamHI and HindIII overhang sequence, respectively. The ACO(A) and METREoligonucleotides are (5′-GATCCCGAACGTGACCTTTGTCCTGGTCCCGATC-3′) and (5′-GATCAGGACGTTGGGGTTAGGGGAGGACAGATC-3′), respectively. In vitro translated proteins were preincubated for 15 min at room temperature, in a buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 40 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 8 μg poly(dI-dC). After a further 20-min incubation period at room temperature in the presence of 20,000 cpm of labeled probe, the complexes were separated on a 6% native polyacrylamide gel with 0.25 × TBE running buffer at 500 V, 25 mA, 4 °C. For DNA binding competition experiments, a 10–100-fold molar excess (as indicated) of the unlabeled double-stranded competitor oligonucleotide was added to the preincubation reaction. Gels were dried and exposed at −80 °C to a Kodak X-Omat AR film with an intensifying screen. Scanning and treatment of the images were performed using the Cirrus 1.2 software. When appropriate, gels were analyzed by phosphor-analyst or densitometry. The possibility of cross-talk between PPAR and TR signaling pathways at the level of ME gene expression might be important in cells, such as adipocytes, in which all three proteins, PPAR, TR, and ME, are expressed. We thus tested if the ME promoter is responsive to PPARγ, the PPAR subtype which is crucial for adipogenesis and is present at high levels in mature adipocytes (28Tontonoz P. Hu E. Graves R.A.

A, schematic representation of the pME775 reporter construct. The respective position and sequence of the thyroid hormone response element (METRE) and of the DR1 elements, MEp and MEd, are given. B, the proximal element is able to mediate ligand dependent transactivation by PPAR. NIH3T3 were cotransfected with pME775, pME775pko, pME775dko, pMEpfl, or pMEdfl reporter plasmid, and either TR-encoding, PPAR-encoding, or empty expression vector as indicated (see “Experimental Procedures”). Following transfection, the cells were cultivated for 48 h in the absence of hormone (black bars) or in the presence of either 100 nmT3 (dotted bars) or 100 μm Wy 14,643 (hatched bars). CAT activity levels were standardized to β-galactosidase expression used as transfection internal control. The basal activity of each of the reporter plasmids in the absence of receptor and activator was set to 1. Means ± S.D. of at least three independent experiments are shown. C, specificity of PPAR/RXR binding to MEpfl. Radioactively labeled MEpfl was incubated with PPAR expressed in rabbit reticulocyte lysate and RXRβ expressed in Sf9 cells by a recombinant baculovirus (lanes 2–14). Competition was performed with 10-, 50-, and 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled MEpfl (lanes 3–5), ACO(A) PPRE (lanes 6–8), METRE (lanes 9–11), or MEdfl (lanes 12–14). Lane 1 is the probe incubated with unprogrammed lysate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To clarify this point, we first tested whether the ME promoter, from −775 to +34 base pairs relative to the initiation site was responsive to PPARγ and, as a positive control, to TR. Transfection analyses using a CAT reporter gene in NIH3T3 cells confirm that TRα1 can control the ME promoter, as a T3-dependent 7-fold stimulation of the reporter gene expression was observed. Cotransfection of the reporter gene with a vector expressing PPARγ in the absence of PPAR activator moderately but reproducibly induced expression of the reporter gene (2.5-fold). Whether this induction was due to a constitutive activity of PPARγ or to endogenous PPAR activators was not further analyzed. Addition of the PPAR activator Wy 14,643 to the culture medium resulted in a 5.5-fold stimulation over the basal expression level of the reporter construct. A similar induction was obtained using the thiazolidinedione BRL49653, a PPARγ specific ligand (data not shown). These effects are receptor-specific, since T3 and Wy 14,643 stimulated the ME promoter activity only in the presence of TR and PPAR, respectively (Fig.1 B). Second, we determined the relative contribution of the two putative PPREs to PPARγ responsiveness. For that purpose, we first mutated either the MEd or the MEp sequence within the homologous promoter creating pME775dko and pME775pko, respectively. The mutation of the MEd sequence did not alter the response of the reporter gene to Wy 14,643, while mutation of MEp suppressed responsiveness, indicating that MEp is the responsive element (Fig. 1 B; see also Castelein et al. (20Castelein H. Gulick T. Declercq E.P. Mannaerts G.P. More D.D. Baes M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26754-26758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). To test if this result was independent of the position or relative orientation of each of these elements within the ME promoter (see Fig. 1 A), we inserted, in the same orientation, the two elements encompassing the DR1 motif plus their 6 bp flanking either side, upstream of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase heterologous promoter in a CAT reporter gene. pMEpfl, containing the proximal element, and pMEdfl, containing the distal element, were then transfected into NIH3T3 cells. As shown in Fig. 1 B, PPARγ increased the basal level of pMEpfl expression 7-fold in the absence of an exogenous PPAR activator, and 28-fold in the presence of Wy 14,643. In contrast, pMEdfl was not responsive to PPARγ, neither in the absence nor in the presence of Wy 14,643 (Fig. 1 B). No response of either reporter construct was observed in presence of TR and T3 (data not shown). To test if the above reported difference in PPAR responsiveness of MEp and MEd reflects their ability to bind PPAR/RXR heterodimers, we performed EMSAs. We used MEpfl as a probe, in vitrotranslated PPARγ, and cellular extracts from Sf9 cells infected by a recombinant baculovirus expressing RXRβ. Fig. 1 C shows that PPARγ/RXR binding complex could form on MEpfl, whereas no PPAR binding was observed in absence of RXR (data not shown). Unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides encompassing either the PPRE of the acyl-CoA oxidase gene (ACO(A)) or MEpfl itself efficiently competed PPAR/RXR complex formation on the probe MEpfl, whereas MEdfl, which was unresponsive in the functional test, was a very inefficient competitor. As expected, METRE did not compete for the PPAR/RXR complex binding. These data show that of the two DR1 elements present in the ME promoter, only the MEp is able to bind PPARγ/RXR heterodimers in a sequence-specific manner and can mediate peroxisome proliferator signaling. The inability of MEd to act as PPRE was puzzling since its sequence is closer to the consensus DR1 than that of the functional element MEp. Analysis of the compilation of the natural PPREs characterized so far (Fig.2) and recent reports suggested that two regions of the PPRE may be given particular attention: the spacing nucleotide between the two half-sites which is predominantly an A and the sequence immediately 5′ upstream of the DR1 core element (Fig. 2) (13Desvergne B. Wahli W. Baeuerle P.A. Inducible Gene Expression. 1. Birkhäuser, Boston, 1995: 142-176Google Scholar, 31Palmer C.N.A. Hsu M.-H. Griffin K.J. Johnson E.F. J. Biol.

In contrast to MEp, MEd strikingly diverges from the consensus in these two regions suggesting that these differences might be responsible for the lack of responsiveness of MEd to PPARγ and Wy 14,643. The role of the spacing nucleotide was first analyzed by changing the spacing nucleotide A of MEpfl to either G, C, or T, resulting in the MEp(G), MEp(C), and MEp(T) elements, respectively (see Fig.3 A). The presence of an A as in MEpfl reproducibly resulted in the strongest binding, while a C at this position always resulted in the weakest interaction (Fig.3 A). Notably, the nonfunctional sequence MEd has a C at the corresponding spacing position. Thus, we introduced the converse mutation in MEd, changing its spacing nucleotide"

All three Ids bound with high affinity to E proteins, but a much broader range of interactions was observed between Ids and the class B factors. Id1 and Id2 interacted strongly with MyoD and Myf-5 and weakly with myogenin and MRF4/Myf-6, whereas Id3 interacted weakly with all four MRFs. Similar specificities were observed in co-immunoprecipitation and mammalian 2-hybrid analyses. No interactions were found between the Ids and any of the hematopoietic factors. Each Id was able to disrupt the ability of E protein-MyoD complexes to transactivate from a muscle creatine kinase reporter construct in vivo. Finally, mutagenesis experiments showed that the differences between Id1 and Id3 binding map to three amino acids in the first helix and to a small cluster of upstream residues. The Id proteins thus display a signature range of interactions with all of their potential dimerization partners and may play a role in myogenesis which is distinct from that in hematopoiesis.

An increasingly important role is ascribed to protein-protein interactions in the regulation of cellular growth and differentiation pathways. Dimerization serves to convert inactive monomeric molecules into transcriptionally active dimeric complexes at specific times during cellular development. Deletional analysis has identified a number of evolutionarily conserved regions that mediate these interactions. One such region, commonly associated with transcription factors involved in a range of proliferative and differentiation pathways, is the basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) 1The abbreviations used are: bHLH, basic-helix-loop-helix; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; MCK, muscle creatinine kinase; MRF, myogenic regulatory factor; IP, immunoprecipitation; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; CMV, cytomegalovirus.

This domain is conserved from yeast to mammals and is composed of a positively charged basic region followed by two amphipathic α-helices separated by a spacer loop.

The class A factors, or E proteins, (E2-2, HEB, and the E2A gene products E12 and E47) are expressed in a virtually ubiquitous pattern and are able to dimerize efficiently with tissue-restricted class B factors to activate gene expression (1Murre C.

Rapid Id down-regulation has been reported in myoblasts and hematopoietic cells during terminal differentiation, consistent with their negative regulatory role (28Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D.

Because considerable overlap exists in the expression patterns of Id proteins, redundancy in their function has been inferred (30Christy B.A. Sanders L.K. Lau L.F. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 749-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Ids are known to bind avidly to class A factors such as E47, weakly to the myogenic factors, and poorly, if at all, to the hematopoietic factors (28Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1804) Google Scholar, 34Sun X.-H. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell.

This has led to the assumption that transcriptional control is exerted primarily at the level of Id-class A interactions. However, these studies were performed with select members of the class A and class B families. Thus far, no exhaustive studies exist to compare the relative strengths of interactions among a broader range of family members. The yeast 2-hybrid system has become an increasingly popular method for assessing protein-protein interactions and has been employed previously to study a subset of bHLH interactions (35Loveys D.A. Streiff M.B. Kato G.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2813-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 42Fields S. Song O.

We sought to develop a quantitative yeast 2-hybrid assay to investigate interactions of three Id proteins with a range of class A and class B factor targets. Our observations, confirmed and extended by co-immunoprecipitation (IP) of in vitro translated proteins and mammalian 2-hybrid analyses, indicate that discrete and reproducible differences exist in relative binding preferences among the Id proteins. As expected, Id proteins bound avidly to all the class A factors tested, although a range of affinities were apparent. A broader range of affinities for myogenic factors was observed, and no interactions with the hematopoietic factors were seen despite their expression in functional form. Transient transfection studies in C3H myoblasts employing a muscle-specific creatinine kinase- chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter vector provided independent confirmation of the hierarchical interactions of Id proteins with class A factors. Site-directed mutagenesis enabled us to map the regions responsible for establishing Id dimerization preferences to the first helix of the HLH domain and to residues immediately adjacent to this. Our findings have implications for the mechanism by which Id proteins influence class A and class B interactions and for the roles played by different Id proteins in tissue-specific gene regulation. Parental yeast vectors pGBT9 and pGAD were kindly supplied by Dr. S. Elledge (Baylor College of Medicine). Parental expression vectors for mammalian 2-hybrid analysis, pSG424 and pNLVP16, were obtained from Drs. C. Dang (Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine) and M. Green (University of Massachusetts) (45Dang C.V. Barrett J. Villa-Garcia M. Resar L.M. Kato G.J. Fearon E.R. Mol. Cell.

Murine Id1 was obtained from Dr. H. Weintraub (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center), and murine Id2 and Id3 cDNAs were obtained from Dr. D. Nathans (Johns Hopkins University) (28Benezra R.

Fragments encoding the HLH regions plus 15–20 flanking amino acid residues were generated by PCR primers incorporating EcoRI (forward primer) and BamHI (reverse primer) sites and cloned directionally and in-frame into pGAD, pGBT9, and pSG424. The fragments amplified encoded amino acids 73–138 of Id1, 72–140 of Id2, and 28–91 of Id3. All products were sequenced to confirm the fidelity of the PCR amplification reaction. Full-length cDNAs were cloned into pRcCMV (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) for use in in vitrotranscription/translation reactions and transient transfection assays. Murine MyoD, murine myogenin, and human Myf-5 were supplied by Dr. D. Shapiro (St. Jude Children's Research Hospital) and rat MRF4/Myf-6 by Dr. S. Konieczny (Purdue University) (8Davis R.L.

Fragments encoding the bHLH domains were again amplified by PCR, incorporatingEcoRI and BamHI sites for MyoD orBamHI and PstI sites for myogenin, Myf-5, and MRF4/Myf-6 and cloned in-frame into pGBT9 and pGAD424. The regions amplified included codons 83–184 of MyoD, 55–155 of myogenin, 56–143 of Myf-5, and 65–168 of MRF4/Myf-6. Due to the presence of an internalPstI site in the second helix of Myf-5 and MRF4/Myf-6, these were cloned as BamHI/blunt fragments. The bHLH domains from MyoD and Myf-5 were also subcloned in-frame into pNLVP16 as blunt-ended fragments. Full-length MyoD and MRF4/Myf-6 cDNAs were cloned into pRcCMV. The cDNAs encoding each of the class A factors were isolated from a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a murine embryo library in the pGAD10 vector (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) using an Id2 bait. These contained residues 118–264 of murine E47 (A1), residues 379–666 of murine E2-2 (ME-2), and residues 574–729 of murine HEB (Alf-1) (47Neilsen A.L. Pallisgaard N. Pederson F.S. Jorgenson P. Mol.

The E47 fragment was also cloned into both pNLVP16 and pGBT9. A carboxyl-terminal bHLH containing fragment of human E12 (residues 508–654) in the pAS1 vector, a gift from Dr. E. Olsen (University of Texas), was excised and sub-cloned into pGAD424 (44Staudinger J. Perry M. Elledge S.J. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4608-4611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). None of the class A clones contained the putative leucine zipper regions that are associated with transcriptional activation domains (50Aronheim A. Shiran R. Rosen A. Walker M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Weintraub), including the putative leucine zipper domain, was used for in vitro translation (6Murre C. McCaw P.S. Vaessin H. Caudy M. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Cabrera C.V. Buskin J.N. Hauschka S.D.

Full-length E12 and E47 in the mammalian expression vector pGK were a gift from Dr. G. Kato (Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine). The cDNAs for human hematopoietic factors Scl/Tal-1, Tal-2, and Lyl-1 were provided by Drs. I. Kirsch (National Cancer Institute), R. Baer (University of Texas), and M. Cleary (Stanford University), respectively (14Begley C.G. Aplan P.D. Denning S.M. Haynes B.F. Waldmann T.A. Kirsch I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The amplified fragments encoded amino acids residues 66–138 of Scl/Tal-1, 2–69 of Tal-2, and 127–200 of Lyl-1. Full-length Scl/Tal-1 was subcloned into pBluescript SK+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The multimerized gal4:CAT reporter construct pGal5E472CAT was supplied by Dr. M. Green (51Lillie J.W. Green M.R. Nature. 1989; 338 (2nd Ed.): 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). The muscle creatinine kinase (MCK) CAT construct was obtained from Dr. S. Hauschka (University of Washington). This was performed according to the protocol developed in the laboratory of Dr. S. Elledge, who also supplied the Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain Y153 (MATa, leu2-3, trp1-901, his3-Δ200, ura5-32, ade2-101, gal4Δ, gal80ΔGGAL-HIS3, LYS2::GAL-HIS3). Potential partner genes in either pGAD424 or pGBT9 were co-transformed into yeast by a lithium chloride/polyethylene glycol precipitation method (52Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A., and Struhl, K. (eds) (1993) Current Protocols In Molecular Biology, 2nd Ed., John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New YorkGoogle Scholar). Semi-quantitative determination of interaction strengths was performed by in situ assessment of β-galactosidase activity. Yeast transformants were grown to stationary phase in complete EGG medium containing 2% ethanol, 2% galactose, and 3% glycerol and lacking tryptophan and leucine. 107 cells were pelleted and resuspended in 50 μl of Z buffer (60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mmMgCl2, 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol) containing 0.01% SDS. Two microliters of CHCl2 were added followed by two cycles of freeze-thawing in liquid nitrogen. Lysates were transferred to 96-well plates, and 50 μl of a fluorogenic substrate (8 mm3-carboxyumbelliferyl-β-d-galactopyranoside, Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR) was added. After 30 min, 100 μl of stop buffer (300 mm glycine, 15 mm EDTA, pH 11.5) was added, and the reactions were allowed to stabilize for 1 h. Fluorescence was determined in a Perkin-Elmer microtiter plate reader (Foster City, CA; excitation 390 nm, emission 460 nm), and the amount of β-galactosidase synthesized was calculated relative to a dilution series of β-galactosidase enzyme standards (Sigma) assayed simultaneously with the yeast lysates. All assays were performed in triplicate with standard errors of less than 10% in each case. None of the individual vectors used in this series displayed a background higher than 10 pg of β-galactosidase enzyme/107 cells which represents the lower limit of detection with this assay. Yeast were grown in EGG medium until they reached stationary phase. They were then pelleted and subject to two cycles of freeze-thawing followed by boiling in standard SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) lysis buffer for 10 min to ensure complete lysis (53Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). 100 μg of protein was resolved by 12% PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Sigma) by semi-dry electroblotting. Membranes were preincubated in wash solution (1 × phosphate-buffered saline + 0.1% Tween 20). This was followed by a 1-h incubation in block solution (5% non-fat dry milk powder, phosphate-buffered saline + 0.1% Tween 20) containing either an anti-yeast gal4 DNA binding domain or activation domain antibody (at 1:500 and 1:2000 dilutions, respectively) (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY). Membranes were washed four times before the addition of a horseradish peroxidase-linked goat anti-mouse antibody (1:1000 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) in blocking solution and incubated for a further 1 h at room temperature. After a further four washes, proteins were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham International, Buckinghamshire, UK). Full-length E12, Id1, Id2, Id3, Scl/Tal-1, MyoD, and MRF4/Myf-6 cDNAs in either pBluescript SK+ or pRcCMV were transcribed and translated in vitro using a coupled reticulocyte lysate kit (TNT, Promega, Madison, WI) in the presence of [35S]methionine (1 mCi/mmol). Labeled proteins were mixed and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min before the addition of 100 μl of IP buffer (250 mm NaCl, 0.25% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Anti-Id, E12, or MyoD polyclonal antibodies were added and reactions incubated on ice for 30 min prior to the addition of 30 μl of a 1:1 mix of protein A-Sepharose (Bio-Rad) in IP buffer. After a further 60 min incubation, samples were washed four times in IP buffer before resolution by 12% SDS-PAGE. The intensity of each partner was quantified by PhosphorImage analysis (Molecular Dynamics) using Image-Quant software and normalized relative to methionine content of each protein. The value was then expressed as a ratio of the amount of input proteins. All antibodies were tested for cross-reactivity and shown to be specific for their respective protein under the conditions described here. 5 μg of each vector DNA was introduced into HeLa cells by calcium phosphate precipitation, and the cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) (54Apel I. Yu C.L. Wang T. Dobry C. Van Antwerp M.E. Jove R. Prochownik E.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3356-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). All transfections included a CMV β-galactosidase reporter (CLONTECH) to standardize transformation efficiencies. CAT assays were performed on cell lysates harvested after 48 h and relative conversion calculated by PhosphorImage analysis. A determination of the ability of Ids to repress E protein-MyoD interactions was performed in C3H myoblasts. The amounts of MyoD and E protein vector DNAs used were determined empirically so as to generate the maximum amount of transcriptional activation in combination over either factor alone, prior to determining the influence of co-transfected Id. This ensured that CAT activity was a reflection of a specific MyoD-E2A interaction, minimizing the influence of additional endogenous factors. 2 days post-transfection, DMEM + 10% calf serum was replaced with DMEM + 2% horse serum, and incubation was continued for a further 2 days. Under these conditions, endogenous Id levels are repressed, allowing for myogenic differentiation to proceed (55Brennan T.J. Edmonson D.G. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3822-3826Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). All transfections were adjusted to give uniform DNA concentrations with the empty pRcCMV vector. Helix swaps between Id1 and Id3 were generated by PCR amplification of individual helices followed by a “cut and paste” cloning strategy. Sixteen residues upstream of the amino terminus and 14 residues downstream of the carboxyl terminus of each HLH domain were maintained to promote correct folding. A fragment of Id1 encompassing helix 1 was amplified with a forward primer containing an EcoRI site. The reverse primer mapped to the helix 1/loop junction and contained aBamHI site. A SmaI site was introduced at the helix 1/loop boundary (residues 102 and 103 of Id1) where the codons CCC ACC were altered to CCC GGG.EcoRI/BamHI-digested fragments were cloned into pBluescript SK+ to create plasmid A. Helix 2 from Id3 was amplified from a 5′ primer derived from the loop/helix 2 region, also containing a SmaI site and a 3′ primer containing a BamHI site. BamHI/SmaI-digested fragments were then ligated into BamHI/SmaI-digested plasmid"

Egr-1 was first identified as an immediate-early gene induced by mitogenic stimulation and during membrane depolarization and seizure (25Sukhatme V.P. Cao X. Chang L.C. Tsai-Morris C.-H.

Science. 1988; 238: 797-799Crossref Scopus (929) Google Scholar). Subsequently, EGR-1 was shown to be induced by diverse exogenous stimuli (27Gashler A. Sukhatme V.P. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. 1995; 50: 191-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). EGR-1 is a nuclear protein that contains three zinc finger motifs of the C2H2subtype that bind to a GC-rich consensus DNA sequence TGCG(T/g)(G/A)GG(C/a/t)G(G/T) (where lowercase letters indicate bases of relatively lower binding affinity) or to a (TCC) n motif (28Wang Z.-Y.

Biol. 1995; 15: 2275-2287Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Structure-function mapping studies suggest that the NH2 terminus of EGR-1 confers transactivation function to the protein (27Gashler A. Sukhatme V.P. Prog.

The Egr-1 gene was localized to human chromosome 5q31.1, a region known to be often deleted from patients suffering from therapy-induced acute myeloid leukemia (31Le Beau M.M. Espinosa III, R. Neuman W.L. Stock W. Roulston D. Larson R.A. Keinanen M. Westbrook C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 90: 5484-5488Crossref Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Moreover, studies using diverse tumor cells suggest that endogenous levels of EGR-1 act to impede proliferation (32Huang R.-P. Darland T. Okamura D. Mercola D. Adamson E.D.

Consistent with an anti-tumor role for EGR-1, apoptosis-inducing stimuli, such as TG and ionizing radiation, up-regulate EGR-1 expression (20Muthukkumar S. Nair P. Sells S.F. Maddiwar N.G. Jacob R.J.

Furthermore, our previous studies, which used antisense oligomers to block EGR-1 expression or a dominant-negative EGR-1 mutant to inhibit EGR-1 function, confirmed that EGR-1 is essential for apoptosis induced by TG or by ionizing radiation (20Muthukkumar S.

Because EGR-1 is induced very early in the apoptotic process (20Muthukkumar S. Nair P. Sells S.F. Maddiwar N.G. Jacob R.J. Rangnekar V.M. Mol. Cell.

EGR-1-binding sites (EBS) that conform to the GC-rich consensus sequence have been identified in the promoters of genes such as thymidine kinase, an enzyme integral to DNA biosynthesis; cell cycle regulators such as cyclin D1 and the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene Rb; and (TCC) n motifs have been identified in the promoter regions of genes encoding growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor; growth factor receptors such as epidermal growth factor-receptor and the insulin-like growth factor-receptor; and protooncogenes c-Ki-ras and c-myc (cited in Refs.20Muthukkumar S.

Nucleic Acid Res. 1995; 50: 191-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). However, none of these genes has been shown to be directly involved in apoptosis as a consequence of EGR-1 induction. The tumor suppressor gene p53 is a central mediator of cell cycle growth arrest and apoptosis (reviewed in Refs. 35Lane D.P.

The p53 protein encodes a transcription factor that functions as a transcriptional activator or repressor, depending upon the promoter context (38Ludes-Meyers J.H. Subler M.A. Shivakumar C.V.

The p53 protein can up-regulate the expression of a number of downstream genes, such as p21/waf1, insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3, bax, andfas/apo1, implicated in growth inhibition and apoptotic cell death (42El-Deiry W.S.

The p53-dependent downstream induction or activation of the Fas/Apo1 pathway leads to the activation of a cascade of downstream effector proteases resulting in apoptotic death (12Fraser A. Evan G.

Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 2170-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). The induction of apoptosis requires p53 in most cellular experimental systems, but there are multiple examples of apoptosis in the absence of functional p53 protein, suggesting the presence of p53-independent pathway(s) for apoptosis (50Clarke A.R.

The precise molecular components of the p53-independent pathway, however, are not known. In a number of different types of cancers, p53 is the most commonly mutated tumor suppressor gene (54Hollstein M. Rice K. Greenblatt M.S. Soussi T. Fuchs R. Sorlie T. Hovig E. Smith-Sorensen B. Montesano R. Harris C.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3551-3555PubMed Google Scholar). Lack of p53expression or function is associated with an increased risk of tumor development (55Donehower L.A.

Blattner W. Chang E.H. Nature. 1990; 348: 747-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar). Most tumor types either contain no p53 protein owing to loss of the p53 alleles or of chromosome 17 wherep53 is located or contain point mutations in thep53 gene that result in mutant protein products that are functionally inactive (54Hollstein M. Rice K. Greenblatt M.S. Soussi T. Fuchs R. Sorlie T. Hovig E. Smith-Sorensen B. Montesano R. Harris C.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3551-3555PubMed Google Scholar). Most of the commonly occurring mutations inp53 are located in the DNA-binding or transactivation domains of the protein and render p53 inactive in the transcription of downstream proapoptotic genes such as bax (39Friedlander P. Haupt Y. Prives C. Oren M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4961-4971Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 40Ludwig R.L. Bates S. Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell.

Some mutant forms of p53 protein can oligomerize with wild-type p53 protein and abrogate its growth-inhibitory functions and thus act as dominant-negative inhibitors of wild-type p53 (46Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Thiagalingam S. Seymour A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1992; 256: 827-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). Wild-type but not mutant p53 protein can cause apoptosis in response to a wide range of exogenous stimuli such as adenovirus E1A protein, anti-cancer agents, or ionizing radiation (62Kastan M.B.

Moreover, hypoxia has been shown to induce apoptosis that is dependent on p53, and hypoxic conditions are suggested to provide a selective pressure for p53 mutations (69Graeber T.G. Osmanian C.

It is not known, however, whether the apoptotic action of the other immediate-early genes is dependent on wild-type p53 function. Studies directed at identifying whether p53 is required or not for the transduction of an apoptotic signal from immediate-early proapoptotic genes encoding transcription factors, which couple the early events in the plasma membrane to long term cellular phenotypic changes in the cell, should provide valuable insights into the downstream targets of the transcription factors and help identify a link with components of the cell death pathways. In the course of our studies aimed at understanding the mechanism of EGR-1-mediated apoptosis, we have identified p53 as a direct transcriptional target of EGR-1. Our data suggest that the proapoptotic action of EGR-1 is mediated via wild-type p53. Human melanoma cells A375-C6 and transfected cell lines that expressed pCMV-mEGR1 or vector were cultured as described previously (20Muthukkumar S. Nair P. Sells S.F. Maddiwar N.G. Jacob R.J.

The reaction mixture for the supershift assay consisted of all of the reagents described above for electrophoretic mobility shift assay plus 2 μl of EGR-1 antibody (sc-110X from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) or preimmune antibody. The reaction mixtures were preincubated for 20 min on ice, then incubated with the probe for 40 min, and subjected to electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels to separate the bound complexes from the free probe. To examine ectopically overexpressed EGR-1 as a cause or enhancer of apoptosis, human A375-C6 cells were stably transfected with pCMV-mEGR1, an expression construct for mouse EGR-1 (mEGR1), or with vector for a control. For each of the two constructs, we examined three transfected cell lines for EGR-1 expression by Western blot analysis.

The functions of the individual STATs are dependent on distinct protein-protein interactions. STAT1 and STAT2 are activated by tyrosine phosphorylation in response to type I interferons-alpha/beta (IFN-alpha/beta) and subsequently form a multimeric transcription factor designated the IFN-alpha-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3). ISGF3 is a unique STAT complex because it also contains a non-STAT molecule, p48, which is a critical DNA-binding component. We provide evidence that STAT2 specifically interacts with p48 in vivo before and after IFN-alpha stimulation. The specificity of ISGF3 formation is therefore a result of the distinct nature of the STAT2 molecule. Coimmunoprecipitation assays demonstrate p48 association with STAT2 but not STAT1. Hybrid STAT2. STAT1 molecules were used to identify a region of STAT2 which specifically associates with p48. The region of STAT2 interaction spans an amino-terminal region of two predicted coiled coils. The studies demonstrate the in vivo existence of a STAT2.p48 complex and a distinct STAT2.STAT1 complex after IFN-alpha stimulation. Data suggest that distinct bipartite complexes STAT2.p48 and STAT2.STAT1 translocate to the nucleus and associate on the DNA target site as ISGF3."
https://openalex.org/W1972190235,"We have cloned a novel winged helix factor, WIN, from the rat insulinoma cell line, INS-1. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that WIN is highly expressed in a variety of insulinoma cell lines and rat embryonic pancreas and liver. In adults, WIN expression was detected in thymus, testis, lung, and several intestinal regions. We determined the DNA sequences bound in vitro by baculovirus-expressed WIN protein in a polymerase chain reaction-based selection procedure. WIN was found to bind with high affinity to the selected sequence 5′-AGATTGAGTA-3′, which is similar to the recently identified HNF-6 binding sequence 5′-DHWATTGAYTWWD-3′ (where W = A or T, Y = T or C, H is not G, and D is not C). We have isolated human WIN cDNAs by library screening and 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Sequence analysis indicates that the carboxyl terminus of human WIN has been previously isolated as a putative phosphorylation substrate, MPM2-reactivephosphoprotein 2 (MPP2); WIN may be regulated by phosphorylation. Alignment of the rat and human WIN cDNAs and their comparison with mouse genomic sequence revealed that the WIN DNA binding domain is encoded by four exons, two of which (exons 4 and 6) are alternatively spliced to generate at least three classes of mRNA transcripts. These transcripts were shown by RNase protection assay to be differentially expressed in different tissues. Alternative splicing within the winged helix DNA binding domain might result in modulation of DNA binding specificity.

We are interested in the molecular basis of endocrine and exocrine pancreas formation. Gene expression studies suggest both pancreas compartments are derived from a band of endodermal cells in the foregut that comprises the pancreatic primordium. These specific endodermal cells can be identified prior to overt pancreas morphogenesis by their characteristic expression of Type II glucose transporter (Glut2) (1Pang K. Mukonoweshuro C. Wong G.G.

Functional diversity is evident in the wide spectrum of phenotypes associated with mutations of WH genes. HCM1 and FHL1 were isolated as suppressors of calmodulin and RNA polymerase III mutations, respectively, in yeast (23Zhu G. Muller E.G.D. Amacher S.L. Northrop J.L. Davis T.N. Mol. Cell.

In rodents, natural mutations at the nude locus, which resulted in abnormal hair growth and thymus development, were shown to be due to the disruptions of the whn WH gene (28Nehls M. Pfeifer D.

Brain abnormalities were detectable in knockout mice lacking expression of the neurally expressed BF-1 and BF-2 genes (31Xuan S. Baptista C.A. Balas G. Tao W. Soares V.C. Lai E.

Genes & Dev. 1996; 10: 1467-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). In this paper, we describe the analysis of WH gene expression in a rat pancreatic endocrine cell line, INS-1, by RT-PCR and the subsequent isolation and characterization of a novel WH gene, named WIN. WIN has about 40% amino acid identity within the WH domain and was found to be highly expressed in different insulinoma cell lines and embryonic pancreas and liver. In adult tissues, WIN expression was high in testis and thymus and lower in lung and intestine. A histidine-tagged WIN fusion protein was used to select the WIN binding sites in vitro by following a modified PCR-based selectionand amplification of binding sites (SAAB) procedure. WIN has a unique binding specificity. We isolated human WIN cDNAs and found that a region outside of the WH domain was previously isolated as a partial 3′ cDNA encodingMPM2-reactive phosphoprotein 2 (MPP2) (33Westendorf J.M. Rao P.N. Gerace L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 714-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). MPP2 was isolated by expression cloning with the MPM2 monoclonal antibody, which bound its phosphorylated epitopes. WIN may be regulated by phosphorylation at the carboxyl terminus. WIN function may also be regulated by differential splicing. Analysis of multiple human and rat WIN cDNAs indicated that differential splicing occurs within the WH DNA binding domain at regions important for directing DNA binding specificity (34Overdier D.G. Porcella A. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14 (2nd Ed.): 2755-2766Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). We demonstrated by RNase protection analysis that these unprecedented differential splicing events are regulated. Standard molecular biology techniques used are described by Sambrook et al. (35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Total RNAs were extracted by the guanidium isothiocyanate method (36Davis L.G. Dibner M.D. Battey J.F. Basic Methods in Molecular Biology. Elsevier, New York1986: 129-135Google Scholar) and poly(A)+ RNA prepared using the Promega Poly(A)Tract mRNA isolation system. PCR was done using Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Inc.) unless specified otherwise. Sequencing was performed using the Sanger dideoxy chain termination method. The two sets of degenerate oligonucleotides, WH-1 (5′-AARCCHCCHTAWTCNTAYAT-3′) and WH-2 (5′-RTGYCKRATNGARTTCTGCCA-3′) were designed based on previous reports (18Clevidence D.E. Overdier D.G. Tao W.

Schutz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7628-7631Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). RT-PCR used the Perkin-Elmer RT-PCR kit with poly(A)+ RNA from INS-1 cells as templates at an annealing temperature of 40 °C with random hexamers. The amplified DNA (∼153 bp) was isolated and subcloned into pBluescriptII (Stratagene) using the TA cloning vector from Invitrogen. A directional INS-1 cDNA library was constructed in plasmid vector, pJG4–5, using the Stratagene cDNA synthesis kit. The 3.0-kb rat WIN cDNA was isolated by screening one million colonies of this library using a 30-mer oligonucleotide (5′-GCCAGCCTGGCTTGGCAATGTGCTTAAAAT-3′). The human WIN cDNAs were isolated by screening human adenocarcinoma (Stratagene) and testis (CLONTECH) directional cDNA libraries using the rat WIN cDNA under high stringency conditions. 5′-RACE was performed using the Life Technologies, Inc. RACE kit with rat 18 days post coital pancreas total RNAs and human thymus total RNAs (CLONTECH) as templates. The longest 5′-RACE products were assembled with the rat and human partial cDNAs at unique EcoRV and BssH1 site, respectively. The predicted ORF within the assembled 3.4-kb rat cDNA (WIN-1) was tested by coupled in vitrotranscription/translation using the Promega TNT Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System. The rat and human cDNA sequences were submitted to GenBank™ under the accession numbers U83112 and U83113, respectively. RNAs were electrophoresed on 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel and blotted onto nylon membrane (GeneScreen) and probed with32P-labeled WIN-1 cDNA. Blots were stripped and reprobed with rat γ-actin according to the GeneScreen manual. TheCLONTECH mouse and human endocrine system Multiple Tissue Northern blots were probed with WIN-1 as described by the manufacturer using high stringency washing conditions. For RPA, WIN DNA spanning exons 4, 5, and 6 was amplified by PCR and subcloned into pBluescript II SK− as DNA template for RNA synthesis. After linearizing with EcoRI, 32P-labeled antisense RNA probes (243 bases) were synthesized by in vitrotranscription using T7 polymerase (Ambion Maxiscript kit) and gel-purified, and RPA was performed with total RNAs using the Ambion RPA kit. RPA using cyclophilin as probe was also carried out for RNA quantitation. COS cells were transfected by the DEAE-dextran method (37Danielsen M. Northrop J.P. Ringold G.M. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2513-2522Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Two days after transfection, nuclear extracts were prepared from the cells according to Schreiber et al. (38Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3902) Google Scholar). The BAC-TO-BAC Baculovirus expression system (Life Technologies Inc.) was used to express the WIN protein. The WIN gene was generated by a two-step PCR procedure using three primers: Primer 1 (5′-CATCATCATGGAGACGATGACGATAAGATGAGAACCAGCCCCCGGCGG-3′), Primer 2 (5′-GTTGTTGGATCCACCATGGGACACCATCACCATCATCATGGAGACGATGAC-3′), and Primer 3 (5′-GTTGTTCTCGAGCTATCGCAGCTCAGGGATGAACTG-3′). PCR was performed first with Primers 1 and 3 for 10 cycles. The PCR product was purified using the Promega Wizard PCR Preps DNA Purification System, followed by PCR using Primers 2 and 3 for 20 additional cycles. The 5′-primers (Primers 1 and 2) led to the introduction of a BamHI site, and then a sequence based on the Kozak rule for optimal protein expression in-frame with an initiating methionine with a glycine spacer followed by nucleotides coding for the (HIS)6 tag and the enterokinase consensus sequence, followed by the first 21 nucleotides of the WIN gene. The 3′-primer (Primer 3) contains 24 nucleotides of 3′ WIN sequence and allowed the introduction of a XhoI site. The PCR product was digested by BamHI and XhoI and ligated into identical sites of the donor plasmid pFASTBAC-1. The ligation product was transformed into DH10BAC Escherichia coli cell. The transformants were plated out in Luria agar plates containing kanamycin, gentamycin, tetracycline, bluo-gal, and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Four white colonies were selected after 48 h of transformation. Mini DNA preparations were prepared, and the isolation of recombinant baculovirus DNA was confirmed by PCR. Transfection of Sf9 insect cells was by Cell-fectamine (Life Technologies, Inc.). The recombined virus was harvested after 7 days of transfection, and the virus stock was amplified by infecting Sf9 cells using low viral MOIs (1 MOI/cell). For WIN protein production, Sf9 cells were seeded to 90% confluence in two T175 flasks (Falcon), and the cells were infected with a high MOI (about 10 MOI/cell) from the viral stock. Infected cells were harvested after 96 h of infection and lysed in Tris buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.5 m NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin A, 0.2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysed cells were then sonicated briefly and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was used for binding to an Ni column (Qiagen). The WIN protein was eluted out using 200 mm imidazole. WIN protein purification was confirmed by SDS-PAGE gels stained by Coomassie Blue. EMSA was conducted using the Bandshift kit from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. A typical DNA binding reaction contained ∼2 ng of 32P-labeled DNA and 2 μl of nuclear extract or purified WIN in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 3 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 μg poly (dI-dC), 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin A, 0.2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at a total reaction volume of 20 μl. Both DNA binding and gel electrophoresis were carried out at 4 °C. The DNA sequences recognized by WIN was determined using a modified SAAB procedure. The random oligonucleotide, 5′-CAGTGCTCTAGAGGATCCGTGAC(N13)CGAAGCTTATCGATCCGAGCG-3′, and PCR primers (Primer 4, 5′-CGCTCGGATCGATAAGCTTCG-3′ Primer 5, 5′-CAGTGCTCTAGAGGATCCGTGAC-3′) were designed according to Kunschet al. (39Kunsch C. Ruben S.M. Rosen C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4412-4421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The random DNA pool for selection was generated by annealing of 32P-labeled Primer 4 with the random oligonucleotide followed by Klenow extension. 500,000 cpm (∼150 ng) of the labeled DNA was subjected to WIN binding and EMSA. In the first two rounds of selection, there was no discernible band shift, gel pieces above the unbound DNA were excised, and the DNA was eluted in TE (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8) with 50 mm NaCl. ∼120 of the eluted DNA was amplified by PCR using Primers 4 and 5 for 30 cycles. After phenol/chloroform extraction, the amplified DNA was concentrated and washed in Microcon 100 concentrator (Amicom), followed by purification in a 12% native PAGE gel. The purified DNA was then radiolabeled by kinasing and subjected to subsequent round of WIN selection. After five rounds of WIN selection, the PCR-amplified DNA was digested with BamHI and HindIII and subcloned into pBluescript II SK− for sequencing. The insulinoma cell line INS-1 expresses many of the properties of isolated primary rat islet beta cells and is a ready source of material for gene expression analysis. We sought to characterize the WH genes expressed in INS-1 by PCR with two sets of degenerate oligonucleotides, WH-1 and WH-2, that span two conserved blocks of sequence homology within the WH DNA binding domain (Fig.1 A). PCR products of about 150 bp were generated, subcloned, and sequenced (Fig. 1 B). 35 clones were picked randomly and found to encode WH proteins; 51% of the clones showed identity to the HNF3γ DNA binding domain, 6% to the rat homolog of human FREAC, and 43% or 15 of 35 clones contained an identical novel WH sequence. Because the novel WH sequence was cloned from INS-1 RNAs, we named the novel gene WIN (Winged helix from INS-1 cells). Northern blot analysis of INS-1 RNAs indicated that the full-length cDNA gene for rat WIN should be about 3.5 kb (see Fig.3 A). We designed a 30-mer oligonucleotide from the novel WIN sequence and used it to screen a INS-1 cDNA library. A single clone with an insert of about 3 kb was isolated. DNA sequence analysis revealed an ORF of 651 amino acids containing the identified novel WH DNA binding domain, however without an initiating methionine. 5′-RACE with rat 18 dpc pancreas RNA generated a 900-bp fragment (RACE2.1) 5′ of the EcoRV site present in the 3-kb cDNA (Fig.2 A).Figure 2Sequence analysis of rat WIN.

Conceptual translation revealed a 771-amino acid ORF that begins with two ATGs (at nucleotide 85). The absence of a purine in the −3 position of the first ATG would predict that the second ATG at nucleotide 88 is the initiating methionine. A similarly positioned methionine was found to be conserved in the human WIN cDNA sequence. Two in-frame stop codons are found 5′ to this ATG. WIN-1, when tested in a coupled in vitrotranscription/translation reaction, yielded a polypeptide with a SDS-PAGE mobility of 90-kDa (Fig. 1 C). A cDNA assembled using a shorter RACE fragment (RACE2.2) that starts at nucleotide 199 did not yield a translation product. The synthesis of WIN fusion protein of the predicted size using the baculovirus expression system also provides evidence that the predicted ORF was used in vivo. WIN-1 was searched against GenBank™ sequences. The only significant matches were gene sequences of the WH gene family and with MPP2 (see “Isolation of Human WIN”). From a comparison of the 10 most homologous WH genes, we found homology only in the WH DNA binding domain with no conservation of Regions II, III, and IV, previously identified as transcriptional activation domains in rodent HNF3s and other related WH proteins (21Hromas R. Costa R. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 1995; 20: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 40Pani L. Overdier D.G. Porcella A. Qian X. Lai E. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3723-3732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both the alignment of the homologous WH domains against rat HNF3α (Fig. 2 B) and the dendrogram analysis (Fig. 2 C) indicate that WIN is distantly related to other WH proteins (less than 40% amino acid identity). The alignment also reveals the striking displacement of 12 amino acids in the center of Helix 3 of the WIN WH domain. The 36-bp DNA sequence corresponding to these 12 amino acids is absent from the original WIN PCR sequences. We questioned whether this 36-bp DNA sequence would be evident in the genomic DNA sequence of WIN. Phage genomic DNAs for murine WIN were isolated, subcloned, and sequenced. 2K.-M. Yao and G. G. Wong, unpublished data. A comparison of mouse and rat sequences revealed the intron and exon structure described in Fig. 2 A. The 36-bp sequence specific to the WH domain of the WIN gene is conserved in the mouse genomic WIN sequence and constitutes a single exon, exon 4. Moreover, RT-PCR analysis using primers flanking exon 4 and INS-1 poly(A)+ RNA as templates indicated that both transcripts with and without exon 4 are expressed by INS-1 cells. WIN-1 was used as a probe for Northern analysis of RNAs from rodent and human cells and tissues (Fig. 3). Species specific RNA band patterns were observed: a 3.5-kb doublet and a faint 4.3-kb band in rat (Fig. 3, A and B); two equally intense 3.5-kb and 4.3-kb bands in mouse (Fig. 3, A andC) and a 4-kb band in human (Fig. 3 D). WIN expression was detected in all the rat (INS-1, B2, 38, and RIN56A) and murine (alphaTC1, betaTC1, and beta TC6) endocrine cell lines analyzed (Fig. 3 A). PC12, a neuronal cell line, expressed a lower level of WIN. Rat RNAs prepared from e12, 14, 18, neonate and adult pancreas and livers were tested for WIN expression (Fig.3 B). Expression levels appeared to be high in the embryonic pancreas and liver but decreased to undetectable levels in the adult. The lack of detectable expression in HepG2 cells is consistent with the absence of expression in adult liver. However, expression of WIN could persist in islet endocrine cells and be diluted by its relatively low concentration in the adult pancreas. In adult tissues, high level WIN expression was apparent in testis and thymus (Fig. 3, C andD). A moderate level of WIN expression was also detected in lung and several intestinal regions (large intestine and duodenum; Fig.6 B and results not shown). The distant relationship of WIN to other WH proteins suggests that it may have a different DNA binding specificity. WIN-1, HNF3α, and HNF3γ cDNAs were heterologously expressed in COS-1 cells to generate nuclear extracts for DNA binding experiments. Nuclear extracts were prepared from transfected cells and tested for their ability to bind the known HNF3 binding sites in an EMSA. EMSA showed that nuclear extracts containing HNF3α and HNF3γ bound oligonucleotides corresponding to the HNF3 binding site TTR-S wi"

In the present study we investigated the PTH-mediated regulation of the type II Na+/Pi cotransporter in opossum cells (OK cells); these cells have recently been shown to contain such a cotransporter (NaPi-4; Ref. 8Sorribas V. Markovich D. Hayes G. Stange G. Forgo J. Biber J. Murer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6615-6621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The validity of the opossum kidney cell model to study proximal tubular Na+/Pi cotransport and its regulation has been established (18Biber J. Forgo J. Murer H. Am J.

Physiol. 1991; 419: 256-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). With respect to PTH-dependent control of Na+/Pi cotransport activity, we have reported that the recovery from the PTH-mediated inhibition of Na+/Pi cotransport in OK cells is dependent onde novo protein synthesis. This latter observation led to the hypothesis that PTH might lead to the retrieval and degradation of the transporter (27Malmstrom K. Murer H. FEBS Lett. 1987; 216: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The aims of the present study were 2-fold: (i) to study cellular/molecular mechanisms involved in PTH-dependent control of type II Na+/Pi cotransporters, (ii) to create by transfection an in vitro model that also permits the study of the PTH control of the rat type II Na+/Pi cotransporter. Obviously, the latter approach would then offer a tool to characterize the molecular determinants involved in such regulations. A prerequisite for this approach was the availability of antisera, permitting a distinction between intrinsic (NaPi-4) and transfected (NaPi-2) cotransporters. The results obtained show that both intrinsic (NaPi-4) and transfected type II Na+/Pi cotransporters (NaPi-2, rat) are functionally (transport) and morphologically (immunofluorescence) located at the apical cell surface, are functionally inhibited in response to PTH addition, are retrieved in a PTH-dependent manner from the apical cell surface (immunofluorescence), and are subsequently degraded (Western blots). These data document that PTH control of the type II Na+/Pi cotransporters involves a step of membrane retrieval and degradation. Furthermore, the OK cell system should represent the ideal in vitro model to dissect the cellular/molecular mechanisms participating in regulation of this proximal tubular transport function, which is crucially involved in overall Pi homeostasis. The generation of the vectors used (pLKneo and NaPi-2/pLKneo) has been described previously (24Hirt R.P. Poulain-Godefroy O. Billotte J. Krähenbühl J.P. Fasel N. Gene. 1992; 111: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 25Quabius E.S. Murer H. Biber J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: F220-F228PubMed Google Scholar). Both vectors code for a geneticin (G418) resistance under a SV40 promoter. In addition, the vector NaPi-2/pLKneo contains a cDNA coding for the rat renal type II Na+/Picotransporter (NaPi-2) under a dexamethasone-inducible promoter. All cell culture supplies were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. (Basel, Switzerland). Opossum kidney cells (clone 3B/2) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium (1:1) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 22 mm NaHCO3, 20 mm Hepes, 2 mml-glutamine, 50 IU/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air at 37 °C. Monolayers on permeable filter supports were grown on Millicell-CM filter inserts (Millipore; 12-mm diameter, 0.45-μm pore size) coated with a very thin film of rat tail collagen (R type, 0.5 mg/ml in 50% ethanol; Serva, Basel, Switzerland). Cells were seeded at approximately 1–2 × 105 cells/filter and were re-fed with fresh medium every 12 h until reaching confluency 24 h after seeding. Transport studies were commenced 36 h after seeding. The tightness of confluent cell monolayers has been measured by resistance measurements as described previously (22Reshkin S.J. Forgo J. Murer H. Eur. J. Physiol. 1990; 416: 554-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For transfection, cells grown to a confluency of approximately 60% in 35 mm dishes (Nunc) were incubated for 16 h with 20 μl of a 1:1 mixture of water and Lipofectin (Life Technologies) containing 10 μg of either NaPi-2/pLKneo or the same amount of empty vector pLKneo. Afterward, cells were trypsinized, split at a ratio of 1:30, and grown in 150-mm dishes (Nunc) in medium containing, in addition, 400 μg/ml active geneticin. After 1–2 weeks, colonies of geneticin-resistant cells were isolated by ring cloning, expanded, and analyzed for the expression of the NaPi-2 protein by immunoblotting (see below). For experimental purposes, transfected cells were used within 10 passages. Dexamethasone induction was performed by an incubation with 1 μm dexamethasone (Sigma) for 20 h (10,000-fold stock, made in ethanol). Cells grown to confluency in 10-cm Petri dishes were incubated either with or without dexamethasone (1 μm) for 20 h and washed twice with TBS (0.9% NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). 15 ml of TBS containing 4 mm EDTA and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added, and the cells were scraped off the dish. The scraped cells were homogenized 5 times with a 20-ml syringe connected to a 20-gauge needle. This homogenate was centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C (Sorvall centrifuge, SS-34 rotor). The postnuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 16,000 rpm for 40 min at 4 °C (Sorvall centrifuge, SS-34 rotor). The pellet corresponding to a crude membrane preparation was resuspended in 100 μl of 50 mm mannitol, 10 mm Hepes-Tris (pH 7.2). In experiments in which the PTH-mediated degradation of the Na+/Pi cotransporter was investigated, the total cell homogenate was centrifuged at 31,000 rpm (100,000 g) for 60 min at 4 °C (Sorvall ultracentrifuge OTD 50B/T865 rotor) to ensure that all membranes were contained within the pellet. The pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of 50 mm mannitol, 10 mm Hepes-Tris (pH 7.2). The protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay. 50 μg of total protein were used for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (9%) and subsequent transfer to nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell, Inc.; 0.45 μm). Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubating the nitrocellulose at room temperature for 2 h in TBS (0.9% NaCl, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4) containing 5% nonfat dry milk and 1% Triton X-100 (Blotto-TX-100, pH 7.4). The transfected NaPi-2 protein was detected using a polyclonal antiserum raised against the N terminus of the NaPi-2 protein (14Custer M. Lötscher M. Biber J Murer H. Kaissling B. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: F767-F774PubMed Google Scholar) (antibody dilution, 1/4000). The intrinsic NaPi-4 protein was detected using a polyclonal antiserum raised against the C-terminal 12 amino acids of the published NaPi-4 sequence (8Sorribas V. Markovich D. Hayes G. Stange G. Forgo J. Biber J. Murer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6615-6621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (antibody dilution, 1/2000). Incubation with the primary antibody took place overnight at 4 °C. The nitrocellulose was washed four times with TBS, 10% Blotto-TX-100 (pH 7.4) and incubated for 1 h with Blotto-TX-100 (pH 7.4) at room temperature. Then the nitrocellulose was incubated with a 1:10,000 dilution of an anti-rabbit IgG labeled with horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Life Science, Inc.) in Blotto-TX-100 (pH 7.4) for 2 h at room temperature. The nitrocellulose was washed four times with TBS, and the signals were detected by enhanced chemiluminescense (Amersham) according to manufacturer protocol using Kodak X-Omat AR films. For peptide protection assays, the corresponding antigenic peptide was included at a concentration of 100 μg/ml. Broad range SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis molecular mass marker proteins (Bio-Rad) were run in parallel. NaPi-2-transfected and untransfected 3B/2 OK cells were grown to confluency on coverslips as well as on permeable filter supports, as described previously (22Reshkin S.J. Forgo J. Murer H. Eur. J. Physiol. 1990; 416: 554-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). After washing three times with PBS containing 0.5 mmMgCl2 and 1 mm CaCl2, cells were fixed for 10 min at room temperature with PBS supplemented with 3% paraformaldehyde, washed three times with PBS, incubated 10 min with 20 mml-glycine in PBS, and washed again (3 times) with PBS. Permeabilization was performed by an incubation for 30 min with PBS containing 0.1% saponin (PBS/saponin). After one wash with PBS/saponin, cells were incubated with anti-NaPi-2 (14Custer M. Lötscher M. Biber J Murer H. Kaissling B. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: F767-F774PubMed Google Scholar) or anti-NaPi-4 antiserum at a dilution of 1:100 in PBS/saponin for 1 h at room temperature and washed three times with PBS/saponin. Thereafter, the cells were incubated with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated IgG (Dakopatts, Denmark) (dilution, 1:50) and phalloidine rhodamine (Calbiochem) (dilution, 1:50) in PBS/saponin. After incubation for 30 min in the dark, cells were washed three times with PBS/saponin and once with PBS. Coverslips were mounted using Dako-Glycergel (Dakopatts) plus 2.5% 1,4-diazabicyclo-[2.2.2]octane (Sigma) as a fading retardant. Immunofluorescence was revealed by confocal microscopy (Zeiss laser scan microscope 310; Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). OK cell monolayers grown on collagen-coated porous filter supports were prefixed with 0.25% glutaraldehyde in 0.16 m cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2) for 30 min at room temperature, postfixed with 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.16m cacodylate buffer also for 30 min at room temperature, and washed three times with 0.16 m cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2) for 5–10 min. After that, the monolayers were osmicated with 1% OsO4 in 0.16 m cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2) for 1 h at 37 °C, washed three times with 0.16 mcacodylate buffer, dehydrated in an acetone series, and dried by the critical point method. The specimens were then examined in a scanning electron microscope 505 (Philips, Eindhoven). Na+-dependent and -independent transport of phosphate was determined in cells grown to confluency on either plastic dishes (35 mm; Nunc) or on permeant filter supports (8 mm), as described previously (22Reshkin S.J. Forgo J. Murer H. Eur. J. Physiol. 1990; 416: 554-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, uptake solutions consisted of 137 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 2.8 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mmMgSO4, 10 mm Hepes-Tris (pH 7.4), and 0.1 mm KH232PO4 (1 μCi/ml). For Na+-independant uptake, NaCl was replaced equimolarly by N-methyl-d-glucamine·HCl. Routine uptake on plastic dishes was performed at room temperature for 6 min and then stopped by washing the cells four times with ice-cold stop solution (137 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2). Cells were solubilized with 1% Triton X-100, and radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation. Transport rates are expressed as nmol of Pi taken up/mg of total cellular protein, which was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay. For transport assays on permeant filter supports, growth medium was aspirated, and both sides of the monolayer were gently rinsed twice in substrate-free uptake solution. Filter insert monolayers were then placed in a 24-well culture plate (Nunclon) for uptake measurements. Substrate-free uptake solution (500 μl) was added to the appropriate filter insert compartment, andN-methyl-d-glucamine·HCl-uptake solution was added to the opposite compartment. Transport was initiated by mixing 50 μl of the same uptake solution containing an 11-fold concentration of the desired radioactive substrate to the uptake solution already present in the filter insert compartment. Uptake was stopped as described above. Nonspecific binding (blanks) was assessed measuring zero time uptake inN-methyl-d-glucamine·HCl-uptake solution by starting uptake and immediately aspirating the uptake solution. Nonspecific binding was <10% that of radioactivity associated with any experimental point. Total radioactivity incorporated into the monolayer was measured by liquid scintillation counting of the whole filter insert. Incubation of OK cells with PTH has been described previously (22Reshkin S.J. Forgo J. Murer H. Eur. J. Physiol. 1990; 416: 554-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Treatment of OK cells with cycloheximide to prevent protein synthesis has also been described previously (27Malmstrom K. Murer H. FEBS Lett. 1987; 216: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Statistical results are expressed as mean ± S.E. for three dishes. Significance was accepted at p < 0.05. Experiments were repeated at least twice, and one representative experiment was choosen for presentation. The results presented concerning the transfected NaPi-2 were obtained with one single clone of NaPi-2-transfected 3B/2 OK cells. Qualitatively, the same results were obtained with two other clones of stably NaPi-2-transfected 3B/2 OK cells. To study transport function, transfected OK cells were grown to confluency on plastic Petri dishes and exposed to 1 μm dexamethasone for 20 h to induce the expression of the transfected NaPi-2. As illustrated in Fig.1, induction of NaPi-2 expression in transfected OK cells by dexamethasone led to an approximately 2-fold stimulation of the Na+-dependent Pi transport, whereas dexamethasone had no significant effect on the Na+/Pi cotransport activity in empty vector-transfected and in untransfected OK cells. Furthermore, dexamethasone had no effect in any of the tested cell lines on the Na+-independent Pi transport (Fig. 1 and data not shown). Corresponding experiments have been carried out with NaPi-2-transfected OK cells grown to confluency on collagen-coated porous filter supports. By measuring the Pitransport at the apical and basolateral membrane separately in induced and noninduced NaPi-2-transfected OK cells, it was found that the additional Pi uptake, as observed in cells grown on Petri dishes (Fig. 1), is entirely restricted to the apical membrane (data not shown).Figure 2Expression of the NaPi-2 protein in transfected OK cells, and expression of the intrinsic NaPi-4 protein in untransfected OK cells.NaPi-2-transfected (A) and untransfected OK cells (B) were grown to confluency on Petri dishes and, where indicated (DEX, +), were treated with dexamethasone (1 μm, 20 h). Crude membrane preparations were analyzed by immunoblotting using an anti-NaPi-2 antiserum (A) or an anti-NaPi-4 antiserum (B). Incubation with primary antibody was performed in the absence (Peptide, −) or in the presence (Peptide, +) of the corresponding antigenic peptide (peptide protection). The staining seen above the 116-kDa region in the Fig. 2 A is unspecific (see text).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 1Dexamethasone-induced expression of Na+/Pi cotransport in NaPi-2-transfected OK cells. OK cells (NaPi-2-transfected, empty vector-transfected, and untransfected OK cells) were grown to confluency on plastic Petri dishes and, where indicated (DEX, +), were exposed to 1 μm dexamethasone for 20 h. Dexamethasone-induced NaPi-2-transfected OK cells showed an approximately 2-fold stimulation of the Na+/Pi cotransport activity, whereas dexamethasone had no significant effect on the intrinsic Na+/Pi cotransport in empty vector-transfected and untransfected OK cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Transfected OK cells were also analyzed for expression of the NaPi-2 protein. Induction of NaPi-2-transfected OK cells by dexamethasone (1 μm, 20 h) led to the expression of a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 95–120 kDa (Fig. 2). An excess of the corresponding antigenic peptide (100 μg/ml) prevented the appearance of this band completely. The band seen above the NaPi-2 protein is unspecific: it is neither induced by dexamethasone nor protected by the antigenic peptide (Fig. 2 A). The intrinsic type II transporter protein (NaPi-4) was detected by the use of an antiserum directed against the C terminus of NaPi-4. Fig.2 B shows the NaPi-4-specific signal detected with membranes obtained from untransfected OK cells. Specificity of the anti-NaPi-4 antiserum was established by peptide protection assay with the corresponding antigenic peptide (100 μg/ml; Fig.2 B). Comparing Fig. 2 A with Fig. 2 Bshows that the intrinsic NaPi-4 and the transfected NaPi-2 have approximately the same molecular mass (95–120 kDa). Furthermore it is seen that the anti-NaPi-2 antiserum does not cross-react with the intrinsic NaPi-4 (Fig.2 A, transfected cells in the absence of dexamethasone). Expression of the type II transporter was also analyzed by immunofluorescence. Immunofluorescence pictures obtained by confocal microscopy showed that both the intrinsic NaPi-4 (Fig.3 A) and the transfected NaPi-2 (Fig. 3 B) are localized at the apical membrane within distinct clusters of a diameter of about 1–2 μm, whereas no type II Na+/Picotransporter-specific staining was seen at the basolateral membrane. The immunohistochemical staining of the transfected NaPi-2 as well as of the intrinsic NaPi-4 could be specifically abolished by the corresponding antigenic peptide (100 μg/ml; data not shown). In Figs. 3 A and 3 B, the parallel staining for β-actin (a component of the microvillar cytoskeleton) is shown. It is apparent that NaPi-4-specific (Fig. 3 A) and NaPi-2-specific (Fig. 3 B) staining on the apical cell surface coincides with the β-actin staining. In addition to the above apical staining, β-actin is also present at the basolateral cell surfaces (Fig. 3 A and 3B). Visualization of the apical surface of OK cells by scanning electron microscopy showed that microvilli are expressed at the apical surface, forming distinct clusters (Fig. 3 C); the diameter of the clusters corresponds well with the diameter of the clusters seen by immunofluorescence double staining for β-actin and the corresponding type II Na+/Pi cotransporter. Therefore the data given in Fig. 3 (A–C) documents that intrinsic and transfected type II Na+/Pi cotransporters are predominantly expressed at the apical cell surface (most likely within microvilli). Fig.4 summarizes the effect of PTH (10−8m; 4 h) on the Na+-dependent Pi transport in NaPi-2-transfected OK cells as well as in untransfected OK cells. PTH inhibited the Na+-dependent Pi transport activity in control cells by about 60%. A similar inhibitory effect of PTH was observed in NaPi-2-transfected cells that were not treated with dexamethasone. In cells expressing the NaPi-2 transporter (induced by dexamethasone), PTH also inhibited the additionally expressed Na+/Pi cotransport activity. Interestingly, the residual transport activity after PTH treatment was similar in all cells tested. This latter observation is in agreement with earlier studies (21Reshkin S.J. Forgo J. Murer H. Eur. J. Physiol. 1990; 416: 624-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 27Malmstrom K. Murer H. FEBS Lett. 1987; 216: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) demonstrating a PTH-insensitive Na+/Pi cotransport activity in OK cells. The effect of PTH on the type II Na+/Picotransporter protein content was investigated by immunoblotting. Fig.5 shows that incubating OK cells for increasing times with PTH (10−8m) leads to a time-dependent decrease of NaPi-4 and NaPi-2 protein expressed in OK cells. We conclude that the whole protein was degraded due to PTH action and that both transfected (NaPi-2) and intrinsic transporter (NaPi-4) behave very similar, i.e. are degraded. The finding that PTH leads to the degradation of the type II Na+/Picotransporter is in agreement with our previous observation that the recovery of the Na+/Pi cotransport after PTH-mediated inhibition is dependent on de novo protein synthesis (27Malmstrom K. Murer H. FEBS Lett. 1987; 216: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 28Quamme G. Pfeilschifter J. Murer H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1013: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To evaluate whether the recovery of the transport was due to de novo synthesis of type II Na+/Pi cotransporter, cell monolayers were exposed to 10−8m PTH for 4 h, PTH was removed, and cell monolayers were incubated with normal medium in the presence or absence of 20 μm cycloheximide for 2 or 4 h. The results presented in Fig. 6show that the reappearance of the transporter is dependent on de novo protein synthesis. It is also seen that 4 h after PTH removal, the reappearance of the transporter is not completed. Parallel measurements of the Na+/Pi cotransport showed that after 4 h of PTH removal, the recovery of the Na+/Pi cotransport is also incomplete. This is in agreement with our previous observation that complete recovery of Na+/Pi cotransport from PTH inhibition takes about 10–12 h (28Quamme G. Pfeilschifter J. Murer H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1013: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).Figure 6Reappearance of the NaPi-4 protein after PTH removal requires de novo protein synthesis. Confluent OK cell monolayers were incubated for 4 h with PTH (10−8m). Then the culture medium was removed, cells were repeatedly washed with normal medium to remove the PTH, and cells then incubated with medium with or without 20 μm cycloheximide for 2 and 4 h, respectively. The above Western blot shows clearly that the reappearance of the transporter is dependent on de novo protein synthesis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The retrieval of the intrinsic (NaPi-4) and the transfected cotransporter (NaPi-2) upon addition of PTH could also be documented by immunofluorescence. Consistent with the data presented above (Figs. 4, 5, 6), we found that incubating OK cells with PTH (10−8m) leads to a time-dependent decrease of NaPi-4-dependent immunofluorescence and NaPi-2-dependent immunofluorescence at the apical membrane of OK cells (data not shown). After 4 h of PTH treatment (10−8m), the Na+/Pi cotransporter type II-specific immunofluorescence staining in untransfected (Fig.7 A) and NaPi-2-transfected OK cells (Fig. 7 B) was virtually absent. Corresponding immunofluorescence pictures (double immunofluorescence) stained for β-actin clearly showed that under these conditions the microvilli were still present at the apical surface of OK cells. With the aim to detect the retrieved Na+/Pi cotransporters within intracellular vesicles, we have treated OK cells for increasing times with PTH (0, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 h; data not shown). As mentioned above, we observed a time-dependent decrease of the NaPi-4-specific staining and NaPi-2-specific staining at the apical surface. However, we were not able to detect a significant amount of NaPi-4 protein or NaPi-2 protein within intracellular vesicles at any time points (data not shown). As already suggested by the experiments presented in Fig. 5, a delay between a PTH-dependent membrane retrieval and intracellular degradation seems to be absent or minimal. Previous studies on rats have suggested that inhibition of Na+/Pi cotransport in renal proximal tubules by PTH involves a retrieval of the type II Na+/Picotransporter (NaPi-2) from the brush border membrane (15Kempson S.A. Lötscher M. Kaissling B. Biber J. Murer H. Levi M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F784-F791PubMed Google Scholar). The recent cloning of the type II Na+/Picotransporter of OK cells (NaPi-4; Ref. 8Sorribas V. Markovich D. Hayes G. Stange G. Forgo J. Biber J. Murer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6615-6621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the obvious limitations of an in vivo system to study molecular mechanisms prompted us to investigate the regulation of this transporter by PTH in OK cells. OK cells are a renal epithelial cell line that has been used successfully to investigate mechanisms involved in the control of proximal tubular Na+/Picotransport by PTH (21Reshkin S.J. Forgo J. Murer H. Eur. J. Physiol. 1990; 416: 624-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 27Malmstrom K. Murer H. FEBS Lett. 1987; 216: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In the present study, we stably transfected OK cells with a cDNA coding for the rat type II Na+/Pi cotransporter (NaPi-2) and investigated whether similar mechanisms are involved in the PTH-mediated regulation of the intrinsic (NaPi-4) and the transfected transporters (NaPi-2). On immunoblots, appearance of the transfected (NaPi-2) and the intrinsic (NaPi-4) cotransporter proteins resembled each other closely. The broad staining pattern (95–120 kDa) of these transporters likely represents different degrees of glycosylation, which for the NaPi-2 protein, has recently been demonstrated (29Hayes G. Busch A. Lötscher M. Waldegger S. Lang F. Verrey F.Biber Murer J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24143-24149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of the rat type II Na+/Pi cotransporter was also demonstrated by transport experiments. Dexamethasone-induced NaPi-2-transfected OK cells exhibited an approximately 2-fold-stimulated transport activity compared with uninduced NaPi-2-transfected or control cells (untransfected and empty vector-transfected). Immunofluorescence experiments demonstrated an exclusive apical localization for both Na+/Pi cotransporters (intrinsic and transfected), that, in the case of the intrinsic NaPi-4, is in agreement with earlier transport studies performed with OK cells grown on permeant filter supports (22Reshkin S.J. Forgo J. Murer H. Eur. J. Physiol. 1990; 416: 554-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Furthermore, immunofluorescence demonstrated a concentration of the intrinsic as well as of the transfected Na+/Pi cotransporters within clustered microvillar structures. It is suggested that such a distinct concentration of the Na+/Pi cotransporters within the microvilli may be due to a yet unknown interaction of these transporters with components of the microvillar cytoskeleton. Clearly no immunostaining related to these transporters was detected in the basolateral membrane, suggesting a specific apical sorting mechanism for the type II Na+/Pi cotransporters in OK cells. In contrast, we recently demonstrated that the NaPi-2, when transfected into Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, is expressed to equal amounts at the apical and basolateral membrane (25Quabius E.S. Murer H. Biber J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: F220-F228PubMed Google Scholar). The observed different sorting behavior of the same transporter in two different cell lines indicates that not only molecular determinants are decisive for a polarized sorting but that also the cellular context is of importance. This has also been documented for other proteins and cell systems. For example, it has been shown that aquaporin-2, when transfected into LLC-PK1cells, is, upon cAMP stimulation, inserted into the basolateral membrane rather than into the apical membrane as suggested from studies on native renal epithelia (30Katsura T. Verbavatz J.M. Farinas J. Ma T. Ausiello D.A. Verkman A.S. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7212-7216Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In previous studies it has been demonstrated that the intrinsic apical Na+/Pi cotransport activity in OK cells is inhibited by PTH (21Reshkin S.J. Forgo J. Murer H. Eur. J. Physiol. 1990; 416: 624-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 27Malmstrom K. Murer H. FEBS Lett. 1987; 216: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In the present study we extended this observation by showing that the inhibition of the Na+/Pi cotransport by PTH in OK cells is paralleled by the disappearance of the apical, Na+/Pi cotransporter-specific immunofluorescence staining within the microvilli. It is also shown that PTH leads to the degradation of the type II Na+/Pi cotransporter in OK cells. This finding is in agreement with our earlier observation demonstrating that the recovery of Na+/Pi cotransport activity from PTH inhibition in OK cells is dependent on de novo protein synthesis. Correspondingly, we found that the recovery of Na+/Pi cotransport activity from PTH inhibition was paralleled on immunoblots by the reappearance of the type II Na+/Pi cotransporter protein. In the presence of cycloheximide, there was neither a recovery of transport activity nor a reappearance of the specific transporter protein. As documented by immunoblots and by immunohistochemical studies presented in this paper, PTH leads to an almost complete retrieval and degradation of the type II Na+/Pi cotransporter (Figs. 5 and 7). However, even after prolonged exposures to PTH, a “refractory” residual Na+/Pi cotransport activity is observed (Fig. 4 and Ref. 21Reshkin S.J. Forgo J. Murer H. Eur. J. Physiol. 1990; 416: 624-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This implies that this residual activity (∼40% of total transport activity) is not related to the type II Na+/Pi cotransporter but could be associated with, for example, the type I transporter. Such conclusions are also valid for the Na+/Pi cotransport activity in rat brush border membranes; 2 h of PTH treatment leads to a much higher reduction of the NaPi-2 protein compared with the reduction in Na+/Pi cotransport activity (15Kempson S.A. Lötscher M. Kaissling B. Biber J. Murer H. Levi M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F784-F791PubMed Google Scholar). The present study clearly indicates that the regulation of the type II Na+/Pi cotransporter in renal proximal tubules and in OK cells is very similar. One apparent difference exists: after PTH treatment of OK cells for various lengths (0.5, 1, 2, and 4 h) we were not able to detect a significant transient intracellular staining specific for the type II Na+/Picotransporter. In rat proximal tubules, the degradation of the NaPi-2 protein seems to be delayed (compared with the OK cell system), permitting a visualization of an increased intracellular NaPi-2 protein content after short (15 min to 1 h) but not after prolonged treatments with PTH (15Kempson S.A. Lötscher M. Kaissling B. Biber J. Murer H. Levi M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F784-F791PubMed Google Scholar). Despite this difference, the similarities in the regulation of this transporter by PTH in OK cells and in rat renal proximal tubules are evident. Furthermore, in this report we demonstrated that the transfected (NaPi-2) and intrinsic type II Na+/Pi cotransporters (NaPi-4) are regulated in OK cells in the same way by PTH. OK cells are therefore a physiologically relevant in vitrosystem for the study of the regulation of the type II Na+/Pi cotransporter type II. They are a useful tool to dissect the molecular/cellular mechanisms involved in the PTH-mediated internalization and subsequent degradation of the transporter. Although it is tempting to assume a final breakdown of these Na+/Pi cotransporters within lysosomes, the mechanisms involved in internalization, trafficking, and subsequent degradation are completely unknown. In summary, the present study shows (i) that the intrinsic (NaPi-4) and the transfected rat type II Na+/Pi cotransporter (NaPi-2) are functionally and morphologically localized at the apical membrane, (ii) that the intrinsic as well as the transfection-mediated (NaPi-2) Na+/Pi cotransport activities are inhibited by PTH, (iii) that PTH leads to the disappearance of both cotransporters from the apical membrane, and (iv) that both cotransporters are rapidly degraded in response to PTH. These results suggest that PTH leads to the endocytosis of the type II Na+/Pi cotransporters from the apical membrane and to their subsequent degradation, thereby leading to the down-regulation of the Na+/Pi cotransport.

Kinetic and pharmacological studies showed that delayed PGE2 generation by this cell line in response to interleukin (IL)-1β and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) was dependent upon cytosolic phospholipase A2(cPLA2) and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2. Expression of these two enzymes was reduced by cPLA2 or COX-2 inhibitors and restored by adding exogenous arachidonic acid or PGE2, indicating that PGE2 produced by these cells acted as an autocrine amplifier of delayed PGE2 generation through enhanced cPLA2 and COX-2 expression. Exogenous addition or enforced expression of type IIA sPLA2 significantly increased IL-1β/TNFα-initiated PGE2 generation, which was accompanied by increased expression of both cPLA2 and COX-2 and suppressed by inhibitors of these enzymes. Thus, our results revealed a particular cross-talk between the two PLA2enzymes and COX-2 for delayed PGE2 biosynthesis by a type IIA sPLA2-deficient cell line. cPLA2 is responsible for initiating COX-2-dependent delayed PGE2 generation, and sPLA2, if introduced, enhances PGE2 generation by increasing cPLA2and COX-2 expression via endogenous PGE2.

Discovery of the inducible isoform of cyclooxygenase (COX), COX-2, has provided new insight into the mechanism that regulates delayed PG generation (1Smith W.L. Garavito R.M. DeWitt D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33157-33160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1838) Google Scholar). Thus, pharmacological and genetic studies have revealed that the inducible COX-2, rather than the constitutive COX-1, is the dominant enzyme involved in the delayed, prolonged phase of PG biosynthesis (2Reddy S.T.

Despite an apparent functional segregation of the two COX isoforms, however, whether the phospholipase A2(PLA2) enzymes, which lie upstream of the COXs in the PG-generating pathway, are functionally segregated is still rather controversial. The properties of type IV cytosolic PLA2(cPLA2) support its crucial role in the burst release of arachidonic acid in the immediate response following receptor ligation (5Clark J.D. Lin L.-L.

Several lines of evidence have shown that an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ levels is a prerequisite for cPLA2 activation, demonstrating its dissociation from the delayed response that is not accompanied by intracellular Ca2+ mobilization (7Hoeck W.G.

Shelhamer J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 571-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Conversely, others have demonstrated the involvement of cPLA2 in delayed PG generation (9Lin L.-L. Lin A.Y. DeWitt D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23451-23454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Roshak A. Sathe G. Marshall L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25999-26005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although the molecular mechanisms leading to cPLA2 activation under conditions with no Ca2+signaling are poorly understood. Type IIA secretory PLA2(sPLA2), one of the 14-kDa PLA2 enzymes, is reported to contribute to the arachidonic acid metabolism under certain conditions (11Murakami M. Kudo I. Inoue K. J. Lipid Mediat. Cell Signal. 1995; 12: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). It is released from the secretory granules of inflammatory cells (12Murakami M. Kudo I. Suwa Y. Inoue K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and its production by a wide variety of cells is often induced by proinflammatory stimuli (13Oka S. Arita H. J. Biol.

The involvement of type IIA sPLA2 in delayed PG generation by certain cell types has been demonstrated by pharmacological, immunochemical, and molecular biological studies (14Murakami M. Kudo I.

In vivo studies showed that various sPLA2 inhibitors attenuated inflammation partially (17Tanaka K. Kato T. Matsumoto K. Yoshida T. Inflammation. 1993; 17: 107-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), type IIA sPLA2 exacerbated edema when injected into inflamed tissues (18Murakami M. Kudo I. Nakamura H. Yokoyama Y. Mori H. Inoue K. FEBS Lett. 1990; 268: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and type IIA sPLA2 transgenic mice displayed more severe inflammatory responses than normal mice when subjected to proinflammatory stimuli (19Chapdelaine J.M. Ciofalo V.B. Grass D.S. Felkner R.H. Wallace R.E. Swanson M.E. Arthritis Rheum. 1995; 38: S293Google Scholar), providing support for an augmentative, rather than initiatory, role of type IIA sPLA2 in biological responses. Our earlier studies revealed that type IIA sPLA2 association with proteoglycans on plasma membranes is important for this sPLA2 to exert its actions (20Murakami M. Nakatani Y. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30041-30051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). More recently, a novel type V sPLA2 has been shown to be important for stimulus-initiated arachidonic acid release (21Balboa M.A. Balsinde J. Winstead M.V. Tischfield J.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32381-32384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 22Reddy S.T. Winstead M.V. Tischfield J.A. Herschman H.R. J. Biol.

This finding reveals the redundancy of sPLA2 family members and may account for why some inbred mouse strains, in which the type IIA sPLA2 gene is naturally disrupted due to an extra thymidine insertion into exon 3, leading to a frameshift mutation that produces a severely truncated non-functional type IIA sPLA2 protein (23MacPhee M.

In an attempt to resolve the functional cross-talk between PLA2 and COX enzymes, we have taken advantage of a cell line derived from type IIA sPLA2-deficient C57BL/6J mouse (23MacPhee M.

Here we show that in C57BL/6J-derived MC3T3-E1 cells, cPLA2 is functionally linked to COX-2 for cytokine-induced delayed PGE2 generation, and type IIA sPLA2augments it when enforcedly introduced. Furthermore, we have obtained evidence that PGE2 acts as an autocrine amplifier of these responses by increasing the expression of both cPLA2 and COX-2, thereby revealing a positive feedback loop of the PG biosynthetic route in this particular cell line. Antibodies and cDNAs for cPLA2, type IIA sPLA2, COX-1 and COX-2, and the COX inhibitors used are described elsewhere (20Murakami M. Nakatani Y. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30041-30051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Arachidonic acid, PGE2, and the PGE2 enzyme immunoassay kit were purchased from Cayman Chemical. Arachidonoyl trifluoromethyl ketone (AACOCF3) was purchased from Calbiochem. Mouse osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells (Riken Cell Bank) were maintained in α-MEM medium (Dainippon Pharmaceutical) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mmglutamine. MC3T3-E1 (5 × 104 cells/ml) in 500 μl or 2 ml of culture medium were seeded onto 24- or 6-well plates, respectively, and after 3 days when the cells had reached confluence, 500 μl or 2 ml of fresh culture medium, respectively, with or without 5 ng/ml mouse interleukin (IL)-1β (Genzyme) and/or 1,000 units/ml mouse tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα Genzyme), was added to each well to activate the cells. The supernatants were taken for PGE2 enzyme immunoassay, and for immunoblot analysis, the cells were trypsinized, washed once with 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl (phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)), and resuspended in cell lysis buffer (20Murakami M. Nakatani Y. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30041-30051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) to produce 1 × 107 cells/ml. As described below for the RNA blot analysis, TRIzol (Life Technologies) was added directly to the cell monolayers grown in 6-well plates. Equal amounts (∼10 μg) of total RNA, purified using TRIzol reagent, were applied to each lane of 1.2% (w/v) formaldehyde-agarose gels, electrophoresed, and transferred to Immobilon-N membranes (Millipore). The resulting blots were then sequentially probed with cPLA2, COX-2, COX-1, and β-actin cDNA probes that were labeled with [32P]dCTP (Amersham Life Science, Inc.) by random priming (Takara Biomedicals Inc.). All hybridizations were carried out under high stringency condition as described previously (20Murakami M. Nakatani Y. Kudo I. J. Biol.

Cell lysates were applied to 10% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electrophoresed under reducing condition. The separated proteins were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) using a semi-dry blotter (MilliBlot-SDE system; Millipore), according to the manufacturer instructions. The membranes were probed with antibodies against cPLA2, COX-2, and COX-1 and visualized with the ECL Western blot analysis system (Amersham Life Science, Inc.) as described previously (20Murakami M. Nakatani Y. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30041-30051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To amplify mouse type IIA sPLA2 cDNA, the sense primer 5′-ATGAAGGTCCTCCTCCTGCTAG-3′ and antisense primer 5′-TCAGCATTTGGGCTTCTTCC-3′ were used (20Murakami M. Nakatani Y. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30041-30051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The RT-PCR was carried out using an RNA PCR kit (AMV) Version 2 (Takara), according to the manufacturer instructions, with 1 μg of total RNA from MC3T3-E1 cells as a template. Equal amounts of each RT product were PCR-amplified withex Taq polymerase (Takara) by 25 cycles consisting of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 57 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C. The amplified cDNA was resolved on 2% (w/v) agarose gels, transferred onto an Immobilon-N membrane, and probed with mouse type IIA sPLA2 cDNA prelabeled with [32]dCTP. To obtain genomic DNA, the cell lysate was incubated with 100 μg/ml proteinase K (Sigma) overnight at 55 °C. The DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, and reconstituted with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 1 mm EDTA. The DNA obtained was digested with BamHI (Takara) and a portion was separated on 1% (w/v) agarose gel, transferred to an Immobilon-N membrane, and probed with mouse sPLA2 cDNA prelabeled with [32P]dCTP. In accordance with the type IIA sPLA2 genotype (23MacPhee M. Chepenik K.P. Liddell R. Nelson K.K. Siracusa L.D. Buchberg A.M.

Recombinant mouse type IIA sPLA2expressed by Sf9 cells (Invitrogen) transfected with sPLA2cDNA using a baculovirus system was purified using sequential heparin-Sepharose and anti-sPLA2 antibody column chromatography, as described previously (25Ashraf M.M.D. Murakami M. Shimbara S. Amakasu Y. Atsumi G. Kudo I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 229: 726-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The purity of the recombinant enzyme was checked with a silver staining kit (Wako), and the amount was determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Approximately 1 μg of mouse type IIA sPLA2 cDNA subcloned into pCR™3 (Invitrogen) (20Murakami M. Nakatani Y. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30041-30051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) was mixed with 5 μl of CellFection (Life Technologies) in 200 μl of Opti-MEM medium (Life Technologies) for 15 min and then added to MC3T3-E1 cells that had attained 60–80% confluence in 6-well plates and had been supplemented with 0.8 ml of Opti-MEM. After incubation for 6 h, the medium was replaced with 2 ml of fresh culture medium, the cells were cultured overnight, the medium was replaced again with 2 ml of fresh medium, and cultured for a further 2 days. For the study of transient expression, the cells were then cultured with or without IL-1β/TNFα. To establish stable sPLA2 transformants, transfected cells were cloned by limiting dilution in 96-well plates in culture medium supplemented with 400 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies). After culture for 21 days, wells containing a single colony were chosen and sPLA2 expression was assessed by RT-PCR. The established clones were expanded and used for the experiments. When MC3T3-E1 cells were stimulated with the combination of 5 ng/ml IL-1β and 1,000 units/ml TNFα, PGE2 was generated, reaching a peak within 3–6 h followed by a plateau phase up to 24 h with a second increasing phase from 24 to 48 h (Fig.1 A). When cultured with IL-1β/TNFα, the time course of PGE2 generation was parallel to that of COX-2 protein expression, which was undetectable before stimulation, induced markedly within 3–6 h, and followed by a plateau phase and a further increase over 24–48 h (Fig.1 B). COX-2 mRNA, which was undetectable in the absence of IL-1β/TNFα, increased to reach its maximal level at 3 h, decreased from 3 to 6 h, and then increased again to reach a second peak over 24–48 h (Fig. 1 C). The cPLA2protein was constitutively expressed in MC3T3-E1 cells and increased markedly during stimulation with IL-1β/TNFα for 12–48 h (Fig.1 B), accompanied by a modest increase in expression of its mRNA (Fig. 1 C). COX-1 protein, which was expressed constitutively, also increased after stimulation with IL-1β/TNFα for 12–48 h (Fig. 1 B), in parallel to the increased expression of COX-1 mRNA (Fig. 1 C). Dose-response experiments, assessed after 48 h, revealed that optimal PGE2 generation occurred when >1.2 ng/ml IL-1β (EC50 between 0.3 and 0.6 ng/ml) was added to the culture in the presence of TNFα (Fig.2 A). The dose-dependence of PGE2 generation on IL-1β showed close correlations with the increased expression of cPLA2 and COX-2 proteins, which reached maximal levels in the presence of 1.2 ng/ml IL-1β (Fig.2 B), whereas the COX-1 protein level attained its peak with as little as 0.3 ng/ml IL-1β (Fig. 2 B). IL-1β/TNFα-induced PGE2 generation was suppressed almost completely by 1 ng/ml NS-398 (COX-2 inhibitor (26Futaki N. Yoshikawa K. Hamasaka Y. Arai I. Higuchi S. Iizuka H. Otomo S. Gen. Pharmacol. 1993; 24: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar)) but was largely resistant to 10 μg/ml valeryl salicylate (COX-1 inhibitor (27Bhattacharyya D.K. Lecomte M. Dunn J. Morgans D.J. Smith W.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 317: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar)) (Fig. 3 A). Stimulation of cells in the co-presence of 10 μg/ml aspirin, which inactivated both COX-1 and -2 (28Medae E.A. Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6610-6614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), resulted in complete suppression of PGE2 generation, whereas pretreatment with 10 μg/ml aspirin, which irreversibly inactivated pre-existing COX-1 only, did not affect PGE2 generation (Fig. 3 A). PGE2 generation was also suppressed almost completely by 1 μm AACOCF3 (cPLA2 inhibitor (29Street I.P. Lin H.-K. Laliberte F. Ghomashchi F. Wang Z. Perrier H. Tremblay N.M. Huang Z. Weech P.K. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5935-5940Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar)) (Fig. 3 A). The IC50 values of NS-398 and AACOCF3 were approximately 0.1 ng/ml and 0.02 μm, respectively (Fig.4).Figure 4Dose-dependent effect of cPLA2 and COX-2 inhibitors on IL-1β/TNFα-induced PGE2 generation and cPLA2 and COX-2 protein expression. MC3T3-E1 cells were cultured for 48 h with 5 ng/ml IL-1β and 1,000 units/ml TNFα in the presence of the indicated concentrations of AACOCF3 or NS-398. A representative result of four independent experiments is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We found that when MC3T3-E1 cells were stimulated for 48 h with IL-1β/TNFα in the presence of NS-398 or AACOCF3, induction of proteins (Fig. 3 B) and transcripts (Fig.3 C) for cPLA2 and COX-2 was suppressed simultaneously to almost basal levels. The inhibition of cPLA2 and COX-2 expression was dependent upon the concentrations of these inhibitors and showed good correspondence with the reduction of PGE2 generation (Fig. 4). In contrast, these inhibitors did not affect COX-1 expression (Fig.5), and the COX-1 inhibitor, valeryl salicylate, had no effect on the induction of cPLA2 and COX-2 expression (Fig. 3, B and C). Notably, when exogenous PGE2 (10 μg/ml) was added to IL-1β/TNFα-stimulated cells cultured in the presence of AACOCF3 or NS-398, induction of both cPLA2 and COX-2 expression was restored completely (Fig. 3, B andC). Furthermore, adding exogenous PGE2 increased cPLA2 and COX-2 expression in cells stimulated with IL-1β/TNFα in the absence of these inhibitors even more, although adding PGE2 alone to unstimulated cells had no effect (Figs. 3 C and 5 A). The concentration of exogenous PGE2 required for the recovery of cPLA2 and COX-2 induction in NS-398-treated cells was 1–10 μg/ml (Fig.5 B), comparable with the amounts of PGE2produced by IL-1β/TNFα-stimulated cells in the absence of NS-398 (Fig. 1 A). These observations led us to hypothesize that PGE2 produced by IL-1β/TNFα-stimulated cells acted as an autocrine positive regulator of the induction of both cPLA2 and COX-2 expression. In support of this speculation, supplementing AACOCF3-treated cells with exogenous arachidonic acid, which bypassed cPLA2-mediated liberation of arachidonic acid from the endogenous pool, also restored the induction of cPLA2 and COX-2 expression (Fig. 3, B andC), and the concentration of exogenous arachidonic acid to do this was 10–100 μm (Fig. 5 C), under which conditions 1–10 μg/ml PGE2 was consistently produced. Although NS-398 inhibited COX-2, and thereby preventing metabolism of endogenous arachidonic acid to PGE2, excess exogenous arachidonic acid was utilized by COX-1 and metabolized to PGE2, which reached 1∼2 μg/ml, by NS-398-treated cells. Consequently, the addition of exogenous arachidonic acid to NS-398-treated cells restored cPLA2 and COX-2 expression partially (Fig. 3 B), which was suppressed considerably by valeryl salicylate (data not shown). In contrast to the marked suppression of the induction of cPLA2 and COX-2 expression by AACOCF3 and NS-398 after IL-1β/TNFα stimulation for 48 h (Fig. 3, B and C), the induction of COX-2 mRNA expression observed as early as 3 h was not affected by these inhibitors (data not shown). This result, together with the finding that an increase in the cPLA2 level was evident only after 12–48 h of culture (Fig. 1, B andC), suggests that potentiation of IL-1β/TNFα-induced cPLA2 and COX-2 induction by endogenous PGE2was limited to the later phase (12–48 h) of cell activation. COX-1 expression was affected neither by exogenous PGE2 nor by arachidonic acid (Fig. 5), providing further evidence that the mechanism responsible for the increase in COX-1 expression differs from that for cPLA2 and COX-2. To assess whether sPLA2 affected PGE2 generation by type IIA sPLA2-deficient MC3T3-E1 cells, two experiments were carried out. First, MC3T3-E1 cells were exposed to exogenous mouse recombinant type IIA sPLA2 in the presence or absence of IL-1β/TNFα. As shown in Fig.6 A, the addition of recombinant type IIA sPLA2 to IL-1β/TNFα-stimulated cells resulted in an increase in PGE2 generation of about 2-fold (Fig. 6 A), and this increase was accompanied by increased expression of cPLA2 and COX-2, but not COX-1 (Fig. 6 B). In contrast, neither an appreciable increase in PGE2 generation (Fig. 6 A) nor increased cPLA2 and COX-2 expression (Fig. 6 B) occurred when type IIA sPLA2 was added to unstimulated cells. In the second experiment, we transfected mouse type IIA sPLA2 cDNA into MC3T3-E1 cells with the aim of revealing the role of endogenous sPLA2 in PGE2generation. Cells transiently expressing type IIA sPLA2produced 1.7 times more PGE2 than control cells in response to cytokine stimulation, whereas such transient expression had no appreciable effect in the absence of cytokines (Fig.7 A, left). When PGE2 biosynthesis by two independent stable sPLA2 transformants (E2 and A10), in which the sPLA2 transcript that control (E1) cells did not possess was detectable by RT-PCR (Fig. 7 A, inset), was assessed, there were 1.6- and 2.2-fold increases in IL-1β/TNFα-induced PGE2 generation by E2 and A10, respectively, relative to that by E1 (Fig. 7 A,right). PGE2 generation by both sPLA2 transformants was suppressed almost completely by AACOCF3 or NS-398, implying that cPLA2 and COX-2 are involved in the enhanced PGE2 generation resulting from ectopic sPLA2 expression. In accordance with PGE2 regulation of the enzyme expression, the IL-1β/TNFα-induced expression levels of proteins (Fig.7 B) and mRNA (Fig. 7 C) for COX-2 and cPLA2 in sPLA2 transformants were higher than those in control cells, whereas the COX-1 expression levels did not correlate with their abilities to produce PGE2. In this study, we obtained evidence that the murine osteoblastic cell line MC3T3-E1, which originates from C57BL/6J strain that is genetically deficient in functional type IIA sPLA2 (23MacPhee M. Chepenik K.P. Liddell R. Nelson K.K. Siracusa L.D. Buchberg A.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 957-966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar,24Kennedy B.P. Payette P. Mudgett J. Vadas P.

Chem. 1995; 270: 22378-22385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), exhibits delayed PGE2 generation in response to IL-1β and TNFα that is dependent upon cPLA2 and COX-2, with PGE2 acting as an autoamplifier. The findings that COX-2-dependent delayed PGE2 generation occurred even in the absence of type IIA sPLA2 but was augmented significantly following the enforced introduction of type IIA sPLA2 implies that type IIA sPLA2 is dispensable, but capable of participating, as an enhancer, in the COX-2-dependent delayed PGE2 generation. Moreover, the enhancing effect of type IIA sPLA2 on delayed PGE2 generation was mediated predominantly by increased cPLA2 and COX-2 expression, thereby revealing an unexplored and unambiguous cross-talk between PG biosynthetic enzymes to provide an optimal response in this cell line. Cytokine-induced PGE2 generation was suppressed completely not only by NS-398 (IC50 ∼ 0.1 ng/ml) but also by AACOCF3 (IC50 ∼ 0.02 μm), implying the involvement of COX-2 and cPLA2 in the delayed response. An unexpected finding was that treating cells with either NS-398 or AACOCF3 led to concordant reduction of the expression of cPLA2 and COX-2, and supplementing IL-1β/TNFα-stimulated cells with exogenous PGE2 or arachidonic acid abrogated the inhibitory actions of these inhibitors on the expression of both enzymes. Notably, the induction of COX-2 expression was biphasic as evidenced by steady-state expression of its transcript; during the first phase, occurring by 3 h, it was independent of PGE2, whereas during the second phase, proceeding over 12–48 h, it was subjected to autocrine amplification by PGE2. Unlike COX-2, increased cPLA2expression was evident only after 12–48 h, occurring in parallel with the second phase of COX-2 induction. These results suggest that endogenous PGE2 is a prerequisite for the cytokine-induced increase in cPLA2 expression. Since the increase in cPLA2 protein was more obvious than that in cPLA2 mRNA, a significant post-transcriptional regulation of the expression of its protein must occur, as has been demonstrated in cytokine-stimulated mast cells (30Murakami M. Matsumoto R. Urade Y. Austen K.F. Arm J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3239-3246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 31Murakami M. Austen K.F. Bingham III, C.O. Friend D.S. Penrose J.F. Arm J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22653-22656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). PGE2 generation occurred as early as 3 h after the initiation of activation when COX-2 expression had already been induced, but cPLA2 expression remained unchanged (Fig. 1). These results, together with those of several previous studies (7Hoeck W.G. Ramesha C.S. Chang D.J. Fan N. Heller R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4475-4479Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 8Wu T. Levine S.J. Lawrence M.G. Logun C. Angus C.W. Shelhamer J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 571-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), indicate that increased cPLA2 expression is not the sole factor, but post-translational modification of this enzyme is essential for its function. Yamamoto and co-workers (32Takahashi Y. Taketani Y. Endo T. Yamamoto S. Kumegawa M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) showed that transient arachidonic acid release preceded the initial rise in PGE2generation by TNFα-stimulated MC3T3-E1 cells. We also observed a significant increase in arachidonic acid release following IL-1β/TNFα stimulation that reached a peak within 1–2 h (data not shown). It is therefore likely that this early arachidonic acid release promoted the initial phase of COX-2-dependent PGE2 generation. Nevertheless, as both IL-1β and TNFα are poor Ca2+-mobilizers, cPLA2 activation throughout the culture period might occur through a Ca2+-independent pathway. Although both IL-1β and TNFα are known to activate several mitogen-activated protein kinase family members (33Liu Z.-G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1779) Google Scholar), which in turn phosphorylate cPLA2 at Ser-505 and increase its catalytic activity to some extent (6Lin L.-L.

Chem. 1996; 271: 27723-27729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). A recently described novel phosphorylation site on cPLA2(Ser-727) might account, at least in part, for the Ca2+-independent regulation of cPLA2 (35de Carvalho M.G.S. McCormack A.L. Olson E. Ghomashchi F. Gelb M.H. Yates III, J.R. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6987-6997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), although this has not been proved directly. Although COX-1 expression during culture increased in parallel with cPLA2 and the second phase of COX-2 induction, the failure of NS-398 and AACOCF3 to suppress the increase in COX-1 expression and the inability of exogenous PGE2 and arachidonic acid to increase it suggest that the induction of COX-1 expression is regulated independently of PGE2. COX-1 has been shown to have the capacity to metabolize excess exogenous arachidonic acid to PGs (2Reddy S.T. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15473-15480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this, we found that exogenous arachidonic acid was converted to PGE2 through the COX-1 pathway by NS-398-treated MC3T3-E1 cells. Alternatively, and more physiologically, COX-1 has been implicated in immediate PG biosynthesis utilizing endogenously derived arachidonic acid, such as IgE-dependent PGD2 generation by mast cells (3Murakami M. Matsumoto R. Austen K.F. Arm J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22269-22275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), thromboxane generation by thrombin-stimulated platelets (36Langenbach R. Morham S.G. Tiano H.F. Loftin C.D. Ghanayem B.I. Chulada P.C. Mahler J.F. Lee C.A. Goulding E.H. Kluckman K.D. Kim H.S. Smithies O. Cell. 1995; 83: 483-492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar), and PGE2 generation by A23187-stimulated COS-7 cells overexpressing cPLA2 and COX-1 (37Huang Z. Payette P. Abdullah K. Cromlish W.A. Kennedy B.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3712-3721Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Increased COX-1 expression in mast cells leads to priming for increased immediate PGD2 synthesis (30Murakami M. Matsumoto R. Urade Y. Austen K.F. Arm J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3239-3246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Therefore, changes in COX-1 expression may reflect the particular stage of cell differentiation, enabling the differentiated cells to produce more PGs rapidly when they are exposed to exogenous arachidonic acid or encounter any stimulus that initiates immediate PG biosynthesis involving functional linkage of cPLA2 and COX-1. Exogenous addition or enforced expression of type IIA sPLA2led to significant enhancement of IL-1β/TNFα-initiated PGE2 generation by type IIA sPLA2-deficient MC3T3-E1 cells, whereas sPLA2 alone had no appreciable effect on PGE2 generation. These observations are in line with the currently proposed hypothesis that type IIA sPLA2contributes to the enhancement, rather than initiation, of biological responses (11Murakami M. Kudo I. Inoue K. J. Lipid Mediat. Cell Signal. 1995; 12: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 17Tanaka K. Kato T. Matsumoto K. Yoshida T. Inflammation. 1993; 17: 107-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 18Murakami M. Kudo I. Nakamura H. Yokoyama Y. Mori H. Inoue K.

Of particular importance are the findings that the introduction of type IIA sPLA2 was accompanied by increased expression of both cPLA2 and COX-2 and that enhanced PGE2 generation was suppressed by AACOCF3 and NS-398. The most likely explanation for these observations is that sPLA2 hydrolyzes plasma membrane phospholipids, leading to the production of a small amount of PGE2, which in turn amplifies the cPLA2/COX-2-dependent PGE2biosynthetic pathway. An alternative possibility is that sPLA2 elicits the induction of cPLA2 and COX-2 expression through the sPLA2 receptor, independently of its phospholipid-hydrolyzing activity (38Lambeau G. Ancian P. Barhanin J. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1575-1578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the only sPLA2 receptor on MC3T3-E1 cells identified so far is type I sPLA2-specific (39Tohkin M. Kishino J. Ishizaki J. Arita H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2865-2871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the almost complete abrogation of sPLA2-enhanced PGE2 generation by AACOCF3 suggests that cPLA2-derived arachidonic acid accounts for the majority of the arachidonic acid released (i.e. sPLA2 is an upstream modulator of cPLA2) or that, as demonstrated by Balsinde and Dennis (40Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6758-6765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), functional cPLA2 is required for sPLA2 to exert its action (i.e. cPLA2 is an upstream modulator of sPLA2). The fact that type IIA-deficient inbred mouse strains display no abnormality (23MacPhee M. Chepenik K.P. Liddell R. Nelson K.K. Siracusa L.D. Buchberg A.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 957-966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 24Kennedy B.P. Payette P. Mudgett J. Vadas P. Pruzanski W. Kwan M. Tang C. Rancourt D.E. Cromlish W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22378-22385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) suggests that some other sPLA2s could substitute for type IIA sPLA2 function. In view of this standpoint, type V sPLA2 has been recently shown to be an alternative effector of arachidonate metabolism (21Balboa M.A. Balsinde J. Winstead M.V. Tischfield J.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32381-32384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 22Reddy S.T. Winstead M.V. Tischfield J.A. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13591-13596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In our preliminary study, any sPLA2 activity, assessed under the standard sPLA2 assay condition (20Murakami M. Nakatani Y. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30041-30051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), was not detected in MC3T3-E1 cells (data not shown). Therefore the contribution of type V sPLA2 to PGE2 generation in this cell line appears to be negligible, even though the possiblity that a pretty low level of endogenous type V sPLA2 still participates in it as a modifier cannot be ruled out. Moreover, it would be possible that exogenous type V sPLA2 compensates for type IIA sPLA2 to augment PGE2 generation in a similar way. Nonetheless, not only did this study reveal functional coupling of cPLA2 and sPLA2 with COX-2, in which cPLA2 and sPLA2 act as an initiator and an enhancer, respectively, of delayed PGE2 generation, but it also revealed a mechanism whereby sPLA2 augments the delayed response by inducing cPLA2 and COX-2 expression. However, the pathway shown here, which utilizes a metabolite as a signal amplifier (PGE2 in this case), may not be always applicable to other systems, but rather limited to particular cell types. For instance, the induction of COX-2 expression in cytokine-stimulated mast cells was not affected by several PLA2 and COX inhibitors, indicating that the regulatory mechanism was PG-independent (41Murakami M. Bingham III, C.O. Matsumoto R. Austen K.F. Arm J.P. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4445-4453PubMed Google Scholar). Arachidonic acid up-regulated, whereas PGE2 down-regulated, the induction of COX-2 in uterine stromal cells (42Prigent-Tessier A. Pageaux J-F. Fayard J-M. Lagarde M. Laugier C. Cohen H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 872-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). IL-1β-induced arachidonic acid release and subsequent COX-2-dependent PGE2 generation were augmented significantly in sPLA2-transfected compared with normal CHO-K1 cells, without accompanying changes in cPLA2 and COX-2 expression (20Murakami M. Nakatani Y. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30041-30051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In mouse calvaria cells, cPLA2 did not couple with IL-1α-induced COX-2 to produce PGE2 unless a rapid increase in the intracellular Ca2+ levels was triggered by a secondary Ca2+-mobilizing stimulus (43Chen Q-R.

These observations imply the mechanisms responsible for PG biosynthesis by discrete PLA2s differ according to the cell type. We thank Drs. J. D. Clark, W. L. Smith, J. Trzaskos, and J. P.

The DNA encoding Fip-gts was isolated from a cDNA library of G. tsugae by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. The complete amino acid sequence of Fip-gts, deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the cDNA, was the same as LZ-8 isolated from Ganodermn lucidum. Recombinant Fip-gts was expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein inEscherichia coli with a yield of 20 mg/liter of culture. Recombinant Fip-gts, purified to homogeneity, had the same blast formation stimulatory activity to human peripheral blood lymphocytes as native Fip-gts.The yeast two-hybrid system and site-directed mutagenesis were used to determine whether dimerization of Fip-gts occurred. Deletion analysis of the N-terminal amphipathic α-helix domain of Fip-gts identified a sequence of about 10 amino acids responsible for inducing immunomodulatory activity. Non-functional Fip-gts deletion mutants did not form dimers, whereas wild type Fip-gts did as determined by gel filtration. A mutant with deletions at Leu-5, Phe-7, and Leu-9 lost the amphipathic characteristics of the N-terminal domain and the ability to form dimers as well as its immunomodulatory activity.Fusion of Fip-gts with the DNA binding and the transactivation domains of GAL4 resulted in the activation of thelacZ activator gene, indicating the interaction of Fip-gts with it itself. The dimerization domain was further defined by analyzing the ability of the N-terminal 13 amino acids or Leu-5, Phe-7, and Leu-9 deletion mutants of Fip-gts to interact with the wild type Fip-gts. These experiments confirmed the N-terminal amphipathic α-helix as the dimerization domain and suggest that the dimerization of Fip-gts may play an important role in Fip-gts immunomodulatory activity.

A new family of fungal immunomodulatory proteins (Fips) 1The abbreviations used are: Fip, fungal immunomodulatory protein; hPBL, human peripheral blood lymphocytes; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; IL-2; interleukin-2; IL-4, interleukin-4; IFN-γ, interferon-γ GST, glutathioneS-transferase; bp, base pair(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction. has recently been established. Four Fips have been isolated and purified from Ganodermn lucidum,Flammulina veltipes, Volvariella volvacea, andGanoderma tsugae and designated as LZ-8, Fip-fve, Fip-vvo, and Fip-gts, respectively (1Kino K.

J. 1997; 323: 557-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Fips are mitogenic in vitro for human peripheral blood lymphocytes (hPBLs) and mouse splenocytes, and induce a bell-shaped dose-response curve similar to that for lectin mitogens. Activation of hPBLs with Fips results in the increased production of IL-2, IFN-γ, and tumor necrosis factor-α molecules associated with ICAM-1 expression (2Ko J.L. Hsu C.I. Lin R.H. Kao C.L. Lin J.Y.

J. 1997; 323: 557-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Fips can also act as immunosuppressive agents;in vivo these proteins can prevent systemic anaphylactic reactions and significantly decrease footpad edema during the Arthus reaction (1Kino K. Yamashita A. Yamaoka K. Watanabe J. Tanaka S. Ko K. Shimizu K. Tsunoo H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 472-478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Ko J.L. Hsu C.I. Lin R.H. Kao C.L. Lin J.Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 244-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). LZ-8 can also suppress autoimmune diabetes in young female non-obese diabetes mice (4Kino K. Mizumoto K. Sone T. Yamazi T. Watanabe J. Yamashita A. Yamaoka K. Shimizu K. Ko K. Tsunoo H. Diabetologia. 1990; 33: 713-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Furthermore, LZ-8 has a significant effect on cellular immunity, as shown by the increase of graft survival in transplanted allogenic mouse skin and allogenic pancreatic rats (5van der Heun L.G. van der Vleit J.A. Bocken C.F.M. Kino K. Hoitsmn A.J. Tax W.J.M.

Warzock R. Transplantation. 1986; 41: 44-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The Fips identified to date have a molecular mass of 13 kDa and share high amino acid sequence homology. Alignment of these proteins revealed 44% identity and 42% homology for approximately 110 amino acid residues. The Fips are rich in β-structure by secondary structure prediction, and contain seven β-strands, two α-helices, and one β-turn. The amphipathic α-helix is a common structural motif, which is found in a number of functional proteins or peptides and is involved in various functions such as glucagon binding to its receptor, plasma apolipoproteins solubilization of lipids, antimicrobial peptide disintegration of bacterial cells, and signal peptide targeting to mitochondria (8Shai Y Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 460-464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). In the present study, we isolated a fungal immunomodulatory protein, Fip-gts. The cloned cDNA of Fip-gts was expressed in Escherichia coli, and a putative amphipathic α-helix was identified at the N-terminal 13 amino acid residues, which would be essential for the formation of the active Fip-gts dimer. We employed a yeast two-hybrid system (9Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4880) Google Scholar, 10Chien C.T. Bartel P.L. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9578-9582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar) and site-directed mutagenesis to examine Fip-gtsdimerzization. Plasmids in which Fip-gts was fused with both the GAL4 DNA binding domain and transactivation domain were constructed, and these plasmids were transformed together into yeast to activate the lacZ indicator gene, to examine the interaction of Fip-gts with itself. We also assayed the ability of Fip-gts deletion mutants to interact with the wild type Fip-gts. These studies map the dimerization domain to the amphipathic N terminus of Fip-gts, which is responsible for inducing immunomodulatory activity. The dimerization of wild type Fip-gts was verified by chemical cross-linking with glutaraldehyde. Matchmaker Two-Hybrid System 2 was purchased fromCLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). Yeast strain Y187 (MATα, ura3–52, his3–200, ade2–101, trp1–901, leu2–3, 112, gal4Δ, met − , gal80Δ, URA3:: GAL1USA-GAL1TATA-lacZ) was used for assaying protein-protein interactions. Y187 has the upstream activating and TATA sequences of the GAL-1 promotor fused to the lacZ gene such that LacZ is responsive to GAL-4 transcriptional activation. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits for measuring human IL-2 and IFN-γ were obtained from R&D Systems Inc. (Minneapolis, MN), and Medgenix Corp. (Fleureus, Belgium), respectively. Glutathione-Sepharose 4B gel and pGEX-2T were purchased from Pharmacia (Uppsala, Sweden), and RNA markers were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. The pBS(+) plasmid was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase was purchased from CLONTECH. Taq DNA polymerase was obtained from Promega (Madison, WI, USA). Chemicals for nucleotide sequence analysis were purchased from Applied Biosystems Inc. (Foster, CA). Restriction endonucleases were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim GmbH (Mannheim, Germany). All other chemicals used were of analytical grade. Total cellular RNA was isolated from the mycelia of G. tsugae by homogenization in 4 m guanidium thiocyanate. Poly(A)+ RNA was recovered with messenger affinity paper, and total cDNA was synthesized by using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase followed by DNA polymerase (11Gubler U. Hoffman B.J. Gene ( Amst. ). 1983; 25: 283-287Crossref Scopus (3077) Google Scholar). Two primers were prepared based on the amino acid sequence of LZ-8 isolated fromG. lucidium (12Murasugi A. Tanaka S. Komiyama N. Iwata N. Kino K. Tsunoo H. Sakuma S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2486-2493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Primer A encodes the first 8 N-terminal amino acid residues of LZ-8, and primer B encodes the last 8 C-terminal amino acid residues.Primer A:5′­TCCGACCACTGCCTTGATCTTCAG­3′(forward)Primer B:5′­TTAGTTCCACTGGGCGATGATGAA­3′(reverse)PCR was carried out to synthesize the Fip-gtscDNA by using primer A and primer B. The amplified DNA was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, and DNA bands were stained with ethidium bromide and then visualized by ultraviolet light, at 300–360 nm. The DNA band of 330 bp was cut out, put in a dialyzing tube with TAE buffer (20 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0, 1 mmEDTA), and extracted by electrophoresis at 60 V for 1 h. The solution containing the DNA fragment was treated with phenol/chloroform (1:1), and the DNA fragment was precipitated by adding 95% ethanol containing 0.44 m ammonium acetate, pH 5.0. The DNA fragment was ligated into vector pBS(+), which had been cut previously with SmaI and treated with calf intestine phosphatase. The ligation mixture was used to transform E. coli TG1 cells. Plasmids containing the 330-bp fragment were sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method using Sequenase version 2 (13Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). All inserts were sequenced on both strands at least twice. Various primers were used to amplify Fip-gts deletion mutants. All forward primers contained BamHI sites and the reverse primers contained EcoRI sites for ligation into the expression vector, pGEX-2T (14Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene ( Amst. ). 1988; 67 (, 31–40): 667Google Scholar). The resulting construct, pGTFip-gts, contained both the GST and Fip-gtsgenes.

When the cells reached a density of 4 × 108 cells/ml, they were induced by adding 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and the culture was incubated for an addition 3 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 10 ml of ice-cold resuspension buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm magnesium chloride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The cells were treated with lysozyme (0.2 mg/ml) and then lysed by three cycles of freeze/thawing. The cell lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 20,000 × gfor 20 min, and the supernatant was directly applied onto a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (2 ml), which was equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The column was washed with 20 ml of equilibrium buffer and then eluted with 5 mm reduced glutathione in the equilibrium buffer to obtain the fusion protein (15Hung C.H. Lee M.C. Lin M.T. Lin J.Y. Gene ( Amst. ). 1993; 127: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The active fractions were identified by the blast formation stimulatory activity assay and then pooled. The fusion protein was treated with thrombin at an enzyme to substrate molar ratio of 1:100 in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0 at 25 °C for 2 h. The reaction products were applied onto a Mono Q column (1.6 mm × 50 mm), which was equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, and then eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 0.3 msodium chloride in the same buffer. The active fractions were detected in the first peak as assayed by the blast formation stimulatory activity described previously (2Ko J.L. Hsu C.I. Lin R.H. Kao C.L. Lin J.Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 244-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Yeast shuttle vectors pAS2–1 and pACT2, containing the GAL4 DNA binding domain and GAL4 activation domain, respectively; pVA3 (the p53 gene); and pTD1 (SV40 large T antigen) were obtained fromCLONTECH. Fip-gts cDNA was amplified by PCR using pcFip-gts as template, primer M encoding the first 8 N-terminal amino acid residues with a BamHI restriction site, primer N encoding the last 8 C-terminal amino acid residues with a PstI restriction site, and primer O encoding the last 8 C-terminal amino acid residues with an EcoRI restriction site. To obtain the Fip-gts gene without its N-terminal 13 amino acid residues or Leu-5, Phe-7, and Leu-9, primers P and Q with a BamHI site were used as forward primers. PCR products run on an 1% agarose gel, eluted from the gel by electrophoresis, and ligated to the vectors, pAS2–1 and pACT2, respectively.Primer M(forward):5′­GGGATCC¯GTTCCGACACTGCCTTG­ATC­3′Primer N(reverse):5′­GGCTGCAG¯GTTAGTTCCACTGGGC­GAT­3′Primer O(reverse):5′­GGGAATTC¯GTTAGTTCCACTGGGC­GAT­3′Primer PΔL5/F7/L9(forward):5′­GGGATCC¯GTTCCGACACTGCCATC­AGG­3′Primer QΔN1–13(forward):5′­GGGATCC¯GTAAGAAGCTCTCGTTC­GAC­3′All constructs were sequenced to confirm the fidelity of the wild type Fip-gts in pAS2–1 and wild type Fip-gts or various deletion mutants in pACT2. Sequencing was performed using the Sequenase kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). pAS2–1-Fip-gts, the two-hybrid DNA binding vector, was transformed into Y187 cells by the lithium acetate method (16Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestal R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2899) Google Scholar, 17Hill J. Donald K.A. Griffiths D.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5791Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Colonies of this transformant were Trp−. The Y187 transformant was grown overnight in SD/Trp− selection medium to ensure the presence of pAS2–1-Fip-gts in every cells. The overnight culture was transformed with 0.1 μg of wild type or Fip-gts mutant inserted into the pACT2 two-hybrid activation vector. Double transformed cells were incubated on SD/Trp−,Leu− plates at 30 °C for 5 days. Yeast containing both GAL-4 binding and activation domain fusion proteins were analyzed for β-galactosidase activity using filter and liquid assay methods. For the filter assay method, the positive yeast colonies were transferred to nitrocellulose filter and submerged in liquid nitrogen for 10 s to permeabilize the cells. The nitrocellulose filter was then placed on filter paper, which had been treated with Z-buffer containing 60 mmNa2HPO4, 40 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1.0 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside at 30 °C for 6 h. For the liquid assay, the cultures were grown overnight in the SD/Trp−,Leu− medium, and the cells were diluted 5-fold in rich media (YPD) and grown to mid-log phase (A 600, 0.4–0.8). The cells were resuspended in 100 μl of Z-buffer, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, thawed at 37 °C, and then treated by vortexing with glass beads. After cell disruption, 700 μl of Z-buffer (containing 60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and 160 μl ofo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside in Z-buffer were added, and the hydrolysis ofo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside was measured at A 420. β-Galactosidase activity is represented in Miller units (18Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1972Google Scholar), and the results are expressed as the mean of triplicate measurements ± S.D. Wild type Fip-gts and mutant proteins were separately cross-linked with various concentrations of glutaraldehyde. Cross-linking was carried out for 2 h at room temperature, and then the reaction was terminated with 5 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.0, and further incubated for 20 min at room temperature (19Lin S.H. Chow L.P. Chen Y.L. Liaw Y.C. Chen J.K. Lin J.Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 564-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Portions of the reaction mixtures (10 μl) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (12% polyacrylamide) (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). hPBLs were isolated from the heparinized peripheral blood of healthy adults by centrifugation over Ficoll-paque gradient medium (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). The cells (1 × 106 cells/ml) were cultured with or without stimulus in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin, 200 mml-glutamate, and 15% fetal calf serum in 96-well round bottom tissue culture plates under 5% CO2at 37 °C for 46 h. 10 μl of [3H]thymidine (0.25 μCi, Amersham) was added, and the cells were further incubated for 7 h under the same conditions and then harvested with an automated cell harvester onto a glass filter. The radioactivity of samples was determined with a Beckman model LS 250 scintillation counter. For cytokine analysis, the cells (2 × 106 cells/ml) were plated into 24-well flat-bottom tissue culture plates with or without Fip-gts. After 48 h of incubation under the same conditions as described above, the supernatant of the culture was harvested and the amounts of IFN-γ or IL-2 were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A 330-bp DNA fragment from the PCR amplification of G. tsugaecDNA was ligated into SmaI-linearized pBS(+). Three positive clones containing the 330-bp DNA fragment were isolated. The vector was transformed into E. coli strain TG1, and the purified recombinant plasmids were used as template for direct DNA sequence analysis. All three clones contained an open reading frame of 330 bp, which encoded 110 amino acids. The complete amino acid sequence of Fip-gts was deduced from the nucleotide sequence of Fip-gts cDNA (Fig. 1). Fip-gts has the same amino acid sequence as LZ-8. To study the structure and function of Fip-gts, we expressed the Fip-gts in E. coli. The soluble recombinant fusion protein of the expected molecular mass was purified on a glutathione affinity column. The GST portion of the recombinant Fip-gts fusion protein was cleaved with thrombin, and Fip-gts was purified on a Mono Q column. The yield of recombinant Fip-gts was about 20 mg/liter of induced culture. The recombinant Fip-gts and its mutant proteins contain two extra amino acid residues, Gly-Ser, at their N termini, which were part of the thrombin-sensitive linker. Recombinant Fip-gts and the mutant proteins appeared homogeneous on 12% SDS-PAGE gels (Fig.2). Wild type Fip-gts cDNA was fused with the DNA binding domain and the activation domain of GAL-4 to examine whether homodimers could form. When these plasmids were co-transformed into Y187 cells, the lacZ indicator gene was activated as shown by increased β-galactosidase activity (TableI). β-Galactosidase activity was not detected when yeast cells were transformed with the DNA binding domain of GAL-4 fused to Fip-gts (pAS2–1-Fip-gts) or the activation domain of GAL-4 fused to Fip-gts(pACT2-Fip-gts). Activation of lacZ was observed in positive control Y187 cells in which p53 was fused to the GAL-4 binding domain and the SV40 large T cell antigen was fused to the activation domain.Table Iβ-Galactosidase activity and filter color of fusion constructsProtein fused to GAL4 domainβ-galactosidase activityFilter colorDNA bindingActivatingpVA31-aThe plasmids pVA3 and pTD1 contain murine p53 and SV40 large T-antigen, respectively, interact strongly, and serve as a positive control.pTD11-aThe plasmids pVA3 and pTD1 contain murine p53 and SV40 large T-antigen, respectively, interact strongly, and serve as a positive control.20.8 ± 1.5BluepAS2–1-FIP-gtsNone0.1 ± 0.01WhiteNonepACT2-FIP-gts0.1 ± 0.01WhiteNonepACT2-ΔN1–130.2 ± 0.02WhiteNonepACT2-ΔL5/F7/L90.1 ± 0.01WhitepAS2–1-FIP-gtspACT2-FIP-gts1.9 ± 0.2BluepAS2–1-FIP-gtspACT2-ΔN1–130.2 ± 0.02WhitepAS2–1-FIP-gtspACT2-ΔL5/F7/L90.3 ± 0.02WhiteYeast strains Y187 were transformed with various combinations of plasmids and β-galactosidase activity was assayed.1-a The plasmids pVA3 and pTD1 contain murine p53 and SV40 large T-antigen, respectively, interact strongly, and serve as a positive control. Open table in a new tab Yeast strains Y187 were transformed with various combinations of plasmids and β-galactosidase activity was assayed. To probe the structure that is essential for the self-interaction of Fip-gts, the ability of the various Fip-gtsmutant proteins to interact with wild type Fip-gts was evaluated. Fip-gtsΔN1–13 fused to the transactivation domain (pACT2-Fip-gtsΔN1–13) was unable to associate with the wild type Fip-gts fused to the DNA binding domain (pAS2–1-Fip-gts), and Fip-gtsΔL5/F7/L9 (pACT2-Fip-gtsΔL5/F7/L9) was incapable of association with the wild type Fip-gts(pAS2–1-Fip-gts). Yeast transformed with the activation domain of GAL-4 fused to Fip-gtsΔN1–13 or Fip-gtsΔL5/F7/L9 by themselves failed to induce β-galactosidase activity. These results show that the N-terminal 13 amino acid residues of Fip-gts contain the essential elements necessary for the formation of homodimers. Chemical cross-linking experiments were carried out to demonstrate the presence of Fip-gtshomodimers. Various concentrations of glutaraldehyde were added to Fip-gts for 2 h at room temperature. The reaction products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig.3). When wild type Fip-gts was incubated with buffer alone, only monomeric Fip-gts was observed. In the presence of glutaraldehyde at concentrations higher than 20 μm, a new band was observed corresponding to a homodimer of about 26 kDa. Most Fip-gts appeared in the dimeric form at 200 μm glutaraldehyde. For the N-terminal deletion mutant, the Fip-gtsΔN1–13, only the monomeric 13-kDa species was observed at 200 μmglutaraldehyde (Fig. 3 A). Cross-linked dimeric products were also not detected for Fip-gtsΔL5/F7/L9 (Fig.3 B). The formation of dimeric species was further demonstrated by gel filtration (Fig. 4). The molecular mass of wild type Fip-gts was shown to be 26 kDa, while that of the deletion mutants, Fip-gtsΔN1–13 or Fip-gtsΔL5/F7/L9, was 13 kDa.Figure 4Estimation of the molecular weight of Fip-gts and mutants by gel filtration. The molecular weight of Fip-gts and mutants was determined in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, with a FPLC Superose 12 gel filtration column (10 mm × 300 mm).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The induction of cytokines from hPBLs by wild type Fip-gts or the deletion mutants was used to evaluate the effects of the deletions on immunomodulatory activity. The deletion mutants, Fip-gtsΔN1–13, Fip-gtsΔL5/F7/L9, and Fip-gtsΔ5–7 did not significantly induce IL-2 and γ-IFN, whereas mutant Fip-gtsΔN1–6 displayed 86% of the wild type Fip-gts activity. Other Fip-gts deletion mutants such as ΔL5, ΔF7, ΔL9, and ΔL5/F7 all exhibited the same activities as wild type Fip-gts. Three Fips have been isolated from F. veltipes (2Ko J.L. Hsu C.I. Lin R.H. Kao C.L. Lin J.Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 244-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar),V. volvacea (3Hsu H.C. Hsu C.I. Lin R.H. Kao C.L. Lin J.Y. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 557-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), and G. tsugae by our laboratory and named Fip-fve, Fip-vvo, and Fip-gts, respectively. These Fips exhibit high homology in their amino acid sequences, and alignment of their sequences revealed 51 invariant amino acid residues among the three Fips (Fig.5) (3Hsu H.C. Hsu C.I. Lin R.H. Kao C.L. Lin J.Y. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 557-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of Fip-gts cDNA was identical to LZ-8 isolated fromG. lucidium (1Kino K. Yamashita A. Yamaoka K. Watanabe J. Tanaka S. Ko K. Shimizu K. Tsunoo H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 472-478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We demonstrated that Fip-gts can be produced as a GST fusion protein in soluble form with a relatively high yield. Pure recombinant Fip-gts was obtained by treating the fusion protein with thrombin, followed by purification on a Mono Q column based on the different pI values of GST and Fip-gts. The yield of Fip-gts was relatively high with about 20 mg/liter of culture obtained. To study the contribution of the N-terminal 13 amino acids to the structure and function of Fip-gts, the secondary structure of Fip-gts was predicted by the method of Garnier et al. (21Garnier J. Osguthorpe D.J. Robson B. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 120: 97-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (3423) Google Scholar). Fip-gts was predicted to contain two α-helices, seven β-sheets, and one turn. The N-terminal 13 amino acid residues included 10 amino acids of the α-A-helix. Based on the method of Eisenberg et al. (22Eisenberg D. Weiss R.M. Terwilliger T.C. Wilcox W. Faraday Symp. Chem. Soc. 1982; 17: 109-120Crossref Google Scholar), an amphipathic structure could be constructed for Fip-gts but not for the inactive Fip-gtsΔN1–13 mutant. In addition, an amphipathic structure could not be drawn for the inactive Fip-gtsΔL5/F7/L9 mutant. The amphiphilicity perpendicular to the helical was quantitated by calculation of the hydrophobic moments (μH) of the wild type and mutant helices of Fip-gts (23Eisenberg D. Weiss R.M. Terwilliger T.C. Nature. 1982; 299: 371-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). The μH values for the α-A-helix in the N-terminal 13 amino acids of the active mutants ranged from 0.54 (ΔL5) to 0.21 (ΔL9); for the wild type α-A-helix, the μH value was 0.43. In contrast, the μH values for inactive mutants were less than 0.1. Therefore, the amphiphilicity of the α-A-helix correlated with function and the maximum μH was at least 0.54, while the minimum ranged between 0.00 and 0.10. Dimerization is an importance process for hormones and growth factors to bind to their receptors on the cell surface and exert their activity. For example, insulin and epidermal growth factor form homodimers for binding to their receptors (8Shai Y Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 460-464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The N-terminal α-A-helix of Fip-gts may play an important role in the formation of homodimers for binding to cell surface receptors to exert its immunomodulatory activity. The formation of homodimers could be attributed to the interaction of the hydrophobic faces of the helices. Because most of the 13 amino acid residues of the α-helix could be deleted in one or another while maintaining activity, the hydrophobic interaction may not depend on specific amino acid side chains or a specific sequence. Two-amino acid deletions (ΔL5/L7) were also dispensable for activity. However, removal of three amino acids (Δ5–7) disturbed the amphiphilicity of the α-A-helix and led to the loss of activity. The information from the present study may be applied to the design of proteins containing a N-terminal α-helix of 10 amino acid residues to form homodimers with higher activity than the monomeric proteins. Protein engineering for the rational design and efficient preparation of homodimers will allow us to extend our understanding of the structure and function of homodimers."

Integrin αvβ3 recognizes fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, and vitronectin, while αvβ1 does not. We studied the mechanisms for defining ligand specificity of these integrins by swapping the highly diverse sequences in the I domain-like structure of the β1 and β3 subunits. When the sequence CTSEQNC (residues 187–193) of β1 is replaced with the corresponding CYDMKTTC sequence of β3, the ligand specificity of αvβ1 is altered. The mutant (αvβ1–3-1), like αvβ3, recognizes fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, and vitronectin (a gain-of-function effect). The αvβ1–3-1 mutant is recruited to focal contacts on fibrinogen and vitronectin, suggesting that the mutant transduces intracellular signals on adhesion. The reciprocal β3–1-3 mutation blocks binding of αvβ3 to these multiple ligands and to LM609, a function-blocking anti-αvβ3 antibody. These results suggest that the highly divergent sequence is a key determinant of integrin ligand specificity. Also, the data support a recent hypothetical model of the I domain of β, in which the sequence is located in the ligand binding site.

Integrins are a family of α/β heterodimers of cell adhesion receptors that mediate cell-extracellular matrix and cell-cell interactions (1Springer T.A.

Although integrin-ligand interaction is a therapeutic target, we poorly understand at the molecular level how integrins recognize multiple ligands. Evidence suggests that the I or A domain, a set of inserted sequences consisting of about 200 amino acid residues, of several integrin α subunits (αM, αL, α1, α2) is important in ligand binding and receptor activation (reviewed in Ref. 6Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20438-20443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar and references therein). The presence of an I domain-like structure within the β subunit has been suggested based on the similarity in hydropathy profiles between the I domain and part of the β subunit (7Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this region of β has been reported to be critical for ligand binding and its regulation (reviewed in Ref. 8Loftus J.C. Smith J.W. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol.

A synthetic peptide of β3 (MDLSYSMKDDLWSI, residues 118–131) has been shown to produce a ternary complex with cations and ligand (14D'Souza S.E. Haas T.A. Piotrowicz R.S. Byers-Ward V. McGrath E.

Also, the sequence DDLW (residues 126–129 of β3) was shown to be critical for interaction with the RGD sequence using a phage display system (15Pasqualini R. Koivunen E. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1189-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). A synthetic peptide of β3, DAPEGGFDAIMQATV (residues 217–231 of β3), has been shown to bind to immobilized fibrinogen (Fg), 1The abbreviations used are: Fg, fibrinogen; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; Fn, fibronectin; Vn, vitronectin; vWf, von Willebrand's factor; mAb, monoclonal antibody; WT, wild type; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: Fg, fibrinogen; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; Fn, fibronectin; Vn, vitronectin; vWf, von Willebrand's factor; mAb, monoclonal antibody; WT, wild type; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. von Willebrand's factor (vWf), and fibronectin (Fn) (16Cook J.

A synthetic peptide of β3, SVSRNRDAPEG (residues 211–221 of β3), has been reported to block binding of Fg to αIIbβ3 (18Charo I.F. Nannizzi L. Phillips D.R. Hsu M.A. Scarborough R.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 6870-6873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We identified a small region of β1 (residues 207–218, a regulatory epitope) that is recognized by both activating and inhibiting anti-β1 antibodies (20Takada Y. Puzon W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17597-17601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These antibodies probably induce high or low affinity states, respectively, by changing the conformation of the β1 subunit through binding to the non-ligand binding site (20Takada Y. Puzon W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17597-17601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We and researchers at other laboratories have recently identified residues critical for ligand binding in the putative I domain-like structure of β1 (6Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20438-20443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), β2 (21Goodman T. Bajt M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 21978-21984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In β1, eight critical oxygenated residues are located in several separate predicted loop structures, which probably constitute multiple ligand/cation binding sites within the I domain-like structure of the β subunit. These critical oxygenic residues are conserved among integrin β subunits, indicating that these residues are ubiquitously involved in ligand binding regardless of ligand and integrin species. We observed that a large predicted loop region (residues 176–199 of β1) is diverse among the β subunits (Fig. 1). Furthermore, a recent structural model (23Tuckwell D. Humphries M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and our preliminary model (not shown) of the I domain-like structure of β suggest that the sequence is also on the same side of the domain as residues critical for ligand binding. We hypothesized that the predicted loop (especially the disulfide-linked short sequences, e.g. residues 187–193 of β1) is involved in ligand specificity of integrins. αvβ3 has been shown to recognize a wide variety of ligands, including Fn, Fg, vWf, and vitronectin (Vn); αvβ1 is specific to Fn. We designed experiments, using αvβ1 and αvβ3 integrins, to determine whether a diverse sequence in the predicted loop (e.g.residues 176–199 in β1, residues 166–190 in β3) is involved in ligand specificity of integrins. mAb 4B4 (to human β1) (24Morimoto C.

Yednock (Athena Neurosciences, San Francisco, CA). P5D2 (to human β1) and polyclonal anti-αv cytoplasmic peptide antibody were purchased from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). A Fn 110-kDa fragment was prepared from bovine plasma Fn (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described (31Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. Sundelin J. Lind P. Peterson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9593-9597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bovine Fg was purchased from Daiichi Chemical (Tokyo, Japan). Purified vWf was provided by Z. Ruggeri (Scripps). Bovine Vn was purified according to Yatohgo et al. (32Yatohgo T. Izumi M. Kashiwagi H. Hayashi M. Cell Struct. Funct. 1988; 13: 282-292Crossref Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Fg, Vn, and Fn 110-kDa fragment were coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The ligand concentration was 4.0, 1.2, and 2.3 mg/ml gel for Fg-, Vn-, and Fn 110-kDa fragment-Sepharose, respectively. The GRGDS peptide (6 mg/ml gel, Peptide Institute, Osaka, Japan) was coupled at the 6-carbon spacing arm of CH-Sepharose (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Human αv and β3 cDNAs were provided by J. Loftus (Scripps). Ten μg of wild-type human αv cDNA in pBJ-1 vector (33Takebe Y. Seiki M. Fujisawa J.-I. Hoy P. Yokota K. Arai K.-I. Yoshida M. Arai N. Mol.

Science. 1990; 249: 677-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) was transfected into parental CHO-K1 cells (8 × 106 cells) together with 1 μg of pFneo plasmid containing a neomycin-resistant gene by electroporation as described (35Irie A. Kamata T. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5542-5549Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). After they were selected for G418 resistance, cells expressing αv were cloned by cell sorting in FACStar cell sorter (Becton-Dickinson) with mAb LM142 (the cloned cells are designated αv-CHO cells). Human β1 or β3 (WT/mutant) cDNA in pBJ-1 vector was transfected into αv-CHO cells together with 1 μg of pCD-hygro plasmid with a hygromycin-resistant gene or into parent CHO cells together with 1 μg of pFneo; cells were then selected with hygromycin (500 μg/ml; Calbiochem) or G418 essentially as described above. Cells expressing human β1 or β3 were cloned by sorting with mAb A1A5 or 15 as described above. The flow cytometric analysis was carried out using FACScan (Becton-Dickinson). Wells of 96-well Immulon-2 microtiter plates (Dynatech Laboratories, Chantilly, VA) were coated with 100 μl of PBS (10 mm phosphate buffer, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4) containing Fg, vWf, Fn, and Vn at a concentration of 10 μg/ml overnight at 4 °C. The remaining protein binding sites were blocked by incubating with 1% bovine serum albumin (Calbiochem) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells (105 cells/well) in 100 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin were added to the wells and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. After gently rinsing the wells three times with PBS to remove unbound cells, bound cells were quantified using endogenous phosphatase activity (36Prater C.A. Plotkin J. Jaye D. Frazier W.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 1031-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested with 3.5 mm EDTA in PBS and washed with PBS. Cells (about 5 × 106) were then surface-labeled with 125I by using IODO-GEN (Pierce) (37Braciale T.J. Henkel T.J. Lukacher A. Braciale V.L. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 995-1002PubMed Google Scholar), washed three times with PBS, and solubilized in 1 ml of 100 mm octyl glucoside in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4 (TBS), containing 2.5 mm MnCl2, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma) at 4 °C for 15 min. The insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 15,000 ×g for 10 min. The supernatant was then incubated with a small amount of underivatized Sepharose 4B at 4 °C for 15 min to remove nonspecific binding material. The supernatant was incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with 200–500 μl of packed Fg-, Vn-, Fn 110-kDa fragment-, or GRGDS-Sepharose that had been equilibrated with TBS containing 2.5 mm MnCl2, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 mm octyl glucoside (washing buffer). The unbound materials were washed with a 20 × column volume of washing buffer, and the bound materials were eluted with 20 mm EDTA instead of 1 mmMnCl2 in washing buffer; and then 0.5-ml fractions were collected. Twenty-μl aliquots from each fraction was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 7% polyacrylamide gel followed by autoradiography. Glass coverslips (Fisher) were treated with 10% KOH in methanol for 1 h at room temperature, washed three times with distilled H2O, and stored in ethanol. Etched coverslips were then coated with 50 μg/ml Fg, 50 μg/ml Fn, or 22 μg/ml Vn in PBS overnight at 4 °C and then blocked with 10 mg/ml heat-denatured bovine serum albumin (Calbiochem) in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. For plating experiments, cells were washed and then detached with 2.5 mm EDTA/PBS. Detached cells were isolated, washed, resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and then replated on coated coverslips. Cells were allowed to attach and spread for 2 h. Prior to fixation, cells were chilled on ice for 5 min, washed with cold PBS, and then extracted with cold PIPES buffer (0.1 m PIPES, pH 6.8, 1 mmMgCl2, and 1 mm EGTA) containing 1% glycerol and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 for 1–2 min. Extracted cells were washed with cold PIPES buffer and then fixed with 3.7% methanol-free formaldehyde (Polysciences) in PIPES buffer for 20 min at room temperature. Following fixation, cells were washed with PBS and then blocked with 10% normal goat serum (Life Technologies, Inc.)/PBS for 20 min at 37 °C. Human integrins were detected using either the anti-human β1 antibody P5D2 or the anti-human β3 antibody 15. Cells were immunostained for 1 h at 37 °C, washed, and then stained with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) for 30 min at 37 °C; cells were also labeled with rhodamine phalloidin (Molecular Probes) to detect actin stress fibers. Stained cells were mounted in Fluoromount-G (Fisher) and photographed using a Nikon Diaphot inverted microscope. Site-directed mutagenesis of the β1 and β3 cDNA in a pBJ-1 vector was carried out using unique restriction site elimination (38Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). The presence of mutations was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Immunoprecipitation was carried out as described previously (20Takada Y. Puzon W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17597-17601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether a diverse sequence in the predicted loop (residues 176–199 in β1 and residues 166–190 in β3) is involved in ligand specificity of integrins, we replaced the CTSEQNC sequence of β1 with the corresponding CYDMKTTC sequence of β3 by site-directed mutagenesis. The CYDMKTTC sequence of β3 has been reported to be disulfide-linked (39Calvete J.J. Henschen A. Gonzalez-Rodriguez J. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The resulting mutant β1–3-1, wild-type β1, or wild-type β3 cDNA constructs were transfected into either parental CHO cells or CHO cells expressing wild-type human αv (αv-CHO). Parent CHO cells have been reported to express endogenous hamster αv (40Ferrer M. Fernandez-Pinel M. Gonzalez-Manchon C. Gonzalez J. Ayuso M. Parrilla R. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1996; 76: 292-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) but not β3 (41Ylanne J. Chen Y. O'Toole T. Loftus J.C. Takada Y. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, we found that CHO cells express αvβ5 using mAb P3G2 (data not shown). The cloned cells expressing WT or mutant β1 in association with exogenous human αv are designated αvβ1-, αvβ1–3-1-, αvβ3-CHO cells, and those with only endogenous hamster αv are designated as β1-, β1–3-1-, β3-CHO cells. αvβ3 recognizes multiple ligands, including Fn, Fg, vWf, and Vn; αvβ1 is specific to Fn on CHO cells. Therefore, we tested the ligand specificity of the β1–3-1 mutant. As shown in Fig.2 A, we found that cells expressing αvβ3 or αvβ1–3-1, but not αvβ1, adhered to both Fg and vWf. Adhesion of the αvβ1–3-1- but not αvβ3-CHO cells was blocked by the inhibitory anti-human β1 mAb 4B4 (Fig.2 B), indicating that adhesion of the αvβ1–3-1-expressing cells to Fg and vWf is mediated by human β1 sequences. Similar results were obtained with the β1-, β3-, and β1–3-1-CHO cells (Fig. 2, A and B). These results suggest that the region spanning residues 187–193 of β1 or 177–184 of β3 is involved in the regulation of ligand specificity. The specificity of the interaction between αvβ1–3-1 and ligands was further analyzed by affinity chromatography. Lysates from surface 125I-labeled αvβ1–3-1-CHO cells (as well as control αvβ1- and αvβ3-CHO cells) were incubated with immobilized Fg or Fn 110-kDa fragments, and bound materials were eluted with EDTA. As shown in Fig.3 A, bands corresponding to αv and β1 in size were eluted from Fg-Sepharose using a lysate of αvβ1–3-1-CHO cells, while bands corresponding to human αv and β3 were eluted from Fg-Sepharose with a lysate of αvβ3-CHO cells. Immunoprecipitation of the eluate from αvβ1–3-1 cells using anti-β1 mAb A1A5 (Fig. 3 C, lane 5) and anti-αv mAb LM142 (Fig. 3 D, lane 5) confirmed that these two bands are human αv and β1 (β1–3-1). In contrast, very low levels of αv and β1 were detected in the Fg-Sepharose eluate with lysate of αvβ1-CHO cells. These results suggest that αvβ1–3-1 exhibits a much higher affinity for Fg than αvβ1. Similar results were obtained with Vn-Sepharose (data not shown), suggesting that αvβ1–3-1 shows a much higher affinity to Vn as well. In experiments done in parallel, we have detected bands corresponding to αvβ1, αvβ1–3-1, and αvβ3 in the eluate from Fn 110-kDa fragment-Sepharose with lysates from αvβ1-, αvβ1–3-1, and αvβ3-CHO cells, respectively (Fig.3 B). Immunoprecipitation confirmed that the major β subunits in the eluates are β1, β1–3-1, and β3, respectively (Fig. 3 C). These results suggest that the αvβ1–3-1 mutant, like αvβ3, binds to Fg, Vn, and Fn 110-kDa fragments in a solubilized form. Next we determined if the altered ligand specificity of the αvβ1–3-1 chimera affected intracellular signaling. Cells were plated on Fn, Vn, or Fg, and localization of the human integrin was determined by immunostaining with anti-human β1 (αvβ1 and αvβ1–3-1) or anti-human β3 (αvβ3). While all three receptors localized to focal adhesions in cells plated on Fn (Fig. 4, A,C, and F), only β1–3-1 and β3 localized to focal adhesions in cells on Vn; αvβ1-CHO cells did attach and spread on Vn due to endogenous αvβ5. However, αvβ1 exhibited a diffuse staining pattern. This result is consistent with the binding data and indicates that the αvβ1–3-1 chimera is able to generate intracellular signals. In addition, we found that the αvβ1–3-1 chimera, like αvβ3, induced cell spreading and focal adhesion formation in cells plated on Fg; αvβ1 cells did not adhere to Fg. Similar results were obtained with the β1-, β1–3-1-, and β3-CHO cells that express lower levels of the transfected integrins (data not shown). These results indicate that the αvβ1–3-1 chimera is a functional receptor and has the same signaling properties as αvβ3. To determine whether the reciprocal swapping mutation has any effect on the ligand specificity of αvβ3, we replaced the CYDMKTTC sequence of β3 (residues 177–184) with the corresponding CTSEQNC sequence of β1 (the β3–1-3 mutation). The resulting mutant β3–1-3 and WT β3 cDNA constructs were transfected into αv-CHO cells, and cells stably expressing αvβ3–1-3 or αvβ3 were cloned by sorting (αvβ3–1-3-CHO and αvβ3-CHO cells, respectively). The levels of αv and β3 expression were comparable in clonal WT αvβ3-CHO and αvβ3–1-3-CHO cells used. αvβ3–1-3-CHO cells showed significantly lower adhesion activity than αvβ3-CHO cells to both Fg and vWf; αvβ3–1-3-CHO cells required higher ligand concentrations for adhesion than WT αvβ3-CHO cells (Fig.5, A and B). In addition, solubilized αvβ3–1-3 did not bind to either Fg or Vn immobilized to Sepharose, although solubilized WT αvβ3 did (Fig.5 C). These results suggest that the β3–1-3 mutation significantly reduces binding of αvβ3 to Fg, Vn, and vWf. Although we observed that αvβ3–1-3 mutant binds to Fn 110-kDa fragments and to the GRGDS peptide on affinity chromatography (data not shown), we could not determine whether the β3–1-3 mutation changes the binding affinity of αvβ3 to Fn 110-kDa fragment or the GRGDSP peptide (because of the presence of other fibronectin receptors, endogenous αvβ1 and α5β1). The immunoprecipitation of whole lysate of αvβ3–1-3-CHO cells using anti-αv and anti-β3 mAbs showed that anti-αv and anti-β3 co-precipitated β3–1-3 and αv subunits, respectively, suggesting that the β3–1-3 mutation does not affect the α-β association. However, the αvβ3–1-3 mutant did not react with LM609, a function-blocking anti-αvβ3 mAb, upon immunoprecipitation (Fig.6) and flow cytometric analysis (data not shown), suggesting that the β3–1-3 mutation destroyed the LM609 epitope and that the CYDMKTTC sequence of β3 is closely located to ligand binding sites of αvβ3. We established that swapping the CTSEQNC sequence of β1 with the corresponding CYDMKTTC sequence of β3 induces significant changes in ligand specificity of αvβ1. The β1–3-1 mutation markedly increases affinity of αvβ1 to Fg, vWf, and Vn (a gain-of-function effect). Since the αvβ1–3-1 mutant is functional in cultured cells and transduces signals on adhesion to the ligands, the swapping did not induce a detectable adverse effect on the other receptor functions (e.g. α-β association and signal transduction). In reciprocal experiments, swapping a disulfide-linked CYDMKTTC sequence of β3 with the corresponding CTSEQNC sequence of β1 blocks the binding function of αvβ3 to Fg, vWf, and Vn. Taken together, the present study suggests that a small disulfide-linked CYMKTTC sequence of β3 (and the CTSEQNC sequence of β1 as well) defines a novel site of integrin β critical for ligand specificity. Sequence diversity among β subunits and localization within an I domain-like structure of β, close to putative ligand binding sites (see Introduction) is consistent with the proposed function of the sequence. In a preliminary study, we introduced mutations into the corresponding predicted loop of the β2 subunit. We found that these mutations showed profound effects on the ligand binding function of αLβ2 integrin, 2T. Kamata and Y. Takada, unpublished results. indicating that the diverse predicted loops of the β subunits are ubiquitously involved in the regulation of ligand binding functions. Mechanisms by which the disulfide-linked sequences in a predicted loop within the I domain-like structure of the β subunits define ligand specificity of integrins have yet to be studied. In preliminary studies, we did not obtain evidence that the β1–3-1 mutation induces constitutive activation of β1 integrins or induces drastic conformational changes. We determined the reactivity of the β1–3-1 mutant to an activation-dependent anti-β1 mAb 15/7, which recognizes the highly activated form of β1 integrin (30Yednock T.A. Cannon C. Vandevert C.

The binding profiles of 15/7 to the β1–3-1 mutant and wild-type β1 were identical; binding of 15/7 was dependent on activation in both cases (data not shown). The epitope for 15/7 has been localized within the residues 354–425 of β1 (in the non-ligand binding region outside the I domain-like region) (42Puzon-McLaughlin W. Yednock T. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16580-16585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Therefore, there is a possibility that the effect of the β1–3-1 mutation on conformation remains local (e.g. within the I domain-like structure of β1) and 15/7 does not detect it. The amino acid residues surrounding the tripeptide RGD of the ligands have been reported to be critical for receptor specificity of snake venom disintegrins (43Lu X. Williams J.A. Deadman J.J.

Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 289-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). One possible mechanism is that the predicted loop structures of β3 or β1 interact with the residues surrounding the tripeptide RGD of ligands, if we assume that the predicted loop structure of β is close to the ligand binding site of αvβ3 or αvβ1. Another possibility is that the predicted loops regulate the access of a group of ligands (in the case of αvβ3, Fg, Vn, and vWf) to the ligand binding site. The CTSEQNC sequence of β1 (or the CYDMKTTC sequence of β3) is located within a predicted β-turn in the putative I domain-like structure of the β subunit (6Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20438-20443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). A recent model of the β I domain-like structure (23Tuckwell D. Humphries M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), the folding diagram, appears to be consistent with our previous and present mutagenesis data (Fig.7), and this model is similar to our preliminary model (not shown). All of the residues critical for ligand binding (e.g. Asp-130 and Glu-229 of β1) (6Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20438-20443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 10Takada Y. Ylanne J. Mandelman D. Puzon W. Ginsberg M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 913-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) are located in the upper face of the model (predicted as the ligand binding site). Also, the regulatory epitope (residues 207–218 of β1) (20Takada Y. Puzon W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17597-17601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is recognized by both activating and inhibiting anti-β1 mAbs, is located in the non-ligand binding site (in the lower face) of the domain. Interestingly, a diverse sequence in the predicted loop (e.g. residues 176–199 in β1, residues 166–190 in β3), which is involved in ligand specificity of integrins in the present study, is located in the upper face of the domain in this model. The finding that the β3–1-3 mutation blocked binding of the function-blocking anti-αvβ3 antibody LM609 supports the idea that the predicted loop structure is close to the ligand binding site of αvβ3. Taken together, the present and previous mutagenesis data strongly support this model. Recently, Collins Tozer et al.(22Tozer E. Liddington R. Sutcliffe M. Smeeton A. Loftus J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21978-21984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) published an interesting atomic model of the putative I domain of β3, which is based on the crystal structure of the αM I domain (7Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). However, our mutagenesis data do not fit in very well with their model, since 1) the sequence CYDMKTTC of β3, which is critically involved in ligand binding to αvβ3, is not close to the MIDAS site (apparently in a non-ligand binding site) in their model, and 2) although Thr-197 of β3 is located in the MIDAS site of β3 in this model, the corresponding residue of β1 (Thr-206) is very close to the regulatory epitope. This epitope is probably located in a non-ligand binding site of β1 because 1) binding of some mAbs actually activates, instead of inactivating, the β1 integrins, and 2) this epitope has recently been shown to be an allosteric effector site of β1 (46Mould A. Akiyama S. Humphries M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20365-20374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), since the binding of an inhibitory anti-β1 mAb 13 to the regulatory epitope is also dramatically attenuated by ligands (Fn fragments or the GRGDS peptide). Further biochemical and structural characterization of this region of the β subunit may be required to substantiate these models. αvβ3 has been shown to be involved in the progression of melanoma and induction of neovascularization by tumor cells. αvβ3 antagonists promote tumor regression by inducing apoptosis of angiogenic blood vessels (47Brooks P. Montgomery A. Rosenfeld M. Reisfeld R. Hu T. Klier G. Cheresh D. Cell. 1994; 79: 1157-1164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2161) Google Scholar, 48Montgomery A. Reisfeld R. Cheresh D. Proc.

We identified a critical region for ligand binding and specificity of integrins using a gain of function mutant of the β subunit. The predicted loop sequence of the integrin β3 subunit is a new potential target for designing inhibitors of ligand binding functions of αvβ3. We thank Drs. D. Cheresh, M. H. Ginsberg, M. E.

Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1445-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), the masking of this site by self-association, between monomers or within dimers, has been emphasized. Up to now little, and, sometimes, contradictory information were reported on the nature of interaction existing between actin and ERMs. Radixin was characterized as a barbed-end capping protein (45Tsukita S. Hiieda Y. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 2369-2382Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Shuster and Herman (46Shuster C.B. Herman I.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 837-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) claimed that ezrin-actin interaction could not be direct. On the contrary, using a column-affinity assay, Turunenet al. (44Turunen O. Wahlström T. Vaheri A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1445-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) identified a F-actin-binding site within ezrin 35 COOH-terminal amino acids. This conclusion was enlarged to moesin (47Pestonjamasp K. Amieva M.R. Strassel C.P. Nauseef W.M. Furthmayr H. Luna E.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 247-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Finally, gastric parietal cell ezrin was found to colocalize and to preferentially interact with β/γ-actin (48Yao X.B. Chaponnier C. Gabbiani G. Forte J.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 541-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 49Yao X. Cheng L. Forte J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7224-7229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Our attempts to demonstrate a direct ezrin-actin interaction using experimental procedures similar or derived from those described above were unsuccessful. We therefore developed a new assay. Human recombinant ezrin purified from Escherichia coli was coated in wells of a microtiter plate. After incubation with actin, the specifically bound proteins were recovered and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Ezrin, and a few ezrin recombinant constructs, bound F- and G-actin and the existence of a new actin-binding site in the NH2-terminal domain of ezrin was identified. Chemicals, glutathione-agarose beads, and thrombin were from Sigma, and antiprotease tablets from Boehringer Mannheim. Anti-actin monoclonal antibody was a gift of Dr. N. Lamb (Montpellier). Anti β-actin antibody and all secondary antibodies were from Sigma. A monoclonal antibody directed against ezrin residues 576–586 was from Transduction Laboratories and was equivalent to the ZO36 antibody used in Ref. 42Gary R. Bretscher A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1061-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar. Rabbit muscle acetone powder was prepared and actin purified from as in Ref. 50Pardee J.D. Spudich J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 164-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar. Actin was isolated as CaATP-G-actin after cycling through 2–4 rounds of polymerization-depolymerization prior to gel permeation chromatography on Sephacryl S-300 in G buffer (2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm ATPNa2, 0.2 mmCaCl2, 0.005% NaN3, and 0.5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol). Occasionally, actin purified by chromatography on DEAE-Trisacryl was used and behaved similarly for ezrin-actin interaction (not shown). A single 43-kDa band was stained by Coomassie Blue when 30 μg of actin was loaded on SDS-PAGE. Actin was stored either as G- or F-actin at 4 °C. After 3 weeks of storage, F-actin was depolymerized, centrifuged for 2 h at 200,000 ×g, and chromatographed again on Sephacryl S-300. Binding studies involving G-actin were always performed with freshly gel-sized G-actin. Outdated platelets were obtained from the CRTS (Montpellier, France). β/γ-Actin was purified on polyproline-Sepharose (51Rozycki M. Schutt C.E. Lindberg U. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 100-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and eluted with 0.5 m KI (52Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Machesky L.M. Doberstein S.K. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1081-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), dialyzed, polymerized, and stored in liquid nitrogen. A single 43-kDa band was obtained after Coomassie Blue staining of 7 μg of protein analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The subcloning of the full-length human ezrin cDNA into the pGEX-2T vector (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) was described (38Andréoli C. Martin M. Leborgne R. Reggio H. Mangeat P. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2509-2521PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, A and B). Carboxyl-terminal deletions were obtained using the double stranded nested deletion kit from Pharmacia. The ezrin-pGEX-2T vector was cleaved with EcoRI and blunted with thio dNTPs. The plasmid was cleaved with EspI to eliminate the codons corresponding to ezrin 53 COOH-terminal residues (Fig. 1 D). Alternatively, internal NH2-terminal deletions were performed afterNcoI digestion, filling with thio-dNTPs, and a final digestion with BglII. This procedure eliminated the codons corresponding to residues 12–114, favoring further deletions from the 115th position (Fig. 1 C). In either case, exonuclease III was added and the reaction stopped every 30 s for 10 min. After nuclease S1 action, filling-in with the Klenow DNA polymerase fragment and overnight ligation, TG1 bacteria were transformed with DNA. Randomly picked clones were grown overnight in 3 ml of LB medium, induced for 1 h with 0.5 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, sonicated, and recombinant fusion proteins adsorbed on glutathione-agarose and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-ezrin and/or anti-GST antibodies. Clones were selected according to the level of protein expression and mobility in SDS-PAGE, and inserts were sequenced using the T7 Sequenase version 2.0 (Amersham). The full-length ezrin cDNA, and the 5′-deleted clones, used its own stop codon. The pGEX-2T vector provided the stop codon for carboxyl-terminal truncated proteins. As a consequence 2 to 7 additional amino acids were encoded by the vector and COOH-terminally added. The replacement of RRRK (293–296) by LTGN was performed by site-directed mutagenesis. 2Martin, M. (1997) Mol. Biol. Cell, in press. EzΔ13–30 was obtained after digestion by NcoI and BclI and filling-in with Klenow enzyme. The constructs expressing ez310–586 and ez280–586 were described (38Andréoli C. Martin M. Leborgne R. Reggio H. Mangeat P. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2509-2521PubMed Google Scholar). A single colony was used to seed 1 liter of LB medium. After 12–14 h growth, 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added for 1 h and bacteria pelleted at 2500 ×g for 10 min. The bacterial pellet was resuspended in 15 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and half a tablet of protease inhibitor mixture. After sonication, the lysate was diluted to 45 ml with phosphate-buffered saline and centrifuged at 40,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C. To the supernatant, 1 ml of glutathione-agarose was added and the gel suspension left on a rotary shaker for 18 h at 4 °C. The gel suspension was poured in a column, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Full-length ezrin and constructs expressing the carboxyl moiety of ezrin were eluted with 10 mm glutathione. Eluted proteins were dialyzed 18 h against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 13 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Proteins corresponding to the NH2-terminal moiety of ezrin were eluted from glutathione-agarose columns with 5 IU thrombin in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mmCaCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol. After elution, 100 μl of p-aminobenzamidine-agarose beads (Sigma) were added. Fusion proteins containing ezrin COOH-terminal parts were cleaved with thrombin as described above before use. Thrombin was trapped onp-aminobenzamidine-agarose beads and the GST moiety was removed by adsorption on glutathione-agarose beads. After dialysis and thrombin cleavage, full-length ezrin was purified on a Mono-Q FPLC column equilibrated with 25 mm MES, pH 6.2, 20 mm NaCl, and 0.01% β-mercaptoethanol. Ezrin eluted with 45 mm NaCl. All proteins were stored in the presence of 0.05% NaN3 at 4 °C. Ezrin (0.25 to 5 μg) was coated overnight in 96-well plate (Nunc) in 75 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.2 mm dithiothreitol (F buffer) in a cell culture incubator at 37 °C. Wells were rinsed twice and residual binding sites blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin in coating buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Wells were rinsed three times and F-actin (0.1–10 μg; 50 nm to 5 μm) added in 50 μl of the same buffer containing 0.5 mm ATP and 2 μm phalloidin. When G-actin was added, wells were rinsed three times with G buffer (0.2 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol) and incubation was carried out in the G buffer. After 1 h incubation at room temperature, wells were rinsed rapidly 4 times with the corresponding incubation (F or G) buffer and 30 μl of 1 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer (54Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar) were added to each well. Plates were incubated 20 min at 65 °C and the content of each well transferred in an Eppendorf test tube. Samples were heated to 100 °C for 3 min and run on a 10% SDS-PAGE. Gels were transferred using a semi-dry blotting technique on Immobilon P (Millipore). Using an overnight coating procedure, ezrin binding on plastic was found a saturable and reproducible process. Half-maximum coating was achieved with 0.5–1 μg of ezrin. The maximum amount of ezrin coated was 50–100 ng (i.e. 0.7–1.4 pmol), a value similar to what announced by the manufacturer for IgGs. Therefore, the average ezrin density was estimated in the range of 2.5–5 pmol/cm2 (1 molecule/3000–6000 Å2). Thus, ezrin molecules could be evenly spaced on plastic and coating was not formerly dependent upon a self-association process although this cannot be definitively ruled out. 50 ng of coated ezrin led to a final ezrin concentration of 15 nm during the incubation step with actin. When different constructs had to be compared, 0.01 OD 280 nm of each construct was used for coating. Although all constructs had different molar extinction coefficient, this corresponded to an amount of protein larger than the one for which saturation of coating had been demonstrated with full-length ezrin. After quantification, the number of truncated molecules coated was found very similar. For the shortest constructs, at most a 2-fold increase in the number of molecules coated was measured when compared with full-length ezrin. Therefore, for these constructs, the actin binding ability would then be overestimated if no correction was introduced. This is of no consequence since they were actually found unable to bind actin (see “Results”). Immobilon P membranes were stained with Coomassie Blue to check the efficiency of the transfer (5–10 ng of ezrin or actin could be detected). Western blotting was used to identify the bands, using either rabbit anti-ezrin or mouse anti-actin antibodies and appropriate peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies. The ECL (Amersham) detection kit was used for the revelation. In some experiments, the Vistra ECF amplification module (Amersham) was used instead in conjunction with second antibodies labeled with alkaline phosphatase and blots scanned with a STORM PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Autoradiograms (ECL) and Coomassie Blue-stained membranes were scanned using a 8-bit CCD camera and the data digitized. In all cases, the ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics) was used to quantify the data. Calibrations were performed by running on separate gels serial dilutions of known amounts of ezrin and actin. These gels were processed similarly as the samples. When series of NH2- or COOH-terminal deletions had to be compared, their molar amounts were determined. It was assumed that the epitopes recognized by a mixture of antibodies recognizing either full-length ezrin or its NH2-terminal domain were evenly localized along the ezrin molecule. Thus the detected signal was corrected for the number of amino acids of each construct. Anti-ezrin rabbit antibodies against full-length ezrin or its NH2-terminal domain (amino acids 1–310) were characterized by Andréoli et al. (38Andréoli C. Martin M. Leborgne R. Reggio H. Mangeat P. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2509-2521PubMed Google Scholar) and will be referred to as anti-C and anti-N antibodies, respectively. Antisera were used as such for Western blotting. For competition binding assays, both antisera were affinity purified on resins covalently coupled with the proteins used for immunization. A summary of the constructs used in this study is presented in Fig.1. Constructs were produced as GST fusion proteins (Fig. 1, A–D), purified, cleaved from the GST moiety, and characterized by Western blotting with anti-ezrin antibodies (Fig. 2). A new procedure to assay actin-ezrin interaction was developed by analogy with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests (see “Materials and Methods”). A 96-well plate was coated with purified full-length or truncated forms of ezrin or the respective GST fusion proteins (Fig.3). After incubation with β/γ- (left panel) or α- (middle panel) F-actin and subsequent washings, bound proteins were analyzed by Western blotting. When GST was coated as a control, no actin was ever found bound. However, a significant binding was reproducibly detected with some specific ezrin constructs. Full-length ezrin (ez1–586) bound actin. Interestingly, ez1–310 also bound actin, whereas the respective GST fusion protein never did. GST as a fusion protein with NH2-terminal forms of ezrin did lower or even prevent actin binding to chimeric ezrin molecules, and this effect was also observed when α-actin was used (not shown). Therefore, for all subsequent studies, only recombinant proteins, from which the GST moiety was cleaved, were used. α-Actin also bound full-length ezrin and other ezrin constructs (Fig.3, middle panel). Western blots with anti-ezrin and anti-actin antibodies indicated the relative levels of construct coating and actin binding in each well, respectively. In Fig. 3(right graph), the same data were normalized to allow a quantitative comparison and shown for two actin concentrations. Ez1–586 bound α-actin. Deleting the 53 COOH-terminal amino acids (ez1–533) severely impaired actin binding. This was consistent with previous results (44Turunen O. Wahlström T. Vaheri A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1445-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 47Pestonjamasp K. Amieva M.R. Strassel C.P. Nauseef W.M. Furthmayr H. Luna E.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 247-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). However, no binding of actin to ez310–586, i.e. the COOH-terminal part of ezrin containing the previously identified actin-binding site was detected under these assay conditions, whereas ez1–310did significantly bind actin. When amino acids 13–30 were deleted (ezΔ13–30), actin binding was drastically reduced. These residues were deleted because they were found important to regulate the cell extension phenotype observed in insect cells.2Overall, the presence of a binding site in the NH2 terminus domain of ezrin was therefore consistently detected whatever the actin source. In this assay, actin nonspecific binding was undetectable and binding to holo-ezrin was saturable (Fig. 4, A andB). Heating ezrin to 65 °C for 30 min before the coating step led to a large decrease in actin binding capacity (Fig.4 B), although heat denaturation drastically enhanced ezrin coating (see “Discussion”). Ezrin storage at −20 °C led to a complete loss in actin binding (not shown). The threshold concentration of α-actin required to achieve a significant binding was 50 nm (2 μg/ml). Half-saturation was reached at 20 μg/ml α-actin (0.5 μm, 1000 ng of actin added). Scatchard analysis (Fig. 4 A, inset) demonstrated that actin interacted reversibly with a homogenous population of ezrin molecules, with aK d value of 504 ± 230 nm(n = 13) and a stoichiometry of 10.6 actin monomers bound per ezrin molecule (range 6–18.4). Actin binding was analyzed with all constructs described in Figs. 1 and 2. The results were compared for two actin concentrations after quantification and normalization (Fig. 1). The data were fully consistent with those described in Figs. 3 and 4. The short deletion of amino acids 13–30 drastically reduced actin binding (Figs. 1, 3 and 4 B). Extending the deletion to residue 115, and beyond up to position 507, completely abolished actin binding. On the other hand, the truncation of ezrin COOH-terminal last 53 amino acids totally impaired actin binding while shorter constructs, ez1–310 and ez1–333, did bind actin, ez1–333 being more efficient that ez1–310 (Fig. 1). A further increase in size to position 366 led to a sudden loss in actin binding. This suggested that a small number of amino acids beyond position 333 were sufficient to negatively control the binding observed with shorter NH2-terminal ezrin fragments. COOH-terminal truncations of ez1–310 led also to a loss in actin binding as shown with ez1–280 and shorter constructs. As already noted above, ezrin COOH-terminal domains containing the previously published F-actin-binding site were incapable of binding (ez310–586and ez280–586). Finally, the mutation of amino acids 293–296 from RRRK to LTGN in ez1–310 led to a significant drop in actin binding which was consistent with the demonstration that the same mutations in ez1–310 impaired actin-based cell extension in Sf9-infected cells.2 The data suggested that ezrin might contain two distinct actin-binding sites with distinct properties. For instance, ez1–586 and ez1–333bound F-actin with different stoichiometry (Fig. 4 B). TheK d of ez1–586 for G-actin (710 nm, n = 4) was similar to the value determined for F-actin (see above and Fig. 4 E). However, the binding capacity was markedly different since the ratio of actin monomer bound per ez1–586 was 0.9 (range 0.75–0.94). With ez1–333, large variations were observed (see “Discussion”). Ez1–333 bound 0.27–1.0 G- and 0.7–6.0 F-actin molecules (in paired experiments, the F-actin binding capacity was 3–5 times that of G-actin). The K d values for F- and G-actin binding to ez1–333 were similar, respectively, 205 (n = 5) and 280 (n = 3) nm. The comparison between ez1–586, ez1–333, and ez1–310 to bind either F- or G-actin showed indeed selective differences (Fig.5 A). Ez1–310bound equally F- and G-actin, while ez1–586 and ez1–333 were more efficient in binding F-actin. To better distinguish these different sites, the actions of various effectors were tested. NaCl addition did not alter F-actin binding to ez1–586 or ez1–333 (Fig. 5 B). Using 40 μg/ml G-actin, increasing NaCl concentration resulted in enhanced actin binding, consistent with actin polymerization triggered by salt addition (Fig. 5 B, right) and recovery of pelletable actin from the wells.

https://openalex.org/W2088673986,"Rtg3p and Rtg1p are basic helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper protein transcription factors in yeast that interact and bind to sites in an upstream activation sequence element in the 5′-flanking region of CIT2, a gene encoding a peroxisomal isoform of citrate synthase. These factors are required both for basal expression of CIT2 and its elevated expression in cells with dysfunctional mitochondria, such as in respiratory-deficient petite cells lacking mitochondrial DNA (ρ°). This elevated expression of CIT2 is called the retrograde response. Here we show that fusion constructs between the Gal4p DNA binding domain and Rtg3p transactivate the expression of aLacZ reporter gene under the control of a GAL1promoter element. We have identified two activation domains in Rtg3p: a strong carboxyl-terminal domain from amino acids 375–486, and a weaker amino-terminal domain from amino acids 1–175; neither of these activation domains contain the bHLH/Zip motif. We have also identified a serine/threonine-rich domain of Rtg3p within amino acids 176–282 that is inhibitory to transactivation. In addition, the transcriptional activity of the Gal4-Rtg3p fusion proteins does not require either Rtg1p or Rtg2p; the latter is a protein containing an hsp70-like ATP binding domain that is also necessary for CIT2 expression. In contrast, transcriptional activation by Gal4-Rtg1p fusion proteins requires the Rtg1p basic helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper protein domain, as well as Rtg3p and Rtg2p. These data suggest that transcriptional activation by the Rtg1p-Rtg3p complex is largely the function of Rtg3p. Experiments are also presented suggesting that Rtg3p is limiting for gene expression in respiratory-competent (ρ+) cells.

We have termed this pathway retrograde regulation, and have suggested that it operates as a homeostatic mechanism for accommodating various cellular activities to alterations in mitochondrial function (6Shyjan A.W. Butow R.A. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 398-400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). One example of retrograde regulation in the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae is the elevated expression of theCIT2 gene in cells with dysfunctional mitochondria (7Liao X. Small W.C. Srere P.A. Butow R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 38-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar).CIT2 encodes a peroxisomal isoform of citrate synthase (8Rosenkrantz M. Alam T. Kim K.-S. Clark B.J. Srere P.A.

The glyoxylate cycle enables cells to carry out a net conversion of acetate, available either as a sole carbon source or produced via β-oxidation, to carbohydrate by the shuttling of glyoxylate cycle intermediates (e.g. succinate) from the peroxisomes to mitochondria (10Tolbert N.E.

We have found that CIT2 transcription is activated as much as 30-fold in cells that have blocks in the TCA cycle or are respiratory-deficient, for example, because of a complete loss of mitochondrial DNA (ρo petites) (7Liao X.

Surprisingly, these genes are also required for oleic acid-induced peroxisomal proliferation and the induction of enzymes of the β-oxidation pathway (12Chelstowska A. Butow R.A. J. Biol.

Experiments to be presented elsewhere show that Rtg2p has properties of a heat shock protein that may function as a molecular chaperone in the control of gene expression. 2L. Gopalakrishnan, unpublished results. 2L. Gopalakrishnan, unpublished results. RTG1and RTG3 encode basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper (bHLH/Zip) transcription factors (11Liao X. Butow R.A.

Biol. 1997; 17: 1110-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Rtg1p has some unusual features for a bHLH protein; in addition to an unusually long loop domain of some 39 amino acid residues, it has a very short basic DNA binding domain that lacks certain conserved amino acids found in the basic region of most other bHLH proteins. Those residues are known to make specific base contacts in the major groove of target site DNA (19Ferré-D'Amaré A.R. Prendergast G.C. Ziff E.B. Burley S.K. Nature. 1993; 363: 38-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 20Ellenberger T. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 12-21Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 21Ellenberger T. Fass D. Arnaud M. Harrison S.C. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 970-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Rtg3p, on the other hand, has the features of a typical bHLH/Zip protein, including the conserved amino acids in the basic region of the bHLH motif. Recently, we showed that Rtg1p and Rtg3p bind, most likely as a heterodimer, to sequences in a 76-bp UASr element in the CIT2 promoter (13Jia Y. Rothermel B. Thornton J. Butow R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1110-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The minimal DNA target site for binding of the Rtg1p-Rtg3p complex is not, however, an E box (22Murré C. McCaw P.S. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 56: 777-783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1829) Google Scholar, 23Blackwell T.K. Kretzner L. Blackwood E.M. Eisenman R. Weintraub H. Science. 1990; 250: 1149-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar), CANNTG, which is the core binding site for the great majority of bHLH transcription factors, but a novel sequence, GGTCAC, which we have called an R box (13Jia Y. Rothermel B. Thornton J. Butow R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1110-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The CIT2UASr element contains two such R boxes arranged as an inverted repeat separated by 28 bp of an AT-rich region. Both R box sites are required for full CIT2 expression and act synergistically in vivo (13Jia Y. Rothermel B. Thornton J. Butow R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1110-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In previous experiments, Rtg1p was tested for its ability to activate transcription by fusing to it the DNA binding domain of Gal4p (24Rothermel B.A. Shyjan A.W. Etheredge J.L. Butow R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 49: 29476-29482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In wild-type cells, the Gal4-Rtg1p chimera was able to activate transcription of an integrated LacZ reporter gene under the control of a GAL1 promoter element (UASG). Moreover, the activity showed a typical retrograde response,i.e. expression was greater in ρ° petites than in ρ+ cells. Transcriptional activation by Gal4-Rtg1p was absolutely dependent upon the presence of Rtg2p and at least one other protein, which we suggested was a bHLH protein that interacted with Rtg1p. That protein was subsequently identified as Rtg3p (13Jia Y. Rothermel B. Thornton J. Butow R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1110-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). To characterize further the role of Rtg1p and Rtg3p in the control ofCIT2 expression, we have made a variety of Gal4p fusions to Rtg3p. Here we show that Rtg3p contains at least two transcriptional activation domains that can function independently of Rtg1p and Rtg2p. We have also identified an apparent inhibitory domain of Rtg3p transactivation rich in serine and threonine residues that could be potential phosphorylation sites of the protein. We suggest that Rtg3p may be limiting for CIT2 expression in respiratory-competent (ρ+) cells and that Rtg2p could function to recruit Rtg3p for interaction with Rtg1p. The S. cerevisiae strains used in this study are derivatives of either COP161 U7 (MATa ade1 lys1 ura3) (11Liao X. Butow R.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 61-71Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) or SFY526 (MATa ade2 lys1 leu2 his3 trp1 Δgal4 Δgal80 Gal1-lacZ::URA3). SFY526Δrtg1 was described previously (24Rothermel B.A. Shyjan A.W. Etheredge J.L. Butow R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 49: 29476-29482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (44) Google Scholar). SFY256Δrtg2 and SFY526Δrtg3are derivatives of SFY526, in which the reading frame encoding amino acids 23–573 of Rtg2p and the reading frame encoding amino acids 175–340 of Rtg3p were replaced, respectively, with the HIS3gene. All strains exist both as a respiratory-competent ρ+ cells and respiratory-incompetent ρ° derivatives lacking mtDNA. The ρ° strains were obtained by growth on rich dextrose medium containing 20 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Each ρ° derivative was stained with 4′,6′-diamino-2-phenylindole to ensure that no mitochondrial DNA was present. Cells were grown on rich YP medium (1% yeast extract, 2% Bacto-peptone) containing 2% glucose (YPD), 2% raffinose (YPR), or 3% glycerol (YPG) at 30 °C. Plasmids were selected for by growth on minimal YNB medium (0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids) and 2% dextrose (YNDB), 2% raffinose (YNBR), or 3% glycerol (YNBG) supplemented with 1% casamino acids or individual amino acids as required. Standard molecular biology techniques were used for the construction, amplification, and manipulation of plasmids (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The vector pGBT9 (2μ, TRP3, GenBank accession no. U07646) was used to construct fusions to the Ga14p DNA binding domain. The vector pGAD424 (2μ, LEU2, GenBank accession no. U07647) was used to construct fusions to the Ga14p activation domain. The RTG1 fusion plasmid p2H26–177 was described previously (24Rothermel B.A. Shyjan A.W. Etheredge J.L. Butow R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 49: 29476-29482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (44) Google Scholar). pGAD-RTG1 encodes the Gal4p activation domain fused to amino acids 26–177 of Rtg1p. PCR primers, containing a 5′ EcoRI and 3′ PstI site, were used to construct the series of GAL4-RTG3 fusion plasmids displayed in Fig. 1and pGAD-RTG3 (encoding the full-length Rtg3p fused to the Ga14p activation domain). pGBT-RTG2 encodes the Gal4p DNA binding domain fused to full-length Rtg2p. The sequence of all PCR generated constructs was verified using the Sequenase kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). A 1.5-kb KpnI-BamHI genomic RTG1fragment was cloned into pRS416 (CEN, URA3) and the multicopy vector yplac195 (2μ, URA3) to give pRTG1–416 and p195-RTG1. A 3.1-kb genomic XbaI-BamHIRTG3 fragment was cloned into pRS416, yplac195, and yplac181 (2μ, LEU2) to give pRTG3–416, p195-RTG3, and p181-RTG3. Yeast were transformed using lithium acetate and heat shock (26Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1763) Google Scholar). Transformants carrying the desired plasmid or plasmid pairs were selected for on YNBD supplemented with the necessary amino acids. Liquid precultures were inoculated with a pool of 15–20 independent transformants and grown in selective YNBG (ρ+) or YNBR (ρ°). Selective YNBR cultures were inoculated at a low density (0.01 A 600), grown at 30 °C and harvested at mid-log phase (∼0.9 A 600). Cell extracts and assays were carried out as described by Rose and Botstein (27Rose M. Botstein D. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 167-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). For each plasmid-strain combination, these extracts was assayed in triplicate. COP161 U7 ρ+ and ρ° strains were transformed with an empty control plasmid, or plasmid carrying RTG1 or RTG3 (either 2μ orCEN). Selective YNBG (ρ+) or YNBR (ρ°) precultures were used to inoculate selective YNBR cultures at a low density (0.01 A 600). Cells were harvested at mid-log phase and total RNA was isolated (28Schmitt M.E. Brown T.A. Trumpower B.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3091-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). RNA was fractionated on an agarose gel and probed for actin and CIT2 mRNA abundance as described previously (7Liao X. Small W.C. Srere P.A. Butow R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 38-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Signals were quantified using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. In previous experiments, we showed that a chimeric protein consisting of the DNA binding domain of Gal4p fused to Rtg1p was able to activate expression of an integrated LacZ reporter gene under the control of a Gal4p-responsive UASG element (24Rothermel B.A. Shyjan A.W. Etheredge J.L. Butow R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 49: 29476-29482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, those studies revealed that Rtg1p by itself could not transactivate, but appeared to require, in addition to Rtg2p, one or more proteins for transcriptional activity. That conclusion was strengthened by the identification of a new bHLH/Zip protein encoded by the RTG3 gene, which is also essential for CIT2expression, and the finding that Rtg3p binds with Rtg1p at two sites in the CIT2 UASr (13Jia Y. Rothermel B. Thornton J. Butow R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1110-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). To determine whether Rtg3p is also required for transactivation mediated by the Gal4-Rtg1p chimeric protein, where Rtg1p is directed to the USAGelement in the reporter gene solely by the Gal4p DNA binding domain,SFY526Δrtg3 cells were transformed with p2H26–177 encoding the Gal4p DNA binding domain fused directly to the HLH domain of Rtg1p (Fig. 1 A). The β-galactosidase activity of this transformant was then compared with p2H26–177 transformants of wild-type SFY526 cells and itsΔrtg1 and Δrtg2 derivatives. Fig. 2 shows that there is a retrograde response in the transactivation by p2H26–17 in SFY526 transformants,i.e. activity was greater in respiratory-deficient ρ° petites than in ρ+ cells of that strain. In addition, activity both in ρ+ and in ρ° cells was comparably greater in SFY256Δrtg1 cells, presumably because endogenous Rtg1p was not present to compete for limited interacting proteins required for transactivation of the Gal4-Rtg1p fusion protein. In contrast to these results, no transcriptional activation was observed in either SFY526Δrtg2 or SFY256Δrtg3transformants. Altogether, regulation of expression of the UASG-LacZ reporter gene by Gal4-Rtg1p resembles transcriptional control of the CIT2 gene, whereby expression is elevated in ρ° cells, and is dependent on RTG1 andRTG3 in both ρ+ and ρ° cells (11Liao X. Butow R.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 61-71Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 13Jia Y. Rothermel B. Thornton J. Butow R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1110-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). These results are consistent with the notion that transactivation occurs via an Rtg1p-Rtg3p heterodimeric complex, and that Rtg3p contains one or more transactivation domains. Although Rtg2p is required for Gal4-Rtg1p-mediated transactivation of the UASG-LacZ reporter gene, it is unlikely to be involved directly in transcriptional activation. First, we have fused full-length Rtg2p to the Gal4p DNA binding domain and found that this construct (pGBT-RTG2) by itself did not transactive UASG-LacZ reporter gene expression in wild-type cells (Table I, part A). Second, in a standard two-hybrid experiment testing protein-protein interactions (29Bartel P.L. Chien C.-T. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Hartley D.A. Cellular Interactions in Development: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 153-179Google Scholar), when pGBT-RTG2, encoding the Gal4p DNA binding domain fused to Rtg2p, was co-transformed with either pGAD-RTG1 or pGAD-RTG3 encoding, respectively, Rtg1p or Rtg3p fused to the Gal4p activation domain, no increase in reporter gene expression was detected. This result indicates that there is no direct interaction between Rtg2p and either Rtg1p or Rtg3p.Figure 2Activation of LacZ reporter gene expression by a Gal4-Rtg1p fusion protein requires Rtg2p and Rtg3p. Wild-type SFY526 ρ+ and ρ° cells and their Δrtg1, Δrtg2, and Δrtg3derivatives were transformed with the p2H26–177 Gal4-Rtg1p fusion plasmid. Cultures were inoculated with a pool of 15–20 transformants and grown to mid-log phase on selective YNBR medium. β-Galactosidase assays were done in triplicate as described by Rothermel et al.

Open table in a new tab b WT, wild-type strain. The results of the previous experiments suggest that, for transactivation of the UASG-LacZ reporter gene, either there is a necessary interaction between Rtg1p and Rtg3p, or Rtg3p by itself is sufficient for transcriptional activation. To distinguish between these possibilities, we constructed a series of chimeric proteins consisting of the Gal4p DNA binding domain fused to various domains of Rtg3p, including the full-length protein (Fig. 1 B). These constructs were then tested for their ability to transactivate expression of the UASG -LacZ reporter gene in wild-type and mutant SFY526 cells. Fig. 3shows that the full-length Gal4-Rtg3p chimera, p3GB1–486 (Fig.1 B), could transactivate in wild-type cells. Unlike Gal4-Rtg1p, however, transactivation did not show a typical retrograde response of higher activity in ρ° cells. Moreover, Gal4-Rtg3p could transactivate in all three Δrtg mutant backgrounds as well as, or better than, in wild-type cells. Except for expression inΔrtg1 cells, activity was lower in the ρ° petite than in ρ+ cells. These results are in sharp contrast to Gal4-Rtg1p transactivation, which requires both Rtg2p and Rtg3p and which consistently shows a greater activity in ρ° cells. From these experiments, we conclude that Rtg3p itself contains one or more domains responsible for transcriptional activation, but these are not by themselves responsive to retrograde control. To define the activation domain(s) of Rtg3p, we constructed a series of Gal4-Rtg3p fusions linking different portions of the protein to the DNA binding domain of Gal4p (Fig. 1 B). These constructs were then tested for activity in ρ+ and ρ° derivatives of strain SFY526. The results of these experiments (Fig. 4) show, first, that there are at least two independent activation domains in Rtg3p, a strong COOH-terminal domain (amino acids 375–486) and a weaker NH2-terminal domain (amino acids 1–175). Second, neither of these domains contain the HLH/Zip protein dimerization motif, indicating that transactivation does not require an HLH/Zip-mediated protein-protein interaction. Although there was somewhat greater activity in construct pGB300–486 containing the HLH/Zip domain, these results, nevertheless, contrast sharply with those obtained with the Gal4-Rtg1p fusions, where the HLH/Zip domain was found to be essential for activity in UASG-LacZ reporter gene expression (24Rothermel B.A. Shyjan A.W. Etheredge J.L. Butow R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 49: 29476-29482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A third significant outcome of these experiments is that the region of Rtg3p from amino acids 176 to 282 was not only inactive in supporting reporter gene expression but also appeared to be inhibitory to the activity of the NH2- and COOH-terminal activation domains. For example, construct p3GB1–282 was less active than construct p3GB1–175, and construct p3GB176–286 was considerably less active than p3GB300–486 or p3GB375–486 (Figs. 1 B and 4). It is noteworthy that the inactive, and apparently inhibitory, domain of Rtg3p from amino acids 176–282 is very rich in serine and threonine residues, and thus may be potentially important as phosphorylation sites in the protein. Finally, as is the case with the full-length fusion construct, all of the active, truncated Gal4-Rtg3p fusions were also active in Δrtg1, Δrtg2, andΔrtg3 cells (data not shown). From these data, we conclude that Rtg3p contains NH2- and COOH-terminal transactivation domains, which, when directed to the Gal4p DNA binding site, do not require the bHLH/Zip dimerization domain or the products of the two other known RTG genes for activity. The findings presented thus far suggest that Rtg3p is the functional transactivator of the Rtg1p-Rtg3p complex. Hence, reporter gene expression mediated by Gal4-Rtg1p would require recruitment of Rtg3p and interaction of these proteins via their bHLH/Zip motifs. Gal4-Rtg3p, however, which contains independent transactivation domains, would not require Rtg1p for transactivation of reporter gene expression from a UASG element. What then is the function of Rtg2p in transactivation? Rtg2p has no known DNA binding motifs, but it does contain an hsp70-like ATP binding domain (18Koonin E.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 156-157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and has some properties of a heat shock protein and molecular chaperone,2 such as a peptide-stimulated ATPase activity (30Craig E.A. Weissman J.S. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 365-372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Thus, Rtg2p might function to promote a direct interaction between Rtg1p and Rtg3p. To examine whether Rtg1p and Rtg3p can interact in the absence of Rtg2p when both proteins are targeted to the nucleus via plasmid-encoded heterologous nuclear localization signals, we used the construct, p2H26–177, which fuses the Gal4p DNA binding domain to Rtg1p, in a two-hybrid assay together with a second plasmid, pGAD-RTG3, encoding full-length Rtg3p linked to the Gal4p activation domain. The two constructs, p2H26–177 and pGAD-RTG3, were examined singly (along with the control plasmids) and in combination for their ability to transactivate the UASG-LacZ reporter gene in ρ+ and ρ° derivatives of wild-type,Δrtg3, and Δrtg2 SFY526 cells. Table I, part B, shows that, as observed previously (24Rothermel B.A. Shyjan A.W. Etheredge J.L. Butow R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 49: 29476-29482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (44) Google Scholar), the construct encoding the Gal4p DNA binding domain fused to Rtg1p (p2H26–177) was able to transactivate the reporter gene in wild-type SFY526 cells in a retrograde-responsive manner. By contrast, no transactivation was observed in cells transformed with pGAD-RTG3, which encodes the Gal4p activation domain fused to Rtg3p. However, in wild-type cells transformed with both p2H26–177 and pGAD-RTG3, a high level of transactivation was observed that was 2–3.6-fold greater than with p2H26–177 alone. In Δrtg3cells, neither p2H26–177 or pGAD-RTG3 alone showed any activity, but activity was observed in cells transformed with both plasmids, indicating an interaction between Rtg1p and Rtg3p. InΔrtg2 cells, some transactivation by p2H-177 was observed but the activity was only a fraction (10% or less) of that seen in wild-type cells. Importantly, strong transactivation was observed inΔrtg2 cells containing both p2H26–177 and pGAD-RTG3, indicating that Rtg2p is not required for the direct interaction between Rtg1p and Rtg3p. These findings are consistent with previous observations"
https://openalex.org/W2084317972,"The two known mannose 6-phosphate receptors (MPR46 and MPR300) both mediate the transport of Man-6-P-containing lysosomal proteins to lysosomes. However, the MPRs cannot be detected in lysosomes, instead they recycle between the plasma membrane and endosomes and between endosomes and the trans-Golgi network. Both, endocytosis from the plasma membrane and budding of transport vesicles from the trans-Golgi network involves the interaction of the receptor with the clathrin-coated vesicles-associated protein complexes AP1 and AP2. We have analyzed this interaction between the Golgi-restricted AP1 complex and the plasma membrane-restricted AP2 complex with the MPR46 tail in vitro by using a biosensor. AP1 and AP2 both bind to and dissociate from the MPR46 tail with similar kinetics. Using synthetic peptides corresponding to different MPR receptor tail regions in inhibition and binding studies, a common high affinity binding site for AP1 and AP2 and two separate high affinity binding sites for AP1 and AP2, respectively, were identified."
https://openalex.org/W2073320395,"In vertebrate skeletal muscles, the type 1 isoform of ryanodine receptor (RyR1) is essential in triggering contraction by releasing Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in response to plasma membrane depolarisation. Recently, the presence of another RyR isoform, RyR3, has been detected in mammalian skeletal muscle cells, raising the question of the eventual relevance of RyR3 for muscle cell physiology. The expression of RyR3 was investigated during differentiation of skeletal muscle cells. Using antibodies able to distinguish the different RyR isoforms and Western blot analysis, the RyR3 protein was detected in the microsomal fractions of differentiated skeletal muscle cells but not of undifferentiated cells. Accordingly, blocking muscle differentiation by the addition of either transforming growth factor-beta or basic fibroblast growth factor prevented the expression of the RyR3 protein. In differentiated skeletal muscle cells, RyR3 was expressed independent of cell fusion and myotube formation. The expression of RyR3 was also investigated during development of the diaphragm muscle. The RyR3 content in the diaphragm muscle increased between the late stage of fetal development and the first postnatal days. However, at variance with RyR1, which reached maximum levels of expression 2-3 weeks after birth, the expression of RyR3 was found to be higher in the neonatal phase of the diaphragm muscle development (2-15 days after birth) than in the same muscle from adult mice. The differential content of RyR3 in adult skeletal muscles was found not to be mediated by neurotrophic factors or electrical activity. These findings indicate that RyR3 is preferentially expressed in differentiated skeletal muscle cells. In addition, during skeletal muscle development, its expression is regulated differently from that of RyR1."

Human tryptase is unique inasmuch as no endogenous inhibitors have yet been detected for this enzyme, although rat tryptase has been shown to be inhibited by trypstatin (2Kido H. Yokogoshi Y.

Chem. 1994; 269: 3818-3822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Regulation of human tryptase activity is thought to be mediated by dissociation of the tetramer, a process that may be accelerated by competition for heparin between the protease and other heparin-binding proteins. Human mast cell tryptase has been isolated from lung (4Smith T.J. Hougland M.W. Johnson D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11046-11051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Schwartz L.B.

Recent data suggest that different isoforms may exhibit differences in their specificities (12Little S.S. Johnson D.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The physiological roles of tryptase are as yet unclear, althoughin vitro studies have implicated its function in neuropeptide turnover, coagulation, and the catabolism of extracellular matrix proteins (reviewed in Ref. 1Schwartz L.B. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 88-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The central role of mast cells in allergic and inflammatory reactions suggests that tryptase may be involved in the pathogenesis of disorders such as asthma, interstitial lung diseases, psoriasis, arthritis, gingivitis, and peridontitis. Only a few synthetic inhibitors of tryptase have been reported so far (13Caughey G.H. Raymond W.W. Bacci E. Lombardy R.J. Tidwell R.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1993; 264: 676-682PubMed Google Scholar, 14Stürzebecher J. Prasa D. Sommerhoff C.P. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1992; 373: 1025-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 15Stürzebecher J.

Knowledge of the tryptase structure would be of great benefit for the design of pharmacologically active lead compounds in the development of drugs for the treatment of these diseases. Attempts have been made to model the structure of human mast cell tryptase (16Johnson D.A. Barton G.J. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 370-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and the corresponding mouse enzyme (17Matsumoto R. Sali A. Ghildyal N. Karplus M. Stevens R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19524-19531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) by homology to other serine proteinases. These studies indicate the location of putative heparin binding sites and suggest that the limited activity of human tryptase may be due to a restricted active site cleft. Attempts to crystallize tryptase have been unsuccessful to date, presumably due to the requirement of (generally heterogeneous) glycosaminoglycans for stability. We have recently identified and characterized leech-derived tryptase inhibitor (LDTI), 1The abbreviations used are: LDTI, leech-derived tryptase inhibitor; rLDTI, recombinant leech-derived tryptase inhibitor; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; TPDCA, (1, 1′,3′,1"")-terphenyl-3,3""-dicarbamidinium; DX9065a, (+)-2-[4-[((3S)-1-acetimidoyl-3-pyrrodinyl)oxy]phenyl]-3-(7-amidino-2-naphthyl) propionic acid; BABCH, 2,7-bis-(4-amidinobenzylidene)-cycloheptan-1-one; BABIM, bis-(5-amidino-2-benzimidazolyl)methane; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. a protein-type inhibitor of human mast cell tryptase from the medicinal leech Hirudo medicinalis, (18Sommerhoff C.P.

The asterisk denotes the position of the P1 residue; secondary structure is denoted by a (α-helix) and b (β-sheet). Residues mutated in this work are in boldface type. In this paper, we describe the crystal structure of rLDTI in complex with porcine trypsin, solved to a resolution of 1.9 Å. The compact molecule binds to the active site of trypsin in a canonical (i.e. substrate-like) manner. Its distinctive disulfide pattern results in a disk-shaped molecule that suggests a restricted active site cleft of tryptase. The deletion of one turn of α-helix allows the amino-terminal residues to follow a path along the surface of the proteinase novel for Kazal-type inhibitors. Based on the structure, we have used site-directed mutagenesis to establish a specific role of the amino-terminal basic residues of LDTI in its interaction with human lung tryptase. The implications of these results for the structure and inhibition of tryptase are discussed. The chemicals used were of the highest quality available commercially from the following sources: Sigma, Merck (Darmstadt, Germany), Serva (Heidelberg, Germany), Biomol (Hamburg, Germany), Roth (Karlsruhe, Germany), Braun (Melsungen, Germany), Dianova (Hamburg, Germany), and Promega (Madison, WI).

An excess of rLDTI was added to porcine trypsin (Sigma) in 20 mm MOPS, 20 mm NaCl, pH7, and the resulting complex was concentrated to 10 mg/ml. Ellipsoidal crystals of the complex were obtained using vapor diffusion with 10% polyethylene glycol 6000, 2.3 mphosphate, pH 8. The crystals belong to the tetragonal space group P43212 with cell constants a =b = 63.4 Å, c = 131.2 Å, α = β = γ = 90° and contain one complex in the asymmetric unit. Data to 1.9-Å resolution were collected on an image plate (MAR Research, Hamburg) and evaluated using Mosflm (27Leslie, A. G. W.

The final model has a crystallographic R-factor of 0.197 for all reflections to 1.9 Å, and consists of 1996 active atoms, with root mean square deviations of 0.008 Å in bond lengths and 1.805° in bond angles and an average temperature factor of 21 Å2.

The deletion variants rLDTI-var1 and rLDTI-var2 and the substitution variant rLDTI-var3 were constructed by cassette mutagenesis using the cloning vector pRM 5.1.5 (19Auerswald E.A. Morenweiser R.

Briefly, after cleavage of vector DNA with XbaI/BglII, the small fragment coding for the fusion linker and the N terminus of rLDTI was substituted by appropriate hybridized oligonucleotides (cassettes). The oligonucleotide sequences for the XbaI/BglII fragments were 5′-CTA GAT AAA AGA AAG GTT TGC GCA TGC CCA AA and complementary 3′-TA TTT TCT TTC CAA ACG CGT ACG GGT TTC TAG for rLDTI-var1 (ΔK1); 5′-CTA GAT AAA AGA GTT TGC GCA TGC CCA AA and complementary 3′-TA TTT TCT CAA ACG CGT ACG GGT TTC TAG for rLDTI-var2 (ΔK1, ΔK2); and 5′-CTA GAT AAA AGA CAA CAA GTT TGC GCA TGC CCA AA and complementary 3′-TA TTT TCT GTT GTT CAA ACG CGT ACG GGT TTC TAG for rLDTI-var3 (K1Q, K2Q). The resulting cloning vectors (pRM 16.1.4, pRM 17.1.2, and pRM 18.1.2, respectively) were amplified in E. coli TG1. For expression in S. cerevisiae, the mutated rLDTI genes were isolated by XbaI/HindIII cleavage and ligated into yeast shuttle vector pVT102U/α. The resulting expression vectors pRM 20.2.1, pRM 21.2.1, and pRM 22.2.1 were used to transformS. cerevisiae S-78 (35Becker D.M. Guarente L. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Standard yeast expression experiments were performed as described in Ref. 19Auerswald E.A. Morenweiser R.

SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of proteins was performed with 15–25% polyacrylamide gels (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). The gels were self-prepared and run in either a conventional apparatus or the PhastSystem®(Pharmacia). Isoelectric focussing was performed with the PhastSystem® using the calibration kit, pH 3.5–9.3, from Pharmacia. Selected fractions from the cation exchange chromatography, usually 2–3 nmol of protein, were analyzed by reversed phase HPLC as detailed previously (18Sommerhoff C.P. Söllner C. Mentele R. Piechottka G.P. Auerswald E.A. Fritz H. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1994; 375: 685-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Partial N-terminal sequence analysis was performed with the gas phase sequencer 473A (Applied Biosystems GmbH, Weiterstadt, Germany) following the instructions of the manufacturer. The protein concentration was determined using the Pierce BCA* protein assay with bovine serum albumin as standard protein (38Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H.

Reverse phase HPLC-purified protein fractions were infused into an atmospheric pressure ionization source fitted to a tandem quadrupole instrument, API III (Sciex, Thornhill, Ontario, Canada). The sample solutions were delivered to the sprayer by a syringe infusion pump (model 22, Harvard Apparatus, Inc., South Natick, MA). The liquid flow rate was set at 5 ml/min for sample introduction. The instrument m/z scale was calibrated with the ammonium adduct ions of polypropylene gycol. The average molecular mass values of the protein were calculated from them/z peaks in the charge distribution profiles of the multiple charged ions (40Covey X. Bronner T.R. Shushan R.F. Henion H. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1988; 2: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, 41Mann Y. Meng M. Fenn C.K. Anal. Chem. 1989; 61: 1702-1708Crossref Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Theoretical masses for the variants were calculated assuming three disulfide bridges with the GCG DNA/protein analysis software (42Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11536) Google Scholar). The concentrations of the biologically active LDTI variants were determined by titration with trypsin, assuming an equimolar interaction between each inhibitor and the enzyme. Bovine pancreatic trypsin was standardized by active site titration using p-nitrophenylp′-guanidinobenzoate (43Chase T. Shaw E. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 19: 20-27Crossref Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Equilibrium dissociation constants (K i ) were determined essentially as suggested by Bieth (44Bieth J.G. Bayer Symposium “Proteinase Inhibitors”. Springer-Verlag Berlin, Berlin1974: 463-469Google Scholar). Briefly, a constant concentration of bovine pancreatic trypsin, chymotrypsin, or tryptase isolated from human lung tissue (in the presence of 50 μg/ml heparin to stabilize the protease) was incubated with increasing concentrations of each inhibitor; the time necessary to reach equilibration of the enzyme-inhibitor complex was determined in preliminary experiments. Subsequently, the residual enzyme activities were measured by following the hydrolysis of suitable substrates. Apparent K i values (K i (app)) were calculated by fitting the steady state velocities to the equation for tight binding inhibitors (45Morrison J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 185: 269-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar) using nonlinear regression analysis as follows,Vi/V0=1−(Et+It+Ki(app)−((Et+It+Ki(app)) 2−4EtIt) 1/2)/2EtEquation 1 where V i and V 0are the velocities in the presence and absence of an inhibitor, andE t and I t the total concentrations of enzyme and inhibitor, respectively. Since the LDTI variants bind to only two of the four catalytic subunits of the tryptase tetramer in the range of concentrations used, Equation 1 was modified by subtracting V r (i.e. the remaining velocity at high concentrations of inhibitor) fromV i and V 0 (18Sommerhoff C.P. Söllner C. Mentele R. Piechottka G.P. Auerswald E.A. Fritz H. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1994; 375: 685-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Equilibrium dissociation constants (K i ) for the complexes of the LDTI variants with chymotrypsin were obtained from theK i app values after correction for competition between the inhibitors and the substrate; even at high substrate concentrations competition was not detectable during the measurements of residual enzyme activities of tryptase and trypsin. K i values for the inhibition of tryptase and factor Xa by the low molecular weight inhibitors TPDCA and DX9065a (Fig. 4) were calculated according to Dixon (46Dixon M. Biochem. J. 1953; 55: 170-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (3290) Google Scholar) from data measured at pH 7.6 and 25 °C using the chromogenic substrate Tos-Gly-Pro-Arg-pNA. Apart from a few surface-located side chains, the trypsin moiety is almost completely defined by electron density. With the exception of the side chain of Tyr217, which swings out to accommodate the amino-terminal residues of LDTI (Fig.1; see below), no significant conformational changes are seen in the trypsin component compared with other porcine trypsin structures (29Lin G. Bode W. Huber R. Chi C. Engh R.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 549-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 47Huang Q. Wang Z. Li Y. Liu S. Tang Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1209: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 48Huang Q. Liu S. Tang Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 1022-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 49Burgering M.J.M. Orbons L.P.M. van der Doelen Mulders A.J. Theunissen H.J.M. Grootenhuis P.D.J. Bode W. Huber R. Stubbs M.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 395-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The LDTI moiety is well defined in the vicinity of the proteinase, but it is characterized by elevated temperature factors and disrupted density further away from trypsin. In particular, amino acid residues Lys1-Lys2, Gly15–Arg19, Ser33–Ser36, and the C-terminal residues Pro41–Asn46 are defined by either weak or no electron density. In contrast, the NMR solution structure (23Mühlhahn P. Czisch M. Morenweiser R. Habermann B. Engh R.A. Sommerhoff C.P. Auerswald E.A. Holak T.A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 355: 290-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) is well defined for residues Cys4–Cys40, while the terminal peptides Lys1–Val3 and Pro41–Asn46 are mobile. LDTI secondary structure consists of a short central α-helix (Ser24–Asn30) and a small antiparallel β-sheet (residues Val13–Gly15, Thr20-Tyr21, and Ile34–Glu37) characteristic for the classical Kazal-type inhibitors (Fig. 2). Due to a large deletion, however, the helix is one turn shorter than that in Japanese quail ovomucoid third domain (22Weber E. Papamokos E. Bode W. Huber R. Kato I. Laskowski Jr., M. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 149: 109-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) or either domain of rhodniin (24van de Locht A. Lamba D. Bauer M. Huber R. Friedrich T. Kröger B. Höffken H.W. Bode W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5149-5157Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). The third β-strand is in part poorly defined, suggesting a degree of flexibility in the crystal. Residues P3–P3′ (Cys6–Lys11) exhibit the highly conserved “canonical” or substrate-like conformation of the small serine proteinase inhibitors (50Bode W. Huber R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 433-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). As a result of its “nonclassical” disulfide pattern, the active site wedge of LDTI is rather narrow, as was also observed for rhodniin (24van de Locht A. Lamba D. Bauer M. Huber R. Friedrich T. Kröger B. Höffken H.W. Bode W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5149-5157Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In contrast to either of the two domains of rhodniin, however, the first disulfide bridge (Cys4–Cys29) possesses a right handed spiral conformation that causes the amino terminus to exit the active site cleft to the “south,” rather than to the “west” (Fig. 1). Such a conformation of the disulfide is sterically hindered in rhodniin and Japanese quail ovomucoid third domain, since it would result in a clash of the amino-terminal residues with those of the longer α-helix. Although not well defined, there is sufficient density to show that the two amino-terminal lysine residues reach out toward the trypsin loop containing residue 148 (referred to as the “148-loop”). Structure-based sequence alignment of mast cell tryptases with trypsin (16Johnson D.A. Barton G.J. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 370-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) reveals this loop to be acidic in the tryptases (see Fig.3), making it conceivable that the basic amino terminus of LDTI makes an electrostatic contribution to its interaction with tryptase. To test this hypothesis, a series of N-terminally truncated and charge-deleted variants were constructed using cassette mutagenesis. The yeast expression system gave yields of the variants of the order of 12 mg/liter, whose purity and identity were analyzed using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, isoelectric focusing, and reverse phase HPLC. Correct processing of the α mating type leader fusion protein was verified by partial N-terminal sequencing in each case. Mass spectroscopy of the variants yielded major masses for LDTI-var1 of 4609.3 Da (calculated mass, 4609.35 Da), for LDTI-var2 of 4480.8 Da (calculated mass, 4481.18 Da), and two masses in a 1:1 ratio for LDTI-var3 of 4736.9/4719.4 Da (calculated mass, 4737.45 Da). The lower mass peak observed for LDTI-var3 was attributed to partial formation of pyroglutamate. Variants rLDTI-var1 and rLDTI-var2 both showed an additional minor mass with a reduced value of 114.0 ± 1 Da compared with the major peak, interpreted as the truncation of the C-terminal Asn46by endogenous yeast proteinases. Equilibrium dissociation constants were measured for each variant with trypsin, tryptase and chymotrypsin (Table II). Sequential deletion of the first and second N-terminal lysines (variants 1 and 2, respectively) had a marked effect on anti-tryptase activity but only a negligible effect on the interaction with trypsin or chymotrypsin. This was also the case for the substitution of these residues by the uncharged polar residue glutamine (variant 3), substantiating the positive charge requirement. A series of variants designed to allow thrombin inhibition (see accompanying paper (36Morenweiser R. Auerswald E.A. van de Locht A. Fritz H. Stürzebecher J. Stubbs M.T. J. Biol.

Mutation of four residues in the reactive site (rLDTI-varθ3) resulted in a modest decrease in tryptase inhibition, as did variant rLDTI-varθ2, C-terminally elongated by an acidic peptide.

The derived amino acid sequences of SbcC and SbcD are similar to those of the putative major exonucleases of bacteriophage T4 (gp46 and gp47) and T5 (gpD13 and gpD12) (14Naom I.S. Morton S.J. Leach D.R.F. Lloyd R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 8033-8045Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 20Leach D.R.F. Lloyd R.G. Coulson A.F.C. Genetica. 1992; 87: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In addition, the gam gene of bacteriophage λ allows palindrome-containing phage to plate on strains of E. colithat are sbcCD +, suggesting that the Gam protein might actually inhibit two nucleases, RecBCD and SbcCD (28Kulkarni S.K. Stahl F.W. Genetics. 1989; 123: 249-253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that the SbcCD protein from E. coli possesses an ATP-dependent double-strand DNA exonuclease activity that requires both SbcC and SbcD (29Connelly J.C. Leach D.R.F. Genes to Cells. 1996; 1: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In this work we describe the construction of an sbcCD deletion strain and the overexpression of the SbcC and SbcD polypeptides, detail the purification of SbcCD, investigate the biochemical properties of the double-strand exonuclease activity, and characterize the general physical properties of the purified protein.DISCUSSIONAn E. coli strain carrying a chromosomal deletion of the sbcCD operon was constructed and used to overexpress the SbcC and SbcD polypeptides from a plasmid containing thesbcC and sbcD genes under the control of the strong trc promoter. Following 6 h of IPTG induction, both polypeptides were co-expressed to approximately 6% of total cell protein. A purification scheme was devised that yielded 2.53 mg of soluble SbcCD protein from 20 g (wet weight) of cells. The SbcC and SbcD polypeptides copurified through three chromatographic steps and an ammonium sulfate precipitation step. A significant reduction in yield had to be accepted due to the presence of an 87-kDa contaminating protein (Table I and Fig. 2).The double-strand exonuclease activity of SbcCD has an absolute requirement for Mn2+ ions, other divalent metal ions tested failed to stimulate activity (Table II). SbcCD is most active under conditions of high free Mn2+ concentration (Fig. 4,A and B). SbcD contains the phosphoesterase signature sequence and has the potential to form a β-α-β-α-β secondary structure in and around this conserved sequence (Fig. 8). Many members of this class of protein require transition metals (including Mn2+) for activity (15Zhuo S. Clemens J.C. Stone R.L. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26234-26238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For example, the recombinant catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (from rabbit) is produced as an inactive enzyme in E. coli that can only be activated by Mn2+. However, it has recently been demonstrated that a combination of Fe2+ and Zn2+ (but not the individual metal ions) can significantly activate this enzyme (36Chu Y. Lee E.Y.C. Schlender K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2574-2577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that SbcD may also be a metalloprotein capable of co-ordinating two metal ions via the β-α-β-α-β secondary structure. A two-metal catalytic mechanism has previously been proposed for the 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity of DNA polymerase I (37Beese L.S. Steitz T.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar).SbcCD has a requirement for a nucleoside triphosphate cofactor (TableII). Stimulation was only seen when the concentration of ATP was lower than that of Mn2+ (Fig. 4, A and B). This is reminiscent of the E. coli RecBCD enzyme whose nonspecific nuclease activities are more active when the concentration of Mg2+ ions is greater than that of ATP (38Eichler D.C. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 499-503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Eggleston A.K. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 605-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). SbcC possesses the ATP-A and ATP-B nucleotide binding motifs; therefore it is likely to be the component of the SbcCD protein that interacts with ATP. To test whether ATP hydrolysis was required for activity, nuclease assays were performed in the presence of the nonhydrolyzable analog ATPγS. The activity in the presence of 1 mm ATPγS was 30% of that in the presence of 1 mm ATP, suggesting that hydrolysis is not required for activity. The RAD50 protein only binds double-strand DNA in the presence of an adenosine triphosphate at concentrations of 2–5 mm. High level ATPase activity is not associated with this protein (40Raymond W.E. Kleckner N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3851-3856Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The DNA-binding protein MukB only binds ATP and GTP at concentrations > 0.1 mm in the presence of Zn2+. No ATPase or GTPase activity has been detected for MukB (24Niki H. Imamura R. Kitaoka M. Yamanaka K. Ogura T. Hiraga S. EMBO J. 1992; 13: 5101-5109Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar).SbcCD acts catalytically and processively (Fig. 5, A andB). In the experiment that demonstrates that SbcCD acts catalytically, K m (app) varies with protein concentration (Table III), suggesting that a factor in the reaction is limiting.SbcC and SbcD co-eluted throughout purification. It was surprising to find that purified SbcC and SbcD, at a concentration of 2 mg/ml, did not co-migrate when applied to a gel filtration column (Figs.6 A and 7 B). In the final stage of purification, protein was applied to a hydroxyapatite column at 0.82 mg/ml, yet both polypeptides still co-eluted (Fig. 2). Therefore the dissociation of SbcC and SbcD that was observed was not due to a concentration effect alone. Human protein phosphatase 1, when purified from native sources, does not require metal ions for activity yet is converted into a metal ion-dependent form after long term storage. This suggests that residues in the vicinity of the active site alter in conformation, and then metal ions are released (Ref. 35Egloff M.P. Cohen P.T.W. Reinemer P. Barford D. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 942-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar and references therein). Perhaps similar changes result in the dissociation of the SbcCD complex.FPLC gel filtration analysis revealed that SbcC and SbcD have relative molecular masses of 1150 and 85 kDa, respectively (Fig. 6 B). This suggests that in the peak fraction SbcD exists as a dimer and SbcC exists as a higher order multimer. Mn2+ ions, in addition to stimulating the double-strand exonuclease activity of SbcCD, also promoted an interaction between SbcC and SbcD. In the presence of Mn2+, SbcD elutes in a 1:1 molar ratio with SbcC at high molecular mass. A similar metal-mediated interaction is observed when the RuvB protein of E. coli forms dodecamers in the presence of Mg2+ ions (41Mitchell A.H. West S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 208-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The Mn2+ stimulation of exonuclease activity indicates that these ions are important catalytically. However, the observation that Mn2+ ions promote an interaction between SbcC and SbcD suggests that Mn2+ also plays a structural role, perhaps by inducing a conformational change in SbcD that favors interaction with SbcC.Sedimentation equilibrium analysis detected two species with molecular masses of 720 (in the absence of Mn2+) and 1210 kDa (in the presence of Mn2+). These data indicate that an interaction is taking place in the absence of Mn2+ and that the relative molecular mass of SbcC in the absence of Mn2+estimated by FPLC gel filtration was an overestimate. This anomalous migration can be explained by sequence analyses predicting that SbcC forms a filamentous protein with two globular domains linked by a central rod. Proteins with this shape do not migrate typically upon gel filtration. From the gel filtration data it is clear that under the conditions used SbcC and SbcD do not readily associate in the absence of Mn2+. It is also probable that under the sedimentation conditions used to measure the 720- and 1210-kDa species, the monomer masses of SbcD and SbcC (44.7 and 118.7 kDa, respectively) would be hidden. 3N. Errington, personal communication. The 720-kDa species might represent a hexamer of SbcC. This figure is very close to that expected for a hexamer of SbcC (712.2 kDa). The molecular mass of 1210 kDa for the SbcCD complex in the presence of Mn2+ is close to that predicted for SbcC6 SbcD12 (1249 kDa). This would argue in favor of a 2:1 ratio of SbcD to SbcC as opposed to the 1:1 ratio suggested by densitometry. Further experiments are required to resolve the precise stoichiometry of the complex.This work is a first step in understanding the mechanism of SbcCD action. The SbcC and SbcD polypeptides interact to form a high molecular weight complex in the presence of manganese ions. Together, in the presence of ATP, both polypeptides function as a processive double-strand exonuclease. SbcC is an SMC family member, and a number of these proteins were isolated as or have been shown to be DNA-binding proteins. SbcD is a member of a group of proteins that have in common the ability to hydrolyze phosphoester bonds (15Zhuo S. Clemens J.C. Stone R.L. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26234-26238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We suggest that SbcC is the main DNA-binding subunit of the SbcCD protein (which is activated by ATP-binding or hydrolysis) and that SbcD is a metalloprotein that contains the catalytic center for the hydrolysis of DNA. Exactly how both polypeptides interact with each other and palindromic DNA remains to be investigated.

ThesbcC gene encodes a large 118.7-kDa polypeptide that contains the ATP-A and ATP-B nucleotide binding motifs in globular regions at either end of the protein (14Naom I.S. Morton S.J. Leach D.R.F.

These are separated by a large α-helical region that is predicted to form two coiled-coil domains interrupted by a short spacer (16Sharples G.J. Leach D.R.F. Mol.

The derived amino acid sequences of SbcC and SbcD are similar to those of the putative major exonucleases of bacteriophage T4 (gp46 and gp47) and T5 (gpD13 and gpD12) (14Naom I.S. Morton S.J. Leach D.R.F. Lloyd R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 8033-8045Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 20Leach D.R.F. Lloyd R.G. Coulson A.F.C. Genetica. 1992; 87: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In addition, the gam gene of bacteriophage λ allows palindrome-containing phage to plate on strains of E. colithat are sbcCD +, suggesting that the Gam protein might actually inhibit two nucleases, RecBCD and SbcCD (28Kulkarni S.K. Stahl F.W. Genetics. 1989; 123: 249-253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that the SbcCD protein from E. coli possesses an ATP-dependent double-strand DNA exonuclease activity that requires both SbcC and SbcD (29Connelly J.C. Leach D.R.F. Genes to Cells. 1996; 1: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In this work we describe the construction of an sbcCD deletion strain and the overexpression of the SbcC and SbcD polypeptides, detail the purification of SbcCD, investigate the biochemical properties of the double-strand exonuclease activity, and characterize the general physical properties of the purified protein. DISCUSSIONAn E. coli strain carrying a chromosomal deletion of the sbcCD operon was constructed and used to overexpress the SbcC and SbcD polypeptides from a plasmid containing thesbcC and sbcD genes under the control of the strong trc promoter. Following 6 h of IPTG induction, both polypeptides were co-expressed to approximately 6% of total cell protein. A purification scheme was devised that yielded 2.53 mg of soluble SbcCD protein from 20 g (wet weight) of cells. The SbcC and SbcD polypeptides copurified through three chromatographic steps and an ammonium sulfate precipitation step. A significant reduction in yield had to be accepted due to the presence of an 87-kDa contaminating protein (Table I and Fig. 2).The double-strand exonuclease activity of SbcCD has an absolute requirement for Mn2+ ions, other divalent metal ions tested failed to stimulate activity (Table II). SbcCD is most active under conditions of high free Mn2+ concentration (Fig. 4,A and B). SbcD contains the phosphoesterase signature sequence and has the potential to form a β-α-β-α-β secondary structure in and around this conserved sequence (Fig. 8). Many members of this class of protein require transition metals (including Mn2+) for activity (15Zhuo S. Clemens J.C. Stone R.L. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26234-26238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For example, the recombinant catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (from rabbit) is produced as an inactive enzyme in E. coli that can only be activated by Mn2+. However, it has recently been demonstrated that a combination of Fe2+ and Zn2+ (but not the individual metal ions) can significantly activate this enzyme (36Chu Y. Lee E.Y.C. Schlender K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2574-2577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that SbcD may also be a metalloprotein capable of co-ordinating two metal ions via the β-α-β-α-β secondary structure. A two-metal catalytic mechanism has previously been proposed for the 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity of DNA polymerase I (37Beese L.S. Steitz T.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar).SbcCD has a requirement for a nucleoside triphosphate cofactor (TableII). Stimulation was only seen when the concentration of ATP was lower than that of Mn2+ (Fig. 4, A and B). This is reminiscent of the E. coli RecBCD enzyme whose nonspecific nuclease activities are more active when the concentration of Mg2+ ions is greater than that of ATP (38Eichler D.C. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 499-503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Eggleston A.K. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 605-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). SbcC possesses the ATP-A and ATP-B nucleotide binding motifs; therefore it is likely to be the component of the SbcCD protein that interacts with ATP. To test whether ATP hydrolysis was required for activity, nuclease assays were performed in the presence of the nonhydrolyzable analog ATPγS. The activity in the presence of 1 mm ATPγS was 30% of that in the presence of 1 mm ATP, suggesting that hydrolysis is not required for activity. The RAD50 protein only binds double-strand DNA in the presence of an adenosine triphosphate at concentrations of 2–5 mm. High level ATPase activity is not associated with this protein (40Raymond W.E. Kleckner N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3851-3856Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The DNA-binding protein MukB only binds ATP and GTP at concentrations > 0.1 mm in the presence of Zn2+. No ATPase or GTPase activity has been detected for MukB (24Niki H. Imamura R. Kitaoka M. Yamanaka K. Ogura T. Hiraga S. EMBO J. 1992; 13: 5101-5109Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar).SbcCD acts catalytically and processively (Fig. 5, A andB). In the experiment that demonstrates that SbcCD acts catalytically, K m (app) varies with protein concentration (Table III), suggesting that a factor in the reaction is limiting.SbcC and SbcD co-eluted throughout purification. It was surprising to find that purified SbcC and SbcD, at a concentration of 2 mg/ml, did not co-migrate when applied to a gel filtration column (Figs.6 A and 7 B). In the final stage of purification, protein was applied to a hydroxyapatite column at 0.82 mg/ml, yet both polypeptides still co-eluted (Fig. 2). Therefore the dissociation of SbcC and SbcD that was observed was not due to a concentration effect alone. Human protein phosphatase 1, when purified from native sources, does not require metal ions for activity yet is converted into a metal ion-dependent form after long term storage. This suggests that residues in the vicinity of the active site alter in conformation, and then metal ions are released (Ref. 35Egloff M.P. Cohen P.T.W. Reinemer P. Barford D. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 942-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar and references therein). Perhaps similar changes result in the dissociation of the SbcCD complex.FPLC gel filtration analysis revealed that SbcC and SbcD have relative molecular masses of 1150 and 85 kDa, respectively (Fig. 6 B). This suggests that in the peak fraction SbcD exists as a dimer and SbcC exists as a higher order multimer. Mn2+ ions, in addition to stimulating the double-strand exonuclease activity of SbcCD, also promoted an interaction between SbcC and SbcD. In the presence of Mn2+, SbcD elutes in a 1:1 molar ratio with SbcC at high molecular mass. A similar metal-mediated interaction is observed when the RuvB protein of E. coli forms dodecamers in the presence of Mg2+ ions (41Mitchell A.H. West S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 208-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The Mn2+ stimulation of exonuclease activity indicates that these ions are important catalytically. However, the observation that Mn2+ ions promote an interaction between SbcC and SbcD suggests that Mn2+ also plays a structural role, perhaps by inducing a conformational change in SbcD that favors interaction with SbcC.Sedimentation equilibrium analysis detected two species with molecular masses of 720 (in the absence of Mn2+) and 1210 kDa (in the presence of Mn2+). These data indicate that an interaction is taking place in the absence of Mn2+ and that the relative molecular mass of SbcC in the absence of Mn2+estimated by FPLC gel filtration was an overestimate. This anomalous migration can be explained by sequence analyses predicting that SbcC forms a filamentous protein with two globular domains linked by a central rod. Proteins with this shape do not migrate typically upon gel filtration. From the gel filtration data it is clear that under the conditions used SbcC and SbcD do not readily associate in the absence of Mn2+. It is also probable that under the sedimentation conditions used to measure the 720- and 1210-kDa species, the monomer masses of SbcD and SbcC (44.7 and 118.7 kDa, respectively) would be hidden. 3N. Errington, personal communication. The 720-kDa species might represent a hexamer of SbcC. This figure is very close to that expected for a hexamer of SbcC (712.2 kDa). The molecular mass of 1210 kDa for the SbcCD complex in the presence of Mn2+ is close to that predicted for SbcC6 SbcD12 (1249 kDa). This would argue in favor of a 2:1 ratio of SbcD to SbcC as opposed to the 1:1 ratio suggested by densitometry. Further experiments are required to resolve the precise stoichiometry of the complex.This work is a first step in understanding the mechanism of SbcCD action. The SbcC and SbcD polypeptides interact to form a high molecular weight complex in the presence of manganese ions. Together, in the presence of ATP, both polypeptides function as a processive double-strand exonuclease. SbcC is an SMC family member, and a number of these proteins were isolated as or have been shown to be DNA-binding proteins. SbcD is a member of a group of proteins that have in common the ability to hydrolyze phosphoester bonds (15Zhuo S. Clemens J.C. Stone R.L. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26234-26238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We suggest that SbcC is the main DNA-binding subunit of the SbcCD protein (which is activated by ATP-binding or hydrolysis) and that SbcD is a metalloprotein that contains the catalytic center for the hydrolysis of DNA. Exactly how both polypeptides interact with each other and palindromic DNA remains to be investigated. An E. coli strain carrying a chromosomal deletion of the sbcCD operon was constructed and used to overexpress the SbcC and SbcD polypeptides from a plasmid containing thesbcC and sbcD genes under the control of the strong trc promoter.

https://openalex.org/W2003044725,"Expression of several proteins of higher eukaryotes is post-transcriptionally regulated by interaction of iron-responsive elements (IREs) on their mRNAs and iron regulatory proteins (IRP1 and IRP2). IRP1 is a redox-sensitive iron-sulfur protein whose regulatory activity is modulated by iron depletion, synthesis of nitric oxide, or oxidative stress. IRP2 is closely related to IRP1, but it does not possess a [Fe-S] cluster. IRP2 is also regulated by intracellular iron level, but it is assumed that regulation is achieved by accelerated turn-over. In this report, the effect of peroxynitrite, a strong oxidant produced when nitric oxide and O·̄2 are biosynthesized simultaneously, on the RNA binding activity of IRP1 and IRP2 was investigated in vitro. Macrophage cytosolic extracts were exposed directly to a bolus addition of peroxynitrite or to SIN-1, which releases a continuous flux of peroxynitrite. Under these two experimental conditions, IRP1 lost its aconitase activity but did not gain increased capacity to bind IRE. However, addition of low amounts of the disulfide-reducing agent 2-ME during the binding assay revealed formation of a complex between IRP1 and IRE. Substrates of aconitase, which bind to the cluster of IRP1, prevented this effect, pointing to the [Fe-S] cluster as the target of peroxynitrite. Moreover, single mutation of the redox active Cys437precluded oxidation of human recombinant IRP1 by SIN-1. Collectively, these results imply that peroxynitrite predisposes IRP1 to bind IREs under a suitable reducing environment. It is assumed that in addition to disrupting the cluster peroxynitrite also promotes disulfide bridge(s) between proximal cysteine residues in the vicinity of the IRE-binding domain, in particular Cys437. When exposed to peroxynitrite, IRP2 lost its spontaneous IRE binding activity, which was restored by further exposure to 2-mercaptoethanol, thus showing that peroxynitrite can also regulate IRP2 by a post-translational event.

Binding of IRPs to 5′IRE represses translation (9Gray N.K. Hentze M.W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3882-3891Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), whereas binding to IREs of the 3′-UTR of transferrin receptor mRNA protects it from nuclease attack (10Binder R. Horowitz J.A. Basilion J.P. Koeller D.M. Klausner R.D. Harford J.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1969-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). By modulating transferrin receptor and ferritin expression in a coordinate manner, IRPs are therefore potent regulators of iron homeostasis in higher eukaryotes (see Refs. 11Kühn L.C. Hentze M.W. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1992; 47: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar and 12Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Cell. 1993; 72: 19-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar for review). IRP1 is also the cytosolic counterpart of mitochondrial aconitase (13Kennedy M.C. Mende-Mueller L. Blondin G.A. Beinert H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11730-11734Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), an Fe-S enzyme that converts citrate into isocitrate in the Krebs cycle. IRP1 is only 30% homologous with mitochondrial aconitase, but the 18 active site residues are identical (14Rouault T.A. Stout C.D. Kaptain S. Harford J.B. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1991; 64: 881-883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), and it also possesses a Fe-S cluster ligated by Cys437, Cys503, and Cys506 (15Hirling H. Henderson B.R. Kühn L.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 16Philpott C.C. Haile D. Rouault T.A. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17655-17658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The interaction between IRE and IRP1 is prevented by the presence of the Fe-S cluster, which is located in the vicinity of the active site. Indeed, the IRE-binding domain and the catalytic site overlap (17Basilion J. Rouault T.A. Massinople C.M. Klausner R.D. Burgess W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 574-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), which explains why the two functions are interrelated. In fact, the two activities of IRP1 are mutually exclusive, and the relative amounts of these two forms depend on the intracellular iron content. In iron-replete cells, IRP1 contains a [4Fe-4S] cluster that prevents binding to IRE. Conversely, in iron-depleted cells, IRP1 is an apo-protein with high affinity for IRE (11Kühn L.C. Hentze M.W. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1992; 47: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 12Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Cell. 1993; 72: 19-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). In addition to fluctuation of cellular iron level, synthesis of nitric oxide (NO) from l-arginine also regulates IRP1 activities. Indeed, in response to NO production, several cell types including macrophages and neurones exhibit converse modulation of aconitase and IRE binding activities of IRP1 (18Drapier J.C. Hirling H. Wietzerbin J. Kaldy P. Kühn L.C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3643-3649Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 19Weiss G. Goossen B. Doppler W. Fuchs D. Pantopoulos K. Werner-Felmayer G. Wachter H. Hentze M.W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3651-3657Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 20Jaffrey S.R. Cohen N.A. Rouault T.A. Klausner R.D. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12994-12998Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Increase in IRE binding activity in response to NO synthesis correlates with ferritin repression and increase in transferrin receptor expression (19Weiss G. Goossen B. Doppler W. Fuchs D. Pantopoulos K. Werner-Felmayer G. Wachter H. Hentze M.W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3651-3657Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 21Phillips J.D. Kinikini D.V. Yu Y. Guo B. Leibold E.A. Blood. 1996; 87: 2983-2992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), thus pointing to a connection between the l-arginine/NO pathway and iron metabolism. Interestingly, conversion of IRP1 from aconitase to RNA binding activity proceeds through a post-translational process. This discovery gave Fe-S clusters the novel status of potential sensors of oxidative signals able to regulate DNA or RNA-protein interaction (22Rouault T.A Klausner R.D. Trends Biochem Sci. 1996; 21: 174-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). This proved true for human ferrochelatase (23Sellers V.M. Johnson M.K. Dailey H.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2699-2704Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and, in Escherichia coli, for FNR (product of thefumarate nitrate reduction gene), which regulates transcription of genes encoding enzymes required for anaerobic respiration (24Lazzazera B.A. Beinert H. Khoroshilova N. Kennedy M.C. Kiley P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2762-2768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), and for SoxR, which participates in induction of several genes in response to O·̄2 and NO (25Nunoshiba T. DeRojas-Walker T. Wishnok J.S. Tannenbaum S.R. Demple B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9993-9997Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). IRP2, originally identified in rodent cells, has aroused growing interest because its presence in many cell types and species has been acknowledged. IRP2 has 62% amino acid identity with IRP1 (26Guo B. Phillips J.D. Yu Y. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21645-21651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) but differs from it by the presence of a 73-amino acid insertion sequence. IRP2 lacks aconitase activity, and despite conservation of most of the active site residues of IRP1, in particular the three cysteines that ligate the Fe-S cluster in IRP1, it seems not to have a Fe-S cluster. IRP2 is also regulated by cellular iron concentration, but unlike IRP1 it is rapidly degraded in response to iron. Regulation requiresde novo protein synthesis, and degradation is dependent on the presence of the insertion sequence (27Henderson B.R. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 28Henderson B.R. Seiser C. Kühn L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27327-27334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Guo B. Yu Y. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24252-24260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Samaniego F. Chin J. Iwai K. Rouault T.A. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30904-30910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A central issue regarding the post-translational regulation of IRP1 is understanding of the mechanism by which it can quickly change from the holo form into the apo form. Little is known about how a Fe-S cluster can be extruded or inserted in vivo. Recent characterization of a cysteine sulfur transferase that participates in cluster formation of Azotobacter vinelandii nitrogenase (NifS protein) (31Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Jack R.F. Dean D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2754-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar) led to the suggestion that such an enzymatic system may also exist in mammalian cells. However, the mechanism of Fe-S cluster extrusion remains to be established. We previously showed that converse modulation of IRP1 activities kinetically correlates with NO production in macrophages (18Drapier J.C. Hirling H. Wietzerbin J. Kaldy P. Kühn L.C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3643-3649Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). This suggests that NO or some species derived from NO can directly react with the Fe-S cluster of IRP1 without damaging the overall structure of the protein. Several lines of evidence indicate that transition metals and reactive cysteine may represent redox sensors involved in the control of regulatory activities of proteins by biological radicals (32O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1993; 261: 715-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 33Stamler J.S. Cell. 1994; 78: 831-836Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1633) Google Scholar). It is therefore worth seeking better understanding of the biochemical effect of NO and NO-related species on the interactions between IRPs and IRE. Much interest is currently focused on higher oxides of NO, in particular peroxynitrite. It is now widely accepted that peroxynitrite, a potent oxidant derived from the reaction between NO and O·̄2, spearheads the effector mechanism of NO in several biological processes including anti-microbial activity and inhibition of mitochondrial respiration (34Denicola A. Rubbo H. Rodriguez D. Radi R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 304: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 35Brunelli L. Crow J.P. Beckman J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Peroxynitrite achieves this through its ability to inactivate Fe-S cluster-containing enzymes such as complex I and II (36Cassina A. Radi R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 328: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, 37Rubbo H. Denicola A. Radi R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 308: 96-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 38Radi R. Rodriguez M. Castro L. Telleri R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 308: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Peroxynitrite promotes lipid peroxidation (39Rubbo H. Radi R. Trujillo M. Telleri R. Kalyanaraman B. Barnes S. Kirk M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26066-26075Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), DNA fragmentation (40Szabo C. Zingarelli B. O'Connor M. Salzman A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1753-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar), and nitration of phenolic rings after reaction with metals (41Ischiropoulos H. Zhu L. Chen J. Tsai M. Martin J.C. Smith C.D. Beckman J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar). It reacts avidly with sulfhydryl groups, especially those of cysteines (42Radi R. Beckman J.S,. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4244-4250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and inactivates yeast alcohol dehydrogenase by disrupting its zinc-thiolate cluster (43Crow J.P. Beckman J.S. McCord J.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3544-3552Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Peroxynitrite can also inactivate the enzymatic activity of both mitochondrial aconitase and IRP1 (44Castro L. Rodriguez M. Radi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29409-29415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Hausladen A. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29405-29408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a previous paper, we reported that despite its capacity to inactivate aconitase activity of IRP1, peroxynitrite is unable to increase IRP1 RNA binding (46Bouton C. Raveau M. Drapier J.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2300-2306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To help solve this puzzling issue, we studied the conditions under which IRP-1 and IRP2 are sensitive to peroxynitrite. We show that low concentrations of 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME) reverted inactivation of RNA binding by peroxynitrite. Studies with recombinant human IRP1 revealed that point mutation of the cysteine residue at position 437 rendered the protein insensitive to SIN-1, thus arguing that peroxynitrite oxidizes the cluster-ligating Cys437. Furthermore, we also report that IRP2 is sensitive to redox influence and can be inactivated by peroxynitrite. SIN-1 was synthesized by Cassella AG (Frankfurt, Germany) and kindly provided by J. Winicki (Laboratoires Hoechst, France). Dihydrorhodamine was from Molecular Probes (Leiden, The Netherlands). Peroxynitrite was synthesized as described (47Beckman J.S. Chen J. Ischiropoulos H. Crow J.P. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar) and concentrated by freezing. In some experiments, residual hydrogen peroxide in the final solution was removed by passing the peroxynitrite solution over solid granular manganese dioxide (Prolabo, France). The concentration was determined spectrophotometrically at 302 nm (ε = 1670 m−1 cm−1). Citrate,cis-aconitate, and all other chemicals were from Sigma. The mouse macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. The cells were grown at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% low endotoxin fetal calf serum. The rat C58 pre-T cell line was kindly supplied by Dr. L. C. Kühn (ISREC, Epalinges, Switzerland). C58 cells were cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% low endotoxin fetal calf serum. Mitochondria-free cytosolic extracts were prepared from both murine macrophages RAW 264.7 and rat C58 cells, as described previously (46Bouton C. Raveau M. Drapier J.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2300-2306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested, washed, and treated with 0.007% digitonin for 5 min at 4 °C in 0.25m sucrose, 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. The resulting lysate was then centrifuged at 75,000 rpm for 20 min in a TL 100 Beckman ultracentrifuge. The cytosolic extract (0.5 mg/ml) was treated with increasing concentrations of peroxynitrite in 200 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, for at least 10 min. Peroxynitrite was diluted in 0.05 m NaOH, and 1–2 μl were applied to the inside of the surface of an Eppendorf tube. The solutions were then mixed by quickly spinning the tube containing IRPs, and the pH stability of the preparation was checked for all peroxynitrite treatments. The peroxynitrite stock solution contains significant amounts of sodium chloride, sodium hydrochloride, nitrite, and hydrogen peroxide (47Beckman J.S. Chen J. Ischiropoulos H. Crow J.P. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). Thus, the effects of these residual contaminants on IRE binding activity of IRP were evaluated by the reverse order-of-addition experiment, which consists of adding peroxynitrite to buffer to let it decompose for a few minutes prior to adding cytosolic extracts containing IRP. In some experiments, peroxynitrite treated-IRP was exposed to other reaction components such as aconitase substrates and 2-ME. Cytosolic extracts were incubated with SIN-1, a peroxynitrite-generating compound, at 37 °C for 30 min in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 40 mm KCl, 3 mmMgCl2, and 5% glycerol before analyzing IRE binding activity and aconitase activity. The pSPT-fer plasmid containing the IRE of human ferritin H-chain was a generous gift from Dr. L. C. Kühn (ISREC, Epalinges, Switzerland). Plasmid was linerarized by BamHI and translated in vitro by T7 DNA polymerase in the presence of 50 μCi of [32P]CTP (NEN Life Science Products). The expression vectors for recombinant IRP1-wt and IRP1-S437 have been constructed in the Laboratory of Dr. Lukas C. Kühn (Epalinges, Switzerland). Recombinant wild type and Cys437 to Ser437mutant human IRP1 were expressed as glutathioneS-transferase fusion proteins in E. coli and purified on a glutathione-Sepharose column as described (15Hirling H. Henderson B.R. Kühn L.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). To prepare apo-IRP1-wt, the [Fe-S] cluster was removed by treatment with 10 mm ferricyanide in the presence of 0.1 mmEDTA, followed by exposure to 0.1% 2-ME. After desalting on a Bio-Spin 6 column (Bio-Rad), apo-IRP1-wt was incubated with SIN-1 for 30 min at 37 °C prior to analysis for RNA binding. IRP1-S437 was exposed to SIN-1 under the same conditions. IRE·IRP complexes were measured as described previously (1Leibold E.A. Munro H.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2171-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 7Müllner E. Neupert B. Kühn L.C. Cell. 1989; 58: 373-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) by incubating 3–5 μg of cytoplasmic protein with saturating amounts (0.1 ng = 50,000 cpm) of32P-labeled ferritin IRE probe in 20 μl of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 40 mm KCl, 3 mmMgCl2, and 5% glycerol. After a 20-min incubation at room temperature, 1 μl of RNase T1 (1 unit/μl) was added, and 10 min later 2 μl of 50 mg/ml heparin were added. After 10 min, IRE·IRP complexes were resolved on a nondenaturing 6% acrylamide gel. Where indicated, 2-ME (2%) was included in the reactions prior to the addition of the 32P-labeled IRE probe. Gels were scanned, and IRE·protein complexes were quantified with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Band shift experiments were performed at least three times with similar results, and one representative experiment is shown. Binding specificity has been demonstrated by competitive studies using excess unlabeled IRE probe. Cytoplasmic extracts (80 μg) were desalted on Bio-Spin 6 columns (Bio-Rad) prior to incubation with 0.2 mm cis-aconitate in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, at 37 °C. Aconitase activity was determined by measuring the disappearance of cis-aconitate at 240 nm (48Drapier J.C. Hibbs Jr., J.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 78: 790-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Units represent nanomoles of substrate consumed/min at 37 °C (ε = 3.6 mm−1 cm−1). Peroxynitrite released from SIN-1 was measured spectrophotometrically by monitoring the oxidation of dihydrorhodamine at 500 nm as described previously (43Crow J.P. Beckman J.S. McCord J.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3544-3552Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The protein content of cytoplasmic extracts was determined by using the Bio-Rad protein assay with bovine serum albumin as standard. Previous reports emphasized the importance of free sulfhydryl groups in IRP1 binding to IRE (15Hirling H. Henderson B.R. Kühn L.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 16Philpott C.C. Haile D. Rouault T.A. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17655-17658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,49Hentze M.W. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Klausner R.D. Science. 1989; 244: 357-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Because peroxynitrite is a strong oxidant able to oxidize thiols (42Radi R. Beckman J.S,. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4244-4250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), formation of disulfide bridge has been sought by titrating IRP1 with increasing amounts of 2-ME. Cytosolic extracts prepared from RAW 264.7 macrophages were first exposed to peroxynitrite added as a bolus at room temperature. Then, aconitase activity was measured spectrophotometrically, and IRE binding activity of IRP1 was determined by an electromobility shift assay. Peroxynitrite dose-dependently inhibited aconitase activity with an IC50of approximately 30 μm (not shown). Peroxynitrite did not enhance RNA binding of IRP1. However, an increase in IRE binding activity was observed when the binding assay was performed in the presence of the disulfide-reducing agent 2-ME from a concentration as low as 0.01% (compare the second and third lanes to the first lane in Fig.1). Under the same experimental conditions, decomposed peroxynitrite (reverse order of addition experiment) was not effective (Fig. 1, bottom). Cytosolic extracts were also exposed for 30 min at 37 °C to SIN-1, a sydnonimine that releases stoichiometric amounts of NO and O·̄2and is therefore a useful donor of peroxynitrite. As determined by oxidation of dihydrorhodamine (43Crow J.P. Beckman J.S. McCord J.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3544-3552Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), 5 mm SIN-1 released peroxynitrite at a rate of 5 μm/min during the 30-min incubation (not shown). As can be seen in Fig.2, SIN-1-treated cell extracts that exhibit little IRE binding were almost maximally activated for IRE binding when they were further treated with 0.1% 2-ME. No activation of control IRP1 was observed under these conditions. To gain further insights into the modification of IRP1 induced by peroxynitrite, cytosolic extracts were exposed to increasing amounts of peroxynitrite, and IRE binding activity of IRP1 was measured under three experimental conditions: 1) in the presence of 0.02% 2-ME to which, as shown above, peroxynitrite-treated IRP1 is sensitive, 2) in the presence of 2% 2-ME, which induces full IRE binding activity of IRP1, and 3) in the presence of both cis-aconitate and 2% 2-ME to distinguish the cluster-containing forms ([4Fe-4S] or [3Fe-4S]-IRP1), which are protected by cis-aconitate against the effect of 2% 2-ME, from the apoprotein, which is not. As previously shown for mitochondrial aconitase, this protection is due to the capacity of substrates to bind the labile fourth Fe of the cluster (50Beinert H. Kennedy M.C. Stout D.S. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2335-3373Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). In parallel, aconitase activity was determined in peroxynitrite-treated cytosolic extracts. When exposed to peroxynitrite concentrations up to 1 μm, IRP1 exhibited high aconitase activity and low IRE binding activity even in the presence of 0.02% 2-ME (Fig. 3). These samples also showed maximal IRE binding activity when treated with 2% 2-ME, but it is worth noting that this effect was totally blocked by 1 mm cis-aconitate. Collectively, these results indicate that the IRP1 [4Fe-4S] cluster remained intact. When exposed to increasing amounts of peroxynitrite, aconitase activity sharply declined, but up to 100 μm, IRP1 did not gain any capacity to bind IRE, even though binding assay was performed in the presence of low concentrations of 2-ME. Further, it was protected by the aconitase substrate, cis-aconitate, against the effect of large amounts (2%) of 2-ME. When exposed to peroxynitrite concentrations above 100 μm, binding to IRE was permitted by further exposure to 0.02% 2-ME, and cis-aconitate no longer prevented the binding to IRE in the presence of 2% 2-ME. To determine whether peroxynitrite targets the active site of IRP1, we took advantage of the ability of aconitase substrates to stabilize the aconitase Fe-S cluster. Cytosolic extracts were exposed to a bolus addition of 500 μm peroxynitrite, a concentration sufficient to fully inactivate aconitase activity and to trigger high IRE binding activity after exposure to 0.02% 2-ME. As shown in Fig.4, inclusion of citrate with cell extract before addition of peroxynitrite dose-dependently prevented enhancement of RNA binding revealed by low doses of 2-ME (Fig. 4,upper panel). As regards aconitase activity, citrate also protected IRP1 against peroxynitrite-mediated inhibition (Fig. 4,lower panel). Similar results were obtained with 1 mm cis-aconitate, which is a better substrate of mitochondrial aconitase (51Schloss J.V. Porter D.J. Bright H.J. Cleland W.W. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 2358-2362Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). Interestingly, we observed that IRE binding activity of IRP2 markedly decreased after exposure to peroxynitrite but neither citrate nor cis-aconitate had any protective effect. This is consistent with the assumed lack of Fe-S cluster in IRP2. As previously documented, Cys437 must be reduced to allow IRP1-IRE interaction (15Hirling H. Henderson B.R. Kühn L.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). To determine whether peroxynitrite promotes a disulfide bridge involving Cys437, we assessed the ability of IRP1-wt and the cysteine-to-serine mutant IRP1-S437 to bind IRE after exposure to SIN-1. As expected from previous data (15Hirling H. Henderson B.R. Kühn L.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), human recombinant IRP1-wt fusion protein expressed in E. coli was spontaneouly active as aconitase, which means that it contains an intact [4Fe-4S] cluster (52Haile D.J. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Kennedy M.C. Blondin G.A. Beinert H. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11735-11739Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). In turn, only 5–10% of the total protein bound IRE. It was therefore necessary to prepare an apo-IRP1-wt prior to exposure to increasing a"
https://openalex.org/W2038202699,"The post-translational processing of prothyrotropin-releasing hormone (pro-TRH25–255) has been extensively studied in our laboratory, and the processing pathway to mature TRH has been elucidated. We have also demonstrated that recombinant PC1 and PC2 process partially purified pro-TRH to cryptic peptides in vitro and that pro-TRH and PC1 mRNAs are coexpressed in primary cultures of hypothalamic neurons. To further define the role of each convertase, and particularly PC1 and PC2, in pro-TRH processing, recombinant vaccinia viruses were used to coexpress the prohormone convertases PC1, PC2, PACE4, PC5-B, furin, or control dynorphin together with rat prepro-TRH in constitutively secreting LoVo cells or in the regulated endocrine GH4C1 cell line.Radioimmunoassays from LoVo-derived secreted products indicated that furin cleaves the precursor to generate both N- and C-terminal intermediates. PC1, PC2, and PACE4 only produced N-terminal intermediates, but less efficiently than furin. In GH4C1 cells, PC1, PC2, furin, PC5-B, and PACE4 produced both N-terminal and C-terminal forms. Significantly, TRH-Gly and TRH were mostly produced by PC1, PC2, and furin. Utilizing gel electrophoresis to further analyze the cleavage specificities of PC1 and PC2, we found that PC1 seems primarily responsible for cleavage to both intermediates and mature TRH, since it generated all products at significantly higher levels than PC2. The addition of 7B2 to the coinfection did not augment the ability of PC2 to cleave pro-TRH to either N- or C-terminal forms. The post-translational processing of prothyrotropin-releasing hormone (pro-TRH25–255) has been extensively studied in our laboratory, and the processing pathway to mature TRH has been elucidated. We have also demonstrated that recombinant PC1 and PC2 process partially purified pro-TRH to cryptic peptides in vitro and that pro-TRH and PC1 mRNAs are coexpressed in primary cultures of hypothalamic neurons. To further define the role of each convertase, and particularly PC1 and PC2, in pro-TRH processing, recombinant vaccinia viruses were used to coexpress the prohormone convertases PC1, PC2, PACE4, PC5-B, furin, or control dynorphin together with rat prepro-TRH in constitutively secreting LoVo cells or in the regulated endocrine GH4C1 cell line. Radioimmunoassays from LoVo-derived secreted products indicated that furin cleaves the precursor to generate both N- and C-terminal intermediates. PC1, PC2, and PACE4 only produced N-terminal intermediates, but less efficiently than furin. In GH4C1 cells, PC1, PC2, furin, PC5-B, and PACE4 produced both N-terminal and C-terminal forms. Significantly, TRH-Gly and TRH were mostly produced by PC1, PC2, and furin. Utilizing gel electrophoresis to further analyze the cleavage specificities of PC1 and PC2, we found that PC1 seems primarily responsible for cleavage to both intermediates and mature TRH, since it generated all products at significantly higher levels than PC2. The addition of 7B2 to the coinfection did not augment the ability of PC2 to cleave pro-TRH to either N- or C-terminal forms. Many neuropeptides are first synthesized as large prohormones, precursors that must be post-translationally proteolyzed to elaborate smaller bioactive peptides. This processing occurs through limited endoproteolytic cleavage at paired basic residues, either Lys-Arg or Arg-Arg, with cleavage at monobasic sites occurring less frequently (1Seidah N.G. Chretien M. Day R. Biochimie. 1994; 76: 197-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar,2Hook V. Azaryan A. Hwong S. Tezapsidis N. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1269-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Through such post-translational processing, prothyrotropin-releasing hormone (pro-TRH) 1The abbreviations used are: TRH, thyrotropin-releasing hormone; VV, vaccinia virus; RIA, radioimmune assay; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; ACTH, adrenocorticotropic hormone; PAM, peptidyl glycine α-amidating monooxygenase. 1The abbreviations used are: TRH, thyrotropin-releasing hormone; VV, vaccinia virus; RIA, radioimmune assay; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; ACTH, adrenocorticotropic hormone; PAM, peptidyl glycine α-amidating monooxygenase. is cleaved to mature TRH. Mature TRH is a modified 3-amino acid neuropeptide (pyroglutamate-histidine-proline-amide) that stimulates the synthesis and release of thyrotropin, prolactin, and growth hormone from the mammalian pituitary (3Jackson I.M.D. Imura H.

Nature. 1974; 252: 310-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In the rat, mature TRH is derived from a 231-amino acid prohormone, which contains five TRH progenitor sequences (Gln-His-Pro-Gly) (7Nillni E.A. Sevarino K.A. Jackson I.M.D. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 1260-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 8Sevarino K.A. Goodman R.H. Spiess J. Jackson I.M. Wu P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21529-21535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each one of these sequences is flanked by dibasic residues, and another dibasic residue exists that does not flank a TRH progenitor sequence (7Nillni E.A. Sevarino K.A. Jackson I.M.D. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 1260-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Cleavage at all dibasic residues yields five copies of the TRH progenitor and seven cryptic peptides (7Nillni E.A. Sevarino K.A. Jackson I.M.D. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 1260-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar,9Lechan R.M. Wu P. Jackson I.M.D. Wolfe H. Cooperman S. Mandel G. Goodman R.H. Science. 1986; 231: 159-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Mature TRH is achieved by exoproteolytic excision of the basic residues flanking the TRH progenitor by carboxypeptidase E, amidation of the carboxyl-terminal proline by peptidyl glycine α-amidating monooxygenase, and cyclization of the glutamine (10Eipper B.A. Stoffers D.A.

Much of the characterization of pro-TRH and its post-translational processing and sorting have been done using transfected AtT-20 cells, which yield high levels of prohormone expression (7Nillni E.A. Sevarino K.A. Jackson I.M.D. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 1260-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Using this system, pro-TRH was definitively established as a 26-kDa protein TRH precursor (7Nillni E.A. Sevarino K.A. Jackson I.M.D. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 1260-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The processing of this precursor has also been partially elucidated in these cells (7Nillni E.A. Sevarino K.A. Jackson I.M.D. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 1260-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 13Nillni E.A. Sevarino K.A. Jackson I.M.D. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 1271-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). There are two primary processing pathways, which yield different N- and C-terminal intermediate products. The two processing schemes yield identical end products, resultant from cleavage at all dibasic residues, but differ by the sites of initial cleavage of the 26-kDa precursor. If cleavage initially occurs at prepro-TRH Lys152-Arg153 or Arg158-Arg159, a 15-kDa N-terminal peptide (prepro-TRH25–151- or prepro-TRH25–156-amide) and a 10-kDa C-terminal peptide (prepro-TRH154–255 or prepro-TRH160–255) are formed. Further processing of the 15-kDa peptide results in the formation of a 6-kDa peptide (prepro-TRH25–74) and a 3.8-kDa peptide (prepro-TRH77–106); the 6-kDa peptide is then proteolyzed to a 4-kDa (prepro-TRH25–50) fragment and a 3-kDa (prepro-TRH53–74) peptides. Further processing of the 10-kDa fragment yields a 5.4-kDa peptide (prepro-TRH2O8–255). If cleavage initially occurs at Lys107-Arg108 or Arg113-Arg114, a 16.5-kDa C-terminal peptide is formed (prepro-TRH109–255 or prepro-TRH115–255) along with a 9.5-kDa N-terminal peptide (prepro-TRH25–106 or prepro-TRH25–111). The overall processing scheme is presented in Fig. 1, which delineates the further intermediates resultant from initial cleavage at prepro-TRH Lys107-Arg108 or Arg113-Arg114. Primary hypothalamic culture studies confirmed that this processing pathway is physiologically relevant (14Nillni E.A. Luo L.G. Jackson I.M.D. McMillan P. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5651-5661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our previous in vitro (15Nillni E.A. Friedman T.C. Todd R.B. Birch N.P. Loh Y.P. Jackson I.M.D. J.

The fact that PC1, PC2, and pro-TRH are endogenous constituents in rat hypothalamic neuronal cells suggested the involvement of these endopeptidases in pro-TRH processing (14Nillni E.A. Luo L.G. Jackson I.M.D. McMillan P. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5651-5661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The strongest evidence implicating PC1 in the processing of pro-TRH is derived from our recent studies showing the coexpression of pro-TRH and PC1 by double in situ hybridization in rat hypothalamic neurons (14Nillni E.A. Luo L.G. Jackson I.M.D. McMillan P. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5651-5661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Statistical counting of more than 100 fields suggested that more than 50% of the neurons coexpressed TRH and PC1, and all TRH-positive cells also expressed PC1. Interestingly, we did not find any single cell expressing only TRH mRNA. Recombinant PC1 isolated from transfected fibroblast cells was found to be capable of cleaving pro-TRH to a number of predicted processing intermediates (15Nillni E.A. Friedman T.C. Todd R.B. Birch N.P. Loh Y.P. Jackson I.M.D. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 2462-2472Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, the difference in the percentage of N- and C-terminal intermediate products formed suggests a differential sensitivity to PC1 processing during this sequential cleavage (15Nillni E.A. Friedman T.C. Todd R.B. Birch N.P. Loh Y.P. Jackson I.M.D. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 2462-2472Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The processing capabilities of PC1 and PC2 on pro-TRH have also been examined using a bovine intermediate lobe secretory vesicle membrane preparation (16Friedman T.C. Loh Y.P. Huang S.S. Jackson I.M.D. Nillni E.A. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4462-4472Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Importantly, full processing to TRH, TRH-Gly, and TRH-Gly-Lys was undetectable in both of these studies, indicating that under these in vitro conditions, PC1 and PC2 alone were not able to fully process pro-TRH to TRH (15Nillni E.A.

Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4462-4472Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This is expected, since the antisera used only recognize TRH cyclized forms (pGlu), which would not form in these in vitro conditions. To investigate the ability of PC1, PC2, and the other PC enzymes (PC5-B, PACE4, and furin) to cleave pro-TRH, we performed coinfection studies using recombinant vaccinia virus vectors. By coexpressing both a given PC enzyme and pro-TRH in cell lines containing regulated and constitutive secretory pathways or solely a constitutive secretory pathway, differences in cleavage can be evaluated and compared. This system has been successfully utilized to study the ability of PC1 and PC2 to cleave pro-opiomelanocortin (41Benjannet S. Rondeau N. Day R. Chretien M. Seidah N.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In this study, vaccinia virus recombinants expressing PC enzymes (VV:PCs) were coinfected with a VV:prepro-TRH into GH4C1 and LoVo cells. The regulated cell line, GH4C1, was chosen because of the endogenous absence of PC1 and PC2 (1Seidah N.G. Chretien M. Day R.

Both GH4C1 and the constitutively secreting LoVo cell line (which is deficient of furin activity) have been well characterized for use with the vaccinia virus coinfection system (38Breslin M.B.

We also show cleavage profiles for PC1 and PC2 and examine more grossly the capabilities of the other PC enzymes to cleave pro-TRH. The evidence presented here suggests that PC1 is primarily responsible for pro-TRH cleavage in GH4C1 cells and that PC2 plays an as yet undefined subsidiary role. Finally, to further support the role of PC1 and PC2 in the processing of pro-TRH, protein colocalization of pro-TRH and PC1 or PC2 were performed using our well defined primary cultures of hypothalamic neurons. The coinfections of either GH4C1 or LoVo cells (50 × 106cells) with a recombinant vaccinia virus of each convertase or a combination thereof (VV:mPC1, VV:mPC2, VV:hfurin, VV:hPACE4, and VV:mPC5-B) and prepro-TRH were performed at one plaque-forming unit/cell as previously reported (40Brakch N.

Galanopoulou A.S. Patel Y.C. Boileau G. Seidah N.G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 143-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 43Hoflehner J. Eder U. Laslop A. Seidah N.G. Fischer R. Winkler H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Cell media were collected, lyophilized, washed, resuspended, and analyzed using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and radioimmune assay (RIA). Cell content was not utilized, since preliminary results indicated that most of the peptides were contained in the media fraction. Cell media were analyzed using the Protean 16-cm cell apparatus (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Richmond, CA), a 1.5-mm thick polyacrylamide gel-Tricine-SDS system. Prestained molecular mass markers were used as follows: 106, 80.0, 49.5, 32.5, 27.5, and 18.5 kDa from Bio-Rad; 29, 20.4, 14.4, 6.5, and 2.8 kDa from Diversified Biotech (Newton, MA). After electrophoresis, gels were cut into 2-mm slices in a gel slicer (Hoeffer Scientific Instruments, San Francisco, CA). Each slice was placed in 2n acetic acid for protein extraction prior to RIA and incubated for 4 days, and the gel slices were removed. An almost 90% recovery of peptides from the gel slices has been demonstrated by using RIA before and after gel electrophoresis (7Nillni E.A. Sevarino K.A. Jackson I.M.D. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 1260-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The following antibodies were used in the RIAs: anti-pCC10, recognizing prepro-TRH25–255 (26 kDa), prepro-TRH25–151 (15 kDa), prepro-TRH25–112 (9 kDa), and prepro-TRH25–74(6 kDa); anti-pYE17, recognizing prepro-TRH25–255 (26 kDa), prepro-TRH115–255(16.5 kDa), prepro-TRH160–255 (10 kDa), and prepro-TRH208–255 (5.4 kDa); anti-pYE27, recognizing prepro-TRH25–113 (9.5 kDa) and prepro-TRH25–50 (4 kDa); and anti-pEH24, recognizing prepro-TRH82–113 (3.8 kDa) and prepro-TRH82–107 (2.8 kDa).

Neurochem. 1995; 65: 2462-2472Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) were performed as standard in our laboratory, as described elsewhere. All RIAs were performed on the same volume of material in duplicate. Cultures were undertaken as described previously (14Nillni E.A. Luo L.G. Jackson I.M.D. McMillan P. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5651-5661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, diencephalic tissue was dissociated to single cells by neutral protease digestion (1 unit/tissue; Sigma). The cells were cultured for up to 14 days on four-chamber glass LabTek (Nunc Inc., Naperville, IL) slides (106 cells/ml) with L-15-Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (14Nillni E.A. Luo L.G. Jackson I.M.D. McMillan P. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5651-5661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Prior to plating, all wells were coated with poly-d-lysine (20 μg/ml, Sigma). To induce differentiation of neuronal cells and pro-TRH biosynthesis, the cells were cultured with 50 μm BrdU during the first 4 days as described previously (14Nillni E.A. Luo L.G. Jackson I.M.D. McMillan P. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5651-5661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hypothalamic neurons (3 × 105) from 14-day-old cultures were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline as described previously (14Nillni E.A. Luo L.G. Jackson I.M.D. McMillan P. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5651-5661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After fixation, three washes with PIPES/sucrose buffer (0.1 m PIPES, pH 6.8, 0.12 m sucrose), the cells were incubated in 0.2% Triton X-100 in the same buffer. After blocking with 5% albumin, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1 mNH4Cl and 1% normal goat serum. Immunoreaction with primary antibody was performed at 4 °C for 24 h. Goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate was used as the fluorescence marker. A wide range of dilutions for the primary and secondary antibodies was tested. The optimal dilutions were found to be 1:1,500 for the primary antibody and 1:2,000 for the secondary, with an incubation time of 24 h at 4 °C for the primary antibody and 2 h at room temperature for the secondary antibody. Control experiments, including the incubation of cells without primary antibody or preimmune sera and the blocking of the primary antibody with the synthetic cryptic peptide for which the antibody was generated, were performed and did not show any positive staining. For the pro-TRH antibodies, Texas Red-X-succinimidylester was directly conjugated to affinity-purified anti-pAV37antibodies as instructed by the manufacturer for conjugation of immunoglobulins with amine-reactive probes (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR) with the following modifications; binding reaction of Texas Red with antibody was performed for 1 h at room temperature, and the separation of the conjugate from unreacted labeling reagent was performed by Centricon 30 filtration instead of gel filtration chromatography. Multiple RIAs directed against different epitopes of pro-TRH were performed on fractions derived from infected GH4C1 and LoVo cells. The cleavage pattern of pro-TRH processing achieved by each PC enzyme was thereby evaluated. In Fig. 1, the structure of pro-TRH and the different intermediates and cryptic peptides are presented, as determined from previous studies (7Nillni E.A. Se"
https://openalex.org/W2140549895,"The regulation of the high affinity cationic amino acid transporter Cat-1 in Fao rat hepatoma cells by amino acid availability has been studied. Cat-1 mRNA level increased (3-fold) in 4 h in response to amino acid starvation and remained high for at least 24 h. This induction was independent of the presence of serum in the media and transcription and protein synthesis were required for induction to occur. When Fao cells were shifted from amino acid-depleted media to amino acid-fed media, the levels of the induced cat-1 mRNA returned to the basal level. In amino acid-fed cells, accumulation of cat-1mRNA was dependent on protein synthesis, indicating that a labile protein is required to sustain cat-1 mRNA level. No change in the transcription rate of the cat-1 gene during amino acid starvation was observed, indicating thatcat-1 is regulated at a post-transcriptional step. System y+ mediated transport of arginine was reduced by 50% in 1 h and by 70% in 24 h after amino acid starvation. However, when 24-h amino acid-starved Fao cells were preloaded with 2 mmlysine or arginine for 1 h prior to the transport assays, arginine uptake was trans-stimulated by 5-fold. This stimulation was specific for cationic amino acids, since alanine, proline, or leucine had no effect. These data lead to the hypothesis that amino acid starvation results in an increased cat-1 mRNA level to support synthesis of additional Cat-1 protein. The following lines of evidence support the hypothesis: (i) the use of inhibitors of protein synthesis in starved cells inhibits the trans-zero transport of arginine; (ii) cells starved for 1–24 h exhibited an increase of trans-stimulated arginine transport activity for the first 6 h and had no loss of activity at 24 h, suggesting that constant replenishment of the transporter protein occurs; (iii) immunofluorescent staining of 24-h fed and starved cells for cat-1 showed similar cell surface distribution; (iv) new protein synthesis is not required for trans-stimulation of arginine transport upon refeeding of 24-h starved cells. We conclude that the increased level of cat-1 mRNA in response to amino acid starvation support the synthesis of Cat-1 protein during starvation and increased amino acid transport upon substrate presentation. Therefore, the cat-1 mRNA content is regulated by a derepression/repression mechanism in response to amino acid availability. We propose that the amino acid-signal transduction pathway consists of a series of steps which include the post-transcriptional regulation of amino acid transporter genes.

We propose that the amino acid-signal transduction pathway consists of a series of steps which include the post-transcriptional regulation of amino acid transporter genes. The signal(s) that initiate the molecular response to amino acid starvation and the mechanism of selectively increasing gene expression in mammalian cells are not known. Unlike mammalian cells, bacterial and yeast cells have the ability to compensate for the effects of amino acid starvation by inducing enzymes that promote de novoamino acid biosynthesis (1Hinnebusch A.G.

Jackson B.M. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 486-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In yeast, a specific protein (GCN4) compensates for amino acid starvation by activating the transcription of a group of genes encoding enzymes involved in amino acid biosynthesis (2Hope I.A. Struhl K. Cell. 1985; 43: 177-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). When yeast cells are grown in nutritionally complete medium the rate of translation of GCN4 is extremely low, but its translation is specifically enhanced in response to amino acid starvation. It has been suggested (4Kilberg M.S. Hutson R.G. Laine R.O. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) that mammalian cells have a similar general control mechanism in response to amino acid starvation for genes which are involved in different aspects of amino acid metabolism (4Kilberg M.S.

Hayden J.M. Straus D.S. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 538-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). However, there are very few studies of genes in which their synthesis is regulated by amino acid availability (9Marten N.W. Burke E.J. Hayden J.M. Straus D.S. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 538-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Positive and negative effects of amino acid limitation on mRNA levels of specific genes have been reported (9Marten N.W. Burke E.J. Hayden J.M. Straus D.S. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 538-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar).

Kilberg M.S. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 745-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In the case of albumin, it has been suggested that the decreased protein and mRNA levels are mainly due to reduced mRNA stability (9Marten N.W. Burke E.J. Hayden J.M. Straus D.S. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 538-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). For asparagine synthase, amino acid starvation increases the mRNA level, and this increase depends on de novo protein synthesis (4Kilberg M.S. Hutson R.G. Laine R.O. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 5Laine R.O. Hutson R.H. Kilberg M.S. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol.

Kilberg M.S. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 745-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).In conditions of decreased amino acid availability, it is expected that there will be a coordinate increase in catabolism of cellular proteins, amino acid biosynthesis, and amino acid transport across the plasma membrane to provide cells with sufficient amino acids for cell survival. Regulation of amino acid transport by amino acid availability has been described for System A. System A-mediated transport of neutral amino acids is induced by amino acid starvation (18Kilberg M.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 2: 183-186Google Scholar) and this induction is sensitive to actinomycin D and cycloheximide. These studies support the concept of regulation of amino acid transport at a molecular level. Given that the gene for System A-mediated amino acid transporter has not been cloned, direct studies at a molecular level are not possible.Transport of cationic amino acids into most mammalian cells is mainly mediated through System y+. Three related proteins encoding y+-like activity have been isolated (Cat-1, Cat-2, and Cat-2a) (19Kakuda D.K. Finley K.D. Dionne V.E. MacLeod C.L. Transgene. 1993; 1: 91-101Google Scholar, 20Closs E.I. Lyons C.R. Kelly C. Cunningham J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20796-20800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All three proteins function as transporters for the cationic amino acids arginine, lysine, and ornithine, but they differ in their affinity for substrate. Cat-1 and Cat-2 have a 10-fold higher affinity than Cat-2a (19Kakuda D.K. Finley K.D. Dionne V.E. MacLeod C.L. Transgene. 1993; 1: 91-101Google Scholar, 20Closs E.I. Lyons C.R. Kelly C. Cunningham J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20796-20800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The biological significance of having multiple transporters for cationic amino acids in mammalian cells is not known. However, it has been suggested that these genes may be expressed and regulated in a cell-specific manner, thus facilitating amino acid transport in and out of mammalian cells in response to specific nutritional needs within a particular tissue (21Malandro M.S. Kilberg M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 305-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In this regard, the family of amino acid transporters for cationic substrates resembles the family of Na+-independent glucose transporters (22Kakuda D.K. MacLeod C.L. J. Exp. Biol. 1994; 196: 93-108PubMed Google Scholar).No molecular studies regarding adaptive regulation of System y+ to amino acid starvation have been published. Studies of amino acid deprivation in entire animals are not feasible, mainly because of the dramatic changes that occur in the circulating hormones, which regulate the expression of a variety of genes. Therefore, the use of in vitro systems is initially required to identify the regulatory signals for amino acid-dependent gene expression. As shown in this report, Fao cells are ideal to study the adaptive regulation of Cat-1-mediated transport because they do not express the Cat-2 and Cat-2a transporters. Here, we show that the regulation of thecat-1 gene in rat hepatoma Fao cells is responsive to amino acid deprivation and re-exposure to individual amino acids. The signal(s) that initiate the molecular response to amino acid starvation and the mechanism of selectively increasing gene expression in mammalian cells are not known. Unlike mammalian cells, bacterial and yeast cells have the ability to compensate for the effects of amino acid starvation by inducing enzymes that promote de novoamino acid biosynthesis (1Hinnebusch A.G.

In mammals, dietary protein deficiency results in decreased levels of serum proteins including albumin (8Hutson R.G. Kilberg M.S. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 745-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In the case of albumin, it has been suggested that the decreased protein and mRNA levels are mainly due to reduced mRNA stability (9Marten N.W. Burke E.J. Hayden J.M. Straus D.S. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 538-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). For asparagine synthase, amino acid starvation increases the mRNA level, and this increase depends on de novo protein synthesis (4Kilberg M.S. Hutson R.G. Laine R.O.

In conditions of decreased amino acid availability, it is expected that there will be a coordinate increase in catabolism of cellular proteins, amino acid biosynthesis, and amino acid transport across the plasma membrane to provide cells with sufficient amino acids for cell survival. Regulation of amino acid transport by amino acid availability has been described for System A. System A-mediated transport of neutral amino acids is induced by amino acid starvation (18Kilberg M.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 2: 183-186Google Scholar) and this induction is sensitive to actinomycin D and cycloheximide. These studies support the concept of regulation of amino acid transport at a molecular level. Given that the gene for System A-mediated amino acid transporter has not been cloned, direct studies at a molecular level are not possible. Transport of cationic amino acids into most mammalian cells is mainly mediated through System y+. Three related proteins encoding y+-like activity have been isolated (Cat-1, Cat-2, and Cat-2a) (19Kakuda D.K. Finley K.D. Dionne V.E. MacLeod C.L. Transgene. 1993; 1: 91-101Google Scholar, 20Closs E.I. Lyons C.R. Kelly C. Cunningham J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20796-20800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All three proteins function as transporters for the cationic amino acids arginine, lysine, and ornithine, but they differ in their affinity for substrate. Cat-1 and Cat-2 have a 10-fold higher affinity than Cat-2a (19Kakuda D.K. Finley K.D. Dionne V.E. MacLeod C.L. Transgene. 1993; 1: 91-101Google Scholar, 20Closs E.I. Lyons C.R. Kelly C. Cunningham J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20796-20800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The biological significance of having multiple transporters for cationic amino acids in mammalian cells is not known. However, it has been suggested that these genes may be expressed and regulated in a cell-specific manner, thus facilitating amino acid transport in and out of mammalian cells in response to specific nutritional needs within a particular tissue (21Malandro M.S. Kilberg M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 305-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In this regard, the family of amino acid transporters for cationic substrates resembles the family of Na+-independent glucose transporters (22Kakuda D.K. MacLeod C.L. J. Exp. Biol. 1994; 196: 93-108PubMed Google Scholar). No molecular studies regarding adaptive regulation of System y+ to amino acid starvation have been published. Studies of amino acid deprivation in entire animals are not feasible, mainly because of the dramatic changes that occur in the circulating hormones, which regulate the expression of a variety of genes. Therefore, the use of in vitro systems is initially required to identify the regulatory signals for amino acid-dependent gene expression. As shown in this report, Fao cells are ideal to study the adaptive regulation of Cat-1-mediated transport because they do not express the Cat-2 and Cat-2a transporters. Here, we show that the regulation of thecat-1 gene in rat hepatoma Fao cells is responsive to amino acid deprivation and re-exposure to individual amino acids.

Because the protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 binds tyrosyl phosphorylated FcγRIIB and FcγRIIB-mediated inhibition is defective in motheaten (me/me) mice, which do not express SHP-1, it was proposed that SHP-1 mediates FcγRIIB signaling in B cells (D'Ambrosio, D., Hippen, K.

However, SHP-1 is dispensable for FcγRIIB-mediated inhibition of FcεRI signaling in mast cells (Ono, M., Bolland, S., Tempst, P., and Ravetch, J. V.

Inhibition is reversed by preincubation with anti-FcγRIIB antibodies, indicating that it is mediated by FcγRIIB. The inositol 5′ phosphatase SHIP is recruited to tyrosyl-phosphorylated FcγRIIB in both cell lines. FcγRIIB-mediated CD19 dephosphorylation also occurs in the presence or the absence of SHP-1.

The sIgM antigen receptor (BCR) 1The abbreviations used are: BCR, sIgM B cell antigen receptor; PTP, protein-tyrosine phosphatase; ITIM, immune receptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif; PI-3K, phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase; sIg, surface immunoglobulin. 1The abbreviations used are: BCR, sIgM B cell antigen receptor; PTP, protein-tyrosine phosphatase; ITIM, immune receptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif; PI-3K, phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase; sIg, surface immunoglobulin. is a cell surface heteroligomeric structure consisting of a ligand binding component, surface immunoglobulin (sIg), and accessory signal transducing components, the Igα and Igβ chains. Activation of the BCR leads to B lymphocyte proliferation, differentiation, and antibody secretion. Upon BCR cross-linking, several protein-tyrosine kinases including Lyn, Fyn, Blk, Syk, and Btk become activated and cause the recruitment, tyrosine phosphorylation, and activation of secondary signaling molecules, including PI-3K, Shc, Gap, Vav, and phospholipase Cγ. BCR accessory components, such as CD19 and CD22, also become tyrosyl phosphorylated and recruit secondary signaling molecules, which either enhance or dampen the BCR signal. These initial events lead to Ras activation, PI3-K activation, phosphoinositide turnover, and an increase in intracellular free calcium (reviewed in Ref. 1Cambier J.C. Pleiman C.M. Clark M.R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 457-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). By co-ligating the BCR and the inhibitory Fc receptor, FcγRIIB, immune complexes activate a negative feedback mechanism that inhibits antibody production (reviewed in Refs. 2Doody G.M. Dempsey P.W. Fearon D.T. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 378-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar and 3Ravetch J.V. Cell. 1994; 78: 553-560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). FcγRIIB-mediated inhibition in B lymphocytes can be studied experimentally by comparing responses evoked by cross-linking the BCR with F(ab′)2anti-Mu, which engages the BCR alone, with those initiated with intact anti-Mu Ig, which co-ligates FcγRIIB and the BCR. Co-ligation results in inhibition of BCR-evoked inositol triphosphate production and extracellular calcium influx (4Diegel M.L. Rankin B.M. Bolen J.B. Dubois P.M. Kiener P.A. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Sustained calcium influx is required for multiple cellular processes, including proliferation and differentiation (reviewed in Refs. 6Clapham D.

Low concentrations of calcium ionophores override FcγRIIB-mediated inhibition of A20 B cell activation, indicating that inhibition of calcium influx is a (the) key mechanism by which antigen-mediated signals are aborted by FcγRIIB signals (4Diegel M.L. Rankin B.M. Bolen J.B. Dubois P.M. Kiener P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11409-11416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An analogous mechanism operates in mast cells, where co-engagement of FcγRIIB and FcεRI results in inhibition of FcεRI-generated responses (9Takai T. Ono M. Hikida M. Ohmori H. Ravetch J. Nature. 1996; 347: 346-349Crossref Scopus (722) Google Scholar, 10Dearon M. Malbec O. Latour S. Arock M. Fridman W.H. J. Clin.

Immunity. 1995; 3: 635-646Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). A single tyrosyl residue, situated within the 13-amino acid ITIM (immune receptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif) in the cytoplasmic domain of FcγRIIB, is required for FcγRIIB-mediated inhibition of BCR signaling (12Muta T. Kurosaki T. Misulovin Z. Sanchez M. Nussenzweig M.C. Ravetch J.V. Nature. 1994; 368: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). SHP-1, an SH2-domain containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP), binds to the tyrosyl-phosphorylated FcγRIIB ITIM motif both in vitro and in vivo (13D'Ambrosio D. Hippen K.L. Minskoff S.A. Mellman I. Pani G. Siminovitch K.A. Cambier J.C. Science. 1995; 268: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Because B cells from motheaten (me/me) and motheaten viable (me v /me v) mice, which have defective SHP-1 alleles, failed to demonstrate FcγRIIB-mediated inhibition, it was proposed that the FcγRIIB inhibitory signal is mediated by SHP-1 (13D'Ambrosio D. Hippen K.L. Minskoff S.A. Mellman I. Pani G. Siminovitch K.A. Cambier J.C. Science. 1995; 268: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 14Olcese L. Lang P. Vely F. Cambiaggi A. Marguet D. Blery M. Hippen K.L. Biassoni R. Moretta A. Moretta L. Cambier J.C. Vivier E. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4531-4534PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this model, a recent report demonstrated that CD19 is dephosphorylated upon co-cross-linking of FcγRIIB and the BCR, leading to decreased binding of the p85 subunit of PI-3K to CD19 (15Kiener P.A. Lioubin M.N. Rohrschneider L.R. Ledbetter J.A. Nadler S.G. Diegel M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3838-3844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This led to the proposal that SHP-1 regulates intracellular calcium levels by controlling CD19 tyrosyl phosphorylation, which in turn controls associated PI-3K activity (15Kiener P.A. Lioubin M.N. Rohrschneider L.R. Ledbetter J.A. Nadler S.G. Diegel M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3838-3844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Interestingly, me/me mice exhibit a plethora of immune system defects, including hypergammaglobulinemia and a high level of circulating immune complexes (reviewed in Ref. 16Tsui F.W.L. Tsui H.W. Immunol. Rev. 1994; 136: 185-206Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Conceivably, one or more of these disorders might be explained by defective FcγRIIB signaling. However, the role of SHP-1 in FcγRIIB-mediated inhibitory signaling has been a subject of controversy. Mice lacking FcγRIIB do not exhibit uncontrolled antibody production when challenged with antigen (9Takai T. Ono M. Hikida M. Ohmori H. Ravetch J. Nature. 1996; 347: 346-349Crossref Scopus (722) Google Scholar). Moreover, as revealed by studies of mast cells fromme/me mice, SHP-1 clearly is dispensable for FcγRIIB-mediated inhibition of FcεRI signaling (17Ono M. Bolland S. Tempst P. Ravetch J.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). Ono et al. have proposed that the inositol phosphatase SHIP (SH2 domain containing 5′-inositolphosphatase), which also binds to the FcγRIIB ITIM, is the key mediator of FcγRIIB signaling (17Ono M. Bolland S. Tempst P. Ravetch J.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). The situation is complicated further by a report that the other mammalian SH2-containing PTP, SHP-2, also binds to this ITIM, at least in vitro (14Olcese L. Lang P. Vely F. Cambiaggi A. Marguet D. Blery M. Hippen K.L. Biassoni R. Moretta A. Moretta L. Cambier J.C. Vivier E. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4531-4534PubMed Google Scholar). Although it is possible that FcγRIIB employs unique signaling mechanisms in different cell types, these findings have raised questions as to whether SHP-1 actually is required for FcγRIIB-mediated inhibition in B cells. To develop a model system for studying the role of SHP-1 in multiple B cell signaling pathways, we generated B cell lines fromme/me (ME) and normal (N) littermate mice by immortalization with the retrovirus J2 (18Rapp U.R.

N and ME cell lines express similar surface markers and respond to BCR stimulation and FcγRIIB/BCR co-ligation. We find that both cell lines exhibit comparably decreased calcium influx when FcγRIIB is co-cross-linked with the BCR. Consistent with previous reports, CD19 tyrosyl phosphorylation decreases upon co-cross-linking of FcγRIIB and the BCR in N cells. However, dephosphorylation also is observed in the ME line. Our results establish that SHP-1 is dispensable for both biochemical and biological responses to FcγRIIB engagement in B cells. J2 producer cells (20Cleveland J.L. Jansen H.W. Bister K.

Virus-containing supernatants were collected from J2 cells growing in log phase for 24 h in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 20% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 12 mm NaHC03, 100 IU/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mml-glutamine, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 12.5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Spleens from 12–14-day-oldme/me and normal littermate mice were removed and red blood cells were lysed with Tris-NH4Cl. Immortalization was carried out by incubating total splenocytes at a concentration of 7 × 106 cells/ml with medium containing J2 retrovirus. After 15–30 days, cells that had proliferated were expanded and analyzed for sIgM by flow cytometry. sIgM+ cells were subsequently cloned by limiting dilution, expanded, and maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented as described above, except that the fetal calf serum concentration was decreased to 10%. Cells were stained with the appropriate antibodies in the presence of fully supplemented RPMI. Antibodies used for staining included anti-IgM and anti-FcγRIIB (CD32/CD16; 2.4G2), obtained from Pharmingen. Flow cytometric data were obtained on a FACScan using Cell Quest acquisition and analytical software (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). N and ME cells were loaded with 2 μm (final concentration) Fura-2 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in a buffer containing 135 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5.6 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Cells were washed once and resuspended at 2 × 106 cells/ml. Assays were performed as described previously (21Jouvin M.-H.E. Adamczewski M. Numerof R. Letoureur O. Valle A. Kinet J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 269: 5918-5925Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) using a Delta Scan spectrofluorometer (Photon Technologies Inc., South Brunswick, NJ). Cells were activated with 5 μg/ml F(ab′)2 goat anti-mouse Mu or with 10 μg/ml rabbit anti-mouse Mu (Jackson ImmunoResearch) either with or without preincubation with anti-FcR (2.4G2) antibody. To monitor calcium influx, cells were activated with anti-Mu antibodies in the presence of 1.5 mm EGTA, followed by the addition of 5 mm CaCl2. The emission values at 510 nm following excitation at 340 or 380 nm were collected and analyzed using FELIX software (Photon Technologies). Analyses of data and generation of graphs were performed using Quattropro. N and ME cells were activated by incubation with 5–10 μg/ml F(ab′)2anti-Mu or with 10 μg/ml rabbit anti-mouse Mu (Jackson ImmunoResearch) at 37 °C. Activations were stopped by addition of lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm sodium chloride, 5 mm sodium flouride, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and the protease inhibitors leupeptin (10 μg/ml), aprotinin (10 μg/ml), pepstatin (1 μg/ml), antipain (1 μg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (10 μg/ml). Typically, 5 × 106 cells were activated per time point, and one-tenth of the resulting lysate was removed before immunoprecipitation and analyzed by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting. In some cases, activations were stopped by the addition of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and cell pellets were frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C prior to lysis. Lysates were immunoprecipitated for 1–3 h with the indicated antibodies, including anti-CD19 (Pharmingen), anti-FcγRIIB (CD32/CD16; Pharmingen), and anti-SHIP (a gift from Dr. Mark Coggeshall, Ohio State University). Anti-FcγRIIB antibodies were covalently cross-linked to protein G-agarose beads prior to use. Immunoprecipitates were collected onto either protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) or protein G-agarose (Oncogene Sciences) beads, washed three times with lysis buffer, separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon, Millipore). For anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting, membranes were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (Boehringer Mannheim) in TBST buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm sodium chloride, 0.1% Tween 20), followed by incubation with 1 μg/ml monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) and subsequent incubation with secondary antibodies (donkey anti-mouse) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Corp.). All other blots were blocked in 5% milk in TBST and were developed in a similar manner with the indicated antibodies. Antibodies used for immunoblotting included: anti-SHP-1 polyclonal antiserum (1:1000 dilution) (22Lorenz U. Ravichandran K.S. Pei D. Walsh C.T. Burakoff S.J. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell.

Immunoreactive proteins were detected by Enhanced Chemiluminescence (Amersham Corp.). For reprobing, polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were stripped of antibodies, according to the manufacturer's suggestions (Amersham Corp.). SHP-1 has been implicated as a negative regulator of antigen receptor (BCR) signaling in B cells and, in particular, in FcγRIIB signaling (13D'Ambrosio D. Hippen K.L. Minskoff S.A. Mellman I. Pani G.

Comparison of BCR signaling events in primary B cells from me/me mice is difficult because these cells are developmentally distinct and have reduced surface levels of sIgM and FcγRIIB compared with age-matched B cells from normal littermates (24Cyster J.G.

To circumvent such problems, we generated a set of immortalized B cell lines derived fromme/me and normal littermate mice, using the murine retrovirus J2, which expresses the viral oncogenes raf andmyc (19Morse H.C.I.

Unlike B cell lines produced by Abelson MuLV, which are arrested at the pro- or early pre-B cell stage and thus cannot signal through the BCR, many J2-derived lines are sIgM+, sIgD+, and retain BCR signaling capacity (8Chen Y.-W.

Southern analysis indicated that these lines are clonal (data not shown), and immunoblotting confirmed that the ME line lacks SHP-1 expression (Fig.1 B). Notably, however, the N and ME lines express equal levels of SHP-2 (Fig. 1 B). The surface phenotypes of the N and ME cell lines are similar; of particular importance for the results discussed below, they express comparable levels of sIgM and FcγRIIB (Fig. 1, C–F). Both lines also display similar levels of sIgD, CD45 (B220), CD19, and CD22 but do not express CD5, CD11b, B7.1 or B7.2 (data not shown). Therefore, their surface phenotype more closely resembles primary B cells, rather than B-1a, germinal center or memory B cells. Other properties of these cell lines will be discussed in more detail elsewhere. 3M. J. S. Nadler, B. G. Neel, and H. H. Wortis, manuscript in preparation.

The change in the ratio (chelated/free) of Fura-2 fluorescence was used to measure calcium responses to both stimuli. We first tested the N cell line to determine whether J2 immortalization interferes with BCR activation and/or FcγRIIB-mediated inhibition. N cells activated with F(ab′)2 anti-Mu (engagement of BCR alone) exhibited a robust increase in intracellular free calcium. This response was markedly diminished in N cells stimulated with intact anti-Mu (Fig.2 A). Preincubation with anti-FcγRIIB antibodies (2.4G2) abrogated the ability of intact anti-Mu to inhibit the calcium response in N cells (Fig. 2 B), indicating that inhibition occurred solely via engagement of FcγRIIB. N cells activated in the presence of EGTA showed little difference in peak calcium release from intracellular stores (Fig. 2 C). Readdition of CaCl2 after the release phase to allow measurement of calcium influx revealed strong inhibition by intact anti-Mu (Fig.2 C). These results, which are consistent with those reported for primary B cells and several B cell lines (see Introduction), demonstrate that when engaged, FcγRIIB inhibits BCR signaling in the N cell line by preventing calcium influx. Importantly, the cross-linking antibodies, although derived from different species, evoked identical peak levels of calcium release, indicating that they provide comparable activation stimuli (Fig. 2 C). Likewise, the calcium responses to F(ab′)2 and intact anti-Mu in the presence of anti-FcγRIIB (2.4G2) antibodies were virtually identical (Fig. 2, compare A with B). Recently, we have confirmed these results using F(ab′)2 and intact anti-Mu IgG from the same species (rabbit) as cross-linking reagents (data not shown). Taken together, these data show that J2-immortalized B cells provide a valid model to study BCR signal transduction and its regulation by FcγRIIB. To determine whether SHP-1 is required for negative regulation of calcium influx by FcγRIIB, we compared calcium responses in ME cells following ligation of the BCR with either F(ab′)2 or intact anti-Mu. Surprisingly, ME cells activated with intact anti-Mu also showed complete inhibition of the calcium response compared with those stimulated with F(ab′)2 anti-Mu (Fig. 2 D); again, inhibition was reversed by preincubation with anti-FcγRIIB antibodies (Fig. 2 E). As in N cells, there was little difference in peak calcium release from intracellular stores following ligation of ME cells with either antibody in the presence of EGTA, but extracellular calcium influx was markedly reduced with intact anti-Mu compared with F(ab′)2 anti-Mu (Fig. 2 F). As with N cells, we have recently confirmed these results using matched rabbit F(ab′)2 and intact anti-Mu IgG (data not shown). Because ME cells exhibit FcγRIIB-mediated inhibition of the BCR-induced calcium response, we conclude that, as in mast cells (17Ono M. Bolland S. Tempst P. Ravetch J.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar), SHP-1 isnot required for FcR-mediated inhibition of B cell signaling. Although SHP-1 is dispensable for FcγRIIB-mediated inhibition of BCR calcium influx, it remained possible that it influences FcγRIIB-evoked tyrosyl phosphorylation events. To address this issue, we first examined the tyrosyl phosphorylation of FcγRIIB itself. Previous studies established that tyrosyl phosphorylation of FcγRIIB occurs upon co-cross-linking to the BCR, but not when the BCR alone is engaged (12Muta T. Kurosaki T. Misulovin Z. Sanchez M. Nussenzweig M.C. Ravetch J.V. Nature. 1994; 368: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblots of FcγRIIB immunoprecipitates from N and ME cells activated by either F(ab′)2 or by intact anti-Mu ligation revealed FcγRIIB tyrosyl phosphorylation only upon co-cross-linking (Fig. 3 A,upper panel). FcγRIIB was not significantly tyrosyl phosphorylated either basally or upon F(ab′)2 anti-Mu stimulation in ME cells, indicating that loss of SHP-1 does not lead to aberrant FcγRIIB tyrosyl phosphorylation (Fig. 3 A,upper panel). To determine if absence of SHP-1 resulted in global differences in total cellular tyrosyl phosphorylation upon FcγRIIB/BCR co-cross-linking, we compared anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblots of total cell lysates from cells that were activated with either F(ab′)2 or intact anti-Mu. In N cells, each stimulus yielded a comparable overall total cellular tyrosyl phosphorylation response (Fig. 3 C), consistent with previous studies that reported no gross difference in total tyrosyl phosphorylation between intact versus F(ab′)2 anti-BCR stimulation (12Muta T. Kurosaki T. Misulovin Z. Sanchez M. Nussenzweig M.C. Ravetch J.V. Nature. 1994; 368: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Each stimulus also evoked comparable increases in total cellular phosphotyrosine in ME cells (Fig. 3 C). A detailed comparison of BCR signal transduction between N, ME, and ME cells reconstituted with wild type and mutant SHP-1 will be presented elsewhere.3 CD19 has been reported to display decreased tyrosyl phosphorylation upon FcγRIIB co-cross-linking with the BCR. It has been suggested that SHP-1 mediates the differential tyrosyl phosphorylation of this co-receptor (15Kiener P.A. Lioubin M.N. Rohrschneider L.R. Ledbetter J.A. Nadler S.G. Diegel M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3838-3844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To address these issues, we examined CD19 tyrosyl phosphorylation in both cell lines. In N cells, anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting of CD19 immunoprecipitates revealed that tyrosyl phosphorylation of CD19 is slightly decreased when the BCR is co-cross-linked with FcγRIIB (Fig. 3 D), consistent with the previous study (15Kiener P.A. Lioubin M.N. Rohrschneider L.R. Ledbetter J.A. Nadler S.G. Diegel M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3838-3844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, decreased CD19 tyrosyl phosphorylation also was observed when the BCR was co-cross-linked with FcγRIIB in ME cells (Fig. 3 D). These data suggest that SHP-1 is not solely responsible for CD19 dephosphorylation in response to FcγRIIB engagement. Our results clearly establish that SHP-1 is not required for FcγRIIB-mediated inhibition of BCR-induced calcium influx. These findings contrast with an earlier report, which suggested that SHP-1 is necessary for FcγRIIB-mediated inhibition in B cells (13D'Ambrosio D. Hippen K.L. Minskoff S.A. Mellman I. Pani G. Siminovitch K.A. Cambier J.C. Science. 1995; 268: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). The earlier study compared signaling in primary lymphocytes from normal andme/me orme v /me v mice. Primary B cells from me/me mice are developmentally distinct from those of their normal counterparts and are similar in phenotype to anergized B cells, exhibiting decreased levels of BCR and increased expression of activation markers (24Cyster J.G. Goodnow C.C. Immunity. 1995; 2: 1-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). The failure of the earlier workers to observe effects of FcγRIIB engagement on the proliferative responses of me/me B cells may reflect developmental differences caused by the lack of SHP-1, rather than the direct effect of absence of SHP-1 on signaling via FcγRIIB. Alternatively, the high levels of circulating immune complexes in me/me mice may lead to desensitization of FcγRIIB signaling (althoughme/me B cells do retain surface FcγRIIB; data not shown). Our results also establish that SHP-1 is not required for the FcγRIIB-evoked decrease in CD19 tyrosyl phosphorylation. Presumably, because there has been no demonstrated change in any protein-tyrosine kinase activity upon FcγRIIB engagement (12Muta T. Kurosaki T. Misulovin Z. Sanchez M. Nussenzweig M.C. Ravetch J.V. Nature. 1994; 368: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar), a PTP other than SHP-1 promotes CD19 dephosphorylation. SHP-2 has been shown to bind the FcγRIIB ITIM in vitro (14Olcese L. Lang P. Vely F. Cambiaggi A. Marguet D. Blery M. Hippen K.L. Biassoni R. Moretta A. Moretta L. Cambier J.C. Vivier E. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4531-4534PubMed Google Scholar), raising the possibility that it may be responsible for CD19 dephosphorylation in vivo. In any case, the functional significance of CD19 dephosphorylation in response to FcγRIIB engagement remains unclear. As in mast cells (17Ono M. Bolland S. Tempst P. Ravetch J.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar) and other B cell lines and primary B cells, SHIP, an SH2-domain containing inositol phosphatase, associates with tyrosyl phosphorylated FcγRIIB and becomes tyrosyl phosphorylated in both N and ME cells (Figs. 3, A, lower panel, andB), raising the possibility that it mediates inhibitory signaling by this receptor. The mechanism by which an inositol phosphatase could promote inhibition of calcium influx is unclear. Hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and/or phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate could directly or indirectly modulate a calcium channel responsible for influx. Such a channel(s) remains to be identified in B cells. Dephosphorylation of CD19, with consequent diminished recruitment of PI-3K (15Kiener P.A. Lioubin M.N. Rohrschneider L.R. Ledbetter J.A. Nadler S.G. Diegel M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3838-3844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), might lead to similar effects on phosphatidylinositol-containing lipids, as recruitment of SHIP to FcγRIIB. Therefore, it remains possible that FcγRIIB may function by recruiting both SHIP and at least SHP-1 or SHP-2. However, it is important to note that we have been unable to detect stable association of SHP-2 with tyrosyl phosphorylated FcγRIIB in B cells (data not shown). Clarifying the roles of SHIP and SHP-2 in FcγRIIB signaling in B cells will most likely require generation of cell lines or mice that lack expression of these proteins. Dr. J. V. Ravetch's group also has shown that SHP-1 is dispensable for FcγRIIB-mediated inhibition of B cell antigen receptor signaling, using DT40 B cells lacking SHP-1 as a consequence of homologous recombination (Ono, M., Okada, H., Bolland, S., Yanagi, S., Kurosaki, T., and Ravetch, J.V. (1997) Cell, in press). In addition, Ono et al. show that SHP-1 is required for KIR-mediated inhibition.

https://openalex.org/W2091881371,"We report a novel mode of apoptosis induction observed in human leukemic HL-60 cells. These cells spontaneously underwent apoptosis in the course of proliferation when the cell density became higher than 1 × 106/ml. This occurred under ordinary in vitro culture conditions, with or without fetal calf serum. Even the low density cells were committed to undergo apoptosis if they were cultured under artificially concentrated conditions. Replacement of the culture supernatant of the low density cells by that of the high density ones resulted in apoptosis induction in the former cells. This apoptosis-inducing activity of the high density cell culture supernatant was completely eliminated by the action of trypsin but was fully restored following ultrafiltration by 3-kDa pore-sized membrane. A strong apoptosis-inducing activity was recovered from the culture supernatant of the high density HL-60 cells at a specific fraction in reverse-phase column chromatography. Neither an interleukin-β converting enzyme inhibitor nor CPP-32 inhibitor blocked the induction of cell density-dependent apoptosis in HL-60 cells, although overexpression of Bcl-2 protein markedly attenuated the induction of this mode. Surprisingly, transforming growth factor-β1 and activin A did not induce but, rather, inhibited the induction of cell density-dependent apoptosis. These data suggest that HL-60 cells release an unknown low molecular weight peptide-containing factor in response to an increase in cell density to induce apoptosis in an autocrine manner and that the interleukin-β converting enzyme-independent intracellular machinery for this mode of apoptosis is strongly affected by signaling events through the transforming growth factor-β1 receptor and by the action of Bcl-2 oncoprotein.

Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is an important biological process that is indispensable in normal development or differentiation, preservation of homeostasis, and liberation of hosts from viral attacks or spread of malignant cells (1Ellis R.E. Yuan J.Y. Horvitz H.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 663-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (1945) Google Scholar, 2Vaux D.L. Haeker G. Strasser A.

Apoptosis is observed under in vitro culture conditions as well as in vivo. According to previous reports on its induction in cultured cell lines, the modes of induction in vitro fall into three categories. First, a wide variety of noxious stimulations can bring on the condition. For example, addition of the anticancer drugs actinomycin D (4Martin S.J. Lennon S.V. Bonham A.M. Cotter T.G. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 1859-1867Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or etoposide (5Shimizu T. Kubota M. Tanizawa A. Sano H. Kasai Y. Hashimoto H. Akiyama Y. Mikawa H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 169: 1172-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and cytotoxic cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) 1The abbreviations used are: TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor α TGF-β1, transforming growth factor β1; HP, hematoregulatory peptides; ICE, interleukin-1β converting enzyme; R, receptor. (6Wright S.C. Kumar P. Tam A.W. Shen N. Varma M. Larrick J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 48: 344-355Google Scholar) or transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) (7Bies J. Wolff L. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 501-504PubMed Google Scholar) to the culture media of hematopoietic cells results in apoptosis. The high osmotic pressure of the culture medium also induces apoptosis in epithelial cell lines (8Matthews C.C. Feldman E.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 166: 323-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In addition, heat shock stimulation (9Harmon B.V. Corder A.M. Collins R.J. Gobe G.C. Allen J. Allan D.J. Kerr J.F. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1990; 58: 845-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) and ultraviolet (10Gunn A. Scrimgrour D. Potts R.C. Mackenzie L.A. Brown R.A. Beck J.S. Immunology. 1983; 50: 477-485PubMed Google Scholar) or gamma ray irradiation (11Ohyama H. Yamada T. Ohkawa A. Watanabe I. Radiat. Res. 1985; 101: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) induce apoptosis in some cases. Second, the absence of cytoprotective signals results in apoptosis in particular cases. For example, rat pheochromocytoma-derived PC-12 cells undergo apoptosis after the deprivation of nerve growth factor from the culture medium (12Pittman R.N. Wang S. DiBenedetto A.J. Millis J.C. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1669-1680Crossref Google Scholar), and the murine pro-B cell derived Ba/F3 cells do so after the deprivation of interleukin-3 (13Kinoshita T. Yokota T. Arai K. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 266-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Finally, apoptosis is occasionally observed following the differentiation of cells. For example, all-trans-retinoic acid-treated human leukemic HL-60 cells are reported to undergo apoptosis after having been differentiated to granulocytic lineage (14Nagy L. Thomázy V.A. Shipley G.L. Fésüs L. Lamph W. Heyman R.A. Chandraratna R.A.S. Davies P.J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3540-3551Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In all these situations, however, certain positive or negative environmental changes are required to induce apoptosis. It is not yet clear whether exogenous forces which change the cellular environment are always required, and to address this question, we investigated whether the increase of cell density, which is an internal stress, could possibly trigger apoptosis. We cultured human leukemic HL-60 cells under ordinary in vitro culture conditions and examined apoptosis induction over a period of time. In this paper, we show that these cells spontaneously undergo apoptosis in the course of their proliferation without any external stress. We also show evidence to prove that this spontaneous apoptosis is triggered by an increase in cell density per se, which is a novel mode of induction. Finally, we show that the cell density-dependent apoptosis is mediated by an unknown soluble factor, present in the conditioned medium of these cells themselves. Our work describes a novel mechanism of cell auto-regulation: self-induced apoptosis in an inappropriately crowded condition. HL-60 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies Inc.) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (JRH Bioscience, Lenexa, KS). Cells were passaged every 2 days at an initial concentration of 6.5 × 104/ml. A bcl-2overexpressing derivative line of HL-60 was the kind gift of Prof. S. Kitagawa and Dr. Y. Furukawa (15Terui Y. Furukawa Y. Sakoe K. Ohta M. Saito M. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1995; 117: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and was maintained in 200 μg/ml geneticin (Sigma). Recombinant human TGF-β1 and activin A were generously provided by Kirin Brewery Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan) and Ajinomoto Company Inc. (Kawasaki, Japan), respectively. Recombinant human TNF-α was purchased from Pepro Tech EC, Ltd. (London, UK). The interleukin-1β converting enzyme (ICE) inhibitor II (Bachem Feinchemikalien AG, Bubendorf, Switzerland) and CPP-32 inhibitor (Peptide Institute Inc., Osaka, Japan) were dissolved in Me2SO and kept at −20 °C until use. Small molecular weight chromosomal DNA from the nucleus and also cytoplasm was prepared by Hirt's method as originally described (16Hirt B. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 26: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (3351) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3 × 106 cells were lysed with 350 μl of lysis buffer containing 0.6% SDS and 0.1% EDTA (pH 8.0), and after 10 min incubation at room temperature, 21 μl of 5 m NaCl was added. This was mixed gently and incubated at 4 °C for more than 8 h. It was then centrifuged at 15,000 rpm (MRX-150, Tomy Seiko Co., LTD., Tokyo, Japan) at 4 °C for 20 min, and the supernatant was further incubated with 1 mg/ml heat-inactivated RNase A (Sigma) at 45 °C for 90 min and with 200 μg/ml proteinase K (Boehringer Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany) for another 60 min. After phenol extraction, phenol/chloroform extraction, and ethanol precipitation, one-third of the DNA sample was applied on 2% agarose gel, separated by horizontal electrophoresis, and visualized by staining with ethidium bromide (500 ng/ml). Marker 4 (WAKO Chemicals Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan) was used for the evaluation of the molecular weights of the fragmented DNA. In some experiments, cytoplasmic DNA was used to evaluate apoptosis. 3 × 106 cells were lysed with 350 μl of lysis buffer (5 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mm EDTA), then centrifuged at 15,000 rpm at room temperature for 20 min, and the supernatant was treated with RNase A and proteinase K as described above. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed on slide glasses using a cytospin apparatus (Cytospin2, Shandon, Pittsburgh, PA). After being dried in air and fixed with a mixture of acetone/methanol (3:1) for 5 min at room temperature, the samples were incubated with 4 μg/ml H33342 (Calbiochem) for 10 min at room temperature. The chromatin structures of the cells were examined by fluorescence light microscopy. HL-60 cells were seeded at an initial density of 1 × 105/ml in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. After 24 h of incubation at 37 °C, the cells were washed and resuspended with serum-free RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5 μg/ml bovine pancreas insulin (Sigma) and 5 μg/ml human holo-transferrin (Sigma). Following another 72 h incubation at 37 °C, the supernatant was collected and stored at −80 °C until use. Type III trypsin from bovine pancreas (Sigma) was suspended in 50 mm Tris at pH 8.8 (i.e. 5% trypsin solution). We added 120 μl of this solution to 3 ml of conditioned medium of HL-60 cells, incubated it for 30 min at 37 °C, and then used it for the assay. For inoculation of trypsin, this was ultrafiltrated by a 3-kDa pore-sized membrane (Millipore Co., Bedford, MA) or boiled at 100 °C for 5 min. Twenty-five ml of the conditioned medium of HL-60 cells was diluted four times with 10 mmTris (pH 7.5). This diluted conditioned medium was then applied to a 20-ml column (Econopack column, Bio-Rad) packed with 5 ml of CM-Sepharose (Sigma), which had previously been equilibrated with 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5). After the column was washed with 15 ml of 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), the sample was eluted with 10 ml of elution buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 7.5) with 150 mmNaCl). Seven ml of this elution was then applied to a reverse-phased column (Pro-RPC, Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). The elution was performed using a gradient mixture of water and acetonitrile, both of which were supplemented with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The elution pattern was monitored by checking the absorbance value of the ultraviolet wave (at a wavelength of 215 nm). There appeared an increasing number of dead cells among the in vitro cultured HL-60 cells with the passage of time. In the initial experiment, we performed DNA fragmentation assay and morphological examination to determine whether they died by apoptosis. Fig. 1 A is the growth curve of HL-60 cells. They exponentially grew as long as their density was less than 8 × 105/ml, and no sign of apoptosis was detected in the DNA fragmentation assay (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1 and 2) or the morphological examination (Fig. 1 C, upper). However, apoptotic cells appeared when the cell density exceeded 1 × 106/ml (Fig. 1 C, lower), in which internucleosomal DNA fragmentation was actually detected (Fig.1 B, lanes 3 and 4). Similar results were obtained when HL-60 cells were cultured in a serum-free condition and supplemented with insulin and transferrin (data not shown). These results indicate that HL-60 cells undergo apoptosis without known apoptotic stimuli during in vitro culture. To identify the mechanisms of spontaneous apoptosis in HL-60 cells, we investigated whether the increase of cell density per se could possibly be a trigger for the apoptosis induction. The culture supernatant of the growing phased cells (4 × 105/ml) was partially removed so that the cells were in a 4 fold-concentrated condition (i.e.1.6 × 106/ml). After 30 min incubation at 37 °C they were diluted with fresh medium to the original concentration (i.e. 4 × 105/ml), and after another 10 h incubation, DNA fragmentation assay was performed. For controls, cells that were cultured without having been concentrated were used. As shown in Fig. 2, the cells that had been cultured in a concentrated condition showed DNA fragmentation, whereas control cells did not show any fragmented DNA. This suggests that the apoptosis commitment was made within the 30 min that HL-60 cells were cultured in the artificially concentrated condition and that the “spontaneous apoptosis” was strictly dependent on the cell density of the culture. To learn whether the cell density-dependent apoptosis in HL-60 cells was mediated by a soluble factor, the culture supernatant of low density cells (4 × 105/ml) was replaced by that of high density cells (1.6 × 106/ml) in various proportions. After 10 h incubation at 37 °C, DNA fragmentation assay was performed. As shown in Fig. 3 A, addition of the high density cell culture supernatant induced DNA fragmentation in the low density cells in a dose-dependent manner. Similar results were obtained when this supernatant was prepared from cells maintained in a serum-free condition (data not shown). These results indicate that the high density cells culture supernatant has an ability to induce apoptosis in low density cells.Figure 1Growth and apoptosis induction in HL-60 cells. A, growth curve. HL-60 cells were seeded at an initial concentration of 6.5 × 104/ml and incubated at 37 °C for 25 h, at which time the cell density reached 3.5 × 105/ml (time = 0). After further incubation for indicated periods, the cell numbers were counted.B, DNA fragmentation assay. Small molecular weight DNA was extracted from the nucleus and cytoplasm of the cells when the cell density of HL-60 cells reached the indicated number. Timings of cell harvest are shown by arrows in A. The existence of the internucleosomal DNA fragmentation was examined by agarose gel electrophoresis (2% gel). C, morphology of the cells.

A, effect of the conditioned medium of naturally growing HL-60 cells. 10-ml culture of exponentially growing phased HL-60 cells (4 × 105/ml) was centrifuged, and the culture supernatant was partially replaced by that of the high density cells (1.6 × 106/ml) at the proportions indicated. After being resuspended with this mixture of supernatant, cells were incubated at 37 °C for 10 h, and DNA fragmentation assay was performed as in Fig. 1. B, effect of the conditioned medium of artificially concentrated HL-60 cells. The exponentially growing phased HL-60 cells (4 × 105/ml) were centrifuged, and the culture supernatant was partially removed and resuspended so that cells were concentrated to 1.6 × 106/ml. After 30 min (lane 2) or 6 h incubation (lane 3) at 37 °C, the culture supernatants were collected and their apoptosis-inducing activity was examined by adding them to the exponentially growing phased cells as in Fig. 2. As a control (lane 1), the exponentially growing responder cells were centrifuged and resuspended without replacing the supernatant.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether the culture supernatant of the artificially concentrated HL-60 cells also had an apoptosis inducing activity, the growing phased cells (6 × 105/ml) were incubated in a 3-fold concentrated condition (1.8 × 106/ml) by removing two-thirds of the culture supernatant. After incubation for 30 min or 6 h at 37 °C, the culture supernatants of these artificially concentrated cells were collected, and their apoptosis inducibility was assayed. The supernatant of the same growing phased cells that had been cultured without concentration was used as control. As shown in Fig. 3 B, addition of the artificially concentrated cells' culture supernatant caused apoptosis in the growing phased cells, suggesting that the artificially concentrated HL-60 cells release an inducer of apoptosis into the medium within a short period of cultivation in response to the high cell concentration. To characterize the soluble apoptosis-inducing activity in the conditioned medium of HL-60 cells, we studied the effect of trypsin treatment of the high density cell culture supernatant on the induction. The conditioned medium, which was prepared from HL-60 cells cultured in a serum-free condition, was treated with trypsin or buffer only, and the apoptosis-inducing activity was assayed. As shown in Fig.4, the trypsin-treated culture supernatant did not induce apoptosis at all in the exponentially growing phased cells. This finding indicates that the cell density-dependent apoptosis in HL-60 cells is mediated by a soluble factor that is sensitive to trypsin treatment. In examining the chemical or mechanical stability of this apoptosis-inducing activity, we found that it was completely resistant to mild (56 °C, 30 min) and severe heat treatment (100 °C, 5 min) and also to transient alkaline (pH 11) or acid (pH 3.5) treatment (data not shown). To further confirm the existence of certain apoptosis-inducing molecules in the culture supernatant, we partially purified this factor. The HL-60 cell conditioned medium was first semi-purified by anion exchange column chromatography. Twenty-five ml of the medium was diluted four times with salt-free buffer and applied to CM-Sepharose column, and stepwise elution was performed using buffer containing 150 mm, 500 mm, or 1000 mm NaCl. Because we found that the apoptosis-inducing activity was concentrated in the 150 mm NaCl-eluted fraction (data not shown), we applied this fraction to reverse-phased column chromatography, and gradient elution was performed using acetonitrile/water solution (Fig.5 A). Each eluted fraction, suspended in 1 ml of RPMI 1640 medium, was added to the exponentially growing HL-60 cells, and apoptosis-inducing activity was evaluated by DNA fragmentation assay as before. As shown in Fig. 5 B, relatively strong activities were detected in the fifth and also the sixth fraction. For a more quantitative evaluation, the number of dead cells was counted. As shown in Fig. 5 C, the strongest activity was detected in the sixth fraction. These results indicate that the cell density-dependent apoptosis in HL-60 cells is mediated by a specific soluble factor. To determine the rough molecular weight of this factor, the conditioned medium of HL-60 cells was ultrafiltrated through 3-, 5-, 10-, 30-, or 100-kDa pore-sized membrane, and the apoptosis-inducing activity of each flow-through fraction was evaluated by DNA fragmentation assay. As shown in Fig. 5 D, the material ultrafiltrated through 3-kDa pore-sized membrane had as strong an activity as the crude conditioned medium. Similar results were obtained when membranes of other pore sizes were used (data not shown). This finding suggests that the mediator of the cell density-dependent apoptosis is a relatively small molecule less than 3 kDa in molecular mass. Investigation of the effects of cytotoxic cytokines or growth inhibitory factors on the cell density-dependent apoptosis in HL-60 cells showed that TNF-α, which is known to induce apoptosis in human leukemic U937 cells (6Wright S.C. Kumar P. Tam A.W. Shen N. Varma M. Larrick J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 48: 344-355Google Scholar), did not induce apoptosis by itself and neither enhanced nor suppressed the cell density-dependent apoptosis in HL-60 cells (data not shown). We also found that TGF-β1 and activin A did not induce but, rather, strongly inhibited cell density-dependent apoptosis in HL-60 cells. As shown in Fig. 6 A, TGF-β1 did not exert any effect on the proliferation of the exponential growth of low density HL-60 cells. However, in its presence these cells showed apparent growth advantage as compared with those without TGF-β1 after cell density of the culture exceeded 1 × 106/ml, a critical point of cell density-dependent apoptosis of HL-60 cells; these cells with TGF-β1 finally reached the viable cell concentration of 2∼3 × 106/ml, which was never observed under an ordinary culture condition. These findings strongly suggest the inhibition of cell density-dependent apoptosis by TGF-β1, and in fact, potent inhibition of DNA ladder formation by this factor was clearly demonstrated in HL-60 cells at high cell density (Fig. 6 B). Similar results were obtained when HL-60 cells were cultured with activin A (Fig. 6, C andD), suggesting that this interesting and unexpected phenomenon is a common and specific action of a member of the TGF-β family of cytokines. These findings for TGF-β1 and activin A were further confirmed by morphological examination of the cells (Fig.6 E, data for activin A are not shown). The anti-apoptotic effect of TGF-β1 may be due either to HL-60 cells' decreased production of apoptosis-inducing factor or their acquisition of resistance to it. To address this question, HL-60 cells were cultured with or without TGF-β1, and the culture supernatant was prepared, ultrafiltrated through 3-kDa pore-sized membrane to deplete any residual TGF-β1, and added to the exponentially growing cells to evaluate the apoptosis-inducing activity. As shown in Fig.6 F, coexistence of TGF-β1 did not reduce the apoptosis inducibility of the conditioned medium, suggesting that TGF-β1-treated cells still release apoptosis inducer into the culture medium without being compelled to undergo apoptosis themselves. We also examined the effect of TGF-β1 on the apoptosis induced by exogenously added soluble inducer. As shown in Fig. 6 G, TGF-β1 almost completely abrogated DNA ladder formation in HL-60 cells cultured with conditioned media of high cell density culture. These findings clearly indicate that TGF-β1 inhibits cell density-dependent apoptosis not by simple reduction of the release of soluble apoptosis inducer but, rather, by interaction of its intracellular signaling pathways with those activated by high cell density and/or soluble inducer. To explore whether the overexpression of Bcl-2 protein could inhibit the induction of the cell density-dependent apoptosis in HL-60 cells, two derivative lines of these cells, in which the expression vector ofbcl-2 gene or neomycin-resistant gene was stably transfected (15Terui Y. Furukawa Y. Sakoe K. Ohta M. Saito M. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1995; 117: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), were cultured, and the DNA fragmentation assay was performed in accordance with the time course. Overexpression of Bcl-2 protein did not affect the growth rate of the cells (Fig.7 A); however, it markedly attenuated the induction of cell density-dependent apoptosis (Fig.7 B). The resistance to cell density-dependent apoptosis in Bcl-2 overexpressing HL-60 cells was due either to the decreased production of apoptosis-inducing factor or the decreased sensitivity to this factor. To address this question, conditioned media of Bcl-2 overexpressing and the control neomycin-resistant HL-60 cells were added to the exponentially growing parental HL-60 cells, and DNA fragmentation assays were performed as before. As shown in Fig.7 C, the conditioned media of both cell lines showed similar apoptosis-inducing activities, suggesting that the overexpression of Bcl-2 protein did not inhibit production of the inducer but blocked the intracellular signaling events that lead to the induction. Finally, to determine the possible involvement of ICE- or CPP-32-dependent pathways in cell density-dependent apoptosis, HL-60 cells were cultured with or without the inhibitor against ICE or CPP-32, and DNA fragmentation assay was performed at almost the confluence phase. Neither ICE nor CPP-32 inhibitor rescued but, rather, both slightly enhanced the induction of apoptosis (Fig. 8 A, lanes 2 and 3). Under the same conditions, both inhibitors potently suppressed the TNF-α-mediated apoptosis in U937 cells (Fig. 8 B). Thus, the cell density-dependent apoptosis in HL-60 cells may be mediated by ICE/CPP-32 independent pathways. We demonstrated that human myeloblastic HL-60 cells underwent apoptosis strictly dependent on the cell density during in vitro culture with or without fetal calf serum. The cell density-dependent apoptosis was, at least in part, mediated by a soluble factor, and the autocrine or paracrine mediator was found to be a low molecular weight peptide-containing molecule. In regard to the intracellular mechanisms of this novel mode of apoptosis, ICE-related pathways, ICE by itself and its downstream molecule of CPP-32, are not likely to be involved, but the Bcl-2-sensitive component would contribute to the intracellular signaling of cell density-dependent apoptosis. Interestingly, TGF-β family cytokines potently inhibited this novel mode of apoptosis in HL-60 cells. As shown, this apoptosis-inducing factor seems to be a small peptide whose molecular mass is less than 3 kDa. Our preliminary observation shows that the factor is even smaller than 1 kDa, which indicates that it may be composed of only 5 to 10 amino acids. There are various kinds of physiologically active oligopeptides, including hormones and neurotransmitters. Among these substances, a pentapeptide called hematoregulatory peptide (HP), which was isolated from the conditioned media of mature granulocytes as an inhibitor against the formation of myelopoietic colonies, was reported to inhibit the growth of HL-60 cells (reviewed by Paukovits et al. (17Sporn, M. B., and Roberts, A. B. (1990) Handb. Exp. Pharmacol., 95.Google Scholar)). We do not know whether HP can also induce apoptosis in HL-60 cells. However, it is not likely that this peptide would be the factor we are trying to isolate, because HP is reported to be completely resistant to the action of trypsin. Are any cytotoxic cytokines involved in the induction of the cell density-dependent apoptosis in HL-60 cells? It is reported that TNF-α induced apoptosis in these cells. However, we noted that a high concentration of TNF-α (100 ng/ml) induced only a weak smear-formed DNA breakdown with minimal ladder formation even after 2 days of incubation (data not shown); this would suggest that TNF receptor (TNFR)-mediated pathways may not be involved in the induction of cell density-dependent apoptosis in HL-60 cells. This speculation is further supported by our observation that this apoptosis was effectively blocked by the overexpression of Bcl-2 protein, because it is reported that Bcl-2-overexpressing HL-60 cells are sensitive to TNFR-mediated apoptosis (18Vanhaesebroeck B. Reed J.C. De Valck D. Grooten J. Miyashita T. Tanaka S. Beyaert R. Van Roy F. Fiers W. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1075-1081PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, the Fas-mediated pathways would also not be involved, since anti-Fas antibody did not cause any DNA breakdown at all (data not shown). It is known that TNFR- and Fas-mediated apoptosis are mediated by ICE-dependent pathway. Our observation that neither an ICE nor CPP-32 inhibitor blocked the cell density-dependent apoptosis in HL-60 cells confirms our speculation. TGF-β1 is also known as an apoptosis-inducing cytokine, and it has been reported to induce apoptosis in hematopoietic cells (7Bies J. Wolff L.

Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 393-398PubMed Google Scholar), and epidermal cells (22Yanagihara K. Tsumura M. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 4042-4045PubMed Google Scholar, 23Havrilesky L.J. Hurteau J.A.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3412-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). However, it is not yet understood how the signals for this induction are transmitted through the TGFβ receptor (TGFβR). Recently, a novel mitogen-activated kinase kinase kinase and mitogen-activated kinase kinase were cloned that mediate the signals from TGFβR (25Shibuya H. Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Tonegawa A. Gotoh Y. Ueno N. Irie K. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1996; 272: 1179-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 26Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Oishi I. Ueno N. Tanigichi T. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1995; 270: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar). Because mitogen-activated kinase kinase kinase-mediated signaling pathways are reported to be involved in the induction of apoptosis in rat PC-12 cells (27Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5034) Google Scholar) and also in mink Mv1Lu cells (28Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. ten Dijke P. Saitoh M. Moriguchi T. Takagi M. Matsumoto K. Miyazono K. Gotoh Y. Science. 1996; 275: 90-94Crossref Scopus (2026) Google Scholar), it seems likely that TGF-β1 induces apoptosis by activating these pathways. However, we observed a completely unexpected result: TGF-β1 strongly inhibited the induction of the cell density-dependent apoptosis in HL-60 cells. There is only one report mentioning the anti-apoptotic effect of TGF-β1, where it is shown that the apoptosis of peripheral T cells in T cell receptor-transgenic mice (29Zhang X. Giangreco L. Broome H.E. Dargan C.M. Swain S.L. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 699-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) was inhibited by the coexistence of TGF-β and interleukin-2. But even in this case, TGF-β added alone without interleukin-2 induced apoptosis (29Zhang X. Giangreco L. Broome H.E. Dargan C.M. Swain S.L. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 699-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Our result is thus the first that clearly illustrates the sole contribution of TGF-β1 to apoptosis inhibition. Furthermore, this anti-apoptotic effect of TGF-β1 seems to be specific for the cell density-dependent apoptosis in HL-60 cells, because it did not inhibit but, instead, enhanced the actinomycin D-induced apoptosis in these cells (data not shown). In examining the effect of activin A, a member of the TGF-β superfamily, we found that it also inhibited the induction of the cell density-dependent apoptosis in HL-60 cells. The mechanism of this inhibition by TGF-β1 in HL-60 cells is a matter of great interest. Decreased production of autocrine apoptosis-inducer by TGF-β1 was ruled out (Fig. 6 F), and its antagonistic effect on the apoptosis inducer was confirmed (Fig.6 G). These results suggest two possibilities for the mechanism of the inhibitory effect on cell density-dependent apoptosis. One is the rapid interaction of intracellular signaling events triggered by TGF-β1 with those by the apoptosis inducer. The other is the more delayed effect of TGF-β1, probably via synthesis of certain anti-apoptotic proteins. According to our preliminary studies, TGF-β1 had no effect on the protein expression of well-known anti-apoptotic genes, includingbcl-2, bcl-x L, and hcl-1. Further investigations from the standing point of signaling transduction and also new gene induction are required. It has also been reported that TGF-β1 was able to inhibit cell proliferation (30Riopel L. Branchaud C.L. Goodyer C.G. Adkar V. Lefebvre Y. J. Cell. Physiol. 1989; 140: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar); this seems to be achieved by the arrest of the cell cycle progression (31Shipley G.D. Pittelkow M.R. Wille Jr., J.J. Scott R.E. Moses H.L. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 2068-2071PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, we observed inhibition of proliferation (decrease in cell cycle progression speed) in human leukemic MO7e cells by TGF-β1 (data not shown). We demonstrated earlier, however, that TGF-β1 had no effect on proliferation speed (progression of cell cycle) in HL-60 cells despite its potent inhibitory effect on apoptosis. These findings together indicate that TGF-β1 affects the cell cycle progression or apoptosis induction according to the cell types and also suggest that the signaling pathways for cell cycle arrest and those for apoptosis inhibition are independently regulated. We showed that the overexpression of Bcl-2 protein strongly inhibited the induction of cell density-dependent apoptosis in HL-60 cells. We also showed that the conditioned medium of Bcl-2 overexpressing HL-60 cells had as well an activity to induce apoptosis in parental cells, indicating that Bcl-2 protein did not inhibit the release of the apoptosis-inducing factor but, rather, antagonized the intracellular signaling pathway for apoptosis induction. It is also of interest whether other Bcl-2 family proteins, including Bcl-x and Bax, can inhibit HL-60 cells spontaneous apoptosis. Whether cell density-dependent apoptosis is a phenomenon specific to HL-60 cells or is more generalized is an interesting point. We also investigated the existence of cell density-dependent apoptosis using two other human leukemic lines, U937 cells and MO7e cells, and we observed that MO7e cells underwent apoptosis in the course of proliferation when the cell density rose above 7 × 105/ml (data not shown). Interestingly, cell density-dependent apoptosis in these cells was not affected by TGF-β1 (data not shown). U937 cells, on the other hand, did not undergo apoptosis in the course of normal proliferation, but did when cultured in an artificially concentrated condition where the cell density was higher than 3 × 106/ml. Furthermore, this concentration-dependent apoptosis induction in U937 cells was inhibited by TGF-β1 (preliminary observation). Thus, cell density-dependent apoptosis seems to be a common phenomenon in human hematopoietic cells, although there are some differences in the mode of its induction among cell lines and its sensitivity to the actions of TGF-β1. Cell density-dependent apoptosis is physiologically of great importance not only in vitro but also in vivo, since it may contribute to the homeostasis of blood cell production via a negative feedback regulator of cell proliferation. Mechanistic study of cell density-dependent apoptosis may also lead to the development of a novel therapy for hematological malignancies. Further studies are required to prevent the uncontrolled proliferation of tumor cells by the application of cell density-dependent apoptosis.

Specific binding of a fluorescein-labeled derivative of the COOH-terminal dodecapeptide of hirudin ([5F] Hir54–65) to exosite I was used to probe changes in the function of the regulatory site accompanying inactivation of thrombin by its physiological serpin inhibitor, antithrombin. Fluorescence-monitored equilibrium binding studies showed that [5F]Hir54–65 and Hir54–65 bound to human α-thrombin with dissociation constants of 26 ± 2 nm and 38 ± 5 nm, respectively, while the affinity of the peptides for the stable thrombin-antithrombin complex was undetectable (≥200-fold weaker). Kinetic studies showed that the loss of binding sites for [5F]Hir54–65 occurred with the same time-course as the loss of thrombin catalytic activity. Binding of [5F] Hir54–65 and Hir54–65 to thrombin was correlated quantitatively with partial inhibition of the rate of the thrombin-antithrombin reaction, maximally decreasing the bimolecular rate constants 1.7- and 2.1-fold, respectively. These results support a mechanism in which thrombin and the thrombin-Hir54–65 complex can associate with antithrombin and undergo formation of the covalent thrombin-antithrombin complex at modestly different rates, with inactivation of exosite I leading to dissociation of the peptide occurring subsequent to the rate-limiting inactivation of thrombin. This mechanism may function physiologically in localizing the activity of thrombin by allowing inactivation of thrombin that is bound in exosite I-mediated complexes with regulatory proteins, such as thrombomodulin and fibrin, without prior dissociation of these complexes.

The activity of the blood clotting enzyme, thrombin, is determined by a balance between proteolytic action on physiological substrates, and irreversible inactivation by the serpin, antithrombin.

Chem. 1990; 265: 13484-13489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), contributing to the conclusion that recognition of antithrombin by thrombin does not involve exosite I significantly (7Naski M.C.

Binding of regulatory macromolecules to exosite I results in similarly modest effects on the rate of thrombin inactivation by antithrombin. Thrombin binding to fibrin I increases the rate 2.8-fold (19Naski M.C Shafer J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13003-13010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Naski M.C. Shafer J.A. J. Biol.

The rate of inactivation of thrombin bound to thrombomodulin is unaffected or decreased ∼2-fold for thrombomodulin lacking covalently attached chondroitin sulfate (22Aritomi M. Watanabe N. Ohishi R.

The information available indicates that the catalytic site of thrombin is accessible to antithrombin when the proteinase is bound in exosite I complexes with hirudin peptide, fibrin I and II, or thrombomodulin, and the reaction rate is not greatly affected (7Naski M.C.

On the basis of the mechanism of the thrombin-antithrombin reaction (see Refs. 29Gettins P.G.W. Patston P.A. Olson S.T. Serpins: Structure, Function and Biology. R. G. Landes Company, Austin, TX1996: 33-109Google Scholar and 30Wright H.T. Scarsdale J.N. Proteins Struct. Funct. Gen. 1995; 22: 210-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar for reviews), this implies that thrombin can associate with antithrombin and undergo irreversible formation of the covalent thrombin-antithrombin complex with exosite I occupied. This suggests that exosite I may remain accessible in the proteinase-inhibitor complex, which could inhibit further exosite I-dependent reactions by accumulation of this bound product. Results of other studies, however, suggest that this is not the case. The thrombin-antithrombin complex formed in the presence of thrombomodulin does not inhibit the rate of subsequent thrombomodulin-enhanced inactivation of thrombin by antithrombin or activation of protein C, and it has been proposed that loss of affinity of the thrombin-antithrombin complex for thrombomodulin allows the cofactor protein to recycle following thrombin inactivation (22Aritomi M. Watanabe N. Ohishi R. Gomi K. Kiyota T. Yamamoto S. Ishida T. Maruyama I. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 70: 418-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 27Bourin M.-C. Ohlin A.-K. Lane D.A. Stenflo J. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8044-8052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Collectively, the observations available present a paradox concerning the mechanism that can accommodate the relatively small, nonessential effects of exosite I interactions on the rate of thrombin inactivation by antithrombin, and also result in loss of affinity of the thrombin-antithrombin complex for exosite I ligands. The present studies were undertaken to investigate this question by determining the fate of exosite I in the thrombin-antithrombin reaction. A fluorescent analog of hirudin54–65 (Hir54–65), similar to the derivative of hirudin53–64 described previously by Liu et al. (31Liu L.-W. Ye J. Johnson A.E. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23632-23636Google Scholar), was prepared and used as a specific probe of the function of the exosite. The affinities of fluorescein-labeled Hir54–65 and unlabeled Hir54–65 for exosite I were decreased >200-fold in the thrombin-antithrombin complex. Results of kinetic studies indicate that thrombin with Hir54–65 bound to exosite I can associate with antithrombin, and that effectively irreversible inactivation of exosite I and dissociation of the peptide occur subsequent to the rate-limiting formation of the covalent thrombin-antithrombin complex. These observations support a mechanism in which thrombin bound to regulatory macromolecules through exosite I may be inactivated by antithrombin without the requirement for dissociation of these complexes. Formation of the thrombin-antithrombin stable complex may drive the release of the inactive complex, thereby providing a mechanism for regulatory macromolecules to act as catalytic effectors of thrombin inactivation. This mechanism may function physiologically in clearing thrombin from regulatory macromolecules and participate in localizing thrombin activity. Human α-thrombin was purified as described previously (32Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14963-14973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or obtained from Dr. John Fenton (New York State Department of Health, Albany, NY). Thrombin concentration was determined by active site titration and absorbance at 280 nm with an absorption coefficient of 1.83 (mg/ml)−1 cm−1 and a molecular weight of 36,600 (33Fenton J.W., II Fasco M.J. Stackrow A.B. Aronson D.L. Young A.M. Finlayson J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 3587-3598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preparations of thrombin used in these studies were >95% active. Thrombin inactivated with FPR-CH2Cl (FPR-thrombin) was prepared by incubation of 30 μm enzyme with a 2-fold excess of FPR-CH2Cl for 30 min. at 25 °C, and the residual activity (<0.02%) was determined by chromogenic substrate assay, as described below. Thrombin was labeled at the active site with 4′-{[(iodoacetyl)amino]methyl}fluorescein andN α-[(acetylthio)acetyl]-d-Phe-Pro-Arg-CH2Cl ([4′-AF]FPR-T) and characterized as described previously (34Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14974-14981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Bock P.E. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 478-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The preparation used in these studies contained 0.87 mol of fluorescein/mol of thrombin. Antithrombin was purified from human plasma as described previously (36Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), and its concentration was determined by absorbance at 280 nm with an absorption coefficient of 0.65 (mg/ml)−1 cm−1 and a molecular weight of 58,000. Preparations of antithrombin were fully active, as measured by thrombin reaction stoichiometries of 1.08 ± 0.08 mol/mol and a second-order rate constant for thrombin inhibition of 0.89 × 104m−1 s−1 under the conditions used previously (37Olson S.T. Björk I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6353-6364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thrombin-antithrombin complex (T-AT*) was prepared by reaction of 28–39 μm thrombin with a 1.7–2.2-fold excess of antithrombin for 10–120 min at 25 °C in 50 mm Hepes, 0.125 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml polyethylene glycol 8000, pH 7.40. The concentration of T-AT* was taken as the initial thrombin concentration, consistent with the essentially complete disappearance of thrombin observed by SDS-gel electrophoresis. The residual thrombin concentration (<0.19%) was calculated from the residual chromogenic substrate activity. Solutions of the Tyr63-sulfated hirudin dodecapeptide (Sigma or Bachem) were prepared in water and their concentrations calculated from the purity specified by the manufacturers. The fluorescent derivative, [5F]Hir54–65, was prepared by modifications of the procedure described previously for a similar derivative (31Liu L.-W. Ye J. Johnson A.E. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23632-23636Google Scholar). 5-Carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (Molecular Probes) in Me2SO was added to 0.4–0.5 mm peptide to give a 5–9-fold molar excess in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, and incubated for 2 h in the dark at 22 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition of 1 m NH4Cl, pH 7.4, to 0.1 m and the labeled peptide was separated from excess dye by chromatography on Sephadex G10 (1 × 119 cm) in water. The labeled peptide was purified by reverse-phase HPLC on a Beckman Ultrasphere 5-μm C18-silica column (4.6 × 150 mm) equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water and developed at 0.5 ml/min with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in CH3CN. The column was washed with trifluoroacetic acid/H2O for ∼20 min after application of the sample, increased to 20% CH3CN over 10 min and washed for ∼50 min, and eluted finally with a linear gradient from 20% to 50% CH3CN over 60 min. Fractions containing the major fluorescent peak eluting at ∼36% CH3CN were neutralized by addition of 1 m NH4HCO3 to 50 mm and lyophilized. The purified peptide was dissolved in water, and its concentration was determined from the fluorescein absorbance at 490 nm in 10 mm NaOH with an absorption coefficient of 89,125 m−1 cm−1(38Melhado L.L. Peltz S.W. Leytus S.P. Mangel W.F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 7299-7306Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Purified [5F]Hir54–65 eluted from the above column with a linear gradient as a single peak at 39% CH3CN. Solutions of [5F]Hir54–65 were stored frozen in water. The labeled peptide was stable in water for at least 2 days at room temperature in the dark, as shown by the unchanged HPLC elution profile. All experiments were performed in 50 mm Hepes, 0.125 m NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mg/ml polyethylene glycol 8000, pH 7.4, and at 25 °C. Fluorescence measurements were made with an SLM 8000 fluorometer in the ratio mode, using acrylic cuvettes (Sarstedt) coated with polyethylene glycol 20,000 to minimize protein adsorption (39Latallo Z.S. Hall J.A. Thromb. Res. 1986; 43: 507-521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Measurements of [5F]Hir54–65 binding to thrombin were performed with 491 nm excitation (4 nm band pass) and 515 nm emission (8 nm band pass), corresponding to the difference maxima from spectra of 0.2 μm peptide in the absence and presence of saturating (1 μm) thrombin. Fluorescence changes of [4′-AF]FPR-thrombin were measured with 500 nm excitation (4–8 nm band pass) and 519 nm emission (8–16 nm band pass), the excitation and emission difference maxima from spectra of 175 nm labeled thrombin in the absence and presence of 5 μmHir54–65. Titrations were done by successive addition of small volumes of titrant with <10% dilution, and, when necessary, corrected for background by subtraction of measurements on solutions lacking the labeled species. Fluorescence data were expressed as the fractional change in the initial fluorescence (ΔF/F o = (F obs -F o)/F o ). Titrations of several fixed concentrations of [5F]Hir54–65([P] o ) as a function of the total concentration of thrombin ([L] o ) were fit simultaneously by the quadratic equilibrium binding equation (Equation 1) to obtain the maximum fluorescence change (ΔF max /F o ), dissociation constant (K P ), and stoichiometric factor (n).ΔFFo=ΔFmaxFo(n[P] o+[L] o+KP)−(n[P] o+[L] o+KP) 2−4n[P] o[L] o2n[P] oEquation 1 For analysis of less extensive data obtained with the same materials, ΔF max /F o andK D were fit with n fixed at the determined value. Fluorescence titrations of [5F]Hir54–65 (P) with FPR-thrombin (L), and of [4′-AF]FPR-thrombin (P) with Hir54–65 (L) were analyzed similarly. In experiments testing the effect of T-AT* on FPR-thrombin binding to [5F]Hir54–65, residual active thrombin (≤0.1%) present in mixtures of thrombin and antithrombin incubated under the conditions given above for 30 min to form T-AT* was quantitated by chromogenic substrate assay and rapidly inactivated by addition of 5 μm FPR-CH2Cl. The concentration of this residual FPR-thrombin was included in the total FPR-thrombin concentration in the titrations. The estimated magnitude of the affinity for the possible competitive binding of T-AT* (C) and FPR-T (L) to [5F]Hir54–65 (P) was evaluated from the binding curves simulated with Equation 1, with K P increased by a factor of (1 + [T-AT*] o /K C ), whereK C represents the dissociation constant for T-AT* binding to [5F]Hir54–65. Fluorescence studies of native thrombin (L) binding to [5F]Hir54–65 (P) with unlabeled Hir54–65(C) as a competitor were performed by measuring the fluorescence changes after addition of fixed concentrations of thrombin to [5F]Hir54–65, and titration with Hir54–65. Data collected at a fixed concentration of [5F]Hir54–65([P] o ) as a function of the total Hir54–65concentration ([C] o ) and several fixed total thrombin concentrations ([L] o ), along with data for titration of the same concentration of [5F]Hir54–65 with thrombin alone, were fit simultaneously with Equation 2 to determine the dissociation constant (K C ) and stoichiometric factor (m) for competitive binding of Hir54–65 to thrombin, as well as K P andΔF max /F o (40Olson S.T.

The same methods were used to analyze binding of Hir54–65 (L) to [4′-AF]FPR-thrombin (P) with native thrombin (C) as a competitor. The magnitudes of the affinities of T-AT* and AT as competitors were evaluated from the binding curves simulated with Equation 2 for given values ofK C . The time course of thrombin inactivation by antithrombin was measured under pseudo-first-order reaction conditions ([AT] o ≥ 10[T] o ), from the loss of thrombin chromogenic substrate activity. Chromogenic substrate activity was determined as the initial rate of hydrolysis of 100 μmH-d-Phe-Pip-Arg-p-nitroanilide at pH 7.4 and 25 °C from the linear increase in absorbance at 405 nm with time. Residual thrombin concentration ([T] t ) was expressed as the fraction of the initial activity measured for an identical control reaction mixture lacking AT, to account for small effects of transferred hirudin peptide on the assay rate. Reaction progress curves were fit by Equation 3, for a single exponential decay, to obtain the observed pseudo-first-order rate constant (k obs), the reaction amplitude ([T] o ), and end point (B).[T] t=[T] oe−kobst+BEquation 3 For analysis of reactions predicted to deviate from initially exponential behavior, model-independent estimates of the initialk obs (k obso) were obtained by fitting Equation 4 to the data, where the time dependence of the deviation from exponential behavior was approximated by a second degree polynomial.[T] t=[T] oe−(at2+bt)Equation 4 The data were truncated at 90% of completion for this analysis, and k obso was taken as the least-squares fit value of the coefficient, b. The apparent bimolecular rate constants were calculated ask obso/[AT] o . Kinetic studies of the dissociation of [5F]Hir54–65 from T upon its reaction with AT were done by first measuring the decrease in fluorescence on addition of thrombin to the fluorescent peptide, and then the increase with time subsequent to initiation of the reaction with AT. The fluorescence changes measured with time (ΔF t ) were transformed into the total concentrations of thrombin binding sites for the peptide probe (P) at the corresponding times ([T] t ) with Equation 5, which is a rearrangement of the binding equation (Equation 1), using the parameters determined in the binding studies.[T] t=ΔFtΔFmaxn[P] o+KP1−ΔFtΔFmaxEquation 5 The data were expressed as the fraction of the initial total thrombin concentration remaining ([T] t /[T] o ), and the progress curves were analyzed as described for the activity experiments. Least-squares fitting, numerical integration, and simulation were performed with SCIENTIST software (MicroMath Software). All reported estimates of error represent ± 2 S.E. A fluorescent analog of Hir54–65 that was modified at the amino terminus with 5-carboxyfluorescein ([5F]Hir54–65) was synthesized, and its binding to thrombin was characterized from changes in fluorescence intensity. As shown in Fig. 1 A, thrombin titrations of fixed concentrations of [5F]Hir54–65 from 10 nm to 500 nm were well described by binding of the peptide to 0.91 ± 0.04 sites on thrombin with a dissociation constant of 26 ± 2 nm, and a maximum decrease in fluorescence of 26 ± 0.3% (Table I). Binding of unlabeled Hir54–65 to thrombin was examined from its effect on the [5F]Hir54–65 interaction. Addition of Hir54–65 to mixtures of thrombin and the labeled peptide resulted in return of the quenched fluorescence toward the initial value (Fig. 1 B). Simultaneous nonlinear least-squares analysis of titrations with Hir54–65 at fixed thrombin concentrations ranging from 20 to 460 nmindicated a good fit with the equation for high affinity competitive binding of the labeled and unlabeled peptides, with Hir54–65 binding to 0.89 ± 0.07 sites on thrombin with a dissociation constant of 38 ± 5 nm (Table I). These results indicated that Hir54–65 and the fluorescein-labeled analog bound competitively and with similar, high affinity to exosite I of thrombin.Table IBinding and kinetic constants determined for thrombin, hirudin peptide, and antithrombin interactionsInteractionMethodBinding constantsKinetic constantsK DsitesΔF max/F oK Pkk′nmmol/mol thrombin%nm× 10 4 m −1 s −1× 10 4 m −1 s −1Fluorescent hirudin peptide ([5F]Hir54–65) TDirect fluorescence titration26 ± 20.91 ± 0.04−26 ± 0.3 FPR-TDirect fluorescence titration26 ± 20.75 ± 0.03−30 ± 0.2 T-AT*Competitive binding with FPR-T>5200 T+AT→Initial exponential analysis of activity loss and fluorescence kinetics16 ± 130.75 ± 0.050.43 ± 0.04 T+AT→Numerical analysis of activity loss and fluorescence kinetics19 ± 60.71 ± 0.020.42 ± 0.01Unlabeled hirudin peptide (Hir54–65) TCompetitive binding with [5F]Hir54–6538 ± 50.89 ± 0.07 [4′-AF]FPR-TDirect fluorescence titration136 ± 71.20 ± 0.0552 ± 0.6 TCompetitive binding with [4′-AF]FPR-T35 ± 90.94 ± 0.08 ATCompetitive binding with [4′-AF]FPR-T>7000 T-AT*Competitive binding with [4′-AF]FPR-T>7000 T+AT→Initial exponential analysis of activity loss kinetics31 ± 240.75 ± 0.050.35 ± 0.06 T+AT→Numerical analysis of activity loss kinetics37 ± 70.74 ± 0.020.34 ± 0.01 Open table in a new tab In contrast to the results for thrombin, the thrombin-antithrombin stable complex (T-AT*) or antithrombin (AT) decreased the fluorescence of [5F]Hir54–65 by <3% at concentrations up to 3 μm T-AT* or 10 μm AT (Fig. 2).

These interactions, and consequently affinity for TF, may be influenced by conformational changes in the protease domain that result from zymogen-enzyme transition or occupancy of the active site by tight binding inhibitors. In functional competition and direct binding analysis, we determined affinities for zymogen and enzyme species of wild-type VII and of mutants at protease domain residues that contact TF. We demonstrate that TF binding is not influenced by zymogen activation, indicating that the protease domain of zymogen and enzyme dock similarly with TF. In contrast, active site occupancy enhanced the affinity for TF by predominantly decreasing the dissociation rate of the TF·VIIa complex. Of the three interface residues studied, only Met306 played a major role in the inhibitor-induced increase in affinity. Met306 is also important for transmitting the allosteric changes from TF to the active site, resulting in enhanced catalysis. This study thus provides evidence for a bidirectional conformational interdependence of the interface residue Met306 and the active site of VIIa.

Because of the solvent accessibility of the insertion site, proteolytic activation of zymogen VII may proceed even if VII is docked to TF in a manner identical to the enzyme VIIa. However, some studies reported a difference in the affinity for TF when zymogen VII was compared with the active protease (4Bach R. Gentry R. Nemerson Y. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4007-4020Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 5O'Brien D.P. Kemball-Cook G. Hutchinson A.M. Martin D.M.A. Johnson D.J.D. Byfield P.G.H. Takamiya O. Tuddenham E.G.D.

Chem. 1996; 271: 26569-26574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) furthermore proposed that binding epitopes in bovine zymogen VII are not accessible for binding to TF, unless VII is activated. We hypothesized that conformational consequences of zymogen activation likely affect interactions of the protease domain of VIIa with TF. By alanine scanning mutagenesis, we had previously identified residues in the VIIa protease domain that are involved in binding TF (8Dickinson C.D. Kelly C.R. Ruf W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14379-14384Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). By comparing the binding characteristics of zymogen and enzyme forms of mutants at residue positions that contact TF, we here address the question of whether specific residue side chains in the interface with TF play different roles in the interaction of zymogen as compared with enzyme. The binding residues in the interface with TF also transmit the allosteric changes that result in the catalytic activation of VIIa (8Dickinson C.D. Kelly C.R. Ruf W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14379-14384Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Moreover, a reverse effect of active site occupancy and TF binding exists, as demonstrated by the increased TF affinity upon modification of the active site of VIIa with tight binding inhibitors (7Higashi S. Matsumoto N. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26569-26574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) or upon binding of substrates (9Butenas S. Ribarik N. Mann K.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6531-6538Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 10Nemerson Y. Gentry R. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4020-4033Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that these conformational effects transmit to specific binding residues in the interface with TF. By characterizing the effect of active site modification of replacement mutants in the interface with TF, we identify one residue side chain that is influenced by inhibitor occupancy of the active site of VIIa. This analysis thus provides insight into the molecular details of the conformational changes in the protease domain of VIIa that affect TF interactions. Full-length recombinant human TF from insect cells was reconstituted in 30% phosphatidylserine, 70% phosphatidylcholine as described (11Ruf W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11631-11636Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Plasma factor X was purified according to Fairet al. (12Fair D.S. Plow E.F. Edgington T.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1979; 64: 884-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) followed by an immunoaffinity step to remove residual VII (8Dickinson C.D. Kelly C.R. Ruf W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14379-14384Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The Kunitz-type inhibitor 5L15, which was selected from bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor by random mutagenesis and phage display for affinity for VIIa (13Jespers L.S. Messens J.H. De Keyser A. Eeckhout D. Van Den Brande I. Gansemans Y.G. Lauwereys M.J. Vlasuk G.P. Stanssens P.E. Biotechnology. 1995; 13: 378-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), was kindly provided by Dr. George Vlasuk (Corvas International, San Diego, CA). The generation of VII mutants in the interface of the protease domain with TF has been described (8Dickinson C.D. Kelly C.R. Ruf W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14379-14384Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Protein was purified from serum-free (Excel 301 supplemented with vitamin K3) culture supernatant by antibody affinity on a Ca2+-dependent antibody to the γ-carboxyglutamic acid-rich domain, as described (11Ruf W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11631-11636Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The protein obtained from this purification was predominantly zymogen VII, and part of the protein preparation was set aside for characterization of the zymogen forms. The remaining protein was dialyzed against 50 mm NaCl, 0.25 mm CaCl2, 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.5, for further purification on Mono Q employing a CaCl2 gradient elution (0.25–100 mm) in the same buffer. This latter step resulted in >80% activation to the active enzyme. The degree of γ-carboxylation in the final preparation was determined by amino acid analysis after alkaline hydrolysis (14Kuwada M. Katayama K. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 117: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These analyses were performed by Dr. Robert Harris (Commonwealth Biotechnologies, Richmond, VA). M306A VIIa had 10.8 γ-carboxylated Glu residues, R277A VIIa 9.3, D309A VIIa 9.9, and wild-type VIIa 9.9. Using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis with selection against a unique restriction site (15Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar), we further generated a mutant with increased stability as zymogen by replacing the P1 (16Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (4697) Google Scholar) Arg with Gln (R152Q VII) and a mutant that lacked catalytic activity by Ala replacement of the active site Ser (S344A VII). The latter mutant also incorporated two replacements that precluded N-linked glycosylation (N145A and N322D). Elimination of N-linked glycosylation by these mutations in wild-type VIIa affected neither proteolytic function nor TF binding (data not shown). S344A VII was converted to S344A VIIa by incubation with factor IXa at a 1:10 enzyme:substrate ratio in 50 mm NaCl, 0.25 mmCaCl2, 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.5, overnight at 37 °C followed by purification on Mono Q employing a NaCl (20–500 mm) gradient elution in 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.5. To test the effect of active site occupancy, mutants and wild-type VIIa were reacted with 0.5 mm dansyl-Glu-Gly-Arg chloromethylketone or d-Phe-l-Phe-Arg chloromethylketone (Calbiochem) in HEPES-buffered saline (HBS), 5 mm CaCl2 for 2–4 h. Subsequently, protein samples were extensively dialyzed against HBS with six buffer exchanges over a 24-h period to remove unreacted peptide inhibitor. In a linked functional assay (8Dickinson C.D. Kelly C.R. Ruf W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14379-14384Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), we measured the ability of catalytically inactive VIIa derivatives or nonactivable VII mutant to compete with active VIIa for TF binding. In an initial incubation of 20–60 min at 37 °C, 20 pm wild-type VIIa and varying concentrations of competitor were allowed to bind to a limiting concentration of 10 pm phospholipid-reconstituted TF in HBS (150 mm NaCl, 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), 5 mm CaCl2, 0.2% bovine serum albumin. Factor X was added to 100 nm to measure catalytically active TF·VIIa complexes for 10 min at 37 °C, followed by quenching with 50 mm EDTA and determination of factor Xa formation by chromogenic substrate (Spectrozyme FXa, American Diagnostica, Greenwich, CT) hydrolysis at ambient temperature. Data were fitted by a nonlinear least squares algorithm to the equilibrium binding equation assuming competition of VIIa and derivatives to the same binding site. The KD of active VIIa was 5 pm, as determined from a dose titration in the functional assay (8Dickinson C.D. Kelly C.R. Ruf W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14379-14384Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Competition was also analyzed in an amidolytic assay with recombinant soluble TF-(1–218) expressed in Escherichia coli (17Stone M.J. Ruf W. Miles D.J. Edgington T.S. Wright P.E. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 605-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Dansyl-Glu-Gly-Arg chloromethylketone-inactivated wild-type or mutant VIIa at varying concentrations was incubated with 10 nmVIIa and 10 nm TF-(1–218) in HBS, 5 mmCaCl2, 0.2% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at 37 °C to allow for complex formation. Chromozyme tPA (Boehringer Mannheim) was added to 1 mm, and initial rates of substrate hydrolysis were recorded in a kinetic microplate reader. Data were fitted to a competitive model of ligand binding, as above, assuming aK D (app) of 2.8 nm for active VIIa binding to soluble TF-(1–218) (8Dickinson C.D. Kelly C.R. Ruf W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14379-14384Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Rate and equilibrium binding constants of VII and VIIa binding to TF were obtained by surface plasmon resonance using a BIAcore 2000, as described previously (8Dickinson C.D. Kelly C.R. Ruf W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14379-14384Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). A noninhibitory anti-TF monoclonal antibody (TF9–10H10) was immobilized by amine coupling to the N-hydroxysuccinimide ester surface to give approximately 1000 response units. The standard flow buffer was HBS, 5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm CHAPS, and all proteins were diluted in this buffer. Full-length recombinant TF-(1–263) was injected to saturate the monoclonal antibody on the sensor surface. Association data were collected from 40-μl injections of varying concentrations of VII or VIIa at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. Dissociation data were collected for 250 s after return to buffer flow. Injections of 100 mm EDTA served to regenerate the chip surface by destabilizing the TF/VIIa interaction. Association rate constants (k on) were determined from a linear fit of the concentration dependence of k S, while the dissociation rate constants (k off) were determined from the early portion of the dissociation phase following injection of 1 μm VII or VIIa. Binding kinetics for wild-type and mutant VIIa in the presence of the Kunitz-type inhibitor 5L15 were determined by premixing VIIa with 10 μm 5L15. At this concentration, the inhibitor blocked amidolytic function of free VIIa, indicating complex formation in the absence of TF. Because zymogen VII is readily activated to VIIa when bound to TF (18Nemerson Y. Repke D. Thromb. Res. 1985; 40: 351-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), we wanted to characterize the protein that was bound specifically to the immobilized TF. After allowing binding and return to buffer flow, 50 mm EDTA was injected to recover the specifically bound VII/VIIa in a single fraction. The recovered protein was reduced, separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to Immobilon P (Millipore Corp.) for Western blotting. The VIIa light chain was reacted with monoclonal antibody F5–13B12, and bound primary antibody was detected by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and chemiluminescence. Recent data indicated that bovine zymogen VII bound with reduced affinity to TF as compared with active enzyme (7Higashi S. Matsumoto N. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26569-26574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Since the described difference may be attributable to the different assay formats used for determining TF binding by enzyme VIIa (direct amidolytic assay) versus zymogen VII (competitive assay), we produced a catalytically inactive mutant VIIa by active site Ser344→ Ala replacement. S344A VIIa was generated by activation of the zymogen form by factor IXa followed by repurification using ion exchange chromatography. We also generated a zymogen VII (R152Q VII) with increased stability by replacing the P1 residue Arg152with Gln to essentially abolish activation during purification and in functional assays. These mutants allowed us to compare zymogen and enzyme forms of human VII in a competitive functional assay. Zymogen and enzyme forms showed virtually identical dose titrations in competition with wild-type VIIa (Fig. 1). The calculated affinities for zymogen and enzyme were indistinguishable, providing evidence that the affinity of VII was not appreciably altered following zymogen activation to enzyme. The affinities also matched the functionally determinedK D app (5 pm) (8Dickinson C.D. Kelly C.R. Ruf W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14379-14384Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) for VIIa binding to TF in the same assay format. In contrast, wild-type VIIa inactivated with FFR-VIIa showed a markedly enhanced inhibition and thus an increased affinity for TF, in accordance with previous studies analyzing active site-modified VIIa (7Higashi S. Matsumoto N. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26569-26574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A limitation of the competitive assay approach is the presence of substrate that could differentially affect TF binding by the VII variants. We therefore used surface plasmon resonance analysis to directly compare TF binding by VII and VIIa in the absence of substrate. TF-(1–263) solubilized with detergent was captured to the chip surface by a noninhibitory monoclonal antibody. The saturation curves and data analysis for a typical experiment with zymogen VII and enzyme VIIa are shown in Fig.2, demonstrating excellent data fit. Similar binding parameters were obtained for zymogen forms S344A VII and R152Q VII, providing evidence that the Arg152 mutation does not influence TF interaction (TableI). Furthermore, similar kinetic parameters were obtained for wild-type VIIa and activated S344A VIIa mutant (Table I), indicating that replacement of the catalytic triad Ser is without effect on cofactor affinity. From these data we conclude that zymogen activation has little, if any, effect on the kinetics of VII binding to TF and that overall affinity is not influenced by zymogen activation.Table IComparisons of binding kinetics to TF of zymogen and enzyme species of wild-type and mutant VIIk a (×105)k d (×10−4)K Dm −1 s −1s −1nmR152Q VII2.1 ± 1.07.8 ± 0.83.7Wild-type VIIa1.4 ± 0.25.6 ± 1.24.1S344A VII1.9 ± 0.74.6 ± 1.62.5S344A VIIa2.1 ± 0.97.4 ± 1.93.6R277A VII2.0 ± 0.821.3 ± 4.710.5R277A VIIa1.8 ± 0.629.0 ± 7.016.3M306A VII1.9 ± 0.617.2 ± 3.78.8M306A VIIa1.8 ± 0.514.5 ± 2.68.1D309A VII1.7 ± 0.413.5 ± 2.97.8D309A VIIa2.4 ± 0.218.8 ± 3.08.0Mean and S.D.

(n ≥ 3) for the association (k a ) and dissociation rate (k d ) are shown. K D =k d /k a . Although overall binding of zymogen and enzyme appears to be similar, specific side chains in the protease domain interface with TF may have different roles in providing affinity for TF when zymogen and enzyme are compared. We had identified three residue side chains with significant contributions to TF binding when analyzed as enzyme VIIa (8Dickinson C.D. Kelly C.R. Ruf W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14379-14384Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Comparison of the binding kinetics of enzyme and zymogen forms of mutants at Arg277 (c134), Met306 (c164), and Asp309 (c167) revealed no difference in the binding parameters (Table I). To ensure that the zymogen forms were not activated during the surface plasmon resonance analysis, samples were recovered after binding to TF on the sensor chip. Western blot analysis (Fig. 3) of these samples demonstrates a degree of activation comparable with the zymogen:enzyme ratios in the preparation prior to injection onto the sensor chip. We thus exclude the possibility that zymogen is appreciably activated during analysis and conclude that the surface plasmon resonance analysis truly measures affinity of VIIa or VII, respectively. Thus, the affinity provided by the three most significant binding contacts of the protease domain with TF was not altered by zymogen activation, indicating that zymogen and enzyme dock similarly with TF. Previous studies (7Higashi S. Matsumoto N. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26569-26574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 9Butenas S. Ribarik N. Mann K.G.

Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4020-4033Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) show that active site occupancy of VIIa influences cofactor affinity. By surface plasmon resonance, we analyzed TF binding of wild-type and mutant VIIa modified covalently with either dansyl-Glu-Gly-Arg chloromethylketone (EGR-VIIa) or FFR-VIIa. We also analyzed the effect of 5L15, a tight binding noncovalent inhibitor derived by phage maturation from bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (13Jespers L.S. Messens J.H. De Keyser A. Eeckhout D. Van Den Brande I. Gansemans Y.G. Lauwereys M.J. Vlasuk G.P. Stanssens P.E. Biotechnology. 1995; 13: 378-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). When mutant or wild-type VIIa was compared before and after active site modification, the association rates were reduced 2-fold for EGR-VIIa, increased 2–3-fold for FFR-VIIa, and unchanged in the presence of the 5L15 (TableII). There was no difference in the association rates when comparing mutant with wild-type VIIa either free or with each of the specific modifications. These experiments did not identify a molecular mechanism of how inhibitor binding influences the association rate of VIIa with TF.Table IIEffect of inhibitor binding on the kinetics of TF · VIIa complex formationk a (×105)k d (×10−4)K DΔΔGm −1 s −1s −1nmkcal/molWild type VIIa1.4 ± 0.25.6 ± 1.24.1 VIIa · 5L151.4 ± 0.11.8 ± 0.21.3−0.5 EGR-VIIa0.8 ± 0.11.3 ± 0.11.7−0.4 FFR-VIIa4.2 ± 0.20.9 ± 0.10.2−1.7R277A VIIa2.0 ± 0.821.3 ± 4.710.5 VIIa · 5L151.5 ± 0.16.9 ± 1.14.7−0.5 EGR-VIIa0.8 ± 0.14.8 ± 0.65.8−0.4 FFR-VIIa4.0 ± 1.02.4 ± 0.50.6−1.7M306A VIIa1.9 ± 0.617.2 ± 3.78.8 VIIa · 5L151.1 ± 0.411.8 ± 1.310.8+0.1 EGR-VIIa0.8 ± 0.113.1 ± 0.617.3+0.4 FFR-VIIa3.3 ± 0.14.9 ± 0.71.5−1.0D309A VIIa1.7 ± 0.413.5 ± 2.97.8 VIIa · 5L151.3 ± 0.15.2 ± 0.63.9−0.4 EGR-VIIa0.8 ± 0.13.3 ± 0.33.9−0.4 FFR-VIIa4.2 ± 0.11.7 ± 0.10.4−1.8Mean ± S.D. is given (n ≥ 3) for unmodified VIIa, covalently modified VIIa with either EGR-VIIa or FFR-VIIa or VIIa with bound 5L15 (VIIa · 5L15).

Open table in a new tab Mean ± S.D. is given (n ≥ 3) for unmodified VIIa, covalently modified VIIa with either EGR-VIIa or FFR-VIIa or VIIa with bound 5L15 (VIIa · 5L15). ΔΔG is the change in the free energy of binding compared with unmodified enzyme. The binding defect resulting from mutations of protease domain residues at the TF-binding interface is attributable to an increased dissociation rate of the mutant enzymes relative to wild-type VIIa (Table II). A lower dissociation rate was a common characteristic of active site modification by inhibitors. Inhibitor binding to wild-type VIIa slowed dissociation 6-fold for FFR-VIIa, 4-fold for EGR-VIIa, and 3-fold with 5L15 present. Inhibitor binding to R277A VIIa and D309A VIIa decreased the rate of dissociation to an extent that was similar to wild-type VIIa (Table II). In contrast, the dissociation rates of M306A VIIa were not significantly affected by binding of 5L15 or by active site modification with dansyl-Glu-Gly-Arg chloromethylketone. M306A FFR-VIIa dissociation from TF decreased 3.5-fold as compared with 6-fold for FFR-VIIa, demonstrating a partial response to binding of this inhibitor. Diminished response of M306A VIIa to inhibitor binding is also demonstrated by changes in the calculated free energy of binding relative to free enzyme (Table II). With each inhibitor, modification of M306A VIIa failed to produce a ∼0.5 kcal/mol decrease in the free energy of binding as compared with inhibited wild-type VIIa, R277A VIIa, or D309A VIIa. These data link Met306 to conformational changes in the active site of VIIa. The loss of TF binding affinity of active M306A VIIa and R277A VIIa were similar, as measured by amidolytic assay (8Dickinson C.D. Kelly C.R. Ruf W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14379-14384Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), linked proteolytic assay (8Dickinson C.D. Kelly C.R. Ruf W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14379-14384Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), or surface plasmon resonance (Table I). Both mutants exhibited a similar 0.5–0.6 kcal/mol loss in free energy of binding relative to wild-type VIIa (Table I). Following active site modification, the difference in free energy of binding was unchanged for R277A EGR-VIIa (0.6 kcal/mol) as compared with wild-type EGR-VIIa, whereas M306A EGR-VIIa showed a 1.4 kcal/mol difference in free energy of binding relative to wild-type EGR-VIIa. Since M306A did not respond to active site modification with dansyl-Glu-Gly-Arg chloromethylketone as measured by surface plasmon resonance (Table II), we predicted that M306A EGR-VIIa should be a less potent competitor for VIIa binding to TF compared with R277A EGR-VIIa. The inhibition of active VIIa binding to soluble TF-(1–218) by M306A EGR-VIIa required significantly higher concentrations than the inhibition by R277A EGR-VIIa (Fig. 4), reflected in a 3-fold higher K i for the mutant at Met306. The calculated difference in the free energy of binding between mutant and wild-type EGR-VIIa are in good agreement with the data from the surface plasmon resonance experiments, demonstrating a 1.2 kcal/mol difference for M306A EGR-VIIa as compared with 0.5 kcal/mol for R277A EGR-VIIa. The competition experiment thus provides independent evidence for a prominent role of the Met306 side chain in increasing the affinity for TF following active site inhibition. This study analyzes the effect of conformational changes in the VII protease domain on binding to cofactor TF. VIIa is among the few trypsin-like serine proteases that require cofactor binding for full catalytic function. In part, the low catalytic activity of free VIIa may result from a labile activating insertion of the newly formed amino terminus after zymogen activation (6Higashi S. Nishimura H. Aita K. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18891-18898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on alanine scanning mutagenesis of the VIIa protease domain surface, we had found evidence that TF may function through a more extended stabilization of the “activation domain” (19Huber R. Bode W. Acc. Chem. Res. 1978; 11: 114-122Crossref Scopus (604) Google Scholar), which would enhance catalysis also by influencing Asp 338 (c189), which forms the bottom of the P1 (16Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (4697) Google Scholar) specificity pocket. The latter model would suggest that VIIa may present itself in a zymogen-like state to TF and that activating conformational changes occur subsequently to docking of the protease domain with TF. The affinity of zymogen VII and enzyme VIIa binding to TF was determined by a functional competition assay and direct binding analysis using surface plasmon resonance detection. Both experimental approaches clearly demonstrate similar binding affinities of VII and VIIa for TF. Studies performed in the bovine system by Higashi et al. (7Higashi S. Matsumoto N. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26569-26574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) suggest that zymogen VII binds with lower affinity than VIIa, indicating species-specific properties of the bovine VII. Our results are consistent with previous results demonstrating little difference between human zymogen and enzyme binding to TF (20Broze G.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1982; 70: 526-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 21Ruf W. Kalnik M.W. Lund-Hansen T. Edgington T.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1989; 264: 9980-9988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The finding that VII and VIIa bind to TF with similar affinity does not exclude the possibility that TF contacts are different for the protease domain of VIIa as opposed to VII. Three major energetically important contact residues in the protease domain contribute to TF·VIIa complex formation (8Dickinson C.D. Kelly C.R. Ruf W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14379-14384Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). We determined binding kinetics for zymogen and enzyme form of each of the mutants at position Arg277 (c134), Met306 (c164), and Asp309 (c167). Since binding affinities for each mutant zymogen and enzyme form were indistinguishable, it is reasonable to conclude that the protease domain of VII or VIIa docks similarly with TF. Based on this finding, we speculate that the overall structure of the TF·VII complex is quite similar to the TF·VIIa structure (3Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Chène C. Winkler F.K. Guha A. Konigsberg W.H. Nemerson Y. Kirchhofer D.

Matsumoto N. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26569-26574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), we found that active site occupancy of VIIa resulted in tighter binding to TF. Each inhibitor had different effects on the association rate of VIIa. Covalent modifications with dansyl-Glu-Gly-Arg chloromethylketone decreased the association rate, whereas Phe-Phe-Arg chloromethylketone had the opposite effect. The Kunitz-type inhibitor 5L15 influenced the association rate insignificantly. The effect on the on-rate was not influenced by mutations of the three major contact residues of the protease domain with TF, and we could not identify the contacts that are responsible for these changes. All three inhibitors also decreased the dissociation rate to a variable degree. Whereas R277A VIIa and D309A VIIa showed similar reductions in the dissociation rates, no changes or only partial changes were observed for M306A VIIa. For each of the inhibitors analyzed, Met306 (c164) seemed to be responsible for ∼0.5 kcal/mol of the decrease in the free energy of binding that results from inhibitor binding. These data provide support for the hypothesis of a conformational interdependence of the active site of VIIa and the interface of the protease domain with TF. In the structure of FFR-VIIa in complex with TF, Met306packs in a hydrophobic pocket formed by TF residues Phe76, Tyr94, Pro92, and Arg74 (3Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Chène C. Winkler F.K. Guha A.

Studies from our laboratory found a major importance (ΔΔG 1.2 kcal/mol) for Phe76 but little energetic contributions of Pro92 or Tyr94 when tested in a functional assay (26Ruf W. Kelly C.R. Schullek J.R. Martin D.M.A. Polikarpov I. Boys C.W.G. Tuddenham E.G.D. Edgington T.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6310-6315Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In contrast, Kelley et al. (27Kelley R.F. Costas K.E. O'Connell M.P. Lazarus R.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10383-10392Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) documented a major contribution (>1 kcal/mol) for Tyr94, when binding kinetics were determined with VIIa captured on a chip through active site modification with Glu-Gly-Arg chloromethylketone. The discrepancy in the results may be attributable to the covalent active site modification of VIIa, suggesting that Met306 in modified VIIa interacts with Tyr94 and that this interaction is responsible for the increased affinity of TF·VIIa complex formation. We had previously shown that proteolytic and amidolytic function of M306A VIIa were concordantly reduced in comparison with wild-type VIIa, suggesting that activation of the primary specificity site is mediated by cofactor interactions at Met306 (8Dickinson C.D. Kelly C.R. Ruf W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14379-14384Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In contrast, the functional defect resulting from mutation of another interface residue, Arg277, was largely attributable to a defect in extended substrate recognition. The results here demonstrate a function of Met306 in mediating an inhibitor-dependent increased affinity for TF and thus emphasize a bidirectional conformational interdependence of the interface residue Met306 with the primary specificity site of VIIa.

The importance of suppressing class I to preserve self-tolerance and prevent autoimmunity is becoming clear in multiple disease states. For example, methimazole and iodide, agents used to treat patients with Graves' disease, one form of ATD, act in part by suppressing class I levels in thyrocytes (2Saji M. Moriarty J. Ban T.

Similarly, we considered the possibility that transcription factors involved in TSH/cAMP-increased TG and TPO gene expression might suppress class I, since TG and TPO are major thyroid autoantigens in ATD.Transcription factors involved in TSH/cAMP regulation of TSHR gene expression (11Ikuyama S.

TSH/cAMP induce the formation of specific and novel protein-DNA complexes with the silencer; the induced complexes reflect the ability of TSH/cAMP to regulate the interaction of multiple transcription factors with the silencer, the net result of which is suppression of class I gene expression.

Moriarty J. Ban T. Kohn L.D. Singer D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1944-1948Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Examination of this 128-bp DNA segment revealed the presence of an 8-bp sequence, −107 to −100 bp (Fig.1 A), with homology to characterized CREs (23Montminy M.R. Sevario K.A. Wagner J.A. Mandel G. Goodman R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6682-6686Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar, 24Habener J.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1087-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). To determine whether this element functioned to regulate class I promoter activity, a set of derivative constructs was generated from a parental construct containing 127 bp of 5′-flanking sequence p(−127CAT). In one derivative, the 8-bp CRE-like sequence was deleted; in the other, we substituted a nonpalindromic mutation of the CRE-like octamer (Fig. 1 B). Both constructs displayed increased promoter activity, relative to the parental construct, when transfected into FRTL-5 cells maintained in the absence of TSH (Fig. 1 B).The ability of the CRE-like element to silence a heterologous promoter was also assessed by introducing a 38-bp DNA segment, spanning −127 to −90 bp, downstream of an SV40 minimal promoter (Fig. 1 C). The choice of a 38-bp segment was derived from the experiments described below. When placed in a 5′ to 3′ orientation, a single copy of this DNA segment was able to significantly reduce SV40 promoter activity, and the magnitude of the effect increased with the number of copies of the 38-bp segment inserted (Fig. 1 C). When placed in a 3′ to 5′ orientation, two copies of this DNA segment were also able to significantly reduce SV40 promoter activity (Fig.1 C). Derivatives of the 38-bp segment, containing either a deletion (ΔCRE 1 (+)) or nonpalindromic (NP CRE 1 (+)) mutation of the CRE-like element, did not similarly decrease SV40 promoter activity (Fig. 1 C).TSH or forskolin significantly decreased the activity of the p(−127)CAT construct in FRTL-5 cells relative to untreated controls (Table I, A, columns 3–5), i.e. TSH enhanced the silencer activity. Deletion or mutation of the CRE, which increases the constitutive level of promoter activity in the absence of TSH, diminished the repressive response to TSH (Table I, A, columns 3–5). The role of the CRE-like site in conferring TSH/cAMP responsiveness was confirmed in studies using the 38-bp silencer linked to the heterologous promoter (Table I, B). Although the SV40 promoter alone did not respond to TSH or forskolin, the promoter activities of a construct containing a single copy of the CRE 1 in a sense orientation (CRE 1 (+)) or of constructs containing one or two copies of CRE 1 in a 3′ to 5′ orientation (CRE 1 (−), CRE 2 (−)), but not their nonpalindromic mutations, were significantly reduced by TSH or forskolin (Table I, B, columns 3–5).Figure 6The C complexes formed with the 38-bp silencer appear to involve proteins able to bind either its coding or noncoding strands (A); these appear to involve two single strand binding proteins important in TSH/cAMP suppression of TSHR gene expression in FRTL-5 thyroid cells: TSEP-1 and SSBP-1 (17Shimura H.

ACTH stimulates adrenocortical gene expression in vivo and inhibits adrenocortical cell proliferation. Binding of ACTH to its G-protein-coupled receptor stimulates the production of cAMP and activation of the protein kinase A pathway. The stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs) (or c-Jun N-terminal kinases) and the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) are members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family of serine/threonine kinases, which have recently been implicated in G-protein-coupled receptor intracellular signaling. The SAPKs are preferentially induced by osmotic stress and UV light, whereas the ERKs are preferentially induced by growth factors and proliferative signals in cultured cells. In these studies, ACTH stimulated SAPK activity 3–4-fold both in the adrenal cortex in vivo and in the Y1 adrenocortical cell line. 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate but not cAMP induced SAPK activity in Y1 cells. The isoquinolinesulfonamide inhibitors H-8 and H-89 blocked ACTH induction of SAPK activity at protein kinase C inhibitory doses but not at protein kinase A inhibitory doses. The calcium chelating agent EGTA inhibited ACTH-induced SAPK activity and the calcium ionophore A23187 induced SAPK activity 3-fold. In contrast with the induction of SAPK by ACTH, ERK activity was inhibited in the adrenal cortex in vivoand in Y1 adrenal cells. Together these findings suggest that ACTH induces SAPK activity through a PKC and Ca+2-dependent pathway. The induction of SAPK and inhibition of ERK by ACTH in vivo may preferentially regulate target genes involved in the adrenocortical stress responses in the whole animal.

The induction of SAPK and inhibition of ERK by ACTH in vivo may preferentially regulate target genes involved in the adrenocortical stress responses in the whole animal. ACTH binds to specific G-protein (Gs)-coupled surface receptors in the adrenal cortex to induce secretion of steroid hormones critical for the normal stress response. The stimulatory guanine nucleotide-bound Gs couples to adenylate cyclase, leading to a series of signaling cascades. The acute ACTH response is associated with a rapid increase in steroid secretion and is mediated by cAMP and cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) 1The abbreviations used are: PKA, protein kinase A; PKC, protein kinase C; TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; SAPK, stress-activated protein kinases; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; H-8,N-(2-(methylamino)ethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide hydrochloride; H-89,N-(2-(p-bromocinnamyl)amino)ethyl-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide hydrochloride; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α CRE, cAMP response element; 8-bromo-cAMP, 8-bromoadenosine 3′:5′-cyclic monophosphate. 1The abbreviations used are: PKA, protein kinase A; PKC, protein kinase C; TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; SAPK, stress-activated protein kinases; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; H-8,N-(2-(methylamino)ethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide hydrochloride; H-89,N-(2-(p-bromocinnamyl)amino)ethyl-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide hydrochloride; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α CRE, cAMP response element; 8-bromo-cAMP, 8-bromoadenosine 3′:5′-cyclic monophosphate.

ACTH and cAMP induced immediate early gene expression with quite different kinetics (11Kimura E. Sonobe M.H. Armelin M.C.S. Armelin H.A. Mol.

Armelin M.C.S. Armelin H.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1463-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). In addition, c-myc mRNA levels were induced by the PKC activator 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), and ACTH-induced c-myc expression was blocked by the PKC inhibitor H-7 in rat primary adrenal cell cultures (10Heikkila P.

The effects of ACTH on SAPK activity were previously unknown. ERK activity is stimulated by proliferative stimuli including growth factors and increases in intracellular Ca+2 in a cell type-specific manner (25Marshall C.J.

ERK activity induced by either epidermal growth factor or platelet-derived growth factor in fibroblast cell lines was inhibited by cAMP (25Marshall C.J.

In contrast, cAMP induced ERK activity in PC12 cells (30Frodin M. Peraldi P. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6207-6214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), rat ovarian granulosa cells (31Das E. Maizels E.T. DeManno D. St. Clair D. Adam S.A. Hunzicker-Dunn M.

Res. 1994; 75: 932-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), indicating that the effect of cAMP on ERK activity is cell type-specific. In addition to adrenal cells, ACTH receptors are expressed on a number of different cell types including lymphocytes (33Clarke B.L. Moore D.R. Blalock J.E. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1780-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), pancreatic islet cells (34Gagliardino J.J. Borelli M.I. Boschero A.C. Rojas E. Atwater I. Arch. Physiol.

Physiol. 1994; 266: E418-E426PubMed Google Scholar); thus, an understanding of intracellular signaling by ACTH may have implications in a broad array of different cell types. To understand more fully the intracellular signaling pathways governing ACTH action, we examined the effect of ACTH on the activity of the mitogen-activated protein kinases, SAPK, and ERK kinases in vivo and in cultured adrenocortical cells. Since previous studies suggested that the induction of several immediate early genes by ACTH appeared to involve mechanisms separate from the PKA pathway, we examined the regulation of immediate early gene expression and promoter activity in response to ACTH. Male CD rats (175–200 g; Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) were used for the experiments. The rats used in this study were maintained in accordance with the guidelines of the animal care committee of Northwestern University. Free-feeding rats were injected with ACTH (5 units/100 g weight; Cortrosyn, Organon, Bedford, OH) by the tail vein and sacrificed by decapitation after CO2 inhalation. Adrenals were taken at the time point indicated in the text. The adrenal cortex was dissected free from the medulla and lysed with radioimmune precipitation buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluroide, 1 μg/ml leupeptin), and the extracts were used for immune complex kinase assays and Western blotting.

The antibody-beads complexes were washed once with radioimmune precipitation buffer and incubated with 200 μg of extracts for a further 2 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed with radioimmune precipitation buffer, wash buffer (0.5 m LiCl, 0.1 m Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and kinase buffer (for SAPK: 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol; for ERK: 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 10 mmMgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The reactions were performed at 30 °C for 20 min in 40 μl of kinase buffer with 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol, 1 Ci = 37 GBq) and 2 μg of glutathione S-transferase c-Jun (1–135) protein fragment for SAPK activity or 2 μg of myelin basic protein for ERK activity. The samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis upon termination of the reaction with Laemmli buffer and boiling. The phosphorylation of glutathioneS-transferase c-Jun or myelin basic protein was quantified by densitometry using a Bio-Rad Molecular Analyst 1.1.1.

The c-myc P1/P2 promoters from −157 to +500 (41DesJardins E. Hay N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5710-5724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were linked to the pA3LUC reporter to form c-mycLUC. The cAMP-responsive chorionic gonadotropin α subunit promoter fragments linked to the luciferase reporter gene −846αLUC referred to asCRELUC and −172αLUC were previously described (42Pestell R.G.

The integrity of all constructs was determined by restriction enzyme analysis and dideoxy DNA sequencing (44Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Y1 cells were grown in Ham's F-10 medium with 1% penicillin, streptomycin, 2.5% fetal bovine serum, and 15% horse serum. 3 × 105 cells were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation, the medium was changed after 6 h, and luciferase activity was determined after a further 24 h (42Pestell R.G.

Statistical analyses were performed using the Mann WhitneyU test. To examine the effect of ACTH on adrenal cortical SAPK activity in vivo, rats were treated with intravenous ACTH. The adrenal cortex was dissected from the medulla, and immune complex kinase assays were performed using a polyclonal SAPK antibody and the amino terminus of c-Jun (amino acids 1–135) as the substrate (17Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2411) Google Scholar, 24Watanabe G. Lee R.J. Albanese C. Rainey W.E.

Ostrowski M. Jameson J.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1084-1094PubMed Google Scholar). Adrenal cortical SAPK activity was increased 2-fold at 15 min (Fig. 1 A) and 3-fold (3.1 ± 0.5, n = 5) at 30 min (Fig. 1, A andB). SAPK activity remained elevated at 1 h (3.2-fold) and at 6 h (2-fold), indicating the response to ACTH was both rapid and sustained (Fig. 1, A and B). The sustained induction of SAPK activity contrasts with the transient induction of SAPK activity we previously observed in response to growth factors (43Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Watanabe G. Lee R.J. Lastowiecki P. Zon L.I. Ostrowski M. Jameson J.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1084-1094PubMed Google Scholar). In control animals treated with intravenous saline, there was no increase in SAPK activity. In contrast with the induction of SAPK activity, ERK activity was reduced 40% at 30 min in the same ACTH-treated adrenal cortical extracts (data not shown). The effect of ACTH on SAPK and ERK activity was also determined in cultured Y1 adrenal cells. ACTH (10−6m) treatment for 30 min stimulated SAPK activity an average of 3-fold in Y1 cells (Fig.2 A). To determine the time course of SAPK induction by ACTH in Y1 cells, treatment with ACTH was conducted for 15 min to 24 h, and the cells were harvested. SAPK activity was induced 2.5-fold (n = 6, range 1.4–4-fold) within 15 min and was sustained at 2 h (Fig.2 B), returning to baseline at 6 h (data not shown). The induction of SAPK was observed at 10−8m and 10−10m ACTH (Fig. 2 B). SAPK activity was also induced by ACTH in the absence of serum (Fig.2 C). In contrast with the effect of ACTH on SAPK, ERK activity was reduced by ACTH treatment with a mean reduction of 45% at 30 min (Fig. 2, D and E). The inhibition of ERK activity by ACTH was observed at 10−6m and 10−8m ACTH (Fig. 2 E). Studies were performed to investigate the second messenger pathways regulating SAPK activity and involved in ACTH regulation of SAPK activity. In previous studies of cultured hepatocytes, heat shock and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) were shown to induce SAPK activity 4- and 5-fold, respectively (17Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2411) Google Scholar). When Y1 cells were treated with heat shock (42 °C) or TNFα (50 ng/ml) for 15 min, SAPK activity was induced 4-fold and 5-fold, respectively (Fig.3 A). ERK activity was induced 4.5-fold by heat shock but was induced only 1.5-fold by TNFα (not shown). As cAMP is activated by ACTH, the effect of cAMP on SAPK activity was determined. cAMP (10−3m) treatment was associated with a modest reduction in SAPK activity shown at 20 min (Fig. 3 B). Previous studies have demonstrated activation of the PKC pathway in ACTH-treated Y1 cells (33Clarke B.L. Moore D.R. Blalock J.E. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1780-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To examine whether activation of the PKC pathway induced SAPK activity, Y1 cells were treated with the phorbol ester TPA (100 ng/ml). SAPK activity was induced 4-fold at 15 min and 5.5-fold at 30 min (Fig. 3 C). Intracellular Ca+2 fluxes played an important role in both angiotensin II-induced SAPK activity in liver epithelial cells (19Zohn I.E. Xiong H.Y. Cox A.D. Earp H.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6160-6168Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and T cell activation of SAPK activity (22Su B. Jacinto E. Hibi M. Kallunki T. Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1994; 77: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). To examine the role of intracellular Ca+2 on SAPK activity in Y1 cells, the effect of the calcium ionophore A23187 was assessed. SAPK activity was induced 4.5-fold at 15 min and 12-fold at 30 min by A23187 (60 μm) (Fig. 3 D). Together these studies indicate that several distinct intracellular stressors induce, but that cAMP inhibits, SAPK activity in Y1 cells. To further investigate the secondary messenger pathways involved in ACTH-induced SAPK activity, chemical inhibitors of the isoquinolinesulfonamide family were used. H-8 is a preferential and potent inhibitor of PKA (K i 1.3 μm) compared with its effect against protein kinase C (K i, 15 μm) (47Ohtsuki M. Massague J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 261-265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of Y1 cells with the PKA inhibitor H-8 (3 μm) did not significantly affect ACTH-induced SAPK activity (Fig.4 A). At higher concentrations, H-8 (30 μm) inhibits the PKC pathway (48Findik D. Song Q. Hidaka H. Lavin M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 57: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and ACTH-induced SAPK activity was inhibited 40% by pretreatment with 30 μm H-8 (Fig. 4 A, lane 4). The isoquinolinesulfonamide H-89 preferentially inhibits PKA (K i, 500 nm) compared with the PKC pathway (K i, 76 μm). Pretreatment of Y1 cells with 76 μm H-89 abolished SAPK induction by ACTH (not shown). Intracellular Ca+2 levels are increased in ACTH-treated Y1 cells (33Clarke B.L. Moore D.R. Blalock J.E. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1780-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To examine the role of Ca+2 levels in ACTH-induced SAPK activity, the Ca+2 chelating agent EGTA was used. The increase in SAPK activity by ACTH was completely blocked by the addition of EGTA, suggesting that the transport of Ca+2 from the extracellular to the intracellular space may play a role in the ACTH-induced SAPK activity (Fig. 4 B,lanes 6 and 7 versus 8). Together these studies suggest SAPK activity is induced by the PKC pathway and that ACTH induction of SAPK involves both the PKC and Ca+2pathway. Because H-8 at 3 μm did not affect SAPK induction by ACTH and was used to inhibit PKA activity, we examined the effect of H-8 at this concentration on cAMP-induced activity in Y1 cells. cAMP activity was assayed using either transient reporter studies or biochemical assays. Recent studies have demonstrated the high sensitivity of a luciferase reporter system using the CRE to assay cAMP-regulated activity in cultured cells (49Christin-Maitre S. Taylor A.E. Khoury R.H.

These responses are thought to be mediated through the functional LIF receptor (LIFR), consisting of a heterodimeric complex of LIFR α-chain (LIFRα) and gp130. The present study investigated the relative capacity of the cytoplasmic domains of each receptor subunit to signal particular responses in several cell types. To monitor the signaling potential of LIFRα and gp130 individually, we constructed chimeric receptors by linking the extracellular domain of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor (GCSFR) to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions of either LIFRα or gp130. Both chimeric receptors and the full-length GCSFR in expressed in M1 myeloid leukemic cells to measure differentiation induction, in embryonic stem cells to measure differentiation inhibition, and in Ba/F3 cells to measure cell proliferation. Our results demonstrated that whereas GCSFR-gp130 receptor homodimer mediated a GCSF-induced signal in all three cell types, the GCSFR-LIFRα receptor homodimer was only functional in embryonic stem cells. These findings suggest that the signaling potential of gp130 and LIFRα cytoplasmic domains may differ depending upon the tissue and cellular response initiated.

Hilton D.J. Growth Factors and Cytokines in Health and Disease. 23. JAI Press, Greenwich, CT1997: 605-660Google Scholar). The diverse effects of LIF include both stimulation and inhibition of cellular proliferation (2Leary A.G. Wong G.G. Clark S.C. Smith A.G. Ogawa M. Blood. 1990; 75: 1960-1964Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Metcalf D. Hilton D.J. Nicola N.A.

LIF also induces macrophage differentiation in M1 myeloid leukemia cells (5Hilton D.J. Nicola N.A. Gough N.M. Metcalf D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9238-9243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas it elicits an opposite effect in embryonic stem (ES) cells, maintaining these cells in an undifferentiated, pluripotent state (6Smith A.G.

In addition to functional pleiotropy, the biological actions of LIF and related cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-11, oncostatin M (OSM), cardiotrophin-1, and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), are largely overlapping. The common activities of the LIF family of cytokines have been attributed in part to the existence of multimeric receptors, which share the affinity converting and signal transducing subunit, gp130 (8Gearing D.P.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4765-4775Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). These receptors can be divided into three distinct types (12Kishimoto T. Akira S. Narazaki M. Taga T. Blood. 1995; 86: 1243-1254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). First, LIF, OSM and cardiotrophin-1 each use receptors consisting of a heterodimeric complex of gp130 with the LIF receptor α-chain (LIFRα, sometimes known as LIFRβ). In addition, OSM has been shown to signal through an alternative receptor complex, consisting of a heterodimer of a ligand-specific subunit (OSM receptor β-chain) and gp130 (13Mosley B. De Imus C. Friend D. Boiani N. Thoma B. Park L.S. Cosman D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32635-32643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Second, CNTF binds to a ligand-specific subunit (CNTF receptor α-chain), which associates with a heterodimer of LIFRα and gp130. In contrast, functional IL-6 and IL-11 receptors are formed by the association of ligand-bound α-chains with gp130 homodimers, with no involvement of LIFRα. Unlike the ligand-binding components of the IL-6, IL-11, and CNTF receptors, which do not contribute to intracellular signaling, LIFRα contains an extensive cytoplasmic domain with a structure similar to both gp130 and the GCSFR (14Gearing D.P. Thut C.J. VandenBos T. Gimpel S.D. Delaney P.B. King J. Price V. Cosman D. Beckman M.P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2839-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). The separate contributions of the LIFRα and gp130 cytoplasmic domains to LIF-induced signal transduction have not been investigated in detail. Although it has been established that mutant LIFRα lacking a cytoplasmic domain is inactive (15Baumann H. Ziegler S.F. Mosley B. Morella K.K. Pajovic S. Gearing D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8414-8417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), its relative capacity compared with gp130 for triggering diverse biological outcomes is less well established. Both receptor subunits have the ability to associate with and activate the Janus kinases Jak1, Jak2, and Tyk2 as well as several other tyrosine kinases (16Boulton T.G. Stahl N. Yancopoulos G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11648-11655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that common signaling pathways may be triggered by each receptor component (17Stahl N. Boulton T.G. Farruggella T. Ip N.Y. Davis S. Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Silvennoinen O. Barbieri G. Pellegrini S. Ihle J.N. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1994; 263: 92-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). Despite their molecular similarity, it is possible that the two receptor chains are not functionally equivalent, with one subunit having a greater potential to transduce particular responses. Differences in the signal transduction pathways triggered by LIF-related cytokines have been implicated by previous studies (18Tanigawa T. Elwood N. Metcalf D. Cary D. DeLuca E. Nicola N.A. Begley C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7864-7868Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 19Tanigawa T. Nicola N.A. McArthur G.A. Strasser A. Begley C.G. Blood. 1995; 85: 379-390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in which enforced expression of the SCL transcription factor in M1 cells reduced the ability of these cells to differentiate in response to LIF and OSM (signaling through LIFRα-gp130 heterodimers) but not IL-6 (signaling through gp130 homodimers). In the present study, we investigated the relative potential of LIFRα, gp130, and GCSF receptor chains to signal cell type-specific responses. For this purpose, we expressed chimeric receptor constructs that comprised the extracellular domain of GCSFR and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions of either LIFRα or gp130. This approach enabled us to drive GCSF-dependent homodimerization of chimeric receptor subunits independently of endogenous receptor chains. The validity of this strategy had been established by previous studies (20Ishizaka-Ikeda E. Fukunaga R. Wood W.I. Goeddel D.V. Nagata S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Our results demonstrate that the signaling potential of LIFRα, gp130, and GCSFR homodimers varies in different cell types, with LIFRα homodimers playing an active role in suppressing ES cell differentiation but having a reduced potential to induce macrophage differentiation compared with either gp130 or GCSFR homodimers.

Nature. 1987; 326: 292-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar), were passaged in ES cell medium (DMEM containing 15% FCS, 0.1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1000 units/ml LIF) in the absence of feeder cells. Recombinant murine LIF was produced inEscherichia coli and purified as described previously (24Gearing D.P. Nicola N.A. Metcalf D. Foote S. Willson T.A. Gough N.M. Williams L. BioTechnology. 1989; 7: 1157-1161Google Scholar). Purified recombinant human GCSF, used for all biological assays, was the gift of AMGEN, and purified recombinant IL-3 was purchased from PeproTech Inc. (Rocky Hill, NJ). Mouse GCSF was produced inPichia pastoris (25Cregg J.M. Barringer K.J. Hessler A.Y. Madden K.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3376-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), purified, and then iodinated for use in binding assays. Chimeric receptors were constructed by cloning the HindIII-XbaI fragment of the murine GCSFR (26Fukunaga R. Ishizaka-Ikeda E. Seto Y. Nagata S. Cell. 1990; 61: 341-350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) into pBLUESCRIPT (SK)+. A silent mutation was then introduced at nucleotide +2045, to create a BamHI restriction enzyme site near the start of the transmembrane region (pBS/mGR(Bam)). BamHI sites were also introduced into murine gp130 at position +1851 and in human LIFRα (14Gearing D.P. Thut C.J. VandenBos T. Gimpel S.D. Delaney P.B. King J. Price V. Cosman D. Beckman M.P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2839-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar) at position +2489 by nucleotide substitution in the region immediately preceding the transmembrane domain of each molecule. Expression constructs were generated by annealing the BamHI site of the GCSFR extracellular domain with the transmembrane/cytosolic domain of either gp130 or LIFRα (construct 1) and ligating the chimeric receptor cDNA into the SalI site of the expression vector 6P-IRESneo-BS, driven by a PGK promoter (27Mountford P. Zevnik B. Duwel A. Nichols J. Li M. Dani C. Robertson M. Chambers I. Smith A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4303-4307Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). An additional GCSFR-LIFRα construct (construct 2) was generated by polymerase chain reaction amplification of a fragment of the human LIFRα cDNA containing the transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions. Polymerase chain reaction primers contained an in-frame BamHI site at the 5′ end (5′-ACGTGGATCCATCTGACGTGGGATTAATTATTGCCATT-3′) and anXbaI site at the 3′ end (5′-AGCTTCTAGACTGTTAATCGTTTGGTTTG-3′). This fragment was then inserted into BamHI-XbaI digested pBS/mGR(Bam). The GCSFR-LIFRα fragment was released by digestion withHindIII and XbaI, and the ends were filled in with Klenow (Promega) and ligated into the expression vector pEF-BOS (28Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar) using BstXI adaptors (Invitrogen). Although the two GCSFR-LIFRα constructs differed slightly, because construct 1 contained a Pro → Leu substitution at amino acid 599 and a deletion of amino acid 601 at the 3′ end of the GCSFR extracellular domain, no difference between the constructs was observed in a colony assay in the presence of GCSF following stable transfection of M1 cells. Similarly, ES cells were transfected with both constructs, and expression of either construct was found to confer a GCSF-responsive phenotype in these cells. The sequence of all chimeric constructs was verified using an ABI PRISM Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Perkin-Elmer) and a model 373 Automated DNA Sequencer (Perkin-Elmer). cDNA encoding the full-length human GCSFR (a gift from S. Nagata, Osaka Bioscience Institute) was cloned into the XbaI site of the pEF-BOS expression vector. The pHCK-hprt plasmid was created by substituting the PGK promoter in the PGK-hprt expression cassette of pGEM-7Z with anXhoI-BamHI fragment of the murine hckpromoter, encompassing the region between −645 and +240 relative to the major transcription initiation site (29Lock P. Stanley E. Holtzman D.A. Dunn A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4602-4811Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). M1 and Ba/F3 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing either full-length GCSFR, GCSFR-LIFRα (construct 2), or GCSFR-gp130 by electroporation, essentially as described (11Hilton D.J. Hilton A.A. Raicevic A. Rakar S. Harrison-Smith M. Gough N.M. Begley C.G. Metcalf D. Nicola N.A. Willson T.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4765-4775Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Receptor constructs were cotransfected with the pPGKPuropA expression vector (kindly provided by Prof. S. Cory), and transfected cells were selected with 20 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma). For all transfected cell lines, expression of the receptors was determined by assessing the ability of cells to bind125I-GCSF. HCK-hprt ES cells were obtained by transfection of parental hprt− ES cells with the expression plasmid pHCK-hprt. Cells were selected in HAT medium (100 μm hypoxanthine, 0.4 μm aminopterin, 16 μm thymidine). Individual resistant colonies were expanded and tested for HAT sensitivity after a 5-day induction of cellular differentiation in the absence of LIF. ES cells expressing chimeric constructs were obtained by electroporation of HCK-hprt cells with the 6P-IRESneo-BS-based expression constructs (Bio-Rad Gene Pulser; 270 V, 500 microfarad), followed by selection for 7 days in 175 μg/ml Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.). ES cells were transfected with the GCSFR-LIFR construct 1. ES cell lines expressing the full-length GCSFR were obtained by co-electroporation with the plasmid PGKneo (30Tybulewic V.L.J. Crawford C.E. Jackson P.K. Bronson R.T. Mulligan R.C. Cell. 1991; 65: 1153-1163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). Several independently derived M1, Ba/F3, and ES cloned cell lines expressing each receptor construct were selected for further analysis. To quantitate the differentiation of transfected M1 clones in response to cytokine, 300 cells were cultured in 35-mm Petri dishes containing 1 ml of DMEM supplemented with 20% FCS, 0.3% agar, and 0.1 ml of serial dilutions of LIF or GCSF. Cultures were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 10% CO2 for 7 days. The dishes were then scored for the percentage of differentiated colonies, as judged by colonies with a halo of dispersed cells. The total number of colonies was also determined to assess the degree to which proliferation had been extinguished by the addition of the cytokine. The extent to which cytokine-mediated signaling prevents ES cell differentiation was determined by both morphology (as described previously; Refs. 31Ernst M. Gearing D.P. Dunn A.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1574-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar and 32Ernst M. Oates A. Dunn A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30136-30143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and MTT staining of undifferentiated, proliferating cells after HAT selection. For the MTT assay, cells were seeded in quadruplicate cultures at 1500 cells/cm2 in gelatinized 24-well multiculture dishes (Nunc, Kamstrup, Denmark). Cells were grown for 6 days at the indicated concentration of GCSF in the absence of LIF, in medium supplemented with 2 × HAT. At this time, >95% of the morphologically differentiated cells had died. The cultures were then supplied with 0.5 mg/ml MTT and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C, after which the aspirated cultures were air-dried. The reduced MTT dye was solubilized in Me2SO, and the optical absorbance was measured at 560 nm and expressed as a percentage of the maximal absorbance measured in undifferentiated cultures maintained in 2.5 ng/ml LIF. The survival/proliferation of Ba/F3 cells in response to cytokine was measured in Lux 60 microwell HL-A plates (Nunc Inc., Roskilde, Denmark). Cells were washed three times in DMEM containing 20% newborn calf serum and resuspended at a concentration of 2 × 104 cells/ml in the same medium. Aliquots of 10 μl of cell suspension were placed in the culture wells with 5 μl of serial dilutions of 1 ng/ml IL-3 or 100 ng/ml GCSF. After a 2-day culture at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 10% CO2, viable cells were counted using an inverted microscope. Assays were performed as described previously (33Novak U. Harpur A.G. Paradiso L. Kanagasundaram V. Jaworowski A. Wilks A.F. Hamilton J.A. Blood. 1995; 86: 2948-2956Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), using the high affinity c-sis-inducible factor binding site m67 (34Wakao H. Gouilleux F. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2182-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). Protein extracts were prepared from M1 cells incubated with saline, 10 ng/ml LIF, or 100 ng/ml GCSF for 10 min at 37 °C. For ES cells, cultures consisting of approximately 8 × 107 undifferentiated ES cells were starved overnight in ES cell medium free of serum and LIF before being stimulated for 10 min at 37 °C with saline, 10 ng/ml LIF, or 100 ng/ml GCSF. For certain experiments, protein samples were preincubated with antibodies specific for either STAT1 (Transduction Laboratories), STAT3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., CA), or STAT5A (specific for the C terminus, a gift from Dr. A. Mui, DNAX Research Institute, Palo Alto, CA) as described (33Novak U. Harpur A.G. Paradiso L. Kanagasundaram V. Jaworowski A. Wilks A.F. Hamilton J.A. Blood. 1995; 86: 2948-2956Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Binding assays were performed essentially as described (35Hilton D.J. Nicola N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10238-10247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 2 × 106cells in 40 μl of RPMI 1640 medium containing 20 mmHepes, pH 7.4, and 10% FCS were incubated for 3 h on ice with varying amounts of 125I-GCSF in the presence or the absence of 100-fold excess of unlabeled GCSF. Cell-associated and free125I were then separated by rapid centrifugation of the cell suspension through 200 μl of FCS. The amount of 125I in the cell pellet and the supernatant was quantitated in a γ-counter. Scatchard analysis of saturation binding isotherms were performed using the computer program LIGAND (36Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7772) Google Scholar). Stimulation of M1 myeloid cells with LIF or IL-6 induces macrophage differentiation and an inhibition of cellular proliferation (5Hilton D.J. Nicola N.A. Gough N.M. Metcalf D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9238-9243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). M1 cells were transfected with either the GCSFR-LIFRα, GCSFR-gp130, or wild type GCSFR constructs, and the expression of these receptors was confirmed by the ability of the transfected cells to bind 125I-GCSF (TableI). The capacity of the transfected cells to differentiate in response to GCSF was assessed by semi-solid agar colony assays. Untransfected parental M1 cells failed to respond to GCSF, and all cell lines expressing the chimeric receptors responded normally to LIF (data not shown). M1 cells expressing either full-length GCSFR (Fig. 1 A) or GCSFR-gp130 (Fig. 1 C) responded to GCSF in a similar manner, with complete differentiation and clonal extinction at higher concentrations of cytokine. In contrast, we were unable to detect a GCSF-induced response by cells expressing GCSFR-LIFRα receptors, because neither differentiation nor clonal suppression of M1 cells expressing these receptors was evident (Fig. 1 B). The expression of characteristic macrophage markers, including Fcγ receptor types I and II, Mac-1, and the macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor, was also assessed in these cells in an effort to determine whether any aspects of differentiation were induced in response to GCSF. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that none of these markers were up-regulated by GCSF stimulation of these cells (data not shown). Furthermore, unlike cells expressing GCSFR, no change in expression of the flk-2 receptor was detected in cells expressing GCSFR-LIFRα in response to GCSF, as assessed byflk-2 ligand binding assays (data not shown). Thus, by all criteria examined, no evidence for the induction of differentiation through GCSFR-LIFRα receptors in M1 cells could be demonstrated. Collectively, these data suggest that homodimerization of GCSFR or gp130 cytoplasmic domains, but not LIFRα cytoplasmic domains, is sufficient to induce macrophage differentiation in M1 cells.Table IExpression of transfected receptors and affinity of 125I-GCSF bindingReceptor constructM1 cellsES cellsBa/F3 cellsNo. of receptors/cellBinding affinityNo. of receptors/cellBinding affinityNo. of receptors/cellBinding affinitypmpmpmGCSFR wild type9359163ND1-aND, not determined.ND452497GCSFR-LIFR30301101060280963303GCSFR-gp130260011008504307633501-a ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab In previous studies, the degree of cellular differentiation of ES cells in vitro had been quantitated primarily by morphological inspection of individual cells and colonies. To utilize a chemical selection protocol allowing for the survival of undifferentiated ES cells only, we used the observation that the murinehck gene undergoes transcriptional down-regulation following the induction of ES cell differentiation in vitro (M.E., unpublished observation). Thus, HCK-hprt ES cell lines, which contain an hprt minigene driven by an 865bp proximal hck promoter fragment, are resistant to HAT selection if they remain in an undifferentiated state. The proportion of undifferentiated, proliferating cells in an ES cell culture can then be determined by optical absorbance measurement of the reduced mitochondrial stain, MTT. Maintenance of the pluripotency of ES cells in vitronormally requires signaling initiated by the LIF family of cytokines (6Smith A.G. Heath J.K. Donaldson D.D. Wong G.G Moreau J. Stahl M. Rogers D. Nature. 1988; 336: 688-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (1483) Google Scholar, 7Williams R.L. Hilton D.J. Pease S. Willson T.A. Stewart C.L. Gearing D.P. Wagner E.F. Metcalf D. Nicola N.A. Gough N.M.

ES cell lines were transfected with either full-length GCSFR or the chimeric receptor constructs, and expression of the receptors was confirmed by the ability of transfected cells to bind125I-GCSF (Table I). In these cell lines, signaling through the endogenous LIFRα-gp130 heterodimer was normal, because culture in LIF maintained the cells in an undifferentiated state (Fig. 1,D, E, and F). The capacity of GCSF to substitute for LIF and retard differentiation of the transfected cells was assessed. The dose-response curve obtained with GCSF stimulation was similar for both the cell morphology (Fig. 1, D,E, and F) and MTT (Fig. 1, G,H, and I) assays, with a half-maximal effect at approximately 63 pm GCSF. Thus, signaling through homodimerized cytoplasmic domains of LIFRα, gp130, or GCSFR maintained up to 80% of all ES cell colonies in an undifferentiated state (Fig. 1, D–I). In contrast, parental ES cells did not respond to GCSF in either assay, indicating the absence of endogenous GCSFR expression in untransfected cells (data not shown). These data suggest that homodimerization of the cytoplasmic domains of either LIFRα or gp130 is sufficient to mediate a signal that maintains the pluripotentiality of ES cells in vitro. Futhermore, these data indicate that in addition to the LIFR, the GCSFR can transmit a signal that maintains the undifferentiated state of ES cells. The potential of LIFRα, gp130, and GCSFR cytoplasmic domains to signal a mitogenic response was determined after introduction of the receptor constructs into the IL-3-dependent cell line, Ba/F3. Transfected cells were analyzed in a proliferation assay. As shown in Fig. 1 (J,K, and L), the full-length GCSFR was able to transduce a proliferative/survival signal comparable to that elicited through the endogenous IL-3 receptor. Ba/F3 cells expressing GCSFR-gp130 showed a weaker proliferative or survival response to GCSF, whereas no GCSF-dependent proliferation or survival was observed for cells expressing the GCSFR-LIFRα chimera (Fig. 1,J, K, and L). The reduced ability of gp130 homodimers to generate a GCSF response parallels the transient response of Ba/F3 cells expressing gp130 to stimulation by IL-6 and soluble IL-6 receptor (38Murakami M. Narazaki M. Hibi M. Yawata H. Yasukawa K. Hamaguchi M. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11349-11353Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). This may be due to reduced expression of LIFRα-gp130 signaling intermediates in Ba/F3 cells compared with M1 or ES cells, both of which express endogenous LIF receptors. This hypothesis is supported by preliminary results in the IL-6-dependent plasmacytoma cell line, 7TD1, that suggest that the GCSFR-LIFRα is active in these cells (data not shown). Considering the differing potential of LIFRα, gp130, and GCSFR cytoplasmic domains to mediate cell-type specific responses, we were interested to compare the activation pattern of the Jak/STAT signaling pathway in response to receptor dimerization. To characterize the STAT complexes induced in response to GCSF, extracts of M1 and ES cells transfected with various receptor constructs were examined in electrophoretic mobility shift assays, using the high affinity c-sis-inducible factor binding sequence, m67, as a probe (34Wakao H. Gouilleux F. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2182-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). All DNA-protein interactions were specifically competed by an excess of unlabeled m67 probe (data not shown). Three main complexes were induced in M1 cells stimulated with LIF through the activation of the endogenous LIFR (Fig. 2 A). A similar pattern was observed upon GCSF stimulation of M1 cells expressing GCSFR-gp130 (Fig. 2 A) and for GCSF stimulation of M1 cells expressing wild type GCSFR (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, no m67-binding complexes were formed in response to GCSF in M1 cells expressing GCSFR-LIFRα nor in parental M1 cells (Fig. 2 A). Hence, activation of m67-binding complexes correlated with the expression of active cell surface receptors, suggesting that STAT molecules may act as downstream effectors of the response. The molecular nature of the STAT complexes was further investigated by the addition of antibodies specific for individual STAT proteins. The pretreatment of M1 cell extracts with antibodies specific for STAT1 supershifted the two minor lower bands to slower migrating complexes, indicating that these bands contain STAT1 (Fig.2 B). Similarly, the upper two bands were supershifted by the addition of an antibody recognizing STAT3 (Fig. 2 B). The most slowly migrating DNA complex was also affected by binding of an anti-STAT5A antibody, suggesting that this complex comprises a STAT3-STAT5A heterodimer. The pattern and composition of m67-binding complexes induced by either GCSF, via the introduced receptors, or LIF stimulation, through endogenous LIF receptors, were identical for M1 cells expressing either GCSFR-gp130 or wild type GCSFR (Fig.2 B). The same signaling molecules were activated by either LIF or GCSF stimulation of ES cells expressing GCSFR-gp130 (Fig.2 C). Furthermore, identical complexes were induced by GCSF stimulation of ES cells signaling through GCSFR-LIFRα (Fig.2 C). The level of STAT activation induced by this chimeric receptor was comparatively weaker, despite its comparable capacity to retard differentiation (Fig. 1, D–I). It is clear from this study that despite a high degree of sequence similarity, the signaling potential of the cytoplasmic domains of LIFRα, gp130, and GCSFR differ depending on the cell type as well as the type of biological response initiated. Differences in the signal transduction pathways triggered by gp130 homodimers and gp130-LIFRα heterodimers have previously been suggested by studies in which overexpression of SCL in M1 cells inhibited the response to LIF and OSM, which use gp130-LIFRα heterodimers, but did not affect signaling through the IL-6 receptor, which uses gp130 homodimers (18Tanigawa T. Elwood N. Metcalf D. Cary D. DeLuca E. Nicola N.A. Begley C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7864-7868Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 19Tanigawa T. Nicola N.A. McArthur G.A. Strasser A. Begley C.G. Blood. 1995; 85: 379-390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LIFRα alone may not be sufficient for transducing a differentiative signal in M1 cells nor for induction of a proliferation/survival signal in Ba/F3 cells, because homodimerized LIFRα cytoplasmic domains were unable to signal these responses independently of gp130. However, homodimers of either LIFRα or gp130 cytoplasmic domains were able to deliver the signal to block differentiation in ES cells. In addition, a previous report has demonstrated that either of these cytoplasmic domains can induce an acute phase response in hepatoma cells and mediate signaling in neuronal cells when activated as homodimers (22Baumann H. Symes A.J. Comeau M.R. Morella K.K. Wang Y. Friend D. Ziegler S.F. Fink J.S. Gearing D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 138-146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cell-specific differences in activity described here are unlikely to be due to differences in the level of receptor expression, because Scatchard analyses of binding isotherms indicated a similar level of expression of the chimeric receptors in each cell type and a comparable binding affinity for GCSF (Table I). Because none of the three cell lines express detectable levels of endogenous full-length GCSFR, dimer formation between the extracellular domains of endogenous and introduced receptor subunits should not occur. Furthermore, cooperativity between the cytoplasmic domains of introduced receptor subunits and endogenous LIFRα or gp130 is unlikely, given that the GCSFR-LIFRα receptor is unable to signal in M1 cells, which contain both endogenous LIFRα and gp130. The observed differences in signaling potential of the homodimeric cytoplasmic domains may be due to either quantitative or qualitative differences in the signaling molecules activated. First, different biological responses may require a different threshold of STAT activation to be attained, with certain responses requiring a higher level of activation. The activation of STAT molecules by homodimeric LIFRα cytoplasmic domains may fail to reach the required threshold in M1 or Ba/F3 cells for a biological response to occur, perhaps due to a reduced efficiency of the LIFRα chain to activate STATs or a reduced pool size of signaling intermediates. The number of available STAT molecules in ES cells may be greater than that in either M1 or Ba/F3 cells. Although the LIFRα chain may be less efficient at activating STATs, the increased availability of STATs, coupled with a lower threshold requirement for biological activity in these cells, could explain the ability of the GCSFR-LIFRα receptor to signal in ES cells. Alternatively, different signaling intermediates may be activated by the different receptor subunits. Activation of pathways necessary for M1 cell differentiation and Ba/F3 proliferation may require gp130 cytoplasmic sequences, whereas both LIFRα and gp130 may be able to interact with the specific cytoplasmic intermediates required for signal transduction in ES, hepatoma, and neuronal cells. Verification of this model would require the identification of the relevant signaling pathways. In either case, the results described here clearly show that LIFRα homodimers are less efficient than either gp130 or GCSFR homodimers in signaling biological responses. Further investigation of the signaling molecules activated by LIFRα and gp130 is needed to fully document the different signaling potentials of these receptor subunits. We thank L. Di Rago, S.

The aim of the present study was to determine whether PDGF could modulate insulin activation of PI 3-kinase in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. When cells were preincubated for 5–15 min with PDGF, PI 3-kinase activity associated to insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS 1) in response to insulin was decreased, due to reduced association of the PI 3-kinase p85 subunit with IRS 1. In addition, following this PDGF pretreatment, the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS 1 in response to insulin and its electrophoretic mobility were diminished. The change in the mobility of IRS 1 could be attributed to PDGF-induced serine/threonine phosphorylation of the protein which was partly inhibited by PI 3-kinase inhibitors. By contrast, epidermal growth factor, which does not stimulate PI 3-kinase, had no effect on the association of PI 3-kinase with IRS 1 in response to insulin. This series of results indicates that the PDGF-induced serine/threonine phosphorylation of IRS 1 could be due to activation of PI 3-kinase pathway. Furthermore, this phosphorylation of IRS 1 is associated with a decrease in its tyrosine phosphorylation by insulin and in its association with the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase.

Cantley L.C. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 565-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). This association leads to the stimulation of the kinase activities of the p110 subunit (6Kapeller R. Cantley L.C. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 565-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 7Dhand R. Hara K. Hiles I. Bax B. Gout I. Panayotou G. Fry M.J. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 511-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Since PI 3-kinase is activated by a large range of peptide growth factors, this enzyme activity appears to be implicated in various cellular responses including promotion of cell growth, regulation of cell differentiation, and metabolism (for review see Ref. 6Kapeller R. Cantley L.C. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 565-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Despite this, each growth factor triggers distinct and specific biological responses in each particular cell type. In the present study, we looked at the effects of a prior stimulation by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) on the further ability of insulin to activate PI 3-kinase. We took advantage of the 3T3-L1 adipocytes where PI 3-kinase can be activated by both insulin and PDGF but not by EGF (8Ricort J.-M. Tanti J.-F. Van Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Eur. J.

J. 1996; 318: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). When PDGF stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of its receptor, the p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase associates to phosphorylated Tyr-Xaa-Xaa-Met motifs of the PDGF receptor (10Fantl W.J.

In contrast, insulin activates the tyrosine kinase activity of its receptor that subsequently phosphorylates insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS 1) on YMXM motifs allowing binding of p85 to IRS 1 and PI 3-kinase activation (12Myers Jr., M.G.

Our data show that pretreatment with PDGF decreases the ability of insulin to phosphorylate IRS 1 on tyrosine residues and consequently decreases both the amount of the p85 subunit and the PI 3-kinase activity associated with IRS 1. These results demonstrate that, in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, a cross-talk exists between the pathways stimulated by PDGF and insulin. This phenomenon could play a role in the regulation of the cell responses to growth factors and may explain the modulation of the cellular responses to different stimuli. Antibodies to IRS 1 were obtained from a rabbit injected with a peptide corresponding to the sequence comprising amino acids 489–507 of the protein and used at 1/100 dilution for immunoblotting. Antibodies used for immunoblotting of the p85 subunit of the PI 3-kinase and of phosphotyrosine-containing proteins were from UBI (Lake Placid, NY). Antibodies to phosphotyrosine used in immunoprecipitation assays were obtained after injection of a rabbit with phosphotyrosine coupled to bovine immunoglobulins. Insulin was a gift from Lilly (Paris, France). PDGF-BB was from Pepro Tech. Inc. (Rocky Hill, NJ). Bovine serum albumin was from Intergen Co. (Purchase, NY). All other biochemicals were from Sigma or Serva (Heidelberg, Germany). Radiochemicals were from ICN Pharmaceuticals (Orsay, France). 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM, 10% fetal calf serum and induced to differentiate into adipocytes as described (8Ricort J.-M. Tanti J.-F. Van Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). 3T3-L1 adipocytes were used between 8 and 12 days after initiation of differentiation, when more than 95% of the cells exhibited an adipocyte-like phenotype. Sixteen hours before each experiment, the cells were changed to serum-free DMEM supplemented with 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were pretreated at 37 °C without or with PDGF (50 ng/ml) or EGF (100 nm) for different periods. Then the cells were stimulated or not for 5 min with insulin (100 nm). The cells were solubilized for 40 min at 4 °C in 700 μl of buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 100 mm NaF, 10 mm EDTA, 2 mmNa3VO4, 10 mm pyrophosphate, 1 mm PMSF, 100 units/ml aprotinin) containing 1% Nonidet P-40 (v/v). Lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 ×g. Supernatants were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with antibodies to IRS 1 or to phosphotyrosine coupled to protein A-Sepharose beads. Immune pellets were washed twice with each of the three following buffers: (a) phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and 200 μmNa3VO4; (b) 100 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.5 m LiCl, 200 μmNa3VO4, and (c) 10 mmTris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 200 μm Na3VO4. Bead-associated PI 3-kinase activity was assayed from the phosphorylation of PI in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP as described previously (15Heydrick S.J. Jullien D. Gautier N. Tanti J.-F. Giorgetti S. Van Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 1358-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The reaction products were separated by thin layer chromatography. Quantification was performed after autoradiography by Cerenkov counting of the spot corresponding to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate. Cells were pretreated with PDGF (50 ng/ml) for different periods and then stimulated with insulin (100 nm) for 5 min. When indicated, cells were treated with 100 nm wortmannin or with 50 μm LY294002 for 20 min prior to PDGF stimulation. Then the cells were solubilized in buffer A containing 1% Nonidet P40. Cell lysates were incubated for 2 h with antibodies to IRS 1 preadsorbed on protein A-Sepharose. Pellets were washed as described above and were treated with Laemmli buffer, boiled for 10 min, and proteins analyzed by SDS-PAGE with a 7.5% acrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) sheet. The sheet was incubated with blocking buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 5% bovine serum albumin, w/v) for 2 h at room temperature and then overnight at 4 °C with antibodies to IRS 1, to the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase, or to phosphotyrosine. Membranes were washed three times (10 min each) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Nonidet P-40. When antibodies to phosphotyrosine were used, a further incubation was performed for 1 h at room temperature with rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulins. Finally, sheets were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with125I-protein A (5 × 105 cpm/ml blocking buffer) and washed as above. Blots were submitted to autoradiography. 3T3-L1 adipocytes (one 100-mm dish/condition) in phosphate-free DMEM supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin (w/v) were labeled for 2.5 h at 37 °C with [32P]orthophosphate (1 mCi/5 ml). When indicated, cells were treated with 100 nm wortmannin for 20 min prior to a 15- or 60-min stimulation with 50 ng/ml PDGF. Then the cells were stimulated or not for 5 min with 100 nm insulin. Cells were washed with ice-cold buffer A and solubilized for 40 min at 4 °C in 800 μl of buffer A supplemented with 1% Nonidet P-40 (v/v). Samples were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min. Supernatants were immunoprecipitated for 2 h at 4 °C with antibodies to IRS 1 preadsorbed on protein A-Sepharose. The immune pellets were washed as described previously, treated with Laemmli buffer, boiled for 10 min, and separated on a 7.5% acrylamide SDS-PAGE. The gel was dried and autoradiographed. We first determined the time course of PI 3-kinase activation by PDGF in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Cells were incubated for various periods with 50 ng/ml PDGF. PI 3-kinase activity was then measured in immunoprecipitates obtained with antibodies to phosphotyrosine (Fig. 1). PDGF maximally stimulated the PI 3-kinase activity between 5 and 15 min of stimulation. Then the activity progressively decreased to 60 min. This time course of PI 3-kinase activation paralleled the tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGF receptor (Fig. 1) suggesting that PI 3-kinase activity measured in antiphosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates was due to the association of the enzyme with the tyrosine-phosphorylated PDGF receptors. By contrast, EGF did not induce change in the PI 3-kinase activity in 3T3-L1 adipocytes but was able to activate mitogen-activated protein kinase (data not shown).Figure 3Effect of PDGF on the association of insulin-induced p85 with IRS 1 and on tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS 1. Cells were incubated without (−) or with 50 ng/ml PDGF for the times indicated. Cells were then treated without (basal) or with 100 nm insulin for 5 min. Cellular homogenates were immunoadsorbed to antibodies to IRS 1. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF sheets, and immunoblotted with antibodies to the p85 subunit of the PI 3-kinase (A), phosphotyrosine (B), or to IRS 1 (C) as described in methodology. Typical autoradiograms (out of four different experiments) are presented.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 1Effect of PDGF on PI 3-kinase activity associated to phosphotyrosine-containing proteins. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated with or without 50 ng/ml PDGF for the indicated periods before homogenization and immunoprecipitation with antibodies to phosphotyrosine. PI 3-kinase assay was performed on the immune pellets as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Quantification of the PI 3-kinase product was performed by scintillation counting. Results are expressed relative to the maximal activity measured after 5 min of PDGF stimulation (bottom panel). Results are the means ± S.E. of three independent experiments. Top panel, cells were stimulated with 50 ng/ml PDGF for the times indicated. Cells were solubilized and proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE.

To test this hypothesis, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were stimulated with PDGF for different periods, before a subsequent 5-min insulin stimulation. PI 3-kinase activity was then measured in immunoprecipitates obtained with antibodies to IRS 1 (Fig.2). Insulin alone markedly increased PI 3-kinase activity associated to IRS 1 (15- ± 3-fold increase in four different experiments). When the cells were pretreated with PDGF for 5–15 min before insulin stimulation, PI 3-kinase activity associated to IRS 1 decreased. Maximal inhibition (32%) was observed after 15 min of PDGF pretreatment. No inhibition was observed at 30 min of PDGF pretreatment and PI 3-kinase activity decreased again by 30% after 60 min pretreatment. Different from the results observed with PDGF, EGF pretreatment of the cells did not modify the level of PI 3-kinase activity associated to IRS 1 in response to a subsequent insulin stimulation. The previous experiments indicate that the PI 3-kinase activity associated with IRS 1 following insulin stimulation is diminished by a PDGF pretreatment. We then wanted to determine whether it reflected a diminution of the amount of the enzyme associated with IRS 1 or an inhibition of the PI 3-kinase activity itself. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were pretreated with PDGF for different periods before insulin stimulation (5 min). Proteins were solubilized and immunoprecipitated with antibodies to IRS 1. The immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. The PI 3-kinase associated with IRS 1 was detected by antibodies to its p85 subunit (Fig.3 A). In the absence of PDGF pretreatment, insulin induced the association of the PI 3-kinase p85 subunit with IRS 1. The pretreatment with PDGF for 5–60 min markedly reduced the amount of the p85 associated to IRS 1. In parallel, the tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins was visualized with an antibody to phosphotyrosine. The insulin-induced autophosphorylation of the β-subunit of its receptor was not affected by PDGF (data not shown). By contrast, a PDGF pretreatment induced a decrease in the insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS 1 (Fig. 3 B). It should be noted that PDGF did not induce any tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS 1 (data not shown and Ref. 8Ricort J.-M. Tanti J.-F. Van Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The decrease in insulin-induced IRS 1 tyrosine phosphorylation was not due to a modification in the amount of IRS 1 present in the immune pellets since it was similar in all conditions, indicating that PDGF pretreatment modified neither the total cellular amount of IRS 1 nor the ability of the antibody to immunoprecipitate IRS 1 (Fig. 3 C). PDGF induced an increase in the apparent molecular weight of IRS 1, which was similar to that induced by insulin (Fig. 3 C). To test whether the slower IRS 1 electrophoretic migration in PDGF-treated cells was due to a change in its phosphorylation state, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate. Cells were then stimulated for 15 or 60 min without or with PDGF (50 ng/ml), before insulin treatment (100 nm, 5 min). At the end of the incubation, the proteins were solubilized and subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies to IRS 1. Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography (Fig.4). A low level of IRS 1 phosphorylation was observed in basal conditions. Both insulin and PDGF induced the incorporation of [32P]orthophosphate into IRS 1 (2.5- and 2-fold increase, respectively). Since insulin (Fig. 3), but not PDGF (data not shown and Ref. 8Ricort J.-M. Tanti J.-F. Van Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS 1, these results suggest that the phosphorylation occurred mostly on tyrosine residues in the presence of insulin and on serine/threonine residues following PDGF stimulation. Furthermore, the phosphorylations induced by insulin and PDGF were not additive since an acute insulin stimulation after a PDGF pretreatment did not markedly increase32P incorporation into IRS 1. These results indicate that PDGF treatment could induce the phosphorylation of IRS 1 in intact cells on serine/threonine residues and decreased its ability to be tyrosine-phosphorylated by insulin and thus to bind the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase. We then looked at the possibility that PI 3-kinase was involved in the phosphorylation of IRS 1 in response to PDGF. Indeed, PI 3-kinase is activated in response to PDGF (Refs. 8Ricort J.-M.

Cells were incubated with two pharmacological inhibitors of the enzyme, i.e. with 100 nm wortmannin or 50 μm LY294002, for 20 min prior to any incubation with PDGF or insulin (Fig.5). IRS 1 tyrosine phosphorylation was then followed by immunoblotting with antibodies to phosphotyrosine as described previously. Pretreatment of the cells with wortmannin enhanced the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS 1 induced by insulin alone, as also reported (19Li P.M. Goldstein B.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 223: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), whereas LY294002 was without effect. Pretreatment with LY294002 and wortmannin blocked the inhibitory effect of PDGF on the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS 1 induced by insulin, and concomitantly, they prevented the electrophoretic mobility shift induced by PDGF (Fig. 5). When cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate as described above, wortmannin markedly inhibited, by 80%, the serine/threonine phosphorylation induced by PDGF (Fig. 6).Figure 6Effect of wortmannin on the PDGF-induced phosphorylation of IRS 1. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were labeled for 2.5 h with [32P]orthophosphate. Cells were treated for 20 min without or with with 100 nm wortmannin (W) and incubated for 15 min with or without 50 ng/ml PDGF (P) as indicated in legend to Fig. 4. Cells were homogenized and immunoprecipitated with antibodies against IRS 1, and immune pellets were analyzed for 32P content as described in legend to Fig. 4.

PI 3-kinase is involved in multiple signaling pathways (20Downes C.P. Carter A.N. Cell. Signalling. 1991; 3: 501-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), such as those activated by insulin and PDGF. Activation of this enzyme results from the association of the p85 subunit of the PI 3-kinase to tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS 1 in response to insulin (12Myers Jr., M.G. Backer J.M. Sun X.J.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1373-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Here we have taken advantage of 3T3-L1 adipocytes, which express insulin, PDGF, and EGF receptors, to show that a pretreatment of the cells with PDGF, but not with EGF, decreased the PI 3-kinase activity and the amount of p85 subunit associated with IRS 1 in response to a subsequent insulin stimulation. This effect was rapid, since it occurred after a very short PDGF treatment (5–15 min). Moreover, in PDGF-treated cells, the insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS 1 was reduced, and this could explain the lower amount of p85 subunit associated with IRS 1 in response to insulin. The decrease in IRS 1 tyrosine phosphorylation was not due to an inhibition of insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity since PDGF treatment did not modify the insulin-induced autophosphorylation of the receptor. By contrast, PDGF treatment lowered the electrophoretic mobility of IRS 1, the likely consequence of a phosphorylation of IRS 1 following PDGF treatment. Since PDGF did not induce any tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS 1 (data not shown and Ref. 8Ricort J.-M. Tanti J.-F. Van Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), the shift can only result from an increase in the serine/threonine phosphorylation of IRS 1 following PDGF treatment. These results are reminiscent of previous studies using okadaic acid (22Tanti J.-F. Grémeaux T. Van Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6051-6057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or tumor necrosis factor-α (23Kanety H. Feinstein R. Papa M.Z. Hemi R. Karasik A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23780-23784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 24Hotamisligil G.S. Peraldi P. Budavari A. Ellis R. White M.F. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1996; 271: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (2203) Google Scholar) agents which simultaneously increase IRS 1 serine/threonine phosphorylation and decrease insulin-stimulated IRS 1 tyrosine phosphorylation. It is thus tempting to think that the stimulation of IRS 1 serine/threonine phosphorylation induced by PDGF treatment was responsible for the inhibition of insulin-induced IRS 1 tyrosine phosphorylation. The mechanism by which the serine/threonine phosphorylation of IRS 1 could modulate its tyrosine phosphorylation is not well defined. In the case of tumor necrosis factor-α treatment, it was proposed that the phosphorylated form of IRS 1 could act as an inhibitor of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity (24Hotamisligil G.S. Peraldi P. Budavari A. Ellis R. White M.F. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1996; 271: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (2203) Google Scholar). This explanation seems unlikely in the present study since insulin receptor autophosphorylation was not altered by a PDGF pretreatment (data not shown). When cells were treated with okadaic acid, the tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin receptor was not changed, but the serine/threonine-phosphorylated form of IRS 1 had a decreased ability to interact with the insulin receptor (22Tanti J.-F. Grémeaux T. Van Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6051-6057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it has been proposed that the phosphorylation of the serine residues of IRS 1, in the proximity of the tyrosine residues involved in the binding of PI 3-kinase, could decrease the association between PI 3-kinase and IRS 1 (25Mothe I. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11222-11227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Such a mechanism could be involved in the effect we observed in PDGF-treated cells. Several studies have focused on the identification of kinases involved in the serine/threonine phosphorylation of IRS 1. Casein kinase II (26Tanasijevic M.J. Myers Jr., M.G. Thoma S. Crimmins D.L. White M.J. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18157-18166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the serine kinase activity of PI 3-kinase (16Tanti J.-F. Grémeaux T. Van Obberghen E.

Commun. 1995; 206: 272-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) have been shown to phosphorylate IRS 1 in vitro. A series of data argue for a role of PI 3-kinase in the phosphorylation of IRS 1 following PDGF stimulation. First, EGF, which is unable to activate PI 3-kinase in 3T3-L1 adipocytes but which activates multiple other signaling pathways such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase cascade, does not modify the insulin-induced PI 3-kinase activity associated with IRS 1. Second, the serine/threonine phosphorylation of IRS 1 induced by PDGF is partly inhibited by two pharmacological inhibitors of PI 3-kinase as indicated by the reversal of the mobility shift of IRS 1 or by the cell orthophosphate labeling experiments. These data thus suggest that PI 3-kinase can induce a serine/threonine phosphorylation of IRS 1 not only in vitro in immunoprecipitates obtained from insulin-stimulated cells (16Tanti J.-F. Grémeaux T. Van Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 17Lam K. Carpenter C.L. Ruderman N.B. Friel J.C. Kelly K.L. J. Biol.

Commun. 1995; 206: 272-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) but also in cells stimulated by PDGF. It is also possible that the phosphorylation of IRS 1 observed after a PDGF treatment results from the activation of another serine kinase(s) activated by the PI 3-kinase pathway. Indeed, novel serine/threonine kinases, targets of PI 3-kinase, such as the protein kinase B (27Cross D.A.E. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M.

Serine kinase activities, independent of the PI 3-kinase pathway, could also participate in the phosphorylation of IRS 1 since the PDGF-induced phosphorylation of IRS 1 was not completely blocked by wortmannin. Further studies are necessary to identify the enzyme implicated in the serine/threonine phosphorylation of IRS 1. The decrease in insulin-induced PI 3-kinase activity associated with IRS 1 was the likely consequence of the reduced IRS 1 tyrosine phosphorylation at early time points of PDGF pretreatment. However, other mechanisms could be involved in such an effect. Indeed, it has been shown that the p85 subunit becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated after a PDGF stimulation (32Kavanaugh W.M. Klippel A. Escobedo J.A. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3415-3424Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 33Domin J. Dhand R. Waterfield M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21614-21621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and that this tyrosine phosphorylation decreased its ability to associate with tyrosine-containing proteins such as the activated PDGF receptor. Such an hypothesis is unlikely in our case since we never observed such a tyrosine phosphorylation of p85 in our cell line. It is also possible that the activated PDGF receptor binds a large amount of p85 subunit following PDGF stimulation thus decreasing, by a competitive process, the amount of p85 available to associate with IRS 1 after insulin stimulation. Indeed, a displacement of PI 3-kinase from the PDGF receptors toward IRS 1 following insulin stimulation occurred in a recent study (34Levy-Toledano R. Blaettler D.H. LaRochelle W.J. Taylor S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30018-30022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) performed with cells transfected by high levels of insulin receptors while only the endogenous PDGF receptors were present. The present series of experiments has been performed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, expressing only the endogenous insulin and PDGF receptors. Since it has recently been shown in NIH 3T3 cells that only 5% of the total pool of p85α associated with the PDGF receptor (33Domin J. Dhand R. Waterfield M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21614-21621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), this hypothesis is not very plausible to explain our results. It is still unknown why PI 3-kinase activity associated with IRS 1 returned to maximally insulin-stimulated values after 30 min of PDGF pretreatment. This occurred although serine/threonine phosphorylation of IRS 1 by PDGF was maintained for at least 60 min, concomitant with a constant decrease in the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS 1 and of its association with the p85 subunit. The reason for this observation is still unclear. Our results clearly show that intercommunications exist between the different growth factors and hormones signaling pathways. Enzymes common to multiple pathways, such as the PI 3-kinase, create the possibility of many different types of interactions among the various pathways. The diversity of these interactions could result in additive, synergistic, or antagonistic effects. The studies of such cross-talks between the different signaling pathways should be new approaches to understand the physiological significance of such events. We thank T.

Previous work has suggested that the p300 family of transcriptional coactivators plays an important role in preventing the re-initiation of DNA synthesis in terminally differentiated cardiac myocytes. In this study, we investigated whether p300 proteins are also involved in the transcriptional activation of cell type-specific genes in these cells. Since p300 function can be abrogated through direct binding by the adenovirus E1A protein, we overexpressed E1A in cardiac myocytes using recombinant adenoviral vectors. The expression of transfected reporter genes driven by α- or β-myosin heavy chain promoters was markedly diminished by expression of the 12 S E1A protein. In contrast, the activity of a promoter derived from the ubiquitously expressed β-actin gene was affected only modestly. While an E1A mutant unable to bind members of the retinoblastoma family of pocket proteins decreased the activity of α- and β-myosin heavy chain promoters to nearly the same extent as wild type 12 S E1A, transcriptional repression by a mutant defective for p300 binding was severely impaired. Furthermore, overexpression of p300 and, to an even greater extent, p300del33, a mutant lacking residues required for binding by E1A, relieved E1A's repression of β-myosin heavy chain promoter activity while having no effect on the activity of the β-actin promoter. Thus, E1A's transcriptional repression of cell type-specific genes in cardiac myocytes is mediated through its binding of p300 proteins, and these proteins appear to be involved in maintaining both cell type-specific gene expression and cell cycle arrest in cardiac myocytes.

Cardiac myocytes are striated muscle cells whose structural and functional properties are especially suited to maintain normal blood flow. These cells differentiate from progenitors in the lateral plate mesoderm (Ref. 1Rawles M.E. Physiol. Zool. 1943; 16: 22-42Crossref Google Scholar; reviewed in Ref. 2Litvin J. Montgomery M. Gonzalez-Sanchez A. Bisaha J.G. Bader D. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1992; 2: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) ∼7.5–8.0 days post-coitum in the mouse. Differentiation is marked by the activation of muscle-specific genes, formation of sarcomeres, and onset of rhythmic contractions. In contrast to skeletal myogenesis, differentiation and proliferation in the cardiac myocyte lineage are not mutually exclusive; at least a subset of differentiated cardiac myocytes continues to undergo cell division (3Goldstein M.A. Claycomb W.C. Schwartz A. Science. 1974; 183: 212-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Beginning in mid-gestation, however, increasing proportions of these cells arrest irreversibly in G1 of the cell cycle. DNA synthesis is undetectable in most cardiac myocytes by the end of fetal life and occurs rarely, if at all, after the third postnatal week in the rat (4Claycomb W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 3229-3335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Rumyantsev P.P. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1977; 51: 187-273Crossref Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Although cardiac myocytes retain considerable plasticity to undergo further modifications in gene expression, morphology, and function (reviewed in Ref. 6Chien K.R. Zhu H. Knowlton K.U. Miller-Hance W. Am. Rev. Physiol. 1993; 55: 77-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), their identity as post-mitotic heart muscle cells is fixed following terminal differentiation. The molecular mechanisms that induce pre-cardiac mesoderm to differentiate into cardiac myocytes and subsequently maintain these cells in a differentiated state are poorly understood. Clues about cellular proteins that regulate aspects of striated muscle differentiation have been provided by the effects of the adenovirus E1A oncoprotein in these cells. E1A blocks the differentiation of skeletal myocytes from their myoblast precursors (7Webster K.A. Muscat G.E.O. Kedes L.

E1A interacts with several cellular proteins including members of the p300 family of transcriptional coactivators and the retinoblastoma (Rb) family of pocket proteins (reviewed in Ref. 16Moran E. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1993; 3: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). E1A mutants defective for binding these proteins are less efficient than wild type at stimulating DNA synthesis and repressing muscle-specific gene expression in cardiac myocytes (14Kirshenbaum L.A. Schneider M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7791-7794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar,15Liu Y. Kitsis R.N. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These experiments suggest that E1A's effects on cardiac myocyte differentiation are mediated through its interactions with these cellular proteins. Although analyses of E1A mutants offer a starting point from which to understand the roles of cellular proteins in cardiac myocyte differentiation, these studies are limited in two respects. First, they provide only correlative information. Second, the multifunctional nature of the E1A protein makes it difficult to attribute a given effect to a specific cellular protein. Therefore, the goal of the current study was to use a more direct approach to determine whether the p300 family of proteins is involved in maintaining the cardiac myocyte phenotype. We chose to focus on p300 because, in our previous work, the E1A mutant unable to bind this protein was most defective in its ability to stimulate DNA synthesis in cardiac myocytes (15Liu Y. Kitsis R.N. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).

Currently, nothing is known about which transcription factors interact with and transactivate through p300 proteins in cardiac myocytes. In addition to their possible “bridging function,” p300 proteins possess intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity (37Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2402) Google Scholar, 38Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1996; 384: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1533) Google Scholar), which is hypothesized to promote a locally “open” and transcriptionally active chromatin configuration. We demonstrate here that E1A differentially represses the expression of cell type-specific genes in cardiac myocytes and E1A's ability to bind p300 correlates with this function. Furthermore, E1A's repression is rescued partially by overexpression of p300 and to levels exceeding those observed in the absence of E1A by a p300 mutant lacking an E1A-binding domain. In contrast, E1A's mild repression of a ubiquitously active promoter is not relieved by overexpression of this construct. These data demonstrate that E1A's transcriptional repression of cell type-specific genes in cardiac myocytes is mediated through p300 protein(s) and suggest that this family of coactivators plays a role in the transcription of these genes in the absence of E1A. Mutant human type 5 adenoviruses lacking a functional E3 gene were used throughout these experiments.dl520E1B− and its derivatives (Ref. 39Howe J.A. Mymryk J.S. Egan C. Branton P.E. Bayley S.T. Proc.

Cultures of primary rat cardiac myocytes were prepared from the hearts of embryonic day 20 Sprague-Dawley fetuses (Taconic Farms) as described (15Liu Y. Kitsis R.N. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). After cells were pre-plated for 1 h to minimize fibroblast contamination (typically 5–10% following this step), myocytes were plated at a density of 700/mm2 onto 60-mm dishes (Primaria, Falcon) and cultured at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in media containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). Thirty-six hours after plating, transfections were performed using DEAE-dextran as described previously (44Straceski A.J. Geisterfer-Lowrance A. Seidman C.E. Seidman J.G. Leinwand L.A. Proc. Natl.

Briefly, cells were incubated for 1 h in serum-free media with DEAE-dextran (500 μg/ml) and the DNAs to be transfected (see figure legends for combinations and doses) following which they were incubated for 2 min with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide and for 3 h with 100 nm chloroquine. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were infected with adenovirus at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i) of 1 or 10 plaque forming units (pfu) per cell as specified in a volume of 1 ml for 60-mm plates at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 1.5 h (45Kass-Eisler A.A.

Twenty-four hours after infection (48 h after transfection), cells were harvested and luciferase and CAT activities were determined as described (46Kitsis R.N. Buttrick P.M. Kass A.A. Kaplan M.L.

The relative luciferase activity was calculated from the ratio of luciferase minus background/CAT minus background and expressed as the mean ± S.E. Groups were compared using the unpaired, two-tailed t test and differences considered significant if p < 0.05. Extracts from primary cultures of cardiac myocytes were immunoprecipitated using either anti-human p300 monoclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) or normal mouse serum in low stringency buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 0.15m NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin (Sigma) and leupeptin (Sigma), and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma)) for 16 h at 4 °C and incubated with protein A beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The precipitate was washed four times in the same buffer, resuspended in 50 μl of SDS lysis buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 0.5% SDS, 1 mm dithiothreitol), heated to 95 °C for 2 min, electrophoresed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel (12%), transferred to Immobilon membranes, reacted with adenovirus E1A monoclonal antibody (Oncogene Science) which was subsequently detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. Signals were detected using the ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham) according to the manufacture's instruction. Northern blot analysis of 10 μg of total RNA was performed as described previously (47Kitsis R.N. Buttrick P.M. NcNally E.M. Kaplan M.L. Leinwand L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Aci. U. S.

Previously, we demonstrated that expression of E1A is sufficient to stimulate DNA synthesis in embryonic day 20 (E20) cardiac myocytes, most of which had already undergone cell cycle arrest (15Liu Y.

This occurs in essentially all successfully infected cells within 24 h of the addition of adenovirus to cultures. E1A can also induce apoptosis in these cells; this process, however, is not evident until at least 36 h after infection. Previous studies in a variety of cell types, including immortal skeletal muscle lines and primary cultures of neonatal cardiac myocytes, have shown that expression of E1A represses the transcription of cell type-specific genes (7Webster K.A.

To determine if it has a similar effect in our system, we transfected E20 cardiac myocytes with luciferase constructs driven by promoters derived from the α- or β-myosin heavy chain (MHC) genes, whose expression is limited to striated muscle cells, or the β-actin gene, which is ubiquitously expressed. A CAT reporter driven by the constitutively active RSV promoter was co-transfected to control for transfection efficiency. Twenty-four hours after transfection, plates were infected with one of two adenoviruses: dl520E1B−, which expresses the wild type 12 S E1A or dl70-3, which does not. These viruses are otherwise identical. Activities of reporter genes were assayed 24 h following infection. As shown in Fig.1 A, activities of α- and β-MHC promoters were 95 and 98% lower, respectively, in cardiac myocytes infected withdl520/E1B− as compared with dl70-3 (both m.o.i. 10). In contrast, the activity of the β-actin promoter was ∼35% lower in cells infected withdl520/E1B− as compared with dl70-3 (both m.o.i. 10). Thus, E1A represses the activity of both cell type-specific and ubiquitously active promoters in E20 cardiac myocytes; the magnitude of repression, however, is considerably more marked in the case of cell type-specific promoters. To investigate further whether β-MHC and β-actin promoters have different sensitivities to E1A's transcriptional repression, we assessed whether differences in this parameter would be even more exaggerated when viruses were delivered at a lower m.o.i. We chose m.o.i. 1 because the percentage of cardiac myocytes exhibiting positive immunostaining for E1A following infection withdl520E1B− at this m.o.i., 80–90%, is similar to that observed at m.o.i. 10 (data not shown). At m.o.i. 1, β-MHC promoter activity was repressed 67% while that of the β-actin promoter was affected only minimally (Fig. 1 B). Thus, the muscle specific β-MHC promoter is more sensitive than the ubiquitously active β-actin promoter to transcriptional repression by E1A. Previously, we had observed that an E1A mutant defective for binding members of the p300 family was considerably less efficient than wild type 12 S E1A at inducing DNA synthesis in E20 cardiac myocytes (15Liu Y. Kitsis R.N. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In contrast, a second E1A mutant that was defective for pocket protein binding was as active as wild type in this function. To determine whether the ability to bind p300 family members also correlates with E1A's repression of cell type-specific promoters, we compared the effects of wild type 12 S E1A and each of the above mutants on the transcriptional activities of α- and β-MHC promoters in E20 cardiac myocytes. To confirm that the mutants exhibited the appropriate p300 binding properties in cardiac myocytes, lysates of cells infected with each of the viruses were immunoprecipitated with an antibody that reacts with both p300 and CBP. Western blots of these immunoprecipitates were then reacted with an antibody monospecific for E1A (Fig.2 A). As expected, E1A co-immunoprecipitated with p300 proteins in plates infected withdl520E1B−, encoding wild type 12 S E1A (lane 2), and dl1108/520E1B−, encoding the mutant unable to bind pocket proteins (lane 4). In contrast, E1A was not present in plates infected withdl1101/520E1B−, encoding the E1A mutant defective for p300/CBP binding (lane 3). E1A was also absent from plates infected with dl70-3, which does not produce an E1A protein (lane 1), and from plates infected withdl520E1B− when normal mouse serum was substituted for anti-p300 in the immunoprecipitation (lane 5). Thus, dl1101/520E1B−, but notdl520E1B− ordl1108/520E1B−, is defective for binding p300 family proteins in cardiac myocytes. Immunoblots were also performed on cellular lysates (without prior p300 immunoprecipitation) to confirm that similar E1A levels resulted from infection with each of the viruses (lanes 6–9). Since the infection efficiencies of each of the viruses in cardiac myocytes are also similar (data not shown), it follows that the levels of E1A per myocyte are similar.Figure 2E1A's repression of muscle-specific genes correlates with its ability to bind p300. Panel A, ability of E1A mutants to bind p300 proteins and relative levels of E1A mutants following infection with adenoviruses expressing each. Lanes 1–5, cardiac myocytes infected with dl70-3 (lane 1), dl520E1B− (lanes 2 and5), dl1101/520E1B− (lane 3), or dl1108/520E1B− (lane 4) were immunoprecipitated with either normal mouse serum (NMS, lane 5) or an antibody that recognizes both p300 and CBP (lanes 1–4). Immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidine difluoride membranes, and probed with anti-E1A antibody. Lanes 6–10, lysates of cardiac myocytes infected with dl70-3 (lane 6),dl520E1B− (lane 7),dl1101/520E1B− (lane 8), ordl1108/520E1B− (lane 9) were immunoblotted with anti-E1A antibody. Panel B, effect of E1A mutants on the activities of α- and β-MHC promoters in cardiac myocytes. This experiment was performed and the data expressed as described in the legend to Fig. 1 with all adenoviruses infected at m.o.i 10 pfu/cell. The data presented in panel B show the combined results from three independent preparations of cells each performed in duplicate. Panel C, Northern analysis of the effect of E1A mutants on the expression of endogenous β-MHC and β-actin genes. RNA was harvested 24 h after infection with dl70-3 (lane 1),dl520E1B− (lane 2),dl1101/520E1B− (lane 3), anddl1108/520E1B− (lane 4) at m.o.i 10 pfu/cell. Rows labeled β-MHC and β-actin show representative autoradiograms following sequential hybridizations of the same blot with radiolabeled probes specific for β-MHC and β-actin transcripts. The 28 S rRNA bands on the ethidium bromide stained gel are shown to indicate the equivalency of loading.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 2 B shows the effect of the various E1A mutants on the transcriptional activities of transfected α- and β-MHC promoters. The most striking finding is thatdl1101/520E1B−, encoding the E1A mutant defective for binding p300 family members, is severely disabled in repressing the activities of either promoter. In contrast,dl1108/520E1B−, encoding the E1A mutant defective for pocket protein binding, represses the activities of these promoters almost as efficiently as wild type 12 S E1A. Thus, E1A's trans-repression function correlates with its ability to bind p300 family members. We also examined the effects of wild type and mutant forms of E1A on the expression of the endogenous cardiac β-MHC and β-actin genes. As shown in Fig. 2 C, the expression of the cell type-specific β-MHC gene was markedly reduced in cardiac myocytes infected with dl520E1B− (lane 2) ordl1108/520E1B− (lane 4) as compared with cells infected with dl70-3 (lane 1). Infection with dl1101/520E1B− (lane 3), on the other hand, affected the expression of the β-MHC gene minimally. In contrast to the β-MHC gene, the expression of the ubiquitously active β-actin gene was affected only moderately by the adenoviruses. Thus, E1A-induced changes in the expression of the endogenous β-MHC and β-actin genes closely parallel alterations in the activities of their respective promoters. To test whether a causal connection exists between E1A's repression of cell type-specific promoters and its binding to p300 proteins, we assessed the effect of overexpression of p300 on this transcriptional repression. To augment p300 levels in the cell, we overexpressed either full-length p300 (p300wt) or a p300 mutant that lacks residues required for E1A binding and can, therefore, avoid sequestration by E1A (p300del33 in Ref. 17Eckner R. Ewen M.E. Newsome D. Gerdes M. DeCarpio J.A. Lawrence J.B. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 869-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). While both p300 and p300del33 diminish E1A's repression of β-MHC promoter activity, the effect is more marked with p300del33 (Fig. 3). Relief of repression is incomplete when viruses are infected at m.o.i. 10; at m.o.i. 1, however, p300 effects nearly complete rescue and p300del33 stimulates β-MHC promoter activity to levels exceeding control. Increases in β-MHC promoter activity due to p300del33 occur in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast to its effects on β-MHC promoter activity, p300del33 has no effect on E1A's mild repression of the β-actin promoter. Thus, exogenous p300 can bypass E1A's transcriptional repression of cell type-specific promoters and this effect is independent of E1A binding. This result suggests that E1A's binding of p300 family member(s) is causally related to its transcriptional repression of the β-MHC promoter and that p300 proteins positively modulate the activity of this promoter. The major conclusion of this study is that E1A's transcriptional repression of cell type-specific genes in cardiac myocytes is mediated by its binding of p300 and/or related proteins. Previous work has demonstrated a correlation between the ability of E1A to bind p300 and to induce DNA synthesis efficiently in cardiac myocytes (14Kirshenbaum L.A. Schneider M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7791-7794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 15Liu Y. Kitsis R.N. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Taken together with the present study, these data support the hypothesis that member(s) of the p300 family play important role(s) in maintaining terminal differentiation in cardiac myocytes. It is possible to envisage at least two models by which the interaction between E1A and p300 might result in this effect. The most likely model, in light of p300's recognized transcriptional coactivator function, is one in which E1A sequesters p300 (and/or a p300-related protein) making it unavailable to participate in the transcriptional activation of cell type-specific genes. Strong support for the first model is provided by the ability of p300 constructs to relieve E1A's repression of the β-MHC promoter and, in particular, by the ability of p300del33 to effect this rescue independently of binding E1A. Another non-mutually exclusive model is that complexes consisting of E1A and p300 protein(s) actively participate in transcriptional repression. Our functional data neither support nor refute this model; additional biochemical experiments would be necessary to address this possibility. A corollary of the first model is that member(s) of the p300 family participate in transcriptional activation of the α- and β-MHC, and presumably other cell type-specific genes in cardiac myocytes under normal circumstances. In light of the functional redundancy that has been observed between p300 family members (21Arany Z. Newsome D. Oldread E. Livingston D.M. Eckner R. Nature. 1995; 374: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 22Lundblad J.R. Kwok R.P. Laurence M.E. Harter M.L. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1995; 374: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar), proof of this requires a cell in which the levels of all p300 family members are present in limiting quantities. Given E1A's ability to bind both p300 and CBP (21Arany Z. Newsome D. Oldread E. Livingston D.M. Eckner R. Nature. 1995; 374: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 22Lundblad J.R. Kwok R.P. Laurence M.E. Harter M.L. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1995; 374: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar), the two members of this family recognized thus far, it is likely that we have created such a cellular milieu by overexpressing E1A. In this setting, overexpression of p300 constructs augments the transcriptional activity of a β-MHC promoter. In the case of p300del33, β-MHC promoter activity increases to levels that exceed even those observed in the absence of E1A. These data are consistent with p300 family member(s) playing an important role in β-MHC transcription in normal cardiac myocytes. Other approaches to induce a deficiency of p300 family members will be useful in confirming this hypothesis. Given the potential role played by p300 protein(s) as coactivator(s) of α- and β-MHC transcription, the question arises as to which cardiac transcription factor(s) interact with and transactivate through these proteins. Included among the motifs present in the promoter sequences used in this study are binding sites for TEF-1 (50Shimizu N. Prior G. Umeda P.K. Zak R.

It will be interesting to determine whether any of these and other transcription factors interact in a functionally significant manner with p300 family members in cardiac myocytes. Of note, p300 and MEF-2 have been shown to interact in skeletal myocytes (27Eckner R. Yao T.-P. Oldread E. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2478-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 28Sartorelli V. Huang J. Hamamori Y. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1010-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Recent work has demonstrated that, in some systems, p300 protein(s) are present in the nucleus in limiting concentrations (30Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1996; 85: 403-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1926) Google Scholar) and, thus, may be well positioned to coordinate changes in the transcription of multiple genes in response to signals from the cytoplasm. Therefore, it will be important to determine which p300 family members, including possibly novel ones, are present in cardiac myocytes, what their levels are relative to each other and the proteins with which they interact, and how these interactions change in response to various developmental and physiological stimuli. Our results differ somewhat from an earlier report (14Kirshenbaum L.A. Schneider M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7791-7794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) in which an E1A mutant defective in p300 binding alone retained the ability to repress the activity of a skeletal α-actin promoter in neonatal cardiac myocytes, while a second mutant unable to bind both p300 and pocket proteins lacked transrepression function. The reason for this discrepancy is unclear but might be due to differences in the E1A mutations in the adenoviruses used in the two studies, the promoter sequences studied or the developmental state of the cells. Although the ability of p300del33 to effect a more than complete rescue of E1A's repression of β-MHC promoter activity argues that additional pocket proteins are not needed for this effect, the possibility cannot be excluded that pocket proteins play some role in activation of the β-MHC promoter. Of note, pocket proteins are required for the transcriptional activity of the skeletal myogenic determination factors (61Gu W. Schneider J.W. Condorelli G. Kaushal S. Mahdavi V. Nadal-Ginard B. Cell. 1993; 72: 309-324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 62Schneider J.W. Gu W. Zhu L. Mahdavi V. Nadal-Ginard B.

Nature. 1995; 374: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Despite this difference between the two studies, however, the results of both underscore the importance of the p300 family in the activation of cell type-specific genes in cardiac myocytes.

https://openalex.org/W2015225263,"The chloroplastic NADP-malate dehydrogenase is activated by thiol/disulfide interchange with reduced thioredoxins. Previous experiments showed that four cysteines located in specific N- and carboxyl-terminal extensions were implicated in this process, leading to a model where no internal cysteine was involved in activation. In the present study, the role of the conserved four internal cysteines was investigated. Surprisingly, the mutation of cysteine 207 into alanine yielded a protein with accelerated activation time course, whereas the mutations of the three other internal cysteines into alanines yielded proteins with unchanged activation kinetics. These results suggested that cysteine 207 might be linked in a disulfide bridge with one of the four external cysteines, most probably with one of the two amino-terminal cysteines whose mutation similarly accelerates the activation rate. To investigate this possibility, mutant malate dehydrogenases (MDHs) where a single amino-terminal cysteine was mutated in combination with the mutation of both carboxyl-terminal cysteines were produced and purified. The C29S/C365A/C377A mutant MDH still needed activation by reduced thioredoxin, while the C24S/C365A/C377A mutant MDH exhibited a thioredoxin-insensitive spontaneous activity, leading to the hypothesis that a Cys24-Cys207 disulfide bridge might be formed during the activation process. Indeed, an NADP-MDH where the cysteines 29, 207, 365, and 377 are mutated yielded a permanently active enzyme very similar to the previously created permanently active C24S/C29S/C365A/C377A mutant. A two-step activation model involving a thioredoxin-mediated disulfide isomerization at the amino terminus is proposed.

A two-step activation model involving a thioredoxin-mediated disulfide isomerization at the amino terminus is proposed. NADP-dependent malate dehydrogenase (NADP-MDH) 1The abbreviations used are: NADP-MDH, NADP-malate dehydrogenase; DEPC, diethyl pyrocarbonate; DTT, dithiothreitol; OAA, oxaloacetate; WT, wild-type. (EC 1.1.1.82) catalyzes the reduction of oxaloacetate into malate in higher plants. In C4 plants, such as sorghum or maize, it is located in the chloroplasts of mesophyll cells where it participates in the exportation of reducing equivalents needed for the photosynthetic fixation of atmospheric CO2 into organic molecules in bundle sheath cell chloroplasts (1Hatch M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 895: 81-106Crossref Scopus (746) Google Scholar). Among all the malate dehydrogenases studied so far, the NADP-dependent isoform exhibits a unique property. Whereas MDHs using NAD are permanently active, the NADP-dependent isoform is totally inactive in the dark and activated in the light (2Johnson H.S. Hatch M.D. Biochem. J. 1970; 119: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). It is now clearly established that this activation is mediated via the photosynthetic electron transfer and the ferredoxin/thioredoxin system and corresponds to the reduction of disulfides present in the inactive form (3Buchanan B.B. Schürmann P. Jacquot J-P. Semin. Cell Biol. 1994; 5: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). By thiol derivatization before and after activation and site-directed mutagenesis, the disulfide bridges reduced by thioredoxins have been identified (4Decottignies P. Schmitter J-M. Miginiac-Maslow M. Le Maréchal P. Jacquot J-P. Gadal P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11780-11785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Issakidis E. Saarinen M. Decottignies P. Jacquot J-P. Crétin C. Gadal P. Miginiac-Maslow M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3511-3517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To reach full activity, two disulfide bridges must be reduced: an amino-terminal one (cysteines 24 and 29) and a carboxyl-terminal one (cysteines 365 and 377). When these four cysteines are mutated, the mutant protein is permanently active. The two regulatory disulfide bridges belong to two sequence extensions characteristic of the NADP-dependent isoform and absent from the NAD-dependent isoforms (6Crétin C. Luchetta P. Joly C. Decottignies P. Lepiniec L. Gadal P. Sallantin M. Huet J-C. Pernollet J-C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 192: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the carboxyl-terminal extension shielded the access to the active site in the oxidized form and moved upon reduction (7Issakidis E. Lemaire M. Decottignies P. Jacquot J-P. Miginiac-Maslow M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), whereas the reduction of the amino-terminal bridge triggered a slow conformational change shaping the active site in a high activity conformation (5Issakidis E. Saarinen M. Decottignies P. Jacquot J-P. Crétin C. Gadal P. Miginiac-Maslow M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3511-3517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The four regulatory cysteines have no catalytic role since their replacement by alanines does not impair the catalytic activity. Nevertheless, it has been shown that the NADP-MDH activity was sensitive to thiol reagents, such as iodoacetate or iodoacetamide. Moreover, the permanently active C24A/C29A/C365A/C377A mutant protein is sensitive to diamide, a reagent known to reoxidize vicinal thiols into disulfides (5Issakidis E. Saarinen M. Decottignies P. Jacquot J-P. Crétin C. Gadal P. Miginiac-Maslow M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3511-3517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This observation suggested that an internal cysteine might be important for catalytic activity and also raised the question of the possible existence of an internal disulfide bridge. The NADP-MDH contains eight cysteines, at strictly conserved positions for all the NADP-isoforms; these conserved cysteines are not found in the NAD-dependent isoforms (6Crétin C. Luchetta P. Joly C. Decottignies P. Lepiniec L. Gadal P. Sallantin M. Huet J-C. Pernollet J-C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 192: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Four of those cysteines, belonging to sequence extensions, have been shown to play a role in the activation process and are not involved in catalytic activity. Concerning the four internal cysteines (cysteines 175, 182, 207, and 328), Cys175, located at the active site, has been studied earlier and shown to have no catalytic function (8Lemaire M. Issakidis E. Ruelland E. Decottignies P. Miginiac-Maslow M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 137-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined the possible role of the three other internal cysteines in the activity of the enzyme. Quite unexpectedly, one of them, i.e. Cys207, appeared to have a role in the reductive activation of the enzyme.

E. coli strain RZ1032 and M13mp19 phage (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) were used to produce deoxyuridine-substituted M13 single-stranded DNA for site-directed mutagenesis, pUC9 was used when needed for cloning strategy, andE. coli strain BL21 (DE3) (10Studier F.W. Moffat B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4834) Google Scholar) was used for the production of mutated NADP-MDHs encoded by recombinant pET-8c vectors. Bacteria were grown at 37 °C on Luria broth medium; ampicillin at 50 μg/ml was added when the bacteria carried plasmids conferring drug resistance. The cDNAs encoding the NADP-MDHs bearing the single mutations C207A, C207S, C182A, and C328A were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis using the method of Kunkel (11Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4900) Google Scholar). The single-stranded M13 template used was M13mdh, a vector in which the wild-type NADP-MDH cDNA is cloned (9Issakidis E.

The mutagenic oligonucleotides are presented in TableI. A screening of the mutants was performed by sequencing single-stranded M13 DNA obtained from a few plaque isolates. The cDNA coding for the NADP-MDH with the double mutation C175A/C207A was obtained using the same method and the same template except that for the annealing reaction a mixture of both mutagenic oligonucleotides was used (see Table I).Table IOligonucleotides used to introduce site-directed mutations into the mdh cDNAIntroduced modificationMutagenic primer sequenceC175A pGGAAATCCC GC TAACACTAC182ApGCGTTAATT GC CTTGAAAAATGCC207A pGAGCAAAG GC CCAGCTAGC207S pGAGCAAAG AG CCAGCTAGC328A pCAGCATGCCA GC CATCGAAThe bases underlined were introduced to replace the codons (written in bold) initially encoding a cysteine with codons coding for a serine or an alanine.

The cloning strategies used to combine the mutations are summarized in Fig. 1. The cDNAs bearing the mutations C24S/C365A/C377A, C29S/C365A/C377A, and C207A/C365A/C377A were obtained by exchanging the NcoI-NheI fragment of the C365A/C377A mdh cDNA cloned in pUC9 for the corresponding fragment of, respectively, C24S mdhcDNA, C29S mdh cDNA, and C207A mdhcDNA. To obtain the cDNA with the double mutation C207A/C328A, the NheI-BamHI fragment of the C207A/C365A/C377Amdh cDNA cloned in pUC9 was exchanged for the corresponding fragment of the C328A mdh cDNA. Because the NheI-BamHI encompasses cysteines 328, 365, and 377, this cloning strategy yields a cDNA containing only the mutations C207A and C328A. The C29S/C207A/C365A/C377A cDNA was obtained by exchanging the ApaI-ApaI fragment of the C207A/C365A/C377A mdh cDNA cloned in pUC9 for the corresponding fragment of the C29S/C365A/C377A mdh cDNA. The NcoI-BamHI fragments of all the mutated MDH cDNAs were transferred to a pET vector for production of the modified proteins. The DNA sequencing was done using the dideoxy chain termination method (12Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52671) Google Scholar) (T7 sequencing kit, Pharmacia). For every mutated cDNA, the sequence of the wholeNcoI/BamHI fragment in the expression vector was checked prior to recombinant protein production. The mutated NADP-MDHs were produced using the pET/BL21 production system. The experimental procedures for the production in E. coliand purification of the recombinant proteins were essentially as described in Ref. 9Issakidis E. Miginiac-Maslow M. Decottignies P. Jacquot J-P. Crétin C. Gadal P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21577-21583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. The main steps consisted of ammonium sulfate fractionation, ion-exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel, and affinity chromatography on Matrex Red A. When needed, a hydrophobic interaction step on TSK Phenyl 5PW was added. The column was equilibrated with 1.8 m ammonium sulfate in 0.1m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. The enzyme was eluted with a linear decreasing gradient of ammonium sulfate (1.8–0m) in the same buffer. The NADP-MDH was then dialyzed against 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA and concentrated. Proteins were separated by vertical SDS-PAGE following the method of Schägger and von Jagow (13Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10480) Google Scholar). They were visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. The amino-terminal sequence of the purified proteins was verified with an Applied Biosystems model 476A automated sequencer equipped with an on-line phenylthiohydantoin-derivative analyzer. Gel filtration experiments were performed using a TSK 3000 SW column (300 × 7.5 mm). After loading the protein, elution was achieved with a 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9 buffer, containing 0.15 m NaCl. Polypeptides with known molecular masses were used as standards. The enzymes were activated at 25 °C, in 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.9, by 20 μm E. coli thioredoxin, reduced either chemically with 10 mm DTT or photosynthetically in a reconstituted light activation system (14Droux M.

Recombinant E. coli thioredoxin was purified as in Ref. 15de Lamotte-Guéry F. Miginiac-Maslow M. Decottignies P. Stein M. Minard P. Jacquot J-P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar. NADP-MDH activity was measured on aliquots, at 30 °C, by following the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm, in a standard assay mixture (1 ml) containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 780 μm oxaloacetate, and 140 μm NADPH. The K m values for NADPH and oxaloacetate were determined on preactivated enzymes, unless otherwise indicated, by varying the concentrations of each substrate, the other being kept constant. S½ for thioredoxin were determined by measuring the initial rates of NADP-MDH activation in the presence of different concentrations of thioredoxin. The sensitivity of the C207A and C207A/C365A/C377A mutant MDHs to inhibition by DEPC was tested by adding the reagent at a 1 mm concentration either before or after activation of the enzymes in the same conditions as described in Refs. 7Issakidis E.

Substrate protection experiments were performed on the C207A/C365A/C377A mutant by adding 1 mm NADPH before the DEPC treatment. After the treatment, the enzyme was extensively dialyzed and submitted to activation by DTT-reduced thioredoxin. As mentioned in the introduction, the NADP-MDH mutated on Cys175 had been studied earlier (7Issakidis E. Lemaire M. Decottignies P. Jacquot J-P. Miginiac-Maslow M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To get a complete picture of the roles of cysteines in NADP-MDH, the three other internal cysteines, e.g. Cys182, Cys207, and Cys328, were individually mutated into alanines. After production in E. coli and purification to homogeneity, the three mutant proteins were found to be still active after activation by reduced thioredoxins. It thus appeared clearly that none of the internal cysteines was necessary for the catalytic process. No spontaneous activity could be measured prior to activation. Activation kinetics were followed by measuring NADP-MDH activity as a function of time after addition of thioredoxins reduced either chemically by DTT (Fig. 2) or photosynthetically in a reconstituted light activation system (data not shown). The activation time courses of the C182A and C328A mutant proteins, as well as the half-saturation concentrations for thioredoxins (S½), were similar to those of the wild-type enzyme and of the C175A mutant studied previously (7Issakidis E. Lemaire M. Decottignies P. Jacquot J-P. Miginiac-Maslow M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In contrast, the C207A mutant protein exhibited an accelerated activation time course and a 2 to 3 times lower S½ for thioredoxin (TableII).Table IIKinetic parameters of the wild-type and mutant NADP-MDHsk catK mk cat/K mS 1/2thioredoxin2-aThe S 1/2 thioredoxin for the C24S, C29S, and C24S/C29S mutants was 3 μm (Ref. 9).NADPHOxaloacetateNADPHOxaloacetates −1μmμm −1 · s −1μmWild-type63040 (± 8)37 (± 5)161710.5 (± 0.5)C182A3000111 (± 13)65 (± 7)274612.0 (± 0.5)C207A1532123 (± 34)72 (± 33)14213.9 (± 0.2)C207S1073123 (± 34)123 (± 60)994.2 (± 0.1)C328A31820 (± 3)26 (± 8)163313.8 (± 0.4)Kinetic parameters were determined at 30 °C, pH 7.9, with the purified preparations of the wild-type and mutant NADP-MDHs fully preactivated by 20 μm thioredoxin and 10 mmDTT. The K m for oxaloacetate was determined at a saturating concentration of NADPH (210 μm for C207A and C207S; 140 μm for wild-type, C182A, and C328A) with concentrations of OAA ranging from 7.5 to 1500 μm. TheK m for NADPH was determined at a saturating concentration of oxaloacetate (780 μm) with concentrations of NADPH ranging from 1.4 to 210 μm. TheS 1/2 thioredoxin were determined by varying the thioredoxin concentration in the preincubation medium from 0.5 to 40 μm and measuring the activation rate of the enzyme in the presence of saturating substrate concentrations.2-a The S 1/2 thioredoxin for the C24S, C29S, and C24S/C29S mutants was 3 μm (Ref. 9Issakidis E.

Open table in a new tab Kinetic parameters were determined at 30 °C, pH 7.9, with the purified preparations of the wild-type and mutant NADP-MDHs fully preactivated by 20 μm thioredoxin and 10 mmDTT. The K m for oxaloacetate was determined at a saturating concentration of NADPH (210 μm for C207A and C207S; 140 μm for wild-type, C182A, and C328A) with concentrations of OAA ranging from 7.5 to 1500 μm. TheK m for NADPH was determined at a saturating concentration of oxaloacetate (780 μm) with concentrations of NADPH ranging from 1.4 to 210 μm. TheS 1/2 thioredoxin were determined by varying the thioredoxin concentration in the preincubation medium from 0.5 to 40 μm and measuring the activation rate of the enzyme in the presence of saturating substrate concentrations. The kinetic parameters of the mutant proteins were also determined after full activation (see Table II). No significant differences for the K m OAA could be detected between the proteins mutated on cysteine 182, 207, or 328 and the WT enzyme. TheK m NADPH of the C328A NADP-MDH was close to that of the WT enzyme. The K m NADPH of the C182A and C207A mutants was about 4 times higher than that of the WT enzyme. Whenk cat values of the different mutants were compared, it appeared that the replacement of cysteine 182 or 207 did not impair but increased the catalytic activity (respectively about 5- and 2-fold), whereas the replacement of Cys328 by alanine resulted in a decrease of the catalytic activity (by about 2 times). Thus the presence of a cysteine at position 328 seemed to be favorable for the catalytic activity even though it was not directly implicated in the catalytic process. The higher K m NADPH of the C182A NADP-MDH suggested a possible role of Cys182 in the coenzyme binding, in accordance with its predicted position, close to the nicotinamide ring of the cofactor (5Issakidis E. Saarinen M. Decottignies P. Jacquot J-P. Crétin C. Gadal P. Miginiac-Maslow M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3511-3517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The overall effects of these individual mutations on the catalytic efficiencies of the mutated proteins (k cat/K m ) were rather limited, increased k cat being compensated by increased K m for NADPH. In contrast, the acceleration of the activation rate upon replacement of Cys207 by an alanine was rather unexpected and suggested that this cysteine could be involved in the activation process. To strengthen this hypothesis, this residue was also replaced by a serine. The C207S mutant protein exhibited the same kinetic parameters as the C207A mutant protein, that is a K m OAA close to that of the wild-type enzyme, and a K m NADPH about 3 times higher (Table II). Concerning the activation process, the C207S mutant protein exhibited an accelerated activation time course and a lower S½ for thioredoxin, i.e.characteristics similar to those of the C207A mutant (Table II and Fig.2) and to those obtained previously for the amino-terminal mutants mutated on either or both of the most amino-terminal cysteines (9Issakidis E. Miginiac-Maslow M. Decottignies P. Jacquot J-P. Crétin C. Gadal P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21577-21583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based upon these experiments, it could be concluded that cysteines 182, 207, and 328, like the previously studied Cys175, have no direct catalytic role in NADPH-MDH, but that Cys207 seemed to be implicated in the activation process. In previous studies (5Issakidis E. Saarinen M. Decottignies P. Jacquot J-P. Crétin C. Gadal P. Miginiac-Maslow M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3511-3517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Issakidis E. Lemaire M. Decottignies P. Jacquot J-P. Miginiac-Maslow M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), we have shown that the removal of the carboxyl-terminal disulfide of NADP-MDH by mutation of cysteines 365 and/or 377 opened the access to the active site but did not accelerate the slow activation rate of the enzyme which was linked to the presence of the amino-terminal disulfide. In contrast, mutation of amino-terminal cysteines (Cys24 and/or Cys29) accelerated the activation rate (9Issakidis E. Miginiac-Maslow M. Decottignies P. Jacquot J-P. Crétin C. Gadal P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21577-21583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and loosened the interaction between subunits (17Miginiac-Maslow, M., Issakidis, E., Lemaire, M., Ruelland, E., Jacquot, J.-P., and Decottignies, P. (1997) Austr. J. Plant Physiol., 24, in press.Google Scholar) but did not give access to the active site. The kinetic effects of mutation of Cys207 into alanine or serine described above strongly suggested that this residue was involved in the activation process but did not identify the step in which this cysteine was implicated. The role of the carboxyl-terminal bridge had been suggested first by the existence of a slight spontaneous activity in the mutants where the carboxyl-terminal disulfide had been removed. Supporting evidence for this role came from experiments using DEPC, a histidine-derivatizing reagent, which has been shown to constitute a good probe of the accessibility of the active site (16Lemaire M. Schmitter J-M. Issakidis E. Miginiac-Maslow M. Gadal P. Decottignies P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27291-27296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar): it inhibits the enzyme activity only when the carboxyl-terminal disulfide bridge is open by reduction or suppressed by site-directed mutagenesis. To investigate a possible role of Cys207 in the accessibility of the active site, the effect of DEPC was tested before and after the activation of the C207A mutant MDH. The activated mutant was inhibited by DEPC to the same extent as the activated WT enzyme (data not shown), but no inhibition occurred when the reagent was applied prior to activation,i.e. the mutant enzyme could be fully activated by reduced thioredoxin after removal of DEPC (Fig.3). In contrast, when the C207A mutation was combined with the double mutation C365A/C377A which eliminates the carboxyl-terminal disulfide, the unactivated enzyme was inhibited by DEPC and could not be activated further (Fig. 3). As in the case of the double carboxyl-terminal mutant, NADPH provided a protection against inhibition (data not shown). Clearly, the mutation of Cys207 alone did not give access to the active site. Interestingly, the combined triple mutant exhibited a higher spontaneous activity than the corresponding double carboxyl-terminal mutant: about 20% of the activity of the activated enzyme (Fig. 3)versus about 5% for the latter (5Issakidis E. Saarinen M. Decottignies P. Jacquot J-P. Crétin C. Gadal P. Miginiac-Maslow M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3511-3517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, aK m for NADPH and a K m for oxaloacetate could be measured for the non-activated triple mutant enzyme (Table III). TheK m for oxaloacetate of this enzyme prior to activation was found to be 220 μm, a value falling between the K m of the fully activated C207A/C365A/C377A triple mutant or WT enzymes (approximately 38 μm, Tables II and III) and the K m of the non-activated C365A/C377A NADP-MDH (1100 μm, Ref. 5Issakidis E. Saarinen M. Decottignies P. Jacquot J-P. Crétin C. Gadal P. Miginiac-Maslow M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3511-3517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In other words, in the enzyme mutated on Cys207, the conformation of the oxaloacetate binding site was intermediary between the low affinity conformation of the unactivated wild-type enzyme and the high affinity conformation of the fully activated wild-type enzyme. This was an additional indication that Cys207 is implicated in the activation process. More specifically, this result suggested that this cysteine is involved in the conformational change of the active site proposed to occur upon the reduction of the amino-terminal bridge. Another feature suggesting that the Cys207 mutation exhibited characteristics similar to those of the amino-terminal Cys mutations rather than the carboxyl-terminal Cys mutations is the sensitivity of the activation of this mutant to inhibition by NADP (data not shown), which is a a well known property of the WT enzyme and amino-terminal mutants and which is suppressed by mutation of the carboxyl-terminal cysteines (5Issakidis E. Saarinen M. Decottignies P. Jacquot J-P. Crétin C. Gadal P. Miginiac-Maslow M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3511-3517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The question can be raised of whether, as is the case for the amino-terminal cysteine mutations, the mutation of Cys207 loosened the interaction between subunits. To answer this question, size exclusion chromatography experiments were run on the unactivated C207A mutant under varying ionic strength conditions. However, the oxidized protein behaved much like the WT protein, i.e. could not be dissociated into monomers under these conditions (data not shown).Table IIIKinetic parameters of mutant NADP-MDHsProteinK mS 1/2thioredoxin3-aThe S 1/2 thioredoxin of the C365A/C377A mutant was 13 μm (Ref. 5).OAANADPHμmμmμmC24S/C365A/C377A57 (± 15)128 (± 39)C29S/C207A/C365A/C377A79 (± 5) 100 (± 32)Oxidized3-bThe K m OAA of the oxidized C365A/C377A mutant was 1100 μm (Ref. 5).ReducedOxidizedReducedC207A/C365A/C377A220 (± 72)38 (± 5)33 (± 7)52 (± 7)4.0 (± 0.5)C29S/C365A/C377A477 (± 66)82 (± 22)97 (± 6)163 (± 52)3.8 (± 0.2)The K m for substrates of the oxidized proteins were determined either by varying NADPH from 2.8 to 280 μm at saturating concentrations (3.75 mm) of oxaloacetate or oxaloacetate from 7.5 μm to 7.5 mm at saturating concentration (140 μm) of NADPH.

https://openalex.org/W2053615225,"TRAP ( t <i>rp</i> RNA-binding attenuation protein) is a tryptophan-activated RNA-binding protein that regulates expression of the <i>trp</i> biosynthetic genes by binding to a series of GAG and UAG trinucleotide repeats generally separated by two or three spacer nucleotides. Previously, we showed that TRAP contains 11 identical subunits arranged in a symmetrical ring. Based on this structure, we proposed a model for the TRAP·RNA interaction where the RNA wraps around the protein with each repeat of the RNA contacting one or a combination of two adjacent subunits of the TRAP oligomer. Here, we have shown that RNAs selected <i>in vitro</i> based on their ability to bind tryptophan-activated TRAP contain multiple G/UAG repeats and show a strong bias for pyrimidines as the spacer nucleotides between these repeats. The affinity of the TRAP·RNA interaction displays a nonlinear temperature dependence, increasing between 5 °C and 47 °C and then decreasing from 47 °C to 67 °C. Differential scanning calorimetry and circular dichroism spectroscopy demonstrate that TRAP is highly thermostable with few detectable changes in the structure between 25 °C and 70 °C, suggesting that the temperature dependence of this interaction reflects changes in the RNA. Results from circular dichroism and UV absorbance spectroscopy support this hypothesis, demonstrating that<i>trp</i> leader RNA becomes unstacked upon binding TRAP. We propose that the bias toward pyrimidines in the spacer nucleotides of the <i>in vitro</i> selected RNAs represents the inability of Us and Cs to form stable base stacking interactions, which allows the flexibility needed for the RNA to wrap around the TRAP oligomer."

Opioid receptors and endogenous opioid peptides form a neuromodulatory system that plays a major role in the control of nociceptive pathways. The opioid system is not only a key element for pain perception but also modulates affective behavior as well as neuroendocrine physiology and controls autonomic functions such as respiration, blood pressure, thermoregulation, and gastrointestinal motility. It affects locomotor activity and could be involved in learning and memory. The receptors are otherwise targets for exogenous narcotic drugs, a major class of drugs of abuse. Genes coding for δ, κ, and μ opioid receptor subtypes have now been identified and isolated from different vertebrates. Primary sequence analysis indicated that opioid receptors belong to the G-coupled receptor family whose structure shows a seven-transmembrane domain topology (for review, see Refs. 1Kieffer B.L.

Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 573-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The baculovirus expression system is extremely efficient to produce large amounts of mammalian proteins. Post-translational modifications are identical to those observed in mammalian cells with the exception of glycosylation, which is mostly of the high mannose type. Several G-coupled receptors, some of human origin, have already been expressed successfully under a functional state including adrenergic; γ-aminobutyric acid, type A; cholecystokinin; and different muscarinic, serotonin, or dopamine subtypes. The protein is produced in the range of 5–30 pmol/mg protein, and 1 × 106–2 × 106 receptor sites are generally present at the cell surface (for review, see Refs. 7Grisshammer R. Tate C.G. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1995; 28: 315-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar and 8Schertler G.F.X. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1992; 2: 534-544Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the protein production can be scaled up fairly easily. The baculovirus expression system may therefore be appropriate for production of opioid receptors in amounts that would allow purification to homogeneity and characterization on a functional and structural basis. We have cloned the cDNAs encoding full-length δ, κ, and μ opioid receptor subtypes in the genome of the baculovirusAutographa californica(AcMNPV) 1The abbreviations used are: AcMNPV,Autographa californica baculovirus; DPDPE, [d-Pen2,Pen5]enkephalin; DAMGO, [d-Ala2,N-Me-Phe4,Gly5-ol]enkephalin; U50488H,trans-(±)-3,4-dichloro-N-methyl-N-(2-[1-pyrrolidinyl]cyclohexyl)benzeneacetamide; nor-BNI, norbinaltorphimine; BW 373U86, (±)-4-[(a-R*)-a-[(2S*,5R*)-4-allyl-2,5-dimethyl-1-piperazinyl]-3-hydroxybenzyl]-N,N-diethylbenzamide; hDOR, hKOR, and hMOR, human δ, κ, and μ opioid receptors, respectively; m.o.i., multiplicity(ies) of infection; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. under the control of the polyhedrin promoter. In addition, all three receptors were cloned with an amino-terminal hexahistidine tag under the control of the same promoter to help subsequent purification. The protein expression was optimized for all six constructs, and a pharmacological profile was drawn for each mature receptor using whole cell binding. [3H]Diprenorphine was purchased from Amersham Corp. Dermorphin, deltorphin II, dynorphin A, DPDPE, DAMGO, naloxone, naltrindole, and U50488H were from Sigma. Naloxonazine-2HCl and nor-BNI were purchased from Research Biochemicals International (Natick, MA), and BW 373U86 was a gift from Dr. K. J. C. Chang (Burroughs Wellcome Co., Research Triangle Park, NC). The cDNA encoding the human δ opioid receptor (hDOR) was isolated from the neuroblastoma cell line SHSY-5Y (9Simonin F. Befort K. Gavériaux-Ruff C. Matthes H. Nappey V. Lannes V. Micheletti G. Kieffer B.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 1015-1021PubMed Google Scholar) and subcloned under the control of the polyhedrin promoter in the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pAcY2 (10Patel G. Nasmyth K. Jones N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 20: 97-104Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding the human κ opioid receptor (hKOR) was isolated from human placenta (11Simonin F. Gavériaux-Ruff C. Befort K. Matthes H. Lannes B. Micheletti G. Mattei M.G. Charron G. Bloch B. Kieffer B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The cDNA encoding the human μ opioid receptor (hMOR) was isolated from human brain (12Mestek A. Hurley J.H. Bye L.S. Campbell A.D. Chen Y. Tian M. Liu Y. Shulman H. Liu Y. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 501-511Crossref Google Scholar) and subcloned under the control of the polyhedrin promoter in the EagI and SmaI sites of pVL1392 (Pharmingen). hDOR, hKOR, and hMOR were also cloned under the control of the polyhedrin promoter as fusion proteins with an amino-terminal hexahistidine tag in pAcSG-His-NT vectors (Pharmingen): hDOR was inserted in the EcoRI site of pAc-His-NTB, hKOR in theNotI site of pAcSG-His-NTC, and hMOR as aEagI-SmaI fragment in pAcSG-His-NTA. All constructs were sequenced to control in-frame insertion. hDOR recombinant baculoviruses were selected in yeast according to a method we used previously (13Massotte D. Fleig U. Palme K. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 220-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and originally described by Patel et al. (10Patel G. Nasmyth K. Jones N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 20: 97-104Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). All other recombinant viruses were generated by cotransfection in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells with the appropriate transfer vector and Baculogold DNA (Pharmingen) using calcium phosphate coprecipitation. Single viral clones were isolated by plaque assay (except for hDOR) and amplified three times according to O'Reilly et al. (14O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992Google Scholar). Viral titers were determined by end point dilution and calculated according to Reed and Muench (15Reed L. Muench H. Am. J. Hyg. 1938; 27: 493-497Google Scholar). Sf9 cells were grown and maintained in TC100 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and Trichoplusia ni (BTI-TN-5B1–4 or High Five™) cells in serum-free medium Express Five (Life Technologies, Inc.). Both cell lines were cultivated either in monolayers or in suspension (50–200 ml) at 27 °C at 100 rpm (14O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992Google Scholar). Cell viability was determined by the trypan blue exclusion method. Infections at the required multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) were performed either in monolayers according to O'Reilly et al.(14O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992Google Scholar) or in suspension at a cell density of 1.6 106 cells/ml for Sf9 cells and 2.5 106 cells/ml for High Five cells unless otherwise stated. Cells were harvested either periodically to determine the time course of the expression maximum or at the peak of production (48–64 h postinfection) for saturation and competition experiments. Cells were harvested, centrifuged at 4 °C, washed with ice-cold PBS containing 0.32 m sucrose, and resuspended in ice-cold 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.32 m sucrose, conditions known to prevent receptor internalization (16Keith D.E. Murray S.R. Zaki P.A. Chu P.C. Lissin D.V. Kang L. Evans C.J. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19021-19024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Binding assays were performed on 106 cells (Sf9) or 105 cells (High Five) after a 30-min incubation at 18 °C with the appropriate ligands. Samples were filtered on GF/B filters treated with 0.1% polyethylenimine and washed twice with ice-cold 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, on a Brandell cell harvester. In all saturation experiments naloxone was used at 2 × 10−6m to determine nonspecific binding. Sf9 cells expressing either hMOR or hMOR with the amino-terminal hexahistidine tag (hMOR-his) were harvested 64 h postinfection, washed with PBS, 0.32 msucrose, and resuspended in Eppendorf tubes at 2 × 108 cells/ml. Fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min was followed by three washes with PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 and incubation overnight at 4 °C in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, 1% bovine serum albumin with a monoclonal antibody directed toward the histidine tag (Dianova, Federal Republic of Germany) at a 1:10 dilution. The cells were then washed three times with PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated for 4 h at room temperature in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, 1% bovine serum albumin with a secondary anti-mouse antibody coupled to fluorescein isothiocyanate (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) at a 1:200 dilution. After another wash with PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, nuclei were stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma), and cells were washed again. Fluorescence was observed using an Axioplan Zeiss microscope. Insect cells were infected with recombinant baculoviruses encoding nontagged opioid receptors under the control of the polyhedrin promoter. Expression levels were optimized for each recombinant virus using different initial Sf9 cell densities (ranging from 0.5 to 2 × 106 cells/ml) and various m.o.i. (ranging from 0.5 to 5). Samples were analyzed for receptor expression 24, 48, 56, and 72 h postinfection. The three opioid receptor subtypes were best expressed when infection was performed at a cell density of 1 × 106 cells/ml with m.o.i. = 2 for hMOR and m.o.i. = 1 for hDOR and hKOR (Fig.1). Similar profiles were observed for the three receptors with a maximum of expression reached 48 h postinfection and stable for the next 24 h. However, the maximal expression level was strongly subtype-dependent despite the high amino acid sequence homology between the receptors. Scatchard analysis was performed on data from whole cell binding experiments with [3H]diprenorphine, a widely used nonspecific antagonist. The deduced B max values allowed comparison of the expression levels of mature receptors present at the cell surface (Table I). hMOR was best expressed at levels approaching 1 nmol/liter of culture, which corresponds on average to about 500,000 receptor sites at the cell surface. hDOR was about four times less expressed, and a 10-fold lower protein expression was observed for hKOR. It was hypothesized previously that the cloning strategy could influence the protein expression level. According to O'Reilly et al. (14O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992Google Scholar), the starting codon of the gene to be expressed should be located out of frame and fewer than 100 base pairs downstream from the modified original ATG of the polyhedrin gene. These two requirements could be fulfilled for hMOR and hDOR but not for hKOR for which cloning into the restriction site NotI was 87 base pairs downstream but in-frame with the modified ATG. Another construct was then made in which the gene encoding hKOR was introduced in the unique XbaI restriction site of pVL1393. The starting codon of the gene to be expressed this time was out of frame but 119 base pairs after the modified ATG. About 60,000–120,000 receptor sites were detected at the cell surface, which represents a 2-fold increase (data not shown). These results suggest that factors governing protein expression levels are complex and cannot be easily predicted.Table IISaturation analysis (K d values) of [ 3 H]diprenorphine binding on recombinant opioid receptors expressed in Sf9 cellsRecombinant receptorK d of [3H]diprenorphineSf9 cellsCOS cellsnmhKOR0.34 ± 0.010.77 (Ref. 11Simonin F.

Saturation analysis of [3H]diprenorphine binding on recombinant δ, κ, and μ receptors showed that the measured K d values were similar to (hDOR, hKOR) or slightly higher (hMOR) than values published for receptors expressed in COS cells (Table II). The use of specific antagonists in competition binding experiments provided information on the subtype selectivity of the three recombinant proteins (Table III). The antagonists naloxonazine, naltrindole, and nor-BNI bound preferentially to hMOR, hDOR, and hKOR, respectively, which is in agreement with their μ, δ, and κ selectivities described previously in other cell backgrounds (17Pasternak G.W.

The K i values are in good agreement with former estimates for native and/or recombinant receptors expressed in mammalian cells.

Competition binding experiments were performed using potent and subtype-selective agonists (Table IV).K i values for both DAMGO and dermorphin were 2 orders of magnitude higher than those reported for hMOR expressed in COS cells. This suggests that the receptor expressed in Sf9 cells is in a low affinity binding state and may therefore not be coupled to intracellular effectors. Similarly, deltorphin II bound with low affinity to hDOR. However, BW 373U86 bound to hDOR with very high affinity, and the K i value for DPDPE was similar to values reported in mammalian cells for apparently coupled receptors.K i values were also determined for hKOR.

Introduction of an amino-terminal histidine tag modified significantly the receptor expression level at the cell surface. The B maxvalue of hMOR-his is reduced about 5-fold compared with wild type hMOR receptor (Fig. 1 and Table I). hDOR-his expression could still be detected but at a level too weak to allow any pharmacological characterization, and no hKOR-his receptor sites could even be detected on intact cells. These results strongly suggest that introduction of six positive charges at the amino terminus of the receptor interfered with membrane insertion and/or proper folding within the lipid bilayer. Interestingly, the pharmacological profile of hMOR-his seemed indistinguishable from that of hMOR (Tables II, III, and IV). Immunofluorescence experiments were performed on Sf9 cells infected with recombinant viruses encoding either hMOR or hMOR-his using a monoclonal antibody directed against the hexahistidine sequence. As expected, only background staining was observed with cells expressing hMOR or cells expressing hMOR-his incubated with the secondary antibody alone (Fig.2, a and c). The fluorescence was detected mainly at the plasma membrane of Sf9 cells expressing hMOR-his, suggesting that the mature protein reaches the cell surface. Staining was also visible inside the permeabilized cells, indicating that part of the receptor is still trapped likely within the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi compartments (Fig. 2 b). Recombinant viruses encoding hMOR were also used to infect High Five cells, another insect cell line that was recently reported to be suitable for large scale protein production (21Wickham T.J. Davis T. Granados R.R. Shuler M.L. Wood H.A. Biotechnol. Prog. 1992; 8: 391-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Expression was optimized using different initial cell densities (ranging from 1 × 106 to 3.5 × 106 cells/ml) and various m.o.i. (ranging from 2 to 16). Expression was maximum 48 h postinfection at m.o.i. = 4 and an initial cell density of 2.5 × 106 cells/ml. Data from whole cell binding experiments with [3H]diprenorphine were used for Scatchard analysis.B max values were between 0.9 and 1.7 nmol/liter of culture corresponding in average to 5–10 × 105receptor sites at the cell surface (Fig.3). Those values represent a 2-fold improvement over expression in Sf9 cells. The pharmacological profile of the recombinant receptor expressed in High Five cells was also determined. The K d value for [3H]diprenorphine (0.8 ± 0.4 nm) was comparable to that obtained for hMOR expressed in Sf9 (1.2 ± 0.4 nm) and COS cells (0.23 nm) (Fig. 3). hMOR expressed in High Five cells retained its selectivity for the antagonist naloxonazine, whereas K i values for the agonists DAMGO and dermorphin suggested that the receptor was in a low affinity binding state as also inferred in Sf9 cells (TableV).Table VCompetition binding experiments on the recombinant opioid receptor hMOR expressed in High Five cellshMORK i of High Five cellsnmAntagonists Naloxonazine5.4 ± 1.1 Naltrindole27.3 ± 4.1 Nor-BNI479 ± 22Agonists DAMGO876 ± 82 Dermorphin2,900 ± 500Same conditions as in Table II.

The three receptor subtypes were expressed at clearly distinct levels in Sf9 cells, although they share high sequence homology (up to 80% identity in the transmembrane domain). Such a variation has already been observed with other highly homologous G-coupled receptors either from different species origin such as β2-adrenergic or between different subtypes such as muscarinic ones (see Refs. 7Grisshammer R.

Previous reports suggested that a portion of recombinant membrane proteins, including G-coupled receptors, produced in Sf9 cells does not reach the cell surface but remains in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi compartments because of possible saturation of the translocation machinery of the insect cell (22Pajot-Augy E.

This hypothesis is also supported by our immunofluorescence experiments on permeabilized Sf9 cells expressing hMOR-his in which antibody labeling was detected not only at the cell surface but also inside the cell. OurB max values deduced from whole cell binding experiments only represent the receptor sites located at the cell surface.

This paper describes the molecular cloning and expression of EGCase II, one of the isoforms of EGCases. The gene encoding EGCase II was obtained by screening of a genomic DNA library from Rhodococcus sp. strain M-777 constructed in pUC19 with oligonucleotide probes deduced from a partial amino acid sequence of the enzyme protein. RecombinantEscherichia coli cells in which the EGCase II gene was expressed produced 14 units of the enzyme per liter of culture medium but did not produce sphingomyelinase. Recombinant EGCase II was a functioning enzyme with substrate specificity identical to that of the wild-type enzyme. Sequence analysis showed the presence of an open reading frame of 1470 base pairs encoding 490 amino acids. The N-terminal region of the deduced amino acid sequence had the general pattern of signal peptides of secreted prokaryotic proteins. Interestingly, the consensus sequence in the active site region of the endo-1,4-β-glucanase family A was found in the amino acid sequence of EGCase II."
https://openalex.org/W2000324574,"There are numerous similarities between the erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages which suggest that commitment to either lineage occurs relatively late in hematopoiesis. Commitment toward megakaryocyte development requires obligatory silencing of erythroid-specific genes. Therefore, we investigated the effects of interleukin-6, a known inducer of thrombocyte production, on globin gene expression during erythroid differentiation. Studies in K562 cells demonstrated inhibition of γ globin gene mRNA production and chain biosynthesis in the presence of exogenous interleukin-6 which was abrogated by anti-interleukin-6 monoclonal antibody. Similar studies in primary erythroid progenitors showed inhibition of burst-forming unit-erythroid colony formation when interleukin-6 was added late in cultures with decreased γ and β globin gene mRNA production. Protein binding studies demonstrated an increase in activator protein-1 binding to its consensus sequence by 24 h of interleukin-6 treatment. Inhibition of activator protein-1 gene activity had no effect on γ gene silencing by interleukin-6. A potential interleukin-6 response element was identified in the γ globin gene. Interleukin-6 treatment led to a rapid increase in protein binding to the target DNA sequence. These results suggest that interleukin-6 may play an important role in globin gene silencing during megakaryocytic lineage commitment."

On the other hand, stopped-flow experiments carried out starting from the fully oxidized (resting or pulsed) enzyme indicated that the rate of formation of reduced cytochromea 3 is by comparison very slow (0.1 to >30 s−1 depending on conditions (8Antalis T.M.

These observations led to the hypothesis that, starting with the oxidized enzyme, internal eT is slow because the pathway to and/or the coordination of the binuclear center are different from those of the transient species obtained by photolysis of the CO derivative of the reduced binuclear site (12Brunori M.

Morgan J.E. Wikström M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7483-7491Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) have confirmed the observation that the rate of accumulation of reduced cytochrome a 3 is slow; however they proposed that (i) in the oxidized enzyme internal eT is very fast; (ii) the redox equilibrium favors cytochrome a 2+; and (iii) H+ diffusion and/or binding to the reduced binuclear site is the rate-limiting step. We have addressed again this crucial question and carried out new kinetic experiments using a “fast” enzyme preparation (14Soulimane T. Buse G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 588-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and nitric oxide (NO) to trap reduced cytochrome a 3.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCytochrome c oxidase was purified from beef heart according to the method of Soulimane and Buse (14Soulimane T. Buse G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 588-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and stored at −70 °C in 10 mm Tris + 500 mm sodium chloride + 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100, pH 7.6. Before use, oxidase was thoroughly (about 2 days) dialyzed at 4 °C against 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7, + 0.1% (w/v) lauryl maltoside, the same buffer used for the kinetic experiments. This procedure yields a fraction of the enzyme (≈30%) in the slow form, as shown by the classical cyanide binding experiment (15Baker G.M. Noguchi M. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 595-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); nonetheless almost complete recovery of fast is achieved by “pulsing” (16Antonini E. Brunori M. Colosimo A. Greenwood C. Wilson M.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 3128-3132Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Oxidase concentration is expressed as functional units (cytochromeaa 3). Glucose (30 mm) and glucose oxidase (0.3 mg/ml) were used to achieve complete deoxygenation, in the presence of catalase. Stock solutions of NO (Air Liquide, Paris, France) or CO were prepared by equilibrating degassed buffer with the pure gases ([NO] in solution = 2 mm and [CO] in solution = 1 mm at 20°C). Lauryl maltoside was from Biomol (Hamburg, Germany). Ascorbate and glucose oxidase were from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Ruthenium hexamine was from Aldrich (Milwaukee, WI).Stopped-flow experiments were carried out either with a Durrum-Gibson instrument equipped with a diode array (TN6500; Tracor Northern, Madison, WI) or with a single wavelength apparatus (DX.17MV; Applied Photophysics, Leatherhead, U. K.). The diode array stopped-flow can acquire up to 80 spectra of 1,024 elements; the acquisition time for each spectrum is 10 ms. The dead time of the single wavelength stopped-flow is 1 ms.Data analysis was carried out with the software MATLAB (MathWorks, South Natick, MA) on an Intel 486 computer. Spectral smoothing was performed by using the singular value decomposition algorithm according to Henry and Hofrichter (17Henry E. Hofrichter J. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 210: 129-192Crossref Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Spectral deconvolution was obtained starting from reference spectra by using the left division option, provided by MATLAB. Kinetic simulations were carried out using a differential equations solver algorithm implemented by Dr. E. Henry (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD).RESULTSThe anaerobic reduction of fast oxidized cytochrome coxidase has been investigated employing ruthenium hexamine as electron donor because (i) the reduction of cytochrome a and CuA is sufficiently fast and thermodynamically favorable (E° ≈ −200 mV (18Scott R.A. Gray H.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980; 102: 3219-3224Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar)); and (ii) the spectral changes of the two cytochromes can be monitored over the whole range without optical interference by the reductant. Electron entry in cytochromec oxidase occurs via the binuclear copper center called CuA, which is in very rapid redox equilibrium with cytochrome a (k = 1.8 × 104 s−1), the electron donor to the binuclear cytochrome a 3-CuB center. To stabilize the reduced state of cytochrome a 3, we used CO and NO. NO is the most efficient “trapping” ligand for electrons on the cytochrome a 3-CuBcenter because its combination is very fast and strictly bimolecular (k on = 1 × 108m−1 s−1 (19Blackmore R.S. Greenwood C. Gibson Q.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19245-19249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) and its affinity very high (K a = 109m−1 given a dissociation rate constantk off = 0.1 s−1 (20Giuffrè A. Sarti P. D'Itri E. Buse G. Soulimane T. Brunori M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33404-33408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar)). In this paper we shall focus our discussion on the internal eT between cytochromea and the cytochromea 3-CuB center.Kinetics of Cytochrome a3 Reduction in the Presence of NOWhen degassed oxidized oxidase was anaerobically mixed with a solution of ruthenium hexamine, ascorbate, and NO, the time-resolved absorption spectra (Fig. 2 A) can be analyzed using the spectral components shown in Fig.2 B, i.e. the oxidized, the half-reduced (cytochrome a 2+CuA+-cytochromea 33+ CuB2+), and the fully reduced nitrosylated species. The calculated time courses of these spectral components are shown in Fig. 2 C. Their optical contribution was back-reconstructed using the calculated time courses and subtracted from the observed spectral data; the resulting residuals (Fig. 2 D) indicate that the spectral components used are sufficient to describe the experimental data to better than 95%. Within the first 30 ms after mixing, the half-reduced enzyme is populated transiently, whereas cytochrome a 3remains oxidized and unligated. Later on, the half-reduced species decays to the fully reduced nitrosylated species; this indicates that the reduction of cytochrome a 3 and NO binding are synchronous. This is fully consistent with the fact that the pseudo-first order rate constant for NO binding under these conditions is indeed very high (k′ ≈ 6,000 s−1). We may therefore conclude that NO acts as an efficient trapping ligand for reduced cytochromea 3 and that the observed rate of formation of the cytochrome a 32+-NO adduct starting with the oxidized enzyme is slow.As shown in Fig. 2, the time course of formation of the cytochromea 32+-NO adduct is not monophasic; it can be fitted to two exponential processes, the amplitude of the rapid phase being approximately 80% of the total. This biphasic time course has been observed with all preparations and tentatively explained assuming that a fraction of the enzyme is in the “resting” state even in a fast preparation. Consistent with this hypothesis, the amplitude of the slow phase decreases significantly upon pulsing the enzyme (16Antonini E. Brunori M. Colosimo A. Greenwood C. Wilson M.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 3128-3132Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) by reduction and subsequent exposure to oxygen (data not shown). Moreover, cyanide binding to the oxidized enzyme is also biphasic (15Baker G.M. Noguchi M. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 595-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Fig. 3 shows the results of an experiment carried out with a single wavelength double mixing stopped-flow. The time courses at 438 nm indicate that reduction of cytochromea 3 in the presence of NO is somewhat faster (k′ = 22 s−1) than in the presence of CO at the same concentration (k′ = 13 s−1). At 431 nm the first observable event is a fast absorbance decrease corresponding to reduction of cytochrome a; this is followed by the formation of the reduced cytochrome a 3-ligand adduct, proceeding at k′ = 19 s−1 with NO andk′ = 4.5 s−1 with CO. Given the relatively small combination rate constant for CO (k = 8 × 104m−1 s−1 (21Gibson Q.H. Greenwood C. Biochem. J. 1963; 86: 541-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar)), the formation of the CO-bound derivative (at 431 nm) lags behind the reduction of cytochrome a 3 (at 438 nm), whereas NO binding is synchronous to cytochrome a 3reduction, in agreement with the experiment of Fig. 2.Figure 3Time courses of cytochrome oxidase reduction in the presence of NO and CO. Time courses at 438 nm (top panel) and 431 nm (bottom panel) observed after mixing degassed oxidized oxidase (2 μm aa 3) with 20 mm ascorbate and 1.2 mm ruthenium hexamine in the presence of NO (solid line) or CO (dashed line). [NO] = [CO] = 125 μm (after mixing). Experimental conditions were as in Fig. 2, except the light path was 1 cm. At 438 nm there is no contribution from cytochrome a, and only cytochromea 3 reduction is monitored. At 431 nm the rapid absorption decrease reflects cytochrome a reduction, whereas the slower absorption increase monitors the formation of the NO- or CO adduct of reduced cytochrome a 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effect of Ruthenium Hexamine ConcentrationThe anaerobic reduction of oxidized oxidase was followed at different concentrations of ruthenium hexamine (from 125 μm to 2 mm) in the presence of NO. The measured rate constants for the reduction of cytochrome a and the formation of the cytochromea 32+-NO adduct are shown in Fig.4. The rate of reduction of cytochromea increases linearly with the concentration of ruthenium hexamine (k = 1.2 × 105m−1 s−1), whereas the formation of cytochrome a 32+-NO is essentially independent. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that the reduction of cytochrome a 3 is controlled kinetically.Figure 4Effect of the concentration of ruthenium hexamine. The rate constant for the formation of the cytochromea 32+-NO adduct at [NO] = 100 μm after mixing is shown (▵) as a function of the final concentration of ruthenium hexamine. The rate constant for the reduction of cytochrome a over the same concentration range is also shown (▪). Other experimental conditions are as in Fig.2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effect of NO and CO ConcentrationIn Fig.5 the rate constant for the formation of the NO and CO adducts of cytochromea 32+ is reported as a function of ligand concentration (from 7 to 500 μm). The cytochromea 32+-NO adduct is formed at a rate that is essentially independent of NO concentration and slightly higher than the average rate of reduction of cytochromea 3 in the absence of ligands (k′ = 16 s−1, arrowhead). On the contrary, the rate of formation of the cytochrome a 32+-CO adduct is slower than the rate of cytochrome a 3reduction and increases with CO concentration. The different behavior can be rationalized on the basis of the different combination rate constants for the binding of the two ligands to reduced cytochromea 3.Figure 5Effect of the concentration of NO and CO. The rate constant for the formation of cytochromea 32+-NO (○) is essentially independent of NO concentration (from 7 to 500 μm after mixing); on the contrary, the formation of cytochromea 32+-CO (•) is dependent on CO concentration. On the left (see arrowhead) the apparent rate constant for the reduction of cytochromea 3 was determined in the absence of gaseous ligands. Experimental conditions were as in Fig. 2. Continuous lines are the results of simulations obtained using the kinetic model described in the text (Scheme 1). Rate constants:k 1 = 1.5 × 105m−1 s1 (bimolecular rate constant for cytochrome a reduction by ruthenium hexamine);k 2 = 25 s−1; andk −2 = 125 s−1 (respectively, forward and reverse rate constants for the a ⇔a 3 eT); k NO = 1 × 108m−1 s−1, andk CO = 8 × 104m−1 s−1 (combination rate constants for NO and CO binding to reduced cytochromea 3, respectively).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)These findings demonstrate that using fast oxidase preparations, CO is inadequate to the role of trapping ligand, whereas NO is definitely suitable.DISCUSSIONThe structure of the active site of cytochrome coxidase, including cytochrome a and the (oxygen-binding) binuclear center cytochrome a 3-CuB, is shown in Fig. 1.

These very rapid rates (μs) are consistent with the short distance between the two metals (13 Å) which are connected via a possible pathway involving 16 covalent bonds (26Woodruff W.H. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 177-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it has been observed repeatedly (8Antalis T.M. Palmer G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1965; 240: 888-894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that the apparent rate of formation of reduced cytochrome a 3, both in the presence and absence of CO, is considerably slower (0.1 to > 30 s−1 depending on experimental conditions). Despite some complexities caused, for instance, by the fraction of resting and pulsed or fast enzyme, the apparent rate constant for complete reduction of the cytochrome a 3-CuBsite was found to correlate under selected conditions with the turnover number; thus Malatesta et al. (10Malatesta F. Sarti P. Antonini G. Vallone B. Brunori M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7410-7413Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) concluded that internal eT to the oxidized binuclear center is the rate-limiting step in turnover.To account for the slow reduction of cytochromea 3 starting with the oxidized enzyme, two different mechanisms have been proposed. The following simplified scheme may help discussion,e−→k1a↔k−2k2a3→↗Xk3a32+·XSCHEME1where e− is an electron donor (ruthenium hexamine or cytochrome c 2+) and X is a trapping ligand,i.e. a ligand that stabilizes with sufficiently high affinity the reduced cytochromea 3-CuB center. To single out the rate constant of internal eT to cytochrome a 3(k 2), it is necessary to adjust experimental conditions such that the reaction is driven to the right and thatk 1[e−] andk 3[X] > k 2 andk −2 (where all processes conform to a first order or pseudo-first order rate equation). Both conditions can be tested increasing the concentration of e− and X.The alternative mechanisms proposed are as follows.Kinetic ControlIn the oxidized enzyme, the rate of eT from cytochrome a to cytochrome a 3 is in the ms time range. If the reduction of cytochrome a and the binding of the trapping ligand are sufficiently fast, the reduction of cytochrome a 3 will rate limit the binding of X, making reduction and ligation synchronous. Under these conditions, the rate of cytochrome a 3 reduction should be independent of the concentration of both the reductant and the trapping ligand. We have developed (9Sarti P. Antonini G. Malatesta F. Vallone B. Brunori M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1988; 550: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 10Malatesta F. Sarti P. Antonini G. Vallone B. Brunori M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7410-7413Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) an experimental protocol to probe eT to cytochrome a 3 by mixing the oxidized (fast or pulsed) enzyme with a reductant containing X = NO or CO, known to bind quickly and tightly to reduced cytochromea 3. In this paper we have shown that the observed rate constant for the formation of cytochromea 3+2-NO is independent of the concentration of ruthenium hexamine (Fig. 4) and of NO (Fig. 5), implying a rate-limiting monomolecular process, which we assign tok 2.Thermodynamic ControlVerkhovsky et al. (13Verkhovsky M.I. Morgan J.E. Wikström M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7483-7491Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) have suggested that eT is very fast (μs) even in the oxidized enzyme, but the apparent rate constant for reduction of cytochromea 3 appears slow because thermodynamics favors reduced cytochrome a. If this holds, only a fraction (≤10%) of reduced cytochrome a 3 will be populated on a short time scale (at the rate of cytochrome areduction); nevertheless this fraction should be available for combination with a trapping ligand. Since equilibrium measurements have shown that low pH stabilizes cytochromea 32+ (28Blair D.F. Ellis Jr., W.R. Wang H. Gray H.B. Chan S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11524-11537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Mitchell R. Rich P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1186: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), Verkhovsky et al. (13Verkhovsky M.I. Morgan J.E. Wikström M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7483-7491Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) postulated that (i) H+ is the trapping ligand X, driving the reaction in Scheme 1 to the right; and (ii) the rate of diffusion and/or binding of H+ to the reduced site is slow, accounting for the relatively slow (ms) rate of reduction of cytochromea 3 vis-à-vis a very rapid (μs) eT. Verkhovsky et al. (13Verkhovsky M.I. Morgan J.E. Wikström M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7483-7491Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) observed that the pH dependence of the process (already documented by Malatesta et al. (10Malatesta F. Sarti P. Antonini G. Vallone B. Brunori M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7410-7413Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar)) was not inconsistent with their hypothesis, although the apparent rate constant increases at acidic pH by a factor of only 3/pH unit.The pH dependence of the redox potential implies that low pH stabilizes reduced cytochrome a 3, without kinetic implications. Verkhovsky et al. (13Verkhovsky M.I. Morgan J.E. Wikström M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7483-7491Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) also observed that the time course of formation of reduced cytochromea 3 and of H+ dissociation by phenol red (used as a pH indicator in unbuffered medium) is synchronous; this observation, however, is consistent with both mechanisms, since synchrony would be expected also if eT per se was rate-limiting, with reduction of cytochrome a 3coupled to rapid H+ uptake by a redox-linked ionizable group.In summary, there is substantial agreement about the bare experimental observation, i.e. that starting from oxidized cytochromec oxidase, the rate of formation of reduced cytochromea 3 is in the ms time range even with a large excess of reductant; nevertheless, two alternative mechanisms have been proposed. The experiments reported in this paper are consistent with a kinetic control of internal eT, but they appear difficult to reconcile with the hypothesis that cytochrome a anda 3 are in fast redox equilibrium and that uptake of protons is the rate-limiting step in the reduction of cytochromea 3 (and CuB). The data in Fig. 5show that the rate constant for the formation of cytochromea 32+-NO is independent of [NO] over a large range; this provides unequivocal evidence that NO binding is rate-limited by a monomolecular process, which we assign to a slow eT to cytochrome a 3, excluding that the two cytochromes are in very rapid equilibrium in the oxidized enzyme. If a fraction (≈10%) of cytochromea 32+ was populated within μs after reduction of cytochrome a, then the apparent rate constant for reduction of cytochrome a 3 should (i) increase as a hyperbolic function of [NO] to a plateaurepresented by the pseudo-first order rate constant for the reduction of cytochrome a, and (ii) increase linearly with the reductant concentration at a sufficiently high concentration of NO. As shown above (Figs. 4 and 5), this is not what we observed. In Fig. 5 we also show the CO concentration dependence of the rate constant for the formation of the cytochrome a 32+-CO complex. Given the relatively slow second order rate constant (k = 8 × 104m−1 s−1, (21Gibson Q.H. Greenwood C. Biochem. J. 1963; 86: 541-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar)), CO binding lags behind cytochrome a 3 reduction, and the formation of the cytochrome a 32+-CO adduct is CO concentration-dependent. Simulations of the kinetic model reported in Scheme 1 predict this behavior and yield an estimate of the equilibrium constant for the a ↔a 3 eT (see legend to Fig. 5). Thus both sets of data are quantitatively consistent with a kinetic control mechanism. To maintain Verkhovsky's hypothesis (13Verkhovsky M.I. Morgan J.E. Wikström M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7483-7491Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), one should postulate that NOcannot bind to reduced cytochrome a 3 unless a H+ is already bound at that site; in this case proton binding and/or diffusion would limit NO binding. This possibility seems difficult to reconcile with information available on oxidase and other reduced hemeproteins, keeping in mind that binding of NO to reduced cytochrome c oxidase is very rapid indeed, follows bimolecular kinetics, and has a very high affinity (K a = 109m−1).The three-dimensional structure of cytochrome c oxidase now available (1Iwata S.

It is intriguing that separate channels for diffusion of oxygen and protons to the active site have been postulated. Access of protons to the cavity in between the iron of cytochromea 3 and CuB may involve diffusion through pore A and/or pore B (1Iwata S. Ostermeier C. Ludwig B. Michel H. Nature. 199"

The affinity of this site in factor X is represented by a dissociation constant (K d ) of about 0.1 mm in the intact protein (10Persson E. Hogg P.J. Stenflo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22531-22539Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in a fragment containing the Gla and first EGF-like domains (11Persson E. Björk I. Stenflo J. J. Biol.

Hence, under physiological conditions, the bound Ca2+ ion and the resulting Ca2+-dependent structure can be considered as a structural determinant of the protein. In contrast, Ca2+binding to the isolated EGF-like domain has a 20-fold higherK d (4Persson E. Selander M. Linse S. Drakenberg T. Öhlin A.-K. Stenflo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16897-16904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The interaction between factor VIIa (fVIIa) and its cell surface receptor tissue factor (TF) is Ca2+-dependent and involves all four domains in fVIIa (13Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Chène C. Winkler F.K.

The importance of the Ca2+ site in the first EGF-like domain is presently unclear. This is in part due to the complex nature of Ca2+binding to a total of nine sites in fVIIa (13Banner D.W. D'Arcy A.

Birktoft J.J. Petersen L.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 114-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To address this question, we have mutated Asp-46 and Asp-63 in fVIIa to Asn, replacements that, based on studies of Ca2+ binding to synthetic variants of the first EGF-like domain from factor IX, should completely abolish Ca2+binding to this site (16Handford P.A.

We present the results of the characterization of the double mutant (D46N,D63N-fVIIa) and its TF binding properties, as well as the functional status of its complex with TF. Possible functions of Ca2+ binding to the first EGF-like domain, such as structural stabilization of the hinge region between the Gla and first EGF-like domains and proper presentation of residues interacting with TF, are discussed. The isolation of recombinant fVIIa (18Thim L. Bjoern S. Christensen M. Nicolaisen E.M. Lund-Hansen T. Pedersen A. Hedner U. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7785-7793Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) and D46N,D63N-fVIIa (19Persson E. Nielsen L.S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 241-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) was carried out as described, and the Gla-domainless forms were prepared by cleavage with α-chymotrypsin (20Neuenschwander P.F. Morrissey J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8007-8013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) followed by purification on a column of Q Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The protein concentrations were determined using a fVII enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and by absorbance measurements using an absorption coefficient (A 1 cm1% at 280 nm) of 13.2. Amino acid analyses were performed as described (4Persson E. Selander M. Linse S. Drakenberg T. Öhlin A.-K. Stenflo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16897-16904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resistance of fVIIa and D46N,D63N-fVIIa against proteolytic cleavage was tested by incubation with cathepsin G (ICN Biomedicals, Inc.) and α-chymotrypsin (Sigma), using 0.1% (w/w) enzyme, in 50 mm Tris, 0.1 mNaCl, pH 8.0, containing 2 mm EDTA, 0.3 mmCaCl2, or 1.5 mm CaCl2. The production and isolation of soluble TF (sTF) has been described (21Stone M.J. Ruf W. Miles D.J. Edgington T.S. Wright P.E. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 605-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar,22Freskgård P.-O. Olsen O.H. Persson E. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1531-1540Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and the concentration was estimated using an absorption coefficient of 15.0. Full-length TF was purchased from American Diagnostica Inc. and relipidated as described (23Rao L.V.M. Williams T. Rapaport S.I. Blood. 1996; 87: 3738-3748Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using 75% phosphatidylcholine, 25% phosphatidylserine (Sigma). Factors X and Xa were from Enzyme Research Laboratories. SDS-PAGE was run in 12% gels using ingredients from Serva and Bio-Rad (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207438) Google Scholar). Agarose gel electrophoresis (0.8% gels) was run in 75 mm Tris, 25 mm 5,5-diethylbarbital, pH 8.6, containing either 10 mm CaCl2 or 2 mmEDTA, using agarose purchased from Litex. The wild-type fVII expression plasmid, pLN174, has been described previously (19Persson E. Nielsen L.S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 241-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For the construction of the mutant cDNA (D46N,D63N), we used fVII cDNA inserted in the cloning vector pBluescript II KS+ (Stratagene) as described. Mutagenesis was performed by PCR (25Du Z.J. Regier D.A. Desrosiers R.C. BioTechniques. 1995; 18: 376-378PubMed Google Scholar) with the following two primers: 5′-CCC ATT CTG GCA TGG ACT TGA GGC ACA CTG GTC CCC ATT ACT GTA AGA-3′ and 5′-GCC TCA AGT CCA TGC CAG AAT GGG GGC TCC TGC AAG AAC CAG CTC CAG-3′. In brief, the template plasmid was denatured by treatment with NaOH followed by PCR with Pwo polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim). Escherichia coli were transformed with the resulting PCR product, and clones were screened for the presence of the mutations. The sequence was verified between the BamHI site before the initiation codon and the XbaI site (base number 534 of the fVII coding sequence) for one clone containing the desired mutation. TheBamHI-XbaI fragment was removed from the plasmid pLN174 and replaced with the corresponding fragment from the mutant plasmid. The presence of the mutations in the final expression construct was verified by sequencing. The baby hamster kidney cell line BHK570 (ATCC CRL 1632) was used for transfection and expression of mutant fVII protein as described earlier (19Persson E. Nielsen L.S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 241-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Cell culture materials were from Life Technologies, Inc. The amidolytic activity of fVIIa and D46N, D63N-fVIIa and their Gla-domainless counterparts (final concentration 150 nm) was measured in the presence of 1 mm S-2288 (Chromogenix) in 20 mm Hepes, 0.1m NaCl, pH 7.4, containing 1 mg/ml BSA and either 2 mm EDTA or 5 mm CaCl2 (26Persson E. Petersen L.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The total volume was 200 μl, and the absorbance at 405 nm was monitored for 45 min. The sTF-induced amidolytic activity enhancement was determined by mixing 10 nm fVIIa or 10 nm D46N,D63N-fVIIa with various concentrations of sTF (0–2 μm) at 5 mm CaCl2 and the conditions described above. Alternatively, fVIIa or D46N,D63N-fVIIa (0–500 nm) was added to 10 nm sTF. The absorbance at 405 nm was monitored for 30 min. The activity of fVIIa or D46N,D63N-fVIIa alone was subtracted. To investigate differences between fVIIa and D46N,D63N-fVIIa inK m for S-2288, we subjected 0.1–2 mmsubstrate to hydrolysis by 100 nm fVIIa, 100 nmD46N,D63N-fVIIa, 10 nm fVIIa/10 nm sTF, or 10 nm D46N,D63N-fVIIa/100 nm sTF. The hydrolysis rate at different substrate concentrations was divided by the rate at 2 mm S-2288. The Ca2+ dependence of fVIIa and D46N,D63N-fVIIa binding to sTF was studied at the same protein concentrations in the Hepes buffer containing gelatin instead of BSA. In the factor X activation assay, fVIIa and D46N,D63N-fVIIa (final concentration 2 pm to 5 nm) were mixed with a fixed effective concentration of relipidated TF (2.5 pmassuming quantitative reconstitution and that half the molecules are oriented outwards from the vesicles) in 50 μl of 20 mmHepes, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mmCaCl2, and 1 mg/ml BSA. The reaction was started by adding factor X (final concentration 175 nm), giving a final volume of 100 μl. After 5 min, the reaction was terminated by adding 50 μl buffer containing 20 mm EDTA instead of CaCl2. The generated factor Xa was quantified by subsequently adding 50 μl of 2 mm S-2765 (Chromogenix), and the absorbance at 405 nm was measured after 10 min. The factor Xa concentration was derived from a standard curve. The conditions of sTF immobilization and regeneration of the sTF-coated surface in the BIAcore instrument (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) have been described (27Persson, E. (1996) Haemostasis , 26, Suppl. 1, 31–34.Google Scholar). All experiments were performed at a flow rate of 5 μl/min, and the interaction between fVIIa and sTF at 5 mmCaCl2 was also monitored at 10 μl/min without any sign of mass transport limitation. For other experimental details, see the legend to Fig. 4. Association and dissociation phases lasted for 7 and 5 min, respectively. The presence of 2 μm sTF in solution during the dissociation phase did not affect the dissociation rate, showing that there was no rebinding of released fVIIa. Binding data was fitted by non-linear regression to a one-site model using BIAevaluation 2.1 supplied with the instrument. In the Ca2+ dependence study, 50 nm fVIIa or 200 nm D46N,D63N-fVIIa was injected at different Ca2+ concentrations over 1760 resonance units of sTF and the amount of bound protein after 15 min of association was measured. The structures of fVIIa residues 1–85 were built using Modeler implemented in the modeling package Quanta (Molecular Simulations, Inc., San Diego, CA). The models of the apo and 1 Ca2+ forms were based on the apo and 1 Ca2+structures of the corresponding part of bovine factor X (entry codes 1WHE and 1WHF, respectively) (28Sunnerhagen M. Olah G.A. Stenflo J. Forsén S. Drakenberg T. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11547-11559Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The model of the Ca2+-loaded Gla domain was based on the Ca2+structure of the prothrombin Gla domain (entry code 2PF2) (29Soriano-Garcia M. Padmanabhan K. de Vos A.M. Tulinsky A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2554-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) and used to produce the Ca2+-loaded form of the Gla-EGF fragment. Sequence alignment followed by a Modeler session and energy minimization resulted in the final models. The model of fVIIa residues 1–85 in complex with sTF was made by fitting the Ca2+-loaded structure to the known contacts between the two proteins in the x-ray crystal structure (13Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Chène C. Winkler F.K. Guha A. Konigsberg W.H. Nemerson Y. Kirchhofer D. Nature. 1996; 380: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar), using the structure of sTF as the template (entry code 1HFT) (30Muller Y.A. Ultsch M.H. Kelley R.F. de Vos A.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10864-10870Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The single-step affinity-chromatographic purification resulted in a homogeneous preparation of D46N,D63N-fVIIa with a yield of 1.3 mg/liter of medium. The ability of the mutant to bind to the antibody (which recognizes a Ca2+-dependent epitope in the Gla domain) employed as affinity ligand indicated that it was properly γ-carboxylated (26Persson E. Petersen L.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and amino acid analysis showed 9.7 mol of Gla/mol of D46N,D63N-fVIIa (the calculated number according to sequence data is 10). SDS-PAGE showed that the isolated mutant was in the two-chain, activated form with the bands corresponding to the heavy and light chains of fVIIa (data not shown). The conversion from single-chain D46N,D63N-fVII appeared to occur during purification. The starting material contained no amidolytic activity enhancable by the addition of sTF, whereas the activity of the purified protein could be stimulated by sTF (31Lawson J.H. Butenas S. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4834-4843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Higashi S. Nishimura H. Fujii S. Takada K. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17990-17996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Amino acid substitutions in the isolated first EGF-like domain from factor IX (16Handford P.A. Mayhew M. Baron M. Winship P.R. Campbell I.D. Brownlee G.G. Nature. 1991; 351: 164-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 17Mayhew M. Handford P. Baron M. Tse A.G.D. Campbell I.D. Brownlee G.G. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 489-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) suggest that the two Asp → Asn mutations in D46N,D63N-fVIIa should abolish Ca2+ binding to the first EGF-like domain. However, it is known that the Ca2+ site in the first EGF-like domain has a higher affinity in the intact protein due to the presence of additional ligands and/or increased structural stability. To confirm that the mutations had eliminated Ca2+ binding, the electrophoretic mobility of Gla-domainless mutant and wild-type fVIIa was analyzed on agarose gels in the presence and absence of Ca2+. Mutant and wild-type Gla-domainless fVIIa should contain one and two Ca2+binding sites, respectively. The removal of two negative charges in the mutant reduced its anodal migration rate in the absence of Ca2+ compared with that of fVIIa (Fig.1). In the presence of 10 mmCa2+, the mobility of both proteins was further reduced. The Ca2+-induced mobility shift was twice as big for fVIIa compared with D46N,D63N-fVIIa, indicating that the mutagenesis had successfully abolished Ca2+ binding to the EGF-like domain. The extra Ca2+ bound to fVIIa compensated for its two additional negative charges, resulting in identical mobilities of the two fVIIa forms in the presence of Ca2+. In the absence of Ca2+, D46N,D63N-fVIIa and fVIIa had similar specific amidolytic activities and the two proteins displayed similar, low affinity binding to sTF as measured by surface plasmon resonance (data not shown). Hence, there are no Ca2+-independent differences between them. However, the amidolytic activity of fVIIa was stimulated by Ca2+ to a 2–3-fold higher level than that of D46N,D63N-fVIIa (Fig.2), suggesting that a functional Ca2+ site in the EGF-like domain is required for full activity. Interestingly, the Gla-domainless forms of fVIIa and D46N,D63N-fVIIa were similarly stimulated by Ca2+. The data suggest that the presence of the Gla domain increases the activity in the case of a functional Ca2+ site in the EGF-like domain. The ability of sTF to enhance the activities of fVIIa and D46N,D63N-fVIIa allows the use of an amidolytic assay for the estimation of their affinities for the cofactor. In our system, the amidolytic activity of fVIIa was maximally enhanced at sTF concentrations above 50 nm and half-maximum was observed between 5 and 10 nm (Fig. 3). The data yielded a K d of 2.0 ± 0.7 nm. D46N,D63N-fVIIa displayed half-maximum around 100 nm sTF and was fully stimulated at sTF concentrations above 1 μm. A K d of 54 ± 8 nm was calculated for the mutant, i.e. 25-fold higher than that of fVIIa. Moreover, the mutant displayed lower activity than fVIIa at saturating concentrations of sTF, similar to what we observed in the absence of sTF. Almost identical results were seen when titrating a constant amount of sTF with fVIIa or D46N,D63N-fVIIa (Fig. 3). However, the sTF-independent activity prevented us from going higher than 500 nm in D46N,D63N-fVIIa. To elucidate the reason for the lower amidolytic activity of D46N,D63N-fVIIa-sTF, substrate hydrolysis was measured at varying concentrations of S-2288. Although the K m for S-2288 appears to be high and could not be accurately determined, the relative rate of hydrolysis obtained with fVIIa-sTF and D46N,D63N-fVIIa-sTF was identical when compared with the respective rate at the highest substrate concentration (which was lower for D46N,D63N-fVIIa-sTF). This indicates that fVIIa-sTF and D46N,D63N-fVIIa-sTF have similar K m values for S-2288 and that the difference in catalytic efficiency appears to be due to a lower k cat of the mutant in complex with sTF. The Ca2+ dependence of fVIIa and D46N,D63N-fVIIa binding to sTF was also investigated. At our protein concentrations, low levels of Ca2+ (0.1–0.2 mm) resulted in a larger absolute increase in fVIIa-sTF activity, due to the higher affinity of this complex, than in D46N,D63N-fVIIa-sTF activity. Nevertheless, these Ca2+ concentrations were sufficient to stimulate D46N,D63N-fVIIa-sTF, but not fVIIa-sTF, half-maximally (not shown). This suggests that the Ca2+ dependence of D46N,D63N-fVIIa was mediated solely by the Ca2+ site in the protease domain and that the Gla-EGF region has no influence in the absence of the Ca2+ site in the first EGF-like domain. The interaction between D46N,D63N-fVIIa and sTF was then compared with that between fVIIa and sTF in a BIAcore instrument. The real-time biosensor analysis of the fVIIa-sTF interaction yielded aK d of 4.6 nm, in agreement with previous studies (19Persson E. Nielsen L.S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 241-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 27Persson, E. (1996) Haemostasis , 26, Suppl. 1, 31–34.Google Scholar, 33O'Brien D.P. Kemball-Cook G. Hutchinson A.M.

The mutant D46N,D63N-fVIIa associated about 3-fold slower with sTF (1.1 × 105m−1 s−1) and dissociated about 3.5-fold faster from sTF (5.9 × 10−3s−1) which resulted in a K d of 54 nm (Fig. 4). TheK d values are in agreement with those derived from the sTF-dependent amidolytic activity assay. In addition, the Ca2+ dependence of the binding of fVIIa and D46N,D63N-fVIIa to sTF in the BIAcore closely resembled the Ca2+ dependence of fVIIa-sTF and D46N,D63N-fVIIa-sTF amidolytic activity (data not shown). Wild-type fVIIa and D46N,D63N-fVIIa also had different affinities for phospholipid-embedded TF. The K d values were estimated to be 7.5 ± 0.4 pm for fVIIa, in good agreement with earlier studies (14Sabharwal A.K. Birktoft J.J. Gorka J. Wildgoose P. Petersen L.C. Bajaj S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15523-15530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 34Waxman E. Ross J.B.A. Laue T.M. Guha A. Thiruvikraman S.V. Lin T.C. Konigsberg W.H. Nemerson Y. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3998-4003Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and 158 ± 16 pm for D46N,D63N-fVIIa (Fig.5). In our system, with a fixed concentration of TF, maximal factor X activation was observed above 200 pm fVIIa and 2 nm D46N,D63N-fVIIa. There was no difference in the maximal rate of factor Xa generation between fVIIa-TF and D46N,D63N-fVIIa-TF. Both complexes catalyzed the generation of approximately 300 mol of factor Xa/mol of TF/min, assuming that all TF molecules were successfully reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles and that 50% of them were functionally available on the outside of the vesicles. Cleavage sites in the hydrophobic cluster in the C-terminal part of the Gla domain have been exploited for more than a decade to produce Gla-domainless clotting factors. Since the Ca2+ binding site in the first EGF-like domain is located close to the hydrophobic stack (or C-terminal helix of the Gla domain) and might affect the conformation of this hinge region between the Gla and first EGF-like domains, we examined if the mutations had any effect on the rate of enzymatic cleavage. fVIIa was rapidly cleaved in the hydrophobic stack by chymotrypsin and cathepsin G in the absence of Ca2+ as monitored by SDS-PAGE, and considerable protection against cleavage by 1.5 mm Ca2+ (approximately plasma concentration) was observed (data not shown). However, 0.3 mm Ca2+, which should give more than 70% saturation of the Ca2+ site in the first EGF-like domain of fVIIa, did not result in any protection against degradation. Identical results of the chymotrypsin-catalyzed cleavage were obtained with D46N,D63N-fVIIa, whereas cathepsin G was unable to cleave the mutant under any of our conditions. Hence, no evidence for a specific protective effect of an intact Ca2+ binding site in the EGF-like domain was obtained. The first EGF-like domain of fVIIa is known from biochemical studies (35Toomey J.R. Smith K.J. Stafford D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19198-19202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Clarke B.J. Ofusu F.A. Sridhara S. Bona R.D. Rickles F.R.

Nature. 1996; 380: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar) to interact with TF, but the importance of the Ca2+ site in this domain is unclear. Based on Ca2+ structures of EGF-like domains (8Selander-Sunnerhagen M. Ullner M. Persson E. Teleman O. Stenflo J. Drakenberg T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19642-19649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Rao Z. Handford P. Mayhew M. Knott V. Brownlee G.G. Stuart D. Cell. 1995; 82: 131-141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) and their homology and high degree of sequence identity with the corresponding domain in fVIIa, the Asp residues in positions 46 and 63 in fVIIa were replaced by Asn to abolish and investigate the role of Ca2+binding to the first EGF-like domain. D46N,D63N-fVIIa was shown not to bind Ca2+ in the EGF-like domain, and no structural effects were observed when the mutations were put into our model of fVIIa (22Freskgård P.-O. Olsen O.H. Persson E. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1531-1540Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). D46N,D63N-fVIIa and fVIIa displayed similar amidolytic activity and similar, poor binding to sTF in the absence of Ca2+, indicating that the proteins only differed when in their Ca2+ conformations. A 2–3-fold difference in specific amidolytic activity between fVIIa and D46N,D63N-fVIIa was observed in the presence of Ca2+, both in the absence of and in complex with sTF. Thus the stimulatory effect of sTF, which is known primarily to result from an increase ink cat (31Lawson J.H. Butenas S. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4834-4843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Butenas S. Ribarik N. Mann K.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6531-6538Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), appears to be the same on both forms of fVIIa. However, the reasons for the impaired activity in the absence and presence of sTF might be different. The lower amidolytic activity of D46N,D63N-fVIIa is in agreement with a study of factor IXa mutants in which the residue corresponding to Asp-63 was replaced by Lys, Glu, or Val (39Lenting P.J. Christophe O.D. ter Maat H. Rees D.J.G. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25332-25337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Ca2+ binding to the first EGF-like domain appears to be involved in the Ca2+-induced increase in amidolytic activity, perhaps through an interaction between a Ca2+-dependent structure in the Gla-EGF region and the protease domain. The similar maximal factor X activation rates by fVIIa and D46N,D63N-fVIIa in complex with TF suggest that factor X and/or the phospholipid membrane is able to stabilize the optimally active conformation of both complexes (40Nemerson Y. Gentry R. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4020-4033Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We find that D46N,D63N-fVIIa binds both sTF and lipidated TF with approximately 20-fold higher K d than does wild-type fVIIa, showing that Ca2+ binding to the first EGF-like domain is essential for optimal cofactor binding. The affinity of D46N,D63N-fVIIa for sTF is similar to that of the most defective Ala mutant (I69A) in the EGF-like domain (41Dickinson C.D. Kelly C.R. Ruf W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14379-14384Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In addition, the kinetics of the interaction between D46N,D63N-fVIIa and sTF closely resemble those of the interaction between R79Q-fVIIa and sTF (33O'Brien D.P. Kemball-Cook G. Hutchinson A.M. Martin D.M.A. Johnson D.J.D. Byfield P.G.H. Takamiya O. Tuddenham E.G.D. McVey J.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14162-14169Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Arg-79 is a key TF-interactive residue located in the C-terminal part of the first EGF-like domain (13Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Chène C. Winkler F.K. Guha A. Konigsberg W.H. Nemerson Y. Kirchhofer D. Nature. 1996; 380: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to D46N,D63N-fVIIa, this mutant displayed a lower rate of factor X activation than fVIIa but similar amidolytic activity. The replacement of Asp-47 or Asp-64 in the first EGF-like domain from factor IX (corresponding to Asp-46 and Asp-63 in fVIIa) by Asn is known to abolish or severely impair Ca2+ binding (16Handford P.A.

Brownlee G.G. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 489-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Mutations at these positions result in very low biological activity of factor IXa causing hemophilia B (39Lenting P.J. Christophe O.D. ter Maat H. Rees D.J.G. Mertens K. J. Biol.

Pabinger-Fasching I. Watzke H.H. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 72: 74-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The primary reason for the low activity appears to be a defective interaction with factor VIIIa. The effects of mutating Ca2+-coordinating residues on the fVIIa-TF and factor IXa-factor VIIIa interactions suggest that Ca2+ binding to the first EGF-like domain in the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors is important for optimal recognition of their cofactors. Recently it was found, using a Gla-EGF fragment from factor X, that the relative orientation of the Gla and first EGF-like domains was altered upon Ca2+ binding to the latter domain (28Sunnerhagen M. Olah G.A. Stenflo J. Forsén S. Drakenberg T. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11547-11559Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This reorientation of domains most likely causes the increase in intrinsic fluorescence at low Ca2+ concentrations measurable with Gla-EGF fragments from factors VII, IX, X, and protein C (11Persson E. Björk I. Stenflo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2444-2452Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Persson E. Petersen L.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 48Öhlin A.-K. Björk I. Stenflo J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 644-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar,49Astermark J. Björk I. Öhlin A.-K. Stenflo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2430-2437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These proteins all have a conserved Trp residue in the hydrophobic stack hinge region (position 41 in fVIIa) between the Gla and first EGF-like domains. This strongly suggests that the folding of the Gla domain over the Ca2+ site in the first EGF-like domain is a general feature of these proteins (Fig.6). In addition, calorimetric and chromatographic data supportive of a Ca2+-induced interaction between the Gla and first EGF-like domains in factor IX have been presented (50Vysotchin A. Medved L.V. Ingham K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8436-8446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 51Medved L.V. Vysotchin A. Ingham K.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 478-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and a Ca2+-dependent interaction stabilizing the disulfide bonds in the two domains has been demonstrated in factor X (52Valcarce C. Holmgren A. Stenflo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26011-26016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, Gla-EGF from protein Z, which contains the Trp residue in the hydrophobic stack but not the Ca2+ binding site in the EGF-like domain, does not exhibit any fluorescence increase (53Persson E. Stenflo J. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We therefore postulate that Ca2+ binding to D46N,D63N-fVIIa, occurring outside the first EGF-like domain, has no influence on the relative orientation of the Gla and first EGF-like domains, whereas Ca2+ binding to fVIIa may affect the domain orientation. What is the exact role of the Ca2+ site in the first EGF-like domain of fVIIa? The Ca2+-induced orientation of the Gla and first EGF-like domains in Gla-EGF from factor X (28Sunnerhagen M. Olah G.A. Stenflo J. Forsén S. Drakenberg T. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11547-11559Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), likely to be present in fVIIa but not in D46N,D63N-fVIIa, is not found in fVIIa in complex with sTF (Fig. 6) (13Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Chène C. Winkler F.K. Guha A. Konigsberg W.H. Nemerson Y. Kirchhofer D. Nature. 1996; 380: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). In the complex, the orientation of these domains is closer to that seen in the apo structure of the factor X Gla-EGF fragment. Hence, Ca2+binding to the first EGF-like domain in fVIIa does not obviously facilitate the interaction with TF, but it cannot be ruled out that the angle between the Gla and EGF-like domains is critical in the docking of fVIIa with TF. Subsequently, the Gla-EGF region may be forced into another conformation by TF, changing the structure of the hydrophobic stack hinge region as inferred from CD experiments (22Freskgård P.-O. Olsen O.H. Persson E. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1531-1540Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In a physiological environment, the membrane surface may also be involved in this reorientation of domains through its interaction with the Gla domain. A recent energy transfer study suggests that the distance between the active site of fVIIa and the membrane surface decreases upon tissue factor binding (54McCallum C.D. Hapak R.C. Neuenschwander P.F. Morrissey J.H. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28168-28175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Considering that the Gla-EGF part of fVIIa appears to adopt a more upright conformation when bound to TF, this implies a dramatic reorientation of the protease domain relative to the membrane upon association with TF. However, rotational movement of the protease domain could explain at least part of the energy transfer change observed upon TF binding. Ca2+ binding to the first EGF-like domain in fVIIa definitely decreases the flexibility around the hydrophobic stack and thereby probably facilitates TF binding. It is probably also pivotal for optimal positioning of TF-interactive residues both in the first EGF-like domain and in the Gla domain. We also speculated that Ca2+ binding to the first EGF-like domain might be important for fVIIa activity in vivo by protecting it from proteolytic degradation in the hydrophobic stack (55Nicolaisen E.M. Petersen L.C. Thim L. Jacobsen J.K. Christensen M. Hedner U. FEBS Lett. 1992; 306: 157-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 56Nicolaisen E.M. Thim L. Jacobsen J.K. Nielsen P.F. Mollerup I.

Haemostasis. 1993; 70: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), a rapid process in the absence of Ca2+. However, our conclusion is that fVIIa and D46N,D63N-fVIIa are equally susceptible to enzymatic removal of the Gla domain at any given Ca2+ concentration. This supports the idea that the Ca2+-induced protection against proteolysis in the hydrophobic stack is mediated by Gla-dependent sites (53Persson E. Stenflo J. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar).

In view of these findings, the use of taicatoxin as a specific ligand for Ca2+ channels should now be reconsidered.

Neurotoxins, found in the venom of a wide variety of poisonous species (snakes, scorpions, spiders, and marine snails) have provided biologists with a formidable armory of molecular probes with which to study the structure and function of ion channels (1Trends Neurosci.Trends Neurosci19(Neurotoxins Suppl.) 2nd Ed.Adams, M. E., and Swanson, G. (eds) (1996) Trends Neurosci. , 19, (Neurotoxins Suppl.) 2nd Ed..Google Scholar). In particular, identification of the wide range of subtypes of potassium channels that are now known to exist, originally owes much to the discovery of neurotoxins with highly selective pharmacological actions (2Rudy B.

Neuroscience. 1988; 25: 729-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar): large conductance, BKCa channels (typically 100–250 pS), intermediate conductance, IKCa channels (typically 20–100 pS), and small conductance, SKCa channels (typically 5–20 pS). Each channel subtype has a distinct and characteristic neurotoxin pharmacology. Many SKCa channels are specifically blocked by apamin, a peptide (∼2000 Da) isolated from the venom of the European honey bee, Apis mellifera. Through the use of apamin, SKCa channels have been shown to be present in a wide variety of electrically excitable and non-excitable cells. In neurones, SKCa channels regulate repetitive firing by maintaining a slow after-hyperpolarizing potential following bursts of action potentials (6Sah P. Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 150-154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). In chromaffin cells, SKCa channels have been implicated in the control of adrenaline release (7Montiel C. Lopez M.G. Sanchez-Garcia P. Maroto R. Zapater P. Garcia A.G. J.

Ther. 1990; 46: 137-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), however, it has also been reported to have apparently anomalous effects on Ca2+ channels in heart. Apamin can block slow Ca2+ action potentials in cultured cells originating from the ventricles of 15-day-old chick embryos (19Bkaily G. Sperelakis N. Renaud J.-F. Payet M.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 248: H961-H965PubMed Google Scholar) and also L-type Ca2+ currents of embryonic chick and human fetal heart cells (20Bkaily G. Sculptoreanu A. Jacques D. Economos D. Menard D. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: H463-H471PubMed Google Scholar). These intriguing observations have prompted an examination of the complementary effects of Ca2+ channel blockers on SKCa channel function. To our surprise, these studies have led us to identify taicatoxin (a previously characterized Ca2+ channel blocker isolated from the venom of the Australian taipan, Oxyuranus scutellatus(21Possani L.D.

E., Gurrola, G. B., and Possani, L. D. (1987) Circ. Res. , 61,Suppl. I, 6–9.Google Scholar)) as a potent inhibitor of SKCa channels, both in rat brain and chromaffin cells. To the best of our knowledge, taicatoxin is the first SKCa channel blocker to be found in snake venom. Native apamin was purified from A. mellifera bee venom and radioiodinated as described previously (23Strong P.N. Brewster B.S. Methods Neurosci. 1992; 8: 15-24Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Taicatoxin and other Ca2+ channel blockers were obtained from Alomone Labs. Cardiotoxin was purified from the venom of Naja nigricollis nigricollis and was a generous gift from Dr. A. Menez (Department d'Ingenierie et d'Etudes des Proteines, CEA, Saclay, Gif-sur-Yvette, France). Molecular weight markers were obtained from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Protease inhibitors, bovine serum albumin (BSA, fraction V, protease free), and hyaluronidase type I-S were obtained from Sigma. Fetal bovine serum was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. and collagenase type I was obtained from Worthington. Disuccinimidyl suberate was obtained from Pierce Chemical Co. All other chemicals used were reagent grade. 125I-Apamin binding to rat cerebrocortical synaptic plasma membranes and subsequent analysis of data was performed as described previously (12Wadsworth J.D.F. Doorty K.B. Strong P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18053-18061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The incubation medium (1 ml) consisted of 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 25 mm Tris, pH 8.4, containing 0.1% (w/v) BSA. In saturation experiments, aliquots (∼40 μg of protein) of purified plasma membranes were incubated with increasing concentrations of 125I-apamin (0.2–150 pm) in the presence or absence of either 0.1 μm native apamin (to determine non-saturable binding) or 2 nm taicatoxin. Following equilibration on ice (1 h) the reaction was quenched by the addition of ice-cold incubation medium and rapid filtration through Whatman GF/B FP-100 filters presoaked (1 h at 4 °C) in 0.5% (v/v) polyethyleneimine. In displacement experiments, aliquots (∼100 μg of protein) of plasma membranes were incubated with a single fixed concentration of 125I-apamin (10 pm) in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of taicatoxin or single fixed concentrations of various ligands (as detailed in Table I). In both saturation and displacement experiments triplicate assays were routinely performed; the standard deviation of the means was typically between 3 and 5%. Affinity labeling of rat synaptic plasma membranes with 125I-apamin using the homobifunctional agent disuccinimidyl suberate was performed as detailed elsewhere (12Wadsworth J.D.F. Doorty K.B. Strong P.N. J. Biol.

Affinity labeled membrane pellets were solubilized by heating (95 °C for 5 min) in sample buffer (4% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 20 mm Tris, pH 6.8) containing protease inhibitors (2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 0.2 mm benzamidine, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 25 μg/ml bacitracin) in the presence of 5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol. Aliquots (∼150 μg of protein) were analyzed by discontinuous SDS-PAGE using 12% (w/v) acrylamide slab gels. Radioactive bands were identified by exposing the dried gel to x-ray film (Hyperfilm-MP; Amersham Corp.) for 2–5 days using an intensifying screen. Molecular masses were determined by comparison with migration of known standards. Taicatoxin samples were examined by SDS-PAGE using a high-molarity Tris buffer system adopted for analysis of small peptides (24Fling S.P. Gregerson D.S. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 155: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). The resolving gel contained 0.75 m Tris, pH 8.9, and the composition of the running buffer was 0.192 m glycine, 0.05 mTris, pH 8.9, containing 0.1% (w/v) SDS. Samples were heated (95 °C for 5 min) in sample buffer (as above) containing 2 mmEGTA, 2 mm EDTA and then analyzed by discontinuous gradient pore (15–30% (w/v) acrylamide) SDS-PAGE run under reducing or nonreducing conditions in the presence or absence, respectively, of 5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol. Gels were silver stained for total protein using the method of Morrissey (25Morrissey J.H. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 117: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (2932) Google Scholar). Rat chromaffin cells were prepared by procedures based on the methods of Neely and Lingle (26Neely A. Lingle C.J. J. Physiol. 1992; 453: 97-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and Park (27Park Y.B. J. Physiol. 1994; 481: 555-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In brief, 2–3 rats (∼200 g weight) were killed by CO2asphyxiation, according to Home Office guidelines. The adrenal glands were removed and the medullas isolated by dissection. The medullas were incubated in Ham's F-14 medium containing hyaluronidase (2.4 mg/ml), 0.1% (w/v) collagenase, and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum for 45–60 min at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. The medullas were then washed three times with F-14 medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and the cells dissociated by trituration through a fire polished Pasteur pipette. Cells were plated on polyornithine-coated coverslips and maintained at 37 °C for 3–5 days in a 5% CO2 incubator prior to electrophysiological measurements. Coverslips with attached chromaffin cells were placed in a recording chamber and visualized on the stage of a Nikon Diaphot microscope. The general electrophysiological procedures were as reported in Bevan and Yeats (28Bevan S. Yeats J. J. Physiol. 1991; 433: 145-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Membrane currents were studied with whole cell voltage clamp methods (29Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflugers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15118) Google Scholar) using fire polished patch pipettes. Series resistances were between 3 and 10 MΩ and an 80–85% series resistance compensation was applied. Potassium currents through small conductance Ca2+-activated channels (ISK(Ca)) were studied by examination of the tail currents, evoked when the membrane potential was stepped from an initial holding potential of −80 mV to more depolarized potentials (to evoke an inward Ca2+ current), and then subsequently stepped back to −120 mV for 7 s. The external solution contained (mm) 122.5 NaCl, 30 KCl, 10 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, and 10 HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH. The internal solution contained (mm) 120 potassium aspartate, 20 KCl, 5 MgCl2, 0.1 EGTA, 3 Na2ATP, 0.1 leupeptin, and 20 HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.2 with KOH. The same solutions were also used to study any effects of taicatoxin on potassium currents through BKCachannels. Delayed rectifier currents were evoked by 100 ms voltage steps from −80 mV to more depolarized potentials in “Ca2+-free” solution. In most experiments drugs were applied by pressure ejection from a puffer pipette although a U-tube application system was employed in some cases. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. of n observations. For Ca2+current (ICa) experiments the external solution contained (mm) 150 choline chloride, 10 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, buffered to pH 7.4 with Tris-OH, and the internal solution contained (mm) 130 CsCl, 1 CaCl2, 10 EGTA, 1 MgCl2 and 10 HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.2 with CsOH. A variety of both peptide and non-peptide blockers of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels were tested for their ability to interact with 125I-apamin acceptors present on rat synaptosomal plasma membranes. Potent and widely used 1,4-dihydropyridine Ca2+ channel antagonists, such as nifedipine, nitrendipine, nimodipine, nicardipine, and PN 200-110 caused no significant change in 125I-apamin binding when present at a 100,000-fold molar excess (relative to125I-apamin) (Table I). Similarly, Ca2+ channel toxins ω-agatoxin IVA, calciseptine, ω-conotoxin MVIIC, and ω-conotoxin GVIA were without effect when included in the assay at a 5000-fold molar excess. However, under identical conditions, the high threshold Ca2+ channel blocker taicatoxin, a complex oligomeric protein isolated from the venom of the Australian taipan snake O. scutellatus scutellatus (21Possani L.D. Martin B.M. Yatani A. Mocha-Morales J. Zamudio F.Z. Gurrola G.B. Brown A.M. Toxicon. 1992; 30: 1343-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) caused a marked reduction of binding to 11% of control values (Table I). Taicatoxin (M r 52000) has been reported to be an oligomeric complex of three noncovalently linked polypeptides (21Possani L.D. Martin B.M. Yatani A. Mocha-Morales J. Zamudio F.Z. Gurrola G.B. Brown A.M. Toxicon. 1992; 30: 1343-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Analysis of taicatoxin samples by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions followed by silver staining identified only three polypeptides of ∼16, 8, and 7 kDa (Fig. 1). Although the broad nature of the 8-kDa polypeptide band on SDS gels made it rather difficult to accurately assess the relative abundance of the three components, our results are consistent with the conclusions of Possani and colleagues (21Possani L.D. Martin B.M. Yatani A. Mocha-Morales J. Zamudio F.Z. Gurrola G.B. Brown A.M. Toxicon. 1992; 30: 1343-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) who reported a stoichiometry of 1:1:4 of the 16-, 8-, and 7-kDa polypeptides, respectively. As no other polypeptides were observed after prolonged silver staining of SDS gels (not shown), our results attest to the purity of the toxin sample. Since the 16-kDa subunit displays phospholipase activity (21Possani L.D. Martin B.M. Yatani A. Mocha-Morales J. Zamudio F.Z. Gurrola G.B. Brown A.M. Toxicon. 1992; 30: 1343-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), it is possible that this is responsible for the observed antagonism of125I-apamin binding. However, this seems unlikely, since the ability of taicatoxin to inhibit 125I-apamin binding was unaltered in the presence of either 1 mm EGTA or 2 mm strontium chloride (Sr2+ is a competitor for Ca2+ binding, which is essential for phospholipase activity) (data not shown). Nevertheless, since EGTA alone (1 mm) produced no discernible inhibition of125I-apamin binding, it was routinely included in the buffer used in all further binding experiments. Another possible explanation for taicatoxin's block of 125I-apamin binding could be nonspecific charge effects, owing to the high density of positive charge on the toxin. To test this possibility, we examined the ability of a snake venom cardiotoxin to act in a similar manner (cardiotoxins are extremely basic, surface-active polypeptides that have a wide range of membrane perturbing activities, thought to be due to their highly charged character (30Harvey A.L. J. Toxicol. Toxin Rev. 1985; 4: 41-69Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar)). Cardiotoxin γ from N. nigricollis nigricollis (31Fryklund L. Eaker D. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 2860-2865Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) did not alter 125I-apamin binding (Table I), suggesting that random charge effects are unlikely to underlie taicatoxin's inhibitory action. Further examination of taicatoxin's activity showed that inhibition of125I-apamin binding was complete over two log units of taicatoxin concentration (K i = 1.45 ± 0.22 nm) (Fig. 2 A). In agreement with this finding, saturation experiments (in which increasing concentrations of 125I-apamin were incubated with brain membranes in the presence or absence of 2 nmtaicatoxin) demonstrated that the inhibitory effect of taicatoxin was due to a reduction in the affinity of 125I-apamin for its acceptor, rather than an alteration of acceptor binding site density. The K d determined for 125I-apamin in the absence and presence of taicatoxin was 5 and 13 pm, respectively; B max varied by <2% (Fig.2 B). Importantly, these data re-affirm our earlier conclusion that the effects of taicatoxin on 125I-apamin binding are not due to site depletion through phospholipase activity. 125I-Apamin selectively labels high and low molecular weight polypeptides associated with SKCa channels on both brain and liver membranes (16Wadsworth J.D.F. Doorty K.B. Ganellin C.R. Strong P.N. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7917-7927Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Such affinity labeling can be blocked by structurally diverse pharmacological agents known to inhibit apamin-sensitive SKCa channel K+ currents (12Wadsworth J.D.F. Doorty K.B. Strong P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18053-18061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Taicatoxin completely abolished the incorporation of125I-apamin into a 33-kDa polypeptide (putative SKCa channel β-subunit (16Wadsworth J.D.F. Doorty K.B. Ganellin C.R. Strong P.N. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7917-7927Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar)) present on rat brain membranes (Fig. 3, lane 7). However, no significant difference in the labeling of this polypeptide was seen in the presence of a large molar excess of other Ca2+ channel blockers (Fig. 3, lanes 3–6). (The small decrease in labeling apparent in the presence of ω-conotoxin (lane 3) was not reproducibly observed). In many cells, an apamin-sensitive Ca2+-activated slow tail K+ current through SKCa channels (ISK(Ca)) contributes to the after-hyperpolarization that is observed following an action potential (6Sah P. Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 150-154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). The effects of taicatoxin on ISK(Ca) were examined in voltage-clamp studies using the slow after-hyperpolarizing tail currents found in cultured rat chromaffin cells. Fig. 4(parts A-C) demonstrates the currents evoked by stepping the membrane potential from an initial holding potential of −80 mV to 0 mV (for 2 s) and then to −120 mV (for 7 s). Under normal recording conditions, a biphasic outward current was elicited by the depolarizing voltage step and a long-lasting inward tail current was seen when the membrane potential was stepped to −120 mV (e.g. Fig. 4 A, trace 1). The current is inward at −120 mV, as this holding potential is negative to the K+equilibrium (zero current) potential. An application of 2 μm apamin for 1 s during the slow tail current resulted in rapid and complete block (Fig. 4 A, traces 2and 3), confirming the nature of the current as an ISK(Ca). Application of 50 nm taicatoxin for 1 s during the tail current had no immediate effect (Fig.4 B, trace 3) but abolished the slow ISK(Ca)current evoked by subsequent depolarizing-hyperpolarizing voltage steps (Fig. 4 B, trace 4). This low concentration of taicatoxin, eventually reduced the tail current by 97 ± 3% (n = 12). In contrast, higher concentrations of taicatoxin (5 μm) produced an immediate block of the ISK(Ca) tail current (Fig. 4 C, trace 3). The specificity of taicatoxin for apamin-sensitive currents was tested in 4 cells in which a low dose of apamin (2 nm) was first applied, followed by combined application of taicatoxin (50 nm) and apamin (2 nm). Application of taicatoxin had no effect on either the outward currents evoked by voltage steps from −80 mV to +20 mV or the fast tail currents evoked when the potential was stepped back to −80 mV. For the outward current, the ratio (amplitude in the presence of both toxins/amplitude in the presence of apamin alone) was 1.02 ± 0.06, while for the tail currents the ratio was 0.97 ± 0.06. These results suggest that taicatoxin does not block any additional apamin-insensitive components, such as the Ca2+-activated K+current through BKCa channels. At the same concentration of taicatoxin (50 nm) that completely blocked SKCa currents in chromaffin cells, only a partial block of ICa was achieved in the same cells (mean block 12 ± 4%, n = 6; Fig.5 A). This is consistent with the observations of Possani et al. (21Possani L.D. Martin B.M. Yatani A. Mocha-Morales J. Zamudio F.Z. Gurrola G.B. Brown A.M. Toxicon. 1992; 30: 1343-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) who showed that taicatoxin blocked calcium currents in heart cells with IC50 values ranging from 10 to 500 nm, dependent on holding potential (−30 to −80 mV). The relatively small effect on total ICa observed here is consistent with the notion that the reduction of ISK(Ca) represents a direct effect of taicatoxin on SKCa channels. The specificity of taicatoxin for ISK(Ca) was also tested by examining its effect on delayed rectifier currents which are present in chromaffin cells (26Neely A. Lingle C.J. J. Physiol. 1992; 453: 97-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In Ca2+-free media, taicatoxin (50 nm) had no significant effect on the amplitude of the delayed rectifier K+ currents (Fig. 5 B, mean amplitude 96 ± 3%, n = 5, of control value after toxin application). The ability of neurotoxins to selectively recognize different ion channels with high affinity renders them extremely useful probes for determining the distribution, biophysics, pharmacology, and structure of individual channel subtypes. As the number of recognized channel subtypes increases, so too does the demand for novel, highly selective toxins. Apamin, an octadecapeptide from the venom of the European honeybeeA. mellifera is an established blocker of SKCa channels in both the central nervous system and in diverse peripheral tissues (3Castle N.A. Haylett D.G. Jenkinson D.H. Trends Neurosci. 1989; 12: 59-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 5Garcia M.L. Galvez A. Garcia-Calvo M. King V.F. Vazquez J. Kaczorowski G.J. J.

The properties of SKCa channels have been largely deduced through the use of apamin in both biochemical and physiological studies. Although three other toxins, scyllatoxin (leiurotoxin I), PO5, and Tsκ, possessing apamin-like activity have been characterized from scorpion venoms (32Chicchi G.G. Gimenez-Gallego G. Ber E.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 390: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), taicatoxin, purified from the venom of the Australian taipanO. scutellatus scutellatus (21Possani L.D. Martin B.M. Yatani A. Mocha-Morales J. Zamudio F.Z. Gurrola G.B. Brown A.M. Toxicon. 1992; 30: 1343-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), is to our knowledge the first snake venom toxin shown to recognize apamin-sensitive SKCa channels. This toxin is an oligomeric complex, consisting of a peptide bearing homology to α-neurotoxins (8 kDa), a neurotoxic phospholipase (16 kDa), and four copies of a serine protease inhibitor (7 kDa) whose primary structure bears homology to protease inhibitors from other snake venoms (21Possani L.D. Martin B.M. Yatani A. Mocha-Morales J. Zamudio F.Z. Gurrola G.B. Brown A.M. Toxicon. 1992; 30: 1343-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Taicatoxin binds with high affinity (K i ∼1 nm) to125I-apamin acceptors present on rat brain membranes and the inhibition of 125I-apamin binding is both competitive and phospholipase-independent. Taicatoxin also specifically blocks affinity labeling of a 33-kDa 125I-apamin binding polypeptide implicated in the structure of a hetero-oligomeric SKCa channel. These biochemical findings are supported by the demonstration that in chromaffin cells, taicatoxin (50 nm) completely blocks the slow ISK(Ca) tail current. At the same concentration, taicatoxin reduces total ICa by only ∼12%. Although taicatoxin competes for 125I-apamin acceptors with high affinity, it is considerably less potent than apamin itself (K d ∼3 pm (12Wadsworth J.D.F. Doorty K.B. Strong P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18053-18061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). One cannot therefore unequivocally rule out the possibility that activity may be due to the presence (<0.01% by mass, assuming a M r of 2000) of an unidentified neurotoxin with affinity analogous to that of apamin. However, evidence suggesting that this is not the case stems from the observation that taicatoxin's constituent α-neurotoxin possesses a structural motif consistent with the recognition of SKCa channels. Apamin has two adjacent arginine residues (Arg-13 and Arg-14) that are essential for its biological activity (37Vincent J.-P. Schweitz H. Lazdunski M. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 2521-2525Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 38Granier C. Muller E.P. Van Rietschoten J. Eur. J.

Biochem. 1991; 196: 639-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and it has been proposed that this motif (more specifically the approximately 11 Å separation of two positive charges) provides the basis for specificity of SKCa channel blocking activity. A similar spatial separation of two positive charges is also present in dequalinium and tubocurarine (as well as other bisquaternary neuromuscular blocking agents), and this structural feature is thought to underlie their ability to inhibit 125I-apamin binding to liver and brain membranes and to block Ca2+-activated K+ currents in both hepatocytes and neurones (12Wadsworth J.D.F. Doorty K.B. Strong P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18053-18061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Cook N.S. Haylett D.G. J.

Pharmacol. 1996; 117: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Structure-function studies have also demonstrated that the scorpion toxins PO5 and scyllatoxin possess two functionally critical arginine residues responsible for SKCa channel inhibition. These two arginine residues are adjacent in PO5 (34Zerrouk H. Mansuelle P. Benslimane A. Rochat H. Martin-Eauclaire M.-F. FEBS Lett. 1993; 320: 189-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) while in the case of scyllatoxin, they are brought into close proximity through secondary folding (33Auguste P. Hugues M. Mourre C. Moinier D. Tartar A. Lazdunski M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 648-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 42Martins J.C. Zhang W. Tartar A. Lazdunski M. Borremans F.A.M. FEBS Lett. 1990; 260: 249-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The close apposition of two non-contiguous arginine residues within Tsκ is similarly thought to underlie its recognition of 125I-apamin acceptor-binding sites (36Legros C. Oughuideni R. Darbon H. Rochat H. Bougis P.E. Martin-Eauclaire M.-F. FEBS Lett. 1996; 390: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Since the α-neurotoxin of the taicatoxin complex contains two adjacent arginine residues at its N terminus (21Possani L.D. Martin B.M. Yatani A. Mocha-Morales J. Zamudio F.Z. Gurrola G.B. Brown A.M. Toxicon. 1992; 30: 1343-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), this suggests a structural basis for the recognition of 125I-apamin acceptor-binding sites. We have no insights as to a possible structural basis for taicatoxin's recognition of high threshold Ca2+ channels, although given the large size and oligomeric composition of taicatoxin, one can speculate that this may involve a different region of the toxin. The involvement of a single toxin domain in recognizing two distinct classes of ion channel would mean that such a toxin motif must exploit similar regions of like-charge distribution (presumably within the pore regions) on the two channel types. However, since there is no primary sequence homology between α-subunits of SKCa channels and high threshold Ca2+ channels (17Kohler M. Hirschberg B. Bond C.T. Kinzie J.M. Marrion N.V. Maylie J. Adelman J.P. Science. 1996; 273: 1709-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar, 43Mori Y. Peracchia C. Handbook of Membrane Channels: Molecular and Cellular Physiology. Academic Press Limited, London, England1994: 163-176Crossref Google Scholar), any similarity would be purely fortuitous. Nevertheless, such a scenario may explain the anomalous observation of apamin-sensitive Ca2+ channels in immature heart cells (19Bkaily G. Sperelakis N. Renaud J.-F. Payet M.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 248: H961-H965PubMed Google Scholar, 20Bkaily G. Sculptoreanu A. Jacques D. Economos D. Menard D. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: H463-H471PubMed Google Scholar). If there is any similarity in electrostatic topography between SKCa channels and certain forms of Ca2+ channel, then it is severely restricted; the overwhelming consensus of data in the literature would indicate that Ca2+ channels and SKCa channels have distinct and non-overlapping pharmacology. In summary, our results indicate that taicatoxin, previously shown to block high threshold Ca2+ channels in heart, interacts with SKCa channels in both chromaffin cells and the brain. The toxin blocks 125I-apamin acceptor sites on rat synaptosomal membranes with high affinity and is an effective inhibitor of ISK(Ca) in rat chromaffin cells. In view of these findings the use of taicatoxin as a specific ligand for voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels should now be reconsidered. We thank Dr. A.

Earle's balanced salts solution (EBSS) with limited NaCl concentration was utilized as the induction medium. COX-2 mRNA was elevated 6-fold in cells incubated for 1 h in hypotonic EBSS. COX-2 mRNA expression was not increased when raffinose or sucrose were used to reconstitute low NaCl. Actinomycin D blocked COX-2 mRNA increase by hypotonic stress, while cycloheximide enhanced COX-2 mRNA expression. COX-2 mRNA and protein concentrations increased as a function of decreasing media osmolarity and incubation time in hypotonic EBSS. Hypotonic EBSS induced a 3-fold increase in prostaglandin E2 release. WISH cells transiently transfected with a luciferase expression vector driven by the human COX-2 promoter for the COX-2 gene show a 3-fold increase in luciferase activity when incubated in hypotonic EBSS. COX-2 mRNA levels in primary human amnion cells were also increased by hypotonic stress. This study suggests that amnion cell COX-2 gene expression is regulated by cell volume expansion and/or increased plasma membrane tension.

Prostaglandins have a central role in regulating human parturition. Prostaglandin E2(PGE2), 1The abbreviations used are: PGE2, prostaglandin E2; COX-1 and -2, cyclooxygenase-1 and -2, respectively; EBSS, Earle's balanced salts solutions; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; SSC, sodium chloride/sodium citrate buffer; EGF, epidermal growth factor; BSA, bovine serum albumin; kb, kilobase(s). the primary prostaglandin produced by fetal membranes during labor, may be directly involved in the initiation and maintenance of uterine contractions (1Garfield R.E. Tabb T.N. Control of Uterine Contractility. CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, FL1994Google Scholar, 2Olson D.M. Mijovic J.E. Sadowsky D.W. Semin. Perinatol. 1995; 19: 53-63Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Untimely increases in prostaglandin biosynthesis early in gestation may be responsible for inducing preterm labor in some individuals (3VanMeir C.A. Sangha R.K. Walton J.C. Matthews S.G. Kierse M.J. Challis J.R. Placenta. 1996; 17: 291-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Although many hormones, growth factors, and cytokines have been reported to increase or decrease the synthesis and/or release of PGE2 in fetal tissues, the physiological factor(s) that up-regulates prostaglandin biosynthesis during parturition has not been identified. Metabolism of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin H2 is a key and rate-limiting step in prostaglandin biosynthesis. The reaction is catalyzed by cyclooxygenase. Two isoforms of cyclooxygenase have been identified, designated as COX-1 and COX-2. Both enzymes have been characterized in considerable detail (for review, see Refs. 4Smith W.L. Garavito R.M.

The genes for COX-1 and COX-2 are encoded on different chromosomes and have been sequenced. The gene for COX-1 is constitutively expressed, present in most tissues at low to nondeductible levels, and is generally considered to have “housekeeping” functions. In contrast, the gene for COX-2 has been characterized as an immediate early response gene. A wide range of mitogens, hormones, cytokines, and endotoxins increase the rates of COX-2 gene transcription and prostaglandin biosynthesis (4Smith W.L. Garavito R.M. DeWitt D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33157-33160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1852) Google Scholar, 5Williams C.S. DuBois R.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: G393-G400PubMed Google Scholar, 6Smith W.L.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1299: 125-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar). COX-2 mRNA and COX-2 protein have been reported to increase near the onset of labor. A major site of PGE2 synthesis during labor occurs in the amnion (9Gibb W. Sun M. J. Endocrin. 1996; 150: 497-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 10Slater D.M. Berger L.C. Newton R.

Prostaglandins. 1996; 52: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and mRNA levels (10Slater D.M. Berger L.C. Newton R. Moore G.E. Bennett P.R. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 1994; 172: 77-82Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (166) Google Scholar) are higher in amnion from women in laborversus patients not in labor. The underlying mechanism(s) leading to enhanced COX-2 mRNA expression in amnion during labor remains to be identified. Fetal membranes clearly undergo mechanical stretching as a result of several processes during gestation, including fetal growth, increased amniotic fluid volume, and labor. Increased membrane tension of fetal cells may also occur as a direct result of cell volume expansion; human amniotic fluid osmolarity decreases as a function of advancing gestational age (12Kittrich M. Jnovskaey M. Biol. Neonate. 1971; 18: 29-35Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), raising the possibility that increased amnion cell plasma membrane tension might occur, in part, by changes in cell volume. Furthermore, as initially observed by Danforth and Hull (13Danforth D.N. Hull R.W. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 1958; 75: 536-547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and as summarized by Alger and Pupkin (14Alger L.S. Pupkin M.J. Clin. Obstet. Gynecol. 1986; 29: 758-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), little if any amnion cell mitotic activity is observed in the latter part of gestation, and therefore, to accommodate the growing fetus, existing amnion cells must increase their size by stretching and hypertrophy. It has been recognized for some time that mechanical stretching of human cultured amnion cells increases the release of PGE2 (15Kanayama N. Fukamizu H. Gynecol. Obstet. Invest. 1989; 28: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Although the biochemical mechanism by which mechanical stretching increases prostaglandin release from these tissues is largely unknown, it was recently reported that mechanical stretching of cultured rat glomerular mesangial cells induces a number of immediate early response genes including the gene for COX-2 (16Akai Y. Homma T. Burns K.D. Yasuda T. Badr K.F. Harris R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C482-C490Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on this knowledge, we hypothesize that an increase in the volume of amnion cells and the resulting increase in plasma membrane tension induce COX-2 gene transcription and promote PGE2 release from fetal tissue. This study provides evidence that an increase in cell volume up-regulates COX-2 mRNA expression and elevates prostaglandin biosynthesis in amnion cells. Amnion-derived WISH cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) at passage 167. Tissue culture medium, designated as DF10F, consists of a combination of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus Ham's F-10 (50/50) supplemented with sodium bicarbonate (14 mm), 15 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.4) plus 10% fetal calf serum. DF10F contained the following antibiotics: penicillin (2 × 105 IU/liter), streptomycin (2 × 10−4m), and ampicillin (25 mg/liter). For each experiment, confluent WISH cell stock cultures were subcultured from a Falcon T75 tissue culture flask into 60 × 15-mm Falcon culture dishes (1.5 × 106 cells/dish) containing 5.0 ml of DF10F. Unless otherwise stated, cultures were incubated at 37 °C in humidified air containing 5% CO2, fed on day 3 with DF10F, and used for experiments on day 5. Under these growth conditions, WISH cells reach confluence between the third and fourth day of culture. Cells cultured for 5 days in DF10F were washed with 2.0 ml of Earle's balanced salts solution (EBSS). Induction medium (5.0 ml, equilibrated to 37 °C), as defined under “Results,” was added to cultures that were then incubated at 37 °C in humidified air containing 5% CO2. As described below, cells were then harvested for preparation of mRNA or COX-2 protein. In some experiments, spent incubation media were removed, frozen at −70 °C, and, as described below, analyzed for prostaglandin concentrations. Human amnion cells were cultured using a modification of the method of Okitaet al. (17Okita R.J. Sagawa N. Casey M.L. Snyder J. In Vitro. 1983; 19: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Placentae and associated membranes were obtained from women undergoing repeat cesarean section. All tissue manipulations were performed using aseptic technique and sterile (0.2 μm filtered) solutions. Amnion was stripped from choriodecidua and washed successively in 200-ml changes of ice-cold Ca2+- and Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline containing gentamicin (50 μg/ml) until clear of blood. Tissue was minced in 50 ml of TEP buffer (0.05% trypsin (SIGMA, Type II), 0.02% EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline) and then incubated at 37 °C for 20 min in a shaking water bath. The preparation was filtered through 2-mm stainless steel wire gauze. The filtrate was discarded, and the tissue fragments were recombined with 150 ml of TEP and incubated for 90 min. Following incubation, the cell suspension was combined with 450 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, shaken for 15 s, and filtered sequentially through 2- and 0.7-mm stainless steel wire gauze. The filtrate was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 8 min at 4 °C. Pelleted cells were resuspended in Earle's minimal essential medium, plated in 150-mm tissue culture dishes, and then incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 at 95% relative humidity. Medium was changed initially at 24 h and subsequently at 48-h intervals. Cells were grown to confluence and used directly. Induction media were removed from dishes, and 2.5 ml of RNA lysis buffer (4.0 m guanidine isothiocyanate, 25 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0, 0.5% sarcosyl, and 0.1 m 2-mercaptoethanol) was added to cell cultures. Cultures were allowed to stand in the lysis buffer for 5 min at room temperature and then mixed repeatedly by pipette. Cell lysates were transferred to Falcon number 2059 test tubes and frozen at −70 °C until preparation of RNA. Frozen cell lysates were thawed and passed three times through an 18-gauge needle. The sample (2.1 ml) was layered on a 2.5-ml pad of 5.7 m CsCl containing 0.1m EDTA and then centrifuged at 35,000 rpm for 18 h at 18 °C employing a Beckman SW 50.1 rotor. An aliquot from each RNA sample was diluted into TE buffer (10 mm Tris plus 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4), and the concentration of RNA was estimated spectrophotometrically as described previously (18Berger S.L. Berger S.L. Kimmel A.R. Guide to Molecular Cloning Techniques. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1987: 49-54Google Scholar). Specific amounts of RNA (10 μg/well for Northern analysis and 5 μg/well for dot blots) from each sample were aliquoted into microcentrifuge tubes. Sufficient diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water was added to each sample to provide the same RNA concentrations throughout all tubes. For Northern analyses, RNA precipitation solution (0.1 volume of 3 m sodium acetate, pH 5.0, followed by 2.5 volumes of 100% ethanol) was added to the samples, which were then stored at −70 °C until used. For dot blot assays, RNA samples were processed as described below. For Northern analysis, RNA samples were pelleted from the precipitation solution by centrifugation (12,000 × g for 15 min at 5 °C) and then dried by vacuum. Pellets were dissolved into 10 μl of denaturing solution (5 μl of formaldehyde, 2 μl of formamide, 1 μl of 10 × MOPS buffer (0.2 m MOPS), 0.1 m sodium acetate, 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.0), and 2 μl of H2O) plus 1 μl of ethidium bromide (400 μg/ml H2O). The samples were heated for 10 min at 65 °C and then chilled on ice. Samples were electrophoresed in formaldehyde-agarose gels (1.0% agarose (w/v), 6.6% formaldehyde (v/v) in 1 × MOPS buffer). Electrophoresis was carried out in 1 × MOPS buffer overnight (0.15 V/cm2). RNA was transferred by capillary action to Nytran filters overnight employing 10 × SSC (1.5 m sodium chloride, 150 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0) as the transfer buffer. The Nytran filters were air-dried and then baked at 80 °C for 1.5 h. As previously demonstrated (19Rosen K.M. Villa-Komaroff L. Focus. 1990; 12: 23-24Google Scholar), utilization of ethidium bromide under the above denaturing conditions provided direct evidence that (a) approximately equal amounts of RNA from different cell cultures were applied to gels for electrophoresis, (b) RNA integrity was maintained during sample preparation and electrophoresis, and (c) the transfer of RNA from gel to filter was complete. RNA dot blots were performed with a VacuDot-VS manifold (American Bionetics). Nytran filters were prewet with 6 × SSC prior to applying samples. RNA solutions were diluted with 4 volumes of denaturing solution and then heated at 65 °C for 15 min. Solutions of denatured RNA were chilled on ice, diluted with 1.5 volumes of 6 × SSC, and then loaded into manifold wells. The samples were allowed to drain by gravity for 30 min prior to applying a vacuum. Each well was vacuum-washed twice with 400 μl of 6 × SSC. Filters were air-dried and then heated at 80 °C for 1.5 h. Filters from both Northern blots and dot blots were then incubated for 2 h at 42 °C in prehybridization buffer as described previously (20Lundgren D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6841-6847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 32P-labeled probe for COX-2 mRNA was generated with a random primed labeling kit (Amersham International plc, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). The substrate was the 1.2-kilobase COX-2 cDNA insert purified from plasmid pcDNAhCOX-2. After prehybridization, the 32P-labeled COX-2 cDNA probe was denatured and then added directly to the prehybridization buffer (1.0 × 106 dpm/ml). Filters were incubated overnight at 42 °C. They were then incubated twice in 6 × SSC buffer plus 0.5% SDS and once in 1 × SSC plus 0.1% SDS for 15 min at room temperature. The final wash was carried out in 1 × SSC plus 0.1% SDS for 30 min at 56 °C. Nytran filters from Northern blots and dot blots were exposed to Kodak X-Omat RP film at −70 °C employing Lighting Plus intensifying screens. Autoradiographs of 32P-hybridized RNA dot blots were scanned with a Microtek MSF-300GS image scanner (Microtek, Torrance, CA) that was linked to a Macintosh IIsi computer. The image generated by the Microtek grayscale scanner was captured by Image Studio software (Letraset, Paramus, NJ) and then analyzed for intensity of grays relative to background by Scan Analysis software (Biosoft, Milltown, NJ). Quantitation of image intensities on film was carried out at less than maximal densities as described previously (20Lundgren D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6841-6847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When an image from a given dot blot was determined to be overexposed, autoradiography was repeated employing a shorter exposure time. Monolayers of WISH cells were suspended in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.2), 120 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml antipain, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and frozen at −70 °C. Cell homogenates were thawed on ice and maintained at 4 °C throughout manipulation. Homogenates were sonicated for 10 s (Heat Systems-Ultrasonics, Inc., model W225R with microtip), setting 4, 100% duty cycle, and then cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C. Aliquots (25 μl) of homogenates were subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 8% gels. Gels were equilibrated in 20 mm Tris, 190 mmglycine, 20% methanol, pH 8.3 overnight at 10 °C. Resolved proteins were semi-dry transferred for 1 h at 10 V (Bio-Rad, Melville, NY) to Hybond N+ (Amersham Corp.). Western blots were blocked in wash buffer plus bovine serum albumin (BSA) (10 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 0.2% Tween-20, containing 1% fatty-acid free BSA) overnight at 4 °C prior to incubation with COX-2 antibody (1:500 dilution in wash buffer plus BSA) for 1 h at 25 °C. Blots were washed in three changes of wash buffer at 10-min intervals and then incubated with a 1:2000 dilution of anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate in wash buffer plus BSA overnight at 4 °C. Following incubation, blots were washed as before prior to signal generation by ECL (Amersham) and visualized by a 10-s exposure to Kodak X-Omat AR film. WISH cells were plated in 3.8-cm2wells at a density of 5.0 × 105 cells, 2.0 ml of DF10F. After 24 h in culture the medium was removed, and cells were liposome-mediated transfected employing the following: 50 μg of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.), 10 μg of the COX-2 pXP1 luciferase reporter vector, 2 μg of the secreted alkaline phosphatase genetic reporter system (pSEAP-Control vector;CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), and 1.0 ml of DF10F lacking serum and antibiotics. Cells were incubated for 16 h in the initial transfection medium, after which an additional 1.0 ml of DF10F containing 10% fetal calf serum was added to each plate. The transfection medium was removed after 24 h, and cells were then incubated for an additional 48 h in DF10F plus 10% fetal calf serum minus antibiotics. Induction media, as defined under “Results,” were added to plates, and cells were incubated for designated times at 37 °C in 5% CO2. For alkaline phosphatase assays, induction media (500 μl) were removed from each plate and then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5 min at 10 °C. The supernatants were frozen at −70 °C until analysis by chemiluminescent detection using a commercial system (CLONTECH) and a 96-well format. Samples were exposed to x-ray film for various time periods to assure that detection was within the linear range of the film. For luciferase activity, cells were scraped into 200 μl of luciferase assay lysis buffer (Promega) and then sonicated (Heat Systems-ultrasonics Inc.) for 5 s on ice at 50% output. Samples were centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 5 min at 10 °C. Luciferase activity was determined using a commercial kit (Promega) by scintillation counting per the manufacturer's instructions. Prostaglandin antibodies and anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate were from Sigma. COX-2 antibodies were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). PGE2 was determined by radioimmunoassay assay using a commercial antibody and following the supplier's protocol (Sigma). Media osmolalities were determined by vapor pressure employing a Wescor 5500 Vapor Pressure Osmometer (Wescor Inc., Logan, Utah). The plasmid pcDNAhCOX-2, which contains mouse COX-2 cDNA (21Hla T. Neilson K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7384-7388Crossref PubMed Scopus (1486) Google Scholar), was a generous gift from Dr. Timothy Hla (American Red Cross, Rockville, MD). The vector containing the human COX-2 promoter-luciferase reporter construct (22Tazawa R. Xu X.M. Wu K.K. Wang L.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) was a generous gift from Dr. Lee-Ho Wang (University of Texas, Houston). COX-2 mRNA expression was initially examined in WISH cells incubated for 1 h in hypotonic versus isotonic EBSS. Relative to the concentration of COX-2 mRNA from cells incubated in isotonic EBSS, COX-2 mRNA expression was markedly elevated in hypotonically stressed cells (Fig. 1, lanes 2, 5, and 8 versus lanes 3, 6, and 9, respectively). The 32P-labeled COX-2 cDNA probe hybridized to three mRNA species of approximately 5.8, 4.8, and 3.4 kb. All three mRNA species were elevated in hypotonically stressed cells. In contrast to COX-2 mRNA expression, no change in the level of COX-1 mRNA was detectable by Northern analysis employing a cDNA-specific probe for COX-1 (not shown). The relative concentration of basal level COX-2 mRNA from untreated cells (i.e. cells harvested directly from spent tissue culture growth medium, DF10F) was also determined (Fig. 1, lanes 1, 4, and 7). Basal COX-2 mRNA levels were consistently less than levels from WISH cells incubated in isotonic EBSS (compare lanes 1, 4, and7 to lanes 2, 5, and 8, respectively). During the course of these studies it was determined that, due to evaporation, the osmolarity of fresh DF10F tissue culture medium increased from 290–300 mosmol/liter to 315–320 mosmol/liter after 48 h of incubation. The osmolarity of standard isotonic EBSS routinely assayed between 280 and 290 mosmol/liter and, therefore, cells cultured for 48 h in DF10F medium and then incubated in isotonic EBSS were subjected to a decrease in osmolarity of between 25 and 40 mosmol/liter. Thus, shifting cells from 48-h spent tissue culture media that has become moderately hypertonic due to evaporation to standard isotonic EBSS is sufficient to increase COX-2 mRNA expression. As shown in Fig. 3, very little if any difference in COX-2 mRNA concentrations from untreated cells versus isotonic EBSS-treated cells were observed when the osmolarity of EBSS was increased by 30 mosmol/liter with 30 mm raffinose. As determined by autoradiography and grayscale scanning of RNA dot blots hybridized to the 32P-labeled COX-2 cDNA probe, the relative concentration of COX-2 mRNA from WISH cells incubated for 1 h in hypotonic EBSS was elevated approximately 6-fold above the COX-2 mRNA concentration from cells incubated in isotonic EBSS (Table I). Numerous reports have shown that EGF is a potent inducer of COX-2 gene transcription in a variety of biological systems, including human amnion cells. As a positive control in this study, and to compare the relative potency of hypotonic stress to a recognized inducer of COX-2 gene expression, the effect of EGF was also determined on WISH COX-2 mRNA expression. The relative concentration of COX-2 mRNA in cells incubated in isotonic EBSS plus EGF was elevated approximately 10-fold higher than that in cells incubated in isotonic EBSS (Table I).Table IEffect of hypotonic stress and EGF on WISH cell COX-2 mRNA levelsMediaRelative COX-2 mRNA levelsI29.6 ± 7.0H187.0 ± 9.4I + EGF290.4 ± 4.8Cells were incubated for 1 h in 5.0 ml of specified media. Media were constructed as follows: isotonic EBSS (I), hypotonic EBSS in which 116 mm NaCl was reduced to 58 mm (H), and isotonic EBSS plus 20 ng/ml EGF (I + EGF). RNA (5.0 μg) was dot-blotted and probed for COX-2 mRNA as described under “Materials and Methods.” An autoradiogram of the dot blot was then analyzed by grayscale scanning as described under “Materials and Methods.” Values are the mean ± S.D. of three replicate cultures. Open table in a new tab Cells were incubated for 1 h in 5.0 ml of specified media.

Hypotonic media in Fig. 1 and Table I were formulated by decreasing the amount of NaCl in EBSS. A previous study, employing rat papillary collecting tubule cells, reported that PGE2 was induced in this system by a reduction in extracellular Na+ (23Craven P.A. DeRubertis F.R. Kidney Int. 1991; 39: 591-597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). To determine if elevated WISH cell COX-2 mRNA expression is related to cell volume expansion or, alternatively, related to a reduction in extracellular Na+and/or Cl−, cells were incubated in isotonic EBSS in which 116 mosm sucrose or raffinose was substituted for 116 mosm NaCl (Fig.2 A). Only cells incubated in hypotonic medium were characterized by increased COX-2 mRNA expression. In the same experiment, the concentration of released PGE2 was determined in induction media from WISH cells (Fig. 2 B). PGE2 was also elevated only in cells incubated in hypotonic EBSS. The effects of actinomycin D and cycloheximide on elevated COX-2 mRNA resulting from hypotonic stress were determined by dot blot analysis (Fig. 3). The addition of actinomycin D to hypotonic EBSS completely suppressed COX-2 mRNA concentrations to levels observed for untreated cells and cells incubated in isotonic EBSS. In contrast, the relative concentration of COX-2 mRNA in hypotonically stressed cells was not reduced by the addition of cycloheximide to hypotonic EBSS. COX-2 mRNA expression was examined as a function of decreasing medium osmolarity (Fig. 4 A). The relative concentration of COX-2 mRNA was characterized by a gradual increase as the osmolarity was reduced from 279 mosm to 200 mosm. A more pronounced increase in COX-2 mRNA expression was evident when the osmolarity was shifted from 200 to 178 mosm, the lowest osmolarity tested. The relative concentration of COX-2 mRNA was also examined as a function of incubation time in hypotonic medium (Fig. 4 B,open circles). A change in WISH cell COX-2 mRNA levels resulting from hypotonic induction medium (161 mosm EBSS) was detected within 30 min, the earliest time period examined. COX-2 mRNA levels remained elevated for an additional hour and then declined to near basal levels between 2.5 and 3.0 h. Relative to cells incubated in isotonic EBSS, cells subjected to hypotonic EBSS (176 mosm and 218 mosm) were characterized by increased COX-2 protein concentration (Fig.5). Two COX-2 protein bands of 72 and 74 kDa were detected, an observation that is consistent with the sizes of COX-2 protein reported for other systems (24Otto J.C. DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18234-18242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At 176 mosm, COX-2 protein appears to be maximally expressed between 1 and 2 h, and then it falls to basal levels between 3 and 6 h, a pattern that closely parallels the increase in COX-2 mRNA expression when cells are incubated in 161 mosm EBSS (Fig. 4 B). When incubated in a less pronounced hypotonic EBSS medium (218 mosm), the increase in COX-2 protein expression was delayed for at least 2 h, increasing between 3 and 6 h, and remained elevated for several hours prior to returning to basal levels between 6 and 18 h (Fig. 5). To ascertain the effect of hypotonic stress on COX-2 gene expression, WISH cells were transiently transfected with a human COX-2 promoter-luciferase construct. This reporter construct contains an 899-base pair fragment of the human promoter for the COX-2 gene, progressing 5′ from the ATG start site, and coupled to the Pxp1 luciferase expression vector (22Tazawa R. Xu X.M. Wu K.K. Wang L.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Relative to cells incubated in isotonic EBSS, cells incubated in hypotonic EBSS were characterized by approximately a 3-fold increase in luciferase activity (Fig.6). The level of luciferase induction observed for cells incubated in isotonic EBSS plus EGF was approximately 6-fold above cells incubated in isotonic EBSS (Fig.6). Because WISH cells are immortal and therefore transformed, it cannot be assumed that the activation of a given signal transduction pathway in this cell line is applicable to normal human amnion cells. Previous studies of primary human amnion cells in culture have show that they retain many of the biochemical and morphological properties of amnion cells studied immediately after parturition (17Okita R.J. Sagawa N. Casey M.L. Snyder J. In Vitro. 1983; 19: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). For this reason the effect of cell volume expansion on COX-2 mRNA expression was determined on primary human amnion cells prepared from placentae of women undergoing repeat cesarean section (Fig.7). Relative to cells incubated for 1 h in isotonic EBSS, COX-2 mRNA was markedly elevated in cells incubated in hypotonic EBSS. The increased concentration of"

ProOmpA2xH1 did not interfere with the transit of wild-type proOmpA. When proOmpA2xH1 was anchored in the membrane, membrane-inserted SecA was deinserted with the reversion of the inverted topology of SecG. Cross-linking experiments revealed that the anchored proOmpA2xH1 that does not interact with either SecY or SecA. These results, taken together, suggest that proOmpA2xH1 leaves the translocation pathway by means of a specific interaction between the stop-transfer sequence and the translocational channel.

In Escherichia coli, the translocation of proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane is mediated through protein-protein interactions involving a set of Sec proteins (1Schatz P.J. Beckwith J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1990; 24: 215-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 2Wickner W. Driessen A.J.M. Hartl F.U. Annu. Rev.

Secretory proteins are synthesized with an NH2-terminal signal sequence that targets them for export. The amino-terminal positive charges and central hydrophobic region of the signal sequence are important for the interaction of preproteins with SecA (5Akita M. Sasaki S. Matsuyama S. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8164-8169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a translocation ATPase (6Lill R. Cunningham K. Brundage L.A. Ito K. Oliver D. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 961-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Upon the binding of ATP and a preprotein, SecA changes its conformation (7Shinkai A. Mei L.H. Tokuda H. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5827-5833Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a portion of SecA is inserted deep into the cytoplasmic membrane (8Economou A. Wickner W. Cell. 1994; 78: 835-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 9Kim Y.J. Rajapandi T. Oliver D. Cell. 1994; 78: 845-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), which can be detected as the appearance of a protease-resistant ∼30-kDa fragment (8Economou A. Wickner W. Cell. 1994; 78: 835-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). The hydrolysis of ATP results in deinsertion of the SecA (10Economou A. Pogliano J.A. Beckwith J. Oliver D.B. Wickner W. Cell. 1995; 83: 1171-1181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Coupled with this insertion-deinsertion cycle, the membrane topology of SecG becomes inverted (11Nishiyama K.-i. Suzuki T. Tokuda H. Cell. 1996; 85: 71-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). SecG, SecE, and SecY are components of the membrane-embedded translocase (3Matsuyama S. Mizushima S. Adv. Cell Mol. Biol. Membr. Organelles. 1995; 4: 61-84Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar) that provides a proteinaceous channel for the transit of preproteins (12Joly J.C. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The transit of preproteins across the membrane is stopped by particular amino acid sequences termed “stop-transfer sequence” (13Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1496-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). Although the hydrophobicity of the stop-transfer sequence is important for its function, the details of the mechanism of the stop-transfer process remains unclear. One possibility is that the stop-transfer sequence specifically interacts with the translocase via its hydrophobic region, and induces a conformational change of the translocase (14Byoct C.S. Lopez C.D. Prusiner S.B. Myers R.M. Lingappa V.R. Nature. 1990; 343: 669-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Another possibility is that the stop-transfer sequence simply leaves the translocase as a consequence of the interaction with the hydrophobic core of the lipid bilayer (15Singer S.J. Maher P.A. Yaffe M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1960-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Previously, we showed that the short hydrophobic segments in the mature region of proOmpA interact with the membrane translocase during polypeptide transit across the cytoplasmic membrane of E. coli (16Sato K. Mori H. Yoshida M. Tagaya M. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5880-5886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), which causes a discontinuous mode of polypeptide translocation (17Uchida K. Mori H. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30862-30868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These segments are less hydrophobic than the threshold required for the cessation of polypeptide transit. However, when such a short hydrophobic segment was duplicated, the resultant segment showed substantial stop-translocation activity (16Sato K. Mori H. Yoshida M. Tagaya M. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5880-5886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In this study, using a derivative of proOmpA containing the stop-transfer segment, we analyzed the process of stop-transfer. Based on the results obtained, we propose that the hydrophobic stop-transfer segment leaves the translocation pathway by means of a specific interaction between the hydrophobic segment and the translocation channel, which triggers the stop-transfer.

Ni2+-NTA-agarose was from QIAGEN. A polyclonal anti-SecG antibody was kindly provided by Drs. K.-i. Nishiyama and H. Tokuda. A horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody was from Bio-Rad. Everted membrane vesicles for in vitro translocation were isolated from E. coli K003 (Lpp − , ΔuncB-C-Tn10) as described previously (25Yamada H. Tokuda H. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1723-1728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SecA was purified as described previously (5Akita M. Sasaki S. Matsuyama S. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8164-8169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The wild-type and mutant proOmpAs were purified as described by Crookeet al. (26Crooke E. Guthrie B. Lecker S. Lill R. Wickner W. Cell. 1988; 54: 1003-1011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) from E. coli RK4788 harboring the plasmids encoding them, and the disulfide bridge of proOmpAL43 was formed according to the method of Uchida et al. (17Uchida K. Mori H. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30862-30868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). SecB was purified as described by Weiss et al. (27Weiss, J. B., Ray, P. H., and Bassford, P. J. J. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 8978–8982.Google Scholar). All proOmpA derivatives used for the in vitro translocation reactions were synthesized in vitro in the presence of EXPRE35S35S protein labeling mix (NEN Life Science Products), and partially purified as described previously (17Uchida K. Mori H. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30862-30868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Plasmids pOA43, pTDL43, and pTDL43C302Q were prepared as described previously (16Sato K. Mori H. Yoshida M. Tagaya M. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5880-5886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To add a His6 tag to the carboxyl terminus of proOmpA2xH1, oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was performed according to the method of Kunkel (28Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4881) Google Scholar). For the detection of mutation, anAflII site was also deleted. Plasmid pTD-2xH1 (16Sato K. Mori H. Yoshida M. Tagaya M. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5880-5886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) was transformed into E. coli CJ236, and then the uracil-containing single-stranded phagemid DNA was isolated. Using a primer (5′-ACCAGACGAGAACTTAATGGTGATGGTGATGGTGAGCCTGCGGCTGAG-3′ the mutated AflII site is underlined), the complementary DNA strand was synthesized, and the resulting double-stranded DNA was transformed into JM109. Plasmid pTD-2xH1-His6 was isolated on the basis of a lack of the AlfII site. Plasmids pKS-ompA and pKS-2xH1 were prepared by the insertion of a 1.3-kilobase pair EcoRI-HindIII fragment of pOA13 and pTD-2xH1, respectively, into the corresponding site of pSTV28. Cells of RK4788 harboring pKS-ompA or pKS-2xH1 were grown in LB medium, and at A 600 = 0.6 the cells were harvested. Half of the cells were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid to give a “whole cell” sample. The other half were pelleted, and then inner membrane vesicles were isolated according to the method of Yamada et al. (25Yamada H. Tokuda H. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1723-1728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). KI297 cells harboring pST30 and pTD-2xH1-His6 were cultured until the mid-log phase in LB medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin, 10 μg/ml chrolamphenicol, and 0.4% glucose. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 2.5 mm to induce His6-tagged proOmpA2xH1 as well as to overexpress Syd, which causes a severe secretion defect (23Shimoike T.

After 2–3 h, the cells were collected and subjected to N-lauroylsarcosine solubilization as described by Crooke et al. (26Crooke E. Guthrie B. Lecker S. Lill R. Wickner W. Cell. 1988; 54: 1003-1011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The final pellet was suspended in 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 6m urea, 0.5 m NaCl, and 5 mmimidazole with continuous vortexing, followed by centrifugation to remove cell debris. The soluble fraction was applied to a Ni2+-NTA-agarose column and washed with a washing buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 6 m urea, 0.5m NaCl and 60 mm imidazole). His6-tagged proOmpA2xH1 was then eluted with an elution buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 6 m urea, 0.5m NaCl, and 1 m imidazole). The protein eluted was precipitated with 7.5% trichloroacetic acid, washed with acetone, and then dissolved in 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5) and 6 m urea. Purified SecA was iodinated according to the method of Economou and Wickner (8Economou A. Wickner W. Cell. 1994; 78: 835-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar) with a minor modification, as described below. Na125I and SecA were incubated on ice for 20 min in a tube that had been coated with IODOGEN. The reaction mixture was transferred to another tube containing 2 mm dithiothreitol to stop iodination, and then applied to a Sephadex G-50 column to remove Na125I. To prepare 125I-SecA-bound membrane vesicles, 4 nm125I-SecA and 200 μg/ml urea-washed membrane vesicles were incubated for 15 min on ice in 100 μl of a reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). The membrane vesicles were isolated and then resuspended in the same buffer. 125I-SecA-bound membrane vesicles, 50 μg/ml SecB, 5 mm phosphocreatine, creatine kinase (10 μg/ml), and 20 μg/ml proOmpAL43 or proOmpA2xH1 were preincubated in the reaction buffer for 2 min at 37 °C (800 μl each). One hundred μl was removed as a control at time 0, and then insertion of SecA was initiated by the addition of 1 mmATP, and 100-μl aliquots were removed as indicated. The aliquots were digested with proteinase K (final, 0.1 mg/ml) for 20 min on ice. The proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, and then analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by fluorography and quantification. Membrane topology analysis of SecG was performed according to the method of Nishiyama et al. (11Nishiyama K.-i. Suzuki T. Tokuda H. Cell. 1996; 85: 71-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The translocation mixture (total, 120 μl) comprised 0.2 mg/ml membrane vesicles, 60 μg/ml SecA, 50 μg/ml SecB, 25 μg/ml proOmpA derivative, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm MgSO4, 10 mm creatine phosphate, and 100 μg/ml creatine kinase in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5. Translocation mixtures containing proOmpAL43 or proOmpA2xH1 were incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times, and then 10 mm AMP-PNP and 10 mm MgSO4 were added. After 5 min of incubation at 37 °C, the reaction mixtures were chilled on ice for 2 min, and then aliquots (20 μl) were treated with 20 μl of proteinase K at the indicated concentrations on ice for 30 min. The samples were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, washed with acetone, and then analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by immunoblotting with an anti-SecG antibody. The translated 35S-labeled proOmpA derivatives were subjected to in vitro translocation essentially according to the method of Uchida et al. (17Uchida K. Mori H. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30862-30868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The translocation mixture (25 μl) comprised a 35S-labeled proOmpA derivative, membrane vesicles (5 μg of protein), 2 mm ATP (or 10 μm ATP) or 10 mm AMP-PNP, 5 mmMgSO4, 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), 15 μg/ml SecB, and 40 μg/ml SecA. A cold proOmpA derivative was added to a final concentration of 5 μg/ml, if necessary. The ATP concentration was maintained through regeneration with 10 mm creatine phosphate and 10 μg/ml creatine kinase. After a 10-min incubation at 37 °C, the mixture was treated with proteinase K (200 μg/ml) for 20 min at 0 °C, subjected to trichloroacetic acid precipitation, and then analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by fluorography. A proOmpA derivative, proOmpAL43C302Q, was prepared as described previously (16Sato K. Mori H. Yoshida M. Tagaya M. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5880-5886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). ProOmpA2xH1C, in which Ser-233 in proOmpA2xH1 was replaced with a cysteine residue, was also constructed as described above. 35S-Labeled proOmpA derivatives were conjugated with APDP (N-[4-(p-azidosalicylamido)butyl]-3′-(2′-pyridyldithio)propionamide) via Cys-260 or Cys-233 according to the method of Joly and Wickner (12Joly J.C. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Briefly, APDP was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (3 mg in 50 μl), and then diluted 200-fold with 100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5). To 70 μl of the 35S-labeled proOmpA dissolved in 6 m urea and 100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5) was added 100 μl of diluted APDP. After 1 h at room temperature, the proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and then washed with acetone twice, and the washed precipitate was dissolved in 6 m urea and 50 mmpotassium phosphate (pH 7.5). After thein vitro translocation reaction and photolysis as described previously (16Sato K. Mori H. Yoshida M. Tagaya M. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5880-5886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), samples were solubilized in a solution comprising 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, and 1% SDS, diluted 33-fold with dilution buffer consisting of 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 100 μm5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), and 0.1% Triton X-100, and then mixed with an appropriate antibody, anti-SecY or anti-SecA. After incubation at 4 °C for 1.5 h, the antigen-antibody complexes were precipitated with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B. The resin was washed with dilution buffer, and then incubated in the sample buffer for electrophoresis at 37 °C for 5 min to recover the bound proteins. An enzyme-coupled spectrophotometric assay involving pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase was performed as described (29Tokuda H. Yamanaka M. Mizushima S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The cuvette was maintained at 37 °C, and contained 1 ml of 50 mmpotassium phosphate (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mmMgSO4, 3 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.25 mm NADH, 1 mm ATP, 5 mm KCN, 10 units of pyruvate kinase and 15 units of lactate dehydrogenase, a specified amount of urea-treated membrane vesicles containing overproduced SecY/E/G, and 20 μg/ml SecB. The assay was started by the addition of SecA (10 μg). ProOmpA derivatives were subsequently added to a final concentration of 20 μg/ml. Oxidation of NADH was continuously monitored at 340 nm with a Shimadzu UV-3000 spectrophotometer, and the amount of ATP hydrolyzed was calculated by using a value of 6.22 for the millimolar absorption coefficient of NADH. The values were corrected for background ATP hydrolysis. After the formation of in vitro translocation intermediates as described above, an aliquot of the reaction mixture was removed, without the proteinase K treatment, and centrifuged to isolate membranes. The membranes were suspended in the original volume of ice-cold 0.2 mNa2CO3 (pH 11), vortexed, and then incubated for 30 min on ice. The solution was centrifuged to separate the soluble and membrane-associated fractions. Each fraction was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, and then analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by fluorography. We previously demonstrated that short hydrophobic segments in the mature domain of proOmpA are transiently arrested in the Sec machinery during the polypeptide movement across the cytoplasmic membrane of E. coli in vitro (16Sato K. Mori H. Yoshida M. Tagaya M. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5880-5886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To confirm that the hydrophobicity of the segments is important for this transient arrest, we duplicated a hydrophobic segment referred to as H1 (residues 233–237), creating proOmpA2xH1. The resulting segment (2xH1; residues 229–237) comprising 8 hydrophobic amino acids stopped polypeptide translocation and acted as a stable membrane anchor (16Sato K. Mori H. Yoshida M. Tagaya M. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5880-5886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The extent of translocation arrest was similar (92%) when the in vitro translocation reaction was performed in the presence of a proton motive force (data not shown). To determine whether or not proOmpA2xH1 is located in the cytoplasmic membrane not only in vitro but also in vivo, we prepared inner membrane vesicles from spheroplasts of RK4788 cells (ΔompA) harboring a low copy plasmid encoding proOmpA2xH1 or wild-type proOmpA without the induction of the proteins. As shown in Fig. 1, most proOmpA2xH1 was partitioned in the inner membrane fraction (84%) (lane 6), while little, if any, wild-type proOmpA was associated with the inner membrane (lane 4). These results suggest that 2xH1 acts as a membrane anchor in vivo as well as in vitro. As a first step to understand the process of membrane anchoring of proOmpA2xH1, we examined whether or not the translocation channel is occupied by an anchored 2xH1 segment. For this purpose, wild-type 35S-proOmpA was subjected to in vitrotranslocation in the presence of excess cold proOmpA2xH1 or wild-type proOmpA. As shown in Fig. 2, excess wild-type proOmpA completely blocked the translocation of wild-type35S-proOmpA, whereas excess proOmpA2xH1 only delayed the translocation. These results suggest that the translocation-interrupted proOmpA2xH1 had left the translocation apparatus, and that the mechanism of membrane anchoring of proOmpA2xH1 is somehow different from that of the translocation of wild-type proOmpA. To investigate the process of membrane anchoring in more detail, we examined how the presence of a stop-transfer sequence affects the insertion-deinsertion cycle of SecA. SecA changes its conformation in the presence of ATP and a preprotein (7Shinkai A. Mei L.H. Tokuda H. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5827-5833Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This conformational change causes SecA to become inserted deep into the membrane, and the inserted portion of a 30-kDa fragment is resistant to protease treatment. Upon ATP hydrolysis, SecA changes its conformation again and thereby becomes deinserted from the membrane (8Economou A. Wickner W. Cell. 1994; 78: 835-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.3, in the presence of looped proOmpAL43, whose translocation is interrupted by the intramolecular disulfide-bridged loop comprising 43 amino acid residues (17Uchida K. Mori H. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30862-30868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), the 30-kDa fragment was formed in an ATP-dependent manner, and its amount increased with time, reaching steady state after 15 min. This time course is similar to that of wild-type proOmpA (10Economou A. Pogliano J.A. Beckwith J. Oliver D.B. Wickner W. Cell. 1995; 83: 1171-1181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). When the membrane insertion was conducted in the presence of proOmpA2xH1, accumulation of the membrane-inserted form of SecA was completed within 5–6 min, and subsequently deinsertion was observed. SecA-proOmpA2xH1 interaction is maintained through 20 min, as revealed by the sensitivity of SecA to protease V8 (7Shinkai A. Mei L.H. Tokuda H. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5827-5833Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that the result is not for the aggregation of proOmpA2xH1 (data not shown). The ATPase activity of SecA is remarkably enhanced by the membrane translocase, acidic lipids (30Cunningham K. Lill R. Crooke E. Rice M. Moore K. Wickner W. Oliver D. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 955-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), and preproteins (31Lill R. Dowhan W. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 60: 271-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). This enhanced ATPase activity is referred to as translocation ATPase activity. We next examined the effect of proOmpA2xH1 on the ATPase activity of SecA. ProOmpAL43 enhanced the ATPase activity of SecA to a similar extent to that observed for wild-type proOmpA (Fig. 4). This may imply that enhanced ATP hydrolysis continues even when polypeptide transition is blocked by an intramolecular disulfide-bridged loop. Similar results were observed when translocation was blocked by a derivative of proOmpA carrying a side chain of 20 amino acid residues via a cysteine residue (32Schiebel E. Driessen A.J.M. Hartl F.-U. Wickner W. Cell. 1991; 64: 927-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Although proOmpA2xH1 also enhanced the ATPase activity of SecA, the enhancement lasted for only approximately 100 s. The lack of enhancement after 100 s is not due to the inactivation of SecA because the addition of wild-type proOmpA caused reactivation of ATP hydrolysis. We next examined how the presence of a stop-transfer sequence influences the topology inversion of SecG (11Nishiyama K.-i. Suzuki T. Tokuda H. Cell. 1996; 85: 71-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). SecG possesses two transmembrane regions, and its amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions are located in the periplasm. In everted membrane vesicles, proteinase K cleaves sites close to the NH2 terminus of 11.4-kDa SecG, producing a 9-kDa fragment. This fragment is immunodetected by anti-SecG, which recognizes the carboxyl-terminal 16 amino acid residues of SecG, because the COOH-terminal region is located inside the vesicles. In the presence of ATP and proOmpA, on the other hand, no fragment is detected by the antibody because the COOH-terminal region is cleavable by proteinase K as a consequence of the inversion of the membrane topology of SecG (11Nishiyama K.-i. Suzuki T. Tokuda H. Cell. 1996; 85: 71-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Consistent with the previous results (11Nishiyama K.-i. Suzuki T. Tokuda H. Cell. 1996; 85: 71-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), the 9-kDa protease-resistant fragment was formed when SecA was incubated with everted membrane vesicles in the absence of a preprotein (Fig.5 A). When translocation was conducted in the presence proOmpAL43 and blocked by the addition of AMP-PNP at 3 min, the 9-kDa fragment was not formed (Fig.5 B). Although the previous study showed that SecG is almost completely cleaved by proteinase K under the translocation conditions (11Nishiyama K.-i. Suzuki T. Tokuda H. Cell. 1996; 85: 71-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), we found that only a small amount of SecG was cleaved in the presence of proOmpAL43. A similar result was obtained when wild-type proOmpA was used (data not shown). Perhaps the COOH-terminal region of SecG is present on the outside of membrane vesicles, but is not completely exposed and therefore is inaccessible to proteinase K. However, it is obvious that SecG changes its conformation in both preprotein- and ATP-dependent manners, as revealed by the changes in the proteolytic patterns. This conformational change was maintained for at least 15 min. When translocation was conducted in the presence of proOmpA2xH1 and terminated at 3 min, the proteolytic pattern was essentially the same as that observed in the presence of proOmpAL43 (Fig. 5 C). In contrast, when translocation was stopped at 15 min, the proteolytic pattern was remarkably different from that observed in the presence of proOmpAL43, and rather similar to that observed in the absence of the preprotein. These results, taken together, suggest that proOmpA2xH1 containing a stop-transfer sequence is translocated through the normal translocation pathway at an early stage, but leaves the pathway at a later stage of translocation. To directly demonstrate that proOmpA2xH1 does not interact with the translocation machinery at a later stage of translocation, we performed a cross-linking experiment using a photoactivable and reducible cross-linker, APDP. We previously used this reagent and demonstrated that a translocation intermediate of a looped proOmpA interacts with SecY and partly with SecA (16Sato K. Mori H. Yoshida M. Tagaya M. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5880-5886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We replaced a serine residue (Ser-233) in the middle of the 2xH1 segment with a cysteine residue (proOmpA2xH1C) (Fig. 6 A), and then APDP was attached to this cysteine residue. After photolysis, SecA and SecY were immunoprecipitated with anti-SecA and anti-SecY, respectively, and the precipitates were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of dithiothreitol to cleave the cross-linked proteins. As shown in Fig. 6 B, a significant amount of cross-linked 35S-proOmpA2xH1 was not immunoprecipitated by either anti-SecA (lane 4) or anti-SecY (lane 5). This is not due to the inability to photo-cross-link the derivative of proOmpA2xH1 with a Cys residue in the 2xH1 region with APDP to the Sec machinery. When the deinsertion of SecA was blocked by the addition of AMP-PNP, as described in Fig.7 B, prior to photolysis, a significant amount of cross-linked 35S-proOmpA2xH1 was immunoprecipitated by either anti-SecA (lane 2) or anti-SecY (lane 3). These results suggest that the 2xH1 segment transiently interacts with the Sec machinery. Once anchored, the 2xH1 region could not interact with the Sec machinery.Figure 7Membrane anchoring of translocation-interrupted proOmpA derivatives to everted membrane vesicles. A, in vitro translocation of proOmpA derivatives was performed in the presence of everted membrane vesicles, and after the membranes had been isolated, the samples were treated with 0.2 m Na2CO3. Supernatant (S) and membrane (P) fractions were obtained by centrifugation, and then analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography. B, after the formation ofin vitro translocation intermediates as described above, 10 mm MgSO4 and 10 mm AMP-PNP were added to block the SecA movement prior to alkali extraction. The bands indicated by an arrowhead correspond to the mature form of the proOmpA derivatives.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To assess the state of proOmpA2xH1 anchored in the membrane, membrane proteins were extracted with 0.2 mNa2CO3 (pH 11) after completion of the translocation reaction. This alkali treatment extracts all peripheral membrane proteins and uninserted polytopic membrane proteins in mammalian cells (33Russel M. Model P. Cell. 1982; 28: 177-184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 34Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar) and in bacterial cells (22Ito K. Akiyama Y. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 2243-2253Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 35Chen H. Kendall D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14115-14122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 7 A, 60% of the anchored proOmpA2xH1 was partitioned into the alkali soluble fraction, whereas 17% of the translocation intermediate of the looped proOmpA was observed in the same fraction (Fig. 7 A). When AMP-PNP was added to inhibit the deinsertion of SecA from the membrane prior to alkali extraction, both proOmpAL43 and proOmpA2xH1 were almost exclusively recovered in the membrane fraction (Fig. 7 B). When NaN3, an inhibitor of SecA (36Oliver D. Cabelli R. Dolan K. Jarosik G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8227-8231Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), was included in the translocation assay mixture, the association of proOmpA derivatives with the membrane was not observed (data not shown), suggesting that the membrane association was mediated by SecA. These results suggest that proOmpA2xH1 is released from the membrane-embedded Sec machinery as the deinsertion of SecA occurs. In this study we examined the stop-transfer process of a proOmpA derivative containing a stop-transfer sequence (proOmpA2xH1). The use of an in vitro translocation system enabled us to analyze the translocation process at defined stages of polypeptide transfer. The major conclusion of this study is that when the transfer of a polypeptide is halted by a stop-transfer sequence, the preprotein leaves the functional translocation site, which allows the passage of the following preprotein molecule. Cross-linking analysis confirmed that the membrane-anchored hydrophobic segment is located outside the translocation channel. Our data also showed that the cessation of translocation causes deinsertion of SecA and the return the inverted topology of SecG to the original one. Alkali extraction experiments revealed that the state of proOmpA2xH1 anchored in the membrane is different from that of the translocation intermediate formed as a consequence of the presence of an intramolecular loop. When deinsertion of SecA was interrupted by AMP-PNP, proOmpA2xH1, as well as the looped proOmpA, was not extracted on alkali treatment. It has been proposed that secretory proteins are translocated across the cytoplasmic membrane through a proteinaceous channel (12Joly J.C. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). When a segment with moderate hydrophobicity enters the translocation channel, the passage of the polypeptide is interrupted and the preprotein is excluded from the the channel. There are two possible explanations for this mechanism. First, translocation arrest may be triggered by an interaction between the hydrophobic stop-transfer segment and the hydrocarbon of the phospholipid, and then the hydrophobic segment spontaneously leaves the translocase. Second, the translocation apparatus itself may recognize the hydrophobic segment, and decide to continue its transfer or to integrate it into the membrane. In the former case, the stop-transfer process is dependent on the affinity of the hydrophobic segment with the hydrophobic core of the lipid bilayer. If this is the case, it is reasonable to assume that the anchored segment would be spontaneously integrated into the lipid bilayer regardless of whether SecA is deinserted or not. However, alkali extraction experiments in the presence of AMP-PNP revealed that the anchored segment remains in the translocase unless SecA is deinserted, suggesting that the polypeptide is not spontaneously integrated into the membrane. Therefore, the second of the above two alternatives seems to be more likely. We recently demonstrated that the short hydrophobic segments within the mature region of a preprotein promote translocation stalling. This event seems to be at least partly due to an interaction between the hydrophobic stretch and the translocase (16Sato K. Mori H. Yoshida M. Tagaya M. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5880-5886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Here, we propose that the hydrophobic segment itself functions as a kind of “integration signal” for Sec-dependent insertion of membrane proteins, such as type I membrane protein (having only a single transmembrane segment and its carboxyl terminus located on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane). The entrance of a stop-transfer sequence of a preprotein into the translocation channel may trigger the release of SecA from the translocase and thereby allows the preprotein to leave the active translocation site. This indicates that the discrimination between secretory proteins and membrane proteins is conducted by the translocase that can estimate the hydrophobicity of the polypeptide chain of preproteins. The results described in this study are consistent with this proposal. We thank Drs. K. Ito and Y. Akiyama of the Kyoto University for strain KI297, plasmid pST30, and valuable discussion."

Disruption of this gene is lethal for cell growth at 30 °C indicating that it is an essential gene for vegetative cell growth. Western analysis of the protein by polyclonal antibody made from glutathioneS-transferase-Psp1 fusion protein indicated that the Psp1 protein exists in two different molecular weight forms depending on the growth state of the cell. In vitro experiments with a phosphatase showed that this difference is due to phosphorylation. The dephosphorylated form of the protein is dominant in actively growing cells whereas the phosphorylated form becomes the major species when cells enter the stationary phase. The Cdc2-Cdc13 complex is shown to phosphorylate the GST-Psp1 fusion protein in vitro, and site-directed mutagenesis and phosphoamino acid analysis indicated that the serine residue at position 333 in the carboxyl-terminal region is required for phosphorylation. In situ fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody staining showed that this protein tends to be localized to both ends of the cell upon entry into the stationary phase of cell growth. However, overexpression of the novel protein Psp1 in actively growing cells inhibits cell growth causing accumulation of DNA (4n or 8n). Thus we speculate that Psp1 can function at both G1/S and G2/M phases complementing the defect of the new mutant we have isolated. It is likely that Psp1 is required both for proper DNA replication and for the process of mitosis.

It is likely that Psp1 is required both for proper DNA replication and for the process of mitosis. DNA replication (S) and mitosis (M) are the two major events in the eukaryotic cell division cycle and are proceeded by the two gap periods, G1 and G2, respectively. Cell cycle transition from G1 to S phase (G1/S) and from G2 to mitosis (G2/M) occurs in a strict sequence. Blocking S phase prevents onset of the subsequent mitosis, which would be lethal if chromosome replication had not been completed, and blocking mitosis prevents initiation of the subsequent S phase which would otherwise lead to increase in ploidy. Dependences of S phase and mitosis are examples of checkpoints that ensure orderly progression through the cell cycle. Many genes are thought to be involved in this process, and tight regulation of function or expression of the relevant genes is required for proper cell cycle progression. The checkpoint control at the two transition points, G1/S and G2/M, ensures either progression or blocking of cell cycle according to the state of the cell.

CDK activity is subject to regulation by association with positive regulatory subunits known as cyclins, negative regulators known as CDK inhibitors (CKIs), and by phosphorylation (reviewed by Pines (3Pines J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1995; 66: 181-212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Morgan (4Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2933) Google Scholar), Elledge and Harper (5Elledge S.J.

Dev. 1996; 6: 56-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar)). The balanced function of these factors controls CDK activity and serves to integrate signals intended to coordinate cell cycle transitions. The levels of these proteins are tightly regulated both transcriptionally and post-translationally as the cell cycle progresses.

The phosphorylation state of the CDK itself and proper timing of destruction of the cyclins are important for regulation of CDK activities (4Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2933) Google Scholar). Thus checkpoint control at G1/S by these multiple elements is important for the cell to commence DNA replication, to initiate the cell cycle, and to integrate the positive and negative signals of the cell cycle. At the second checkpoint, G2/M, p34 cdc2, the prototypic member of cyclin-dependent kinase, is known to be the major regulator both in yeast and mammalian cells. Association with G2 cyclins such as cyclin B is required to function as an active protein kinase and to induce active mitosis (23Knoblich J.A. Lehner C.F.

Cell. 1995; 81: 149-152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The CKIs such as p21, p27, or p15, which have negative function to inhibit CDK activity (5Elledge S.J. Harper J.W.

Mutations in CKI genes cause unregulated cell cycle progression, and this results in abnormal cell growth. In particular, deregulation of START at G1/S may allow cell growth and division to become insensitive to external cues (36Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J.

This can be a consequence of either the aberrant expression of positive regulators, such as the cyclins, or the loss of negative regulators, such as the CKIs.

Fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe has been a useful model organism to study cell cycle control in eukaryotic cells. The relative ease of genetic manipulation of yeast has allowed detailed analysis of gene function in vivo, which has produced a paradigm for cell cycle control applicable to higher organisms. In an attempt to isolate factors involved in control of cell cycle progression, we searched for new cell cycle-related genes in S. pombe. In this paper we describe isolation of a novel gene,psp1 + (a gene encodingphosphoprotein at stationary phase of S.pombe cell), essential for progression of cell cycle. We used a strategy to isolate a new conditional mutant defective in cell cycle progression by chemical mutagenesis and to find a clone functionally complementing this mutant phenotype. Genetic and biochemical studies have permitted us to identify the function of the newly isolated psp1 + in S. pombecells. The newly isolated temperature-sensitive (ts−) mutant was derived from a haploid strain, ED665 (h−, ade6-M210, ura4-D18,leu1-32). For gene disruption analysis and back-crossing test, a S. pombe diploid strain, SP286 (h+/h+,ade6-M210/ade6-M216,ura4-D18/ura4-D18,leu1-32/leu1-32) and a haploid strain, ED668 (h+, ade6-M216, ura4-D18,leu1-32) were used. For genetic complementation tests and comparative flow cytometric analysis, the known cell cycle mutants,cdc2 −, cdc10 −,cdc20 −, and cdc22 − andwee1 − were used. YE-glucose (YEPD) agar medium and Edinburgh minimal medium (EMM) were used as described by Gutzet al. (49Gutz H. Heslot H. Leupold U. Loprieno N. King R.C. Handbook of Genetics. 1. Plenum Press, New York1974: 395-446Google Scholar). When necessary, 75 μg/ml each of adenine and uracil or 250 μg/ml leucine was added as a supplement. Phloxin B (Sigma) was added to the YEPD and minimal agar medium at a concentration of 20 mg/liter after autoclave. 50–500 μmthiamine was added to EMM to repress the nmt1 promoter function, and it was excluded from EMM when induction of thenmt1 promoter function is necessary. For in vivocell labeling with ortho [32P]phosphate, phosphate-free minimal medium (MMP) in the presence of 1 mmphosphate (added from a 0.5 mNaH2PO4 stock solution) or 50 μmphosphate was used (50Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3140) Google Scholar). To isolate ts− mutants ofS. pombe, ED665 cells grown in YEPD medium were mutagenized with ethylmethanesulfonate (EMS) to 40% survival as described previously (51Nurse P. Thuriaux P. Nasmyth K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1976; 146: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar, 52Jang Y.J. Kim D.U. Lee H.J. Yoo H.S. Mol. Cell. 1994; 4: 419-428Google Scholar). The mutagenized cells were spread on YEPD plates and incubated at 23 °C for 4–6 days. The cells grown on the plates were replica-plated onto YEPD plates containing phloxin B, and the plates were incubated at 23, 36, and 39 °C for 3–4 days. The cells that grew at 23 °C but did not grow at 36 or 39 °C were selected. Out of 2.5 × 105 cells mutagenized, 180 candidate colonies were first selected and examined for their morphological changes at the restrictive temperature (36 °C) under a light microscope. The 51 colonies that showed defects in cell division were further characterized by back-crossing to the parent strain ED665 or ED668 and by genetic complementation test with the known cell division cycle mutants. Their DNA contents at 36 °C were determined by flow cytometrical analysis as described in Jang et al. (52Jang Y.J. Kim D.U. Lee H.J. Yoo H.S. Mol. Cell. 1994; 4: 419-428Google Scholar). One mutant, cyj92, that showed an elongated morphology at 36 °C and a defect in cell cycle progression both at G1/S and after G2, was selected and used to clone a gene recovering the mutated phenotype. To measure DNA content in each cell cycle point, the cells were prepared by a procedure adapted from Lew et al. (53Lew D.J. Dulic V. Reed S.I. Cell. 1991; 66: 1197-1206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar) and Costello et al. (54Costello G. Rodgers L. Beach D. Curr. Genet. 1986; 11: 119-125Crossref Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The mutant cells were first grown in YEPD liquid medium at 23 °C to midlog phase (A 580 = 0.5) and transferred either directly to fresh YEPD medium or to nitrogen-deficient EMM (0.003% NH4Cl) which leads to cell cycle arrest at G1in S. pombe. The cells transferred to EMM were incubated at 23 °C for 24–36 h to induce cell cycle arrest at G1, and were then collected, washed, and resuspended in YEPD medium. The cells transferred to YEPD medium were incubated at 36 °C for 4–8 h to induce mutant phenotype. Aliquots of these cells (1 × 107 cells) were collected, fixed with 70% ethanol for at least 12 h at 4 °C, and treated with RNase A (Sigma, 0.1 mg/ml) for 2 h at 37 °C. After staining the cells with propidium iodide solution (0.005% propidium iodide, 0.1% sodium citrate, and 0.03% Triton X-100), the DNAs in the cells were analyzed with Becton Dickinson FACScan System (FACScanTM). Analysis was based on the accumulation of 8,000–10,000 cells. As a reference, flow cytometric analysis of the mutant cdc2 − orcdc10 − was carried out simultaneously. To measure DNA content in cells overexpressingpsp1 +, the cells containing pnmt1-psp1 plasmid were first grown in EMM containing 100 μm thiamine and then transferred to EMM devoid of thiamine and grown for 12 h. Aliquots of the cells were reinoculated into fresh EMM lacking thiamine to a cell densityA 580 = 0.1 and incubated at 30 °C. Cell samples were collected thereafter every 3 h and subjected to flow cytometric analysis. To examine the expression pattern of the psp1 + gene during cell cycle progression, synchronized cell cultures were used. The cells arrested at S phase by hydroxyurea or M phase by thiabendazole were used (55Mitchison J.M. Creanor J. Exp. Cell Res. 1971; 69: 244-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 56Toda T.

IRL Press, Oxford1993: 93-125Google Scholar). ED665 cells were first grown in EMM to a cell density ofA 580 = 0.5 (1 × 107 cells/ml) and then in the presence of 12 mm hydroxyurea or 100 μm thiabendazole at 30 °C for an additional 4–5 h to arrest them at S or M phase, respectively. The cells were then collected by filtration, washed, transferred to fresh EMM, and incubated at 30 °C to release them from S or M phase arrest. Aliquots of the cells were collected every 20 min thereafter and counted. Total RNA was prepared from these cell samples. To identify a gene responsible for blockage of cell cycle progression when mutated as shown in the mutant cyj92, a functional complementation test of the mutant with a S. pombe genomic library was carried out. The mutant cyj92, showing an elongated morphology and defect in cell cycle progression at 36 °C, was transformed with a S. pombe genomic library prepared by ligating genomic DNA partially digested with Sau3AI into theBclI site of pWH5 vector (58Wright A. Maundrell K. Heyer W.D. Beach D. Nurse P. Plasmid. 1986; 15: 156-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar,59Beach D. Nurse P.

The transformants showing Leu+ at 23 °C were first selected, replica-plated onto the plates containing phloxin B, and incubated at 36 °C. The pink colonies that grew up and showed wild type morphology at 36 °C were selected. Individual plasmid isolated from these transformants was retransformed to test its ability to suppress the elongated ts− phenotype of cyj92 (50Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3140) Google Scholar). Two such plasmids, containing 8.5-kb and 6.9-kb insert DNA, were isolated and characterized by restriction enzyme mapping and Southern hybridization. The 4.2-kbSau3AI-PvuII fragment present in both of these plasmids and possessing the suppressive function was subcloned (Fig.2 a, pYJ4) and sequenced by the dideoxy method of Sangeret al. (60Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52649) Google Scholar) with USB Sequenase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). cDNA clones were also isolated by screening a S. pombecDNA library constructed in the λ-ZAP vector (61Park S.K. Chon S.K. Yoo H.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1262: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) with the labeled 1.5-kb PvuII-BamHI fragment encoding most of the coding sequences. The DNA containing open reading frame sequences was designated as psp1 +(phosphoprotein of stationary phase of S.pombe). The disruption construct of thepsp1 gene, with the ura4 + as the selectable marker, was made as follows (Fig. 2 a, pYJ5). ThePvuII-EcoRV fragment containing most of the Psp1 coding sequences, including 5′-nontranslating region DNA, was deleted and replaced with the 1.8-kb ura4 + fragment. The resulting 3.5-kb BamHI-ApaI fragment was used to transform a diploid strain SP286. Transplacement of the genomicpsp1 gene with the ura4 + disrupted copy was confirmed by Southern analysis. The disrupted diploid strain was then sporulated according to the methods of Gutz et al.(49Gutz H. Heslot H. Leupold U. Loprieno N. King R.C. Handbook of Genetics. 1. Plenum Press, New York1974: 395-446Google Scholar), and viability of the resulting meiotic products was analyzed (Fig. 2 c).Figure 2Sequence of psp1 + gene complementing the mutant phenotype of a novel ts−mutant cyj92. a, map of genomic clones and their subclones complementing the mutant phenotype of cyj92 and a disruption clone. + indicates suppression of the mutant phenotype. b, nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence of psp1 + gene.Lowercase and uppercase letters indicate genomic and cDNA sequences, respectively. The arrowheadsindicate the start sites and the end of two cDNAs. The short intron sequence at the 5′-nontranslating region is absent in the cDNA clone 1. The potential Cdc2 substrate sequences, 327SPSC,333SPKN, and 341SPGS wereunderlined. c, effect of disruption ofpsp1 on cell viability. Diploid SP286 strain containingpsp1 gene disrupted with ura4 + as evidenced by the Southern analysis of its chromosomal DNA (lane 2 in 1) produced two viable and two nonviable spores at 30 °C on tetrad analysis (2). These sequence data are available from GenBankTM under accession number L36906 and were deposited in August, 1994.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine the transcription start site of psp1 +, the primer extension method was used (62McKnight S.L. Kingsbury R. Science. 1982; 217: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). The antisense primer sequence that corresponds to the sequence from +150 to +169 (5′-GAGCAATTTCATTATCATG-3′) of the amino-terminal coding region was synthesized and labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and [γ-32P]ATP. The labeled primer was then hybridized with 5–10 μg of poly(A) RNAs isolated from the ED665 strain grown in EMM. Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (New England Biolabs) was added to the hybridization mixture and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The position of transcription start site was determined by comparing the size of the extended fragment with the sequenced DNA using the same primer. To determine the location of the Psp1 protein in S. pombecells, membrane and cytosolic fractions of the cells were prepared (63Disatnik M.H. Hernandez-Sotomayor S.M. Jones G. Carpenter G. Mochly-Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 559-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Cells were broken by the glass bead method (64Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1995; (, 17.1–17.14, Wiley, New York): 13.51Google Scholar) in bead buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 0.25 m sucrose, 20 μg of leupeptin/ml, and 10 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was used as a cytosolic fraction. The pellet fraction was treated with 1% Triton X-100 for 30 min at 4 °C and used as a membrane fraction. To prepare the protein product of the psp1 gene, a coding region DNA ofpsp1 + was fused to the isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible glutathione S-transferase (GST) of fusion vector pGEX-3X. The GST-psp1 fusion constructs that encode different portions of Psp1 were prepared as follows (Fig. 4 c,A). The DNA fragment containing the whole coding region (w), amino-terminal sequence 1–307 (Nw), or carboxyl-terminal sequence 323–408 (Cw) was cloned into the BamHI site of plasmid pGEX-3X. The DNA fragments encoding carboxyl-terminal sequences 323–408 (Cm1), 330–408 (Cm2), and 338–408 (Cm3), bearing substitutions of serine residues at 327, 333, and 341 with alanine, respectively, were fused into the same vector. Escherichia coli strain DH5α transformed with these fusion plasmids was grown in LB medium containing ampicillin, and production of GST-Psp1 fusion proteins was induced by growing cells in the presence of 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 30 °C. Each GST-Psp1 fusion protein was purified on glutathione-agarose beads as described previously from E. coli crude cell extracts (65Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene. 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5046) Google Scholar). For in vitrophosphorylation of Psp1 protein by Cdc2 kinase, GST and GST-Psp1 fusion proteins purified on glutathione-agarose beads were eluted with 10 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. To generate polyclonal antibody against Psp1 protein, affinity-purified GST-Psp1(w) protein was treated with factor Xa enzyme and separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel (65Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene. 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5046) Google Scholar). The Psp1 protein band on the gel was eluted, mixed with Freund's adjuvant solution, and used to inject a rabbit. After two more successive injections at 2-week intervals, serum was collected and used as a source of antibody for Western blot analysis and immunocytological experiments (74Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 53-137Google Scholar). For determining cellular localization of Psp1 protein, FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma, Catalog No. F7512) was used. Cells grown at log or stationary phase were collected, washed, and fixed with methanol (56Toda T. Yamamoto M. Yanagida M. J. Cell Sci. 1981; 52: 271-287PubMed Google Scholar, 66Alfa C.E. Hyams J.S.

Antiserum prepared against Psp1 was mixed first with the fixed cell suspension and then treated with FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG in a concentration of 1/50 dilution. Nuclei of the cells were counterstained with 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (56Toda T. Yamamoto M. Yanagida M. J. Cell Sci. 1981; 52: 271-287PubMed Google Scholar). Transcriptional expression of psp1 + during cell cycle progression was examined by Northern analysis of total RNA from cells grown synchronously by the arrest-release method with hydroxyurea. Total RNA was prepared from the cells collected every 20 min by the method of Carlson and Botstein (68Carlson M. Botstein D. Cell. 1982; 28: 145-154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar) and analyzed by hybridizing them with the 1.5-kb PvuII-EcoRV DNA fragment radioactively labeled by the random priming metho"

From the cDNA clone, it is evident that the enzyme has a Ser/Thr-rich fragment near the COOH-terminal Asp. The enzyme was determined to be a glycoprotein; however,O-deglucosylation only slightly affects activity. Computer searches showed that the B2-aldehyde-forming enzyme has little homology with other proteins, but domain motifs may reflect N-myristoylation of a dehydrogenase with a signature similar to 4Fe-4S ferredoxins.

The metabolism of riboflavin is better understood in terms of enzymes responsible for the biosynthetic conversion of this vitamin to its functional coenzymes than as concerns enzymes catalyzing catabolic degradation of the vitamin (1McCormick D.B. Shils M.E. Shike M. Olson J.A. Modern Nutrition in Health and Disease. 8th Ed. Lea & Febiger, Malvern, PA1994: 366-375Google Scholar). Complete purification of flavokinase (2Merrill Jr., A.H.

McCormick D.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 278: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar); however, not one of the enzymes responsible for degradation of riboflavin had been sequenced or obtained in sufficient quantity to allow suitable molecular characterization. The considerable extent to which riboflavin is apparently catabolized in the human was reflected by early balance experiments in adult men (5Horwitt M.K. Harvey C.C. Hills O.W. Liebert E. J. Nutr. 1950; 41: 247-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Although diverse flavin catabolites have been described in nature (6Chastain J.L. McCormick D.B. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavins. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 195-200Google Scholar), little has been done to elucidate the enzyme systems responsible for their formation. Certain bacteria have been found able to degrade the flavin isoalloxazine ring (7Miles H.T. Smyrniotis P.Z. Stadtman E.R. J. Am. Chem.

The enzyme system responsible for forming so-called “schizoflavins”, which are the aldehyde and carboxylic acid derived from oxidation of the terminal 5′-hydroxymethyl of the riboflavin side chain (18Tachibana S. Murakami T. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 66: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), was purified from the fungus Schizophyllum commune by Tachibana and Oka (19Tachibana S. Oka M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 6682-6685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Tachibana S. Oka M. J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol. 1982; 28: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Our laboratory first ascertained the rather narrow flavin specificity of the S. commune riboflavin 5′-hydroxymethyl oxidase (21Kekelidze T.N. Edmondson D.E. McCormick D.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 315: 100-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). However, the trace of protein obtained in previous studies was insufficient to allow characterization other than indirect indications that a conventional alcohol pyridine-nucleotide dehydrogenase or even an azide-sensitive cytochrome P450-dependent system did not seem to be involved (20Tachibana S. Oka M. J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol. 1982; 28: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). As will be described in this paper, we have now succeeded in modifying the original purification to obtain enzyme from which peptide fragments were derived to ultimately obtain a complete cDNA for reflecting the primary sequence of the enzyme, further to express its activity inPichia pastoris, and additionally to determine that deglycosylation has little effect on the overall activity. S. commune (ATCC 38719) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained on YM (Difco) agar plates. Seed cultures were prepared by cultivation in a YM medium with shaking on a reciprocal shaker for 3 days at 30 °C. Large scale cultures (4 liters) were prepared by inoculation with 0.2 liter of seed culture with shaking as before. Mycelia were separated from culture media by filtration onto cheesecloth. The resulting culture medium was used for enzyme purification. B2-aldehyde-forming enzyme activity was assayed by the method described by Tachibana and Oka (19Tachibana S. Oka M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 6682-6685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rate of dichlorophenol indophenol reduction was monitored by the decrease in absorbance at 600 nm using a Milton Roy spectrophotometer at 25 °C. One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that riboflavin reduces 1 μmol of dichlorophenol indophenol/min at 25 °C as calculated from its molar extinction coefficient (7.6 × 103 at pH 5.5). Protein was determined by the method of Bradford (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216412) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Four liters of culture media of S. commune was brought to 50% saturation by addition with stirring of solid ammonium sulfate at 4 °C. The resultant precipitate was removed by centrifugation for 30 min at 25,000 × g. The supernatant fluid at 4 °C was then brought to 90% saturation by further addition with stirring of solid ammonium sulfate. After standing overnight the resultant precipitate was collected by centrifugation for 30 min at 25,000 × g. The precipitate was resuspended and dialyzed overnight against 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0. The enzyme solution was then applied to a DEAE-Sepharose column (4 × 40 cm) equilibrated with the pH 5 acetate buffer. After removal of the unbound material, the column was eluted with 1 liter of 0–1 mlinear NaCl gradient. Fractions of 10 ml were collected and assayed for activity. The fractions containing the enzyme activity were pooled and dialyzed against the pH 5 acetate buffer. For the purpose of partial amino acid sequencing, the enzyme solution was concentrated by ultrafiltration to a total volume of 1 ml, applied to a nondenaturing gel, and electrophoresed at 4 °C. The location of the enzyme activity on the gel was determined as described by Tachibana and Oka (19Tachibana S. Oka M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 6682-6685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein band containing the enzyme activity was excised and homogenized with minimal volume of the pH 5 acetate buffer. Affinity chromatography with flavin immobilized gel has also been used for the final purification step. Flavin immobilized gel was synthesized by the method described by Kasai et al. (23Kasai S. Nakano H. Maeda K. Matsui K. Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1989; 62: 611-613Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The partially purified enzyme from the DEAE-Sepharose column was subjected to an affinity column (1 × 10 cm) equilibrated with the pH 5 acetate buffer. The column was washed with the buffer until the washes were nearly free of 280-nm-absorbing material. The desired protein was then eluted with the buffer containing 0.1 mm riboflavin. The fractions containing the enzyme activity were pooled and stored at −20 °C. The suspension of purified enzyme from the nondenatured gel was resolved on SDS-PAGE 1The abbreviations used are: PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; bp, base pair(s); RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; bp, base pair(s). and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using a mini-trans-blot cell (Bio-Rad). The enzyme band was then excised. Direct sequencing of the enzyme indicated that it had a blocked amino terminus. Therefore, the purified enzyme on polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was digested with lysyl endopeptidase. The resulting peptides were purified using a C-18 silica reversed-phase column (1 × 250 mm). The isolated peptides were selected for sequencing. S. commune was grown for 3 days as described above. Mycelia were harvested by filtration onto cheesecloth. Harvested mycelia were blotted on paper toweling, frozen at −20 °C, and lyophilized. Lyophilized mycelia were then frozen in liquid nitrogen, ground in a mortar, and broken with a Bead-Beater (Biospec Products). RNA was extracted and isolated with a total RNA isolation kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). Poly(A)+ RNA was purified on oligo(dT)-cellulose columns and used as template for the construction of a cDNA library in phage λZAPII by using a commercial kit (Stratagene). Two degenerate oligonucleotides derived from one peptide were synthesized: 5′-CARGCNCARATHGTNGAYGA (384-fold degeneracy) and 5′-AARTAYTCRAANARNCCYTG (512-fold degeneracy). These degenerate primers were used in the polymerase chain reaction to synthesize a nondegenerate probe with purified poly(A)+ RNA as template. This sequence was then labeled with biotin-14-dCTP using a polymerase chain reaction nonradioactive labeling system (Life Technologies, Inc.). Phages (105) were screened, and one pure positive clone was achieved with two rounds of screening. Plaques were lifted on MagnaGraph nylon transfer membranes (Micron Separations Inc.) and were treated as described by the manufacturer. A PhotoGene nucleic acid detection system (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used to detect the biotinylated probes hybridized to nucleic acids immobilized on the membranes. Hybridization was done overnight at 42 °C in 6 × SSC (0.3 m sodium citrate buffer, pH 7, containing 3.0m NaCl), 0.5% SDS, 50% formamide, 5 × Denhardt's reagent, and 100 mg/ml of sheared, denatured, herring sperm DNA. The final wash was performed in 0.1 × SSC with 1% SDS at 55 °C for 30 min. Techniques for prehybridization and hybridization were as described by the manufacturer. A 5′-RACE kit was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Total RNA for the 5′-RACE experiments was isolated from 1 g of lyophilized mycelia as described above. Primers for the 5′-RACE experiments were GSP1 (AAAGTCAGAAGCCTGGTTCA) and GSP2 (AGGGGAGAGGATAGAAAG); both were designed with the cDNA sequence as shown in Fig. 3. The 5′-RACE products were separated by agarose (1%) gel electrophoresis. Each product was then purified from the agarose gel using a Geneclean II kit from BIO 101, Inc. (Vista, CA) and subcloned using a TA cloning kit (Invitrogen), and subclones containing the 5′-RACE products were sequenced. A Sequenase kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) was used for plasmid sequencing. Sequence analysis was performed using the sequence analysis software package (GCG) of the University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group (24Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11536) Google Scholar) and other tools via the World Wide Web. A Pichia expression kit (Invitrogen) was used for functional expression of the enzyme in P. pastoris. The pPIC9K vector (Invitrogen) was selected to construct the expression plasmid. P. pastoris strain KM71 was maintained and transformed as described in the manual version F of thePichia expression kit. His+ transformants in KM71 were purified on regeneration dextrose plates (Invitrogen) without histidine. Gene integration was detected using a rapid DNA dot blot technique (25Romanos M.A. Clare J.J. Beesley K.M. Rayment F.B. Ballantine S.P. Makoff A.J. Dougan G. Fairweather N.F. Charles I.G. Vaccine. 1991; 9: 901-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To express the enzyme, a single colony of multiple integration transformants was inoculated into 25 ml of pH 6-buffered complex glycerol media (Invitrogen). After growing at 30 °C with shaking (250 rpm) for 18 h, cells were harvested by centrifuging and transferred to 250 ml of pH 6-buffered complex methanol media (Invitrogen) with 1% casamino acids. The culture was then returned to the incubator to continue growth for 72 h. An enzymatic deglycosylation kit (Bio-Rad) was used to enzymatically cleave all possible N- and O-linked oligosaccharides from the B2-aldehyde-forming enzyme. Partially purified enzyme from the affinity purification step was used in deglycosylation reactions using a denaturing protocol described by the manufacturer. The effect of deglycosylation with onlyO-glycosidase on the B2-aldehyde-forming enzyme activity was examined using a nondenaturing protocol as described by the manufacturer. In the previous method for the purification of B2-aldehyde-forming enzyme fromS. commune, only a trace of purified enzyme was obtained from very large amounts of mycelia because of very low specific activity in the cell-free extract (19Tachibana S. Oka M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 6682-6685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have found that the culture medium of S. commune also contains the enzyme with a specific activity about 15-fold higher than that of cell-free extract. So it is possible to obtain pure enzyme from the culture media in greater yield and in much shorter time. To facilitate the purification, we have chosen the S. commune (ATCC 38719) strain. which secreted very small amounts of polysaccharide to the media (26Prokop A. Rapp P. Wagner F. Exp. Mycol. 1992; 16: 197-206Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). TableI summarizes the partial purification of B2-aldehyde-forming enzyme from the S. communeculture media. After the DEAE-Sepharose chromatography step, the enzyme was purified about 90-fold based on the activity of the culture supernatant. Analysis of the partially purified enzyme by SDS-PAGE showed that there are five major bands on the gel (Fig.1). In the previous method (19Tachibana S. Oka M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 6682-6685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Sephadex G-100 chromatography was used for the final purification. However, a substantial loss in yield in this step has been found. For the purpose of partial amino acid sequencing, we have separated the partially purified enzyme on a nondenaturing gel. The final product of this purification showed a single protein with an apparent molecular mass of 78 kDa on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). But this also resulted in a significant activity loss. A potential procedure for the final purification step is to use flavinyl-agaroses as biospecific affinity materials as described by Merrill and McCormick (27Merrill A. McCormick D. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 89: 87-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This technique has been successfully used for the purification of proteins that bind riboflavin, such as flavokinase from rat liver (27Merrill A. McCormick D. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 89: 87-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 28Merrill Jr., A.H. McCormick D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1335-1338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or from small intestine (23Kasai S. Nakano H. Maeda K. Matsui K. Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1989; 62: 611-613Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The elution pattern for affinity chromatography of the B2-aldehyde-forming enzyme is shown in Fig.2. The addition of 0.1 mmriboflavin released the enzyme in 20% yield. The rest of the enzyme activity was eluted with 0.1% Tween 20, suggesting additional binding to the matrix.Table IPartial purification of B 2 -aldehyde-forming enzyme from S. commune culture mediaPurification stepVolumeTotal proteinTotal activitySpecific activityYieldmlmgunitsunits/mg%Culture supernatant4,000852.03.250.0038100(NH4)2SO4fractionation20053.92.810.05286.5DEAE-Sepharose chromatography145.61.900.3458.5 Open table in a new tab Figure 2The elution pattern for affinity chromatography of the B 2 -aldehyde-forming enzyme.

Attempts to directly sequence the polypeptide demonstrated that it had a blocked amino terminus. Therefore, the purified enzyme was cleaved with lysyl endopeptidase. Peptide fragments were separated by high performance liquid chromatography, and selected peptides were sequenced. Two resultant amino acid sequences (underlined) are shown in Fig. 3. A 78-bp probe was amplified from S. commune cDNA with two degenerate primers as described under “Experimental Procedures” and was used for screening the S. commune cDNA library. One phage that showed the strongest hybridization to the probe was converted into pBluescript SK(−) (Stratagene) by in vivo excision. This recombinant plasmid, designated pBRAF, was then sequenced (Fig. 3). The whole sequence contained 1080 bp with a 19-mer poly(A) tail at its 3′ end. To obtain the complete coding region for the enzyme, we employed the 5′-RACE procedure. No more nucleotide sequence at the 5′ end of the B2-aldehyde-forming enzyme cDNA was found from the two major 5′-RACE products. An open reading frame in the cDNA was identified with ATG as putative start codon 304 bp from the beginning of the insert. This open reading frame encodes a polypeptide of 200 residues with two internal peptides matching the amino acid sequences of the peptides previously determined (underlined). The calculated molecular weight and pI value of the encoded polypeptide are 20,384 and 3.6, respectively. Computer searches with known sequences showed that this sequence has little similarity to other proteins. However, searches on the PRINTS data base (29Attwood T.K. Beck M.E. Bleasby A.J. Degtyarenko K. Michie A.D. Parry-Smith D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) via World Wide Web exhibited three motif fragments in the predicted amino acid sequence. The fragment from position 41 to 52 matches to a 4FE4SFRDOXIN motif, which is a two-element fingerprint that provides a signature for 4Fe-4S ferredoxins; fragment 61–71 matches to a BCTRLSENSOR motif, which is a four-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the bacterial sensor proteins; fragment (186–197) is similar to a GLFDHDRGNASE motif, which is a four-element fingerprint that provides a signature for glutamate, leucine, and phenylalanine dehydrogenases. These latter are NAD- and/or NADP-dependent enzymes (30Mavrothalassitis G. Tzimagiorgis G. Mitsialis A. Zannis V. Plaitakits A. Papamatheakis J. Moschonas N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Gene ( Amst. ). 1988; 63: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, Tachibana and Oka (20Tachibana S. Oka M. J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol. 1982; 28: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that neither NAD nor NADP function as coenzyme for B2-aldehyde-forming enzyme, although binding of NADPH stimulates aldehyde-forming activity under aerobic conditions. ScanProsite searches showed that there were three potential N-myristoylation sites near the NH2 terminus (fragments 1–5, 20–25, and 24–29). These results suggest that the NH2-terminal block is due to theN-myristoylation. In the predicted amino acid sequence, there is a Ser/Thr-rich fragment (98–176) near the COOH-terminal Asp residue. BLAST searches with this fragment as a query sequence revealed that many glycoproteins have similar Ser/Thr-rich sequences near their COOH termini. One of these glycoproteins, acid phosphatase from Leishmania mexicana, has been found to have its Ser/Thr-rich domains serve as targets forO-linked modification of phosphoserines by mannooligosaccharides and phosphoglycans (33Wiese M. IIg T. Lottspeich F. Overath P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1067-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). It has been found that the calculated molecular mass of the encoded polypeptide (20.4 kDa) is much less than that (78 kDa) revealed by SDS-PAGE (cf. Fig.1). Because no more nucleotide sequence at the 5′ end of the B2-aldehyde-forming enzyme cDNA was found using the 5′-RACE procedure, it appeared that B2-aldehyde-forming enzyme is also a glycoprotein with saccharides O-linked to its Ser/Thr-rich domain. No consensus Asn-X-Thr/Ser sequence for covalent attachment of N-linked glycans was found in the predicted amino acid sequence. Deglycosylation substantiated that B2-aldehyde-forming enzyme is a glycoprotein with an expected polypeptide size of approximately 20 kDa (Fig.4). The removal of O-linked oligosaccharides from B2-aldehyde-forming enzyme has only a slight effect on the enzyme activity (data not shown). This implies that O-linked oligosaccharides are not essential for the catalysis. The methylotrophic yeast P. pastoris has been developed as an efficient system for high-level production of foreign proteins (34Buckholz R.G. Gleeson M.A.G. Bio/Technology. 1991; 9: 1067-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 35Cregg J.M. Vedvick T.S. Raschke W.C. Bio/Technology. 1993; 11: 905-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). We therefore chose the P. pastorisexpression system (Invitrogen) to express the B2-aldehyde-forming enzyme activity. Because the enzyme is glycosylated and then secreted by the fungus, we have selected a vector pPIC9K (Invitrogen) that has an α-factor signal sequence to secrete the protein. A plasmid, derived from pPIC9K and designated pPICRAF9K, for the expression of the B2-aldehyde-forming enzyme was constructed. In plasmid pPICRAF9K, polymerase chain reaction was used to generate an EcoRI site before the first ATG and aNotI site after the poly(A) end in the B2-aldehyde-forming enzyme cDNA. After digestion withEcoRI/NotI, the polymerase chain reaction product was subcloned into the pPIC9K vector, which had also been digested withEcoRI/NotI. DNA sequencing showed that the inserted fragment (304–1080 in Fig. 3) is in frame with the secretion signal open reading frame. pPICRAF9K was linearized withBpu1102I, and was then transformed to P. pastorisstrain KM71 as described by the manufacturer. Ninety-one His+ transformants were tested for gene integration into the Pichia genome using a rapid DNA dot-blot technique (25Romanos M.A. Clare J.J. Beesley K.M. Rayment F.B. Ballantine S.P. Makoff A.J. Dougan G. Fairweather N.F. Charles I.G. Vaccine. 1991; 9: 901-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). There were seven transformants that exhibited strong hybridization signals. These transformants were chosen to produce B2-aldehyde-forming enzyme in the induced cultures. For the examination of the enzyme activity, culture media were concentrated to 10-fold using a centrifugal filter device (Millipore). The enzyme activity could be detected in all the seven concentrated cultures. Fig. 5 showed the time courses of the enzyme activity (A) and protein concentration (B) for a pPICRAF9K transformant and a control transformant with pPIC9K. These results confirmed that the cloned 1080 bp cDNA represents the gene for the B2-aldehyde-forming enzyme fromS. commune. Unfortunately, the enzyme was secreted in a very low expression level, as shown in Fig. 5. Analysis by SDS-PAGE showed that the cell pellets of the pPICRAF9K transformant contained recombinant protein (data not shown). This implies that the recombinant protein may not be processed correctly and, hence, fails to be secreted. Overall, the present work has led to the first-time cloning, sequencing, and expression of the cDNA encoding the enzyme that uniquely oxidizes the 5′-hydroxymethyl terminus of riboflavin. That the enzyme is O-glycosylated in a manner that does not significantly affect its activity may relate to its biologic function, which could conceivably be to remove a nutrient that is essential for other organisms. Hence, as with penicillin or streptomycin production by fungi that can decrease competition for nutrients in their environment, this may be an example of the production of an enzyme for such a purpose."
https://openalex.org/W2018937390,"A mutant hen egg white lysozyme, D52E, was designed to correspond to the structure of the mutant T4 lysozyme T26E (Kuroki, R., Weaver, L. H., and Matthews B. W. (1993)Science 262, 2030–2033) to investigate the role of the catalytic residue on the α-side of the saccharide in these enzymes. The D52E mutant forms a covalent enzyme-substrate adduct, which was detected by electron ion spray mass spectrometry. X-ray crystallographic analysis showed that the covalent adduct was formed between Glu-52 and the C-1 carbon of theN-acetylglucosamine residue in subsite D of the saccharide binding site. It suggests that the catalytic mechanism of D52E mutant lysozyme proceeds through a covalent enzyme-substrate intermediate indicating a different catalytic mechanism from the wild type hen egg white lysozyme. It was confirmed that the substitution of Asp-52 with Glu is structurally and functionally equivalent to the substitution of Thr-26 with Glu in T4 lysozyme. Although the position of the catalytic residue on the β-side of the saccharide is quite conserved among hen egg white lysozyme, goose egg white lysozyme, and T4 phage lysozyme, the adaptability of the side chain on the α-side of the saccharide is considered to be responsible for the functional variation in their glycosidase and transglycosidase activities. A mutant hen egg white lysozyme, D52E, was designed to correspond to the structure of the mutant T4 lysozyme T26E (Kuroki, R., Weaver, L. H., and Matthews B. W. (1993)Science 262, 2030–2033) to investigate the role of the catalytic residue on the α-side of the saccharide in these enzymes.

It is known that the catalytic sites of most glycosidases have common features. For example, β-glycosidases have a glutamate on the β-side of the saccharide which acts as an acid to donate a proton to glycosidic oxygen (O-4) to initiate the catalytic reaction (1Sinnott M.L. Page M.I. Williams A. Enzyme Mechanisms. Royal Society of Chemistry, London1987: 259-291Google Scholar, 2Sinnott M.L. Chem. Rev. 1990; 90: 1171-1202Crossref Scopus (1485) Google Scholar, 3Svensson B.

Lysozyme is one of the β-glycosidases which cleaves the glycosidic linkage between N-acetylglucosamine andN-acetylmuramic acid in the bacterial cell wall. There are three lysozymes in which the tertiary structures have been solved by x-ray crystallography (5Davies G. Henrissat B.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 4178-4182Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The catalytic mechanisms of these lysozymes have been discussed from the structural point of view. Hen egg white lysozyme is one of the enzymes in which the catalytic mechanism has been extensively investigated (9Phillips D.C. Sci.

The catalytic mechanism of HEWL 1The abbreviations use are: HEWL, hen egg white lysozyme; GEWL, goose egg white lysozyme; T4L, T4 phage lysozyme; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; (NAG) n, n mer of N-acetylglucosamine; RMSD, root-mean-square deviation. 1The abbreviations use are: HEWL, hen egg white lysozyme; GEWL, goose egg white lysozyme; T4L, T4 phage lysozyme; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; (NAG) n, n mer of N-acetylglucosamine; RMSD, root-mean-square deviation. is considered to proceed through an oxocarbonium ion intermediate as originally proposed by D. C. Phillips (9Phillips D.C. Sci. Am. 1966; 215: 78-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Even though the configurations of the catalytic residues are somewhat similar in both HEWL and T4L (8Matthews B.W. Remington S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 4178-4182Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), the catalytic mechanism of T4L was found to proceed via a single displacement mechanism (11Kuroki R. Weaver L.H. Matthews B.W. Science. 1993; 262: 2030-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 12Kuroki R. Weaver L.H. Matthews B.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1007-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), indicating a different mechanism from that of HEWL.Moreover, it is known that the kind of catalytic residue located on the α-side of the saccharide seems more adaptable because the acidic residue corresponding to Asp-52 of HEWL was not found on the α-side of the saccharide in GEWL (13Weaver L.H. Grütter M.G. Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 54-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), mutant HEWL (14Malcom B.A. Rosenberg S. Corey M.J. Allen J.S. de Baetselier A. Kirsch J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), or mutant T4L (15Anand N.N. Stephen E.R. Narang S.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 153: 862-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 16Rennell D. Bouvier S.E. Hardy L.W. Poteete A.R. J. Mol.

Recently, we have found that the mutant T4L, Thr-26 → Glu, located on the α-side of the saccharide, resulted in the enzyme reacting directly with a saccharide to an enzyme-substrate adduct (11Kuroki R. Weaver L.H. Matthews B.W. Science. 1993; 262: 2030-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). To clarify the structural and functional features of this residue located on the α-side of the saccharide, we chose to modify HEWL and focused on the residue Asp-52. We mutated Asp-52 to Glu, because in HEWL Asp-52 is located on the α-side of the bound saccharide in a position similar to that of Thr-26 in T4L. It is shown here that this mutation (i.e. Asp-52 → Glu) in HEWL does, in fact, also lead to the production of a covalent enzyme-substrate adduct. This further demonstrates the overall relationship between the active sites and the mechanism of action of T4L and HEWL.DISCUSSIONThree catalytic mechanisms have been proposed for the mechanisms of glycosidases (1Sinnott M.L. Page M.I. Williams A. Enzyme Mechanisms. Royal Society of Chemistry, London1987: 259-291Google Scholar, 2Sinnott M.L. Chem. Rev. 1990; 90: 1171-1202Crossref Scopus (1485) Google Scholar, 3Svensson B. Søgaard M. J. Biotechnol. 1993; 29: 1-37Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). They are an inverting mechanism (Fig.4 a) and two retaining mechanisms which proceed through either an oxocarbonium ion intermediate (Fig.4 b) or a covalent enzyme-substrate intermediate (Fig.4 c). HEWL is one of the retaining glycosidases (26Dahlquist F.W. Borders C.L. Jacobson G. Raftery M.A. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 694-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The catalytic mechanism has been considered to involve an oxocarbonium ion intermediate (Fig. 4 b) that is stabilized by a negative charge of the carboxylic acid at Asp-52 (9Phillips D.C. Sci. Am. 1966; 215: 78-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 10Imoto T. Johnson L.N. North A.C.T. Phillips D.C. Rupley J.A. Boyer P. The Enzymes. 3rd Ed. Academic Press, New York1972: 665-868Google Scholar). The catalytic mechanism of T4 lysozyme was recently determined to have an inverting mechanism creating the α-anomer after hydrolyzing the β-glycosidic linkage (12Kuroki R. Weaver L.H. Matthews B.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1007-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Although T4 phage and hen egg white lysozymes have distinct catalytic mechanisms (12Kuroki R. Weaver L.H. Matthews B.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1007-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), a similar glycosyl-enzyme intermediate was observed in mutants. The location of the covalent linkage was confirmed to be between OE1 of Glu-52 and C-1 of NAG by x-ray crystallography as shown above, similar to the linkage seen in the T26E mutant of T4L. This indicates that the glutamic acid replacing Asp-52 of HEWL or Thr-26 of T4L acts as a nucleophile to attack C-1 from the α-side of the saccharide in subsite D. The mutant D52E has already been made by at least two groups (18Inoue M. Yamada H. Yasukochi T. Kuroki R. Miki T. Horiuchi T. Imoto T.

Acta. 1991; 1079: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and was reported to retain less than 3% activity. The existence of the covalent enzyme-substrate adduct suggests that the catalytic action in D52E mutant HEWL proceeds through a covalent enzyme-substrate intermediate as shown in Fig. 4 c. This also implies that the D52E mutant HEWL has a different catalytic mechanism from that proposed for the wild type HEWL. The structural comparison between the wild type and D52E mutant showed that the position of the carboxylate oxygen atom closest to the substrate binding site has shifted about 1.8 Å toward the inside of the cleft in the mutant. This positional shift of the oxygen atom may be responsible for the creation of the covalent adduct. Moreover, a minor species corresponding to the covalent enzyme-substrate adduct was observed in D52S mutant by electron ion spray mass spectrometry (28Lumb K.J. Aplin R.T. Radford S.E. Archer D.B. Jeenes D.J. Lambert N. Mackenzie D.A. Dobson C.M. Lowe G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 153-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). If this minor species was created during the catalytic process, it would require a double displacement mechanism the same as that of the D52E mutant HEWL. The tertiary structure of the D52S mutant (24Hadfield A.T. Harvey D.J. Archer D.B. MacKenzie D.A. Jeenes D.J. Radford S.E. Lowe G. Dobson C.M. Johnson L.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 856-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), however, does not seem to support this mechanism, because the position of the OG atom of Ser-52 is 2.6 Å further away from the substrate compared with the OE1 atom of Glu-52. This would place the OG atom of Ser-52 too far away to react with the saccharide molecule directly. To solve this discrepancy, further analysis of the catalytic mechanism of these mutant HEWL is needed.It is already known that there are features common to T4L, GEWL, and HEWL. The first is the location of glutamic acid (Glu-11, Glu-35, and Glu-73). It is well known that the acidic residue located on the β-side of the saccharide is usually glutamic acid (i.e.Glu-11 in T4L, Glu-35 in HEWL, and Glu-73 in GEWL), which has been shown to be essential for the activity by chemical modifications and mutation analysis (12Kuroki R.

Chem. 1986; 261: 13571-13574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The glutamate is considered to act as a general acid to donate a proton to the glycosidic oxygen (O-4). Another common feature is the location of main chain peptides that interact with the N-acetyl group of the saccharide bound at subsite C. The interactions in the saccharide binding sites corresponding to subsite C in HEWL are strongly conserved between GEWL, HEWL, and T4L as mentioned previously (8Matthews B.W. Remington S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 4178-4182Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In contrast, it was previously reported that the acidic residue located on the α-side of the saccharide is not always essential for the activity as seen in hen egg white lysozyme mutants (14Malcom B.A. Rosenberg S.

Biol. 1995; 245: 54-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The catalytic function of the Asp-52 in HEWL is considered to be stabilization of the oxocarbonium ion (mechanism in Fig.4 b), while Asp-20 in T4L is thought to act as a base to help activate the water molecule to attack the saccharide from the α-side of the saccharide (mechanism in Fig. 4 a). It is now clear that the roles of the aspartic acids located on the α-side of the saccharide (Asp-20 in T4L, Asp-52 in HEWL) are different. The D52E mutant shows yet a third role in the catalytic function (mechanism in Fig. 4 c), which has already been seen in other glycosidases (4McCarter J.D. Withers S.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar, 32White A. Tull D. Johns K. Withers S., G. Rose D., R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The formation of the same covalent enzyme-substrate intermediate indicates that the locations of glutamic acid introduced into Asp-52 in HEWL and Thr-26 in T4L are functionally equivalent as shown in Table I.A careful structure comparison of the catalytic sites from three lysozymes shows that Asp-52 is located at the position equivalent to Thr-26 in T4L and Gly-90 in GEWL. The similar Cαlocations of Asp-52 in HEWL to Thr-26 in T4L and Gly-90 in GEWL suggest that the mutation of Asp-52 to a residue which has a short side chain such as Thr, Ser, Ala, or Gly will possibly result in changing the catalytic mechanism toward an inverting enzyme as observed for the wild type T4L. Indeed, a similar mutation has been made in β-glucosidase, and the formation of the α-anomer has been reported (33Wang Q. Graham R.W. Trimbur D. Warren R.A.J. Withers S.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 11594-11595Crossref Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Moreover, the D52S mutant of HEWL has been prepared, and the tertiary structure of the D52S mutant of HEWL with substrate was determined (24Hadfield A.T. Harvey D.J. Archer D.B. MacKenzie D.A. Jeenes D.J. Radford S.E. Lowe G. Dobson C.M. Johnson L.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 856-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The α-anomer seen in the crystal complex with the D52S mutant of HEWL is considered to be a product of hydrolysis. The α-anomer was interpreted as the result of mutarotation of product following a normal wild type HEWL retaining reaction. It would, however, be consistent with the D52S mutant of HEWL acting as an inverting enzyme as has been observed for wild type T4L. These findings support the hypothesis that the residue located on the α-side of the saccharide, such as Asp-52 in HEWL, Thr-26 in T4L, or probably Gly-90 in GEWL, is responsible for the differentiation of the catalytic mechanism. Moreover, the fact that T4L and GEWL, which have a short side chain on the α-side of the saccharide, do not catalyze transglycosylation, while HEWL, which has aspartate or glutamate (mutant) on the α-side of the saccharide and catalyzes transglycosylation, may indicate that this variability is also responsible for the functional difference between glycosidases and transglycosidases. It is known that the catalytic sites of most glycosidases have common features. For example, β-glycosidases have a glutamate on the β-side of the saccharide which acts as an acid to donate a proton to glycosidic oxygen (O-4) to initiate the catalytic reaction (1Sinnott M.L. Page M.I. Williams A. Enzyme Mechanisms. Royal Society of Chemistry, London1987: 259-291Google Scholar, 2Sinnott M.L. Chem. Rev. 1990; 90: 1171-1202Crossref Scopus (1485) Google Scholar, 3Svensson B.

Lysozyme is one of the β-glycosidases which cleaves the glycosidic linkage between N-acetylglucosamine andN-acetylmuramic acid in the bacterial cell wall. There are three lysozymes in which the tertiary structures have been solved by x-ray crystallography (5Davies G. Henrissat B.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 4178-4182Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The catalytic mechanisms of these lysozymes have been discussed from the structural point of view. Hen egg white lysozyme is one of the enzymes in which the catalytic mechanism has been extensively investigated (9Phillips D.C. Sci. Am. 1966; 215: 78-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 10Imoto T. Johnson L.N. North A.C.T. Phillips D.C. Rupley J.A. Boyer P. The Enzymes. 3rd Ed.

The catalytic mechanism of HEWL 1The abbreviations use are: HEWL, hen egg white lysozyme; GEWL, goose egg white lysozyme; T4L, T4 phage lysozyme; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; (NAG) n, n mer of N-acetylglucosamine; RMSD, root-mean-square deviation. 1The abbreviations use are: HEWL, hen egg white lysozyme; GEWL, goose egg white lysozyme; T4L, T4 phage lysozyme; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; (NAG) n, n mer of N-acetylglucosamine; RMSD, root-mean-square deviation. is considered to proceed through an oxocarbonium ion intermediate as originally proposed by D. C. Phillips (9Phillips D.C. Sci. Am. 1966; 215: 78-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Even though the configurations of the catalytic residues are somewhat similar in both HEWL and T4L (8Matthews B.W. Remington S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 4178-4182Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), the catalytic mechanism of T4L was found to proceed via a single displacement mechanism (11Kuroki R. Weaver L.H. Matthews B.W. Science. 1993; 262: 2030-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 12Kuroki R. Weaver L.H. Matthews B.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1007-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), indicating a different mechanism from that of HEWL. Moreover, it is known that the kind of catalytic residue located on the α-side of the saccharide seems more adaptable because the acidic residue corresponding to Asp-52 of HEWL was not found on the α-side of the saccharide in GEWL (13Weaver L.H. Grütter M.G. Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 54-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), mutant HEWL (14Malcom B.A. Rosenberg S. Corey M.J. Allen J.S. de Baetselier A. Kirsch J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), or mutant T4L (15Anand N.N. Stephen E.R. Narang S.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 153: 862-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 16Rennell D. Bouvier S.E. Hardy L.W. Poteete A.R. J. Mol.

Recently, we have found that the mutant T4L, Thr-26 → Glu, located on the α-side of the saccharide, resulted in the enzyme reacting directly with a saccharide to an enzyme-substrate adduct (11Kuroki R. Weaver L.H. Matthews B.W. Science. 1993; 262: 2030-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). To clarify the structural and functional features of this residue located on the α-side of the saccharide, we chose to modify HEWL and focused on the residue Asp-52. We mutated Asp-52 to Glu, because in HEWL Asp-52 is located on the α-side of the bound saccharide in a position similar to that of Thr-26 in T4L. It is shown here that this mutation (i.e. Asp-52 → Glu) in HEWL does, in fact, also lead to the production of a covalent enzyme-substrate adduct. This further demonstrates the overall relationship between the active sites and the mechanism of action of T4L and HEWL. DISCUSSIONThree catalytic mechanisms have been proposed for the mechanisms of glycosidases (1Sinnott M.L. Page M.I. Williams A. Enzyme Mechanisms. Royal Society of Chemistry, London1987: 259-291Google Scholar, 2Sinnott M.L. Chem. Rev. 1990; 90: 1171-1202Crossref Scopus (1485) Google Scholar, 3Svensson B. Søgaard M. J. Biotechnol. 1993; 29: 1-37Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). They are an inverting mechanism (Fig.4 a) and two retaining mechanisms which proceed through either an oxocarbonium ion intermediate (Fig.4 b) or a covalent enzyme-substrate intermediate (Fig.4 c). HEWL is one of the retaining glycosidases (26Dahlquist F.W. Borders C.L. Jacobson G. Raftery M.A. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 694-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The catalytic mechanism has been considered to involve an oxocarbonium ion intermediate (Fig. 4 b) that is stabilized by a negative charge of the carboxylic acid at Asp-52 (9Phillips D.C. Sci. Am. 1966; 215: 78-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 10Imoto T. Johnson L.N. North A.C.T. Phillips D.C. Rupley J.A. Boyer P. The Enzymes. 3rd Ed. Academic Press, New York1972: 665-868Google Scholar). The catalytic mechanism of T4 lysozyme was recently determined to have an inverting mechanism creating the α-anomer after hydrolyzing the β-glycosidic linkage (12Kuroki R. Weaver L.H. Matthews B.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1007-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Although T4 phage and hen egg white lysozymes have distinct catalytic mechanisms (12Kuroki R. Weaver L.H. Matthews B.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1007-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), a similar glycosyl-enzyme intermediate was observed in mutants. The location of the covalent linkage was confirmed to be between OE1 of Glu-52 and C-1 of NAG by x-ray crystallography as shown above, similar to the linkage seen in the T26E mutant of T4L. This indicates that the glutamic acid replacing Asp-52 of HEWL or Thr-26 of T4L acts as a nucleophile to attack C-1 from the α-side of the saccharide in subsite D. The mutant D52E has already been made by at least two groups (18Inoue M. Yamada H. Yasukochi T. Kuroki R. Miki T. Horiuchi T. Imoto T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5545-5553Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 27Muraki M. Harata K. Hayashi Y. Machida M. Jigami Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1079: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and was reported to retain less than 3% activity. The existence of the covalent enzyme-substrate adduct suggests that the catalytic action in D52E mutant HEWL proceeds through a covalent enzyme-substrate intermediate as shown in Fig. 4 c. This also implies that the D52E mutant HEWL has a different catalytic mechanism from that proposed for the wild type HEWL. The structural comparison between the wild type and D52E mutant showed that the position of the carboxylate oxygen atom closest to the substrate binding site has shifted about 1.8 Å toward the inside of the cleft in the mutant. This positional shift of the oxygen atom may be responsible for the creation of the covalent adduct. Moreover, a minor species corresponding to the covalent enzyme-substrate adduct was observed in D52S mutant by electron ion spray mass spectrometry (28Lumb K.J. Aplin R.T. Radford S.E. Archer D.B. Jeenes D.J. Lambert N. Mackenzie D.A. Dobson C.M. Lowe G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 153-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). If this minor species was created during the catalytic process, it would require a double displacement mechanism the same as that of the D52E mutant HEWL. The tertiary structure of the D52S mutant (24Hadfield A.T. Harvey D.J. Archer D.B. MacKenzie D.A. Jeenes D.J. Radford S.E. Lowe G. Dobson C.M. Johnson L.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 856-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), however, does not seem to support this mechanism, because the position of the OG atom of Ser-52 is 2.6 Å further away from the substrate compared with the OE1 atom of Glu-52.

The catalytic mechanism has been considered to involve an oxocarbonium ion intermediate (Fig. 4 b) that is stabilized by a negative charge of the carboxylic acid at Asp-52 (9Phillips D.C. Sci. Am. 1966; 215: 78-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 10Imoto T. Johnson L.N. North A.C.T. Phillips D.C. Rupley J.A. Boyer P. The Enzymes. 3rd Ed. Academic Press, New York1972: 665-868Google Scholar). The catalytic mechanism of T4 lysozyme was recently determined to have an inverting mechanism creating the α-anomer after hydrolyzing the β-glycosidic linkage (12Kuroki R. Weaver L.H. Matthews B.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1007-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Although T4 phage and hen egg white lysozymes have distinct catalytic mechanisms (12Kuroki R. Weaver L.H. Matthews B.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1007-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), a similar glycosyl-enzyme intermediate was observed in mutants. The location of the covalent linkage was confirmed to be between OE1 of Glu-52 and C-1 of NAG by x-ray crystallography as shown above, similar to the linkage seen in the T26E mutant of T4L. This indicates that the glutamic acid replacing Asp-52 of HEWL or Thr-26 of T4L acts as a nucleophile to attack C-1 from the α-side of the saccharide in subsite D. The mutant D52E has already been made by at least two groups (18Inoue M. Yamada H. Yasukochi T. Kuroki R. Miki T. Horiuchi T. Imoto T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5545-5553Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 27Muraki M. Harata K. Hayashi Y. Machida M. Jigami Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1079: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and was reported to retain less than 3% activity. The existence of the covalent enzyme-substrate adduct suggests that the catalytic action in D52E mutant HEWL proceeds through a covalent enzyme-substrate intermediate as shown in Fig. 4 c. This also implies that the D52E mutant HEWL has a different catalytic mechanism from that proposed for the wild type HEWL. The structural comparison between the wild type and D52E mutant showed that the position of the carboxylate oxygen atom closest to the substrate binding site has shifted about 1.8 Å toward the inside of the cleft in the mutant. This positional shift of the oxygen atom may be responsible for the creation of the covalent adduct. Moreover, a minor species corresponding to the covalent enzyme-substrate adduct was observed in D52S mutant by electron ion spray mass spectrometry (28Lumb K.J. Aplin R.T. Radford S.E. Archer D.B. Jeenes D.J. Lambert N. Mackenzie D.A. Dobson C.M. Lowe G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 153-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). If this minor species was created during the catalytic process, it would require a double displacement mechanism the same as that of the D52E mutant HEWL. The tertiary structure of the D52S mutant (24Hadfield A.T. Harvey D.J. Archer D.B. MacKenzie D.A. Jeenes D.J. Radford S.E. Lowe G. Dobson C.M. Johnson L.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 856-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), however, does not seem to support this mechanism, because the position of the OG atom of Ser-52 is 2.6 Å further away from the substrate compared with the OE1 atom of Glu-52. This would place the OG atom of Ser-52 too far away to react with the saccharide molecule directly. To solve this discrepancy, further analysis of the catalytic mechanism of these mutant HEWL is needed. It is already known that there are features common to T4L, GEWL, and HEWL. The first is the location of glutamic acid (Glu-11, Glu-35, and Glu-73). It is well known that the acidic residue located on the β-side of the saccharide is usually glutamic acid (i.e.Glu-11 in T4L, Glu-35 in HEWL, and Glu-73 in GEWL), which has been shown to be essential for the activity by chemical modifications and mutation analysis (12Kuroki R.

Chem. 1986; 261: 13571-13574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The glutamate is considered to act as a general acid to donate a proton to the glycosidic oxygen (O-4). Another common feature is the location of main chain peptides that interact with the N-acetyl group of the saccharide bound at subsite C. The interactions in the saccharide binding sites corresponding to subsite C in HEWL are strongly conserved between GEWL, HEWL, and T4L as mentioned previously (8Matthews B.W. Remington S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 4178-4182Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In contrast, it was previously reported that the acidic residue located on the α-side of the saccharide is not always essential for the activity as seen in hen egg white lysozyme mutants (14Malcom B.A. Rosenberg S.

Biol. 1995; 245: 54-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The catalytic function of the Asp-52 in HEWL is considered to be stabilization of the oxocarbonium ion (mechanism in Fig.4 b), while Asp-20 in T4L is thought to act as a base to help activate the water molecule to attack the saccharide from the α-side of the saccharide (mechanism in Fig. 4 a). It is now clear that the roles of the aspartic acids located on the α-side of the saccharide (Asp-20 in T4L, Asp-52 in HEWL) are different. The D52E mutant shows yet a third role in the catalytic function (mechanism in Fig. 4 c), which has already been seen in other glycosidases (4McCarter J.D. Withers S.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar, 32White A. Tull D. Johns K. Withers S., G. Rose D., R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The formation of the same covalent enzyme-substrate intermediate indicates that the locations of glutamic acid introduced into Asp-52 in HEWL and Thr-26 in T4L are functionally equivalent as shown in Table I. A careful structure comparison of the catalytic sites from three lysozymes shows that Asp-52 is located at the position equivalent to Thr-26 in T4L and Gly-90 in GEWL. The similar Cαlocations of Asp-52 in HEWL to Thr-26 in T4L and Gly-90 in GEWL suggest that the mutation of Asp-52 to a residue which has a short side chain such as Thr, Ser, Ala, or Gly will possibly result in changing the catalytic mechanism toward an inverting enzyme as observed for the wild type T4L. Indeed, a similar mutation has been made in β-glucosidase, and the formation of the α-anomer has been reported (33Wang Q. Graham R.W. Trimbur D. Warren R.A.J. Withers S.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 11594-11595Crossref Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Moreover, the D52S mutant of HEWL has been prepared, and the tertiary structure of the D52S mutant of HEWL with substrate was determined (24Hadfield A.T. Harvey D.J. Archer D.B. MacKenzie D.A. Jeenes D.J. Radford S.E. Lowe G. Dobson C.M. Johnson L.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 856-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The α-anomer seen in the crystal complex with the D52S mutant of HEWL is considered to be a product of hydrolysis. The α-anomer was interpreted as the result of mutarotation of product following a normal wild type HEWL retaining reaction. It would, however, be consistent with the D52S mutant of HEWL acting as an inverting enzyme as has been observed for wild type T4L. These findings support the hypothesis that the residue located on the α-side of the saccharide, such as Asp-52 in HEWL, Thr-26 in T4L, or probably Gly-90 in GEWL, is responsible for the differentiation of the catalytic mechanism. Moreover, the fact that T4L and GEWL, which have a short side chain on the α-side of the saccharide, do not catalyze transglycosylation, while HEWL, which has aspartate or glutamate (mutant) on the α-side of the saccharide and catalyzes transglycosylation, may indicate that this variability is also responsible for the functional difference between glycosidases and transglycosidases.

We also express thanks to Michiko Kanai of Thermo Quest K. K. for mass analysis."

The PKIβ form was first identified in rat testis (5Van Patten S.M. Ng D.C. Th'ng J.P.H. Angelos K.L. Smith A.J. Walsh D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5383-5387Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) in a follow-up of observations made earlier by Means and co-workers (11Tash J.S. Dedman J.R. Means A.R. J. Biol.

The PKIβ form purified was one of what appeared to be multiple forms of the protein present in testis, as was apparent from the DEAE chromatographic profile of the partially purified protein. The form purified was shown by protein sequencing and amino acid analysis to be a 70-amino acid protein with a blocked amino terminus (5Van Patten S.M. Ng D.C. Th'ng J.P.H. Angelos K.L. Smith A.J. Walsh D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5383-5387Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Identification of the gene for this protein indicated, however, that in addition to the appropriate in-frame ATG codon, a second upstream in-frame ATG codon was present. If translated, this alternate in-frame ATG codon would give rise to an alternate translational product with a 7- or 8-residue amino-terminal extension with the additional sequence of MRTDSSEM-, with the specific size dependent upon whether or not the N-terminal methionine was processed. Translational initiation in eukaryotes is affected by the context of the nucleotides surrounding the AUG codon of the mRNA (13Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2788) Google Scholar). The first and second in-frame AUG initiation codons in the PKIβ gene have the nucleotide sequences−3GUGAUGA+4 and−3GAGAUGA+4. With a G at position −3 and an A at position +4, both of these in-frame AUG codons have initiation sequences that would readily allow translation to be initiated at either site (13Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2788) Google Scholar). Neither, however, has the optimum Kozak sequence (−3(A/G)CCAUGG+4), and so read-through of the first upstream AUG codon, to allow initiation of translation at the second, appeared to be a significant possibility (see Fig. 1). The sequence of the amino-terminal amino acids of the isolated 70-amino acid PKIβ is consistent with its being directly synthesized and then processed to remove the terminal methionine and to add a blocking group (14Persson B. Flinta C. Jornvall H. Heijne G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 152: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 15Flinta C. Perrsson B. Jornvall H. Heijne G. Eur. J.

Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8242-8246Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In contrast, if synthesized from the first in-frame AUG codon, the amino-terminal sequence context is such that processing of its methionine would be much less likely to occur. This paper addresses the existence of this alternate translational product and also the other forms of PKIβ apparent from the DEAE profile. In total, it is now demonstrated that there exist at least eight isoforms of PKIβ, and in the accompanying paper (17Van Patten S.M. Donaldson L.F. McGuinness M.P. Kumar P. Alizadeh A.

The full nomenclature for these different species is developed subsequently in this paper. The initial 70-amino acid form isolated from rat testis, and originally termed PKIβ, is now more precisely termed PKIβ-70. The form that would be obtained by processing at the first upstream ATG site is termed PKIβ-78.Figure 6DEAE chromatographic separation of rat cerebellum and testis PKI isoforms.

(5Van Patten S.M. Ng D.C. Th'ng J.P.H. Angelos K.L. Smith A.J. Walsh D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5383-5387Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Purification of expressed PKIβ-70 was accomplished exactly as described for expressed PKIβ-78, except that the DEAE column was at pH 6.0, and the final HPLC was replaced by gel filtration using a Superdex 75 HPLC column and elution with 0.3 m ammonium acetate, pH 7.0. The two protein products were characterized by amino acid analysis and by determination of the sequence of at least the first 10 amino-terminal residues. The bacterial expression system for a third putative form of PKIβ, termed β2 by Scarpetta and Uhler (8Scarpetta M.A. Uhler M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10927-10931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and containing the sequence of PKIβ-78 plus an additional 14-amino acid amino-terminal extension, was also created, and the expressed protein was purified by similar procedures; however, no evidence for its existence in rat tissue was observed in these studies. For Western blot analyses of PKI isoforms, the tissues from adult Harlan Sprague Dawley rats were freeze-clamped with Wollenberger clamps precooled in liquid nitrogen immediately after dissection. The frozen tissue was powdered and then rapidly homogenized with a glass-Teflon homogenizer in 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0 (1 ml/g of tissue), containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (0.5 mm(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm leupeptin, 2 mm benzamidine, 0.1 mml-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone, and 20 milliunits/ml aprotinin). The extracts were heat-treated to 92 °C for 10 min and spun at high speed in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C for 2 min, and the supernatants were used for gel electrophoresis. Alkaline phosphatase treatment, where noted, was accomplished by incubating the tissue extract with 5 units/μl alkaline phosphatase (calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) in 50 mmTris-Cl, pH 8.0, and 0.125 mm EDTA plus the same mixture of protease inhibitors at 1:4 dilution for 2 h at 30 °C. After treatment, the samples were directly applied to the isoelectric focusing tube gels. Tissue samples for PKI isoform analyses were resolved by one- or two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, as noted. One-dimensional SDS-PAGE was in accord with Laemmli (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205496) Google Scholar) using 12–18% gradient gels in 0.1% SDS and 0.375 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.8. The first dimension for two-dimensional electrophoresis utilized 1.5 mm x 7.5 cm tube gels (Hoeffer Scientific Instruments) and 2% pH 4–6 ampholytes (BDH), with anode and cathode buffers of 0.085% phosphoric acid and 20 mm sodium hydroxide, respectively. Following the first dimension, gels were equilibrated for 15 min in 0.125 m Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 4.9 mm dithiothreitol, and 2% SDS and then applied to a 12–18% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. For Western blot analyses, following electrophoresis, the gels were equilibrated in 10 mm CAPS, pH 11.0, for 30 min, and the proteins then electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Gelman Instrument Co.) for 1.5 h at 25 V. The membranes were incubated for 1 h in blocking buffer consisting of 0.5% casein and 0.2% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl and 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4). The polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was incubated overnight with the designated primary anti-peptide antibody (1:5000 dilution in blocking buffer) and then washed 1 × 1 min and 3 × 10 min with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% casein and 0.2% Tween 20. The membranes were then incubated for 2 h with biotinylated anti-guinea pig donkey IgG antibody (1:2500 dilution in blocking buffer); washed as before; incubated for 30 min with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin; washed sequentially with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% casein and 0.2% Tween 20 (1 × 1 min and 2 × 10 min) and with 0.1m Tris-Cl, pH 9.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 5 mm MgCl2 (5 min); and then developed with the alkaline phosphatase nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate substrate kit (Pierce 34041). For the SDS gels, molecular weight standards were as denoted in Fig. 2. The relative isoform composition was determined by scanning the Western blot two-dimensional gels and integrating the signals using an IS-1000 digital imaging system (Innotech Scientific Corp.). Anti-peptide antibodies were prepared by D. Harrison (of this laboratory) using ovalbumin-peptide conjugates as the antigen. For the anti-PKIα-(5–22) and anti-PKIβ-(5–22) antibodies, the conjugates were synthesized by derivatization of the amino terminus of the synthesized peptide with the heterobifunctional cross-linker maleimidohexanoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester and then cross-linking to N-succinimidylS-acetylthioacetate-derivatized ovalbumin (20Weston P.D. Devries J.A. Wrigglesworth P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 612: 40-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 21Duncan R.J. Weston P.D. Wrigglesworth R. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 68-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). For the anti-PKIβ-(60–70) antibodies, the peptide was synthesized with an additional carboxyl-terminal cysteine, and the conjugates were synthesized by cross-linking maleimidohexanoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester-derivatized ovalbumin to the peptide via the terminal cysteine. All anti-peptide antibodies were raised in guinea pigs using procedures in accord with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Peptide synthesis and purification were in accord with previously described methods (10Glass D.B. Cheng H.-C. Mende-Mueller L. Reed J. Walsh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8802-8810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Chemicals were from Pierce. Routine assays of PKI inhibitory activity were as described previously (22Whitehouse S. Walsh D.A. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 80-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) using histone II-A as protein substrate and the PKA Cα subunit obtained by bacterial expression (23Slice L.W. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20940-20946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).K i values were determined by the method of Henderson (24Henderson P.J.F. Biochem. J. 1972; 127: 321-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar) using 8 μm ATP; Kemptide concentrations of 5.6, 2.8, 1.4 and 0.7 μm; PKIβ isoform concentrations from 7.9 to 26.6 nm; 0.8 nm PKA; and all other conditions as described previously (25Whitehouse S. Walsh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3682-3692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other kinetic assays utilized 30 μm Kemptide and 0.125 mm ATP. PKG-1α was kindly provided by Dr. Sharon Francis (Department of Molecular Physiology and Biophysics, Vanderbilt University). The assay of PKG inhibitory activity was undertaken as described previously (26Glass D.B. Cheng H.-C. Kemp B.E. Walsh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12166-12171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using [Ala34]H2B-(29–35) as substrate. Both PKIβ-78 and PKIβ-70 were readily obtained by the creation of suitable bacterial expression vectors and were each purified to homogeneity. Their identity was established by amino acid analyses and amino-terminal sequencing. Their purity was established by SDS gel electrophoresis. We have previously demonstrated that, like the original PKIα, PKIβ-70, as directly isolated from rat testis, is a specific inhibitor of PKA (5Van Patten S.M. Ng D.C. Th'ng J.P.H. Angelos K.L. Smith A.J. Walsh D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5383-5387Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The expressed PKIβ-78 and also the bacterially expressed PKIβ-70 were likewise specific high affinity inhibitors of PKA and did not inhibit even the highly homologous cGMP-dependent protein kinase (Fig. 1).K i values for all of these forms, as determined by Henderson analysis (24Henderson P.J.F. Biochem. J. 1972; 127: 321-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar), were indistinguishable (expressed PKIβ-78, 0.14 nm; expressed PKIβ-70, 0.1 nm; and rat testis PKIβ-70, 0.14 nm). Each were competitive inhibitors versus protein substrate. The availability of a purified preparation of PKIβ-78 as a standard allowed us to address the issue of whether this possible alternate translational initiation form of PKIβ occurred physiologically. Other forms of testis PKI also appeared to be a likelihood as evidenced by the earlier characterization of PKI by Mean and co-workers and antibody identification of multiple size forms (11Tash J.S. Dedman J.R. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 1241-1247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,12Beale E.G. Dedman J.R. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 6322-6327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Tash J.S. Welsh M.J. Means A.R. Cell. 1980; 21: 57-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To make an evaluation of the physiological presence of PKIβ-78 and to expand the context of investigation to an assessment of the potential existence of other PKIβ forms, specific anti-peptide antibodies were prepared against the peptides PKIα-(5–22) (TTYADFIASGRTGRRNAI), PKIβ-(5–22) (SVISSFASSARAGRRNAL), and PKIβ-(60–70) (GQPKKPLDEDK). The nomenclature for these peptides, as used previously (5Van Patten S.M. Ng D.C. Th'ng J.P.H. Angelos K.L. Smith A.J. Walsh D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5383-5387Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 10Glass D.B. Cheng H.-C. Mende-Mueller L. Reed J. Walsh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8802-8810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is based upon the sequence of the full PKI proteins. The first two of these peptides contain the pseudosubstrate regions of PKIα and PKIβ, respectively, and whereas some degree of overlapping antigenic specificity might have been expected between them, as shown below, it was not observed. The third peptide is from a region of PKIβ in which there is absolutely no homology to PKIα. Western blot analyses with these anti-peptide antibodies revealed a complex pattern of PKI isoforms. In both testis and cerebellum, the prominent if not exclusive form of PKIα detected is the 75-amino acid species of PKI that is the form of inhibitor protein originally and extensively characterized from skeletal muscle and other tissues (1Walsh D.A. Angelos K.L. Van Patten S.M. Glass D.B. Garetto L.P. Kemp B.E. Peptides and Protein Phosphorylation. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1990: 43-84Google Scholar). This form is readily detected by anti-PKIα-(5–22) antisera, but not by anti-PKIβ-(5–22), anti-PKIβ-(60–70), or control sera (Fig.2). This result demonstrates the specificity of the anti-PKIα peptide antisera. In cerebellum (Fig. 2), as has also been seen in some other tissues (data not shown), a small amount of a slightly lower molecular mass PKIα species is also evident. This latter form may be related to the PKI-I′ species that has been previously described (28McPherson J.M. Whitehouse S. Walsh D.A. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 4835-4845Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 29Whitehouse S. McPherson J.M. Walsh D.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1980; 203: 734-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Western blot analyses of a variety of rat tissues showed the expected profile of distribution of PKIα, with a high predominance in brain and various muscle types (data not shown). These data were as anticipated from previous studies based upon mRNA distribution (6Van Patten S.M. Howard P. Walsh D.A. Maurer R.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 2114-2122Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The pattern with PKIβ is considerably more complex than is observed for PKIα. Western blot analyses and one-dimensional SDS-PAGE showed the presence of at least three major PKIβ size forms of ∼7, 14, and 15.5 kDa in both testis and cerebellum (Fig. 2). These three forms were detected with both the anti-PKIβ-(5–22) and anti-PKIβ-(60–70) antisera, indicating that all three contained, as a minimum, the homologous amino acid sequences matching both the amino- and carboxyl-terminal sequences of PKIβ-70. These forms were not detected with either control or anti-PKIα-(5–22) antisera (Fig. 2), indicating the specificity of the anti-PKIβ antibodies, and this set of data demonstrates the absence of cross-reactivity of either the PKIα forms with the PKIβ antibodies or vice versa. The sizes of these three forms identified here are closely similar to those of the testis PKI species previously identified by Means and co-workers (11Tash J.S. Dedman J.R. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 1241-1247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,27Tash J.S. Welsh M.J. Means A.R. Cell. 1980; 21: 57-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). A fourth low abundance form of PKIβ, of slightly higher apparent molecular mass than the 7-kDa form, was also evident on the one-dimensional gels from testis and cerebellum (Fig. 2). Western blot analyses of two-dimensional gels (first dimension, isoelectric focusing; and second dimension, SDS-PAGE) showed that the pattern of PKIβ isoforms is even more complex. In testis extracts, at least eight forms of PKIβ are evident, with each of the three predominant forms and the fourth less abundant species, as separated based upon size (Fig. 2), being composed of a pair of charge isoforms (Fig. 3 a). In cerebellum, only the more cationic species of each pair was evident, except for the low abundance form that was present in both tissues as predominantly the more anionic species (Fig. 3 b). There was a good correspondence between the gel migration of the cationic form of the three most abundant species in testis extracts with their counterparts in cerebellum, suggesting that these forms were likely identical in both two tissues. The diversity of forms in both testis and cerebellum was evident with both the anti-PKIβ-(5–22) and anti-PKIβ-(60–70) antisera (Fig. 3,c and d) with a matching intensity of the spots. This is indicative that all of the species identified in testis and cerebellum contain key components (if not all) of the sequence that has been established for PKIβ-70. The nomenclature for these different forms, as used in this report, is presented in Fig. 4 a. The basis for this nomenclatu"
https://openalex.org/W2134186017,"We have previously demonstrated that there exist two distinct genes for the thermostable inhibitor protein of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, PKIα and PKIβ (Van Patten, S. M., Howard, P., Walsh, D. A., and Maurer, R. A. (1992)Mol. Endocrinol. 6, 2114–2122). We have also shown that in the testis, at least eight forms of PKIβ exist, differing as a result of at least post-translational modification and alternate translational initiation (Kumar, P., Van Patten, S. M., and Walsh, D. A. (1997)J. Biol. Chem. 272, 20011–20020). We now report that in the testis, there is a unique cellular distribution of protein kinase inhibitor forms, with PKIβ being essentially (if not exclusively) a germ cell protein and PKIα being expressed primarily in Sertoli cells. Furthermore, there is a progressive change in the forms of PKIβ that are present within germ cells with development that is initiated in testis tubules and continues as the germ cells migrate through the epididymis. These conclusions are derived from studies with isolated cell populations and with the at/atgerm cell-deficient mouse line, by in situ hybridization, and by following the developmental expression of these proteins in both testis and epididymis. We have also shown that follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) can increase the expression of both PKIα and PKIβ. The FSH-regulated expression of PKIα in the Sertoli cell likely occurs via the normal route of second messenger signal transduction. In contrast, the FSH-dependent PKIβ expression must arise by some form of Sertoli cell-germ cell intercommunication. We have previously demonstrated that there exist two distinct genes for the thermostable inhibitor protein of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, PKIα and PKIβ (Van Patten, S. M., Howard, P., Walsh, D. A., and Maurer, R. A. (1992)Mol. Endocrinol. 6, 2114–2122). We have also shown that in the testis, at least eight forms of PKIβ exist, differing as a result of at least post-translational modification and alternate translational initiation (Kumar, P., Van Patten, S.

In contrast, the FSH-dependent PKIβ expression must arise by some form of Sertoli cell-germ cell intercommunication. The cAMP signal transduction pathway is central to the physiological function, development, and maturation of both the Sertoli and germ cells of the testis. cAMP is one of the key mediators of the actions of FSH, 1The abbreviations used are: FSH, follicle-stimulating hormone; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; PKI, protein kinase inhibitor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TPCK, l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone; kb, kilobase(s). 1The abbreviations used are: FSH, follicle-stimulating hormone; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; PKI, protein kinase inhibitor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TPCK, l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone; kb, kilobase(s). whose primary, nearly sole target in males is the Sertoli cell (1Heckert L. Griswold M.D. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1993; 48: 61-77Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The response of the Sertoli cell to FSH is complex and changes developmentally, affecting at least two critical phases of Sertoli cell development (2Russell L.D. Griswold M.D. The Sertoli Cell. Cache River Press, Clearwater, FL1993Google Scholar). In the rat, FSH is required for normal proliferation of Sertoli cells in uteroand in the first 2 weeks of life, at which time their proliferation essentially ceases. FSH is essential for proper maturation of the Sertoli cell and is required for correct formation of the tight junctions responsible for the “blood-testis” barrier. FSH action on the Sertoli cell is also necessary for initiation of the first wave of spermatogenesis (2Russell L.D. Griswold M.D. The Sertoli Cell. Cache River Press, Clearwater, FL1993Google Scholar). cAMP also has a number of important functional roles in germ cells. In early spermatogenesis, it is a key regulator of transcription, acting via stimulation of PKA-dependent phosphorylation of the complex family of activator and repressor transcription factors, CREB, CREM, and CREMτ (3Foulkes N.S. Mellstrom B. Benusiglio E. Sassone-Corsi P. Nature. 1992; 355: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 4Delmas V. van der Hoorn F. Mellstrom B. Jegou B. Sassone-Corsi P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1502-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). During the transit of sperm through the epididymis, an elevation of cAMP is one of the primary initiation signals for the acquisition of flagellar movement (5Tash J.S. Gagnon C. Controls of Sperm Motility: Biological and Clinical Aspects. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1990: 229-240Google Scholar, 6Hoskins D.D. Vijyaraghavan S. Gagnon C.

Biochem. 1987; 35: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). One of the prominent proteins whose cAMP-dependent phosphorylation is correlated with the onset of sperm motility is a 56,000-Da protein, first called axokinin (8Tash J.S. Means A.R. Biol. Reprod. 1982; 26: 745-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 9Brandt H. Hoskins D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 982-987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but subsequently identified as the PKA RII subunit (10Noland T.D. Abumrad N.A. Beth A.H. Garbers D.L. Biol. Reprod. 1987; 37: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar,11Paupard M.C. MacLeod J. Wasco W. Orr G.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1988; 37: 161-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Later in germ cell function, cAMP appears to be a key mediator to induce capacitation (12Bellve A.R. Cavicchia J.C. Millette C.F. O'Brein D.A. Bhatnagar Y.M. Dym M. J. Cell Biol. 1977; 74: 68-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar).Given the extensive role of cAMP-mediated phosphorylation in these essential processes of germ cell maturation, it is not surprising that there also exists some complexity of PKA itself. Essentially all of the different species of PKA subunits (RIα, RIβ, RIIα, RIIβ, Cα, and Cγ) are apparent in these cells, with key differences in their distribution among the distinct cell types and noted changes with cellular development (13Lonnerberg P. Parvinen M. Jahnsen T. Hansson V. Persson H. Biol. Reprod. 1992; 46: 1057-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 14Oyen O. Myklebust F. Scott J.D. Cadd G.G. McKnight G.S. Hansson V.

Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). A complex pattern of PKI isoforms is also beginning to emerge. It is now established that the PKI isoforms, as first studied in skeletal muscle (17Walsh D.A. Angelos K.L. Van Patten S.M. Glass D.B. Garetto L.P. Kemp B.E. Peptides and Protein Phosphorylation. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1990: 43-84Google Scholar) and testis (18Tash J.S. Dedman J.R. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 1241-1247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Beale E.G. Dedman J.R. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 6322-6327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), arise from two distinct genes (20Van Patten S.M. Ng D.C. Th'ng J.P.H. Angelos K.L. Smith A.J.

Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 2114-2122Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and furthermore that at least eight forms of PKIβ exist that differ due to at least post-translational modification and alternate translational initiation (22Kumar P. Van Patten S.M. Walsh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20011-20020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 23Scarpetta M.A. Uhler M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10927-10931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrate that the PKIα and PKIβ isoforms are differentially localized to Sertoli and germ cells, respectively; that there is a progressive change in PKIβ isoform formation with germ cell development; that testis PKIα and PKIβ are both under hormonal/developmental regulation; and that Sertoli cell-germ cell communication likely plays an important role in the regulation of PKIβ expression.DISCUSSIONThese data add another layer of complexity to the already intricate picture of the role of cAMP in the transduction of events in developing germ and Sertoli cells and subsequent germ cell maturation. From extensive studies that have been undertaken by a variety of approaches including studies with isolated germ cell populations, testis from different developmental ages, and microdissected testis fractions to identify germ cells at different stages of development, Jahnsen and co-workers (13Lonnerberg P. Parvinen M. Jahnsen T. Hansson V. Persson H. Biol. Reprod. 1992; 46: 1057-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 14Oyen O. Myklebust F. Scott J.D. Cadd G.G. McKnight G.S. Hansson V.

These results are likely reflective that each of the PKA subunits has specific roles at different stages of spermatogenesis and in the different cell types. The cAMP-responsive transcription factors that are key for germ cell development exhibit a pattern of even greater complexity than that observed for the PKA subunits. Alternate transcript processing of the separate genes for CREM and CREB occurs, leading to both activators and repressors of cAMP-regulated transcription, and as with the PKA subunits, which form of these factors is present at which time is very cell- and developmental stage-specific (3Foulkes N.S.

We now observe with PKIβ an intricate pattern of expression, especially evident by the profile of forms that evolve with germ cell maturation.

Left to be unraveled is the unique function/activity that each of the different PKIβ forms manifests, and only from that knowledge will an understanding be derived of why the transitions among the forms may be important for the process of germ cell maturation. What is apparent is that the potential for detailed and specific regulation within the cAMP signal transduction cascade for the regulation of germ cell function is immense. There is a growing body of evidence that one key function of PKI is in the trafficking of the PKA catalytic subunit (45Fantozzi D.A. Taylor S.S. Howard P.W. Maurer R.A. Feramisco J.R. Meinkoth J.L.

Whether each of the multiple forms of PKIβ has this as its function and/or manifests some other key regulatory role remains to be resolved, and such information is critical to our understanding of the role that PKIβ plays in germ cell maturation. As we have now demonstrated (Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), PKIα and PKIβ are also specifically segregated between nurse cells and germ cells, respectively, in both the testis and epididymis, and the specialized role of each of these isoforms awaits elucidation.The transcriptional regulation of both CREM and PKIβ is FSH-dependent (Ref. 32Foulkes N.S. Schlotter F. Pevet P. Sassone-Corsi P. Nature. 1993; 362: 264-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar and Figs. 10 and 11). However, in the male, only Sertoli cells have been established as FSH-sensitive; germ cells are not directly regulated by FSH as they do not contain FSH receptors (1Heckert L. Griswold M.D. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1993; 48: 61-77Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Heckert L.L. Griswold M.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 670-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). To accomplish the FSH-dependent regulation of germ cell PKIβ transcription therefore requires that some Sertoli cell-derived FSH-dependent message modulates germ cell PKIβ transcription. A model for such is presented schematically in Fig. 12. Candidates for the message between the Sertoli cell and germ cell include one or more of the many Sertoli cell-derived paracrine factors that have been defined (48Skinner M.K. Endocr. Rev. 1991; 12: 45-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 49Pescovitz O.H. Srivastava C.H. Breyer P.R. Monts B.A. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1994; 5: 126-131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) or some agent, such as cAMP, that may be transmitted through the gap junctions that exist between these cell types. The cAMP signal transduction pathway is central to the physiological function, development, and maturation of both the Sertoli and germ cells of the testis. cAMP is one of the key mediators of the actions of FSH, 1The abbreviations used are: FSH, follicle-stimulating hormone; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; PKI, protein kinase inhibitor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TPCK, l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone; kb, kilobase(s). 1The abbreviations used are: FSH, follicle-stimulating hormone; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; PKI, protein kinase inhibitor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TPCK, l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone; kb, kilobase(s). whose primary, nearly sole target in males is the Sertoli cell (1Heckert L. Griswold M.D. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1993; 48: 61-77Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The response of the Sertoli cell to FSH is complex and changes developmentally, affecting at least two critical phases of Sertoli cell development (2Russell L.D. Griswold M.D. The Sertoli Cell. Cache River Press, Clearwater, FL1993Google Scholar). In the rat, FSH is required for normal proliferation of Sertoli cells in uteroand in the first 2 weeks of life, at which time their proliferation essentially ceases. FSH is essential for proper maturation of the Sertoli cell and is required for correct formation of the tight junctions responsible for the “blood-testis” barrier. FSH action on the Sertoli cell is also necessary for initiation of the first wave of spermatogenesis (2Russell L.D. Griswold M.D. The Sertoli Cell. Cache River Press, Clearwater, FL1993Google Scholar). cAMP also has a number of important functional roles in germ cells. In early spermatogenesis, it is a key regulator of transcription, acting via stimulation of PKA-dependent phosphorylation of the complex family of activator and repressor transcription factors, CREB, CREM, and CREMτ (3Foulkes N.S. Mellstrom B. Benusiglio E. Sassone-Corsi P. Nature. 1992; 355: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 4Delmas V. van der Hoorn F. Mellstrom B. Jegou B. Sassone-Corsi P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1502-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). During the transit of sperm through the epididymis, an elevation of cAMP is one of the primary initiation signals for the acquisition of flagellar movement (5Tash J.S. Gagnon C. Controls of Sperm Motility: Biological and Clinical Aspects. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1990: 229-240Google Scholar, 6Hoskins D.D. Vijyaraghavan S. Gagnon C.

Biochem. 1987; 35: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). One of the prominent proteins whose cAMP-dependent phosphorylation is correlated with the onset of sperm motility is a 56,000-Da protein, first called axokinin (8Tash J.S. Means A.R. Biol. Reprod. 1982; 26: 745-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 9Brandt H. Hoskins D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 982-987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but subsequently identified as the PKA RII subunit (10Noland T.D. Abumrad N.A. Beth A.H. Garbers D.L. Biol.

Later in germ cell function, cAMP appears to be a key mediator to induce capacitation (12Bellve A.R. Cavicchia J.C. Millette C.F. O'Brein D.A. Bhatnagar Y.M. Dym M. J. Cell Biol. 1977; 74: 68-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar). Given the extensive role of cAMP-mediated phosphorylation in these essential processes of germ cell maturation, it is not surprising that there also exists some complexity of PKA itself. Essentially all of the different species of PKA subunits (RIα, RIβ, RIIα, RIIβ, Cα, and Cγ) are apparent in these cells, with key differences in their distribution among the distinct cell types and noted changes with cellular development (13Lonnerberg P.

It is now established that the PKI isoforms, as first studied in skeletal muscle (17Walsh D.A. Angelos K.L. Van Patten S.M. Glass D.B. Garetto L.P. Kemp B.E. Peptides and Protein Phosphorylation.

In this report, we demonstrate that the PKIα and PKIβ isoforms are differentially localized to Sertoli and germ cells, respectively; that there is a progressive change in PKIβ isoform formation with germ cell development; that testis PKIα and PKIβ are both under hormonal/developmental regulation; and that Sertoli cell-germ cell communication likely plays an important role in the regulation of PKIβ expression. DISCUSSIONThese data add another layer of complexity to the already intricate picture of the role of cAMP in the transduction of events in developing germ and Sertoli cells and subsequent germ cell maturation. From extensive studies that have been undertaken by a variety of approaches including studies with isolated germ cell populations, testis from different developmental ages, and microdissected testis fractions to identify germ cells at different stages of development, Jahnsen and co-workers (13Lonnerberg P.

These results are likely reflective that each of the PKA subunits has specific roles at different stages of spermatogenesis and in the different cell types. The cAMP-responsive transcription factors that are key for germ cell development exhibit a pattern of even greater complexity than that observed for the PKA subunits. Alternate transcript processing of the separate genes for CREM and CREB occurs, leading to both activators and repressors of cAMP-regulated transcription, and as with the PKA subunits, which form of these factors is present at which time is very cell- and developmental stage-specific (3Foulkes N.S.

https://openalex.org/W2039976180,"Abstract Using the three-dimensional structures of thrombin and the leech-derived tryptase inhibitor (LDTI), which does not inhibit thrombin, we were able to construct three LDTI variants inhibiting thrombin. Trimming of the inhibitor reactive site loop to fit thrombin’s narrow active site cleft resulted in inhibition constants (K i) in the 10 nmconcentration range; similar values were obtained by the addition of an acidic C-terminal peptide corresponding to hirudin’s tail to LDTI. Combination of both modifications is additive, resulting in very strong inhibition of thrombin (K i in the picomolar range). On the one hand, these results confirm the significance of the restricted active site cleft of thrombin in determining its high cleavage specificity; on the other, they demonstrate that sufficient binding energy at the fibrinogen recognition exosite can force thrombin to accept otherwise unfavorable residues in the active site cleft. The best inhibitor thus obtained is as effective as hirudin in plasma-based clotting assays."
https://openalex.org/W2085118627,"Escherichia coli carbamyl-phosphate synthetase consists of two subunits that act in concert to synthesize carbamyl phosphate. The 40-kDa subunit is an amidotransferase (GLN subunit) that hydrolyzes glutamine and transfers ammonia to the 120-kDa synthetase subunit (CPS subunit). The enzyme can also catalyze ammonia-dependent carbamyl phosphate synthesis if provided with exogenous ammonia. In mammalian cells, homologous amidotransferase and synthetase domains are carried on a single polypeptide chain called CAD. Deletion of the 29-residue linker that bridges the GLN and CPS domains of CAD stimulates glutamine-dependent carbamyl phosphate synthesis and abolishes the ammonia-dependent reaction (Guy, H. I., and Evans, D. R. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 19906-19912), suggesting that the deletion mutant is trapped in a closed high activity conformation. Since the catalytic mechanisms of the mammalian and bacterial proteins are the same, we anticipated that similar changes in the function of the E. coli protein could be produced by direct fusion of the GLN and CPS subunits. A construct was made in which the intergenic region between the contiguous carA and carB genes was deleted and the sequences encoding the carbamyl-phosphate synthetase subunits were fused in frame. The resulting fusion protein was activated 10-fold relative to the native protein, was unresponsive to the allosteric activator ornithine, and could no longer use ammonia as a nitrogen donor. Moreover, the functional linkage that coordinates the rate of glutamine hydrolysis with the activation of bicarbonate was abolished, suggesting that the protein was locked in an activated conformation similar to that induced by the simultaneous binding of all substrates."
https://openalex.org/W2022607848,"Abstract The ability of P22 repressor protein to distinguish between the six naturally occurring operator binding sites is critically important in determining whether the bacteriophage chooses to grow lytically or lysogenically. We have shown that changes in the highly conserved bases at P22 operator positions 3, 5, 6, and 7 prevent specific binding of P22 repressor. Moreover, studies of mutant proteins identified the three repressor amino acids that directly contact these conserved bases. The pattern of operator sequence conservation permits these direct amino acid-base pair interactions to occur in all except one of the 12 operator half-sites in the phage chromosome. Therefore, repressor differential affinity for these sites cannot be due to these highly conserved base pair-amino acid interactions. Our binding studies show that the nonconserved bases at positions 2 and 4 also play an important role in determining the relative affinity of the naturally occurring P22 operators for P22 repressor. Our data indicate that the direct contacts between the three solvent-exposed amino acids and the conserved bases in the binding site lock these amino acids in place, forming a scaffold allowing the rest of the amino acids side chains to form weaker interactions with the nonconserved bases in the binding site."
https://openalex.org/W2052179482,"Abstract H-protein of the glycine cleavage system has a lipoic acid prosthetic group. Selenolipoic acid is a lipoic acid analog in which both sulfur atoms are replaced by selenium atoms. Two isoforms of bovine lipoyltransferase that are responsible for the attachment of lipoic acid to H-protein had an affinity for selenolipoyl-AMP and transferred the selenolipoyl moiety to bovine apoH-protein comparable to lipoyl-AMP. Selenolipoylated H-protein was overexpressed inEscherichia coli and purified. Selenolipoylated H-protein was 26% as effective as lipoylated H-protein in the glycine decarboxylation reaction, in which reduction of the diselenide bond of selenolipoylated H-protein is catalyzed by P-protein. The diselenide form of selenolipoylated H-protein was a poor substrate for L-protein, and the rate of reduction was 0.5% of that of lipoylated H-protein. The rate of the overall glycine cleavage reaction with selenolipoylated H-protein was <1% of that with lipoylated H-protein. These results are consistent with the difference in the redox potential between the diselenide and disulfide bonds. In contrast, selenolipoylated H-protein showed three times as high glycine-14CO2exchange activity as lipoylated H-protein, presumably because the rate of reoxidation of reduced selenolipoylated H-protein is much higher than that of lipoylated H-protein."
https://openalex.org/W2078547946,"The amidotransferase or glutaminase domain (GLN domain) of mammalian carbamyl-phosphate synthetase II (CPSase II) catalyzes glutamine hydrolysis and transfers ammonia to the synthetase domain (CPS domain), where carbamyl phosphate formation is catalyzed in three consecutive reactions. The GLN and CPS domains are part of a single polypeptide and are connected via a 29-amino acid chain segment (GC linker). In contrast, the two comparable domains ofEscherichia coli CPSase are not fused, but are separate, noncovalently associated subunits. To establish the function of the GC linker in mammalian CPSase, it was deleted, and the two domains were directly fused. The deletion mutant not only catalyzed glutamine-dependent carbamyl phosphate synthesis, but was activated 10-fold relative to its wild-type counterpart. However, ammonia-dependent synthesis of carbamyl phosphate was abolished, indicating that ammonia no longer had access to the active site on the CPS domain. The mutant was still sensitive to inhibition by the allosteric effector UTP, but was no longer activated by the allosteric effector phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate, although evidence indicated that the latter could bind to the enzyme. The linker appears to serve as a spacer that allows the complex to cycle between two conformations, an open low activity form in which the ammonia site on the CPS domain is accessible and an activated conformation in which the ammonia generated in situ from glutamine is directly channeled to the CPS active site and access to exogenous ammonia is blocked. The amidotransferase or glutaminase domain (GLN domain) of mammalian carbamyl-phosphate synthetase II (CPSase II) catalyzes glutamine hydrolysis and transfers ammonia to the synthetase domain (CPS domain), where carbamyl phosphate formation is catalyzed in three consecutive reactions. The GLN and CPS domains are part of a single polypeptide and are connected via a 29-amino acid chain segment (GC linker). In contrast, the two comparable domains ofEscherichia coli CPSase are not fused, but are separate, noncovalently associated subunits. To establish the function of the GC linker in mammalian CPSase, it was deleted, and the two domains were directly fused. The deletion mutant not only catalyzed glutamine-dependent carbamyl phosphate synthesis, but was activated 10-fold relative to its wild-type counterpart. However, ammonia-dependent synthesis of carbamyl phosphate was abolished, indicating that ammonia no longer had access to the active site on the CPS domain. The mutant was still sensitive to inhibition by the allosteric effector UTP, but was no longer activated by the allosteric effector phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate, although evidence indicated that the latter could bind to the enzyme.

Glutamine is hydrolyzed on the GLN domain, and the ammonia is transferred to the CPS domain, where it is used along with bicarbonate and ATP to make carbamyl phosphate in a series of three consecutive partial reactions. This mechanism, which is thought to be general for all members of this family of enzymes, was established for Escherichia coli CPSase by measuring the partial reactions, trapping intermediates, and positional isotope exchange (4Anderson P.M.

The pH dependence of the biosynthetic reaction indicates that ammonia, not ammonium ion, is the substrate, and thus, the ammonia generatedin situ by glutamine hydrolysis must be sequestered within the complex to prevent protonation (3Meister A.

Despite the differences in the structural organization and mode of regulation, the bacterial and mammalian CPSases have a high degree of sequence similarity (22Bein K. Simmer J.P. Evans D.R. J. Biol.

Evol. 1992; 35: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) made the interesting observation that fusion of the E. coli GLN and CPS subunits via the CAD GC linker did not alter the ammonia- or glutamine-dependent activity of the bacterial enzyme. The authors proposed that the linked domains found in CAD arose by the fusion of genes encoding ancestral monofunctional subunits analogous to those of E. coliCPSase. To further elucidate the function of the interdomain GC linker, the GLN and CPS domains of the mammalian protein were fused directly in frame without the linker. The unexpected result was that glutamine-dependent carbamyl phosphate synthesis was activated 10-fold, whereas the ammonia-dependent activity was abolished or severely curtailed. We conclude that the linker allows the complex to cycle between inactive and active conformations and that deletion of the linker essentially traps the molecule in an activated conformation. The plasmid pHL1 (30Guy H.I. Evans D.R. J. Biol.

Strain L673 also lacks the lon protease. E. colistrain EK1104 (31Nowlan S.F. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14712-14716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was a gift of Evan Kantrowitz. The 87-base pair sequence encoding the GC linker (Fig. 1) was deleted from pHL1 (30Guy H.I. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13762-13769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), a plasmid that encodes the mammalian CPS and GLN domains. The linker-coding sequence, which extends from theSmaI site (residue 1095) to residue 1182, was deleted (Fig.2) by cleaving pHL1 with SmaI andAvrII (at base pair 1194). Following cleavage, the large fragment was isolated and religated after removal of the 5′-extensions with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase. The resulting construct, pHL1ΔGClnk, lacks the coding sequence for the 29-residue linker and 4 residues from the amino-terminal end of the CPS domain. 2Although the 4 amino acids deleted from the amino-terminal end of the CPS domain are conserved in other CPSases, their removal is not likely to be responsible for the observed kinetic changes since the same amino acids were deleted from the E. coli fusion protein (49Guy H.I. Rotgeri A. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19913-19918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and the normal activity was restored when the fusion protein was cleaved with elastase. pCKΔGClnk, a plasmid that encodes the entire CAD polypeptide but lacks the GC linker, was made using the approach used to construct the full-length CAD clone (34Guy H.I. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23808-23816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fragment containing the aspartate transcarbamylase- and dihydroorotase-coding sequences, obtained by cleaving pCAD142 withXbaI, was ligated to pHL1ΔGClnk, which had been linearized with the same enzyme. Another construct, pHG-GLNGClnk, which encodes the mammalian GLN domain with the linker attached, was made by deleting the CPS domain (Fig. 2) from pHL1 by cleavage with AvrII andEcoRI. The ends of the large fragment were made flush by treatment with the Klenow fragment and mung bean nuclease prior to ligation. The fidelity of these constructs was verified by restriction mapping. Restriction digests, ligations, and other recombinant DNA methods were carried out using standard protocols (35Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar).Figure 1Structural organization of CAD. CAD is a 243-kDa polypeptide consisting of amidotransferase (GLN), carbamyl-phosphate synthetase (CPS.A and CPS.B), aspartate transcarbamylase (ATC), and dihydroorotase (DHO) domains. The GLN and CPS domains, which act in concert to catalyze the synthesis of carbamyl phosphate using glutamine as a nitrogen donor, are connected by a 29-residue linker or chain segment (GC lnk). The recombinant proteins used in this study are as follows: CAD; CPSase (GLN-CPS), in which the GLN and CPS domains are connected by the GC linker; and the deletion mutants CADΔGClnk and GLN-CPSΔGClnk, in which the linker is deleted and the GLN and CPS domains are directly fused.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 2Construction of the CAD deletion mutants.

The resulting 7.8-kilobase (kb) plasmid, pHL1ΔGClnk, contained a 4263-base pair cDNA fragment encoding the entire GLN and CPS domains, but lacked the connecting chain segment (GC lnk). In the construct, the restriction site for AvrII was regenerated, whereas that of SmaI was destroyed. Moreover, an additional 12 base pairs beyond the end of the linker region, as defined by sequence homology (23Simmer J.P. Kelly R.E. Rinker Jr., A.G. Scully J.L. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10395-10402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were removed from the 5′-end of the CPS-coding sequence. An 11.4-kilobase plasmid, pCKΔGClnk, which encodes the full-length mammalian protein without the GC linker was constructed by inserting the 3.7-kilobase XbaI fragment of pCAD142 into the XbaI site of pHL1ΔGClnk after the 5′-phosphate groups, had been removed with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIP).

DNA Cloning: A Practical Approach.in: Glover D.M. IRL Press, New York1985Google Scholar) into E. coli strains L673 and RC50, uridine auxotrophs that lack the E. coli carA andcarB genes encoding the CPSase subunits. Cells transformed with pHG-GLNGClnk were unable to grow on minimal medium (see Table I). In contrast, transformation with pHL1, which encodes the entire mammalian GLN-CPS protein, fully complemented the E. colidefect, whereas the pHL1ΔGClnk and pCKΔGClnk transformants grew more vigorously than cells expressing the wild-type proteins. Western blotting and measurements of the CPSase activity in extracts of the transformants showed that the level of expression of all of the recombinants was low. The proteins were partially purified by growing 100-ml cultures (37Guy H.I. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7702-7708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of the transformed L673 cells for 20 h. The cells were harvested; resuspended to a final volume of 1 ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol; and broken by sonication. The extracts were then centrifuged at high speed (16,000 ×g) for 20 min, and the supernatant fraction was passed over a Sephadex G-50 column equilibrated in the same buffer. The concentration of the recombinant proteins was determined by analysis of 0.05-ml aliquots by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Table IComplementation of E. coli car AB mutant L673PlasmidProteinGrowthNoneNonepHG-GLNGClnkGLN-GClnk−pHL1GLN-CPS++PHL1ΔGClnkGLN-CPSΔGClnk+++pCKCAD10CAD++pCKΔGClnkCADΔGClnk+++ Open table in a new tab Native CAD was isolated (20Coleman P.F.

Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford dye binding method (39Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217370) Google Scholar). The concentration of CAD and CAD constructs was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (40Grayson D.R. Lee L. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15840-15849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using CAD-specific antiserum. CAD concentrations determined by these two method were comparable. SDS-gel electrophoresis was carried out on 10% polyacrylamide gels using the procedure of Laemmli (41Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207472) Google Scholar), and the proteins were either stained or electroblotted onto nitrocellulose for immunoblotting (40Grayson D.R. Lee L. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15840-15849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using CAD antibodies. The CPSase activity of the partially purified proteins was assayed at 37 °C by a radiometric procedure (42Grayson D.R. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 4123-4129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Mally M.I. Grayson D.R. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11372-11380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Saturation curves were obtained using ATP, sodium bicarbonate, glutamine, and ammonium chloride as the variable substrate. Assays were carried out in the sonication buffer supplemented with 25 mm MgCl2. When fixed, the concentrations of ATP, bicarbonate, and glutamine were held at 20, 5, and 3.5 mm, respectively. Nonlinear least-squares fitting of the saturation curves to the Michaelis-Menten equation was carried out using the program Scientist (MicroMath Scientific Software). Sequence analysis was performed using the Wisconsin Package; version 9.0, Genetics Computer Group (GCG), Madison, WI. The contiguous GLN and CPS domains of CAD (Fig. 1) span residues 1–1455 of the polypeptide. The CPS domain (residues 395–1455) is connected to the GLN domain (residues 1–365) by a 29-residue chain segment (GC linker) defined as the region of the polypeptide that is homologous to neither the GLN or CPS subunits of the monofunctional proteins. Two constructs were made as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Plasmid pHL1ΔGClnk encodes mammalian GLN-CPS lacking the GC linker. In this protein, GLN-CPSΔGClnk, the GLN domain is directly fused to the CPS domain. Plasmid pCKΔGClnk encodes CADΔGClnk, which is the entire CAD polypeptide with the GC linker deleted. Transformation of the recombinant plasmids into E. colistrains lacking CPSase was able to complement the defect (TableI), indicating that functional mammalian proteins were expressed. However, the level of expression was low, and attempts to purify the full-length mammalian proteins were unsuccessful. All assays were carried out using extracts prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the concentration of the mammalian proteins was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Assays of the glutamine- and ammonia-dependent CPSase activities of the recombinant proteins showed that the CPS component of CAD (GLN-CPS) catalyzed carbamyl phosphate synthesis with both nitrogen donors at a rate comparable to that observed with full-length CAD. However, removal of the GC linker had two unanticipated consequences in that 1) the rate of glutamine-dependent CPSase activity increased 10-fold, and 2) ammonia could no longer serve as a nitrogen donor. Very similar results were obtained with the full-length CAD deletion mutant. Enhanced stability of GLN-CPSΔGClnk relative to GLN-CPS as an explanation for the higher activity of the species lacking the GC linker was ruled out by measuring the activity of these two proteins during a 4-h incubation under the assay conditions. The kinetic parameters (Table II) of CAD and of the separately expressed CPSase component (GLN-CPS) were similar. Deletion of the GC linker from GLN-CPS did not appreciably alter theK m for glutamine and bicarbonate. While the ATP saturation curve did not conform to Michaelis-Menten kinetics because of apparent substrate inhibition (Fig. 3), the concentration of ATP that produced half-maximal activity was also close to the value obtained for the proteins that had the GC linker. However, the V max of the deletion mutant was appreciably higher than that of the wild-type proteins. The activation was especially apparent at low ATP concentrations, where, for example, at 1.5 mm ATP, the activity was 48-fold higher than that observed with intact CPSase. At saturating ATP, the activity of the deletion mutant was still 16-fold higher despite significant substrate inhibition. Similarly, saturation curves using glutamine or bicarbonate as the variable substrate and saturating ATP gaveV max values that were 10.0- and 11.2-fold higher, respectively, than the CPSase molecule that had the GC linker. Moreover, saturation curves obtained with ammonium chloride as a variable substrate showed that the ammonia-dependent CPSase activity of the protein lacking the GC linker was effectively abolished even at 100 mm, the highest concentration of ammonium chloride tested. Thus, removal of the GC linker yielded a functional CPSase that could efficiently utilize ammonia produced endogenously by the GLN domain, but not exogenously supplied ammonia.Table IISteady-state kinetic parametersProteinVariable substrateK mVmaxmmμmol/min/mgCADATP0.52 ± 0.030.133 ± 0.002Bicarbonate2.09 ± 0.220.206 ± 0.007Glutamine0.09 ± 0.020.180 ± 0.006Ammonium chloride15.2 ± 1.150.263 ± 0.005GLN-CPSATP0.85 ± 0.060.158 ± 0.003Bicarbonate2.59 ± 0.210.323 ± 0.009Glutamine0.11 ± 0.020.254 ± 0.008Ammonium chloride21.8 ± 3.330.287 ± 0.013GLN-CPSΔGClnkATP2-aThese parameters were obtained by visual inspection of the curve in Fig. 3.

Open table in a new tab UTP inhibited the activity of the GLN-CPSΔGClnk deletion mutant to the same extent (Fig.4) as the CAD or GLN-CPS activity. However, the deletion mutant was no longer sensitive to the allosteric activator PRPP under conditions in which the intact proteins are activated 170%. Although we have shown (44Liu X. Guy H.I. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27747-27755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that the allosteric sites that bind UTP and PRPP are localized at the extreme carboxyl-terminal end of the CPS domain (B3), it could be argued that the GC linker may somehow be essential for PRPP binding. To test this possibility, the effect of PRPP on the glutamine-dependent CPSase activity of the mutant was measured (Fig. 5) in the presence of 8 mmUTP. Under these conditions, the response of the deletion mutant to PRPP was similar to that observed for CAD and intact CPSase. All three proteins were inhibited at low PRPP concentrations, but were activated up to 200% as the concentration of PRPP was increased. This result clearly showed that PRPP binds to the deletion mutant.Figure 5Effect of PRPP on the UTP inhibition of the GLN-CPSΔGClnk deletion mutant. The effect of increasing concentrations of PRPP on the deletion mutant GLN-CPSΔGClnk (•), the corresponding protein with an intact GC linker (○), and a comparable amount of purified mammalian CAD (▪) was measured in the presence of 8 mm UTP as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Note that all of these proteins were inhibited ∼50% by UTP in the absence of PRPP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether specific residues or a sequence of residues within the linker interferes directly with the biosynthetic reaction, the mammalian GLN domain was recloned (see “Experimental Procedures”) with the GC linker attached. GLN-GClnk was expressed at moderate levels (1–2% of the total soluble protein) and could be readily isolated in nearly homogeneous form in a single step by chromatography on a DEAE-Sephacyl column. We have found (37Guy H.I. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7702-7708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that the mammalian GLN domain forms a fully functional 1:1 stoichiometric hybrid complex with the large subunit of E. coli CPSase. If the mammalian GC linker interferes with the synthesis of carbamyl phosphate, then a hybrid consisting of the mammalian GLN domain with the linker attached and theE. coli CPS subunit might be expected to have an impaired function. The glutamine saturation curve (not shown) of a stoichiometric mixture of purified GLN-GClnk and the purified large subunit of E. coli CPSase showed that the glutamine-dependent CPSase activity had been restored, and therefore, a functional hybrid complex was formed. TheK m was essentially the same, but theV max was reduced by 3-fold compared with the hybrid formed without the linker. Carbamyl phosphate synthesis involves a fascinating series of parallel and consecutive reactions (7–9,12–14) that occur on different domains and subdomains (21Trotta P.P. Burt M.E. Haschemeyer R.H. Meister A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 2599-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 45Trotta P.P. Pinkus L.M. Haschemeyer R.H. Meister A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1990; 265: 7742-7747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and require precise coordination. One of the most interesting aspects of the mechanism is that two of the intermediates initially formed are very labile (3Meister A. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1989; 62: 315-374PubMed Google Scholar) and thus must be sequestered within the complex. Carboxy phosphate has a half-life of only a few seconds in aqueous solution, whereas ammonia, if released from the complex, would be rapidly protonated. On the other hand, ammonia can serve as a nitrogen donor in the absence of glutamine, suggesting that the ammonia-binding site must be accessible to the aqueous milieu at some point during the catalytic cycle. The ammonia-binding site is known to be located on the synthetase domain or subunit since the isolated E. coli CPS subunit can catalyze the ammonia-dependent reaction (21Trotta P.P. Burt M.E. Haschemeyer R.H. Meister A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 2599-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 45Trotta P.P. Pinkus L.M. Haschemeyer R.H. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 492-499Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further evidence of ammonia sequestration is provided by measurements of the stoichiometry of the overall reaction, which showed that 1 mol of glutamine is hydrolyzed per mol of carbamyl phosphate synthesized, indicating that the ammonia generated in situ does not escape from the complex. The effect of ammonia on the glutaminase activity of CAD (47Chaparian M.G. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3387-3395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is interesting in this regard. In the absence of ATP and bicarbonate, ammonia can completely inhibit glutamine hydrolysis, in accordance with the principle of microscopic reversibility. Thus, ammonia has access to the active site on the GLN domain, either directly in the same way as glutamine or indirectly via the NH3-binding site on the CPS domain. The same measurements made in the presence of saturating bicarbonate and ATP suggest that ammonia is entering the complex by way of its binding site on the CPS domain. In the presence of these substrates, ammonium chloride no longer completely inhibits the CAD glutaminase activity, suggesting that access to the ammonia-binding site on the CPS domain is restricted. The implication of these results is that CPSase exists in two conformational states which differ in that the ammonia site is either sequestered within the complex or accessible to the solvent. These conformational changes may well involve changes in the juxtaposition of the GLN and CPS domains as well as intradomain changes in tertiary structure. If the GLN and CPS domains are separate subunits, as is the case with the E. coli enzyme, there would be no constraints on the relative movement of the domains. However, if the GLN and CPS domains are part of the same polypeptide chain, as occurs in CAD, then one would expect that the domains would be connected by a linker that was long enough and flexible enough to accommodate any changes in quaternary structure that may occur. The linker between the GLN and CPS domains in CAD is 29 amino acids long (23Simmer J.P. Kelly R.E. Rinker Jr., A.G. Scully J.L. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10395-10402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 60Maley J.A. Davidson J.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 154: 1047-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). An analysis of the sequence of other fused CPSases (Fig.6) showed that all of these complexes have a GC linker ranging in length from 24 residues in the Dictyosteliumprotein to 29 residues in CAD, Drosophila, and yeast. Even mammalian CPSase I, which has a nonfunctional GLN domain, has a 26-residue linker. It is notable that there is little or no sequence similarity between the GC linkers even among proteins from closely related species, although all are uniformly flexible throughout their entire length. Secondary structure predictions revealed no consistent patterns. The CAD GC linker has a highly hydrophobic segment (Fig. 6), residues 15–23, that is flanked by hydrophilic regions. Despite the presence of these hydrophilic segments and potential target sites for trypsin, the GC linker is very resistant to proteolytic cleavage (48Kim H. Kelly R.E. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7177-7184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and thus may be buried at the interface between the domains. While the hydropathic profiles of the Drosophila and CPSase I GC linkers are somewhat similar, this feature is not universal since theDictyostelium linker is largely hydrophilic, whereas the corresponding segment of the yeast protein is hydrophobic. The similar length and lack of sequence conservation are consistent with the proposed role of the GC linker as a spacer. We found here that deletion of the linker and direct fusion of the GLN and CPS domains dramatically alter the catalytic and regulatory properties of the mammalian enzyme. Contrary to our expectations when these experiments were planned, neither the channeling of ammonia nor the ability to utilize glutamine as a nitrogen donor was disrupted. Rather, glutamine-dependent CPSase was activated, and the entry of exogenous ammonia to the binding site on the CPS domain was completely blocked. Activation involves a 10–16-fold increase ink cat, with no apparent effect on theK m for any of the substrates. Despite the 3-fold reduction in V max of the CPS-GLN-GClnk hybrid, we do not believe that direct interactions between the linker and the synthetase domain that suppress catalytic activity account for the activation that occurs upon deletion of the linker. First, the effect is appreciably smaller than the observed 10–16-fold activation. Second, the hybrid does not faithfully mimic the native multidomain protein since the linker is only tethered at one end. Third, a multidomain protein created (29Kern C.B. Lusty C.J. Davidson J.N. J. Mol. Evol. 1992; 35: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) using the mammalian GC linker to connect the E. coli GLN and CPS subunits had normal catalytic activity, suggesting that no unfavorable interactions occur. Finally, direct fusion of the GLN and CPS subunits of E. coli CPSase (49Guy H.I. Rotgeri A. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19913-19918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), which naturally lacks the GC linker, results in a comparable activation. These results can be explained by a model (Fig. 7) that assumes that the complex exists in two different conformations during the catalytic cycle. One conformation is an open, substrate-binding state in which the ammonia site on the CPS domain is accessible, but the configuration of the active-site residues is not optimal. In the second closed, catalytically active conformational state, access to the ammonia-binding site is restricted, but the active-site residues have assumed the proper juxtaposition to promote efficient catalysis. This interpretation is consistent with previous studies of E. coli CPSase. Chemical modification and binding studies of the bacterial enzyme (50Matthews S.L. Anderson P.M. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 1176-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 51Anderson P.M. Carlson J.D. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 3688-3694Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) revealed the existence of several different conformational states and led to the formulation of a model in which the binding of substrates to one conformational state promotes the transition to a catalytically active form of the enzyme. Moreover, the binding of ATP and bicarbonate to both the E. coli (5Anderson P.M. Meister A. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 3157-3163Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and mammalian (47Chaparian M.G. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3387-3395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) CPSases appreciably enhances the glutaminase activity. Conversely, modification of the active site on the GLN subunit ofE. coli CPSase (51Anderson P.M. Carlson J.D. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 3688-3694Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 52Khedouri E. Anderson P.M. Meister A. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 3552-3557Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 53Pinkus L.M. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 6119-6127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) stimulates the activity of the CPS subunit. These observations may reflect the transition to the catalytically active conformation upon substrate binding. The conformational change is postulated to occur following the binding of ATP and bicarbonate to the CPS domain and the binding of either glutamine to the GLN domain or NH3 to the CPS domain. Once the enzyme has assumed the catalytically active conformation, the ammonia produced in situ from glutamine is efficiently channeled to the CPS domain and cannot escape from the complex since the ammonia-binding site on the CPS domain is no longer accessible to the solvent. Similarly, in the case of the ammonia-dependent reaction, the ammonia is sequestered within the complex in the catalytically active conformation. According to this model, deletion of the GC linker introduces constraints that in effect trap the molecule in the catalytic conformation. Access to exogenous ammonia is restricted, but glutamine can still bind since its site on the GLN domain is distinct from the ammonia-binding site on the CPS domain. ATP and bicarbonate can also bind to both conformations. Pre-steady-state kinetic and isotope exchange measurements (13Raushel F.M. Villafranca J.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 3424-3429Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) have shown that the activation of bicarbonate is the rate-limiting step in the overall synthesis of carbamyl phosphate. It is possible that the transition from the open inactive conformation to the catalytically active conformation, an essential element of this partial reaction in the proposed model, is the slowest step. In that event, bypassing this conformational transition could account for the observed activation of the deletion mutant. An equilibrium between an active and inactive conformation could provide an alternative, but perhaps less likely, explanation of these results. In this mechanism, the activity of the complex reflects the population of these two states, and substrate binding stabilizes the catalytically active conformation. Deletion of the GC linker also alters the allosteric regulation of the enzyme. Whereas UTP inhibits the deletion mutant normally, PRPP activation is abolished. PRPP binds to a regulatory subdomain at the extreme carboxyl-terminal end of the CPS domain of CAD (44Liu X. Guy H.I. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27747-27755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but deletion of the linker could introduce structural changes that interfere with PRPP binding. For example, there is some evidence (54McCudden C.R. Powers-Lee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18285-18294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) that the inactive GLN domain of mitochondrial CPSase I may be close to the binding site of the allosteric activator N-acetyl glutamate. However, the observation that the same concentration of PRPP reverses UTP inhibition to a comparable extent in the deletion mutant and wild-type enzyme suggests that PRPP binds with nearly the same affinity to the deletion mutant. Although PRPP cannot further stimulate the CPSase activity of the protein activated by deletion of the GC linker, the conformations of these two activated forms of the enzyme are probably distinct. PRPP activates by decreasing theK m for ATP, but has no effect onk cat. In contrast, thek cat of the deletion mutant is appreciably higher, but ATP binding is unaltered. Moreover, the inhibited conformation of the enzyme induced by UTP is still accessible in the deletion mutant, and PRPP can reverse this allosteric transition. In summary, we conclude that the GC linker in CAD and other multifunctional biosynthetic complexes allows the GLN and CPS domains to assume two distinctly different conformational states that are an essential part of the catalytic cycle.

Chem. 1997; 272: 19913-19918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), describing studies of an E. coli CPSase fusion protein, suggests a possible functional advantage of these conformational changes.
