https://openalex.org/W4213458101,"Molecular profiling of small molecules offers invaluable insights into the function of compounds and allows for hypothesis generation about small-molecule direct targets and secondary effects. However, current profiling methods are limited in either the number of measurable parameters or throughput. Here we developed a multiplexed, unbiased framework that, by linking genetic to drug-induced changes in nearly a thousand metabolites, allows for high-throughput functional annotation of compound libraries in Escherichia coli. First, we generated a reference map of metabolic changes from CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) with 352 genes in all major essential biological processes. Next, on the basis of the comparison of genetic changes with 1,342 drug-induced metabolic changes, we made de novo predictions of compound functionality and revealed antibacterials with unconventional modes of action (MoAs). We show that our framework, combining dynamic gene silencing with metabolomics, can be adapted as a general strategy for comprehensive high-throughput analysis of compound functionality from bacteria to human cell lines."

Mutational signatures show the anti-viral apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide (APOBEC) enzymes are responsible for the preponderance of mutations in bladder tumour genomes, but no causative viral agent has been identified. BK polyomavirus (BKPyV) is a common childhood infection that remains latent in the adult kidney, where reactivation leads to viruria. This study provides missing mechanistic evidence linking reactivated BKPyV-infection to bladder cancer risk. We used a mitotically-quiescent, functionally-differentiated model of normal human urothelium to examine BKPyV-infection. BKPyV-infection led to significantly elevated APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B protein, increased deaminase activity and greater numbers of apurinic/apyrimidinic sites in the host urothelial genome. BKPyV Large T antigen (LT-Ag) stimulated re-entry from G0 into the cell cycle through inhibition of retinoblastoma protein and activation of EZH2, E2F1 and FOXM1, with cells arresting in G2. The single-stranded DNA displacement loops formed in urothelial cells during BKPyV-infection interacted with LT-Ag to provide a substrate for APOBEC3-activity. Addition of interferon gamma (IFNγ) to infected urothelium suppressed expression of the viral genome. These results support reactivated BKPyV infections in adults as a risk factor for bladder cancer in immune-insufficient populations."

The study aims to analyze the association of this stigma with the mental health and quality of life of COVID-19 survivors.In this cross-sectional study, we observed 547 adults who were previously documented as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) positive by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, treated in a hospital or an emergency hospital and proven to be SARS-CoV-2 negative by their latest PCR test. We adopted the Berger HIV Stigma Scale to measure stigma; the World Health Organization Quality of Life Brief Form to measure quality of life; and the Mental Health Inventory-38 to measure mental health. The chi-square and binary logistic regression tests were used to find the correlation between the variables.The multivariate analysis revealed that medium stigma was more likely related to quality of life and mental health than low stigma. Females were less likely to experience stigma related to mental health than men, and respondents who worked as laborers and entrepreneurs were less likely to experience stigma related to mental health than those who worked as civil workers/army personnel/teachers/lecturers. COVID-19 survivors experienced medium stigma in society and lower quality of life and mental health status. We found that quality of life and mental health were affected by stigma, sex, and occupation.COVID-19 survivors are a vulnerable group that is most at risk when they return to their communities. Creating a safe environment and providing respectful care, including addressing complex stigma factors, is vital for developing appropriate interventions."
https://openalex.org/W4212949658,"One of the most important applications of statistical analysis is in health research and applications. Cancer studies are mostly required special statistical considerations in order to find the appropriate model for fitting the survival data. Existing classical distributions rarely fit such data well and an increasing interest has been shown recently in developing more flexible distributions by introducing some additional parameters to the basic model. In this paper, a new five-parameters distribution referred as alpha power Kumaraswamy Weibull distribution is introduced and studied. Particularly, this distribution extends the Weibull distribution based on a novel technique that combines two well known generalisation methods, namely, alpha power and T-X transformations. Different characteristics of the proposed distribution, including moments, quantiles, Rényi entropy and order statistics are obtained. The method of maximum likelihood is applied in order to estimate the model parameters based on complete and censored data. The performance of these estimators are examined via conducting some simulation studies. The potential importance and applicability of the proposed distribution is illustrated empirically by means of six datasets that describe the survival of some cancer patients. The results of the analysis indicated to the promising performance of the alpha power Kumaraswamy Weibull distribution in practice comparing to some other competing distributions."
https://openalex.org/W4226178615,"Promoting the thermogenic function of brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a promising strategy to combat obesity and metabolic disorders. While much is known about the transcriptional regulation of BAT activation, however, the underlying mechanism of post-transcriptional control by RNA binding proteins remains largely unknown. Here, we found that RNA binding protein Y-box binding protein 1 (YBX1) expression was abundant in BAT and induced by cold exposure and a β-adrenergic agonist in mice. Loss-of-function experiments showed that YBX1 deficiency inhibited mouse primary brown adipocyte differentiation and thermogenic function. Further study showed that YBX1 positively regulates thermogenesis through enhancing mitophagy. Mechanistically, RNA immunoprecipitation identified that YBX1 directly targeted the transcripts of PTEN-induced kinase 1 (Pink1) and parkin RBR E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase (Prkn), two key regulators of mitophagy. RNA decay assay proved that loss of YBX1 decreased mRNA stability of Pink1 and Prkn, leading to reduced protein expression, thereby alleviating mitophagy and inhibiting thermogenic program. Importantly, in vivo experiments demonstrated that YBX1 overexpression in BAT promoted thermogenesis and mitophagy in mice. Collectively, our results reveal novel insight into the molecular mechanism of YBX1 in post-transcriptional regulation of PINK1/PRKN-mediated mitophagy and highlight the critical role of YBX1 in brown adipogenesis and thermogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W4213237113,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, affect several million individuals worldwide. These diseases are heterogeneous at the clinical, immunological and genetic levels and result from complex host and environmental interactions. Investigating drug efficacy for IBD can improve our understanding of why treatment response can vary between patients. We propose an explainable machine learning (ML) approach that combines bioinformatics and domain insight, to integrate multi-modal data and predict inter-patient variation in drug response. Using explanation of our models, we interpret the ML models' predictions to infer unique combinations of important features associated with pharmacological responses obtained during preclinical testing of drug candidates in ex vivo patient-derived fresh tissues. Our inferred multi-modal features that are predictive of drug efficacy include multi-omic data (genomic and transcriptomic), demographic, medicinal and pharmacological data. Our aim is to understand variation in patient responses before a drug candidate moves forward to clinical trials. As a pharmacological measure of drug efficacy, we measured the reduction in the release of the inflammatory cytokine TNFα from the fresh IBD tissues in the presence/absence of test drugs. We initially explored the effects of a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor; however, we later showed our approach can be applied to other targets, test drugs or mechanisms of interest. Our best model predicted TNFα levels from demographic, medicinal and genomic features with an error of only 4.98% on unseen patients. We incorporated transcriptomic data to validate insights from genomic features. Our results showed variations in drug effectiveness (measured by ex vivo assays) between patients that differed in gender, age or condition and linked new genetic polymorphisms to patient response variation to the anti-inflammatory treatment BIRB796 (Doramapimod). Our approach models IBD drug response while also identifying its most predictive features as part of a transparent ML precision medicine strategy."
https://openalex.org/W4213418224,"Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive disease, with patients diagnosed with either early-stage, limited stage, or extensive stage of SCLC tumor progression. Discovering and targeting the functional biomarkers for SCLC will be crucial in understanding the molecular basis underlying SCLC tumorigenesis to better assist in improving clinical treatment. Emerging studies have demonstrated that dysregulations in BAP1 histone H2A deubiquitinase complex are collectively associated with pathogenesis in human SCLC. Here, we investigated the function of the oncogenic BAP1/ASXL3/BRD4 epigenetic axis in SCLC by developing a next-generation BAP1 inhibitor, iBAP-II, and focusing on the epigenetic balance established between BAP1 and non-canonical PRC1 complexes in regulating SCLC-specific transcriptional programming. We further demonstrated that pharmacologic inhibition of BAP1's catalytic activity disrupted BAP1/ASXL3/BRD4 epigenetic axis by inducing protein degradation of the ASXL3 scaffold protein, which bridges BRD4 and BAP1 at active enhancers. Furthermore, treatment of iBAP-II represses neuroendocrine lineage-specific ASCL1/MYCL/E2F signaling in SCLC cell lines, and dramatically inhibits SCLC cell viability and tumor growth in vivo. In summary, this study has provided mechanistic insight into the oncogenic function of BAP1 in SCLC and highlighted the potential of targeting BAP1's activity as a novel SCLC therapy."
https://openalex.org/W4212958372,"Populations seem to respond differently to the global pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Recent studies show individual variability in both susceptibility and clinical response to COVID-19 infection. People with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) constitute one of COVID-19 risk groups, being already associated with a poor prognosis upon infection. This study aims contributing to unveil the underlying reasons for such prognosis in people with COPD and the variability in the response observed across worldwide populations, by looking at the genetic background as a possible answer to COVID-19 infection response heterogeneity.SNPs already associated with susceptibility to COVID-19 infection (rs286914 and rs12329760) and severe COVID-19 with respiratory failure (rs657152 and rs11385942) were assessed and their allelic frequencies used to calculate the probability of having multiple risk alleles. This was performed on a Portuguese case-control COPD cohort, previously clinically characterized and genotyped from saliva samples, and also on worldwide populations (European, Spanish, Italian, African, American and Asian), using publicly available frequencies data. A polygenic risk analysis was also conducted on the Portuguese COPD cohort for the two mentioned phenotypes, and also for hospitalization and survival to COVID-19 infection.No differences in genetic risk for COVID-19 susceptibility, hospitalization, severity or survival were found between people with COPD and the control group (all p-values > 0.01), either considering risk alleles individually, allelic combinations or polygenic risk scores. All populations, even those with European ancestry (Portuguese, Spanish and Italian), showed significant differences from the European population in genetic risk for both COVID-19 susceptibility and severity (all p-values < 0.0001).Our results indicate a low genetic contribution for COVID-19 infection predisposition or worse outcomes observed in people with COPD. Also, our study unveiled a high genetic heterogeneity across major world populations for the same alleles, even within European sub-populations, demonstrating the need to build a higher resolution European genetic map, so that differences in the distribution of relevant alleles can be easily accessed and used to better manage diseases, ultimately, safeguarding populations with higher genetic predisposition to such diseases."
https://openalex.org/W4213246077,"Lead is one of ten hazardous chemicals of public health concern and is used in more than 900 occupations, including the battery, smelting, and mining industries. Lead toxicity accounts for 1.5% (900,000) of deaths annually in the world. In Indonesia, reports of high Blood Lead Level (BLL) were associated with residency in Used Lead Acid Battery (ULAB) recycling sites. The present study aims to investigate the BLL and the evidence of lead toxicity of children living in an ULAB recycling site in Bogor Regency, Indonesia. A cross-sectional study involving 128 children aged 1-5 years was conducted in September-October 2019. The socio-economic factors, BLL, nutritional status, and hematological parameters, were evaluated. Data were analyzed by univariate and bivariate using the Chi-Square test. Socio-economic factors revealed only 2.3% children have pica and 10.9% children have hand-to-mouth habits. Majority of parents had low income, education, and have stayed in the village for years. Analysis on BLL revealed that 69.5% children had BLL of >10 μg/dL, 25% had abnormal BMI, 23.4% had underweight, 53.9% had stunting, 33.6% had anemia, and 22.6% had basophilic stippling. The average BLL and hemoglobin levels of respondents were 17.03 μg/dL and 11.48 g/dL, respectively. Bivariate analysis revealed that children with high BLL had double risk of having underweight and protected from stunting. Analysis on the association between BLL and BMI for age revealed a higher risk to have abnormal BMI. The high BLL also had 1.017 times risk of developing anemia, and almost doubled risk of having basophilic stippling, although they were not statistically significant. In conclusion, the high BLL of children living in the ULAB recycling indicates that lead exposure as well as lead toxicity are still occurring in Cinangka Village, and alerts to the need for a systematic action to mitigate the exposure."
https://openalex.org/W4213109720,"Tuberculosis (Tuberculosis, TB) is a public health problem in China, which not only endangers the population's health but also affects economic and social development. It requires an accurate prediction analysis to help to make policymakers with early warning and provide effective precautionary measures. In this study, ARIMA, GM(1,1), and LSTM models were constructed and compared, respectively. The results showed that the LSTM was the optimal model, which can be achieved satisfactory performance for TB cases predictions in mainland China.The data of tuberculosis cases in mainland China were extracted from the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China website. According to the TB data characteristics and the sample requirements, we created the ARIMA, GM(1,1), and LSTM models, which can make predictions for the prevalence trend of TB. The mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) were applied to evaluate the effects of model fitting predicting accuracy.There were 3,021,995 tuberculosis cases in mainland China from January 2018 to December 2020. And the overall TB cases in mainland China take on a downtrend trend. We established ARIMA, GM(1,1), and LSTM models, respectively. The optimal ARIMA model is the ARIMA (0,1,0) × (0,1,0)12. The equation for GM(1,1) model was X(k+1) = -10057053.55e(-0.01k) + 10153178.55 the Mean square deviation ratio C value was 0.49, and the Small probability of error P was 0.94. LSTM model consists of an input layer, a hidden layer and an output layer, the parameters of epochs, learning rating are 60, 0.01, respectively. The MAE, RMSE, and MAPE values of LSTM model were smaller than that of GM(1,1) and ARIMA models.Our findings showed that the LSTM model was the optimal model, which has a higher accuracy performance than that of ARIMA and GM (1,1) models. Its prediction results can act as a predictive tool for TB prevention measures in mainland China."
https://openalex.org/W4213355817,"The metabolic syndrome (MetS) has become a global public health burden due to its link to cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus. The present study was designed to characterize the metabolic and cardiovascular disturbances, as well as changes in gut microbiota associated with high-fructose high-fat diet (HFFD)-induced MetS in Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbits. Twenty-one Watanabe rabbits were assigned to a control (n = 9) and HFFD (n = 12) groups, receiving a chow diet and a HFFD, respectively. During a 12-weeks protocol, morphological parameters were monitored; plasma fasting levels of lipids, glucose and insulin were measured and a glucose tolerance test (GTT) was performed. HOMA-IR was calculated. Cardiac function and vascular reactivity were evaluated using the Langendorff isolated heart and isolated carotid arteries methods, respectively. 16S rRNA sequencing of stool samples was used to determine gut microbial composition and abundance. HFFD-fed Watanabe rabbits exhibited increased fasting insulin (p < 0.03, 12th week vs. Baseline), HOMA-IR (p < 0.03 vs. Control), area under the curve of the GTT (p < 0.02 vs. Control), triglycerides (p < 0.05, 12th week vs. Baseline), TC (p < 0.01 vs. Control), LDL-C (p < 0.001 vs. Control). The HFFD group also displayed a significant decrease in intestinal microbial richness, evenness and diversity (FDR < 0.001, FDR < 0.0001, FDR < 0.01, respectively vs. Control group) and an increase in its Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio (R = 3.39 in control vs. R = 28.24 in the HFFD group) indicating a shift in intestinal microbial composition and diversity. Our results suggest that HFFD induces insulin resistance and gut microbiota dysbiosis and accentuates dyslipidemia; and that, when subjected to HFFD, Watanabe rabbits might become a potential diet-induced MetS animal models with two main features, dyslipidemia and insulin resistance."
https://openalex.org/W4213430412,"Despite rising cases of COVID-19 in the United States of America, several states are easing restrictions (e.g., relaxing physical distancing requirements, reopening businesses) that were imposed to limit community transmission of the virus. Individuals hold differing opinions regarding whether restrictions should continue to be imposed or lifted, evidenced, for example, by debate and protests regarding reopening of businesses and venues. Health and social psychological research suggest that perceptions of COVID-19related risk, experiences of the virus, and individual difference factors can help explain individuals’ attitudes towards health initiatives and their tendency to be persuaded towards a specific course of action. The purpose of this study was to investigate what factors influence support or opposition to easing COVID-19-related restrictions. A sample of 350 United States citizens, responding to an anonymous survey, were asked about the extent to which they support/oppose easing of COVID-19-related restrictions, both generally and in relation to specific restrictions. Respondents completed measures of their experiences of COVID-19, individual difference factors, and demographic variables, including political affiliation and degree of social and economic conservatism. In a series of regression analyses, significant demographic predictors of support or opposition for easing restrictions were gender, age, ethnicity, and education, with political affiliation and degree of social and economic conservatism also predicting attitudes. Experiences related to COVID-19 that predicted attitudes were concerns for self and family, perceptions of threat posed by the virus, perceived ability to adhere to restrictions, willingness to take government direction, and belief in COVID-19-related conspiracy theories. At an individual differences level, uncertainty avoidance, collectivism, long-term orientation, masculinity, empathic concern, personal distress, reactance, and general conspiracy theory beliefs all significantly precited attitudes to easing restrictions. Understanding the factors that help explain attitudes towards COVID-19 restrictions can inform how best to position health messaging and initiatives going forward, particularly as states or countries open borders."
https://openalex.org/W4225685295,"Antibiotic resistant bacterial pathogens are increasingly prevalent, driving the need for alternative approaches to chemical antibiotics when treating infections. One such approach is bacteriophage therapy: the use of bacteria-specific viruses that lyse (kill) their host cells. Just as the effect of environmental conditions (e.g. elevated temperature) on antibiotic efficacy is well-studied, the effect of environmental stressors on the potency of phage therapy candidates demands examination. Therapeutic phage OMKO1 infects and kills the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Here, we used phage OMKO1 as a model to test how environmental stressors can lead to damage and decay of virus particles. We assessed the effects of elevated temperatures, saline concentrations, and urea concentrations. We observed that OMKO1 particles were highly tolerant to different saline concentrations, but decayed more rapidly at elevated temperatures and under high concentrations of urea. Additionally, we found that exposure to elevated temperature reduced the ability of surviving phage particles to suppress the growth of P. aeruginosa, suggesting a temperature-induced damage. Our findings demonstrate that OMKO1 is highly tolerant to a range of conditions that could be experienced inside and outside the human body, while also showing the need for careful characterization of therapeutic phages to ensure that environmental exposure does not compromise their expected potency, dosing, and pharmacokinetics."
https://openalex.org/W4225921000,"A variety of islet autoantibodies (AAbs) can predict and possibly dictate eventual type 1 diabetes (T1D) diagnosis. Upwards of 75% of those with T1D are positive for AAbs against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65 or GAD), a producer of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in human pancreatic beta cells. Interestingly, bacterial populations within the human gut also express GAD and produce GABA. Evidence suggests that dysbiosis of the microbiome may correlate with T1D pathogenesis and physiology. Therefore, autoimmune linkages between the gut microbiome and islets susceptible to autoimmune attack need to be further elucidated. Utilizing in silico analyses, we show that 25 GAD sequences from human gut bacterial sources show sequence and motif similarities to human beta cell GAD65. Our motif analyses determined that most gut GAD sequences contain the pyroxical dependent decarboxylase (PDD) domain of human GAD65, which is important for its enzymatic activity. Additionally, we showed overlap with known human GAD65 T cell receptor epitopes, which may implicate the immune destruction of beta cells. Thus, we propose a physiological hypothesis in which changes in the gut microbiome in those with T1D result in a release of bacterial GAD, thus causing miseducation of the host immune system. Due to the notable similarities we found between human and bacterial GAD, these deputized immune cells may then target human beta cells leading to the development of T1D."

https://openalex.org/W4212957652,"Polypharmacy, defined as the concurrent use of ≥5 medications, increases the risk of drug-drug and drug-disease interactions as well as non-adherence to drug therapy. This may have negative health consequences particularly among older adults due to age-related pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes. This study aims to uncover the occurrence of polypharmacy among older adults in Denmark and investigate how polypharmacy relates to mortality.This nationwide register-based study included 1,338,058 adults aged 65+ years between January 2013 and December 2017 in Denmark. Polypharmacy prevalence was measured at time of inclusion while incidence and the association between polypharmacy and mortality were measured over the five-year follow-up using Cox regression. In an attempt to adjust for confounding by indication, propensity scores with overlap weighting were introduced to the regression model.At time of inclusion, polypharmacy prevalence was 29% and over the five years follow-up, 47% of the remaining adults transitioned into polypharmacy. Identified risk factors included multimorbidity (2+ morbidities: HR = 3.51; 95% CI = 3.48-3.53), age (95+ years: HR = 2.85; 95% CI = 2.74-2.96), socioeconomic factors (Highest income quartile: HR = 0.81; 95% CI = 0.80-0.81), region of birth region (Non-western migrants: HR = 0.77; 95% CI = 0.75-0.79), marital status (Divorced: HR = 1.10; 95% CI = 1.10-1.12) and year of inclusion (2017: HR = 1.19; 95% CI = 1.19-1.22). Further analyses showed that polypharmacy involves many different drug cocktails with medication for the cardiovascular system (95%), blood and blood-forming organs (69%), alimentary tract and metabolism (61%) and nervous system (54%) contributing the most. After adjustment for propensity scores with OW, both polypharmacy (HR = 3.48, CI95% = 3.41-3.54) and excessive polypharmacy (HR = 3.48, CI95% = 3.43-3.53) increased the risk of death substantially.A considerable proportion of older adults in Denmark were exposed to polypharmacy dependent on health status, socio-economic status, and societal factors. The associated three- to four-fold mortality risk indicate a need for further exploration of the appropriateness of polypharmacy among older adults."
https://openalex.org/W4213057455,"As ecosystems face disruption of community dynamics and habitat loss, the idea of determining ahead of time which species can become extinct is an important subject in conservation biology. A species' vulnerability to extinction is dependent upon both intrinsic (life-history strategies, genetics) and extrinsic factors (environment, anthropogenic threats). Studies linking intrinsic traits to extinction risk have shown variable results, and to our knowledge, there has not been a systematic analysis looking at how demographic patterns in stage-specific survival and reproductive rates correlate to extinction risk. We used matrix projection models from the COMPADRE and COMADRE matrix databases and IUCN Red List status as our proxy of extinction risk to investigate if some demographic patterns are more vulnerable to extinction than others. We obtained data on demographic rates, phylogeny, and IUCN status for 159 species of herbaceous plants, trees, mammals, and birds. We calculated 14 demographic metrics related to different aspects of life history and elasticity values and analyzed whether they differ based on IUCN categories using conditional random forest analysis and phylogenetic generalized least square regressions. We mapped all species within the database, both with IUCN assessment and without, and overlaid them with biodiversity hotspots to investigate if there is bias within the assessed species and how many of the non-assessed species could use the demographic information recorded in COMPADRE and COMADRE for future IUCN assessments. We found that herbaceous perennials are more vulnerable when they mature early and have high juvenile survival rates; birds are more vulnerable with high progressive growth and reproduction; mammals are more vulnerable when they have longer generation times. These patterns may be used to assess relative vulnerability across species when lacking abundance or trend data."
https://openalex.org/W4212820880,"This study examined the association between dog and cat ownership, the onset of disability and all-cause mortality in an older population. Dog and cat owners take more regular exercise and have closer social relationships than non-owners. We further assess the beneficial effects of these moderating variables on the onset of disability and mortality.Dog and cat ownership data were collected from 11233 community-dwelling adults age 65 years and older. These data were matched with data about the onset of disability held by the Japanese long-term care insurance system. Local registry data were used to ascertain all-cause mortality.During the approximately 3.5 year follow-up period, 17.1% of the sample suffered onset of disability, and 5.2% died. Logistic regression analysis indicated that, compared with a reference group of those who had never owned a dog (odds ratio fixed at 1.0), older adults who were currently dog owners had a significantly lower odds ratio of onset of disability (OR = 0.54 95% CI: 0.37-0.79). Our results further show that regular exercise interacts with dog ownership to reduce the risk of disability. The association of dog and/or cat ownership with all-cause mortality was not statistically significant.Dog ownership appears to protect against incident disability among older Japanese adults. Additional benefits are gained from ownership combined with regular exercise. Daily dog care may have an important role to play in health promotion and successful aging."
https://openalex.org/W4213371947,"The current study characterized subcortical speech sound processing among monolinguals and bilinguals in quiet and challenging listening conditions and examined the relation between subcortical neural processing and perceptual performance. A total of 59 normal-hearing adults, ages 19-35 years, participated in the study: 29 native Hebrew-speaking monolinguals and 30 Arabic-Hebrew-speaking bilinguals. Auditory brainstem responses to speech sounds were collected in a quiet condition and with background noise. The perception of words and sentences in quiet and background noise conditions was also examined to assess perceptual performance and to evaluate the perceptual-physiological relationship. Perceptual performance was tested among bilinguals in both languages (first language (L1-Arabic) and second language (L2-Hebrew)). The outcomes were similar between monolingual and bilingual groups in quiet. Noise, as expected, resulted in deterioration in perceptual and neural responses, which was reflected in lower accuracy in perceptual tasks compared to quiet, and in more prolonged latencies and diminished neural responses. However, a mixed picture was observed among bilinguals in perceptual and physiological outcomes in noise. In the perceptual measures, bilinguals were significantly less accurate than their monolingual counterparts. However, in neural responses, bilinguals demonstrated earlier peak latencies compared to monolinguals. Our results also showed that perceptual performance in noise was related to subcortical resilience to the disruption caused by background noise. Specifically, in noise, increased brainstem resistance (i.e., fewer changes in the fundamental frequency (F0) representations or fewer shifts in the neural timing) was related to better speech perception among bilinguals. Better perception in L1 in noise was correlated with fewer changes in F0 representations, and more accurate perception in L2 was related to minor shifts in auditory neural timing. This study delves into the importance of using neural brainstem responses to speech sounds to differentiate individuals with different language histories and to explain inter-subject variability in bilinguals' perceptual abilities in daily life situations."
https://openalex.org/W4213450839,"Background Using test, trace and isolate systems can help reduce the spread of COVID-19. Parents have the additional responsibility of using these systems for themselves and acting on behalf of their children to help control COVID-19. We explored factors associated with the use of England’s NHS Test and Trace service among parents of school-aged children. Methods One-to-one telephone interviews with parents (n = 18) of school-aged (4 to 18 years) children living in England between 30 November to 11 December 2020. Data were explored using thematic analysis. Results Three themes and eight sub-themes emerged. In terms of recognising symptoms of COVID-19, parents needed prompting before recalling the main symptoms described by the NHS. Parents suggested several factors relating to the nature of the symptom(s) and contextual information that might lead to or prevent them from seeking a test. Although parents supported symptomatic testing and described trusting official sources of information (e.g., Government and NHS websites). However, some concerns were raised regarding the accuracy of test results, safety at testing centres and logistics of testing but none of the concerns appeared to prevent engagement with testing. Parents perceived adherence to testing and self-isolation as pro-social behaviour, although family resources and circumstances impacted their ability to adhere fully. Conclusions Our study identified several barriers to parents using NHS Test and Trace as needed. Information about the eligibility of testing (main symptoms of COVID-19 and the age of eligibility) needs to be more precise and resources provided to enable families to adhere to self-isolation if the efficiency of test, trace and isolate systems is to be optimised."
https://openalex.org/W4225627308,"Metabolic dysfunction and insulin resistance are emerging as hallmarks of cancer and cachexia, and impair cancer prognosis. Yet, the molecular mechanisms underlying impaired metabolic regulation are not fully understood. To elucidate the mechanisms behind cancer-induced insulin resistance in muscle, we isolated extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and soleus muscles from Lewis Lung Carcinoma tumor-bearing mice. Three weeks after tumor inoculation, muscles were isolated and stimulated with or without a submaximal dose of insulin (1.5 nM). Glucose transport was measured using 2-[3 H]Deoxy-Glucose and intramyocellular signaling was investigated using immunoblotting. In soleus muscles from tumor-bearing mice, insulin-stimulated glucose transport was abrogated concomitantly with abolished insulin-induced TBC1D4 and GSK3 phosphorylation. In EDL, glucose transport and TBC1D4 phosphorylation were not impaired in muscles from tumor-bearing mice, while AMPK signaling was elevated. Anabolic insulin signaling via phosphorylation of the mTORC1 targets, p70S6K thr389, and ribosomal-S6 ser235, were decreased by cancer in soleus muscle while increased or unaffected in EDL. In contrast, the mTOR substrate, pULK1 ser757, was reduced in both soleus and EDL by cancer. Hence, cancer causes considerable changes in skeletal muscle insulin signaling that is dependent on muscle-type, which could contribute to metabolic dysregulation in cancer. Thus, the skeletal muscle could be a target for managing metabolic dysfunction in cancer."

We conducted an observational cohort study of patients aged 18 to 90 with COVID-19 requiring ventilatory support using TriNetX (COVID-19 Research Network) between January 20, 2020, and February 9, 2021. We compared patients who received at least 48 hours of CS-RDV combination therapy to CS monotherapy. The primary outcome was 28-day all-cause mortality rates in propensity-matched (PSM) cohorts. Secondary outcomes were Length of Stay (LOS), Secondary Bacterial Infections (SBI), and MRSA (Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus), and Pseudomonas infections. We used univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models and stratified log-rank tests. Of 388 patients included, 91 (23.5%) received CS-RDV therapy, and 297 (76.5%) received CS monotherapy. After propensity score matching, with 74 patients in each cohort, all-cause mortality was 36.4% and 29.7% in the CS-RDV and CS therapy, respectively (P = 0.38). We used a Kaplan-Meier with a log-rank test on follow up period (P = 0.23), and a Hazards Ratio model (P = 0.26). SBI incidence was higher in the CS group (13.5% vs. 35.1%, P = 0.02) with a similar LOS (13.4 days vs. 13.4 days, P = 1.00) and similar incidence of MRSA/Pseudomonas infections (13.5% vs. 13.5%, P = 1.00) in both the groups. Therefore, CS-RDV therapy is non-inferior to CS therapy in reducing 28-day all-cause in-hospital mortality but associated with a significant decrease in the incidence of SBI in critically ill COVID-19 patients."
https://openalex.org/W4213413667,"Although soil organisms are essential for ecosystem function, the impacts of radiation on soil biological activity at highly contaminated sites has been relatively poorly studied. In April-May 2016, we conducted the first largescale deployment of bait lamina to estimate soil organism (largely soil invertebrate) feeding activity in situ at study plots in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone (CEZ). Across our 53 study plots, estimated weighted absorbed dose rates to soil organisms ranged from 0.7 μGy h-1 to 1753 μGy h-1. There was no significant relationship between soil organism feeding activity and estimated weighted absorbed dose rate. Soil biological activity did show significant relationships with soil moisture content, bulk density (used as a proxy for soil organic matter) and pH. At plots in the Red Forest (an area of coniferous plantation where trees died because of high radiation exposure in 1986) soil biological activity was low compared to plots elsewhere in the CEZ. It is possible that the lower biological activity observed in the Red Forest is a residual consequence of what was in effect an acute high exposure to radiation in 1986."
https://openalex.org/W4220998489,"High-risk solid tumors continue to pose a tremendous therapeutic challenge due to multidrug resistance. Biological mechanisms driving chemoresistance in high-risk primary and recurrent disease are distinct: in newly diagnosed patients, non-response to therapy is often associated with a higher level of tumor “stemness” paralleled by overexpression of the ABCG2 drug efflux pump, whereas in tumors relapsing after non-curative therapy, poor drug sensitivity is most commonly linked to the dysfunction of the tumor suppressor protein, p53. In this study, we used preclinical models of aggressive neuroblastoma featuring these characteristic mechanisms of primary and acquired drug resistance to experimentally evaluate a macromolecular prodrug of a structurally enhanced camptothecin analog, SN22, resisting ABCG2-mediated export, and glucuronidation. Together with extended tumor exposure to therapeutically effective drug levels via reversible conjugation to Pluronic F-108 (PF108), these features translated into rapid tumor regression and long-term survival in models of both ABCG2-overexpressing and p53-mutant high-risk neuroblastomas, in contrast to a marginal effect of the clinically used camptothecin derivative, irinotecan. Our results demonstrate that pharmacophore enhancement, increased tumor uptake, and optimally stable carrier-drug association integrated into the design of the hydrolytically activatable PF108-[SN22]2 have the potential to effectively combat multiple mechanisms governing chemoresistance in newly diagnosed (chemo-naïve) and recurrent forms of aggressive malignancies. As a macromolecular carrier-based delivery system exhibiting remarkable efficacy against two particularly challenging forms of high-risk neuroblastoma, PF108-[SN22]2 can pave the way to a robust and clinically viable therapeutic strategy urgently needed for patients with multidrug-resistant disease presently lacking effective treatment options."
https://openalex.org/W4225550159,"The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected the socially and environmentally vulnerable, including through indirect effects on other health conditions. Asthma is one such condition, which may be exacerbated by both prolonged adverse in-home exposures if quarantining in unhealthy homes and prolonged outdoor exposures if the ambient air quality is unhealthy or hazardous. As both are often the case in Environmental Justice (EJ) communities, here we have analyzed data at the census tract (CT) level for Louisiana to assess any correlation between social and environmental vulnerability, and health issues like COVID-19 and asthma. Higher Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), Particulate Matter less than 2.5 μm in diameter (PM2.5) and Ozone levels were associated with higher rates of cumulative COVID-19 incidence at various time points during the pandemic, as well as higher average annual asthma hospitalization rates and estimated asthma prevalence. Further, cumulative COVID-19 incidence during the first three months of the pandemic was moderately correlated with both asthma hospitalizations and estimated prevalence, suggesting similar underlying factors may be affecting both conditions. Additionally, 137 CTs were identified where social and environmental vulnerabilities co-existed, of which 75 (55%) had high estimated prevalence of asthma. These areas are likely to benefit from asthma outreach that considers both social and environmental risk factors. Fifteen out of the 137 CTs (11%) not only had higher estimated prevalence of asthma but also a high burden of COVID-19. Further research in these areas may help to elucidate any common social determinants of health that underlie both asthma and COVID-19 burdens, as well as better clarify the possible role of the environment as related to the COVID-19 burden in Louisiana."
https://openalex.org/W4213039889,"Balance impairment in Parkinson's disease is multifactorial and its changes due to subthalamic stimulation vary in different studies.We aimed to analyze the combination of predictive clinical factors of balance impairment in patients with Parkinson's disease treated with bilateral subthalamic stimulation for at least one year.We recruited 24 patients with Parkinson's disease treated with bilateral subthalamic stimulation and 24 healthy controls. They wore an Opal monitor (APDM Inc.) consisting of three-dimensional gyroscopes and accelerometers in the lumbar region. We investigated four stimulation conditions (bilateral stimulation OFF, bilateral stimulation ON, and unilateral right- and left-sided stimulation ON) with four tests: stance on a plain ground with eyes open and closed, stance on a foam platform with eyes open and closed. Age, disease duration, the time elapsed after implantation, levodopa, and stimulation responsiveness were analyzed. The distance of stimulation location from the subthalamic motor center was calculated individually in each plane of the three dimensions. We analyzed the sway values in the four stimulation conditions in the patient group and compared them with the control values. We explored factor combinations (with age as confounder) in the patient group predictive for imbalance with cluster analysis and a machine-learning-based multiple regression method.Sway combined from the four tasks did not differ in the patients and controls on a group level. The combination of the disease duration, the preoperative levodopa responsiveness, and the stimulation responsiveness predicted individual stimulation-induced static imbalance. The more affected patients had more severe motor symptoms; primarily, the proprioceptive followed by visual sensory feedback loss provoked imbalance in them when switching on the stimulation.The duration of the disease, the severity of motor symptoms, the levodopa responsiveness, and additional sensory deficits should be carefully considered during preoperative evaluation to predict subthalamic stimulation-induced imbalance in Parkinson's disease."
https://openalex.org/W4213428950,"Marine microbial communities play an important role in biodegradation of subsurface plumes of oil that form after oil is accidentally released from a seafloor wellhead. The response of these mesopelagic microbial communities to the application of chemical dispersants following oil spills remains a debated topic. While there is evidence that contrasting results in some previous work may be due to differences in dosage between studies, the impacts of these differences on mesopelagic microbial community composition remains unconstrained. To answer this open question, we exposed a mesopelagic microbial community from the Gulf of Mexico to oil alone, three concentrations of oil dispersed with Corexit 9500, and three concentrations of Corexit 9500 alone over long periods of time. We analyzed changes in hydrocarbon chemistry, cell abundance, and microbial community composition at zero, three and six weeks. The lowest concentration of dispersed oil yielded hydrocarbon concentrations lower than oil alone and microbial community composition more similar to control seawater than any other treatments with oil or dispersant. Higher concentrations of dispersed oil resulted in higher concentrations of microbe-oil microaggregates and similar microbial composition to the oil alone treatment. The genus Colwellia was more abundant when exposed to multiple concentrations of dispersed oil, but not when exposed to dispersant alone. Conversely, the most abundant Marinobacter amplicon sequence variant (ASV) was not influenced by dispersant when oil was present and showed an inverse relationship to the summed abundance of Alcanivorax ASVs. As a whole, the data presented here show that the concentration of oil strongly impacts microbial community response, more so than the presence of dispersant, confirming the importance of the concentrations of both oil and dispersant in considering the design and interpretation of results for oil spill simulation experiments."
https://openalex.org/W4226495859,"Increased serum mannose-binding lectin (MBL) level has been proven to correlate with the development of diabetic nephropathy (DN). Here, we aim to find the role and mechanism of MBL involved in the progression of DN. Patients with DN were recruited and divided into two groups according to different rs1800450 genotypes of the MBL2 gene, and inflammatory profiles in monocytes/macrophages were compared between the two groups. MBL was given to treat macrophages, HK2, and HMC, and a co-culture transwell system was then employed. Renal inflammation and fibrosis parameters were measured after knocking down or overexpressing MBL genes in mice. Proinflammatory profile, manifesting as enhanced IL-1β production and M1 polarization, was found in monocytes/macrophages from DN with a rs1800450 GG genotype of MBL2 gene who had higher MBL level, compared with those with a rs1800450 GA genotype. In mechanism, MBL directly induced inflammatory responses in macrophages, which promoted inflammatory and fibrotic markers in HK2 and HMCs during co-culture. Further experiments showed that MBL can promote macrophages transforming to the M1 subset mainly by activating the nuclear factor-κB pathway. After downregulation of MBL, the blood glucose, triglyceride, urine protein, injuries of glomerulus and tubules, and the degree of renal inflammation and fibrosis were ameliorated in db/db mice treated with AAV-MBL1/2-shRNA. Overexpression of MBL promoted macrophage infiltration in the kidney. In conclusion, MBL is a crucial mediator in the progression of DN via activating the nuclear factor-κB pathway in macrophages. This will serve as a genetic base for some patients with DN who have poor outcomes and provide a direction for the screening."
https://openalex.org/W4212782237,"The cross-view 3D human pose estimation model has made significant progress, it better completed the task of human joint positioning and skeleton modeling in 3D through multi-view fusion method. The multi-view 2D pose estimation part of this model is very important, but its training cost is also very high. It uses some deep learning networks to generate heatmaps for each view. Therefore, in this article, we tested some new deep learning networks for pose estimation tasks. These deep networks include Mobilenetv2, Mobilenetv3, Efficientnetv2 and Resnet. Then, based on the performance and drawbacks of these networks, we built multiple deep learning networks with better performance. We call our network in this article LHPE-nets, which mainly includes Low-Span network and RDNS network. LHPE-nets uses a network structure with evenly distributed channels, inverted residuals, external residual blocks and a framework for processing small-resolution samples to achieve training saturation faster. And we also designed a static pose sample simplification method for 3D pose data. It implemented low-cost sample storage, and it was also convenient for models to read these samples. In the experiment, we used several recent models and two public estimation indicators. The experimental results show the superiority of this work in fast start-up and network lightweight, it is about 1-5 epochs faster than the Resnet-34 during training. And they also show the accuracy improvement of this work in estimating different joints, the estimated performance of approximately 60% of the joints is improved. Its performance in the overall human pose estimation exceeds other networks by more than 7mm. The experiment analyzes the network size, fast start-up and the performance in 2D and 3D pose estimation of the model in this paper in detail. Compared with other pose estimation models, its performance has also reached a higher level of application."

https://openalex.org/W4213360497,"The objective of this research is to estimate the probability of pregnancy resumption after discontinuing reversible contraceptives-pills, injectables, implants and IUDs, and to examine the factors associated with the resumption of fertility.The study uses pregnancy calendar data from Indonesia Demographic and Health Surveys (IDHS) of 2007, 2012 and 2017. A hazard model survival method is used for estimating the time needed to resume pregnancy since discontinuing reversible contraceptives. Retrospective data on 4,573; 5,183 and 5,989 episodes of reversible contraceptive discontinuation at the three surveys respectively have been analysed.This study shows that women regained fecundity within one year of discontinuing IUD, pill, injectables or implants. Women using IUD could resume their pregnancy faster than those using implants, pills and injectables. Over the three IDHS 2007, 2012 and 2017 the age-specific percentages of women becoming pregnant after one year of contraceptive discontinuation vary between 72 and 85 for IUD, 75 and 81 for pills, 72 and 76 for implants and 64 and 67 for injectables, with the percentages being higher among younger women. The analysis further shows that length of contraceptive use, parity, prior sexually transmitted infections, knowledge of fertile period, household wealth status and place of residence have no impact on occurrence of pregnancy after contraceptive discontinuation.The analysis disproves a myth that reversible contraceptives make women infertile. Depending on the type of reversible contraceptive used, 65% to 85% of the women were able to conceive after one year of discontinuation."
https://openalex.org/W4213369871,"Orthodontic treatment requires the regulation of bone remodeling in both compression and tension sides. Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) is an important coupling factor for bone remodeling. However, the mechanism underlying the TGF-β1-mediated regulation of the osteoclast-supporting activity of osteoblasts and stromal cells remain unclear. The current study investigated the effect of TGF-β1 on receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) expression in stromal cells induced by 1α,25(OH)2D3 (D3) and dexamethasone (Dex). TGF-β1 downregulated the expression of RANKL induced by D3 and Dex in mouse bone marrow stromal lineage, ST2 cells. Co-culture system revealed that TGF-β1 suppressed osteoclast differentiation from bone marrow cell induced by D3 and Dex-activated ST2 cells. The inhibitory effect of TGF-β1 on RANKL expression was recovered by inhibiting the interaction between TGF-β1 and the TGF-β type I/activin receptor or by downregulating of smad2/3 expression. Interestingly, TGF-β1 degraded the retinoid X receptor (RXR)-α protein which forms a complex with vitamin D receptor (VDR) and regulates transcriptional activity of RANKL without affecting nuclear translocation of VDR and phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription3 (STAT3). The degradation of RXR-α protein by TGF-β1 was recovered by a ubiquitin-proteasome inhibitor. We also observed that poly-ubiquitination of RXR-α protein was induced by TGF-β1 treatment. These results indicated that TGF-β1 downregulates RANKL expression and the osteoclast-supporting activity of osteoblasts/stromal cells induced by D3 and Dex through the degradation of the RXR-α protein mediated by ubiquitin-proteasome system."
https://openalex.org/W4213457123,"In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), economic downturns can lead to increased child mortality by affecting dietary, environmental, and care-seeking factors. This study estimates the potential loss of life in children under five years old attributable to economic downturns in 2020. We used a multi-level, mixed effects model to estimate the relationship between gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and under-5 mortality rates (U5MRs) specific to each of 129 LMICs. Public data were retrieved from the World Bank World Development Indicators database and the United Nations World Populations Prospects estimates for the years 1990-2020. Country-specific regression coefficients on the relationship between child mortality and GDP were used to estimate the impact on U5MR of reductions in GDP per capita of 5%, 10%, and 15%. A 5% reduction in GDP per capita in 2020 was estimated to cause an additional 282,996 deaths in children under 5 in 2020. At 10% and 15%, recessions led to higher losses of under-5 lives, increasing to 585,802 and 911,026 additional deaths, respectively. Nearly half of all the potential under-5 lives lost in LMICs were estimated to occur in Sub-Saharan Africa. Because most of these deaths will likely be due to nutrition and environmental factors amenable to intervention, countries should ensure continued investments in food supplementation, growth monitoring, and comprehensive primary health care to mitigate potential burdens."

In 2020, Kenya reported 597 cases, an increase of 158 cases from those reported in 2019. This study aimed to estimate the measles vaccine coverage and factors associated with its uptake in Cherangany Sub County.We conducted a cross-sectional study using cluster sampling in the Cherangany Sub County of Trans Nzoia County in May 2021. We enrolled eligible children aged between 24-59 months and interviewed their caregivers using a structured questionnaire. We conducted descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate analyses. We used Prevalence Odds Ratio (POR) at bivariate and adjusted POR (aPOR) at multivariate with their corresponding 95% confidence interval as the measure of association. We regarded the variables with a p-value of less <0.05 at the multivariate level as independently associated with immunization status.We recruited 536 eligible children. The median age of the participants was 39 months (Interquartile Range 31-50). The coverage was 96.6% (518/536) for MCV dose one (MCV 1), and 56.2% (301/536) MCV dose two (MCV 2). At the bivariate level, family monthly income (POR 2.32, 95% CI 1.14-4.72), child vaccination status for other scheduled vaccines (POR 0.21, 95% CI 0.07-0.66), caregiver's level of education (POR = 1.82, 95% CI 1.29-2.57), knowledge of the vaccine-preventable diseases (POR = 0.55, 95% CI 0.38-0.80), and knowledge of the number of MCV scheduled doses (POR = 0.13, 95% CI 0.09-0.02) were significantly associated with MCV uptake. The Caregiver's knowledge on the number of MCV scheduled doses (POR = 5.73, 95% CI 3.48-9.45) and children whose birth order was ≤5th born (POR = 0.5, 95% CI 0.22-0.95) were significantly associated with MCV uptake at the multivariate analysis.The MCV 2 coverage was lower than the WHO recommended ≥ 95%. Lack of knowledge of the number of MCV scheduled doses and the child's birth order in the family are factors associated with not being fully vaccinated against measles.There is a need to strengthen the defaulter tracing system to follow up the children who default after receiving MCV 1, focusing interventions on the identified factors."

We examined the impact of background liver disease on overall survival and recurrence.The median age was 72 (range; 36-91) years; the median tumor diameter was 15 (range; 8-20) mm. The etiologies of background liver disease were hepatitis B virus infection (HBV) in 24 cases, hepatitis C virus infection (HCV) in 195 cases, and non-viral (NBNC) in 83 cases. Among the patients with HCV, 63 had achieved sustained virological response (SVR) by antiviral therapy (HCV SVR) before developing HCC (n = 37) or after HCC treatment (n = 26), and 132 had active HCV infection (HCV non-SVR). The median overall survival was 85 (95% CI; 72-98) months, and the median recurrence-free survival was 26 (95% CI; 20-30) months. Active infection with hepatitis C virus negatively contributed to overall survival (HR 2.91, 95% CI 1.31-3.60, p = 0.003) and recurrence-free survival (HR 1.47, 95% CI 1.06-2.05, p = 0.011).The prognosis of RFA treatment for very early-stage HCC was favorable. Achieving SVR in hepatitis C was important for further prognosis improvement."
https://openalex.org/W4213145478,"Endovascular interventions (EVI) are increasingly performed as minimally-invasive alternatives to surgery and have many advantages, including a decreased need for general anesthesia. However, EVI can be stressful for patients and often lead to anxiety and pain related to the procedure. The use of local anesthetics, anxiolytics, and analgesic drugs can help avoid general anesthesia. Nevertheless, these drugs have potential side effects. Alternative nonpharmacological therapies can improve patients' experience during conscious interventions and reduce the need for additional medications. The added value of virtually augmented self-hypnosis (VA-HYPO) and its potential to reduce pain and anxiety during peripheral and visceral arterial and venous EVI is unknown. This is a prospective two-arm trial designed to randomize 100 patients in two groups according to the use or not of VA-HYPO during peripheral EVI as a complementary nonpharmacological technique to improve patient comfort. The main objective is to compare per-procedural anxiety, and the secondary aim is to compare the rated per-procedural pain in both groups. The potential significance is that VA-HYPO may improve patients' experience during peripheral and visceral arterial and venous EVI and other minimally invasive interventions performed under local anesthesia.

The 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) was completed by the patients upon the initial diagnosis and recruitment for a long-term follow-up purpose. The PRO results were also assessed by disease severity.There were 244 patients (198 males) of CHB, 54 patients (29 males) of CHC, and 129 patients (85 males) of NAFLD, respectively. CHC patient had the mean score of 67.1 ± 23.3 in physical component summary (PCS) of the SF-36 health survey, which was significantly lower than CHB patients (76.4 ± 19.5), and NAFLD patients (77.5 ± 13.7), respectively (p = 0.001). The significantly lower performance of PCS in CHC patients was mainly attributed to the lower performance in physical functioning and bodily pain components. Higher fibrosis 4 index scores were significantly associated with lower PCS scores in all patient groups. There was no significant difference of mean mental component summary (MCS) between groups. However, NAFLD patients had significantly lower mental health scores than other groups (p = 0.02).The significant difference of HRQoL exists in hepatitis patients with different etiologies.

The objective of the study conducted here was to investigate the proportion and seasonality of blood parasites in animals in Mosul using the Veterinary Teaching Hospital Lab data. Laboratory records for a period of 25 months were used for data retrieval. In all included animals, Giemsa-stained blood smears were examined by an attending clinical pathologist for the presence of parasites. Seasons were assigned on a basis of examination date, and the seasonality was quantified by estimating season-to-season ratio. The results indicated that 61.77% of examined animals were tested positive for blood parasites. The most evident parasites were Trypanosoma spp., Theileria spp., Babesia spp., and then Anaplasma spp., with evidence of mixed infection. The odds of the infection did not significantly vary in different age groups. There was a marked linear pattern in the seasonality of the infection with Trypanosoma spp. and Anaplasma spp. An increase of the infection during spring and autumn with Theileria spp. and Babesia spp. was also evident. In conclusion, infection with blood parasites in different animals in Mosul is common with substantial burden, the effect of age-related infection is negligible, and the seasonality of the infection is evident."
https://openalex.org/W4213307545,"Successful everyday self-regulation often hinges on implementing intended responses at a later time-often in specific situations. We address this self-regulation challenge by examining the role of individuals' thought about intended actions-and specifically whether it does or does not include situational cues. We hypothesized that including situational cues when thinking about intended actions enables stimulus-response learning, thereby increasing the likelihood of implementing the intended actions. Consequently, we pre-registered and found (N = 392, age range 18-94) a positive relationship between the self-reported habitual inclusion of situational cues in thought about intended actions and everyday self-regulation success (assessed by self-reported self-efficacy and self-control beliefs). In addition, we provide exploratory evidence that the inclusion of situational cues in thought about intended actions mediates the relationship between conscientiousness and self-regulation success. We discuss the results and the theoretical perspective in relation to how self-control outcomes can be explained by associative learning."

We found increases in mean loneliness from 2019 to 2020; and participants that were higher in neuroticism had greater increases in thought unpleasantness and feeling depressed. Twitter-based Bronx community scores of anxiety, depressivity, and negatively-valenced affect showed elevated levels in 2020 weeks relative to 2019. Integration of EAS participant data and community data showed week-to-week fluctuations across 2019 and 2020. Results highlight how community-level data can characterize a rapidly changing environment to supplement individual-level data at no additional burden to individual participants."

Various explanations have been forward for this phenomenon, some of which are based on structural properties of the task while others are based upon the inventory context of the problem. To help distinguish between these two types of explanations, we compare behavior in a newsvendor game to behavior in a new, mathematically isomorphic, price gouging game. Our laboratory experiments replicate the standard results for newsvendors and yield the equivalent pattern in the price gouging game. This suggests previously observed newsvendor behavior is driven by structural aspects of the task consistent with models like prospect theory and impulse balance rather than context specific explanations pertaining to inventory management."

However, the mechanism underlying the increased CIP2A expression in AD brains remains unclear. We here demonstrated that the DNA damage-related Checkpoint kinase 1 (ChK1) is activated in AD human brains and 3xTg-AD mice. ChK1-mediated CIP2A overexpression drives inhibition of PP2A and activates STAT3, then leads to reactive astrogliosis and neurodegeneration in vitro. Infection of mouse brain with GFAP-ChK1-AAV induced AD-like cognitive deficits and exacerbated AD pathologies in vivo. In conclusion, we showed that ChK1 activation induces reactive astrogliosis, degeneration of neurons, and exacerbation of AD through the CIP2A-PP2A-STAT3 pathway, and inhibiting ChK1 may be a potential therapeutic approach for AD treatment."

However, reported changes are limited to those obtained from using univariate measures, including activation level and frequency bands. To look beyond the activation level, we used multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to extract patterns of information from EEG responses to images in an animacy categorization task. Comparing healthy controls (HC) with patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), we found that the neural speed of animacy information processing is decreased in MCI patients. Moreover, we found critical time-points during which the representational pattern of animacy for MCI patients was significantly discriminable from that of HC, while the activation level remained unchanged. Together, these results suggest that the speed and pattern of animacy information processing provide clinically useful information as a potential biomarker for detecting early changes in MCI and AD patients."

To test for performance, a correlational analysis of fMRI activation patterns and out-of-scanner neuropsychological visuospatial memory testing was performed. Additionally, we assessed memory-related networks using functional connectivity (FC).Greater contralateral than ipsilateral mesiotemporal (parahippocampal gyrus/hippocampus) activation was observed in left (n = 23)/right (n = 9) TLE. In lesional left TLE (n = 17), significant activations were seen in right more than left mesiotemporal areas (parahippocampal gyrus), while non-lesional left TLE patients (n = 6) showed significant bilateral (left>right) activations in mesiotemporal structures (parahippocampal gyrus). In left TLE, visuospatial cognitive testing correlated with fMRI activations in left (parahippocampal gyrus) and right mesiotemporal structures (hippocampus), characterized by greater fMRI activation being associated with better memory scores. In right TLE, higher scores in visuospatial memory testing were associated with greater fMRI activations in left and right insular regions. FC patterns of memory-related networks differ in right and left TLE.While TLE in general leads to asymmetrical mesiotemporal activation, lesion-induced and non-lesional TLE patients reveal different memory fMRI activation patterns. In right TLE, insular regions try to compensate for impaired right mesiotemporal structures during the performance of visuospatial tasks. Underlying functional visuospatial memory networks differ in right and left TLE."
https://openalex.org/W4213423619,"Erythroid differentiation (ED) is a complex cellular process entailing morphologically distinct maturation stages of erythroblasts during terminal differentiation. Studies of actin filament (F-actin) assembly and organization during terminal ED have revealed essential roles for the F-actin pointed-end capping proteins, tropomodulins (Tmod1 and Tmod3). Tmods bind tropomyosins (Tpms), which enhance Tmod capping and F-actin stabilization. Tmods can also nucleate F-actin assembly, independent of Tpms. Tmod1 is present in the red blood cell (RBC) membrane skeleton, and deletion of Tmod1 in mice leads to a mild compensated anemia due to mis-regulated F-actin lengths and membrane instability. Tmod3 is not present in RBCs, and global deletion of Tmod3 leads to embryonic lethality in mice with impaired ED. To further decipher Tmod3's function during ED, we generated a Tmod3 knockout in a mouse erythroleukemia cell line (Mel ds19). Tmod3 knockout cells appeared normal prior to ED, but showed defects during progression of ED, characterized by a marked failure to reduce cell and nuclear size, reduced viability, and increased apoptosis. Tmod3 does not assemble with Tmod1 and Tpms into the Triton X-100 insoluble membrane skeleton during ED, and loss of Tmod3 had no effect on α1,β1-spectrin and protein 4.1R assembly into the membrane skeleton. However, F-actin, Tmod1 and Tpms failed to assemble into the membrane skeleton during ED in absence of Tmod3. We propose that Tmod3 nucleation of F-actin assembly promotes incorporation of Tmod1 and Tpms into membrane skeleton F-actin, and that this is integral to morphological maturation and cell survival during erythroid terminal differentiation."

However, in many cases, nonparental adults must be sensitized by repeated or extended exposures to newborns before they will robustly display parental-like behaviors. To capture neurogenomic events underlying the transition to active parental caring behaviors, we analyzed brain gene expression and chromatin profiles of virgin female mice co-housed with pregnant dams during pregnancy and after birth. After an initial display of antagonistic behaviors and a surge of defense-related gene expression, we observed a dramatic shift in the chromatin landscape specifically in amygdala of the pup-exposed virgin females compared to females co-housed with mother before birth, accompanied by a dampening of anxiety-related gene expression. This epigenetic shift coincided with hypothalamic expression of the oxytocin gene and the emergence of behaviors and gene expression patterns classically associated with maternal care. The results outline a neurogenomic program associated with dramatic behavioral changes and suggest molecular networks relevant to human postpartum mental health."

However, despite the importance of the geographic context, most of the studies do not consider the spatial framework of this association. We aimed to assess individual spatial dependence of objectively measured moderate and vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and describe the characteristics of the built environment among spatial clusters of MVPA.Cross-sectional data from the second follow-up (2014-2017) of CoLaus|PsyCoLaus, a longitudinal population-based study of the Lausanne area (Switzerland), was used to objectively measure MVPA using accelerometers. Local Moran's I was used to assess the spatial dependence of MVPA and detect geographic clusters of low and high MVPA. Additionally, the characteristics of the built environment observed in the clusters based on raw MVPA and MVPA adjusted for socioeconomic and demographic factors were compared.Data from 1,889 participants (median age 63, 55% women) were used. The geographic distribution of MVPA and the characteristics of the built environment among clusters were similar for raw and adjusted MVPA. In the adjusted model, we found a low concentration of individuals within spatial clusters of high MVPA (median: 38.5mins; 3% of the studied population) and low MVPA (median: 10.9 mins; 2% of the studied population). Yet, clear differences were found in both models between clusters regarding the built environment; high MVPA clusters were located in areas where specific compositions of the built environment favor physical activity.Our results suggest the built environment may influence local spatial patterns of MVPA independently of socioeconomic and demographic factors. Interventions in the built environment should be considered to promote physically active behaviors in urban areas."
