https://openalex.org/W1978153810,"A steady-state model of the normal (unpolluted) surface atmosphere predicts a daytime concentration of hydroxyl, hydroperoxyl, and methylperoxyl radicals approaching 5 x 10(8)molecules per cubic centimeter and a formaldehyde concentration of 5 x 10(10) molecules per cubic centimeter or 2 parts per billion. A radical chain reaction is proposed for the rapid removal of carbon monoxide, leading to a carbon monoxide lifetime as low as 0.2 year in the surface atmosphere."
https://openalex.org/W2042032554,"Archaeological and soil-stratigraphic data define the origin, growth, and collapse of Subir, the third millennium rain-fed agriculture civilization of northern Mesopotamia on the Habur Plains of Syria. At 2200 B. C., a marked increase in aridity and wind circulation, subsequent to a volcanic eruption, induced a considerable degradation of land-use conditions. After four centuries of urban life, this abrupt climatic change evidently caused abandonment of Tell Leilan, regional desertion, and collapse of the Akkadian empire based in southern Mesopotamia. Synchronous collapse in adjacent regions suggests that the impact of the abrupt climatic change was extensive."
https://openalex.org/W2048147675,"Effects on the global temperature of large increases in carbon dioxide and aerosol densities in the atmosphere of Earth have been computed. It is found that, although the addition of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere does increase the surface temperature, the rate of temperature increase diminishes with increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. For aerosols, however, the net effect of increase in density is to reduce the surface temperature of Earth. Because of the exponential dependence of the backscattering, the rate of temperature decrease is augmented with increasing aerosol content. An increase by only a factor of 4 in global aerosol background concentration may be sufficient to reduce the surface temperature by as much as 3.5 degrees K. If sustained over a period of several years, such a temperature decrease over the whole globe is believed to be sufficient to trigger an ice age."

Over 5000 ethyl methanesulfonate-mutagenized plants were analyzed by this method, leading to the identification of 38 mutant lines. One complementation group of mutants was completely deficient in l-fucose, a constituent of pectic and hemicellulosic polysaccharides. These mutant plants were dwarfed in growth habit, and their cell walls were considerably more fragile than normal."
https://openalex.org/W1992786050,"Because of its high resistivity and subsequent low electroactivity, sulfur is not normally considered a room-temperature battery cathode. An elemental sulfur cathode has been made with a measured capacity of over 900 ampere.hours per kilogram, more than 90 percent of the theoretical storage capacity of solid sulfur at room temperature, accessed by means of a lightweight, highly conductive, aqueous polysulfide interface through the electrocatalyzed reaction S + H(2)O + 2e(-) --> HS(-) + OH(-). This solid sulfur cathode was first used in a battery with an aluminum anode for an overall discharge reaction 2Al + 3S + 3OH(-) + 3H(2)O --> 2Al(OH)(3) + 3HS(-), giving a cell potential of 1.3 volts. The theoretical specific energy of the aluminum-sulfur battery (based on potassium salts) is 910 watt.hours per kilogram with an experimental specific energy of up to 220 watt.hours per kilogram."
https://openalex.org/W1974685935,Surface tension measurements reveal surface freezing in liquid n-alkanes. A solid monolayer of molecules is found to exist up to 30°C above the bulk freezing point. This surface phase exists only for carbon numbers 14 < n ≤ 50. The measured carbon number and temperature dependence of the surface tension is interpreted within a simple thermodynamical model based on known bulk latent heat data and surface energy considerations. The vanishing of the surface phase for n ≤ 14 is a possible transition from surface freezing to surface melting behavior.
https://openalex.org/W1995825858,"A series of sputtered multilayers of Ni(80)Fe(20)-Ag was prepared to examine the giant magnetoresistance effect before and after annealing. For a wide range of NiFe and Ag thicknesses, no giant magnetoresistance was observed in the unannealed films. After annealing, a large, negative magnetoresistance was observed of order 4 to 6% in applied fields of order 5 to 10 oersteds at room temperature. The appearance of giant managetoresistance is concurrent with the breakup of the NiFe layers, which is attributable to a magnetostatic interaction that favors local antiparallel alignment of the moments in adjacent layers. These structures may be of significant practical importance as sensors that require large changes in resistance at low fields, such as magnetoresistive heads used in magnetic recording systems."
https://openalex.org/W1974923710,"Reflectance spectra (0.3 to 2.6 micrometers) of 14 C, G, B, and F asteroids and 21 carbonaceous chondrite powders are compared in detail. Only three thermally metamorphosed CM-Cl chondrites that have a weak ultraviolet absorption are shown to have close counterparts among those asteroids. Reflectance spectra of heated Murchison CM2 chondrite are compared with the average C and G type asteroid spectra. Murchison heated at 600 degrees to 1000 degrees C exhibits a similar weak ultraviolet absorption and provides the best analog for those spectra. Comparison of ultraviolet absorption strengths between 160 C, G, B, and F asteroids and carbonaceous chondrites suggests that surface minerals of most of those asteroids are thermally metamorphosed at temperatures around 600 degrees to 1000 degrees C."
https://openalex.org/W1981370105,"A quasi two-dimensional drop of a magnetic fluid (ferrofluid) in a magnetic field is one example of the many systems, including amphiphilic monolayers, thin magnetic films, and type I superconductors, that form labyrinthine patterns. The formation of the ferrofluid labyrinth was examined both experimentally and theoretically. Labyrinth formation was found to be sensitively dependent on initial conditions, indicative of a space of configurations having a vast number of local energy minima. Certain geometric characteristics of the labyrinths suggest that these multiple minima have nearly equivalent energies. Kinetic effects on pattern selection were found in studies of fingering in the presence of timedependent magnetic fields. The dynamics of this pattern formation was studied within a simple model that yields shape evolutions in qualitative agreement with experiment."
https://openalex.org/W2034466929,"Stishovite, the highest pressure polymorph of silicon dioxide, may be an important mineral in some regions of the Earth's mantle. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy has been used to determine the hydrogen content of synthetic stishovite. The concentration of hydrogen depends on the aluminum content of the sample and reaches a maximum of 549 +/- 23 hydrogen atoms per 10(6) silicon atoms for an Al(2)O(3) content of 1.51 percent by weight. Stishovite could be a storage site for water in deep subducting slabs and in regions of the mantle that are too hot for hydrous minerals to be stable."
https://openalex.org/W2084442706,Long-range global climate forecasts were made by use of a model for predicting a tropical Pacific sea-surface temperature (SST) in tandem with an atmospheric general circulation model. The SST is predicted first at long lead times into the future. These ocean forecasts are then used to force the atmospheric model and so produce climate forecasts at lead times of the SST forecasts. Prediction of seven large climatic events of the 1970s to 1990s by this technique are in good agreement with observations over many regions of the globe.
https://openalex.org/W2095057737,"The nature and distribution of power sources of the sea other than petroleum are discussed, along with possible entrées for their use. Waves, tides, currents, and salinity and temperature gradients all have the potential to contribute useful power. Submarine geothermal sources, salt domes, ice, and other marine-associated concentrations may be more important. There are opportunities to employ these marine power resources directly rather than for contributions to power grids or power-intensive products. Ancillary employment of the seawater as a coolant and of the sediments below the seabed for the disposal of nuclear wastes may be even more important uses than employment of the power that the sea contains."

Extremely productive persons in a specialty, however, seem to form a separate distribution; they have a considerably higher number of contacts."

https://openalex.org/W2090308295,"The genetic technologies being adopted in South Asia are significant factors in the agricultural development of the area. But, labeling them ""miracle seeds,"" solely responsible for recent agricultural growth, is misleading. Certainly the introduction of new genetic technology has catalyzed South Asian agriculture and has instilled a new dynamism essential to economic development. Somewhat similar phenomena have, however, been observed in other parts of the world in other periods of history."
