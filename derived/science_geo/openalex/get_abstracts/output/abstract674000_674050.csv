https://openalex.org/W3162353597,"Nanopore RNA sequencing shows promise as a method for discriminating and identifying different RNA modifications in native RNA. Expanding on the ability of nanopore sequencing to detect N6-methyladenosine, we show that other modifications, in particular pseudouridine (Ψ) and 2'-O-methylation (Nm), also result in characteristic base-calling 'error' signatures in the nanopore data. Focusing on Ψ modification sites, we detected known and uncovered previously unreported Ψ sites in mRNAs, non-coding RNAs and rRNAs, including a Pus4-dependent Ψ modification in yeast mitochondrial rRNA. To explore the dynamics of pseudouridylation, we treated yeast cells with oxidative, cold and heat stresses and detected heat-sensitive Ψ-modified sites in small nuclear RNAs, small nucleolar RNAs and mRNAs. Finally, we developed a software, nanoRMS, that estimates per-site modification stoichiometries by identifying single-molecule reads with altered current intensity and trace profiles. This work demonstrates that Nm and Ψ RNA modifications can be detected in cellular RNAs and that their modification stoichiometry can be quantified by nanopore sequencing of native RNA."
https://openalex.org/W3162006056,"Synaptic plasticity is believed to be a key physiological mechanism for learning. It is well established that it depends on pre- and postsynaptic activity. However, models that rely solely on pre- and postsynaptic activity for synaptic changes have, so far, not been able to account for learning complex tasks that demand credit assignment in hierarchical networks. Here we show that if synaptic plasticity is regulated by high-frequency bursts of spikes, then pyramidal neurons higher in a hierarchical circuit can coordinate the plasticity of lower-level connections. Using simulations and mathematical analyses, we demonstrate that, when paired with short-term synaptic dynamics, regenerative activity in the apical dendrites and synaptic plasticity in feedback pathways, a burst-dependent learning rule can solve challenging tasks that require deep network architectures. Our results demonstrate that well-known properties of dendrites, synapses and synaptic plasticity are sufficient to enable sophisticated learning in hierarchical circuits. The authors propose a synaptic plasticity rule for pyramidal neurons based on postsynaptic bursting that captures experimental data and solves the credit assignment problem for deep networks."
https://openalex.org/W3161201474,"Staying dry Is precipitation all that a watershed needs to recover from drought? Conventional wisdom says yes, but this is not necessarily true. Peterson et al. studied streamflow and precipitation in 161 watersheds in southeastern Australia across the Millennium Drought, which stuck the region during the first decade of the 21st century (see the Perspective by Tauro). They found that runoff in approximately one-third of the watersheds had not returned to predrought levels even after 7 years despite the resumption of more normal precipitation. The authors suggest that these longterm changes are due to water loss from increased transpiration. Watersheds may thus have multiple states and a finite resilience to transient disturbances, and hydrological droughts can persist long after meteorological droughts.

https://openalex.org/W3161394630,"ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers are commonly mutated in human cancer. Mammalian SWI/SNF complexes comprise three conserved multisubunit chromatin remodelers (cBAF, ncBAF and PBAF) that share the BRG1 (also known as SMARCA4) subunit responsible for the main ATPase activity. BRG1 is the most frequently mutated Snf2-like ATPase in cancer. In the present study, we have investigated the role of SWI/SNF in genome instability, a hallmark of cancer cells, given its role in transcription, DNA replication and DNA-damage repair. We show that depletion of BRG1 increases R-loops and R-loop-dependent DNA breaks, as well as transcription–replication (T-R) conflicts. BRG1 colocalizes with R-loops and replication fork blocks, as determined by FANCD2 foci, with BRG1 depletion being epistatic to FANCD2 silencing. Our study, extended to other components of SWI/SNF, uncovers a key role of the SWI/SNF complex, in particular cBAF, in helping resolve R-loop-mediated T-R conflicts, thus, unveiling a new mechanism by which chromatin remodeling protects genome integrity. The SWI/SNF complex helps resolve R-loop-mediated transcription–replication conflicts, as depletion of SWI/SNF complex member BRG1 increases R-loops, R-loop-dependent DNA breaks and transcription–replication conflicts."
https://openalex.org/W3160505941,"Various insect species serve as valuable model systems for investigating the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which a brain controls sophisticated behaviors. In particular, the nervous system of Drosophila melanogaster has been extensively studied, yet experiments aimed at determining the number of neurons in the Drosophila brain are surprisingly lacking. Using isotropic fractionator coupled with immunohistochemistry, we counted the total number of neuronal and non-neuronal cells in the whole brain, central brain, and optic lobe of Drosophila melanogaster . For comparison, we also counted neuronal populations in three divergent mosquito species: Aedes aegypti , Anopheles coluzzii and Culex quinquefasciatus . The average number of neurons in a whole adult brain was determined to be 199,380 ±3,400 cells in D . melanogaster , 217,910 ±6,180 cells in Ae . aegypti , 223,020 ± 4,650 cells in An . coluzzii and 225,911±7,220 cells in C . quinquefasciatus . The mean neuronal cell count in the central brain vs. optic lobes for D . melanogaster (101,140 ±3,650 vs. 107,270 ± 2,720), Ae . aegypti (109,140 ± 3,550 vs. 112,000 ± 4,280), An . coluzzii (105,130 ± 3,670 vs. 107,140 ± 3,090), and C . quinquefasciatus (108,530 ±7,990 vs. 110,670 ± 3,950) was also estimated. Each insect brain was comprised of 89% ± 2% neurons out of its total cell population. Isotropic fractionation analyses did not identify obvious sexual dimorphism in the neuronal and non-neuronal cell population of these insects. Our study provides experimental evidence for the total number of neurons in Drosophila and mosquito brains."

https://openalex.org/W3162084837,"Precise deposition of CpG methylation is critical for mammalian development and tissue homeostasis and is often dysregulated in human diseases. The localization of de novo DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A is facilitated by its PWWP domain recognizing histone H3 lysine 36 (H3K36) methylation1,2 and is normally depleted at CpG islands (CGIs)3. However, methylation of CGIs regulated by Polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs) has also been observed4–8. Here, we report that DNMT3A PWWP domain mutations identified in paragangliomas9 and microcephalic dwarfism10 promote aberrant localization of DNMT3A to CGIs in a PRC1-dependent manner. DNMT3A PWWP mutants accumulate at regions containing PRC1-mediated formation of monoubiquitylated histone H2A lysine 119 (H2AK119ub), irrespective of the amounts of PRC2-catalyzed formation of trimethylated histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3). DNMT3A interacts with H2AK119ub-modified nucleosomes through a putative amino-terminal ubiquitin-dependent recruitment region, providing an alternative form of DNMT3A genomic targeting that is augmented by the loss of PWWP reader function. Ablation of PRC1 abrogates localization of DNMT3A PWWP mutants to CGIs and prevents aberrant DNA hypermethylation. Our study implies that a balance between DNMT3A recruitment by distinct reader domains guides de novo CpG methylation and may underlie the abnormal DNA methylation landscapes observed in select human cancer subtypes and developmental disorders. DNMT3A PWWP domain mutations promote localization of DNMT3A to CpG islands in a PRC1-dependent manner. DNMT3A interacts with H2AK119ub-modified nucleosomes."
https://openalex.org/W3162417332,"Noise correlations (that is, trial-to-trial covariations in neural activity for a given stimulus) limit the stimulus information encoded by neural populations, leading to the widely held prediction that they impair perceptual discrimination behaviors. However, this prediction neglects the effects of correlations on information readout. We studied how correlations affect both encoding and readout of sensory information. We analyzed calcium imaging data from mouse posterior parietal cortex during two perceptual discrimination tasks. Correlations reduced the encoded stimulus information, but, seemingly paradoxically, were higher when mice made correct rather than incorrect choices. Single-trial behavioral choices depended not only on the stimulus information encoded by the whole population, but unexpectedly also on the consistency of information across neurons and time. Because correlations increased information consistency, they enhanced the conversion of sensory information into behavioral choices, overcoming their detrimental information-limiting effects. Thus, correlations in association cortex can benefit task performance even if they decrease sensory information."
https://openalex.org/W3163259623,"A viable hydrothermal technique has been explored for the synthesis of copper doped Zinc oxide nanoparticles (Cu-doped ZnO-NPs) based on the precursor's mixture of Copper-II chloride dihydrate (CuCl2.2H2O), Zinc chloride (ZnCl2), and potassium hydroxide (KOH). X-ray diffraction (XRD) reported the hexagonal wurtzite structure of the synthesized Cu-doped ZnO-NPs. The surface morphology is checked via field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), whereas, the elemental compositions of the samples were confirmed by Raman, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), respectively. The as-obtained ZnO-NPs and Cu-doped ZnO-NPs were then tested for their antibacterial activity against clinical isolates of Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia) bacteria via agar well diffusion method. The zone of inhibition (ZOI) for Cu-doped ZnO-NPs was found to be 24 and 19 mm against S. Aureus and S. pyogenes, and 18 and 11 mm against E. coli and K. pneumoniae, respectively. The synthesized Cu-doped ZnO-NPs can thus be found as a potential nano antibiotic against Gram-positive multi-drug resistant bacterial strains."

https://openalex.org/W3163368546,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is an eye disease that can cause visual impairment and affects the elderly over 50 years of age. AMD is characterized by the presence of drusen, which causes changes in the physiological structure of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and the boundaries of the Bruch's membrane layer (BM). Optical coherence tomography is one of the main exams for the detection and monitoring of AMD, which seeks changes through the evaluation of successive sectional cuts in the search for morphological changes caused by drusen. The use of CAD (Computer-Aided Detection) systems has contributed to increasing the chances of correct detection, assisting specialists in diagnosing and monitoring disease. Thus, the objective of this work is to present a method for the segmentation of the inner limiting membrane (ILM), retinal pigment epithelium, and Bruch's membrane in OCT images of healthy and Intermediate AMD patients. The method uses two deep neural networks, U-Net and DexiNed to perform the segmentation. The results were promising, reaching an average absolute error of 0.49 pixel for ILM, 0.57 for RPE, and 0.66 for BM."
https://openalex.org/W3163899561,"This study examined the effect of collaborative learning (CL) versus traditional lecture-based learning (TL) pedagogies and gender group composition in effecting positive or negative attitudes of biology major and nonmajor men and women students. The experimental research method was administered in experimental and control groups to test the hypotheses. Students' attitudes refer to their positive or negative feelings and inclinations to learn biology. A nine-factor attitude scale was administered in (1) single-gender nonmajor biology, (2) mixed-gender nonmajor biology, (3) single-gender major biology, and (4) mixed-gender biology major groups. Men (221) and women (219) were randomly assigned into single and mixed-gender classes without groups and single-gender groups (4M) or (4W) and mix-gender (2M+2W) groups. In CL nonmajor and major single-gender groups, women demonstrated significantly higher positive attitudes than men. In contrast, men's attitudes were significantly improved in mixed-gender CL groups for major and nonmajor sections, and the effect size was larger in mix-gender classes. Women feel less anxious in single-gender groups but more anxious in mixed-gender groups. In mixed-gender groups, men's self-efficacy, general interest, and motivation enhanced significantly; overall, men experienced greater satisfaction and triggered their desire to collaborate better, affecting all nine attitudinal factors. There was an interaction effect demonstrating the teaching pedagogy's impact on improving students' attitudes toward biology; students' gender and gender-specific group composition have been the most influential factor for nonmajor students. These findings suggest that there is a need for developing gender-specific and context-specific learning pedagogies, and instructors carefully select gender grouping in teaching undergraduate science subjects."
https://openalex.org/W3161775899,"Introducing a knowledge graph into a recommender system as auxiliary information can effectively solve the sparse and cold start problems existing in traditional recommender systems. In recent years, many researchers have performed related work. A recommender system with knowledge graph embedding learning characteristics can be combined with a recommender system of the following three forms: one-by-one learning, joint learning, and alternating learning. For current knowledge graph embedding, a deep learning framework only has one embedding mode, which fails to excavate the potential information from the knowledge graph thoroughly. To solve this problem, this paper proposes the Ripp-MKR model, a multitask feature learning approach for knowledge graph enhanced recommendations with RippleNet, which combines joint learning and alternating learning of knowledge graphs and recommender systems. Ripp-MKR is a deep end-to-end framework that utilizes a knowledge graph embedding task to assist recommendation tasks. Similar to the MKR model, in the Ripp-MKR model, two tasks are associated with cross and compress units, which automatically share latent features and learn the high-order interactions among items in recommender systems and entities in the knowledge graph. Additionally, the model borrows ideas from RippleNet and combines the knowledge graph with the historical interaction record of a user's historically clicked items to represent the user's characteristics. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that Ripp-MKR achieves substantial gains over state-of-the-art baselines in movie, book, and music recommendations."

Using a difference-in-differences approach, we find that municipalities with higher exposure to closed sectors experienced subsequently lower mortality rates. The implied life savings exceed 9,400 people over a period of less than a month. We also find that business closures exhibited rapidly diminishing returns and had large effects outside the closed businesses themselves, including spillovers to other municipalities. Overall, the results suggest business shutdowns are effective, but should be selectively implemented and centrally coordinated."
https://openalex.org/W3160924855,"Neonates with severe complications at birth or during the neonatal period who nearly died but survived constitute neonatal near miss (NNM) cases. Identifying NNM cases and correcting contributing factors are of the utmost importance to get relevant controls for neonatal deaths. However, limited studies are assessing the prevalence of NNM and associated factors with NNM cases in Ethiopia. So, this study is aimed at assessing the magnitude of neonatal near miss and associated factors among live births in public hospitals of Jimma zone, southwest Ethiopia, 2020.A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 260 neonates from April 1-30 / 2020. Face to face interviewer-administered structured questionnaire was used to collect data from the mothers and a standard checklist was used for their neonates. The data was encoded and entered into Epi-Data version 4.2 and exported to SPSS version 23 for analysis. Independent variables with marginal associations (p-value <0.25) in the bivariable analysis were eligible for multivariable logistic regression analysis to detect an association with outcome variables. Finally, adjusted odds ratios (AOR) with 95% CI were used to estimate the strength of associations, and statistical significance was declared at a p-value < 0.05.The magnitude of NNM was 26.7% with [95%CI: 21.6-32.5]. Hypertension during pregnancy [AOR: 3.4; 95%CI: 1.32-8.88], mode of delivery [AOR: 3.32; 95%CI: 1.48-7.45], Obstructed labor [AOR: 2.95; 95%CI: 1.32-6.45] and non-vertex fetal presentation during delivery [AOR: 4.61; 95%CI: 2.16-9.84] were identified as significantly predictors of NNM.Over a quarter of the neonates were with NNM cases, which is relatively higher than the report of studies done in other countries. Hypertension during pregnancy, cesarean delivery, prolonged labor, and non-vertex fetal presentation were all found to increase the likelihood of NNM. Therefore, concerted efforts are needed from local health planners and health care providers to improve maternal health care services especially in early identification of the complications and taking appropriate management."
https://openalex.org/W3161517631,"Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a dominant CAG-repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene. Microglial activation is a key feature of HD pathology, and is present before clinical disease onset. The kynurenine pathway (KP) of tryptophan degradation is activated in HD, and is thought to contribute to disease progression. Indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) catalyzes the first step in this pathway; this and other pathway enzymes reside with microglia. While HD brain microglia accumulate iron, the role of iron in promoting microglial activation and KP activity is unclear. Here we utilized the neonatal iron supplementation model to investigate the relationship between iron, microglial activation and neurodegeneration in adult HD mice. We show in the N171-82Q mouse model of HD microglial morphologic changes consistent with immune activation. Neonatal iron supplementation in these mice promoted neurodegeneration and resulted in additional microglial activation in adults as determined by increased soma volume and decreased process length. We further demonstrate that iron activates IDO, both in brain lysates and purified recombinant protein (EC50 = 1.24 nM). Brain IDO activity is increased by HD. Neonatal iron supplementation further promoted IDO activity in cerebral cortex, altered KP metabolite profiles, and promoted HD neurodegeneration as measured by brain weights and striatal volumes. Our results demonstrate that dietary iron is an important activator of microglia and the KP pathway in this HD model, and that this occurs in part through a direct effect on IDO. The findings are relevant to understanding how iron promotes neurodegeneration in HD."
https://openalex.org/W3160071692,"Background In Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs) premature infants are exposed to various acoustic, environmental and emotional stressors which have a negative impact on their development and the mental health of their parents. Family-centred music therapy bears the potential to positively influence these stressors. The few existing studies indicate that interactive live-improvised music therapy interventions both reduce parental stress factors and support preterm infants’ development. Methods The present randomized controlled longitudinal study (RCT) with very low and extremely low birth weight infants (born &lt;30+0 weeks of gestation) and their parents analyzed the influence of music therapy on both the physiological development of premature infants and parental stress factors. In addition, possible interrelations between infant development and parental stress were explored. 65 parent-infant-pairs were enrolled in the study. The treatment group received music therapy twice a week from the 21 st day of life till discharge from hospital. The control group received treatment as usual. Results Compared to the control group, infants in the treatment group showed a 11.1 days shortening of caffeine therapy, 12.1 days shortening of nasogastric/ orogastric tube feed and 15.5 days shortening of hospitalization, on average. While these differences were not statistically significant, a factor-analytical compound measure of all three therapy durations was. From pre-to-post-intervention, parents showed a significant reduction in stress factors. However, there were no differences between control and treatment group. A regression analysis showed links between parental stress factors and physiological development of the infants. Conclusion This pilot study suggests that a live-improvised interactive music therapy intervention for extremely and very preterm infants and their parents may have a beneficial effect on the therapy duration needed for premature infants before discharge from hospital is possible. The study identified components of the original physiological variables of the infants as appropriate endpoints and suggested a slight change in study design to capture possible effects of music therapy on infants’ development as well. Further studies should assess both short-term and long-term effects on premature infants as well as on maternal and paternal health outcomes, to determine whether a family-centered music therapy, actually experienced as an added value to developmental care, should be part of routine care at the NICU."
https://openalex.org/W3160246283,"Complete mitochondrial genome sequences facilitate species identification and analyses of phylogenetic relationships. However, the available data are limited to the diverse and widespread insect family Cicadellidae. This study analyzes and summarizes the complete mitochondrial genome structure characteristics of 11 leafhopper subfamilies and two newly sequenced Typhlocybinae species, Empoascanara wengangensis and E. gracilis. Moreover, using 13PCGs and rRNA data to analyze the nucleotide diversity, evolution rate, and the phylogenetic relationship between the subfamilies of 56 species, verifying the taxonomic status analysis of E. wengangensis and E. gracilis. The analysis results show that the genome structures of the subfamilies and the newly sequenced two species are very similar, and the size of the CR region is significantly related to the repeat unit. However, in the entire AT-skews and CG-skews, the AT-skews of other subfamilies are all positive, and CG-skews are negative, while Empoascini of Typhlocybinae and Ledrinae are the opposite. Furthermore, among 13PCGs, the AT-skews of 13 species are all negative while CG-skews are positive, which from Empoascini in Typhlocybinae, Idiocerinae, Cicadellinae, Ledrinae, and Evacanthinae. Phylogenetic analysis shows that ML and PB analysis produce almost consistent topologies between different data sets and models, and some relationships are highly supported and remain unchanged. Mileewinae is a monophyletic group and is a sister group with Typhlocybinae, and the sister group of Evacanthinae is Ledrinae + Cicadellinae. Phylogenetic analysis grouped the two newly sequenced species with other species of Typhlocybinae, which was separated from other subfamilies, and all Erythroneurini insects gathered together. However, E. gracilis grouped into a single group, not grouped with species of the same genus (Empoascanara). This result does not match the traditional classification, and other nuclear genes or transcriptome genes may be needed to verify the result. Nucleotide diversity analysis shows that nad4 and nad5 may be evaluated as potential DNA markers defining the Cicadellidae insect species."
https://openalex.org/W3163024003,"Background The systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), which is calculated using absolute platelet, neutrophil, and lymphocyte counts, has recently attracted attentions as a prognostic indicator in patients with solid malignancies. In the current study, we retrospectively investigated the prognostic significance of pre-treatment SII among patients with endometrial cancer. Method Endometrial cancer patients treated at Nara medical university hospital between 2008 and 2018 were included in the current study. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to find the optimal SII cut-off values for 3-years progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Then, the predictive abilities of SII and its superiority over neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR) were investigated. Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate the OS and PFS rates, and log-rank test was used to compare the survival rate between two groups. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis were performed to identify risk factors for PFS and OS. Result A total of 442 patients were included in the current study. The cut-off value of SII for predicting PFS and OS were defined by ROC analysis as 931 and 910, respectively. Univariate analyses showed that elevated SII was associated with significantly shorter survival ( p &lt;0.001 for both PFS and OS). Cox regression analyses revealed that an advanced FIGO stage ( p &lt;0.001 for both PFS and OS) and an elevated SII ( p = 0.014 for PFS, p = 0.011 for OS) are the independent prognostic factors for survival. When SII was compared with NLR and PLR, SII showed greater area under curve for predicting survival. Conclusion The SII is an independent prognostic factor in endometrial cancer patients, allowing more precise survival estimation than PLR or NLR."
https://openalex.org/W2891931951,"Individual life expectancies provide information for individuals making retirement decisions and for policy makers. For couples, analogous measures are the expected years both spouses will be alive (joint life expectancy) and the expected years the surviving spouse will be a widow or widower (survivor life expectancy). Using individual life expectancies to calculate summary measures for couples is intuitively appealing but yield misleading results, overstating joint life expectancy and dramatically understating survivor life expectancies. This implies that standard ""individual life cycle models"" are misleading for couples and that ""couple life cycle models"" must be substantially more complex. Using the CDC life tables for 2010, we construct joint and survivor life expectancy measures for randomly formed couples. The couples we form are defined by age, race and ethnicity, and education. Due to assortative marriage, inequalities in individual life expectancies are compounded into inequalities in joint and survivor life expectancies. We also calculate life expectancy measures for randomly formed couples for the 1930-2010 decennial years. Trends over time show how the relative rate of decrease in the mortality rates of men and women affect joint and survivor life expectancies. Because our couple life expectancy measures are based on randomly formed couples, they do not capture the effects of differences in spouses' premarital characteristics (apart from sex, age, race and ethnicity, and, in some cases, education) or of correlations in spouses' experiences or behaviors during marriage. However, they provide benchmarks which have been sorely lacking in the public discourse."

A sample of 509 participants (53.8% female; M age: 12.77 years [SD = 0.81]) recruited from secondary schools completed questionnaires assessing social anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, and concentration in class. Educational achievement was assessed by internal grades within schools. An indirect effect of social anxiety on later educational achievement via concentration was observed, over and above baseline achievement and depression symptoms; adolescents with higher levels of social anxiety tend to have more difficulties concentrating in class, which in turn is associated with poorer academic outcomes. Findings underscore the challenges socially anxious adolescents will face trying to learn in school, and the need for education providers and clinicians to consider the effect of social anxiety symptoms on concentration and learning."

Yet, research into weight stigma reduction techniques is limited, and rarely results in reduced antipathy toward higher-weight individuals. The current pre-registered study investigated a novel weight stigma reduction intervention. We tested whether a writing exercise focusing on body functionality (i.e., everything the body can do, rather than how it looks) of another person leads to reductions in weight stigma. Method Participants were 98 women ( M age = 23.17, Range = 16–63) who viewed a photograph of a higher-weight woman, “Anne,” and were randomised to complete a writing exercise either describing what “Anne’s” body could do (experimental group) or describing her home (active control group). Facets of weight stigma were assessed at pretest and posttest. Results At posttest, the experimental group evidenced higher fat acceptance and social closeness to “Anne” compared with the active control group. However, no group differences were found in attribution complexity, responsibility, and likeability of “Anne”. Conclusions A brief body functionality intervention effectively reduced some, but not all, facets of weight stigma in women. This study provides evidence that functionality-focused interventions may hold promise as a means to reduce weight stigma."
https://openalex.org/W3160515264,"Euphausiids are a keystone species in coastal food webs due to their high lipid content and seasonally high biomass. Understanding the habitat and environmental drivers that lead to areas of high biomass, or 'hotspots', and their seasonal persistence, will support the identification of important foraging regions for mid- and upper- trophic level predators. We quantify the distribution of hotspots of the two dominant species of euphausiid in the north-east Pacific Ocean: Euphausia pacifica and Thysanoessa spinifera, as well as euphausiid larvae (mixed species). The Canadian coast encompasses the northern California Current Ecosystem and the transition zone to the Alaska current, and is a highly productive region for fisheries, marine mammals, and seabirds. We used spatiotemporal modelling to predict the distribution of these three euphausiid groups in relation to geomorphic and environmental variables during the important spring-summer months (April through September) when euphausiid biomass is highest. We quantified the area, intensity, and persistence of biomass hotspots across months according to specific oceanographic ecosections developed for marine spatial planning purposes. Persistent hotspots of both adult species were predicted to occur along the 200 m depth contour of the continental slope; however, differences were predicted on the shallower Dixon shelf, which was a key area for T. spinifera, and within the Juan de Fuca Eddy system where E. pacifica hotspots occurred. The continental slope along the west coast of Vancouver Island was the only persistent hotspot region common between both adult species and euphausiid larvae. Larval distribution was more correlated with T. spinifera than E. pacifica biomass. Hotspots of adults were more persistent across months than hotspots of euphausiid larvae, which were seasonally patchy. The persistence of biomass hotspots of forage species through periods of low overall biomass could maintain trophic connectivity through perturbation events and increase ecosystem resilience to climate change."

Nine individuals with past AOE generated further patient-centred candidate items. Candidate items were rated for importance by patient and professional (ENT doctors, general practitioners, microbiologists, nurses, audiologists) stakeholders in a three-round online Delphi exercise. Consensus items were grouped to form the COS, diagnostic criteria, and definition.Candidate COS items from patients (n = 28) and literature (n = 25) were deduplicated and amalgamated to a final candidate list (n = 46). Patients emphasised quality-of-life and the impact on daily activities/work. Via the Delphi process, stakeholders agreed on 31 candidate items. The final COS covered six outcomes: pain; disease severity; impact on quality-of-life and daily activities; patient satisfaction; treatment-related outcome; and microbiology. 14 candidate diagnostic criteria were identified, 8 reaching inclusion consensus. The final definition for AOE was 'diffuse inflammation of the ear canal skin of less than 6 weeks duration'.The development and adoption of a consensus definition, diagnostic criteria and a COS will help to standardise future research in AOE, facilitating meta-analysis.

Factor analysis was first used with rainfall data to classify districts into meteorological zones. We used a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model for univariate predictions and an autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model for multivariable analysis of leptospirosis with monthly average rainfall, temperature, relative humidity (RH), solar radiation (SR), and the number of rainy days/month (RD). Districts were classified into wet (WZ) and dry (DZ) zones, and highlands (HL) based on the factor analysis of rainfall data. The WZ had the highest leptospirosis incidence; there was no difference in the incidence between the DZ and HL. Leptospirosis was fluctuated positively with rainfall, RH and RD, whereas temperature and SR were fluctuated negatively. The best-fitted SARIMA models in the three zones were different from each other. Despite its known association, rainfall was positively significant in the WZ only at lag 5 ( P = 0.03) but was negatively associated at lag 2 and 3 ( P = 0.04). RD was positively associated for all three zones. Temperature was positively associated at lag 0 for the WZ and HL ( P &lt; 0.009) and was negatively associated at lag 1 for the WZ ( P = 0.01). There was no association with RH in contrast to previous studies. Based on altitude and rainfall data, meteorological variables could effectively predict the incidence of leptospirosis with different models for different climatic zones. These predictive models could be effectively used in public health planning purposes."
https://openalex.org/W3161491504,"Significant progress has been made addressing adolescent health needs in New Zealand, but some areas, such as mental health issues remain, particularly for rangatahi Māori (indigenous Māori young people). Little is known about how contemporary Māori whānau (families) and communities influence health outcomes, health literacy and access to services. Previous nationally representative secondary school surveys were conducted in New Zealand in 2001, 2007 and 2012, as part of the Youth2000 survey series. This paper focuses on a fourth survey conducted in 2019 (https://www.youth19.ac.nz/). In 2019, the survey also included kura kaupapa Māori schools (Māori language immersion schools), and questions exploring the role of family connections in health and wellbeing. This paper presents the overall study methodology, and a weighting and calibration framework in order to provide estimates that reflect the national student population, and enable comparisons with the previous surveys to monitor trends.Youth19 was a cross sectional, self-administered health and wellbeing survey of New Zealand high school students. The target population was the adolescent population of New Zealand (school years 9-13). The study population was drawn from three education regions: Auckland, Tai Tokerau (Northland) and Waikato. These are the most ethnically diverse regions in New Zealand. The sampling design was two-stage clustered stratified, where schools were the clusters, and strata were defined by kura schools and educational regions. There were four strata, formed as follows: kura schools (Tai Tokerau, Auckland and Waikato regions combined), mainstream-Auckland, mainstream-Tai Tokerau and mainstream-Waikato. From each stratum, 50% of the schools were randomly sampled and then 30% of students from the selected schools were invited to participate. All students in the kura kaupapa schools were invited to participate. In order to make more precise estimates and adjust for differential non-response, as well as to make nationally relevant estimates and allow comparisons with the previous national surveys, we calibrated the sampling weights to reflect the national secondary school student population.There were 45 mainstream and 4 kura schools included in the final sample, and 7,374 mainstream and 347 kura students participated in the survey. There were differences between the sampled population and the national secondary school student population, particularly in terms of sex and ethnicity, with a higher proportion of females and Asian students in the study sample than in the national student population. We calculated estimates of the totals and proportions for key variables that describe risk and protective factors or health and wellbeing factors. Rates of risk-taking behaviours were lower in the sampled population than what would be expected nationally, based on the demographic profile of the national student population. For the regional estimates, calibrated weights yield standard errors lower than those obtained with the unadjusted sampling weights. This leads to significantly narrower confidence intervals for all the variables in the analysis. The calibrated estimates of national quantities provide similar results. Additionally, the national estimates for 2019 serve as a tool to compare to previous surveys, where the sampling population was national.One of the main goals of this paper is to improve the estimates at the regional level using calibrated weights to adjust for oversampling of some groups, or non-response bias. Additionally, we also recommend the use of calibrated estimators as they provide nationally adjusted estimates, which allow inferences about the whole adolescent population of New Zealand. They also yield confidence intervals that are significantly narrower than those obtained using the original sampling weights."
https://openalex.org/W3161530306,"Objective This study aimed to describe the endurance training and incidence of illnesses reported by a group of well-trained cross-country (XC) skiers throughout their transition from junior to senior level. Methods Changes in self-reported training and performance, from 31 well-trained XC skiers, were analyzed from the start of the season they turned 16 y until the end of the season they turned 22 y, using linear mixed-effects models. Differences in the incidence of self-reported illness episodes were analyzed using incidence rate ratios, and the relationships between self-reported illness and training volumes were analyzed using linear mixed-effects models in a sub-group of 23 of the skiers. Results In total, 145 seasons of training data (including 85,846 h of endurance training) and 109 person-years of illness data (including 380 self-reported illness episodes) were analyzed. The athletes progressively increased their annual endurance training volume from age 16 to 22 y in a linear fashion, from ~ 470 to 730 h. Low- and high-intensity training volumes increased by 51.4 ± 2.4 h·y -1 (p &lt; .001) and 4.9 ± 0.6 h·y -1 (p &lt; .001), respectively. Sport-specific and non-specific training increased by 50.0 ± 2.2 h·y -1 (p &lt; .001) and 4.6 ± 2.0 h·y -1 (p &lt; .001), respectively. The athletes reported a median (range) of 3 (0–8) illness episodes and 17 (0–80) days of illness per year, and there was an inverse relationship between self-reported illness days and annual training volume (-0.046 ± 0.013 d·h -1 ; p &lt; .001). Conclusions This group of well-trained XC skiers increased their endurance training volume in a linear fashion by ~ 55 h annually. This was primarily achieved through an increase in low-intensity and sport-specific training. Furthermore, higher training volumes were associated with a lower number of self-reported illness days."
https://openalex.org/W3161666115,"Society has been increasingly concerned about the impact of pain on farm animal welfare. This systematic review aims to provide evidence relating to the measurement properties (i.e. reliability, validity, and sensitivity) of pain scoring instruments used for pain assessment in farm animals. A literature search will be performed using five databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, CAB abstracts and Biological Abstracts) and search terms related to pain, pain scales and different species of farm animals. Eligibility criteria will include full-text studies on the development and/or validation of acute and chronic pain scoring instruments for farm animals including bovine (beef and dairy), ovine, caprine, camel, swine and poultry. Exclusion criteria will include studies that report the use of pain scales for the validation of another instrument, or those reporting ethograms/list of behaviors potentially indicating pain without a scoring system. Study titles and their abstracts will be screened for eligibility by one investigator. Full-text articles will be independently reviewed for eligibility and evaluated by two investigators. Relevant information will be recorded and evaluated systematically according to the Consensus-based Standards for the Selection of Health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) checklist using an adapted data collection sheet. The following measurement properties and characteristics of the instruments will be assessed: content validity (internal consistency, structural and cross-cultural validity), reliability, measurement error, criterion and construct validity, responsiveness, interpretability and feasibility. Following the assessment of methodological quality and quality of the findings, evidence for each measurement property will be summarized into high, moderate, low or very low. This systematic review will provide further insights into the evidence-based measurement properties of pain scoring instruments in farm animals. It may identify possible gaps of knowledge with these tools as a potential target for future studies in farm animals with a positive impact on animal welfare."
https://openalex.org/W3161936524,"In many regions of sub Saharan Africa large mammals occur in human-dominated areas, yet their community composition and abundance have rarely been described in areas occupied by traditional hunter-gatherers and pastoralists. Surveys of mammal populations in such areas provide important measures of biodiversity and provide ecological context for understanding hunting practices. Using a sampling grid centered on a Hadza hunter-gatherer camp and covering 36 km2 of semi-arid savannah in northern Tanzania, we assessed mammals using camera traps (n = 19 stations) for c. 5 months (2,182 trap nights). In the study area (Tli'ika in the Hadza language), we recorded 36 wild mammal species. Rarefaction curves suggest that sampling effort was sufficient to capture mammal species richness, yet some species known to occur at low densities in the wider area (e.g. African lions, wildebeest) were not detected. Relative abundance indices of wildlife species varied by c. three orders of magnitude, from a mean of 0.04 (African wild dog) to 20.34 capture events per 100 trap-nights (Kirk's dik dik). To contextualize the relative abundance of wildlife in the study area, we compared our study's data to comparable camera trap data collected in a fully protected area of northern Tanzania with similar rainfall (Lake Manyara National Park). Raw data and negative binomial regression analyses show that wild herbivores and wild carnivores were generally detected in the national park at higher rates than in the Hadza-occupied region. Livestock were notably absent from the national park, but were detected at high levels in Tli'ika, and cattle was the second most frequently detected species in the Hadza-used area. We discuss how these data inform current conservation efforts, studies of Hadza hunting, and models of hunter-gatherer foraging ecology and diet."
https://openalex.org/W3127856773,"The study examined the factor structure of burnout, as measured with the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory. The participants were 235 employees of a public administration agency who assessed their burnout online for 10 consecutive working days. Two models were tested with multilevel confirmatory factor analysis, assuming the same one or two-factor structure at the within- and between-person levels. Both models showed a reasonable fit to the data, but due to a strong correlation between exhaustion and disengagement and low within-person reliability for disengagement, a unidimensional model seems more valid. A cross-level invariance was not confirmed for either of the structures, showing that factor loadings for the same items differ significantly between the levels. This suggests that burnout is not the same latent variable at each level; rather, there are factors other than daily burnout that influence person-level scores and ignoring these across-level discrepancies may lead to biased conclusions."
https://openalex.org/W3160416950,"Over one third of crops are animal pollinated, with insects being the largest group. In some crops, including strawberries, fruit yield, weight, quality, aesthetics and shelf life increase with insect pollination. Many crops are protected from extreme weather in polytunnels, but the impacts of polytunnels on insects are poorly understood. Polytunnels could reduce pollination services, especially if insects have access issues. Here we examine the distribution and activity of honeybees and non-honeybee wild insects on a commercial fruit farm. We evaluated whether insect distributions are impacted by flower type (strawberry; raspberry; weed), or distance from polytunnel edges. We compared passive pan-trapping and active quadrat observations to establish their suitability for monitoring insect distribution and behaviour on a farm. To understand the relative value of honeybees compared to other insects for strawberry pollination, the primary crop at the site, we enhanced our observations with video data analysed using insect tracking software to document the time spent by insects on flowers. The results show honeybees strongly prefer raspberry and weed flowers over strawberry flowers and that location within the polytunnel impacts insect distributions. Consistent with recent studies, we also show that pan-traps are ineffective to sample honeybee numbers. While the pan-traps and quadrat observations tend to suggest that investment in managed honeybees for strawberry pollination might be ineffective due to consistent low numbers within the crop, the camera data provides contrary evidence. Although honeybees were relatively scarce among strawberry crops, camera data shows they spent more time visiting flowers than other insects. Our results demonstrate that a commercial fruit farm is a complex ecosystem influencing pollinator diversity and abundance through a range of factors. We show that monitoring methods may differ in their valuation of relative contributions of insects to crop pollination."
https://openalex.org/W3161719571,"Psychological Control (PC) interferes with autonomy-related processes in adolescence and has a negative impact on adolescents' development related to internalizing and externalizing problems. Several scholars suggested that PC can be used differently by mothers and fathers. However, these differences are still understudied and mainly grounded on maternal and/or adolescents' perspectives, leading to potentially incomplete inferences on the effects of PC. The present study extends previous research on PC in two directions. First, we tested the dyadic and cumulative effects of maternal and paternal PC on adolescents' antisocial behaviors and anxious-depressive symptoms. Secondly, we explored the cross-cultural generalizability of these associations in three countries: Italy, Colombia, and USA. Participants included 376 families with data from three consecutive years (T1, adolescents' age = 13.70). Mothers' and fathers' reports of PC and youth's reports of antisocial and internalizing behaviors were assessed. Using the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model (APIM) we found that maternal PC predicted adolescents' reported antisocial behaviors whereas paternal PC predicted lower anxious-depressed symptoms. Comparisons across countries evidenced the cross-cultural invariance of the longitudinal APIM across Italy, Colombia, and USA. The practical implications of these results are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3163139940,"Excessive home cage aggression often results in severe injury and subsequent premature euthanasia of male laboratory mice. Aggression can be reduced by transferring used nesting material during cage cleaning, which is thought to contain aggression appeasing odors from the plantar sweat glands. However, neither the composition of plantar sweat nor the deposits on used nesting material have been evaluated. The aims of this study were to (1) identify and quantify volatile compounds deposited in the nest site and (2) determine if nest and sweat compounds correlate with social behavior. Home cage aggression and affiliative behavior were evaluated in 3 strains: SJL, C57BL/6N, and A/J. Individual social rank was assessed via the tube test, because ranking may influence compound levels. Sweat and urine from the dominant and subordinate mouse in each cage, plus cage level nest samples were analyzed for volatile compound content using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Behavior data and odors from the nest, sweat, and urine were statistically analyzed with separate principal component analyses (PCA). Significant components, from each sample analysis, and strain were run in mixed models to test if odors were associated with behavior. Aggressive and affiliative behaviors were primarily impacted by strain. However, compound PCs were also impacted by strain, showing that strain accounts for any relationship between odors and behavior. C57BL/6N cages displayed the most allo-grooming behavior and had high scores on sweat PC1. SJL cages displayed the most aggression, with high scores on urine PC2 and low scores on nest PC1. These data show that certain compounds in nesting material, urine, and sweat display strain specific patterns which match strain specific behavior patterns. These results provide preliminary information about the connection between home cage compounds and behavior. Salient compounds will be candidates for future controlled studies to determine their direct effect on mouse social behavior."
https://openalex.org/W3163180110,"Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is one of the most fatal infectious diseases in the world, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, including Ethiopia. Even though Antiretroviral therapy (ART) significantly decreases mortality overall, death rates are still highest especially in the first year of ART initiation.To assess the incidence and predictors of mortality within the first year of ART initiation among adults on ART at Debre-Markos Referral Hospital, Northwest Ethiopia.A retrospective follow-up study was conducted among 514 newly enrolled adults to ART from 2014 to 2018 at Debre-Markos Referral Hospital. Patients' chart number was selected from the computer using a simple random sampling technique. Data were entered into EPI- INFO 7.2.2.6 and analyzed using Stata 14.0. The mortality rate within the first year was computed and described using frequency tables. Both bivariable and multivariable Cox-proportional hazard models were fitted to show predictors of early mortality.Out of 494 patient records included in the analysis, a total of 54 deaths were recorded within one year follow-up period. The overall mortality rate within 398.37 person years (PY) was 13.56 deaths/100 PY with the higher rate observed within the first three months. After adjustment, rural residence (Adjusted Hazard Ratio (AHR) = 1.97; 95% CI: 1.05-3.71), ≥ 6 months pre-ART duration (AHR = 2.17; 95% CI: 1.24-3.79), ambulatory or bedridden functional status at enrolment (AHR = 2.18; 95% CI: 1.01-4.74), and didn't take Cotrimoxazole preventive therapy (CPT) during follow-up (AHR = 1.88; 95% CI: 1.04-3.41) were associated with early mortality of adults on ART.Mortality within the first year of ART initiation was high and rural residence, longer pre-Art duration, ambulatory or bedridden functional status and didn't take CPT during follow-up were found to be independent predictors. Hence, giving special attention for patients from rural area and provision of CPT is crucial to reduce mortality."
https://openalex.org/W3163628478,"An end-to-end sea fog removal network using multiple scattering model was proposed. In this network, the atmospheric multiple scattering model was re-formulated and used for sea fog removal. Compared with the atmospheric single scattering model, the atmospheric multiple scattering model could more comprehensively consider the effect of multiple scattering, which was important to the dense fog scenes, such as in ocean scene. Therefore, we used the atmospheric multiple scattering model to avoid image blurring. The model can directly generate the dehazing results, and unify the three parameters of the transmission map, the atmospheric light and the blur kernel into one formula. The latest smooth dilation and sub-pixel techniques were used in the network model. The latest techniques can avoid the gridding artifacts and the halo artifacts, the multi-scale sub-network was used to consider the features of multi-scale. In addition, multiple loss functions were used in end-to-end network. In the experimental results, the model was superior to the state-of-the-art models in terms of quantitatively and qualitatively."

This study used a mussel-inspired hemostatic polymer, chitosan-catechol, to treat gastrointestinal bleeding caused by endoscopic mucosal resection in a heparinized porcine model. We aimed to evaluate the hemostatic efficacy and short-term safety of this wet adhesive chitosan-catechol. We used 15 heparinized pigs. Four iatrogenic bleeding ulcers classified as Forrest Ib were created in each pig using an endoscopic mucosal resection method. One ulcer in each pig was untreated as a negative control (no-treatment group). The other three ulcers were treated with gauze (gauze group), argon plasma coagulation (APC group), and chitosan-catechol hemostatic agent (CHI-C group) each. The pigs were sacrificed on Days 1, 5, and 10, and histological examination was performed (n = 5 per day). Rapid hemostasis observed at 2 min after bleeding was 93.3% (14/15) in the CHI-C group, 6.7% (1/15) in the no-treatment group, 13.3% (2/15) in the gauze group, and 86.7% (13/15) in the APC group. No re-bleeding was observed in the CHI-C group during the entire study period. However, a few re-bleeding cases were observed on Day 1 in the no-treatment, gauze, and APC groups and on Day 5 in the gauze and APC groups. On histological analysis, the CHI-C group showed the best tissue healing among the four test groups. Considering the results, chitosan-catechol is an effective hemostatic material with reduced re-bleeding and improved healing."
https://openalex.org/W3163104166,"Fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23), a bone-produced hormone, plays a critical role in mineral homeostasis. Human diseases associated with excessive intact circulating FGF23 (iFGF23) result in hypophosphatemia and low vitamin D hormone in patients with normal kidney function. In addition, there is accumulating evidence linking FGF23 with inflammation. Based on these studies and the frequent observation of hypophosphatemia among septic patients, we sought to elucidate further the relationship between FGF23 and mineral homeostasis in a clinically relevant murine polymicrobial sepsis model. Medium-severity sepsis was induced by cecum ligation puncture (CLP) in adult CD-1 mice of both sexes. Healthy CD-1 mice (without CLP) were used as controls. Forty-eight hours post-CLP, spontaneous urine was collected, and serum, organs and bones were sampled at necropsy. Serum iFGF23 increased ~20-fold in CLP compared to control mice. FGF23 protein concentration was increased in the bones, but not in spleen or liver of CLP mice. Despite the ~20-fold iFGF23 increase, we did not observe any significant changes in mineral homeostasis or parathyroid hormone levels in the blood of CLP animals. Urinary excretion of phosphate, calcium, and sodium remained unchanged in male CLP mice, whereas female CLP mice exhibited lower urinary calcium excretion, relative to healthy controls. In line with renal FGF23 resistance, expression of phosphate-, calcium- and sodium-transporting proteins did not show consistent changes in the kidneys of male and female CLP mice. Renal expression of the co-receptor αKlotho was downregulated in female, but not in male CLP mice. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that the dramatic, sex-independent rise in serum iFGF23 post-CLP was mainly caused by an upregulation of FGF23 secretion in the bone. Surprisingly, the upsurge in circulating iFGF23 did not alter humoral mineral homeostasis in the acutely septic mice. Hence, the biological function of elevated FGF23 in sepsis remains unclear and warrants further studies."
https://openalex.org/W3161148935,"Disseminated tumors cells ( DTCs ) present in the bone marrow ( BM ) are believed to be the progenitors of distant metastatic spread, a major cause of mortality in breast cancer patients. To better understand the behavior and therapeutic vulnerabilities of these rare cell populations, unbiased methods for selective cell enrichment are required. In this study, we have evaluated a microfluidic-based filtration system (Parsortix R , Angle PLC), previously demonstrated for use in circulating tumor cell ( CTC ) capture, to capture BM DTCs. Performance using BM samples was also compared directly to enrichment of CTCs in the peripheral blood ( PB ) from both metastatic and non-metastatic breast cancer patients. Although the non-specific capture of BM immune cells was significant, the device could routinely achieve significant cytoreduction of BM and PB WBCs and at least 1,000-fold enrichment of DTCs, based on labeled tumor cell spike-in experiments. Detection of previously characterized DTC-associated gene expression biomarkers was greatly enhanced by the enrichment method, as demonstrated by droplet digital PCR assay. Cells eluted from the device were viable and suitable for single cell RNA sequencing experiments. DTCs in enriched BM samples comprised up to 5% of the total cell population, allowing for effective single cell and population-based transcriptional profiling of these rare cells. Use of the Parsortix instrument will be an effective approach to enrich for rare BM DTCs in order to better understand their diverse molecular phenotypes and develop approaches to eradicate these cells to prevent distant disease development in breast cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W3162206034,"Background Workplace experience, defined as the evaluation of the work environment and performance, and a characteristic of workplace culture, can influence an employee’s work-life balance. Most carer-employees, who combine paid full-time work and informal caregiving responsibilities, struggle to maintain a healthy work-life balance. Caregiver-Friendly Workplace Programs are designed to improve the work experience, and ultimately, the work-life balance of carer-employees. The purpose of this study is to identify changes in workplace culture through the examination of the efficacy of a caregiver-friendly workplace program on workplace experience. First, we identify whether awareness of a caregiver-friendly workplace program directly increases the amount of work support received and, in turn, improves workplace experience. Second, we will examine if significant differences in the amount of work support received translates into an improved workplace experience for carer-employees over time. Methods Two university-wide online surveys were conducted separately; time 1 (T1) during the summer of 2015, and time 2 (T2), in the summer of 2017. In each survey, nearly 7000 employees received the invitation to participate with a response rate ranging 10% (T1) to 12% (T2). Respondents were asked about their sociodemographic characteristics, caregiving responsibilities (if applicable), awareness of caregiver-friendly workplace program, types of work support received, and work experience. Reliability analyses was conducted for three scales: awareness of caregiver-friendly workplace program; work support , and; workplace experience . Proportional T-tests were used to examine the difference amongst the intervention scales over time. Structural equation modeling (SEM), via path analysis, was used to investigate the causal indirect ( awareness of caregiver-friendly workplace program to work support to workplace experience) relationship that define the workplace culture. Results No significant changes in workplace culture were found over time. However, awareness of caregiver-friendly workplace programs is shown to positively impact the amount of support received , which sequentially improves workplace experience , and ultimately workplace culture . This therefore suggests that the implementation of caregiver-friendly workplace programs is potentially effective. Conclusions Results suggest that amount of support received , and workplace experience would be better reassessed via a longer time period (i.e., 5 yr. window), and improved support for managers and supervisors is needed to supplement relationships with their employees."
https://openalex.org/W3162214823,"In South Africa, replacing smear microscopy with Xpert-MTB/RIF (Xpert) for tuberculosis diagnosis did not reduce mortality and was cost-neutral. The unchanged mortality has been attributed to suboptimal Xpert implementation. We developed a mathematical model to explore how complementary investments may improve cost-effectiveness of the tuberculosis diagnostic algorithm.Complementary investments in the tuberculosis diagnostic pathway were compared to the status quo. Investment scenarios following an initial Xpert test included actions to reduce pre-treatment loss-to-follow-up; supporting same-day clinical diagnosis of tuberculosis after a negative result; and improving access to further tuberculosis diagnostic tests following a negative result. We estimated costs, deaths and disability-adjusted-life-years (DALYs) averted from provider and societal perspectives. Sensitivity analyses explored the mediating influence of behavioural, disease- and organisational characteristics on investment effectiveness.Among a cohort of symptomatic patients tested for tuberculosis, with an estimated active tuberculosis prevalence of 13%, reducing pre-treatment loss-to-follow-up from ~20% to ~0% led to a 4% (uncertainty interval [UI] 3; 4%) reduction in mortality compared to the Xpert scenario. Improving access to further tuberculosis diagnostic tests from ~4% to 90% among those with an initial negative Xpert result reduced overall mortality by 28% (UI 27; 28) at $39.70/ DALY averted. Effectiveness of investment scenarios to improve access to further diagnostic tests was dependent on a high return rate for follow-up visits.Investing in direct and indirect costs to support the TB diagnostic pathway is potentially highly cost-effective."
https://openalex.org/W3163151333,"Studies on antibiotic utilization trends are invaluable because they offer data for evaluation of impacts of antimicrobial stewardship policies. Such studies help determine correlations between the use of specific antibiotic classes and trends in emergence of resistance (resistance-epidemiology). This study aims to quantify the consumption systemic antibiotics (J01)—in defined daily doses (DDD) per 1000 inhabitants per day (DID)—in Ethiopia’s public healthcare sector (2016–2020). By so doing, it attempts to capture the extent of population exposure to antibiotics in the country. Data were also compared with those from Norway to establish rough estimate of the country’s status vis-à-vis some globally acknowledged better practices with regard to optimal use of antibiotics. Raw data obtained from registers of Ethiopian Pharmaceutical Supply Agency were converted into DDD, per the standard methodology recommended by WHO. To control for population size, antibiotics consumption data were presented as DID. Since official population census data for Ethiopia were not available for the study period, population projection data from the World Bank were used. Community-based consumption of systemic antibiotics increased from 11.02 DID in 2016 to 12.83 DID in 2020 in Ethiopia—an increase by 16.4%. Moreover, analysis of a log-linear regression model showed that the average growth rate in the community-based systemic antibiotics consumption per year between 2016 and 2020 was about 3.3% (R 2 = 0.89). The highest percentage change in community-based systemic antibiotics consumption happened for glycopeptides (J01XA) and the fourth generation cephalosporins (J01DE)—1300% and 600% compared to the baseline year (2016), respectively. At product level, 9 antibiotics constituted the common domain in the list of medication cocktails in the drug utilization 90% (DU90%) for the study period. Community-based consumption of systemic antibiotics for Ethiopia and Norway showed opposite trends, calling for public health policy actions in Ethiopia."

The etiology of EM in Kazakhstan is not clearly defined, so from February 1, 2017 to January 31, 2018 we conducted hospital-based syndromic surveillance for EM at the Shymkent City Hospital, in the South Kazakhstan region. All consenting inpatients meeting a standard case definition were enrolled. Blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were collected for bacterial culture, and CSF samples were additionally tested by PCR for four bacterial species and three viruses using a cascading algorithm. We enrolled 556 patients. Of these, 494 were of viral etiology (including 4 probable rabies cases), 37 were of bacterial etiology, 19 were of unknown etiology and 6 were not tested. The most commonly identified pathogens included enterovirus (73%, n = 406 cases), herpes simplex virus (12.8%, n = 71), and Neisseria meningitidis (3.8%, n = 21). The incidence rates (IRs) for enteroviral and meningococcal EM were found to be 14.5 and 0.7 per 100,000 persons, respectively. The IR for bacterial EM using both PCR and culture results was 3–5 times higher compared to culture-only results. Antibacterial medicines were used to treat 97.2% (480/494) of virus-associated EM. Incorporation of PCR into routine laboratory diagnostics of EM improves diagnosis, pathogen identification, ensures IRs are not underestimated, and can help avoid unnecessary antibacterial treatment."

Results sNEP was measured in 1428 patients (age 67.7±12.7, 70.3% men, LVEF 35.8% ±14), 144 of which had a LVEF &gt;57%. sNEP levels did not significantly differ between LVEF groups (p = 0.31). During a mean follow-up of 6±3.9 years, the primary endpoint occurred in 979 patients and the secondary composite endpoint in 714 (in 111 and 84 of the 144 patients with LVEF &gt;57%, respectively). sNEP was significantly associated with both composite endpoints. Age- and sex- adjusted Cox regression analyses showed higher hazard ratios for sNEP in patients with LVEF &gt;57%, both for the primary (HR 1.37 [1.16–1.61] vs. 1.04 [0.97–1.11]) and the secondary (HR 1.38 [1.21–1.55] vs. 1.11 [1.04–1.18]) composite endpoints. Conclusions sNEP prognostic value in patients with HF and LVEF &gt;57% outperforms that observed in patients with lower LVEF. Precision medicine using sNEP may identify HF patients with preserved LVEF that may benefit from treatment with sacubitril/valsartan."

However, very limited methodological discussion exists regarding the magnitude of low effort responses from participants recruited via Facebook and African samples. This study describes a quasi-random study that identified and enrolled young adults in Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa between 22 May and 6 June 2020, based on an advertisement budget of 9,000.00 ZAR (US $521.44). The advertisements attracted over 900,000 views, 11,711‬ unique clicks, 1190 survey responses, and a total of 978 completed responses from young adults in the three countries during the period. Competition rates on key demographic characteristics ranged from 82% among those who attempted the survey to about 94% among eligible participants. The average cost of the advertisements was 7.56 ZAR (US $0.43) per survey participant, 8.68 ZAR (US $0.50) per eligible response, and 9.20 ZAR (US $0.53) per complete response. The passage rate on the attention checks varied from about 50% on the first question to as high as 76% on the third attention check question. About 59% of the sample passed all the attention checks, while 30% passed none of the attention checks. Results from a truncated Poisson regression model suggest that passage of attention checks was significantly associated with demographically relevant characteristics such as age and sex. Overall, the findings contribute to the growing body of literature describing the strengths and limitations of online sample frames, especially in developing countries."

https://openalex.org/W3163031594,"We have established a new screening system for identifying interacting proteins by combining biomolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) and a transposon gene trap system. This system requires creation of a bait strain that stably expresses a fusion product of part of the fluorescent monomeric Kusabira-Green (mKG) protein to a protein of interest. A PiggyBac transposon vector is then introduced into this strain, and a sequence encoding the remainder of mKG is inserted into the genome and fused randomly with endogenous genes. The binding partner can be identified by isolating cells that fluoresce when BiFC occurs. Using this system, we screened for interactors of p65 (also known as RELA), an NF-κB subunit, and isolated a number of mKG-positive clones. 5'- or 3'-RACE to produce cDNAs encoding mKG-fragment fusion genes and subsequent reconstitution assay identified PKM, HSP90AB1, ANXA2, HSPA8, and CACYBP as p65 interactors. All of these, with the exception of CACYBP, are known regulators of NF-κB. Immunoprecipitation assay confirmed endogenously expressed CACYBP and p65 formed a complex. A reporter assay revealed that CACYBP enhanced 3κB reporter activation under TNFα stimulation. This screening system therefore represents a valuable method for identifying interacting factors that have not been identified by other methods."
