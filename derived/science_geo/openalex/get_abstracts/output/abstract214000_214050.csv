https://openalex.org/W2035503462,"Microbodies of rat hepatic cells and hepatomas contain a crystalloid with the same structural characteristics as crystals of purified uricase, when viewed by electron microscopy. We conclude that crystalline uricase is located within hepatic microbodies."
https://openalex.org/W2077255312,Liver homogenates prepared from rats injected with high doses of actinomycin D show a decrease in polyribosome content and in amino acid incorporation. These effects are not observed in rat liver not subjected to homogenization and are independent of the inhibition of RNA synthesis caused by the antibiotic.
https://openalex.org/W1965517319,"Catnip (nepetalactone) is closely related chemically to certain cyclopentanoid monoterpenes recently isolated from insects, and it shares with some of these terpenes an ability to repel insects. It is suggested that the adaptive function of catnip is to protect the plants that produce it against phytophagous insects."
https://openalex.org/W2056298397,"Two electronic neuron models (neuromimes) connected to a common excitatory input and having both self- and mutual-inhibition were used to simulate the pulse patterns which control wing musculature in certain insects. With variation of stimulus frequency, firing patterns changed in discrete steps. Pattern change was found to be hysteretic: the pattern elicited by a given stimulus frequency depended on whether that frequency was approached from above or below. Pattern selection could be controlled by the injection or deletion of a single pulse in the stimulus pulse-train as well as by smooth frequency change."

https://openalex.org/W2059132984,"Genetic derepression of ribitol dehydrogenase in a mutant of Aerobacter aerogenes, strain 1033, enabled it to grow on xylitol, a substrate of the enzyme, but not its inducer. A derivative strain with an improved rate of growth on xylitol was obtained from the first mutant. The faster growth rate was made possible by the production of an altered ribitol dehydrogenase, as demonstrated by an increase in its activity on xylitol relative to ribitol and by its decreased heat stability."

Two fetuses that were recovered from the treated females had congenital abnormalities. The thalidomide syndrome in the monkeys was manifested by amelia, phocomelia, internal hydrocephaly, facial capillary hemangioma, hypogenesis of the metatarsal bones, and anotia."

This phase appeared after a 3- to 5-minute period of sleep characterized by slow waves, and continued for 4 to 15 minutes."
https://openalex.org/W1977744468,"A naphthoquinone-dependent strain of Bacteroides melaninogenicus has been used in a microbiological assay to survey bacteria for compounds of the vitamin K group. Organisms known to contain vitamin K, as well as several bacteria that are obligate anaerobes, produced substances which satisfied the naphthoquinone requirement of the assay organism. Vitamin K was chemically isolated from strains of Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Bacteroides fragilis, and Veillonella alcalescens."

https://openalex.org/W2078798765,"THE earliest method of concentrating solutions of labile proteins, drying from the frozen state in vacuo, has several disadvantages, some of a technical and others of a fundamental nature such as increase in salt concentration and the proneness of complexes of proteins with lipids and some other substances to denaturation on freezing and drying. The alternatives are removal of water by dialysis of the protein solution against concentrated solutions of dextran or polyethylene glycol1 of molecular weights sufficiently high not to penetrate the walls of the ‘Cellophane’ dialysis sac, or absorption of the water by shaking the protein solution with dispersed, cross-linked dextran (‘Sephadex’)2. These methods avoid freezing and drying and allow the salt concentration to be maintained at any desired value. However, dialysis is time-consuming to set up if many small samples are involved, and considerable losses can occur on the walls of the sac when the removal of 0.1–0.5 ml. of viscous protein solution is attempted. Removal of the water with ‘Sephadex’ is simple to carry out, but there is sometimes considerable loss of trace proteins by adsorption on to the large surface presented by the gel particles. This led me to consider the possibility of using rods of dried hydrophilic gel to remove the water from protein solutions while maintaining constant ionic strength."

Despite structural differences detected by electrophoretic mobility and antigenicity, all the vertebrate enzymes responded similarly to allosteric modification. Bacterial glutamate dehydrogenase was immunologically unrelated to the vertebrate enzymes and did not respond to allosteric regulation."

https://openalex.org/W2082427340,"Bacteria may persist in ""protoplast"" form in kidneys after treatment of experimental enterococcal pyelonephritis with penicillin. Erythromycin, while ineffective against the bacterial form of infection, was able to kill ""protoplasts"" in vivo. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that intact cell wall interferes with the ingress of erythromycin into the cellular area in which it acts."

https://openalex.org/W2058656803,"Treatment of donor animals with unrelated antigens can regularly inhibit reactivity of spleen cells against the host, with subsequent induction of specific immune tolerance in the recipient animals if the barrier to histocompatibility is weak. Mice made tolerant in this way accept skin grafts from donor strain animals. In the case of strong differences (in H2 locus) or heterologous (rat-mouse) combinations, the inhibition of the reactivity of the transferred lymphoid cells against the host is partial, and the skin-graft survival time is significantly prolonged."
https://openalex.org/W2026942911,"CATECHOLAMINES have for many years been known to produce cardiac arrhythmias1. The influence of acetylcholine or vagal stimulation on arrhythmias, especially of the atria, has overshadowed the influence of the sympathetic mediators2. Sharma3 has reported that administration of epinephrine or norepinephrine simultaneously with acetylcholine enhanced the fibrillatory activity of the latter. Thus, it would seem appropriate to examine further the relationship between acetylcholine and catecholamines in their effect on heart rhythm."

Moreover, this decarboxylase inhibitor has been demonstrated to be antihypertensive in man3."

Donor-host genetic disparity as it relates to the intensity of the reaction, when homografts, heterografts, and xenografts are compared, appears to be one of several factors which play a role in the post-embryonic induction of both lymphosarcomas in Xenopus laevis and accessory limb structures in Triturus viridescens."

https://openalex.org/W1987648208,"THE interdependence of various types of macromolecular synthesis in the cell has been demonstrated by the use of various antimetabolites. Synthesis of some ribonucleoproteins (RNP) in the nucleus is dependent on continued formation of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)1–3. One of these ribonucleoproteins is present in the nucleolus in the form of spherules called ‘nucleolini’3. When synthesis of DNA was inhibited by 5-fluorodeoxyuridine (FUDR), the nucleolini were at first enlarged and later disappeared. The pars amorpha of the nucleolus was not reduced during this process3. Further cytochemical observations and biochemical investigations of HeLa cells, grown as previously described3, and treated with 2 × 10−5 M FUDR are presented here."
https://openalex.org/W2076082846,"Köllner's discovery of binasal hemianopia as an early stage in binocular color rivalry is extended to the study of the subsequent suppression of the color seen by an eye. The Köllner effect is one of the five two-color configurations that occur initially, and through which total suppression develops by the visible expansion of one of the colors. However, suppression sometimes occurs without a two-color phase."

https://openalex.org/W1975551705,"THE foregoing comments of Prof. Meredith are most pertinent with respect to suggestions about the particular modes of information storage utilized by the brain. Unfortunately, in trying to explain the thermodynamic approach to recognition of forms in as simple a way as possible I may have left the impression that the brain may actually store ‘visual’ sub-shapes, as such, for use in comparison with a perceptual image for recognition of the parent shape. Certainly, this implication was not intended. The possibilities for coding of information for use in memory and decision-making have been previously considered by me1 and are pertinent to the present subject."
