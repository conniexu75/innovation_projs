https://openalex.org/W2106650442,"To understand the genetic heterogeneity underlying developmental delay, we compared copy number variants (CNVs) in 15,767 children with intellectual disability and various congenital defects (cases) to CNVs in 8,329 unaffected adult controls. We estimate that ∼14.2% of disease in these children is caused by CNVs >400 kb. We observed a greater enrichment of CNVs in individuals with craniofacial anomalies and cardiovascular defects compared to those with epilepsy or autism. We identified 59 pathogenic CNVs, including 14 new or previously weakly supported candidates, refined the critical interval for several genomic disorders, such as the 17q21.31 microdeletion syndrome, and identified 940 candidate dosage-sensitive genes. We also developed methods to opportunistically discover small, disruptive CNVs within the large and growing diagnostic array datasets. This evolving CNV morbidity map, combined with exome and genome sequencing, will be critical for deciphering the genetic basis of developmental delay, intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2026717532,"Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder. Growing evidence indicates a causative role of misfolded forms of the protein α-synuclein in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Intraneuronal aggregates of α-synuclein occur in Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, the cytopathological hallmarks of Parkinson's disease and related disorders called synucleinopathies. α-Synuclein has long been defined as a 'natively unfolded' monomer of about 14 kDa (ref. 6) that is believed to acquire α-helical secondary structure only upon binding to lipid vesicles. This concept derives from the widespread use of recombinant bacterial expression protocols for in vitro studies, and of overexpression, sample heating and/or denaturing gels for cell culture and tissue studies. In contrast, we report that endogenous α-synuclein isolated and analysed under non-denaturing conditions from neuronal and non-neuronal cell lines, brain tissue and living human cells occurs in large part as a folded tetramer of about 58 kDa. Several methods, including analytical ultracentrifugation, scanning transmission electron microscopy and in vitro cell crosslinking confirmed the occurrence of the tetramer. Native, cell-derived α-synuclein showed α-helical structure without lipid addition and had much greater lipid-binding capacity than the recombinant α-synuclein studied heretofore. Whereas recombinantly expressed monomers readily aggregated into amyloid-like fibrils in vitro, native human tetramers underwent little or no amyloid-like aggregation. On the basis of these findings, we propose that destabilization of the helically folded tetramer precedes α-synuclein misfolding and aggregation in Parkinson's disease and other human synucleinopathies, and that small molecules that stabilize the physiological tetramer could reduce α-synuclein pathogenicity."
https://openalex.org/W2034676897,"The human capacity to recognize complex visual patterns emerges in a sequence of brain areas known as the ventral stream, beginning with primary visual cortex (V1). We developed a population model for mid-ventral processing, in which nonlinear combinations of V1 responses are averaged in receptive fields that grow with eccentricity. To test the model, we generated novel forms of visual metamers, stimuli that differ physically but look the same. We developed a behavioral protocol that uses metameric stimuli to estimate the receptive field sizes in which the model features are represented. Because receptive field sizes change along the ventral stream, our behavioral results can identify the visual area corresponding to the representation. Measurements in human observers implicate visual area V2, providing a new functional account of neurons in this area. The model also explains deficits of peripheral vision known as crowding, and provides a quantitative framework for assessing the capabilities and limitations of everyday vision."
https://openalex.org/W1971060242,"Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is independent of actin dynamics in many circumstances but requires actin polymerization in others. We show that membrane tension determines the actin dependence of clathrin-coat assembly. As found previously, clathrin assembly supports formation of mature coated pits in the absence of actin polymerization on both dorsal and ventral surfaces of non-polarized mammalian cells, and also on basolateral surfaces of polarized cells. Actin engagement is necessary, however, to complete membrane deformation into a coated pit on apical surfaces of polarized cells and, more generally, on the surface of any cell in which the plasma membrane is under tension from osmotic swelling or mechanical stretching. We use these observations to alter actin dependence experimentally and show that resistance of the membrane to propagation of the clathrin lattice determines the distinction between 'actin dependent and 'actin independent'. We also find that light-chain-bound Hip1R mediates actin engagement. These data thus provide a unifying explanation for the role of actin dynamics in coated-pit budding."
https://openalex.org/W1993608360,"Supergenes are tight clusters of loci that facilitate the co-segregation of adaptive variation, providing integrated control of complex adaptive phenotypes. Polymorphic supergenes, in which specific combinations of traits are maintained within a single population, were first described for 'pin' and 'thrum' floral types in Primula and Fagopyrum, but classic examples are also found in insect mimicry and snail morphology. Understanding the evolutionary mechanisms that generate these co-adapted gene sets, as well as the mode of limiting the production of unfit recombinant forms, remains a substantial challenge. Here we show that individual wing-pattern morphs in the polymorphic mimetic butterfly Heliconius numata are associated with different genomic rearrangements at the supergene locus P. These rearrangements tighten the genetic linkage between at least two colour-pattern loci that are known to recombine in closely related species, with complete suppression of recombination being observed in experimental crosses across a 400-kilobase interval containing at least 18 genes. In natural populations, notable patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) are observed across the entire P region. The resulting divergent haplotype clades and inversion breakpoints are found in complete association with wing-pattern morphs. Our results indicate that allelic combinations at known wing-patterning loci have become locked together in a polymorphic rearrangement at the P locus, forming a supergene that acts as a simple switch between complex adaptive phenotypes found in sympatry. These findings highlight how genomic rearrangements can have a central role in the coexistence of adaptive phenotypes involving several genes acting in concert, by locally limiting recombination and gene flow."
https://openalex.org/W2038011147,"CD4(+) T-helper type 2 (T(H)2) cells, characterized by their expression of interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-9 and IL-13, are required for immunity to helminth parasites and promote the pathological inflammation associated with asthma and allergic diseases. Polymorphisms in the gene encoding the cytokine thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) are associated with the development of multiple allergic disorders in humans, indicating that TSLP is a critical regulator of T(H)2 cytokine-associated inflammatory diseases. In support of genetic analyses, exaggerated TSLP production is associated with asthma, atopic dermatitis and food allergies in patients, and studies in murine systems demonstrated that TSLP promotes T(H)2 cytokine-mediated immunity and inflammation. However, the mechanisms through which TSLP induces T(H)2 cytokine responses remain poorly defined. Here we demonstrate that TSLP promotes systemic basophilia, that disruption of TSLP-TSLPR interactions results in defective basophil responses, and that TSLPR-sufficient basophils can restore T(H)2-cell-dependent immunity in vivo. TSLP acted directly on bone-marrow-resident progenitors to promote basophil responses selectively. Critically, TSLP could elicit basophil responses in both IL-3-IL-3R-sufficient and -deficient environments, and genome-wide transcriptional profiling and functional analyses identified heterogeneity between TSLP-elicited versus IL-3-elicited basophils. Furthermore, activated human basophils expressed TSLPR, and basophils isolated from eosinophilic oesophagitis patients were distinct from classical basophils. Collectively, these studies identify previously unrecognized heterogeneity within the basophil cell lineage and indicate that expression of TSLP may influence susceptibility to multiple allergic diseases by regulating basophil haematopoiesis and eliciting a population of functionally distinct basophils that promote T(H)2 cytokine-mediated inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2067056027,"Pluripotent stem cells exist in naive and primed states, epitomized by mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and the developmentally more advanced epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs; ref. 1). In the naive state of ESCs, the genome has an unusual open conformation and possesses a minimum of repressive epigenetic marks. In contrast, EpiSCs have activated the epigenetic machinery that supports differentiation towards the embryonic cell types. The transition from naive to primed pluripotency therefore represents a pivotal event in cellular differentiation. But the signals that control this fundamental differentiation step remain unclear. We show here that paracrine and autocrine Wnt signals are essential self-renewal factors for ESCs, and are required to inhibit their differentiation into EpiSCs. Moreover, we find that Wnt proteins in combination with the cytokine LIF are sufficient to support ESC self-renewal in the absence of any undefined factors, and support the derivation of new ESC lines, including ones from non-permissive mouse strains. Our results not only demonstrate that Wnt signals regulate the naive-to-primed pluripotency transition, but also identify Wnt as an essential and limiting ESC self-renewal factor."
https://openalex.org/W2047824477,"An important risk in the clinical application of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), including human embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells (hESCs and hiPSCs), is teratoma formation by residual undifferentiated cells. We raised a monoclonal antibody against hESCs, designated anti-stage-specific embryonic antigen (SSEA)-5, which binds a previously unidentified antigen highly and specifically expressed on hPSCs--the H type-1 glycan. Separation based on SSEA-5 expression through fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) greatly reduced teratoma-formation potential of heterogeneously differentiated cultures. To ensure complete removal of teratoma-forming cells, we identified additional pluripotency surface markers (PSMs) exhibiting a large dynamic expression range during differentiation: CD9, CD30, CD50, CD90 and CD200. Immunohistochemistry studies of human fetal tissues and bioinformatics analysis of a microarray database revealed that concurrent expression of these markers is both common and specific to hPSCs. Immunodepletion with antibodies against SSEA-5 and two additional PSMs completely removed teratoma-formation potential from incompletely differentiated hESC cultures."

https://openalex.org/W2065621982,"Activated Ras oncogene induces DNA-damage response by triggering reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and this is critical for oncogene-induced senescence. Until now, little connections between oncogene expression, ROS-generating NADPH oxidases and DNA-damage response have emerged from different studies. Here we report that H-RasV12 positively regulates the NADPH oxidase system NOX4-p22phox that produces H2O2. Knocking down the NADPH oxidase with small interference RNA decreases H-RasV12-induced DNA-damage response detected by γ-H2A.X foci analysis. Using HyPer, a specific probe for H2O2, we detected an increase in H2O2 in the nucleus correlated with NOX4-p22phox perinuclear localization. DNA damage response can be caused not only by H-RasV12-driven accumulation of ROS but also by a replicative stress due to a sustained oncogenic signal. Interestingly, NOX4 downregulation by siRNA abrogated H-RasV12 regulation of CDC6 expression, an essential regulator of DNA replication. Moreover, senescence markers, such as senescence-associated heterochromatin foci, PML bodies, HP1β foci and p21 expression, induced under H-RasV12 activation were decreased with NOX4 inactivation. Taken together, our data indicate that NADPH oxidase NOX4 is a critical mediator in oncogenic H-RasV12-induced DNA-damage response and subsequent senescence."
https://openalex.org/W2052152283,"Srivastava and colleagues find that membrane-bound Notch associates with and negatively regulates active β-catenin in embryonic stem cells, cardiac progenitors and colon cancer cells. This ligand-independent effect of Notch requires the endocytic adaptor protein Numb and targeting of β-catenin to lysosomes. Cellular decisions of self-renewal or differentiation arise from integration and reciprocal titration of numerous regulatory networks. Notch and Wnt/β-catenin signalling often intersect in stem and progenitor cells and regulate each other transcriptionally. The biological outcome of signalling through each pathway often depends on the context and timing as cells progress through stages of differentiation. Here, we show that membrane-bound Notch physically associates with unphosphorylated (active) β-catenin in stem and colon cancer cells and negatively regulates post-translational accumulation of active β-catenin protein. Notch-dependent regulation of β-catenin protein did not require ligand-dependent membrane cleavage of Notch or the glycogen synthase kinase- 3β-dependent activity of the β-catenin destruction complex. It did, however, require the endocytic adaptor protein Numb and lysosomal activity. This study reveals a previously unrecognized function of Notch in negatively titrating active β-catenin protein levels in stem and progenitor cells."

https://openalex.org/W2061780077,"E2F is known to regulate the cell cycle, but Fajas and colleagues now show that E2F acts as a switch to allow cells to adapt to stressful metabolic conditions. Under basal conditions, E2F promotes cell-cycle progression and represses transcription of genes required for mitochondrial oxidative metabolism; however, this repression is alleviated on energy starvation. Cells respond to stress by coordinating proliferative and metabolic pathways. Starvation restricts cell proliferative (glycolytic) and activates energy productive (oxidative) pathways. Conversely, cell growth and proliferation require increased glycolytic and decreased oxidative metabolism levels1. E2F transcription factors regulate both proliferative and metabolic genes2,3. E2Fs have been implicated in the G1/S cell-cycle transition, DNA repair, apoptosis, development and differentiation2,3,4. In pancreatic β-cells, E2F1 gene regulation facilitated glucose-stimulated insulin secretion5,6. Moreover, mice lacking E2F1 (E2f1−/−) were resistant to diet-induced obesity4. Here, we show that E2F1 coordinates cellular responses by acting as a regulatory switch between cell proliferation and metabolism. In basal conditions, E2F1 repressed key genes that regulate energy homeostasis and mitochondrial functions in muscle and brown adipose tissue. Consequently, E2f1−/− mice had a marked oxidative phenotype. An association between E2F1 and pRB was required for repression of genes implicated in oxidative metabolism. This repression was alleviated in a constitutively active CDK4 (CDK4R24C) mouse model or when adaptation to energy demand was required. Thus, E2F1 represents a metabolic switch from oxidative to glycolytic metabolism that responds to stressful conditions."

They find that rodent secondary motor cortex might be uniquely involved in both representing and reading out value signals for flexible action selection. Despite widespread neural activity related to reward values, signals related to upcoming choice have not been clearly identified in the rodent brain. Here we examined neuronal activity in the lateral (AGl) and medial (AGm) agranular cortex, corresponding to the primary and secondary motor cortex, respectively, in rats performing a dynamic foraging task. Choice signals, before behavioral manifestation of the rat's choice, arose in the AGm earlier than in any other areas of the rat brain previously studied under free-choice conditions. The AGm also conveyed neural signals for decision value and chosen value. By contrast, upcoming choice signals arose later, and value signals were weaker, in the AGl. We also found that AGm lesions made the rats' choices less dependent on dynamically updated values. These results suggest that rodent secondary motor cortex might be uniquely involved in both representing and reading out value signals for flexible action selection."
https://openalex.org/W2014812461,"MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that mediate post-transcriptional gene silencing. Fear-extinction learning in C57/Bl6J mice led to increased expression of the brain-specific microRNA miR-128b, which disrupted stability of several plasticity-related target genes and regulated formation of fear-extinction memory. Increased miR-128b activity may therefore facilitate the transition from retrieval of the original fear memory toward the formation of a new fear-extinction memory."
https://openalex.org/W2035289883,"Sirtuin deacetylases and FOXO (Forkhead box, class O) transcription factors have important roles in many biological pathways, including cancer development. SIRT1 and SIRT2 deacetylate FOXO factors to regulate FOXO function. Because acetylation and ubiquitination both modify the ɛ-amino group of lysine residues, we investigated whether FOXO3 deacetylation by SIRT1 or SIRT2 facilitates FOXO3 ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. We found that SIRT1 and SIRT2 promote FOXO3 poly-ubiquitination and degradation. Proteasome-inhibitor treatment prevented sirtuin-induced FOXO3 degradation, indicating that this process is proteasome dependent. In addition, we demonstrated that E3 ubiquitin ligase subunit Skp2 binds preferentially to deacetylated FOXO3. Overexpression of Skp2 caused poly-ubiquitination of FOXO3 and degradation, whereas knockdown of Skp2 increased the amount of FOXO3 protein. We also present evidence that SCF-Skp2 ubiquitinates FOXO3 directly in vitro. Furthermore, mutating four known acetylated lysine residues (K242, K259, K290 and K569) of FOXO3 into arginines to mimic deacetylated FOXO3 resulted in enhanced Skp2 binding but with inhibition of FOXO3 ubiquitination; this suggests that some or all of these four lysine residues are likely the sites for ubiquitination. In the livers of mice deficient in SIRT1, we detected increased expression of FOXO3, indicating SIRT1 regulates FOXO3 protein levels in vivo. Furthermore, we found that the elevation of SIRT1 and Skp2 expression in malignant PC3 and DU145 prostate cells is responsible for the downregulation of FOXO3 protein levels in these cells. Taken together, our data support the notion that deacetylation of FOXO3 by SIRT1 or SIRT2 facilitates Skp2-mediated FOXO3 poly-ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation."

https://openalex.org/W1972465938,"Sustained JNK activation plays a critical role in hepatotoxicity by acetaminophen or GalN/TNF-α. To address the importance of JNK translocation to mitochondria that accompanies sustained activation in these models, we assessed the importance of the expression of a potential initial target of JNK in the outer membrane of mitochondria, namely Sab (SH3 domain-binding protein that preferentially associates with Btk), also known as Sh3bp5 (SH3 domain-binding protein 5). Silencing the expression of Sab in the liver using adenoviral shRNA inhibited sustained JNK activation and mitochondrial targeting of JNK and the upstream MKK4 (MAPK kinase 4), accompanied by striking protection against liver injury in vivo and in cultured hepatocytes in both toxicity models. We conclude that mitochondrial Sab may serve as a platform for the MAPK pathway enzymes and that the interaction of stress-activated JNK with Sab is required for sustained JNK activation and toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W1978039711,"Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a liver-secreted endocrine factor with multiple beneficial effects on obesity-related disorders. It enhances glucose uptake by inducing the expression of glucose transporter-1 (GLUT1) in adipocytes. Here we investigated the signaling pathways that mediate FGF21-induced GLUT1 expression and glucose uptake in vitro and in animals. Quantitative real-time PCR and a luciferase reporter assay showed that FGF21 induced GLUT1 expression through transcriptional activation. The truncation of the GLUT1 promoter from −3145 to −3105 bp, which contains two highly conserved serum response element (SRE) and E-Twenty Six (ETS) binding motif, dramatically decreased FGF21-induced promoter activity of the GLUT1 gene. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that the transcription factors serum response factor (SRF) and Ets-like protein-1 (Elk-1) were recruited to the GLUT1 promoter upon FGF21 stimulation. The siRNA-mediated knockdown of either SRF or Elk-1 resulted in a marked attenuation in FGF21-induced GLUT1 expression and glucose uptake in adipocytes. In C57 lean mice, a single intravenous injection of FGF21 induced phosphorylation of Elk-1 at Ser383 and SRF at Ser103 and also led to the recruitment of Elk-1 and SRF to the GLUT1 promoter in epididymal fats. By contrast, such effects of in vivo FGF21 administration were blunted in high fat diet-induced obese mice. In conclusion, FGF21 induces GLUT1 expression and glucose uptake through sequential activation of ERK1/2 and SRF/Elk-1, which in turn triggers the transcriptional activation of GLUT1 in adipocytes.

In both 3T3-L1 adipocytes and human primary adipocytes, FGF21 stimulates glucose uptake in an insulin-independent manner, possibly by up-regulating the GLUT1 expression (3Kharitonenkov A.

In addition, chronic treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with FGF21 induces the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1 (SirT1) (15Wang H.

However, the receptor and post-receptor signaling events that mediate the metabolic actions of FGF21 in adipocytes remain poorly characterized. Due to a lack of the heparin binding property, FGF21 itself is not sufficient to bind the classical FGF21 receptors but requires the recruitment of the single-pass transmembrane protein β-klotho as a co-receptor (19Ogawa Y.

However, in contrary to in vitro data, a recent report on β-klotho knock-out mice suggests that it is not essential for FGF21 signaling in adipose tissues in vivo (23Tomiyama K. Maeda R. Urakawa I. Yamazaki Y. Tanaka T. Ito S. Nabeshima Y. Tomita T. Odori S. Hosoda K. Nakao K. Imura A. Nabeshima Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 1666-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). To elucidate the missing molecular links between FGF21 stimulation and its metabolic actions, the present study investigated the intracellular signaling pathways and transcriptional events that underlie FGF21-stimulated GLUT1 expression and glucose uptake in adipocytes. In addition, explant studies on adipose tissue from both lean mice and obese mice were also performed to evaluate whether the signaling pathways leading to FGF21-induced glucose uptake are altered by diet-induced obesity. The antibodies against the phospho-ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204) and total ERK1/2, phospho-AMPK (Thr172) and total AMPK, phospho-Akt (Ser473), total Akt, phospho-Elk-1 (Ser383), phospho-SRF (Ser103), rabbit horseradish peroxidase and, chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) grade protein G beads were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). The antibodies against Ets-like protein-1 (Elk-1) and serum response factor (SRF) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Delaware, CA). The siRNA against β-klotho, SRF, Elk-1, and scrambled siRNA were from Ribobio (Guangzhou, China). TRIzol reagent, SYBR Green, and DMEM culture medium were purchased from Invitrogen. Superscript first-strand cDNA synthesis system was obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). The pGL3-Basic vector was obtained from Promega. The ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 was obtained from Sigma and dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Endotoxin-free tagless recombinant FGF21 was provided by Antibody and Immunoassay Services (AIS), the University of Hong Kong. The 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (ATCC; CL-173TM) were maintained in high glucose (4.5 g/liter) DMEM containing 10% FBS. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were seeded at the density of 1 × 105/well in a 6-well plate. Differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells were initiated at 2 days post-confluent cells by the addition of 5 μg/ml insulin, 0.25 mm dexamethasone, and 0.5 mm isobutylmethylxanthine for 2 days and subsequently replaced by DMEM, 10% FBS supplemented only with 5 μg/ml insulin for a further 2 days before replacing it with normal culture medium. Thereafter, the cells were cultured for an additional 2–3 days in DMEM with 10% FBS. Adipocytes were seeded at 2.5 × 105/well in 12-well plate 1 day before the assay. The cells were starved for 24 h in DMEM plus 0.5% FBS followed by stimulation with FGF21 for another 24 h. After that, the cells were switched to glucose-free DMEM medium plus FGF21 for 4 h. Then the adipocytes were washed twice with KRP buffer (15 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 118 mm NaCl, 4.8 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 0.1% BSA), and 500 μl of fresh KRP buffer containing 2-deoxy-d-[3H]glucose (0.1 μCi, 100 μm) was added to each well. Cytochalasin B (20 μm) was used to determine the nonspecific absorption. The glucose uptake reaction was carried out for 1 h at 37 °C, and the cells were lysed with 0.1 m NaOH and neutralized by an equal amount of HCl. The radioactivity was analyzed by liquid scintillation counting. The mouse GLUT1 promoter region spanning −3710 to −49 bp was amplified by PCR using mouse genomic DNA as a template and then subcloned into pGL3-Basic vector to obtain the luciferase reporter vector driven by the 3.7-kb GLUT1 promoter. The putative serum response element (SRE) and E-Twenty Six (ETS) binding site within the promoter region were mutated by mutagenesis PCR using their wild type vectors as the templates. The constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The sequences of all the primers used for the vector construction are listed in supplemental Table 1. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were seeded at 1 × 105/well in 12-well plates 24 h before transfection with the luciferase reporters using JetPEI (Poluplus) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were then subjected to differentiation induction as described above followed by treatment with various concentrations of FGF21 for 24 h. After that, cells were lysed in a reporter lysis buffer, and the luciferase activity was measured using Bright-GloTM Luciferase Assay System (Promega) as described (24Xu A. Wong L.C. Wang Y. Xu J.Y. Cooper G.J. Lam K.S. FEBS Lett. 2004; 572: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The siRNA was introduced into cells by electroporation using Genepulser Xcell (Bio-Rad). The siRNA sequences used in this study are listed in supplemental Table 2. Total RNA from 3T3-L1 adipocytes was purified with a TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). For reverse transcription, 1 μg of the total RNA was converted to first-strand complementary DNA in 20 μl reactions using a cDNA synthesis kit (Qiagen). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed with SYBR Green PCR MasterMix (Promega) on an Applied Biosystems Prism 7000 sequence detection system. Analysis was performed with ABI Prism 7000 SDS Software and normalized against 18S RNA. Primer sequences used for real time PCR are listed in supplemental Table 3. The ChIP assay was performed as described (25Wang Q.F. Lauring J. Schlissel M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9203-9211Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. 80–90% confluent 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with or without FGF21 for various periods followed by fixation with 1% formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were lysed, and chromatin was sheared by sonication at 4 °C. 25 μg of the lysates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 2 μg of anti-SRF antibody or anti-Elk-1 antibody or rabbit non-immune IgG as the negative control followed by precipitation with ChIP grade protein G beads. The precipitates were washed extensively and eluted with the elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3) at room temperature for 15 min. Input chromatin and immunoprecipitated chromatin were incubated at 65 °C overnight to reverse the cross-links. After digestion with protease K, DNA was extracted with phenol-chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. Purified DNA was analyzed by quantitative real time PCR using primers specific to GLUT1 promoter listed in supplemental Table 3. All results were normalized to the respective input values. 30 μg of 3T3-L1 lysates were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and probed with various primary antibodies as specified in each figure legend. The proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence detection. The relative intensity of the protein bands was quantified using the Multi Analyst software package (Bio-Rad) as described (26Hui X.

One day before the experiment mice were fasted for 16 h (from 5:30 p.m. to 9:30 a.m.) followed by a single intravenous injection of recombinant FGF21 (1.5 μg/100 g of body weight) or PBS as a control. At various time points after the injection, epididymal adipose tissues were collected from mice immediately after anesthesia, weighed, homogenized, and then subjected to either Western blot analysis or fixed with 1% formaldehyde. The chromatin in epididymal adipose tissue was sheared and subjected to ChIP analysis to detect the binding of Elk-1 and SRF to the endogenous GLUT1 gene as described above. All animal experimental protocols were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the University of Hong Kong. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.D. Statistical significance was determined by one-way analysis of variance or Student's t test. In all statistical comparisons p value <0.05 was used to indicate a significant difference. Consistent with previous reports (3Kharitonenkov A. Shiyanova T.L. Koester A. Ford A.M. Micanovic R. Galbreath E.J. Sandusky G.E. Hammond L.J. Moyers J.S. Owens R.A. Gromada J. Brozinick J.T.

Incubation of cells with 15 μg/ml FGF21 for 24 h increased glucose uptake by 3.5-fold, a magnitude equivalent to that of insulin (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, an additive effect between FGF21 and insulin on stimulation of glucose uptake was observed, confirming that these two hormones act through different pathways in adipocytes. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that FGF21 increased the expression of GLUT1 but had little effect on GLUT4 (Fig. 1C). FGF21-stimulated elevation of GLUT1 mRNA expression was completely abolished by pretreatment of cells with the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D (Fig. 1D), suggesting that FGF21 induces GLUT1 gene through transcriptional activation instead of mRNA stabilization at the posttranscriptional level. In adipocytes, FGF21 has been shown to activate several protein kinase cascades, including ERK1/2 MAP kinase (3Kharitonenkov A. Shiyanova T.L. Koester A. Ford A.M. Micanovic R. Galbreath E.J.

U.S.A. 2010; 107: 12553-12558Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). We next investigated which of these protein kinases were involved in FGF21-induced GLUT1 expression and glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with 2 μg/ml FGF21 induced the activation of both ERK1/2 and Akt, as determined by Western blot analysis for phosphorylation at their activation sites (Fig. 2, A and B). However, we did not observe any change in phosphorylation of AMPK at its activation site Thr172 (Fig. 2C). FGF21-induced up-regulation of GLUT1 and elevation of glucose uptake were markedly attenuated by the ERK1/2 specific inhibitor PD98059 (25 μm) (Fig. 2, D and E) but not the Akt inhibitor AktI-1 (Fig. 2F). In addition, the AMPK inhibitor compound C had little effect on FGF21-stimulated GLUT1 expression and glucose uptake (data not shown). Taken in conjunction, these findings suggest that ERK1/2 mediates the transcriptional activation of the GLUT1 gene by FGF21. To investigate how GLUT1 is transactivated by FGF21-induced ERK1/2 signaling cascade in detail, we constructed several luciferase reporter vectors driven by the 3.7, 2.7, and 1.7 kb of the mouse GLUT1 promoter, respectively (Fig. 3A). 3T3-L1 adipocytes were transfected with each of these reporter vectors followed by stimulation with various concentrations of FGF21 to monitor its effect on the promoter activity of GLUT1. This analysis demonstrated that the luciferase activity driven by the 3.7-kb GLUT1 promoter was elevated by ∼3-fold upon treatment with 2 μg/ml FGF21 for 24 h (Fig. 3B), whereas the response of the luciferase reporter vector containing both the 2.7- and 1.7-kb promoter was completely abolished (Fig. 3B), suggesting that the FGF21-responsive DNA elements are located within the −3.7 kb and −2.7-kb region. To identify the minimal cis-DNA element(s) that mediates the transactivation of GLUT1 by FGF21, we generated a panel of luciferase reporter vectors that contain progressively truncated GLUT1 promoter spanning −3.7 to −2.8 kb of the gene and evaluated their response to FGF21 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig. 3C). The luciferase assay result showed that a 40 bp DNA fragment spanning −3145 bp to −3105 bp of the GLUT1 promoter was indispensible for FGF21 caused gene transcription (Fig. 3D). We next analyzed potential transcription factor binding sites within this promoter region using both Mat Inspector (genomatix) and TF search programs (TFSEARCH). This bioinformatic analysis identified two adjacent putative DNA binding motifs that were identical to the consensus recognition sequences of ETS (CAGG(A/G)2) and SRE (CC(T/A)6) (Fig. 4A). DNA sequence alignment analysis demonstrated that these two recognition sites were highly conserved among several mammalian species examined. Noticeably, both ETS and SRE are responsive to ERK1/2 (28Treisman R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 423-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the two putative SRE and ETS recognition sites were indeed critical cis-elements responsible for FGF21-induced transactivation of the GLUT1 gene, we generated two mutant luciferase reporter vectors, 3.7kbmu-luc (SRE) and 3.7kbmu-luc (ETS), in which two nucleotides within each of the consensus binding motifs were mutated (Fig. 4B). In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, the luciferase activities driven by either 3.7kbmu-luc (SRE) or 3.7kbmu-luc (ETS) were slightly decreased compared to that driven by the wild type promoter under the basal condition (Fig. 4C). However, mutation in either one of these two putative SRE and ETS cis-elements completely abolished FGF21-induced increase in the luciferase activity, suggesting that both the putative SRE and ETS recognition motifs between −3128 and −3105 of the promoter are indispensible for FGF21-induced transactivation of the GLUT1 gene in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. SRF is a transcription factor that specifically recognizes the SRE and thereby turns on the transcription of the target genes (27Berglund E.D. Li C.Y. Bina H.A. Lynes S.E. Michael M.D. Shanafelt A.B.

Small molecule inhibitors of CHK proteins are under clinical evaluation in combination with chemotherapeutic agents known to induce DNA damage. We examined whether CHK inhibitors could be effective as single agents in malignant cells with inherent DNA damage because of deregulated expression of the oncogene c-Myc. Eμ-myc lymphoma cells showed a dramatic increase in the extent of DNA damage and DNA damage response (DDR) signalling within 1 h of treatment with CHK1 inhibitors followed by caspase-dependent apoptosis and cell death. In p53 wild-type/ARF null Eμ-myc lymphoma cells, apoptotic cell death was preceded by accumulation of DNA damage and the amount of DNA damage correlated with the extent of cell death. This effect was not observed in normal B cells indicating that DNA damage accumulation following CHK inhibition was specific to Eμ-myc lymphoma cells that exhibit inherent DNA damage because of MYC-induced replication stress. Similar results were obtained with another structurally distinct CHK-inhibitor. Eμ-myc p53 null lymphoma cells were more sensitive to a dual CHK1/CHK2 inhibitor than to a CHK1-specific inhibitor. In all cases, the level of DNA damage following treatment was the most consistent indicator of drug sensitivity. Our results suggest that CHK inhibitors would be beneficial therapeutic agents in MYC-driven cancers. We propose that inhibitors of CHK can act in a synthetically lethal manner in cancers with replication stress as a result of these cancers being reliant on CHK proteins for an effective DDR and cell survival."
https://openalex.org/W2054239953,"5-Fluorouracil (5-FU), together with other drugs such as oxaliplatin, is one of the most important pharmacological agents in the treatment of colorectal cancer. Although mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) have been extensively connected with resistance to platinum compounds, no role has been established in 5-FU resistance. Here we demonstrate that p38MAPK activation is a key determinant in the cellular response to 5-FU. Thus, inhibition of p38MAPKα by SB203580 compound or by short-hairpin RNA interference-specific knockdown correlates with a decrease in the 5-FU-associated apoptosis and chemical resistance in both HaCaT and HCT116 cells. Activation of p38MAPK by 5-FU was dependent on canonical MAP2K, MAPK kinase (MKK)-3 and MKK6. In addition, ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related (ATR) showed a redundancy of function for the final activation of p38MAPK. Resistance associated with p38MAPK inhibition correlates with an autophagic response that was mediated by a decrease in p53-driven apoptosis, without effect onto p53-dependent autophagy. Moreover, the results with colorectal cancer-derived cell lines with different p53 status and patterns of resistance to 5-FU suggest that de novo and acquired resistance was controlled by similar mechanisms. In summary, our data demonstrate a critical role for the p38MAPK signaling pathway in the cellular response to 5-FU by controlling the balance between apoptosis and autophagy."

With follow-up sequencing of an additional eight cases, they confirm ACSF3 as a cause of CMAMMA. They further report a canine model for CMAMMA that has a mutation in a putative ACSF3 ortholog. We used exome sequencing to identify the genetic basis of combined malonic and methylmalonic aciduria (CMAMMA). We sequenced the exome of an individual with CMAMMA and followed up with sequencing of eight additional affected individuals (cases). This included one individual who was identified and diagnosed by searching an exome database. We identify mutations in ACSF3, encoding a putative methylmalonyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA synthetase as a cause of CMAMMA. We also examined a canine model of CMAMMA, which showed pathogenic mutations in a predicted ACSF3 ortholog. ACSF3 mutant alleles occur with a minor allele frequency of 0.0058 in ∼1,000 control individuals, predicting a CMAMMA population incidence of ∼1:30,000. ACSF3 deficiency is the first human disorder identified as caused by mutations in a gene encoding a member of the acyl-CoA synthetase family, a diverse group of evolutionarily conserved proteins, and may emerge as one of the more common human metabolic disorders."

https://openalex.org/W2059119176,"Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) is a key enzyme for inactivation and metabolism of catechols, including dopamine, norepinephrine, caffeine, and estrogens. It plays an important role in cognition, arousal, pain sensitivity, and stress reactivity in humans and in animal models. The human COMT gene is associated with a diverse spectrum of human behaviors and diseases from cognition and psychiatric disorders to chronic pain and cancer. There are two major forms of COMT proteins, membrane-bound (MB) COMT and soluble (S) COMT. MB-COMT is the main form in the brain. The cellular distribution of MB-COMT in cortical neurons remains unclear and the orientation of MB-COMT on the cellular membrane is controversial. In this study, we demonstrate that MB-COMT is located in the cell body and in axons and dendrites of rat cortical neurons. Analyses of MB-COMT orientation with computer simulation, flow cytometry and a cell surface enzyme assay reveal that the C-terminal catalytic domain of MB-COMT is in the extracellular space, which suggests that MB-COMT can inactivate synaptic and extrasynaptic dopamine on the surface of presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons. Finally, we show that the COMT inhibitor tolcapone induces cell death via the mechanism of apoptosis, and its cytotoxicity is dependent on dosage and correlated with COMT Val/Met genotypes in human lymphoblastoid cells. These results suggest that MB-COMT specific inhibitors can be developed and that tolcapone may be less hazardous at low doses and in specific genetic backgrounds.

Analyses of MB-COMT orientation with computer simulation, flow cytometry and a cell surface enzyme assay reveal that the C-terminal catalytic domain of MB-COMT is in the extracellular space, which suggests that MB-COMT can inactivate synaptic and extrasynaptic dopamine on the surface of presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons. Finally, we show that the COMT inhibitor tolcapone induces cell death via the mechanism of apoptosis, and its cytotoxicity is dependent on dosage and correlated with COMT Val/Met genotypes in human lymphoblastoid cells. These results suggest that MB-COMT specific inhibitors can be developed and that tolcapone may be less hazardous at low doses and in specific genetic backgrounds. Genetic associations of the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) 2The abbreviations used are: COMTcatechol-O-methyltransferaseMB-COMTmembrane-bound COMTS-COMTsoluble COMTAdoMetS-adenosylmethionineR-PER-phycoerythrin. gene with a diverse spectrum of human behaviors and diseases from cognition and psychiatric disorders to chronic pain and to cancer have revived interest in COMT research (1Tan H.Y.

COMT is a critical enzyme required for inactivation and metabolism of dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, caffeine, estrogen, and other catechol compounds. The COMT gene encodes two major transcripts, the long and short transcripts (5Lundström K. Salminen M. Jalanko A. Savolainen R. Ulmanen I. DNA Cell Biol. 1991; 10: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The long transcript can be translated into two major isoforms of COMT, the membrane-bound (MB) and the soluble (S) forms. MB-COMT is the main form of COMT in the brain and is postulated to play an important role in modulating cortical dopamine signaling (6Matsumoto M. Weickert C.S. Akil M. Lipska B.K. Hyde T.M.

However, there is no MB-COMT specific inhibitor currently available for studying the roles of MB-COMT in dopamine-dependent brain functions. The only currently available COMT inhibitor that is permeable to the blood-brain barrier is tolcapone, an adjunct drug with l-DOPA (levodopa) for treatment of Parkinson disease (23Goetz C.G. Neurology. 1998; 50: S26-S30Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tolcapone inhibits both MB-COMT and S-COMT. Inhibition of the S-COMT may be at least in part, a reason for its liver toxicity, which has led to the complete withdrawal of tolcapone from the European market. Thus, it may be important to develop MB-COMT specific inhibitors. catechol-O-methyltransferase membrane-bound COMT soluble COMT S-adenosylmethionine R-phycoerythrin. The COMT gene sequence varies dramatically among species and COMT enzyme activity diminishes substantially in the course of evolution (17Chen J. Lipska B.K. Halim N. Ma Q.D. Matsumoto M. Melhem S.

The preponderance of MB-COMT in the primate brain relative to the rodent brain also suggests evolutionary refinement of COMT function in brain (17Chen J. Lipska B.K. Halim N. Ma Q.D. Matsumoto M.

A well characterized functional polymorphism, the Val-158–Met polymorphism, affects COMT enzyme activity in humans. The met allele, which is a human-specific mutation and possible even a modern human mutation (24Green R.E. Krause J. Briggs A.W. Maricic T. Stenzel U. Kircher M. Patterson N. Li H. Zhai W. Fritz M.H.

Other polymorphisms in the human COMT gene have also been shown to affect enzyme activity, mRNA levels, mRNA structure and to be associated with clinical phenotypes (17Chen J. Lipska B.K. Halim N.

Thus, it is reasonable to suspect that patients with different COMT genotypes might require individualized doses of catechol-based drugs including l-DOPA, consistent with a more personalized medicine strategy. One of the most extensively characterized roles of COMT is in cortically mediated cognition. More rapid inactivation of dopamine in prefrontal cortex, a brain region with virtually undetectable levels of dopamine transporters, has been postulated to be the mechanism for the poorer cognitive functions for human subjects with higher COMT activity. Microdialysis analysis of dopamine levels in COMT knock-out mice showed significant increases of dopamine overflow in the frontal cortex but not in the striatum including nucleus accumbens, key regions involved in substance abuse (7Käenmäki M. Tammimäki A. Myöhänen T. Pakarinen K. Amberg C. Karayiorgou M. Gogos J.A. Männistö P.T. J. Neurochem. 2010; 114: 1745-1755Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Similar results have been reported in PET studies of dopamine receptor occupancy in humans (28Slifstein M. Kolachana B. Simpson E.H. Tabares P. Cheng B. Duvall M. Frankle W.G. Weinberger D.R. Laruelle M. Abi-Dargham A. Mol. Psychiatry. 2008; 13: 821-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Thus, inhibition of COMT might be expected to improve dopamine mediated cortical cognition without causing addiction related behaviors linked to increased dopamine in the ventral striatum. Indeed, clinical studies with tocalpone suggest improvement of cortical function without striatal effects (29Apud J.A. Mattay V. Chen J. Kolachana B.S. Callicott J.H. Rasetti R. Alce G. Iudicello J.E. Akbar N. Egan M.F. Goldberg T.E. Weinberger D.R. Neuropsychopharmacology. 2007; 32: 1011-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Despite this wealth of information about the biochemistry and neurobiology of COMT, surprisingly little is known about the cell biology of MB-COMT. The cellular distribution and the orientation of MB-COMT on the cellular membrane of neurons including pyramidal neurons are controversial (11Grossman M.H. Creveling C.R. Rybczynski R. Braverman M.

Indeed, a recent study in mice proposed that MB-COMT is not localized to the cell membrane, suggesting that dopamine would have to be transported from outside the cell for it to be metabolized by COMT (30Myöhänen T.T. Schendzielorz N. Männistö P.T. J. Neurochem. 2010; 113: 1632-1643PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that MB-COMT is located in both the cell body and in axons and dendrites of rat cortical neurons. It co-localizes with secretegranin II, the lipid raft marker cholera toxin B, synaptotagmin, TGN 38, MAP2, Tau and PSD-95. The catalytic domain of MB-COMT is in the extracellular space of cortical neurons. Our functional analysis experiments reveal that higher levels of COMT activity will confer relative resistance to the cellular toxicity of tolcapone, particularly at moderate doses, suggesting that patients with COMT-Met genotypes might be especially susceptible to tolcapone toxicity. Human membrane-bound COMT (MB-COMT)-Val cDNA (GenbankTM accession no. BC011935) was subcloned into pEGFP-N1 and -C1 vectors (Clontech) to generate C-terminal and N-terminal tagged MB-COMT-GFP fusion genes, respectively. The orientation and open reading frames of the fusion constructs were confirmed by restriction enzyme site analyses and DNA sequencing. The fusion genes were introduced into primary neuronal or cell line cultures by transfection using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Whole cerebral cortex was dissected from embryonic day 18 Sprague-Dawley rats, dissociated in calcium- and magnesium-free Hanks' buffered salt solution containing 0.125% trypsin for 15 min, triturated in DMEM (Invitrogen)/10% FBS, and plated at 0.4 million cells per well in 6-well plates or 0.1 million cells per well per 24-well plates for immunostaining. Cells were grown at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and 95% humidity, first in 10% FBS/DMEM, followed 1 day later by serum-free medium and Neurobasal plus B27 (Invitrogen). Cultures were grown in serum-free medium for 10–12 days before the start of the experiments, and the medium was changed every 3 days. Fresh medium was applied 24 h before each experiment. These cultures yielded virtually all neurons. Blood was collected from normal subjects, and lymphocytes were transformed into lymphoblast cultures by standard Epstein-Barr virus transformation methods. Lymphocytes were selected from 20 individuals who were homozygous for each allele at the V158M locus (n = 10 per group, and the samples were matched by sex). The methods for recruitment and screening of volunteers are described in detail elsewhere (19Egan M.F. Goldberg T.E. Kolachana B.S. Callicott J.H. Mazzanti C.M. Straub R.E. Goldman D. Weinberger D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 6917-6922Crossref PubMed Scopus (2132) Google Scholar). The DNA collection protocol was approved by the NIMH institutional review board, and all donors gave informed consent. Low speed centrifugation was used to collect 100,000,000 cells. The cell pellets were lysed in 300 μl of 1× lysis buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.2% Triton X-100, and 1 mm DTT) with a sonicator. The total protein concentrations of the lysates were measured by the Bradford method. The mouse neuronblastoma 2A cell line was purchased from ATCC. The cell line is cultured in DMEM medium with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Primary cortical neurons were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4) and permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100. Cells were incubated with the following primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight: anti-TGN38 antibody (monoclonal, 1:500; BD Biosciences), anti-synaptophysin antibody (Roche Applied Science), anti-Tau antibody (Sigma), anti-MAP2 antibody (Sigma), anti-PSD-95 antibody (Sigma), and anti-secretegranin II antibody (SecII, polyclonal, 1:250; kindly provided by T. Watanabe) and then incubated with the appropriate TRITC-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:300; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) for 1 h at room temperature. Lipid raft was stained with fluorescein-labeled cholera toxin B (Invitrogen). The fluorescence images were captured by either a Cool SNAP CCD camera (Photometrics) mounted on an Olympus RX60 microscope or a Bio-Rad RTS2000 laser confocal microscope. The COMT enzyme activity assay uses the organic solvent extraction method that separates the radioactive product, the methylated catechol, and the free radioactive coenzyme, [3H]AdoMet (33Zürcher G. Da Prada M. J. Neurochem. 1982; 38: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Cells cultured in a six-well plate were homogenized in 1× lysis buffer. The cell lysates were centrifuged in a microcentrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 3 min. The supernatants were collected, and protein concentrations were determined. From each sample, 100 μg of the cell lysates at a concentration of 5 μg/μl was transferred to a fresh microcentrifuge tube and equilibrated to room temperature shortly before the enzyme assay. To each tube, we added 500 μl of the substrate mixture, which contained 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 1 mm MgCl2, 1.5 μCi of [3H]AdoMet, 10 μm of catechol, and 1 μm DTT. The tubes were then incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. The reactions were immediately terminated by the addition of 500 μl of 1 m HCl. The radioisotope-labeled catechol products from the reactions were extracted by adding 10 ml of scintillation fluid (Flow I (Molecular Diagnosis)) to the reaction mixture and then were measured for the radioactivity of the mixture in a scintillation counter. Relative COMT enzyme activity is presented as disintegrations per minute (dpm) per mg total protein. To establish a baseline control for nonspecific reactions that do not depend on COMT, 5 μl of the specific COMT inhibitor tolcapone (10 mg/ml) was added to a tube containing 100 μg of the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) sample. The high concentration of potent inhibitor blocked the specific reaction catalyzed by COMT, and the radioactivity from this reaction served as a baseline. To determine COMT activity on the cell surface, live cells in a six-well plate were rinsed with PBS twice and 500 μl of the substrate mixture, which contained 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 1 mm MgCl2, 1.5 μCi of [3H]AdoMet, 10 μm of catechol, 1 μm of DTT, and 0.8% NaCl, were added to each well. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min, and the reaction solution in each well was transferred to microcentrifuge tubes. The radioisotope-labeled catechol products from the reactions were extracted by adding 500 μl of 1 m HCl and 10 ml of scintillation fluid to the reaction mixture and then were measured for the radioactivity of the mixture in a scintillation counter. Because AdoMet does not penetrate the cell membrane, substrate methylation takes place on the cell surface and not intracellularly. To confirm that there is no reaction in the cytoplasm, the cells were attached on the six-well plate examined under a light microscope, and intracellular radioactivity was determined by lyzing the cells with 500 μl 1× lysis buffer and mixing the cell lysates with 500 μl of 1 m HCl, extracting with 10 ml of scintillation fluid (Flow I (Molecular Diagnosis)) and counting in scintillation counter. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS containing 2% BSA and incubated with phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-GFP antibody (Invitrogen) for 30 min on ice. After washing twice with cold PBS, cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS and analyzed using FACScan (BD Biosciences). CellQuest software (BD Biosciences) was used to acquire and quantify the fluorescence signal intensities. Neuoblastoma 2A cells transfected with COMT-GFP or GFP vector and human lymphoblastoid cells in 96-well plates were treated with different concentrations of tolcapone for 24 h. Control cells were treated with dimethyl sulfoxide and used as a baseline, 0% of cell death, or 100% cell survival, for calculations. Cell viability was measured using Cell Counting kit-8 (CCK-8) (Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Inc.). 10 μl of CCK-8 solution was added to each well and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The absorbance was measured at 450 nm with a DTX 880 Multimode detector (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA). Human lymphoblastoid cells were lyzed with a protease inhibitor Tris-glycerol extraction buffer (0.024% (4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride), 0.005% aprotinin, 0.001% leupeptin, 0.001% pepstatin A, 50% glycerol, and 0.6% Tris). The protein samples were prepared for immunoblotting by diluting the cell lysates with the lysis buffer and adding LDS sample buffer (1.25 μl of 4× buffer per sample) (Invitrogen). Samples were then heated to 90 °C for 5 min to denature proteins. For each sample, 5 μl was loaded onto precast 10% Bis-Tris polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen), and proteins were separated by electrophoresis at 175 V for 0.5 h by use of a single power source. Each gel contained a molecular weight marker ladder (SeeBlue Plus 2 (Invitrogen)) and pooled samples from controls, which were used for normalization in triplicate. Seven separate gels were used in one experiment. Gels were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes for 2 h at room temperature at 85 V in NuPAGE transfer buffer with 20% methanol. Membranes were blocked for 1 h in 10% goat serum in TBS with 0.1% Tween-20 (TBS-T) and then were incubated with the polyclonal rabbit anti-human caspase-3 antibody (1:500 dilution (Santa Cruz Biotechnology (catalog no. SC-7148))) or anti-human COMT antibody (Chemicon). Blots were rinsed in TBS-T, incubated in a peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (1:1,000 dilution (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)) for 2 h in 5% normal goat serum in TBS-T and rinsed in TBS-T. Blots were developed in ECL Plus (Amersham Biosciences) and were exposed to Kodak BioMax film. Films were digitized using a scanner, and the resulting images were analyzed using National Institutes of Health Image gel plotting macros on a Macintosh computer. The values for all samples were expressed as a percentage of a mean of controls on the same gel. Paired two-tailed t tests and analysis of variance tests were used to analyze the data of cell survival after tolcapone treatment and the data of COMT enzyme activities and protein levels in human lymphoblastoid cells To identify whether MB-COMT is located in specific cell regions or compartments, we stained rat cortical neurons in primary neuronal cultures with anti-COMT antibody and anti-cellular markers antibodies (Fig. 1). Our results showed that MB-COMT is co-localized with secretegranin II (Fig. 1A), which suggests that COMT is packaged and sorted into secretory vesicles. The MB-COMT is also co-localized with a lipid raft stained with fluorescein-labeled cholera toxin B (Fig. 1B), implicating that MB-COMT is located in the more stable membrane region with a higher density of receptors. The MB-COMT is also co-localized with synaptotagmin (Fig. 1C), which suggests that it also localizes at the synapse of presynaptic neurons. MB-COMT is also co-localized with TGN38 (Fig. 1D), suggesting that it is processed and packaged at the Golgi apparatus. MB-COMT is also co-localized with MAP2, Tau, and PSD-95 (Fig. 1, E–G), which further suggests that it is located in dendrites and axons of neurons and synapses of postsynaptic neurons. Because MB-COMT is relatively evenly distributed across the neuron cell body and dendrites, it likely plays a role in elimination of not only synaptic but also diffused dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, and potentially other catechols. The orientation of MB-COMT in the cell membrane is critical for the mechanism of synaptic and diffused dopamine inactivation. If the C terminus, which contains the catalytic domain, is oriented toward the inside of the neuron, extracellular dopamine has to taken up by a transporter or internalized by endocytosis before it can be inactivated by MB-COMT. If the C terminus is oriented toward the extracellular space, then synaptic dopamine is likely inactivated directly by MB-COMT. To identify the orientation of MB-COMT, we first used the computer program PRE-TMR2 (34Pasquier C. Hamodrakas S.J. Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 631-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) to analyze MB-COMT amino acid sequences (Fig. 2A). The results showed that the hydrophobic sequence located between the seventh and the 26th amino acids is the transmembrane domain of the MB-COMT, and it is a type II transmembrane protein with the C terminus outside of the membrane (Fig. 2B). The accuracy of the prediction is ∼98%. As mentioned above, the accuracy of the computer prediction is not 100%. To determine the orientation of the MB-COMT by experimentation, a GFP tag was added alternatively to the C terminus and the N terminus of MB-COMT to create the fusion constructs MB-COMT-GFP and GFP-MB-COMT, respectively (Fig. 3). Human lymphoblastoid cells transfected with the fusion constructs and their vector controls were stained with anti-GFP antibody conjugated with R-phycoerythrin (R-PE), sorted, and counted by flow cytometry. Our results showed that only the C-terminal GFP tag (Fig. 3A) but not N-terminal GFP (Fig. 3B) is detected by this antibody. This finding indicates that the C terminus of MB-COMT is outside of the cell and the catalytic domain in the C-terminal region is in the extracellular space. To further test whether the catalytic domain is in the extracellular space, we used a modified COMT enzyme assay to detect COMT enzyme activity on the surface of neuroblastoma 2A cells transfected with the C-terminal GFP MB-COMT or vector. The modified COMT assay utilizes the impermeability property of AdoMet to the cell membrane so that only extracellular COMT activity on the surface of intact live cells is measured. Our results showed that high levels of COMT enzyme activity on the cell surfaces were detected (Fig. 4), which further confirms that the catalytic domain of the MB-COMT is extracellular. The high level of enzyme activity in MB-COMT-GFP transfected cells suggests that the GFP tag at the C terminus of the MB-COMT did not disrupt COMT enzyme activity. The surface enzyme activity from the cells transfected with vector reveals that unmodified MB-COMT from the endogenous COMT gene has the same orientation as the MB-COMT-GFP protein, which excludes the possibility of an artifact from the fusion GFP tag. Moreover, we detected very low enzyme activity inside the cells with our modified COMT assay, suggesting that this assay can be used to screen specific COMT inhibitors that only inhibit MB-COMT. The toxicity of tolcapone is the key reason for its limited clinical use even though it causes liver necrosis in only a small minority of patients. Because human COMT-Val protein has higher enzyme activity than human COMT-Met protein, there may be differences in the sensitivity to tocalpone toxicity between patients carrying alternative genotypes.

https://openalex.org/W2007650925,"Inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS), a major mediator of inflammation, plays an important role in obesity-induced insulin resistance. Inhibition of iNOS by gene disruption or pharmacological inhibitors reverses or ameliorates obesity-induced insulin resistance in skeletal muscle and liver in mice. It is unknown, however, whether increased expression of iNOS is sufficient to cause insulin resistance in vivo. To address this issue, we generated liver-specific iNOS transgenic (L-iNOS-Tg) mice, where expression of the transgene, iNOS, is regulated under mouse albumin promoter. L-iNOS-Tg mice exhibited mild hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, and impaired insulin-induced suppression of hepatic glucose output, as compared with wild type (WT) littermates. Insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and -2, and Akt was significantly attenuated in liver, but not in skeletal muscle, of L-iNOS-Tg mice relative to WT mice without changes in insulin receptor phosphorylation. Moreover, liver-specific iNOS expression abrogated insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3β, forkhead box O1, and mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), endogenous substrates of Akt, along with increased S-nitrosylation of Akt relative to WT mice. However, the expression of insulin receptor, IRS-1, IRS-2, Akt, glycogen synthase kinase-3β, forkhead box O1, protein-tyrosine phosphatase-1B, PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog), and p85 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase was not altered by iNOS transgene. Hyperglycemia was associated with elevated glycogen phosphorylase activity and decreased glycogen synthase activity in the liver of L-iNOS-Tg mice, whereas phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, glucose-6-phosphatase, and proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α expression were not altered. These results clearly indicate that selective expression of iNOS in liver causes hepatic insulin resistance along with deranged insulin signaling, leading to hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia.

https://openalex.org/W2159918368,"Desmoglein-2 (Dsg2) is a desmosomal cadherin that is aberrantly expressed in human skin carcinomas. In addition to its well-known role in mediating intercellular desmosomal adhesion, Dsg2 regulates mitogenic signaling that may promote cancer development and progression. However, the mechanisms by which Dsg2 activates these signaling pathways and the relative contribution of its signaling and adhesion functions in tumor progression are poorly understood. In this study we show that Dsg2 associates with caveolin-1 (Cav-1), the major protein of specialized membrane microdomains called caveolae, which functions in both membrane protein turnover and intracellular signaling. Sequence analysis revealed that Dsg2 contains a putative Cav-1-binding motif. A permeable competing peptide resembling the Cav-1 scaffolding domain bound to Dsg2, disrupted normal Dsg2 staining and interfered with the integrity of epithelial sheets in vitro. Additionally, we observed that Dsg2 is proteolytically processed; resulting in a 95-kDa ectodomain shed product and a 65-kDa membrane-spanning fragment, the latter of which localizes to lipid rafts along with full-length Dsg2. Disruption of lipid rafts shifted Dsg2 to the non-raft fractions, leading to the accumulation of these proteins. Interestingly, Dsg2 proteolytic products are elevated in vivo in skin tumors from transgenic mice overexpressing Dsg2. Collectively, these data are consistent with the possibility that accumulation of truncated Dsg2 protein interferes with desmosome assembly and/or maintenance to disrupt cell-cell adhesion. Furthermore, the association of Dsg2 with Cav-1 may provide a mechanism for regulating mitogenic signaling and modulating the cell-surface presentation of an important adhesion molecule, both of which could contribute to malignant transformation and tumor progression."

A series of 2′-deoxyguanosine riboswitch structures reveals remodeling of the ligand-binding site and remote regions of the structure to accommodate the sugar moiety of the nucleoside substrate. Purine riboswitches have an essential role in genetic regulation of bacterial metabolism. This family includes the 2′-deoxyguanosine (dG) riboswitch, which is involved in feedback control of deoxyguanosine biosynthesis. To understand the principles that define dG selectivity, we determined crystal structures of the natural Mesoplasma florum riboswitch bound to cognate dG as well as to noncognate guanosine, deoxyguanosine monophosphate and guanosine monophosphate. Comparison with related purine riboswitch structures reveals that the dG riboswitch achieves its specificity through modification of key interactions involving the nucleobase and rearrangement of the ligand-binding pocket to accommodate the additional sugar moiety. In addition, we observe new conformational changes beyond the junctional binding pocket extending as far as peripheral loop-loop interactions. It appears that re-engineering riboswitch scaffolds will require consideration of selectivity features dispersed throughout the riboswitch tertiary fold, and structure-guided drug design efforts targeted to junctional RNA scaffolds need to be addressed within such an expanded framework."

Src-mediated tyrosine kinase signaling pathways promote pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) metastasis, though the molecular mechanisms supporting this invasive process are poorly understood and represent important and novel therapeutic targets. The large GTPase Dynamin 2 (Dyn2), a Src-kinase substrate, regulates membrane-cytoskeletal dynamics although it is yet to be defined if it contributes to tumor cell migration and invasion. Therefore, the goal of this study was to test if Dyn2 is upregulated in human pancreatic tumors and to define its role in cell migration and metastatic invasion using in vitro assays and nude mouse models. Histological analysis showed that 81% of 85 patients had elevated Dyn2 in PDAC. To test if Dyn2 overexpression alters metastatic properties of human pancreatic tumor cells, stable clones of BxPC-3 cells overexpressing either wild-type Dyn2 or a phosphorylation-deficient mutant Dyn2Y(231/597)F known to attenuate Dyn2 function, were generated and analyzed. Importantly, tumor cells overexpressing Dyn2 protruded lamellipodia at twice the rate, migrated faster (180%) and farther (2.5-fold greater distance) on glass and through transwell chambers (2-3-fold more cells through the filter) compared with cells expressing Dyn2Y(231/597)F or vector alone. Further, depletion of Dyn2 and dynamin inhibitors Myristyl trimethyl ammonium bromides and Dynasore significantly reduced cell migration, wound healing and invasion in transwell assays compared with controls. To test the metastatic potential conferred by increased Dyn2 expression, the BxPC-3 cell lines were implanted orthotopically into the pancreas of nude mice. Cells expressing Dyn2-green fluorescent protein exhibited a threefold increase in large distal tumors compared with cells expressing Dyn2Y(231/597)F or vector alone. Finally, histological analysis revealed that Dyn2 is upregulated in 60% of human metastatic pancreatic tumors. These findings are the first to implicate dynamin in any neoplastic condition and to directly demonstrate a role for this mechanoenzyme in invasive cell migration."
https://openalex.org/W2036097550,"The minor light-harvesting complexes CP24, CP26, and CP29 have been proposed to play a key role in the zeaxanthin (Zx)-dependent high light-induced regulation (NPQ) of excitation energy in higher plants. To characterize the detailed roles of these minor complexes in NPQ and to determine their specific quenching effects we have studied the ultrafast fluorescence kinetics in knockout (ko) mutants koCP26, koCP29, and the double mutant koCP24/CP26. The data provide detailed insight into the quenching processes and the reorganization of the Photosystem (PS) II supercomplex under quenching conditions. All genotypes showed two NPQ quenching sites. Quenching site Q1 is formed by a light-induced functional detachment of parts of the PSII supercomplex and a pronounced quenching of the detached antenna parts. The antenna remaining bound to the PSII core was also quenched substantially in all genotypes under NPQ conditions (quenching site Q2) as compared with the dark-adapted state. The latter quenching was about equally strong in koCP26 and the koCP24/CP26 mutants as in the WT. Q2 quenching was substantially reduced, however, in koCP29 mutants suggesting a key role for CP29 in the total NPQ. The observed quenching effects in the knockout mutants are complicated by the fact that other minor antenna complexes do compensate in part for the lack of the CP24 and/or CP29 complexes. Their lack also causes some LHCII dissociation already in the dark."

Arfs (ADP-ribosylation factors), a family of highly conserved GTPases within the Ras superfamily, control recruitment of molecular coats to membranes, the initial step of coated vesicle biogenesis. Arf1 and coatomer constitute the minimal cytosolic machinery leading to COPI vesicle formation from Golgi membranes. Although some functional redundancies have been suggested, other Arf isoforms have been poorly analyzed in this context. In this study, we found that Arf1, Arf4, and Arf5, but not Arf3 and Arf6, associate with COPI vesicles generated in vitro from Golgi membranes and purified cytosol. Using recombinant myristoylated proteins, we show that Arf1, Arf4, and Arf5 each support COPI vesicle formation individually. Unexpectedly, we found that Arf3 could also mediate vesicle biogenesis. However, Arf3 was excluded from the vesicle fraction in the presence of the other isoforms, highlighting a functional competition between the different Arf members."
https://openalex.org/W2060446612,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an important etiologic factor in the development of colorectal cancer. However, the mechanism underlying carcinogenesis through chronic inflammation is still unknown. Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) is induced by the inflammation and involved in various human carcinogenesis via its mutagenic activity. In the current study, we investigated whether the inflammation/AID axis plays an integral role in the development of colitis-associated cancers. Inflammation in the cecum was more severe than that in other colonic regions, and endogenous AID expression was enhanced most prominently in the inflamed cecal mucosa of interleukin (IL)-10−/− mice. Blockade of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and IL-12 significantly suppressed AID expression. Although proinflammatory cytokine expression was comparable between IL-10−/−AID+/+ and IL-10−/−AID−/− mice, sequencing analyses revealed a significantly lower incidence of somatic mutations in Trp53 gene in the colonic mucosa of IL-10−/−AID−/− than IL-10−/−AID+/+ mice. Colon cancers spontaneously developed in the cecum in 6 of 22 (27.2%) IL-10−/−AID+/+ mice. In contrast, none of the IL-10−/−AID−/− mice developed cancers except only one case of neoplasia in the distal colon. These findings suggest that the proinflammatory cytokine-induced aberrant production of AID links colonic inflammation to an enhanced genetic susceptibility to oncogenic mutagenesis. Targeting AID could be a novel strategy to prevent colitis-associated colon carcinogenesis irrespective of ongoing colonic inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2017426055,"Pathogenic Rickettsia species cause high morbidity and mortality, especially R. prowazekii, the causative agent of typhus. Like many intracellular pathogens, Rickettsia exploit the cytoskeleton to enter and spread within the host cell. Here we report that the cell surface antigen sca4 of Rickettsia co-localizes with vinculin in cells at sites of focal adhesions in sca4-transfected cells and that sca4 binds to and activates vinculin through two vinculin binding sites (VBSs) that are conserved across all Rickettsia. Remarkably, this occurs through molecular mimicry of the vinculin-talin interaction that is also seen with the IpaA invasin of the intracellular pathogen Shigella, where binding of these VBSs to the vinculin seven-helix bundle head domain (Vh1) displaces intramolecular interactions with the vinculin tail domain that normally clamp vinculin in an inactive state. Finally, the vinculin·sca4-VBS crystal structures reveal that vinculin adopts a new conformation when bound to the C-terminal VBS of sca4. Collectively, our data define the mechanism by which sca4 activates vinculin and interacts with the actin cytoskeleton, and they suggest important roles for vinculin in Rickettsia pathogenesis."

Furthermore, CopN inhibits tubulin polymerization by sequestering free αβ-tubulin, similar to one of the mechanisms utilized by stathmin. Although CopN and stathmin share no detectable sequence identity, both influence MT formation by sequestration of αβ-tubulin.

Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 143-190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Infection involves attachment and cellular uptake of elementary bodies and subsequent differentiation into reticulate bodies. The reticulate bodies remain in endosome-derived membrane vacuoles termed “inclusions,” which migrate to the microtubule-organizing center in a dynein-dependent process (18Grieshaber S.S.

As with other Gram-negative bacteria, Chlamydia species use a type three secretion system (T3SS) 2The abbreviations used are: T3SStype three secretion systemMTmicrotubuleGMP-CPPguanosine 5′-(α,β-methylene)triphosphate. and T3SS effectors to subvert host defenses and reprogram cell processes (1Fields K.A.

Type three secretion is a complex pathway used by many Gram-negative bacteria to deliver effector proteins to their hosts (for extensive reviews, see Refs. 21Cornelis G.R. Nat. Rev.

The T3SS is composed of a needle complex (or type three secretion apparatus), an ATPase, translocator molecules, effector molecules, and chaperones. The needle complex is a large multiprotein complex that spans bacterial membranes and serves as a conduit through which secreted proteins reach the target cell. Proteins are secreted through this pore in an ATP-consuming process using specialized ATPases located in the bacterial cytosol, at the base of the needle complex. Secreted proteins include translocators, which are membrane proteins that form a pore in the host membrane, and effectors, which are a diverse group of proteins that subvert host cell processes and orchestrate bacterial adhesion or engulfment (among other activities). Within the bacterial cytosol, effectors and translocators are often found in complex with specialized chaperones that keep them in a secretion-competent state until secretion is initiated. External cues initiate secretion, at which time a plug protein that had been occluding the pore is secreted, and the T3SS becomes active. A common target for T3SS effectors is the host's cytoskeleton, which is frequently remodeled during infection (3Valdivia R.H. Curr. Opin.

Bacterial pathogens typically secrete effectors that modulate the actin cytoskeleton, which enables remodeling of the membrane to promote uptake or adhesion of the bacteria. The tubulin cytoskeleton is less frequently the target of effectors, although there are some reports describing effectors that target tubulin or microtubules (MTs) (4Huang J. Lesser C.F. Lory S. Nature. 2008; 456: 112-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 27Yoshida S. Sasakawa C. Trends Microbiol. 2003; 11: 139-143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).

In non-dividing cells, they form a structural network used, in combination with MT-associated motor proteins, for vesicle trafficking and organelle localization. In motile cells, they are essential components of cilia and flagella. During cell division, MTs form the mitotic spindle and segregate the chromosomes to daughter cells. A prominent feature of infection is that Chlamydia species modulate the host cell cycle, resulting in delayed cytokinesis and failure to segregate sister chromosomes properly (4Huang J. Lesser C.F.

We show that CopN binds directly to αβ-tubulin and inhibits tubulin polymerization into MTs.

C. pneumoniae CopN was subsequently cloned by standard PCR methods into pET28, thus incorporating an N-terminal hexahistidine tag, and all truncations were made in pET28 using PCR-based mutagenesis. Scc2 and Scc3 were PCR-amplified from genomic DNA (ATCC strain AR-39) and cloned into pET28 with an N-terminal hexahistidine tag. Human stathmin was subcloned from a pET15 vector into pET28 and fused to an N-terminal hexahistidine tag. Proteins were expressed in BL21(DE3) cells grown in LB medium at 37 °C and induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 12 h at 20 °C. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and lysed with a French press, and proteins were purified by metal affinity chromatography and, for all proteins except stathmin, gel filtration. Proteins were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until needed. Fresh bovine brains were obtained from a local slaughterhouse (C & F Meat Co., College Grove, TN), and tubulin was prepared as described (35Castoldi M. Popov A.V. Protein Expr. Purif. 2003; 32: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar), with the only modifications being that 600 g of bovine brains rather than 1 kg of porcine brains were used (buffer volumes were adjusted accordingly) and that the rotors used were JA-10, Ti-45, and Ti-70.1 rather than SLA 1500, Ti-45, and TLA 100.4 (rotor velocities were adjusted to achieve appropriate g forces). Tubulin was snap-frozen in BRB80 buffer (80 mm PIPES, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EGTA, pH 6.8) in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until needed. Tubulin and chaperone binding assays were performed by gel filtration using a 24-ml Superdex S200 column (GE Healthcare), equilibrated in S200 buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl and 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5), run at 0.5 ml/min, and maintained at 4 °C. CopN and tubulin or CopN and Scc3 were mixed, allowed to form complexes for 15 min, and applied to the column. For the stathmin-tubulin-CopN experiments, stathmin and tubulin were mixed first and allowed to equilibrate for 15 min, and then CopN was added and allowed to equilibrate for an additional 15 min. MT pelleting assays were performed essentially as described (12Belmont L.D. Mitchison T.J. Cell. 1996; 84: 623-631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar, 36Du Y. English C.A. Ohi R. Curr. Biol. 2010; 20: 374-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Taxol-stabilized MTs (10 μg/reaction) were incubated with CopNΔ8 (2, 6, 10, 20, 30, and 40 μg/reaction) for 15 min at 25 °C and spun through a 60% sucrose cushion (20 min at 140,000 × g in a TLA 100.4 rotor). Fractions from the supernatant and pellet were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Human stathmin (5 μg/reaction) and the rat MAP2c (microtubule-associated protein 2c) MT-binding domain (20 μg/reaction; a gift from Kevin Slep, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill) (37Roger B. Al-Bassam J. Dehmelt L. Milligan R.A. Halpain S. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 363-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) were used as positive and negative controls for MT binding, respectively. Turbidity assays were performed in triplicate in a BioTek Synergy 4 plate reader in 96-well plates. Each assay well included 200 μg of tubulin, 3 mm GTP, 80 mm PIPES, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 30% glycerol in a total volume of 300 μl. Plates were set up on ice, mixed, and transferred to an incubated plate reader maintained at 37 °C. Absorbance at 340 nm was measured at 45-s intervals, and the plates were shaken for 5 s before each measurement. The data presented are the average of three replicate wells. MT disassembly was assayed essentially as described (12Belmont L.D. Mitchison T.J. Cell. 1996; 84: 623-631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar, 36Du Y. English C.A.

Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 10241-10243Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Surfaces of double-stick tape flow cells were coated with 1 mg/ml biotinylated BSA followed by 0.1 mg/ml streptavidin. 1 mm fluorescent (1:9 rhodamine-labeled:unlabeled) and biotinylated (1:100 biotinylated:unmodified) GMP-CPP-stabilized MTs were then bound to the flow cell surface and washed with flow cell buffer (80 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EGTA containing 1 mm MgATP, 500 mg/ml casein, 50 mm KCl, and an oxygen scavenging mixture) (39Desai A. Verma S. Mitchison T.J. Walczak C.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 69-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). CopN was diluted to 2.8 μm in flow cell buffer and added to the flow cell. MT disassembly was monitored by time-lapse fluorescence microscopy using a Nikon 90i epifluorescence microscope with a 100× 1.4 numerical aperture Nikon objective and a CoolSNAP HQ2 cooled CCD camera. MT lengths were measured at 0 and 4 min. These experiments were performed simultaneously with experiments presented by Du et al. (36Du Y. English C.A. Ohi R. Curr. Biol. 2010; 20: 374-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar); therefore, the control experiments represent the same set of controls reported in that publication. GMP-CPP-stabilized MTs were prepared as described (40Hyman A. Drechsel D. Kellogg D. Salser S. Sawin K. Steffen P. Wordeman L. Mitchison T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 478-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). MTs were mixed with buffer alone (BRB80), the MAP2c MT-binding domain (a known MT-bundling protein (37Roger B. Al-Bassam J. Dehmelt L. Milligan R.A. Halpain S. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 363-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar)), or CopN and incubated for 5 min at room temperature before being prepared for imaging by conventional negative stain electron microscopy. Uranyl formate-stained samples were prepared for electron microscopy as described (41Ohi M. Li Y. Cheng Y. Walz T. Biol. Proced. Online. 2004; 6: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). In brief, the sample (3 μl) was absorbed onto a glow-discharged 200-mesh copper grid covered with carbon-coated collodion film. The grid was washed with two drops of water and then stained with two drops of uranyl formate (0.75%). Samples were imaged on an FEI Morgagni electron microscope operated at an acceleration voltage of 100 kV. Images were recorded at a magnification of either ×11,000 or ×36,000 and collected using a 1000 × 1000 CCD camera (ATM). This assay was performed analogously to a competitive ELISA. Wells in a 96-well microtiter plate were coated with 1 μg/well tubulin in BRB80 buffer for 10 h at 4 °C. The plate was subsequently washed two times with PBS, blocked for 2 h with PBS and 3% BSA at 22 °C, and washed four times with PBS. Biotinylated stathmin, labeled with sulfo-NHS-biotin (Thermo Scientific) following the manufacturer's protocol and using a 40-fold molar excess of sulfo-NHS-biotin, was added simultaneously with unlabeled CopN to each well. Biotinylated stathmin (100 μl of 2.0 μm) was added to each well. This value was the EC50 of biotinylated stathmin in experiments without CopN. CopN (100 μl) was added as a dilution series from 10 to 0.020 μm. To add these reagents simultaneously and to avoid order of addition kinetics, they were premixed in a 96-well plate with very low protein binding in PBS, 3% BSA, and 0.05% Tween 20. Binding was for 2 h at 22 °C, followed by four PBS washes. The biotin signal was developed with alkaline phosphatase-linked streptavidin using reagents from Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories and read on a BioTek Synergy 4 plate reader at 405 nm. Control experiments included conditions without tubulin, without CopN, and without biotinylated stathmin. CopN, which is found in all Chlamydia species, shows weak sequence homology to a family of bacterial proteins that function as plug proteins for the T3SS (30Pallen M.J. Beatson S.A. Bailey C.M. BMC Microbiol. 2005; 5: 9Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This family includes YopN from Yersinia pestis and MxiC from Shigella. Plug proteins exist in two different organizational structures, a YopN-like form in which the plug and a regulator protein (TyeA in the case of YopN) exist as two separate polypeptides (31Schubot F.D. Jackson M.W. Penrose K.J. Cherry S. Tropea J.E. Plano G.V. Waugh D.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 1147-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and a single polypeptide form exemplified by MxiC, the T3SS plug protein from Shigella (33Deane J.E. Roversi P. King C. Johnson S. Lea S.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 377: 985-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In MxiC, a TyeA-like domain is present in the C-terminal region of the protein (33Deane J.E. Roversi P. King C. Johnson S. Lea S.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 377: 985-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). CopN is ∼100 amino acids longer than YopN (399 versus 293 amino acids) and ∼50 amino acids longer than MxiC (399 versus 354 amino acids) and has been proposed to be a MxiC-like plug protein (30Pallen M.J. Beatson S.A. Bailey C.M. BMC Microbiol. 2005; 5: 9Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). As a first step in our biochemical characterization of CopN, we mapped its domain structure by limited proteolysis and mass spectrometry using trypsin and chymotrypsin. This approach, in which unstructured regions are rapidly degraded, identifies domains based on protease resistance. Our results, summarized in Fig. 1, indicate that CopN is composed of a flexible N terminus, a protease-resistant central core, and a protease-resistant C-terminal domain. Despite very low sequence identity (45 conserved residues between CopN and MxiC), this domain structure is similar to the domain organization of MxiC (33Deane J.E. Roversi P. King C. Johnson S. Lea S.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 377: 985-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This domain structure has two implications: first, that amino acids 85–268 form a plug domain that is structurally similar to YopN and the plug region of MxiC, and second, that the C-terminal ∼130 amino acids of CopN form a regulatory domain, perhaps similar to TyeA and the C-terminal domain of MxiC, which controls CopN secretion and hence activation of the T3SS. In the case of Y. pestis, TyeA binds the C terminus of YopN and prevents YopN secretion until an unknown signal promotes the release of TyeA (31Schubot F.D. Jackson M.W. Penrose K.J. Cherry S. Tropea J.E. Plano G.V. Waugh D.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 1147-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In the case of CopN and other MxiC-like plug proteins, secretion is likely triggered by a conformational change within the C-terminal domain rather than by release of a regulatory protein. The N termini of type three secretion effectors are unstructured and function to promote secretion, with some binding cognate chaperones and becoming partially ordered upon binding (22Ghosh P. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 771-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 42Rodgers L. Gamez A. Riek R. Ghosh P. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 20857-20863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 43Lilic M. Vujanac M. Stebbins C.E. Mol.

To determine whether the N-terminal region of CopN binds a chaperone, we first identified the relevant chaperone. The candidate chaperone, Scc3, which was shown to bind CopN in yeast and bacterial two-hybrid experiments (34Slepenkin A. de la Maza L.M. Peterson E.M. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 473-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 45Spaeth K.E. Chen Y.S. Valdivia R.H. PLoS Pathog. 2009; 5: e1000579Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), was cloned, expressed, and purified. Using purified components, we found that Scc3 promoted a shift of CopN, as well as an N-terminal truncation of CopN (CopNΔ84), to a faster elution time on a gel filtration column and that, when added together, the proteins co-eluted at the faster time, indicating that Scc3 binds directly to CopN (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. 1). Heterologous expression of C. pneumonia CopN in eukaryotic cells results in disruption of mitotic spindles, which are composed of MTs, and mitotic arrest (4Huang J. Lesser C.F. Lory S. Nature. 2008; 456: 112-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Such characteristics are consistent with the action of a MT-destabilizing protein, motivating us to investigate the possibility that CopN binds tubulin or MTs. Using purified components, we determined that CopN bound directly to αβ-tubulin. Using gel filtration to measure protein-protein interactions as a shift in retention time, we found that CopN significantly retarded the retention time for αβ-tubulin (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. 2, A and B), consistent with a model in which the disruption of mitotic spindles observed when CopN is expressed is mediated by direct tubulin binding. We next investigated whether additional homologs bound αβ-tubulin. As shown in Fig. 2B and supplemental Fig. 2C, CopN from C. psittaci B577 (C. abortus), but not from C. trachomatis (Fig. 2C and supplemental Fig. 2D), interacted with αβ-tubulin by gel filtration. To determine whether CopN binds to both MTs and tubulin or if it is specific for unpolymerized tubulin, we evaluated the ability of CopN to bind MTs using a MT pelleting assay. In this assay, CopN was incubated with MTs, which were subsequently separated from free αβ-tubulin by centrifugation. This assay is typically used to show binding to MTs, in which case, the binding partner is pulled to the pellet with the MTs. As shown in Fig. 2D, CopN remained in the supernatant, indicating that it does not bind MTs. Although this experiment cannot rule out that a small amount of CopN binds to MTs, taken in its entirety, Fig. 2 shows that CopN has a clear preference for unpolymerized tubulin, indicating that it binds a surface of tubulin that is inaccessible or altered in MTs. We further evaluated the possibility that CopN might induce bundling or some other alteration of MTs. Negative stain electron microscopy demonstrated that CopN did not alter MT structure (supplemental Fig. 3). The direct interaction between CopN and αβ-tubulin and the lack of a detectable interaction between CopN and MTs led us to hypothesize that CopN promotes MT instability by binding and sequestering αβ-tubulin, thus preventing polymerization, i.e. CopN might sequester αβ-tubulin and effectively raise the critical concentration of assembly for tubulin. Stathmin, a eukaryotic tubulin-binding protein, is known to use an analogous “sequestration” mechanism to prevent tubulin polymerization (7Ravelli R.B. Gigant B. Curmi P.A. Jourdain I. Lachkar S.

To evaluate how tubulin binding by CopN alters MT polymerization, we optimized a standard MT turbidity assay (12Belmont L.D. Mitchison T.J. Cell. 1996; 84: 623-631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar) for a 96-well plate. In this assay, tubulin is incubated at 37 °C and allowed to polymerize into MTs, which scatter light. Absorbance at 350 nm is measured as an indicator of polymerization. Use of a 96-well format allowed us to compare all proteins directly in very uniform conditions. CopN from C. pneumonia and C. psittaci strongly inhibited tubulin polymerization, whereas CopN from C. trachomatis showed weaker but measurable inhibition (Fig. 3A). CopN from C. pneumonia was particularly effective at inhibiting MT formation, showing near-complete inhibition at 25 μm. Consistent with the observation that CopN binds free αβ-tubulin but not MTs, we also observed that it inhibited αβ-tubulin polymerization but did not promote depolymerization of MTs. We evaluated the ability of CopN to destabilize MTs by mixing CopN with preformed rhodamine-labeled MT as described (36Du Y. English C.A. Ohi R. Curr. Biol. 2010; 20: 374-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 38Germane K.L. Ohi R. Goldberg M.B. Spiller B.W. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 10241-10243Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3B, no change in MT size was evident following incubation with CopN. The similar capacities of both CopN and stathmin to bind free tubulin and inhibit polymerization motivated us to determine whether CopN is a distant prokaryotic stathmin homolog. Stathmins contain multiple copies of an ∼35-amino acid tubulin-binding repeat, each of which binds a single αβ-tubulin (46Lachkar S. Lebois M. Steinmetz M.O. Guichet A. Lal N. Curmi P.A. Sobel A.

Despite its importance, the identity of the enzyme(s) that hydrolyzes the acetyl residue of circulating aspirin, which must be an existing enzyme, remains unknown. We find that circulating aspirin was extensively hydrolyzed within erythrocytes, and chromatography indicated these cells contained a single hydrolytic activity. Purification by over 1400-fold and sequencing identified the PAFAH1B2 and PAFAH1B3 subunits of type I platelet-activating factor (PAF) acetylhydrolase, a phospholipase A2 with selectivity for acetyl residues of PAF, as a candidate for aspirin acetylhydrolase. Western blotting showed that catalytic PAFAH1B2 and PAFAH1B3 subunits of the type I enzyme co-migrated with purified erythrocyte aspirin hydrolytic activity. Recombinant PAFAH1B2, but not its family member plasma PAF acetylhydrolase, hydrolyzed aspirin, and PAF competitively inhibited aspirin hydrolysis by purified or recombinant erythrocyte enzymes. Aspirin was hydrolyzed by HEK cells transfected with PAFAH1B2 or PAFAH1B3, and the competitive type I PAF acetylhydrolase inhibitor NaF reduced erythrocyte hydrolysis of aspirin. Exposing aspirin to erythrocytes blocked its ability to inhibit thromboxane A2 synthesis and platelet aggregation. Not all individuals or populations are equally protected by aspirin prophylaxis, the phenomenon of aspirin resistance, and erythrocyte hydrolysis of aspirin varied 3-fold among individuals, which correlated with PAFAH1B2 and not PAFAH1B3.

Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) is the classic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent with an estimated 100 million tons made and consumed annually (1Warner T.D. Mitchell J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 13371-13373Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The reactive acetyl group of aspirin irreversibly acetylates serine 530 residue of type I cyclooxygenase, thereby irreversibly inhibiting the first of the two reactions this enzyme catalyzes (2Smith W.L.

Rev. 2004; 56: 387-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar). The cyclooxygenase product prostaglandin H2 made in platelets is converted by their thromboxane synthase to thromboxane A2. This lipid mediator is critical to platelet function because platelets express the TXA receptor that strongly promotes activation by incomplete agonists (3Simmons D.L. Botting R.M. Hla T. Pharmacol. Rev. 2004; 56: 387-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar, 4FitzGerald G.A. Am. J. Cardiol. 1991; 68: 11B-15BAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Platelets are particularly prone to the effects of aspirin because, unlike all other cells, these anucleate cells are unable to synthesize new enzyme to replace inactivate enzyme. Once a platelet is exposed to aspirin, its adhesion to activated endothelial cells, growing platelet plugs, thrombosis, and degranulation are irreversibly suppressed (5Vane J.R. Nat. New Biol. 1971; 231: 232-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (7346) Google Scholar, 6Yu Y. Fan J. Hui Y. Rouzer C.A. Marnett L.J. Klein-Szanto A.J. FitzGerald G.A. Funk C.D. J. Biol.

Ingested aspirin is hydrolyzed in the gut by first pass metabolism, with about 50–70% reaching systemic circulation (7Pedersen A.K. FitzGerald G.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1984; 311: 1206-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 8Seymour R.A. Williams F.M. Ward A. Rawlins M.D. Br. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 1984; 17: 697-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The circulating pool of aspirin is hydrolyzed with a half-life of ∼15 to 20 min (9Rowland M. Riegelman S. Harris P.A. Sholkoff S.D. J. Pharm. Sci. 1972; 61: 379-385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 10Levy G. Anesth. Analg. 1965; 44: 837-841Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but contributes to platelet responsiveness because inhibition is distinctly nonlinear where even small amounts of active cyclooxygenase promote platelet function (11FitzGerald G.A.

Attention has focused on a phenomenon of aspirin ineffectiveness where not all individuals or populations appear to receive the full prophylactic or therapeutic benefits of aspirin (12Gresner P.

Scand. 1993; 37: 20-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The physiologic basis for this aspirin resistance is undefined, and even whether the phenomenon is real or documentable is debated (17Patrono C. Rocca B. Nat. Clin. Pract. Cardiovasc. Med. 2007; 4: 42-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Despite these clinical and laboratory issues, variation in the time aspirin circulates will affect its ability to inactivate cyclooxygenase 1 and inhibit platelet function. Aspirin turnover limits its effectiveness, but the enzyme(s) responsible for this hydrolysis is unknown. Aspirin hydrolysis was not subjected to natural selection, and so must be a property of enzymes selected in other ways. Accordingly, several esterases have the ability to hydrolyze aspirin that include uridine diphosphate glucuronyl transferase (18Bigler J. Whitton J. Lampe J.W. Fosdick L. Bostick R.M. Potter J.D. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3566-3569PubMed Google Scholar, 19Chan A.T. Tranah G.J. Giovannucci E.L. Hunter D.J. Fuchs C.S. J. Natl.

Kaur S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1983; 226: 589-594PubMed Google Scholar). However, the enzymes that actually contribute to aspirin turnover in blood, rather than merely being capable of aspirin hydrolysis, are undefined. Aspirin hydrolysis in blood need not occur in plasma because aspirin rapidly enters erythrocytes (23Ohsako M. Matsumoto Y. Goto S. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 1993; 16: 154-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) where it is hydrolyzed by first order kinetics (24Reilly I.A. FitzGerald G.A. Drugs. 1988; 35: 154-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Indeed, the rate of aspirin hydrolysis in blood correlates positively with hematocrit (25Costello P.B. Caruana J.A. Green F.A. Arthritis Rheum. 1984; 27: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The aspirin hydrolase of erythrocytes was first identified as membrane-bound acetylcholinesterase (26Costello P.B. Green F.A. Arthritis Rheum. 1982; 25: 550-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), but was then located to cytosol that is inconsistent with this membrane-bound enzyme (27Costello P.B. Green F.A. Arthritis Rheum. 1983; 26: 541-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Partial purification of this activity revealed a 95-kDa protein as the major aspirin hydrolytic activity that is also inconsistent with the ∼66-kDa acetylcholinesterase (27Costello P.B. Green F.A.

Type I PAF acetylhydrolase (PAFAH), a structurally unrelated member of this small family of group VII phospholipases A2 that hydrolyze the acetyl residue of PAF, is present in erythrocytes as a trimer of a noncatalytic 45-kDa protein subunit associated with two catalytic subunits, either α1 (29 kDa, PAFAH1B3) or α2 (30 kDa, PAFAH1B2) homo- or heterodimers (32Ho Y.S. Swenson L. Derewenda U. Serre L. Wei Y. Dauter Z. Hattori M. Adachi T. Aoki J. Arai H. Inoue K. Derewenda Z.S. Nature. 1997; 385: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). We purified erythrocyte aspirin hydrolase and found that the major hydrolytic activity in blood is type I PAF acetylhydrolase. We also found that erythrocytes alter the suppression of aspirin on platelet function, and that the effectiveness of intracellular hydrolysis of aspirin varied among individuals. Aspirin, purified human plasma butyrylcholinesterase, and antibodies to PAFAH1B2 and PAFAH1B3 were purchased from Sigma. Salicylic acid and high performance liquid chromatography grade solvents (acetonitrile, formic acid, and water) were from J.T. Baker Inc. (Phillipsburg, NJ). ECL kits were from Amersham Biosciences. DNA plasmids encoding Homo sapiens platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase 1b and recombinant H. sapiens platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase 1b were purchased from OriGene Technologies, Inc. (Rockville, MD). LipofectamineTM 2000 was purchased from Invitrogen. Purified recombinant plasma PAF acetylhydrolase was from ICOS Corporation (Bothel, WA). DEAE-SepharoseTM FF and HiTrap Q columns were purchased from GE Healthcare. Collagen was from CHRONO-LOG Corp. (Havertown, PA). C18 SPE columns were from Mallinckrodt Baker (Phillipsburg, PA). PAF was from Biomol Research Laboratories (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Thromboxane B2 Express EIA Kits were from Cayman. An enzyme source was incubated with 4 mm aspirin buffered by PBS, pH 7.2, in a 50-μl total volume at 37 °C for 2 h. The reaction was stopped and proteins were precipitated by adding 150 μl of acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid and 400 μg/ml of acetaminophen as an internal standard followed by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Aspirin hydrolytic activity was measured by quantifying salicylic acid production by RP-HPLC over a 5-μm 150 × 2-mm ODS column from Phenomenex. The mobile phase was acetonitrile, aqueous 0.1% formic acid (40/60, v/v) at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Salicylic acid, aspirin, and acetaminophen were quantified by UV absorption at 280 nm using the internal standard and previously defined spectra with authentic compounds. Data were analyzed by converting the area under the absorption curve. Nonenzymatic produced salicylic acid was subtracted from the analysis. Aspirin concentrations varied over a range of 0.2 to 8 mm in incubations with PAFAH1B2 or BChE at 37 °C for 1 h with or without addition of PAF (1 mm). Experiments were performed in triplicate before the data were fitted with Prism 3 software to obtain kinetic constants. Human erythrocytes were isolated from blood (400 ml/donor) freshly drawn from healthy human volunteers in a protocol approved by the Cleveland Clinic Institutional Review Board. Blood was collected in EDTA (25 mm) and then centrifuged for 20 min at 2,000 × g. The supernatant was discarded, and the blood cells were suspended in 3 volumes of 0.9% NaCl and centrifuged as above. These erythrocytes were washed twice more to remove contaminating plasma. All chromatography was carried out at 4 °C. Erythrocytes (100 ml) were hypotonically lysed with 100 ml of 0.2% NaCl. Membrane debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Supernatants were diluted to 1 liter with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm EDTA and loaded onto a 500-ml DEAE-SepharoseTM FF column. The column was washed with equilibrating buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) until protein elution from the column ceased (1–1.5 liters). This removed most of the hemoglobin, which is the major protein in this preparation. Aspirin hydrolytic activity was eluted from the gel with a linear 0 to 0.5 m NaCl gradient in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). Fractions (8 ml) were collected and assayed for protein content and aspirin hydrolytic activity. Most of the aspirin hydrolytic activity was present in fractions 34 to 44 (supplemental Fig. S1). Active fractions were pooled and concentrated to 20 ml using Pierce® concentrators (Thermo Scientific). Concentrated material was diluted 20-fold to 100 ml with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and loaded onto a second DEAE column (50 ml) and eluted with a linear NaCl gradient as before. Fractions (4 ml) were collected and assayed for protein content and aspirin hydrolytic activity. The bulk of the activity was again contained in fractions 35 to 43 (supplemental Fig. S1). Active fractions were pooled and concentrated to 5 ml using Pierce concentrators (Thermo Scientific). Concentrated preparations from DEAE chromatography (5 ml) were diluted to 60 ml and loaded onto a 5-ml HiTrap Q column conditioned with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). A linear 0 to 0.1 m NaCl gradient was used to elute material from the column before as fractions (1 ml) were collected and assayed for protein and aspirin hydrolytic activity. Most of the aspirin hydrolytic activity was recovered in fractions 40 to 50 (supplemental Fig. S1), which were pooled and concentrated to 1 ml. The pooled, concentrated fraction from the HiTrap Q column was fractionated by molecular sieving with a Sephacryl S-200 column (1 × 60 cm) equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 150 mm NaCl (supplemental Fig. S1). Proteins purified by chromatography were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The Coomassie Blue-stained bands were cut from the gel as tightly as possible with a punch and washed and destained in 50% ethanol with 5% acetic acid. The gel pieces were dehydrated in acetonitrile, dried in a SpeedVac, and digested with trypsin by adding 5 μl of trypsin (10 ng/μl) in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, and incubated overnight at room temperature. The peptides were extracted from the polyacrylamide in two aliquots of 30 μl of 50% acetonitrile with 5% formic acid. The LC-MS system was a Finnigan LTQ linear ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with an Eksigant nano-one-dimensional HPLC system. The tryptic peptides were eluted from a self-packed 9 cm × 75-μm Phenomenex Jupiter C18 reversed-phase capillary column with an acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid gradient flowing at 0.25 μl/min. The peptides were introduced directly into the mass spectrometer and the resulting LC-MS/MS data were analyzed by searching the human reference sequence data base using the search program Mascot. All matching spectra were verified by manual interpretation. Homotypic aggregation of washed platelets (2 × 108/ml) was measured optically (CHRONO-LOG, model 700) with stirring at 600 rpm at 37 °C. In some cases, washed erythrocytes (8 × 108 in 1 μl) were introduced after incubation with 1.25 mm aspirin for 0 or 30 min before dilution into a preparation of platelets to achieve what would have been 50 μm based on the amount of the initial aspirin. Aggregation was induced with 5 μg/ml of collagen. The rate and extent of aggregation were recorded by monitoring light transmission compared with buffer control. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells (HEK 293T) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Cleveland Clinic Core Facility) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (HyClone), and penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. HEK 293T cells (1 × 105 cells/well) were plated in 6-well plates and 24 h later transfected with DNA plasmids (6 μg/well) encoding H. sapiens PAF acetylhydrolase PAFAH1B2 or PAFAH1B3 subunits under control of a CMV promoter using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 32 h, cells were harvested and washed twice by PBS buffer. PAF hydrolyzing activity was determined using 100 μm [acetyl-3H]PAF as the substrate. Briefly, the enzyme source was incubated with [acetyl-3H]PAF before released [3H]acetate was isolated over a C18 cartridge and counted by liquid scintillation counting as described (33Stafforini D.M. Prescott S.M. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4223-4230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein concentration was measured by the Bradford method. Equal amounts of sample were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrophoretically transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm sodium chloride, and 0.1% Tween 20, TBST) and incubated overnight at 4 °C with antibodies against PAFAH1B2 (1:1000), butyrylcholinesterase (1:1000), PAFAH1B3 (1:1000), or β-actin (1:1000). The membrane was washed with TBST buffer and incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies at the manufacturer's suggested dilution. Antibody staining was captured by chemiluminescence reagents and x-ray film. Michaelis-Menten progression curves were fitted using nonlinear regression analyses included in Prism 3. Data are presented as mean ± S.D. of 3 analyses derived from the blood of one donor, with repetition and validation from at least one other donor. Aspirin was hydrolyzed when incubated with whole blood, and separation of plasma from erythrocytes showed the bulk of the activity was displayed by intact erythrocytes (Fig. 1). Erythrocytes constitute nearly half the volume of blood, and facile entry of aspirin (23Ohsako M. Matsumoto Y. Goto S. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 1993; 16: 154-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) resulted in greater intracellular hydrolysis than extracellular plasma hydrolysis. We purified erythrocyte aspirin hydrolytic activity to determine whether more than a single activity accounted for intracellular hydrolysis, and to identify the relevant activity(ies). We used a combination of DEAE, HiTrap Q, and Sephacryl S200 size exclusion chromatography (supplemental Fig. S1) to obtain an overall purification of 1,438-fold with a final yield of 24% (Table 1).TABLE 1Purification of erythrocyte aspirin hydrolytic activityStepTotal proteinTotal activitySpecific activityPurificationRecoverymgnmol/hnmol/mg/h-fold%RBC lysate10485.00129339.6512.331100.00DEAE binding4100.0099288.6024.82276.77DEAE I91.3960012.00656.665346.40DEAE II41.5637083.70892.297228.67HiTrap Q FF12.4034260.002762.9022426.49Sephacryl S-2001.831924.0117735.6143824.68 Open table in a new tab Aspirin hydrolytic activity in the final size separating column revealed a single, asymmetric peak of activity with maximal activity eluting in fractions 40 to 43 with an asymmetric abundance in the preceding fractions (Fig. 2A). Elution at this position corresponded to an estimated size of 70 kDa for a globular protein. Analysis of the protein in these fractions by denaturing SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining, however, detected no protein of this approximate size uniquely migrating in these fractions. Instead, a major band migrating just more slowly than the 28-kDa standard (Fig. 2B) was maximal in fractions 41 to 43, with a less abundant and slightly more slowly migrating band foreshadowing this material in fractions 38 to 41. Elution, tryptic digestion, and separation and analysis of the more rapidly migrating band by nano-liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry showed the preparation was not pure, but we identified 5 peptides, corresponding to 27% coverage, of the protein encoded by PAFAH1B2 (Fig. 2C). This protein is a catalytic α2 subunit (30 kDa) that together with a homologous α1 (29 kDa) catalytic subunit and a third noncatalytic subunit LIS1 (45 kDa) form the type I PAF acetylhydrolase trimer (32Ho Y.S. Swenson L. Derewenda U. Serre L. Wei Y. Dauter Z. Hattori M. Adachi T. Aoki J. Arai H. Inoue K. Derewenda Z.S. Nature. 1997; 385: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Four peptides (12% coverage) corresponding to PAFAH1B3 were also present (not shown). Erythrocytes express PAF acetylhydrolase (34Stafforini D.M. Prescott S.M. McIntyre T.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 197: 411-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) that has been purified (35Stafforini D.M. Rollins E.N. Prescott S.M. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3857-3865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and characterized (36Karasawa K. Shirakura M. Harada A. Satoh N. Yokoyama K. Setaka M. Inoue K. J. Biochem. 2005; 138: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) in erythrocytes. The full physiologic role of this enzyme in erythrocytes remains undefined as targeted deletion of its catalytic subunits primarily reduces spermatid and testis size (37Koizumi H. Yamaguchi N. Hattori M. Ishikawa T.O. Aoki J. Taketo M.M. Inoue K. Arai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12489-12494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We determined by Western blotting whether catalytic PAFAH 1 subunits were present in fractions containing aspirin hydrolytic activity. We found (Fig. 2D) immunoreactive PAFAH1B2 heavily concentrated in fractions 41 to 43 of the size exclusion column, and found a wider distribution of PAFAH1B3 that encompassed fractions 36 to 43. The relative distribution of subunits from the human donor differed from the original resolution of the enzyme from pig blood (36Karasawa K. Shirakura M. Harada A. Satoh N. Yokoyama K. Setaka M. Inoue K. J. Biochem. 2005; 138: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). We verified that erythrocyte PAF acetylhydrolase was an appropriate candidate aspirin hydrolase by testing aspirin hydrolysis by PAFAH1B2 because, at least for PAF at low concentrations, the type I complex is more effective as the α2 (PAFAH1B2) homodimer or α1/α2 heterodimer (36Karasawa K. Shirakura M. Harada A. Satoh N. Yokoyama K. Setaka M. Inoue K. J. Biochem. 2005; 138: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 38Manya H. Aoki J. Kato H. Ishii J. Hino S. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31827-31832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) than the enzyme containing the α1 PAFAH1B3 homodimer. Recombinant PAFAH1B2 effectively hydrolyzed aspirin, and its rate varied with substrate concentration that was well described by the Michaelis-Menten equation (Fig. 3A). The Km was determined to be 1.13 ± 0.57 mm and its Vmax was 21.4 ± 2.95 nmol/h/μg. The enzyme purified from erythrocytes displayed an apparent Km for aspirin of 2.17 ± 0.65 mm with a corresponding Vmax of 66.05 ± 7.18 nmol/h/μg, suggesting the recombinant material was not fully active. Butyrylcholinesterase is the most completely characterized soluble enzyme to hydrolyze aspirin, which hydrolyzed aspirin with a Km of 2.78 ± 0.59 mm and a Vmax of 56.36 ± 4.78 nmol/h/μg. We determined whether the acetyl group of PAF and aspirin were likely hydrolyzed in the same active site of the type I PAF acetylhydrolase, and tested the effect of PAF on aspirin hydrolysis by the purified erythrocyte enzyme and recombinant PAFAH1B2. We found that the short chain phospholipid inhibited hydrolysis of the xenobiotic aspirin substrate by both enzymes (Fig. 3B), and that this inhibition was competitive for both enzymes. The calculated Ki for PAF inhibition of aspirin hydrolysis for the purified enzyme was 0.47 mm, whereas that for rPAFAH1B2 was 0.29 mm. This indicates a strong preference for PAF compared with aspirin with its 2.1 mm Km. The type 1 PAF acetylhydrolase is one of three mammalian family members of the group 7 phospholipase A2 family (39Six D.A. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1488: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (1220) Google Scholar), a family that is unique in that all members require a short sn-2 ester such as the acetyl ester of PAF. The primary PAF degrading activity in blood is the plasma PAF acetylhydrolase (40Stafforini D.M. Cardiovasc. Drugs Ther. 2009; 23: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), and so we tested the ability of purified recombinant human plasma PAF acetylhydrolase to hydrolyze the acetyl ester of aspirin. Recombinant plasma PAF acetylhydrolase (PLA2G7) was active and hydrolyzed PAF as effectively as plasma (Fig. 3D). However, the plasma PAF acetylhydrolase was devoid of aspirin hydrolytic activity, and clearly was not the aspirin hydrolytic activity of plasma. The aspirin hydrolase purified from erythrocytes contained type I PAF acetylhydrolase catalytic subunits, and accordingly hydrolyzed PAF. To date, there are no selective inhibitors of the type I PAF acetylhydrolase, but it is reversibly inhibited by sodium fluoride (35Stafforini D.M. Rollins E.N. Prescott S.M. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3857-3865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This small molecule phosphatase inhibitor effectively inhibited PAF hydrolysis by recombinant PAFAH1B2, but also by purified erythrocyte aspirin hydrolase (Fig. 4A). We used this inhibitor to test whether the type I PAF acetylhydrolase contributes to aspirin hydrolysis within erythrocytes to find that NaF blocked two-thirds of the aspirin hydrolytic activity of intact erythrocytes (Fig. 4B). We demonstrated that intracellular PAFAH1B2 hydrolyzed exogenously provided aspirin by transiently overexpressing just this α2 subunit of the enzyme in HEK293 cells. Lysates of cells overexpressing this intracellular PAF acetylhydrolase isoform hydrolyzed aspirin 5 times more effectively than lysates containing just the endogenous amount of the enzyme (Fig. 4C, left). Intact cells also were more effective in hydrolyzing exogenously applied aspirin than control cells, although this enhancement was just 2.2-fold (Fig. 4C, right). These data show that a rate-limiting step exists prior to hydrolysis, and HEK cells that lack band 3 may not internalize aspirin as effectively as erythrocytes. We tested homomeric PAFAH1B3 in an identical fashion to find (Fig. 4D) that lysates of cells overexpressing just this subunit hydrolyzed aspirin just as effectively as lysates containing the α2 subunit in the preceding experiment. Intact cells overexpressing PAFAH1B3 also hydrolyzed aspirin more effectively than control cells, but again the level of enhancement was just ∼2.7-fold. Unlike PAF hydrolysis, both type I subunits effectively degrade aspirin. Type 1 PAF acetylhydrolase is irreversibly inhibited by metho"
https://openalex.org/W2040228066,"Prokaryotic members of the Cys-loop receptor ligand-gated ion channel superfamily were recently identified. Previously, Cys-loop receptors were only known from multicellular organisms (metazoans). Contrary to the metazoan Cys-loop receptors, the prokaryotic ones consist of an extracellular (ECD) and a transmembrane domain (TMD), lacking the large intracellular domain (ICD) present in metazoa (between transmembrane segments M3 and M4). Using a chimera approach, we added the 115-amino acid ICD from mammalian serotonin type 3A receptors (5-HT(3A)) to the prokaryotic proton-activated Gloeobacter violaceus ligand-gated ion channel (GLIC). We created 12 GLIC-5-HT(3A)-ICD chimeras by replacing a variable number of amino acids in the short GLIC M3M4 linker with the entire 5-HT(3A)-ICD. Two-electrode voltage clamp recordings after expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes showed that only two chimeras were functional and produced currents upon acidification. The pH(50) was comparable with wild-type GLIC. 5-HT(3A) receptor expression can be inhibited by the chaperone protein RIC-3. We have shown previously that the 5-HT(3A)-ICD is required for the attenuation of 5-HT-induced currents when RIC-3 is co-expressed with 5-HT(3A) receptors in X. laevis oocytes. Expression of both functional 5-HT(3A) chimeras was inhibited by RIC-3 co-expression, indicating appropriate folding of the 5-HT(3A)-ICD in the chimeras. Our results indicate that the ICD can be considered a separate domain that can be removed from or added to the ECD and TMD while maintaining the overall structure and function of the ECD and TMD."
https://openalex.org/W2060799213,"Destruction of insulin-producing pancreatic β-cells by local autoimmune inflammation is a hallmark of type 1 diabetes. Histochemical analysis of pancreases from non-obese diabetic mice indicated activation of the transcription factor JunB/AP-1 (activator protein-1) after autoimmune infiltration of the islets. In vitro studies demonstrated that the cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interferon (IFN)-γ induce JunB expression as a protective mechanism against apoptosis in both human and rodent β-cells. The gene network affected was studied by microarray analysis showing that JunB regulates nearly 20% of the cytokine-modified β-cell genes, including the transcription factor ATF3. Direct transcriptional induction of ATF3 by JunB is a key event for β-cell survival after TNF-α+IFN-γ treatment. Moreover, pharmacological upregulation of JunB/ATF3 via increased cAMP protected rodent primary β-cells and human islet cells against pro-inflammatory mediators. These results were confirmed in genetically modified islets derived from Ubi-JunB transgenic mice. Our findings identify ATF3 as a novel downstream target of JunB in the survival mechanism of β-cells under inflammatory stress."
https://openalex.org/W2094653341,"We identified XAB1 in a proteomic screen for factors that interact with human RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). Because XAB1 has a conserved Saccharomyces cerevisiae homologue called Npa3, yeast genetics and biochemical analysis were used to dissect the significance of the interaction. Degron-dependent Npa3 depletion resulted in genome-wide transcription decreases, correlating with a loss of RNAPII from genes as measured by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Surprisingly, however, transcription in vitro was unaffected by Npa3, suggesting that it affects a process that is not required for transcription in yeast extracts. Indeed, Npa3 depletion in vivo affects nuclear localization of RNAPII; the polymerase accumulates in the cytoplasm. Npa3 is a member of the GPN-LOOP family of GTPases. Npa3 mutants that either cannot bind GTP or that bind but cannot hydrolyze it are inviable and unable to support nuclear transport of RNAPII. Surprisingly, we were unable to detect interactions between Npa3 and proteins in the classical importin α/β pathway for nuclear import. Interestingly, Npa3-RNAPII binding is significantly increased by the addition of GTP or its slowly hydrolyzable analogue guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTPγS). Moreover, the Npa3 mutant that binds GTP, but cannot hydrolyze it, binds RNAPII even in the absence of added GTP, whereas the mutant that cannot bind GTP is unable to bind the polymerase. Together, our data suggest that Npa3 defines an unconventional pathway for nuclear import of RNAPII, which involves GTP-dependent binding of Npa3 to the polymerase."
https://openalex.org/W1996388631,"Milk fat globule-EGF factor 8 (MFG-E8) is a glycoprotein highly expressed in breast cancer that contributes to tumor progression through largely undefined mechanisms. By analyzing publicly available gene expression profiles of breast carcinomas, we found that MFG-E8 is highly expressed in primary and metastatic breast carcinomas, associated with absent estrogen receptor expression. Immunohistochemistry analysis of breast cancer biopsies revealed that MFG-E8 is expressed on the cell membrane as well as in the cytoplasm and nucleus. We also show that increased expression of MFG-E8 in mammary carcinoma cells increases their tumorigenicity in immunodeficient mice, and conversely, its downregulation reduces their in vivo growth. Moreover, expression of MFG-E8 in immortalized mammary epithelial cells promotes their growth and branching in three-dimensional collagen matrices and induces the expression of cyclins D1/D3 and N-cadherin. A mutant protein unable to bind integrins can in part exert these effects, indicating that MFG-E8 function is only partially dependent on integrin activation. We conclude that MFG-E8-dependent signaling stimulates cell proliferation and the acquisition of mesenchymal properties and contributes to mammary carcinoma development."
https://openalex.org/W2008091671,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcription factor Yap1 is a central determinant of oxidative stress tolerance. This protein is found primarily in the cytoplasm in the absence of oxidative stress but, upon exposure to oxidants, rapidly translocates to the nucleus and activates expression of target genes. Although both diamide and H(2)O(2) have been used to impose oxidative stress on cells, these different oxidants trigger Yap1 nuclear localization in distinctly different ways. Diamide appears to oxidize particular cysteine residues on Yap1, leading to inhibition of association of Yap1 with the nuclear exportin Crm1. Crm1 would normally transport Yap1 out of the nucleus. H(2)O(2) activation of Yap1 nuclear localization requires the participation of the glutathione peroxidase Gpx3 and the Yap1-binding protein Ybp1. H(2)O(2) exposure triggers formation of a dual disulfide bonded Yap1 that is catalyzed by the presence of Gpx3 and Ybp1. In the current study, we have determined that two distinct pools of Yap1 exist in the cell. These pools are designated by the level of Ybp1. Ybp1 interacts directly with Yap1 and these proteins form a stable complex in vivo. Genetic and biochemical experiments indicate that Ybp1 is rate-limiting for Yap1 oxidative folding during H(2)O(2) stress. The fungal pathogen Candida glabrata expresses a protein homologous to Ybp1 called CgYbp1. Overproduction of CgYbp1 elevated H(2)O(2) tolerance in this pathogen indicating that the determinative role of Ybp1 in setting the level of H(2)O(2) resistance has been evolutionarily conserved."
https://openalex.org/W2128271725,"A growing number of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) are thought to be involved in sequence-specific alterations of epigenetic processes, mostly causing gene repression. In this study, promoter-associated ncRNAs (pancRNAs >200 nucleotides in size) that were endogenously generated from the sense strand at Map2b, antisense strand at Nefl, and both strands at Vim were investigated regarding their epigenetic potential as positive or negative regulators in rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) and fibroblast (normal rat kidney) cell lines. The respective antisense pancRNAs were associated with several active chromatin marks at the Nefl and Vim promoters. Forced expression of fragments expressing the antisense pancRNAs caused sequence-specific DNA demethylation, whereas a decrease of expression induced methylation of the same sequences. In contrast, perturbing the expression of the two sense pancRNAs did not change the DNA methylation status. These results suggest that a fraction of naturally occurring ncRNAs acts in cis as a single-stranded form and that the transcriptional orientation of pancRNA is important for the establishment of sequence-specific epigenetic modifications consistent with open chromatin structure."
https://openalex.org/W2022959713,"Inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene underlies the majority of sporadic clear cell renal cell carcinomas (CCRCCs) and is also responsible for the hereditary VHL cancer syndrome. VHL loss of function results in constitutive stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF-1α and HIF-2α) due to insufficient proteolysis in the presence of oxygen. This activates multiple genes relevant to tumorigenesis, allowing cells to acquire further mutations and undergo malignant transformation. However, the specific role of each HIF-α subunit in CCRCC tumorigenesis is not yet well understood. The current paradigm supports that in the first stages of CCRCC formation the stabilization of HIF-1α is dominant and this limits proliferation, but later on HIF-2α increases and this induces a more aggressive cell behavior. Understanding how this transition happens is highly relevant, as it may provide novel ways to treat these cancers. Here, we show that VHL inactivation in CCRCC cells results in HIF-1α/2α-dependent downregulation of HIF-1α mRNA through direct binding of either subunit to a reverse hypoxia-response element in the HIF-1α proximal promoter. This binding activates a series of repressive histone modification marks including histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) to make the changes stable, and if overturned reduces CCRCC cell proliferation due to excessive HIF-1α expression level. Our findings thus help understand how HIF-α subunits influence each other and also reinforce the idea that epigenetic mechanisms are a key step of CCRCC progression."
https://openalex.org/W2005435963,"Reelin is a 3461-residue secreted glycoprotein that plays a critical role in brain development through its action on target neurons. Although it is known that functional reelin protein exists as multimer formed by interchain disulfide bond(s) as well as through non-covalent interactions, the chemical nature of the multimer assembly has been elusive. In the present study, we identified, among 122 cysteines present in full-length reelin, the single critical cysteine residue (Cys(2101)) responsible for the covalent multimerization. C2101A mutant reelin failed to assemble into disulfide-bonded multimers, whereas it still exhibited non-covalently associated high molecular weight oligomeric states in solution. Detailed analysis of tryptic fragments produced from the purified reelin proteins revealed that the minimum unit of the multimer is a homodimeric reelin linked via Cys(2101) present in the central region and that this cysteine does not connect to the N-terminal region of reelin, which had been postulated as the primary oligomerization domain. A surface plasmon resonance binding assay confirmed that C2101A mutant reelin retained binding capability toward two neuronal receptors apolipoprotein E receptor 2 and very low density lipoprotein receptor. However, it failed to show signaling activity in the assay using the cultured neurons. These results indicate that an intact higher order architecture of reelin multimer maintained by both Cys(2101)-mediated homodimerization and other non-covalent association present elsewhere in the reelin primary structure are essential for exerting its full biological activity."

RAGE appears to contribute to several pathogenic features of chronic disorders of AD and diabetic complications. The adverse consequences of RAGE activation in these chronic disorders primarily result from its interaction with AD-associated Aβ and diabetes-associated advanced glycation end products. Excess amounts of Aβ/AGE trigger elevated RAGE expression, as such further enhancing the detrimental effects of RAGE activation. RAGE expression was found increased in AD-affected regions of the brain, such as the hippocampus and superior frontal cortex (10Chen X. Walker D.G. Schmidt A.M. Arancio O. Lue L.F. Yan S.D. Curr.

Apart from neurons and microglia, RAGE levels are also increased in cortical amyloid-laden vessels of cerebral amyloid angiopathy patients and in hippocampal microvessels of AD patients (10Chen X.

Moreover, RAGE expression is significantly higher in different organs of patients with diabetic complications (16Hong Z. Yang Y. Zhang C. Niu Y. Li K. Zhao X. Liu J.J.

These observations support the hypothesis that a gain of function of RAGE can contribute to the pathological progression of both AD and diabetes-associated vascular complications. In terms of vascular pathology, RAGE is believed to be involved in Aβ translocation across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), leading to increased Aβ accumulation and amyloid plaque burden in the brain (15Deane R. Du Yan S. Submamaryan R.K. LaRue B. Jovanovic S. Hogg E. Welch D. Manness L. Lin C. Yu J. Zhu H. Ghiso J. Frangione B. Stern A. Schmidt A.M. Armstrong D.L. Arnold B. Liliensiek B. Nawroth P. Hofman F. Kindy M. Stern D. Zlokovic B. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 907-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar). In addition, RAGE has been reported to be involved in Aβ-mediated migration of monocytes across the BBB endothelial monolayers (19Giri R. Shen Y. Stins M. Du Yan S. Schmidt A.M. Stern D. Kim K.S. Zlokovic B. Kalra V.K. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2000; 279: C1772-C1781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, how RAGE regulates endothelial cell membrane permeability, a cellular process crucial for our understanding of vascular pathology associated with AD and/or diabetic complications, remains to be determined. Here, using the human umbilical vein endothelial cell line ECV-304, we report that overexpression of human RAGE causes a plasma membrane repair deficit. Further studies demonstrate that RAGE expression leads to an increase of β-catenin that may be due to RAGE inhibition of GSK3β- mediated β-catenin phosphorylation and degradation. Increased β-catenin results in a decrease of F-actin stress fibers and an impairment of membrane resealing. These results suggest an important role for RAGE in remodeling the actin cytoskeleton and in inhibition of the plasma membrane resealing, revealing a potential cellular mechanism underling RAGE involvement in AD and diabetic complication-associated vascular pathology. RAGE antibodies were purchased from R&D Systems (monoclonal antibody (mAb) 11451 and goat polyclonal antibody 1145) and from Chemicon International (mAb 5328). Rabbit polyclonal anti-RAGE antibodies were also generated using the fusion protein of GST-RAGE-C-terminal tail as the antigen, as described previously (20Zhou Z. Immel D. Xi C.X. Bierhaus A. Feng X. Mei L. Nawroth P. Stern D.M. Xiong W.C. J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 1067-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Other monoclonal antibodies were purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories (β-catenin, p120cas, α-catenin, VE-cadherin, GSK3β, and GSK3β(pY216)), Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) (β1-integrin), and Sigma (β-actin). Polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Abcam (Occludin), Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Syndecan-1), Zymed Laboratories Inc. (ZO-1), and Cell signaling Technology, Inc. (phospho-β-catenin (Ser33/Ser37/Thr41) and phospho-β-catenin (Thr41/Ser45)). The “mock” vector (pTZ) (from Open Biosystems or AstraZeneca) was used for generation of the human RAGE lentiviral construct. A trans-lentiviral packaging system from Open Biosystems (catalog no. TLP4614 or TLP4615) was used for generation of lentiviral particles according to the manufacturer's protocol. The plasmids encoding the scramble shRNA and shRNA·β-catenin-1196 were generated as described previously (21Zhang B. Luo S. Dong X.P. Zhang X. Liu C. Luo Z. Xiong W.C. Mei L. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 3968-3973Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The GFP·β-catenin plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. X. Yu (Chinese Neuroscience Institute, Shanghai, China). The Myr-GFP·β-catenin plasmid was generated by insertion of sequence of myristoylation site 5′-GGT CTG TAC GCG TCT AAA CTG TCT-3′ using the QuikChange II XL mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as described by the manufacturer. For insertion, the primers used were b-cat-F (5′-CCG GTC GCC ACC ATG GGT CTG TAC GCG TCT AAA CTG TCT GTG AGC AAG GGC GAG-3′) and b-cat-R (5′-CTC GCC CTT GCT CAC AGA CAG TTT AGA CGC GTA CAG ACC CAT GGT GGC GAC CGG-3′). All constructs were verified by complete sequencing of the inserts. Human endothelial cell line (ECV-304) and human RAGE transduced ECV-304 stable cell lines were provided by AstraZeneca. These cell lines were cultured in M199 medium supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen), 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Mediatech, Inc., Herndon, VA). HEK293 cells were maintained in DMEM (Fisher) supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen), 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Mediatech, Inc.). For transient transfection, the indicated plasmids were transfected into RAGE-ECV, ECV304, or HEK293 cells by electroporation. RAGE and ECV-304 cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and mechanically disrupted with scraping in 0.8 ml of homogenization buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25 m sucrose) plus Complete miniprotease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) at 4 °C. Cells were further homogenized by 10 strokes of a Dunce homogenizer followed by five passages through a 27-gauge needle. Cell lysates were then centrifuged at 600 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml of homogenization buffer and centrifuged at 600 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the resultant pellet was the nuclear fraction. The combined supernatants were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C in an ultracentrifuge (Beckman TL-100) to produce membrane (pellet) and cytosolic (supernatant) fractions. For co-immunoprecipitation analysis, cells were lysed in modified radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm sodium chloride, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, and proteinase inhibitors). The precleared cell lysates (by incubation and precipitation with 40 μl of protein G agarose (50% of slurry) and 2 μg of normal mouse IgG in the radioimmune precipitation buffer) were incubated with mouse mAb 5328 (2 μg) for 2 h at 4 °C and 50 μl of protein G-agarose in 50% slurry for an additional 12 h at 4 °C. The protein G-precipitated RAGE·β-catenin complex was recovered by brief centrifugation followed by three washes with the radioimmune precipitation buffer. For Western blot analysis, cell lysates or immunoprecipitated protein complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blot analyses with the indicated antibodies as described previously (20Zhou Z.

First-strand cDNAs were synthesized by reverse transcription using the SuperScript III First Strand Synthesis kit (Invitrogen). Duplicate quantitative PCRs were carried out using a Qiagen QuantifastTM SYBR® Green PCR kit. The primers for RT-PCR are designed from the β-catenin gene NM_007614. Forward primer was 5′-CCC AGT CCT TCA CGC AAG AG-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-CAT CTA GCG TCT CAG GGA ACA-3′. All of the experiments were performed according to manufacturer's instructions. Immunostaining and confocal image analysis were carried out as described previously (41Hirose A. Tanikawa T. Mori H. Okada Y. Tanaka Y. FEBS Lett. 2010; 584: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature, permeabilized by 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15 min at room temperature, blocked with 5% bovine serum, and incubated with the indicated antibodies at a dilution of 1:200 to 1:500 for 1 h at room temperature. Double-labeled immunostaining was performed with appropriate fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) that were incubated at 1:500 dilutions for 1 h at room temperature. Mounting medium with DAPI (Fisher) was used to reveal the nuclei. To examine RAGE cell surface distribution, fixed cells were incubated with blocking serum and the indicated antibodies in the absence of 0.1% Triton X-100. Images were taken by a Carl Zeiss LSM510 META confocal microscope. A single cell laser assay was used for measuring cell membrane repairing activity as described previously (23McNeil, P. L., Clarke, M. F., Miyake, K. (2001) Curr. Protoc. Cell Biol. Chapter 12, Unit 12.14.Google Scholar). In brief, RAGE-ECV, ECV304, or ECV304 cells expressing the indicated plasmids were plated, respectively, onto a glass-bottom culture dish filled with PBS solution containing 1.26 mm Ca2+ and 0.82 mm Mg2+. Individual cells were selected for the assay. Membrane damage was induced in the presence of 2.5 μm FM 1-43/FM4-64 dye (Molecular Probes) with a two-photon confocal laser-scanning microscope (LSM 510, Zeiss) coupled to a 10-watt argon/titanium sapphire laser (Spectra-Physics Lasers Inc.). After images were scanned predamage, a 12 × 12-μm area of the membrane on the surface of the cell periphery was irradiated at 80% power for 1.00 s. Fluorescence images were captured at 5-s intervals for 5 min after the initial damage. The fluorescence intensities at the damaged site were measured by LSM 510 software and quantified using ImageJ software. Statistically significant differences between groups versus control were obtained with Student's t test, and significant differences are indicated by asterisks when p < 0.05. The up-regulation of RAGE in both AD and diabetic patients and animals led to the hypothesis that gain of RAGE function may contribute to the pathogenesis of these disorders. We thus generated a stable RAGE expression cell line, RAGE-ECV, in which ECV-304 cells were transduced with lentivirus encoding human RAGE (Fig. 1A). RAGE was undetected or very weakly detected in the parental ECV-304 cells (Fig. 1, B and C). By contrast, high levels of RAGE protein were detected in the RAGE-ECV cell line by both Western blot and immunostaining analyses using RAGE-specific antibodies (Fig. 1, B and C). RAGE protein appeared to be largely distributed on the cell surface and enriched at the cell-cell junctions (Fig. 1C). To further confirm RAGE protein in the cell surface, we performed immunostaining analysis in the absence or presence of 0.1% Triton X-100, which allows antibody to penetrate cell membrane into the cells. RAGE was detected at a high level in the cell surface and appeared to be “aggregated” in the cell-cell junctional sites (Fig. 1D). We also compared RAGE protein levels between Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble lysates (Fig. 1E). The majority (∼60%) of RAGE protein appeared to be soluble (Fig. 1E). In addition, the soluble RAGE in the culture medium was also detected in RAGE-ECV cells (∼25%) (Fig. 1E), which may be due to RAGE shedding caused by a membrane-associated proteinase, such as ADAM10 (24Raucci A. Cugusi S. Antonelli A. Barabino S.M. Monti L. Bierhaus A. Reiss K. Saftig P. Bianchi M.E. FASEB J. 2008; 22: 3716-3727Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). RAGE, a cell surface glycoprotein, led to the speculation that it may play a role in regulating plasma membrane plasticity because of cell surface glycoproteins are implicated in this event (25Miyake K. Tanaka T. McNeil P.L. PLoS One. 2007; 2: e687Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, a plasma membrane resealing assay was carried out in ECV-304 and RAGE-ECV cells after laser-induced local membrane injury at the cell periphery. The membrane injury and repair were revealed by a membrane-impermeable fluorescent dye (FM1-43) as it entered the cell through the injured membrane site and disappeared upon membrane resealing. The resealing process depends on various Ca2+-induced mechanisms (26McNeil P.L. Steinhardt R.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 697-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, the majority (∼60%) of ECV-304 cells showed an efficient membrane resealing response in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Remarkably, this calcium-induced resealing response was attenuated in RAGE-ECV cells (Fig. 2, A–C). Only ∼10% RAGE-ECV cells showed repair response after the injury (Fig. 2C). These results thus suggest a negative effect by RAGE on plasma membrane repair. Local actin cytoskeletal depolymerization is necessary for membrane resealing events (27McNeil P.L. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 873-879Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We thus examined if F-actin structures are altered in RAGE-ECV cells. Phalloidin staining analysis of F-actin in ECV-304 and RAGE-ECV cells revealed an increase of filopodia-like structures but a decrease of stress fibers in RAGE-ECV cells as compared with the ECV-304 control cells (Fig. 3, A and B). Filopodia-like structures were able to interconnect cells (Fig. 3A). We then examined if RAGE was associated with these F-actin-positive filopodia-like structures. Indeed, a colocalization of RAGE with F-actin labeled by phalloidin at the filopodia was observed (Fig. 3A). These F-actin structures appeared to be dynamic and were regulated by cell density, and the majority (∼60%) of RAGE-ECV cells with filopodia-like structure was found at lower cell density culture (data not shown). These results suggest that RAGE expression is sufficient to reorganize F-actin cytoskeleton with an increase of filopodia but a decrease of stress fibers, providing a potential mechanism underlying RAGE inhibition of membrane resealing. To further investigate molecular mechanisms underlying RAGE regulation of membrane repair and F-actin remodeling, we compared the expression of major cell adhesion-associated proteins in ECV-304 and RAGE-ECV cells. The two major types of cell-cell junctions formed between endothelial cells are adherens junctions (AJs) and tight junctions (TJs). TJ proteins include occludins, claudins, and junctional adhesion molecules and their adaptors (e.g. ZO-1). AJs contain VE-cadherin and its associated catenins (α, β, and p120cas). Interestingly, Western blot analysis demonstrated an increase of β-catenin in RAGE-ECV cells compared with ECV-304 cells (Fig. 4, A and B). Other AJ-associated proteins, such as α-catenin, p120cas, and VE-cadherin, were also slightly increased in RAGE-ECV cells (Fig. 4A). In contrast, ZO-1, a TJ marker, was reduced in RAGE-ECV cells (Fig. 4, A and B). Focal adhesion kinase, claudin-5, syndecan-1, and β-actin were unchanged (Fig. 4A) (data not shown). These results suggest an increase of AJ-associated cell-cell adhesion proteins, especially β-catenin, in RAGE-ECV cells. Two major pools of β-catenin are present in cells: the AJ junctional (cell membrane) pool and the cytosolic-nuclear pool (28Wu D. Pan W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2010; 35: 161-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). The cytosolic pool of β-catenin is at low levels normally because it is constitutively phosphorylated by GSK3 and rapidly degraded through the ubiquitin-proteasome system (28Wu D. Pan W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2010; 35: 161-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). We thus asked which pool(s) of β-catenin is increased in RAGE-ECV cells. Cell fractionation and Western blot analysis indicated that cell membrane, cytosol, and nuclear pools of β-catenin were all higher in RAGE-ECV cells as compared with ECV-304 cells (Fig. 4C). These results thus demonstrated that β-catenin in RAGE-ECV cells was increased not only in the cytoplasm and nuclear compartments but also in the cell-cell junctions. To understand how RAGE increases β-catenin, we first compared the β-catenin transcript level between ECV-304 and RAGE-ECV cell lines by real-time PCR analysis. No significant difference of β-catenin expression was observed (Fig. 5A), suggesting that RAGE up-regulation of β-catenin is largely at the post-transcriptional level. We then assessed if β-catenin Ser/Thr phosphorylation, an event crucial for β-catenin protein turnover, is altered in RAGE-ECV cells. Threonine 41 and serine 45 in β-catenin are known to be phosphorylated by casein kinase I, which primes β-catenin for subsequent GSK3 phosphorylation at serine 33/37 in the N terminus of β-catenin (Fig. 5B) (28Wu D. Pan W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2010; 35: 161-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar, 29Xu C. Kim N.G. Gumbiner B.M. Cell Cycle. 2009; 8: 4032-4039Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated β-catenin is then recognized by β-Trcp and rapidly degraded by the proteasome (28Wu D. Pan W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2010; 35: 161-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar, 29Xu C. Kim N.G. Gumbiner B.M. Cell Cycle. 2009; 8: 4032-4039Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis using these phosphorylation state-specific antibodies showed that p33/37/41·β-catenin, but not p41/45·β-catenin, was lower in RAGE-ECV cells versus ECV-304 cells (Fig. 5, C and D), indicating that GSK3, but not casein kinase I, activity may be suppressed by RAGE expression. This notion was further confirmed by Western blot analysis using an antibody specific for tyrosine 216-phosphorylated GSK3β, an active form of GSK3β. Reduced Tyr(P)216-GSK3β was observed in RAGE-ECV cells relative to ECV-304 cells (Fig. 5, E and F). These results thus suggest that RAGE suppression of GSK3β-induced β-catenin phosphorylation may be one of the underlying mechanisms for RAGE increase of β-catenin level. Because RAGE was enriched in cell-cell junctions, where β-catenin is largely localized (Fig. 1C), we wanted to examine if RAGE is associated with β-catenin at the AJ junctions, leading to the increase of β-catenin at these structures. Co-immunostaining analysis indeed demonstrated a co-localization of RAGE with β-catenin in RAGE-ECV cells (Fig. 6, A and B). Again, many filopodia-like structures were present at cell-cell junctions of RAGE-ECV but not ECV-304 cells (Fig. 6, A and B). These filopodia-like structures were positively labeled not only by RAGE antibody and phalloidin but also by β-catenin antibody (Fig. 6, A and B). ZO-1 was not detected in these filopodia-like filaments (data not shown). These results suggest that expression of RAGE in ECV-304 cells may cause an increase of an “immature” type of AJs and imply that RAGE may interact with β-catenin. The possible interaction of RAGE with β-catenin was further examined by co-immunoprecipitation analysis of lysates from HEK293 cells expressing RAGE and Myr-GFP·β-catenin. Although we did not detect endogenous β-catenin in the RAGE immunocomplexes (Fig. 6C; indicated by open arrows), a membrane-associated β-catenin (e.g. Myr-GFP·β-catenin) was associated with RAGE immunocomplexes (Fig. 6C; indicated by closed arrows). These results thus suggest that RAGE may interact with membrane-associated β-catenin. We next asked if β-catenin in RAGE-ECV cells contributes to the RAGE-induced decrease of F-actin stress fibers. To this end, a plasmid encoding shRNA-β-catenin (indicated by GFP) was generated, which specifically suppressed β-catenin but not RAGE expression when transfected into RAGE-ECV cells (Fig. 7A). Suppressing β-catenin expression in RAGE-ECV cells (indicated by GFP) showed an increase of stress fibers as compared with that of RAGE-ECV cells without GFP expression (Fig. 7A), indicating a rescue of this phenotype. Expression of scramble shRNA, on the other hand, had no effect, showing a similar decrease of stress fibers as that in untransfected RAGE-ECV cells (Fig. 7B). These results thus demonstrate that up-regulation of β-catenin in RAGE-ECV cells is necessary for the decrease of actin stress fibers by RAGE. To further test this view, we determined if overexpression of β-catenin in an ECV-304 cell affects F-actin stress fiber formation as RAGE does. Indeed, ECV-304 cells expressing GFP·β-catenin or Myr-GFP·β-catenin exhibited significant reduction of stress fibers (Fig. 7, C and D), indicating that β-catenin is sufficient to attenuate stress fiber formation in ECV-304 cells. Taken together, these results suggest that the increase of β-catenin in RAGE-ECV cells is responsible for RAGE inhibition of F-actin stress fibers. We then asked if β-catenin is also involved in RAGE inhibition of membrane resealing. As shown in Fig. 8, ECV-304 cells expressing GFP showed normal calcium-induced membrane-repairing activity in response to the laser injury. However, cells expressing GFP·β-catenin or Myr-GFP·β-catenin abolished the membrane-resealing effect, exhibiting continued entry of the membrane-impermeable dye (FM4-64) into the injury cells (Fig. 8, C and D). These results thus suggest that up-regulation of β-catenin in ECV-304 cells also cause an impaired membrane resealing, in a similar manner as that of RAGE, supporting the view for RAGE·β-catenin signaling in inhibition of membrane resealing. Our results using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (ECV-304) overexpressing RAGE demonstrate that RAGE up-regulation (i) increases the β-catenin level, (ii) induces remodeling of the F-actin cytoskeleton with a decrease of stress fibers but an increase of filopodia, and (iii) attenuates plasma membrane resealing. These results led to the speculation that RAGE, via inhibition of GSK3β activity and interaction with β-catenin at cell-cell junctions, increases β-catenin, which inhibits F-actin stress fiber formation and contributes to the impaired membrane resealing. Plasma membrane injury is common in many cells that operate under conditions of mechanical stress, including skeletal and cardiac muscle myocytes, epithelial cells lining the gastrointestinal tract, and endothelial cells of blood vessels (30McNeil P.L. Kirchhausen T. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 499-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Under normal conditions, plasma membrane can be resealed via various Ca2+-dependent mechanisms. The damaged plasma membrane can be patched with internal membranes delivered to the cell surface by exocytosis, repaired by endocytosis of the injured membrane sites, and/or removed by shedding membrane microparticles (31Bi G.Q. Alderton J.M. Steinhardt R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1747-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Proteins featured in membrane resealing are Ca2+ sensors, or their activity is regulated by Ca2+ sensors, including families of annexins, synaptotagmins, SNAREs, ferlins, and MG53, a member of the TRIM protein family (32Rao S.K.

Biol. 2009; 2: 225-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In addition, cell surface glycoproteins are implicated in membrane resealing because lectin binding of cell surface glycoproteins prevents membrane resealing (25Miyake K. Tanaka T. McNeil P.L. PLoS One. 2007; 2: e687Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). When membrane resealing is impaired, cells undergo death, which contributes to the pathogenesis of multiple disorders, including muscular dystrophy (30McNeil P.L. Kirchhausen T. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 499-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). RAGE has been implicated in the pathogenesis of AD and diabetes-associated complications(37Yan S.D. Bierhaus A. Nawroth P.P. Stern D.M. J. Alzheimers Dis. 2009; 16: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Our results using ECV-304 cells, an in vitro model for the blood-brain barrier (BBB) (38Kuchler-Bopp S. Delaunoy J.P. Artault J.C. Zaepfel M. Dietrich J.B. Neuroreport. 1999; 10: 1347-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 39Rho J.H. Roehrl M.H. Wang J.Y. Protein J. 2009; 28: 148-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), suggest a negative role of RAGE in the endothelial cell membrane resealing. Because RAGE is up-regulated under pathological conditions (e.g. in AD and diabetic complications), we speculate that increased RAGE at the BBB may lead to an impaired membrane resealing, thereby causing endothelial cell death and promoting further BBB leakage and vascular angiopathy. How does RAGE attenuate calcium-induced cell membrane resealing? One hypothesis is that RAGE may promote cell surface glycoprotein aggregation, in a manner similar to lectin inhibition of membrane repair (25Miyake K. Tanaka T. McNeil P.L. PLoS One. 2007; 2: e687Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Another hypothesis is that RAGE may form homodimers or oligomers by itself, and such complexes alter plasma membrane plasticity. Both hypotheses do not mutually exclude each other and remain to be investigated further. In addition, our results suggest that RAGE cell surface complex appears to increase β-catenin at cell-cell junctions, which may attenuate cell matrix-induced F-actin stress fiber formation and prevent cell membrane resealing. The latter view is in line with the following observations. RAGE-ECV cells exhibit a decrease of stress fibers and focal adhesions (data not shown) but an increase of microfilopodia, implicating a defective ECM-integrin signaling in these cells. The remodeled F-actin structures in RAGE-ECV cells correlate well with the alterations of cell-cell adhesions (e.g. increase of immature AJs) and increase of β-catenin (FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6). Suppression of β-catenin expression in RAGE-ECV cells rescued RAGE inhibition of stress fiber phenotype, and overexpression of β-catenin in ECV-304 cells decreases their stress fiber formation (Fig. 7). Finally, both increase of β-catenin and inhibition of F-actin remodeling are involved in suppressing plasma membrane resealing (Fig. 8) (27McNeil P.L. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 873-879Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to β-catenin, we are aware that RAGE interacts with diaphanous-1, a formin-like protein that is involved in actin cytoskeleton remodeling (40Hudson B.I. Kalea A.Z. Del Mar Arriero M. Harja E. Boulanger E. D'Agati V. Schmidt A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 34457-34468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), and RAGE regulation of Rho family GTPases (41Hirose A. Tanikawa T. Mori H. Okada Y. Tanaka Y. FEBS Lett. 2010; 584: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), which may be another mechanism(s) underlying RAGE regulation of F-actin remodeling. The exact molecular mechanisms by which RAGE increases β-catenin level remain elusive. RT-PCR analysis failed to show an increase of β-catenin transcript in RAGE-ECV cells, excluding a transcriptional mechanism. Our results suggest that RAGE may stabilize β-catenin protein at the cell-cell junctions, thus preventing its degradation. In support of this view are the observations that cell-cell junctional β-catenin is increased in RAGE-ECV cells and that tyrosine 216-phosphorylated GSK3β (an active form of GSK3β) and GSK3β induced serine 33/37 phosphorylation of β-catenin (an event causing β-catenin degradation) are reduced in RAGE-ECV cells (FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5). We noted a decrease of ZO-1 in RAGE-ECV cells, which may be a consequence of the increase of β-catenin because both AJ and TJ proteins frequently regulate each other. In fact, ZO-1 binds to both tight junction protein, claudin, and adherens junction protein, α-catenin (42Itoh M. Nagafuchi A. Moroi S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the reduced ZO-1 in RAGE-ECV cells may contribute to the increase of immature AJ formation because ZO-1 is required for the formation of beltlike mature AJs in epithelial cells (43Ikenouchi J. Umeda K. Tsukita S. Furuse M. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 779-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Taken together, RAGE expression in endothelial cells leads to altered F-actin cytoskeleton and cell-cell adhesions and impaired plasma membrane repair, which may underlie its detrimental role in the BBB pathology associated with AD and/or diabetes.

https://openalex.org/W2061674189,"Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1) is a multi-transmembrane protein that mediates the absorption of dietary and biliary cholesterol through vesicular endocytosis. The subcellular localization of NPC1L1 is regulated by cholesterol. Cholesterol depletion induces the transport of NPC1L1 to plasma membrane (PM) from endocytic recycling compartment that requires MyoVb·Rab11a·Rab11-FIP2 triple complex, and cholesterol-replenishment renders the internalization of NPC1L1 together with cholesterol. Here, we find that GTP-bound Cdc42 interacts with NPC1L1. Cholesterol depletion regulates the activation of Cdc42 and enhances NPC1L1-Cdc42 interaction. Overexpression of constitutive GTP-bound Cdc42 mutant form or knockdown of Cdc42 inhibits the transport of NPC1L1 to the PM and disturbs the cholesterol-regulated binding of NPC1L1 to Rab11a, MyoVb, and actin. Knockdown of Cdc42 downstream effectors N-WASP or Arp3 also leads to the similar results. In liver-specific Cdc42 knock-out (Cdc42 LKO) mice, NPC1L1 fails to localize to bile canaliculi, and the biliary cholesterol cannot be efficiently reabsorbed. These results indicate that Cdc42 controls the cholesterol-regulated transport and localization of NPC1L1, and plays a role in cholesterol absorption."
https://openalex.org/W2065436505,"Cardiac repolarization is controlled by the rapidly (IKr) and slowly (IKs) activating delayed rectifier potassium channels. The human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) encodes IKr, whereas KCNQ1 and KCNE1 together encode IKs. Decreases in IKr or IKs cause long QT syndrome (LQTS), a cardiac disorder with a high risk of sudden death. A reduction in extracellular K+ concentration ([K+]o) induces LQTS and selectively causes endocytic degradation of mature hERG channels from the plasma membrane. In the present study, we investigated whether IKs compensates for the reduced IKr under low K+ conditions. Our data show that when hERG and KCNQ1 were expressed separately in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells, exposure to 0 mm K+ for 6 h completely eliminated the mature hERG channel expression but had no effect on KCNQ1. When hERG and KCNQ1 were co-expressed, KCNQ1 significantly delayed 0 mm K+-induced hERG reduction. Also, hERG degradation led to a significant reduction in KCNQ1 in 0 mm K+ conditions. An interaction between hERG and KCNQ1 was identified in hERG+KCNQ1-expressing HEK cells. Furthermore, KCNQ1 preferentially co-immunoprecipitated with mature hERG channels that are localized in the plasma membrane.

Pflugers Arch. 1987; 410: 596-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), it is now clear that IK is mediated by two distinct types of channels, the rapidly (IKr) and the slowly activating delayed rectifier potassium channels (IKs) (3Sanguinetti M.C.

Nature. 1996; 384: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). IKr is encoded by the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG, also known as KCNH2) (3Sanguinetti M.C. Jiang C. Curran M.E. Keating M.T. Cell. 1995; 81: 299-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2161) Google Scholar, 4Trudeau M.C. Warmke J.W. Ganetzky B. Robertson G.A. Science. 1995; 269: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). IKs is encoded by both KCNQ1 and KCNE1. KCNQ1 (also known as KvLQT1) encodes the pore-forming α subunit, and KCNE1 (also known as minK) encodes the regulatory β subunit of IKs (5Sanguinetti M.C. Curran M.E. Zou A. Shen J. Spector P.S.

Nature. 1996; 384: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). Both IKr and IKs are critical for cardiac repolarization. Naturally occurring mutations in KCNQ1 cause type 1 long QT syndrome (LQT1). Similarly, mutations in hERG cause LQT2 and mutations in KCNE1 cause LQT5. These mutations impair the function of either IKs or IKr and account for the majority (>90%) of inherited long QT syndromes (7Keating M.T. Sanguinetti M.C. Cell. 2001; 104: 569-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a number of medications can interfere with proper hERG function, which results in acquired long QT syndrome (8Sanguinetti M.C. Tristani-Firouzi M.

A reduction in extracellular K+ concentration ([K+]o), clinically known as hypokalemia, also causes long QT syndrome (9Roden D.M. Woosley R.L. Primm R.K. Am. Heart J. 1986; 111: 1088-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that a reduction in [K+]o prolongs rabbit QT intervals on the electrocardiogram (ECG) and decreases cell surface density of both IKr in rabbit hearts and hERG channels in stable cell lines (10Guo J.

Res. 2010; 106: 1072-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We further showed that low K+ exposure induces rapid endocytic degradation of mature hERG channels, leading to a decreased hERG channel density at the plasma membrane (10Guo J. Massaeli H. Xu J. Jia Z. Wigle J.T. Mesaeli N. Zhang S. J. Clin. Invest. 2009; 119: 2745-2757Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 11Massaeli H. Guo J. Xu J. Zhang S. Circ.

Chem. 2011; 286: 6751-6759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In contrast, low K+ exposure does not affect the expression level of either the EAG or Kv1.5 potassium channels and only moderately decreases the KCNQ1 + KCNE1 current (10Guo J. Massaeli H. Xu J. Jia Z. Wigle J.T. Mesaeli N. Zhang S. J. Clin. Invest. 2009; 119: 2745-2757Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The repolarization of the cardiac action potential is under joint control of IKr and IKs (8Sanguinetti M.C. Tristani-Firouzi M. Nature. 2006; 440: 463-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar). In most physiological systems, when one component declines in function or abundance, another component with similar function compensates by promoting itself to higher activity levels, a phenomenon known as functional compensation (13Rizzuto R. Pozzan T. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). It would therefore be expected that a decrease in IKr may lead to an increase in IKs under hypokalemic conditions. In the present study, using electrophysiology, Western blot analysis, and immunocytochemistry, we investigated the interactions between IKr and IKs in a hypokalemia rabbit model and in the HEK 293 cell lines. Our data demonstrated that physical interactions exist between hERG and KCNQ1 proteins at the plasma membrane. Although KCNQ1 delays low K+-induced hERG degradation, the endocytic degradation of hERG channels subsequently promotes KCNQ1 degradation. As a result, low [K+]o reduces the density of both hERG and KCNQ1 in the plasma membrane. New Zealand White rabbits (2.5–3.0 kg) were divided into two groups (nine in each group) and fed a normal or a low K+ diet (TestDiet) for 6 weeks. To determine the earliest experimental end point and to ensure manageability of the electrophysiological experiments on isolated cardiac myocytes, the starting time of the rabbit experiments was staggered so that one rabbit was added to each group (control and low K+ diet) every week. The compositions of both diets were otherwise identical except for K+ content (0.62% versus 0.1%). Blood samples were taken weekly to monitor serum electrolyte levels at Kingston General Hospital Clinical Laboratory (Kingston, Canada). For each rabbit, a 9-min ECG recording was taken once a week on a lightly anesthetized condition, in which 1–2% isoflurane was administered via mask using a vaporizer and veterinary anesthesia machine (Queen's University Animal Care Service). ECG was recorded with a differential AC amplifier (A-M Systems Model 1700, Carlsborg, WA), digitized using a CED Micro 1401 and stored on a computer using Spike2 software for analysis (Cambridge Electronic Design, Cambridge, UK). Six ECG signals, one in every 90 s of the recording, were used to obtain the average QT and RR intervals to generate the data points. Ventricular myocytes were isolated from rabbits after 6 weeks on the control or the low K+ diet. Hearts were excised from anesthetized rabbits, mounted onto a Langendorff apparatus, and flushed at 20 ml/min with Ca2+-free Kreb's solution, which contained 110 mm NaCl, 2.6 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 25 mm NaHCO3, 11 mm glucose, 15 mm HEPES, and 0.5% BSA (pH 7.2). The hearts were then perfused with Kreb's solution plus collagenase II (80 mg/100 ml; 295 units/mg; Worthington). Left ventricular tissues were taken at different time points between 35 and 50 min and minced in Kraft-Brühe solution to obtain optimally isolated myocytes. The Kraft-Brühe solution contained 10 mm KCl, 120 mm potassium glutamate, 10 mm KH2PO4, 1.8 mm MgSO4, 10 mm taurine, 10 mm HEPES, 0.5 mm EGTA, 20 mm glucose, and 10 mm mannitol (pH 7.3). The cells were filtered through cheesecloth and kept in 1% BSA-containing Kraft-Brühe solution at room temperature for electrophysiological studies. hERG cDNA was provided by Dr. Gail Robertson (University of Wisconsin-Madison); The G601S hERG mutant was created using site-directed mutagenesis (11Massaeli H. Guo J. Xu J. Zhang S. Circ. Res. 2010; 106: 1072-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). KCNQ1 and KCNE1 cDNAs were provided by Dr. Michael Sanguinetti (University of Utah, Salt Lake City). A hERG-expressing HEK 293 stable cell line (hERG-HEK cells) was obtained from Dr. Craig January (University of Wisconsin-Madison). Stable cell lines expressing KCNQ1+KCNE1 or hERG+KCNQ1+KCNE1 were created. For the KCNQ1+KCNE1 stable cell line, 2 μg each of KCNQ1 and KCNE1 plasmids were co-transfected into HEK 293 cells grown in 60-mm dishes using Lipofectamine 2000. For the hERG+KCNQ1+KCNE1 stable cell line, 1.3 μg each of hERG, KCNQ1, and KCNE1 plasmids were co-transfected into HEK 293 cells grown in 60-mm dishes using Lipofectamine 2000. After transfection, the cells were cultured in 10% FBS-supplemented minimum essential medium (MEM) containing 1 mg/ml G418 for selection of transfected cells. Twenty-four single-cell derived colonies were selected for electrophysiological screening. The colony with characteristic IKs current (presence of both KCNQ1 and KCNE1) was selected to establish the KCNQ1+KCNE1 stable cell line. Similarly, the colony with both characteristic IKs current (slowly activating, presence of both KCNQ1 and KCNE1) and hERG current (presence of the hERG-specific tail current) was selected to establish the hERG+KCNQ1+KCNE1 stable cell line. The selected cell clones were amplified, confirmed for the expression of hERG, KCNQ1, and KCNE1 using Western blot analysis, and stored in liquid N2. To maintain the stable cell lines, the cells were cultured in MEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.4 mg/ml G418. For the hERG+KCNQ1+KCNE1 stable cell line, all genes were maintained within 40 passages as confirmed by the presence of both hERG and IKs (KCNQ1+KCNE1) currents. For transient transfection, 2 μg of KCNQ1, 2 of μg KCNE1, or 2 μg of KCNQ1 plus 2 μg of KCNE1 plasmids were transfected into hERG-HEK cells growing in a 60-mm dish at 60–70% confluence using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). A GFP plasmid (1 μg, pIRES2-EGFP, Clontech) was co-expressed to identify transfected cells in electrophysiological studies. 24–36 h after transfection, the cells were cultured in a custom made 0 mm K+ MEM-based medium or standard (5 mm K+) MEM-based medium for various periods. The cells were then harvested for Western blot, immunocytochemistry, and electrophysiological analysis. For electrophysiological studies, the cells were harvested from the culture dish by trypsinization with 0.05% trypsin (Invitrogen) and stored in standard MEM-based medium at room temperature. The cells were studied within 8 h of harvest. The whole cell patch clamp method was used. The standard bath solution contained 135 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES. This standard bath solution was used for recording IhERG, IKCNQ1+KCNE1 in cell lines, and the transient outward K+ current (Ito), inwardly rectifying K+ current (IK1), resting membrane potentials and action potentials in rabbit ventricular myocytes. The bath solution for recording IKs in rabbit ventricular myocytes contained (in mm): 140 NMG, 1 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 10 glucose, 10 HEPES, 0.01 nifedipine and 0.005 E4031. The pipette solution for recording IhERG contained (in mm): 135 KCl, 5 EGTA, 1 MgCl2, and 10 HEPES. The pipette solution for recording IKCNQ1+KCNE1 contained (in mm): 135 KCl, 5 EGTA, 5 K2ATP, 10 HEPES. The pipette solution for recording IKs, the transient outward K+ current (Ito), inwardly rectifying K+ current (IK1), resting membrane potentials and action potentials contained 135 mm KCl, 10 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MgATP, and 10 mm HEPES. For IKr recordings in rabbit ventricular myocytes, Cs+-rich solutions were used to isolate IKr from all other currents (14Zhang S. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2006; 290: H1038-H1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The bath solution contained 135 mm CsCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, and 0.01 mm nifedipine. The pipette solution contained 135 mm CsCl, 10 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgATP, and 10 mm HEPES. To record the Ba2+-mediated L-type Ca2+ currents in rabbit ventricular myocytes, the bath solution contained 140 mm TEACl, 5.4 mm BaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, and the pipette solution contained 135 mm CsCl, 10 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MgATP, and 10 mm HEPES. The pH of all bath solutions was adjusted to 7.4, and that of all pipette solutions was adjusted to 7.2 using appropriate hydroxide salts or HCl. Patch clamp experiments were performed at room temperature (22 ± 1 °C). Whole cell proteins from HEK 293 cells expressing various channels were used for analysis (10Guo J. Massaeli H. Xu J. Jia Z.

Proteins were separated on 8 or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels, transferred onto PVDF membrane, and blocked for 1 h with 5% nonfat milk. The blots were incubated with the primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Actin expression was used for loading controls. The blots were visualized with Fujifilm using the ECL detection kit (GE Healthcare). For immunoprecipitation, whole cell protein (0.5 mg) or cell surface protein was incubated with the appropriate primary antibody overnight at 4 °C and then precipitated with protein A/G plus agarose beads (Santa Cruz) for 4 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer, resuspended in 2× Laemmli sample buffer, and boiled for 5 min. The samples were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatants were collected and analyzed using Western blot. A cell surface protein isolation kit (Pierce) was used. The hERG+KCNQ1+KCNE1 stably expressing HEK cells were prepared in 100-mm cell culture plates and grown to 90% confluence. The cells were labeled with 10 ml of membrane-impermeant biotinylating reagent, Sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin, for 30 min at 4 °C. The quenching solution (0.5 ml) was then added to quench the reaction. The cells were then lysed with 0.5 ml of lysis buffer containing a protease inhibitor mixture. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C, the cell lysate was precipitated with Immobilized NeutrAvidin Gel (agarose beads). The bound proteins were eluted by incubating the resin in a Tris buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 10% glycerol) containing 50 mm DTT. The cell surface protein was then subjected to co-IP analysis to determine hERG-KCNQ1 interactions. To confirm that the 155-kDa hERG protein is localized at the plasma membrane, the hERG expressions between control (treated with the buffer solution, see below) and proteinase K-treated hERG-HEK cells were compared. Live cells were washed with PBS and treated with 200 μg/ml proteinase K (Sigma) in a physiological buffer (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4) at 37 °C for 30 min to cleave cell surface proteins. The reaction was terminated by adding ice-cold PBS containing 6 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 25 mm EDTA. The whole cell proteins were then extracted from the control and proteinase K-treated cells for Western blot analysis. hERG-HEK cells were transfected with an empty vector (control), KCNQ1, KCNE1, or KCNQ1+KCNE1. Thirty-six hours after transfection, the cell surface hERG channels were labeled by incubating the live cells with a rabbit anti-hERG primary antibody (Sigma). The cells were then exposed to 0 mm K+ medium for 4 h and fixed with freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. The fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min and blocked with 5% BSA for 1 h. The permeabilized cells were treated with a goat anti-KCNQ1 or goat anti-KCNE1 primary antibody (Santa Cruz) and Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated donkey anti-goat secondary antibody to detect KCNQ1 or KCNE1. After washing off excess secondary antibody with PBS (pH 7.4), cell surface hERG channels bound with rabbit anti-hERG (Kv11.1) primary antibody (Sigma) were detected using Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody. The nuclei were stained using Hoechst 33342 (0.2 μg/ml; Sigma). Images were acquired using a Leica TCS SP2 Multi Photon confocal microscope (Leica, Germany). MEM, custom 0 mm K+ MEM, and FBS were purchased from Invitrogen. Rabbit anti-Kv11.1 (hERG) antibody, electrolytes, MgATP, EGTA, HEPES, glucose, nifedipine, astemizole, and G418 were purchased from Sigma. Goat anti-hERG (C20 and N20), goat anti-KCNQ1, mouse anti-KCNQ1, goat anti-KCNE1, mouse anti-GAPDH, goat anti-actin primary antibodies, protein A/G Plus-agarose, donkey anti-goat IgG, goat anti-mouse IgG, and goat anti-rabbit IgG were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Alexa Fluor 594 donkey anti-goat and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were purchased from Invitrogen. E4031 was purchased from Calbiochem-EMD4 Biosciences. All of the data are expressed as the means ± S.E. A one-way analysis of variance was used to test for statistical significance between the control and test groups. A p value of 0.05 or less was considered significant. We have previously shown that lowering [K+]o prolongs the QT interval on the ECG and decreases IKr in a rabbit model (10Guo J. Massaeli H. Xu J. Jia Z. Wigle J.T. Mesaeli N. Zhang S. J. Clin. Invest. 2009; 119: 2745-2757Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). However, the effects of low [K+]o on IKs were not well defined. Although our previous data showed that IKs was reduced in rabbits after 4 weeks on a low K+ diet, the reduction did not reach statistical significance (10Guo J. Massaeli H. Xu J. Jia Z. Wigle J.T. Mesaeli N. Zhang S. J. Clin. Invest. 2009; 119: 2745-2757Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a compensatory increase in IKs was not found. To investigate the role of IKs and the potential interactions between IKr and IKs under hypokalemic conditions, we studied IKs in rabbits with hypokalemia induced by a low K+ diet for 6 weeks. Nine rabbits in each group were included in the study. As shown in Fig. 1A, prior to feeding, there was no difference in serum [K+] between the two groups of rabbits. Serum [K+] remained stable in rabbits fed the control diet during the 6-week experimental period (3.6 ± 0.1 mm at week 6 versus 3.5 ± 0.3 mm at week 0, n = 9, p > 0.05). However, serum [K+] in rabbits on the low K+ diet decreased significantly after 1 week and continued to decrease during the 6-week period (Fig. 1A). At week 6, serum [K+] was reduced to 1.2 ± 0.1 mm (n = 8, p < 0.01 compared with control), and sudden death began to occur (1 of 9 rabbits). This point represents an extreme hypokalemic condition in our experiments. The effects of hypokalemia on the QT intervals in rabbits were studied. The QT interval is dependent on the heart rate; the faster the heart rate (or the shorter the RR interval), the shorter the QT interval. To correct for the effect of RR interval on QT interval, the Bazett's formula, QTc = QT/[RR]½, has been widely used in clinical settings (15Funck-Brentano C. Jaillon P. Am. J. Cardiol. 1993; 72: 17B-22BAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Recently, a linear regression method has been used to correct the QT interval in rabbit ECGs. Bruner et al. (16Brunner M. Peng X. Liu G.X. Ren X.Q. Ziv O. Choi B.R. Mathur R. Hajjiri M. Odening K.E. Steinberg E. Folco E.J. Pringa E. Centracchio J. Macharzina R.R. Donahay T. Schofield L. Rana N. Kirk M. Mitchell G.F. Poppas A. Zehender M. Koren G. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 2246-2259PubMed Google Scholar) identified clear genotype differences in the QT/RR slope steepness in free-moving rabbits between wild-type littermate and LQT1/LQT2 animals. Using the genotype-specific heart rate correction formula, an expected QT interval (QT exp) at a given RR interval can be calculated (16Brunner M. Peng X. Liu G.X. Ren X.Q. Ziv O. Choi B.R. Mathur R. Hajjiri M. Odening K.E. Steinberg E. Folco E.J. Pringa E. Centracchio J. Macharzina R.R. Donahay T. Schofield L. Rana N. Kirk M. Mitchell G.F. Poppas A. Zehender M. Koren G. J. Clin.

We used isoflurane (1–2%) delivered via gas mask to sedate rabbits for ECG recordings. We constructed QT index by dividing the observed QT by the expected QT calculated using the formula (QTexp = 86 + 0.22*RR) generated by Bruner et al. (16Brunner M. Peng X. Liu G.X. Ren X.Q. Ziv O. Choi B.R. Mathur R. Hajjiri M. Odening K.E. Steinberg E. Folco E.J. Pringa E. Centracchio J. Macharzina R.R. Donahay T. Schofield L. Rana N. Kirk M. Mitchell G.F. Poppas A. Zehender M. Koren G. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 2246-2259PubMed Google Scholar) in nonanesthesized rabbits. As shown in Fig. 1B, the QT index in control diet rabbits was slightly greater than 1.0, reflecting the fact that isoflurane prolongs QT intervals in rabbits (17Odening K.E. Hyder O. Chaves L. Schofield L. Brunner M. Kirk M. Zehender M. Peng X. Koren G. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2008; 295: H2264-H2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, compared with a previous study by Odening et al. (17Odening K.E. Hyder O. Chaves L. Schofield L. Brunner M. Kirk M. Zehender M. Peng X. Koren G. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2008; 295: H2264-H2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), the effects of isoflurane on QT interval in our study was small, probably because of the low dose of isoflurane. Importantly, QT index remained constant during the 6-week experimental period in control rabbits but significantly increased in rabbits fed on low K+ diet (n = 8, p < 0.01; Fig. 1B). These data are consistent with the fact that the reduction in serum [K+] prolongs QT intervals in our previous study, in which the Bazett's formula was used to correct QT intervals (10Guo J. Massaeli H. Xu J. Jia Z. Wigle J.T. Mesaeli N. Zhang S. J. Clin. Invest. 2009; 119: 2745-2757Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The heart rate did not change significantly during 6 weeks of experiments and was not different between the control and low K+ diet groups (at week 6, 240 ± 4/min, n = 9, in control versus 255 ± 14/min, n = 8, in low K+ diet rabbits, p > 0.05). Representative ECG recordings from rabbits on low K+ diet at weeks 1 and 6 are shown in Fig. 1C. Because sudden death occurs beyond week 6, the experiments on hypokalemic rabbits were terminated at week 6. Ventricular myocytes from rabbits on the control and low K+ diet were isolated, and electrophysiological experiments were performed on the isolated cells using the patch clamp method. After 6 weeks on the normal or low K+ diet, the resting membrane potentials of rabbit ventricular myocytes were not different between control and low K+ groups (control, 79.7 ± 1.1 mV, n = 7; low K+, 77.2 ± 1.3 mV, n = 8; p > 0.05). For recording IK1 and Ito, cells were held at −40 mV. To analyze IK1, the current at the end of a 1-s hyperpolarizing step to −120 mV was measured. IK1 was not different between control and hypokalemic rabbit ventricular myocytes (21.9 ± 3.4 pA/pF in control, n = 6; 22.8 ± 2.3 pA/pF in hypokalemic rabbits, n = 9; p > 0.05). For Ito analysis, the peak current upon a 200-ms depolarizing step to 50 mV was measured. Ito was 3.7 ± 0.4 pA/pF in control (n = 6) and 3.9 ± 0.7 pA/pF in hypokalemic rabbit ventricular myocytes (n = 8, p > 0.05). To record the Ba2+-mediated L-type Ca2+ currents, ventricular myocytes were held at −40 mV to inactivate Na+ current. The peak Ba2+ current was observed upon a depolarizing step to 0 mV. The densities of the Ba2+-mediated L-type Ca2+ currents were 15.0 ± 2.9 pA/pF in control (n = 7) and 14.6 ± 2.7 pA/pF in low K+ diet rabbit ventricular myocytes (n = 8, p > 0.05). These data are consistent with our previous study (10Guo J. Massaeli H. Xu J. Jia Z. Wigle J.T. Mesaeli N. Zhang S. J. Clin. Invest. 2009; 119: 2745-2757Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Action potential duration at 90% repolarization (APD90) was significantly prolonged in ventricular myocytes from rabbits on the low K+ diet compared with that from control rabbits (Fig. 1D). Because IKr and IKs are jointly responsible for the repolarization of ventricular myocytes, they were the primary focus in the present study. To isolate IKr in ventricular myocytes for analysis, we used Cs+ as the charge carrier (14Zhang S. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2006; 290: H1038-H1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cs+ blocks other cardiac K+ channels, such as IK1, Ito, and IKs, but uniquely permeates through the native IKr and cloned hERG channels (14Zhang S. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2006; 290: H1038-H1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Thus, recording Cs+-carried IKr (IKr-Cs) using symmetrical Cs+ solutions represents an effective way to record pure IKr (14Zhang S. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2006; 290: H1038-H1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 18Guo J. Massaeli H. Li W. Xu J. Luo T. Shaw J. Kirshenbaum L.A. Zhang S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2007; 321: 911-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The IKr-Cs in ventricular myocytes from hypokalemic rabbits was significantly smaller than that from control rabbits (Fig. 1E). This conclusion is consistent with our previous data (10Guo J. Massaeli H. Xu J. Jia Z. Wigle J.T. Mesaeli N. Zhang S. J. Clin. Invest. 2009; 119: 2745-2757Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). IKs was activated by depolarizing steps to voltages between −70 and 50 mV in 10-mV increments for 4 s. IKs was s"

Reduced expression of p27 is commonly associated with poor prognosis in many malignancies, including gastric cancer. Cytoplasmic p27 mislocalization may be an additional indicator of high-grade tumors and poor prognosis in cancer. As chronic infection by Helicobacter pylori is the most important risk factor for gastric cancer development, we evaluated the effects of H. pylori on p27 expression and localization in gastric cancer cells. Co-culture of gastric cells with H. pylori induced cytoplasmic p27 expression and reduced nuclear p27 expression in vitro. Cytoplasmic p27 expression was associated with and dependent upon phosphorylation of p27 at T157 and T198: wild-type p27 accumulated in the cytoplasm, but non-phosphorylatable mutants affecting T157 or T198 were nuclear in H. pylori-infected cells. These post-translational p27 changes were secondary to activation of cellular phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) and AKT signaling pathways, and dependent upon a functional H. pylori cag pathogenicity island. We investigated the clinical significance of cytoplasmic p27 mislocalization in 164 cases of resected gastric cancer in tissue microarrays. In 97 cases (59%), cytoplasmic p27 mislocalization was observed, and this was associated with increased mortality in multivariate analysis. These results show that H. pylori infection induces AKT/PI3K-mediated phosphorylation of p27 at T157 and T198 to cause cytoplasmic p27 mislocalization in gastric cancer, and that p27 mislocalization is an adverse prognostic feature in gastric cancer. This is the first demonstration of the translocation of a specific bacterial virulence factor that post-translationally regulates a host cell CDK inhibitor. This is of particular significance, because p27 has both tumor-suppressive and oncogenic activities, depending upon its subcellular localization. Cytoplasmic mislocalization of p27 induced by H. pylori may be an important mechanistic link between H. pylori infection and gastric carcinogenesis."

In contrast, Trm1 from Aquifex aeolicus, a hyper-thermophilic eubacterium, modifies G27 as well as G26. Here, a gel mobility shift assay revealed that the T-arm in tRNA is the binding site of A. aeolicus Trm1. To address the multisite specificity, we performed an x-ray crystal structure study. The overall structure of A. aeolicus Trm1 is similar to that of archaeal Trm1, although there is a zinc-cysteine cluster in the C-terminal domain of A. aeolicus Trm1. The N-terminal domain is a typical catalytic domain of S-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent methyltransferases. On the basis of the crystal structure and amino acid sequence alignment, we prepared 30 mutant Trm1 proteins. These mutant proteins clarified residues important for S-adenosyl-l-methionine binding and enabled us to propose a hypothetical reaction mechanism. Furthermore, the tRNA-binding site was also elucidated by methyl transfer assay and gel mobility shift assay. The electrostatic potential surface models of A. aeolicus and archaeal Trm1 proteins demonstrated that the distribution of positive charges differs between the two proteins. We constructed a tRNA-docking model, in which the T-arm structure was placed onto the large area of positive charge, which is the expected tRNA-binding site, of A. aeolicus Trm1. In this model, the target G26 base can be placed near the catalytic pocket; however, the nucleotide at position 27 gains closer access to the pocket.
