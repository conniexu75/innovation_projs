https://openalex.org/W2065915664,"In regulating the internal homeostatic environment mammals, by necessity, employ behavioral strategies that differ from the tactics used in coping with contingencies in the external environment. When an animal consumes a meal, the palatability of that meal is automatically adjusted in accordance with the ultimate internal effects of that meal. If the meal causes toxicosis, the animal acquires an aversion for the taste of the meal; conversely, if recuperation follows ingestion of the meal, the taste of that meal is enhanced. Unlike the learning that occurs when externally referred visual and auditory signals are followed by punishment in the form of peripheral pain or reward in the form of food in the mouth, conditioning to the homeostatic effects of food can occur in a single trial and rarely requires more than three to five trials, even though the ultimate effects of the meal are delayed for hours. Paradoxically, the animal need not be aware of the ultimate internal effect in the same sense that it is aware of external contingencies. For example, an aversion can be acquired even if the animal is unconscious when the agent of illness is administered. Thus, the way in which food-effects are stored in memory may be fundamentally different from the way in which memories of specific time-space strategies devised for external contingencies are stored. This separation of function is indicated by limbic lesions which disrupt conditioning to a buzzer that is followed by shock and facilitate conditioning to a taste that is followed by illness. Operationally speaking, one can describe both aversion conditioning and buzzer-shock conditioning in the spacetime associationistic terms of classical conditioning. However, psychologically speaking, one must realize that in aversion conditioning the animal does not act as if it were acquiring an ""if-then"" strategy. It acts as if a hedonic shift, or a change in the incentive value of the flavor were taking place. Such hedonic shifts are critical in regulation of the internal milieu. When an animal is in need of calories, food tends to be more palatable; as the caloric deficit is restored, food becomes less palatable. If the animal's body temperature is below optimum, a warm stimulus applied to the skin is pleasant. When body temperature is too high, the converse is true. In this way, homeostatic states monitored by internal receptors produce changes in the incentive values of external stimuli sensed by the peripheral receptors, and guide feeding behavior. In mammals at least, the gustatory system, which provides sensory control of feeding, sends fibers to the nucleus solitarius. This brainstem relay station also receives fibers from the viscera and the internal monitors of the area postrema. Ascending fibers bifurcate at the level of the pons and project toward the feeding areas of the hypothalamus and the cortex. The olfactory system which primarily projects to the limbic system does not play a primary role in adjusting food incentives. Rather, it plays a secondary role in the activation of feeding, as do other external sensory systems. This specialized conditioning mechanism, which specifically adjusts gustatory hedonic values through delayed visceral feedback, is widespread among animals, including man and rat. These two species are remarkably similar in their thresholds and preferences for gustatory stimuli. The behavioral similarities are based on the animals' having similar gustatory systems, similar convergence of gustatory and internal afferents to the nucleus solitarius, and similar midbrain regulatory mechanisms. Thus, it is not surprising that the feeding of obese rats with internal hypothalamic damage resembles the feeding of obese human beings insensitive to the internal signs of this caloric state. Obviously, man has a highly specialized form of symbolic communication and the rat does not, yet man's cognitive specialization does not prevent him from developing aversions to food consumed before illness even when he knows that his illness was not caused by food (43)."
https://openalex.org/W2061864595,"Two treatments, fasting/refeeding and administration of liver X receptor (LXR) agonists, elevate the mRNA for sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) and enhance lipid synthesis in liver. These treatments do not affect the mRNA for SREBP-1a, an alternative transcript from the same gene. Through homologous recombination, we eliminated the exon encoding SREBP-1c from the mouse genome, leaving the SREBP-1a transcript intact. On a normal diet, livers of SREBP-1c(-/-) mice manifested reductions in multiple mRNAs encoding enzymes of fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis, including acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and fatty acid synthase (FAS). In contrast, SREBP-1c(-/-) livers showed a compensatory increase in hepatic SREBP-2 mRNA, accompanied by increased mRNA levels for cholesterol biosynthetic enzymes. In fasted/refed animals, ACC and FAS mRNAs rose, but not to the same extent as in wild-type livers. The refeeding-induced increase in SREBP-1c(-/-) mice was greater than in mice lacking SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP), in which all nuclear SREBPs are absent. Thus, SREBP-2 and/or SREBP-1a can substitute partially for SREBP-1c in permitting an insulin-mediated increase in ACC and FAS mRNAs. In contrast, mRNAs for several other lipogenic enzymes (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, malic enzyme, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, and stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1) showed a complete failure of the normal inductive response to refeeding, indicating specific reliance on SREBP-1c. Moreover, these mRNAs, as well as multiple other lipogenic mRNAs, showed a markedly blunted response to the LXR agonist T090137, indicating an essential role of SREBP-1c in the LXR response."

Mutations and loss of heterozygosity of theNF2 gene have been detected in NF2 patients and in various sporadic tumors, including schwannomas, meningiomas, and ependymomas (1Gusella J.F. Ramesh V. MacCollin M. Jacoby L.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1423: M29-M36PubMed Google Scholar). In further support of a role for NF2 in tumor suppression, mice heterozygous for an Nf2 mutation are predisposed to a wide variety of tumors with high metastatic potential (2McClatchey A.I.

The longest and predominant splice form of the Nf2gene codes for a 595-amino acid protein highly similar to the band 4.1 family of proteins. It is most closely related to the ERM proteins,moesin, ezrin, and radixin. The ERM proteins are thought to function as cell membrane-cytoskeleton linkers and are localized to cortical actin structures near the plasma membrane such as microvilli, membrane ruffles, and lamellipodia (4Tsukita S. Yonemura S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 70-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 5Tsukita S. Yonemura S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 53-58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Likewise, merlin is localized to cortical actin structures, in patterns that partially overlap with the ERMs (1Gusella J.F. Ramesh V. MacCollin M. Jacoby L.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1423: M29-M36PubMed Google Scholar). It has been proposed that intramolecular binding of the N-terminal and C-terminal domains conformationally regulates the ERM proteins by masking binding sites for interacting proteins. The ERMs can also form homodimers and heterodimers, among themselves and with merlin, adding an additional level of complexity to the regulation of these proteins (6Bretscher A. Chambers D. Nguyen R. Reczek D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 113-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The recently solved crystal structure of the moesin N/C-terminal complex strengthens this model of conformational regulation (7Pearson M.A. Reczek D. Bretscher A. Karplus P.A. Cell. 2000; 101: 259-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Given the sequence and, most likely, structural similarities of merlin to the ERM proteins, it is possible that merlin itself could be regulated in a similar fashion. Recent studies (8Matsui T.

Takai Y. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 37-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar) have implicated additional factors in the regulation of the ERMs, including phospholipids and phosphorylation. Previous work from our group and others (10Shaw R.J. McClatchey A.I. Jacks T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7757-7764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 11Shaw R.J.

Merlin is found in an hypophosphorylated form when the combination of cellular and environmental conditions are growth-inhibitory (10Shaw R.J. McClatchey A.I. Jacks T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7757-7764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). ERMs can be phosphorylated by Rho kinase, and this phosphorylation can affect intramolecular association and cellular localization. Phosphorylation and/or phospholipids may promote the transition of the proteins to an active form by “opening” intra- and intermolecular associations. These active monomers can then bind to other interacting proteins and the actin cytoskeleton and induce actin-rich membrane projections (5Tsukita S. Yonemura S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 53-58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar,8Matsui T. Maeda M. Doi Y. Yonemura S. Amano M. Kaibuchi K. Tsukita S. J.

McClatchey A.I. Jacks T. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 287-296PubMed Google Scholar). The induction of merlin phosphorylation by activated alleles of the Rho family GTPases has also been examined. Interestingly, although activated Rho did not induce noticeable phosphorylation of merlin, activated forms of Rac and cdc42 did. The site of Rac-induced phosphorylation was determined to be a serine at position 518; mutation of serine 518 results in reduced basal phosphorylation and eliminated Rac-induced phosphorylation (11Shaw R.J. Guillermo J.P. Curto M. Yaktine A. Pruitt W.M. Saotome I. O'Bryan J.P. Gupta V. Ratner N. Der C.J. Jacks T. McClatchey A.I. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 63-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Although Rac and cdc42 are implicated in the regulation of many pathways, they are most associated with regulation of cytoskeleton reorganization and gene expression (for recent reviews see Refs.14Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1666) Google Scholar, 15Schmitz A.A. Govek E.E. Bottner B. Van Aelst L. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 261: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 16Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 153-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (2048) Google Scholar). In light of the data demonstrating that activated Rac/cdc42 leads to phosphorylation and possible inactivation of merlin, the elucidation of the responsible effector pathways and their effects on merlin function are of major importance. Understanding this regulation of merlin could lead to a more complete appreciation of the effects of merlin loss in tumors. Wild-type merlin and S518A were subcloned from previously described vectors (10Shaw R.J. McClatchey A.I. Jacks T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7757-7764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) into theBamHI-EcoRI sites of pCDNA3 (Invitrogen). The GST-merlin recombinant substrates were prepared by PCR amplification of the 60 amino acid coding sequences from the wild-type and S518A versions of merlin (primer sequences are available upon request) and subcloned into EcoRI and XhoI sites of pGEX5-3x. Wild-type PAK2 was amplified and cloned into the BamHI andXhoI sites of pCDNA3 (Invitrogen). Activated PAK2 was made by inserting the T402E mutation by site-directed mutagenesis using the Quick-change kit, as instructed by the manufacturer (Stratagene). The PAK2 auto-inhibitory domain (amino acids 82–146) was amplified and cloned into pCDNA3. All plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing. Transfections were done with LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). The antibodies used are as follows: commercial merlin antibody SC331 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); PAK1-SC882, PAK2-SC1872, and PAK3-SC1871 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). SC1871 was demonstrated to be specific by Western blot comparison of extracts from cells overexpressing PAK1–3 (not shown). SC882 has been shown to be specific for PAK1 using PAK1−/− mouse embryo fibroblasts. 2J. Chernoff (Fox Chase Cancer Center), personal communication. SC1872 may also react with PAK1; however, this does not affect the conclusion drawn from the immunodepletion experiments shown in Fig. 3. Total cellular extracts were prepared by lysing the cells in cell lysis buffer: 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mmNaCl, 25 mm NaF, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors. The extracts were added into reactions containing 200 ng of GST substrate, 2 mmMgCl, 2 mm DTT, 100 μm cold ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. For the immunodepletion experiments extracts were incubated with the relevant antibody for 3 h at 4 °C. After four sequential exchanges of antibody, the presence of the protein in question was determined by Western blot analysis of both supernatant and the precipitate. Kinase reactions were carried out at 30 °C for 20 min. The substrate was washed 3 times in lysis buffer at 4 °C, and the reaction was terminated with protein sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. The samples were then resolved by SDS-PAGE and exposed to film. In the in vivo studies, cells were transfected with various expression vectors and harvested after 48 h into SDS boiling buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaF, 1% SDS). Cells were scraped off the plates and boiled for 5 min; protein concentration was determined by the BCA method (Pierce); and proteins were resolved by 9% SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blot analysis. Phosphatase treatment was described previously (10Shaw R.J. McClatchey A.I. Jacks T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7757-7764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). A chemically phosphorylated peptide (H-CKDTDMKRLS*MEIE-NH2; * = serine is phosphorylated) was coupled to SulfoLink coupling gel (Pierce) and used to immunize rabbits. A standard protocol of immunization was employed. Sera were purified by first passing it over an affinity column of the phospho-antigen (binding antibodies recognizing the peptide, phosphorylated and unphosphorylated). In a second step, the bound fraction was applied to a second column of the unphosphorylated peptide. The flow-through was collected and found to contain only phospho-specific antibodies. For ion-exchange chromatography, a Q-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) 10 × 10 column was run at pH 8.5 (diethanolamine buffer) and a linear NaCl gradient, with maximal activity eluting around 120–130 mm. A 60-fold enrichment was achieved with overall recovery of about 70%. For dye-ligand chromatography a Matrex Red A dye (Millipore) 10 × 10 column was used (pH 8, 0–500 mmKCl linear gradient), which gave 10-fold enrichment with 25% recovery. NIH3T3 or LLC-PK1 cells were plated on glass coverslips and transfected with various expression vectors. 24-h post-transfection cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and permeabilized with Triton X-100 for 10 min. Sc331 was used at 1:1000 dilution, and HM2175 was used at 1.0 μg/ml. Merlin phosphorylation is regulated in response to various stimuli (10Shaw R.J. McClatchey A.I. Jacks T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7757-7764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and phosphorylation of serine 518 can be induced in a Rac/cdc42-dependent manner (11Shaw R.J. Guillermo J.P. Curto M. Yaktine A. Pruitt W.M. Saotome I. O'Bryan J.P. Gupta V. Ratner N. Der C.J. Jacks T. McClatchey A.I. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 63-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). To identify the kinase that phosphorylates merlin on serine 518, NIH3T3 cells were co-transfected with expression vectors for merlin and the constitutively active forms of Rac/cdc42 kinase effectors. These included PAK1, PAK2, PAK3, MLK3, LIM kinase, MEKK1, and JNK. Extracts were made 48 h post-transfection and analyzed by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 1 A, PAK1–3 induced an increase in the slower migrating and hyperphosphorylated form of merlin (see also Ref. 11Shaw R.J. Guillermo J.P. Curto M. Yaktine A. Pruitt W.M. Saotome I. O'Bryan J.P. Gupta V. Ratner N. Der C.J. Jacks T. McClatchey A.I. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 63-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). All other effectors tested did not induce merlin phosphorylation and were confirmed as active with an independent substrate (not shown). This phosphorylation is serine 518-specific as the merlin S518A mutant, in which serine 518 was changed to alanine, runs as a single band corresponding to the hypophosphorylated from of wild-type merlin in the presence of the activated PAK kinases (Fig. 1 A). To discriminate between the different PAKs as candidate merlin kinases in NIH3T3 cells, we set out to purify the kinase activity over a series of chromatographic steps employing extracts from untransfected NIH3T3 cells that were serum-stimulated. Toward this goal, an in vitro kinase assay was established. The assay employs a recombinant substrate composed of residues 478–535 of merlin fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST). The recombinant substrate was purified from bacteria and then used in an in vitrokinase assay bound to glutathione-agarose beads. Activity is determined by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. This assay is highly specific for the merlin kinase, as the S518A version of the substrate was not phosphorylated to a significant extent under conditions that have been shown to induce merlin phosphorylation (Fig. 1 B). After an initial step of ammonium sulfate precipitation, the precipitate containing the activity was separated by ion-exchange chromatography on a Q-Sepharose column. Fractions were then examined for merlin kinase activity using the in vitro kinase assay and for PAK1, PAK2, and PAK3 levels by Western blotting. As shown in Fig.2 A, the maximal activity of merlin kinase was found in fractions 20–22 in this separation. PAK2 levels also peaked in fractions 20–22, whereas PAK1 levels peaked in fractions 23–27, and PAK3 levels peaked around fraction 30. Fractions 20–22 were taken from the ion exchange and used in a subsequent step of dye-ligand chromatography. Maximal activity of merlin kinase was observed in fractions 18–22. Again, PAK2 was present in a pattern that fully overlaps with the peak of merlin kinase activity (Fig.2 B), whereas PAK1 and PAK3 were no longer evident in these fractions (not shown). After four total steps of enrichment, which included ammonium sulfate precipitation, ion-exchange, dye-ligand chromatography, and gel filtration, more than 1200-fold enrichment of the kinase activity was achieved. When assessing the fractions of the various chromatographic steps by Western blot analysis, PAK2 levels consistently paralleled merlin kinase activity (Fig. 2 and not shown). Thus, by chromatographic separation, we were able to separate PAK1–3 and demonstrate that the merlin kinase activity from NIH3T3 cells co-fractionates with PAK2. The N-terminal regulatory domain of the PAKs has been shown to contain an auto-inhibitory domain (AID), which can act in trans (17Zhao Z.S. Manser E. Chen X.Q. Chong C. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibitory fragment in PAK2 resides between residues 82 and 146 (equivalent to the 83–149 AID of PAK1). To investigate further the role of PAK2 in induction of merlin phosphorylation in response to Rac/cdc42, we assessed the ability of the AID to inhibit this activity. NIH3T3 cells were co-transfected with expression vectors for full-length merlin, activated Rac or cdc42, and the PAK2 AID. The inclusion of the PAK2 AID significantly reduced the phosphorylation of merlin, as evident by the 3–4-fold decrease in the ratio of hyperphosphorylated to hypophosphorylated merlin in cells expressing the AID (Fig. 1 C). These data indicate that merlin kinase activity induced by Rac/cdc42 is sensitive to PAK inhibition and strengthen the claim that PAK2 is the responsible kinase downstream of Rac in NIH3T3 cells. As another approach to address whether PAK2 is directly responsible for merlin phosphorylation in this cell system, the enzyme was immunodepleted from extracts of serum-treated NIH3T3 cells. After four sequential rounds of immunoprecipitation, the amount of PAK2 in the extract was reduced, on average, by 2–3-fold (Fig. 1 D). Treated extracts were then used in kinase assays with the GST-merlin recombinant substrate; activity was determined by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 1 D, extracts immunodepleted for PAK2 (IP-PAK2) show a 2–3-fold reduction in kinase activity compared with those treated in a similar fashion without antibody added. Also, the immunodepletion of PAK3 (IP-PAK3) or PAK1 (IP-PAK1) from these extracts had little or no effect on merlin kinase levels of activity (Fig. 1 D). This demonstrates the requirement for PAK2 for the phosphorylation of merlin serine 518 under these conditions. To follow the function and localization of merlin phosphorylated at serine 518, we produced antibodies (HM2175) that preferentially recognize the phosphorylated form (see “Materials and Methods”). To assess the activity of this antiserum, protein extracts from LLC-PK1 cells ectopically expressing wild-type merlin were used in Western blot analysis with either SC331 or HM2175 antibodies. The SC331 antibody detected both the hypo- and hyperphosphorylated form of merlin, whereas the HM2175 antibody preferentially detected the hyperphosphorylated form of the protein (Fig. 3 A). At high concentrations of merlin, HM2175 did recognize the hypophosphorylated form to some extent (Fig. 3 A). To validate further the specificity of HM2175, merlin was ectopically expressed along with active PAK2 in NIH3T3 cells, immunoprecipitated, and analyzed by Western blot, before and after treatment with phosphatase. As shown in Fig. 3 B, reactivity of the HM2175 antibody was significantly reduced following phosphatase treatment, whereas the non-phospho-directed SC331 antibody recognized merlin forms in all lanes. The phospho-directed antibodies were tested for specificity in immunocytochemistry. LLC-PK1 cells were transfected with vectors expressing either wild-type merlin or the merlin S518A mutant. Fixed cells were then incubated with either the SC331 or HM2175 antibodies. Although SC331 recognized both merlin forms (Fig. 3 C, panels 1 and 2), the HM2175 antibody recognized only ectopic wild-type merlin (Fig. 3 C, panels 5 and 6). This pattern was observed in many cell lines of both epithelial and fibroblastic origin (not shown). Thus, the HM2175 antibodies preferentially recognize the phosphorylated form of merlin both in Western blot analysis and immunocytochemistry. To visualize subcellular localization of the different forms of merlin, LLC-PK1 epithelial cells were transfected with wild-type merlin or the merlin S518A or S518D (phospho-mimicking) mutants and incubated with the SC331 antibody. As shown in Fig. 3 C (panel 1), wild-type merlin mainly localized to microvilli. Lower amounts of the protein were present in larger membrane protrusions and in cortical actin structures. Similar results were obtained with the S518A mutant (panel 2). However, the S518D mutant was localized predominantly in the larger membrane protrusions (panel 3). Likewise, a shift to the larger membrane protrusions was observed when wild-type merlin was co-transfected with active PAK2 to increase merlin phosphorylation (panel 4). Importantly, the localization of the S518A mutant was not affected by co-transfected PAK2 (not shown), indicating that phosphorylation of serine 518 is required for relocalization. To confirm this observation, HM2175 was used to stain cells transfected only with wild-type merlin. As expected, the HM2175 antibody stained wild-type merlin mainly in the larger cellular protrusions (panel 5). This reinforces the observation that the phosphorylation of serine 518 is required for the redistribution of merlin and is not a consequence of simply mutating serine 518 to aspartic acid. We present here several independent lines of evidence supporting PAK2 as the kinase responsible for phosphorylation of serine 518 on theNf2 tumor suppressor gene product, merlin. Of all Rac/cdc42 kinase effectors tested only PAK1–3 induced the phosphorylation of merlin serine 518 in vivo. We were able to separate PAK2 from PAK1 and PAK3 biochemically and demonstrate that merlin kinase activity co-elutes in parallel with PAK2 in NIH3T3 cells. The use of the dominant-negative fragment (PAK2-AID) and immunodepletion of PAK2 directly reinforce the identification of PAK2 as the merlin kinase. Additional circumstantial evidence can be found in the amino acid context of the serine 518 in merlin (MKRLSM) and is similar to many PAK recognition sites such as the pHOX p47 site (RKRLSQ), which has been shown to be an in vivo substrate of the PAKs (18Knaus U.G. Heyworth P.G. Evans T. Curnutte J.T. Bokoch G.M. Science. 1991; 254: 1512-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). By using the generic anti-merlin antibody SC331, wild-type protein and the S518A mutant were observed mostly localized to microvilli and to a small number of larger membrane protrusions and cortical structures in LLC-PK1 cells. However, when the merlin S518D mutant or wild-type merlin plus active PAK2 were introduced into these cells, a marked redistribution of merlin to membrane protrusions was observed. The HM2175 antibodies stained wild-type merlin in a similar pattern as the SC331-based staining of the merlin S518D mutant or wild-type merlin in the presence of active PAK2. The localization of phosphorylated merlin to such protrusions is not exclusive as phospho-merlin can still be observed in microvilli and cortical actin at a somewhat reduced level. The redistribution was dependent on phosphorylation of serine 518, because the merlin S518A mutant transfected with active PAK2 did not shift localization. This redistribution of merlin is highly reminiscent of the redistribution of ezrin in response to phosphorylation (12Gautreau A. Louvard D. Arpin M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The data presented here are consistent and complementary to recent data demonstrating induction of serine 518 phosphorylation by Rac/cdc42 (11Shaw R.J. Guillermo J.P. Curto M. Yaktine A. Pruitt W.M. Saotome I. O'Bryan J.P. Gupta V. Ratner N. Der C.J. Jacks T. McClatchey A.I. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 63-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The identification of PAK2, which can be directly activated by Rac/cdc42, as the merlin kinase functionally connects merlin with the Rac/cdc42 pathway. That merlin can inhibit Rac-induced signaling and that the immediate downstream effector, PAK2, phosphorylates and, perhaps, inactivates merlin reinforces the possibility of a “feed-forward” mechanism. In such a model, merlin would function at steady-state to down-regulate Rac/cdc42-induced signaling. Once activated, Rac/cdc42 would activate PAK2, which in turn would phosphorylate merlin and relieve its inhibitory effect on Rac/cdc42. Functionally, this could be achieved by different mechanisms and impinge on these pathways at different levels (11Shaw R.J. Guillermo J.P. Curto M. Yaktine A. Pruitt W.M. Saotome I. O'Bryan J.P. Gupta V. Ratner N. Der C.J. Jacks T. McClatchey A.I. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 63-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Merlin could inhibit signaling by acting upstream or upon effectors downstream to Rac/cdc42, or both. This would not be unprecedented as it has been suggested that activation of ERMs is required for the activation of Rho by lysophosphatidic acid and that Rho, in turn, induces phosphorylation of the ERMs (19Lamb R.F. Roy C. Diefenbach T.J. Vinters H.V. Johnson M.W. Jay D.G. Hall A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The observed shift in merlin localization after phosphorylation of serine 518 raises the possibility that merlin controls the subcellular localization of a molecule such as RhoGDI is worthy of consideration. It is reasonable to suggest that the inhibitory function of merlin on Rac/cdc42-signaling is critical to its tumor suppressor function, as Rac signaling is closely linked to cellular transformation (20Qiu R.G. Chen J. McCormick F. Symons M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11781-11785Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). For example, Rac activation is required for the full transformed phenotype induced by Tiam and Ras (21Habets G.G. Scholtes E.H. Zuydgeest D. van der Kammen R.A. Stam J.C. Berns A. Collard J.G.

Rac and its regulators have also been shown to regulate cell motility and invasiveness (25Evers E.E. Zondag G.C. Malliri A. Price L.S. ten Klooster J.P. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. Eur. J.

Cell. 1997; 91: 949-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). The fact that Nf2+/− mice have highly metastatic tumors (2McClatchey A.I. Saotome I. Mercer K. Crowley D. Gusella J.F. Bronson R.T. Jacks T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1121-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) with loss of the wild-type Nf2 allele is also consistent with loss of merlin leading to activation of the Rac signaling pathways. Although implicated in various cellular processes, the roles of the different members of the PAK family are not well defined. The identification of substrates specific to the different PAKs is one method of defining their specific functions. Presently, Raf-1 is a known PAK2 substrate and Bad and LIM kinase are specific substrates of PAK1 (29King A.J. Sun H. Diaz B. Barnard D. Miao W. Bagrodia S. Marshall M.S. Nature. 1998; 396: 180-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 30Schurmann A. Mooney A.F. Sanders L.C. Sells M.A. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Bokoch G.M. Mol. Cell.

This differential activity may reflect different cell types and/or environmental conditions used in specific experiments or may reflect true functional differences between the effector kinases. The identification of PAK2 as the kinase involved in merlin regulation and localization is a strong link between the well established Rac/cdc42 signaling pathways with a tumor suppressor gene of unknown function. The further elucidation of these mechanisms will, undoubtedly, lead to a better understanding of merlin function and may suggest therapeutic strategies for Nf2-deficient tumors. We thank E.

Calmodulin (CaM), a ubiquitous and multifunctional Ca2+ sensor, interacts with a wide variety of cellular proteins and modulates their activity/function in regulating diverse cellular processes. However, the primary amino acid sequence of the CaM-binding domain in different CaM-binding proteins (CBPs) is not conserved. One way to identify most of the CBPs in the Arabidopsis genome is by protein-protein interaction-based screening of expression libraries with CaM. Here, using a mixture of radiolabeled CaM isoforms fromArabidopsis, we screened several expression libraries prepared from flower meristem, seedlings, or tissues treated with hormones, an elicitor, or a pathogen. Sequence analysis of 77 positive clones that interact with CaM in a Ca2+-dependent manner revealed 20 CBPs, including 14 previously unknown CBPs. In addition, by searching theArabidopsis genome sequence with the newly identified and known plant or animal CBPs, we identified a total of 27 CBPs. Among these, 16 CBPs are represented by families with 2–20 members in each family. Gene expression analysis revealed that CBPs and CBP paralogs are expressed differentially. Our data suggest thatArabidopsis has a large number of CBPs including several plant-specific ones. Although CaM is highly conserved between plants and animals, only a few CBPs are common to both plants and animals. Analysis of Arabidopsis CBPs revealed the presence of a variety of interesting domains.

Plant Sci. 2001; 160: 381-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). All these signals have been shown to elicit changes in cytosolic free Ca2+([Ca2+]cyt)1level (1Reddy A.S.N. Plant Sci. 2001; 160: 381-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 2Knight H. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2000; 195: 269-324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Trewavas A.J. Malho R. Curr. Opin.

Pessarakali M. Handbook of Plant and Crop Physiology. Marcel Dekker, New York2001: 697-733Google Scholar). In addition, several growth and developmental processes are also accompanied by changes in [Ca2+]cytlevels (6Hepler P.K. Trends Plant Sci. 1997; 2: 79-80Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 7Bibikova T.N. Zhigilei A. Gilroy S. Planta. 1997; 203: 495-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Transient changes in free [Ca2+]cyt levels control cellular processes through Ca2+ sensors. There are at least four major families of Ca2+ sensors in plants. These include (i) calmodulin (CaM) and its isoforms, which consist of 148 amino acids and four EF hands; (ii) CaM-like proteins, which differ from CaMs in their size and EF hands; (iii) Ca2+-dependent protein kinases; and (iv) other Ca2+-binding proteins without EF hands (1Reddy A.S.N. Plant Sci. 2001; 160: 381-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Ca2+-dependent protein kinases are found only in plants and protozoan, whereas CaM is ubiquitous in all eukaryotes (1Reddy A.S.N. Plant Sci. 2001; 160: 381-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 8Zielinski R.E. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 697-725Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Snedden W.A. Fromm H. New Phytol. 2001; 151: 35-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Calmodulin is an acidic heat stable protein with two globular domains, each carrying two EF hands (10Rhoads A.R. Friedberg F. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 331-340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CaM is the primary transducer of cytosolic Ca2+ changes in all eukaryotes. In most cases, the active form of CaM (Ca2+-bound CaM) regulates the activity/function of a wide range of CaM-binding proteins (CBPs) including metabolic enzymes, transcriptional factors, ion channels and pumps, and structural proteins (1Reddy A.S.N. Plant Sci. 2001; 160: 381-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 9Snedden W.A. Fromm H. New Phytol. 2001; 151: 35-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Therefore, CaM acts as a multifunctional protein in Ca2+-mediated signal transduction networks and regulates the activity of structurally and functionally unrelated proteins. Arabidopsis contains at least nine different CaM isoforms (AtCaMs) and several CaM-like proteins (8Zielinski R.E. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 697-725Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Snedden W.A. Fromm H. New Phytol. 2001; 151: 35-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 11The Arabidopsis Genome Initiative Nature. 2000; 408: 796-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (6393) Google Scholar). AtCaM1 to AtCaM7 differ in a few amino acids, whereas AtCaM8 and AtCaM9 are the most diverged (12Kohler C. Neuhaus G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 4710: 133-136Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Analysis of the recently completed Arabidopsis genome sequence, the first plant genome to be sequenced, revealed that there are 25,498 genes in this organism (11The Arabidopsis Genome Initiative Nature. 2000; 408: 796-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (6393) Google Scholar). The next challenge is to identify the function of many of the predicted proteins in theArabidopsis genome. The amino acid sequences from the predicted open reading frames are useful in many cases in obtaining insights into the function of the predicted proteins primarily through sequence similarities and functional motifs present in the predicted proteins. Database searches with the Arabidopsis predicted proteins indicate that 69% of the total proteins have sequence similarities with proteins of known function in other organisms, whereas the rest (31%) are unique and could not be assigned to any functional category (11The Arabidopsis Genome Initiative Nature. 2000; 408: 796-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (6393) Google Scholar). In cases where the predicted proteins do not show sequence similarities to known proteins, it is difficult to obtain insights into their function. The primary sequence of the CaM-binding domain (CBD) in different CBPs is not conserved (1Reddy A.S.N. Plant Sci. 2001; 160: 381-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Furthermore, from the few plant CBPs that have been characterized, it seems that plants contain several unique CBPs (1Reddy A.S.N. Plant Sci. 2001; 160: 381-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Several plant-CBPs have no homologs in non-plant systems. Hence, it is not possible to identify CaM target proteins based on computer-assisted sequence comparisons using CaM-binding sequences (10Rhoads A.R. Friedberg F. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 331-340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One way to identify these proteins is by functional interaction with CaM. So far, only a limited number of CBPs have been identified in plants (1Reddy A.S.N. Plant Sci. 2001; 160: 381-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). To identify most of the CBPs inArabidopsis, we used labeled Arabidopsis CaM isoforms to screen several expression libraries prepared from different plant parts and plants/tissues that are either treated with hormones or pathogen/elicitor. We sequenced isolated cDNAs and identified their corresponding genes in the Arabidopsis genome database. In addition, we searched the Arabidopsis genome sequence with other known animal and plant CBPs. We then analyzed CBPs for CBD, structural features, and gene organization and expression. Our analyses revealed that plants have a unique set of CBPs, and several CBPs have a large number of paralogs. Some CBPs are present in both plants and animals, whereas others are unique to plants or animals, suggesting functional similarity and divergence in Ca2+/CaM-mediated signal transduction networks between plants and animals. Gene expression analyses revealed that the members of a given CBP gene family are expressed differentially in different tissues. Domain analysis of the new Arabidopsis CBPs indicates that they possess putative domains that are implicated in a variety of cellular activities.

Red Kidney) expression libraries prepared in λZAP (EcoRI-XhoI or EcoRI site, Stratagene) or λZipLox (SalI-NotI) phage vectors were used in our screening. The expression libraries were prepared from the following tissues: (i) roots of 10-day-old seedlings treated with 10 μm α-naphthaleneacetic acid for a 24-h period (16Neuteboom L.W. Ng J.M.Y.

Meyerowitz; (v) pooled cell cultures (grown in the dark in modified MS medium treated with 50 μg/ml elicitor from Phytophthora megasperma sp.glycinea (18Korfhage U. Trezzini G.F. Meier I.

Approximately 800,000 recombinant phages of each library were screened with a mixture of 35S-CaM using XL1-blue MRA host strain (Stratagene). The plates were incubated at 42 °C until the plaques appeared, at which time the plates were overlaid with nitrocellulose membranes (0.45 μm, HATF, Millipore) presoaked in 10 mm IPTG to induce the fusion protein of recombinant phages. Plates were returned to 37 °C and incubated for 8 h. The plates were then cooled at 4 °C, and membranes were removed and incubated with either 35S-CaM or biotinylated CaM as described (15Safadi F. Reddy V.S. Reddy A.S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35457-35470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 20Reddy A.S.N. Safadi F. Narasimhulu S.B. Golovkin M. Hu X. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7052-7060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The putative positive recombinant phages were purified by two additional rounds of screening. During the third round of screening, each putative positive was tested for CaM binding in the presence and absence of Ca2+. The cDNA was excised in vivo in a plasmid form (λZAPII to pBluescript; λZipLox to pZL1). Double-stranded DNA from putative recombinant plasmids was prepared, and 5′ and 3′ ends of each clone were sequenced using T3 and T7 primers, respectively. The sequences obtained from these clones were used to searchArabidopsis TAIR (www.arabidopsis.org) and MIPS (mips.gsf.de/proj/thal/db/index.html) databases using BLASTN and BLASTX search programs. After determining the full-length sequence of a CBP as above, we used its DNA (spliced and unspliced) and protein sequences from the Arabidopsis database for various analyses as described below. Search for the identification of the T-DNA or transposable element insertion sequences in all 100 CBP genes (knockout mutants; E value <1 × 10−4) was performed at the Torrey Mesa Research Institute (www.tmri.org), the Salk Institute Genomic Analysis Laboratory (signal.salk.edu), and the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Center (nasc.nott.ac.uk), where a total of 108,500 sequences flanking the T-DNA or transposable element insertions were available as of December 3, 2001. Total RNA from leaf, stem, flower, and root tissues of Arabidopsis was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Fifty micrograms of total RNA was electrophoresed, transferred to Hybond Nylon membrane, and hybridized with 32P-labeled full-length cDNA using standard protocols. Searches for expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were performed at MIPS database. If an EST was found for a CBP, we considered the tissue or organ from which the cDNA library was constructed as positive for the expression of that particular gene. We also searched the literature for the expression pattern of already identified genes and summarized our findings in Tables I and II.Table IArabidopsis single gene-encoded CBPs isolated from expression libraries using labeled calmodulin or identified based on sequence similarity to characterized CBPsName of the protein1-aThe protein names shown in bold were isolated in our screening (clones 1, 2, and 5 are fromArabidopsis and 3 and 4 are Arabidopsis homologs of bean CBPs.

https://openalex.org/W2108814958,"In models of type 2 diabetes the expression of beta-cell genes is altered, but these changes have not fully explained the impairment in beta-cell function. We hypothesized that changes in beta-cell phenotype and global alterations in both carbohydrate and lipid pathways are likely to contribute to secretory abnormalities. Therefore, expression of genes involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism were analyzed in islets 4 weeks after 85-95% partial pancreatectomy (Px) when beta-cells have impaired glucose-induced insulin secretion and ATP synthesis. Px rats after 1 week developed mild to severe hyperglycemia that was stable for the next 3 weeks, whereas neither plasma triglyceride, non-esterified fatty acid, or islet triglyceride levels were altered. Expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), with several target genes, were reciprocally regulated; PPARalpha was markedly reduced even at low level hyperglycemia, whereas PPARgamma was progressively increased with increasing hyperglycemia. Uncoupling protein 2 (UCP-2) was increased as were other genes barely expressed in sham islets including lactate dehydrogenase-A (LDH-A), lactate (monocarboxylate) transporters, glucose-6-phosphatase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, 12-lipoxygenase, and cyclooxygenase 2. On the other hand, the expression of beta-cell-associated genes, insulin, and GLUT2 were decreased. Treating Px rats with phlorizin normalized hyperglycemia without effecting plasma fatty acids and reversed the changes in gene expression implicating the importance of hyperglycemia per se in the loss of beta-cell phenotype. In addition, parallel changes were observed in beta-cell-enriched tissue dissected by laser capture microdissection from the central core of islets. In conclusion, chronic hyperglycemia leads to a critical loss of beta-cell differentiation with altered expression of genes involved in multiple metabolic pathways diversionary to normal beta-cell glucose metabolism. This global maladaptation in gene expression at the time of increased secretory demand may contribute to the beta-cell dysfunction found in diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2075927503,"Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), a neuropeptide that acts through G protein-coupled receptors, exerts neuroprotective effects upon many neuronal populations. However, the intracellular signaling mechanisms that account for PACAP's trophic effects are not well characterized. Here we have tested the possibility that PACAP uses neurotrophin signaling pathways. We have found that PACAP treatment resulted in an increase in TrkA tyrosine kinase activity in PC12 cells and TrkB activity in hippocampal neurons. The activation of TrkA receptors by PACAP required at least 1 h of treatment and did not involve binding to nerve growth factor. Moreover, PACAP induced an increase in activated Akt through a Trk-dependent mechanism that resulted in increased cell survival after trophic factor withdrawal. The increases in Trk and Akt were blocked by K252a, an inhibitor of Trk receptor activity. In addition, transactivation of TrkA receptors by PACAP could be inhibited with PP1, an inhibitor of Src family kinases or BAPTA/AM, (1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N,N-tetraacetic acid acetoxymethyl ester), an intracellular calcium chelator. Therefore, PACAP can exert trophic effects through a mechanism involving Trk receptors and utilization of tyrosine kinase signaling. This ability may explain several neuroprotective actions of PACAP upon neuronal populations after injury, nerve lesion, or neurotrophin deprivation.

Each represents small families of proteins that are essential for the development of the vertebrate nervous system. The effects of these factors on cell survival, differentiation, and cell death events depend upon binding to transmembrane receptors and stimulation of downstream signaling cascades characterized by increased protein tyrosine phosphorylation. Neurotrophins utilize Trk receptor tyrosine kinases, and glial-derived neurotrophic factor family members signal through the c-Ret receptor tyrosine kinase, whereas CNTF utilizes JAK tyrosine kinase activity linked to the CNTF receptor complex (1Segal R. Greenberg M. Ann. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 463-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). It has become increasingly apparent that many other secreted proteins are also capable of providing neuroprotective or neurotrophic actions. The pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) belongs to a family of peptides, including secretin, glucagon, and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) (2Miyata A. Airmura A. Dahl R.

Although PACAP was originally isolated from the hypothalamus, it is distributed throughout the central nervous system, including the hippocampus, olfactory bulb, and cerebral cortex (4Ghatei M.

Two G protein-coupled receptors exist for PACAP. The type 1 PACAP receptor, PAC1, displays high specificity for PACAP (10Pisegna J. Wank S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6345-6349Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), whereas type II PACAP receptors, VPAC1 and VPAC2, recognize VIP as well as PACAP with equal affinities (11Ishihara T. Shigemoto R.

Brain Res. 1996; 741: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) or 6-hydroxydopamine treatment of dopaminergic neurons (22Takei N. Skoglosa Y. Lindholm D. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 54: 698-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) could be reversed with low concentrations of PACAP. These observations indicate that PACAP may be neuroprotective for neurons following axotomy, injury, or cytotoxic insults. The ability of PACAP to provide a neurotrophic effect upon populations of neurons that are dependent upon neurotrophins such as NGF and BDNF suggests that PACAP may also use similar signal transduction mechanisms. Indeed, PACAP increases the survival of sensory and sympathetic neurons to the same extent as NGF (26Przywara D. Kulkarni J. Wakade T. Leontiev D. Wakade A. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1889-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 27Lioudyno M. Skoglosa Y. Takei N. Lindholm D. J. Neurosci.

Here we have explored the possibility that PACAP induces neurotrophin signaling pathways that lead to trophic effects. Surprisingly, we find that the Trk tyrosine kinase receptor is activated as a result of PACAP treatment. The activation occurred in the absence of neurotrophin binding and was observed in PC12 cells, as well as primary cultures of hippocampal neurons. The activation of Trk receptors by PACAP provides a mechanism to account for the neuroprotective effects by this neuropeptide. PACAP38, PACAP27, and VIP were purchased from Peninsula Laboratories (San Carlos, CA), PP1 was from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA), and K252a, A23187, MK-801, and BAPTA/AM were obtained from Calbiochem. NGF was obtained from Harlan Bioproducts (Indianapolis, IN) and BDNF from PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ). All other compounds were from Sigma Chemical Co. Anti-pan-Trk rabbit antiserum raised against the C-terminal region of the Trk receptor was from Barbara Hempstead (#45, Weill Medical College, New York, NY) and from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (B-3). Anti-NGF antibody was obtained from Chemicon. Anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-Akt antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-Shc antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology and Transduction Laboratories. Anti-phospho-Akt, anti-MAPK, anti-phospho-MAPK, and anti-phosphoTrk (674/675) antibodies were from New England BioLabs. PC12 (615) cells (31Hempstead B.L. Rabin S.J. Kaplan L. Reid S. Parada L.F. Kaplan D.R. Neuron. 1992; 9: 883-896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 5% horse serum, supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine plus 200 μg/ml G418. Cells were placed in serum-free media overnight before experiments. Cell lysates from PC12 (615) cells or hippocampal cells were incubated in lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40) for 4 h to overnight at 4 °C with anti-pan-Trk polyclonal antibody followed by incubation with protein A-Sepharose beads. Equivalent amounts of protein were analyzed for each condition. The beads were washed four times with lysis buffer, and the immune complexes were boiled in SDS-sample buffer and loaded on SDS-PAGE gels for immunoblot analysis. The immunoreactive protein bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Following the indicated treatments, PC12 (615) cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS and lysed in a buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 25 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Clarified lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-pan-Trk antibodies for 2 h and then incubated with protein G-agarose for 1 h. The beads were washed twice with lysis buffer, once with a high salt buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, plus 750 mm NaCl), and twice with wash buffer (10 mmTris, pH 7.5, plus 10 mm MnCl2). Immunoprecipitates were then incubated with kinase assay solution containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mmMnCl2, 5 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 1 μg of GST-TrkA(JM) protein for 20 min at room temperature. Production of recombinant GST-TrkA(JM), a fusion protein containing 75 amino acids of the rat TrkA juxtamembrane region (aa 448–552), has been previously described (32Yano H. Lee F.S. Kong H. Chuang J.-Z. Arevalo J.C. Perez P. Sung C.-H. Chao M.V. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: RC125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Kinase reactions were terminated by adding Laemmli buffer followed by boiling. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (10%) and then transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore). Phosphorylation of GST-TrkA(JM) and immunoprecipitated TrkA was analyzed by PhosphorImager analysis, and the amount of TrkA protein in the same sample was visualized by immunoblotting with anti-panTrk antibodies. Both the extent of phosphorylation and the amount of Trk protein were quantified by densitometric analysis with ImageQuaNT. Intensity of the bands was quantified relative to the untreated samples. For equilibrium binding studies, 125I-NGF was prepared as described previously (33Hempstead B.L. Schleifer L. Chao M.V. Science. 1989; 243: 373-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). PC12 cells stably overexpressing TrkA (2 × 105 cells) and 3T3 cells expressing TrkA (2 × 105 cells) were incubated with 125I-NGF in the absence and presence of PACAP38 (1 μm) for 30 min at 25 °C. The cells were then washed twice with PBS, and125I-NGF was stripped with an acid solution (0.2m acetic acid, 0.5 m NaCl). Nonspecific binding was assessed by adding unlabeled NGF at a final concentration of 1000 ng/ml and represented <20% of total binding. Specific binding was defined as total binding minus nonspecific binding. All conditions were carried out in triplicate, and the S.E. was calculated. Dissociated primary cultures of hippocampal neurons from embryonic day 18 (E18) rats were prepared from timed-pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats as described previously (34Aibel L. Martin-Zanca D. Perez P. Chao M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 54: 424-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Fetuses were removed under sterile conditions and kept in PBS on ice for microscopic dissection of the hippocampus. The meninges were removed, and the tissue was placed in Neurobasal media (Invitrogen). The tissue was briefly minced with fine forceps and then triturated with a fire-polished Pasteur pipette. Cells were counted and plated on culture wells coated with 0.01 mg/ml poly-d-lysine overnight in Neurobasal media containing B27 supplement andl-glutamine (0.5 mm). Experiments were conducted 7–10 days after plating. Prior to treatment, cells were placed in serum-free media for 5 h. MK-801 (1 mm) was added to the serum-free media to decrease the contribution ofN-methyl-d-aspartate-mediated cell death. Hippocampal neurons were maintained in Neurobasal media containing B27 supplement and 0.5 mml-glutamine for 10 days. B27 was then removed, and PACAP38 (10–100 nm) or BDNF (100 ng/ml) or IGF-1 (100 ng/ml) was added to the media. MK-801 (1 μm) was added to all conditions to decrease the contribution ofN-methyl-d-aspartate-mediated cell death. After 48 h, cell death was assessed by measuring lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) released from injured cells into the media by using the Cytox 96 cytotoxicity assay kit (Promega). LDH values were normalized by subtracting the LDH released by cells maintained in BDNF (100 ng/ml) and scaled to complete killing (=100%) reference induced with treatment with 30 μmA23187 for 24 h, a condition that resulted in cell death of all cells (35Kim A. Sheline C. Tian M. Higashi T. McMahon R. Cousins R. Choi D. Brain Res. 2000; 886: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). PACAP is produced in two forms, a predominant 38-amino acid (PACAP38) and a 27-amino acid species (PACAP27). These two forms of PACAP are equally effective in elevating cAMP levels in PC12 cells (36Deutsch P. Sun Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5108-5113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These effects are mediated by PAC1 receptors expressed on PC12 cells. To test whether PACAP exerts any downstream signaling effects through tyrosine phosphorylation, we evaluated the activity of TrkA receptors. After treatment with PACAP, TrkA receptors were immunoprecipitated from PC12 cell lysates and then probed with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Activated TrkA receptors of 110 and 140 kDa were observed with both PACAP38 and PACAP27 treatment of PC12 cells (Fig. 1). Both PACAP forms increased tyrosine-phosphorylated TrkA receptors at similar nanomolar concentrations, in contrast with treatment with VIP, which required much higher (micromolar) concentrations. VIP typically displays 1000-fold lower affinity for PAC1 receptors (37Tatsuno I. Gottschall P. Koves K. Arimura A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 168: 1027-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In addition, VPAC1 and VPAC2 receptors typically bind both PACAP and VIP with similar affinities (38Shrivers B. Gorcs T. Gottschall P. Arimura A. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 3055-3065Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 39Tatsuno I. Gottschall P. Arimura A. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 728-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The differential dose response by PACAP and VIP in PC12 cells is consistent with the action of PAC1 receptors in mediating the effects of PACAP upon TrkA receptor activity. A time course of PACAP action indicated that the increase in TrkA activation was slow and required at least 90 min (Fig.2), which is considerably delayed compared with NGF treatment. The activation of TrkA receptors could be inhibited by 100 nm K252a, a well-established inhibitor of Trk tyrosine kinases. This concentration of K252a blocks NGF activation of TrkA receptors and the subsequent biological effects of neurotrophins, without affecting other receptor tyrosine kinases, such as the EGF and fibroblast growth factor (40Berg M.M. Sternberg D. Parada L.F. Chao M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, PACAP did not stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of EGF receptors in these cells at either short (10 min) or longer time points (2–3 h), nor did it transactivate c-Ret receptors in Neuro2a-20 cells (data not shown). To confirm that tyrosine phosphorylation of Trk receptors reflects stimulation of Trk tyrosine kinase activity, an in vitrokinase assay with immunopurified TrkA from PC12 cells was performed. PACAP was able to stimulate TrkA kinase activity by 2-fold as measured by receptor autophosphorylation (Fig.3 A). A similar increase was observed in the phosphorylation of a GST fusion protein, GST-TrkA(JM), containing the juxtamembrane region of the TrkA receptor. This substrate contains the NPQY sequence, which becomes phosphorylated upon receptor activation and serves as the docking site for the Shc adaptor protein. In addition, PACAP was shown specifically to lead to phosphorylation of the activation loop tyrosine residues of the TrkA kinase domain as determined with phospho-Trk (674/675) site-specific antibody (Fig. 3 B). These results suggest that PACAP increases Trk tyrosine kinase activity, rather than simply increasing tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor. The effects of PACAP might be explained by a direct interaction of PACAP with the Trk receptors. However, binding experiments indicate that PACAP does not compete with NGF for binding to the TrkA receptor. No displacement of 125I-NGF binding was observed when an excess of PACAP38 was added to PC12 cells overexpressing TrkA (TableI). Because PC12 cells express the p75 neurotrophin receptor, which also binds NGF, similar experiments were conducted in 3T3 cells expressing only TrkA receptors. Excess concentrations of PACAP38 did not displace 125I-NGF binding to 3T3 cells expressing only TrkA (Table I).Table ILack of effect of PACAP38 on 125I NGF bindingConditionSpecific bindingPC12Control41130 ± 377PACAP38 (1 μm)43047 ± 5543T3/TrkAControl72536 ± 1777PACAP38 (1 μm)73837 ± 1502Equilibrium 125I NGF binding was assessed as described under “Experimental Procedures” in PC12 cells and 3T3 cells overexpressing TrkA in the absence and presence of PACAP38. Open table in a new tab Equilibrium 125I NGF binding was assessed as described under “Experimental Procedures” in PC12 cells and 3T3 cells overexpressing TrkA in the absence and presence of PACAP38. It is also possible that PACAP treatment leads to the production of NGF by PC12 cells that could act in an autocrine fashion to stimulate TrkA receptors. This possibility was discounted by a lack of effect of anti-NGF antibody (1 μg/ml) on PACAP38's activation of TrkA (Fig.4). On the other hand, the same concentration of anti-NGF antibody was effective in blocking the effects of NGF added exogenously to PC12 cells. Taken together with the dose responses with PACAP seen above, these results are consistent with the involvement of PAC1 receptors in mediating the increase in Trk receptor activity. An immediate downstream consequence of Trk receptor activation is phosphorylation of the adaptor protein, Shc. PACAP treatment of PC12 cells leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc in a time-dependent manner that resembles the delayed time course needed for Trk receptor activation (Fig.5 A). This event was slower than the response seen with a 10-min treatment with NGF. After activation of PACAP, type I receptors gives rise to rapid increases in MAPK activity in PC12 cells (41Barrie A. Clohessy A. Buensuceso C. Rogers M. Allen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19666-19671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and in cerebellar granular cells (42Villalba M. Bockaert J. Journot L. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 83-90Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with these previous studies, PACAP38 activated MAPK in PC12 cells within 10 min, as assayed with a phospho-MAPK antibody (Fig. 5 B). However, PD98059, an established MEK inhibitor, did not affect Trk receptor activation (data not shown). After 10 min of treatment, MAPK activity remained sustained for several hours. The prolonged activation of MAPK activity by PACAP is reminiscent of the effects of NGF upon Ras and MAPK activities (43Qiu M.-S. Green S.H. Neuron. 1992; 9: 705-717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar,44Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1850) Google Scholar). The persistent activation of MAPK also corresponds to the time course of Trk autophosphorylation seen above with PACAP. Interestingly, in contrast to Trk activity, MAPK activity was only partially inhibited by K252a. Thus, activation of MAPKs can be achieved either through PAC1 receptor signaling or through Trk receptor activation. Another pathway influenced by receptor tyrosine kinases is phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt. The activity of Akt is widely accepted as a signaling mechanism for neuronal cell survival (45Brunet A. Datta S. Greenberg M. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). In PC12 cells, PACAP38 was able to activate Akt as detected by a phospho-specific antibody. The time course of Akt activation was very similar to TrkA autophosphorylation induced by PACAP in that phosphorylated Akt was observed well after an hour of treatment. In contrast, NGF gave a robust increase of activated Akt after 10 min, which was not observed with 10 min of PACAP38 treatment. The increase in Akt activity was eliminated by pretreatment with 100 nmK252a (Fig. 5 B). These results indicate that PACAP's activation of Akt by PACAP is Trk-dependent. This response has not been previously associated with PACAP action and provides an explanation for the neuroprotective effects of PACAP. The mechanisms by which G protein-coupled receptors are linked to the activation of receptor tyrosine kinases are incompletely understood. Previously, we found that adenosine binding to the A2A adenosine receptor in PC12 cells also gave rise to TrkA activation (46Lee F. Chao M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 92: 3555-3560Crossref Scopus (417) Google Scholar). One activity that may mediate G protein-coupled activation of mitogenic receptor tyrosine kinases are members of the Src family kinases (47Daub H. Wallash C. Lankenau A. Herrlich A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7032-7044Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar, 48Luttrell L. Daaka Y. Lefkowitz R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). To investigate whether an Src family member is involved in the activation of Trk receptors by PACAP, the inhibitor PP1 was used (49Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1784) Google Scholar). Treatment of PC12 cells with 1 μm PP1 resulted in a marked decrease in the level of tyrosine-phosphorylated TrkA elicited by PACAP (Fig.6). Increasing concentrations of PP1 produced a progressively stronger inhibition of PACAP, without affecting NGF-induced TrkA phosphorylation. These results suggest that the regulation of TrkA activity by PACAP may be mediated by a Src family member. An early neuronal response attributable to PACAP action is a change in cytosolic-free calcium concentration. Using fura-2 as a calcium-sensitive fluorescent dye, primary cultures of hippocampal neurons responded with increased mobilization of intracellular calcium with doses of PACAP38 in the nanomolar range (50Tatsuno I. Yada T. Vigh S. Hidaka H. Arimura A. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To assess whether a calcium-dependent step is required for transactivation of Trk receptors by PACAP signaling, PC12 cells were treated with BAPTA/AM, an intracellular calcium chelator. Treatment of PC12 cells with 20 μm BAPTA/AM led to a complete inhibition of transactivation of Trk receptors by PACAP38 (Fig.7). In contrast, an extracellular calcium chelator, EGTA, as well as a general chelator, EDTA, had no effect upon TrkA tyrosine kinase activity. All three chelators did not affect NGF phosphorylation of TrkA receptors (data not shown). These results suggest that transactivation of Trk receptors requires an intracellular calcium-dependent step, in addition to intracellular tyrosine phosphorylation events. The distinctive increases of Trk receptor kinase and Akt activities in PC12 cells suggest that neurotrophic effects of PACAP may be explained by transactivation events. To determine if this mechanism occurs in primary neurons, we established hippocampal neuronal cultures from E18 rat embryos, a well-defined neuronal cell model. Hippocampal neurons express the TrkB receptor and respond to BDNF,"

There was an increase in intra- and extracellular H2O2, lipid peroxidation, and collagen type I protein in stellate cells co-cultured with E47 cells compared with stellate cells alone or co-cultured with C34 cells.

Hepatology. 1996; 23: 1468-1475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In exploring the role of oxidative stress, it can be difficult to discriminate between the indirect effect of necrosis on stimulating fibrosis and a direct fibrogenic effect of free radical species. However, it is increasingly clear that in addition to an effect of necrosis, there is a direct stimulation of extracellular matrix deposition during the prenecrotic stage of liver injury (8Svegliati-Baroni G. D'Ambrosio L. Ferreti G. Di Casini A. Sario A. Salzano R. Ridolfi F. Saccomanno S. Jezequel A.M. Benedetti A. Hepatology. 1998; 27: 720-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The mechanisms underlying the fibrogenic effects of oxidative stress are not clarified. In particular, does oxidative stress provoke release of fibrogenic mediators by hepatocytes, directly stimulate fibrogenesis, or both? Hepatic stellate cells (HSC)1are the primary fibrogenic cell type in liver (9Friedman S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2247-2250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1867) Google Scholar).

Hepatol. 1996; 25: 74Google Scholar). In fact, when iron overload is localized only in reticuloendothelial cells, no activation of collagen gene expression can be detected (2Gualdi R. Casalgrandi G.

These findings suggest that the Na+/H+ exchanger could represent a common mediator of the different effects induced by oxidative stress on HSC such as proliferation and increased collagen type I. These data further suggest that paracrine signals from hepatocytes may stimulate HSC proliferation and collagen synthesisin vivo. Cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) has assumed an important role in alcohol-induced oxidative stress and liver injury. In the intragastric model of ethanol feeding, there is prominent induction of CYP2E1, a large increase in lipid peroxidation, and significant alcoholic liver injury in rats fed diets containing polyunsaturated fatty acids but not saturated fatty acids (6Castillo T.

In vivo, however, most CYP2E1 in the liver is localized in the hepatocyte, and there is little information about potential paracrine stimulation by hepatocyte-derived ROS of HSC fibrogenesis, eitherin vivo or in culture. The aim of this study was to develop a co-culture model in order to evaluate how CYP2E1-dependent generation of ROS impacts activation of HSC, their antioxidant defense system, and extracellular matrix production. The model is based on the co-incubation of the previously established HepG2 cell lines, which do (E47 cells) or do not (C34 cells) express the human CYP2E1 (17Chen Q. Cederbaum A.I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 638-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 18Wu D. Cederbaum A.I. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 795-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), with an immortalized rat HSC line. Some experiments were carried out using primary hepatocytes from either control or pyrazole-treated rats, in which there is an increase in CYP2E1 expression, co-cultured with freshly isolated HSC. These co-culture systems would more closely resemble the in vivo situation, where cell-to-cell communication may play a critical role in provoking fibrosis. Most reagents, unless specified, were from Sigma. 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate and cis-parinaric acid were from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). The model used in most of the experiments described below is based on the co-culture of HepG2 cell lines that either do (E47 cells) or do not (C34 cells) express the human CYP2E1 (17Chen Q. Cederbaum A.I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 638-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 18Wu D. Cederbaum A.I. Mol.

The T6-HSC contain intracellular filaments typical of primary HSC, express desmin, α-smooth muscle actin, vimentin and glial fibrillary acidic protein, take up and esterify retinol and retinol-binding protein, and are otherwise similar to primary stellate cells (19Kim Y.

Catalytic activity of CYP2E1 in the E47 cells was monitored by the oxidation of p-nitrophenol top-nitrocatechol prior to each experiment (21Reinke L.A. Moyer M.J. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1985; 13: 548-552PubMed Google Scholar). To extend the results with the above cell lines to normal hepatic tissue, selected experiments were carried out using freshly isolated rat HSC co-cultured with rat hepatocytes. Hepatocytes were isolated from saline-treated or pyrazole-treated rats (200 mg/kg of body weight/day for 2 days, followed by an overnight fast) as described by Wu and Cedarbaum (22Wu D. Cederbaum A.I. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1993; 264: 1468-1473PubMed Google Scholar). Pyrazole was used to elevate the level of CYP2E1 in the hepatocytes, whose content and activity was measured at the beginning and at the end of the experiments. Primary HSC were isolated from male Sprague-Dawley rats (600 ± 25 g) (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) by in situ liver perfusion with bacterial pronase and collagenase followed by density gradient centrifugation with Nycodenz according to published protocols (23Nieto N. Dominguez-Rosales J.A. Fontana L. Salazar A. Armendariz-Borunda J. Greenwel P. Rojkind M. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 597-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Cell viability (95%) was assessed by the trypan blue exclusion method. Purity of the HSC (97%) was determined as described previously (23Nieto N. Dominguez-Rosales J.A. Fontana L. Salazar A. Armendariz-Borunda J. Greenwel P. Rojkind M. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 597-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Cells were co-cultured using cell culture inserts (3-μm pore size) to separate both cell populations; the HSC are plated on the bottom, and the HepG2 cells or hepatocytes are plated on the insert to create a gravity gradient of the released mediators. A ratio of HepG2 (or hepatocytes)/HSC of 5:1 was chosen, since it is representative of the ratio of parenchymal/nonparenchymal cells in liver (24Fontana L. Jerez D. Rojas-Valencia L. Solis-Herruzo J.A. Greenwel P. Rojkind M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1362: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). After overnight incubation of HSC alone in MEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and essential amino acids, the HSC medium was discarded, the cell culture inserts containing the overnight incubated C34 or E47 cells were transferred, and the medium from the C34 or E47 cells was added to the co-culture systems. At this time, all additions were made (t = 0 h). In experiments using hepatocytes, they were directly plated on top of the freshly isolated HSC. For experiments in which conditioned medium was used, C34 or E47 cells were grown in flasks until 90% confluence without replacing the medium, typically 5 days; the medium was collected, centrifuged, and filtered through a 0.2-μm syringe filter before it was added to the HSC. Plasmid DNA preparation as well as transfection procedures, Northern and Western blot analysis, intracellular production of ROS (including H2O2using dichlorodihydrofluorescein and intracellular lipid peroxidation products using cis-parinaric acid), the activities of antioxidant enzymes, GSH levels, and cell viability assays are described in previous publications (15Nieto N.

H2O2 concentration as well as lipid peroxidation products in the culture medium without phenol red were assayed by the FOX method (25Deiana L. Carru C. Pes G. Tadolini B. Free Radic. Res. 1999; 31: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and by the TBARS assay (26Fraga C.G. Leibovitz B.E. Tappel A.L. Free Radic. Biol.

Scott Friedman (Mount Sinai School of Medicine), Detlef Schuppan (Universität Erlangen-Murnberg), and Marcos Rojkind (Albert Einstein College of Medicine), respectively), and a S14 ribosomal protein cDNA clone purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Quantitative comparison of the intensity of the signal scanned in a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) was performed using the ImageQuant software. Western blots were done on cell lysates or with 10-fold concentrated incubation media passed through centricon columns (molecular mass cut-off of 50 kDa) using antibodies raised against collagen type I (1:5000; provided by Dr. Detlef Schuppan, Universität Erlangen-Murnberg), MMP-13 (1:1000; provided by Dr. John Jeffrey (Albany Medical School)), TIMP-1 (1:1000; Chemicon), CYP2E1 (1:30.000; provided by Dr. Jerome Lasker (Mount Sinai School of Medicine)), and catalase (1:2000; Calbiochem). Goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was used as second antibody (1:5000; Chemicon). HSC and HepG2 control (C34) or CYP2E1-expressing cells (E47) were plated separately in 10% fetal bovine serum-MEM; after overnight incubation, the medium from the HSC was removed, and the inserts containing the C34 or E47 cells together with their culture medium were transferred onto the plates containing the HSC; fresh medium was also added to the HSC that were plated with an empty insert as a reference group (not to be co-cultured with HepG2 cells). 22 h later, the media from the complete co-culture systems were replaced with methionine-cysteine-free MEM plus 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, and the cells were incubated for 2 h, after which they were pulse-labeled with 150 μCi of EasyTagTM EXPRE35S35S Protein Labeling Mix (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 h to study the rate of collagen synthesis. A set of samples was pulsed for 2 h in the presence of 40 μm cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, as a control for the analysis of collagen synthesis. Following the pulse, the cells were washed in 1× phosphate-buffered saline and lysed at the indicated time points with 150 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% SDS, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. To study the rate of collagen degradation, the co-cultures were treated as above but pulse-labeled with the EXPRE35S35S mix for 24 h. The cells were then washed three times and chased with complete MEM supplemented with 300 μg/ml of cold methionine. Cells were washed in 1× phosphate-buffered saline and lysed at chase times of 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 h in the same lysis buffer. In all cases, collagen I was immunoprecipitated with anti-rat-collagen I IgG-protein G-agarose as follows: 40 μl of cell lysate were first incubated with 10 μl of preimmune rabbit serum for 15 min, followed by the addition of 30 μl of a 50% (v/v) suspension of protein G-agarose. After centrifugation for 2 min at 13,000 rpm, the supernatant was incubated with anti-rat collagen I IgG rocking overnight at 4 °C followed by the addition of 30 μl of a suspension of protein G-agarose. Samples were centrifuged for 1 min at 13,000 rpm, and the pellets were washed three times with lysis buffer, once with lysis buffer plus 2% SDS, and three times with 0.1m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 6.8. Collagen I was eluted by boiling for 5 min in Laemmli's buffer, and samples were centrifuged for 2 min at 13,000 rpm to remove the protein G-agarose, resolved on a 5% SDS-PAGE, and dried. The intensity of the radioactive signal was quantified using the PhosphorImager and the ImageQuant software. To evaluate the rate of total protein synthesis by HSC, cells were treated as above and pulsed for 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 h, followed by the addition of 30% trichloroacetic acid to stop the reaction. The cells were washed in 1× phosphate-buffered saline, and the trichloroacetic acid-precipitable counts were determined in a scintillation counter after resuspension of the pellets in scintillation liquid. To evaluate the rate of HSC total protein degradation, the co-cultures were pulse-labeled for 24 h as above, followed by chasing for 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 h. The HSC were treated with 30% trichloroacetic acid and washed, and the trichloroacetic acid-precipitated counts were determined as described above. Results represent mean ± S.E. and are average values from three experiments that were repeated at least twice. Comparisons among groups were made using Student's ttest. With the exception of results in Fig. 10, which utilized freshly isolated rat HSC, the T6-HSC line was used in all other experiments. The designation HSC refers to data found in the HSC incubated with an empty insert; HSC/C34 refers to results obtained in the HSC after co-culture with the C34 cells, and HSC/E47 refers to results obtained in the HSC after co-culture with the E47 cells. Similarly, the designations HSC/C34 and HSC/E47 refer to data obtained in the C34 and E47 cells after co-culture with the HSC, whileC34 and E47 refer to results for the C34 and E47 cells incubated alone. Indirect evidence suggests a paracrine mechanism by which hepatocytes stimulate HSC proliferation and collagen synthesis in vivo (3Pietrangelo A. Gualdi R. Casalgrandi G. De Geerts A. Blesser P. Montosi G. Ventura E. Hepatology. 1994; 19: 714-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 10Houglum K. Filip M. Witztum J.L. Chojkier M. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 1991-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). HepG2 cells, which do (E47 cells) or do not (C34 cells) overexpress CYP2E1, were incubated in the presence of HSC using a dual chamber apparatus that separates the cell types but allows for rapid exchange of soluble mediators (Fig. 1). Cells were plated at a ratio of HepG2 cells (or hepatocytes)/HSC of 5:1 (24Fontana L. Jerez D. Rojas-Valencia L. Solis-Herruzo J.A. Greenwel P. Rojkind M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1362: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). HSC were cultured alone for 16 h, after which the medium was discarded; then the cell culture inserts containing either HepG2 cells or hepatocytes (or no cells) were transferred together with the culture medium to the plates containing the HSC; this defined the beginning of the co-culture period (t = 0 h). Samples of either cell lysate from HSC or culture medium were then collected at different time points. Preliminary experiments were performed mixing both cell types directly to determine if cell-cell contact was necessary to stimulate collagen production; effects were identical to those described below for the dual chamber model. Therefore, the latter system was used exclusively, because the experiments allowed 1) determination of whether ROS diffuse and enter stellate cells, 2) examination of the antioxidant defense of the HSC, and 3) assessment of rates of total protein synthesis and degradation. This approach was essential to collect RNA and cell extracts only from the stellate cells and avoid a dilution error due to small differences in cell growth of any of the cell populations. The antioxidant status of the HSC alone and following co-culture with either C34 or E47 cells (HSC, HSC/C34, and HSC/E47, respectively) was characterized in order to evaluate whether the effect of CYP2E1-derived oxidative stress on HSC activation is amplified by impaired antioxidant defense. The levels of antioxidants in the HSC were considerably lower than those in HepG2 cells. Incubation of HSC with either C34 or E47 cells did not affect their activity of glutathione transferase, glutathione reductase, GPX, SOD, catalase, or GSH levels (Table I). Thus, no significant changes in the antioxidant defense were observed in the co-cultured HSC. The basal expression of glutathione transferase, glutathione reductase, catalase, and GSH but not GPX or SOD increased in the E47 cells when compared with theC34 cells (p < 0.01) as previously described (28Mari M. Cederbaum A.I. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 652-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), suggesting that HepG2 cells up-regulate antioxidant defense in response to CYP2E1 production of ROS via increased metabolism of H2O2 and elevated GSH levels.Table IAntioxidant defense in the co-culture modelsCell modelActivityGTGRGPXCATSODGSHunits/mg proteinHSC57.7 ± 2.27.8 ± 1.915.3 ± 0.50.9 ± 0.13.8 ± 0.18.2 ± 0.8HSC/C3441.7 ± 4.28.9 ± 0.612.3 ± 1.90.7 ± 0.22.4 ± 0.18.7 ± 0.5HSC/E4743.6 ± 3.33.9 ± 0.316.9 ± 0.61.0 ± 0.13.1 ± 0.47.3 ± 0.3C3443.8 ± 361.0 ± 0.723.2 ± 0.310.5 ± 0.511.4 ± 0.226.4 ± 0.2E4798.9 ± 2.6***93.0 ± 0.3***25.6 ± 1.441.3 ± 2.1***13.3 ± 0.456.5 ± 3.0***The activities of glutathione transferase (GT), glutathione reductase (GR), GPX, CAT, and SOD, and GSH levels were measured in the HSC alone or co-cultured with C34 or E47 cells for 24 h as well as in C34 and E47 cells cultured alone.

Results are expressed in units/mg of protein for the enzymes and in nmol/mg of protein for GSH and reflect mean ± S.E. (n = 3). ***, p < 0.001 compared with C34 cells. Since ROS such as H2O2 could mediate the effects of CYP2E1 on HSC, the intracellular concentration of ROS species such as H2O2 in each cellular component of the co-cultures was measured. Co-incubation of E47 cells with HSC increased DCF fluorescence in the HSC by 35% (p < 0.01) as compared with HSC incubated alone or co-cultured with the C34 cells (Fig. 2 A). There was a 3-fold increase in ROS levels in the E47 cells when compared with the C34 cells (p < 0.01) (Fig. 2 A), validating the ability of CYP2E1 to actively catalyze ROS production even in the presence of an enhanced antioxidant defense. This increase in ROS by E47 cells was not altered by co-culture with the HSC (compareE47 and HSC/E47). To determine whether there is a gradient/efflux of H2O2 from the E47 to the HSC that could explain the increase in HSC intracellular H2O2 in the HSC/E47 co-culture, we measured H2O2 concentration in the incubation medium and found a 40% increase in the HSC/E47 co-culture as compared with HSC incubated alone or HSC co-cultured with C34 cells (p < 0.01) (Fig. 2 B). To confirm that effects were due to H2O2, 5 μm commercial H2O2 was added as a positive control. The addition of catalase to the incubation medium or transfecting with catalase (pZeo-CAT) lowered the levels of endogenous H2O2 or exogenous added H2O2. Note that since the E47 cells have higher activity of catalase, glutathione transferase, and GSH than the C34 cells (28Mari M. Cederbaum A.I. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 652-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), the addition of commercial H2O2 to the HSC/E47 co-culture resulted in greater metabolism of the added H2O2. These data suggest that some of the elevated H2O2 generated by the E47 cells increases the intracellular concentration of H2O2 in the HSC following its diffusion. In addition to H2O2, lipid peroxidation-derived products are another possible mediator for the effects of CYP2E1 on HSC. Therefore, lipid peroxidation in each cell type within the co-cultures was measured using the cis-parinaric acid method (decreased fluorescence reflects increased lipid peroxidation). Increased peroxidation was observed in the HSC/E47 co-culture compared with HSC alone or co-cultured with C34 cells (p < 0.01, Fig.3 A). As expected, lipid peroxidation was increased in the E47 cells compared with the C34 cells, and this increase was not affected by co-culture with the HSC (E47 or HSC/E47 compared with C34or HSC/C34) (Fig. 3 A). Moreover, when lipid peroxidation-derived products in the incubation medium were measured, there was a 40% increase in TBARS in the HSC/E47 co-culture when compared with the HSC incubated alone or the HSC/C34 co-culture (p < 0.01) (Fig. 3 B). Cells were also incubated in the presence of 45 μm arachidonic acid as a positive control in the presence or absence of 25 μmvitamin E. Arachidonic acid increased TBARS production especially in the co-cultures containing the E47 cells, and vitamin E prevented this increase. These results suggest that both H2O2and lipid peroxidation products are increased in the HSC themselves and the incubation medium after co-culturing with CYP2E1-containing cells. We believe that the H2O2 and lipid peroxidation products are largely derived from the E47 cells, since the increase of these ROS was blocked by added catalase and vitamin E, analogous to the prevention of increased collagen type I protein (described below). However, the possibility that the E47-derived oxidative stress can elevate ROS by the HSC cells themselves cannot be ruled out, so that several possibilities contribute to the enhanced state of oxidative stress in the HSC/E47 co-culture. Incubation of HSC with conditioned medium from the C34 cells grown in flasks for 5 days had no effect on the levels of collagen type I protein or COL1A2 mRNA levels (data not shown). However, there was a 4-fold increase in collagen type I protein expression in the HSC co-cultured with the E47 cells. This increase in collagen I protein was not associated with a corresponding change in the COL1A2 mRNA levels (not shown). Thus, these initial experiments validated the concept that the CYP2E1-expressing HepG2 cells released mediators, which could promote increased collagen type I protein in HSC. To study this further, subsequent experiments utilized the co-culture model. HSC were co-cultured with either the C34 or E47 cells in the presence or absence of 0.1 mml-buthionine sulfoximine, an irreversible inhibitor of γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase, which depletes GSH levels. HSC lysates, and aliquots of the incubation medium were collected at 3, 6, 12, and 24 h and analyzed by Western blot for collagen I. A time-dependent increase in collagen production was observed, which was more pronounced at 12 and 24 h in the E47 co-culture than in the C34 co-culture (data not shown). This effect was slightly increased by treatment withl-buthio"

Recent evidence confirms the notion thatoccludin, a four-pass integral plasma-membrane protein, is a functional component of the paracellular barrier. The overall hydrophilicity of occludin predicts two extracellular loops bounded by NH2- and COOH-terminal cytoplasmic domains. To date, the binding of the COOH terminus of occludin to intracellular proteins is well documented, but information concerning the function of the cytoplasmic NH2 terminus is still lacking. Using yeast two-hybrid screening we have identified a novel interaction between occludin and the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase Itch, a member of the HECT domain-containing ubiquitin-protein ligases. We have found that the NH2-terminal portion of occludin binds specifically to a multidomain of Itch, consisting of four WW motifs. This interaction has been confirmed by our results from in vivoand in vitro co-immunoprecipitation experiments. In addition, we provide evidence that Itch is specifically involved in the ubiquitination of occludin in vivo, and that the degradation of occludin is sensitive to proteasome inhibition.

Characteristically, TJs are located at the interphase between the apical and basolateral membranes where they act as a “molecular fence” to prevent intermixing of apical and basolateral membrane components. In addition, TJs function as semipermeable barriers restricting the paracellular diffusion of solutes and molecules between epithelial and endothelial cells. It is now known that TJs do not form an absolute seal, but instead contain discrete pores to permit a selective paracellular diffusion. Although it is still unclear how the restrictive or permissive action of the junctional pores is modulated, there is a general consensus that the transmembrane components of the TJ are critically involved in this process. Occludin is a 65-kDa integral plasma-membrane protein located specifically at tight junctions (9Furuse M. Hirase T. Itoh M. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. J.

It came as a surprise that occludin-deficient mouse embryos were viable and, moreover, did not show any gross morphological alterations of TJs (14Saitou M. Furuse M. Sasaki H. Schulzke J.D. Fromm M. Takano H. Noda T. Tsukita S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4131-4142Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). Similarly, TJs of embryoid bodies originating from occludin-deficient ES cells were morphologically indistinguishable from their wild-type counterparts (15Saitou M. Fujimoto K. Doi Y. Itoh M. Fujimoto T. Furuse M. Takamo H. Noda T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 397-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). These findings not only led to the discovery of an additional family of occludin-unrelated TJ-specific transmembrane proteins (16Tsukita S. Furuse M. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 268-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar), but also to the notion that occludin is obviously not an indispensable structural component of TJs. Instead it seems to fulfill a complex modulatory action on epithelial barrier properties, the molecular basis of which is still elusive. While the COOH-terminal attachment of occludin to intracellular proteins is well documented, information concerning protein-protein interaction at the cytoplasmic NH2 terminus is still lacking. Observations reported recently indicated that expression of an NH2-terminal modified occludin led to the up-regulation of neutrophil migration across stably transfected epithelial monolayers (17Huber D. Balda M.S. Matter K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5773-5778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This first clue toward a functional significance of the NH2-terminal domain of occludin initiated the quest for potential proteins binding to this region. Using yeast two-hybrid screening we have identified a novel interaction between the NH2 terminus of occludin and the WW domains of the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase Itch, a protein required for the ubiquitin-dependent endocytosis of plasma-membrane proteins (18Perry W.L. Hustad C.M. Swing D.A. O′Sullivan T.N. Jenkings N.A. Copeland N.G. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 143-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The specificity of this interaction has been verified by invitro and in vivo co-immunoprecipitation experiments. We have further shown that occludin is specifically ubiquitinated in vivo and in vitro and its turnover is sensitive to inhibition of the proteasome pathway. LLC-PK1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. HEK 293 cells were kept in MEM with 10% horse serum. MDCK cells were cultured in MEM enriched with 10% fetal calf serum. For transfection experiments cells were grown to 70–80% confluence and transfected with EffecteneTMtransfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For immunofluorescence, cells were grown on coverslips, washed in PBS−, and fixed with ethanol/acetic acid (95:5) for 20 min at −20 °C. Immunolabeling was done according to standard procedures. Fluorescent images were taken using a Zeiss AxioplanTMmicroscope and the Zeiss AxioVision Imaging SystemTM. pGBKT7-N-Occl was generated by subcloning the coding sequence of the entire NH2 terminus of mouse occludin (aa 1–67; GenBankTM accession numberU49185) in-frame with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain into theNdeI/SalI sites of the yeast two-hybrid vector pGBKT7 (CLONTECH). PCR primers were: 5′-ctgcatatgtccgtgaggccttttgaaa-3′ and 5′-aggtcgacggatccggatcacccctgg-3′, flanked by NdeI andSalI sites. For cloning ofpCRTM2.1-TOPOTM-Itcha full-length cDNA encoding mouse Itch (GenBankTMaccession number NM_008395) was amplified from a cDNA template derived from mouse liver RNA. Primers for the PCR reaction were: 5′-cgtcgacccatgggtagtctgaccatga-3′ and 5′-gtggatccactcttgtccaaatccttcagtttc-3 ′, flanked by SalI and BamHI sites. The amplified product was cloned into the pCRTM2.1-TOPOTM vector as recommended by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Myc-tagged Wt-Occl (aa 1–521),Occl-ΔN (aa 64–521),Occl-ΔN1/2 (aa 28–521), Occl-mut(aa 1–521, NH2-terminal mutated), and Claudin-1 were generated using the pcDNA3.1(−)/Myc-His/LacZ expression vector (Invitrogen). The putative WW recognition motif Pro9-Pro10-Tyr11-Pro12was mutated to Ala9-Ala9-Tyr11-Pro12by PCR primer modification. For Itch-EGFP the full-length cDNA coding for mouse Itch was subcloned into theXhoI-BamHI sites of pEGFP-N2 (CLONTECH). DNA fragments encoding the different WW domains of Itch were amplified by PCR from pCR 2.1-TOPOTM-Itch and were subcloned into theNdeI/SmaI sites of the AD-vector pGADT7.pGADT7-WW1 encodes aa 1–311, pGADT7-WW1/2 aa 1–366, pGADT7-WW3 aa 377–422, and pGADT7-WW3/4aa 377–460. A poly-HA-ubiquitin construct was kindly provided by M. Treier (22Treier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohman D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar), Itch-pEF neo was cloned as described previously (19Qiu L. Joazeiro C. Fang N. Wang H.Y. Elly C. Altman Y. Fang D. Hunter T. Liu Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35734-35737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Full-length human ZO-1 and canine ZO-2 were kindly provided by E. Wittchen. The MATCHMAKER GAL4 Two-Hybrid System 3 (CLONTECH) was used to identify new interaction partners for the NH2terminus of occludin. First, the Saccharomyces cerevisiaestrain AH109 was transformed with pGBKT7-N-Occl using a small scale lithium acetate/single-stranded carrier DNA/polyethylene glycol (LiAc/ss-DNA/PEG) transformation protocol (20Gietz R.D. Triggs-Raine B. Robbins A. Graham K.C. Woods R.A. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1997; 172: 67-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Selected transformants were transformed with a mouse liver MATCHMAKER cDNA library (in AD-vector pGAD10; CLONTECH) using a large scale LiAc/ss-DNA/PEG transformation protocol. Positive transformants were selected on SD/−Ade/−His/−Leu/−Trp + 5 mm3-aminotriazole selection media. All yeast clones were restreaked onto SD/−Trp/−Leu media and assayed for activity of β-galactosidase by a β-galactosidase plate assay (21Duttweiler H.M. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 340-341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). DNA was isolated from all lacZ positive clones and the AD-library plasmids were rescued inEscherichia coli strain DH5α. For further analysis, every isolated library plasmid was retransformed into the S. cerevisiae strain Y190 and additionally co-transformed with the following DNA-BD plasmids: pGBKT7-N-Occl, empty pGBKT7, and pGBKT7-LAM (CLONTECH; encodes human lamin C and provides a control for a fortuitous interaction). Transformation reactions were plated onto appropriate minimal synthetic dropout media, followed by a β-galactosidase plate assay. Furthermore, the library insert was transferred from the pGAD10-AD vector into the BamHI site of the pGBKT7-BD vector, and N-Occl (bait) was subcloned from the pGBKT7-BD vector into the NdeI/XhoI sites of the pGADT7-AD vector, followed by a two-hybrid assay in yeast strain Y190. Additionally, a frameshift mutation just upstream of the cDNA insert in the activation domain vector pGAD10 was created by digesting the plasmid with MluI, filling in the overhangs, and then religating the library plasmid. The frameshifted prey was then co-transformed with pGBKT7-N-Occl into yeast strain Y190 and transformants were assayed for β-galactosidase activity as described above. For domain mapping, the appropriate expression constructs (see constructs) were co-transformed into the yeast strain Y190 using a small scale LiAc/ss-DNA/PEG transformation protocol. Transformants were plated onto appropriate minimal synthetic dropout media and tested for β-galactosidase activity. A mouse monoclonal anti-c-Myc antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. Rabbit anti-occludin and anti-claudin-1 antibody was from Zymed Laboratories Inc. Alexa FluorTM 568 goat anti-rabbit IgG was used from Molecular Probes. A rabbit anti-Itch polyclonal antibody was generated as previously described (19Qiu L. Joazeiro C. Fang N. Wang H.Y. Elly C. Altman Y. Fang D. Hunter T. Liu Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35734-35737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Monoclonal anti-HA was kindly provided by M. Gimona (Institute of Molecular Biology, Salzburg, Austria). WW Itch was subcloned from pGAD10 into the BamHI site of the AD-vector pGADT7. Using the TNTTM T7 Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega),WW Itch and the unmodified and modified versions of occludin (wt-Occl, Occl-ΔN, Occl-ΔN1/2, and Occl-mut) were in vitro transcribed/translated from the T7 promoter, which lies downstream of the GAL4 coding sequences. Equal amounts of the 35S-labeled occludins and WW Itch were pooled and incubated at 30 °C for 1½ h. Then, 500 μl of co-immunoprecipitation buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 20 mmTris-Cl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmCaCl2, 5 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% glycerol) and 2 μg of mouse monoclonal anti-c-Myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) were added. The samples were rotated for 2 h at 4 °C followed by the addition of 20 μl of 1:1 slurry of Protein G-SepharoseTM 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Bioscience Inc.). Collection of the immunocomplexes was carried out at 4 °C for 3 h. The samples were centrifuged at 1600 × g for 30 s and washed 4 times with 1 ml of co-immunoprecipitation buffer. The samples were then resuspended in 15 μl of SDS sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and analyzed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, the gel was fixed for 30 min in 30% methanol, 10% acetic acid, soaked for 30 min in AmplifyTM (Amersham Biosciences Inc.), and dried under vacuum at 80 °C for 30 min. Bound 35S-labeled proteins were analyzed by fluorography. Co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous Itch with occludin or claudin-1 was examined using E13 whole mouse embryo homogenate. In short, embryonic tissue was homogenized in 2 ml of lysis buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 20 mmTris-Cl (pH 7.5), 250 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 5 mm Na3VO4, 25 mm NaF, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) using a tight fitting glass/Teflon homogenizer. The homogenate was kept on ice for 30 min, centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min and the supernatant was split into 4 tubes. 2.5 μg of anti-occludin or anti-claudin-1 antibody, 2 μg of anti-c-Myc (an unrelated antibody as a control), and no antibody (negative control) were added to the samples, and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. 30 μl of 1:1 slurry of Protein G-SepharoseTM 4 Fast Flow were added to each sample and immunoprecipitations were carried out at 4 °C overnight. The beads were recovered by centrifugation at 1,600 ×g for 30 s and washed four times with 1 ml of lysis buffer. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer and analyzed on 4–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Fractionated proteins were transferred to Fluorotrans Transfer Membrane (PALL) by electroblotting and immunoprobed with anti-occludin, anti-claudin-1, or anti-Itch Ab. For visualization of detected proteins immunoblots were analyzed using an ECL Western blot detection kit. LLC-PK1 cells were starved in methionine/cysteine-deficient MEM (Invitrogen) for 45 min. The medium was replaced by 1.5 ml of methionine/cysteine-deficient MEM containing 0.1 mCi/ml ARS 110-Met-label [35S] (American Radiolabeled Chemicals). After pulse labeling for 1 h, the cells were washed 3 times with nonradioactive Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and then were chased in 1.5 ml of methionine/cysteine-deficient MEM supplemented with nonradioactive l-cysteine (0.24 mg/ml) andl-methionine (0.15 mg/ml) for 0–3 h. 80 μmMG-132 (dissolved in DMSO; Calbiochem) or DMSO as a vehicle control was added to the starving, pulse labeling, and chase medium. At appropriate time intervals, the cells were washed 3 times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 300 μl of PCL buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.75% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm Na3VO4, 25 mm NaF, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and kept on ice for 30 min. The lysate was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was collected, and the protein content was determined using a BCATM-200 Protein Assay Kit (Pierce). 2.25 μg of anti-occludin or anti-claudin-1 antibody was added to equal amounts of total protein (500 μg) and immunoprecipitations were carried out as described above. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer and were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. Densitometric measurements were performed using E.A.S.Y. Win32 software (Herolab). Radiolabeled Myc-occludin, claudin-1-Myc, Myc-lamin-C, ZO-1, and ZO-2 were synthesized using the TNTTM T7 Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega) as indicated by the manufacturer. Conjugation reaction mixtures contained 16 μl of in vitrotranslated protein, 14 μl of untreated RRL, 12.5 μg of His6x-Ub (Sigma), 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phosphocreatine (Sigma), and 0.2 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase (Sigma) in a total volume of 50 μl. After an incubation period of 1 h at 37 °C 500 μl of binding buffer (5 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.9), 0.1% Triton X-100) and 30 μl of 1:1 slurry of charged His-Bind Resin (Novagen) were added. Samples were rotated for 2 h at room temperature and beads were recovered by centrifugation at 1,600 × g for 1 min. Beads were then washed 4 times with 1 ml of 60 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.9), 0.2% Triton X-100 and 2 times with 1 ml of 125 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.9), 0.1% Triton X-100. Radiolabeled ubiquitin conjugates were analyzed by electrophoresis and fluorography as described above. In vivo ubiquitination assays were performed as previously described (19Qiu L. Joazeiro C. Fang N. Wang H.Y. Elly C. Altman Y. Fang D. Hunter T. Liu Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35734-35737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). In short, HEK 293 cells were transiently co-transfected with full-length Myc-occludin cloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen), HA-ubiquitin (kindly provided by M. Treier) (22Treier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohman D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar), and Itch cDNA cloned into pEFneo. MG-132 (Calbiochem) was applied at a final concentration of 50 μm for 30 min. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody and probed with anti-HA antibody. Further endogenous occludin was immunoprecipitated from HA-ubiquitin-transfected HEK 293 cells after treatment with MG-132 (50 μm, 1 h) and collected immunocomplexes were analyzed by Western blotting using monoclonal anti-HA antibody. Generation of Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble fractions was performed as previously described (23Bazzoni G. Martinez-Estrada O.M. Orsenigo F. Cordenonsi M. Citi S. Dejana E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20520-20526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). To measure transepithelial electrical resistance, MDCK cells were plated onto FalconR cell culture inserts (Becton Dickinson) at a density of about 2 × 105 cells/cm2 and maintained in serum-containing medium until TER values reached a plateau at maximum levels (150–300 Ω·cm2). The resistance of the monolayers was determined using an EVOM voltohmmeter (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota). TER values were multiplied by the surface area of the filter (4.2 cm2) after subtraction of background values. To test for candidate proteins interacting with the NH2-terminal domain of occludin the entire NH2-terminal region (N-Occl) was used as “bait” to screen a MATCHMAKERTM mouse liver cDNA expression library. DNA from two putative positive yeast clones (WW Itch and WW Itch-Hect) (Fig.1 B) was isolated and plasmid DNA was rescued in E. coli strain DH5-α. Following plasmid purification from E. coli, inserts of both clones were sequenced and compared with the sequence entries in GenBankTM and EMBL using a BLAST2 homology search. The isolated cDNAs showed 100% identity to the coding sequence of Itch, a mouse E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase (GenBankTMaccession number AF037454) (18Perry W.L. Hustad C.M. Swing D.A. O′Sullivan T.N. Jenkings N.A. Copeland N.G. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 143-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Itch is a member of the HECT domain-containing subfamily of E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases (24Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 775-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 A shows the functional domains of mouse Itch. The HECT (homologous to the E6-associated protein carboxyl terminus) domain has been suggested to be responsible for the ubiquitinating activity of the E3 ligases, whereas the binding specificity for target proteins is mediated by sequences within the NH2 terminus. Disruption of Itch was found to induce a spectrum of immunological diseases in mutant mice, including inflammations of the large intestine with infiltrates consisting of mainly neutrophils (18Perry W.L. Hustad C.M. Swing D.A. O′Sullivan T.N. Jenkings N.A. Copeland N.G. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 143-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Whether occludin is affected in this mutant phenotype is unknown. The cDNA inserts of the clones WW Itch and WW-Itch Hect comprise 851 and 1620 bp of mouse Itch cDNA, extending from nucleotides 851–1636 and 494–2114, respectively (Fig.1 B). Interestingly, both clones encode an overlapping region containing all four WW domains of Itch. To rule out the possibility that the observed interaction was artifactual, WW Itch and WW Itch-Hect were tested for autoactivation of the E. coli lacZ reporter gene, for interaction with the GAL4 activation domain, and for interaction with an unrelated protein (human lamin C) in a two-hybrid assay. Moreover, a frameshift mutation was generated, shifting the codon usage of WW Itch by one nucleotide. As summarized in Fig.1 B and C, no interaction was found in control experiments. Additionally, interaction of WW Itch withN-Occl was still traceable when cloning vectors were switched by transferring the library insert from the AD to the DNA-BD vector and vice versa (Fig. 1 C). WW domains are protein-protein interaction modules of about 35–45 residues found in signaling and regulatory proteins (25Zarrinpar A. Lim W.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 611-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). These domains are named after a pair of highly conserved tryptophans and a strictly conserved proline. Like SH3 domains WW domains recognize proline-rich sequences although with highly diverse sequence preferences (for review, see Ref. 26Kay B.K. Williamson M.P. Sudol M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). Thus, we have tested whether the Pro9-Pro10-Tyr11-Pro12motif located in the NH2-terminal domain of occludin serves as a possible recognition site for WW Itch. Using co-immunoprecipitation and a two-hybrid assay we have found that the interaction of WW Itch with occludin is abolished when the putative WW recognition motif of occludin is mutated by substituting Pro9 and Pro10 for Ala9 and Ala10 (Fig. 1 E and Fig.2 B). We have further analyzed which of the WW domains present in WW Itch and WW Itch-Hect are responsible for the binding of Itch to the NH2 terminus of occludin (Fig.1 D). As a result, the presence of WW2 and WW4 was found to be critical for the association of Itch with occludin. Neither WW1 nor WW3 alone were able to bind to the occludin bait. The partial HECT domain which is included in WW Itch-Hect does not seem to be of importance for the interaction, since occludin-Itch interaction has also been found with WW Itch, lacking the HECT domain. Additional evidence for the association of Itch and occludin was provided by in vitro pull-down assays.35S-Labeled modified and unmodified versions of Myc-occludin and WW Itch protein were synthesized using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system. WW Itch was found to co-precipitate with wild-type occludin but not with NH2-terminal truncated occludins (occl-ΔN, occl-ΔN1/2) (Fig.2 B). This was also confirmed by our results from a two-hybrid assay, showing that the NH2 terminus of occludin is indispensable for the interaction of WW Itch with occludin (Fig. 1 E). To further substantiate the interaction found, endogenous Itch was co-precipitated with endogenous occludin from homogenized embryonic mouse tissue (Fig. 3). As controls, immunoprecipitations were carried out either in the absence of an antibody or in the presence of an unrelated antibody (mouse monoclonal anti-c-Myc). Itch specifically co-precipitated with occludin (Fig. 3,lane 2) but not with claudin-1 (Fig. 3, lane 6). Only minimal unspecific binding of Itch to the Sepharose beads could be detected. To find out whether occludin is a substrate for ubiquitination, we performed in vitro and in vivo ubiquitination experiments. For in vitro studies we used rabbit reticulocyte lysate as a source of ubiquitination enzymes.35S-Labeled occludin was incubated with the reticulocyte lysate in the presence of His6x-ubiquitin and reaction products were purified by metal chelation chromatography. In parallel,in vitro translated radiolabeled claudin-1, ZO-1, ZO-2, and lamin C (control) were tested for ubiquitination. Strong ubiquitination of occludin was observed as evidenced by a high molecular weight smear (>60,000), representing mono- and polyubiquitinated forms of occludin (Fig. 4 lane 2). In contrast to occludin, claudin-1, ZO-1, and ZO-2 were not ubiquitinatedin vitro, nor was the junction-unrelated protein lamin C (Fig. 4, lanes 5, 9, 12, and15). We have also demonstrated that ubiquitination of occludin occursin vivo. For these experiments cell lysates from HEK 293 cells overexpressing HA-ubiquitin were immunoprecipitated with anti-occludin antibody and Western blots were probed with anti-HA antibody. We found that short-term treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 significantly led to an accumulation of occludin-ubiquitin conjugates in these cells (Fig.5 A). To further confirm that Itch is critically involved in the ubiquitination of occludin, HEK 293 cells were co-transfected with Myc-occludin and HA-ubiquitin plasmids in the absence or presence of an Itch expression construct. Following immunoprecipitation of cell lysates with anti-Myc and immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody, ubiquitination of occludin was found to be specifically induced in cells overexpressing Itch (Fig. 6). Cells containing only endogenous Itch (detectable upon overexposure of immunoblots) exhibited substantially lower levels of ubiquitinated occludin. Again, MG-132 increased the levels of occludin-ubiquitin conjugates in HA-ubiquitin overexpressing cells (Fig. 6). To address the important question which pool of occludin is ubiquitinated, occludin-ubiquitin conjugates were determined in Triton X-100-extracted fractions of HEK 293 cells overexpressing HA-ubiquitin. The major portion of ubiquitinated occludin was observed in the soluble fraction (Fig. 5 B, lane 1). However, substantial amounts of occludin-ubiquitin conjugates were also detectable in the insoluble fraction (Fig. 5 B, lane 2), suggesting that Itch is capable of associating with junctional and lateral occludin as well. Since ubiquitination of proteins is usually associated with their rapid turnover, we initially investigated the turnover rate of occludin using pulse-chase experiments. Fig.7 A shows SDS-PAGE patterns of occludin immunoprecipitates from pulse-labeled LLC-PK1 cells. Our results indicate that occludin is a short-lived protein with at 12 of about 1.5 h. After a 3-h chase, only 1.2% of 35S-labeled occludin was still detectable in cell lysates of LLC-PK1 cells, while the amount of 35S-labeled claudin-1 was unchanged. When the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 was added during a 1-h pulse and the subsequent chase period, degradation of occludin was reduced by 30% (Fig. 7 B). This is in line with previous reports showing that proteasome inhibition led to the stabilization of junctional proteins such that experimentally induced scattering of epithelial cell monolayers could be inhibited (27Tsukamoto T. Nigam S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24579-24584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Similarly, the half-life of β-catenin was increased by about 3-fold upon proteasome inhibition (28Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3797-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2160) Google Scholar), and reducing connexin degradation with inhibitors of the proteasome was found to induce assembly and function of gap junctions (29Musil L.S. Le A.-Ch. N. VanSlyke J.K. Roberts L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25207-25215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Although the rapid turnover of occludin is reminiscent of degradation rates reported for connexins (29Musil L.S. Le A.-Ch. N. VanSlyke J.K. Roberts L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25207-25215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 30Laing J.G. Beyer E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26399-26403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), it appears rather unusual compared with the relatively long half-lives shown for E-cadherin (27Tsukamoto T. Nigam S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24579-24584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and desmosomal proteins (31Penn E.J. Burdett I.D. Hobson C. Magee A.I. Rees D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2327-2334Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A first attempt to study the degradation of occludin in cultured cells was made by Wong and Gumbiner (32Wong V. Gumbiner B.G. J.

Gumbiner B.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 399-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). In contrast to our findings, occludin appeared remarkably stable in this experiment, showing a first significant decrease only after 12 h of peptide treatment. It has to be mentioned that the properties of various types of epithelia and endothelia differ substantially as reflected by TER values ranging from 5 Ω·cm2 to 8,000 Ω·cm2. Thus, the slow turnover of occludin reported by Wong and Gumbiner (32Wong V. Gumbiner B.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 399-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar) may be explained by the fact that exceptionally tight A6 monolayers exhibiting TER values of up to 8,000 Ω·cm2 were used for their study. In our experiments, maximum TER values of LLC-PK1 and MDCK cells leveled at 150–300 Ω·cm2 which is consistent with most reports found in the literature. As a next step we examined whether a reduction in the rate of occludin degradation influences functional properties of TJs. To this end, MDCK cells were grown on filter supports and TER measurements were performed in the presence or absence of the proteasome inhibitor MG-132. In a first experiment, confluent MDCK cells were grown in low calcium medium (LC) for 12 h to disrupt pre-existing junctional complexes. Subsequently, the culture medium was switched to normal calcium (NC) levels with or without MG-132 and TER was measured at various time intervals. We found that MG-132 significantly accelerated the TER increase compared with control cells (Fig.8 A). On the other hand, MG-132 diminished TER decrease in MDCK monolayers switched to LC medium by about 30% (Fig. 8 B). Although it is reasonable to assume that MG-132 leads to the accumulation/stabilization of any junctional protein normally degraded by the proteasome, the exceptionally rapid increase in TER indicates that preferably short-lived junctional proteins may have been affected. The molecular mechanism underlying the “stabilizing” effect of proteasome inhibition on TJs is still unclear. However, taking into account that deubiquitinating enzymes are active at junction sites (33Taya S. Yamamoto T. Kano K. Kawano Y. Iwamatsu A. Tsuchiya T. Tanaka K. Kanai-Azuma M. Wood S.A. Mattick J.S. Kaibuchi K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1053-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar,34Taya S. Yamamoto T. Kanai-Azuma M. Wood S.A. Kaibuchi K. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 757-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), it is tempting to speculate that ubiquitinated junctional proteins, which accumulate upon proteasome inhibition, may well serve as a pool for rapid (re)integration into TJs following deubiquitination. In this way, spontaneous alterations of TJ properties could be explained. Taken together, our results provide evidence to suggest that occludin directly interacts with the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase Itch, a member of the HECT domain-containing ubiquitin-protein ligases. Our molecular studies have shown that occludin is ubiquitinated in vivoand in vitro and its turnover is slowed down by the proteasome inhibitor MG-132. Overexpression of Itch substantially increased the amount of occludin-ubiquitin conjugates predominantly present in the soluble fraction in cultured epithelial cells. Interestingly, overexpression of Itch did not alter the total amount of occludin in HEK 293 cells (not shown) nor did it perturb the localization of occludin at plasma membranes (Fig.9). Since ubiquitination of proteins is considered to be sufficient to induce their internalization, E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases exert a crucial function in the endocytosis of plasma-membrane proteins. So far, several receptors and one ion channel have been shown to undergo ubiquitination at the plasma membrane (35Hicke L.

In addition, cytoplasmic junctional components such as β-catenin and AF-6 were found to serve as targets for the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (28Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3797-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2160) Google Scholar, 33Taya S. Yamamoto T. Kano K. Kawano Y. Iwamatsu A. Tsuchiya T. Tanaka K. Kanai-Azuma M. Wood S.A. Mattick J.S. Kaibuchi K. J.

Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 757-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Interestingly, claudin-1 did not interact with Itch nor was it ubiquitinated in HEK 293 cells. Together with our results showing that turnover rates of occludin and claudin differed markedly in pulse-chase experiments, this finding supports the notion that occludin and claudins exert physiologically distinct functions at TJs and thus are subjected to different degradation pathways. Previous reports have already suggested that TJ function can be up-regulated at the level of occludin turnover (32Wong V. Gumbiner B.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 399-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). We now provide further molecular evidence to understand the regulatory steps underlying this dynamic process of TJ modulation. We thank R. Fuchs for excellent technical assistance and G. Baier for valuable discussions and practical help."

Angiogenesis is critical for normal embryonic vascular development as well as a number of physiological and pathological conditions, including ischemic diseases, inflammation, and cancer. Binding of VEGF to VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) leads to receptor phosphorylation and subsequent activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), phospholipase C-γ1, Src family tyrosine kinases, and other signaling proteins (1.Ferrara N.

Experimental evidence has shown that activation of PI3K is critical for VEGF-mediated endothelial cell proliferation, survival, and migration. Moreover, downstream activation of Akt by PI3K is responsible for phosphorylation and activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) by VEGF (6.Dimmeler S. Dernbach E. Zeiher A.M.

Recent studies demonstrated that the 3-phosphoinositides are important substrates for PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homology deleted from chromosome 10) both in vitro (12.Maehama T. Dixon J.E. J.

PTEN was originally identified as a candidate tumor suppressor gene based on its high frequency of mutation in a variety of tumors (15.Li J. Yen C. Liaw D. Podsypanina K. Bose S. Wang S.I. Puc J. Miliaresis C. Rodgers L. McCombie R. Bigner S.H. Giovanella B.C. Ittmann M. Tycko B. Hibshoosh H. Wigler M.H. Parsons R. Science. 1997; 275: 1943-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (4201) Google Scholar). PTEN was subsequently found to exhibit both protein tyrosine phosphatase and inositol 3′-phosphatase activity. However, its lipid phosphatase activity appears to be primarily responsible for its tumor suppressor effects, as mutation or loss of PTEN results in increased 3-phosphoinositides and downstream activation of Akt (13.Stambolic V.

Most studies of PTEN have focused on its role in tumor cell biology; however, a recent report demonstrated that PTEN could modulate the response of cardiac myocytes to PI3K activation and thereby regulate myocyte survival and hypertrophy (24.Schwartzbauer G. Robbins J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35786-35793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Based on the roles of PI3K and Akt in signaling by VEGF, we hypothesized that PTEN could regulate VEGF-mediated endothelial cellular responses and angiogenesis. In this report, we demonstrate that inhibition of endogenous endothelial PTEN by adenovirus-mediated overexpression of a dominant negative PTEN mutant in cultured endothelial cells potently enhances a variety of VEGF-mediated cellular responses, including cell survival, mitogenesis, and migration. In contrast, these effects of VEGF are significantly inhibited by overexpression of wild-type PTEN. Moreover, overexpression of wild-type or dominant negative PTEN modulated endothelial tube formation in vitro and vascular sprouting in an ex vivo model of angiogenesis.

The recombinant adenoviral vector DNA was transfected into human embryonic kidney 293 cells with LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen), then the viruses were serially amplified in 293 cells, purified on a CsCl density gradient by ultracentrifugation, and titered as described previously (30.Channon K.M.

When the cells were nearly confluent, the medium was changed to EGM containing 2% FBS, and viruses were added to the medium at a dilution of 1:1000 (multiplicity of infection ∼100). The cells were incubated for 16 h at 37 °C, then the medium was changed to serum-free endothelial basal medium (EBM, Clonetics Corp.), and the cells were treated as indicated. Cells were lysed in Triton lysis buffer (137 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) containing protease inhibitors (1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm NaF, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin). An aliquot of each lysate was separated by PAGE and Western-blotted with the indicated antibodies. Two assays of programmed cell death were used. To assay caspase-3 activity, HUVECs were plated in triplicate at 3 × 105 cells/well of a 6-well plate and grown overnight in EGM-MV containing 5% FBS. The following day the medium was changed to EGM containing 2% FBS, and the cells were either left uninfected or were infected with AdPTEN-WT, AdPTEN-C/S, or AdEV overnight. The next day apoptosis was induced by serum starvation in EBM and treatment with TNFα (50 ng/ml). Half of the cells were treated with VEGF (50 ng/ml), and half were left untreated, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. Cells were lysed, and an aliquot of each cell lysate was used in a fluorimetric assay of caspase-3 activity (EnzChek caspase-3 assay kit, Molecular Probes, E-13138) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To confirm the effects of wild-type and inactive PTEN on caspase-3 activity, apoptosis was also evaluated using the cell death detection ELISA-Plus kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, 1774425). HUVECs were plated in triplicate wells of a 24-well plate. The cells were left uninfected or were infected with AdPTEN-WT, AdPTEN-C/S, or AdEV overnight, and apoptosis was induced as described above in VEGF-treated and -untreated cells. Cells were lysed, and cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragmentation (mono- and oligonucleosomes) was detected by spectrophotometry according to the manufacturer's instructions. The migration of HUVECs was determined using a “scratch” wound assay as described previously (6.Dimmeler S. Dernbach E. Zeiher A.M.

Science. 1998; 280: 1614-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). Briefly, HUVECs were grown in triplicate in 60-mm dishes, and when confluent, they were left uninfected or were infected with AdPTEN-WT, AdPTEN-C/S, or AdEV for 16 h. The cell monolayer was scraped with a sterile rubber policeman to create a cell-free zone, then washed once with medium and treated with or without VEGF (20 ng/ml) in EGM containing 2% FBS. HUVEC migration was quantified by measuring the width of the cell-free zone (distance between the edges of the injured monolayer) at 4 distinct positions 24 h after treatment on an Olympus IX-70 inverted microscope connected to a Diagnostic Instruments Spot RT Color Camera, and data were analyzed with NIH Image, v.1.6.2. To evaluate the effect of PTEN on VEGF-mediated DNA synthesis, [3H]thymidine incorporation was assayed as described previously (33.Huang L. Sankar S. Lin C. Kontos C.D. Schroff A.D. Cha E.H.

Briefly, uninfected, AdPTEN-WT-, AdPTEN-C/S-, or AdEV-infected HUVECs were plated at 25,000 cells/well of a 24-well plate, quiesced by incubation in EBM for 24 h, then treated with or without VEGF (20 ng/ml) for 18 h. The cells were pulse-labeled with [3H]thymidine (2 μCi/ml, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) for 3 h, the DNA was precipitated, and the amount of [3H]thymidine incorporation was determined by liquid scintillation counting. To confirm the effects of PTEN on VEGF-mediated cellular proliferation, cell counts were performed. Uninfected, AdPTEN-WT-, AdPTEN-C/S-, and empty virus-infected HUVECs were plated in triplicate wells of 24-well plates in a volume of 500 μl of EGM-MV and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. The following day the medium was changed to EBM with or without VEGF (20 ng/ml). After 24 h the medium was replaced with fresh EBM with or without VEGF (20 ng/ml) and incubated for an additional 24 h. After 48 h, cells were trypsinized and resuspended in EGM-MV. Cell numbers in each group were counted on a hemacytometer (Fisher) using an Olympus CK2 inverted microscope. Data were expressed as the means ± S.E.

HUVECs were left uninfected or were infected with AdPTEN-WT, AdPTEN-C/S, or AdEV for 16 h, then were trypsinized and resuspended in EGM containing 2% FBS. Wells of a 96-well plate were coated with ECMatrix solution, and 5 × 103 cells were plated in triplicate wells in a volume of 50 μl of EGM containing 2% FBS either with or without VEGF (25 ng/ml). The cells were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C, and tube formation was evaluated by phase-contrast microscopy using an Olympus IX-70 microscope (100× magnification) connected to a Diagnostic Instruments Spot RT Color Camera. To determine the viability of cells in these assays, cells were stained with Hoechst 33342 (5 μg/ml, Sigma) and propidium iodide (2.5 μg/ml, Sigma) for 5 min at 37 °C and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. This ex vivo angiogenesis assay was performed essentially as described previously (33.Huang L. Sankar S. Lin C. Kontos C.D. Schroff A.D. Cha E.H. Feng S.-M. Li S.-F. Yu Z. Van Etten R.L.

Thoracic aortas were excised from 2–3-week-old Sprague-Dawley male rats and immediately placed into cold Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% FBS. Clotted blood inside the aorta was flushed with media, and the periadventitial fibroadipose tissue was removed. Aortas were then cut into cross-sectional rings ∼1–1.5 mm in length. Aortic rings were mock-infected or infected with 2 × 1011 viral particles of AdPTEN-WT, AdPTEN-C/S, or AdEV in 1.0 ml of DMEM, 2% FBS, at room temperature for 15 min. Rings were placed into wells of a 24-well plate containing 0.4 ml of cold growth factor-reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences) then incubated at 37 °C until the Matrigel polymerized. The wells were then overlaid with 0.5 ml of EBM without phenol red, and the rings were maintained at 37 °C for up to 10 days with medium changes every 2 days. Vascular sprouting from each ring was examined daily on an Olympus IX-70 microscope (100× magnification), and digital images were obtained. Quantitative analysis of endothelial sprouting was performed using images from day 5, and sprout length was quantified in NIH Image (v.1.6.2) using a calibrated micrometer. The greatest distance from the aortic ring body to the end of the vascular sprouts was measured at three distinct points per ring and in three different rings per treatment group. All results were expressed as the mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using the one-tailed Student's t test (two sample, unequal variance), and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. We first analyzed whether PTEN is expressed in endothelial cells. Lysates from several different immortalized endothelial cell lines as well as primary HUVECs and NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were analyzed by Western blotting with an antibody against PTEN. PTEN was expressed to varying degrees in both EA.hy926 cells (25.Edgell C.-J.S. McDonald C.C. Graham J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3734-3737Crossref PubMed Scopus (1344) Google Scholar) and HUVECs, but it was not detectable in EC-RF24 cells (27.Fontijn R. Hop C. Brinkman H.J. Slater R. Westerveld A. van Mourik J.A. Pannekoek H. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 216: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). PTEN was highly expressed in Py-4-1 cells, a murine microvascular endothelial cell line (26.Dubois N.A. Kolpack L.C. Wang R. Azizkhan R.G. Bautch V.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 196: 302-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), as well as in parental NIH 3T3 cells and 3T3 cells stably expressing chimeric fms-Tie1 or fms-Tie2 receptors (28.Kontos C.D. Stauffer T. Yang W.-P. York J.D. Huang L. Blanar M.A. Meyer T. Peters K.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4131-4140Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The expression of PTEN in endothelial cells indicates that this protein could potentially modulate VEGF-mediated signaling. VEGF is known to activate the PI3K/Akt pathway (5.Fujio Y. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16349-16354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar); therefore, we investigated whether PTEN overexpression could alter VEGF-mediated Akt phosphorylation. Primary HUVECs were either left uninfected or were infected with recombinant adenoviruses encoding wild-type PTEN (AdPTEN-WT), a catalytically inactive mutant of PTEN in which cysteine 124 has been mutated to serine (AdPTEN-C/S), or an empty adenovirus as a control for viral infection (AdEV). After overnight virus infection, the cells were serum-starved for 6 h and then treated with or without VEGF. Endogenous PTEN was detectable at moderate levels in both uninfected and AdEV-infected HUVECs, whereas both wild-type and inactive PTEN were overexpressed after virus infection (Fig. 2). VEGF treatment increased Akt phosphorylation in uninfected and AdEV-infected cells. Importantly, overexpression of PTEN-WT abrogated this effect, whereas PTEN-C/S enhanced phosphorylation of Akt. Similar amounts of total Akt and tubulin were observed in each lane, demonstrating that the effects on Akt phosphorylation were a result of the PTEN proteins themselves. VEGF treatment also enhanced the phosphorylation of ERK1 and -2, but this was not altered by overexpression of either wild-type or inactive PTEN (Fig. 2), suggesting that VEGF-mediated ERK activation is not dependent on the production of 3-phosphoinositides. Akt is known to play a critical role in cell survival mediated by VEGF (5.Fujio Y. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16349-16354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). To determine whether the effects of PTEN on VEGF-mediated Akt phosphorylation in HUVECs correlated with the effects on apoptosis, we evaluated caspase-3 cleavage in HUVECs induced to undergo apoptosis. Caspase-3 is a key mediator of apoptosis, and cleavage of this enzyme to its active form correlates with the onset of apoptosis. HUVECs were infected with PTEN or control viruses, and the cells were serum-starved and treated with TNFα, which has been shown to induce endothelial cell apoptosis (38.Hermann C. Assmus B. Urbich C. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 402-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In lysates from uninfected cells and those infected with AdPTEN-WT or AdEV, VEGF treatment blocked the TNFα-induced cleavage of caspase-3 (Fig. 3). Overexpression of PTEN-WT increased basal caspase-3 cleavage and appeared to reduce the protective effect of VEGF in these cells. In contrast, essentially no cleaved caspase-3 was detectable in cells expressing PTEN-C/S either with or without VEGF treatment. These findings indicate that overexpression of PTEN-WT enhances endothelial cell apoptosis, whereas inhibition of PTEN is protective. To confirm the effects of PTEN overexpression on endothelial cell apoptosis, we assayed both capase-3 activity and DNA fragmentation. HUVECs were infected with recombinant adenoviruses, and apoptosis was induced by serum starvation and TNFα treatment. Cell lysates were then used in a fluorimetric assay of caspase-3 activity. Consistent with the Western blotting results, VEGF treatment reduced caspase-3 activity in all cells, including those infected with AdPTEN-C/S (Fig. 4A). However, overexpression of PTEN-WT significantly increased, whereas PTEN-C/S significantly decreased caspase-3 activity compared with control cells, both with and without VEGF treatment. Similar results were obtained using a spectrophotometric assay of histone-associated DNA fragmentation, although the effects of PTEN-WT overexpression were not as pronounced (Fig. 4B). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that PTEN modulates the anti-apoptotic effects of VEGF. Although PTEN did not appear to alter VEGF-mediated MAP kinase activation, we evaluated the effects of wild-type and inactive PTEN on VEGF-mediated endothelial cell proliferation. HUVECs were either left uninfected or were infected with AdPTEN-WT, AdPTEN-C/S, or AdEV, then DNA synthesis was assayed by [3H]thymidine incorporation. As expected, VEGF induced an increase in DNA synthesis in both uninfected and empty virus-infected HUVECs (Fig. 5A). Overexpression of PTEN-C/S resulted in a significant increase in VEGF-stimulated DNA synthesis. In contrast, PTEN-WT markedly reduced both basal and VEGF-mediated thymidine incorporation. Notably, overexpression of PTEN-WT in HUVECs led to a marked increase in the number of apoptotic-appearing cells (data not shown), consistent with our earlier results demonstrating that PTEN-WT enhanced endothelial cell apoptosis. To confirm the results of thymidine incorporation assays, we performed cell counts on uninfected HUVECs and on those infected with the PTEN or control adenoviruses. Cells were treated for 48 h with or without VEGF, then trypsinized and counted in triplicate. In all g"

To determine whether VEGF/VPF is directly involved in chemokine secretion, we analyzed its effects on chemokine expression in human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) by using a human cytokine cDNA array kit. Cytokine array analysis revealed a significant increase in expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and the chemokine receptor CXCR4 in HBMECs, a result similar to that described previously in other endothelial cells. Interestingly, we also observed that VEGF/VPF induced interleukin-8 (IL-8) expression in HBMECs and that IL-8 mRNA was maximal after 1 h of VEGF/VPF treatment of the cells. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay data and immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that although VEGF/VPF induced IL-8 expression at the translational level in HBMECs, basic fibroblast growth factor failed to induce this protein expression within 12 h. VEGF/VPF increased IL-8 production in HBMECs through activation of nuclear factor-KB via calcium and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathways, whereas the ERK pathway was not involved in this process. Supernatants of the VEGF/VPF-treated HBMECs significantly increased neutrophil migration across the HBMEC monolayer compared with those of the untreated control. Furthermore, addition of anti-IL-8 antibody blocked this increased migration, indicating that VEGF/VPF induced the functional expression of IL-8 protein in HBMECs. Taken together, these data demonstrate for the first time that VEGF/VPF induces IL-8 expression in HBMECs and contributes to leukocyte infiltration through the expression of chemokines, such as IL-8, in endothelial cells.

Brain edema is a major life-threatening complication in a variety of brain injuries, including those caused by stroke and tumors. The common form of brain edema is defined by the disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) (1Betz A.L. Vasogenic Brain Edema. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1997: 156-159Google Scholar). The BBB, which constitutes the endothelium and its surrounding cells, is an anatomic structure that is defined mainly by tight junctions between the brain endothelial cells. These junctions strictly regulate the flow of ions, nutrients, and cells into the brain. Hypoxia is believed to be a precondition for edema development in the brain and mediates leukocyte infiltration through the up-regulation of adhesion molecules and chemokine release (2Stanimirovic D. Satoh K. Brain Pathol. 2000; 10: 113-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 3Bona E. Andersson A.L. Blomgren K. Gilland E. Puka-Sundvall M. Gustafson K. Hagberg H. Pediatr. Res. 1999; 45: 500-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Hypoxia has been shown to contribute to the leakage of the BBB by inducing increases in vascular permeability (4Olesen S.P. Brain Res. 1986; 368: 24-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 5Tanno H. Nockels R.P. Pitts L.H. Noble L.J. J. Neurotrauma. 1992; 9: 335-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Hypoxia is a strong inducer of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), also known as vascular permeability factor (VPF) (6Ikeda E. Achen M.G. Breier G. Risau W. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1999; 276: C812-C820Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Mayhan W.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1148-C1153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and significant mitotic activity specific to vascular endothelial cells (10Ferrara N. Davis-Smyth T. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 4-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar). VEGF/VPF induces signaling mediated by its receptors, the Flt-1 and Flk-1/KDR tyrosine kinases, whose expressions are restricted almost exclusively to endothelial cells (11Plate K.H. Beck H. Danner S. Allegrini P.R. Wiessner C. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1999; 58: 654-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Expression of VEGF/VPF has been identified in cells correlated with brain inflammation, including microglial cells and reactive astrocytes, suggesting its central role in inflammation of the central nervous system (12Proescholdt M.A. Heiss J.D. Walbridge S. Muhlhauser J. Capogrossi M.C. Oldfield E.H. Merrill M.J. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1999; 58: 613-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 13Neufeld G. Cohen T. Gengrinovitch S. Poltorak Z. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (3163) Google Scholar). For example, enhanced expression of VEGF/VPF and its receptors was shown to be induced in the rat brain after focal cerebral ischemia (14Kovacs Z. Ikezaki K. Samoto K. Inamura T. Fukui M. Stroke. 1996; 27: 1865-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 15Hayashi T. Abe K. Suzuki H. Itoyama Y. Stroke. 1997; 28: 2039-2044Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 16Lennmyr F.

Powers C. Bruggen N.V. Chopp M.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 829-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). However, edema formation and brain damage after ischemia or stroke were reduced significantly by antagonism of VEGF/VPF or by inhibition of its signaling pathway (18van Bruggen N. Thibodeaux H. Palmer J.T. Lee W.P. Fu L. Cairns B. Tumas D. Gerlai R. Williams S.P. van Lookeren Campagne M. Ferrara N. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1613-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 19Paul R.

Med. 2001; 7: 222-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), indicating that VEGF/VPF is a key mediator in the pathogenesis of these disorders. VEGF/VPF induces expression of the monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) in bovine retinal endothelial cells (20Marumo T. Schini-Kerth V.B. Busse R. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1131-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) and of the SDF-1 receptor CXCR4 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (21Salcedo R. Wasserman K. Young H.A. Grimm M.C.

These reports suggest that VEGF/VPF not only mediates brain injuries through the leakage of the BBB, but also may have a relevant role in the recruitment of leukocytes through the up-regulation of chemokines. However, its role in the regulation of chemokines is not well elucidated because of the redundancy of chemokines. Chemokines are a superfamily of small, cytokine-like proteins that induce the directional migration of various hematopoietic cells through their interaction with G protein-coupled receptors (22Rollins B.J. Blood. 1997; 90: 909-928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Nelson P.J. Krensky A.M. Immunity. 2001; 14: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). To date, 44 chemokines and 21 chemokine receptors have been described (23Nelson P.J. Krensky A.M. Immunity. 2001; 14: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the effects of VEGF/VPF on chemokine expression in human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) using a human cytokine cDNA array kit containing 34 chemokines and 14 chemokine receptors. We isolated total RNA from unstimulated and VEGF/VPF-stimulated HBMECs and analyzed the gene expression of both samples by hybridizing them with the cytokine cDNA array. Our results demonstrate that VEGF/VPF significantly increased MCP-1 and CXCR4 expression in HBMECs, similar to results reported in other endothelial cell types (20Marumo T. Schini-Kerth V.B. Busse R. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1131-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 21Salcedo R. Wasserman K. Young H.A. Grimm M.C. Howard O.M. Anver M.R. Kleinman H.K. Murphy W.J. Oppenheim J.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 1125-1135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we also found that VEGF/VPF induced interleukin-8 (IL-8) expression in HBMECs. IL-8, which belongs to the CXC chemokine family, is a potent chemoattractant for neutrophils and T lymphocytes but not monocytes (22Rollins B.J. Blood. 1997; 90: 909-928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we have characterized IL-8 expression and secretion upon VEGF stimulation of HBMECs and determined the role of IL-8 in modulating neutrophil transendothelial migration. Based on these observations we suggest that, in addition to its angiogenic activity and vascular permeable property, VEGF/VPF has a role as an indirect leukocyte migrating factor through the up-regulation of chemokines including MCP-1 and IL-8. VEGF/VPF, bFGF, the human cytokine cDNA array kit, IL-8, IL-8 antibody, the IL-8 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit, quantitative IL-8 mRNA kits, and the SDF-1α ELISA kit were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis). TMB-8, PD98059, LY294002, chelerythrine chloride, cycloheximide,l-NAME, and SU-1498 were purchased from Calbiochem. Fibronectin was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Von Willebrand factor was purchased from Dako (Carpinteria, CA). Matrigel and PDTC were purchased from Sigma. Acetylated low density lipoprotein (AcLDL) was purchased from Biomedical Technologies, Inc. (Stoughton, MA). HBMECs were purchased from Cell Systems, Inc. (Kirkland, WA). The cells were seeded onto attachment factor-coated culture plates and maintained in CSC-complete medium according to the protocol of the manufacturer. HBMECs were grown subconfluently onto attachment factor-coated 100-mm dishes. The cells were starved in 0.5% FBS containing serum-free CSC medium for 4 h and then stimulated with 30 ng/ml VEGF for 5 h. Total RNA preparation and hybridization procedures were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, equal amounts (2 μg) of total RNA from unstimulated or VEGF-stimulated HBMECs were used for the cytokine cDNA array analysis, with a commercially available membrane (R&D Systems). The membranes were prehybridized at 68 °C for 2 h in a hybrid solution (R&D Systems) containing 100 μg/ml freshly boiled salmon sperm DNA, after which the cDNA probes were hybridized onto the membranes at 68 °C for 18 h. The membranes were washed three times in low stringency washing buffer (2 × SSC and 1% SDS) and three times in high stringency washing buffer (0.1 × SSC and 0.5% SDS) at 68 °C for 20 min each. The membranes were exposed on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) and analyzed using ArrayVision™ software (Imaging Research Inc., Ontario, Canada). The amount of IL-8 mRNA was measured using quantitative IL-8 mRNA kits as directed by the manufacturer. Briefly, HBMECs were grown subconfluently in CSC-complete medium in gelatin-coated 60-mm dishes. The medium was replaced by serum-free CSC medium containing 0.5% FBS, and the cells were starved for 4 h. After incubation with VEGF/VPF for the indicated times, total RNA was isolated, and equal amounts (2 μg) were evaluated for IL-8 content using quantitative IL-8 mRNA kits. Chemokine release was quantitated by ELISA as directed by the manufacturer. Briefly, HBMECs were grown subconfluently in CSC-complete medium in gelatin-coated 24-well plates. The medium was replaced by serum-free CSC medium containing 0.5% FBS, and the cells were starved for 4 h. Synthetic inhibitors were added to the cells for 1 h before the assay was initiated. After incubation for the indicated times, the culture supernatant was removed and evaluated for IL-8 content using the ELISA kit. HBMECs were grown subconfluently onto attachment factor-coated 100-mm dishes. The cells were starved in 5 ml of 0.5% FBS containing serum-free CSC medium for 4 h and then stimulated with 30 ng/ml VEGF or 30 ng/ml bFGF for 12 h. After incubation, 5 ml of supernatant from HBMECs was harvested and incubated with 5 μg of human IL-8-specific goat IgG at 4 °C. After overnight incubation, protein G-Sepharose at 1:100 was added to the reaction mixture and incubated for 6 h. The immune complexes were precipitated with the Sepharose beads, washed, and resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer with reducing agent. The samples were separated by 15% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore, Boston, MA). The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dried milk in phosphate-buffered saline and subsequently incubated with goat anti-human IL-8 antibody for 2 h at room temperature. Bound antibodies were detected by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat IgG and enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). An adenoviral construct encoding a constitutively active form of Akt (Ad-myrAkt) was constructed as described previously (24Fujio Y. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16349-16354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). HBMECs were grown subconfluently in CSC-complete medium in gelatin-coated six-well plates. The medium was replaced by serum-free CSC medium containing 0.5% FBS, and the cells were starved for 4 h. HBMECs were infected with Ad-myrAkt at a multiplicity of infection of 100. A synthetic inhibitor of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), PDTC (20 μm), was added to the cells for 1 h before infection. After incubation for 24 h, the culture supernatant was removed and evaluated for IL-8 content using the ELISA kit. Alternatively, the cells were lysed, and 50 μg of total protein was resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blot analysis by using rabbit anti-human phospho-Akt antibody (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). To verify the amount of loaded proteins, blots were reprobed with rabbit anti-human C-terminal SRC kinase antibody. Human neutrophils were purified from normal donors by dextran sedimentation and Ficoll gradient centrifugation followed by hypotonic lysis of erythrocytes (25Taniguchi N. Gutteridge J.M. Experimental Protocols for Reactive Oxygen and Nitrogen Species. Oxford University Press, London2000: 40-41Google Scholar). Neutrophils were then resuspended in serum-free CSC medium containing 0.5% FBS. The purity of neutrophils prepared in this way was >95% as judged by the morphology of stained cytocentrifuged preparations, and the viability was >98% as judged by trypan blue exclusion. HBMECs were grown confluently onto gelatin-coated 100-mm dishes. The cells were starved in 5 ml of 0.5% FBS containing serum-free CSC medium for 4 h and then stimulated with 30 ng/ml VEGF for 12 h. After incubation, 5 ml of supernatant from HBMECs was harvested and stored frozen at −20 °C before use. Transendothelial migration of neutrophils was performed using Transculture chambers with pore size of 3 μm (Costar Corp., Corning, NY). Approximately 100,000 HBMECs were added to fibronectin-coated 24-well Transculture chambers and grown for 4 days in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The medium was replaced every day with fresh medium. 0.6 ml of medium from untreated or VEGF/VPF-treated HBMECs was added to the lower compartment. Media that were not exposed to cells were used as the control. 20 μg/ml human IL-8-specific goat antibody or 20 μg/ml normal goat antibody was added to the VEGF/VPF-treated supernatant for 1 h before the assay was initiated, as indicated. In the upper compartment, 1 × 106 neutrophils in 0.1 ml of 0.5% FBS containing serum-free CSC medium were added onto the HBMEC monolayer. The chambers were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The cells in the lower compartments were counted on a hemocytometer. The results are presented as the means ± S.D. of three separate experiments and are expressed as the increase in the number of cells migrating toward the lower compartment. The HBMECs formed tubular-like networks on Matrigel (Fig. 1 A) and had the ability to uptake AcLDL (Fig. 1 B), indicating that these cells maintained the general properties of endothelial cells. The cells also produced von Willebrand factor (data not shown), an endothelium-specific marker. During the course of the experiment, the cells were used until passages 4 to 10 and checked repeatedly for expression of von Willebrand factor. To examine whether VEGF/VPF induces chemokines or their receptors in HBMECs, we used a cytokine cDNA array containing 34 chemokines and 14 chemokine receptors. We isolated total RNA from unstimulated and VEGF/VPF-stimulated HBMECs (5-h stimulation). The cytokine cDNA membranes were hybridized and exposed on a PhosphorImager and then analyzed using ArrayVision™ software. The results showed that VEGF/VPF predominantly up-regulated IL-8, MCP-1, and CXCR4 mRNA expression in HBMECs (Fig.2 and TableI). Our data are consistent with previous studies showing that VEGF/VPF induces expression of MCP-1 and CXCR4 in other endothelial cells (20Marumo T. Schini-Kerth V.B. Busse R.

Interestingly, we also found that VEGF/VPF significantly increased IL-8 mRNA expression in HBMECs (Fig. 2 and Table I). To determine further whether VEGF/VPF regulates IL-8 expression at the mRNA level, HBMECs were exposed to VEGF/VPF for various times, and the amount of IL-8 mRNA was determined by using a quantitative IL-8 mRNA kit. The results showed that VEGF/VPF induced IL-8 mRNA expression. This expression reached a maximal level of transcription at 1 h (13-fold increase compared with control) and decreased to control levels at 12 h (Fig.3). These data indicate that VEGF/VPF induced expression of IL-8 mRNA in a rapid and transient manner.Table IExpression of chemokines and their receptors in VEGF/VPF-treated HBMECsChemokines and chemokine receptorsControl sVOLVEGF sVOLVEGF/control ratio (VOL)Midkine22.5627.301.21MIG−0.120.82−6.83MIP-1α−0.320.58−1.80MIP-1β−0.120.98−8.13MIP-3α0.600.220.36MIP-3β0.600.180.296Ckine0.841.141.35MPIF-12.001.340.67BLC/BCA-10.600.460.76PARC0.680.861.26IP-100.32−0.82−2.58RANTES0.400.300.74ENA-780.361.303.60SDF-13.123.661.17Eotaxin0.400.501.24TARC1.320.340.25Eotaxin-21.080.860.79TECK0.60−0.50−0.84Decorin0.680.500.73Fractalkine1.24−0.06−0.05GRO-α1.120.220.19GRO-β2.520.900.36GRO-γ2.962.300.78HCC-12.202.421.10HCC-40.961.341.39I-3090.881.982.25Chemokines and chemokine receptorsControl sVOLVEGF sVOLVEGF/control ratio (VOL)IL-8*1.204.743.95LDGF1.320.060.04Lymphotactin0.441.182.67MCP-1*4.728.541.81MCP-22.961.860.63MCP-31.040.460.44MCP-40.08−0.78−9.80MDC0.12−0.34−2.87CCR-11.68−0.06−0.04CCR-2A1.480.380.25CCR-2B−0.16−0.382.40CCR-31.640.380.23CCR-41.32−0.42−0.32CCR-51.160.580.50CCR-6−0.560.34−0.60CCR-71.720.100.06CCR-91.360.460.34CX3CR-11.990.300.15CXCR-10.880.860.97CXCR-22.601.540.59CXCR-4*25.4436.781.45CXCR-54.764.500.94Genomic DNA224.16213.100.95Genomic DNA217.36227.341.05Genomic DNA225.72207.100.92Genomic DNA223.92228.741.02The cytokine cDNA membranes were hybridized with total RNA isolated from unstimulated and VEGF/VPF-stimulated HBMECs.

The amount of IL-8 mRNA was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Briefly, HBMECs were grown subconfluently in CSC-complete medium in gelatin-coated 60-mm dishes. The medium was replaced by serum-free CSC medium containing 0.5% FBS, and the cells were starved for 4 h. After incubation with VEGF/VPF for the indicated times, total RNA was isolated, and equal amounts (2 μg) of total RNA were evaluated for IL-8 content using a quantitative IL-8 mRNA kit. One atmol of human IL-8 was considered to be 524 fg according to the protocol of the manufacturer. The results are presented as the means ± S.D. of triplicate samples.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The cytokine cDNA membranes were hybridized with total RNA isolated from unstimulated and VEGF/VPF-stimulated HBMECs.

Next, to determine whether IL-8 expression was regulated at the protein level, the supernatants of VEGF/VPF-treated HBMECs were collected and analyzed for IL-8 secretion by ELISA. When HBMECs were exposed to different concentrations (1, 10, 30, 100 ng/ml) of VEGF/VPF for 24 h, increased IL-8 production with a maximal level of translation at 30 ng/ml was observed (data not shown). At this concentration, VEGF/VPF increased IL-8 production by as early as 3 h, and this increase was sustained for up to 32 h (Fig. 4). We also determined whether the leukocyte chemoattractant SDF-1α was induced by VEGF/VPF. When the supernatants of the 30 ng/ml VEGF/VPF-treated HBMECs were tested by specific SDF-1α ELISA, we observed no increase in SDF-1α protein in these supernatants compared with the untreated control (data not shown). These results are in agreement with the results of the cytokine cDNA array shown in Fig. 2 and Table I. In addition, we examined whether bFGF, known as a potent mitogen to endothelial cells, increased IL-8 or SDF-1α production in HBMECs. Within 12 h of 30 ng/ml bFGF treatment, we observed no increase in IL-8 protein in the samples compared with the untreated controls. However, after 12 h of bFGF treatment, the amount of IL-8 in the samples was greater than that in the untreated controls, although it was much smaller than in the VEGF/VPF-treated samples (Fig. 4). On the other hand, we observed no increase in SDF-1α protein in the supernatants of the bFGF-treated HBMECs compared with the untreated control (data not shown). To confirm the molecular characterization of the VEGF/VPF-induced IL-8 protein expression, we performed immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. For these studies, supernatants from untreated, VEGF/VPF-, or bFGF-treated HBMECs were incubated with goat anti-human IL-8 antibody, and the immune complexes precipitated with protein G-Sepharose were then analyzed by Western blotting. As seen in Fig. 5, a significant increase in the band corresponding to a molecular mass of ∼8 kDa was detected in the VEGF/VPF-treated conditioned medium. This VEGF/VPF-induced band migrated to a position similar to that of the human recombinant IL-8. These results support the molecular identity of the VEGF/VPF-induced IL-8 as being comparable with that of the recombinant IL-8. Therefore, VEGF/VPF stimulated the secretion of IL-8 protein in HBMECs. To confirm further that VEGF/VPF up-regulated IL-8 expression via new protein synthesis in HBMECs, the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide was used to treat HBMECs for 12 h, and VEGF/VPF-induced IL-8 production was then evaluated by ELISA. As shown in Fig. 6, 10 μm cycloheximide was enough to block VEGF/VPF-induced IL-8 production in HBMECs potently. In addition, VEGF/VPF-induced IL-8 production was also inhibited significantly by 10 μm SU-1498, an inhibitor of its receptor Flk-1/KDR (Fig. 6). These data demonstrate that VEGF/VPF increased IL-8 production at the translational level through its receptor in HBMECs. VEGF/VPF has been shown to stimulate several molecules mediating intracellular signals, including mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase), protein kinase C, and calcium in endothelial cells (26Petrova T.V. Makinen T. Alitalo K. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 27Gerber H.P. McMurtrey A. Kowalski J. Yan M. Keyt B.A. Dixit V. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30336-30343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1745) Google Scholar). Because there are multiple VEGF/VPF signaling pathways, we examined which of these pathways were responsible for the increased IL-8 production in HBMECs. As shown in Fig. 7 A, the intracellular calcium chelator TMB-8 (10 μm) and PI3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 (10 μm) significantly blocked IL-8 production stimulated by VEGF/VPF, whereas the protein kinase C inhibitor chelerythrine chloride (2 μm) and nitric oxide synthase inhibitor l-NAME (1 mm) moderately inhibited its production. However, the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (10 μm) had no effect on IL-8 production in HBMECs stimulated by VEGF/VPF. Next, we investigated the effect of PDTC, the inhibitor of NF-κB, on VEGF/VPF-induced IL-8 production in HBMECs. The transcriptional factor NF-κB has been shown to mediate IL-8 expression in endothelial cells upon treatment with various stimuli, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (28Munoz C. Pascual-Salcedo D. Castellanos M.C. Alfranca A. Aragones J. Vara A. Redondo M.J. de Landazuri M.O. Blood. 1996; 88: 3482-3490Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Yoshida S. Ono M. Shono T. Izumi H. Ishibashi T. Suzuki H. Kuwano M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4015-4023Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar), whereas the intracellular calcium chelator TMB-8 has been shown to inhibit the activation of NF-κB (30Kurose I. Saito H. Miura S. Ebinuma H. Higuchi H. Watanabe N. Zeki S. Nakamura T. Takaishi M. Ishii H. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 867-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 31Gong G. Waris G. Tanveer R. Siddiqui A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9599-9604Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). As expected, the NF-κB inhibitor PDTC (20 μm) significantly blocked IL-8 production in HBMECs stimulated by VEGF/VPF (Fig. 7 A). We further examined whether the PI3-kinase pathway mediates VEGF/VPF-induced IL-8 production in HBMECs through NF-κB activation. To test this possibility, HBMECs were infected with Ad-myrAkt, which can express constitutively active Akt proteins that act downstream of PI3-kinase in the VEGF/VPF signaling pathway (24Fujio Y. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16349-16354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 7 B, infected Ad-myrAkt increased the expression of IL-8 proteins in HBMECs compared with the control adenovirus. However, the NF-κB inhibitor PDTC (20 μm) potently inhibited Ad-myrAkt-induced IL-8 production in HBMECs (Fig. 7 B). Expression of phosphorylated Akt protein was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 7 C). These results indicate that VEGF/VPF induces IL-8 production in HBMECs through activation of the transcriptional factor NF-κB via PI3-kinase and calcium signaling pathways. IL-8 is a potent chemoattractant for neutrophils. To determine whether VEGF/VPF induced the production of functional IL-8, the supernatants were harvested from HBMECs treated with VEGF/VPF for 12 h and added to the lower compartment as described under “Experimental Procedures.” VEGF/VPF-treated supernatants significantly increased neutrophil migration across an HBMEC monolayer compared with untreated samples (Fig. 8 A). To test specifically the role of IL-8 in migration, 20 μg/ml human IL-8-specific goat antibody was added to the VEGF/VPF-treated supernatants for 1 h before the assay was initiated. The results demonstrated that anti-IL-8 antibody blocked the neutrophil migration across the HBMEC monolayer which was induced by the VEGF/VPF-treated supernatant, thereby indicating that VEGF/VPF induced functional IL-8 protein in HBMECs. In addition, we examined the amount of IL-8 in these VEGF/VPF-treated supernatants using ELISA and compared its functional activity with that of human recombinant IL-8. The sample contained ∼3 ng/ml IL-8, and the transendothelial migration of neutrophils induced by this sample was comparable with that induced by human recombinant IL-8 (Fig. 8 B). Thus, the secreted IL-8 in HBMECs treated with VEGF/VPF was functionally active. In this study, we examined the role of VEGF/VPF in chemokine expression in HBMECs. We used a cytokine cDNA array containing 34 chemokines and 14 receptors. This array is an excellent tool to identify chemokines expressed differentially in response to external stimuli. By using the cytokine cDNA array, we observed that VEGF/VPF significantly increased MCP-1 and CXCR4 expression in HBMECs similar to that described in other endothelial cells (20Marumo T. Schini-Kerth V.B. Busse R. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1131-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 21Salcedo R. Wasserman K. Young H.A. Grimm M.C. Howard O.M. Anver M.R. Kleinman H.K. Murphy W.J. Oppenheim J.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 1125-1135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Interestingly, VEGF/VPF also induced IL-8 production at the transcriptional level, and IL-8 mRNA expression was induced in a rapid and transient manner (Fig. 3). Furthermore, VEGF/VPF increased IL-8 protein production by as early as 3 h, and this increase was sustained for up to 32 h (Fig. 4). In addition, the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide significantly inhibited IL-8 synthesis (Fig. 6), indicating that VEGF/VPF regulates IL-8 expression. We also examined whether bFGF induces increased IL-8 production in HBMECs. bFGF has been shown to induce neovascularization like VEGF/VPF, but it does not induce vascular permeability (32Friesel R.E. Maciag T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 919-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Within 12 h of bFGF treatment, we observed no increase in IL-8 protein expression in the samples compared with the untreated controls. However, after 12 h of bFGF treatment, the amount of IL-8 protein in these samples was greater than that in the untreated controls, although it was much smaller than in the VEGF/VPF-treated samples (Fig. 4). Thus, bFGF induced IL-8 production in the later time periods compared with VEGF/VPF. However, IL-8 has been shown to be secreted rapidly in endothelial cells upon treatment with various stimuli (33Strieter R.M. Kunkel S.L. Showell H.J. Remick D.G. Phan S.H. Ward P.A. Marks R.M. Science. 1989; 243: 1467-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar, 34Qi J. Goralnick S. Kreutzer D.L. Blood. 1997; 90: 3595-3602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, bFGF might induce IL-8 production in HBMECs via another mechanism such as up-regulation of the IL-8 inducer. Based on our data and a previous report showing that bFGF induces VEGF/VPF expression in vascular endothelial cells through autocrine and paracrine mechanisms (35Seghezzi G. Patel S. Ren C.J. Gualandris A. Pintucci G. Robbins E.S. Shapiro R.L. Galloway A.C. Rifkin D.B. Mignatti P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1659-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar), we suggest that bFGF might induce IL-8 production in HBMECs via the up-regulation of VEGF/VPF. VEGF/VPF is involved in intracellular signaling mediated by ERK, PI3-kinase, protein kinase C, calcium, and NF-κB in endothelial cells. We observed that the intracellular calcium chelator TMB-8, the NF-κB inhibitor PDTC, and the PI3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 significantly blocked IL-8 production in HBMECs stimulated by VEGF/VPF. The transcriptional factor NF-κB has been shown to induce IL-8 expression in endothelial cells upon treatment with various stimuli, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (28Munoz C. Pascual-Salcedo D. Castellanos M.C. Alfranca A. Aragones J. Vara A. Redondo M.J. de Landazuri M.O. Blood. 1996; 88: 3482-3490Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Yoshida S. Ono M. Shono T. Izumi H. Ishibashi T. Suzuki H. Kuwano M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4015-4023Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Also, the intracellular calcium chelator TMB-8 has been shown to inhibit the activation of NF-κB (30Kurose I. Saito H. Miura S. Ebinuma H. Higuchi H. Watanabe N. Zeki S. Nakamura T. Takaishi M. Ishii H. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 867-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 31Gong G. Waris G. Tanveer R. Siddiqui A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9599-9604Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that the PI3-kinase pathway may mediate VEGF/VPF-induced IL-8 production in HBMECs through NF-κB activation. Indeed, when HBMECs were infected with an adenovirus encoding constitutively active Akt, the increased expression of IL-8 protein in HBMECs was observed, whereas the NF-κB inhibitor PDTC potently blocked this IL-8 protein synthesis induced by activated Akt. These data indicate that VEGF/VPF induces IL-8 synthesis in HBMECs through activation of the transcriptional factor NF-κB via PI3-kinase and calcium signaling pathways. However, the MEK inhibitor PD98059 had no effect on IL-8 production in HBMECs stimulated by VEGF/VPF. These results also indicate that the ERK pathway did not mediate IL-8 production in HBMECs and are comparable with the results for bFGF, a potent inducer of the ERK pathway in endothelial cells (32Friesel R.E. Maciag T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 919-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), which failed to induce IL-8 within 12 h of treatment. IL-8 belongs to the CXC chemokine family and is a potent chemoattractant for neutrophils and T lymphocytes, but not monocytes. In humans, it was reported that intradermal injection of IL-8 induced the perivascular infiltration of neutrophils within 1 h, which was sustained for several hours (36Swensson O. Schubert C. Christophers E. Schroder J.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1991; 96: 682-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). IL-8 has been shown to be produced in a variety of cell types including monocytes and endothelial cells by stimuli such as the inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β (22Rollins B.J. Blood. 1997; 90: 909-928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Strieter R.M. Kunkel S.L. Showell H.J. Remick D.G. Phan S.H. Ward P.A. Marks R.M. Science. 1989; 243: 1467-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). In particular, activated endothelial cells are a source of a number of chemotactic molecules including IL-8. Enhanced chemotactic molecules in the endothelium elicit the movement of leukocytes from blood into tissues, a characteristic feature of inflammation. Our data suggest that VEGF/VPF can mediate leukocyte infiltration in endothelial cells through the up-regulation of chemokines, including IL-8, because supernatants of VEGF/VPF-treated HBMECs significantly increased neutrophil migration across an HBMEC monolayer compared with the untreated control, and that anti-IL-8 antibody blocked this migration (Fig.8 A). Hypoxia is a strong inducer of VEGF/VPF expression. Hypoxia, an important factor in the pathophysiology of vascular and inflammatory diseases, contributes to leukocyte infiltration through the up-regulation of adhesion molecules and chemokine release (2Stanimirovic D. Satoh K. Brain Pathol. 2000; 10: 113-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 3Bona E. Andersson A.L. Blomgren K. Gilland E. Puka-Sundvall M. Gustafson K. Hagberg H. Pediatr. Res. 1999; 45: 500-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). During systemic hypoxia in vivo, VEGF/VPF was shown to be expressed in glial cells as well as in neurons in the hippocampus and dentate gyrus (37Marti H.H. Risau W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15809-15814Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). However, VEGF/VPF expression does not appear to be localized in endothelial cells, although marked receptor expression was noted, thus suggesting that a paracrine action is involved in this condition (37Marti H.H. Risau W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15809-15814Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Therefore, our data suggest that hypoxia might at least in part contribute to leukocyte infiltration through the up-regulation of VEGF/VPF, which in turn induces the secretion of chemokines such as IL-8 in endothelium through a paracrine mode. Recently, we and others reported that VEGF/VPF up-regulated intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), the receptor for neutrophil adhesion molecules CD11/CD18 (MAC-1), in rat brain microvascular endothelial cells (38Radisavljevic Z. Avraham H. Avraham S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20770-20774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (39Kim I. Moon S.O. Kim S.H. Kim H.J. Koh Y.S. Koh G.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7614-7620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). Taken together with these studies, we suggest that VEGF/VPF might be responsible for the accumulation of neutrophils within hypoxic areas through the simultaneous up-regulation of IL-8 and its receptor ICAM-1 in endothelium. In conclusion, this is the first report that VEGF/VPF induces IL-8 expression in human brain microvascular endothelial cells. We therefore suggest that VEGF/VPF contributes to leukocyte infiltration through the up-regulation of chemokines in endothelial cells.

https://openalex.org/W2014281402,"Extracorporeal shock wave (ESW) is an alternative non-invasive method for the promotion of bone growth and tendon repair. In an animal model, we have reported that ESW promoted bone marrow osteoprogenitor growth through transforming growth factor-β1 induction. We have further explored the mechanism for the ESW promotion of osteogenesis. Results showed that an optimal ESW treatment at 0.16 mJ/mm2 for 500 impulses rapidly induced a higher O2− and ONOO− production associated with a decrease of nitric oxide level in 1 h, and induced a higher transforming growth factor-β1 production in 24 h, and a higher colony-forming units-osteoprogenitor formation in 12 days. The colony-forming units-osteoprogenitor colonies revealed positive staining of bone alkaline phosphatase and turned into bone nodules in 21 days. Early scavenging of O2− but not Ca2+, H2O2, or prostaglandin E2 suppressed osteoprogenitor cell growth and maturation. Scavenging of O2− by superoxide dismutase raised the nitric oxide level back to the basal level and suppressed ESW-promoted osteoprogenitor cell growth, whereas inhibition of ONOO− by urate or NO by N-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester did not affect ESW promotion of osteogenesis, indicating that O2− acted as an early signal for ESW-induced cell growth. Further studies demonstrated that ESW induced ERK activation, and blockage of O2− production or inhibition of tyrosine kinase, but not protein kinase A and C inhibitors, suppressed ESW-induced ERK activation. In support that O2− mediated the ESW-induced ERK activation and osteogenic differentiation, we further demonstrated that scavenging of O2− by superoxide dismutase and inhibition of ERK activation by PD98059 decreased specific osteogenic transcription factor, core binding factor A1 activation, and decreased osteocalcin expression. Taken together, we showed that ESW-induced O2− production followed by tyrosine kinase-mediated ERK activation and core binding factor A1 activation resulted in osteogenic cell growth and maturation. Thus, an appropriate modulation of redox reaction by ESW may have some positive effect on the bone regeneration.

It is not known whether superoxide can regulate osteoprogenitor cell growth and differentiation.

The acoustic waves are focused on a semi-ellipsoid reflector and therefore can be transmitted into a specific tissue site (13.Ligeman J.E. Nephron. 1996; 16: 487-498Google Scholar). ESW treatment has been divergently applied for eukaryotic and prokaryotic biology systems. It is well known that ESW provides a non-invasive biophysical strategy for breaking renal stones with minimal side effects (13.Ligeman J.E. Nephron. 1996; 16: 487-498Google Scholar). Evidence also suggests that shock waves can potentially enhance gene transfer (14.Lauer U. Burgelt E. Squire Z. Messmer K. Hofschneider P.H. Greogor M. Delius M. Gene Ther. 1997; 4: 710-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), suppress tumor growth (15.Delius M. Adams G.

Trauma. 1999; 47: 946-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) have shown that ESW treatment has a promising effect on the promotion of bone fracture healing and repair of tendinitis. The mechanism by which ESW enhances fracture healing and repair of tendinitis remains to be determined. The fact that ESW treatment enhances both bone and tendon regeneration suggests that ESW may induce a certain signal for growth and maturation of the mesenchymal progenitors from bone marrow. It has been well clarified that the differentiation and maturation of bone marrow mesenchymal osteoprogenitor cells into osteoblastic lineage is involved in bone regeneration (21.Liu P. Oyajobi B.O. Russell R.G. Scutt A. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1999; 65: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 22.Yoo J.U. Barthel T.S. Nishimura K. Solchaga L. Calpan A.I. Goldberg V.M. Johnstone B. J.

In support of the hypothesis, we have recently shown ESW treatment to be able to promote bone marrow stromal cell growth and differentiation toward osteogenic lineage, presumably through TGF-β1 induction (24.Wang, F. S., Yang, K. D., Wang, C. J., Sheen-Chen, S. M., and Chen, R. F. (2002) @@[email protected]@J. Bone Jt. Surg.,@@/[email protected]@ in pressGoogle Scholar). Accumulated evidence suggests that ESW induces a cavitation effect to increase membrane permeability and the influx of biological substances (25.Zhong P. Lin H. Xi X. Zhu S. Bhogte E.S. J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 1999; 105: 1997-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 26.Huber P. Debus J. Jochle K. Simiantonakis I. Jenne J. Rastert R. Spoo J. Lorenz W.J. Wannenmacher M. Phys. Med.

Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5227-5232PubMed Google Scholar,27.Gambihler S. Delius M. Brendel W. Ultrasound Med. Biol. 1990; 16: 587-594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). There is limited evidence showing that ESW promotes cell growth rather than cell damage. We hypothesized in this study that an optimal ESW treatment promoted osteoprogenitor cell growth and maturation via a rapid induction of oxygen radicals for a signal transduction from ERK to specific osteogenic transcription factor activation, followed by osteogenesis. Thus, we have sought to investigate which species of oxygen radicals could be induced by ESW treatment, how early the oxygen radicals transmitted the signal cascade, when the growth factor TGF-β1 was induced, and when the growth and osteogenic maturation was reached. Three-month-old Sprague-Dawley rats (National Experimental Animals Production Center, Taipei, Taiwan) were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium (50 mg/kg; Nembutal® sodium, Abbott). Each rat was placed in supine position with four limbs abducent fixation. The ESW treatment with 0, 250, 500, and 1000 impulses at 0.16 mJ/mm2 (Ossatron®; HMT High Medical Technologies GmbH, Kreuzlingen, Switzerland) was applied to the left distal femur 10 mm above the knee joint as in our previous study (24.Wang, F. S., Yang, K. D., Wang, C. J., Sheen-Chen, S. M., and Chen, R. F. (2002) @@[email protected]@J. Bone Jt. Surg.,@@/[email protected]@ in pressGoogle Scholar). After ESW treatment for 1 h, bone marrow cells were harvested from the bone marrow of femurs with ESW treatment. Bone marrow cells from the femurs without ESW treatment were run as controls. The distal end of the femur bone was excised at the level of 5 mm above the knee joint. Bone marrow blood (0.4 ml) was aspirated with 20-gauge needle into a 1-ml syringe containing 20 units/ml heparin. The bone marrow mononuclear cells in the marrow blood were harvested from the interface of the Ficoll-Paque density gradient (d = 1.007 g/ml, Amersham Biosciences AB) at 500 × g for 30 min as described previously (28.Yang K.D. Chao C.Y. Shaio M.F. Acta Haematol. (Basel). 1998; 99: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Cell number and viability were determined with a hemocytometer after staining with 0.4% trypan blue in ammonium chloride. Culture of the osteoprogenitors from bone marrow mononuclear cells (2 × 105 cells/well; 24-well plate) was raised in osteogenic medium containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM; Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 10−8mdexamethasone, 50 μg/ml l-ascorbic acid, and 10−2m β-glycerophosphate (Sigma). After washing out nonadherent hematopoietic cells, total stromal cells were cultured for 12 days at 5% CO2 and incubated at 37 °C. The cultured supernatant was harvested and replaced with fresh osteogenic medium every 3 days. Colony-forming unit-osteoprogenitor (CFU-O) in bone marrow stromal cell culture was assessed as described previously (29.Aubin J.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 72: 396-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). After incubation and removal of medium, the cell culture in each well was fixed with citrate/acetone/formaldehyde and subjected to bone alkaline phosphatase staining according to the instructions for the use of Sigma alkaline phosphatase histocytochemistry assay kit (Sigma). Total colonies found to have more than 32 segregate cells were recognized and calculated as positive bone alkaline phosphatase staining. The cells (1 × 104 cells/well; 96-well plate) from CFU-O colonies were subjected to determination of the osteoblastic lineage with bone alkaline phosphatase activity (30.Lennon D.P. Haynesworth S.E. Young R.G. Dennis J.E. Calpan A.I. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 219: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The reactions were incubated with 0.2 ml of substrate buffer containing 50 mmglycine, 1 mm magnesium chloride, pH 10.5, and 2.5 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma) at 37 °C for 30 min and stopped with 0.1 ml of 1 n sodium hydroxide. Results were read at A405 nm by a microplate reader (Dyn-Ex Technologies Inc.). Alkaline phosphatase activity was expressed as μm p-nitrophenol/well (31.Cassiede P. Dennis J.D. Ma F. Calpan A.I. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 1264-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). To confirm further the osteogenic formation, we also prolonged the primary osteoprogenitor cell culture to 21 days. The long term cultured CFU-O colonies were fixed with neutral buffered formaldehyde for 5 min, pH 7.4, rinsed with distilled water, and then stained using the von Kossa method with 0.3 ml of 5% freshly prepared silver nitrate. After this procedure, the size of bone nodules ≥2 mm2 showing positive von Kossa staining were counted under an inverted microscope as described previously (32.Bellows C.G. Aubin J.E. Heersche J.N.M. Endocrinology. 1987; 121: 1985-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Rat bone marrow stromal cells harvested from rat femurs were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS. After washing out nonadherent hematopoietic cells, total stromal cells were cultured for 5 days in a 5% CO2, 37 °C incubator into log phase growth before harvest. To study the role of Ca2+ in ESW-promoted cell growth, cells (1 × 106 cells/ml) were treated with the extracellular Ca2+ chelator, 1 mm EGTA, or the intracellular Ca2+ chelator, 40 μm BAPTA (Sigma), for 30 min. To study the role of superoxide or hydrogen peroxide in the ESW-promoted cell growth, cells were treated for 30 min with 500 units/ml SOD or catalase (Sigma) to scavenge superoxide and hydrogen peroxide (33.Yang K.D. Chen M.Z. Teng R.J. Yang M.Y. Liu H.C. Chen R.F. Hsu T.Y. Shaio M.F. Pediatr. Res. 2000; 48: 829-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To elucidate whether prostaglandin E2 was involved in the ESW-enhanced cell growth, cells were treated with 10 μm indomethacin to suppress PGE2 production by inhibiting cyclooxygenase-2 activity (34.Zaman G. Suswillo R.F. Cheng M.Z. Tavares I.A. Lanyon L.E. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 769-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In studies of the ESW-induced signal transduction of cell growth, cells were treated with 20 μm PD98059, a MEK inhibitor (Calbiochem), 50 μm calphostain C, a protein kinase A inhibitor, 100 μm (Rp)-cAMP, a protein kinase C inhibitor, and 20 μm genistein (Sigma), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (35.Aikawa R. Komuro I. Yamazaki T. Zou Y. Kudoh S. Tanaka M. Shiojima I. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 1813-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar), for 60 min before studies. After these treatments, cells were washed and resuspended with PBS. Cell suspensions were subjected to ESW treatment with modification as described previously (36.Wang F.S. Wang C.J. Huang H.J. Chung H. Chen R.F. Yang K.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 648-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (1 × 106 cells/ml) were suspended in a 5-ml polystyrene round-bottom tube (Falcon®, Becton Dickinson) containing 5 ml of PBS at pH 7.4 and exposed to ESW at 0.16 mJ/mm2 for 500 impulses. The duration of ESW treatment took 10 min. After ESW treatment, cells were cultured for 1 h and 2 days as indicated in the cell proliferation and Western blot assays. In some experiments, cells (1 × 105 cell/well, 24-well plate) were cultured in osteogenic medium for 12 and 21 days in order to elucidate the osteoprogenitor maturation as demonstrated by osteocalcin expression and bone nodule formation. Cultured medium was harvested and replaced with fresh medium every 3 days. The long term cell cultures in each well were subjected to Western blot assay of osteocalcin production and von Kossa staining of bone nodule formations. To detect kinetic change of superoxide production, ESW-treated cells (1 × 105 cells/well, 96-well plate) were incubated with phenol red-free DMEM for 1, 6, 24, and 48 h. After incubation, each well was added with 50 μm horse heart cytochrome c (Sigma) and followed by incubation in the dark at 37 °C for 1 h. The O2− production was determined by the difference of cytochrome creduction in the absence and presence of SOD. The cytochrome c reduction was monitored at A550 nm, and O2− concentration was calculated from the molar extinction coefficient of 0.0282 μm−1 cm−1 to calculate O2− production (33.Yang K.D. Chen M.Z. Teng R.J. Yang M.Y. Liu H.C. Chen R.F. Hsu T.Y. Shaio M.F. Pediatr. Res. 2000; 48: 829-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To elucidate whether O2− was an early or late signal for ESW promotion of bone marrow stromal cell growth, cells in each well were added with 500 units/ml SOD or vehicle (PBS) for 30 min at 0, 6, and 24 h after ESW treatment and subjected to O2− production assay. To elucidate whether O2− was an early or late signal for ESW promotion of TGF-β1 induction and bone marrow stromal cell growth, cells in each well were treated with 500 units/ml SOD or vehicle for 30 min at 0, 6, and 24 h after ESW treatment. The supernatant of the reactions was harvested for TGF-β1 production in 1 day, and the cells were subjected to the cell proliferation assay in 2 days. The changes of O2− production were correlated to the stromal cell growth, TGF-β1 production, and bone nodule formations as well as signal transduction as described below. To elucidate the role of NO or ONOO− in the ESW-promoted cell growth, cells were treated for 30 min with and without 100 μm urate or 100 μml-NAME (Sigma) to inhibit ONOO− or NO production (37.Hikiji H. Shin W.S. Koizumi T. Takato T. Susami T. Koizumi Y. Okai-Matsuo Y. Toyo-Oka T. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: E1031-E1037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38.Smalt R. Mitchel F.T. Howard R.L. Chambers T.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: E751-E758PubMed Google Scholar). After washing and resuspension in PBS, cells were subjected to ESW treatment. ESW-treated cells (1 × 105 cells/well, 96-well plate) were incubated with phenol red-free DMEM for 1 h. Cultured supernatant was harvested for assessment of NO production. Cells were collected for determination of nitrotyrosine, a marker for ONOO− formation. In some experiments, the supernatants of the reactions were harvested for TGF-β1 production in 1 day, and the cells were subjected to von Kossa assay in 21 days. We measured nitrite and nitrate levels to reflect NO production as described previously (39.Schulz K. Kerber S. Kelm M. Nitric Oxide. 1999; 3: 225-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Briefly, the culture supernatants were determined in triplicate by injecting the 50-μl aliquot into a custom impinger with a Teflon-linked septum containing 0.4 m vanadium chloride in glacial acetic acid. The vanadium chloride reduced nitrate and nitrite to NO gas, which passed into a stream of helium and entered the nitrogen oxide analyzer (NOA280; Sievers Inc., Denver, CO) as described previously (39.Schulz K. Kerber S. Kelm M. Nitric Oxide. 1999; 3: 225-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The nitrite and nitrate levels in each sample were determined by interpolation calculated from a series of well known potassium nitrate concentrations. Protein concentration in each sample was measured by a Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Results were normalized with protein concentration in each sample. To investigate the interaction of O2− and NO, we measured the nitrotyrosine level, which is a marker for ONOO−formation, as described previously (40.Oyama J.I. Shimokawa H. Momii H. Chen X. Fukuyama N. Arai Y. Egashira K. Nakazawa H. Takeshita A. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 2207-2214Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The nitrotyrosine levels in each sample were determined by high performance liquid chromatography (LC-10AD, Shimadze, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a reverse phase column (4.6 mm internal diameter × 250 mm length; TSK-gel, ODS-80TM). The column was eluted with 50 mmNaH2PO3·H3PO4 (pH 2.5) with methanol (60:40, v/v) at a flow rate of 2 ml/min through an isocratic pump. The peaks were measured with an electrochemical detector (Coulochem II, Bedford, MA) at a guard cell potential of −250 mV. The nitrotyrosine concentration in each sample was integrated from the retention time and area under the eluting peak. The exact concentration was determined by an interpolation calculated from a series of well known standard concentrations of 3-nitrotyrosine (Calbiochem). Results were normalized with protein concentration in each sample (40.Oyama J.I. Shimokawa H. Momii H. Chen X. Fukuyama N. Arai Y. Egashira K. Nakazawa H. Takeshita A. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 2207-2214Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The cultured supernatants were harvested for measurement of TGF-β1 by centrifuging at 500 × g for 5 min and then stored at −70 °C until studied. The TGF-β1 production was determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Quantikine®, R & D Systems Inc.). Briefly, acid-activated culture supernatants (0.2 ml) were added to each polystyrene microwell pre-coated with recombinant human TGF-β-soluble receptor type II for 3 h. The reactions were next incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated TGF-β1 polyclonal antibody for 1.5 h. After washing, the reactions were incubated with substrate solution containing 0.1 ml of stabilized hydrogen peroxide and 0.1 ml of stabilized tetramethylbenzidine for 30 min. The reaction was stopped with 0.05 ml of 2 n sulfuric acid. Data were read at A450 nm with a microplate reader. Results were calculated by an interpolation from a standard curve made by a series of TGF-β1 concentrations. Bone marrow stromal cell proliferation was determined by nuclear [3H]thymidine uptake as modified from a measurement of osteoblast proliferation described previously (36.Wang F.S. Wang C.J. Huang H.J. Chung H. Chen R.F. Yang K.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 648-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Bone marrow stromal cells with and without ESW treatment (2 × 104cells/well, 96-well plate) were cultured for 24 h before the addition of 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine/well (Amersham Biosciences AB) for an additional 24-h culture. At the end of the culture period, cells in each culture well were released from the plates by trypsinization and processed for [3H]thymidine uptake determination by a liquid scintillation analyzer (Tri-Crab 2100TR, Packard Instrument Co.). Bone marrow stromal cells were lysed with 200 μl of ice-cold buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.7% Nonidet P-40 on ice for 10 min and centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min. The cytosolic extracts were harvested to measure ERK activation. The nuclear pellets were further lysed with buffer containing 40 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 350 mm NaCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 20% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μm dithiothreitol, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin on ice for 20 min and harvested to determine osteogenic transcription factor and core binding factor A1 (CBFA1) activation by centrifugation at 12,000 × g, 4 °C, for 10 min. Protein concentrations in cytosolic and nuclear extracts were determined by Bio-Rad assay kit (Bio-Rad). The cytosolic extracts were incubated with anti-ERK antibody (1:100; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) for 1 h at 4 °C. After incubation, the immune complexes were precipitated with protein A (Sigma). The immunoprecipitate (20 μg) was reacted with the substrate buffer containing 20 μg of myelin basic protein (MBP), 15 mm MgCl2, 100 μm ATP, and 5 μm protein kinase inhibitor for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped with the Laemmli buffer containing 200 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 4% SDS, 50 μm dithiothreitol, and 0.05% bromphenol blue for 5 min at 95 °C. The mixtures were subject to Western blot assay. The phosphorylated MBP on the blot was recognized by a specific mouse anti-phospho-MBP (1:1000) antibody, followed by goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG (1:3000) as the second antibody. The ERK activity was reflected on the phosphorylated MBP visualized with chemiluminescence agents. The nuclear extracts were incubated with anti-CBFA1 antibody (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at 4 °C. After incubation, the immune complexes were precipitated with protein A (Sigma). The immunoprecipitate (20 μg) was mixed with Laemmli buffer for 5 min at 95 °C. The mixtures were subject to Western blot assay. The total CBFA1 on the blot was recognized by a rabbit anti-CBFA1 antibody at 1:500 dilution, followed by goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG (1:2000) as the second antibody. The phosphorylated CBFA1 on the blot was further recognized by a specific mouse anti-phosphotyrosine (1:1000) antibody, followed by goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG (1:2000) as the second antibody. The CBFA1 activity was reflected on the phosphorylated CBFA1 visualized with chemiluminescence agents. To confirm ESW promotion of osteoprogenitor maturation, cytosolic extracts were subjected to determination of osteocalcin production with immunoblot assay. The osteocalcin on the blot was recognized by a specific mouse anti-osteocalcin (1:500) antibody, followed by goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG (1:3000) as the second antibody. The osteogenic activity was reflected on the osteocalcin expression visualized with chemiluminescence agents. Data were analyzed with a non-parametric one-way analysis of variance followed by Student's t test to determine significance between treatments. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Certain doses of ESW treatments applied to rat femoral bone promoted the CFU-O formation of bone marrow stromal cells. As shown in Fig. 1, the ESW treatment with 0.16 mJ/mm2 for 250 impulses minimally enhanced CFU-O formation, and the treatment for 500 impulses had the best effect. However, the treatment with 1000 impulses brought about a suppressing effect. The CFU-O colonies were confirmed to be osteoblastic lineage, as demonstrated by an increase in alkaline phosphatase activity in the cells from CFU-O colonies (Fig. 2A). The cells from the CFU-O colonies matured into bone nodules after a 21-day long term culture as shown in Fig. 2B. The bone nodule formations were significantly higher in the ESW treatment with 500 impulses than those without ESW treatment (Fig. 2B).Figure 2ESW promoted bone growth as determined by alkaline phosphatase activity and bone nodule formations.

https://openalex.org/W2054240817,"Fine regulation of water reabsorption by the antidiuretic hormone [8-arginine]vasopressin (AVP) occurs in principal cells of the collecting duct and is largely dependent on regulation of the aquaporin-2 (AQP2) water channel. AVP-inducible long term AQP2 expression was investigated in immortalized mouse cortical collecting duct principal cells. Combined RNase protection assay, Western blot, and immunofluorescence analyses revealed that physiological concentrations of AVP added to the basal side, but not to the apical side, of cells grown on filters induced both AQP2 mRNA and apical protein expression. The stimulatory effect of AVP on AQP2 expression followed a V2receptor-dependent pathway because [deamino-8-d-arginine]vasopressin (dDAVP), a specific V2 receptor agonist, produced the same effect as AVP, whereas the V2 antagonist SR121463B antagonized action of both AVP and dDAVP. Moreover, forskolin and cyclic 8-bromo-AMP fully reproduced the effects of AVP on AQP2 expression. Analysis of protein degradation pathways showed that inhibition of proteasomal activity prevented synthesis of AVP-inducible AQP2 mRNA and protein. Once synthesized, AQP2 protein was quickly degraded, a process that involves both the proteasomal and lysosomal pathways. This is the first study that delineates induction and degradation mechanisms of AQP2 endogenously expressed by a renal collecting duct principal cell line.

Analysis of protein degradation pathways showed that inhibition of proteasomal activity prevented synthesis of AVP-inducible AQP2 mRNA and protein. Once synthesized, AQP2 protein was quickly degraded, a process that involves both the proteasomal and lysosomal pathways. This is the first study that delineates induction and degradation mechanisms of AQP2 endogenously expressed by a renal collecting duct principal cell line. collecting duct aquaporin [8-arginine]vasopressin [1-deamino,8-d-arginine]vasopressin mouse cortical collecting duct principal cell line RNase protection assay Kidneys are the major determinant of body water and electrolyte composition. Water reabsorption across the membranes of renal epithelial cells occurs through a complex process. Approximately 70 and 15% of the glomerular filtrate is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule and thin descending limb of Henle's loop, respectively. In contrast, the ascending limb of Henle's loop and the distal convoluted tubule are impermeable to water. These segments empty into the collecting duct (CD),1 the chief site where tight regulation of water reabsorption occurs. In this segment, and in the connecting tubule of some species as well (1Kishore B.K. Mandon B. Oza N.B. DiGiovanni S.R. Coleman R.A. Ostrowski N.L. Wade J.B. Knepper M.A. J. Clin.

J. Physiol. 1997; 272: F1-F12PubMed Google Scholar). Water movement across renal epithelial cells is facilitated by the presence of water channels of the aquaporin (AQP) protein family. Aquaporins exhibit a conserved homotetrameric organization, and the expression of different members of the aquaporin family is tissue-specific. AQP1 accounts for the transcellular selective water permeability of the proximal tubule and thin descending limb of Henle's loop (4Schnermann J. Chou C.-L. Ma T. Traynor T. Knepper M.A. Verkman A.S.

Marples D. Chin E. Ning G. Bondy C. Agree P. Nielsen S. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1997; 8: 1-14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Three aquaporins (AQP2, AQP3, and AQP4) are expressed in collecting duct principal cells where AVP regulates water reabsorption across the principal cell epithelium. AQP2 is located in subapical intracellular vesicles and in the apical plasma membrane (7Fushimi K. Uchida S. Hara Y. Hirata Y. Marumo F. Sasaki S.

Marples D. Knepper M.A. Nielsen S. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: F775-F785Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Of all aquaporins, AQP2 is the principal target of AVP. Acute increases in plasma AVP concentration leads to translocation of AQP2 from intracellular storage vesicles to the apical plasma membrane and results in increased CD water permeability (11Nielsen S. Chou C.-L. Marples D. Christensen E.I. Kishore B.K. Knepper M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1013-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). Sustained increases in plasma AVP levels raise expression levels of both AQP2 and AQP3 allowing maximal water permeability across renal CD (12Terris J. Ecelbarger C.A. Nielsen S. Knepper M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F414-F422PubMed Google Scholar). AVP exerts its effect by binding to V2 receptors located in the basolateral membrane of CD principal cells and inner medullary collecting duct cells, resulting in activation of the Gsα/adenylyl cyclase system (13Chabardes D. Firsov D. Aarab L. Clabecq A. Bellanger A.C. Siaume-Perez S. Elalouf J.M. J. Biol.

Mutations in either AQP2 or the V2 receptor are responsible for reduced expression levels of AQP2 of inherited forms of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (14Fujiwara T.M. Morgan K. Bichet D.G. Annu.

Prolonged infusion with AVP has been shown to increase the water permeability of renal CD in AVP-deficient Brattleboro rats, an effect that correlates well with increased levels of AQP2 mRNA and protein (16DiGiovanni S.R. Nielsen S. Christensen E.I. Knepper M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8984-8988Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Similarly, normal rats infused with AVP develop hyponatremia and exhibit increased AQP2 expression levels (17Saito T. Higashiyama M. Nagasaka S. Sasaki S. Saito T. Ishikawa S.-E.

AQP2 expression can also be increased under particular circumstances such as cardiac failure (18Xu D.L. Martin P.-Y. Ohara M. St. John J. Pattison T. Meng X. Morris K. Kim J.K. Schrier R.W. J. Clin.

These findings together with the identification of cAMP-responsive elements in the 5′-flanking region of the AQP2 gene (22Hozawa S. Holtzman E.J. Ausiello D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C1695-C1702Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggest that AVP increases the transcription rate of the AQP2 gene. Cultured kidney epithelial cells transfected with AQP2 cDNA have proven to be a valuable tool for the study of short term action of AVP on AQP2 expression (23Valenti G. Frigeri A. Ronco P.M.

Physiol. 1996; 270: F548-F553Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, they cannot be used for long term regulation studies that require intact cis- and trans-acting DNA domains. Attempts to characterize long term AQP2 expression in primary cultures of kidney epithelial cells have been hampered by the rapid down-regulation of endogenously expressed AQP2 (25Maric K. Oksche A. Rosenthal W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F796-F801PubMed Google Scholar), possibly because of the presence of negatively acting cis-elements present in theAQP2 gene (26Furuno M. Uchida S. Marumo F. Sasaki S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F854-F860PubMed Google Scholar). We have established previously a novel immortalized clonal collecting duct cell line, mpkCCDcl4, which was derived from microdissected cortical collecting ducts of an SVPK/Tag transgenic mouse (27Bens M. Vallet V. Cluzeaud F. Pascual-Letallec L. Kahn A. Rafestin-Oblin M.E. Rossier B.C. Vandewalle A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 923-934Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These mpkCCDcl4 cells exhibit many major functional properties of CD principal cells including electrogenic Na+ transport stimulated by aldosterone and AVP (27Bens M. Vallet V. Cluzeaud F.

In this study, we show that mpkCCDcl4 cells grown on permeable filters maintain AVP-inducible AQP2 expression and can be used as a cellular model to analyze the mechanisms that govern the long term effect of AVP on AQP2 expression. These cells produce large amounts of both AQP2 mRNA and protein in response to physiological concentrations of AVP. Synthesis of AQP2 mRNA was found to be dependent on the proteolytic activity of the proteasome. In addition, newly synthesized AQP2 protein was found to have a short half-life, and both proteasomal and lysosomal proteolytic pathways were found to participate in its degradation. Mouse mpkCCDC14 cells grown in modified DM medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12, 1:1 v/v; 60 nm sodium selenate; 5 μg/ml transferrin; 2 mm glutamine; 50 nm dexamethasone; 1 nm triiodothyronine; 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor; 5 μg/ml insulin; 20 mmd-glucose; 2% fetal calf serum; and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) (27Bens M. Vallet V. Cluzeaud F. Pascual-Letallec L. Kahn A. Rafestin-Oblin M.E. Rossier B.C. Vandewalle A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 923-934Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were used. All experiments were performed on confluent cells seeded on permeable filters (Transwell®,0.4-μm pore size, 1-cm2 growth area, Corning Costar, Cambridge, MA). Cells were grown in DM medium until confluent (day 6 after seeding) and then in DM containing no epidermal growth factor, hormones, or fetal calf serum for an additional 24 h before use. The medium was changed every 2 days, and all experiments were performed between the 20th and 35th passages. Strips of rat kidney cortex were excised and frozen in liquid nitrogen, ground to powder, and homogenized in 500 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl; 2 mm EGTA; 2 mm EDTA; 30 mm NaF; 30 mm Na4O7P2; 2 mm Na3VO4; 1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride; 10 μg/ml leupeptin; 4 μg/ml aprotinin; 1% Triton X-100; pH 7.4). After incubation in the absence or presence of AVP and/or drugs, confluent cultured mpkCCDC14 cells grown on filters or flasks were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and then homogenized in 150 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (see above). Protein concentrations were measured by the BCA protein assay (Pierce). Equal amounts of protein samples were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Bedford, MA). Membranes were blocked by incubation with Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl) containing 0.2% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 and 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk for 30 min at room temperature. Membranes were probed overnight at 4 °C with a polyclonal rabbit anti-rat AQP2 antibody (1:20,000) (18Xu D.L. Martin P.-Y. Ohara M. St. John J. Pattison T. Meng X. Morris K. Kim J.K. Schrier R.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1500-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) and then with secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:20,000) (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were washed three times with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.2% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and the antigen-antibody complexes were detected by the Super Signal Substrate method (Pierce). Identified protein bands were quantified using a video densitometer and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Confluent mpkCCDC14cells grown on filters were incubated in a serum- and hormone-deprived medium supplemented or not with 10−8m AVP for 24 h. Cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature, permeabilized with 0.25% tergitol (Nonidet P-40) for 10 min, and then rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline. Filters were detached from the holders and incubated with the rabbit polyclonal anti-rat AQP2 antibody (dilution 1:50) for 1 h at room temperature. After three rinses with phosphate-buffered saline, specimens were incubated with a CY3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (dilution 1:100) (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc., West Grove, PA) for 30 min at room temperature. Nuclei were counterstained with Sytox (dilution 1:500) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Specimen examined by confocal laser scanning microscopy (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) were viewed in the x-y and x-z planes, and the images were photographed. Mouse genomic DNA was extracted from mpkCCDC14 cells using the DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A mouse AQP2 cDNA (NCBI accession number NM_009699) fragment coding for the 81–279-nucleotide sequence was PCR-amplified using sense and antisense primers containing EcoRI and XbaI restriction sites, respectively, and cloned into pCIneo (Promega, Madison, WI). Computer-assisted alignment sequence analyses confirmed the specificity of the cDNA fragment used. The sequence of the PCR-amplified fragment was checked by sequencing. The plasmid was then linearized with NheI restriction enzyme, and 1 μg was used to produce antisense AQP2 transcripts (riboprobes) using T3 RNA polymerase in the presence of 50 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (Amersham Biosciences). A linearized pTRI RNA 18 S plasmid (Ambion, Austin, TX) was used to produce an 18 S rRNA antisense probe, used as an internal standard, which was transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of 5 μCi of [α-32P]UTP to avoid signal saturation due to the greater abundance of 18 S rRNA as compared with AQP2 rRNA. Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Four μg of riboprobe and 21 μg of yeast tRNA were used for hybridization with 2 × 105 cpm AQP2 probe and 5 × 104 cpm 18 S rRNA probe. Yeast tRNA (25 μg) was used as a negative control. Hybridization was performed for 60 min at 70 °C followed by RNase A/T1 mixture digestion (Ambion, Austin, TX) for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of SDS and proteinase K. RNA duplexes were extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol and precipitated with ammonium acetate/ethanol. Samples were then denatured in gel loading buffer at 95 °C for 5 min, run together with non-digested riboprobes on a 6% polyacrylamide sequencing gel, and autoradiographed. Identified fragments were quantified using a video densitometer and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The expression of AQP2 mRNA was analyzed by RNase protection assay (RPA) in confluent mpkCCDC14 cells. Cells grown on filters were incubated 9 h without or with 10−9m AVP and in the absence or presence of 2·10−6m actinomycin D. All agents were added to the basal medium. Protected fragments of expected size for the 18 S rRNA probe were visible in each tested condition at similar intensities (Fig.1 A, bottom panel) confirming that equal amounts of RNA were loaded to each lane. In untreated cells, a signal corresponding to protected fragments of the AQP2 mRNA probe could be detected but only after very long exposure times, indicating very low basal AQP2 mRNA expression levels (Fig.1 A, lane 1, top panel). The presence of AQP2 mRNA in untreated cells was nevertheless confirmed by reverse transcription-PCR analyses using specific primers for AQP2 (data not shown). Importantly, cells incubated 9 h in the presence of 10−9m AVP exhibited dramatically increased expression levels of AQP2 mRNA (Fig. 1 A, lane 2, top panel). Western blot analysis of rat kidney protein extract using a polyclonal anti-AQP2 antibody produced a narrow 28-kDa band and a more diffuse band of about 35 kDa that represented the non-glycosylated and glycosylated forms of AQP2, respectively (21Ohara M. Martin P.-Y. Xu D.-L. St. John J. Pattison T.A. Kim J.K. Schrier R.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1076-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B). An additional faint band of about 31 kDa that was endoglycosidase H-sensitive (data not shown) was also apparent and corresponds to core-glycosylated AQP2. As illustrated in Fig. 1, Western blot analysis of protein extracts obtained from the same batch of mpkCCDC14 cells used for RPA analysis revealed a coordinated expression between AQP2 mRNA and protein. Indeed, either no or, at best, only very faint bands of AQP2 protein were detected in protein extracts of unstimulated cells (Fig. 1 B, lane 1) indicating low basal expression levels of AQP2 protein. In sharp contrast, a strong AQP2 protein signal was observed when the basal medium was provided 9 h with 10−9mAVP (Fig. 1 B, lane 2). Furthermore, like AQP2 mRNA, the amount of AQP2 protein was greatly reduced when cells were simultaneously incubated 9 h with both 10−9m AVP and 2·10−6m actinomycin D (Fig. 1, A and B, lane 4). These results indicate that in mpkCCDC14 cells, AVP stimulates constitutive AQP2 protein expression that is dependent on AQP2 gene transcription. As analyzed by Western blotting, AVP added to the basal medium of mpkCCDC14 cells stimulated AQP2 expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.2, A and B). An increase in AQP2 protein expression was clearly detected in the presence of 10−10m AVP, and AQP2 protein expression sharply increased when greater concentrations of AVP were added to the cell medium. Half-maximal and maximal induction were achieved at 10−10 and 10−9m AVP, respectively. AVP-induced AQP2 expression was also found to be time-dependent (Fig. 2, C and D). AQP2 protein was first detected 3 h after addition of 10−9m AVP to the basal medium and gradually increased thereafter. For incubation times exceeding 24 h, the amount of AQP2 protein continued to increase, and by 72 h AQP2 protein expression was 2-fold greater than that observed after 24 h of AVP treatment (data not shown). In agreement with Western blot results (Fig. 1 B), immunofluorescence analysis of untreated confluent mpkCCDC14 cells grown on filters revealed almost no fluorescent signal (Fig. 3 A, panel A), whereas cells incubated 24 h with 10−8m AVP added to the basal medium exhibited intense AQP2 immunostaining (Fig. 3 A, panel B). Confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis of x-z planes revealed that most AQP2 immunostaining was detected at the apical pole of AVP-treated cells, whereas the basolateral pole remained unstained (Fig. 3 A, panel D). The observations made by confocal laser scanning microscopy suggest that the predominant apical localization of the AQP2 protein is conserved in mpkCCDC14 cells. We next determined whether these cells also retain a polarized expression of AVP receptors. Although a strong AQP2 protein signal was detected by Western blotting when 10−9m AVP was applied for 24 h to the basal medium (Fig. 3 B, lane 3), no specific bands corresponding to AQP2 were detected when cells were grown in the absence of AVP (lane 1), when AVP was added to the apical medium for 24 h (lane 2), or when cells were grown to confluency on a solid plastic support in the presence of 10−9m AVP for the same period (lane 4). These results indicate that AVP receptors are predominantly located in the basolateral membrane of mpkCCDC14 cells. In kidney collecting duct cells, AVP controls water permeability and AQP2 expression levels by binding to V2 receptors (34Promeneur D. Kwon T.-H. Frøkiær J. Knepper M.A. Nielsen S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: F370-F382PubMed Google Scholar), which causes an increase in cellular cAMP content (35Imbert M. Chabardes D. Montegut M. Clique A. Morel F. Pfluegers Arch. 1975; 357: 173-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We next determined whether AVP-induced AQP2 expression observed in mpkCCDC14 cells relies on AVP binding to basolateral V2 receptors. The strong AQP2 signal induced by incubating cells 9 h with 10−9m basal AVP was attenuated in the presence of 10−8m SR121463B (a generous gift of Dr. C. Serradeil-Le Gal, Sanofi Research, Toulouse, France), a non-peptidic, competitive, and specific V2receptor antagonist (36Serradeil-Le Gal C. Lacour C. Valette G. Garcia G. Foulon L. Galindo G. Bankir L. Pouzet B. Guillon G. Barberis C. Chicot D. Jard S. Vilain P. Garcia C. Marty E. Raufaste D. Brossard G. Nisato D. Maffrand J.-P. Le Fur G. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2729-2738Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 C, lanes 2 and3). On the other hand, basal addition of 10−9m [1-desamino-8-d-arginine]vasopressin (dDAVP), a preferential V2 receptor agonist, increased AQP2 cellular content as efficiently as 10−9m AVP (Fig. 3 C, lane 4). Similar to AVP-induced AQP2 expression, AQP2 expression induced by dDAVP was attenuated by simultaneous basal addition of SR121463B (lane 5). To establish further the involvement of V2 receptors in AVP-induced AQP2 expression, we assessed whether cAMP was able to mimic the AVP- or dDAVP-dependent increase of cellular AQP2 protein content by incubating cells 24 h with 5·10−6mforskolin or with 10−3 8-bromo-cyclic AMP (Fig.3 D). Compared with AVP alone, both of these compounds induced a similar rise in AQP2 protein levels (compare lane 4 to lanes 2 and 3), indicating that the action of AVP in mpkCCDC14 cells is mediated by cAMP. These results demonstrate, as observed in vivo, that AQP2 protein expression induced by AVP or dDAVP occurs via the occupancy of functional V2 receptors located in the basolateral membranes of mpkCCDC14 cells. Integral membrane proteins are mostly degraded through the lysosomal proteolytic pathway, but recent experimental evidence indicates that a subset of these proteins can also be degraded by the proteasome (37Hicke L. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 107-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). The results presented so far strongly suggest that AVP increases synthesis of the AQP2 protein by increasing AQP2 mRNA levels. The expression levels of cellular proteins, however, depend on protein synthesis and degradation rates. We therefore investigated the degradation pathways of AQP2 protein and their role in the control of AQP2 expression levels. The respective contribution of the proteasome and the lysosome in AQP2 degradation in mpkCCDC14 cells was analyzed by treating cells with specific inhibitors for each degradation pathway. Proteasomal activity was inhibited by adding 10−6m lactacystin or 10−6m MG132, two potent and specific inhibitors of the proteasomal pathway, to the cell medium. To analyze the contribution of the lysosome in AQP2 degradation, we used either 2·10−6m leupeptin, an inhibitor of cysteine proteases, or either 10−7m chloroquine or 10−2m methylamine, two weak bases that increase lysosomal pH and thereby inhibit the proteolytic activity of lysosomal enzymes. We first checked that these drugs had no cytotoxic effects by measuring the transepithelial electrical resistance of confluent mpkCCDC14 cells grown on filters (data not shown). None of the proteasomal or lysosomal inhibitors increased AQP2 expression when applied to the cell medium for 9–24 h in the absence of AVP, as revealed by Western blot analysis (data not shown). These results indicate that the very low AQP2 expression levels of cells grown in the absence of AVP are not due to an immediate degradation of constitutively synthesized AQP2 protein. The effects produced by the presence of proteasomal inhibitors on AQP2 expression led to contrasting results. Indeed, when cells were simultaneously incubated 9 h with both 10−6m lactacystin and 10−9m AVP, the AVP-induced expression of AQP2 protein was almost completely abolished (Fig. 4 A, compare lanes 2 and 3). Identical results were obtained with MG132, another structurally unrelated proteasome inhibitor (data not shown). To determine whether inhibition of proteasomal activity decreased AVP-induced AQP2 expression through a transcriptional or a translational mechanism, we measured the effect of lactacystin on AQP2 mRNA expression. Results from RPA analysis performed on the same batch of cells used for Western blot analysis clearly show that AQP2 mRNA expression induced by AVP was nearly abolished by lactacystin (Fig. 4 B, compare lanes 2 and 3). Taken together, these results reveal that the increased levels of AQP2 mRNA expression in response to AVP require the functional integrity of the proteasome. We investigated the role of the proteasome in AQP2 degradation by first incubating mpkCCDC14 cells 24 h with 10−9m AVP alone and then for an additional 9 h in the presence of 10−9m AVP added to the cell medium without or with 10−6m lactacystin. Results from Western blots performed under these experimental conditions showed that lactacys"

Although synaptophysin has been implicated in neurotransmitter release, and decreased synaptophysin levels have been associated with several neurodegenerative diseases, the molecular mechanism that regulates the degradation of synaptophysin remains unsolved. Using the cytoplasmic C terminus of synaptophysin as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified two synaptophysin-binding proteins, Siah-1A and Siah-2, which are rat homologues of Drosophila Seven in Absentia. We demonstrated that Siah-1A and Siah-2 associate with synaptophysin both in vitro and in vivo and defined the binding domains of synaptophysin and Siah that mediate their association. Siah proteins exist in both cytosolic and membrane-associated pools and co-localize with synaptophysin on synaptic vesicles and early endosomes. In addition, Siah proteins interact specifically with the brain-enriched E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UbcH8 and facilitate the ubiquitination of synaptophysin. Furthermore, overexpression of Siah proteins promotes the degradation of synaptophysin via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Our findings indicate that Siah proteins function as E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases to regulate the ubiquitination and degradation of synaptophysin.

In addition, recent studies suggest that synaptophysin also participates in the biogenesis and recycling of synaptic vesicles, perhaps via interactions with cholesterol and dynamin (13Daly C.

Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). During development, synaptophysin expression occurs early in neurogenesis and is greatly up-regulated during synaptogenesis (15Leclerc N. Beesley P.W. Brown I. Colonnier M. Gurd J.W. Paladino T. Hawkes R. J. Comp. Neurol. 1989; 280: 197-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 16Devoto S.H. Barnstable C.J. J. Comp.

Increases in synaptophysin expression have been found to correlate with long-term potentiation, suggesting that the regulation of synaptophysin expression may contribute to the mechanisms underlying learning and memory (18Lynch M.A. Voss K.L. Rodriguez J. Bliss T.V. Neuroscience. 1994; 60: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 19Mullany P. Lynch M.A. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 973-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Conversely, aberrant synaptophysin expression has been associated with several neurodegenerative diseases and psychiatric disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia (20Eastwood S.L. Harrison P.J. Neuroscience. 1995; 69: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 21Glantz L.A. Lewis D.A. Arch. Gen.

Lett. 1994; 174: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). In some cases, an alteration in the protein level of synaptophysin is observed without a concomitant change at the mRNA level (22Glantz L.A. Austin M.C. Lewis D.A. Biol. Psychiatry. 2000; 48: 389-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), implying that impaired post-translational regulation may contribute to abnormal synaptophysin expression. Although ample evidence has implicated a role for synaptophysin in neurotransmitter release, and altered synaptophysin expression has been linked to malfunctions of the nervous system, little is known about the mechanisms that regulate synaptophysin expression, particularly at the post-translational level. To identify proteins that regulate synaptophysin expression and/or function, we preformed a yeast two-hybrid screen in rat brain for proteins that interact with synaptophysin. The cytoplasmic tail of synaptophysin was used as bait, because its unique amino acid composition and structure suggests a possible role in protein-protein interaction (1Sudhof T.C. Lottspeich F. Greengard P. Mehl E. Jahn R. Science. 1987; 238: 1142-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). From this screen, we isolated two synaptophysin-binding proteins, Siah-1A and Siah-2, which are rat homologues of Drosophila Seven in Absentia(Sina).1 Sina was originally discovered as a RING finger-containing protein that is critically involved in the neuronal development of the R7 photoreceptor cell in Drosophila (25Carthew R.W. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1990; 63: 561-577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Sina functions downstream of the tyrosine kinase receptor Sevenless and Ras/Raf mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (26Dickson B. Sprenger F. Morrison D. Hafen E. Nature. 1992; 360: 600-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 27Fortini M.E. Simon M.A. Rubin G.M. Nature. 1992; 355: 559-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 28Neufeld T.P. Tang A.H. Rubin G.M. Genetics. 1998; 148: 277-286Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent evidence indicates that Sina, together with phyllopod, promotes the ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent degradation of tramtrack, a negative regulator of neuronal differentiation (29Li S. Li Y. Carthew R.W. Lai Z.C. Cell. 1997; 90: 469-478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 30Tang A.H. Neufeld T.P. Kwan E. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 459-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In mammals, there are three highly conserved Sina homologues, Siah-1A, Siah-1B, and Siah-2, which are abundantly expressed in the brain as well as other tissues (31Della N.G. Senior P.V. Bowtell D.D. Development. 1993; 117: 1333-1343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Holloway A.J. Della N.G. Fletcher C.F. Largespada D.A. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Bowtell D.D.

A. 1996; 93: 9039-9042Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Siah proteins have been reported to interact with two neuronal membrane proteins, DCC (deleted incolorectal cancer) and group 1-metabotropic glutamate receptors (35Hu G. Zhang S. Vidal M. Baer J.L. Xu T. Fearon E.R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2701-2714Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 36Ishikawa K. Nash S.R. Nishimune A. Neki A. Kaneko S. Nakanishi S. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 381-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Although it remains to be determined if Siahs regulate the degradation of metabotropic glutamate receptors, Siahs have been shown to regulate the degradation of DCC via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (35Hu G. Zhang S. Vidal M. Baer J.L. Xu T. Fearon E.R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2701-2714Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Deletion analysis reveals that the RING finger containing the N-terminal domain of Siah is required for proteolysis whereas the C terminus is involved in binding DCC (37Hu G. Fearon E.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 724-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Together, these studies suggest that Siah proteins may act to regulate neuronal development and function by mediating the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of a number of neuronal target proteins. In the current study, we have found that Siah proteins regulate the ubiquitination and degradation of synaptophysin by the proteasome pathway. Thus, Siah proteins may play an important role in the turnover of synaptic vesicle proteins as well as in neurodegenerative diseases where synaptophysin expression is altered. The bait plasmid, pPC97-SYPtail, was constructed by subcloning the cytoplasmic C-terminal tail (amino acids 218–307) of rat synaptophysin (38Sudhof T.C. Lottspeich F. Greengard P. Mehl E. Jahn R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 159607Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) into the pPC97 vector (39Chevray P.M. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1995; 378: 398-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). For the two-hybrid screen, the yeast strain CG-1945 (CLONTECH) was transformed sequentially with pPC97-SYPtail and a rat hippocampal/cortical two-hybrid cDNA library (40Li X.J. Li S.H. Sharp A.H. Nucifora Jr., F.C. Schilling G. Lanahan A. Worley P. Snyder S.H. Ross C.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 398-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar), using the lithium acetate method (41Chin L.S. Nugent R.D. Raynor M.C. Vavalle J.P. Li L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1191-1200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Positive clones were selected on 3-aminotriazole (5 mm, Sigma Chemical Co.)-containing medium lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine and verified with a filter assay for β-galactosidase activity. Prey plasmids were then recovered and retransformed into yeast with pPC97-SYPtail or controls to confirm the specificity of the interaction. The N-terminal sequences of rat Siah-1A and Siah-2 were cloned from rat brain Marathon-Ready cDNA using 5′-RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends, CLONTECH). All cDNAs were then sequenced multiple times on both strands, using an Applied Biosystems 373A DNA sequencer. The full-length rat Siah-1A, Siah-1A (C1), Siah-2 (C2), and Siah-2 deletion series (Siah-2 Δ1 through Siah-2 Δ5) were subcloned into a pGEX-5X-2 vector (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) to obtain GST fusion proteins. Synaptophysin tail (amino acids 218–307) and synaptophysin tail deletion series (Syp Δ1 through Syp Δ5) were subcloned into the expression vector pET32c (Novagen) to obtain S-tag synaptophysin fusion proteins. Fusion proteins were expressed in bacteria and purified as described previously (41Chin L.S. Nugent R.D. Raynor M.C. Vavalle J.P. Li L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1191-1200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins or GST control were immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) and incubated with rat brain homogenates or purified S-tag proteins for 2 h at 4 °C in 50 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 7.2) and 0.05% Triton X-100, as previously described (41Chin L.S. Nugent R.D. Raynor M.C. Vavalle J.P. Li L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1191-1200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The incubation mixtures were then pelleted and extensively washed with 50 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 7.2), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Triton X-100. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling in 2× Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with appropriate antibodies. Conventional molecular biological techniques were used to generate the following expression constructs: pcDNA3-synaptophysin and pcDNA3-myc-synaptophysin, which direct the expression of untagged and N-terminally myc-tagged full-length synaptophysin, respectively; pCHA-Siah-1A, which directs the expression of N-terminally HA-tagged full-length Siah-1A; pEGFP-Siah-1A and pEGFP-Siah-2-Δ2, which direct the expression of N-terminally GFP-tagged, full-length Siah-1A, and truncated Siah-2 (amino acids 224–325), respectively. Cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer. In experiments where the transient expression levels of synaptophysin were compared in the presence and absence of HA-Siah-1A, a luciferase reporter, pRSVL, was co-transfected as an internal control for transfection efficiency (41Chin L.S. Nugent R.D. Raynor M.C. Vavalle J.P. Li L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1191-1200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). An anti-Siah antibody was raised in chicken against the synthetic peptide CLTLHHTEKPEHEDI, corresponding to amino acids 147–160 of rat Siah-2. The N-terminal cysteine residue was added for the coupling purposes. The antibody was affinity-purified using the immunogen peptide coupled to a SulfoLink column (Pierce). Other antibodies used in this study include the following: anti-synaptophysin (SVP-38, Sigma), anti-HA (3F10, Roche Molecular Biochemicals; HA.11, Covance), anti-myc (9E10.3, Neomarkers), anti-EEA1 (Transduction Laboratories), anti-actin (C4, Roche Molecular Biochemicals); and secondary antibodies coupled with horseradish peroxidase, fluorescein, or Texas Red (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). Extracts were prepared from HeLa or CHO cells transiently transfected with indicated plasmids, and immunoprecipitation were preformed as described previously (42Chin L.-S. Raynor M.C. Wei X. Chen H. Li L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7069-7078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), using anti-HA antibody (3F10), anti-myc (9E10.3), anti-synaptophysin antibody (SVP-38), or control IgG. The immunocomplexes were recovered by incubation with protein G- or protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma). After extensive washes, the immunocomplexes were dissociated by boiling in the Laemmli sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. PC12 cells were grown on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips and differentiated with nerve growth factor (NGF, 100 ng/ml) for 48 h. CHO cells were transfected with pEGFP-Siah-1A alone or in combination with pcDNA3-synaptophysin. Cells were fixed for 10 min in 3.4% paraformaldehyde in 1× PBS and permeabilized for 30 min in 1× PBS plus 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% saponin prior to incubation with antibodies. The primary antibodies to synaptophysin, Siah or EEA1, were applied in 1× PBS plus 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% saponin for 1 h. Cells were incubated for 1 h with secondary antibodies conjugated to Texas Red. Coverslips were mounted in the Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Inc.) and then analyzed using a Leica TCS-NT confocal microscope with fluorescein isothiocyanate and Texas Red filters. The images were then processed using Adobe Photoshop 5.0 (Adobe Systems, Inc.). Separation of HA-Siah-1A-transfected CHO cells into cytosol fraction (50,000 ×g supernatant) and membrane fraction (50,000 ×g pellet) were preformed as previously described (41Chin L.S. Nugent R.D. Raynor M.C. Vavalle J.P. Li L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1191-1200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The membrane fractions were subjected to extraction studies as described (41Chin L.S. Nugent R.D. Raynor M.C. Vavalle J.P. Li L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1191-1200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), using 0.1 m NaHCO3 or 4 murea. PC12 cells or HeLa cells expressing Siah-1A and synaptophysin were incubated for 8 h at 37 °C with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (20 μm,Calbiochem), the cysteine protease inhibitor E64 (50 μm, Sigma), or vehicle (Me2SO, final concentration 0.1%). Cells were then lysed, and the protein concentrations of the lysates were determined by BCA protein assay (Pierce). An equal amount of protein from each lysate was then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. HeLa cells were co-transfected with pcDNA3-synaptophysin and either pCHA vector or pCHA-Siah-1A. Forty-eight hours later, the cells were washed and incubated for 30 min with Met/Cys-free DMEM. The medium was then replaced with Met/Cys-free DMEM containing 200 μCi of [35S]Met/Cys (1000 Ci/mmol) express protein labeling mix (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After incubation for 1 h, the radioactive medium was removed by extensive washes with non-radioactive DMEM. Cells were then incubated for chase intervals of 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, and 48 h in non-radioactive DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 5× the normal concentration of methionine and cysteine. Cells were lysed after appropriate chase time. An equal amount of protein from each lysate was immunoprecipitated using anti-synaptophysin antibody (SVP-38). Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The level of synaptophysin was quantified with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). CHO cells were transfected with combinations of the following plasmids: pcDNA3-myc3-synaptophysin, pEGFP-Siah-1A, pEGFP-Siah-1A ΔN, and pCHA-ubiquitin (43Treier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were incubated for 8 h with 20 μm MG132 (Calbiochem). The cells were then lysed, and an equal amount of protein from each lysate was immunoprecipitated using an anti-myc antibody (9E10.3). Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with an anti-HA antibody to detect synaptophysin-polyubiquitin conjugates. To identify proteins that interact with synaptophysin, we used the yeast two-hybrid system to screen a rat hippocampal/cortical cDNA library with the C-terminal 89 amino acids of synaptophysin as bait. Positive clones were rescued and confirmed by retransformation experiments demonstrating that these clones only interact with synaptophysin, but not with unrelated proteins such as SNAP-25 (data not shown). Out of 6.6 × 106 yeast transformants screened, we isolated 35 positive clones, of which three clones encode rat Siah-1A, whereas 32 clones encode rat Siah-2 (Fig. 1 A). Previously, three murine Siah proteins, Siah-1A, Siah-1B, and Siah-2, have been described (31Della N.G. Senior P.V. Bowtell D.D. Development. 1993; 117: 1333-1343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, only two human homologues, Siah-1A and Siah-2, have been identified, which share ∼78% amino acid identity with each other (31Della N.G. Senior P.V. Bowtell D.D. Development. 1993; 117: 1333-1343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Hu G. Chung Y.L. Glover T. Valentine V. Look A.T. Fearon E.R.

A. 1996; 93: 9039-9042Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Despite efforts by several different groups, no human cDNAs corresponding to murine Siah-1B could be detected (32Holloway A.J. Della N.G. Fletcher C.F. Largespada D.A. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Bowtell D.D. Genomics. 1997; 41: 160-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 33Hu G. Chung Y.L. Glover T. Valentine V. Look A.T. Fearon E.R. Genomics. 1997; 46: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Similarly, we could not detect rat cDNAs corresponding to murine Siah-1B by 5′-RACE and hybridization studies in the two-hybrid library and other rat cDNA libraries nor in the mRNA preparations. Together, these results suggest that Siah-1B may be a mouse-specific splice variant that does not exist in other species. The facts that Siah-1A and Siah-2 are the only positive synaptophysin-interacting clones and that they were isolated multiple times from the yeast two-hybrid screen suggest that the detected interaction between Siah proteins and synaptophysin may be physiologically relevant. Sina was originally identified as a protein that is required for R7 photoreceptor development in Drosophila (25Carthew R.W. Rubin G.M.

Data bank searches reveal the presence of Sina homologues in a number of organisms, including human, mouse, Caenorhabditis elegans,Xenopus, and Arabidopsis. The amino acid sequences of Sina/Siah proteins are extremely well conserved (31Della N.G. Senior P.V. Bowtell D.D. Development. 1993; 117: 1333-1343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Hu G. Chung Y.L.

For example, rat Siah proteins share ∼99 and 75% amino acid identity with human Siah proteins and Drosophila Sina, respectively (Fig. 1 B). Sina/Siah proteins all contain an N-terminal RING finger motif (C3HC4) followed by a conserved cysteine/histidine-rich region (C2HC3H2), which may represent a novel class of Zn2+-binding motifs (Fig. 1). RING finger motifs are cysteine/histidine-rich, Zn2+-binding domains that are thought to mediate protein-protein interactions (44Borden K.L. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 45Saurin A.J. Borden K.L. Boddy M.N. Freemont P.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 208-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that RING finger motifs may function in ubiquitination as ubiquitin ligases via interaction with ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (46Borden K.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 1103-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 47Joazeiro C.A. Weissman A.M. Cell. 2000; 102: 549-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). Deletion analysis reveals that, although the N-terminal RING finger motif is required for proteolysis function, the C-terminal region of Siah proteins may be involved in the interaction with target proteins (37Hu G. Fearon E.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 724-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the positive synaptophysin-interacting clones, C1, C2, and C3, all contain the C-terminal region of Siah proteins (Fig. 1 A), further supporting the notion that the C-terminal region of Siah is the target protein-binding domain. To determine if the synaptophysin-Siah interaction detected in the yeast two-hybrid system actually occurs in vitro, GST-Siah fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione beads were used to affinity-purify (“pull-down”) endogenous synaptophysin from rat brain homogenate. As shown in Fig.2 A, GST fusion proteins, containing either full-length Siah-1A or N-terminally truncated forms of Siah-1A and Siah-2, were able to bind endogenous synaptophysin. In contrast, control GST proteins were unable to bind synaptophysin, confirming the specificity of the binding. To further determine if synaptophysin associates with Siah proteins in vivo, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed using lysates of CHO cells co-transfected with synaptophysin and HA-tagged Siah-1A or Siah-2. As shown in Fig. 2 B, synaptophysin and HA-Siah-1A were co-immunoprecipitated by the anti-HA antibody but not by the IgG control. Similarly, synaptophysin and HA-Siah-2 (C2) were also co-immunoprecipitated (Fig. 2 C). These results confirm the specific association of synaptophysin with Siah proteins in mammalian cells. As shown in Fig. 1, Siah-1A and Siah-2 are highly homologous proteins that share a conserved region with 90% amino acid identity (31Della N.G. Senior P.V. Bowtell D.D. Development. 1993; 117: 1333-1343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Hu G. Chung Y.L. Glover T. Valentine V. Look A.T. Fearon E.R. Genomics. 1997; 46: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The three Siah clones isolated from the yeast two-hybrid screen encode either part or complete sequences of the conserved region (Fig. 1 A). To further define the specific domain of Siah proteins responsible for the interaction with synaptophysin, we generated a series of GST fusion proteins containing various truncations of the Siah-2-conserved region and analyzed their interaction with endogenous synaptophysin from brain extracts (Fig.3 A). Deletion of the RING finger and the cysteine/histidine-rich motif (Siah-2 Δ1 and Siah-2 Δ2) of Siah-2 had no effect on its interaction with synaptophysin, indicating that these regions are not involved in binding synaptophysin. Similarly, the C-terminal residues 278–325 (Siah-2 Δ3) are dispensable for association with synaptophysin. However, further deletion of amino acids 225–278 (Siah-2 Δ4) abolished the ability of Siah to interact with synaptophysin, indicating that this region is necessary for binding synaptophysin. Conversely, GST fusion protein containing amino acids 225–278 (Siah-2 Δ5) is capable of binding synaptophysin (Fig. 3 A). These data indicate that the region between residues 225 and 278 is necessary and sufficient for binding synaptophysin. To further understand the structural requirements underlying the Siah-synaptophysin interaction, we preformed similar deletion analysis of the cytoplasmic tail of synaptophysin to map the Siah-binding site. A series of S-tag synaptophysin deletion mutants were generated and tested for their ability to bind GST-Siah-1A fusion proteins in binding assays in vitro (Fig. 3 B). The cytoplasmic tail of synaptophysin contains nine copies of an imperfect pentapeptide repeat, YGP(Q)QG, with unknown function (1Sudhof T.C. Lottspeich F. Greengard P. Mehl E. Jahn R.

Reactive oxygen species-induced cerebral events are attributable, in part, to the change in intracellular signaling molecules including mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases. Big MAP kinase 1 (BMK1), also known as ERK5, is a newly identified member of the MAP kinase family and has been reported to be sensitive to oxidative stress. In the present study, we examined the effect of H2O2 on BMK1 activity in PC12 cells, and we investigated the pathophysiological implication of BMK1. Findings showed that BMK1 was rapidly and significantly activated by H2O2 in a concentration-dependent manner in PC12 cells. BMK1 activation by H2O2was inhibited by both PD98059 and U0126, which were reported to inhibit MEK5 as well as MEK1/2. c-Src was suggested to be involved in BMK1 activation from the experiments with herbimycin A and PP2, specific inhibitors of Src family kinases. Transfection of kinase-inactive Src also inhibited H2O2-induced BMK1 activation. In addition, H2O2 treatment of cells induced an enhancement of DNA binding activity of MEF2C, a downstream transcription factor of BMK1 in PC12 cells. Finally, pretreatment of cells with PD98059 and U0126 resulted in an increase in cell death including apoptosis by H2O2 in ERK1/2 down-regulated cells as well as in intact PC12 cells. These findings suggest that c-Src mediated BMK1 activation by H2O2 may counteract ischemic cellular damage probably through the activation of MEF2C transcription factor.

ROS including hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), superoxide radical ( O2⨪), hydroxyl radical (⋅OH), and peroxynitrate (ONOO−) have been shown to increase upon reperfusion of the brain following ischemia (3Chan P.H. Stroke. 1996; 27: 1124-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). In the ischemia and reperfused brain, many alterations such as the change in neurotransmitter release, change in gene expression, and neuronal cell death have been observed (4Chan P.H. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2001; 21: 2-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1450) Google Scholar, 5Mattson M.P. Culmsee C. Yu Z.F. Cell Tissue Res. 2000; 301: 173-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). These alterations in the brain during ischemia-reperfusion were suggested to be attributable to the change in the intracellular signaling mechanisms. Among many intracellular signaling molecules, ROS-induced cellular events have been implicated, in part, to the activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases (6Herdegen T. Claret F.X. Kallunki T. Martin-Villalba A. Winter C. Hunter T. Karin M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 5124-5135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Ozawa H. Shioda S. Dohi K. Matsumoto H. Mizushima H. Zhou C.J. Funahashi H. Nakai Y. Nakajo S. Matsumoto K. Neurosci. Lett. 1999; 262: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Four subfamilies of MAP kinases that are sensitive to ROS have been identified as follows: extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2), c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), p38 kinase, and big MAP kinase 1 (BMK1 or ERK5) (8Abe J. Berk B.C. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1998; 8: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 9Berk B.C. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 810-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Each subfamily may be regulated via different signal transduction pathways and modulate specific cell functions (10Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2292) Google Scholar). ERK1/2 is activated by an upstream kinase (MAPK kinase 1 or MEK1) via dual phosphorylation of the TEY motif, whereas JNK and p38 kinases are activated by MKK4/7 and MKK3/6 via phosphorylation of the TPY and TGY motifs, respectively. BMK1 is the newest MAP kinase family member with a large COOH-terminal and a unique loop-12 sequence that shares the TEY activation motif with ERK1/2 but is activated by MAPK kinase 5 (MEK5) (11Lee J.D.

The role of BMK1 in neuronal cells as well as in PC12 cells was recently investigated, and it was reported that BMK1 was activated by serum, epidermal growth factor (EGF), and nerve growth factor (13Kato Y.

BMK1 has been reported to contribute to EGF-induced cell proliferation and cell cycle progression (14Kato Y. Tapping R.I. Huang S. Watson M.H. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.D. Nature. 1998; 395: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) as well as Ras-dependent cellular transformation (16English J.M. Pearson G. Hockenberry T. Shivakumar L. White M.A. Cobb M.H. J.

PC12 cells are useful for studying the intracellular signaling mechanisms and are regarded as a model for catecholamine-containing neurons. Recently, several studies (17Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5045) Google Scholar, 18Zhang Y. Zhou L. Miller C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Brain Res. 1994; 634: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) reported the roles of MAP kinase activation in both the protection and the injury of postischemic neuronal cells including PC12 cells. It was reported that activation of three classical MAP kinase family members, ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 kinase, was observed after ischemia and reperfusion of neurons (6Herdegen T. Claret F.X. Kallunki T. Martin-Villalba A. Winter C. Hunter T. Karin M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 5124-5135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Ozawa H. Shioda S. Dohi K. Matsumoto H. Mizushima H. Zhou C.J. Funahashi H. Nakai Y. Nakajo S. Matsumoto K. Neurosci. Lett. 1999; 262: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). These studies suggested that the activation of ERK1/2 made neuronal cells protective against ischemia and reperfusion, whereas the activation of JNK and p38 kinase led to apoptosis (17Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5045) Google Scholar, 18Zhang Y. Zhou L. Miller C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2586-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, changes in BMK1 activity and its role in oxidative stress-induced neuronal cell damage have not yet been reported. In the ischemia and reperfused heart, activation of BMK1 was reported (20Takeishi Y. Abe J. Lee J.D. Kawakatsu H. Walsh R.A. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 1164-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In addition, ROS-mediated BMK1 activation was observed in cultured fibroblasts (21Abe J. Takahashi M. Ishida M. Lee J.D. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20389-20394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that BMK1 may be activated by oxidative stress in neuronal cells and play some role in ROS-mediated cellular injury. In the present study, we examined the effect of H2O2, as an oxidative stress, on the change in BMK1 activity in PC12 cells. Furthermore, we investigated the signaling pathways that are involved in BMK1 activation and their physiological implications in ROS-mediated cellular injury. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma except where indicated. Herbimycin A and PP2 were purchased from Calbiochem. U0126 was from Promega (Madison, WI). H2O2 and PD98059 were from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). Anti-ERK5 and anti-ERK1/2 antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-Src antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-Src phosphospecific antibody (Tyr-418) was from BIOSOURCE (Camarillo, CA). All other chemicals were commercial products of reagent grade. Rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% donor horse serum, 5% newborn calf serum, and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin) in flasks precoated with collagen. The culture was replaced after 2 months of passage by thawing a fresh aliquot of frozen cells. The cultures were maintained in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells at 70–80% confluence in 100-, 60-, and 35-mm dishes were growth-arrested by incubation in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium for 24 h prior to use. All experiments were performed with growth-arrested cells to minimize basal BMK1 activity. For transfection of wild type (WT) or kinase-inactive (KI) Src, commercially available pUSE mammalian expression vectors encoding pp60c-Src (WT) or catalytically inactive Src (K297R) were used (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). For transient expression experiments, cells in serum-free Opti-minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) were transfected 1 day after replating by SuperFector (B-Bridge International, Inc., San Jose, CA) as described previously (22Liao D.F. Monia B. Dean N. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6146-6150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). After 24 h of incubation, cells were harvested for experiments. Subconfluent PC12 cells in 100-mm culture dishes were made quiescent by placing them in serum-free medium. PC12 cells in the serum-free medium were treated with or without H2O2 at each indicated time or dose-point. After treatment, the cells were washed once with PBS, then lysed with 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin and 1 mm PMSF) and flash frozen using liquid nitrogen. After allowing the cells to thaw, cells were scraped off the dish and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the protein concentration was determined using the Bradford protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were incubated with anti-ERK5 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-Src antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) overnight and then incubated with protein A-agarose beads or protein G-agarose beads, respectively (Invitrogen), for 2 h on a roller system at 4 °C. BMK1 kinase activity was measured by autophosphorylation as described previously (21Abe J. Takahashi M. Ishida M. Lee J.D. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20389-20394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). For the kinase assay of BMK1, subconfluent cells on a 100-mm dish in the serum-free medium were treated with or without H2O2. Then the cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS, scraped in a lysis buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mmEGTA, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm DTT, and 1% aprotinin (200 μl of buffer/60-mm dish or 400 μl/100-mm dish), and extracted by pipetting 20 times, followed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 20 min. Protein concentrations were assayed by the Bradford method as described above. Equal amounts of protein extract were used for immunoprecipitation as described above. The immune complex on the beads was washed two times with lysis buffer, two times with LiCl wash buffer (500 mmLiCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm DTT), and two times in washing buffer (20 mmHEPES, pH 7.2, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 0.1% Triton X-100). To detect the kinase activity, the immune complex was washed once with a reaction buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm DTT, and 1 mm PMSF and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, and 100 μm ATP (2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP). After SDS-PAGE, the gel was dried and subjected to autoradiography and analyzed with a bioimaging analyzer (BAS-1500; Fuji film, Tokyo, Japan). Src kinase activity was quantified using the Universal Tyrosine Kinase Assay Kit (Takara, Tokyo, Japan) as described previously (23Wakatsuki S. Arioka M. Dohmae N. Takio K. Yamasaki M. Kitamoto K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 126: 1151-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). PC12 cells were immediately solubilized with an equal volume of lysis buffer for 30 min, and the resulting lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Src antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) as described above. Following immunoprecipitation, Src immune complexes were washed twice with lysis buffer and then Src kinase activities of each sample was assayed using the kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Using goat polyclonal ERK5 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), ERK5/BMK1 proteins in PC12 cells were measured with Western blot analysis as described previously (24Yoshizumi M. Abe J. Haendeler J. Huang Q. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11706-11712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). For evaluation of activated Src, phosphospecific-Src antibody at Tyr-418 (BIOSOURCE) was used. ERK1/2 proteins in antisense oligonucleotide-transfected cells were determined with anti-ERK1/2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For Western blot analysis, the protein extract from PC12 cells (30 μg) was boiled for 5 min in Laemmli sample buffer and then subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the protein extracts were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (HybondTM-ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Complete protein transfer to the membrane was verified by staining the gel with Coomassie Blue. The membrane was blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS-T. The blots were incubated overnight at 4 °C with ERK5 antibody or phospho-Src antibody, followed by incubation for 1 h with secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated). Immunoreactive bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence with ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences) and exposure to Hyperfilm-ECL. The intensity of the bands was measured using a Macintosh i-Mac computer with an optical UMAX Astra 2200 scanner and the public domain NIH Image program. Gel mobility shift assay was measured as described previously (25Yoshizumi M. Kim S. Kagami S. Hamaguchi A. Tsuchiya K. Houchi H. Iwao H. Kido H. Tamaki T. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 1019-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). For the assay, nuclear protein extracts were prepared from PC12 cells in 100-mm dishes after stimulation with H2O2 at the indicated time points. The cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and were scraped off the plate into 1 ml of PBS, and then the cells were centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 5 min, and supernatants were removed. The samples were homogenized in 0.4 ml of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, containing 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm PMSF, 1 mm DTT, 10 μg/μl chymostatin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin; incubated on ice for 15 min; and then added to a 1/100 volume of 10% Nonidet P-40 centrifuged at 5,000 ×g for 30 s at 4 °C. The resulting precipitations were homogenized in 50 μl of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.4m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm DTT, 10 μg/ml chymostatin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin and then stirred at 4 °C for 15 min. The resulting supernatants were assayed for protein concentrations and stored at −80 °C before use. The procedure for the assay was described previously (25Yoshizumi M. Kim S. Kagami S. Hamaguchi A. Tsuchiya K. Houchi H. Iwao H. Kido H. Tamaki T. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 1019-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In brief, the gel mobility shift assay of PC12 cells nuclear MEF2C binding activity was performed with an oligonucleotide probe containing the MEF2C-binding sequence (5′-GATGCGTCTAAAAATAACCCTGTCG-3′) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The probe was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) using T4 polynucleotide kinase and purified by chromatography on a Bio-Spin column (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). For the DNA-protein binding reaction, the samples of PC12 cell nuclear extracts (10 μg of protein) were incubated with 10 fmol of a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide containing the consensus MEF2C-binding site at room temperature for 30 min, in 20 μl of binding buffer consisting of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 80 mm NaCl, 0.3 mmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.2 mm PMSF, 6% glycerol, and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC)(Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The DNA-protein complexes were separated from the free DNA probe using electrophoresis on 7% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in 6.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 3.3 mm sodium acetate, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 2.5% glycerol. Gels were run at 160 V at 4 °C for 3 h, dried, then subjected to autoradiography, and analyzed with a bioimaging analyzer (BAS-1500). To demonstrate the specificity of DNA-protein binding, binding reactions were performed as described above, in the presence of a 100-fold molar excess of a non-labeled MEF2C consensus oligonucleotide competitor followed by electrophoresis. In addition, supershift assays were performed with rabbit polyclonal anti-MEF2C antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Anti-MEF2C antibody was added to samples after the initial binding reaction between nuclear protein extracts from PC12 cells and32P-labeled consensus MEF2C oligonucleotide; the reaction was allowed to proceed at room temperature for 1 h, and the samples were then subjected to electrophoresis, as described above. Measurement of cellular MTT reduction was carried out as described previously (26Hansen M.B. Nielsen S.E. Berg K. J. Immunol. Methods. 1989; 119: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (3353) Google Scholar). PC12 cells were cultured at 70–80% confluency. Thereafter, cells were growth-arrested by serum-free RPMI 1640 medium. Following the indicated incubation time with H2O2, MTT was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml, and after a further 1-h incubation PC12 cells were lysed with isopropyl alcohol that contained 0.04n HCl. The MTT reduction was read at 550 nm using a spectrophotometer. PC12 cells were stained with Hoechst 33248 dye (27Koyama A.H. Akari H. Adachi A. Goshima F. Nishiyama Y. Arch. Virol. 1998; 143: 2435-2441Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). PC12 cells were cultured on a cover glass in a 35-mm dish and then the cell-attached cover glass was removed, washed in PBS, transferred into MeOH/acetic acid (3:1), and submerged for 2 min, and then the cells were dried at room temperature. The cells were then fixed on a cover glass at room temperature and stained with Hoechst 33248 working solution (0.05 μg/ml) for 10 min. Next, the cover glass was washed with distilled water and mounted in buffered glycerol. Fluorescence was visualized using a fluorescent microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). DNA fragmentation was detected by the methods of Wyllie et al.(28Wyllie A.H. Kerr J.F. Currie A.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1980; 68: 251-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (6728) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Cells were pelleted at 400 ×g and washed twice with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.0). The pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of Tris-EDTA (1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0) and lysed with 0.5 ml of an extraction buffer (0.1 m EDTA, 0.5% SDS, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0) containing 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K. After overnight incubation at 50 °C, DNA was extracted from the samples and ethanol preincubated for agarose gel electrophoresis. The DNA separated in the 2% agarose gel was visualized by UV fluorescence. Antisense oligonucleotide treatment of cells was carried out as described previously (29Sale E.M. Atkinson P.G. Sale G.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 674-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Cells (70% confluent in 35-mm dishes) were carefully washed with RPMI 1640 medium. ERK1/2 oligonucleotides (antisense and control) (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA) andN-[1-(2,3-Dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methylsulfate (DOTAP) solution (15 μg) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) diluted with HEPES-buffered saline (20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl) were mixed and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. The final concentrations of oligonucleotides are as indicated. Transfected cells were incubated for 8 h at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2. After this time the medium containingN-[1-(2, 3-Dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methylsulfate (DOTAP) was removed and the incubation continued for 24 h using fresh serum-free medium containing appropriate oligonucleotide concentrations. After 24 h, cells were replaced with fresh serum-free medium, stimulated by H2O2, and assayed for cell viability. Values are presented as means ± S.D. for 3–5 separate experiments. One-way analysis of variance was used to determine significance among groups, after which the modifiedt test with the Bonferroni correction were used for comparison between individual groups. A value at p < 0.05 was considered to be significant. We first examined whether BMK1 was activated by H2O2 in PC12 cells. Growth-arrested PC12 cells were treated at various times and with various concentrations of H2O2. Endogenous BMK1 activity was measured byin vitro kinase assay based on BMK1 autophosphorylation as described under “Materials and Methods.” The H2O2 treatment of cells resulted in a maximal activation of BMK1 at 5 min (Fig.1 A). In the examined concentration range of H2O2 (0.01–1 mm), the BMK1 activity increased in a dose-dependent manner, and maximal activation occurred at 300 μm of H2O2 (Fig.1 B). Recently, the MEK1/2 inhibitors, U0126 and PD98059, were reported shown to inhibit MEK5, which is known as an upstream regulator of BMK1 in many cells (15Kamakura S. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26563-26571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 30Cavanaugh J.E. Ham J. Hetman M. Poser S. Yan C. Xia Z. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 434-443Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether H2O2-induced BMK1 activation was also inhibited by U0126 and PD98059 in PC12 cells. Pretreatment of the cells with U0126 resulted in an inhibition of BMK1 activation by H2O2 in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2 A). Another MEK1/2 inhibitor, PD98059, also inhibited the H2O2-induced BMK1 activation in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2 B). Many tyrosine kinases including receptor and nonreceptor type tyrosine kinases have been reported to activate ERKs in many cell types (31Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,32Cano E. Mahadevan L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 117-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). It was reported that H2O2 stimulates ERK1/2 activation via the Src tyrosine kinase-dependent pathway (33Aikawa R. Komuro I. Yamazaki T. Zou Y. Kudoh S. Tanaka M. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Yazaki Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1813-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that c-Src is involved in H2O2-induced BMK1 activation in cultured fibroblasts (21Abe J. Takahashi M. Ishida M. Lee J.D. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20389-20394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). To elucidate whether H2O2activates BMK1 through the Src-dependent pathway in PC12 cells, we first examined the effect H2O2 on c-Src tyrosine kinase activity in PC12 cells. Application of 300 μm H2O2 caused rapid and significant activation of c-Src (Fig.3 B) as well as its phosphorylation (Fig. 3 A) at tyrosine 418, an autophosphorylation that leads to full catalytic activity of the kinase. A tyrosine kinase inhibitor, herbimycin A (0.3 μm), and Src kinase inhibitor, PP2 (30 μm), both inhibited H2O2-induced Src kinase activation and its phosphorylation (Fig. 3, A andB). In addition, herbimycin A and PP2 both inhibited H2O2-induced BMK1 activation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.4). Transfection of kinase-inactive Src (KI Src) also inhibited H2O2-induced BMK1 activation in PC12 cells (Fig. 5). These findings strongly suggest that c-Src is involved in H2O2-induced BMK1 activation in PC12 cells.Figure 4H2O2-induced BMK1 activation was inhibited by herbimycin A and PP2 in PC12 cells.Cells were pretreated with various concentrations of herbimycin A (HA) for 16 h (A) and PP2 for 15 min (B). After stimulation with 300 μmH2O2 for 5 min, cells were harvested, lysed, and used for subsequent analysis. BMK1 activity was assayed as described under “Materials and Methods.” No differences in the amount of BMK1 were observed in samples by Western blot analysis with anti-ERK5 antibody (A and B, middle). Values were normalized by arbitrarily setting the densitometry of control cells (without H2O2) to 1.0 (values are the mean ± S.D., n = 3, A andB, lower).

Cells were then treated with 300 μmH2O2 for 5 min, and then cells were harvested in lysis buffer, and BMK1 activity was assayed as described under “Materials and Methods.” No differences in the amount of BMK1 were observed in samples by Western blot analysis with anti-ERK5 antibody (middle panel).

Therefore, we examined whether H2O2-induced BMK1 activation regulates MEF2C DNA binding activity in PC12 cells evaluated with gel mobility shift assay. The nuclear protein extracts from PC12 cells treated with H2O2 at different time points were assayed. As shown in Fig.6 A, MEF2C DNA binding activity increased time-dependently, reached a peak at 8 h, and was sustained for up to 24 h of incubation of PC12 cells with 300 μm H2O2.

To assess the general importance of IGF-independent mechanisms, we have generated human IGFBP-3 mutants that cannot bind IGF-I or IGF-II by substituting alanine for six residues in the proposed IGF binding site, Ile56/Tyr57/Arg75/Leu77/Leu80/Leu81, and expressing the 6m-hIGFBP-3 mutant construct in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Binding of both IGF-I and IGF-II to 6m-hIGFBP-3 was reduced >80-fold. The nonbinding 6m-hIGFBP-3 mutant still was able to inhibit DNA synthesis in a mink lung epithelial cell line in which inhibition by wild-type hIGFBP-3 previously had been shown to be exclusively IGF-independent. 6m-hIGFBP-3 only can act by IGF-independent mechanisms since it is unable to form complexes with the IGFs that inhibit their action. We next compared the ability of wild-type and 6m-hIGFBP-3 to stimulate apoptosis in serum-deprived PC-3 human prostate cancer cells. PC-3 cells are known to synthesize and respond to IGF-II, so that IGFBP-3 could potentially act by either IGF-dependent or IGF-independent mechanisms. In fact, 6m-hIGFBP-3 stimulated PC-3 cell death and stimulated apoptosis-induced DNA fragmentation to the same extent and with the same concentration dependence as wild-type hIGFBP-3. These results indicate that IGF-independent mechanisms are major contributors to IGFBP-3-induced apoptosis in PC-3 cells and may play a wider role in the antiproliferative and antitumorigenic actions of IGFBP-3.

The evidence supporting this hypothesis, however, only has been obtained under special circumstances: in cells that do not synthesize IGF-I or IGF-II, in serum-free medium so as not to introduce IGFs, or in cells that lack IGF-I receptors or do not respond to added IGFs. Since these conditions do not apply to the vast majority of normal and tumor cells that synthesize and respond to IGFs, the extent to which IGF-independent mechanisms contribute to the antiproliferative actions of IGFBP-3 is unknown.In the present study, we have developed a novel and more generally applicable strategy to evaluate the contributions of IGF-independent mechanisms to growth inhibition by IGFBP-3. It is based on the recent identification of an IGF binding site in hIGFBP-5 (37Kalus W. Zweckstetter M. Renner C. Sanchez Y. Georgescu J. Grol M. Demuth D. Schumacher R. Dony C. Lang K. Holak T.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6558-6572Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) that is highly conserved in hIGFBP-3. We introduced mutations at six positions in the N-terminal region of hIGFBP-3 that abolished the binding of both IGF-I and IGF-II. The nonbinding hIGFBP-3 mutant inhibited DNA synthesis in a cell line in which inhibition by wild-type hIGFBP-3 previously had been shown to be exclusively IGF-independent (34Wu H.B. Kumar A. Tsai W.C. Mascarenhas D. Healey J. Rechler M.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 77: 288-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The hIGFBP-3 mutant then was used to determine the extent to which IGF-independent mechanisms contributed to the induction of apoptosis by IGFBP-3 in PC-3 human prostate carcinoma cells (38Kaighn M.E. Narayan K.S. Ohnuki Y. Lechner J.F. Jones L.W. Invest. Urol. 1979; 17: 16-23PubMed Google Scholar). Previous reports had suggested that IGFBP-3 might stimulate apoptosis or inhibit DNA synthesis in PC-3 cells by either IGF-independent (4Rajah R. Valentinis B. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12181-12188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar) or IGF-dependent (26Huynh H. Pollak M. Zhang J.C. Int. J.

The nonbinding hIGFBP-3 mutant was as effective as wild-type hIGFBP-3 in stimulating apoptosis in PC-3 cells, suggesting that direct IGF-independent mechanisms are important contributors to the antiproliferative actions of IGFBP-3.DISCUSSIONIGFBP-3 can stimulate apoptosis and inhibit cell proliferation directly in an IGF-independent manner or indirectly by preventing the stimulation of cell survival and proliferation by IGF-I and IGF-II (33Rechler M.M.

To assess the general importance of IGF-independent mechanisms to the antiproliferative actions of IGFBP-3, we have generated hIGFBP-3 mutants that do not bind either IGF-I or IGF-II. The mutants retain their ability to inhibit DNA synthesis in an IGF-independent manner. We examined the ability of one of the nonbinding hIGFBP-3 mutants to stimulate apoptosis in the PC-3 human prostate cancer cell line, in which both IGF-independent (4Rajah R. Valentinis B. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12181-12188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar) and IGF-dependent (26Huynh H. Pollak M. Zhang J.C. Int. J. Oncol. 1998; 13: 137-143PubMed Google Scholar) actions of hIGFBP-3 have been reported. The nonbinding hIGFBP-3 mutant stimulated apoptosis in PC-3 cells as effectively as wild-type hIGFBP-3, establishing that hIGFBP-3 can induce apoptosis without binding IGFs and suggesting that direct IGF-independent mechanisms could be major contributors to the induction of apoptosis by hIGFBP-3.The nonbinding hIGFBP-3 mutant, 6m-hIGFBP-3, in which alanine was substituted for the natural amino acid at six positions (Ile56/Tyr57/Arg75/Leu77/Leu80/Leu81), was designed based on the IGF binding site recently identified in a peptide from the N-terminal region of hIGFBP-5 (37Kalus W. Zweckstetter M. Renner C. Sanchez Y. Georgescu J. Grol M. Demuth D. Schumacher R. Dony C. Lang K. Holak T.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6558-6572Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) that is strongly conserved in hIGFBP-3. The mutant protein did not bind either IGF-I or IGF-II under denaturing or nondenaturing conditions, satisfying the first requirement for use in our proposed studies. While our experiments were in progress, Imai et al. (49Imai Y. Moralez A. Andag U. Clarke J.B. Busby Jr., W.H. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18188-18194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) reported that a hIGFBP-3 mutant with five substitutions in the same region (R75S/P76A/L77S/L80Q/L81G) also exhibited greatly reduced binding of IGF-I; IGF-II was not examined in their study. Their mutant failed to inhibit two IGF-dependent actions, IGF-I-stimulated DNA synthesis in and migration of smooth muscle cells. IGF-I and IGF-II also bind to C-terminal fragments of hIGFBP-3 (50Spencer E.M. Chan K. Prog. Growth Factor Res. 1995; 6: 209-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 51Galanis M.

Although IGFs can bind to the C-terminal region of hIGFBP-3, our results together with those of Imai et al. (49Imai Y. Moralez A. Andag U. Clarke J.B. Busby Jr., W.H. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18188-18194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) demonstrate that the N-terminal binding site is essential for high affinity binding of IGF-I and IGF-II to intact hIGFBP-3.A hIGFBP-3 mutant with alanine substitutions at only two of the six positions, Arg75 and Leu77, also exhibited markedly decreased binding of both IGF-I and IGF-II. Leu77is conserved in all six IGFBPs and is part of a hydrophobic patch on the surface of the IGF binding region of hIGFBP-5 (37Kalus W. Zweckstetter M. Renner C. Sanchez Y. Georgescu J. Grol M. Demuth D. Schumacher R. Dony C. Lang K. Holak T.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6558-6572Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Basic residues corresponding to Arg75 are present in IGFBP-4 and IGFBP-5 but not in the other hIGFBPs (1Rechler M.M. Vitam. Horm. 1993; 47: 1-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar) or rat IGFBP-3 (47Hashimoto R. Ono M. Fujiwara H. Higashihashi N. Yoshida M. Enjoh-Kimura T. Sakano K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27936-27942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The conservation of Leu77 suggests that it may be the more critical of the two residues for high affinity binding of IGF-I and IGF-II. This inference is supported by the recent report of the 2.1-Å crystal structure of the complex of IGF-I and the N-terminal IGF-binding domain of hIGFBP-5 (55Zeslawski W. Beisel H.G. Kamionka M. Kalus W. Engh R.A. Huber R. Lang K. Holak T.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3638-3644Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The principal interaction of one of the protruding IGF-I side chains is with a cluster of hydrophobic residues (Val49, Leu70, and Leu74) in a solvent-exposed cleft of mini-IGFBP-5. These residues are analogous to Ile56, Leu77, and Leu81 of hIGFBP-3 (Fig. 1).We previously reported that nonglycosylated recombinant hIGFBP-3 inhibited DNA synthesis in a mink lung epithelial cell line exclusively by IGF-independent mechanisms (34Wu H.B. Kumar A. Tsai W.C. Mascarenhas D. Healey J. Rechler M.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 77: 288-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This conclusion is strongly supported by the present findings that the three hIGFBP-3 mutants with markedly reduced binding of IGF-I and IGF-II still inhibited DNA synthesis in CCL64 cells as effectively as glycosylated recombinant hIGFBP-3 standard or wild-type CHO-hIGFBP-3. The nonbinding hIGFBP-3 mutants only can act by IGF-independent mechanisms, since they are unable to form complexes with the IGFs that would inhibit their actions. Inhibition of CCL64 DNA synthesis by wild-type hIGFBP-3 was abolished when it bound [Leu60]IGF-I, an IGF-I analogue that binds poorly to IGF-I receptors (34Wu H.B. Kumar A. Tsai W.C. Mascarenhas D. Healey J. Rechler M.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 77: 288-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), whereas coincubation with [Leu60]IGF-I did not affect inhibition by 6m-hIGFBP-3. These results support the concept that [Leu60]IGF-I must bind to hIGFBP-3 to induce a conformational change that prevents it from directly inhibiting DNA synthesis.The critical test remained, to use the nonbinding 6m-hIGFBP-3 mutant to examine the relative contributions of IGF-independent and IGF-dependent mechanisms to the antiproliferative actions of IGFBP-3 in a cell line that expressed and responded to IGFs so that both IGF-dependent and IGF-independent mechanisms were possible. The induction of apoptosis by hIGFBP-3 in PC-3 human prostate carcinoma cells provided such a test. Rajah et al.(4Rajah R. Valentinis B. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12181-12188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar) showed that hIGFBP-3 stimulated apoptosis in PC-3 cells and suggested that this stimulation was IGF-independent because IGFBP-3-induced apoptosis was decreased about 50% by coincubation with IGF-I but not by coincubation with LongR3-IGF-I, an IGF-I analogue that binds with high affinity to IGF-I receptors but poorly to IGFBP-3. Other investigators, on the other hand, had reported that PC-3 cells synthesize IGF-II (40Angelloz-Nicoud P. Binoux M. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 5485-5492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Kimura G.

Mathad V.T. Bhaduri A.P. Maheshwari R.K. Anticancer Res. 2000; 20: 2547-2552PubMed Google Scholar) and that endogenous IGF-II acts as an autocrine growth factor by stimulating the IGF-I receptor. Spontaneous growth of PC-3 cells in serum-free medium was inhibited by an antisense oligonucleotide to the IGF-I receptor (39Pietrzkowski Z. Mulholland G. Gomella L. Jameson B.A. Wernicke D. Baserga R. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1102-1106PubMed Google Scholar) and by monoclonal antibodies to the IGF-I receptor (40Angelloz-Nicoud P. Binoux M. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 5485-5492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Kimura G. Kasuya J. Giannini S. Honda Y. Mohan S. Kawachi M. Akimoto M. Fujita-Yamaguchi Y. Int. J. Urol. 1996; 3: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) or to IGF-II (26Huynh H. Pollak M. Zhang J.C. Int. J. Oncol. 1998; 13: 137-143PubMed Google Scholar, 40Angelloz-Nicoud P. Binoux M. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 5485-5492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IGFBP-3 also inhibited PC-3 cell proliferation, presumably by forming complexes with IGF-II that could not activate the IGF-I receptor (26Huynh H. Pollak M. Zhang J.C. Int. J. Oncol. 1998; 13: 137-143PubMed Google Scholar).The nonbinding 6m-hIGFBP-3 mutant induced apoptosis in serum-deprived PC-3 cells as effectively as wild-type hIGFBP-3. Incubation of PC-3 cells with wild-type or 6m-hIGFBP-3 for 72 h increased the detachment of cells from the monolayer, with most of the floating cells being dead. Cell death and detachment appear to be separate processes. In Fig. 7 (lower panel), coincubation of PC-3 cells with wild-type hIGFBP-3 and [Leu60]IGF-I did not reduce the percentage of recovered cells that were floating compared with cells treated with hIGFBP-3 alone, but it markedly decreased the percentage of floating cells that were nonviable. Thus, cells did not need to die to detach, and cell detachment was not sufficient to trigger cell death. The induction of cell death by 6m-hIGFBP-3 is independent of binding IGFs and is not prevented by coincubation with [Leu60]IGF-I, because it cannot bind to the hIGFBP-3 mutant.The induction of PC-3 cell death by wild-type CHO- hIGFBP-3 or 6m-hIGFBP-3 results at least in part from apoptosis. Apoptosis-induced DNA fragmentation was demonstrated by agarose gel electrophoresis of cell lysates showing a ladder of DNA fragments, by DAPI staining showing condensed and fragmented nuclei in individual cells, by TUNEL staining DNA fragments with free 3′-OH ends in individual cells, and by an ELISA sandwich assay, which measures cytosolic histone-bound DNA fragments. In each assay, apoptosis was stimulated to the same extent by a high concentration of 6m-hIGFBP-3 and wild-type CHO-hIGFBP-3. Moreover, in the quantitative ELISA assay, wild-type CHO-hIGFBP-3 and 6m-hIGFBP-3 induced apoptosis with the same concentration dependence, strongly suggesting that IGF-independent mechanisms are major contributors to the induction of apoptosis by hIGFBP-3 in PC-3 cells. The IGF-independent anti-proliferative actions of hIGFBP-3 in PC-3 cells are not limited to apoptosis. Although endogenous IGF-II can stimulate PC-3 cell proliferation via the IGF-I receptor (26Huynh H. Pollak M. Zhang J.C. Int. J. Oncol. 1998; 13: 137-143PubMed Google Scholar, 39Pietrzkowski Z.

The combination of high serum IGF-I and low IGFBP-3 was associated with the greatest cancer risk, with the effect of low IGFBP-3 generally being attributed to increasing the bioavailability of IGF-I.

Together with our results in PC-3 cells, these data suggest that IGF-independent mechanisms may be more widespread and important contributors to the antiproliferative and anti-tumorigenic actions of IGFBP-3 than previously anticipated.IGFBP-3 alone can induce apoptosis in serum-deprived PC-3 cells and T47D breast cancer cells (7Butt A.J.

Using mIMCD-3 epithelial cells, we studied the effect of HGF on the focal adhesion proteins, focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and paxillin and their association. HGF was found to increase the tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin and to a lesser degree FAK. In addition, HGF induced association of paxillin and activated ERK, correlating with a gel retardation of paxillin that was prevented with the ERK inhibitor U0126. The ability of activated ERK to phosphorylate and induce gel retardation of paxillin was confirmed in vitro in both full-length and amino-terminal paxillin. Several potential ERK phosphorylation sites in paxillin flank the paxillin-FAK association domains, so the ability of HGF to regulate paxillin-FAK association was examined. HGF induced an increase in paxillin-FAK association that was inhibited by pretreatment with U0126 and reproduced by in vitro phosphorylation of paxillin with ERK. The prevention of the FAK-paxillin association with U0126 correlated with an inhibition of the HGF-mediated FAK tyrosine phosphorylation and inhibition of HGF-dependent cell spreading and adhesion. An examination of cellular localization of FAK and paxillin demonstrated that HGF caused a condensation of focal adhesion complexes at the leading edges of cell processes and FAK-paxillin co-localization in these large complexes. Thus, these data suggest that HGF can induce serine/threonine phosphorylation of paxillin most probably mediated directly by ERK, resulting in the recruitment and activation of FAK and subsequent enhancement of cell spreading and adhesion.

Physiol. 1994; 267: F271-F280PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of HGF to induce cell migration and morphogenesis implies that it must initiate intracellular signaling events that regulate cell-matrix interactions. In support of this finding, HGF has recently been shown to directly stimulate integrin-dependent tumor cell adhesion to laminin, fibronectin, and vitronectin (5Nebe B. Sanftleben H. Pommerenke H. Peters A. Rychly J. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 243: 263-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 6Beviglia L. Kramer R.H. Int. J.

FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1629-1640Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In studies using immortalized renal murine inner medullary collecting duct (mIMCD-3) epithelial cells, we have demonstrated that HGF induces increased adhesion to fibronectin and type 1 collagen, and that this increase in adhesion is dependent on ERK activation (8Liu Z.X. Nickel C.H. Cantley L.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: F62-F70PubMed Google Scholar). Presently, there is little known about the mechanism for the HGF-dependent increase in epithelial cell adhesion. In two studies (5Nebe B. Sanftleben H. Pommerenke H. Peters A. Rychly J. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 243: 263-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 6Beviglia L. Kramer R.H. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 83: 640-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), the stimulation with HGF has been found to cause tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and to mediate an increased linkage between the integrin complexes and the actin cytoskeleton. In breast carcinoma cells, Beviglia and Kramer (6Beviglia L. Kramer R.H. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 83: 640-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) found that HGF induced tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK in adherent cells but failed to induce FAK activation in suspended cells. Similarly, Chen et al.(9Chen H.C. Chan P.C. Tang M.J. Cheng C.H. Chang T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25777-25782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) found that stimulation of A293 cells with HGF resulted in FAK phosphorylation on tyrosine. This phosphorylation was most pronounced in cells adherent to plastic dishes or polylysine-coated dishes. Interestingly, A293 cells adherent to dishes coated with fibronectin revealed a marked increase in basal tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK with only a modest further increase following the activation of c-Met. In this study, we examined the effects of c-Met activation on the regulation of FAK and paxillin in renal tubular epithelial cells. We found that in mIMCD-3 cells, FAK exhibits a high basal level of tyrosine phosphorylation with only a modest increase following HGF stimulation. In contrast, paxillin demonstrates a marked increase in tyrosine phosphorylation following HGF stimulation as well as a decrease in gel mobility reminiscent of serine/threonine phosphorylation. This gel retardation was found to be dependent on HGF-mediated ERK activation and to correlate with an association of paxillin and activated ERK. We demonstrate that ERK can phosphorylate paxillin in vitro, resulting in an increase in the association of paxillin and FAK. Finally, HGF was found to induce paxillin-FAK association in adherent cells in an ERK-dependent manner. Experiments were performed with immortalized mIMCD-3 cells of ureteric bud origin (10Rauchman M. Nigam S. Delpire E. Gullans S. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; : F416-F424PubMed Google Scholar) that are known to express the c-Met receptor and undergo striking tubulogenesis in response to HGF (4Cantley L.G. Barros E.J. Gandhi M. Rauchman M. Nigam S.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: F271-F280PubMed Google Scholar). All cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Antibody sources for immunoprecipitation, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence are paxillin monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories), FAK monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody and anti-phospho-MAPK (Upstate Biotechnology). All other chemicals were from the Sigma unless otherwise noted. Cells were made quiescent by serum starvation for 24 h followed by stimulation with HGF (40 ng/ml) for 10 min. For experiments using whole cell lysates, subconfluent cells were lysed with ice-cold radioimmune precipitation lysis buffer (0.16 m NaCl, 20 mm Trizma base, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin and leupeptin, pH 7.5). For MAPK inhibition studies, cells were preincubated for 20 min with 10 μm U0126 (MEK inhibitor, Promega) prior to stimulation with HGF. The sample was centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 × g at 4 °C to remove non-solubilized debris, and the supernatant protein content was determined using the Bradford assay. For paxillin and FAK co-immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed with Triton X-100 lysis buffer (0.15 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris, 1% Triton X-100, 0.05% Tween 20, 1 mm NaF, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin and leupeptin, pH 7.4) as described previously by Liu et al.

Either anti-paxillin or anti-FAK antibodies were added and incubated at 4 °C overnight with gentle rocking. Immunocomplexes were collected by incubation with either protein A or protein G, washed four times with 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer, resuspended in 2× Laemmli sample buffer, and separated using 7.5% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore) and immunoblotted with the appropriate antibody followed by detection using ECL chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Detection of gel retardation of paxillin required prolonged separation on 8.75% SDS gels. GlutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion NH2-terminal paxillin spanning amino acids 1–323 was expressed and isolated fromEscherichia coli (DH5) as described previously (12Roshan B. Kjelsberg C.

The protein expression was induced with isopropyl-d-thiogalactoside, and the bacteria were pelleted and lysed in sodium deoxycholate. Supernatants were collected and incubated with a 50% slurry of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The beads were washed and resuspended in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin until use. Control experiments were performed with GST-Sepharose beads generated by the expression of GST alone using the empty pGEX-4T vector. Total GST fusion protein amounts were estimated visually using Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE with albumin standards. Paxillin was either immunoprecipitated from mIMCD-3 cells as described above or used as the GST-NH2-paxillin fusion protein. In vitro MAPK phosphorylation was performed by the addition of 100 units of active ERK2 or equimolar amounts of inactive ERK2 (New England Biolabs) to paxillin anchored on beads and suspended in 1× kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Brij 35, 100 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences)) for the indicated times at 30 °C. The beads were washed three times, 2× protein sample buffer was added, and the tubes were boiled at 95 °C for 5 min. The supernatants were separated with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using an 8.75% gel and transferred to Immobilon, and autoradiography was performed. Immunoblotting was then performed using the anti-paxillin antibody. For FAK pull-down experiments, beads linked to GST-NH2-paxillin were incubated with inactive or active ERK in the absence of [32P]ATP, washed to remove the ERK, and then incubated for 1 h in cell lysates from unstimulated mIMCD-3 cells prior to SDS-PAGE. mIMCD-3 cells were plated on glass coverslips and serum-starved for 24 h prior to stimulation with HGF (40 ng/ml) ± U0126 (10 μm). Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min, blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin for 1 h, and then processed for immunofluorescence. Coverslips were incubated sequentially for 1 h each at room temperature with monoclonal anti-FAK antibody (1:100, Transduction Laboratories) and rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:64, Sigma) followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated monoclonal anti-paxillin (1:100, Transduction Laboratories). Coverslips were then washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.5% Triton X-100, mounted on glass slides in Antifade-mounting medium (Molecular Probes), and visualized at ×40 using a Zeiss epifluorescence confocal microscope. Cell adhesion was performed as described previously (8Liu Z.X. Nickel C.H. Cantley L.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: F62-F70PubMed Google Scholar). mIMCD-3 cells were serum-starved for 24 h and harvested by bathing in 1 mm EDTA for 10 min. The cells were counted and then treated with HGF (40 ng/ml) or vehicle control for 10 min prior to plating 2 × 104cells/well on 96 well plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F12 medium for 30 min. In experiments using the MEK inhibitor U0126, cells were preincubated with U0126 (10 μm) or vehicle control for 10 min prior to stimulation with HGF. Non-adherent cells were removed by washing twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and the remaining cells were quantitated by the method of Oliver et al. (13Oliver M.H. Harrison N.K. Bishop J.E. Cole P.J. Laurent G.J. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 92: 513-518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were fixed for 30 min with 10% formalin, stained for 30 min with 1% methylene blue, and washed three times with 0.01m boric acid. pH 8.5. The intracellular dye was extracted with 0.1 n HCl/ethanol (1:1) for 1 h at room temperature and quantified by absorbance at 655 nm. Photomicroscopy was performed using a Nikon microscope equipped with Hoffman modulation optics. To examine the effect of c-Met activation on FAK phosphorylation in renal epithelial cells, anti-phosphotyrosine blotting of FAK immunoprecipitated from mIMCD-3 cells was performed. In contrast to the results reported in breast carcinoma cells (6Beviglia L. Kramer R.H. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 83: 640-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), FAK is heavily tyrosine-phosphorylated at base line in stably adherent mIMCD-3 cells with little change following stimulation with HGF (Fig.1 A, right panel). Because matrix-dependent integrin activation has been found to increase FAK phosphorylation (9Chen H.C. Chan P.C. Tang M.J. Cheng C.H. Chang T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25777-25782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), we examined the ability of HGF to activate FAK in cells plated for only 4 h to limit endogenous matrix deposition. In these experiments, base-line FAK phosphorylation was diminished, and HGF did stimulate a modest increase in FAK phosphorylation (Fig. 1 A, left panel). We next examined the focal adhesion complex protein paxillin. Paxillin is a key scaffolding protein between the focal adhesion complex and the actin cytoskeleton that is known to bind to FAK and mediate FAK recruitment to focal adhesion complexes and that is tyrosine-phosphorylated by FAK and/or src in response to integrin engagement (14Bellis S.L. Perrotta J.A. Curtis M.S. Turner C.E. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 15Turner C.E. Int. J. Biochem.

In addition to cell adhesion, various extracellular stimuli including bombesin, platelet-derived growth factor, nerve growth factor, and angiotensin II have been shown to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin (18Zachary I. Sinnett-Smith J. Turner C.E. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22060-22065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Rankin S. Rozengurt E. J. Biol.

In subconfluent mIMCD-3 cells, HGF induced a 2.6-fold increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin (Fig. 1 B, -fold increase based on n = 4, range 1.6–3.7). Of note, fully confluent cells demonstrated higher basal tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin with a smaller increase in response to HGF stimulation (data not shown). In the course of these experiments, we noted that in unstimulated cells paxillin primarily runs as one band at a molecular mass of 68 kDa (Fig.2 A). Following treatment with HGF, the amount of paxillin at 68 kDa decreased, and a new band appeared at ∼70 kDa, a reduction in gel mobility that is suggestive of proteins phosphorylated on serine-proline and/or threonine-proline motifs (22Schutkowski M. Bernhardt A. Zhou X.Z. Shen M. Reimer U. Rahfeld J.U. Lu K.P. Fischer G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5566-5575Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Of note, this reduction of gel mobility was only detectable if the gels were run for prolonged periods until paxillin nearly exited the gel. Because we have previously found that HGF-dependent activation of the serine-threonine kinase ERK is critical for the phenotype of cell migration and adhesion (8Liu Z.X. Nickel C.H. Cantley L.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: F62-F70PubMed Google Scholar, 23Karihaloo A. O'Rourke D.A. Nickel C. Spokes K. Cantley L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9166-9173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), we examined the possibility that the gel retardation of paxillin was attributed to HGF-stimulated ERK activation by using the selective MEK inhibitor U0126. This compound has been shown to inhibit MEK1, MEK2 (24Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3957) Google Scholar), and MEK5 (23Karihaloo A. O'Rourke D.A. Nickel C. Spokes K. Cantley L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9166-9173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) at concentrations of <50 μm but does not inhibit MEK3, MEK4, MEK6, MEK7, protein kinase Cα, protein kinase A, PDK1, or other tested serine/threonine kinases (24Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3957) Google Scholar). We have previously found that at concentrations of 10–20 μm, U0126 does not alter HGF-mediated c-Met or Gab1 tyrosine-phosphorylation or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation (25Yu C.F. Roshan B. Liu Z.X. Cantley L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32552-32558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The pretreatment of mIMCD-3 cells with U0126 completely prevented HGF-induced ERK1/ERK2 phosphorylation (Fig. 2 A, middle panel) and eliminated the HGF-induced paxillin gel shift (Fig.2 A, upper panel). Of note, ERK activation does not appear to play a role in the HGF-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin, because both the 68 and 70 kDa forms of paxillin are tyrosine-phosphorylated (Fig. 2B, lane 3), and the inhibition of ERK activation did not prevent tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin (Fig. 2 B, lane 4). These results suggest that HGF can induce both tyrosine and serine/threonine phosphorylation of paxillin, and that the latter occurs downstream of ERK1/ERK2 activation. The ability of HGF to induce ERK-paxillin association and subsequent ERK phosphorylation of paxillin was then examined. To determine whether HGF stimulation can induce ERK-paxillin association, mIMCD-3 cells were stimulated with HGF for 10 min followed by pull-down assay using GST-NH2-paxillin, a GST fusion protein containing amino-terminal paxillin amino acids 1–323, excluding the carboxyl-terminal LIM domains. In cells stimulated with HGF, GST-NH2-paxillin associated with phosphorylated ERK, whereas equal amounts of a control GST construct failed to bring down active ERK (Fig. 3 A,left panel). Immunoprecipitation of native paxillin from HGF-stimulated mIMCD-3 cells confirmed the observation that HGF stimulation results in the association of paxillin and phosphorylated ERK2 with a lesser association detected between paxillin and phosphorylated ERK1 (Fig. 3 A, right panel). The possibility that this association of activated ERK and paxillin results in paxillin phosphorylation was investigated by immunoprecipitation of paxillin from mIMCD-3 cells followed by anin vitro kinase assay with purified active ERK2. In agreement with the results of Ku and Meier (26Ku H. Meier K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11333-11340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) who have recently shown that ERK can phosphorylate paxillin in thymoma cells, paxillin immunoprecipitated from control mIMCD-3 cells was heavily phosphorylated by ERK in vitro (Fig. 3 B,lane 3). In contrast, paxillin immunoprecipitated from cells that had been stimulated with HGF exhibited an 80% decrease in the level of in vitro phosphorylation by purified active ERK (Fig. 3 B, lane 1, quantitated in Fig.3 C), suggesting that the ERK phosphorylation sites on paxillin were already occupied. This decreased in vitrophosphorylation of paxillin by ERK following HGF stimulation in vivo was prevented by pretreatment of the cells with U0126 (Fig.3 B, lane 2), demonstrating that it is dependent on ERK activation in the intact cells. Immunoblotting of the membrane with anti-paxillin was performed to determine the amount of paxillin immunoprecipitated (Fig. 3 B, lower panel). Of note, the HGF-induced gel retardation of paxillin is not seen in this immunoblot due to the shorter time of electrophoresis of the radioactive gel. These data are most consistent with an HGF-mediated ERK-dependent phosphorylation of paxillin in vivo. An examination of the sequence of paxillin using the ScanSite protein motif identification program (27Yaffe M.B. Leparc G.G. Lai J. Obata T. Volinia S. Cantley L.C. Nature Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar) reveals several probable ERK phosphorylation sites contained in the NH2 terminus of the protein. To demonstrate whether ERK can phosphorylate the amino terminus of paxillin, an in vitro kinase assay was performed with GST-NH2-paxillin as substrate. ERK incubation with GST-NH2-paxillin induced in vitrophosphorylation of the protein detectable within 1 min by both autoradiography and retardation of gel mobility (Fig. 3 D). By 30–60 min, essentially all of the paxillin had undergone a mobility shift, and a third band of even slower gel mobility, presumably representing a second phosphorylation site, had appeared. The potential ERK phosphorylation sites in paxillin flank the LD2 and LD4 domains that mediate association of paxillin with FAK (28Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1109-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar,29Tachibana K. Sato T. D'Avirro N. Morimoto C. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1089-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether HGF could regulate the association of FAK and paxillin. Immunoprecipitation of paxillin from subconfluent mIMCD-3 cells followed by immunoblotting with FAK revealed that in control cells there was a low level of FAK in anti-paxillin immunoprecipitates, whereas following stimulation with HGF there was a marked increase in the FAK-paxillin association (Fig.4 A, left panel). The same result was detected in paxillin immunoblots of anti-FAK immunoprecipitates from subconfluent mIMCD-3 cells (Fig.4 B). Interestingly, in fully confluent mIMCD-3 cells, the level of FAK-paxillin association was increased compared with that seen in subconfluent cells, and under these conditions HGF stimulation caused only a modest increase in FAK-paxillin association (data not shown). The dependence of the HGF-mediated association of paxillin and FAK on cell confluence suggests that cell-cell contact might be an independent regulator of this process. To determine whether the HGF-mediated increase in paxillin-FAK association required activation of the MAPK pathway, we examined FAK-paxillin co-immunoprecipitation in mIMCD-3 cells stimulated with HGF in the presence of U0126. In both anti-paxillin (Fig.4 A, left panel) and anti-FAK (Fig. 4 B) immunoprecipitates, the inhibition of HGF-dependent ERK activation eliminated the HGF-stimulated increase in paxillin-FAK association. The possibility that ERK-mediated paxillin phosphorylation was directly responsible for the HGF-dependent increase in paxillin-FAK association was examined using GST-NH2-paxillin that had been phosphorylated by ERKin vitro to perform pull-down assays from unstimulated mIMCD-3 cell lysates. Although non-phosphorylated GST-NH2-paxillin was capable of associating with FAK in these experiments, there was a marked increase in the pull-down assay of FAK when GST-NH2-paxillin had been first phosphorylated using active ERK (Fig. 4 A, right panel). Because HGF can induce tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK (Fig. 1) (5Nebe B. Sanftleben H. Pommerenke H. Peters A. Rychly J. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 243: 263-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 6Beviglia L. Kramer R.H. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 83: 640-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and paxillin-FAK association has been shown to result in the recruitment of FAK to focal adhesion complexes where it is activated, we also examined the possibility that HGF-mediated paxillin-FAK association is necessary for FAK phosphorylation. The inhibition of paxillin-FAK association by pretreatment with U0126 was found to diminish the HGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK observed in newly plated mIMCD-3 cells (Fig. 4 C). Thus, HGF induces ERK-dependent association of paxillin and FAK, and this association appears to be important for the HGF-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK. In contrast, the HGF-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin was not inhibited by U0126 (Fig. 2 B), suggesting that a tyrosine kinase other than FAK is mediating this phosphorylation. Indeed, preliminary experiments with the src inhibitor PP1 reveal marked inhibition of the HGF-dependent paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation (data not shown). The subcellular location of HGF-mediated paxillin-FAK association was then examined using confocal microscopy. Control cells adherent to glass coverslips were rounded in shape, and paxillin was primarily distributed in discreet focal adhesion complexes at the cell periphery, whereas FAK was distributed both in a perinuclear reticular pattern and at low levels at the cell periphery (Fig.5, upper panel). In contrast, cells stimulated with HGF for 10 or 30 min revealed an elongated phenotype with process formation. In these cells, focal adhesion complexes appeared to condense at the leading edges of the cell processes with FAK-paxillin co-localization at these sites (Fig.5, middle panel). Treatment with U0126 before HGF stimulation inhibited cell process formation and resulted in a pattern of FAK and paxillin localization similar to that seen in control cells (Fig. 5, lower panel). We have recently demonstrated that HGF mediates more rapid adhesion of mIMCD-3 cells on several substrates including fibronectin, type 1 collagen, and plastic (8Liu Z.X. Nickel C.H. Cantley L.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: F62-F70PubMed Google Scholar). The potential importance of FAK in this phenotype has been demonstrated by Richardsonet al. (30Richardson A. Malik R.K. Hildebrand J.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6906-6914Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) who have shown that expression of FAK-related non-kinase inhibits paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation and cell spreading as well as Lai and co-workers (31Lai J.F. Kao S.C. Jiang S.T. Tang M.J. Chan P.C. Chen H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7474-7480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) who have shown that the expression of FAK-related non-kinase inhibits HGF-induced Madin-Darby canine kidney cell spreading and migration. To investigate whether HGF-mediated cell adhesion involves enhanced cell spreading and whether regulation of the paxillin-FAK association is important for this phenotype, we examined the effect of inhibition of ERK activation on HGF-dependent mIMCD-3 cell adhesion. mIMCD-3 cells plated for 30 min in the presence of HGF exhibited a 32% increase in adhesion as compared with control cells, an effect that was completely inhibited by pretreatment with U0126 (Fig.6 A). Microscopy of the adherent cells revealed that cells treated with HGF had begun to flatten and spread as compared with control cells, and that the inhibition of ERK activation prevented HGF-mediated cell spreading (Fig. 6 B). These results are consistent with our prior observation that HGF does not alter initial cell attachment at 10 min but rather induces increased adhesion at 30 and 60 min (the time when cell spreading occurs) and suggest that ERK-mediated paxillin-FAK association is likely to be an important determinant of HGF-dependent epithelial cell spreading and adhesion. In conclusion, we have made the novel observation that HGF induces not only an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of the focal adhesion complex protein paxillin but that paxillin is also phosphorylated in an ERK-dependent manner and this phosphorylation regulates the association of paxillin and FAK. This ERK-dependent regulation of paxillin in turn appears to be critical for the HGF-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and for HGF-induced cell spreading and adhesion."
https://openalex.org/W2069727672,"Tristetraprolin (TTP), the prototype of a small family of CCCH tandem zinc finger (TZF) domain proteins, is a physiological stimulator of instability of the mRNAs encoding tumor necrosis factor-α and granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor in certain cell types. TTP stimulates mRNA turnover after binding to class II AU-rich elements (AREs) within the 3′-untranslated regions of both mRNAs. In turn, this binding is dependent upon the key CCCH residues in the TZF domain. To evaluate other primary sequence requirements for ARE binding in this novel mRNA-binding domain, we mutated many of the conserved residues within the TZF domain of human TTP and evaluated the effects of these mutations on RNA binding in a cell-free system and TTP-induced mRNA instability in cell transfection experiments. These mutations revealed a number of conserved amino acids that were required for binding and begin to define the primary protein sequence requirements for this novel mRNA-binding motif. Unexpectedly, all of the point mutations that prevented TTP binding to RNA also caused an increase in steady-state levels of ARE-containing mRNAs in cell transfection experiments. Actinomycin D experiments suggested that this effect was due to inhibition of mRNA turnover. Although expression of the mutant form of TTP could also inhibit the destruction of tumor necrosis factor-α mRNA by wild-type TTP, the primary mechanism did not involve heterodimerization with wild-type TTP because the 293 cells used in these studies express no detectable endogenous TTP. These data suggest that TTP may act, at least in part, by physically interacting with an enzyme activity or protein complex and functionally stimulating its ability to deadenylate class II ARE-containing mRNAs.

A small subset of these proteins contain two CCCH zinc fingers with the following characteristics.

We will refer to this small group of proteins as the CCCH tandem zinc finger (TZF)1 domain proteins. Our group has begun to elucidate a function for this group of proteins by analyzing the phenotype of mice deficient in tristetraprolin (TTP), the prototype of this group of proteins. These animals develop a complex phenotype consisting of cachexia, dermatitis, conjunctivitis, destructive arthritis, myeloid hyperplasia, and autoimmunity (14Taylor G.A. Carballo E. Lee D.M. Lai W.S.

Virtually all aspects of this phenotype can be prevented by the repeated injection of antibodies to tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), implicating an effective excess of circulating TNFα in the pathogenesis of this condition (14Taylor G.A. Carballo E. Lee D.M. Lai W.S. Thompson M.J. Patel D.D. Schenkman D.I. Gilkeson G.S. Broxmeyer H.E. Haynes B.F. Blackshear P.J. Immunity. 1996; 4: 445-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). This was confirmed by studies showing that the phenotype can be largely prevented by interbreeding the TTP knockout mice with mice lacking both types of TNFα receptors (15Carballo E. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Blood. 2000; 95: 1891-1899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Carballo E. Blackshear P.J. Blood. 2001; 98: 2389-2395Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Macrophages derived from the knockout mice elaborate more TNFα into the culture medium than do macrophages from control animals, and this increased secretion is accompanied by increased accumulation of TNFα mRNA in the cells (17Carballo E. Gilkeson G.S. Blackshear P.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 986-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). TNFα mRNA is markedly stabilized in the cells from the TTP-deficient animals (18Carballo E. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings implicate TTP as a stimulator of TNFα mRNA turnover in normal macrophage physiology. More recently, in similar experiments in bone marrow-derived stromal cells, we showed that TTP exerts a similar, physiological effect on the stability of the mRNA encoding a second cytokine, granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (15Carballo E. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Blood. 2000; 95: 1891-1899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of this growth factor may contribute to the myeloid hyperplasia characteristic of the TTP knockout phenotype (16Carballo E. Blackshear P.J. Blood. 2001; 98: 2389-2395Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The mechanism of the effect of TTP on TNFα and GM-CSF mRNA stability is not understood. TTP can bind directly to the so-called class II AU-rich elements (AREs) in the TNFα and GM-CSF mRNA 3′-untranslated regions (18Carballo E. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This binding is dependent on the integrity of each of the two zinc fingers in that mutation of a single cysteine to arginine in either zinc finger completely abrogates binding of TTP to these ARE probes (19Lai W.S. Carballo E. Strum J.R. Kennington E.A. Phillips R.S. Blackshear P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4311-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). In transfection experiments in 293 cells, TTP caused the accelerated breakdown of TNFα and GM-CSF mRNAs, and non-binding mutants failed to exert this effect (19Lai W.S. Carballo E. Strum J.R. Kennington E.A. Phillips R.S. Blackshear P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4311-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). These data indicate that the first and possibly rate-limiting step in TTP action on class II ARE-containing mRNAs is direct binding to the AREs, followed by stimulation of deadenylation and subsequent further destruction of the mRNA body. We have begun to explore the structure-function relationships between the primary sequence of the TZF domain and mRNA binding. Apparently normal binding still occurs when the TTP protein is truncated to a 77-amino acid fragment containing the TZF domain and seven flanking residues on either side (20Lai W.S. Carballo E. Thorn J.M. Kennington E.A. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17827-17837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). By investigating the binding of RNA to TZF domains from various CCCH proteins, we have begun to characterize the extent of natural variation that can be tolerated and still maintain RNA-binding activity (20Lai W.S.

In the present study, we have extended these findings by generating and testing a series of site-directed mutants of the TTP TZF domain. Unexpectedly, all of the non-binding mutants shared the ability to inhibit the initial step, presumably deadenylation, in the breakdown of class II ARE-containing mRNAs. The expression plasmids CMV.mTNFα-(127–1325), CMV.mTNFα-(1–1627), CMV.mGM-CSF, and CMV.mIL-3 have been described previously (19Lai W.S. Carballo E. Strum J.R. Kennington E.A. Phillips R.S.

The TTP zinc finger mutants of expression plasmid CMV.hTTP.tag were made by the PCR primer-overlapping mutagenesis technique (21Lai W.S. Thompson M.J. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 506-517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Correct sequences of all intended mutations were confirmed by dRhodamine Terminator Cycle sequencing (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The numbering system for the TTP mutants followed the GenBankTM/EBI RefSeq for TTP (accession number NP_003398). Human embryonic kidney 293 cells (referred to as 293 cells) were maintained, and transient transfection of 1.2 × 106cells with plasmid constructs in calcium phosphate precipitates was performed as described (20Lai W.S.

In some experiments, pXGH5 (Nichols Institute Diagnostics, San Juan Capistrano, CA) was cotransfected to monitor transfection efficiency. Assays of released human growth hormone were performed as described (22Lai W.S. Thompson M.J. Taylor G.A. Liu Y. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25266-25272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In most experiments, the cells were cotransfected with various CCCH protein-expressing plasmids. Details of the construction of these plasmids have been described (19Lai W.S. Carballo E. Strum J.R. Kennington E.A. Phillips R.S. Blackshear P.J. Mol. Cell.

Twenty-four h after the removal of the transfection mixture, aliquots of the cell culture medium were analyzed for human growth hormone as described above. Total cellular RNA was then harvested from the 293 cells using the RNeasy system (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA). Northern blots were prepared as described (1Lai W.S. Stumpo D.J. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16556-16563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Blots were hybridized as indicated with a random-primed, α-32P-labeled cDNA probe of mouse TTP (1Lai W.S. Stumpo D.J.

Some blots were also hybridized with an α-32P-labeled GAPDH cDNA probe (17Carballo E. Gilkeson G.S. Blackshear P.J. J. Clin.

Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4311-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar) to monitor gel loading. Plasmid pTNFα-(1309–1332) (bp 1309–1332 of GenBankTM/EBI accession number X02611) was constructed as described (19Lai W.S. Carballo E. Strum J.R. Kennington E.A. Phillips R.S. Blackshear P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4311-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Plasmid pGM-CSF-ARE (bp 3399–3453 of GenBankTM/EBI accession number X03020), containing the ARE in the mGM-CSF 3′-untranslated region (5′-AUUUAUUUAUAUAUUUAUAUUUUUUAAAUAUUUAUUUAUUUAUUUAUUUAUUUUU-3′), was constructed by inserting double-stranded oligonucleotides into the EcoRV-XbaI cloning sites of pSK−. Correct sequences of all plasmid inserts were confirmed by dRhodamine Terminator Cycle sequencing. To label RNA transcripts with [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol), the above plasmids linearized with XbaI were used as templates, and the Promega riboprobe in vitro transcription system protocol was employed. The resulting products were separated from the free nucleotides through Sephadex G-50 columns. Cytosolic extracts were prepared from 293 cells transfected with plasmids expressing hTTP, mutant zinc finger proteins, or vector. Cross-linking assays were performed using extracts (5 μg of protein) incubated with 1.5 × 106 cpm of RNA probe as described (19Lai W.S. Carballo E. Strum J.R. Kennington E.A. Phillips R.S.

Membranes were incubated in Tris-buffered saline and 0.3% Tween 20 with polyclonal antiserum HA.11 (1:10,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Cytosolic extracts prepared from 293 cells transfected with either vector alone or expression constructs driven by the CMV promoter (5 μg of protein) were incubated with 2 × 105 cpm of RNA probe as described (19Lai W.S.

In addition to the key CCCH amino acids in the CX 8CX 5CX 3H tandem zinc finger motifs, there are many conserved amino acids within the TZF domains in members of the CCCH protein family (Fig.1). To begin to evaluate the importance of these conserved amino acids for the ability of TTP to promote ARE binding and class II ARE-containing mRNA degradation, we evaluated point mutants of these conserved amino acids in the CMV.hTTP.tag construct. We showed previously that a single Cys-to-Arg mutation in either the first (C124R) or second (C147R) zinc finger of hTTP (using the numbering system shown in Fig. 1) prevents binding of the mutant protein to the TNFα AREs (19Lai W.S. Carballo E. Strum J.R. Kennington E.A. Phillips R.S. Blackshear P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4311-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). In the present study, we mutated the remaining CCCH residues in both fingers. Mutations of any one of these residues made TTP unable to bind to a TNFα mRNA ARE probe in a gel mobility shift assay (Fig.2 A, lanes 2–8), including mutants in which the third Cys in each finger was changed to His at position 124 or 162 of hTTP (lanes 3 and7). The lack of RNA binding seen with this collection of mutants was also demonstrated using a probe representing the other known physiological target of TTP, the GM-CSF mRNA AREs (Fig.2 B). The roughly equivalent expression of proteins from these mutant TTP expression constructs is demonstrated in the Western blot shown in Fig. 2 C.Figure 2Binding of hTTP and CCCH zinc finger mutant proteins to the TNFα and GM-CSF mRNA AREs. In A–C, cytosolic extracts were prepared from 293 cells transfected with either vector alone (BS+; 5 μg/plate) (lane 1) or constructs expressing wild-type hTTP (Wt) and various CCCH zinc finger mutant proteins (C124R, etc., as indicated; 0.1 μg of DNA/plate, together with 4.9 μg of vector DNA/plate) (lanes 2–8) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” For A and B, electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed with these extracts. Cell extracts (5 μg of protein/lane) were incubated with 2 × 105 cpm of a TNFα (A) or GM-CSF (B) ARE probe. P′, probe alone (RNase T1-digested). The migration positions of the TTP-probe complexes (TTP), RNA-protein complexes I–III formed with endogenous 293 cell proteins, and free probes (FP) are indicated. InC, cell extracts prepared from 293 cells as described above were analyzed by Western blotting using a polyclonal antibody to the epitope tag of the fusion proteins, and the position of the epitope-tagged TTP protein is indicated. The positions of molecular weight standards are indicated to the left of the gel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Using similar techniques, we identified several additional mutations of conserved residues that completely abrogated binding to both the TNFα and GM-CSF ARE probes. For example, within the CX 3H interval of the cognate hTTP zinc fingers (see Fig. 1), the aromatic amino acid Phe at cognate positions 126 and 164 is conserved in all of the vertebrate CCCH family tandem zinc finger proteins shown in Fig. 1. Substitution with Tyr at either position had little or no effect on TTP binding to the two ARE probes (Fig. 3, A and B,lanes 3 and 6). However, when Phe at either position was replaced with a non-aromatic amino acid such as Asn or Leu, ARE-binding activity was abolished (Fig. 3, A andB, lanes 4, 5, and 7). The comparable expression of the mutant TTP proteins is documented in the Western blot shown in Fig. 3 C, and the positions of the cognate Phe residues that were mutated in this experiment are shown in Fig. 3 D. We next tested whether the ability of a given mutant to bind to the TNFα and GM-CSF AREs correlated with its ability to promote the degradation of TNFα mRNA in 293 cell transfection studies. As expected from our previous studies (23Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23144-23154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), coexpression of low concentrations of wild-type TTP with the TNF expression plasmid led to the essentially complete destruction of the full-length TNFα mRNA, with accumulation of the deadenylated form of the transcript at higher TTP concentrations (Fig. 4 A, lanes 1–3). However, when similar concentrations of the C124R mutant were coexpressed with the TNFα cDNA, there was an unexpectedincrease in steady-state TNFα mRNA levels, as well as the absence of conversion of the mRNA to the deadenylated form (Fig. 4 A, lanes 5 and 6). When data from five similar experiments were averaged after normalization for RNA loading with GAPDH mRNA, as in Fig.4 A (middle panel), the mean increase in TNFα mRNA accumulation at 0.01 and 0.1 μg of transfected C124R mutant TTP DNA was to 200 and 406% of controls, respectively. The amount of expressed mutant TTP mRNA that resulted from these transfections is shown in Fig. 4 A (lower panel); as with the wild-type TTP vector, the mutant mRNA levels correlated closely with protein expression (19Lai W.S. Carballo E. Strum J.R. Kennington E.A. Phillips R.S. Blackshear P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4311-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). To determine whether the other non-binding mutations in TTP would have a similar effect on TNFα mRNA accumulation, the effect of wild-type TTP expression was compared with that of mutants of the key cysteine and histidine residues in the TZF domain, including C124H, C124R, H128K, C147R, C162H, and H166L, all transfected at 0.1 μg of DNA (Fig. 4 B). Compared with the typical effect of wild-type TTP (Fig. 4 B, upper panel, lane 2), in which most of the TNFα mRNA had been truncated to the deadenylated form (see Ref. 19Lai W.S. Carballo E. Strum J.R. Kennington E.A. Phillips R.S. Blackshear P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4311-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar), the six non-binding TTP mutants (lanes 3–8) caused the increased accumulation of the full-length TNFα mRNA; after correcting for transfection efficiency and RNA loading, the increases in TNFα mRNA levels in this experiment were to 470, 514, 537, 430, 320, and 440% of controls, respectively. The levels of the GAPDH mRNA, used as a gel loading control, and of the expressed normal and mutant TTP mRNAs are indicated in Fig. 4 B (middle and lower panels, respectively). Similar increases in the levels of the TNFα mRNA were seen with all other constructs tested that expressed non-binding mutants of TTP, including those that involved mutations of amino acids other than the key cysteine and histidine residues. For example, as shown in Fig.4 C, the phenylalanine mutants at cognate residues 126 and 164 within the CX 3H domain that bound the AREs normally were able to promote the degradation of the cotransfected TNFα mRNA (lanes 1–3, 6, 7,10, and 11), whereas the non-binding mutants of the same residues also promoted the accumulation of the fully adenylated TNFα transcript (lanes 4, 5,8, and 9). This increased accumulation of the TNF mRNA was seen with all non-binding mutants tested. The effects of all of the mutations tested on ARE binding in the cell-free assay, as well as their ability to promote TNFα mRNA breakdown in transfected 293 cells, are summarized in Table I. To date, there has been a perfect correlation between the ability of a TTP mutant to bind to an ARE probe and its ability to promote TNFα mRNA degradation in the cell transfection experiments. In addition, all of the non-binding mutants tested to date have promoted an increased accumulation of TNFα mRNA (Table I).Table ISummary of point mutant effects on TTP binding to an ARE probe and destabilizing an ARE-containing mRNAIntervalAmino acid changeARE bindingDecrease TNFα mRNA?Increase TNFα mRNA?CX 8CR110E(L)++++++H148E(L)++++++++F112Y++++++++F112Q++++F150Y++++++++G116E+++++++G154K++++++++R117E(L)++++++++R155L++++++++C147R00YesCX5CY120F++++++++Y158E00YesY158Q00YesG121T(R)++++G159A(E)(K)++++K123D++++++++R161L++C124H(R)00YesC162H00YesCX3HF126Y++++++++F126N00YesF164Y++++++++F164L00YesH128K00YesH166L00YesThese data summarize the results from three to four individual experiments. “Interval” represents the distance between each of two key amino acids in the two CCCH motifs, and X represents any amino acid. “Amino acid change” refers to the results of mutations encoding conserved amino acids of the CCCH motifs, as illustrated in Fig. 1. “ARE binding” means the ability of expressed hTTP mutants to bind to a GM-CSF mRNA ARE probe as assessed by gel mobility shift assays.

One limitation of the previous experiments is the use of an artificially truncated form of the TNFα mRNA, in which a synthetic 33-residue poly(A) tail is attached directly to a shortened version of the AREs (19Lai W.S. Carballo E. Strum J.R. Kennington E.A. Phillips R.S. Blackshear P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4311-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). To address this issue, as well as the specificity of the effect on the TNFα mRNA, we coexpressed the wild-type and mutant forms of TTP with three full-length mRNAs containing well known class II AREs, those encoding TNFα, GM-CSF, and IL-3 (Fig.5). 293 cells do not express detectable levels of these mRNAs. As seen with the truncated construct, coexpression of mutant TTP with a full-length TNFα mRNA resulted in its increased accumulation (Fig. 5 A, upper panel). Coexpression of a full-length GM-CSF mRNA with wild-type TTP caused the concentration-dependent disappearance of the GM-CSF mRNA (Fig. 5 B, upper panel, lanes 3–5); however, when the GM-CSF mRNA was coexpressed with the TTP zinc finger mutant C124R, there were markedly increased accumulations of GM-CSF mRNA that corresponded to the increased amount of transfected mutant TTP DNA (lanes 6–8). The results obtained from coexpression of full-length IL-3 mRNA with wild-type TTP and its zinc finger mutant C124R were very similar to those described for GM-CSF (Fig. 5 C). At 0.01–1 μg of cotransfected TTP DNA, the IL-3 mRNA almost completely disappeared (Fig. 5 C, lanes 3–5). When the cells were cotransfected with increasing amounts (0.01–0.1 μg) of the C124R mutant form of TTP (Fig. 5 C, lanes 6–8), there was a concentration-dependent increase in the accumulation of the IL-3 mRNA. In Fig. 5 (A–C), the expression of GAPDH mRNA and of the wild-type and mutant TTP mRNAs is shown in the middle and lower panels, respectively. To begin to address the mechanism by which the non-binding mutants caused increased accumulation of ARE-containing mRNAs, we determined whether the presence of a non-binding TTP mutant affected the stability of the TNFα mRNA in 293 cells by transfecting 1 μg of DNA from the CMV.mTNFα vector into the cells and then exposing them to 0.01 mg/ml actinomycin D 48 h later. TNFα mRNA levels were quantitated at 0, 4, and 8 h after actinomycin D addition (Fig. 6). PhosphorImager values for TNFα mRNA levels were corrected for gel loading by PhosphorImager analysis of cyclophilin mRNA (Fig. 6,lower panel) and for transfection efficiency by a cotransfected human growth hormone plasmid (19Lai W.S. Carballo E. Strum J.R. Kennington E.A. Phillips R.S. Blackshear P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4311-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Under these conditions in 293 cells, the TNFα mRNA was relatively stable, with a half-life of ∼9 h (Fig. 6, lanes 1–3). In the presence of the coexpressed C124R TTP mutant, there was a marked increase in steady-state levels of TNFα mRNA to ∼3-fold of controls (mean of two experiments) (Fig. 6, compare lane 4with lane 1). When these cells were exposed to actinomycin D, the TNFα mRNA half-life was increased 3-fold to ∼28 h (Fig.6, lanes 4–6). These data indicate that expression of the non-binding TTP mutant caused an increase in the stability of the TNFα mRNA after actinomycin D treatment. To evaluate the influence of the non-binding TTP mutants on the effects of wild-type TTP, we used a TTP-green fluorescent protein fusion protein (TTP-GFP) that can stimulate normally the breakdown of TNFα mRNA in the 293 cell transfection system and that can be cross-linked normally to a TNFα mRNA ARE probe (19Lai W.S. Carballo E. Strum J.R. Kennington E.A. Phillips R.S. Blackshear P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4311-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). The larger size of the resulting fusion mRNA and protein allows them to be distinguished from the corresponding mutant TTP mRNA and protein. In this experiment, cotransfection of the TNFα expression construct with 0.1 μg of the C124R mutant resulted in the usual marked increase in TNFα mRNA expression (Fig. 7, compare lane 2 with lane 1), and expression of wild-type TTP had its usual dose-dependent effect to degrade the TNFα mRNA, with accumulation of the deadenylated form of the mRNA (lanes 3–5). The TTP-GFP fusion protein had an effect similar to that of native TTP (Fig. 7, lanes 6–8). When either wild-type TTP (hTTP) or the TTP-GFP fusion protein (hTTP-G) was coexpressed with 0.1 μg of the C124R mutant construct, there were clear increases in the accumulation of TNFα mRNA (Fig. 7,lanes 9–14) at all concentrations of TTP and TTP-GFP tested. For example, compare lane 9 with lane 3and lane 12 with lane 6. Thus, the C124R mutant construct appeared to inhibit the TTP-induced destruction of the TNFα mRNA, even though it did not interfere significantly with the “protective” effect of higher concentrations of TTP to increase the accumulation of the shorter, deadenylated TNFα mRNA species (see Ref. 19Lai W.S. Carballo E. Strum J.R. Kennington E.A. Phillips R.S. Blackshear P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4311-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). The expression of the various TTP mRNAs in this experiment is shown in Fig. 7 (lower panel); note that the wild-type and mutant TTP mRNAs are of identical size and are thus superimposed in lanes 9–11. We also tested whether coexpression of the C124R mutant with the wild-type protein in the same cells interfered with binding to the ARE probe (Fig. 8). In this situation, at concentrations (0.05–0.1 μg of DNA) that were optimal for causing increased TNFα mRNA accumulation in these cells, there was no apparent interference by the mutant protein in the binding of wild-type TTP to the ARE probe (Fig. 8, lanes 4 and 5), assayed in this case by UV-cross-linking of the protein to the ARE probe. At higher concentrations of C124R DNA, there was a modest decrease in the binding of wild-type TTP to the ARE probe (Fig. 8,lanes 6 and 7). However, when the identical experiment was performed using the TTP-GFP fusion protein, there was no apparent effect of the TTP mutant to interfere with cross-linking of the fusion protein to the ARE probe (Fig. 8, lanes 8–12). The principal finding of the studies described here is that certain mutant derivatives of TTP that are incapable of binding to the AREs of the TNFα and GM-CSF mRNAs exert an inhibitory effect on the turnover of these mRNAs. It is generally accepted that the destruction of mRNAs containing class II AREs is accomplished by initial deadenylation to essential completion, followed by destruction of the remaining mRNA body (24Chen C.Y. Xu N. Shyu A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5777-5788Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 25Xu N. Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4611-4621Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 26Wilusz C.J. Wormington M. Peltz S.W. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). The inhibitory mutants described in this study appear to inhibit the initial step in this destruction process, that of deadenylation. This is in keeping with previous data indicating that the primary effect of wild-type TTP in this experimental system, and presumably in normal cellular physiology, is to stimulate the initial deadenylation of class II ARE-containing mRNAs (19Lai W.S. Carballo E. Strum J.R. Kennington E.A. Phillips R.S. Blackshear P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4311-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). The fact that TTP mutants that are incapable of RNA binding not only are ineffective at stimulating breakdown of class II ARE-containing mRNAs, but also appear to protect these from deadenylation and subsequent destruction in intact cells, suggests that strategies directed at discovering factors interacting with the mutants might lead to elucidation of the mode of action of TTP. How might this inhibitory effect of the non-binding mutant forms of TTP be accomplished? One potential mechanism is the formation of heterodimers with wild-type TTP, thus preventing it from binding to the mRNA in a stoichiometric fashion. However, the inhibitory effect of the mutant proteins was observed in the complete absence of transfected or endogenous wild-type TTP; in other words, there was no normal TTP present to inactivate by this means. In addition, there was no apparent inhibition of TTP binding to the TNFα or GM-CSF mRNA AREs by the mutant proteins in cell-free direct binding and cross-linking assays. A second possible mechanism is suggested by the facts that all of the inhibitory mutants examined were incapable of binding to the TNFα or GM-CSF mRNA AREs and that, conversely, every known non-binding mutant acts in a similar inhibitory fashion at equivalent amounts of transfected DNA. This means that these mutants could not be inhibiting deadenylation by binding to and blocking the AREs. Instead, the data raise the interesting possibility that the mutant forms of TTP can inhibit mRNA breakdown by interacting with a protein or proteins responsible for promoting or inhibiting this activity. Candidate proteins for this putative interaction include poly(A)-binding proteins, ARE-binding proteins, deadenylating enzymes, and others, perhaps in a multimeric complex. After actinomycin D treatment of 293 cells expressing the TNFα mRNA, the rate of conversion (R 1) of the fully adenylated form of TNFα mRNA to its deadenylated intermediate must be appreciably slower than the rate of degradation (R 2) of the deadenylated intermediate because there was no detectable accumulation of this intermediate under these conditions in the absence of TTP. We have calculated the half-life of the TNFα mRNA to be ∼9 h under these conditions (Fig. 6). At low concentrations of transfected wild-type TTP DNA (e.g. 5 and 10 ng) (Fig. 4, lanes 2 and 3),R 1 must increase so that it is approximately equal to R 2 because neither the fully polyadenylated nor the deadenylated form of TNFα mRNA accumulates significantly. However, at higher concentrations of transfected wild-type TTP (e.g. 0.1 and 1 μg) (Fig. 4, lane 4; and Fig. 7, lanes 4 and 5), the smaller, deadenylated form of TNFα mRNA accumulates, indicating thatR 1 is significantly greater thanR 2 under these conditions. This accumulation of the smaller, deadenylated form of the TNFα mRNA was largely unaffected by the presence of any concentration of mutant TTP (Fig. 7). These data indicate that the inhibitory forms of TTP had little if any effect on the rate of degradation (R 2) of the deadenylated TNFα mRNA body, which was inhibited in its characteristic fashion by concentrations of wild-type TTP DNA of 0.1 and 1 μg whether the non-binding mutant was present or not. Thus, the effect of the TTP mutants to cause accumulation of the larger, fully adenylated form of TNFα mRNA appears to be limited to an effect on the rate of conversion (R 1) of the adenylated to the deadenylated form of this mRNA. This suggests, in turn, that the effect of high concentrations of wild-type TTP to cause accumulation of the smaller form of TNFα mRNA is due to an inhibitory effect on the degradation of the mRNA body, either by binding to and stabilizing the body or by inhibiting the action of one or more endo- or exonucleases. Our previous studies have identified TTP and its related proteins as RNA-binding proteins, with apparent specificity for the class II AREs, and have established the TZF domain as the domain responsible for the RNA binding. These studies have established the TZF domain as a novel RNA-binding motif and have demonstrated that disruption of the tandem zinc fingers by mutations of the key cysteine or histidine residues completely abrogates RNA binding. The present studies have extended these observations by beginning to establish the primary sequence requirements for the ARE-binding activity of this novel motif, particularly regarding replacement of highly conserved residues within the C–C and C–H intervals. These and further studies should help establish the key amino acids within these intervals for binding to the known TTP physiological targets, the TNFα and GM-CSF mRNA AREs, as well as perhaps TTP-specific residues that differentiate its binding characteristics from those of other family members. Future studies will continue this exploration of the TZF domain by examining the effects of the spacing among the key cysteine and histidine residues as well as of the interfinger spacing, all of which are exactly conserved in known members of this protein family. The ultimate goals will be a description of the structure of this domain bound to its mRNA target and a description of the mechanism by which these proteins promote destabilization of their target mRNAs.

https://openalex.org/W2025058798,"Abstract The activity of cyclin-dependent kinase-5 (Cdk5) is tightly regulated by binding of its neuronal activators p35 and p39. Upon neurotoxic insults, p35 is cleaved to p25 by the Ca2+-dependent protease calpain. p25 is accumulated in ischemic brains and in brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. p25 deregulates Cdk5 activity by causing prolonged activation and mislocalization of Cdk5. It is unknown whether p39, which is expressed throughout the adult rat brain, is cleaved by calpain, and whether this contributes to deregulation of Cdk5. Here, we show that calpain cleaved p39 in vitro, resulting in generation of a C-terminal p29 fragment. In vivo, p29 was generated in ischemic brain concomitant with increased calpain activity. In fresh brain lysates, generation of p29 was Ca2+-dependent, and calpain inhibitors abolished p29 production. The Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin and the excitotoxin glutamate induced production of p29 in cultures of cortical neurons in a calpain-dependent manner. Like p25, p29 was more stable than p39 and caused redistribution of Cdk5 in cortical neurons. Our data suggest that neurotoxic insults lead to calpain-mediated conversion of p39 to p29, which might contribute to deregulation of Cdk5."

In this study, the mechanisms for PPARα activators-induced up-regulation of UCP2 mRNA, related to TNFα and reactive oxygen species (ROS), were investigated. PPARα activators-induced UCP2 up-regulation in mouse/rat liver tissues was due to their increases in hepatocytes but not in non-parenchymal cells. Addition of PPARα activators, WY14,643 or fenofibrate, to cultured hepatocytes up-regulated UCP2 mRNA by 5–10-fold. PPARα activators-induced up-regulation of UCP2 mRNA was not due to increased mRNA stability and required cycloheximide-sensitive short term turnover protein(s). However, expression of PPARα/retinoid X receptor-α and PGC-1 was not rate-limiting for WY14,643-induced UCP2 up-regulation. In primary hepatocytes, an exogenous oxidant, tert-butyl-hydroperoxide (TBHP), which increased ROS production, up-regulated UCP2 mRNA, whereas WY14,643 treatment did not produce detectable ROS under the condition that fibrate markedly up-regulated UCP2. In in vivo studies, PPARα activators moderately up-regulated TNFα mRNA expression in mouse liver. An anti-oxidant pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate ammonium salt injection completely prevented their TNFα mRNA increases but did not prevent most of their UCP2 mRNA increases.

Samec S. Br. J. Nutr. 2001; 86: 123-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, there are several other hypotheses concerning the physiological roles of UCPs, regulation of fatty acid and glucose oxidation, and reduction of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation (2Boss O. Hagen T. Lowell B.B. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 143-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). UCP2 was expressed in liver tissues, but hepatocytes of the adult rat liver did not express UCP2, although non-parenchymal cells especially Kupffer cells did (3Larrouy D. Laharrague P. Carrera G. Viguerie-Bascands N. Levi-Meyrueis C. Fleury C. Pecqueur C. Nibbelink M. André M. Casteilla L. Ricquier D. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation or lipid emulsions (linoleic or oleic acid) treatment induced UCP2 mRNA accumulation in rat hepatocytes (4Cortez-Pinto H. Yang S.Q. Lin H.Z. Costa S.

Gastroenterology. 1999; 116: 1184-1193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in in vivo mice studies, fatty liver increased UCP2 expression in hepatocytes (6Chavin K.D. Yang S. Lin H.Z. Chatham J. Chacko V.P. Hoek J.B. Walajtys-Rode E. Rashid A. Chen C.-H. Huang C.-C. Wu T.-C. Lane M.D. Diehl A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 26: 5692-5700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (388) Google Scholar). We also have shown that compared with safflower oil feeding, fish oil feeding up-regulated UCP2 by 5-fold and fenofibrate administration also induced UCP2 expression by 9-fold in mouse liver tissues (7Tsuboyama-Kasaoka N. Takahashi M. Kim H. Ezaki O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 879-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Because n-3 fatty acids rich in fish oil and fibrate compounds are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPARα) activators that stimulate β-oxidation of fatty acids in hepatocytes, and because there was no evidence that energy generated by increased oxidation of fatty acids was being channeled into energy-requiring processes, PPARα activators-induced increase of fatty acids oxidation was uncoupled in hepatocytes. In contrast, in rats, PPARα activators did not affect UCP2 mRNA levels when they were measured in whole liver tissues (8Kelly L.J. Vicario P.P. Thompson G.M. Candelore M.R. Doebber T.W. Ventre J. Wu M.S. Meurer R. Forrest M.J. Conner M.W. Cascieri M.A. Moller D.E. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4920-4927Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Because hepatocytes are a major site of β-oxidation of fatty acids, if we assumed that increased UCP2 expression was coupled to this process, UCP2 expression in hepatocytes should be up-regulated in both mice and rats. To answer this question, fish oil or fibrate was administered in rats and mice; hepatocytes and non-parenchymal cells were isolated from liver tissues by collagenase digestion, and UCP2 mRNA levels in each cell fraction were measured. PPARs ligands up-regulate UCP2 in adipocytes and skeletal muscles (9Aubert J. Champigny O. Saint-Marc P. Negrel R. Collins S. Ricquier D. Ailhaud G. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Because in C2C12 cells the overexpression of PGC-1, a coactivator of PPARα and PPARγ, up-regulated UCP2 mRNA in the absence of ligands (14Monsalve M. Wu Z. Adelmant G. Puigserver P. Fan M. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 307-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), it was suggested that PPARα activation was necessary for UCP2 up-regulation in C2C12 cells. However, the PPARα knockout mouse study (15Young M.E. Patil S. Ying J. Depre C. Ahuja H.S. Shipley G.L. Stepkowski S.M. Davies P.J.A. Taegtmeyer H. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 833-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) suggested that cardiac UCP2 expression was regulated via a PPARα-independent mechanism. These data suggested that UCP2 was regulated differently in different types of cells. As for other mechanism(s) for UCP2 up-regulation by PPARs, it has been hypothesized that generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by increased mitochondrial or peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation may lead to up-regulation of UCP2 (16Yang S. Zhu H. Li Y. Lin H. Gabrielson K. Trush M.A. Diehl A.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 378: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). PPARα activators increase in the expression of H2O2-generating peroxisomal fatty acyl-CoA oxidase and microsomal cytochrome P450 4A1 and4A3 genes. Indeed, it has been reported that PPAR activators increased H2O2 production in rat liver tissues (17Goel S.K. Lalwani N.D. Reddy J.K. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 1324-1330PubMed Google Scholar, 18Yeldandi A.V. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. Mutat. Res. 2000; 448: 159-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In agreement with this hypothesis, TNFα stimulation, by which mitochondrial ROS production was increased (19Schuze-Osthoff K. Bakker A.C. Vanhaesebroeck B. Beyaert R. Jacob W.A. Fiers W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5317-5323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Goossens V. De Grooten J. Vos K. Fiers W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8115-8119Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar), up-regulated UCP2 mRNA in primary cultures of hepatocytes (4Cortez-Pinto H. Yang S.Q. Lin H.Z. Costa S. Hwang C.-S. Lane M.D. Bagby G. Diehl A.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). A study of UCP2 promoter analysis revealed that the proximal 3.3 kb of UCP2 promoter contained ROS-sensitive trans-acting factors, including AP-1 and C/EBP, but did not contain a complete NF-κB consensus motif (4Cortez-Pinto H. Yang S.Q. Lin H.Z. Costa S. Hwang C.-S. Lane M.D. Bagby G. Diehl A.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Thus, PPARα as well as TNFα activation increase H2O2 levels and then may up-regulate UCP2 mRNA through ROS-sensitive transacting factors. In relation to PGC-1, TNFα, and ROS, the mechanism(s) of increased UCP2 expression in hepatocytes by PPARα activators were examined. Female C57BL/6L mice (8 weeks of age) and female Sprague-Dawley rats (7 weeks of age) were obtained from Tokyo Animals Science Co. (Tokyo, Japan). The animals were fed standard rodent chow (CE2, CLEA, Japan) for 3–7 days to stabilize the metabolic conditions. Animals were exposed to a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle and were maintained at a constant temperature of 22 °C. In the experiments, C57BL/6J mice were divided into three groups (n = 4 in each group). The first group was a given a high carbohydrate diet, which on a calorie basis contained 63% carbohydrate, 11% fat, and 26% protein. Safflower oil was used as source of fat in the high carbohydrate-fed diet. The second group was given a high safflower oil-rich diet containing 14% carbohydrate, 60% safflower oil, and 26% protein. The third group was given a high fish oil diet containing 14% carbohydrate, 60% fish oil (mainly from tuna), and 26% protein. Fatty acid compositions of dietary oil were subjected to gas-liquid chromatography. Safflower oil (high oleic type) contained 46% oleic acid (18:1 n-9) and 45% linoleic acid (18:2 n-6) from total fatty acids; fish oil contained 7% eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5 n-3) and 23% docosahexaenoic acid (22:6 n-3). In fenofibrate experiments, fenofibrate (Sigma) was mixed in the high carbohydrate diet (0.5%, w/w). The materials and methods of preparation of diet were the same as those used in our previous study (7Tsuboyama-Kasaoka N. Takahashi M. Kim H. Ezaki O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 879-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In rat experiments, Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups as follows: high carbohydrate diet-fed rats, high fish oil diet-fed rats, and fenofibrate administered high carbohydrate-fed rats. Mice and rats were fed each diet for 2 days and were anesthetized at about 10:00 a.m. by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium (0.08 mg/g body weight, Nembutal, Abbott). Isolated hepatocytes and non-parenchymal cells were obtained from mice or rats fed the abovementioned diet using the two-step perfusion collagenase method (21Shimaoka S. Nakamura T. Ichihara A. Exp. Cell Res. 1987; 172: 228-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Briefly, the liver was first perfused in situthrough the portal vein with liver perfusion medium (Invitrogen) at 37 °C for a few minutes. Then it was perfused with liver digest medium containing collagenase (Invitrogen). The resulting liver cell suspension was separated into two fractions, hepatocytes and non-parenchymal cells, by differential centrifugation at 50 ×g for 1 min. Precipitate cells were used as hepatocytes. The supernatants was recentrifuged at 50 × g for 1 min three or four times to remove hepatocytes and were washed twice by centrifugation at 150 × g for 3 min with addition of 10 ml of PBS to obtain a precipitate, which was used as non-parenchymal cells. RNA was prepared from each cellular fraction by TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen). The viability of the isolated rat hepatocytes was over 85% as determined by the trypan blue exclusion test. The hepatocytes were plated at a density of 2 × 106 cells/10-cm plastic dish coated with collagen I (Iwaki, Tokyo) in M199 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 100 nm triiiodothyronine, 100 nm dexamethasone, 1 nm insulin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air. After a 4-h attachment period, the medium was replaced with the same medium without serum and was further incubated for 16 h (22Foretz M. Guichard C. Ferré P. Foufelle F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12737-12742Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). Hepatocytes were transfected with expression vectors encoding mouse PPARα (pNCMV-PPARα), mouse RXRα (pSG5-RXRα), and mouse PGC-1 (pSG5-PGC-1) using Lipofectin (Invitrogen). The expression vectors PPARα and RXRα were kindly provided by Dr. T. Osumi at Himeji Institute of Technology in Japan and Dr. P. Chambon at CNRS INSERM in France, respectively. Complete cDNA of mouse PGC-1 was obtained by PCR from first strand DNA using mouse skeletal muscle total RNA. First strand cDNA was prepared, using first strand cDNA synthesis kit (CLONTECH) primed with oligo(dT). PCR primers used were as follows: 5′ primer, 5′-ATGGCTTGGGACATGTGC-3′, and 3′ primer, 5′-TTACCTGCGCAAGCTTCTCT-3′. PCR was performed with Taq DNA polymerase (Takara, Shiga, Japan). The amplified products were subcloned into pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and verified by sequencing. The complete cDNA of mouse PGC-1 was subcloned into theBamHI-XhoI site in pSG5 vector. Formation of liposome-DNA complexes was carried out by mixing 0.4 μg of each plasmid DNA with Lipofectin to give a Lipofectin-to-DNA ratio of 6:1 (w/w) in 8 ml of medium (23Jump D.B. Clarke S.D. MacDougald O. Thelen A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8454-8458Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Incubation medium of hepatocytes was replaced with this plasmid mixture and incubated for 10 h. Eight ml of medium containing several growth factors, serum and WY14,643 (Calbiochem), was poured into this medium and incubated for further 38 h. Transfection efficiency was estimated by measuring β-galactosidase activity by cotransfection of β-galactosidase expression vector. Nuclear extracts from TNFα- and fenofibrate-treated cells were prepared as described previously (24Rusyn I. Tsukamoto H. Thurman R.G. Carcinogenesis. 1998; 19: 1217-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Hepatocytes (3 × 106 cells/10-cm plastic dish) were washed once with 3 ml of PBS. Cells were scraped into cold PBS and then centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 5 min. The packed cell volume was measured, and 5 volumes of ice-cold hypotonic buffer (10 mmHEPES, pH 7.6, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mmKCl, 0.5 mm DTT) was supplemented with protease inhibitors (40 μg/ml bestatin, 0.5 mm pefabloc, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin) and with phosphatase inhibitors (20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 50 μmNa3VO4, 0.5 mm DTT). These reagents were obtained from Sigma. Cells were swollen on ice for 15 min, and then 0.3% Nonidet P-40 was added. The tube was then mixed vigorously for ∼10 s. The homogenate was centrifuged at 15,000 ×g for 30 s in a microcentrifuge. The supernatant was discarded, and the nuclear pellet was lysed in NUN buffer (17.5 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 1.1 m urea, 0.33m NaCl, 1.1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm DTT) supplemented with proteinase inhibitors. The tubes were then mixed vigorously for 5 s and incubated on ice for 30 min (25Lavery D.J. Schibler U. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1871-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were collected with addition of 10% glycerol, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70 °C prior to experiments. Protein concentration was determined using the micro-BCA assay reagent kit (Pierce) by measuring absorbance spectrophotometrically at 562 nm. NF-κB consensus (GGGGACTTTCCC) and mutant (GGCGACTTTCCC) oligonucleotides were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase. Nuclear extract (10 μg of protein) was incubated at room temperature for 20 min in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mmDTT, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol with 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) and32P-labeled DNA probe (50,000 dpm). Reaction mixtures were separated by electrophoresis on 4.6% polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film at −80 °C. Specificity of NF-κB binding was verified by competition assays, oligonucleotide mutation assay, and ability of specific antibodies to supershift protein-DNA complex. In competition assays, 80-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide was added 10 min before addition of labeled probe. In supershift experiments, 1 μg of goat, rabbit antisera against p50 or p65 protein, respectively (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), was added to the reaction mixture 30 min before addition of labeled probe. To examine the effects of pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate ammonium salt (PDTC) on LPS-induced increase of serum TNFα concentration and UCP2 mRNA, mice were injected intraperitoneally with PDTC (250 mg/kg body weight, Sigma), followed 30 min later by LPS (0.5 mg/kg body weight, Sigma) injection. Serum concentration of TNFα drawn at 90 min after LPS injection was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (BioSource International, Inc.). Mice were sacrificed 17 h thereafter. RNA from liver was used for measurement of UCP2 mRNA. To examine the effects of PDTC on dietary oil feeding or fibrate administration-induced increases on TNFα and UCP2 mRNAs, PDTC (250 mg/kg body weight) was injected intraperitoneally just prior to initiation of feeding of high safflower oil diet, high fish oil diet, high carbohydrate diet, and fenofibrate-administered high carbohydrate diet to mice. RNA was isolated from livers 17 h after PDTC injection and used for Northern blots to measure TNFα and UCP2 mRNAs. Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (7Tsuboyama-Kasaoka N. Takahashi M. Kim H. Ezaki O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 879-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). A portion of RNA (15 μg per lane) was denatured with glyoxal and dimethyl sulfoxide and analyzed by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels. After transfer to nylon membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and UV cross-linking, RNA blots were stained with methylene blue to locate 28 S and 18 S rRNAs and to ascertain the amount of loaded RNAs. Human UCP2, mouse PPARα, mouse RXRα, mouse PGC-1, rat ACS, and human TNFα cDNAs were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using a random prime labeling kit (Multiprime DNA Labeling Systems, Amersham Biosciences). The amounts of UCP2, PPARα, RXRα, PGC-1, ACS, and TNFα mRNAs were quantitated with an image analyzer (BAS 2000, Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan) and expressed as the intensity of phosphostimulated luminescence. Hepatocytes were washed with PBS and resuspended medium containing 100 nm triiiodothyronine, 100 nm dexamethasone, 1 nm insulin (Lilly), and agents such as TBHP (30, 100 μm, Sigma) and WY14,643 (50 μm), incubated for 14 h, and then harvested. A fluorescent probe, 2,7-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCF-DA, 10 μm, Sigma), was added at 30 min prior to cell harvesting. DCF-DA was used for assessing intracellular hydroperoxides (hydrogen peroxides and lipid hydroperoxides) (26Keston A.S. Brandt R. Anal. Biochem. 1965; 11: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 27Bass D.A. Parce J.W. Dechatelet L.R. Szejda P. Seeds M.C. Thomas M. J. Immunol. 1983; 130: 1910-1917PubMed Google Scholar). DCF-DA diffuses through the cell membrane and is converted to DCF by intracellular esterases. Intracellular hydroperoxides convert non-fluorescent DCF to fluorescent DCF. Because DCF-DA located outside of the cells does not react with hydroperoxides, only intracellular hydroperoxides that react with DCF are detected. Fluorescence intensity was measured in a Hitachi F2000 fluorescence spectrophotometer with excitation wavelength at 485 nm and emission at 535 nm. The amount of intracellular ROS was expressed as the fluorescence intensity per total cellular protein. Protein was assayed by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Statistical comparisons of the groups were made by one-way analysis of variance, and when they were statistically significant, each group was compared with others by Fisher's PLSD test (Statview 4.0 Abacus Concept, Inc., Berkeley, CA). Statistical significance is defined as p < 0.05. Values are mean ± S.E. We reported previously (7Tsuboyama-Kasaoka N. Takahashi M. Kim H. Ezaki O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 879-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) that fish oil feeding for 5 months or fibrate administration for 2 weeks up-regulated UCP2 mRNA in whole liver tissue by 5- and 9-fold, respectively. To examine whether hepatocytes or non-parenchymal cells are responsible for UCP2 up-regulation observed in whole liver tissues, the level of UCP2 mRNA in two types of liver cells was measured separately by Northern blotting (Fig.1). In carbohydrate-fed mice, UCP2 mRNA level in non-parenchymal cells (mostly Kupffer cells) was 4–7-fold higher than hepatocytes (Fig. 1 A). Compared with carbohydrate-fed mice, safflower oil-fed mice for 2 days showed 1.6–1.8-fold increases of UCP2 expression in both cell types. However, compared with safflower oil-fed mice, fish oil-fed mice showed a 5-fold increase of UCP2 mRNA in hepatocytes, whereas its increase in non-parenchymal cells was very small (1.3-fold). Similar different expression profiles were observed in fenofibrate administration (Fig.1 B). Fibrate administration for 2 days increased UCP2 mRNA by more than 18-fold in hepatocytes and by 2.5-fold in non-parenchymal cells. When examined in whole liver tissues, fish oil feeding or fibrate administration did not increase UCP2 mRNA in rats (data not shown). In hepatocytes isolated from rat liver, fish oil feeding or fenofibrate administration for 2 days up-regulated UCP2 mRNA by 1.5- and 5.2-fold, respectively, whereas in non-parenchymal cells, either fish oil feeding or fenofibrate administration rather down-regulated UCP2 expression by 27 and 30%, respectively (Fig. 1 C). However, only up-regulation of hepatocytes UCP2 by fenofibrate administration reached statistical significance (p < 0.05). PPARα activators selectively up-regulated UCP2 mRNA in rat hepatocytes, but their increases are smaller than those in mice. These data well explained why PPARα activators did not up-regulate UCP2 mRNA in whole liver tissues of rat (8Kelly L.J. Vicario P.P. Thompson G.M. Candelore M.R. Doebber T.W. Ventre J. Wu M.S. Meurer R. Forrest M.J. Conner M.W. Cascieri M.A. Moller D.E. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4920-4927Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). In rats, small increases of UCP2 mRNA in hepatocytes and down-regulation of UCP2 mRNA in non-parenchymal cells did not result in up-regulation of UCP2 mRNA in whole liver tissues. At present, the reasons for the differential responses of PPARα activators to UCP2 expression in hepatocytes and non-parenchymal cells between mice and rats are not clear. However, these differences might not be due to cross-contamination of hepatocytes and non-parenchymal cell fractions, because there were no significant differences of PPARα mRNA (a marker of hepatocytes) and TNFα mRNA (a marker of non-parenchymal cells) distributions in hepatocytes and non-parenchymal cell fractions between mice and rats (data not shown). The down-regulation of rat UCP2 in non-parenchymal cells was also reported in LPS-treated rats; LPS treatment up-regulated UCP2 mRNA in hepatocytes and down-regulated it in macrophages (4Cortez-Pinto H. Yang S.Q. Lin H.Z. Costa S. Hwang C.-S. Lane M.D. Bagby G. Diehl A.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that a decrease of UCP2 in rats may contribute to enhanced macrophage immunity against bacterial infection as observed in UCP2 knockout mice (28Arsenijevic D. Onuma H. Pecqueur C. Raimbault S. Manning B.S. Miroux B. Couplan E. Alves-Guerra M.-C. Goubern M. Surwit R. Bouillaud F. Richard D. Collins S. Ricquier D. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). Next, to examine whether UCP2 up-regulation observed in hepatocytes from fish oil feeding or fibrate administration was due to the direct effect of PPARα activation in hepatocytes, PPARα activators were directly added to primary mouse/rat hepatocytes culture, and their expression levels of UCP2 were examined (Table I). Fish oil was not examined because of its insolubility. Up-regulation of UCP2 by PPARα activators was observed in both mouse and rat hepatocytes. Addition of 30 μm fenofibrate or 50 μm WY14,643, a specific activator of PPARα, to mouse hepatocytes up-regulated UCP2 by 5.4- and 5.5-fold, respectively; addition of 50 μmWY14,643 to rat hepatocytes also up-regulated UCP2 by 4.5-fold. Thus, these data suggest that PPAR activators act directly on both mouse and rat hepatocytes and up-regulate UCP2 expression.Table IEffects of PPARα ligands on UCP2 gene expression in primary cultures of mouse and rat hepatocytesUCP2 mRNA%MiceMe2SO100WY14,643 (50 μm)555WY14,643 (100 μm)497Fenofibrate (30 μm)539RatsMe2SO100WY14,643 (50 μm)453Hepatocytes were isolated from standard animal chow fed mice and rats and cultured for 24 h in culture medium.

Total RNA was isolated, and transferred membrane sheets were probed with 32P-labeled human UCP2 cDNA. These mRNA levels were quantified using an image analyzer. The UCP2 mRNA levels are shown as relative values to those of control, Me2SO-treated cells. To examine whether PPAR-induced UCP2 mRNA increase was due to the increase of RNA transcription or the increase of mRNA stability, the effects of α-amanitin, polymerase II inhibitor, on the decay of UCP2 mRNAs in the presence and absence of WY14,643 were examined (Fig. 2). The decay of UCP2 mRNA by amanitin treatment was not altered in the presence of WY14,643. The data suggested that PPARα activators up-regulated UCP2 mRNA via an increased transcription but not via an increased UCP2 mRNA stability. To examine whether PPARα-induced UCP2 mRNA required a newly synthesized protein, the effects of cycloheximide that inhibit protein synthesis were examined (Fig.3). Addition of cycloheximide prevented WY14,643-induced UCP2 up-regulation (Fig. 3 A). The data suggested that up-regulation of UCP2 by PPARα activator requires a newly synthesized protein. As a positive control, the effects of cycloheximide on acyl-CoA synthetase (ACS) expression were also examined (Fig. 3 B). ACS is one of the target genes of PPARα activators (29Schoonjans K.

Microglia are resident macrophages with wide distribution in nervous tissues, and upon activation by endotoxin or various microorganisms, these cells and other mononuclear phagocytes produce several toxic mediators, such as nitric oxide (NO) and free radicals, in addition to numerous cytokines, including interleukin 1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα). The production of these mediators, although beneficial for killing bacteria and further activating the immune system, can also contribute to significant tissue damage, especially in the brain. For example, the generation of NO by microglial cells may promote brain damage during infection by enhancing vascular permeability and potentially compromising the blood brain barrier (4Calingasan N.Y.

Additionally, the activation of microglial cells may contribute to neurodegenerative disorders as a result of their production of β-amyloid protein (7Monning U. Sandbrink R. Banati R.B. Masters C.L.

Moreover, microglial cells have also been implicated in neuronal injury such as stroke, meningitis, and multiple sclerosis. Thus, a further understanding of microglial cell activation and function should allow for the identification of potential targets for therapeutic intervention in these neuronal disorders. Multiple signaling pathways are known to be activated in macrophages upon LPS exposure (10Denlinger L.C. Fisette P.L. Garis K.A. Daugherty S.K. Bertics P.J. Proctor R.A. Morrison D.C. Ryan J.L. Novel Therapeutic Strategies in the Treatment of Sepsis. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1996: 227-252Google Scholar). Among these pathways are the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), which are a highly conserved family of protein serine/threonine kinases and include the extracellular signal-regulated kinases ERK-1 and ERK-2 (11Garrington T.P. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar, 12Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 49-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Along with nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation, ERK activation is often used as a hallmark of LPS-induced signal transduction in many cell types (13Wang P.L. Sato K. Oido M. Fujii T. Kowashi Y.

Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W. Baeuerle P.A. Immunobiology. 1993; 187: 233-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that ERK (p42/p44 MAPK) activation is involved in LPS-induced cellular responses, such as the increased production of TNFα, inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) and NO, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) (20Bhat N.R. Zhang P. Lee J.C. Hogan E.L. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1633-1641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Carter A.B. Monick M.M. Hunninghake G.W. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol.

Recent data suggest, however, that the ERKs are not involved in iNOS or NO production in macrophages nor in the activation of NF-κB DNA binding activity (23Chen C. Chen Y.H. Lin W.W. Immunology. 1999; 97: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 24Chen C.C. Wang J.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), but rather other MAPKs, specifically p38, have been postulated to be important in the control of these end points. Therefore, given the powerful responses of macrophages and microglia to LPS, it is important to establish the relative contribution of the ERKs and p38 in the LPS sensitivity of these two cell types. Because NF-κB activity regulates the expression of several cytokine genes including TNFα, IL-6, and IL-1β (25Collart M.A. Baeuerle P. Vassalli P. Mol. Cell.

Neuroimmunol. 1992; 39: 231-242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), and because LPS modulates its activity, the status of NF-κB DNA binding activity is a key issue when considering the mechanisms of LPS signaling in murine macrophages and microglial cells. NF-κB is a homo- or heterodimeric transcription factor whose function is regulated by the binding of an inhibitory protein, IκB. Upon serine phosphorylation of the IκB protein, it is targeted for proteasome-mediated degradation, thus allowing the now transcriptionally active NF-κB protein complex to translocate into the nucleus where it can bind to various regulatory elements present in gene promoter regions (32Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5515) Google Scholar). LPS is known to stimulate the degradation of one of the isoforms of IκB, IκBα, and accordingly, LPS promotes the activation of NF-κB DNA binding activity in numerous myelocytic cell types, including phagocytes (19Muller J.M. Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W. Baeuerle P.A. Immunobiology. 1993; 187: 233-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Additionally, it has been documented that NF-κB not only plays a role in the regulation of cytokine genes but also in the expression of other genes important for macrophage and microglial cell function. For example, binding sites for NF-κB are present in the promoter of the iNOS gene, and these have been shown to be involved in iNOS gene up-regulation (33Xie Q.W. Whisnant R. Nathan C. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1779-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar, 34Lowenstein C.J. Alley E.W. Raval P. Snowman A.M. Snyder S.H. Russell S.W. Murphy W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9730-9734Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). There are several known LPS-binding proteins present on macrophage membranes, including CD14, CD11b/18, and Toll-like receptors (35Fenton M.J. Golenbock D.T. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 64: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Toll-like receptors are mammalian homologs of the DrosophilaToll receptor and are involved in initiating innate immune defense against bacteria and fungi (36Lemaitre B. Nicolas E. Michaut L. Reichhart J.M. Hoffmann J.A. Cell. 1996; 86: 973-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2930) Google Scholar). Because CD14 lacks a transmembrane domain and is unlikely to initiate signals on its own, it is noteworthy that the Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4) has emerged as a potential signaling partner for LPS/CD14 interactions (37Beutler B. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2000; 3: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 38Anderson K.V. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 39Bowie A. LA O.N. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 67: 508-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The presence of TLR-4 alone in transfected cell systems is insufficient to confer substantial LPS responsiveness unless another protein, MD-2, is present (40Shimazu R. Akashi S. Ogata H. Nagai Y. Fukudome K. Miyake K. Kimoto M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1777-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (1717) Google Scholar). Thus, the Toll-like receptors are believed to be responsible for much of the observed CD14-dependent, LPS-induced ERK (41Vogel S.N. Perera P.-Y. Mayadas T.N. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Zaks-Zilberman M.

Although LPS is a potent activator of several cell types, such as macrophages and microglial cells, these cells often play unique tissue-specific roles and exhibit different sensitivities to LPS. These types of biological differences may be inherent in variations within LPS signaling pathways. Because ERK-1 and ERK-2 have been implicated in the control of a wide variety of macrophage mediators, the present studies were initiated to evaluate the hypothesis that variations in the activation pattern of the ERKs and NF-κB can serve as indicators for differences in LPS sensitivity between macrophage-like cells. LPS (Escherichia coli 0111:B4), 3′-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)-ATP (BzATP), anisomycin, and the phorbol ester PMA were purchased from Sigma. Murine RAW 264.7 macrophage cells were grown to ∼80% confluency and routinely passaged in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% cosmic calf serum (Mediatech, Herndon, VA) and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). BV-2 microglial cells were a kind gift from Dr. Gary Weisman (University of Missouri-Columbia) and were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. RAW 264.7 and BV-2 cells were cultured in 100-mm Falcon plates (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). CHO-K1 stable cell lines expressing vector (CHO-K1/Neo) or human CD14 (CHO-K1/CD14) were generously provided to us by Dr. Douglas Golenbock (Boston University School of Medicine) (45Delude R.L. Fenton M.J. Savedra Jr., R. Perera P.Y. Vogel S.N. Thieringer R. Golenbock D.T. J. Biol.

Prior to each experiment, cells were plated overnight in Falcon 24-well plates (RAW cells at 8.5 × 104 cells/well and BV-2 cells at 7 × 104cells/well). The following day, cells were treated with LPS at the concentrations indicated in the figures or with the phorbol ester PMA (100 nm) or BzATP (250 μm) as positive controls. BzATP is a ligand for the purinergic receptor P2X7 and has been shown previously to powerfully stimulate the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK-1 and ERK-2 in murine RAW 264.7 macrophages (46Hu Y.

Whole cell lysates were prepared by lysing CHO-K1, CHO-CD14, BV-2, and RAW 264.7 cells, plated as indicated above, in SDS-PAGE sample buffer without bromphenol blue (20 mm Tris, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 2% SDS, 20% glycerol). Protein content was determined using the Micro-BCA Protein Assay (Pierce). Equal amounts of protein (∼25 μg) were loaded per lane and separated by 10% SDS-PAGE as described by Laemmli (48Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Proteins in the gels were transferred to Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), and the membranes were subsequently blocked in 5% non-fat milk/TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20). Anti-active ERK antibodies (Promega, Madison, WI) that recognize the dually tyrosine- and threonine-phosphorylated, and thus enzymatically active forms of ERK-1 and ERK-2, were used at a dilution of 1:5000. Anti-IκBα antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) were diluted 1:1000 in 5% milk/TBST and used to measure IκBα degradation following treatment with LPS. For detection of p38 and JNK activation, membranes were blocked in 1% IgG and protease-free BSA (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Bar Harbor, ME). Anti-active p38 antibodies were used at a final dilution of 1:4000 in 0.1% BSA/TBST, and anti-active JNK antibodies were employed at a final concentration of 1:5000 in 0.1% BSA/TBST. Cell lysates (100 μg of protein) were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes for immunoblotting using anti-TLR-4 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a final dilution of 1:1000 in 5% milk/TBST. The immunoreactive bands were visualized using secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and Lumi-Glo chemiluminescent detection methods (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD). To confirm equal protein loading, membranes were stripped at 70 °C for 30 min with a buffer consisting of 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 2% SDS, and 100 mm dithiothreitol. The immunoblots were re-blocked in 5% milk/TBST followed by incubation with antibodies that react with both active and inactive forms of ERK-1 and ERK-2 proteins (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Bands were visualized using chemiluminescence. The data shown are representative of at least three separate experiments. Murine BV-2 and RAW 264.7 cells were cultured in 24-well plates as described above. Cells were treated for 20 h with LPS at the concentrations indicated in the figures. For NO determination, the medium was removed; the cells were washed, and whole cell lysates were prepared as described above. The concentration of NO in the medium was determined using the Greiss reagent as described previously (49Mitchell J.A. Kohlhaas K.L. Matsumoto T. Pollock J.S. Forstermann U. Warner T.D. Schmidt H.H. Murad F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 1163-1168PubMed Google Scholar). For experiments investigating the involvement of MAPK signaling pathways, the MEK1/MEK2 inhibitor UO126 (10 μm, Promega) or the p38 MAPK antagonist SB 202190 (10 μm, Calbiochem) were used to pretreat RAW 264.7 or BV-2 cells for 15 min prior to incubation with LPS. In some experiments, additional pulses of UO 126 were also given at several hour intervals following LPS stimulation, as indicated in the figure legends. To confirm the activity of these inhibitors, BV-2 cells were pretreated with 10 μm UO126 or 10 μm SB 202190 followed by stimulation with either 1 μm PMA (a potent activator of ERK-1 and −2) or with 10 μg/ml anisomycin (a potent activator of p38). Additionally, to ascertain the time period that UO126 is capable of inhibiting ERK activation in culture, RAW 264.7 cells were treated for 2, 4, 6, or 18 h with 10 μm UO126 followed by stimulation with 100 nm PMA for 5 min, and ERK-1/ERK-2 and/or p38 activation was measured as described above. To assess NO levels, the breakdown product nitrite was measured in the medium as detailed above. The Student's t test was used to evaluate the statistical differences between various treatment groups, with the level of significance being set at not more than p < 0.02. The levels of iNOS were measured by immunoblotting, as outlined above. Equal amounts of protein (∼25 μg) were loaded and separated in each lane of a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The separated proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane, and the membrane was blocked in 5% milk/TBST. Anti-iNOS antibodies (1:2000) (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) were used to measure iNOS protein up-regulation following treatment with LPS. Equal protein loading was confirmed by stripping and re-probing blots with anti-ERK antibodies. For IL-1β level determinations, cells were treated for 3–18 h with either 10 or 1000 ng/ml LPS, and then Quantikine-M ELISA assays (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. This assay system measures both the processed and immature forms of IL-1β. Nuclear extracts were prepared from RAW 264.7 macrophages and BV-2 microglial cells grown in 100-mm Falcon plates, and gel mobility assays were performed as described previously (50Denlinger L.C. Garis K.A. Sommer J.A. Guadarrama A.G. Proctor R.A. Bertics P.J. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1638-1647Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In these experiments, the cells were treated with 1 μg/ml LPS for 30, 60, or 90 min and lysed, and 10 μg of nuclear protein extract was incubated with 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe encoding two consensus NF-κB DNA-binding sites. The DNA-protein complexes were separated using non-denaturing PAGE techniques, and the gels were dried and apposed to film. Murine RAW 264.7 macrophages and BV-2 microglial cells were removed from 100-mm Falcon plates using a non-enzymatic cell dissociation solution (Sigma catalog number C-1544). Cells (∼5 × 105) were washed and resuspended in PBS containing 1% BSA. Rat anti-mouse CD14 (PharMingen International, San Diego, CA) or isotype control antibodies (Caltag Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) were added to the cells at a final concentration of 1 μg/tube and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing with PBS, 1% BSA, the cells were again incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with 1 μg/tube of anti-rat IgG phycoerythrin-labeled secondary antibodies (Caltag Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Cells were washed and resuspended in PBS, 1% BSA. Propidium iodide (∼10 μg/tube) was added to differentiate live from dead cells. FACS analysis was performed in a Becton-Dickinson FACScan Flow Cytometer gating 10,000 live events. Murine RAW 264.7 macrophages and BV-2 microglia were grown in 100-mm plates as detailed above. Cells were lysed in 1 ml of Tri- Reagent (Sigma), and total RNA was harvested as described by the manufacturer's protocol, followed by DNase I treatment for 60 min and heat inactivation at 95 °C for 10 min. Five μg of total RNA were used as templates for the RT-PCR using random hexamers and Superscript Reverse Transcriptase II (Invitrogen). Reactions were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol except that the reverse transcriptase enzyme was omitted in one sample for control purposes. Following reverse transcription, 1/10 of the total RT reaction was utilized for PCR of MD-2 mRNA using the following murine primers: 5′ TCT GCA ACT CCT CCG ATG CAA TTA TTT CCT AC and 5′ TGT ATT CAC AGT CTC TCC TTT CAG AGC TCT GC. The expected size of the amplified fragment is 274 bp. As a control, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, expected amplimer size 982 bp) was also amplified using the following human primer sequences: 5′ TGA AGG TCG GAG TCA ACG GAT TTG GT and 5′ CAT GTG GGC CAT GAG GTC CAC CAC. The murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 recapitulates the behavior of peripheral macrophage cells, whereas BV-2 cells retain the characteristics of activated microglial cells. These cells have similar antigen profiles, phagocytic capacities, and anti-microbial activities and respond to LPS in terms of NO production (51Blasi E. Barluzzi R. Bocchini V. Mazzolla R. Bistoni F. J. Neuroimmunol. 1990; 27: 229-237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar, 52Bocchini V. Mazzolla R. Barluzzi R. Blasi E. Sick P. Kettenmann H. J. Neurosci.

Although the production of cytokines and mediators by macrophages and microglia are known to be critical for their function (53Mirzoeva S. Koppal T. Petrova T.V. Lukas T.J. Watterson D.M.

Chem. 1999; 274: 28823-28827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), it is unclear how these cells compare with regard to LPS responsiveness. Treatment of both RAW 264.7 macrophages and BV-2 microglial cells for 16–20 h with increasing concentrations of LPS (10–1000 ng/ml) results in increased iNOS protein levels (Fig.1 A) and subsequent NO production (Fig. 1 B). However, as illustrated in Fig.1 B, on a per cell basis, BV-2 microglial cells respond more robustly to LPS than do RAW 264.7 macrophages in terms of NO production. This effect is most notable at the lower concentrations of LPS (10 and 100 ng/ml) where BV-2 cells produce more NO over the course of the assay than do RAW 264.7 cells. Interestingly, a different pattern of LPS responsiveness is also observed with regard to the release of the cytokine IL-1β by RAW 264.7 macrophages and BV-2 microglial cells (Fig.2). In these studies, ELISAs were used to measure immunoreactive IL-1β species released into the tissue culture medium from both cell lines. This method allows for the detection of both the immature (pro-IL-1β) as well as the mature (cleaved IL-1β) forms of the cytokine. When RAW 264.7 and BV-2 cells are treated with LPS (10 and 1000 ng/ml) for 3–18 h, a large increase in immunoreactive IL-1β is observed in the tissue culture medium at 18 h (Fig.2 A). However, in addition to the differential LPS sensitivities of these two cell types, i.e. BV-2 microglia generate more immunodetectable IL-1β in the tissue culture medium on a per cell basis following treatment with 1000 ng/ml LPS for 18 h, we also detected a substantial difference in the kinetics of IL-1β appearance. In contrast to RAW 264.7 macrophages, IL-1β levels in the medium were detectable in the BV-2 microglial cell cultures within 3 h of treatment, while after 9 h of LPS (1000 ng/ml) exposure, the medium from both cell types contained approximately equal levels of IL-1β (Fig. 2 A). Although the present ELISAs cannot discriminate between processed and immature forms of IL-1β, more IL-1β is detected in the medium of RAW 264.7 cells over time in response to 10 ng/ml LPS than is found with BV-2 microglial cells. In fact, the amount of immunoreactive IL-1β produced by BV-2 microglial cells in response to 10 ng/ml LPS appears unchanged over an 18-h period. Because this observation is different from what has been reported regarding IL-1β production by macrophages and macrophage cell lines (56Pennanen N. Lapinjoki S. Palander A. Urtti A. Monkkonen J.

Lett. 1991; 30: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), we evaluated the kinetics of IL-1β accumulation in the tissue culture medium in BV-2 microglial cells in response to 10 and 1000 ng/ml LPS (Fig. 2 B). Again, as illustrated in Fig.2, A and B, similar levels of detectable IL-1β were found in the medium from BV-2 cells following treatment with 10 ng/ml LPS for 6–18 h. Although LPS potently stimulates both RAW 264.7 macrophages and BV-2 microglial cells to produce cytokines and NO, BV-2 cells exhibit an altered pattern of LPS responsiveness, especially at lower LPS concentrations and earlier time points. To determine whether the differential sensitivity of BV-2 cells to LPS is dependent upon the expression of the known"

NFATc1 and NFATc2 are the predominant NFAT family members in the peripheral immune system. NFATc2 is found abundantly in the cytoplasm of resting T cells, whereasNfatc1 expression is induced during T cell activation. To investigate Nfatc1 regulation, we characterized the structure of the murine Nfatc1 gene and its 5′-flanking region. A 290-bp sequence proximal to the transcription start site is highly conserved between mouse and human and possesses both basal and inducible promoter activities. Multiple binding sites for transcription factors were identified within this region, including a consensus NFAT-binding site. This promoter segment was cyclosporin A-sensitive, and mutation of the NFAT site abrogated inducible promoter activity and inhibited formation of an inducible DNA·protein complex containing NFATc2 in primary T cells. Overexpression of NFATc2 increased inducibleNfatc1 promoter activity, whereas this inducibility was attenuated in NFATc2−/− splenocytes. This study suggests that pre-existing NFATc2 contributes to the subsequent induction ofNfatc1 during T cell activation.

Since then, four closely related proteins of the NFAT family have been cloned and partially characterized. They include NFATc1 (after the HUGO Genome Nomenclature Committee, previously named NF-ATc, NFAT2) (2Northrop J.P. Ho S.N. Chen L. Thomas D.J. Timmerman L.A. Nolan G.P. Admon A. Crabtree G.R.

Immunity. 1995; 2: 461-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). NFAT proteins have been demonstrated to preferentially bind to a purine-rich core motif, (A/T)GGAAAA, in the regulatory regions of various cytokine genes, whereby they modulate the promoter/enhancer transcriptional activity in activated T cells (8Crabtree G.R. Clipstone N.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 1045-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar, 9Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev.

Acta. 2000; 1498: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar).The regulation of NFAT transcriptional activity during T cell activation is controlled at several levels. NFAT proteins exist mainly in an inactive phosphorylated state in the cytoplasm of resting T cells. Activation requires a sustained increase in intracellular Ca2+ induced by T cell receptor engagement or the calcium ionophore ionomycin, which in turn activates the Ca2+-dependent phosphatase calcineurin (11Timmerman L.A. Clipstone N.A. Ho S.N. Northrop J.P. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1996; 383: 837-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Calcineurin dephosphorylates NFAT proteins and induces their nuclear translocation (4Jain J. McCaffrey P.G. Miner Z. Kerppola T.K. Lambert J.N. Verdine G.L. Curran T. Rao A. Nature. 1993; 365: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 12Clipstone N.A. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1992; 357: 695-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1462) Google Scholar, 13Shibasaki F. Price E.R.

The immunosuppressants cyclosporin A (CsA) and FK506, which block the phosphatase activity of calcineurin (14Emmel E.A. Verweij C.L. Durand D.B. Higgins K.M. Lacy E. Crabtree G.R.

EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4425-4433Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), inhibit T cell activation by preventing the nuclear translocation of NFAT (16Flanagan W.M. Corthesy B. Bram R.J. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1991; 352: 803-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar) and subsequent activation of cytokine gene transcription. The nuclear import of NFAT is also blocked by MEKK1 and casein kinase-1α, which mask the nuclear import signal (17Zhu J. Shibasaki F. Price R. Guillemot J.C. Yano T. Dotsch V. Wagner G. Ferrara P. McKeon F. Cell. 1998; 93: 851-861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Export of NFAT out of the nucleus is also highly regulated. Glycogen synthase kinase-3, a nuclear kinase, phosphorylates NFATc1 at the same sites that are dephosphorylated by calcineurin and thus promotes NFATc1 nuclear export (18Beals C.R. Sheridan C.M. Turck C.W. Gardner P. Crabtree G.R. Science. 1997; 275: 1930-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Similarly, NFATc3 is exported from the nucleus after phosphorylation by JNK (19Chow C.W. Rincon M. Cavanagh J. Dickens M. Davis R.J. Science. 1997; 278: 1638-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). A critical balance between the import and export of NFAT in and out of the nucleus is a well established mechanism of NFAT regulation (20Grabtree G.R. Cell. 1999; 96: 611-614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar).Several lines of evidence suggest that increased NFAT transcriptional activity in T cells is not solely due to the nuclear translocation of NFAT proteins. For example, the DNA-binding affinity of NFAT proteins is greatly enhanced by cooperative interaction with AP-1 proteins (9Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2200) Google Scholar). AP-1 protein synthesis is induced by the activation of protein kinase C and Ras following T cell receptor engagement. This can be mimickedin vitro by treatment with the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). In addition, the transcriptional activity of NFAT proteins has recently been demonstrated to depend on the phosphorylation status of critical amino acid residues in the transcriptional activation domain (21Garcia-Rodriguez C. Rao A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 2432-2436Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Finally, levels of NFAT expression may contribute to overall NFAT activity. NFATc2 is constitutively expressed in resting human peripheral blood T cells (22Lyakh L. Ghosh P. Rice N.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2475-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 23Timmerman L.A. Healy J.I. Ho S.N. Chen L. Goodnow C.C. Crabtree G.R. J.

Immunol. 1998; 160: 2324-2333PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the inducible expression of NFATc1 in activated T cells is CsA-sensitive (22Lyakh L. Ghosh P. Rice N.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2475-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), indicating that the calcium-dependent calcineurin pathway may regulate NFATc1 induction. However, the factors that directly regulate NFAT expression levels are unknown.To better understand the regulation of NFATc1 expression, the murineNfatc1 gene and upstream regulatory regions were cloned. Herein, we provide the genomic organization of the murineNfatc1 gene and initial characterization of a 6-kb genomic fragment located upstream of the transcription start site (TSS). A CsA-sensitive and inducible minimal promoter region containing a consensus NFAT motif was identified within this 6-kb element. Mutagenesis studies indicated that this NFAT site is critical for optimal inducible promoter activity in primary human T cells. Moreover, this NFAT site bound the NFATc2 protein present in T cell nuclear extracts, and increased NFATc2 expression in primary T cells augmentedNfatc1 minimal promoter activity. In contrast, the inducible Nfatc1 promoter activity was diminished in T cells deficient in NFATc2. These data suggest a role for NFATc2 in the regulation of the Nfatc1 gene during the immune response.DISCUSSIONThe NFAT family members are critically important for immune regulation by effector CD4+ T cells, as most if not all cytokines produced by these cells are influenced by NFAT activity (8Crabtree G.R.

NFATc1−/− T cells display an increased propensity for the generation of Th1 cytokines, arguing that NFATc1 may normally play a role in up-regulating the opposing Th2 cytokine response (55Yoshida H.

The regulation of cytokine immune responses and the subsequent immune responses are thus notably influenced by the interplay of individual NFAT family members. Therefore, understanding the regulation of this family of T cell transcription factors is of utmost importance.NFATc1 expression in peripheral T cells is predominantly regulated by T cell activation through T cell receptor engagement, which can be mimicked in vitro via stimulation with ionomycin and PMA. Following T cell activation, the level of NFATc1 mRNA is detectable within 1 h after activation (6Masuda E.S. Naito Y. Tokumitsu H. Campbell D. Saito F. Hannum C. Arai K. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2697-2706Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and peaks around 3–6 h (33Pan S. Koyano-Nakagawa N. Tsuruta L. Amasaki Y. Yokota T. Mori S. Arai N. Arai K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 314-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 36Chuvpilo S. Avots A. Berberich-Siebelt F. Glockner J. Fischer C. Kerstan A. Escher C. Inashkina I. Hlubek F. Jankevics E. Brabletz T. Serfling E. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 7294-7301PubMed Google Scholar), resembling the induction of many T cell-derived cytokine genes. Furthermore, CsA, a powerful cytokine inhibitor, eliminates inducibleNfatc1 gene expression (22Lyakh L. Ghosh P. Rice N.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2475-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The similarity in the regulation of gene expression between Nfatc1 and cytokine genes supports the contention that NFAT contributes toNfatc1 expression.Here, we provide evidence that the transcriptional activity ofNfatc1 in T cells is indeed regulated by NFATc2, the most abundantly expressed NFAT family member in human peripheral T cells (22Lyakh L. Ghosh P. Rice N.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2475-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 24Cron R.Q. Bort S.J. Wang Y. Brunvand M.W. Lewis D.B. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 860-870PubMed Google Scholar, 31Cron R.Q. Schubert L.A. Lewis D.B. Hughes C.C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 205: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). First, the minimal promoter of murine Nfatc1was defined in primary T cells that were activated by ionomycin plus PMA stimulation. This induction was completely blocked by CsA. Second, a proximal consensus NFAT-binding motif located within the murineNfatc1 minimal promoter was identified, and the sequence of the NFAT site and surrounding sequences were highly conserved between mouse and human. Mutational analysis of the NFAT-binding site demonstrated that this DNA element contributed to optimal basal and inducible activities of the minimal promoter. Third, the NFAT site was required for binding of NFATc2 upon T cell activation, and this binding correlated with increased promoter activity. Last, the inducibleNfatc1 promoter activity was increased by overexpression of NFAT, particularly NFATc2. Conversely, this induction was notably diminished in NFATc2−/− T cells. Together, these studies demonstrate the importance of NFATc2 in increasing NFATc1 expression.The requirement of the NFAT-binding site for NFATc2 interaction and the minimal promoter activity of Nfatc1 does not, however, establish that NFATc2 is essential for constitutive or even inducibleNfatc1 expression in vivo. In fact, no alteration in the level of endogenous NFATc1 protein in DNA·NFAT complexes was shown by EMSA using nuclear protein extracts from NFATc2−/− mouse splenocytes (54Schuh K. Kneitz B. Heyer J. Bommhardt U. Jankevics E. Berberich-Siebelt F. Pfeffer K. Muller-Hermelink H.K. Schimpl A. Serfling E. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 2456-2466Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Furthermore, constitutive expression of NFATc1 has been reported in mice doubly deficient in NFATc2 and NFATc3 (58Ranger A.M. Oukka M. Rengarajan J. Glimcher L.H. Immunity. 1998; 9: 627-635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Similarly, we found, by Northern and Western blot analyses, an increase in the basal level of NFATc1 in NFATc2−/− splenocytes (Fig. 5, C andD). In addition, the induction of NFATc1 expression in NFATc2−/− splenocytes after 6 h of polyclonal stimulation was comparable to that in normal splenocytes. Thus, dysregulation of NFATc1 coexists with alterations in the expression of multiple cytokine genes present in Nfatc2 gene-disrupted mice.One possible explanation for the discrepancy of reporter gene assays and endogenous NFATc1 expression is that although the optimalNfatc1 minimal promoter activity is dependent on NFATc2, its role is compensated by other transcription factors in the context of the entire gene in the NFATc2−/− splenocytes. Along these lines, the activity of a potent transcription factor (AP-1) was markedly increased in NFATc2−/− splenocytes, especially upon PMA and ionomycin activation (>5-fold) (data not shown). Alternatively, the dysregulated Nfatc1 expression in NFATc2−/− splenocytes may be secondary to functional redundancy or perturbed thymic development in the knockout mice. Moreover, T cell function is not entirely normal in NFATc2−/− mice, as the T cells express a preactivated phenotype and are less susceptible to activation-induced apoptosis (54Schuh K. Kneitz B. Heyer J. Bommhardt U. Jankevics E. Berberich-Siebelt F. Pfeffer K. Muller-Hermelink H.K. Schimpl A. Serfling E. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 2456-2466Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that NFATc2 does contribute to the expression of endogenous NFATc1 in T cells. To more directly address this, it may be necessary to examine the role of NFATc2 inNfatc1 transcription at the chromatin level (e.g.chromatin immunoprecipitation assays) or by a dominant-negative strategy similar to what has been used to document the requirement for NFAT in IL-2 expression in vivo (61Dzialo-Hatton R. Milbrandt J. Hockett Jr., R.D. Weaver C.T. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 4534-4542Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).In addition to NFAT, other transcription factors must contribute toNfatc1 gene regulation. The gel shift assays suggested that other protein(s) bind adjacent to the NFAT site in the murineNfatc1 promoter prior to T cell activation because deletion either 5′ or 3′ of the NFAT site from the composite elements abolished the fast migrating complex b (Fig. 4 B). Although the formation of binding complex b was characteristic of HMG (I)Y described for the NFAT-containing composite of the murine IL-4 promoter (50Klein-Hessling S. Schneider G. Heinfling A. Chuvpilo S. Serfling E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15311-15316Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), an anti-HMG (I)Y antibody was unable to confirm the protein identity within this complex b. Further experiments will be directed at examining the possible involvement of members of the HMG family other than HMG (I)Y.The complexity of transcription complexes forming at the overlapping motifs was further manifested by the slow migrating complex a in Fig.4 B. The site immediately 5′ of the NFAT motif potentially serves as an overlapping binding site for the constitutively expressed transcription factor Sp1 and inducible Egr-1, which has also been found in the distal NFAT/AP-1-binding site of the human IL-2 gene (38Skerka C. Decker E.L. Zipfel P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22500-22506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 39Decker E.L. Skerka C. Zipfel P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26923-26930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This cooperation of NFAT proteins with AP-1 factors at the NFAT/AP-1 element has been the prototype of synergistic induction of cytokine gene transcription (9Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2200) Google Scholar). Sp1 or Egr factors have also been shown to mediate IL-2, CD95 ligand, and CD40 ligand transcription by functioning as potent coactivators for NFAT proteins (39Decker E.L. Skerka C. Zipfel P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26923-26930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 61Dzialo-Hatton R. Milbrandt J. Hockett Jr., R.D. Weaver C.T. J.

Thus, the close proximity of the Sp1, NFAT, and HMG sites in the Nfatc1proximal promoter and the complete conservation of sequences here between mouse and human suggest an intricate balance in the control of NFATc1 transcription by several transcription factors. Therefore, identification of NFAT cofactors and further characterization of their interactions at the NFAT site will elucidate the higher order assembly of transcription factors operating in a temporal, cell type-specific, and stimulus-dependent manner required for NFATc1 transcription during the immune response.The transcriptional regulation of transcription factors themselves is only just beginning to be explored. Recently, the Oct-1 transcription factor promoter was found to possess multiple octamer-binding sites (63Pankratova E.V. Polanovsky O.L. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It is similarly interesting that NFAT proteins are able to positively regulate self-expression. Transcriptional regulation of transcription factors will most certainly play a role during embryogenesis and organ development. In the thymus, for example, expression of NFAT family members is differentially regulated during the development of T cells (26Amasaki Y. Masuda E.S. Imamura R. Arai K. Arai N. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2324-2333PubMed Google Scholar, 64Adachi S. Amasaki Y. Miyatake S. Arai N. Iwata M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14708-14716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). NFATc3 is preferentially expressed at a high level in immature double-positive CD4+/CD8 thymocytes. Conversely, NFATc2 is dominantly expressed in mature single-positive CD4+ T cells. NFATc1, however, is present at low levels in all subsets of T cells, but is strongly induced upon treatment with phorbol ester and calcium ionophore (26Amasaki Y. Masuda E.S. Imamura R. Arai K. Arai N. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2324-2333PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, NFATc1 is both temporary and spatially restricted to a subset of cardiac endothelial cells and is required for cardiac valve formation (65de la Pompa J.L Timmerman L.A. Takimoto H. Yoshida H. Elia A.J. Samper E. Potter J. Wakeham A. Marengere L. Langille B.L. Crabtree G.R. Mak T.W. Nature. 1998; 392: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 66Ranger A.M. Grusby M.J.

Thus, the Nfatc1 minimal promoter characterized here will be useful to delineate the transcriptional regulatory mechanism of NFATc1 in the heart that is important in understanding the genetic pathway controlling normal cardiac valve development and the subsequent disease process. NFAT1 was originally described as a putative transcription factor present in the nuclear extract of activated Jurkat T cells that bound to the human interleukin-2 (IL-2) promoter (1Shaw J.P. Utz P.J. Durand D.B. Toole J.J. Emmel E.A. Crabtree G.R. Science. 1988; 241: 202-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Since then, four closely related proteins of the NFAT family have been cloned and partially characterized. They include NFATc1 (after the HUGO Genome Nomenclature Committee, previously named NF-ATc, NFAT2) (2Northrop J.P. Ho S.N. Chen L. Thomas D.J. Timmerman L.A. Nolan G.P. Admon A. Crabtree G.R.

Immunity. 1995; 2: 461-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). NFAT proteins have been demonstrated to preferentially bind to a purine-rich core motif, (A/T)GGAAAA, in the regulatory regions of various cytokine genes, whereby they modulate the promoter/enhancer transcriptional activity in activated T cells (8Crabtree G.R. Clipstone N.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 1045-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar, 9Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev.

Acta. 2000; 1498: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The regulation of NFAT transcriptional activity during T cell activation is controlled at several levels. NFAT proteins exist mainly in an inactive phosphorylated state in the cytoplasm of resting T cells. Activation requires a sustained increase in intracellular Ca2+ induced by T cell receptor engagement or the calcium ionophore ionomycin, which in turn activates the Ca2+-dependent phosphatase calcineurin (11Timmerman L.A. Clipstone N.A. Ho S.N. Northrop J.P. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1996; 383: 837-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Calcineurin dephosphorylates NFAT proteins and induces their nuclear translocation (4Jain J. McCaffrey P.G. Miner Z. Kerppola T.K. Lambert J.N. Verdine G.L. Curran T. Rao A.

Among such products, heme oxygenase (HO)-11 has attracted great interest as a modifier of oxidative susceptibility; pretreatment with the HO-1 induction or its gene transfection markedly protects cell and tissues against oxidative damages in vitro and in vivo (1Brouard S.

Shibahara S. Int. J. Biochem. 1988; 20: 543-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Such an HO-1-mediated protection has been thought to result from multiple mechanisms. This stress-inducible enzyme degrades protoheme-IX, the substrate of HO that derives from hemoglobin or myoglobin and serves as a catalyst for enhancement of peroxide toxicity (10Grisham M.B. J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1985; 1: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Second, the HO reaction generates biliverdin, CO, and divalent iron as products, each of which is biologically active and ameliorates the oxidative susceptibility of cells through distinct mechanisms. Biliverdin serves as a substrate for biliverdin reductase, which generates bilirubin, a potent radical scavenger that eliminates lipid peroxide radicals (11Stocker R. Glazer A.N. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5918-5922Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Furthermore, CO could inhibit excessive NO generation and suppress the catalytic activity of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (12Shinoda Y. Suematsu M. Wakabayashi Y. Suzuki T. Goda N. Saito S. Yamaguchi T. Ishimura Y. Hepatology. 1998; 28: 286-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 13Kyokane T. Norimizu S. Taniai H. Naito M. Takeoka S. Tsuchida E. Nimura Y. Ishimura Y. Suematsu M. Gastroenterology. 2001; 120: 1227-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar); these enzyme systems account for endogenous generator of reactive oxygen species. Another cytoprotective outcome of the HO-1 induction could be ascribable to an increase in bioavailability of divalent iron that causes in turn activation of iron-responsive proteins such as aconitase and subsequent up-regulation of ferritin (14Nath K.A. Balla G. Vercellotti G.M. Balla J. Jacob H.S. Levitt M.D. Rosenberg M.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Up-regulated protein synthesis of ferritin causes overall reduction of free iron in cells and thereby attenuate oxidative susceptibility (15Vile G.F. Basu-Modak S. Waltner C. Tyrrell R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2607-2610Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). However, since an excess of divalent iron leads to Fenton reaction through reducing hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), overexpression of HO-1 through excess expression of the gene could, in contrast, aggravate oxidative cell susceptibility under circumstances where effects of the iron-mediated oxidant propagation overwhelms antioxidant capacity of the HO-1 reaction (16Kvam E. Hejmadi V. Ryter S. Pourzand C. Tyrrell R.M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1191-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 17Suttner D.M. Dennery P.A. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1800-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Thus, the mechanisms by which the HO-1 induction alter oxidative susceptibility and their link to the catalytic activities have not fully been addressed yet. If fundamental mechanisms for the aforementioned protection of cells by the HO-1 induction are ascribable to attenuation of oxidative insults mediated by heme and nonheme irons, the protection by HO-1 overexpression should be observed irrespective of the choice of pro-oxidant substances such as protoheme-IX, hydrogen peroxide, and organic hydroperoxides. This study aimed to examine if overexpression of the HO-1 protein leads to resistance against oxidative insults only through its catalytic activities. To address this question, we have established the wild type and the activity-lacking mutant HO-1-overexpressing cells and characterized their differences in antioxidative properties against varied pro-oxidant reagents such as H2O2, tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BuOOH), and protoheme-IX. The current study showed that the mutant HO-1 gene transfection turned out to render cells more resistant to H2O2 and the organic hydroperoxide through mechanisms involving up-regulation of catalase expression and cellular contents of reduced glutathione while causing greater susceptibility to overloading of protoheme-IX. At the same time, these results shed light on novel aspects for multiplicity of the HO-1-mediated mechanisms against oxidative stress. All reagents used in the present study were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise mentioned. Human monoblastic lymphoma cell line U937 was used for experiments. Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) cells were prepared by transforming lymphocytes from normal controls and the patient with HO-1 deficiency using supernatant from B95-8.

In brief, the rat HO-1 cDNA in pEFneo vector was used as a template to mutate His25 of rat HO-1 protein to Ala; the imidazole residue of the His serves as the proximal ligand of the substrate protoheme-IX, and its replacement with Ala interferes with binding of molecular oxygen at the distal side, causing loss of the enzyme activity (20Ito-Maki M. Ishikawa K. Matera K.M. Sato M. Ikeda-Saito M. Yoshida T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 317: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The H25A mutant of HO-1 in pEFneo was synthesized and amplified with the primers bearing 5′-GGC CAC CAA GGA GGT GGC CAT CCG TGC AGA GAA TTC TG-3′ and 5′-CAG AAT TCT CTG CAC GGA TGG CCA CCT CCT TGG TGG CC-3′, followed by the digestion with DpnI to remove the template vector. The wild type and H25A mutant gene constructs were transfected into U937 cells in culture, and their stable transfectants were cloned as described elsewhere (19Goda N. Suzuki K. Naito M. Takeoka S. Tsuchida E. Ishimura Y. Tamatani T. Suematsu M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 604-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Amounts of the transfected protein in these cells were examined in their cellular lysates by Western blot and fluorescence-activated cell sorting analyses using GTS-1, the MoAb against HO-1, as described previously (19Goda N. Suzuki K. Naito M. Takeoka S. Tsuchida E. Ishimura Y. Tamatani T. Suematsu M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 604-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 21Makino N. Suematsu M. Sugiura Y. Morikawa H. Shiomi S. Goda N. Sano T. Nimura Y. Sugimachi K. Ishimura Y. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 32-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Several different clones of the wild type and H25A mutant HO-1 transfectants were obtained through these procedures. HO activities in the established cell lines were determined by measuring the formation of bilirubin as described previously (22Yoshida T. Kikuchi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 8479-8482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were harvested and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline at pH 7.0. To remove the insoluble fraction, the cells were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 solution containing 150 mm NaCl, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) for 1 h on ice. The supernatants were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The reaction mixture contained the following in a final volume of 300 μl: glucose 6-phosphate (1 mm; Roche Molecular Biochemicals), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (0.167 units/ml; Roche Molecular Biochemicals), NADP (0.8 mm), hemin (30 μm), MgCl2 (2 μm), NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (0.1 mg/ml; Gentest, Woburn, MA), rat liver cytosol (6.7 mg of protein/ml), potassium phosphate buffer (18.3 mm, pH 7.4), and the supernatant from the transfected cells. Incubation was carried out at 37 °C for 30 min. An equal volume of chloroform was added to the reaction mixture, and bilirubin generated was extracted into the chloroform fraction. After centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 10 min, the amount of bilirubin in the chloroform extract was examined. Cells cultured in the flasks were inoculated onto 24-well plates containing RPMI 1640 culture medium and 10% fetal calf serum at a concentration at 2 × 105cells/ml. Ten main protocols were employed to compare differences in effects of administration of various interventions on H2O2- and t-BuOOH-induced injury of U937 cells. The cells in the first group were treated with the culture medium alone, while those in the second and third groups were treated with 400 μm H2O2, 400 μm t-BuOOH for 2 h. The cells in the next seven groups were treated with the same concentration of H2O2 or t-BuOOH for 2 h following an incubation with one of the following reagents: zinc protporphyrin-IX (ZnPP, 1–10 μm; Porphyrin Products, Logan, UT) at 12 h; an iron chelator, deferoxamine mesylate (DFO, 1 mm); a lipophilic iron chelator, 2,2′-dipyridyl (DPD, 1 mm); catalase (1000 units/ml); and Me2SO (2%); 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (ATZ, 1–10 mm), a catalase inhibitor; andl-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine (BSO, 1 μm-1 mm), a reagent that depletes intracellular glutathione contents. Cell viability of U937 cells and LCL cells was determined by the methylthiazole tetrazolium assay as described previously (Cell Count Kit 8; Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan). To this end, 100 μl of the cell suspension (2 × 105cells/ml) were plated per a well on 24-well plates and cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum. After cells underwent exposure to reagents described above, they were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in the medium, and plated in a 96-well plate for 1 h. Ten μl of the reaction mixture containing 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide was added in each well. After a 2-h incubation under 95% N2, 5% CO2 at 37 °C, the solubilized formazan product was quantified spectrophotometrically using a microplate reader. Absorbance was measured at 450 nm. Activities of catalase and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were examined in cell lines established in the current study. Briefly, catalase activity was determined by monitoring the rate of decomposition of H2O2 into oxygen through an oxygen-sensing microelectrode as described previously (23Meerhof L.J. Roos D. J. Reticuloendothel. Soc. 1980; 28: 419-425PubMed Google Scholar). GPx activity was measured by a method described elsewhere (24Prohaska J.R. Ganther H.E. J. Neurochem. 1976; 27: 1379-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The 100-μl assay mixture contained 1.85 mm reduced GSH, 0.09 units of yeast glutathione reductase, 185 μm NADPH, and 100 μl of the sonicated cell suspension in 10 mm TE buffer, pH 8.0. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 750 μm t-BuOOH of a 10-μl volume to a mixture of the other ingredients in 100 μl. The GPx activity was quantitated from the decrease in NADPH absorbance at 340 nm. Total cellular contents of glutathione and those of the reduced form alone (GSH) were measured as described previously (25Tietze F. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 27: 502-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (5556) Google Scholar). Total cellular RNA was isolated from U-937 cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). A total of 4 μg of total RNA were reverse-transcribed in 50 μl of reaction mixture containing the RT buffer (Invitrogen), 10 mm dithiothreitol (Invitrogen), 1 mm each deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) (Applied Biosystems), 1 unit/μl RNase inhibitor (Promega, Madison, WI), 0.01 μg/μl pd(N)6 random primer (Amersham Biosciences) and 10 units/μl Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). PCRs were performed in a final volume of 25 μl of the PCR buffer (Applied Biosystems) containing a 0.2 mm concentration of each dNTP, a 0.5 μm concentration of each primer (Invitrogen), and 0.025 units/μl Taq polymerase (Applied Biosystems). The amount of cDNAs added to the reaction mixture was normalized by the intensity of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase amplicon. Aliquots were electrophoresed in 2% agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide (WAKO, Osaka, Japan). Primers used in this study were as follows: catalase sense, 5′-GGT TTG GCC TCA CAA GGA CTA C-3′; antisense, 5′-TCA TTG GCA GTG TTG AAT CTC C-3′; GPx-1 sense, 5′-GGA GAA CGC CAA GAA CGA AG-3′; antisense, 5′-CAA TGG TCT GGA AGC GGC-3′; GPx-4 sense, 5′-TTG CCG CCT ACT GAA GCC-3′; antisense, 5′-TTC GGT CTT GCC TCA CTG G-3′. Data in the present study are expressed as means ± S.E. of measurements. Differences in the mean values among the groups were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance combined with Fisher's multiple comparison test. pvalues of <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Fig.1 illustrates characterization of the expression of HO-1 protein in U937 cells. As seen in A, parent and mock transfectant cells did not show any notable expression of the HO-1 protein. On the other hand, the cells transfected with the wild type and mutant HO-1 cDNA displayed a marked expression of the protein at 32 kDa. Several different cell clones of the wild type (H1A, H1B, and H1C) and H25A mutant transfectants (mH1A, mH1B, and mH1C) that expressed comparable amounts of the protein became available for the current analyses. These cell clones obtained in the current study displayed a single peak population and expressed comparable amounts of the HO-1 protein (Fig. 1 B). Under these circumstances, the wild type transfectants exhibited ∼5-fold elevation of the catalytic activities versus the mock transfectant, while the H25A mutant transfectant did not show any notable elevation of the activities as compared with the parent and mock transfectant cells (Fig. 1 C). These results indicate that the H25A mutant transfectant cells overexpress the protein lacking the catalytic activities. As seen in Fig. 2, these cell lines exhibited distinct susceptibility to exposure to H2O2. Namely, cells transfected with the wild type HO-1 cDNA (H1A, H1B, and H1C) were more susceptible to H2O2 than parent and mock transfectant cells. By contrast, the H25A mutant transfectant cells (mH1A, mH1B, and mH1C) that expressed comparable amounts of the protein as the wild type transfectants became less sensitive to H2O2 as compared with the control and mock-transfected cells. Observation that the HO-1 gene transfection significantly altered oxidative susceptibility of U937 cells led us to examine if these events occurred dependently on the catalytic activities of the enzyme. To address this question, effects of ZnPP, a competitive inhibitor of the HO reaction, were examined in the mock transfectant, the wild type (H1A), and H25A mutant HO-1-overexpressing (mH1A) U937 cells. As shown in Fig. 3, the application of ZnPP at 5 μm decreased the H2O2-induced cytotoxicity in these cell lines. On the other hand, the same concentration of copper protoporphyrin-IX, a metalloprotoporphyrin that does not inhibit the HO activity, did not suppress the cytotoxic effect of H2O2 (data not shown). These results suggested the catalytic activity of HO could be a determinant of the H2O2-elicited cytotoxicity and further encouraged us to investigate roles of divalent iron, an end product of the heme degradation as a catalyst of H2O2-induced oxyradical propagation. Treatment of the cells with the iron chelator DFO at 1 mmsignificantly attenuated the H2O2-induced cell death in all of these cell lines. On the other hand, the iron-saturated DFO (Fe-DFO) did not exhibit such an inhibitory action on the H2O2-induced cell damages, suggesting that effects of DFO result from its action to chelate free iron. Furthermore, DPD, another iron chelator with greater lipophilicity than DFO, attenuated the cell injury almost completely at 1 mm. These results showed that deprivation of iron reduces differences in H2O2 susceptibility among the cells. Considering the results shown in Fig. 1, these results collectively suggest that divalent iron generated through the HO reaction is a determinant of the cell susceptibility to the H2O2 exposure. Results showing distinct susceptibility to H2O2 led us to hypothesize that the HO-1 gene transfection could alter the capacity to scavenge the peroxide. To address this hypothesis, differences in two major enzyme systems for elimination of H2O2 such as catalase and glutathione peroxidase were examined among the cells. As seen in Fig. 4 A, three different cell lines of the wild type HO-1 transfectants exhibited significant decreases in the activity of catalase. By contrast, those of the H25A mutant HO-1 transfectants inversely increased their catalase activities approximately 2-fold. As examined by RT-PCR analyses (Fig. 4 B), a wild type HO-1 transfectant (H1A) decreased its expression of the catalase mRNA. On the other hand, an H25A mutant HO-1 transfectant (mH1A) significantly increased the same gene product. Two other clones for the mutant HO-1 transfectants also exhibited a similar increase in the catalase expression (data not shown). These results suggest that the mutant gene transfection increases catalase at both mRNA and protein levels. We then examined differences in total activities of GPx, expression of type 1 and 4 glutathione peroxidases (GPx-1 and -4), and total glutathione contents among the cells. As seen in Fig.5 A, the cells undergoing the H25A mutant gene transfection exhibited a 25% reduction of the total GPx activity. This reduction by the mutant transfection appeared to result from decreased expression of GPx-4 rather than that of GPx-1, so far as judged by the corresponding RT-PCR analyses in Fig.5 B. Considering that the ability of this enzyme system to eliminate H2O2 is thought to depend on the content of glutathione rather than that of the enzyme (26Flohe L. Free Radicals in Biology. V. Academic Press, Inc., New York1982: 223-254Crossref Google Scholar), we next examined total glutathione contents in the cells. As seen in Fig.5 C (open bars), the total glutathione contents displayed a 1.8-fold elevation in the mutant transfectantversus the mock or wild type transfectants. This elevation appeared to result from an increase in the reduced form of glutathione (GSH; closed bars), a compound responsible for amelioration of oxidative stress. These results showed that the wild type and mutant HO-1 transfectants exhibit distinct responses of the peroxide-scavenging systems. Namely, the wild type transfectant reduces the catalase activity but does not exhibit any notable changes in the glutathione peroxidase system, whereas the H25A mutant transfectant increased both the activity of catalase and cellular glutathione contents simultaneously. To examine whether the decreased sensitivity of H25A mutant HO-1 cells to H2O2 could depend on the activity of catalase and/or cellular glutathione contents, the effects of ATZ, a potent inhibitor of catalase, or BSO, a reagent depleting glutathione, were examined. As seen in Fig.6, the H2O2-induced cytotoxicity was significantly enhanced by pretreatment with either ATZ or BSO. The enhancement of cell susceptibility after the pretreatment was comparable among different cell types (i.e. mock, wild type (H1A), and mutant (mH1A) transfectants). Collectively, H25A mutant HO-1 gene transfection turned out to render cells more resistant to H2O2 through mechanisms involving up-regulation of catalase expression and cellular contents of reduced glutathione, suggesting a novel antioxidative action of the activity-lacking mutant protein. Results in Figs. 1 and 2 showing that the wild type HO-1 gene transfection aggravates H2O2 cytotoxicity led us to hypothesize that the HO-1 transfectant could also increase its susceptibility to other types of hydroperoxide. To address this hypothesis, differences in susceptibility to t-BuOOH were examined among the cells (Fig. 7). Application of the peroxide at 400 μm markedly reduced the number of viable cells in all of these groups, whereas both the wild type (H1A) and mutant HO-1 (mH1A) transfectants exhibited greater cell survival than the mock transfectant. Namely, the wild type HO-1 gene transfectant displayed quite different pictures of the susceptibility between H2O2 and t-BuOOH. We inquired whether iron could be involved in the mechanisms fort-BuOOH-induced injury as was observed in the H2O2 injury system. As seen in theright columns of Fig. 7, pretreatment with DFO or DPD attenuated the hydroperoxide-induced cell injury almost completely in these cell lines. Most importantly, the treatment of these chelators canceled out different susceptibility to the peroxide among the mock-, wild type (H1A)-, and H25A mutant (mH1A)-transfected cells. Results showing increased resistance of H25A mutant transfectant cells against hydroperoxides led us to further inquire whether the same cells could also exhibit a comparable resistance against hemin, the substrate of the HO reaction that is known to enhance oxidative stress as a pro-oxidant. Fig.8 illustrated the effects of 12-h exposure to 400 μm hemin on viability of different U937 cell lines. When transfected with the wild type HO-1 cDNA, U937 cells did not reduce their viability upon the hemin exposure, and one of the clones that displayed the greatest activity of HO (H1A; Fig.1 C) exhibited a significant resistance against the stimulus. On the other hand, the mutant HO-1-transfected cells (mH1A, mH1B, and mH1C) exhibited greater susceptibility to hemin than the mock transfectant, indicating distinct susceptibility to this particular pro-oxidant as compared with H2O2 andt-BuOOH. These results tempted us to hypothesize whether the cell overexpressing the activity-lacking mutant HO-1 might display greater cell susceptibility to hemin through cancellation of intrinsic HO activities. In order to address this hypothesis, we compared oxidative susceptibility of the HO-1-null LCL (YK-14) that was established from the first human case of the gene deficiency. As seen in Fig. 9 A, the YK-14 cells displayed greater sensitivity to hemin than two different LCL cells expressing HO-1 normally. On the other hand, when susceptibility of these cell lines to H2O2 was compared, there were no significant differences between YK-14 and two different control LCL cells (Fig. 9 B). These results suggest that the H25A mutant transfectants exhibit greater susceptibility to hemin that is analogous to the HO-1-deficient cells.Figure 9Susceptibility of LCL established from a patient with HO-1 deficiency to oxidative stress.

HO-1 is a stress-inducible protein that modulates cell susceptibility against oxidative stress, and mechanisms for such alterations in the susceptibility have been thought to depend exclusively on its catalytic activities to reduce pro-oxidants such as protoheme-IX and to generate biliverdin and/or bilirubin as antioxidants. Since the same reaction also provides divalent iron simultaneously, the overexpression of HO-1 was shown to cause an increased cell susceptibility to H2O2under certain circumstances, particularly where the iron-mediated oxidant propagation overwhelms antioxidant properties of the HO reaction. Overexpression of the mutant protein was therefore expected to interfere with the binding of naturally occurring HO-1 to NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase, the electron transfer system necessary to execute the catalytic reaction of HO, and thus suppress the intrinsic enzyme activities, displaying a phenotype analogous to dominant-negative effects. Such a hypothesis was plausible, so far as both the mutant-overexpressed U937 cells and the YK-14 cell established from the HO-1-deficient patient comparably displayed greater susceptibility to hemin, the substrate of the HO reaction, than their control cells. However, considering results showing the cell susceptibility to other pro-oxidants such as H2O2 and t-BuOOH, overexpression of H25A mutant HO-1 appears to alter the sensitivity to these oxidative insults through different mechanisms. Current results on the mutant HO-1-mediated alterations in cellular peroxide-scavenging systems such as the gluthathione-glutathione peroxide pathway and catalase raise several important questions against previously proposed mechanisms by which the wild type HO-1 overexpression leads to alterations in oxidative susceptibility. Previous studies suggested that overexpression of HO-1 causes increased susceptibility of cells to H2O2 through an elevation of divalent iron available for Fenton reaction (16Kvam E. Hejmadi V. Ryter S. Pourzand C. Tyrrell R.M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1191-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 17Suttner D.M. Dennery P.A. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1800-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). If the increase in the HO-derived iron available as a result of the gene transfection simply dictates the oxidative susceptibility, the same cell should exhibit a similar susceptibility to t-BuOOH, since the cytotoxicity of this peroxide is also aggravated by iron-mediated oxidant propagation. However, such a scenario is obviously inconsistent with the current result showing that the same HO-1 gene transfectant displayed decreased susceptibility tot-BuOOH. To understand such a discrepancy of the oxidative susceptibility between different peroxides, several different possibilities should be taken into account. First, a recent investigation by Wilks and Ortiz de Montellano (27Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22357-22362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is of biological importance, showing that H2O2 but not other organic hydroperoxides, such as t-BuOOH, could serve as a substrate of the HO reaction; besides molecular oxygen, the former helps HO-dependent oxidative cleavage of heme into verdoheme even in the absence of NADPH, while the latter does not undergo the reaction. Accordingly, H2O2could easily drive the delivery of divalent iron in the wild type HO-1 transfectant and increase the susceptibility to greater extents thant-BuOOH. Second, as seen in the current study, the expression of catalase at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels is down-regulated in the wild type HO-1 transfectant as compared with that in the mock transfectant and parent cells. Since blockade of catalase by ATZ canceled out the difference in the susceptibility among the cells, the reduction in its activity by the gene transfection appears to result in the increased susceptibility to H2O2. Furthermore, this observation simultaneously explains the absence of alterations in the susceptibility to t-BuOOH, an oxidant that is not degraded by catalase. At present, the mechanisms by which the HO-1 gene transfection down-regulates the expression of catalase are unknown. Moreover, since the transfection with the mutant protein conversely up-regulated catalase, further investigation should be necessary to address whether the expression of this H2O2-scavenging enzyme is elevated in the mutant transfectant as a result of the aforementioned dominant negative effects on the cells. However, the present results first suggest that the HO-1 gene transfection could enhance the H2O2 cytotoxicity not only through enhancement of iron-mediated oxyradical propagation but also through down-regulation of catalase expression. Distinct from the wild type transfectant, the activity-lacking H25A mutant HO-1 transfectant not only up-regulated the catalase activity but also increased the cellular contents of glutathione and thereby acquired resistance to both organic and inorganic hydroperoxides. These results suggest that cells and/or tissues overexpressing the H25A mutant HO-1 protein become less sensitive to oxidative stress caused by these hydroperoxides. Since HO-1-deficient patients with a function-directed point mutation have never been reported, the biological and physiologic significance of such a mutant protein remains largely unknown. However, the current study sheds light on a possibility that patients with such a mutation, if any, could hardly be discovered clinically because of antioxidative properties of the mutant protein. Different from the first human case of the HO-1 deficiency, who totally lacked the protein expression of HO-1 through a heterogeneous homozygote of the corresponding gene, such a point-mutated subject exposed to stressors might induce the mutant HO-1 protein and thereby increase the catalase expression and cellular glutathione contents. Under these circumstances, enhancement of oxidative susceptibility of cells and tissues that is evident generally in the HO-1 knockout mice or its human homologue could hardly be observed as phenotypic changes. Considering a marked susceptibility of the mutant transfectant to hemin in vitro, human cases with such a functionally critical mutation of HO-1 might be predictable if the gene is analyzed among patients who undergo acute overloading of free heme and resultant tissue injury without displaying notable hyperbilirubinemia under varied clinical conditions (e.g.hemolysis, sepsis). Novel biological actions of the activity-lacking mutant HO-1 protein suggested in the current study deserve further studies provided that the knock-in mice display any notable resistance against oxidative stress in vivo.

The molecular components of the mesangial cell response to high glucose stress are still being defined. With the completion of the human genome project, the monitoring of changes in the cellular transcriptome in response to disease-mimicking stimuli provides a powerful methodology for dissecting the molecular basis of disease. Here we employed a PCR-based technique, namely suppression-subtractive hybridization (SSH), to assess the influence of high extracellular glucose on gene expression by cultured human mesangial cells. This technique has the advantage over most other PCR-based techniques, such as differential display PCR, of including a normalization step that removes bias for the more abundant cellular transcripts. SSH may be more sensitive than most currently available oligonucleotide microarray systems, being able to detect relatively small changes in gene expression down to 1.5-fold as judged by Northern blot analysis. SSH identified some 200 genes that are differentially expressed by mesangial cells exposed to high glucose, many of which are potential modulators of mesangial cell contractility, turnover, and matrix metabolism. Of particular interest was a prominent cohort of genes that contribute to the regulation of actin filament growth, dissolution, and organization given emerging evidence that the actin cytoskeleton is a major target for high glucose-triggered injury in DN and a contributor to the development of diabetic glomerulosclerosis. Primary cultures of human mesangial cells were obtained from Clonetics or were isolated using standard techniques (8Brady H.R. Denton M.D. Jimenez W. Takata S. Palliser D. Brenner B.M. Kidney Int. 1992; 42: 480-487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Cells were propagated in MCDB 131 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (passages 5–9), and they were maintained in medium containing either 5 or 30 mmd-glucose for 7 days. Culture medium was replenished three times during this period to maintain glucose levels in the desired range. In additional experiments, cells were serum-starved for 24 h in MCDB 131 medium and subsequently treated with 10 ng/ml TGF-β1 (R & D Systems). The role of PKC on actin cytoskeleton regulatory protein mRNA levels in response to high glucose was investigated by culturing the mesangial cells in either 30 mm glucose or 30 mm glucose plus the PKC inhibitor GF 109203X for 7 days. The role of ROS on actin cytoskeleton regulatory protein mRNA levels in response to high glucose was investigated by culturing mesangial cells in either 30 mm glucose or 30 mm glucose with carbonyl cyanidem-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) (Sigma) (0.5 μm), an uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation, for 7 days (7Nishikawa T. Edelstein D. Du X.L. Yamagishi S. Matsumura T. Kaneda Y. Yorek M.A. Beebe D. Oates P.J. Hammes H.P. Giardino I. Brownlee M. Nature. 2000; 404: 787-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3671) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of cyclical stretch, cells cultured on flexible plates were subjected to repeated cycles of computer-controlled, vacuum-driven mechanical stretch and relaxation using the Flexercell Strain Unit (Flex Cell International, Hillsborough, NH) as described previously (9McMahon R.

For investigation of the actin cytoskeleton structure by fluorescence microscopy mesangial cells were cultured on Permanox two-well slides (Labtek; Nalgene Nunc). The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min. The slides were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and the actin cytoskeleton was stained with rhodamine-phalloidin complex (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) as directed by the manufacturer. The role of actin cytoskeleton disassembly on actin cytoskeletal regulatory protein mRNA levels was investigated by culturing mesangial cells in 1 μmcytochalasin D for 1 or 6 h, following serum deprivation for 24 h (11Barberis L. Wary K.K. Fiucci G. Liu F. Hirsch E. Brancaccio M. Altruda F. Tarone G. Giancotti F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36532-36540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Nine male uninephrectomized Munich-Wistar rats were rendered diabetic with streptozotocin (STZ). The blood glucose levels in the uninephrectomized STZ rats at 2 and 4 months following STZ administration were typically in the range of 300–320 mg/dl. This compares with blood glucose levels in age-matched control animals of between 50 and 80 mg/dl. RNA was extracted from the kidney cortex as described previously (9McMahon R. Murphy M. Clarkson M. Taal M. Mackenzie H.S. Godson C. Martin F. Brady H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9901-9904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). With respect to the remnant kidney model, male Munich-Wistar rats (260–290 g) underwent 5/6 nephrectomy as previously described (12Taal M.W. Zandi-Nejad K. Weening B. Shahsafaei A. Kato S. Lee K.W.

Renal cortical tissue distant from the scar site was excised and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for subsequent RNA extraction. Total RNA was isolated subsequently using RNAzol solution (TEL-test Inc.). SSH was performed with the PCR-SELECT cDNA subtraction kit (CLONTECH) as described before (10Murphy M. Godson C. Cannon S. Kato S. Mackenzie H.S. Martin F. Brady H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5830-5834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). PCR products generated by SSH were subcloned into the PCR 2.1 vector using the original TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) and subsequent cDNA cloning, and sequence analysis was carried out exactly as previously reported (10Murphy M.

Northern blots were performed as described previously (10Murphy M. Godson C. Cannon S. Kato S. Mackenzie H.S. Martin F. Brady H.R. J. Biol.

PCR products used to generate probes for actin cytoskeletal regulatory protein transcripts, fibronectin, and GAPDH used in Northern analysis were generated as reported before (10Murphy M. Godson C.

Profilin probes were generated by PCR amplification using primers for either rat or human profilin (rat sense, GGTGTCCTGGTAGGCAAAGA; rat antisense, TTTGGCACCAATAAGGGAAA; human sense, CATCGTGGGCTACAAGGACT; human antisense, ACACCTTCTTTGCCCATCAG). For reverse transcription-PCR, 2 μg of total RNA was transcribed as described previously (10Murphy M. Godson C. Cannon S. Kato S. Mackenzie H.S. Martin F. Brady H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5830-5834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of cDNA were subsequently amplified by PCR using specific primers for human Diaphanous 1 ( hDia1 )(GenBankTM/EBI accession number NM_005219; sense, CCTCAAGTTTCCAGACGAGC; antisense, GGTTCTCCTTGACTGCTTGC) and human Diaphanous 2 ( hDia2 ) (GenBankTM/EBI accession number NM_007309; sense, CACCAAACGTGAGATGGTTG; antisense, CCTTCATGGCCAAAGTTGTT). Sequence analysis of 100 clones from the cDNA library generated by SSH revealed induction of 70 known genes when mesangial cells were propagated in 30 mm glucose. Twenty-six cDNAs showing identity with or similarity to expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were also induced in addition to six cDNAs (IHG-1, IHG 3–8) that were not found in either the GenBankTM/EBI or EST data bases using BLAST searches (Table I). Among the up-regulated genes, several were isolated from more than one clone; the most often encountered of these was fibronectin, the extracellular matrix protein known to be up-regulated by high glucosein vitro and in vivo (3Ayo S.H. Radnik R.A. Garoni J.A. Glass II, W.F. Kreisberg J.I. Am. J. Pathol. 1990; 136: 1339-1348PubMed Google Scholar). For ease of analysis, these genes have been divided into cohorts based on known function. Sequence analysis of 100 down-regulated cDNA clones identified 59 known genes, 37 cDNAs with homology to ESTs and 4 previously undescribed sequences. Table II shows the list of mesangial cell-expressed genes, ESTs, and unique uncharacterized cDNAs identified by SSH as being down-regulated in response to mesangial cell culture in high glucose.Table ISummary of cDNAs identified by SSH as being upregulated in mesangial cells cultured in high glucoseGene clusterGeneAccession no.Cytoskeleton-associatedARP-3NM_013943proteinsCyclase-associated proteinL12168_ASAP1NM_018482CaldesmonM64110MRLCD50372ProfilinJ03191T-plastinM2229914–3-3ζM86400Extracellular matrixFibronectinX02761proteins and modulatorsFibulin-3U03877Lysyl oxidaseL16895Plasminogen activator/inhibitorX04744ThrombospondinX14787Cell adhesion/growth regulationChloride intracellular channel 4NM_013943Osteoblast-specific factor 2D13665MRGX1-aMRGX, mortality factor related gene x.AF100620Translationally controlled tumor proteinX16064SignalingProtein kinase ANM_002731Mek binding partnerAF201947MAP4K31-bMAP4K3, mitogen-activated kinase kinase kinase kinase 3.NM_003618PosttranscriptionalElongation factor 1-αX03558processingα NacAF054187Poly(A)-binding proteinY00345Apoptosis-relatedKIAA0396AB007856L7 riboproteinX52967FasM67454Stress-relatedFerritin light subunitM10119UbiquitinX04803RBM 31-cRBM 3, RNA binding motif protein 3.U28686Transcription-relatedTrip15AF120268Sur 2NM_0159779Growth factor-cytokine-relatedConnective tissue growth factor1-fAs described extensively in Refs. 9 and10.U14750Gremlin1-fAs described extensively in Refs. 9 and10.AF110137Ribosomal proteinsL17X52967S13L01124OthersActivin type II A receptorD31770Integral membrane proteinL38961Heterogenous nuclearNM_002139Ribonucleoprotein GATPase synthase 6D38112NORPEG1-dNORPEG, novel retinal epithelial cell gene.AF155135MEA1-eMEA, male enhanced antigen.M27937Novel sequencesIHG-1AF110136IHG-3AX034343IHG-4AF411095IHG-5AF411096IHG-6AF411097IHG-7AF411098IHG-8AF411099Upregulated ESTsAW237202, AW069272, AI378007,AW195845, R69818, AA327051, R28131, AA234375, AA082761, AI089193,AA370706, AI627881, AI362404, AI127517, AI37800, AW195845, AA418168,AA082761, AI12517, AA232605, AA151085, D60236, AA640836, AA716418,AA421722, AA3457341-a MRGX, mortality factor related gene x.1-b MAP4K3, mitogen-activated kinase kinase kinase kinase 3.1-c RBM 3, RNA binding motif protein 3.1-d NORPEG, novel retinal epithelial cell gene.1-e MEA, male enhanced antigen.1-f As described extensively in Refs. 9McMahon R.

Osterby R. Anderson P.W. Hsueh W.A. Brenner B.M. Brenner and Rector's The Kidney. 5th Ed. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia1996: 1864-1883Google Scholar). A notable finding among the group of up-regulated genes designated as matrix-related was lysyl oxidase, a copper-dependent amine oxidase that initiates the covalent cross-linking between and within the molecular units of collagen and elastin (14Kagan H.M. Pathol. Res. Pract. 1994; 190: 910-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Up-regulation of lysyl oxidase, as has been documented in both pulmonary and hepatic fibrosis, may retard matrix turnover and favor progressive glomerulosclerosis (14Kagan H.M. Pathol. Res. Pract. 1994; 190: 910-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 15Counts D.F. Evans J.N. Dipetrillo T.A. Sterling Jr., K.M. Kelley J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1981; 219: 675-678PubMed Google Scholar). Intriguingly, several novel biological roles have been postulated for lysyl oxidase recently, including a potent chemotactic response by peripheral mononuclear cells to purified lysyl oxidase (16Lazarus H.M. Cruikshank W.W. Narasimhan N. Kagan H.M. Center D.M. Matrix Biol. 1995; 14: 727-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This is relevant to DN given evidence implicating macrophage influx in the early stages of DN. The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of proteins involved in the degradation of matrix components. MMP-1 is a collagenase that initiates the breakdown of collagens I, II, and III (17McLennan S.V. Yue D.K. Turtle J.R. Nephron. 1998; 79: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A coincident decrease in MMP-1 activity (Table II), as revealed by SSH, would favor the continued accumulation of these components with eventual obliteration of the capillary tuft. This finding complements in vivoevidence of a decrease in MMP-1 expression in the diabetic kidney (18Nakamura T. Fukui M. Ebihara I. Osada S. Tomino Y. Koide H. Ren. Physiol. Biochem. 1994; 17: 316-325PubMed Google Scholar). Other functional gene clusters detected as up-regulated by glucose stress included genes involved in the regulation of apoptosis (i.e. Fas), cell growth (i.e. connective tissue growth factor and gremlin), post-transcriptional processing (i.e. elongation factor 1-α and α Nac), and intracellular signaling pathways (i.e. protein kinase A and mitogen-activated kinase kinase kinase kinase 3) (Table I). Analysis of the 59 known mesangial cell genes down-regulated in response to culture in high glucose revealed functional clusters involved in the regulation of matrix metabolism (plasminogen activator), cell cycle regulation (cyclin C), cell signaling (SH3BRGL), and gene transcription (i.e. hSNF2b and transducin-like enhancer protein 4) (TableII). High glucose levels may perturb cellular function through intracellular glucose-specific actions or by increasing the osmolality of the extracellular fluid. However, we have found that the classic osmolarity control, namely mannitol, is not necessarily helpful and may lead to false conclusions. We have shown previously (10Murphy M. Godson C. Cannon S. Kato S. Mackenzie H.S. Martin F. Brady H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5830-5834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) that mannitol induces changes in the expression of some but not all genes that are induced by high glucose and recognized as key players in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy. Examples include fibronectin, thrombospondin, and connective tissue growth factor (10Murphy M. Godson C. Cannon S. Kato S. Mackenzie H.S. Martin F. Brady H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5830-5834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). In the case of the genes that encode actin cytoskeletal regulatory proteins, mannitol induces a modest increase in caldesmon and profilin expression, a slight increase in myosin regulatory light chain (MRLC) and T-plastin expression, and no change in actin-related protein (ARP)-3 levels. When both mannitol and glucose induce the expression of a gene, they may do so by independent pathways or may share an osmolarity-related component. The latter may also be relevant to diabetes in vivo given the cyclical supraphysiological increments in osmolarity that typify the postprandial state in this disease. The largest functional gene cluster identified as up-regulated in response to culture in high glucose was that encoding actin cytoskeleton regulatory proteins. This comprised 10 of the 70 clones encoding proteins of known function identified from the GenBankTM data base (Table I). To confirm the differential induction of genes encoding actin cytoskeleton regulatory proteins, Northern analysis was performed on RNA extracted from independent mesangial cell cultures. Fibronectin mRNA levels were assessed as a “positive control” given previous evidence that this gene is glucose-responsive in vitro and in vivo(3Ayo S.H. Radnik R.A. Garoni J.A. Glass II, W.F. Kreisberg J.I. Am. J. Pathol. 1990; 136: 1339-1348PubMed Google Scholar, 19Dixon A.J. Burns J. Dunnill M.S. McGee J.O. J. Clin. Pathol. 1980; 33: 1021-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis using probes specific for the eight actin cytoskeletal regulatory protein genes identified by SSH confirmed enhanced expression in all cases (Fig.1 A). The differential expression of this functional class in response to glucose was noteworthy given the roles played by several of these actin cytoskeleton regulatory proteins in the growth and dissolution of actin filaments. In addition, increasing evidence indicates that cytoskeletal disassembly contributes to the mesangial cell and vascular smooth muscle cell hyporesponsiveness to vasopressors in models of DN bothin vitro and in vivo (20Cortes P.

Templeton D. Whiteside C.I. Lab. Invest. 1995; 73: 372-383PubMed Google Scholar). ADP-ribosylation factor GTPase-activating Protein (ASAP1) is an actin cytoskeletal regulatory protein identified here as being up-regulated in response to high glucose. ASAP1 has been implicated in regulating membrane trafficking and cytoskeletal assembly. Overexpression of ASAP1 has been demonstrated to interfere with cytoskeletal remodeling events and focal adhesion turnover (22Randazzo P.A. Andrade J. Miura K. Brown M.T. Long Y.Q. Stauffer S.

Birkenfeld J. Betz H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 411-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Studies with a dominant negative mutant 14-3-3ζ suggest additional roles in the control of the cell cycle and differential regulation of the MAPK cascade (24Xing H. Zhang S. Weinheimer C. Kovacs A.

Kidney Int. 2001; 60: 858-871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Cyclase-associated protein is a ubiquitous conserved heterodimeric actin cytoskeletal regulatory protein that binds to the barbed end of the actin filament and prevents further incorporation of G-actin into F-actin, effectively halting filament growth (29Stevenson V.A. Theurkauf W.E. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R695-R697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Cyclase-associated protein has a multidomain structure and includes a domain that interacts with Src homology 3 domain-containing proteins, including the tyrosine kinase cAbl, and may well help to integrate signal transduction events to cytoskeletal reorganization (30Freeman N.L.

MRLC is a component of myosin filaments and plays an important role via its interaction with myosin light chain kinase in the regulation of cell contractile activity (31Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 522: 177-185Crossref Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). Particularly interesting was the enhanced expression of two genes, namely profilin and ARP-3, which encode proteins involved in key regulatory pathways of actin cytoskeletal turnover (32Blanchoin L. Pollard T.D. Mullins R.D. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1273-1282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In light of our identifying a cohort of actin cytoskeletal regulatory protein genes as being induced in our model system of DN, it is interesting that cytoskeletal alteration is postulated to be a contributor to glomerulosclerosis (20Cortes P.

https://openalex.org/W2094457584,"Excessive transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) activity in hyperglycemia contributes to the development of diabetic nephropathy. Glucose stimulation of TGF-β activity and matrix synthesis are dependent on autocrine thrombospondin 1 (TSP1) to convert latent TGF-β to its biologically active form. The mechanisms by which glucose regulates TSP1 are not known. High glucose inhibits nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability and decreased NO increases TGF-β activity and extracellular matrix accumulation. Yet, the impact of NO signaling on TSP1 activation of TGF-β is unknown. We tested the role of NO signaling in the regulation of TSP1 expression and TSP1-dependent TGF-β activity in rat mesangial cells exposed to high glucose. On exposure to 30 mmglucose, NO accumulation in the conditioned media and intracellular cGMP levels were significantly decreased. The addition of an NO donor prevented the glucose-dependent increase in TSP1 mRNA, protein, and TGF-β bioactivity. The effects of the NO donor were blocked by ODQ (a soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor) or Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPS (an inhibitor of cGMP-dependent protein kinase). These effects of high glucose were also reversed by the nitric-oxide synthase cofactor tetrahyrobiopterin (BH4). These results show that high glucose mediates increases in TSP1 expression and TSP1-dependent TGF-β bioactivity through down-modulation of NO-cGMP-dependent protein kinase signaling. Excessive transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) activity in hyperglycemia contributes to the development of diabetic nephropathy. Glucose stimulation of TGF-β activity and matrix synthesis are dependent on autocrine thrombospondin 1 (TSP1) to convert latent TGF-β to its biologically active form. The mechanisms by which glucose regulates TSP1 are not known. High glucose inhibits nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability and decreased NO increases TGF-β activity and extracellular matrix accumulation. Yet, the impact of NO signaling on TSP1 activation of TGF-β is unknown. We tested the role of NO signaling in the regulation of TSP1 expression and TSP1-dependent TGF-β activity in rat mesangial cells exposed to high glucose. On exposure to 30 mmglucose, NO accumulation in the conditioned media and intracellular cGMP levels were significantly decreased. The addition of an NO donor prevented the glucose-dependent increase in TSP1 mRNA, protein, and TGF-β bioactivity. The effects of the NO donor were blocked by ODQ (a soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor) or Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPS (an inhibitor of cGMP-dependent protein kinase). These effects of high glucose were also reversed by the nitric-oxide synthase cofactor tetrahyrobiopterin (BH4). These results show that high glucose mediates increases in TSP1 expression and TSP1-dependent TGF-β bioactivity through down-modulation of NO-cGMP-dependent protein kinase signaling. transforming growth factor-β rat mesangial cells thrombospondin 1 plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-guanosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPS DetaNONOate (Z-1-[2-aminoethyl-N-(2-ammonioethyl)amino] diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate) cGMP-dependent protein kinase 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1 tetrahydrobiopterin NO synthase Hyperglycemia is a crucial factor in the development of diabetic renal complications, with multiple lines of evidence suggesting that high glucose stimulates an increase in TGF-β1 activity (1Wolf G.

This is important because TGF-β is a key mediator of the fibrotic changes in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy (4Iwano M. Kubo A. Nishino T. Sato H. Nishioka H. Akai Y. Kurioka H. Fujii Y.

TGF-β is synthesized and secreted as latent complex (latent TGF-β). It must be converted to the active state before binding to its receptors and eliciting cellular functions. Latent TGF-β can be activated by a number of factors, including heat, extreme pH, plasmin, altered glycosylation, integrin binding, and reactive oxygen species (7Rifkin D.B. Kojima S. Abe M.

However, there is increasing evidence that the extracellular matrix protein, thrombospondin 1 (TSP1), is a major physiologic regulator of TGF-β activation (10Schultz-Cherry S. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J.

TSP1, a disulfide-linked 180-kDa trimer, is a multifunctional protein that is produced by a variety of cells, including mesangial cells. In vitro andin vivo studies show that high glucose up-regulates TSP1 expression (13Schultz-Cherry S. Lawler J. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Biol.

Nephron. 1998; 79: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Recently, we and others showed that TSP1 is responsible for the activation of TGF-β in mesangial cells when exposed to high glucose for either short (2 days) or long term (3 weeks) treatment (18Poczatek M.H.

Nephrol. 2001; 12: 703-712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms involved in regulating TSP1 expression by high glucose concentrations are unclear. Nitric oxide has been implicated in the pathophysiology of diabetic nephropathy (20Craven P.A. DeRubertis F.R. Melhem M. Kidney Int. 1997; 52: 46-53Google Scholar, 21Pfeilschifter J.

In glomerular mesangial cells, decreased nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability is observed at high glucose concentrations. Several glucose-dependent mechanisms have been shown to modulate NO levels. These include impaired nitric oxide synthesis due to a decreased availability of l-arginine or tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), a cofactor of the nitric-oxide synthases (NOS) (23Trachtman H. Futterweit S. Crimmins D.L. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1997; 8: 1276-1282PubMed Google Scholar, 24Prabhakar S. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2001; 281: 179-188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, high glucose increases breakdown of NO through reactions with reactive oxygen species (26Honing M.L. Morrison P.J. Banga J.D. Stroes E.S. Rabelink T.J. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1998; 14: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 50Ishii N. Patel K.P. Lane P.H. Taylor T. Bian K. Murad F. Pollocl J.S. Carmines P.K. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2001; 12: 1630-1639PubMed Google Scholar). Accumulation of advanced glycation end products with chronic high glucose exposure is similarly associated with scavenging of NO (25Iglesias-De La Cruz M.C. Ruiz-Torres P. Alcami J. Diez-Marques L.

Morrison P.J. Banga J.D. Stroes E.S. Rabelink T.J. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1998; 14: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Decreased NO production has been shown to induce TSP1 expression in cultured endothelial cells (27Phelan M.W. Forman L.W. Perrine S.P. Faller D.V. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1998; 132: 519-529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Moreover, the promoter of TSP1 has both simian virus 40 promoter factor 1 (SP-1) and activator protein 1 (AP-1) sites, which are regulated by the cellular redox state (28Bogdan C. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 66-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). It is likely that NO plays an important role in glucose-dependent regulation of TSP1 expression, although this has not been tested. NO regulates cellular functions, in part through the activation of soluble guanylate cyclase and formation of cyclic GMP. Cyclic GMP binds to cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG), resulting in the activation of PKG and phosphorylation of intracellular proteins (29Lincoln T.M. Cornwell T.L. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 328-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Transfection of rat aortic smooth muscle cells with the catalytic domain of PKG-I inhibits TSP1 production (30Dey N.B. Boerth N.J. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Chang P.L. Prince C.W. Lincoln T.M. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Although glucose has been shown to decrease NO-mediated cGMP production in neuroblastoma cells (49Shindo H. Thomas T.P. Larkin D.D. Karlhaloo A.K. Inada H. Onaya T. Stevens M.J. Greene D.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 736-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), direct evidence for glucose regulation of PKG activity has been lacking. Based on these findings, we performed the present studies to determine the role of NO and PKG in glucose-mediated up-regulation of TSP1 and TSP1-dependent TGF-β activity. Data from our studies now show that high glucose significantly decreases NO production and intracellular cGMP levels. At high glucose concentrations, but not at 5 mm glucose, exogenous NO restores basal levels of TSP1 mRNA and protein and TGF-β bioactivity in rat mesangial cells. A decrease in endogenous NOS activity appears to play a role since basal levels of TSP1 and TGF-β activity can be restored by the NOS co-factor BH4. These effects of exogenous NO in the high glucose media are blocked by both an inhibitor of soluble guanylate cyclase and a selective inhibitor of PKG. These data provide the first evidence that NO-dependent PKG activity is involved in the regulation of TSP1 expression and TGF-β bioactivity in response to high glucose concentrations.

Insulin-transferrin-sodium selenite liquid media supplement, minimal essential medium nonessential amino acid solution, sodium pyruvate solution, and BH4 were purchased from Sigma. Monoclonal antibody 133 raised against human platelet TSP1 stripped of TGF-β activity was purified by our lab in a joint effort with the University of Alabama at Birmingham Hybridoma Core Facility (43Tolsma S.S.

Lincoln, Department of Pathology, University of Alabama at Birmingham. Secondary antibody was purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA). DetaNONOate was purchased from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). The decomposed compound of DetaNONOate was made by leaving the DetaNONOate in 0.1% NaOH at room temperature for at least 1 week, and complete decomposition assessed from the UV spectra. The cGMP analogue 8-pCPT-cGMP was purchased from Sigma. Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPS was purchased from Biolog. (La Jolla, CA). Luciferase assay reagent and passive lysis buffer were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI).

Rat mesangial cells (RMCs) were the generous gift from Dr. Anne Woods, University of Alabama at Birmingham. Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 20% heat-activated fetal bovine serum, 5 mmd-glucose, 2 mml-glutamine, 1% (v/v) nonessential amino acids, 2 mm sodium pyruvate, 10 μg/ml transferrin, 5 ng/ml sodium selenite, and 0.6 international units/ml insulin. RMCs were passaged at 80% confluency. Experiments in this study were performed on cells between the 5th and 10th passages. Mink lung epithelial cells (clone 32) stably transfected with the TGF-β response element of the human plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) gene promoter fused to firefly luciferase reporter gene were a generous gift from Dr. D. B. Rifkin (New York University Medical Center). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum, l-glutamine, and 200 μg/ml G418. NO release from NO donor was measured using an ISONO-PMC microchip electrode (WPI, Sarasota, FL) in a sealed 4-ml chamber that was magnetically stirred at 37 °C. DetaNONOate (5 μm) was added to the chamber, which contained RPMI media with either 5 or 30 mmglucose (without phenol red) to measure NO release in the media. NO measurements in the presence of cells were made by suspending rat mesangial cells (∼1.5 × 105/ml) in RPMI media containing either high (30 mm) or normal (5 mm) glucose. Data were collected by a digital recording device (Dataq, Akron OH) connected to a PC. The NO electrode was calibrated by the addition of known concentrations (measured spectrophotometrically) ofS-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine to the chamber to establish the [NO]:electrode current relationship. The rate of NO production over the initial 60 s of DetaNONOate decomposition and the concentration of NO released at steady state were determined for each system. Total nitrite and nitrate levels in RMC culture media were measured utilizing a fluorometric nitric oxide assay kit (Calbiochem). Briefly, nitrate reductase and enzyme co-factors were added to 20 μl of conditioned media. Samples were incubated for 2 h at room temperature and then incubated with 20 μl of 2,3-diaminonaphthalene for 10 min. Finally, 10 μl of NaOH was added to stop the reaction, and fluorescence was read using a CytoFluor plate reader (Perseptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) using the excitation wavelength of 365 nm and an emission wavelength of 450 nm. The mean values of fluorescence intensity (relative units) were converted into concentrations of total nitrite and nitrate (μm) according to the standard curve. RMCs were cultured in complete medium for 2–3 days to reach 85–90% confluency and were made quiescent for 2 days in serum-free medium. Isobutylmethylxanthine, a nonspecific cellular phosphodiesterase inhibitor, was used to prevent breakdown of cGMP during the exposure period. RMCs were incubated with 5 μm DetaNONOate in the presence of 0.1 mmisobutylmethylxanthine for the indicated time. After treatment, culture medium was aspirated, and cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. To extract cGMP, 200 μl of lysis buffer was added to the cells and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. cGMP production was determined by using a commercially available cGMP EIA kit (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). After the acetylation EIA procedure of the manual in the kit, briefly, rabbit anti-cGMP antibody was added to 96-well plate precoated with donkey anti-rabbit IgG. Acetylated standards or samples were added to the wells and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. cGMP-peroxidase conjugate was added and incubated for an additional 1 h at 4 °C. After washing, 3,3′,5′,5′-tetramethylbenzidine substrate was added to all wells and incubated for 30 min at room temperature, and absorbance was measured in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader at 450 nm. Values were expressed at pmol of cGMP/mg of protein according to the standard curve. Protein concentrations did not differ with glucose treatment (data not shown). RMCs were seeded in six-well plates at a density of 3 × 104 cells/ml. Cells were grown in the growth medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum for 2–3 days until cells reached 80% confluency and then rendered quiescent by culturing in serum and insulin-free RPMI media containing 5 mmol/liter glucose, 10 μg/ml transferrin, and 5 ng/ml sodium selenite for 48 h. Cells were treated for the next 24 h with serum-free media containing either 5 mmol/liter or 30 mmol/liter glucose in the presence or absence of reagents. When using PKG inhibitor (Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPS), cells were pretreated with the inhibitor for 20 min before the addition of other reagents. After 24 h of incubation, conditioned media were harvested and analyzed for thrombospondin 1 expression by immunoblotting. Cells were harvested in ice-cold PEM buffer (20 mmol/L sodium phosphate (pH 6.8), 2 mmol/L EDTA, 15 mmol/L β-mercaptoethanol, 0.15 mol/L NaCl, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin) (30Dey N.B. Boerth N.J. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Chang P.L. Prince C.W. Lincoln T.M. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), homogenized using a sonicator, and briefly centrifuged. The supernatants were analyzed for PKG expression by immunoblotting. Conditioned media or supernatants of cell lysate were harvested, and equal amounts of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE gel (8%) under reducing conditions. After electrophoretic transfer to nitrocellulose membranes and blocking, the membranes were incubated either with mouse monoclonal anti-TSP1 antibody 133 (1:5000) or anti-PKG I polyclonal antibody (1: 5000) for 2 h at room temperature. After intensive washing, secondary antibody (1:10,000 dilution) was used for the detection of immunoreactive bands with the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Pierce). Equal loading and transfer of protein samples were assayed by staining the blots with Ponceau S. Total and active TGF-β levels in the condition media were assayed using the PAI-1/luciferase assay. Briefly, Mink lung epithelial cells were plated into 24-well tissue culture plate at 1.6 × 105 cells/ml and incubated for 3–4 h for optimal attachment. After aspiration of the growth medium from the attached cells, 500 μl of condition media were added. To measure total TGF-β, conditioned media samples were heat-activated for 3 min at 100 °C. Samples and TGF-β standards were incubated overnight at 37 °C. After incubation, cells were lysed with lysis buffer at room temperature for 20 min. Lysates were analyzed for luciferase activity using a luminometer after the injection of 100 μl of substrate solution and recorded as relative light units. The mean values of triplicate samples were converted into concentrations of TGF-β (pm) using a standard curve obtained with human recombinant TGF-β1. Specificity of the assay was proven by either neutralization of the TGF-β activity in conditioned media with an anti-TGF-β antibody. Alternately, aliquots of the identical conditioned media used in the PAI-1/luciferase assay were assayed for active TGF-β using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for TGF-β1 (Quantikine, R&D System; data not shown) (54Batuman O.A. Go D. Clark L.T. Heart Dis. 2001; 3: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Quiescent cells were treated for 24 h with serum-free media containing either 5 or 30 mm glucose in the presence of increasing concentrations of DetaNONOate. After treatment, total RNA was extracted using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Equal amounts of total RNA (10 μg) were denatured, electrophoresed, and transferred to nylon membranes. RNA was fixed by UV-cross-linking. The TSP1 probe (1.1-kilobase fragment) was a gift from Dr. Jack Lawler (Harvard University) and was radiolabeled by Random Prime DNA-labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with [α-32P]dCTP. The membrane was prehybridized in ExpressHyb hybridization solution (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) for 30 min at 68 °C, and hybridization was carried out at 68 °C for 1 h in fresh hybridization solution with denatured probe. The membrane was washed three times with 2 × SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate), 0.05% SDS for 15 min at room temperature, and then twice with 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50 °C for 20 min. Blots were developed, and films were scanned. The absorbance units were corrected for the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase level. Human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA control probe (1.0 kilobases in length) was obtained from CLONTECH. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.D. Statistical evaluation of the data was performed using the unpaired t test, considering the p value of <0.05 as significant. To test the direct effect of high glucose on NO production, RMCs were cultured in RMPI medium (without phenol red and nitrite) with either 5 mm or 30 mm glucose for 24 h. The conditioned media were collected and analyzed for nitrate/nitrite levels (an index of accumulated NO produced by cells). As shown in Table I, 24-h NO production decreased a small but significant amount (∼10%) in 30 mm glucose media as compared with 5 mm glucose media (p < 0.05), which is consistent with previous observations (23Trachtman H. Futterweit S. Crimmins D.L. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1997; 8: 1276-1282PubMed Google Scholar).Table INitrate/nitrite and cGMP levels in cultured RMCsExperiment conditionsNitrate/nitritecGMP5 min24 h5 min24 hμmpmol/mg of proteinNormal glucose4.9 ± 0.177.75 ± 0.380.58 ± 0.11NDHigh glucose4.1 ± 0.071-ap < 0.05 vs.normal glucose.6.8 ± 0.401-ap < 0.05 vs.normal glucose.0.01 ± 01-ap < 0.05 vs.normal glucose.NDNormal glucose with Deta (5 μm)1.19 ± 0.867.23 ± 0.12High glucose with Deta (5 μm)1.28 ± 0.455.39 ± 0.241-bp < 0.05 vs.normal glucose with DetaNONOate.The results are the means ± S.D. of at least three independent experiments.

NO regulates cellular functions in part through the activation of soluble guanylate cyclase and the formation of cGMP (29Lincoln T.M. Cornwell T.L. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 328-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). To determine whether cGMP levels are decreased after acute exposure of the cells to 30 mm glucose, intracellular cGMP levels were measured in cells in which the media were changed to either 5 or 30 mmglucose. Although there was only a modest stimulation of endogenous NO after the media change, the cGMP level in media with 30 mmglucose is nonetheless only 2% that in 5 mm glucose media. To determine whether cells cultured under high glucose conditions still retain the capability of producing cGMP in response to NO, experiments with the NO donor DetaNONOate were performed. The capacity of soluble guanylate cyclase to generate cGMP was essentially equivalent in cells exposed to either 5 or 30 mm glucose (Table I). These data suggest that the NO-signaling pathway at the level of either NO production or bioavailability is decreased on acute exposure of mesangial cells to media containing high glucose. It has previously been shown that NO levels regulate TSP1 expression by endothelial cells (27Phelan M.W. Forman L.W. Perrine S.P. Faller D.V. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1998; 132: 519-529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Because glucose decreases bioavailable NO, it is possible the decreased NO after exposure to high glucose media is involved in regulation of TSP1. To determine whether NO is involved in up-regulation of TSP1 and TSP1-dependent TGF-β bioactivity by high glucose concentrations, RMCs were treated with increasing concentrations of the NO donor (DetaNONOate) for 24 h. The compound DetaNONOate was selected because of its low rate of release, its independence from metabolic activation for NO release, and its lack of reactive side products formed during decomposition (52Keefer L.K. Nims R.W. Davies K.M. Wink D.A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 268: 281-293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In cells cultured with 30 mm glucose, DetaNONOate down-regulates both TSP1 mRNA and protein levels in a concentration-dependent manner (Figs.1, A and B). Glucose up-regulates TSP1 mRNA ∼2.5-fold as compared with basal levels; both TSP1 mRNA and protein are reduced to basal levels, equivalent to those found in cells cultured in 5 mmglucose, when RMCs were treated with 2–5 μm DetaNONOate. In contrast, when RMCs were cultured in 5 mm glucose, TSP1 protein levels were decreased only slightly to 80–85% that of basal levels even at higher concentrations of the NO donor. The concentrations of DetaNONOate that were used in these experiments had no effect on cell number and were not toxic, as judged by 95% trypan blue exclusion after trypsinization of cells. We also observed the effect of this NO donor on TGF-β activity and protein levels by using the PAI-1/luciferase assay. Incubation of mesangial cells with increasing concentrations of DetaNONOate markedly reduced the stimulatory effect of 30 mm glucose on TGF-β activity to the level of TGF-β activity observed in mesangial cells cultured with 5 mm glucose (Fig. 1 C). Results from the PAI-1/luciferase assay were confirmed using a receptor-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to measure TGF-β activity (data not shown). Levels of total TGF-β were not significantly affected by DetaNONOate treatment (Fig. 1 D). The decomposed compound of DetaNONOate had no effect either on TSP1 expression or active or total TGF-β production in cells cultured with either 5 or 30 mmglucose (data not shown). One possible explanation for the inhibitory effect of NO on TSP1 expression and TGF-β activity in response to high glucose exposure might be that the culture conditions modify the exposure of the cells to the exogenous NO. To test for this possibility, the release of NO by DetaNONOate was measured in both 5 and 30 mm glucose containing media polarographically. The results show that over a wide range of DetaNONOate concentrations (5–50 μm), there was no difference between the rate of NO release or steady state NO concentration in the cell-free media at either glucose concentration. Data for the 5 μm concentration of DetaNONOate are shown in Table II. This suggests that NO scavenging or modification of the decomposition rate of the NO donor by glucose is not responsible for the altered responses (33Brodsky S.V. Morrishow A.M. Dharia N. Gross S.S. Goligorsky M.S. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2001; 280: 480-486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the release of NO by 5 μm DetaNONOate when added in the presence of cells differed between the 5 and 30 mm glucose conditions (Table II). The NO concentration is decreased (p < 0.05) in mesangial cell media conditioned with 30 mm glucose as compared with the NO levels in media conditioned by the cells under basal glucose conditions (5 mm). Together these data suggest that cellular factors are important in regulation of NO levels by glucose.

To understand how the FOXC1 protein may function in contributing to these malformations, we identified functional regions in FOXC1 required for nuclear localization and transcriptional regulation. Two regions in the FOXC1 forkhead domain, one rich in basic amino acid residues, and a second, highly conserved among all FOX proteins, were necessary for nuclear localization of the FOXC1 protein. However, only the basic region was sufficient for nuclear localization. Two transcriptional activation domains were identified in the extreme N- and C-terminal regions of FOXC1. A transcription inhibitory domain was located at the central region of the protein. This region was able to reduce thetrans-activation potential of the C-terminal activation domain, as well as the GAL4 activation domain. Lastly, we demonstrate that FOXC1 is a phosphoprotein, and a number of residues predicted to be phosphorylated were localized to the FOXC1 inhibitory domain. Removal of residues 215–366 resulted in a transcriptionally hyperactive FOXC1 protein, which displayed a reduced level of phosphorylation. These results indicate that FOXC1 is under complex regulatory control with multiple functional domains modulating FOXC1 transcriptional regulation.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 142-146PubMed Google Scholar)) proteins are a family of transcription factors that contain an evolutionarily conserved 110-amino acid DNA-binding domain known as theforkhead domain (FHD).1 This DNA-binding domain was first identified as a region of homology between theDrosophila fork head protein (2Weigel D.

The FHD is composed of a variant of the helix-turn-helix motif, known as the winged-helix motif (4Clark K.L. Halay E.D. Lai E. Burley S.K. Nature. 1993; 364: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar). Members of this family of transcription factors play key roles in development, including morphogenesis and cell fate specification (5Kaufmann E. Knochel W. Mech.

FOXC2 mutations are responsible for Hereditary Lymphedema-Distichiasis Syndrome (6Fang J. Dagenais S.L. Erickson R.P. Arlt M.F. Glynn M.W. Gorski J.L. Seaver L.H. Glover T.W. Am. J. Hum.

In addition to its role in ocular development, FOXC1 is believed to be essential in the formation of mesoderm tissues. Foxc1 is responsible for the congenital hydrocephalus mutation in mice, which results in perinatal death with defects in the eye and skeletal system (14Kume T. Deng K.Y. Winfrey V. Gould D.B. Walter M.A. Hogan B.L. Cell. 1998; 93: 985-996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Moreover, targeted deletions of Foxc1 in mice have demonstrated a crucial role for this protein in the formation of the kidney, eye, heart, bone, and cartilage (15Winnier G.E. Hargett L. Hogan B.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 926-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 16Kidson S.H. Kume T. Deng K. Winfrey V. Hogan B.L. Dev.

Furthermore, AR patients with FOXC1 mutations present with systematic findings, including dental dysgenesis and, in rare cases, cardiac defects (12Mirzayans F. Gould D.B. Heon E. Billingsley G.D. Cheung J.C. Mears A.J. Walter M.A. Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 8: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 18Swiderski R.E. Reiter R.S. Nishimura D.Y. Alward W.L. Kalenak J.W. Searby C.S. Stone E.M. Sheffield V.C. Lin J.J. Dev. Dyn. 1999; 216: 16-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These data suggest that FOXC1 is essential for the formation of mesoderm-derived tissues in vertebrates. Our laboratory has previously determined that the disease-causing missense mutations in the FOXC1 FHD result in impaired DNA binding and reduced trans-activation of target genes (19Saleem R.A. Banerjee-Basu S. Berry F.B. Baxevanis A.D. Walter M.A. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 68: 627-641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Little is known about FOXC1 functional domains outside of the forkhead box. To gain insight on how FOXC1 may contribute to the AR malformations and formation of mesoderm-derived structures, we sought to determine which regions of the protein are functionally important for nuclear localization and transcriptional activation. We find that FOXC1 is under complex regulatory control as multiple domains are required for the correct targeting of FOXC1 to the nucleus and for efficient activation of a FOXC1 transcriptional reporter gene. The FOXC1 expression vector pcDNA4-FOXC1has been reported previously (19Saleem R.A. Banerjee-Basu S. Berry F.B. Baxevanis A.D. Walter M.A. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 68: 627-641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Deletions in the FHD were created by sitedirected mutagenesis using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) as described by the manufacturer. Mutatgenic primers were designed to “loop out” the desired nucleotides from the FOXC1 plasmid. The introduction of the correct mutation was confirmed by sequencing, and the mutated region was subcloned back into pcDNA4-FOXC1. The mutagenic primers are listed as follows: Δ69–178: forward 5′-cgcgcctacgggccctacacggcggtgaaggacaaggaggag-3′, reverse 5′-ctcctccttgtccttcaccgcgtagggcccgtaggcgcg-3′; Δ78–93: forward 5′-ccgcagcccaaggacatggtggccccggacaagaagatgacc-3′, reverse 5′-ggtgatcttcttgtccggggcgaccatgtccttgggctgcgg-3′; Δ168–176: forward 5′-catgttcgagaacggcagcttcgacgcggtgaaggacaaggagg-3′, reverse 5′-cctccttgtccttcaccgcgtcgaagctgccgttctcgaacatg-3′. The FOXC1 cDNA was subcloned into the vector pEGFP (CLONTECH) to create GFP-FOXC1. Oligonucleotides corresponding to the coding sequence of the regions of the FOXC1 FHD were synthesized, annealed, and ligated into pEGFP. FOXC1 N- and C-terminal deletions were created by restriction digestion of pcDNA4-FOXC1. To create FOXC1 C-terminal deletions 1–475, 1–435, 1–366, and 1–215, the 3′-end of the pcDNA4-FOXC1 vector was digested with either KpnI, BstXI,PstI, or Rsr II, respectively, end-filled with Klenow or T4 polymerase, and re-ligated into a blunt-ended XbaI site. FOXC1-(21–281) was created by subcloning an FspI fragment of FOXC1 into the EcoRV site of pcDNA4C. FOXC1 digested with ApaI and XbaI was subcloned back into identical sites of FOXC1-(29–281) to create FOXC1-(29–553). FOXC1-(51–221) and FOXC1-(51–553) were created by a similar strategy with a NotI fragment of FOXC1. Δ215–366 was created by digesting pcDNA4-FOXC1 with RsrII and PstI to remove the intervening sequence, end-filled with Klenow and T4 polymerase, respectively, and religated. The GAL4 DNA-binding domain vector, pM1 (CLONTECH), was modified by PCR to create the vector pM1-B with a multiple cloning site in-frame with theFOXC1 cDNA. GAL4+FOXC1 fusions were constructed by restriction digestion of corresponding fragments of theFOXC1 cDNA and subcloning into pM1 or pM1-B vectors. Insertion of FOXC1 cDNAs into the correct reading frame was verified by sequencing. HeLa and COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. FOXC1 immunofluorescence was performed as described previously (19Saleem R.A. Banerjee-Basu S. Berry F.B. Baxevanis A.D. Walter M.A. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 68: 627-641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). For GFP fluorescence, HeLa cells were grown on coverslips and transfected with GFP vectors. Twenty-four hours following transfection, the coverslips were mounted onto microscope slides. FOXC1 trans-activation assays were performed as described previously (19Saleem R.A. Banerjee-Basu S. Berry F.B. Baxevanis A.D. Walter M.A. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 68: 627-641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). For GAL4trans-activation studies, COS-7 cells were plated at a density of 1 × 105 cells/ml into six-well tissue culture plates 24 h prior to transfection. Five hundred nanograms of each GAL4+FOXC1 vector along with 50 ng of pG5-Luc (Promega) and 1 ng of pRL-CMV (Promega) were transfected into each plate using FuGene6 transfection reagent. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were harvested and analyzed for luciferase activity per the manufacturer's directions (Promega). Each transfection was performed in duplicate and replicated at least three times. COS cell extracts transfected with 5 μg of FOXC1 expression vectors or HeLa cells extracts transfected with 2 μg of FOXC1 expression vectors were resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Proteins were detected by immunoblotting with an anti-Xpress antibody (Invitrogen) at a concentration of 0.2 μg/ml and visualized with SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce). The nuclear localization signals (NLSs) for FOX family members FOXA2 and FOXF2 are found in the FHDs (20Qian X. Costa R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1184-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 21Hellqvist M. Mahlapuu M. Samuelsson L. Enerback S. Carlsson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4482-4490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To test whether such information resides in the FOXC1 FHD, mutations were created in the FOXC1 protein that either deleted the entire FHD or regions at the N- and C-terminal boundaries of the FHD. The cellular localization of these proteins was visualized by indirect immunofluorescence against vector-encoded Xpress epitope. The full-length FOXC1 protein was localized exclusively to the nucleus, whereas FOXC1 Δ69–178, which lacks the entire FHD, displayed an increased cytoplasmic localization (Fig. 1), indicating that the FHD contains information necessary for nuclear localization of FOXC1. Analysis of the amino acid sequence of the FOXC1 FHD revealed a span of basic amino acids at positions 168–176 that may serve as a potential NLS. Deletion of these amino acids from FOXC1 (Δ168–176) resulted in localization to both the cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig. 1). Deletion of residues 78–93 displayed a mixture of cytoplasmic and nuclear localization, whereas FOXC1 Δ78–93+Δ168–176 resulted in a predominately mixed cytoplasmic and nuclear localization similar to that observed when the entire FHD was removed. Therefore, two regions in the FHD are required for correct FOXC1 nuclear localization. The two putative FOXC1 NLS domains were fused to green fluorescence protein (GFP) to determine if these signals were sufficient for nuclear localization. FOXC1 fused to GFP resulted in a localization of the GFP signal to the nuclei of HeLa (Fig.2 B). Expression of GFP+77–93 produced a signal that was localized to both the cytoplasm and the nucleus of HeLa cells (Fig. 2 C) indicating that this portion of FOXC1 is not sufficient for nuclear localization and therefore does not contain the FOXC1 NLS. Expression of GFP+168–176, on the other hand, led to the accumulation of GFP exclusively in the nucleus (Fig.2 D). Moreover, the GFP signal produced by this chimeric protein was enriched in a subnuclear domain resembling that of the nucleolus (Fig. 2 D). These data indicate that only residues 168–176 was sufficient to localize GFP to the nucleus and may constitute the FOXC1 NLS domain. To identify transcription activation domains in the FOXC1 protein, a series of N and C-terminal deletions flanking the FHD were created and tested for the ability to activate expression. At present, there are no known transcriptional targets of FOXC1, therefore a luciferase reporter that contains six FOXC1 binding sites (19Saleem R.A. Banerjee-Basu S. Berry F.B. Baxevanis A.D. Walter M.A. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 68: 627-641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) was used to monitor transcriptional activation. Transfection of HeLa cells with the full-length FOXC1-(1–553) cDNA resulted in an approximate 10-fold induction of luciferase activity compared with the empty expression vector alone (Fig.3 A). When N-terminal amino acids 1–29 or 1–51 were deleted from FOXC1, activation of the luciferase reporter was reduced by 50 and 55%, respectively, indicating that residues in the N terminus are required for full activation. In addition, removal of C-terminal residues also impaired activation as FOXC1-(1–435) reduced the luciferase reporter by 58%. These results indicate that FOXC1 contains segments from amino acids 1–51 in the N terminus, and from 435–553 in the C-terminal domain that are both required for efficient activation of the FOXC1 reporter. Expression of a FOXC1 protein that lacks both N- and C-terminal regions (FOXC1-(51–221)) was incapable of activating luciferase expression above levels observed with the empty expression vector. Interestingly, FOXC1-(1–366) activated luciferase expression to levels nearly equivalent to full-length FOXC1, while FOXC1-(1–215) activated luciferase to levels exceeding those observed for full-length FOXC1 (Fig. 3 A). These results suggest that further deletion of the C terminus removed an inhibitory domain located between residues 215 and 365 that led to an enhanced activation of the luciferase reporter by the N-terminal trans-activation domain. We verified that all FOXC1 deletion constructs used intrans-activation assays were capable of producing the correct protein at near equivalent amounts (Fig. 3 B). In addition each FOXC1 deletion was capable of binding to the FOXC1 binding site by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (data not shown) indicating that the loss of transcriptional activation observed was the result of removing activator domains and not from the production of a protein incapable of binding DNA. These data are not surprising, because all FOXC1 deletions retain an intact FHD and previous reports indicate that expression of the FHD alone is sufficient to bind DNA in a sequence-specific manner (22Pierrou S. Hellqvist M. Samuelsson L. Enerback S. Carlsson P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5002-5012Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). The FOXC1 N- and C-terminal activation domains were fused in-frame to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (DB), and their ability to activate transcription was tested. Full-length FOXC1 fused to the GAL4 DB activated the GAL4 luciferase reporter by 10-fold compared with the GAL DB alone (Fig. 4). Expression of N-terminal FOXC1 residues 1–30 and 1–65 were capable of activating luciferase expression to levels equivalent to full-length FOXC1, suggesting that the N-terminal regions are sufficient to activate transcription. GAL4+435–553 was over 10 times more active than full-length FOXC1 and 100-fold more active than base-line luciferase activity indicating that the principal C-terminal activation domain lies in these residues. The activation mediated by GAL4+366–553 and GAL4+215–553 was considerably lower than that of GAL4+435–553 indicating that residues between 215 and 434 may constrain the activation domain present in residues 435–553. Extracts of COS-7 cells transfected with the FOXC1 cDNA were analyzed for protein expression. FOXC1 migrated as multiple immunoreactive bands on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Fig.5 A). The presence of the higher molecular weight proteins was reduced when extracts were incubated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIP), indicating that the multiple FOXC1 bands were a result of phosphorylation. Inhibition of CIP activity by sodium vanadate (VO3) and EDTA, retained the higher mobility FOXC1 bands. To determine if the phosphorylation of FOXC1 led to a protein conformation change, we performed a limited trypsin digest of FOXC1. The addition of CIP rendered FOXC1 more sensitive to the trypsin digestion than untreated FOXC1 or FOXC1 treated with CIP and VO3 as indicated by the disappearance of the full-length FOXC1 band and the appearance of smaller tryptic fragments (Fig. 5 B). These data suggest that dephosphorylation of FOXC1 increased accessibility for trypsin. The phosphorylated regions of FOXC1 were mapped by Western analysis of the FOXC1 deletion constructs described in Fig. 3. FOXC1 residues 1–215 produced only a single immunoreactive band, whereas FOXC1-(1–366) was detected as multiple FOXC1 bands (Fig.5 C). The migration of these additional bands was reduced by incubation with CIP. Additional FOXC1 immunoreactive bands were also observed for FOXC1-(1–466) and -(1–475) (data not shown). Based on these expression patterns we conclude that the phosphorylation of FOXC1 resulting in altered migration occurs between residues 215 and 366. When these residues were removed (FOXC1(Δ215–366)), the protein migrated as a single immunoreactive band, insensitive to CIP treatment (Fig. 5 C). In addition, FOXC1(Δ215–366) activated the FOXC1 reporter ∼2-fold higher than full-length FOXC1 (Fig.5 D). Amino acids 215–366 of FOXC1 contain phosphorylated residues and may serve to negatively modulate transcriptional activation by FOXC1. We next investigated whether residues 215–366 contained repressor activity and could impair other trans-activation domains. When residues 215–366 fused to GAL4 DB were transfected with a GAL4-luciferase reporter under the control of the constitutively active SV40 promoter, luciferase levels were equivalent to levels observed with the GAL4 DB alone (Fig. 5 E). The GAL4 activator domain (AD) fused to the GAL4 DB led to a robust activation of the GAL4-SV40-luc reporter. However, when GAL4+215–366 was fused to GAL4 AD, luciferase levels were markedly reduced (Fig. 5 E). Therefore, FOXC1-(215–366) does not contain intrinsic transcriptional repressor activity, rather these residues may serve to inhibit the ability of activation domains to stimulate transcription. In this report we describe the molecular dissection of FOXC1 to identify important functional regions required for nuclear localization and regulation of transcription. Two regions in the FOXC1 FHD were required for correct localization of FOXC1 into the nucleus (Fig.6). Previous studies had identified that regions at the N- and C-terminal boundary of the FHD were critical for proper nuclear localization FOXA2 and FOXF2 (20Qian X. Costa R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1184-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 24Hellqvist M. Mahlapuu M. Blixt A. Enerback S. Carlsson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23335-23343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The first region required for FOXC1 nuclear localization spans from residues 77 to 93 in the FHD and the removal of these residues prevented the nuclear accumulation of FOXC1. This domain was not sufficient for nuclear localization, because its attachment to GFP led to a mixed cytoplasmic and nuclear accumulation of the fusion protein (Fig. 2 C). The amino acid sequence present in this region does not match any typical NLS motif, however, these residues are some of the most highly conserved residues found in all FHDs (5Kaufmann E. Knochel W. Mech. Dev. 1996; 57: 3-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Thus this region is likely not an NLS but rather may serve as a NLS accessory domain, because it was necessary for proper nuclear localization of FOXC1. The second region contains a basic stretch of amino acids at position169RRRRRFKK176 at the C-terminal end of the FHD that is similar to NLSs found in a number of HOX proteins (23Cokol M. Nair R. Rost B. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Like FOXC1, the C-terminal NLS in FOXA2 and FOXF2 is also rich in basic amino acid residues (20Qian X. Costa R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1184-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 24Hellqvist M. Mahlapuu M. Blixt A. Enerback S. Carlsson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23335-23343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The basic region was necessary for FOXC1 nuclear localization and was sufficient to localize GFP to the nucleus. Although it was thought that both regions constituted a FOX NLS, our data suggests that only the C-terminal region of the FHD, rich in basic residues, represents a bona fide NLS. FOXC1 contains N- and C-terminal transcription activation domains at positions 1–51 and 466–553, respectively (Fig. 6). Both regions are required for full activation of a FOXC1-responsive reporter, and each region was individually capable of activating transcription when coupled to the GAL4-DB. These activation domains may not be entirely redundant. The C-terminal activation (AD-2) domain may serve as a general transcriptional activator capable of activating transcription from a number of promoters, because its fusion to the GAL4-DB created a potent activator that was more active then full-length FOXC1 fused to GAL4-DB. The N-terminal activation domain (AD-1) was more active in the context of FOXC1 than in GAL4 and therefore may be responsible for activation of FOXC1-specific target genes. AD-1 does not contain any motifs that are typically found in trans-activation domains (Fig. 6). It is not extensively rich in proline, glutamine, or acidic residues (25Tjian R. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 77: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). This region does contain a poly-Ala repeat, and although these repeats are commonly found in repression domains (26Han K. Manley J.L. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2723-2733Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), this element has been identified in the activation domains of other transcription factors (27Shim Y.S. Jang Y.K. Lim M.S. Lee J.S. Seong R.H. Hong S.H. Park S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8958-8968Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). AD-2 contains a number of glutamine residues intermixed with bulky hydrophobic residues that are important for activation of transcription (25Tjian R. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 77: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar, 28Gill G. Pascal E. Tseng Z. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In this study we relied upon a synthetic FOXC1 reporter to map transcriptional regulatory domains. We are attempting to identify targets of FOXC1 trans-activation, and analysis of transcriptional regulatory domains will be monitored under more natural conditions. Transcription activation domains have been identified for other members of the FOX family of proteins. Like FOXC1, both N-and C-terminal activation domains were required for full transcriptional activation by FOXA2 (20Qian X. Costa R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1184-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 29Pani L. Overdier D.G. Porcella A. Qian X. Lai E. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3723-3732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A single lung-specific C-terminal activation domain was identified in FOXF1, whereas two C-terminal activation domains were identified in FOXF2. Despite the high conservation of amino acid sequences in the FHD, there is little amino acid similarity in the activation domains between FOXC1 and other FOX proteins. However, the amino acid sequences of AD-1 and AD-2 are highly conserved among vertebrate FOXC1 homologues (Fig. 6), and this conservation suggest that these residues are critical for FOXC1 function. Furthermore, a frameshift mutation in the C-terminal region of FOXC1 has been identified in an AR patient (13Nishimura D.Y. Searby C.C. Alward W.L. Walton D. Craig J.E. Mackey D.A. Kawase K. Kanis A.B. Patil S.R. Stone E.M. Sheffield V.C. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 68: 364-372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). This mutation is predicted to delete the last 49 amino acids of FOXC1 and this protein would therefore lack key residues in the trans-activation domain. Because we have previously shown that FOXC1 point mutations that underlie the AR malformations result in reduced DNA binding and transcriptional activation of FOXC1 targets (19Saleem R.A. Banerjee-Basu S. Berry F.B. Baxevanis A.D. Walter M.A. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 68: 627-641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), this deletion of residues in the C-terminal activation domain may reduce FOXC1trans-activation and produce a similar disease phenotype. In addition to the identification of the FOXC1 activator domains, we provide evidence that FOXC1 possesses a transcriptional inhibitory domain located at amino acids 215–366 (Fig. 6). We propose that this region is an inhibitory domain for several reasons. First, removal of this region results in enhanced trans-activation by FOXC1. Second, transcriptional activation by FOXC1 AD-2 was higher than full-length FOXC1 when coupled to GAL4-DB, suggesting the presence of an inhibitory region in the full-length protein. Third, GAL4+AD2 fusions that contained these residues (GAL4+215–553) were less active than GAL4+AD2 proteins that did not contain this region (GAL4+366–553). Fourth, addition of residues 215–366 to the GAL4 AD impaired transcriptional activation. Together these observations suggest that residues 215–366 can reduce the activity of transcriptional activation domains. We refer to this region as an inhibitory domain (ID). This region may serve to modulate FOXC1 transcriptional activity. Although the FOXC1 ID contains a proline-rich segment similar to the WT-1 repressor protein (30Madden S.L. Cook D.M. Rauscher 3rd., F.J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1713-1720PubMed Google Scholar), it was unable to repress transcription from the constitutively active SV40 promoter, suggesting the ID requires the presence of an AD to exert its negative effects. Like AD-1 and AD-2, the ID is conserved among vertebrate FOXC1 proteins (Fig. 6). A functionally similar ID domain exists in the osteoblast-specific transcription factor Osf2 (31Thirunavukkarasu K. Mahajan M. McLarren K.W. Stifani S. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4197-4208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 154 C-terminal residues of this protein inhibited an adjacent activation domain. Furthermore, like the FOXC1 ID, this inhibitory potential was transferable, because the Osf2 repressor domain was able to block transcription when fused to the transcriptional activator VP16 (31Thirunavukkarasu K. Mahajan M. McLarren K.W. Stifani S. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4197-4208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We provide evidence that FOXC1 is a phosphoprotein and that the activity of the inhibitory domain may be regulated by phosphorylation. An in silico prediction of the potential residues phosphorylated in FOXC1 has revealed that 20 out of the 33 serine residues predicted to be phosphorylated lie in the FOXC1 ID (32Blom N. Gammeltoft S. Brunak S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1351-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (2536) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of FOXC1 may limit the accessibility of accessory proteins necessary for full transcriptional activation. The FHD of FOXF2 interacts with TBP and TFIIB (24Hellqvist M. Mahlapuu M. Blixt A. Enerback S. Carlsson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23335-23343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This interacting region is conserved between FOXC1 and FOXF2 and suggests that a similar interaction may also occur between FOXC1 and TBP or TFIIB. The FOXC1 ID may recruit proteins that interfere with TBP and TFIIB binding to the nearby FHD. We are currently investigating the protein-protein interactions occurring with FOXC1 and if such interactions are regulated through phosphorylation. Whether the enhanced activation observed by the removal of the FOXC1 inhibitory domain is related to the removal of phosphorylated residues in this region remains speculative at present. However, our observations predict that phosphorylation of this region may lead to an inhibition of FOXC1 function though the inhibitory domain. Negative regulation of FOX protein function by AKT phosphorylation has been observed for FOXO3 proteins (33Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5454) Google Scholar). Regulation of FOXC1 by phosphorylation likely involves a different mechanism, because FOXC1 does not contain residues matching the AKT consensus site. Predicted protein kinases that may phosphorylate FOXC1 include casein kinases I and II, glycogen synthase kinase 3, protein kinase A, and protein kinase C. Phosphorylation of transcription factors by these kinases can influence their transcriptional regulatory activity (34Ross S.E. Erickson R.L. Hemati N. MacDougald O.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8433-8441Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Klenova E.M. Chernukhin I.V. El-Kady A. Lee R.E. Pugacheva E.M. Loukinov D.I. Goodwin G.H. Delgado D. Filippova G.N. Leon J. Morse III, H.C. Neiman P.E. Lobanenkov V.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2221-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). FOXC1 phosphorylation may occur at more than one residue based on the number of immunoreactive FOXC1 bands observed and the number of residues predicted to be phosphorylated (Fig. 6), which may prove problematic in the determination of the residues phosphorylated in FOXC1. We have identified regions in the FOXC1 protein critical for its function as a transcription factor. The presence of FOXC1 ADs along with an ID suggests that FOXC1 activity is under complex regulatory control with these multiple domains coordinating efficient transcriptional activation. Disease-causing point mutations inFOXC1 ultimately result in reducedtrans-activation by FOXC1 (19Saleem R.A. Banerjee-Basu S. Berry F.B. Baxevanis A.D. Walter M.A. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 68: 627-641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Chromosomal duplications involving FOXC1 were found in patients with ocular anomalies (13Nishimura D.Y. Searby C.C. Alward W.L. Walton D. Craig J.E. Mackey D.A. Kawase K. Kanis A.B. Patil S.R. Stone E.M. Sheffield V.C. Am. J. Hum.

Genet. 2000; 67: 1129-1135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), suggesting that elevated levels or enhanced activity of FOXC1 may also be detrimental. Thus the precise control of FOXC1 activity is paramount for its proper function and the prevention of a disease phenotype. The identification of FOXC1 functional domains is an essential step in understanding how FOXC1 mutations may contribute to ocular diseases. We thank M. Hughes for tissue culture services and Dr. A.

Upon heterologous expression of the OSMR in several cell lines, we observed that its surface expression was significantly enhanced by coexpression of the Janus kinases Jak1, Jak2, and Tyk2 but not Jak3. Chimeric receptors consisting of the extracellular region of the interleukin-5 receptor β chain and the transmembrane and intracellular part of the OSMR were similarly up-regulated on the plasma membrane when Jak1 was coexpressed. The overall expression level of these constructs did not change significantly, but Jak1 coexpression increased the amount of endoglycosidase H-resistant, fully processed OSMR chimeras. Using mutated receptor and Jak1 constructs, we were able to demonstrate that association of Jak1 with the membrane proximal region of the receptor, but not its kinase activity, is necessary for this effect. Moreover, deletion of the OSMR box1/2 region also resulted in an improved surface expression indicating that this region may contain a signal preventing efficient receptor surface expression in the absence of associated Jaks.

Its closest relatives are the receptor for leukemia inhibitory factor and the glycoprotein (gp) 130, which represents the common signal transducing receptor chain of all IL-6-type cytokines (1.De Mosley B.

This family consists of seven members: IL-6, IL-11, leukemia inhibitory factor, oncostatin M (OSM), ciliary neurotrophic factor, cardiotrophin-1, and the novel neurotrophin-1/B-cell stimulatory factor-3/cardiotrophin-like cytokine (2.Elson G.C.

Like the other IL-6-type cytokines, OSM is involved in various systemic and local responses, such as regulation of the acute phase reaction, hematopoiesis, bone remodeling, and homeostasis of the extracellular matrix, and can act as a mediator for both the proliferation and the growth arrest of various cell lines (3.Heinrich P.C.

In contrast to all other members of this family, which transduce their signals either via a gp130 homodimer or a gp130/leukemia inhibitory factor receptor heterodimer, OSM has the unique property to signal via a receptor complex comprising gp130 and the OSMR (1.De Mosley B.

These cytoplasmic kinases contain a kinase and a kinase-like domain in their C-terminal region, whereas their N-terminal region mediates constitutive association with cytokine receptors (8.Pellegrini S. Dusanter-Fourt I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 615-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). On the basis of sequence similarities, it has been proposed that this region contains a FERM domain (as present infour-point-one, ezrin, radixin, and moesin). A recent mutagenesis study based on a molecular model has highlighted the importance of the N-terminal subdomain F1 with a β-grasp fold for the interaction with gp130 (9.Haan C. Is'harc H.

Within the cytokine receptors, the membrane proximal box1/box2 region has been demonstrated to be required for Jak binding. This region is characterized by a proline-rich motif (box1) and a less conserved region dominated by a hydrophobic stretch of amino acids followed by several charged amino acids (box2) (3.Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Müller-Newen G. Schaper F. Graeve L. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 297-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar). Although activation of the Janus kinases Jak1, Jak2, and Tyk2 has been reported for IL-6-type cytokines (3.Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Müller-Newen G. Schaper F. Graeve L. Biochem.

Upon ligand binding and receptor dimerization, Jaks are activated and in turn phosphorylate several cytoplasmic tyrosine residues in the gp130·OSMR complex that then provide docking sites for SH2 domain-containing molecules, such as the transcription factors STAT3 and -1, the negative feedback inhibitor suppressor of cytokine signaling 3, and the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 or the adaptor protein Shc, which may each contribute to activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (3.Heinrich P.C.

It has therefore been widely accepted that Jaks play an important role in cytokine signaling, and only cytokine receptors that are able to bind Jaks are signaling-competent (3.Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Müller-Newen G. Schaper F. Graeve L. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 297-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar). However, not much is known about how functional receptor·Jak complexes are generated. Interestingly studies carried out with the erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) demonstrated that Jak2/EPOR association takes place very early in biosynthesis, namely in the ER (17.Cohen J. Altaratz H. Zick Y. Klingmuller U. Neumann D. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 391-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In this article we demonstrate that the expression of Jak1 promotes the surface expression of the OSMR. This effect is mediated by association of Jak1 with the receptor, whereas Jak1 kinase activity is not required. We further show that the OSMR contains a signal within its box1/2 region that prevents efficient surface expression and that may be masked upon Jak binding to the OSMR. We propose that such a mechanism serves as a quality control, ensuring that only functional receptor·kinase complexes are expressed at the cell membrane. COS-7 simian monkey kidney cells, 3T3 murine fibroblasts, HeLa human cervix carcinoma cells, and human 2fTGH, U4A, 2C4, and U4C fibrosarcoma cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal-calf serum, 100 mg/liter streptomycin, and 60 mg/liter penicillin.

The C-terminal deletion mutants β/OSMR-box1 and β/OSMRΔcyt were generated by PCR using antisense oligonucleotides incorporating an in-frame termination codon followed by the recognition site for BamHI.

Cells were washed with cold PBS/azide and subsequently incubated in darkness with a 1:50 dilution of an R-phycoerythrin-conjugated α-mouse antibody for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed again and resuspended in PBS/azide. 104cells/sample were analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACScalibur (Becton Dickinson) equipped with a 488 nm argon laser.

Receptors were immunoprecipitated from cleared lysates using α-IL-5Rβ (S-16) antibody. The immune complexes were collected on protein A-Sepharose and washed twice with washing buffer (lysis buffer with only 0.1% Brij97). For Endo H digestions, the immunoprecipitates were washed once in 200 mm sodium citrate (pH 5.5) and incubated in 100 μl of citrate buffer for 18–24 h with or without 5 milliunits of Endo H. Subsequently the Sepharose was boiled for 5 min in Laemmli buffer at 95 °C. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE in 7.5% gels (lysates and coimmunoprecipitates) or 10% gels (Endo H analysis) followed by electroblotting onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PALL, Dreieich, Germany). Western blot analysis was conducted using the indicated antibodies and the enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Before reprobing, blots were stripped in 2% SDS, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.7) for 20 min at 75 °C. Transiently transfected cells growing on coverslips were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and treated for 5 min with 50 mm NH4Cl.

After washing the cells three times with PBS++, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, cells were labeled with secondary antibody diluted 1:200 in PBS++, 0.2% bovine serum albumin. Cells were washed again, mounted in Moviol, and analyzed on the next day with a Zeiss confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM 510). For staining of intracellular receptors, cells were permeabilized using solutions additionally containing 0.1% Triton X-100. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with expression plasmids for the OSMR and either the Janus kinase Jak1 or the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase Tec as a control. When we monitored the cellular localization of the OSMR by immunofluorescence studies, we became aware of a novel function of Jak1. While COS-7 cells expressing the OSMR and Tec kinase generally displayed a moderate surface staining of the OSMR (Fig. 1A, first panel), coexpression of OSMR and Jak1 resulted in an increased number of cells with a bright surface staining (Fig. 1A, third panel). However, in both cases, a large portion of the OSMR was located intracellularly (Fig. 1A, second and fourth panels). By flow cytometry, we were able to verify the immunofluorescence data. A much higher number of cells coexpressing Jak1 display a strong OSMR surface staining compared with cells coexpressing Tec (Fig. 1B, compare upper and lower histogram). Furthermore, the mean fluorescence of transfected cells, which was calculated by histogram subtraction, was strongly increased in Jak1-coexpressing compared with Tec-coexpressing cells (Fig. 1B, right panel). To exclude that coexpression of Tec kinase might have a negative effect on OSMR expression, we also transfected the empty vector or an expression vector for STAT1 as controls. In both cases, similar results were obtained (data not shown). Furthermore, the up-regulation of OSMR surface expression by coexpression of Jak1 was not restricted to COS-7 cells as we observed the same effect in transfected human HeLa cervix carcinoma and murine 3T3 fibroblast cells (Fig. 1C). The Jak-mediated up-regulation of OSMR surface expression could be due to an increased overall expression of heterologously expressed OSMR. Therefore, it was important to monitor whether Jak overexpression results in an altered expression level of the OSMR. Since antibodies recognizing the OSMR in Western blot analysis are currently not available, we took advantage of receptor chimeras consisting of the extracellular region of the IL-5Rβ fused to the OSMR transmembrane and intracellular region (Fig. 2A). These are readily detectable in Western blot analysis and flow cytometry as shown previously (15.Hermanns H.M. Radtke S. Schaper F. Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40742-40748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 18.Hermanns H.M. Radtke S. Haan C. Schmitz-Van de Leur H. Tavernier J. Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6651-6658PubMed Google Scholar). We first tested whether the results obtained with the OSMR could be confirmed with the IL-5Rβ/OSMR constructs. When we carried out immunofluorescence studies using the deleted chimera β/OSMRΔ1, which is generally better expressed than the full-length construct (18.Hermanns H.M. Radtke S. Haan C. Schmitz-Van de Leur H. Tavernier J. Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6651-6658PubMed Google Scholar), almost no surface staining was detectable in cells expressing this chimera without Jak1 (Fig. 2B, first panel), whereas we obtained bright surface staining when coexpressing Jak1 (Fig. 2B, third panel). Similar to the pattern observed for wild type OSMR (Fig. 1A), a large portion of the heterologously expressed β/OSMRΔ1 chimeras was present in intracellular compartments (Fig. 2B, second and fourth panels). Again we carried out FACS analysis to further assess the surface expression of chimeric receptor proteins. In COS-7 cells coexpressing Jak1, the surface expression of both β/OSMR and β/OSMRΔ1 was up-regulated (Fig. 2C, upper panel). It should be noted that in immunofluorescence staining as well as in FACS analysis (data not shown), the signals obtained by staining the IL-5Rβ chimeras were weaker compared with signals obtained from staining the OSMR, probably due to different affinities of the antibodies used. However, the relative up-regulation of the β/OSMR as measured by FACS analysis was comparable to that observed for the OSMR (Fig. 1B). Importantly the steady state receptor levels of β/OSMR chimeras did not change significantly upon Jak1 coexpression as demonstrated by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2C, lower panel). However, Endo H analysis of immunoprecipitated chimeras revealed that the glycosylation state of receptors was altered in cells coexpressing Jak1. When we expressed β/OSMRΔ1 without Jak1, most of the precipitated receptors were Endo H-sensitive (Fig. 2D, lanes 1 and 2) indicating that these receptors had not been fully processed yet and still contain N-glycans of the high mannose form susceptible to Endo H digestion. Upon Jak1 coexpression, an additional Endo H-resistant protein band of lower mobility was detectable (Fig. 2D, lanes 3 and 4, filled arrowhead) representing the fully processed receptor form carrying complex-type N-glycans that cannot be removed by Endo H. (It should be noted that detection of the two different forms of β/OSMRΔ1 depends on a good resolution in the SDS gel. Under other conditions, it is hardly possible to discriminate these two bands.) However, a large portion of the immunoprecipitated receptors were still Endo H-sensitive (Fig. 2D, lanes 3 and 4, open arrowheads). These results thus match the data achieved from immunofluorescence analysis. We next examined whether binding of Jak1 to the receptor is needed for OSMR up-regulation at the plasma membrane. Since it is known that the proline-rich box1 region of cytokine receptors is important for Jak recruitment (for review, see Ref. 3.Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Müller-Newen G. Schaper F. Graeve L. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 297-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar), we generated chimeric receptors in which the two proline residues, 775 and 777, of box1 were exchanged by alanine (β/OSMRΔ1-mutbox1) or that completely lack this region (β/OSMRΔ1-Δbox1) (Fig. 2A). In both cases we used Δ1 constructs because these were better expressed than the full-length constructs (15.Hermanns H.M. Radtke S. Schaper F. Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40742-40748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 18.Hermanns H.M. Radtke S. Haan C. Schmitz-Van de Leur H. Tavernier J. Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6651-6658PubMed Google Scholar). When coexpressing the mutated receptors with Jak1 in COS-7 cells, we did not find any significant up-regulation of either mutants compared with the construct with an intact box1 region (Fig. 3A, upper panel). These data match the binding data as only for the β/OSMRΔ1 construct could Jak1 association be clearly demonstrated (Fig. 3A, lower panels). We have recently shown that two specific Jak1 mutants with amino acid exchanges in their N-terminal β-grasp domain, Jak1 L80A/Y81A and Jak1 Y107A, completely lost their ability to bind to gp130 (9.Haan C. Is'harc H. Hermanns H.M. Schmitz-Van De Leur H. Kerr I.M. Heinrich P.C. Grotzinger J. Behrmann I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37451-37458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). When we coexpressed the chimera β/OSMRΔ1 with these mutants or wild type Jak1, only the latter led to receptor up-regulation (Fig. 3B, upper panel). Neither mutant bound to the OSMR chimera even though both were expressed to a similar extent as wild type Jak1, which readily coprecipitated with β/OSMRΔ1 (Fig. 3B, lower panels). This again demonstrates that Jak1 binding to the OSMR is required for receptor up-regulation at the cell surface. As we have shown in earlier studies that overexpression of Jak1 in COS-7 cells can lead to ligand-independent phosphorylation of coexpressed receptors (15.Hermanns H.M. Radtke S. Schaper F. Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40742-40748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), we examined next whether Jak1 kinase activity is involved in the surface up-regulation of the OSMR. We therefore coexpressed the constructs β/OSMRΔ1 and Jak1 K907E, which is kinase-negative due to an amino acid exchange in its kinase domain (20.Briscoe J. Rogers N.C. Witthuhn B.A. Watling D. Harpur A.G. Wilks A.F. Stark G.R. Ihle J.N. Kerr I.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 799-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Kinase activity was monitored indirectly by coimmunoprecipitation of STAT3 with the chimeric receptor (which is possible due to ligand-independent receptor phosphorylation when Jak1 is overexpressed (15.Hermanns H.M. Radtke S. Schaper F. Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40742-40748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar)). While binding to β/OSMRΔ1 could be demonstrated for both Jak1 K907E and wild type Jak1, STAT3 coprecipitation was only observed when wild type Jak1 was coexpressed (Fig. 3C, middle panels). Interestingly coexpression of both wild type and the kinase-negative Jak1 with the OSMR chimera resulted in an increased surface expression of β/OSMRΔ1 (Fig. 3C, upper panel). Thus, the association of Jak1 with the OSMR, but not Jak1 kinase activity, is required for the up-regulation of heterologously expressed OSMR constructs. The observed up-regulation of OSMR surface expression by coexpression of Jak1 could be due to the masking of a negative signal present in the OSMR intracellular region. The deletion of this signal should then have the same effect as its masking by binding of Jak1, namely an up-regulation of receptor surface expression. Alternatively Jaks could provide a positive signal to receptor processing. Since Jak1 binding takes place in the box1/2 receptor region, we assumed that any negative signal masked by Jak1 should also be located in this area. A detailed schematic representation of the OSMR box1/2 region is given in Fig. 4A. We examined the surface expression of OSMR chimeras still containing or lacking this region. The mutants β/OSMRΔ1 and β/OSMR-box1/2 displayed similar low surface expression levels as determined by FACS analysis (Fig. 4B, upper panel). Western blot analysis and Endo H treatment revealed that these receptors were expressed mainly in the Endo H-sensitive, incompletely processed form (Fig. 4, B, lower panel, and C). Strikingly the deletion mutants β/OSMR-box1 and β/OSMRΔcyt were expressed much better at the cell surface as determined by FACS analysis (Fig. 4B, upper panel). Interestingly two different protein bands were detectable for these chimeras when monitoring receptor expression by Western blot analysis (Fig. 4B, lower panel), the upper band representing the fully processed form of these receptor constructs as analyzed by Endo H treatment (Fig. 4C). These results are therefore consistent with the presence of a negative regulatory signal in this region. We next examined in more detail where within the cell the different receptor constructs are located. We coexpressed the deleted receptor constructs with enhanced CFP-tagged marker proteins specific for either the ER or Golgi compartment. While β/OSMRΔ1 wa"

As suggested by Ganther (Ganther, H. E. (1999)Carcinogenesis 20, 1657–1666), methylselenol and its precursor methylseleninate might exert their effects by inhibition of the selenoenzyme thioredoxin reductase via the irreversible formation of a diselenide bridge. Here we report that methylseleninate does not act as an inhibitor of mammalian thioredoxin reductase but is in fact an excellent substrate (K m of 18 μm,k cat of 23 s−1), which is reduced by the enzyme according to the equation 2 NADPH + 2 H+ + CH3SeO2H → 2 NADP+ + 2 H2O + CH3SeH. The selenium-containing product of this reaction was identified by mass spectrometry. Nascent methylselenol was found to efficiently reduce both H2O2 and glutathione disulfide. The implications of these findings for the antitumor activity of selenium are discussed. Methylseleninate was a poor substrate not only for human glutathione reductase but also for the non-selenium thioredoxin reductases enzymes from Drosophila melanogaster andPlasmodium falciparum.

Monomethylated selenium derivatives are crucially involved in these chemopreventive effects, and methylselenol (CH3SeH, CAS No. 6486-05-1) is considered a key metabolite (Ref. 6Ip C. Thompson H.J. Zhu Z. Ganther H.E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2882-2886PubMed Google Scholar and Fig. 1). The mechanisms by which selenium exerts these effects is still unresolved. Recently, Howard Ganther (8Ganther H.E. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 1657-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar) suggested that methylselenol might act by forming a diselenide bridge with the essential selenocysteine residue in mammalian thioredoxin reductase (7Gladyshev V.N. Jeang K.T. Stadtman T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6146-6151Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), which would lead to an inhibition of the enzyme (8Ganther H.E. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 1657-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). As judged from model peptides, such diselenide bridges possess a very low midpoint potential (R-SeH + R′-SeH ⇋ R-Se-Se-R′; ΔE0′ −381 mV; see Ref. 9Besse D. Siedler F. Diercks T. Kessler H. Moroder L. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 1997; 36: 883-885Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and should therefore be very stable under physiological conditions. This model is attractive since the homodimeric flavoenzyme thioredoxin reductase (TrxR,1 EC 1.6.4.5, thioredoxin-S2 + NADPH + H+ ⇋ thioredoxin-(SH)2 + NADP+) and its genuine substrate thioredoxin (Trx) are involved in a multitude of cellular metabolic and regulatory pathways, many thereof known to be of importance or (like the reduction of ribonucleotides by ribonucleotide reductase) even essential for the propagation of neoplastic and other diseases. However, due to the involvement of the thioredoxin system in the defense against oxidative stress, the inhibition of TrxR may not be solely beneficial (10Arnér E.S. Holmgren A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6102-6109Crossref PubMed Scopus (1974) Google Scholar, 11Becker K. Gromer S. Schirmer R.H. Müller S. Eur. J.

Oblong J.E. Gasdaska P.Y. Berggren M. Hill S.R. Kirkpatrick D.L. Oncol. Res. 1994; 6: 539-544PubMed Google Scholar).To test the above hypothesis, mice were fed with methylseleninic acid (CH3SeO2H), a precursor of methylselenol (14Ganther H. Ip C. J. Nutr. 2001; 131: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The rodents showed no alteration in TrxR levels and activities. In anin vitro approach, the compound appeared to be a weak competitive inhibitor of TrxR. The concentrations required for inhibition were too high to be of physiological importance. Due to the lack of highly purified enzyme, experiments using quasi-physiologic concentrations of enzyme, NADPH, and methylseleninate were not conducted (14Ganther H. Ip C. J. Nutr. 2001; 131: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). As reported here, we were also unable to find any inhibition in typical incubation experiments using pure enzyme. However, we noticed an unpleasant smell in the sample containing TrxR, methylseleninate, and NADPH that was absent in NADPH-free samples. This indicated the presence of volatile methylselenol as a product of a TrxR-catalyzed reaction (2 NADPH + 2 H+ + CH3SeO2H → 2 NADP+ + CH3SeH + 2 H2O).DISCUSSIONThe biochemical mechanisms by which methylselenol exerts its beneficial effects are largely unknown. Recently, Howard Ganther (8Ganther H.E. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 1657-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar) proposed the diselenide hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, the intermediates of the selenium metabolism, methylselenol or methylselenenate (Fig. 1 and Refs. 3Rayman M.P. Lancet. 2000; 356: 233-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3117) Google Scholar and 4The National Academy of Sciences—Institute of Medicine—Food and Nutrition Board Young V. Garza C.

C.2000: 284-324Google Scholar), would form stable diselenide bridges with essential Sec residues of selenoenzymes. This would result in irreversible inhibition of these enzymes since the reduction potentials of disulfides, selenylsulfides, and diselenides, as judged from model peptides, differ greatly. (Cys-Cys, −205 mV; Sec-Cys, −326 to −332 mV; Sec-Sec, −381 mV; Refs. 9Besse D. Siedler F. Diercks T. Kessler H. Moroder L. Angew. Chem. Int.

Consecutive in vivo experiments were unable to support this hypothesis (14Ganther H. Ip C. J. Nutr. 2001; 131: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).To rule out that this lack of an in vivo effect was due to a metabolic pathway that prevents the selenium compound from reacting with TrxR in the living organism, we performed in vitrostudies using the purified human enzyme since an inhibition under these conditions might then allow the design of a novel and highly selective class of TrxR inhibitors. Unexpectedly, methylseleninate, the stable precursor of methylselenol, not only did notact as an inhibitor of the enzyme but in fact turned out to be an excellent substrate of human TrxR. The stoichiometry of the reaction with NADPH was found to be 2 mol of NADPH/mol of methylseleninate. This is consistent with the proposed overall reaction Eq. 1 (2 NADPH + 2 H+ + CH3SeO2− → 2 NADP+ + CH3Se− + 2 H2O). The data obtained by LDI-TOF mass spectrometry of a silver precipitate provided clear evidence for methylselenolate as a product.As mammalian TrxR reacts with only one NADPH per catalytic cycle (15Gromer S. Arscott L.D. Williams Jr., C.H. Schirmer R.H. Becker K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20096-20101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar,22Arscott L.D. Gromer S. Schirmer R.H.

Becker K. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 591-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), it must be concluded that the above overall reaction is the net result of two reactions as depicted in Eqs. 2 and 3. In the course of the reactions, methylseleninate, methylselenenate, and methylselenolate are present at one time or another. Since we do not observe any inhibition of TrxR activity in the concentration range used, we conclude that simple monomethylated selenium derivatives do not exert their chemopreventive effect by inhibition of TrxR. The lack of effect in vivo is not due to an unexpected pathway preventing the reaction. It may be argued that the TrxR-catalyzed reduction of methylseleninate and consecutive reactions are of negligible importance in the cell since GSH is present in abundance. However, similar theoretical assumptions had formerly been made for the reduction of selenite in which it has recently been shown that the depletion of reduced glutathione hardly alters the rate of selenite reduction in vivo, whereas NADPH is required (38Bhamre S. Nuzzo R.L. Whitin J.C. Olshen R.A. Cohen H.J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 211: 9-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of 25 μm1,3-bis-(2-chlorethyl)-1-nitrosourea used in Ref. 38Bhamre S. Nuzzo R.L. Whitin J.C. Olshen R.A. Cohen H.J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 211: 9-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar was too low for a complete inhibition of TrxR (16Gromer S. Schirmer R.H. Becker K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 318-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 22Arscott L.D. Gromer S. Schirmer R.H. Becker K. Williams Jr., C.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3621-3626Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). This substantiates the finding that selenite can be efficiently reduced by TrxR to yield selenide (39Björnstedt M. Odlander B. Kuprin S. Claesson H.E. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8511-8516Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).Many studies indicate that selenium is most preventive in the early stages of a neoplastic transformation (1Medina D. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1986; 206: 465-472PubMed Google Scholar, 40Lane H.W. Medina D. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 1558-1561PubMed Google Scholar). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are considered important contributors on the cellular way to tumor formation. Therefore the finding that methylselenolate is readily oxidized by H2O2 and to a lesser extent by other hydroperoxides such as t-butyl-hydroperoxide and thereby detoxifies these reactive compounds is of interest. The product of these reactions is methylseleninate (or methylselenenate), which will then be recycled to methylselenol (Eq. 1), resulting in the overall reaction identical to the reaction sequence performed by glutathione peroxidase and reductase.Similar findings have been reported by Björnstedt et al. (41Björnstedt M. Hamberg M. Kumar S. Xue J. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11761-11764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) with catalytically generated selenols from selenocystine. However, the intracellular concentration of selenocysteine is considered to be low (30Arteel G.E. Briviba K. Sies H. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1999; 12: 264-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and the cellular levels of selenocysteine and selenomethionine are regulated. Indeed, if the concentrations are increasing above a certain level, the selenoamino acids are metabolized to methylselenol (Fig. 1). The physicochemical properties of methylselenol are advantageous for many functions: it is a small molecule that in its protonated form (∼8% at pH 6.9 using a pK a of 5.7) can easily pass through and act within membranes without any transport system. This is not the case for many other antioxidants such as ascorbate and glutathione. In the absence of oxidative stress and in the presence of a functional glutathione system, the involvement of TrxR in the maintenance of the methylselenol level may be negligible. However, under certain (patho)physiological conditions and in some compartments, TrxR-catalyzed methylselenol formation is likely to be of importance.As the pK a increases in hydrophobic environments, methylselenol will further concentrate in membranes. There it may, apart from the cleavage of hydroperoxides, be capable of reducing other reactive oxygen species (CH3SeH + “ROS” → CH3SeO2− + H+ + “Non-ROS”) and thereby prevent alkylhydroperoxides from being formed in the first place. 2It should be recalled that the oxygen concentration in membranes is ∼3 mm. As it can be calculated from the Michaelis-Menten equation, the CH3SeO2− turnover is more important than the actual methylselenol concentration. The formed methylseleninate can be assumed to exhibit a much lower pK a than methylselenol and should therefore be “expelled” from the membrane to the cytosol. It is tempting to speculate that this might explain the mutual saving effect of selenium and the lipid-protective vitamin E (42Tamura T. Gladyshev V. Liu S.Y. Stadtman T.C. Biofactors. 1995; 5: 99-102PubMed Google Scholar).The antioxidative point of view is further substantiated if we take into account that our data indicate that methylselenol and TrxR are capable of functionally replacing glutathione reductase (Eqs. Equation 7, Equation 8, Equation 9). Since many important pathways in the cellular metabolism, such as the detoxification of alkylhydroperoxides and the GSH conjugation of xenobiotics, are dependent on a constant flow of reduced glutathione, it is tempting to speculate that TrxR via methylselenol is capable of partially maintaining these GSH fluxes under conditions in which glutathione reductase activity is impaired. Reduced thioredoxin has already been found to exhibit an efficient glutathione reductase-like activity (20Kanzok S.M. Fechner A. Bauer H. Ulschmid J.K. Müller H.M. Botella-Munoz J. Schneuwly S. Schirmer R. Becker K. Science. 2001; 291: 643-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar); however, Trx is very bulky in comparison to methylselenol. Thus methylselenol may perform the GSSG reduction task in environments inaccessible to Trx. The effects of TrxR and methylselenol depicted here are not solely responsible for the chemopreventive effects of selenium. Nevertheless, they provide further insight into the chemical basis of the mechanisms mediating the positive effects of selenium. The trace element selenium is known to possess tumor preventive and other health beneficial activities (1Medina D. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1986; 206: 465-472PubMed Google Scholar, 2Medina D.

C.2000: 284-324Google Scholar, 5Schrauzer G.N. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1864-1873Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Monomethylated selenium derivatives are crucially involved in these chemopreventive effects, and methylselenol (CH3SeH, CAS No. 6486-05-1) is considered a key metabolite (Ref. 6Ip C. Thompson H.J. Zhu Z. Ganther H.E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2882-2886PubMed Google Scholar and Fig. 1). The mechanisms by which selenium exerts these effects is still unresolved. Recently, Howard Ganther (8Ganther H.E. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 1657-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar) suggested that methylselenol might act by forming a diselenide bridge with the essential selenocysteine residue in mammalian thioredoxin reductase (7Gladyshev V.N. Jeang K.T. Stadtman T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6146-6151Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), which would lead to an inhibition of the enzyme (8Ganther H.E. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 1657-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). As judged from model peptides, such diselenide bridges possess a very low midpoint potential (R-SeH + R′-SeH ⇋ R-Se-Se-R′; ΔE0′ −381 mV; see Ref. 9Besse D. Siedler F. Diercks T. Kessler H. Moroder L. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 1997; 36: 883-885Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and should therefore be very stable under physiological conditions. This model is attractive since the homodimeric flavoenzyme thioredoxin reductase (TrxR,1 EC 1.6.4.5, thioredoxin-S2 + NADPH + H+ ⇋ thioredoxin-(SH)2 + NADP+) and its genuine substrate thioredoxin (Trx) are involved in a multitude of cellular metabolic and regulatory pathways, many thereof known to be of importance or (like the reduction of ribonucleotides by ribonucleotide reductase) even essential for the propagation of neoplastic and other diseases. However, due to the involvement of the thioredoxin system in the defense against oxidative stress, the inhibition of TrxR may not be solely beneficial (10Arnér E.S. Holmgren A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6102-6109Crossref PubMed Scopus (1974) Google Scholar, 11Becker K. Gromer S. Schirmer R.H. Müller S. Eur. J.

Oblong J.E. Gasdaska P.Y. Berggren M. Hill S.R. Kirkpatrick D.L. Oncol. Res. 1994; 6: 539-544PubMed Google Scholar). To test the above hypothesis, mice were fed with methylseleninic acid (CH3SeO2H), a precursor of methylselenol (14Ganther H. Ip C. J. Nutr. 2001; 131: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The rodents showed no alteration in TrxR levels and activities. In anin vitro approach, the compound appeared to be a weak competitive inhibitor of TrxR. The concentrations required for inhibition were too high to be of physiological importance. Due to the lack of highly purified enzyme, experiments using quasi-physiologic concentrations of enzyme, NADPH, and methylseleninate were not conducted (14Ganther H. Ip C. J. Nutr. 2001; 131: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). As reported here, we were also unable to find any inhibition in typical incubation experiments using pure enzyme. However, we noticed an unpleasant smell in the sample containing TrxR, methylseleninate, and NADPH that was absent in NADPH-free samples. This indicated the presence of volatile methylselenol as a product of a TrxR-catalyzed reaction (2 NADPH + 2 H+ + CH3SeO2H → 2 NADP+ + CH3SeH + 2 H2O). DISCUSSIONThe biochemical mechanisms by which methylselenol exerts its beneficial effects are largely unknown. Recently, Howard Ganther (8Ganther H.E. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 1657-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar) proposed the diselenide hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, the intermediates of the selenium metabolism, methylselenol or methylselenenate (Fig. 1 and Refs. 3Rayman M.P. Lancet. 2000; 356: 233-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3117) Google Scholar and 4The National Academy of Sciences—Institute of Medicine—Food and Nutrition Board Young V. Garza C.

C.2000: 284-324Google Scholar), would form stable diselenide bridges with essential Sec residues of selenoenzymes. This would result in irreversible inhibition of these enzymes since the reduction potentials of disulfides, selenylsulfides, and diselenides, as judged from model peptides, differ greatly. (Cys-Cys, −205 mV; Sec-Cys, −326 to −332 mV; Sec-Sec, −381 mV; Refs. 9Besse D. Siedler F. Diercks T. Kessler H. Moroder L. Angew. Chem. Int.

It must, however, be pointed out that the local environment in a protein and/or membrane may strongly influence these values (32Chivers P.T. Prehoda K.E. Raines R.T.

J. 1999; 340: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), was recommended a test case,e.g. enzyme-SeH + CH3SeOH → enzyme-Se-Se-CH3 + H2O. Consecutive in vivo experiments were unable to support this hypothesis (14Ganther H. Ip C. J. Nutr. 2001; 131: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).To rule out that this lack of an in vivo effect was due to a metabolic pathway that prevents the selenium compound from reacting with TrxR in the living organism, we performed in vitrostudies using the purified human enzyme since an inhibition under these conditions might then allow the design of a novel and highly selective class of TrxR inhibitors. Unexpectedly, methylseleninate, the stable precursor of methylselenol, not only did notact as an inhibitor of the enzyme but in fact turned out to be an excellent substrate of human TrxR. The stoichiometry of the reaction with NADPH was found to be 2 mol of NADPH/mol of methylseleninate. This is consistent with the proposed overall reaction Eq. 1 (2 NADPH + 2 H+ + CH3SeO2− → 2 NADP+ + CH3Se− + 2 H2O). The data obtained by LDI-TOF mass spectrometry of a silver precipitate provided clear evidence for methylselenolate as a product.As mammalian TrxR reacts with only one NADPH per catalytic cycle (15Gromer S. Arscott L.D. Williams Jr., C.H. Schirmer R.H. Becker K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20096-20101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar,22Arscott L.D. Gromer S. Schirmer R.H.

Becker K. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 591-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), it must be concluded that the above overall reaction is the net result of two reactions as depicted in Eqs. 2 and 3. In the course of the reactions, methylseleninate, methylselenenate, and methylselenolate are present at one time or another. Since we do not observe any inhibition of TrxR activity in the concentration range used, we conclude that simple monomethylated selenium derivatives do not exert their chemopreventive effect by inhibition of TrxR. The lack of effect in vivo is not due to an unexpected pathway preventing the reaction. It may be argued that the TrxR-catalyzed reduction of methylseleninate and consecutive reactions are of negligible importance in the cell since GSH is present in abundance. However, similar theoretical assumptions had formerly been made for the reduction of selenite in which it has recently been shown that the depletion of reduced glutathione hardly alters the rate of selenite reduction in vivo, whereas NADPH is required (38Bhamre S. Nuzzo R.L. Whitin J.C. Olshen R.A. Cohen H.J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 211: 9-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of 25 μm1,3-bis-(2-chlorethyl)-1-nitrosourea used in Ref. 38Bhamre S. Nuzzo R.L. Whitin J.C. Olshen R.A. Cohen H.J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 211: 9-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar was too low for a complete inhibition of TrxR (16Gromer S. Schirmer R.H. Becker K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 318-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 22Arscott L.D. Gromer S. Schirmer R.H. Becker K. Williams Jr., C.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3621-3626Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). This substantiates the finding that selenite can be efficiently reduced by TrxR to yield selenide (39Björnstedt M. Odlander B. Kuprin S. Claesson H.E. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8511-8516Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).Many studies indicate that selenium is most preventive in the early stages of a neoplastic transformation (1Medina D. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1986; 206: 465-472PubMed Google Scholar, 40Lane H.W. Medina D. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 1558-1561PubMed Google Scholar). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are considered important contributors on the cellular way to tumor formation. Therefore the finding that methylselenolate is readily oxidized by H2O2 and to a lesser extent by other hydroperoxides such as t-butyl-hydroperoxide and thereby detoxifies these reactive compounds is of interest. The product of these reactions is methylseleninate (or methylselenenate), which will then be recycled to methylselenol (Eq. 1), resulting in the overall reaction identical to the reaction sequence performed by glutathione peroxidase and reductase.Similar findings have been reported by Björnstedt et al. (41Björnstedt M. Hamberg M. Kumar S. Xue J. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11761-11764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) with catalytically generated selenols from selenocystine. However, the intracellular concentration of selenocysteine is considered to be low (30Arteel G.E. Briviba K. Sies H. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1999; 12: 264-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and the cellular levels of selenocysteine and selenomethionine are regulated. Indeed, if the concentrations are increasing above a certain level, the selenoamino acids are metabolized to methylselenol (Fig. 1). The physicochemical properties of methylselenol are advantageous for many functions: it is a small molecule that in its protonated form (∼8% at pH 6.9 using a pK a of 5.7) can easily pass through and act within membranes without any transport system. This is not the case for many other antioxidants such as ascorbate and glutathione. In the absence of oxidative stress and in the presence of a functional glutathione system, the involvement of TrxR in the maintenance of the methylselenol level may be negligible. However, under certain (patho)physiological conditions and in some compartments, TrxR-catalyzed methylselenol formation is likely to be of importance.As the pK a increases in hydrophobic environments, methylselenol will further concentrate in membranes. There it may, apart from the cleavage of hydroperoxides, be capable of reducing other reactive oxygen species (CH3SeH + “ROS” → CH3SeO2− + H+ + “Non-ROS”) and thereby prevent alkylhydroperoxides from being formed in the first place. 2It should be recalled that the oxygen concentration in membranes is ∼3 mm. As it can be calculated from the Michaelis-Menten equation, the CH3SeO2− turnover is more important than the actual methylselenol concentration. The formed methylseleninate can be assumed to exhibit a much lower pK a than methylselenol and should therefore be “expelled” from the membrane to the cytosol. It is tempting to speculate that this might explain the mutual saving effect of selenium and the lipid-protective vitamin E (42Tamura T. Gladyshev V. Liu S.Y. Stadtman T.C. Biofactors. 1995; 5: 99-102PubMed Google Scholar).The antioxidative point of view is further substantiated if we take into account that our data indicate that methylselenol and TrxR are capable of functionally replacing glutathione reductase (Eqs. Equation 7, Equation 8, Equation 9). Since many important pathways in the cellular metabolism, such as the detoxification of alkylhydroperoxides and the GSH conjugation of xenobiotics, are dependent on a constant flow of reduced glutathione, it is tempting to speculate that TrxR via methylselenol is capable of partially maintaining these GSH fluxes under conditions in which glutathione reductase activity is impaired.

This pathway, found in many bacteria, the plastids of plant cells, and the apicomplexan parasites such as the malarial causative agents Plasmodium spp. and the opportunistic human pathogen Toxoplasma gondii, leads to the formation of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and its isomer dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) (11Rohmer M.

Since vertebrates synthesize isoprenoid precursors using a mevalonate-dependent pathway, enzymes of the mevalonate-independent pathway for isoprenoid production represent attractive targets for the structure-based design of selective antibacterial, herbicidal, and antimalarial drugs.

MECDP synthase (16Herz S. Wungsintaweekul J. Schuhr C.A. Hecht S. Luttgen H. Sagner S. Fellermeier M. Eisenreich W. Zenk M.H. Bacher A. Rohdich F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In this report, we describe the three-dimensional structures of E. coli MECDP synthase bound to Mn2+ and the reaction products CMP and MECDP. This study precisely defines the active site features utilized for substrate recognition and catalytic formation of MECDP. The E. coli ispFgene (formerly ygbB, GenBankTM accession numberAF230738) encoding MECDP synthase was PCR-amplified from E. coli K12 and inserted into the pHIS8 expression vector (18Jez J.M. Ferrer J.L. Bowman M.E. Dixon R.A. Noel J.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 890-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). N-terminal His8-tagged protein was expressed in BL21(DE3) cells. Tagged MECDP synthase was purified from sonicates using a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen) column. The histidine tag was removed using thrombin, and the cleaved synthase was purified to greater than 99% homogeneity by gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex-200 (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) FPLC column. MECDP synthase-containing fractions were combined and concentrated to 13.5 mg ml−1. Selenomethionine (SeMet)-substituted protein was obtained from E. coli grown in minimal medium using the methionine pathway inhibition approach described by Doublié (19Doublié S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar) and purified as described above for the native protein. A mixture of MEP (522 μmol), CTP (590 μmol), ATP (590 μmol), MgCl2 (73 μmol), Tris-HCl, pH 7.8 (730 μmol), NaOH (1.9 μmol), dl-dithiothreitol (7.3 μmol), CDP-ME synthetase (E. coli, 40 units), inorganic pyrophosphatase (67 units), CDP-ME kinase (E. coli, 6 mg), and MECDP synthase (E. coli, 6 mg) was incubated for 20 h at 37 °C in a total volume of 7.3 ml. Approximately 80% of the MEP was converted to MECDP as determined by 1H NMR analysis using acetone as an internal standard. The crude reaction mixture was deproteinized (10,000 nominal molecular weight limit filter, Millipore), lyophilized, and then dissolved in 67% (v/v) cold ethanol. The unreacted CTP and ATP together with the products CMP and ADP formed a white precipitate, which was removed by centrifugation (6000 rpm, 15 min). The supernatant was brought up to 22 ml with water and loaded onto an ion exchange column (hand packed Chromabond SB-LV, 2.5 × 150 mm, Macherey & Nagel). The column was eluted with a linear gradient of aqueous ammonium formate (0.1-1.0 m) over a total volume of 240 ml at a flow rate of 3 ml min−1. The eluate was monitored by TLC (SIL N-HR, Macherey & Nagel plates developed in n-propanol:water:ethyl acetate using a 30:15:5 mixture and stained with anisaldehyde:ethanol:sulfuric acid using a 4:2:94 mixture). MECDP (retention time 45 min, 1H and31P NMR analysis) was obtained in 46% yield based on1H NMR analysis using acetone and methanol as internal standards with no detectable impurities. Negative ion electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry: calculated for [M − H] C5H11O9P2, 276.9878; observed, 276.9922. Crystals of MECDP synthase were obtained by the vapor diffusion method at 4 °C in 2-μl hanging drops containing a 1:1 mixture of a 13.5 mg ml−1 protein solution with crystallization buffer (0.8 m(NH4)2SO4, 1% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 400, 0.2 m sodium iodide, 2 mmdl-dithiothreitol, 0.1 m PIPES, pH 6.5). Crystals appeared after several days as regular hexagons of approximate dimensions 300 × 100 μm. These crystals were stabilized in the presence of the same crystallization buffer containing up to 17.5% (v/v) ethylene glycol. MECDP synthase crystals belong to space group I213 with unit cell dimensions of a = b = c = 143 Å containing one monomer per asymmetric unit and a solvent content of 83%. Crystals of SeMet-substituted enzyme complexed with CMP and MECDP were obtained as described above by crystallization in the presence of 5 mm CMP, 5 mm MECDP, 10 mm MgCl2 using 0.8 m(NH4)2SO4 at room temperature. Multiple-wavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) data were collected at the selenium edge, measuring three wavelengths with the reverse beam technique, on a SeMet-substituted MECDP synthase crystal co-crystallized with 5 mm CMP and 5 mm MECDP on beamline FIP (BM30A) of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF, Grenoble, France) equipped with a MAR charge coupled device detector (165 mm). The crystal was subsequently recovered, and a higher resolution data set was collected on beamline ID14–1 equipped with same detector at the ESRF. A data set on the apoprotein was later collected on beamline ID14–4 to a final resolution of 2.8 Å using an ADSC Q4R charge coupled device detector (188 mm).

Open table in a new tab The crystal structure of MECDP synthase was solved using a MAD data set collected on FIP with the SeMet-substituted protein. Selenium positions were determined using Shake'n'Bake (23Weeks C.M. Miller R. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1999; 32: 120-124Crossref Scopus (384) Google Scholar). A fourth site was added later after inspection of the sharpened anomalous difference Patterson map. Experimental phases were calculated to 3.5-Å resolution and then improved and extended by solvent flattening to 3.0-Å resolution. MAD phasing and density modification with CNS (24Brunger A.T.

Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16948) Google Scholar) generated a readily interpretable electron density map. All subsequent refinement steps were carried out with CNS (24Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16948) Google Scholar). Model building was carried out with the program O (25Jones T.A. Kjeldgaard M.O. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 173-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar) using SIGMAA-weighted ‖2Fo −Fc ‖, ‖Fo −Fc ‖ electron density maps (26Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19733) Google Scholar) and ‖3Fo − 2Fc ‖ electron density omit maps. Refinement consisted of iterative cycles of simulated annealing, positional refinement, and B-value refinement. The initial rounds of building and refinement included residues 1–60 and 72–153 of MECDP synthase and were accomplished using the original MAD data set extending to 3.0-Å resolution. 5% of the reflections were randomly selected to provide a test set of data during refinement. The final steps of building and refinement were accomplished using higher resolution data extending to 2.8-Å resolution (Table I). This refined structure of MECDP synthase complexed with CMP, MECDP, and Mn2+ was used as the starting model for the construction of the Mn2+ complex (“apo” form) after a single step of rigid body refinement. According to PROCHECK (27Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), both models show at least 80% of the main chain torsion angles for non-glycine and non-proline residues in the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot. Residues 63–70 exhibit poorer stereochemistry, and this segment remained poorly defined throughout refinement as evidenced in all calculated electron density maps. The figures were generated using MOLSCRIPT (28Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar) and BOBSCRIPT (29Esnouf R.M. J. Mol. Graph. Model. 1997; 15 (112–113): 132-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (1794) Google Scholar) and rendered with POV-RAY (www.povray.org). The MECDP synthase monomer spans 159 residues, and the polypeptide chain folds into a single domain. Each polypeptide of the homotrimer organizes around a central, four-stranded β-sheet that packs against three α-helices, two 310helices, and an extended two-strand-containing β-flap (Fig.2 A). This β-flap, located between β1 and α1, contains a small two-stranded antiparallel β-sheet (β2 and β3) that folds back against the monomeric subunit near the upper N-terminal side of the α-helix bundle. This extra motif, or “flap,” is structurally similar to the extended “arm” involved in a key intersubunit domain swap in the structure of CDP-ME synthetase (30Richard S.B. Bowman M.E. Kwiatkowski W. Kang I. Chow C. Lillo A.M. Cane D.E. Noel J.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 641-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). While the flap does not participate in the formation of the homotrimer, it may be involved in the formation of a larger multienzyme complex by mediating protein-protein interactions among the enzymes of the DXP/MEP pathway. β1, β4, and β5 of the main β-sheet, composed of residues 2–11, 90–100, and 127–132, respectively, run parallel, while β6, located between β1 and β4, runs antiparallel. Helices α1 and α2 are connected by a 21-residue loop that is not well defined in the calculated electron density maps. Clear density accounting for CMP, MECDP, and a tetrahedrally coordinated metal ion extend across two adjacent monomers and bracket β1 (Fig. 2 B). A number of hydrodynamic analyses including gel filtration chromatography, analytical ultracentrifugation, and static light scattering demonstrate equilibrium of monomeric, trimeric, and hexameric states of MECDP synthase with the trimeric form predominating (data not shown). Analysis of the crystal packing clearly revealed the homotrimeric form of the enzyme (Fig. 2 A). The quaternary fold exhibits a modular construction of three units that pack into a circular assembly with perfect 3-fold symmetry (Fig. 2 C). The β-sheet motif of one monomer is packed against the related β-strands of the two adjacent monomers, forming a three-bladed propeller-like arrangement (Fig. 2 C). This structure creates a central triangular barrel with the β-strands of the barrel approximately parallel to the crystallographic 3-fold axis. The nine remaining α-helices of the trimer enclose the symmetric β-barrel. Similar quaternary arrangements observed previously include the E. coli YjgF protein (31Volz K. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2428-2437Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), the YabJ protein (32Sinha S. Rappu P. Lange S.C. Mantsala P. Zalkin H. Smith J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 9: 13074-13079Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar), chorismate mutase (33Ladner J.E. Reddy P. Davis A. Tordova M. Howard A.J. Gilliland G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 673-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and holoacyl carrier protein synthase from Bacillus subtilis(34Parris K.D. Lin L. Tam A. Mathew R. Hixon J. Stahl M. Fritz C.C. Seehra J. Somers W.S. Struct. Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 883-895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In nearly all cases including the present study of MECDP synthase, this quaternary arrangement is functionally essential since each of the three active sites are formed by separate polypeptide chains participating in formation of the homotrimeric structure. A network of complementary hydrophobic contacts, electrostatic interactions, and specific hydrogen bonds stabilize the circular structure between close-packed monomers. His10 and Arg2 located on β1 extend outward from one monomer and link via a salt bridge to Glu135 positioned on the end of β5 and Asp126 situated on a 310 helix of the adjacent monomer. The side chains of Arg142, Glu144, Phe139, Thr140, Ile99, Phe7, Glu149, His5, Val151, Ile3, Leu153, and Met1 organize along the interface separating the individual monomers (Fig. 2 D). Notably Glu149 and His5, from β6 and β1, respectively, associate at the bottom of the trimeric β-barrel through a complex salt bridge linking the three monomers together. The top two-thirds of the trimeric barrel form a spacious cavity into which protrudes a set of largely hydrophobic side chains including Phe139, Thr140, Ile99, and Phe7 (Fig.2 D). The cavity maintains an ellipsoidal shape with the widest part at the equatorial position (16 Å wide). The cap of the intersubunit cavity opens at the top but narrows due to a crown of symmetric salt bridges involving Arg142 and Glu144 resulting in a 5-Å-diameter aperture (Fig. 2,C and D). The bottom of the cavity is closed off by a second complex salt bridge composed of the three glutamate (Glu149) and three histidine (His5) residues mentioned in the previous section (Fig. 2 D). All of these residues are highly conserved in the MECDP synthase family, and they provide functional support for the trimeric form observed in the crystal. Notably additional electron density occupies the intermonomeric cavity (Fig. 2 D). The entrance to the hydrophobic barrel appears to be capped by a sulfate or phosphate moiety that is sequestered by symmetric interactions with the δ-guanido side chains of Arg142 from each monomer. This electron density extends inward through the hydrophobic core of the cavity along the crystallographic 3-fold axis. Positive identification of the source of this additional electron density is difficult to ascertain from the structure due to the presence of the crystallographic axis and the moderate resolution of the structure. While chemical identification of the origin of this density is currently underway using redissolved crystals, a scenario consistent with the chemical environment of the intermonomeric cavity can be offered. The shape of the experimentally determined electron density and the local chemical environment of the cavity are consistent with the sequestration of a molecule possessing a negatively charged head group and a hydrophobic tail such as an isoprenoid diphosphate-like molecule (Fig. 2 D). Isopentenyl diphosphate (C5-IPP), dimethylallyl diphosphate (C5-DMAPP), geranyl diphosphate (C10-GPP), and farnesyl diphosphate (C15-FPP) can all be nicely accommodated in the observed electron density lining the cavity with the optimal fit provided by GPP (Fig. 2 D). The possible regulatory and catalytic roles for such a binding event are currently under examination. A key element of the current study was the successful structural elucidation of MECDP synthase bound to the reaction products CMP and MECDP, thus affording the location of active site residues. The three active sites reside at the interfaces of adjacent monomers providing mechanistic relevance to the formation of trimeric MECDP synthase. Residues contributing to the nucleoside-binding portion of the active site originate from the loop linking β4 and α3. The pyrimidine base of the CMP molecule contacts the enzyme through main chain interactions with Ala100, Pro103, Met105, and Leu106 of monomer A. The ribose sugar reaches across to monomer B and forms hydrogen bonds between the carboxyl group of Asp56 of monomer B and the 2′- and 3′-hydroxyl moieties of the sugar. Finally the α-phosphate of CMP reaches back to monomer A and forms two hydrogen bonds with the backbone and side chain of Thr133of monomer A (Fig. 3 A). The side chains of Asp8, His10, and His42 of monomer B and a nonbridging phosphate oxygen of MECDP tetragonally coordinate a putative cation at the base of the active site (Fig. 3, A and B). Divalent cations such as Mg2+ and Mn2+ are required for catalytic activity of MECDP synthase (16Herz S. Wungsintaweekul J. Schuhr C.A. Hecht S. Luttgen H. Sagner S. Fellermeier M. Eisenreich W.

Tetrahedron Lett. 2000; 41: 3395-3398Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In these studies, the highest activities were measured using Mg2+ or Mn2+, but other transition metal cations supported catalysis (35Rohdich F. Eisenreich W. Wungsintaweekul J. Hecht S. Schuhr C.A. Bacher A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3190-3197Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). While Mg2+ was included prior to and during crystallization, the geometry of the coordination sphere and the soft nature of the coordinating side chains suggest transition metal binding. Initial examination of the metal content of the purified protein by induced coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy supports the presence of Mn2+ and Ni2+, both of which can form tetragonal coordination complexes. The presence of Ni2+ most likely arises during purification, while Mn2+ is probably carried along from the E. coliexpression system. The MECDP binding site extends across monomer B and utilizes both stereospecific hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions for sequestration by monomer B and its associated transition metal binding site (Fig. 3 B). The positions of the reaction products CMP and MECDP in the enzyme active site allow us to model the position of the substrate CDP-ME2P in the intermonomeric catalytic site (Fig.3 C). Furthermore, this model suggests a likely catalytic mechanism accompanying cyclodiphosphate generation that is enzymatically controlled by proximity and metal cation-assisted catalysis (Fig. 3 C). A key structural element in the proposed reaction mechanism is the four points binding of CDP-ME2P pictured in Fig. 3 C. This arrangement precisely positions the bridging phosphate undergoing attack near the nonbridging phosphate that is the nucleophile responsible for the formation of the cyclodiphosphate moiety of MECDP. The tetragonally coordinated transition metal contributes to formation of the transition state accompanying cyclization by both arranging the phosphate undergoing nucleophilic attack and by serving to counterbalance the negative charge that develops in the pentacoordinate transition state (Fig.3 C). This study establishes the structural basis underlying the unique formation of the cyclodiphosphate-containing isoprenoid precursor MECDP. The chemical strategy accompanying enzymatic catalysis by MECDP synthase includes metal cation-assisted formation of a cyclic phosphodiester bond that is enhanced by molding a reactive substrate into a productive binding mode."

Two murine members of this family, Single Minded 1 (SIM1) and Single Minded 2 (SIM2), are essential for postnatal survival but differ from other prototypical family members such as the dioxin receptor (DR) and hypoxia-inducible factors, in that they behave as transcriptional repressors in mammalian one-hybrid experiments and have yet to be ascribed a regulating signal. In cell lines engineered to stably express SIM1 and SIM2, we show that both are nuclear proteins that constitutively complex with the general bHLH/PAS partner factor, ARNT. We report that the murine SIM factors, in combination with ARNT, attenuate transcription from the hypoxia-inducible erythropoietin (EPO) enhancer during hypoxia. Such cross-talk between coexpressed bHLH/PAS factors can occur through competition for ARNT, which we find evident in SIM repression of DR-induced transcription from a xenobiotic response element reporter gene. However, SIM1/ARNT, but not SIM2/ARNT, can activate transcription from the EPOenhancer at normoxia, implying that the SIM proteins have the ability to bind hypoxia response elements and affect either activation or repression of transcription. This notion is supported by co-immunoprecipitation of EPO enhancer sequences with the SIM2 protein. SIM protein levels decrease with hypoxia treatment in our stable cell lines, although levels of the transcripts encoding SIM1 and SIM2 and the approximately 2-h half-lives of each protein are unchanged during hypoxia. Inhibition of protein synthesis, known to occur in cells during hypoxic stress in order to decrease ATP utilization, appears to account for the fall in SIM levels. Our data suggest the existence of a hypoxic switch mechanism in cells that coexpress hypoxia-inducible factor and SIM proteins, where up-regulation and activation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α is concomitant with attenuation of SIM activities.

The related dioxin (aryl hydrocarbon) receptor (DR) has a poorly understood role in embryonic liver and kidney vascularization (5Lahvis G.P. Lindell S.L. Thomas R.S. McCuskey R.S. Murphy C. Glover E.

More recently, bHLH/PAS proteins such as CLOCK and BMAL/CYCLE/MOP3 have been found to be critical for the central pacemaker function of the suprachiasmatic nucleus that generates circadian rhythms (7Dunlap J.

Other bHLH/PAS proteins have been demonstrated to be essential for embryonic development but, in contrast to the above factors, are not known to be regulated by environmental signals. Such transcription factors includeDrosophila Single Minded (dSIM) and Trachealess (TRH), which function in specifying central nervous system midline cells or tubular structures such as airway passages and salivary glands, respectively (9Nambu J.R.

Two mammalian SIM proteins have been described thus far, SIM1 and SIM2, which are among the rare members of this family reported to be transcriptional repressors (for a recent review, see Ref. 12Crews S.T. Fan C.M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 580-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Murine SIM1 and SIM2 show high amino acid identity in their N termini (∼90% identity in the bHLH and PAS regions) but are completely divergent in their C termini (13Ema M. Morita M. Ikawa S.

Gene (Amst.). 2001; 270: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). On closer examination, these expression patterns can be overlapping yet distinct at the cellular level. For example, Sim1 is expressed in cells immediately adjacent to the ventral midline cells of the diencephalon expressing Sim2 (14Fan C.M. Kuwana E. Bulfone A. Fletcher C.F. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Crews S. Martinez S. Puelles L. Rubenstein J.L. Tessier-Lavigne M. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1996; 7: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Targeted gene deletions have shown the separate genes expressing these factors to be essential for survival. Both Sim1 −/− andSim2 −/− mice die shortly after birth;Sim1 −/− pups lack critical neuroendocrine secreting cells of the hypothalamus (20Michaud J.L. Rosenquist T. May N.R. Fan C.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3264-3275Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), whereasSim2 −/− pups suffer from a breathing defect for which the details are yet to be published (21Epstein D.J. Martinu L. Michaud J.L. Losos K.M. Fan C. Joyner A.L. Development. 2000; 127: 4701-4709PubMed Google Scholar). 2C. Fan, personal communication. 2C. Fan, personal communication. Disruption of one allele of human Sim1 resulted in severe early onset obesity in one female patient (22Holder Jr., J.L. Butte N.F. Zinn A.R. Hum. Mol.

While these proteins evidently perform critical biological functions, little is known of their mechanisms of action. Despite considerable effort, direct target genes for mammalian SIMs have yet to be clearly elucidated (20Michaud J.L. Rosenquist T. May N.R. Fan C.M.

Dev. 2000; 90: 253-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), while in contrast, a number of target genes of the dSIM protein have been characterized, including Toll, Slit,breathless, and dSim itself (25Wharton Jr., K.

The promoters of dSIM target genes contain dSIM recognition motifs termed the central midline enhancer (CME) element, the core of which is 5′-ACGTG-3′. Heterodimerization with a general bHLH/PAS partner protein, termed ARNT, is obligatory for DNA binding by the SIM proteins, the hypoxia-inducible factors, and the DR (13Ema M. Morita M. Ikawa S.

Pelletier J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4933-4947Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Consistent with the ACGTG motif being at the heart of dSIM response elements, in vitro PCR site selection using dSIM/ARNT heterodimers isolated a core sequence of 5′-GT(C/A)CGTG-3′ (34Swanson H.I. Chan W.K. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26292-26302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Somewhat paradoxically, the CME sequence is also bound by theTrachealess (Trh) gene product and functions as an enhancer in TRH target genes (27Ohshiro T. Saigo K. Development. 1997; 124: 3975-3986Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Zelzer E. Wappner P. Shilo B.Z. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2079-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 36Zelzer E. Shilo B.Z. Mech. Dev. 2000; 91: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The close relationship between the DNA binding basic regions from the bHLH domains of dSIM (KEKSKNAARTRR) and TRH (KEKSRDAARSRR) explains this overlap of activity. By using PAS domain “swap mutants,” it has recently been shown that Drosophila target gene specificities for dSIM and TRH are conferred by their PAS domains, presumably by interacting with discerning cofactors or collaborating transcription factors to activate distinct promoters (35Zelzer E. Wappner P. Shilo B.Z. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2079-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The murine SIMs, which harbor identical (SIM1) or almost identical (one conservative amino acid change, SIM2) basic regions to dSIM (see Fig. 1), have been shown to bind the CME and control the expression of synthetic reporter genes containing repeats of the CME taken from the Drosophila Toll gene (37Moffett P. Pelletier J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, the basic region of murine HIF-1α is identical to that of TRH, while the HIF-2α basic region differs by a single amino acid (Fig. 1). Not surprisingly then, the core sequence of hypoxia response elements (HREs), 5′-ACGTG-3′, is identical to that of the CME. The high similarity between basic regions and consequently DNA recognition sites for a number of bHLH/PAS proteins presents the possibility of cross-coupling and/or interference of gene regulation between these factors. In particular, the two hypoxia-inducible factors and the two SIM proteins, all of which are essential for survival in mammals and have overlapping expression patterns, seemingly have a high potential for binding the same DNA sequences in vivo. In order to investigate the interplay of these factors on known mammalian enhancer sequences, we have analyzed the influence of SIM1 and SIM2 on reporter genes driven by the hypoxia-inducible enhancer of theerythropoietin (EPO) gene (38Wang G.L. Jiang B.H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (4991) Google Scholar). We have created stable cell lines that express Myc epitope-tagged forms of either mouse SIM1 or SIM2 and show these proteins to be exclusively nuclear. The SIM1/ARNT heterodimer is able to activate the reporter gene controlled by the EPO enhancer, whereas the SIM2/ARNT heterodimer represses the hypoxic induction of the reporter gene by competing with the HIF-1α/ARNT heterodimer for the HRE sequence. To investigate the possibility of a hypoxic switch, whereby the hypoxic stabilization of HIF-1α might be coupled to a hypoxic destabilization of the SIM proteins, we examined the levels of SIM transcript and protein during hypoxia and conducted [35S]methionine pulse-chase labeling experiments to measure the half-lives of SIM1 and SIM2. The levels of both SIM proteins were decreased with hypoxic treatment, but since the transcript and protein half-lives were unaltered by oxygen deprivation, this decrease most probably reflects the broad spectrum inhibition of protein synthesis that occurs during hypoxia. A mammalian expression vector for murine SIM2 was generated by inserting theKpnI/NotI fragment from SIM2pBSK (16Ema M. Suzuki M. Morita M. Hirose K. Sogawa K. Matsuda Y. Gotoh O. Saijoh Y. Fujii H.

Krause C. Langer J. BioTechniques. 1996; 21: 1013-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Murine SIM1 and SIM2 expression vectors for production of stably transfected cell lines were generated by PCR incorporation of two consecutive epitope tags from c-myc with a three-alanine spacer (EQKLISEEDLAAAEQKLISEEDL) at the carboxyl terminus of the SIM1 and SIM2 cDNAs and subsequent insertion of each cDNA into pEF/IRESpuro (40Hobbs S. Jitrapakdee S. Wallace J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), creating pEF/SIM1(Myc)2/IRESpuro and pEF/SIM2(Myc)2/IRESpuro. Human ARNTcontaining a PCR-introduced carboxyl-terminal dual hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag was subcloned into pEF-bos-cs (39Goldman L. Cutrone E. Kotenko S. Krause C. Langer J. BioTechniques. 1996; 21: 1013-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) to generate pARNT(HA)2/EF-bos. TheKpnI/SpeI(blunt) fragment from SIM2pBSK and theEagI(blunt)/XbaI fragment from pDR-NLS/CIN4 (41Lees M.J. Whitelaw M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5811-5822Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) were inserted into KpnI/XbaI-digested pEF/IRESpuro (40Hobbs S. Jitrapakdee S. Wallace J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) to generate an expression plasmid for the chimeric protein SIM2/AD, for production of a stably transfected 293T cell line. The SIM2/AD protein contains the first 408 residues of SIM2 fused to amino acids 493–805 from the murine DR, followed by two nuclear localization sequences, two HA, and a six-histidine tag at the C terminus. A constitutively active deletion mutant of the murine DR that lacks sequence from the ligand binding domain (DRΔPASB) (42McGuire J. Okamoto K. Whitelaw M.L. Tanaka H. Poellinger L. J. Biol.

ARNT603 lacks the C-terminal transactivation domain (43Whitelaw M.L. Gustafsson J.A. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell.

Gene (Amst.). 1994; 138: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Human embryonic transformed kidney cell line 293T was routinely maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (complete medium) (JRH Biosciences). To produce stably transfected cell lines, 293T cells in 10-cm dishes were transfected with 5 μg of blank pEF/IRESpuro, pEF/SIM1(Myc)2/IRESpuro, pEF/SIM2(Myc)2/IRESpuro, or pEF/mSIM2/AD/IRESpuro using the liposomal transfection reagent DOTAP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Initial selection with 1 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma) began 24 h after transfection and continued for 2 weeks. Following this, several single antibiotic-resistant colonies were expanded, and the rest of the cells were pooled and similarly expanded in medium containing 20 μg/ml puromycin. Where specified, cells were subjected to a hypoxic microenvironment using anaerobic sachets (OXOID, <1% O2), for a duration of 17 h. Stably transfected monoclonal 293T cell lines were seeded onto coverslips and grown for 48 h before formaldehyde fixation as previously described (45Taylor S. Ha E. McKeon F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Cells were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before being blocked in PBS with 5% skim milk powder for 30 min and then washed once in PBS and incubated for 2 h with 9E10 monoclonal antibody to detect Myc-tagged proteins. After two washes with PBS, cells were incubated for 45 min at room temperature with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated sheep anti-mouse secondary antibody (Silensus) diluted 1:30 in PBS. Following two PBS washes, cells were incubated with bisbenzimide stain (Hoechst 33258; 1 μg/ml; Sigma) for 2 min and washed once in PBS before being dried, and coverslips were mounted onto slides as previously described (45Taylor S.

Stably transfected polyclonal cells were plated onto 24-well plates at 3 × 104 cells/well, and after 12–24 h, transfections were performed using DOTAP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Each transfection contained either 20 ng/well pHRE-LUC or pGL3-Promoter-LUC with 50 ng/well internal control pRL-SV40 or contained 200 ng/well pXRE-LUC and 100 ng/well internal control pRL-TK, together with 200 ng/well of each expression plasmid or blank expression plasmid if necessary to normalize the amount of DNA transfected. Where specified, cells were subjected to a hypoxic environment (<1% O2) using anaerobic sachets (OXOID), beginning 12 h after transfection. Cells were washed with PBS 24–48 h post-transfection and lysed with Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega), and extracts were analyzed for luciferase activity using the Dual Luciferase Reporter assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transient transfections performed to produce whole cell extracts for subsequent immunoblotting involved 48 h transfection with 2 μg of expression plasmid into 293T cells in 6-cm diameter dishes using DOTAP as per the manufacturer's instructions, whereas those for chromatin extract preparation involved 48-h transfection of polyclonal 293TSIM2 cells in 175-cm2 flasks with 20 μg of reporter plasmid using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Stably transfected polyclonal pools of 293T cells expressing either SIM1 or SIM2 or containing the blank expression vector in the control line were seeded into 6-cm diameter dishes prior to being washed and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C with methionine/cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) to deplete intracellular pools of methionine and cysteine. The cells were pulse-labeled for 40 min in the methionine/cysteine-free medium supplemented with 250 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine (Geneworks) and then washed twice and incubated in complete medium for 2-, 4-, and 8-h chases. Hypoxic treatments began with the chase. Cells were washed twice with cold PBS, lysates were prepared, and immunoprecipitations were performed as described below. Following SDS-PAGE (7.5% gel) of the immunoprecipitates, gels were dried and analyzed using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Labeled bands were quantitated using ImageQuant (Molecular Dynamics). Preparation of whole cell extracts (47Whitelaw M. Pongratz I. Wilhelmsson A. Gustafsson J.A. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2504-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) and nuclear extracts using Nonidet P-40-Ficoll lysis buffer (41Lees M.J. Whitelaw M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5811-5822Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) were performed as previously described. For experiments involving hypoxic treatment, cells were removed from incubation at 37 °C in normoxia or hypoxia, medium was aspirated, and cells were lysed immediately in cell lysis buffer containing 25 μm MG132 (BioMol) to prevent protein degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system and 100 μm 2,2′-dipyridyl (Aldrich) for hypoxic samples only. Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay. Immunoprecipitations with 150–160 μg of lysate using an anti-ARNT polyclonal rabbit serum raised against residues 1–140 of human ARNT (ARNT51) and an anti-Myc 9E10 monoclonal antibody were performed essentially as previously described (48Sogawa K. Nakano R. Kobayashi A. Kikuchi Y. Ohe N. Matsushita N. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1936-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) with minor variation. The binding buffer A contained 150 mm KCl, and lysates were incubated with antibody for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were eluted in 0.5% SDS, 0.05 m β-mercaptoethanol for 5 min at 50 °C, boiled in SDS buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE on a 7.5% gel, and then transferred to nitrocellulose. Whole cell extracts were prepared as described above, with 5–20 μg of whole cell extracts being subjected to SDS-PAGE (7.5% gel) and then transferred to nitrocellulose using a semidry blotter (Hoefer). Proteins were detected with the anti-Myc 9E10 monoclonal antibody, the anti-HA 12CA5 monoclonal antibody, anti-HIF-1α polyclonal serum raised against residues 786–826 of human HIF-1α (HIF55), or anti-ARNT polyclonal serum (ARNT51). Chromatin extracts were prepared from polyclonal 293TSIM2 stable cells (∼2.5 × 107 cells/immunoprecipitation) essentially as previously described with a few alterations (49Orlando V. Strutt H. Paro R. Methods. 1997; 11: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). To solubilize chromatin and shear DNA, six 30-s sonication pulses interspersed with 1-min rest periods were performed on ice using a Sonifier Cell Disruptor (Branson Sonic Power B30). An aliquot of chromatin extract was collected for the input sample, and the remainder was precleared by incubation with Protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Immunoprecipitation overnight at 4 °C followed, with 5 μg of 12CA5 or 9E10 antibodies. Each sample was incubated with 250 μl of a 50% Protein A-Sepharose slurry for 1 h at 4 °C, and the immunocomplexes were subsequently washed six times with 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 0.14 m NaCl, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.02m Tris-HCl, pH 8, three times with 0.5 mlithium chloride, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8, twice with 1 mm EDTA, 0.01 m Tris, pH 8, and eluted twice with 1% SDS, 0.05 m sodium bicarbonate. One-tenth of the eluate was subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western analysis using the 9E10 antibody, and the DNA was purified from the remainder using a previously described protocol (available on the World Wide Web at mcardle.oncology.wisc.edu/ farnham/protocols/). Eluted DNA was resuspended in 30 μl of TE, and 2 μl was added to each PCR using primers designed to amplify the HRE sequences in the reporter plasmid. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from 293T control, 293TSIM1, and 293TSIM2 stable cell lines essentially as previously described (50Wood S.A. Pascoe W.S. Ru K. Yamada T. Hirchenhain J. Kemler R. Mattick J.S. Mech. Dev. 1997; 63: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), except that cells were removed from normoxic or hypoxic incubation, the medium was aspirated, and cells were immediately lysed in cell resuspension buffer with 1% SDS and 200 μg/ml Proteinase K (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) to minimize reoxygenation. 5 μg of each poly(A)+ RNA was analyzed by Northern blot with probes specific to SIM1, SIM2, and β-actin, using Rapid-hyb (Amersham Biosciences) and PhosphorImager visualization. Several mammalian bHLH/PAS proteins are signal regulated and exhibit cytoplasmic to nuclear translocation upon activation. This has been best demonstrated in the case of the DR, which in its latent form is found in the cytoplasm bound with hsp90 and the co-chaperones p23 and XAP2 (for a review, see Ref. 6Gu Y.Z. Hogenesch J.B. Bradfield C.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 519-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). Upon ligand binding, a nuclear localization signal (NLS) within the DR is unmasked, and the complex translocates into the nucleus (41Lees M.J. Whitelaw M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19:"

To date, RXR has only been crystallized in the absence of ligand or with the promiscuous ligand 9-cis retinoic acid, which also activates retinoic acid receptors. Here we present the structure of hRXRβ in complex with the RXR-specific agonist LG100268 (LG268). The structure clearly reveals why LG268 is specific for the RXR ligand binding pocket and will not activate retinoic acid receptors. Intriguingly, in the crystals, the C-terminal “activation” helix (AF-2/helix H12) is trapped in a novel position not seen in other nuclear receptor structures such that it does not cap the ligand binding cavity. Mammalian two-hybrid assays indicate that LG268 is unable to release co-repressors from RXR unless co-activators are also present.

The ability to serve as the preferred heterodimeric partner of many (>10) other receptors makes RXRs unique within the family of nuclear receptors and accounts for their role in many diverse signaling pathways. It is generally held that 9-cis retinoic acid (9cRA) is the natural ligand for RXRs (9.Heyman R.A. Mangelsdorf D.J. Dyck J.A. Stein R.B. Eichele G. Evans R.M. Thaller C.

Rosenberger M. Lovey A. Grippo J.F. Nature. 1992; 355: 359-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar). This is a promiscuous ligand because it also activates retinoic acid receptors (RARs), which themselves serve as heterodimeric partners for RXR. Chemical approaches have led to the development of synthetic agonists that allow RXR to be activated without influencing the activity of RARs (11.Boehm M. Zhang L. Zhi L. McClurg M. Berger E.

It has emerged that RXR-specific agonists such as Targretin® and LG268 may serve as beneficial therapies for the treatment of cancer, diabetes, and other metabolic disorders (13.Gottardis M.M.

LG268 is a substituted stilbene (6-[1-(3,5,5,8–8-pentamethyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydronapthalen-2-yl)-cycloproyl]-nicotinic acid) that specifically binds to and activates RXRs, but not RARs, with a slightly higher affinity than 9cRA (9.Heyman R.A.

Chem. 1995; 38: 3146-3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar).Structural and biochemical studies of a number of nuclear receptor ligand-binding domains (LBDs) have yielded a relatively simple model for the mechanism by which ligands regulate nuclear receptor activity. The LBDs of nuclear receptors share a common, predominantly helical fold (16.Wurtz J.M. Bourguet W. Renaud J.P. Vivat V. Chambon P. Moras D. Gronemeyer H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar, 17.Renaud J.P. Moras D. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1748-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In the absence of ligand, co-repressor proteins bind to the surface of the LBD and prevent the C-terminal helix H12 (AF2-helix) from binding to the surface of the receptor (18.Nagy L. Kao H.Y. Love J.D. Li C. Banayo E. Gooch J.T. Krishna V. Chatterjee K. Evans R.M. Schwabe J.W. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3209-3216Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 19.Perissi V. Staszewski L.M. McInerney E.M. Kurokawa R. Krones A. Rose D.W. Lambert M.H. Milburn M.V. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3198-3208Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 20.Hu X. Lazar M.A. Nature. 1999; 402: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Activating ligands bind in a hydrophobic cavity within the core of the LBD and cause the repositioning of helix H12 such that it seals the ligand binding cavity, resulting in the displacement of co-repressor. In this position, helix H12 forms a critical part of the binding site for co-activator proteins (21.Darimont B. Wagner R. Apriletti J. Stallcup M. Kushner P. Baxter J. Fletterick R. Yamamoto K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3343-3356Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar, 22.Nolte R.T. Wisely G.B. Westin S. Cobb J.E. Lambert M.H. Kurokawa R. Rosenfeld M.G. Willson T.M. Glass C.K. Milburn M.V. Nature. 1998; 395: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar). Significantly, ligands that do not activate nuclear receptors (competitive antagonists) appear to exert their effect by displacing helix H12 from its “active position” so that it occupies the co-activator binding site, the so-called antagonist conformation, and thus prevents co-activator binding (23.Brzozowski A.M. Pike A.C. Dauter Z. Hubbard R.E. Bonn T. Engstrom O. Ohman L. Greene G.L. Gustafsson J.A. Carlquist M. Nature. 1997; 389: 753-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (2916) Google Scholar,24.Shiau A.K. Barstad D. Loria P.M. Cheng L. Kushner P.J. Agard D.A. Greene G.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 927-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2224) Google Scholar). Furthermore ligands that act as partial agonists have been found to cause helix H12 to adopt a similar position to that seen with full antagonists (25.Pike A.C. Brzozowski A.M. Hubbard R.E. Bonn T. Thorsell A.G. Engstrom O. Ljunggren J. Gustafsson J.A. Carlquist M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4608-4618Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar).Here we present the first structure of RXR bound to a selective agonist, LG268. This structure shows clearly why LG268 will bind only to RXR and not to RARs. It also suggests why LG268 has a somewhat higher affinity for RXR than does 9cRA and why it is a more potent agonist. The liganded RXR forms a stable homodimer with the interface very similar to that of the apo-homodimer (26.Bourguet W. Ruff M. Bonnier D. Granger F. Boeglin M. Chambon P. Moras D. Gronemeyer H. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 604-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 27.Gampe Jr., R.T. Montana V.G. Lambert M.H. Wisely G.B. Milburn M.V. Xu H.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2229-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Finally, helix H12 adopts a novel position not seen in other liganded nuclear receptors. Although this position may be favored in the crystal lattice, it suggests that helix H12 is only weakly recruited to the canonical active position on binding ligands. Support for this comes from mammalian two-hybrid experiments showing that, unlike with other receptors, both ligand and co-activator are required to displace co-repressor and hence suggesting that co-activator helps to stabilize the helix in the active conformation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExpression, Purification, and CrystallizationThe ligand-binding domain of hRXRβ (amino acids 296–533) was over-expressed in Escherichia coli (BL21(DE3)) and purified as a stoichiometric heterodimer with hRARβ as described previously (28.Li C. Schwabe J. Banayo E. Evans R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2278-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The pure protein, in a buffer containing 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1.0 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.125% (v/v) Triton X-100, was incubated for 16 h with LG268 and TTNPB at a 1.2 molar excess and subsequently concentrated to 7.4 mg/ml using a Centricon concentrator (Amicon). Ligands dissolved in Me2SO were diluted in the protein solution such that the final Me2SO concentration was <1%.Crystals were grown at 20 °C using the vapor diffusion method. 2-μl drops were equilibrated against 1.4 m ammonium formate, pH 7.6. Irregular plate crystals (∼400 × 300 × 20 μm) formed after 3 months in a bed of precipitate that was found to be denatured hRARβ LBD. Small crystals of the hRXRβ LBD (expressed without the hRARβ LBD) could be grown under similar conditions but without detergent, suggesting that the detergent plays a role in dissociating the heterodimer but not in the crystallization itself. Crystals were harvested using a 400-μm loop mounted on a pin and frozen by being plunged into liquid nitrogen using the reservoir solution supplemented with 25% glycerol as a cryoprotectant. Analysis of the crystals suggested that the hRXRβ LBD had not been proteolyzed during crystallization.Structure Solution and RefinementX-ray diffraction data were collected at 100 K using a refrigerated nitrogen gas delivery system at beamline ID14–2 ESRF (Grenoble, France) on an area detector systems Quantum-4 CCD. Data were processed using Mosflm (29.Leslie, A. G. W. (1992) @@[email protected]@CCP4 and ESF-EACMB Newsletter on Protein Crystallography,@@/[email protected]@ No. 26, Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UKGoogle Scholar) and further using the CCP4 package (30.CCP4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19704) Google Scholar). The best crystals diffracted beyond 2.5 Å with useful data to 2.7 Å. Data processing statistics are shown in Table I. The structure was solved by molecular replacement with a search model comprising a dimer, the apo-RXRα LBD (amino acids 225–431) lacking the C-terminal structural elements helices H11 and H12. Clear rotation and translation function solutions were obtained using CNS (15–4 Å) (31.Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M.

The initial R-factor following rigid body refinement was 46.9%. The sigma-a weighted 2Fo − Fc map was substantially improved using NCS averaging and solvent flipping implemented in CNS. Strict NCS restraints were imposed followed by four rounds of rebuilding and refinement in O (32.Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13004) Google Scholar) and CNS, respectively.

Open table in a new tab Transient Transfection ExperimentsMammalian expression vectors used in this work have been described previously (18.Nagy L. Kao H.Y. Love J.D. Li C. Banayo E. Gooch J.T. Krishna V. Chatterjee K. Evans R.M. Schwabe J.W. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3209-3216Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) with the exception of the ACTR vector, which was based on the pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen) and contained the receptor interaction domain (amino acids 621–821) with an N-terminal nuclear localization signal from SV40. CV1 cells were transiently transfected as described previously (18.Nagy L. Kao H.Y. Love J.D. Li C. Banayo E. Gooch J.T. Krishna V. Chatterjee K. Evans R.M. Schwabe J.W. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3209-3216Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity for each sample was normalized with reference to the level of β-galactosidase activity of a control reporter construct. Each transfection was carried out in triplicate at least three times.RESULTSStructure DeterminationhRXRβ:LG268 crystallized in space group C2 with two LBD dimers in the asymmetric unit. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using a truncated version of the apo-hRXRα dimer as the search model (33.Bourguet W. Ruff M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 375: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). The structure of the apo-hRXRα was chosen as a starting model because it is the only available RXR homodimer structure and it would serve as an unbiased model from which to interpret the structural changes on binding ligand. An excellent electron density map was obtained by averaging according to the 4-fold noncrystallographic symmetry. The map showed clear electron density for the majority of the hRXRβ LBD and the bound ligand, LG268. However the extreme N and C termini of the LBD could not be assigned in the electron density map nor could an internal loop between helices H1 and H3 (amino acids 312–334).Crystal PackingThe hRXRβ LBDs are packed in the crystal lattice as octamers (two asymmetric units) with each monomer making extensive contacts to two other LBDs (Fig. 1a). One of these two interfaces is clearly the biologically relevant homodimerization interface (marked HDI) with a buried surface of 2250 Å2. The other interface, which buries 1660 Å2, arises as part of the crystal packing (marked CPI). Additional electron density seen at this second interface could not be attributed to protein and is most likely either a partially ordered detergent molecule or an additional molecule of the ligand. Because of this ambiguity, no model was fitted to this density or included in the refinement.Adjacent octamers pack together in the crystal lattice with a tightly bound metal ion at the interface (shown as gray spheres, Fig. 1a). This ion, chelated by His-402 and His-404 in one monomer and by Asp-390 in another, was assigned as a Ni2+ ion that was presumably retained during the purification on the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin. There is clearly additional density for a fourth ligand for the Ni2+, which was tentatively modeled as a chloride ion.Overall StructureThe hRXRβ:LG268 structure has an overall architecture similar to that of LBDs from other members of the nuclear receptor family (16.Wurtz J.M. Bourguet W. Renaud J.P. Vivat V. Chambon P. Moras D. Gronemeyer H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). To facilitate comparison with other structures, we used a secondary structure numbering scheme based on the original apo-hRXRα structure (33.Bourguet W. Ruff M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D.

Helices H1 and H3 comprise one outer layer (joined by a disordered loop). The central layer comprising helices H4, H5, H8, and H9 is incomplete, leaving a cavity that accommodates bound ligand. The final layer comprises helices H7, H9, and H10/H11 and forms the homodimer interface between the two LBD monomers. The position of helix H12 in the hRXRβ:LG268 complex differs from that seen in previous RXR structures (Fig. 1, c–e). The significance of this difference is discussed further below.Ligand BindingThe initial electron density map, averaged according to the noncrystallographic symmetry, showed unambiguous density for the LG268 ligand (Fig. 2a). It is enclosed in a largely hydrophobic cavity (568 Å3) bounded by helices H3, H5, H7, and H11 and a β-sheet. The ligand (355 Å3) occupies 63% of the cavity, making extensive contacts with the protein (Fig. 2b). The majority of contacts are nonpolar van der Waals interactions. However, the carboxylate of the nicotinic acid group forms a salt bridge with Arg-387 and accepts hydrogen bonds from the backbone amide of Ala-342 and an ordered water molecule. Ile-339, Leu-380, and Phe-384 contact the piperidine ring, and the cyclopropyl group is in close contact with Trp-376, Asn-377, and Ile-381. Significantly there is no hydrogen bonding partner for the nitrogen in the piperidine ring, and therefore the rotational orientation of the ring could not be assigned.Figure 2Contacts to LG268 and comparison with hRXRα: 9cRA. a, the ligand binding pocket of hRXRβ:LG268.

The methyl on the unsaturated ring of the naphthalene makes van der Waals contacts to Cys-340, Ala-343, and Leu-507 and protrudes out from the ligand binding cavity toward the canonical position of helix H12. Comparison with other liganded RXR structures suggests that the methyl would be in close van der Waals contact with Leu-522 in helix H12 if it were in the canonical agonist position.Comparison with hRXRα Bound to 9cRALG268 binds to all three RXR isoforms with a dissociation constant of ∼3 nm(11.Boehm M. Zhang L. Zhi L. McClurg M. Berger E. Wagoner M. Mais D. Suto C. Davies J. Heyman R. Nadzan A.M. J. Med. Chem. 1995; 38: 3146-3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar); this contrasts with the somewhat weaker dissociation constant of 9cRA (9–12 nm for hRXRα) (9.Heyman R.A. Mangelsdorf D.J.

Huselton C. Allenby G. Speck J. Kratzeisen C. Rosenberger M. Lovey A. Grippo J.F. Nature. 1992; 355: 359-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar). Notably, LG268 also gives 50% maximal activation at a concentration at least 10-fold lower than 9cRA (34.Peet D.J. Doyle D.F. Corey D.R. Mangelsdorf D.J. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: 13-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).The general pattern of the contacts between RXRβ and LG268 is very similar to that seen in the RXRα:9cRA structure. The similarity extends to the presence of an ordered water molecule in the ligand cavity and is unsurprising because both ligands are in van der Waals contacts with all of the side chains exposed in the interior of the ligand binding cavity (Fig. 2b). The only differences involve side chain rearrangements to accommodate the different shape of LG268. The most significant rearrangements are those of residues Cys-503, Phe-510, and Arg-387 (Fig. 2c). Notably, the orientation of Cys-503 seen in the hRXRα:9cRA structure is incompatible with LG268 binding, as it would result in a severe steric clash. Rotation about the Cα–Cβ bond allows the Cys-503 to accommodate LG268 binding, but in this new position it would clash with 9cRA. The movement of Cys-503 also requires the further rearrangement of the side chain of Ile-416.Structural Basis for the Specificity of LG268In contrast to the promiscuous properties of 9cRA, which also activates retinoic acid receptors (RARs), LG268 is highly specific for RXRs (the Kd for RARs is >1000 nm (11.Boehm M. Zhang L. Zhi L. McClurg M. Berger E. Wagoner M. Mais D. Suto C. Davies J. Heyman R. Nadzan A.M. J. Med. Chem. 1995; 38: 3146-3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar)). This raises the question as to why, unlike 9cRA, LG268 is unable to bind to and activate RARs. Fig. 3 shows a comparison of the hRARγ and hRXRβ ligand binding pockets. Superposition of the RXRβ and RARγ structures on helices H5 and H11 provides the most instructive comparison of the two structures. It is clear that the paths of helix H3, the β-sheet, as well as helices H6 and H7 adopt significantly different conformations relative to helices H5 and H11 and the rest of the structure (Fig. 3, a and b). These differences in secondary structure positioning, along with different side chain identities, result in a differently shaped ligand binding pocket (Fig. 3, c and d). In particular the side chains of residues Leu-268, Met-272, Phe-288, Phe-304, Gly-393, Arg-396, and Ala-397 in hRARγ combine to create a relatively linear cavity suited to accommodate the extended conformation of all-trans retinoic acid (atRA). The corresponding residues in hRXRβ (Asn-377, Ile-381, Leu-397, Val-413, Cys-503, His-506, and Leu-507) create a more globular cavity suited to accommodate a shorter “bent” ligand such as LG268 or 9cRA. Interestingly the side chain of Arg-387 is able to adjust its position so as to reach ∼2 Å further into the ligand binding cavity to form a salt bridge with the carboxylate of LG268. These observations support the previous suggestion that it is the ability of 9cRA to flex that allows it to bind to both RARs and RXRs (35.Kersten S. Dawson M. Lewis B. Noy N. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3816-3824Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The fact that LG268 is fixed in a bent conformation by the tetrahedral geometry around the cyclopropyl group means that it is unable to adopt the linear conformation needed to bind hRARγ and would therefore clash with the side chains of residues Phe-288, Phe-304, and Met-272. Similarly, atRA is fixed in a linear conformation and could not adapt to the shorter ligand binding cavity of RXR.Figure 3Comparison with hRARγ: atRA. a, differences between hRXRβ:LG268 (green) and hRARγ:atRA (blue) (47.Renaud J.P.

The homodimerization interface is essentially identical to that observed in the apo-hRXRα dimer interface (27.Gampe Jr., R.T. Montana V.G. Lambert M.H. Wisely G.B. Milburn M.V. Xu H.E.

Nature. 1995; 375: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). In previous crystals of liganded RXRs, the LBD was found to be either monomeric or bound as a heterodimer to a partner receptor (36.Bourguet W. Vivat V. Wurtz J.M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2592-2601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the apo-hRXRα was found to be a dimer or tetramer, it has been suggested that ligand binding favors dissociation of RXR oligomers and the formation of monomers or heterodimers (38.Egea P.F. Mitschler A. Rochel N. Ruff M. Chambon P. Moras D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2592-2601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39.Chen Z.P. Iyer J. Bourguet W. Held P. Mioskowski C. Lebeau L. Noy N. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, a comparison with the hRXRα:9cRA structure suggests no obvious reason why it should be monomeric, whereas hRXRβ:LG268 (and indeed the apo-hRXRα) is a homodimer. It is therefore unclear how ligand binding might favor dissociation of the homodimer, and it seems likely that the hRXRα:9cRA crystal lattice favors the monomer.A novel Position for Helix H12As mentioned above, helix H12 adopts an unexpected orientation in the structure of hRXRβ bound to LG268. It is positioned such that it is folded under the ligand-binding domain and makes no contacts to the main body of the protein (Fig. 1b). Residues beyond Leu-522 are rather disordered. Because LG268 is a strongly activating ligand, we expected helix H12 to adopt the canonical active position. Accordingly, we examined the packing in the crystal lattice to determine whether it was compatible with t"

We have investigated the interaction between ICAM-3 and ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) proteins and its role in LFA-1-induced cell-cell interactions and membrane positioning of ICAM-3 in polarized migrating lymphocytes. Protein-protein binding assays demonstrated a phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-induced association between ICAM-3 and the amino-terminal domain of ERM proteins. This interaction was not essential for the binding of ICAM-3 to LFA-1. Dynamic fluorescence videomicroscopy studies of cells demonstrated that moesin and ICAM-3 coordinately redistribute on the plasma membrane during lymphocyte migration. Furthermore, overexpression of the amino-terminal domain of moesin, which lacks the consensus moesin actin-binding site, caused the subcellular mislocalization of ICAM-3. A CD4 chimerical protein containing the cytoplasmic tail of ICAM-3 was targeted to the trailing edge. Point mutation of Ser487, Ser489, and Ser496 to alanine in the juxtamembrane region of ICAM-3 significantly impaired both ERM binding and polarization of ICAM-3. ERM-directed polarization of ICAM-3 was also impaired by phosphorylation-like mutation of Ser487 and Ser489, but not of Ser496.

PIP2 was purchased from Sigma. For ICAM-3 expression, the ICAM-3 cDNA was subcloned from pCDM8 to PCR3 vector (Invitrogen) as a NotI/HindIII fragment.

The following primers were utilized: D4, sense orientation of the distal region of CD4; R4Q3I (CGCTCCGTTGGTGCTCCCTGAAGAAGATGCCTAGCCCAATGAAAAGC), antisense corresponding to the distal transmembrane domain of CD4 with a region of homology to the cytoplasmic domain of ICAM-3; D4Q3I, sense copy of R4Q3I; R3I (GGGTTTGAAGGCTTTATTGG), antisense to the distal cytoplasmic tail of ICAM-3. Primers D4 and R4Q3I were used to expand the CD4 fragment, whereas primers D4Q3I were used to amplify the ICAM-3 fragment. The PCR products were purified and mixed with primers D4 and R3I in a second PCR. All PCR products were cloned into pCDNA3.1 vector. Sequence analysis confirmed identity and orientation of all DNA constructs.

After electroporation burst, NS1 cells were transferred to coverslips in flat-bottomed 24-well plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA) in a final volume of 1 ml of complete medium + 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma). 24 h after transfection, cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at room temperature and rinsed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.6. For cell adhesion, mock-, ICAM-3WT-, or ICAM-3-transfected K562 cells were labeled in complete medium with the fluorescent dye BCECF-AM (Molecular Probes) and added in RPMI medium containing 1% FCS, 2 mmMgCl, and 2 mm CagCl2 to 96-well microtiter plates (Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA) coated with parental or LFA-1-transfected l-cells (1 × 105/well) that were grown overnight at 37 °C. After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, unbound cells were removed by three washes and with RPMI medium, and adhered cells were quantified using a fluorescence analyzer (CytoFluor 2300, Millipore Co.). Heterotypic aggregation between LFA-1-transfected and ICAM-3-transfected K562 cells was performed as previously described (20Campanero M.R. del Pozo M.A. Arroyo A.G. Sánchez-Mateos P. Hernandez-Caselles T. Craig A. Pulido R. Sánchez-Madrid F. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1007-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). LFA-1-transfected and ICAM-3-transfected K562 cells (2 × 105/well) were mixed and incubated in flat-bottomed, 24-well plates (Costar Corp.) on coverslips coated with FN80 at 10 μg/ml. Culture supernatant of the activating anti-LFA-1 NKI-L16 mAb was added and cells were incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 atmosphere for 30 min. Cell conjugates were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at room temperature and rinsed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl. To directly visualize the LFA-1 molecule, cells were stained with 1:300 dilution of Alexa 488-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). To stain moesin, fixed cell conjugates were incubated with the affinity-purified rabbit anti-moesin 95/2 pAb followed by labeling with 1:400 dilution of cross-adsorbed rhodamine X goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes). ICAM-3 was visualized by incubating fixed cell conjugates with the biotinylated anti-ICAM-3 TP1/24, and co-staining with LFA-1 and moesin was carried out using rhodamine X- or Alexa 488-streptavidin (Molecular Probes), respectively. For double immunofluorescence of ICAM-3 and LFA-1, an additional step with saturating amounts of normal mouse serum was carried out prior to the addition of biotinylated anti-ICAM-3 mAb. 24 h after transfection, NS1 cells were allowed to adhere on FN-80-coated glass coverslips for 30 min, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at room temperature, rinsed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.6, and visualized by staining the cells with the anti-ICAM-3 TP1/24 mAb plus a 1:50 dilution of an FITC-labeled goat F(ab′)2 anti-mouse Ig (Dako). Cells were observed using a Leica DMR photomicroscope (Leica, Heidelberg, Germany) with 40, 63, and 100× oil immersion objectives. Images were acquired using the Leica QFISH 1.0 software. The proportion of ICAM-3-redistributed cells was calculated by random choice of 10 different fields (60× objective) of each condition and counting of at least 700 cells. Flow cytometry analysis of transfected K562 cells was performed as previously described (9Serrador J.M. Alonso-Lebrero J.L. del Pozo M.A. Furthmayr H. Schwartz-Albiez R. Calvo J. Lozano F. Sánchez-Madrid F. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1409-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Fluorescence histograms are represented in a logarithmic scale. 36 h after transfection, NS1 cells were adhered to FN-80-coated glass coverslips and coverslips were mounted on Attofluor open chambers (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and placed on the microscope stage. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere using an incubation system (La-con (GBr) Pe-con (GmbH)). A foil cover (La-con (GBr) Pe-con (GmbH)) was placed on top of the chamber, to prevent liquid evaporation without affecting CO2 diffusion. Confocal images were acquired using a Leica TCS-SP confocal laser scanning unit equipped with an argon and a helium/neon laser and attached to a Leica DMIRBE inverted epifluorescence microscope; fluorescence and differential interference contrast (DIC) images of migrating cells were obtained simultaneously at 1 min intervals. Optical sectioning of cells was necessary to capture all the fluorescent signal. This was accomplished using four exposures at 1-μm intervals throughout the cell. A section of the middle fluorescent images is presented with its corresponding DIC image, which provides information about the morphology of the cell. Cells transfected with either ICAM-3-RFP or moesin-GFP alone were observed to set the conditions of the acquisition of images to avoid signal cross-talk. Transfected K562 cells (1 × 107) were labeled overnight with a mixture of [35S]methionine/cysteine (200 μCi) in methionine/cysteine-free RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS.35S-Labeled cells were processed for immunoprecipitation. Western blot analysis of unlabeled proteins was carried out as described (9Serrador J.M. Alonso-Lebrero J.L. del Pozo M.A. Furthmayr H. Schwartz-Albiez R. Calvo J. Lozano F. Sánchez-Madrid F. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1409-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Construction of the GST fusion protein with the cytoplasmic regions of human ICAM-3 has been reported elsewhere (9Serrador J.M. Alonso-Lebrero J.L. del Pozo M.A. Furthmayr H. Schwartz-Albiez R. Calvo J. Lozano F. Sánchez-Madrid F. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1409-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Constructs coding for deletion and point mutation cytoplasmic variants of both proteins were performed by oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis either by overlap extension or site-directed mutagenesis. Recombinant full-length moesin, full-length ezrin, and their respective NH2-terminal regions containing amino acid residues 1–310 were expressed in Escherichia coli, isolated, and purified as GST fusion proteins (24Huang L. Won T. Lin R. Furthmayr H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12803-12810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Recombinant moesin and ezrin were assayed for binding activity to ICAM-3 incubating 2 μg of these proteins with ∼10 μg of GST-ICAM-3 mutants linked up glutathione-Sepharose beads, in 0.8 ml of binding buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 0.2% Triton X-100) at 4 °C for 1.5 h. Beads were washed six times in binding buffer. GST fusion proteins and their associated proteins were eluted from glutathione-Sepharose beads using 50 mm Tris buffer containing 20 mm glutathione. Moesin binding assays to ICAM-3 in the presence of PIP2were carried out preincubating recombinant full-length moesin with liposomes of PIP2 at 50 μg/ml in 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 130 mm KCl and 0.2 mm EGTA. Bound moesin and ezrin were determined by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using moesin 95/2 or ezrin 90/3 pAbs. The pCR3 plasmids carrying the inserts of untagged moesin and ezrin amino-terminal regions containing amino acid residues 1–310 (MSNn/pCR3 and EZR/pCR3, respectively) were described previously (24Huang L. Won T. Lin R. Furthmayr H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12803-12810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The plasmids were transcribed and translated in vitro using a TNT-coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI) in the presence of T7 RNA polymerase andl-[35S]methionine, and binding assays carried out as previously described (24Huang L. Won T. Lin R. Furthmayr H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12803-12810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Wild type ICAM-3 (ICAM-3WT) and an ICAM-3 protein lacking the cytoplasmic domain by truncation at Arg 482 (ICAM3Δ) were stably expressed in K562 cells, which as determined by flow cytometry show ICAM-1, but negligible amounts of ICAM-3 and LFA-1 (Fig. 1,A and B). Similar levels of ICAM-3WT and ICAM-3Δ were expressed by K562 transfectants (Fig. 1 B,b and c). As expected, the molecular mass of ICAM-3WT was ∼120 kDa, whereas ICAM-3Δ was somewhat lower (Fig.1 C, a). Moesin and ezrin co-precipitated with ICAM-3WT but not with ICAM-3Δ (Fig. 1 C, b andc). Neither moesin nor ezrin was detected in precipitates from mock K562 cells. To study the role of the interaction of ICAM-3 with moesin in the binding of ICAM-3 to LFA-1, we analyzed the adhesion of ICAM-3WT and ICAM-3Δ K562 cells to mouse l-cells stably transfected with recombinant human LFA-1; these cells reacted strongly with anti-LFA-1 mAb, whereas parental l-cell did not (Fig.1 D, a, and data not shown). In this assay, ICAM-3WT and ICAM-3Δ K562 cells bound to LFA-1-l-cells similarly to mock K562 cells, because parental and transfected K562 cells significantly express ICAM-1 (Fig. 1 B, a, and data not shown). The adhesion of mock, ICAM-3WT, and ICAM-3Δ K562 cells to LFA-1-L cells was blocked by anti-LFA-1 TS1/11 mAb, whereas anti-ICAM-1 RR1.1 mAb solely blocked the adhesion of mock cells and partly reduced the binding of ICAM-3WT and ICAM-3Δ K562 cells (Fig.1 E). In contrast, anti-ICAM-3 140.11 mAb significantly reduced the adhesion of ICAM-3WT and ICAM-3Δ cells, without affecting the adhesion of mock cells (Fig. 1 E). Interestingly, the combination of anti-ICAM-1 and anti-ICAM-3 mAb blocked the adhesion of all transfectants to LFA-1-L cells, whereas the anti-CD45 D3/9 mAb control had no effect (Fig. 1 E). To confirm that the interaction of ICAM-3 with moesin was not required for the binding of ICAM-3 to LFA-1, the localization of moesin in ICAM-3/LFA-1 cell-cell contacts was studied by two-color immunofluorescence staining. K562 cells stably transfected with LFA-1 (Fig. 1 D, b) were conjugated with ICAM-3WT or ICAM-3Δ K562 cells. Because LFA-1 is inactive in LFA-1-transfected K562 cells (25Nueda A. López-Rodrı́guez C. Rubio M.A. Sotillos M. Postigo A. del Pozo M.A. Vega M.A. Corbi A. Cell. Immunol. 1995; 164: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), the heterotypic intercellular adhesion of transfectants was triggered using the activating anti-LFA-1 mAb NKI-L16, which induces the high affinity state on LFA-1 (26van DeWiel-van Kemenade P. van Kooyk Y. de Boer A.J. Huijbens R.J.F. Weder P. van de Kasteele W. Melief C.J.M. Figdor C.G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 461-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). LFA-1/ICAM-3WT and LFA-1/ICAM-3Δ cell conjugates showed that both ICAM-3WT and ICAM-3Δ molecules localized with LFA-1 at the cell-cell contacts (Fig. 1 F, a and b, respectively), whereas moesin co-localized with ICAM-3WT (Fig.1 F, c) but not with ICAM-3Δ (Fig.1 F, d) at these subcellular regions. Similar results were obtained with ezrin (data not shown). Together, these results indicate that the cytoplasmic domain of ICAM-3; therefore, its interaction with ERM proteins, is not absolutely required to induce cell adhesion by binding to its counter-receptor LFA-1. To determine whether recombinant moesin or ezrin interacted directly with the cytoplasmic domain of ICAM-3, an in vitro protein binding assay was carried out. Recombinant full-length moesin, ezrin, and their amino-terminal domain fragments were affinity-purified (Fig.2 A). When added to Sepharose beads containing the cytoplasmic region of ICAM-3 fused to GST protein (GST-Cy3WT) or control GST, neither full-length moesin nor ezrin bound ICAM-3 (Fig. 2 B, and data not shown). In contrast, strong binding was detected with the NH2-terminal domain of both moesin and ezrin (Fig. 2, C and D). To ascertain whether ICAM-3 binds to moesin in the presence of PIP2, GST-Cy3WT was added to PIP2 vesicles preincubated with full-length moesin. Interestingly, ICAM-3 associated with moesin in a PIP2-dependent manner (Fig. 2 E). To assess whether the binding between ICAM-3 and N-moesin is consistent with a direct interaction of the two proteins in cells as well, N-moesin-GFP and the two constructs for expression of full-length moesin fusion proteins, GFP-moesin and moesin-GFP, were expressed in HSB-2 T cells. GFP-moesin showed a cytoplasmic pattern, as has been observed previously in NIH3T3 cells (23Amieva M.R. Litman P. Huang L. Ichimaru E. Furthmayr H. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 111-125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this fusion protein, GFP is linked to the NH2 terminus of full-length moesin and this prevents binding to membrane sites. This fusion protein did not affect the localization of ICAM-3 (Fig.3, a and b). On the other hand, moesin-GFP co-localized with endogenous ICAM-3 at the uropod, as shown in Fig. 3 (c and d), and this localization is identical to that of the endogenous moesin (data not shown). In contrast, when N-moesin-GFP was highly expressed in these cells, ICAM-3 was not concentrated in the uropod and remained evenly distributed throughout the plasma membrane (Fig. 3, e andf). Motile NS1 myeloma cells showed the characteristic “hand mirror” shape of polarized cells (Fig.4 A, a). Two poles were distinguished in these cells, a leading edge, enriched in β-actin, and the uropod, where α-tubulin, moesin, and carboxyl-terminal phosphorylated ERM proteins are concentrated (Fig.4 A, b, c, and d). To examine the subcellular distribution of activated endogenous ERM proteins, we stained NS1 cells with rat 297S mAb, which recognizes carboxyl-terminal phosphorylated ERM proteins (27Hayashi K. Yonemura S. Matsui T. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1149-1158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activated ERM proteins were found polarized at the uropod area (Fig. 4 A,e and f). To assess the role of ICAM-3/moesin interaction in the redistribution of ICAM-3 to the uropod of polarized migrating lymphocytes, we first examined the membrane localization of ICAM-3WT and ICAM-3Δ in transiently transfected mouse NS1 cells. Although wild type and ICAM-3 truncated proteins were expressed on the plasma membrane, solely ICAM-3WT was concentrated at the cellular uropod (Fig. 4 A, g and h). In contrast, ICAM-3Δ was evenly distributed on cell membrane (Fig.4 A, i and j). No expression of endogenous ICAM-3 was detected in mock-transfected NS1 cells (data not shown). To assess whether the cytoplasmic domain of ICAM-3 is sufficient to target other transmembrane proteins to the cellular uropod, the cytoplasmic domain of CD4 was replaced by that of ICAM-3. CD4 was uniformly distributed on the plasma membrane of both migrating polarized T lymphoblasts and NS1 cells transfected with either wild type CD4 or a CD4 truncated form lacking the cytoplasmic tail (CD4Δ) (Fig. 4 B). Interestingly, the chimerical CD4 protein containing the cytoplasmic tail of ICAM-3 was redistributed to the uropod (Fig. 4 B). To study the role of moesin in the redistribution of ICAM-3 during cell motility, we used COOH-terminal fusions of full-length moesin with green fluorescent protein (moesin-GFP) and ICAM-3 with red fluorescent protein (ICAM-3-RFP). The two fusion proteins were co-expressed and their distribution recorded by time lapse fluorescence videomicroscopy in live and moving NS1 cells. Initially, moesin-GFP (green) and ICAM-3-RFP (red) accumulated in the cellular uropod of such migrating cells as described above (Fig.5 a). The polarity of NS1 cells often reversed spontaneously when cells moved on substratum. When such cells were analyzed, both proteins changed their distribution within minutes to a more diffuse localization (Fig. 5, b andc); finally, both were concentrated again in a newly formed cellular uropod (Fig. 5, e and f). The changes in distribution continue with every ch"

We investigated roles of the promoter regions and DNA-protein interactions in fruit-specific expression of the cucumisin gene. In transient expression analysis, a chimeric gene construct containing a 1.2-kb cucumisin promoter fused to a β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene was expressed in fruit tissues at high levels, but the promoter activities in leaves and stems were very low. Deletion analysis indicated that a positive regulatory region is located between nucleotides −234 and −214 relative to the transcriptional initiation site. Gain-of-function experiments revealed that this 20-bp sequence conferred fruit specificity and contained a regulatory enhancer. Gel mobility shift experiments demonstrated the presence of fruit nuclear factors that interact with the cucumisin promoter. A typical G-box (GACACGTGTC) present in the 20-bp sequence did not bind fruit protein, but two possible cis-elements, an I-box-like sequence (AGATATGATAAAA) and an odd base palindromic TGTCACA motif, were identified in the promoter region between positions −254 and −215. The I-box-like sequence bound more tightly to fruit nuclear protein than the TGTCACA motif. The I-box-like sequence functions as a negative regulatory element, and the TGTCACA motif is a novel enhancer element necessary for fruit-specific expression of the cucumisin gene. Specific nucleotides responsible for the binding of fruit nuclear protein in these two elements were also determined. Cucumisin, a subtilisin-like serine protease, is expressed at high levels in the fruit of melon (Cucumis melo L.) and accumulates in the juice. We investigated roles of the promoter regions and DNA-protein interactions in fruit-specific expression of the cucumisin gene.

The I-box-like sequence functions as a negative regulatory element, and the TGTCACA motif is a novel enhancer element necessary for fruit-specific expression of the cucumisin gene. Specific nucleotides responsible for the binding of fruit nuclear protein in these two elements were also determined. Timing and levels of gene expression are critical to the proper development of eukaryotic organisms. Regulation of the expression pattern of a particular gene can involve the specific binding of trans-acting factors to the cognate cis-elements, constituting a crucial step in transcriptional initiation and, in turn, on the spatial and temporal expression of genes. Plant genes that show tissue specificity, developmental specificity, and a wide range of expression levels have been characterized, whereas their expression patterns are also influenced by environmental stimuli. A family of genes for fruit proteins provide a model system for the study of the regulatory mechanisms of plant genes, since their expression is restricted to a specific tissue and stage during fruit development (1.Giovannoni J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 52: 725-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). A number of fruit-specific genes that are activated during ripening have been isolated from tomato and other fruits, and genes responding to ethylene and nonethylene signals have been identified (1.Giovannoni J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 52: 725-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar, 2.Lelièvre J.-M. Latché A. Jones B. Bouzayen M. Pech J.-C. Physiol. Plant. 1997; 101: 727-739Crossref Google Scholar). The promoters of fruit-specific genes would also be of great interest for use in strategies to manipulate fruit metabolism and produce valuable proteins such as antibody, biopharmaceuticals, and edible vaccines through methods of genetic engineering (3.Gray J. Picton S. Shabbeer J. Schuch W. Grierson D. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 19: 69-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 4.Ruf S. Hermann M. Berger I.J. Carrer H. Bock R. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 870-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 5.Daniell H. Streatfield S.J. Wycoff K. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 219-226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). However, the detailed mechanisms by which the expression of fruit protein genes are regulated are poorly understood, as many of the essential cis-elements have not been identified. Melon cucumisin, an extracellular subtilisin-like serine protease, is expressed at high levels in fruit, where it comprises more than 10% of the total protein (6.Yamagata H. Ueno S. Iwasaki T. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1989; 53: 1009-1017Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). No expression is detected in other parts of the melon plant. The accumulation of a large amount of the cucumisin protein in juice in the central parts of the fruit at a specific stage during fruit development and the single copy character of the corresponding gene suggest that the cucumisin gene contains a strong promoter, which also controls the fruit-specific expression of cucumisin (7.Yamagata H. Masuzawa T. Nagaoka Y Ohnishi T. Iwasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32725-32731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cucumisin gene is also characterized by its conspicuous expression pattern in specific tissues such as the placenta, locule, and peripheral tissues around seeds in the fruit and early during fruit development. These specific temporal and spatial expression patterns of the cucumisin promoter may be explained as the result of regulatory assemblies of several transcriptional activators that recognize the cis-elements implicated in fruit-specific expression. The cucumisinpromoter may also be useful for genetic engineering of fruit. To understand the mechanisms of fruit-specific gene expression and for the design and application of fruit-specific promoters for the improvement of fruit quality by genetic engineering, detailed analyses of the cucumisin promoter and the transcription factors are required. Here, we describe cloning of the cucumisin promoter and experiments designed to define cis-acting elements involved in proper expression of the gene. A stretch of only 20 bp of the promoter sequence is required for the promoter activity in young fruit. Musk melons (Cucumis melo L. var. reticulatus cv. Teresa) were cultivated in a greenhouse at the experimental farm attached to the Faculty of Agriculture, Kobe University, from March to August. Fruits were tagged upon self-pollination, and developing fruits were harvested on the 10th day after pollination (DAP). 1The abbreviations used are: DAPday after pollinationGUSβ-glucuronidaseLUCluciferasePIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acidGBFG-box binding factor For the analysis of transient gene expression, developing fruits, leaves, and stems were used immediately after harvest. The central parts of the fruit were separated from the sarcocarp and testae and used for isolation of nuclear proteins, or frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until use for poly(A)+ RNA isolation. day after pollination β-glucuronidase luciferase 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid G-box binding factor Restriction and modification enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs Inc., Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and Promega. Megaprime DNA labeling kits, Hybond-N nylon membranes, [γ-32P]ATP, [α-32P]dCTP, [α-32P]dATP, and [α-32P]dTTP were obtained from Amersham Biosciences, Inc. Specific activities of all radioactive nucleotides were 110 TBq/mmol. All other commonly available reagents were of analytical grade. Melon genomic DNA was prepared from 10 g of young leaves using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide according to the method of Rogers and Bendich (8.Rogers S.O. Bendich A.J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1986; 5: 69-76Crossref Scopus (1519) Google Scholar) as described previously (7.Yamagata H. Masuzawa T. Nagaoka Y Ohnishi T. Iwasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32725-32731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the DNA sequence of the 5′ portion of the exon/intron region of the cucumisin gene, the genomic DNA (1 μg) was used as a template for PCR using a forward primer (HD3, CTTCAAGCTTTTCTTTTTTAGT) and a reverse primer (SC1, ATATGATCGAGCTCCAATAA) that were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems 380A oligonucleotide synthesizer (Foster City, CA) based on the sequence of cucumisin cDNA (7.Yamagata H. Masuzawa T. Nagaoka Y Ohnishi T. Iwasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32725-32731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PCR conditions were 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1.5 min at 55 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C. The amplified fragment (1.8 kb) was digested with SacI and HindIII, inserted into pBluescript II SK− (subclone name pH-S1), and sequenced on both strands using a Sequenase version 2.0 sequencing kit (U.S. Biochemical Corp.) as described in the manufacturer's instruction manual. The promoter region of the cucumisin gene was amplified by inverse PCR as described by Ochman et al. (9.Ochman H. Gerber A.S. Hartl D.L. Genetics. 1988; 120: 621-625Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The genomic DNA (1 μg) was digested with AccI, and the DNA fragments were self-ligated with 10 units of T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs). This circularized DNA was used as a template for inverse PCR using the forward primer HD3 and a reverse primer (M1, AGAAGACATAGTAGTGCTTTTTGCTATCAG). The amplified fragment (0.6 kb) was subcloned into the TA cloning vector (subclone pTA Acc3) prepared from SmaI-digested pBluescript II SK− by incubation with Amplitaq DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems Ltd.) and 10 mm dTTP at 70 °C for 2 h. Alternatively, the genomic DNA was digested with BamHI and BglII to make the same cohesive ends and circularized, and then inverse PCR was carried out using a forward primer (B2, TGTATACATGGGGAGGAAGCT) and the reverse primer M1. The amplified fragment (1.8 kb) was subcloned into the TA cloning vector (subclone pM1-B2-5) and sequenced. An additional PCR was carried out using the genomic DNA as a template and a forward primer (T3A, CTTAGTGTACTATATCCTTT) and a reverse primer (Z, AAGCGAGTCGATTACTGAAG) to obtain the DNA fragment overlapping pH-S1 and pM1-B2-5, and the amplified fragment (0.4 kb) was digested, subcloned into pBluescript II SK− (subclone pUK2), and sequenced. Sequence analyses were carried out using the Genetyx program (Software Development Co., Ltd., Tokyo). Primer extension analysis was carried out as described by Sambrook et al. (10.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. 1. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.73-7.83Google Scholar). The synthetic oligonucleotide Ex (5′-TAGAAGCGAGTCGATTACTGAAGAAAAGACT-3′) was 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and then used as a primer for a reverse transcriptase reaction with poly(A)+ RNA prepared from immature melon fruit (∼10 DAP) as described previously (7.Yamagata H. Masuzawa T. Nagaoka Y Ohnishi T. Iwasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32725-32731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The extended product was compared with the sequence ladder obtained from the pUK2 primed with the same synthetic oligonucleotide (Ex). Immature melon fruits (∼10 DAP) cut horizontally into slices (2-mm thickness), young leaves, and stems were put into Petri dishes. Each sample was bombarded twice with gold particles (1.6 μm in diameter) coated with plasmids. In all experiments, we cobombarded the samples with two kinds of plasmid, cucumisin promoter fused to β-glucuronidase (uidA; Ref. 11.Jefferson R.A. Kavanaugh T.A. Bevan M.W. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3901-3907Crossref PubMed Scopus (8126) Google Scholar) (denoted as GUS) and the firefly luciferase (LUC) reporter gene (pBIΩFF) constructed as described below as an internal standard. An equimolar amount of each cucumisin:: GUS construct (2–2.5 μg) and 2.5 μg of the pBIΩFF plasmid were mixed with 3 mg of gold particles and suspended in 100 μl of ethanol. Each plant material was bombarded with a 12-μl aliquot of the suspension (360 μg of gold particles) per shot using a helium-driven Biolistic PDS1000 system (Bio-Rad) with a 28-mm Hg vacuum. The distance between the rupture disc (1,100 psi) and macrocarrier and that between the macrocarrier and sample were 3.0 and 6.0 cm, respectively. After bombardment, the tissues were covered with aluminum foil and incubated in the dark for 24 h at 25 °C. The central parts of fruit sections, leaves, and stems that were bombarded as described above were ground in liquid N2 using a chilled mortar and pestle. The powder was dispensed into microcentrifuge tubes and mixed with 300 μl of Pica Gene lysis buffer (LCβ/PGC-51; Wako, Osaka, Japan) containing 2 mm diisopropylfluorophosphate and then centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was frozen at −80 °C until the enzyme assay was conducted. Proteins were measured using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin as a standard. GUS activity was measured by the method of Jefferson et al. (11.Jefferson R.A. Kavanaugh T.A. Bevan M.W. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3901-3907Crossref PubMed Scopus (8126) Google Scholar), using 4-methylumbelliferyl β-d-glucuronide (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) as the substrate. The fluorometer was calibrated with 4-methylumbelliferone standards in the same solutions used for sample assays and blanked against the zero time point. LUC assays were performed as described by Miller et al. (12.Miller A.J. Short S.R. Hiratsuka K Chua N.-H. Kay S.A. Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. 1992; 10: 324-337Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar) using a Pica Gene LUC assay kit (Wako). Photon emission derived from LUC activity was counted with a luminometer (model TD-20/20; Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA). Background activities from plants bombarded with gold particles only were subtracted from each GUS and LUC value. All GUS values were normalized to the corresponding LUC values. Assays were performed on at least three different tissue samples for each construct, and the average values were expressed as relative activities to that of the positive control (pBI221, CLONTECH). The cucumisin upstream regions were amplified by PCR using two primers containing XbaI and BamHI sites at their 5′-ends, respectively. The BamHI site corresponds to the transcriptional start site of the cucumisin gene, and the XbaI site corresponds to the upstream region. The amplified fragments were subcloned into the XbaI-BamHI sites of the pSKGUS3C plasmid harboring GUS and a pea RuBisCO 3C (small subunit of ribulose-1, 5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase 3C) terminator (13.Bowler C. Neuhaus G Yamagata H. Chua N.-H. Cell. 1994; 77: 73-81Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). pBIΩFF contains the tobacco mosaic virus Ω sequence (14.Gallie D.R. Sleat D.E.

Short S.R. Hiratsuka K Chua N.-H. Kay S.A. Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. 1992; 10: 324-337Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar) in place of GUS between BamHI and SstI sites in pBI221. Both pBIΩFF and pBI221 have the same cauliflower mosaic virus 35S constitutive promoter and nopaline synthase terminator. For the gain-of-function experiments, the 4 × 20-bp tandem repeat sequence was prepared as follows. Two synthesized oligonucleotides, pHISpEX (5′-GGGGGAATTC(GACACGTGTCACAACCTAAT)4TCTAGACCCC-3′) and pHISmXE (5′-GGGGTCTAGA(ATTAGGTTGTGACACGTGTC)4GAATTCCCCC), were annealed and digested with EcoRI and XbaI to yield a 90-bp fragment denoted as pHIS. Then pHIS was ligated with EcoRI-NotI and XbaI-SacI adapters and digested with the corresponding restriction enzymes. The NotI-XbaI fragment of this sequence in the normal orientation and NotI-SacI fragment in the reverse orientation were placed into NotI/XbaI and SacI/NotI digested p89 plasmids, respectively, to yield pN-X (normal orientation) and pS-N (reverse orientation), and these plasmids were used for particle bombardment. All inserted sequences in each construct were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. The nuclear isolation procedure was essentially the same as that described by Foster et al. (15.Foster R. Gasch A. Kay S. Chua N.-H. Methods in Arabidopsis Research. World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd., Singapore1992: 378-392Crossref Google Scholar) with some modifications. All procedures were performed at 4 °C. The central parts of the immature melon fruit (about 10 DAP) were cut out from the pericarp, and the seeds were removed with a spatula. The tissue including the placenta, columella, and fibrous tissue (500 g) was ground using a commercial blender in 500 ml of nuclear grinding buffer (1 m hexylene glycol, 10 mm PIPES/KOH, pH 7.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.8 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 2 mmdiisopropylfluorophosphate). The mixture was filtered through two layers of gauze and 50-μm nylon mesh. The filtrate was centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 10 min, and the pellet (crude nuclei) was gently resuspended with a soft brush in 80 ml of nuclear wash buffer (0.5 m hexylene glycol, 10 mm PIPES/KOH, pH 7.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1.0 mmdiisopropylfluorophosphate). After centrifugation of the mixture at 3,000 × g for 5 min, the pellet was resuspended in 20 ml of nuclei lysis buffer (110 mm KCl, 15 mmHEPES/KOH, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 5 mg/ml antipain, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml chymostatin). Then 2 ml of 4 m ammonium sulfate was added to the mixture in several small aliquots with gentle mixing, and the mixture was ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 90 min using a Beckman W/Ti60 rotor. Then solid ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant to 0.25 mg/ml, and the protein precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min. The pellet was resuspended with 0.5 ml of nuclear extract buffer (70 mm KCl, 25 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 5 μg/ml antipain, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml chymostatin), and the suspension was dialyzed against dialysis buffer (70 mm KCl, 25 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.5, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 20% (v/v) glycerol) for 2 h. After centrifugation at 12,000 ×g for 10 min, the extract was frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C until use. The gel mobility shift assay was performed as described by Foster et al. (15.Foster R. Gasch A. Kay S. Chua N.-H. Methods in Arabidopsis Research. World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd., Singapore1992: 378-392Crossref Google Scholar) with some modifications. The following oligonucleotides were synthesized and used as probes (only the upper strands are shown for Ga, Gb, and Gc): Gp, 5′-AAGATATGATAAAAATAGACGACACGTGTCACAACCTA-3′; Gm, 5′-ATTAGGTTGTGACACGTGTCGTCTATTTTTATCATATC-3′; Hp, 5′-AACCTAATTGAGATATTTCGATGTACTTTCTATCCGTC-3′; Hm, 5′-AAGACGGATAGAAAGTACATCGAAATATCTCAATTAGG-3′; Ga, 5′-AAGATATGATAAAAATAGAC-3′; Gb, 5′-GACACGTGTCACAACCTAAT-3′; Gc, 5′-AAAAATAGACGACACGTGTC-3′. Complementary single-stranded oligonucleotides, Gp and Gm or Hp and Hm containing a protruding AA or AT at the 5′-end were annealed and labeled with 0.925 MBq of [α-32P]dATP and [α-32P]dTTP by fill-in reaction with Klenow fragment (New England Biolabs). For Ga, Gb, and Gc oligonucleotides, each complementary single-stranded oligonucleotide was annealed, resulting in blunt ends and end-labeled with 1.5 MBq [γ-32P]dATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). The labeled oligonucleotides were fractionated on G-25 microspin columns (Amersham Biosciences), and the radioactivity was measured on a liquid scintillation counter. Gel mobility shift reactions were performed in a volume of 20 μl containing labeled oligonucleotide probe (300,000 cpm) and 6 μg of nuclear protein in binding buffer (25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 100 mmKCl, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mmEDTA-Na2, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 3 mg of poly(dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC)). For competition assays, the following oligonucleotides were synthesized and used as unlabeled competitors (only the upper strands are shown): GH, 5′-ATAGACGACACGTGTCACAACCTAATTGAGATATTTCGAT-3′; Ha, 5′-AACCTAATTGAGATATTTCG-3′; Hb, 5′-ATGTACTTTCTATCCGTCTT-3′; G1, 5′-AAGATATGAT-3′; G2, 5′-AAAAATAGAC-3′; G3, 5′-GACACGTGTC-3′; G4, 5′-ACAACCTAAT-3′; G5, 5′-TGTCACAACCTAAT-3′; I-box-like, 5′-AGATATGATAAAAA-3′. For competition assays with the mutated competitors, complementary oligonucleotides with successive mutation at one base were synthesized and annealed. The mutated nucleotides, which were exchanged in principle between purine and pyrimidine derivatives (i.e. A to G, G to A, T to C, and C to T) are listed in Fig. 9C. Each complementary single-stranded oligonucleotide was annealed and added to the reaction mixture at a 100–500-fold molar excess relative to the labeled probes as indicated in the figure legends. After incubation for 30 min at 25 °C, the reaction mixture was loaded onto an 8 or 10% native polyacrylamide gel containing 45 mm Tris borate and 1 mm EDTA (0.5× TBE buffer) and subjected to electrophoresis at 160 V for 2 h. The gels were dried on Whatman 3MM filter paper and exposed to New RX 50 film (Fuji) with an intensifying screen at −80 °C for 2 or 3 days. The 5′ part of the cucumisin gene containing the 1.2-kb promoter was obtained by inverse PCR using melon genomic DNA as a template. The combined nucleotide sequence, which was confirmed by several independent rounds of ordinary PCR to correct for possible PCR errors, was 3,049 bp in length and contained five exons encoding Met 1The abbreviations used are: DAPday after pollinationGUSβ-glucuronidaseLUCluciferasePIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acidGBFG-box binding factor–Ala181 of the cucumisin precursor and four introns. Fig. 1 shows the nucleotide sequence of the 1.2-kb promoter and short stretch of the transcribed region. The entire sequence is available from the GenBankTMdata base under accession number AY055805. The nucleotide sequence of the coding region was identical to that of the cDNA (7.Yamagata H. Masuzawa T. Nagaoka Y Ohnishi T. Iwasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32725-32731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Introns 1–3 were mapped in the prosequence of the cucumisin precursor, and intron 4 was located in that of the mature protease domain. Primer extension analysis revealed that transcription begins at an adenine residue located 48 bp upstream of the translational start site (Fig. 2). The putative TATA box, TATAAA, and CAAT box, CAAAT, were located 34 and 89 bp upstream, respectively, from this transcriptional start site. In the upstream region, a perfect palindromic G-box (5′-GACACGTGTC-3′), the target-binding site of plant basic leucine zipper proteins (16.Foster R Izawa T. Chua N.-H. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 192-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), was found at −234 to −225 bp from the transcriptional start site. An I-box-like sequence containing a tandem GATA repeat (5′-AGATATGATAAAA-3′), in that 9 bases were identical to the reported 13-bp I-box element (5′-GGATGAGATAAGA-3′) (17.Meier I. Callan K.L. Fleming A.J. Gruissem W. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 1105-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), was also found at positions −253 to −241 (Fig. 1).Figure 2Identification of the transcriptional start site by primer extension analysis.

We fused the DNA sequence extending 1,181 bp upstream from the transcriptional start site (P1181 construct; Fig. 1) to the GUS reporter gene and introduced the construct into the central part of the fruit sections by particle bombardment with the 35S-LUCconstruct (pBIΩFF) as the internal standard (Fig. 3). When the relative GUS activity of the control plasmid (pBI221) containing a constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter was taken as 100, the activity of the p1181 was 35, indicating that the 1181-bp 5′-upstream region was sufficient for the high level expression of the GUS gene in melon fruit (Fig. 3A). To broadly determine the positive enhancer region, 5′ deletion analysis of the 1,181-bp cucumisin promoter was conducted, and the activities of the deletion constructs were measured in young fruits, leaves, and stems. The p234 construct showed comparable levels of activity to the full-length p1181 construct in fruit, indicating that a region sufficient to confer higher expression in fruit is present within the −234 bp region from the transcriptional start site (Fig. 3A). However, the activity of p228 constructs lacking 6 nucleotides (GACACG) in the G-box element (5′-GACACGTGTC-3′) was decreased to about half of that of p1181. In the p214 construct, the activity decreased to about one-sixth of that of p1181. No further drop in activity was observed by deleting the promoter to position −89, and these activities were thought to be the basal level of the cucumisin minimal promoter (p89) containing the TATA box and CAAT box. These results indicated that critical cis-acting element(s) responsible for high level cucumisin promoter activity in fruit were localized in the 20-bp fragment from −234 to −215, the sequence of which is 5′-GACACGTGTCACAACCTAAT-3′. This sequence contains a perfect palindrome of a typical G-box element (5′-GACACGTGTC-3′) in the first half. The decrease in activity of the p254 construct suggested the presence of another positive element(s) in the region from −310 to −255 and negative element(s) in the region from −254 to −235, which contains an I-box-like sequence (5′-AGATATGATAAAA-3′). Since p234 had strong activity comparable with the longest p1181, we did not examine further the possible positive element(s) upstream of −234. All constructs from P1181 to P214 introduced in melon leaves and stems showed very low levels of promoter activity in contrast to the control pBI221 that showed a high level of activity in these organs (Fig. 3, B and C). The activities of cucumisin promoter constructs in stems were slightly higher than those in leaves. These results indicated that the cis-regulatory element(s) in the upstream region of the cucumisin promoter is responsible for not only high level expression in fruits but also for fruit-specific expression. We conducted gain-of-function analysis to determine whether the 20-bp region from −234 to −215 is able to confer fruit-specific high level expression on the cucumisin minimal promoter. Four tandem repeats of the 20-bp sequence were fused in the normal or reverse orientation to the truncated (−89 to −1 from the transcriptional start site) cucumisin promoter containing the putative TATA and CAAT boxes to yield pN-X and pS-N, respectively (Fig. 4). In the absence of the 20-bp sequence, the construct (p89) showed very low levels of GUS activity in fruit tissues as in leaves and stems. However, fruit bombarded with construct containing four copies of the 20-bp upstream sequence (pN-X) showed an 8-fold induction of GUS activity, and the activity was comparable with that of fruit bombarded with the full-length cucumisinpromoter (p1181) (Fig. 4A). It is noteworthy that the tandem repeat of the 20-bp sequence promoted GUS expression in both orientations. However, both pN-X and pS-N did not lead to elevation of basal level of GUS activity derived from p89 in leaf or stem tissues (Fig. 4, B and C). These results indicated that the 20-bp sequence has two functions: to enhance transcription in fruit tissues and to act as a fruit-specific enhancer. Transient expression assays suggested that the 20-bp sequence from −234 to −215 containing a G-box element (5′-GACACGTGTC-3′) contains cis-element(s) responsible for high level and fruit-specific expression and suggested that the region from −254 to −235 containing the I-box-like sequence (5′-AGATATGATAAAA-3′) that has a tandem repeat of the GATA sequence has a negative influence on gene expression. Another I-box-related sequence, a GATA element, was also found between −212 and −207 (5′-AGATAT-3′) an"

A growing body of evidence suggests that the p44/42 MAP1 kinase (ERK) cascade in particular plays important roles in the modulation of long-term potentiation in area CA1 of the hippocampus and is required for several forms of learning and memory (1Sweatt J.D. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). Given the roles of this kinase cascade in transcriptionally regulated processes, initial studies focused on its roles in long term forms of both long-term potentiation of synaptic transmission in the hippocampus and hippocampus-dependent long term memory formation (2Selcher J.C.

Neurosci. 1998; 1: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar). More recent studies, however, implicate a role for this kinase in more moment-to-moment cellular excitability (8Watabe A.M. Zaki P.A. O'Dell T.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5924-5931Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Winder D.G. Martin K.C. Muzzio I.A. Rohrer D. Chruscinski A. Kobilka B. Kandel E.R. Neuron. 1999; 24: 715-726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Thus, the ERK signaling cascade regulates several aspects of synaptic transmission. Because of the multiple roles ERK may play in neuronal function it is critical to understand how the activation of this kinase is regulated in neurons. A number of receptor signaling pathways critical to synaptic plasticity recruit ERK activation in the hippocampus. As in many cell types, ligands for receptor tyrosine kinases, such as neurotrophins, recruit ERK activation in neurons, as doesN-methyl d-aspartate receptor activation (10English J.D. Sweatt J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24329-24332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar,11Kurino M. Fukunaga K. Ushio Y. Miyamoto E. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1282-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In addition, neuromodulators such as norepinephrine (NE) that activate GPCRs play critical roles in learning and memory and synaptic plasticity, at least in part through the regulation of ERK activity. For example, the activation of one adrenergic receptor, the Gs-coupled β-adrenergic receptor, results in increased ERK activity and facilitates ERK-dependent forms of long-term potentiation in CA1 (8Watabe A.M.

However, this receptor is not likely to be activated alone in vivo but rather in concert with other NE receptors, including the Gq-coupled α1-adrenergic receptor (α1AR) and the Gi/o-coupled α2-adrenergic receptor (α2AR), both present in CA1 (14Wang R. Macmillan L.B. Fremeau Jr., R.T. Magnuson M.A. Lindner J. Limbird L.E. Neuroscience. 1996; 74: 199-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 15Milner T.A. Lee A. Aicher S.A. Rosin D.L. J. Comp.

Both of these classes of adrenergic receptors have been demonstrated to strongly couple to activation of ERK in non-neuronal cell lines (17Zhong H. Minneman K.P. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 375: 261-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 18Sugden P.H. Clerk A. Cell Signal. 1997; 9: 337-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 19van Biesen T. Luttrell L.M. Hawes B.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 698-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar); however, their regulation of the ERK cascade in neurons remains undefined. Because ERK plays predominantly excitatory roles in neuronal function (1Sweatt J.D. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar), it seems counterintuitive that Gi/o-coupled receptors thought to play inhibitory roles in neuronal function would activate this cascade. Consistent with this idea, recent studies have demonstrated that the α2AR does not activate ERK in stably transfected PC12 cells, even though functional expression of the receptor was demonstrated. However, as in the non-neuronal cell lines, the α1- and β-adrenergic receptors stimulate ERK activation in differentiated PC12 cells (20Williams N.G. Zhong H. Minneman K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24624-24632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We have begun to examine the role of GPCR receptors in coupling to ERK activation in area CA1 of the mouse hippocampus with an emphasis on the role of Gi/o-coupled receptors. We began with adrenergic receptor subtypes and found that, as in the case of PC12 cells, the β and α1ARs robustly couple to ERK phosphorylation in adult mouse CA1, whereas the α2AR subtype does not. Moreover, we found that the 5HT1A receptor (a Gi/o-coupled receptor enriched in area CA1 and homologous to the α2AR) also fails to couple to ERK activation in this region even though it has been shown to couple to ERK activation in non-neuronal cell types (21Raymond J.R. Mukhin Y.V. Gettys T.W. Garnovskaya M.N. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 127: 1751-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Because these receptors play predominantly inhibitory roles in regulating neuronal function, the lack of coupling of these receptors to ERK in situ is likely through a physiologically important inhibitory constraint. However, in contrast we find that the nonhomologous Gi/o-coupled GABAB receptor does activate ERK in mouse CA1. This receptor has recently been demonstrated to associate with CREB2 and ATF4 in hippocampal neurons (22Nehring R.B. Horikawa H.P. El Far O. Kneussel M. Brandstatter J.H. Stamm S. Wischmeyer E. Betz H. Karschin A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35185-35191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 23White J.H. McIllhinney R.A. Wise A. Ciruela F. Chan W.Y. Emson P.C. Billinton A. Marshall F.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13967-13972Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), and receptor activation initiates ERK-dependent CREB2 transcription (23White J.H. McIllhinney R.A. Wise A. Ciruela F. Chan W.Y. Emson P.C. Billinton A. Marshall F.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13967-13972Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), suggesting the activation of ERK by the GABAB receptor may have important physiological consequences. Finally, although the α2AR fails to activate ERK in CA1 from adult mice, we do observe ERK activation in response to α2AR activation in CA1 from immature mice where basal levels of phospho-ERK are dramatically reduced. Taken together these data support the idea that activation of ERK is differentially regulated in neuronal versusnon-neuronal cells, that ERK signaling via GPCRs is receptor identity-specific, and that the ERK cascade is developmentally regulated. Preparation of hippocampal slices was performed as previously described (9Winder D.G. Martin K.C. Muzzio I.A. Rohrer D. Chruscinski A. Kobilka B. Kandel E.R. Neuron. 1999; 24: 715-726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Briefly, hippocampi were dissected from C57Bl6/j mice (Jackson), either 6–11-week-old male adults or 17–21-day-old male and female adolescents (no difference was observed between sexes), and 400-μm thick slices were prepared using a McIlwain chopper. Slices were then placed in multiwelled submerged chambers with oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (in mm: NaCl, 124; KCl, 4.4; CaCl2, 2; MgSO4, 1.2; NaH2PO4, 1; glucose, 10; and NaHCO3, 26) at 26–28 °C unless otherwise specified. Slices were equilibrated for 2–3 h before drug application was performed. After drug application, slices were transferred directly to a metal surface in dry ice for rapid freezing and microdissection of area CA1. Slices were then stored at −80 °C until homogenization. CA1 minislices were added to ice-cold homogenization buffer (TBS, 20 mm; Triton X-100, 0.5%; sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm; and NaF, 2 mm), homogenized, and centrifuged at 4 °C. Protein levels in supernatant were determined by the Bradford method using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Samples were then diluted to equal concentrations, mixed with an equal volume of sample buffer (Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 62.5 mm; glycerol; SDS, 2%; bromphenol blue, 0.5%; and β-mercaptoethanol, 5%), heated at 95 °C for 4 min, and run on a 10% polyacrylamide-resolving gel using a Bio-Rad mini trans-blot apparatus. Protein was then transferred to two immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membranes in series. The first blot was probed with anti-phospho-p44/42 ERK primary antibody (1:5000; Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), whereas the second blot was stained for total protein using colloidal gold (Bio-Rad) to verify equal lane loading. In some cases the first blot was stripped and re-probed for total ERK with anti-p44/42 ERK (1:5000; Cell Signaling). To strip, blots were incubated in stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 2% SDS, and 100 mmβ-mercaptoethanol) for 30 min at 50 °C with occasional agitation and then washed with TBS-Tween. To avoid the loss of phosphate groups on targeted proteins during processing all subsequent incubations included 2 mm sodium orthovanadate and 2 mm NaF. Blots were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS-Tween for 1 h at room temperature. After rinsing, blots were incubated in the appropriate primary antibody either overnight (4 °C) or for 1 h (room temperature) on a shaker. After a further rinse, a horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (1:5000; Promega, Madison WI), was applied for 1 h (room temperature) on a shaker. Blots were then rinsed and processed for enhanced chemiluminescence following the kit manufacturer's instructions (ECL, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), exposed to film, and developed. Relative amounts of signal on blots were determined by scanning the films using a Hewlett Packard Scanjet 5200C into a Pentium III-based computer then utilizing an adaptation of NIH Image software (Scion Image) to measure optical density. By running a standard curve of protein concentrations on each blot above and below the concentration utilized in our sample lanes we verified the linearity of this measurement. Results from repeated experiments were then averaged together and differences from basal were tested by Mann-Whitney analysis unless specified otherwise. CA1 minislices were homogenized in 6% trichloroacetic acid and centrifuged at 4 °C. The supernatant was washed with tert-butylmethyl ether to remove residual trichloroacetic acid and then lyophilized. The cAMP residue was dissolved in the buffer supplied with the PerkinElmer Life Sciences cAMP RIA kit. The cAMP assay was performed per manufacturer's suggestions (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA). Radioactivity was counted on a Cobra II Auto-Gamma Counter (Packard). Sample counts were normalized to an average protein amount determined by the Bradford assay with CA1 minislices collected in parallel with the CA1 minislices used in the cAMP assay. Results from repeated experiments were then averaged together and differences were tested by unpaired student'st test. As shown in Fig.1 a, the application of norepinephrine (100 μm, 15 min.) elicited robust phosphorylation of ERK2 (273 ± 44%, p = 0.009) in area CA1 of the mouse hippocampus. To determine which classes of adrenergic receptors mediate this action we assessed the ability of various agonists to mimic the action of NE. Consistent with previous studies (9Winder D.G. Martin K.C. Muzzio I.A. Rohrer D. Chruscinski A. Kobilka B. Kandel E.R. Neuron. 1999; 24: 715-726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 12Roberson E.D. English J.D. Adams J.P. Selcher J.C. Kondratick C. Sweatt J.D. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4337-4348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we found that activation of the Gs-coupled β-adrenergic receptor by isoproterenol potently elicited ERK phosphorylation in CA1, with an EC50 of 3.5 nm(Fig. 1, a and b). Further, an α-adrenergic receptor agonist, 6-fluoronorepinephrine (100 μm), also elicited ERK2 phosphorylation (241 ± 38%, p = 0.009; Fig. 1 a). This agonist was added in the presence of the β-adrenergic receptor antagonist, timolol (10 μm), because cross-activity with the β-adrenergic receptor has been observed (24Pedarzani P. Storm J.F. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 2098-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Although the general α-adrenergic receptor agonist evoked ERK phosphorylation, activation of the Gi/o-coupled α2ARs by the more specific agonists UK14,304 (1 μm) or Clonidine (10 μm) did not elicit detectable rises in ERK phosphorylation (Figs. 1 a and2 a) even though saturating concentrations of agonists were applied (25Li Y.W. Bayliss D.A. Neuroscience. 1998; 82: 753-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 26Boehm S. J. Physiol. 1999; 519: 439-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data indicate that the NE-evoked rise in ERK activation in adult mouse CA1 is due to β-adrenergic receptor/Gs and α1AR/Gq activation but not α2AR/Gi/o activation.Figure 2Do Gi/o-coupled receptors activate ERK in adult mouse CA1?

Chem. 1994; 269: 30254-30259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, these data are reminiscent of recent reports in PC12 cells in which a similar lack of coupling was reported even though functional coupling to other cascades was demonstrated (20Williams N.G. Zhong H. Minneman K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24624-24632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In HEK293 cells, activation of ERK by α2ARs is rapid, peaking within 5 min of drug addition (29Schramm N.L. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24935-24940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Thus we investigated the possibility that coupling of α2ARs to ERK activation is time-dependent by assessing ERK phosphorylation as a result of Clonidine (10 μm) application for time intervals ranging from 2 to 15 min. However, at none of these time points was a statistically significant increase in ERK phosphorylation observed (Fig.2 a). Another possibility is that the regulation of ERK phosphorylation by α2ARs is temperature-dependent. To test this possibility, we repeated experiments with the full α2AR agonist UK14,304 (1 μm) with slices incubated in 37 °C artificial cerebrospinal fluid. Again, α2AR activation did not increase ERK phosphorylation, whereas NE did (227 ± 51%,p = 0.055). Interestingly, after a 10-min application of UK14,304 at 37 °C, there is a decrease in phospho-ERK2 (70 ± 13%, p = 0.047; Fig. 2 b). Thus, at physiological temperatures, Gi/o-coupled receptors may not only fail to increase ERK phosphorylation but also decrease phospho-ERK concentrations. In addition, in in vivo experiments by Penget al. (31Peng M. Li Y. Luo Z. Liu C. Laties A.M. Wen R. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: 1721-1726PubMed Google Scholar), an α2AR agonist administered intramuscularly decreased phospho-ERK levels in the rat hippocampus, though the tissue was analyzed 2 h postinjection. Numerous studies have shown that Gi/o-elicited ERK activation can be achieved by βγ signaling through p21ras (Ras) and Raf. In many cell types, Ras/Raf signaling is inhibited by activation of PKA (32Burgering B.M. Pronk G.J. van Weeren P.C. Chardin P. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4211-4220Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 33Cook S.J. McCormick F. Science. 1993; 262: 1069-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar, 34Wu J. Dent P. Jelinek T.

Neurobiol. 1999; 9: 544-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar), suggesting the possibility that α2ARs can signal ERK activation through Raf, but that tonic inhibition of the cascade may prevent significant coupling in adult mouse CA1. Although the cAMP/PKA cascade has been demonstrated to activate rather than inhibit ERK in neurons, this activation is thought to occur through the activation of a second signaling cascade involving Rap1 and B-raf (36Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar, 37Schmitt J.M. Stork P.J. J. Biol.

Thus, we tested the possibility that the cAMP/PKA cascade tonically inhibits α2AR coupling to ERK through the Ras/Raf cascade by assessing the effects of preincubation of hippocampal slices with 1 μm KT5720, a concentration sufficient to inhibit PKA-dependent long-term potentiation (9Winder D.G.

Neuroreport. 1993; 4: 712-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Consistent with the idea that basal PKA activity dampens basal phospho-ERK in the hippocampus, the administration of KT5720 does slightly increase basal phospho-ERK2 (133 ± 13%,p = 0.004). However, PKA inhibition in adult mouse CA1 had no significant effect on α2AR-elicited ERK activity (Fig. 2 c). Another potential explanation for the lack of coupling of the α2AR to ERK phosphorylation is that the receptor is not expressed at a threshold level required for ERK phosphorylation. The α2AR is functionally expressed in this brain region as assessed by cAMP assays and electrophysiological analysis in rat (41Mueller A.L. Hoffer B.J. Dunwiddie T.V. Brain. Res. 1981; 214: 113-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar,42Fulford A.J. Butler S. Heal D.J. Kendall D.A. Marsden C.A. Psychopharmacology (Berl). 1994; 116: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and in mouse, 2D. G. Winder, unpublished observations. but to further address this issue we assessed the ability of other Gi/o-coupled receptors to couple to ERK phosphorylation in CA1. Both the 5HT1A and GABAB receptors are Gi/o-coupled and enriched in area CA1 (43Newberry N.R. Nicoll R.A. Nature. 1984; 308: 450-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 44Riad M. Garcia S. Watkins K.C. Jodoin N. Doucet E. Langlois X. el Mestikawy S. Hamon M. Descarries L. J. Comp. Neurol. 2000; 417: 181-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). However, even at saturating concentrations (45Andrade R. Nicoll R.A. Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 1987; 336: 5-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 46Sakai N. Tanaka C. Brain Res. 1993; 613: 326-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), agonists of the 5HT1A receptor do not significantly increase ERK phosphorylation in adult mouse CA1 (Fig. 2 d). In fact, as with α2AR activation at 37 °C, the application of 8-hydroxy-DPAT appeared to decrease ERK phosphorylation (68 ± 8%, n = 3, p = 0.049). Interestingly, we observed that activation of the GABABreceptor, a member of a distinct GPCR family from the adrenergic and serotonin receptors (47Bockaert J. Pin J.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (1215) Google Scholar), does yield increased ERK activation (148 ± 24% of basal, p = 0.003; Fig. 2 d). However, the degree of ERK activation is low relative to that elicited by the Gs- and Gq-coupled receptors. Although α2AR activation does not by itself significantly regulate ERK phosphorylation in mouse CA1, it is important to remember that these receptors are not likely activated alone in vivo but rather in concert with other adrenergic receptors. Thus, it is conceivable that the role of α2ARs in ERK activation could be to regulate another receptor's ability to signal ERK activation. For example, the Gi/o-coupled α2AR could indirectly regulate β-adrenergic receptor activity through modulating adenylyl cyclase activity and cAMP production. However, co-application of the α2AR agonist with either subsaturating or saturating concentrations of isoproterenol does not affect ERK activity elicited by β-adrenergic receptor activation in adult mouse CA1 (Fig. 3). These data are consistent with the data showing NE activation of ERK that resembles isoproterenol-induced ERK activation, because NE should activate both the β-adrenergic receptor and the α2AR. In the hippocampus a number of effector systems regulated by GPCRs are developmentally controlled. The ERK cascade proves to be among these as we found that basal levels of phospho-ERK2 were dramatically lower in area CA1 of slices taken from 17–21-day-old adolescent mice compared with 7–8-week-old adult mice (Fig.4 a). This was not due to an alteration in total ERK levels as ERK expression was similar across these two age groups. In addition, the difference observed in basal phospho-ERK levels is not due to a difference in basal cAMP levels as we observed no change in cAMP levels between the two age groups (Fig.4 b). Forskolin treatment, a positive control, elicited robust rises in cAMP levels in both groups (data not shown). Further, in addition to GABAB receptor activation of ERK, which is observed in both age groups, we found that in area CA1 of hippocampal slices from young mice α2AR activation elicits a significant increase in ERK phosphorylation over basal (Fig. 4,c and d). Because ERK is activated by the α2AR in CA1 from the young animal, the question arises whether norepinephrine responses are altered in CA1 from the young animal. Thus, adrenergic agonist experiments were repeated in the adult animal and in animals of 2–3 weeks of age. Norepinephrine did elicit robust ERK activation in CA1 from young animals, as did each of the other adrenergic agonists and antagonist (Fig. 4 d). There appears to be a higher degree of ERK activation in the younger animals than the adult animals. However, it is important to note that in comparing the age groups the ratio of the difference in basal levels of ERK phosphorylation is clearly much greater than the difference in agonist-elicited ERK phosphorylation. Thus, we cannot discriminate at this point to what degree this reflects an actual developmental regulation of the receptor response versus increased signal-to-noise provided by the relatively low levels of basal phospho-ERK in hippocampal slices from young mice. The principal findings of the present study are: 1) that the degree of coupling of GPCRs to ERK activation in mouse CA1 is highly subtype-specific, 2) that two Gi/o-coupled receptors (α2AR and 5HT1AR) that robustly activate ERK in mitotic non-neuronal cells do not activate ERK in adult mouse CA1 whereas the nonhomologous GABAB receptor does, and 3) that basal phospho-ERK levels, but not basal cAMP levels, are developmentally regulated in mouse CA1. Consistent with previous work, we show that Gs- and Gq-coupled adrenergic receptors (β and α1ARs) robustly couple to ERK phosphorylation in adult mouse CA1 whereas the Gi/o-coupled α2AR does not. In addition, we observed a similar lack of ERK coupling with the homologous 5HT1A receptor. This is surprising given that these receptors so readily couple to ERK activation in mitotic non-neuronal cell types (21Raymond J.R. Mukhin Y.V. Gettys T.W. Garnovskaya M.N. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 127: 1751-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 29Schramm N.L. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24935-24940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). There is the possibility that these receptors couple to ERK in a very discrete location and that the coupling is not detected with an immunoblot of the tissue homogenate. However, β-adrenergic receptor-induced ERK phosphorylation, which is readily detectable via immunoblot, has been localized to CA1 pyramidal cell somas and dendritic shafts by immunocytochemical techniques (9Winder D.G. Martin K.C. Muzzio I.A. Rohrer D. Chruscinski A. Kobilka B. Kandel E.R. Neuron. 1999; 24: 715-726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The apparent lack of coupling of the α2AR to ERK phosphorylation and the inhibition of basal ERK phosphorylation at physiological temperatures by the α2AR is in concert with the classically described inhibitory roles of Gi/o-coupled receptors in neuronal function contrasted with the excitatory actions of ERK in regulating synaptic transmission and cellular excitability (9Winder D.G.

Dineley K. Cook R. Pfaffinger P.J. Sweatt J.D. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 2277-2287Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Indeed, similar results were reported when adrenergic receptor subtypes were transfected into PC12 cells, with the β and α1, but not α2ARs eliciting ERK phosphorylation (20Williams N.G. Zhong H. Minneman K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24624-24632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Combined with the PC12 cell data, our findings suggest the existence of potent neuron-specific inhibition of ERK phosphorylation via Gi/o-coupled receptor activation in the adult mouse, which is likely of physiological importance. The ERK signaling cascade participates in neuronal damage induced by ischemia (49Alessandrini A. Namura S. Moskowitz M.A. Bonventre J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12866-12869Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar) and in the generation of seizure activity in cultured hippocampal neurons (50Murray B. Alessandrini A. Cole A.J. Yee A.G. Furshpan E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11975-11980Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Gi/o-coupled receptors typically reduce neurotransmitter release and hyperpolarize postsynaptic cells, actions that would be expected to reduce these pathologies. Thus, if these receptors coupled to the ERK cascade in neurons, it would be predicted that the activation of these receptors might exacerbate rather than ameliorate ERK-dependent forms of ischemic damage and seizure. Although significant enhancement of ERK phosphorylation was not detected with the activation of the α2AR in adult mouse CA1, we did observe clear activation of ERK by this receptor in CA1 from 2–3-week-old mice. In addition, the basal level of phospho-ERK in CA1 is developmentally regulated, with the adult animal expressing over 4-fold more phospho-ERK2 than the young animal. Interestingly, cAMP/PKA plays a role in basal phospho-ERK levels, at least in the adult mouse CA1, as PKA inhibition slightly increased ERK phosphorylation. However, basal cAMP concentrations do not differ between the two age groups, suggesting developmental changes in signaling pathways regulating ERK activity. Although the α2AR displayed differences in ERK coupling depending on the age of the animal, the nonhomologous GABABreceptor activated ERK in both young and adult mouse CA1. Interestingly, this receptor has recently been shown to physiologically interact with ATF4 and CREB2 in central nervous system neurons (22Nehring R.B. Horikawa H.P. El Far O. Kneussel M.

A. 2000; 97: 13967-13972Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and to promote CREB2-mediated transcription through an ERK-dependent mechanism (23White J.H. McIllhinney R.A. Wise A. Ciruela F. Chan W.Y. Emson P.C. Billinton A. Marshall F.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13967-13972Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Thus, GABABreceptor activation of ERK may regulate CREB2-mediated transcriptional processes in area CA1. CREB2 has been demonstrated to play a critical role in regulating the transition from short to long term forms of synaptic facilitation and memory in invertebrate preparations (51Yin J.C. Wallach J.S. Del Vecchio M. Wilder E.L. Zhou H. Quinn W.G. Tully T. Cell. 1994; 79: 49-58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar, 52Bartsch D. Ghirardi M. Skehel P.A. Karl K.A. Herder S.P. Chen M. Bailey C.H. Kandel E.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 979-992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar), suggesting the possibility that GABAB receptor activation may locally influence these processes in vertebrates. The specificity of the Gi/o-linked receptor coupling to ERK that we demonstrate here is not surprising given that the GABABreceptor shares no homology with the α2AR and 5HT1A receptor (47Bockaert J. Pin J.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (1215) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the degree of ERK activation elicited by GABAB receptors is relatively small in comparison to the Gs- and Gq-adrenergic receptor responses. In future studies, it will be important to determine whether the difference in ERK activation levels is due to a subpopulation of these receptors on distinct cell populations or subcellular locations and/or reflects mechanistic differences in the signaling of Gi/o-coupled receptors versus the Gs- and Gq-coupled receptors.

In this study, we identify a novel p53-interacting region in CBP/p300, which we call CR2, located near the carboxyl terminus. The 95-amino acid CR2 region (amino acids 2055–2150) is located adjacent to the C/H3 domain and corresponds precisely with the minimal steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC1)-interacting domain of CBP (also called IBiD). We show that the region of p53 that participates in the CR2 interaction resides within the first 107 amino acids of the protein. p53 binds strongly to the CR2 domain of both CBP and the highly homologous coactivator p300. Importantly, an in-frame deletion of CR2 within the full-length p300 protein strongly compromises p300-mediated p53 transcriptional activation from a chromatin template in vitro. The identification of the p53-interacting CR2 domain in CBP/p300 prompted us to ask if the human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV-I) Tax protein, which also interacts with CR2, competes with p53 for binding to this domain.

The identity of the p53·CR2 interaction indicates that at least three distinct sites on CBP/p300 may participate in mediating p53 transactivation. steroid receptor coactivator 1 human T-cell leukemia virus I glutathione S-transferase carboxyl-terminal region 1 protein carboxyl-terminal region 2 protein electrophoretic mobility shift assay amino acid(s) imitation switch ATP-dependent chromatin assembly factor 1 CBP and the highly related protein p300 are very large, highly conserved coactivator proteins that serve to mediate the regulation of gene expression in metazoans.

These include pathways that are required for development and differentiation, response to hormonal stimulation, apoptosis, and tumor suppression. A significant number of transcription factors, such as Mdm2, BRCA1, HTLV-I Tax, and SRC1,1 have been demonstrated to interact with CBP/p300, with several binding at multiple sites on the coactivators (5Van Orden K. Nyborg J.K. Gene Expr. 2000; 9: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The functional significance of these multivalent activator/coactivator interactions is currently unknown.p53 is a sequence-specific, DNA-binding transcription factor that induces apoptosis or cell cycle arrest in response to genotoxic stress, thus blocking the transmission of DNA mutations to progeny cells (6Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar). Loss of p53 activity has been identified in 60% of the human malignancies examined (7Harris N. Brill E. Shohat O. Prokocimer M. Wolf D. Arai N. Rotter V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4650-4656Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 8Levine A.J. Perry M.E. Chang A. Silver A. Dittmer D. Wu M. Welsh D. Br. J. Cancer. 1994; 69: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar), consistent with its critical role in the suppression of malignant transformation. The tumor suppressor functions of p53 are directly linked to its ability to mediate transcriptional activation. To stimulate transcription, p53 binds as a tetramer to specific response elements located in the transcriptional control regions of p53 target genes (6Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar, 9Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6697) Google Scholar). This step initiates the assembly of the complex transcriptional apparatus that initiates RNA synthesis. This critical early step in transcriptional activation is believed to be facilitated by the ability of p53 to simultaneously bind the specific DNA sequences and recruit CBP/p300 to the p53-responsive promoters. CBP/p300 recruitment appears to concomitantly bring RNA polymerase II to the target promoters (10Neish A.S. Anderson S.F. Schlegel B.P. Wei W. Parvin J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), increasing the rate of preinitiation complex assembly (11Yie J. Senger K. Thanos D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13108-13113Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). There is also evidence that, following promoter association, CBP/p300 may also recruit or stabilize components of the general transcription machinery, including TFIIB and TBP (12Dallas P.B. Yaciuk P. Moran E. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1726-1731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Kwok R.P. Lundblad J.R. Chrivia J.C. Richards J.P. Bachinger H.P. Brennan R.G. Roberts S.G. Green M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1994; 370: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar). CBP/p300 also facilitates transcriptional activation through nucleosome and transcription factor acetylation. The coactivators have been shown to directly acetylate lysine residues present within the amino-terminal tails of the four core histones (14Schiltz R.L. Mizzen C.A. Vassilev A. Cook R.G. Allis C.D. Nakatani Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1189-1192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Acetylation appears to increase the accessibility of the nucleosomal DNA to transcription factor binding, a critical step in gene activation (15Lee D.Y. Hayes J.J. Pruss D. Wolffe A.P. Cell. 1993; 72: 73-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar, 16Vettese-Dadey M. Grant P.A. Hebbes T.R. Crane-Robinson C. Allis C.D. Workman J.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2508-2518Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Interestingly, CBP and p300 have also been shown to acetylate p53 at lysine residues 373 and 382 (17Gu W. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1997; 90: 595-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2152) Google Scholar). Although acetylated p53 binds short fragments of DNA with a higher affinity than the unacetylated form, this modification does not appear to significantly affect p53 DNA binding activity on chromatin assembled templates (18Espinosa J.M. Emerson B.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 57-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar).These observations serve to illustrate a prominent role for CBP/p300 in mediating the tumor suppressor functions of p53. However, the molecular details of the physical interaction between the activator and coactivator remain elusive. Several previous studies have indicated that p53 specifically binds to multiple sites on the coactivator, including the KIX domain (19Van Orden K. Giebler H.A. Lemasson I. Gonzales M. Nyborg J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26321-26328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and an ill-defined carboxyl-terminal region of CBP/p300 (20Gu W. Shi X.L. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 819-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 21Avantaggiati M.L. Ogryzko V. Gardner K. Giordano A. Levine A.S. Kelly K.

Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3693-3696PubMed Google Scholar). The amino-terminal activation domain of p53 has been shown to participate in each of these coactivator interactions (19Van Orden K. Giebler H.A. Lemasson I. Gonzales M. Nyborg J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26321-26328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 24De Guzman R.N. Liu H.Y. Martinez-Yamout M. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In studies that attempted to elucidate the precise carboxyl-terminal region of CBP/p300 involved in p53 binding, only the C/H3 domain of CBP (approximate aa 1764–1850; also called TAZ2 and TRAM) has emerged as a site of p53 interaction (25O'Connor M.J. Zimmermann H. Nielsen S. Bernard H.U. Kouzarides T. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3574-3581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, a recent study using heteronuclear NMR methods to monitor the intermolecular interactions between the activation domain of p53 and C/H3 showed that the binding affinity was weak (K D = 300 μm) (24De Guzman R.N. Liu H.Y. Martinez-Yamout M. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This result suggests that p53 may make additional contacts within the carboxyl-terminal region of CBP/p300.In this study, we set out to further characterize the interaction between p53 and the carboxyl-terminal half of CBP/p300. We were interested in determining whether another carboxyl-terminal site on CBP/p300, alone or in conjunction with C/H3, might account for the observed tight binding of p53 to this region (20Gu W. Shi X.L. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 819-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 21Avantaggiati M.L. Ogryzko V. Gardner K. Giordano A. Levine A.S. Kelly K.

Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3693-3696PubMed Google Scholar). We have identified a new p53-interacting domain on CBP (aa 2055–2150) and p300 (aa 1970–2193), which we have named CR2. This region corresponds precisely with a domain present on both CBP and p300 that is utilized by steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC1) in activated transcription by liganded nuclear hormone receptors (26Kraus W.L. Manning E.T. Kadonaga J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8123-8135Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 27Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W.

Biol. 2001; 21: 39-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this region has been shown to be an important interaction site for numerous transcription factors, including IRF-3 and HTLV-I Tax (29Scoggin K.E. Ulloa A. Nyborg J.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5520-5530Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 30Lin C.H. Hare B.J. Wagner G. Harrison S.C. Maniatis T. Fraenkel E. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 581-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Recently, the solution structure of this domain (IBiD) was solved using heteronuclear NMR and was shown to be composed of three tightly compacted α-helices (30Lin C.H. Hare B.J. Wagner G. Harrison S.C. Maniatis T. Fraenkel E. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 581-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). A mutation in CBP that resides in the first of the three α-helices in the CR2 region significantly reduces the interaction with p53. We also show that p53 binds to the CR2 domain present in the highly homologous coactivator p300. Importantly, deletion of this region in full-length p300 strongly compromises p53-mediated transcriptional activation in vitro from a template carrying the Mdm2 promoter assembled into chromatin. We identify the first 107 amino acids of p53, which carries the tripartite activation domain, as those involved in the CR2 interaction. Finally, we show that p53 and the HTLV-I Tax protein compete for interaction with CR2 in vitro, possibly contributing to the previously reported Tax repression of p53 transcription function (19Van Orden K.

Virol. 1998; 72: 8852-8860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONIn this report, we show that p53 interacts strongly with the carboxyl-terminal region 2 (CR2) of CBP, located between amino acids 2055 and 2150. We also demonstrate that p53 interacts with the corresponding CR2 region of p300, located between amino acids 1970 and 2193. The CR2 region is distinct from the C/H3 domain, the only previously identified region within the carboxyl-terminal half of CBP that has been shown to interact with p53 (24De Guzman R.N. Liu H.Y. Martinez-Yamout M. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 25O'Connor M.J. Zimmermann H. Nielsen S. Bernard H.U. Kouzarides T. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3574-3581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In our assays, p53 interacted more strongly with CR2 than with the region of CBP that encompasses the C/H3 domain (CR1; aa 1514–1894). We mapped the minimal CR2 region of CBP required for strong interaction with p53 to amino acids 2055–2150. This 95-amino acid minimal CR2 sequence corresponds precisely with the SRC1-interacting domain of CBP, which has been mapped to amino acids 2058–2130 (28Sheppard H.M. Harries J.C. Hussain S. Bevan C. Heery D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 39-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This domain also corresponds to the CBP region involved in binding to IRF-3 and HTLV-I Tax (29Scoggin K.E. Ulloa A. Nyborg J.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5520-5530Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 30Lin C.H. Hare B.J. Wagner G. Harrison S.C. Maniatis T. Fraenkel E. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 581-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We show that a CR2 double point mutation (L2068A/L2071A), which specifically disrupts the first of the three α-helices that resides within this region (30Lin C.H. Hare B.J. Wagner G. Harrison S.C. Maniatis T. Fraenkel E. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 581-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), reduces interaction with p53.The amino-terminal 107 amino acids of p53 at least partially participate in protein·protein interaction with CR2. This is consistent with our observation that CR2 binds well to full-length p53·DNA complexes, suggesting that the DNA binding and tetramerization domains are not involved in CR2 recognition. Previous studies have indicated that the p53 activation domain participates in binding to the KIX domain (19Van Orden K. Giebler H.A. Lemasson I. Gonzales M. Nyborg J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26321-26328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and C/H3 domain of CBP (20Gu W. Shi X.L. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 819-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 23Scolnick D.M. Chehab N.H. Stavridi E.S. Lien M.C. Caruso L. Moran E. Berger S.L. Halazonetis T.D. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3693-3696PubMed Google Scholar). We tested whether a minimal region of the p53 activation domain might interact with CR2 using a double point mutant of p53 (L22Q/W23S). Although we did not observe a significant decrease in the CR2·p53 interaction using this mutant, the activation domain of p53 is tripartite, and extends through the first 100 amino acids of the protein. Therefore, other amino acids that reside within this amino-terminal region of p53 likely participate in CR2 complex formation.Our in vitro transcription studies clearly show that p53 interaction with the p300 CR2 domain is relevant to p53 transcription function. The addition of p300 and p53 strongly stimulated RNA synthesis from the p53-responsive Mdm2 P2 promoter assembled into chromatin. However, the p300 deletion mutant p300ΔSRC was significantly reduced in its ability to mediate coactivator function. Our observation that p300ΔSRC retained partial coactivator function in p53-mediated transcription may reflect the ability of p53 to recruit CBP/p300 to the Mdm2 promoter via interaction with other coactivator domains (such as KIX and/or C/H3) (19Van Orden K.

Thein vitro transcription result was corroborated using transient transfection assays, confirming a functional role for the CR2 domain in mediating p53 transcription function in vivo.Previous studies have shown that the HTLV-I Tax protein inhibits many of the tumor suppressor functions of p53 (31Akagi T.

Blood. 1997; 90: 4924-4932Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several recent studies suggest that this may occur through competition for CBP/p300 (19Van Orden K. Giebler H.A. Lemasson I. Gonzales M. Nyborg J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26321-26328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 56Suzuki T. Uchida-Toita M. Yoshida M.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1491-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that, like p53, Tax also recognizes the CR2 region of CBP/p300 (29Scoggin K.E. Ulloa A. Nyborg J.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5520-5530Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that both Tax and p53 bind mutually exclusively to this region. Using a competition binding assay, we directly show that Tax specifically disrupts the p53·CR2 interaction, providing further evidence for coactivator competition between these two proteins. It appears that both proteins recognize the same surface structure of CR2, because p53 and Tax are unable to bind the CR2 domain that harbors the double point mutation (L2068A/L2071A) (shown in Fig. 2 B, and Ref. 29Scoggin K.E. Ulloa A. Nyborg J.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5520-5530Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Together, these data provide further evidence for a model of Tax repression of p53 transcription function mediated through direct competition, at multiple sites, for CBP/p300. This coactivator competition between Tax and p53 may contribute to the molecular mechanism of HTLV-I-associated malignant transformation. CBP and the highly related protein p300 are very large, highly conserved coactivator proteins that serve to mediate the regulation of gene expression in metazoans. Many transcriptional regulatory pathways converge at CBP and p300 (1Goodman R.H. Smolik S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577PubMed Google Scholar, 2Shikama N. Lyon J.

These include pathways that are required for development and differentiation, response to hormonal stimulation, apoptosis, and tumor suppression. A significant number of transcription factors, such as Mdm2, BRCA1, HTLV-I Tax, and SRC1,1 have been demonstrated to interact with CBP/p300, with several binding at multiple sites on the coactivators (5Van Orden K. Nyborg J.K. Gene Expr. 2000; 9: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The functional significance of these multivalent activator/coactivator interactions is currently unknown. p53 is a sequence-specific, DNA-binding transcription factor that induces apoptosis or cell cycle arrest in response to genotoxic stress, thus blocking the transmission of DNA mutations to progeny cells (6Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar). Loss of p53 activity has been identified in 60% of the human malignancies examined (7Harris N. Brill E.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2508-2518Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Interestingly, CBP and p300 have also been shown to acetylate p53 at lysine residues 373 and 382 (17Gu W. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1997; 90: 595-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2152) Google Scholar). Although acetylated p53 binds short fragments of DNA with a higher affinity than the unacetylated form, this modification does not appear to significantly affect p53 DNA binding activity on chromatin assembled templates (18Espinosa J.M. Emerson B.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 57-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). These observations serve to illustrate a prominent role for CBP/p300 in mediating the tumor suppressor functions of p53. However, the molecular details of the physical interaction between the activator and coactivator remain elusive. Several previous studies have indicated that p53 specifically binds to multiple sites on the coactivator, including the KIX domain (19Van Orden K. Giebler H.A. Lemasson I. Gonzales M. Nyborg J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26321-26328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and an ill-defined carboxyl-terminal region of CBP/p300 (20Gu W. Shi X.L. Roeder R.G.

Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3693-3696PubMed Google Scholar). The amino-terminal activation domain of p53 has been shown to participate in each of these coactivator interactions (19Van Orden K. Giebler H.A. Lemasson I. Gonzales M. Nyborg J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26321-26328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 24De Guzman R.N. Liu H.Y. Martinez-Yamout M. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In studies that attempted to elucidate the precise carboxyl-terminal region of CBP/p300 involved in p53 binding, only the C/H3 domain of CBP (approximate aa 1764–1850; also called TAZ2 and TRAM) has emerged as a site of p53 interaction (25O'Connor M.J. Zimmermann H. Nielsen S. Bernard H.U. Kouzarides T. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3574-3581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, a recent study using heteronuclear NMR methods to monitor the intermolecular interactions between the activation domain of p53 and C/H3 showed that the binding affinity was weak (K D = 300 μm) (24De Guzman R.N. Liu H.Y. Martinez-Yamout M. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This result suggests that p53 may make additional contacts within the carboxyl-terminal region of CBP/p300. In this study, we set out to further characterize the interaction between p53 and the carboxyl-terminal half of CBP/p300. We were interested in determining whether another carboxyl-terminal site on CBP/p300, alone or in conjunction with C/H3, might account for the observed tight binding of p53 to this region (20Gu W. Shi X.L. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 819-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 21Avantaggiati M.L. Ogryzko V. Gardner K. Giordano A. Levine A.S. Kelly K.

This region corresponds precisely with a domain present on both CBP and p300 that is utilized by steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC1) in activated transcription by liganded nuclear hormone receptors (26Kraus W.L. Manning E.T. Kadonaga J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8123-8135Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 27Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W.

Biol. 2001; 21: 39-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this region has been shown to be an important interaction site for numerous transcription factors, including IRF-3 and HTLV-I Tax (29Scoggin K.E. Ulloa A. Nyborg J.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5520-5530Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 30Lin C.H. Hare B.J. Wagner G. Harrison S.C. Maniatis T. Fraenkel E. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 581-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Recently, the solution structure of this domain (IBiD) was solved using heteronuclear NMR and was shown to be composed of three tightly compacted α-helices (30Lin C.H. Hare B.J. Wagner G. Harrison S.C. Maniatis T. Fraenkel E. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 581-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). A mutation in CBP that resides in the first of the three α-helices in the CR2 region significantly reduces the interaction with p53. We also show that p53 binds to the CR2 domain present in the highly homologous coactivator p300. Importantly, deletion of this region in full-length p300 strongly compromises p53-mediated transcriptional activation in vitro from a template carrying the Mdm2 promoter assembled into chromatin. We identify the first 107 amino acids of p53, which carries the tripartite activation domain, as those involved in the CR2 interaction. Finally, we show that p53 and the HTLV-I Tax protein compete for interaction with CR2 in vitro, possibly contributing to the previously reported Tax repression of p53 transcription function (19Van Orden K. Giebler H.A. Lemasson I. Gonzales M. Nyborg J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26321-26328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 31Akagi T. Ono H. Tsuchida N. Shimotohno K.

DISCUSSIONIn this report, we show that p53 interacts strongly with the carboxyl-terminal region 2 (CR2) of CBP, located between amino acids 2055 and 2150. We also demonstrate that p53 interacts with the corresponding CR2 region of p300, located between amino acids 1970 and 2193. The CR2 region is distinct from the C/H3 domain, the only previously identified region within the carboxyl-terminal half of CBP that has been shown to interact with p53 (24De Guzman R.N. Liu H.Y. Martinez-Yamout M. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 25O'Connor M.J. Zimmermann H. Nielsen S. Bernard H.U. Kouzarides T. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3574-3581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In our assays, p53 interacted more strongly with CR2 than with the region of CBP that encompasses the C/H3 domain (CR1; aa 1514–1894). We mapped the minimal CR2 region of CBP required for strong interaction with p53 to amino acids 2055–2150. This 95-amino acid minimal CR2 sequence corresponds precisely with the SRC1-interacting domain of CBP, which has been mapped to amino acids 2058–2130 (28Sheppard H.M. Harries J.C. Hussain S. Bevan C. Heery D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 39-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This domain also corresponds to the CBP region involved in binding to IRF-3 and HTLV-I Tax (29Scoggin K.E. Ulloa A. Nyborg J.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5520-5530Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 30Lin C.H. Hare B.J. Wagner G. Harrison S.C. Maniatis T. Fraenkel E. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 581-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We show that a CR2 double point mutation (L2068A/L2071A), which specifically disrupts the first of the three α-helices that resides within this region (30Lin C.H. Hare B.J. Wagner G. Harrison S.C. Maniatis T. Fraenkel E. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 581-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), reduces interaction with p53.The amino-terminal 107 amino acids of p53 at least partially participate in protein·protein interaction with CR2. This is consistent with our observation that CR2 binds well to full-length p53·DNA complexes, suggesting that the DNA binding and tetramerization domains are not involved in CR2 recognition. Previous studies have indicated that the p53 activation domain participates in binding to the KIX domain (19Van Orden K. Giebler H.A. Lemasson I. Gonzales M. Nyborg J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26321-26328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and C/H3 domain of CBP (20Gu W. Shi X.L. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 819-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 23Scolnick D.M. Chehab N.H. Stavridi E.S. Lien M.C. Caruso L. Moran E. Berger S.L. Halazonetis T.D. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3693-3696PubMed Google Scholar). We tested whether a minimal region of the p53 activation domain might interact with CR2 using a double point mutant of p53 (L22Q/W23S). Although we did not observe a significant decrease in the CR2·p53 interaction using this mutant, the activation domain of p53 is tripartite, and extends through the first 100 amino acids of the protein. Therefore, other amino acids that reside within this amino-terminal region of p53 likely participate in CR2 complex formation.Our in vitro transcription studies clearly show that p53 interaction with the p300 CR2 domain is relevant to p53 transcription function. The addition of p300 and p53 strongly stimulated RNA synthesis from the p53-responsive Mdm2 P2 promoter assembled into chromatin. However, the p300 deletion mutant p300ΔSRC was significantly reduced in its ability to mediate coactivator function. Our observation that p300ΔSRC retained partial coactivator function in p53-mediated transcription may reflect the ability of p53 to recruit CBP/p300 to the Mdm2 promoter via interaction with other coactivator domains (such as KIX and/or C/H3) (19Van Orden K.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5520-5530Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that both Tax and p53 bind mutually exclusively to this region. Using a competition binding assay, we directly show that Tax specifically disrupts the p53·CR2 interaction, providing further evidence for coactivator competition between these two proteins. It appears that both proteins recognize the same surface structure of CR2, because p53 and Tax are unable to bind the CR2 domain that harbors the double point mutation (L2068A/L2071A) (shown in Fig. 2 B, and Ref. 29Scoggin K.E. Ulloa A. Nyborg J.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5520-5530Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Together, these data provide further evidence for a model of Tax repression of p53 transcription function mediated through direct competition, at multiple sites, for CBP/p300. This coactivator competition between Tax and p53 may contribute to the molecular mechanism of HTLV-I-associated malignant transformation.

https://openalex.org/W2075663382,"Insulin inhibits the expression of the hepatic insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) genes. The signaling pathway that mediates these events requires the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, whereas transfection studies have suggested an involvement of Akt (protein kinase B) and FKHR, a transcription factor regulated by Akt. We now demonstrate that insulin repression of endogenous IGFBP-1 gene transcription was blocked by rapamycin or by amino acid starvation. Rapamycin inhibited the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and the subsequent activation of p70/p85 S6 protein kinase-1 (S6K1) by insulin, whereas amino acid depletion prevented insulin induction of these signaling molecules. Importantly, we demonstrate that insulin regulation of the thymine-rich insulin response element of the IGFBP-1 promoter was also inhibited by rapamycin. However, sustained activation of S6K1 did not repress this promoter. In addition, rapamycin did not affect insulin regulation of G6Pase expression or Akt activation. We propose that these observations indicate that an mTOR-dependent, but S6K-independent mechanism regulates the suppression of IGFBP-1 (but not G6Pase) gene expression by insulin. Therefore, although the insulin-responsive sequence of the G6Pase gene promoter is related to that of the IGFBP-1 promoter, the signaling pathways that mediate suppression of these genes are distinct."

These observations suggest that expression of the PSACH and EDM1 cellular phenotype results, at least in part, from improper protein processing/trafficking in chondrocytes. COMP is a homopentamer composed of multidomain subunits. Each subunit consists of four domains as follows: an N-terminal association domain, followed by an epidermal growth factor-like type 2 repeat domain, a Ca2+-binding type 3 repeat domain, and a C-terminal globular domain. Interestingly, 72 of 76 known disease-causing mutations in COMP are localized to the type 3 repeat Ca2+binding domain, and the majority of these are found in the C-terminal portion of this domain (8Maddox B.K.

First, mutations may compromise the function of COMP. Second, mutations may cause gain of aberrant intracellular function or undesirable protein-protein interactions. A third possibility is that mutations may induce improper folding that leads to aggregation of partially folded intermediates or undesirable nonspecific interactions between mutant COMP and other proteins in the rER. Such a mechanism would be dominant negative and would be independent of the normal function of COMP. To investigate these potential mechanisms, we have initiated a study to provide detailed information on the structural consequence of mutations in the Ca2+-binding type 3 repeat domain of COMP. This domain has 13 Ca2+-binding loops that conform to the consensus sequence of an EF hand Ca2+-binding loop such as those found in calmodulin and troponin C (13Strynadka N.C.J. James M.N.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 951-998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A typical EF hand, or helix-loop-helix Ca2+-binding motif, consists of a calcium-binding loop flanked by helices of 10–12 amino acids. In contrast, 5 pairs of putative Ca2+-binding loops in COMP are separated by only 1 or 3 amino acids. Thus, the Ca2+binding domain in COMP and other thrombospondins represent a novel utilization of the EF hand Ca2+-binding loop. We report here comparative analysis of the wild type and mutant COMP Ca2+ binding domains, with a focus on the C-terminal 11-kDa subdomain that incurs the majority of disease-causing mutations. The recombinant mutant proteins have Asp-470 2The literature typically refers to this mutation as deletion of Asp-469, which is the first of a cluster of five Asp-(469–473) residues encoded by GAC codons. We refer to the mutation here as deletion of Asp-470 because the net effect of deletion of any one of these 5 Asp residues is removal of the single Asp residue (Asp-470) that separates calcium-binding loops 10 and 11. deleted; a mutation that is found in 22% of all PSACH and EDM1 patients. The data are consistent with a model in which removal of Ca2+ or mutation leads to a loss of defined structure in the Ca2+binding domain of COMP. Selected regions of the COMP cDNA were amplified by PCR and inserted into the expression plasmid pET23d. All recombinant proteins encoded Ala as the second amino acid to enhance overall expression in Escherichia coliBL21pLys. The COMP derivatives could be easily isolated by standard procedures developed for cardiac troponin C (14Putkey J.A. Sweeney H.L. Campbell S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12370-12378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were grown and induced as described previously (15Lin X. Krudy G.A. Howarth J. Brito R.M.M. Rosevear P.R. Putkey J.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14434-14442Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) in either L-broth or M9 media prepared using 15N-ammonium chloride. Cells from 4 liters of culture were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 120 ml of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.2 mm EGTA, 0.1% BME. Resuspended cells were frozen at −70 °C, thawed, and then sonicated using a Branson sonicator with medium tip 3 times for 5 min at 50% power and 80% duty cycle while kept on ice. The lysed cells are centrifuged at 45,000 rpm in a Beckman Ti45 rotor. All COMP derivatives are found in the soluble fraction. Soluble proteins were applied to a 2.5 × 30-cm Macro-Q (Bio-Rad) anion exchange column at a flow rate of 5 ml/min. The column was washed with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1% BME until a base-lineA 280 was achieved. Bound proteins were then eluted by a linear 100–500 mm KCl gradient (5 ml/min for 120 min). Fractions containing COMP proteins were pooled and made 1m in ammonium sulfate, which precipitates most proteins but leave COMP soluble. After centrifugation, the soluble fraction was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mmKCl, 0.1% BME, 2 mm CaCl2, and then applied to a Water semi-preparative DEAE Protein Pak high performance liquid chromatography column. After washing, the bound proteins were eluted with a 100–500 mm KCl gradient. Fractions containing COMP were pooled, dialyzed against 20 mm, ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0, 10 mm DTT, and lyophilized. The lyophilized proteins were refolded in vitro by first resuspending in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 8 m guanidine HCl, 10 mm DTT, 2 mm CaCl2. This was then diluted 50–100-fold into 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 20 mm CaCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm oxidized DTT at room temperature. The refolded protein was concentrated and dialyzed against the buffer of choice for a given experiment. Proteins were analyzed by electrospray mass spectroscopy to confirm sequence and by amino acid analysis to determine protein concentration. The N-terminal Met residue was removed by the bacteria. Refolded proteins were transferred to a buffer of 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm oxidized DTT and concentrated to a protein concentration of about 4 mg/ml. A 1-ml volume of protein was placed in a Slidylizer (Pierce) dialysis cassette and dialyzed at room temperature against the same buffer containing trace amounts of45CaCl2. The time necessary to reach equilibrium was determined using a control Slidylizer that did not contain protein. Under these conditions the free Ca2+ was set by the total concentration of Ca2+ in the buffer reservoir. After equilibrium, 0.1 ml was removed from the buffer reservoir and from each Slidylizer, and the cassettes were transferred to another buffer reservoir containing a lower total Ca2+concentration. This procedure was repeated to collect data points at 2, 1, 0.5, 0.25, and 0.1 mm free Ca2+. Protein remaining after the final dialysis was analyzed by SDS-PAGE to assess potential degradation. The concentration of protein at each level of free CaCl2 was determined using the Pierce BCA assay. COMP proteins, the concentration of which had been determined by amino acid analysis, were used as standards for the protein assays. CD spectra were collected on a JASCO J-710 spectrofluorimeter using a cylindrical cuvette with a 0.5-mm path length. Proteins that were refolded in vitro were dialyzed against 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm reduced DTT, 0.1 mm oxidized DTT, 2 mm CaCl2, and then diluted to a concentration of 5–20 μm in the same buffer. CD spectra were collected before and after the addition of 3 mm EDTA. NMR spectroscopy was carried out on a Bruker Avance DRX 600, or Varian Unity Plus 600 spectrometers equipped with a inverse triple resonance gradient probes. Proteins used for NMR samples varied in protein concentration from 1 to 2 mm and were exchanged into a NMR buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 100 mm KCl, 20 mm CaCl2, 10 mm reduced DTT, 1 mm oxidized DTT (presence or absence of oxidized DTT did not greatly affect chemical shifts) in a 9:1 ratio of H2O to 2H2O by repeated washing in a Millipore Ultrafree-4 Centrifugal Filter Unit with high flow Biomax membrane. Repeated washing with the CaCl2-containing buffer allowed the concentration of free CaCl2 in the NMR sample to remain at 20 mm. Thus the total CaCl2 in the NMR samples was 20 mm plus the amount of CaCl2 bound to the protein. Apoproteins were generated by washing into a buffer that contained 1 mm EDTA rather than CaCl2. Preparation of apoproteins consisted of repeated washing with NMR buffer containing 1 mm EDTA to the NMR sample. All experiments were carried out at 298 K and a pH of 6.8. HSQC spectra were acquired with spectral widths of 11,000 Hz for 1H and 2000 Hz for 15N. A total of 2048 data points int 2 and 128 t 1 points were used for the HSQC experiments. 1H chemical shifts were referenced to 3-(trimethylsilyl)-1-propanesulfonic acid.15N chemical shifts were referenced indirectly by using the gyromagnetic ratio. The NMR data were processed on a PC work station using FELIX2001 (Accelrys, San Diego, CA) The domain organization of COMP monomers is shown in Fig.1 A. Epidermal growth factor-like and globular domains flank the type 3 repeat Ca2+ binding domain. Fig. 1 B illustrates consensus sequences in the Ca2+-binding loops and the longer interloop regions of human COMP, as well as the pattern of Cys residues in the type 3 repeat. There are 13 potential Ca2+-binding loops that conform to the consensus sequence of an EF hand Ca2+-binding loop. The longer interloop sequences are rich in Pro residues, which likely inhibit formation of α-helices found in typical EF hands. Five of the interloop spacers consist of only 1 or 3 amino acids. Fig. 1 C summarizes the proteins used in this study. The protein called T3 encodes amino acids 302–524 (loops 2–13) and was described previously (16Hou J. Putkey J.A. Hecht J.T. Cell Calcium. 2000; 27: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The N- and C-terminal regions of the type 3 repeat have distinguishing characteristics. This includes a different distribution of short and long interloop spacers, different patterns of Cys residues, and the presence of His residues only in the C-terminal half. These features, together with the fact that 66% of disease-causing mutations are located in the C-terminal half of the type three repeat, led us to construct an expression plasmid for an 11-kDa protein called T3-Cterm which encodes amino acids 420–524 (loops 8–13). A pair of mutated derivatives, T3ΔD and T3-CtermΔD, was generated in which Asp-470 was deleted to mimic the most common disease-causing mutation. The net effect of this mutation was to remove the single amino acid between loops 10 and 11. We used a bacterial system to express COMP proteins because it provides high levels of expression and efficient labeling of proteins with stable isotopes required for multidimensional heteronuclear NMR. Tissue-derived human COMP is glycosylated at residues 101, 124, and 721, which are outside the type 3 repeat (17Zaia J. Boynton R.E. McIntosh A. Marshak D.R. Olsson H. Heinegard D. Barry F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14120-14126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The native folding environment of COMP in the rER is rich in Ca2+ and contains chaperones such as protein-disulfide isomerase, which may aid in the proper folding of the Cys-rich type 3 repeat. In contrast, the intracellular environment of bacteria is low in Ca2+ and high in reducing potential. The proteins used in this study have all been refolded in vitro as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 2 shows an SDS gel of the purified native and mutant proteins. Both T3 and T3-Cterm proteins migrate with apparent relative molecular masses that are greater than predicted from primary sequence. The molecular weight of the recombinant proteins was confirmed by electrospray mass spectroscopy. Typically, the Ca2+-binding properties of proteins are determined by sequential addition of Ca2+ to the apoprotein. Unlike regulatory EF hand proteins that are designed to cycle between apo- and Ca2+-bound forms, COMP may require Ca2+ to maintain a proper structure that is not readily regained if Ca2+ is removed from the folded protein and then replenished. Thus, we generated Ca2+-binding isotherms for recombinant COMP proteins by sequential dilution of Ca2+ after the proteins had been refolded in the presence of Ca2+. Fig. 3 compares the Ca2+-binding curves of T3 and T3-Cterm with T3ΔD and T3-CtermΔD. T3 binds 12–13 mol of Ca2+ per mol of protein with a K 50,Ca of about 0.25 mm. T3-Cterm binds 8–9 mol of Ca2+ per mol of protein with a K 50,Ca of about 0.5 mm. The mutant T3ΔD and T3-CtermΔD bind less Ca2+ than the wild type proteins at all concentrations of free Ca2+, and with slightly lower affinity. At 2 mm Ca2+ both T3 and T3-Cterm bind about 3 more mol of Ca2+/mol of protein than the mutated derivatives. This suggests that the effect of deletion of Asp-470 in the C-terminal half of the type 3 repeat domain is restricted to Ca2+-binding sites in this subdomain. The predicted secondary structure of T3-Cterm (PSIPRED V2.0) indicates a high content of coiled structures. To confirm this, we performed circular dichroism on all proteins in the presence and absence of Ca2+ as an initial screen for differences in protein structure. Preliminary NMR studies indicated that low ionic strength has a significant effect on the structure of T3-Cterm. Because chloride ions interfere with CD measurements in the far UV range, and because fluoride precipitates with Ca2+, we performed all measurements in 100 mm KCl and show CD spectra from 195 to 240 nm. Fig. 4compares the CD spectra of the wild type and mutant T3 proteins (Fig.4 A) and T3-Cterm (Fig. 4 B). The large negative ellipticity at 200 nm and small negative values at 220 nm indicate high content of coiled secondary structure and relatively little helical structure for all proteins. The CD data shows several overall trends for T3 and T3-Cterm proteins. The wild type proteins displayed an increase in negative ellipticity at ∼200 nm and a shift to higher wavelength upon addition of Ca2+ to the apoproteins. Unlike the wild type proteins, mutant ΔD proteins behaved differently. Addition of Ca2+ to apoT3ΔD resulted in a decrease in negative ellipticity at ∼200 nm, a similar shift to higher wavelength as seen for wild type T3, and less change than T3 in [θ] at all higher wavelengths. T3-CtermΔD exhibited similar characteristics as T3ΔD at ∼200 nm upon Ca2+ addition but to a greater degree. Unlike T3-Cterm, there is a substantial decrease in ellipticity at all wavelengths for T3-CtermΔD. The data suggest the T3-Cterm proteins undergo different structural transitions in response to Ca2+. The changes observed for T3-Cterm could represent an unfolded to folded transition, but for T3-CtermΔD the results are most consistent with an unfolded to aggregated transition. CD measures the sum of secondary structures in a protein. It is sensitive to structural changes, but it does not provide great insight into the nature of these changes. We employed heteronuclear NMR to determine the effect of Ca2+ and mutation on the structure of the type 3 repeat. The focus of the present study is T3-Cterm because it incurs the majority of disease-causing mutations. All spectra were collected using proteins that had been refoldedin vitro in the presence of Ca2+ and a 10:1 ratio of reduced and oxidized DTT (1/0.1 mm). Subsequent addition of excess DTT to the refolded protein did not greatly affect the NMR spectra (data not shown). Calcium was removed from the refolded protein to generate the apoform by sequential dilution and concentration with a buffer containing EDTA. Fig. 5 compares the amide region of the one-dimensional proton spectra for wild type T3-Cterm (Fig.5 A) and T3-CtermΔD (Fig. 5 B) in the presence and absence of Ca2+. The spectrum of Ca2+-bound T3-Cterm is well dispersed with a number of distinct down field-shifted resonances. Removal of Ca2+ from wild type T3-Cterm dramatically reduces or eliminates the down field shifted resonances and generally decreases resonance dispersion. Spectra for the mutant T3-CtermΔD show little evidence of the down field shifted resonances, and the resonances are much less dispersed than for wild type T3-Cterm in the presence or absence of Ca2+. The two groups of chemical shifts at about 6.8 and 7.6 ppm correspond to the side chain amides of Gln and Asn residues. Thus, chemical shifts of the backbone HN for apoT3-Cterm and T3-ΔD in the presence or absence of Ca2+ are found in a narrow spectral window between 7.8 and 8.8 ppm. This lack of dispersion is characteristic of unstructured protein (18Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 499-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Fig. 6, A andB, shows the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of T3-Cterm in the presence and absence of Ca2+, respectively. The spectrum of Ca2+-bound T3-Cterm is well dispersed and characteristic of a protein with defined structure. 93 cross-peaks (excluding side chain amides) resolved at this contour level, which agrees well with the 96 backbone amide protons predicted from the primary sequence. The spectrum shows 19 cross-peaks down field of 9.0 ppm in the proton dimension. These down field resonances likely correspond to protons that participate in strong hydrogen-bonded structures, such as β-sheets. Four of the down field cross-peaks are identified as the HN protons of the four glycine residues at the 6th position of Ca2+-binding loops 9–12. 3Identification of the Gly residues was made by assigning the neighboring spin systems of each Gly in Ca2+-bound 15N,13C-enriched T3 C-term using triple resonance experiments HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, C(CO)NH, and H(CCO)NH. The HNchemical shifts of Gly residues in the 6th position of EF hand Ca2+-binding loops of calmodulin and troponin C shift down field in the presence of Ca2+ (19Krudy G.A. Brito R.M.M. Putkey J.A.

Removal of Ca2+ causes a significant spectral change that is dominated by a substantial decrease of dispersion in the proton dimension (Fig.6 B). This is consistent with the one-dimensional spectra in Fig. 5. Most notably, all of the down field resonances seen in the presence of Ca2+ are absent upon removal of Ca2+. There is little overlap of resonances between the spectra for T3-Cterm in the presence and absence of Ca2+. Fig. 6, C and D, shows the1H-15N HSQC spectra for T3-CtermΔD in the presence and absence of Ca2+, respectively. In contrast to wild type T3-Cterm, the mutant protein shows little resonance dispersion in the presence of Ca2+. The 19 down field cross-peaks seen for the wild type protein in the presence of Ca2+ are absent at this contour level in T3-Cterm ΔD. Removal of Ca2+ from T3-CtermΔD has little effect on the1H-15N HSQC spectra. Fig. 6 suggests that T3-Cterm assumes an unstructured or multiply structured state. A similar conclusion can be drawn in the absence or presence of Ca2+ for the Asp-470 deletion mutant. Fig. 7 compares the down field region of the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum for Ca2+-bound T3-Cterm (black) and the 27-kDa T3 (red). It is clear that all resonances in T3-Cterm are present in the spectrum for T3 with identical chemical shifts. Coincidence of cross-peaks is also seen in other regions of the spectra. Only three resonances in the spectra for Ca2+bound T3-Cterm do not overlap with corresponding resonances in T3 (data not shown). Thus, we conclude that Ca2+-bound T3-Cterm assumes a single dominant conformation in solution and that T3-Cterm is an independently folding subdomain of the larger type 3 repeat Ca2+ binding domain in COMP. We wished to collect 1H-15N HSQC spectra for T3-Cterm at sub-saturating levels of Ca2+. Rather than add Ca2+ to the apoprotein, which may not readily refold under conditions used to collect NMR spectra, we elected to dilute Ca2+ in a sample that had been refolded in the presence of calcium. The total Ca2+ in a 2 mm sample of T3-Cterm was diluted to a final predicted total Ca2+concentration of 0.1 mm by sequential rounds of dilution and concentration. Fig. 8 Acompares the spectra of the same protein at high (black) or low (red) concentrations of Ca2+. All resonances observed at saturating Ca2+ are also present at the lower Ca2+ concentration, but the relative intensities were about 30% those observed for the Ca2+-saturated protein. At the lower concentration of Ca2+, additional resonances are observed between 7.8 and 8.8 ppm that are characteristic of the apoprotein. Fig. 8 B expands the boxed region inA. The cross-peaks in B are the sum of resonances observed in spectra of the Ca2+-saturated (C) and apoproteins (D). The presence of distinct structured and unstructured populations at sub-saturating levels of Ca2+is typical of a slow exchange process associated with high affinity ligand binding. The equilibrium Ca2+ binding constant of COMP is on the order of 10−4m−1. Thus we were surprised to see evidence of slow exchange for COMP. Additional studies will be necessary to characterize this phenomenon. The results in Fig. 8 suggest that very low affinity binding of Ca2+ to mutated T3-CtermΔD could be detected as a minor population of protein with a dispersed HSQC spectrum. Thus,1H-15N HSQC spectra of T3-CtermΔD were analyzed at a very low contour level. Fig.9 shows this analysis in redwith the corresponding spectra of Ca2+-saturated T3-Cterm shown in black. Only the down field region of the spectral window is shown because the very intense signals at this low contour level obscure comparisons in other spectral regions. At a low contour level, dispersed cross-peaks are observed for T3-CtermΔD. The relative intensities of the cross-peaks seen for T3-CtermΔD are less than 2% those of wild type protein, and the chemical shifts are not identical between the two proteins. These data suggest that a small population of the mutant protein exists in a more structured state in the presence of 20 m"
https://openalex.org/W2062823463,"Expression levels of Gb3/CD77 synthase together with Gb3/CD77 antigen were analyzed using human hematopoietic tumor cell lines and normal cells. Among about 40 kinds of cells, Burkitt lymphoma cells showed the highest gene expression concomitant with the expression levels of Gb3/CD77. Unexpectedly, megakaryoblastic leukemia lines also expressed fairly high levels of mRNA of Gb3/CD77 synthase and its product. A megakaryoblastic leukemia line, MEG-01 was sensitive to verotoxins from Escherichia coli O157 and apoptosis was induced via the caspase pathway. We also demonstrated that the cell surface Gb3/CD77 expression was reduced on differentiated MEG-01 although the mRNA level of the α1,4Gal-T gene increased. In this case, the localization of Gb3/CD77 was changed from the cell surface to the cytoplasm as stained with a granular pattern, co-localizing with platelet GPIIb-IIIa, indicating that some of them were platelet precursors. Small particles outside of cells also showed similar staining patterns. These results agreed with the previous report that platelets produced in mature megakaryoblasts abundantly contained Gb3/CD77 antigen. Here, we propose the possibility that verotoxins bind immature megakaryoblasts and induce their apoptosis, leading to the arrest of platelet generation in the bone marrow. This may be one of the causes of thrombocytopenia in patients with hemolytic uremic syndrome.

Habeshaw J.A. Wiels J. Greaves M.F. Int. J. Cancer. 1985; 36: 561-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), suggesting that Gb3/CD77 is a differentiation antigen expressed at a very restricted stage of B cell development (8.Mangeney M.

Richard Y. Coulaud D. Tursz T. Wiels J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 1131-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Burkitt lymphoma cells expressing Gb3/CD77 were also induced to enter apoptosis upon culture at low serum concentration or cross-linking by anti-immunoglobulin M antibodies (9.Gregory C.D. Dive C. Henderson S. Smith C.A. Williams G.T. Gordon J. Rickinson A.B. Nature. 1991; 349: 612-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). These findings suggested that Gb3/CD77 is expressed on death-committed cells, or it is involved in the B cell selection. Gb3/CD77 is also well known to be a receptor for verotoxins (VTs) from Escherichia coli O157 strain, and to mediate apoptosis of vascular endothelial cells in the kidney and intestinal epithelial cells, resulting in the occurrence of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) (10.O'Brien A.O. Lively T.A. Chen M.E. Rothman S.W. Formal S.B. Lancet. 1983; 1: 702Abstract PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Molecular mechanisms for VT-induced apoptosis have been clarified, i.e. binding of the toxin B subunit (7.7 kDa) and subsequent invasion of the A subunit (32 kDa), resulting in the destruction of ribosomal RNA and the inhibition of protein synthesis (11.Endo Y. Tsurugi K. Yutsudo T. Takeda Y. Ogasawar T. Igarashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). There have been a few studies that reported a single B subunit alone can transmit the signals including that for apoptosis (12.Taga S. Carlier K. Mishal Z. Capoulade C. Mangeney M. Lecluse Y. Coulaud D. Tetaud C. Pritchard L.L. Tursz T. Wiels J. Blood. 1997; 90: 2757-2767Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gb3/CD77 is synthesized by the action of Gb3/CD77 synthase (α1,4-galactosyltransferase, α1,4Gal-T), the cDNA of which was isolated recently using a eukaryocyte expression cloning system (13.Kojima Y. Fukumoto S. Furukawa K. Okajima T. Wiels J. Yokoyama K. Suzuki Y. Urano T. Ohta M. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15152-15156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). This gene is mainly expressed in the heart, kidney, spleen, and liver in addition to placenta and testis in normal human tissues (13.Kojima Y. Fukumoto S. Furukawa K. Okajima T. Wiels J. Yokoyama K. Suzuki Y. Urano T. Ohta M. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15152-15156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), suggesting the roles of its products in the circulation and immune systems. However, genetic mechanisms for the expression of Gb3/CD77 and its implication in the hematopoietic cells have not yet been analyzed. In the present study, we analyzed the expression levels of the Gb3/CD77 synthase gene and the direct product, Gb3/CD77, in human hematopoietic tumor lines and normal cells. As expected, Burkitt lymphoma cells showed the highest expression levels of both the synthase gene and its product. Surprisingly, we found that megakaryoblastic leukemia cells also express high levels of Gb3/CD77 based on the up-regulation of the α1,4Gal-T gene, and that MEG-01, one of megakaryoblastic leukemia lines underwent apoptosis with VTs via the caspase pathway. Expression of Gb3/CD77 in platelets has been reported (14.Tao R.V. Sweeley C.C. Jamieson G.A. J. Lipid Res. 1973; 14: 16-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but there have been many arguments on the binding of verotoxins to platelets (15.Koster F. Levin J. Walker L. Tung K.S.

Blood. 2001; 97: 3100-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In particular, the sensitivity of platelets to VTs appears to be a critical point to understand the pathogenesis of HUS (18.Neild G.H. Weatherall D.J. Ledingham J.G.G. Warrell D.A. Oxford Textbook of Medicine. 3rd Ed. Oxford University Press, New York1996: 3196-3202Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrated the regulation of Gb3/CD77 antigen and the Gb3/CD77 synthase gene, and the distribution of the Gb3/CD77 antigen during induced differentiation of human megakaryoblastic leukemia cells. The implication of Gb3/CD77 expression in the megakaryoblast/platelet lineage for the pathogenesis of HUS was discussed. Cell lines used in this study were maintained in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum. Burkitt lymphoma cell lines, Ramos and HS-Sultan, myeloma cell lines, GM-1311 and IM-9 were obtained from the Japan Health Science Foundation. EBV-B cell lines were established in our laboratory. BALL-1 and NALM-1 were from Dr. Ueda at Nagoya City University. Sommer and MT-4 were from Dr. Shiku at Mie University. Megakaryoblastic leukemia cell lines, CMS, CMK, and CMY, were established at Chiba University. All other cell lines were as described previously (19.Yamashiro S. Ruan S. Furukawa K. Tai T. Lloyd K.O. Shiku H. Furukawa K. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5395-5400PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Furukawa K. Akagi T. Nagata Y. Yamada Y. Shimotohno K. Cheung N.K. Shiku H. Furukawa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Mononuclear cells were isolated from heparinized peripheral blood samples of healthy donors using Ficoll-Hypaque (Amersham Biosciences Inc.). Lymphocytes were stimulated in the presence of concanavalin A (10 μg/ml) in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal calf serum for 3 days. Erythrocytes were obtained from the sedimented layer of the Ficoll preparation, and used for flow cytometry after washing with PBS. Platelets were obtained from the platelet-rich plasma using 0.5% EDTA/PBS, and used for flow cytometric analysis using the same buffer at the washing steps. Expression of Gb3/CD77 and GPIIb-IIIa was analyzed by flow cytometry (Becton Dickinson) using mAb38.13(rat IgM) (4.Wiels J. Fellous M. Tursz T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6485-6488Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and HPL-2 (mouse IgG) (21.Hayashi K. Furukawa K. Takamoto S. Shiku H. Yamada K. Acta Haematol. 1986; 75: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) as described previously (13.Kojima Y. Fukumoto S. Furukawa K. Okajima T. Wiels J. Yokoyama K. Suzuki Y. Urano T. Ohta M.

Total RNA was prepared using TRIZOL ReagentTM (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fifteen μg each of total RNA was electrophoresed and blotted onto a nylon membrane (GeneScreen Plus) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). They were hybridized with [32P]dCTP-labeled α1,4Gal-T cDNA probe as previously described (13.Kojima Y. Fukumoto S. Furukawa K. Okajima T. Wiels J. Yokoyama K. Suzuki Y. Urano T. Ohta M. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15152-15156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed with a lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 mNaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), and 5 μg/ml aprotinin). Cell lysate (derived from 2.5 × 105 cells) was applied for SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). After blocking with 5% skim milk/PBS for 12 h at 4 °C, the membrane was incubated with the first antibody at room temperature for 1 h and then washed with T-PBS (PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20) three times, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) (New England BioLabs) for caspase 3 and horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) for GP-IIIa for 1 h. Detection was performed using an ECL system (Amersham Biosciences Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. MTT assay was performed using cells prepared in 96-well plates (5 × 103 cells/well) and cultured in the presence or absence of VT-2. The assay was performed by triplicate samples. To quantify the cell proliferation, 20 μl of 5 mg/ml MTT (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline was added to each well. After incubation for 6 h at 37 °C, 150 μl of n-propyl alcohol containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and 4 mm HCl was added. The color reaction was quantitated using an automatic plate reader IMMUNO-MINI NJ-2300 (Nihon InterMed, Tokyo, Japan) at 590 nm with a reference filter of 620 nm. MEG-01 was treated with 30 μm z-VAD-FMK (Peptide Institute Inc., Osaka, Japan) for 1 h, then cultured in the presence of VT-2 as described previously (13.Kojima Y. Fukumoto S. Furukawa K. Okajima T.

Cells were cultured in the presence or absence of VT-2 (20 ng/ml). After 24 h, 2 × 106cells were collected and the pellets were lysed in 300 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Triton X-100) for 10 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the supernatants were collected, and 2 μl of RNase (10 mg/ml) and 2 μl of Protenase K (10 mg/ml) were added. After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, the fragmented DNA was 2-propanol precipitated. Electrophoresis was conducted using precipitated DNA in a 2% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide (0.5 μg/ml), and the DNA ladder was visualized under UV. Glycolipid extraction and TLC were performed as described previously (22.Furukawa K. Clausen H. Hakomori S. Sakamoto J. Look K. Lundblad A. Mattes M.J. Lloyd K.O. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 7820-7826Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Briefly, glycolipids were extracted from 3 × 107 cells using chloroform/methanol (2:1, 1:1, and 1:2) sequentially. TLC plates (Merck, Darmstadt) using the solvent system of chloroform, methanol, 0.22% CaCl2 (60:35:8) and sprayed by orcinol. For a standard, a neutral glycolipid fraction from human erythrocytes was used (22.Furukawa K. Clausen H. Hakomori S. Sakamoto J. Look K. Lundblad A. Mattes M.J. Lloyd K.O. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 7820-7826Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Sialidase (1.25 units/ml; from Vibrio cholerae, Sigma) was added to 1 × 106 cells/0.1-ml suspension and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After treatment, cells were washed with PBS and analyzed for the expression of Gb3/CD77 with flow cytometry. To analyze the intracellular localization of Gb3/CD77 and GPIIb-IIIa, cells grown on a cover glass were fixed in cold acetone/PBS (9:1) at −20 °C for 10 min. After blocking with 5% bovine serum albumin/PBS for 1 h, they were immunostained with anti-Gb3 mAb (38.13) or anti-GPIIb-IIIa mAb (HPL-2) and FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-rat IgM or Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rat IgM (Jackson Immunoresearch LAB., Inc) for anti-Gb3 mAb and FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG for anti-GPIIb-IIIa mAb. The staining was observed using μ RadianceTM confocal imaging system (Bio-Rad). MEG-01 cells (1 × 106 cells/ml) were treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (TPA) (1 × 10−8m) for 1–3 days as described previously (23.Yamashiro S. Urano T. Shiku H. Furukawa K. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2461-2468PubMed Google Scholar). One percent suspension of human red blood cells in PBS was incubated with 0, 1.5, 6.25, 25, and 100 ng/ml VT-2 at 37 °C for 24 h, then cells were pelleted and the supernatants were collected. The visible light absorbance spectrum of the supernatants at 414 nm were determined. The supernatants of human red blood cells lysed with distilled water were used as a positive control. Twenty-nine human hematopoietic tumor cell lines, 7 EBV-transformed B cell lines, and peripheral blood cells such as mononuclear cells, erythrocytes, and platelets were examined for the surface expression of Gb3/CD77. All Burkitt lymphoma cells expressed high levels of Gb3/CD77 irrespective of EBV positivity. Accordingly, many showed very high levels of the mRNA (Fig. 1, A and B). Although one myeloma cell line exhibited high levels of mRNA, Gb3/CD77 expression was not necessarily high. Of 7 EBV-B lines, 6 showed low levels of α1,4Gal-T mRNA, while the expression levels of the product were null or very low. Then, 1 B-ALL, 6 T-ALL, 6 HTLV-I+ or ATL, 2 null ALL, 1 AproL, 1 NK-like leukemia, and 1 erythroleukemia lines were examined, none of them expressed either Gb3/CD77 or α1,4Gal-T mRNA. Surprisingly, two of 4 megakaryoblastic leukemia cell lines exhibited fairly high levels of Gb3/CD77, and the corresponding expression of the α1,4 Gal-T gene was observed in both, indicating that some populations of megakaryoblasts express Gb3/CD77. Mononuclear cells and erythrocytes were completely negative (Fig. 2). Platelets expressed very low levels of Gb3/CD77 on the cell surface. Thus, the expression levels of Gb3/CD77 mostly correlated with those of mRNA of α1,4Gal-T. Northern blots of the lactosylceramide synthase gene revealed no relationship with Gb3/CD77 expression (data not shown).Figure 2Summary of the expression of cell surface Gb3/CD77 and the α1,4Gal-T gene.

GPIIb-IIIa is the major platelet integrin receptor characterized by RGDS-dependent binding to fibronectin, von Willebrand factor, fibrinogen, and vitronectin (24.Phillips D.R. Charo I.F. Parise L.V. Fitzgerald L.A. Blood. 1988; 71: 831-843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings suggested that maturation of megakaryoblasts resulted in the reduced surface expression of Gb3/CD77. In addition, Gb3/CD77 was poorly detected in platelets, i.e. 0–7% positive in five individuals examined with flow cytometry, while GPIIb-IIIa expression was very high (Fig. 3, e and f). MEG-01 cells were exposed to VT-2 to examine the sensitivity to VT-2. Cell growth was suppressed by VT-2 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4A), and a DNA ladder was formed only in the VT-2-treated samples (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, activation of caspase 3 was also observed from 6 h after treatment (Fig. 4C). To confirm that apoptosis was induced using the caspase cascade in MEG-01, caspase inhibitor z-VAD was added to the culture medium for 1 h before treatment with VT-2. At 12 h after adding VT-2, dying MEG-01 cells were observed (Fig. 5A, middle), although MEG-01 cells pretreated with z-VAD were apparently viable and indistinguishable from the VT-untreated one (Fig. 5A, right), indicating that apoptosis of MEG-01 with VT-2 was mediated via the caspase cascade. The activated caspase 3 (17 kDa) was detected in the lysate of MEG-01 cultured with VT-2, although the activated form was not detected in the sample treated with z-VAD (Fig. 5B). In addition, platelets were treated with VTs in PBS or fetal calf serum-containing medium for 24 h, showing no morphological changes at any conditions at all (Fig. 5A).Figure 5Inhibition of VT-2-induced apoptosis of MEG-01 with caspase-3 inhibitor.

MEG-01 was cultured in the presence of VT-2 with (lane 3) or without (lane 2) z-VAD for 12 h and the lysate were applied for Western immunoblotting with anti-caspase-3 polyclonal Ab (CPP32) and horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit IgG.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Then, Gb3/CD77 expression during the induced differentiation of MEG-01 cells was analyzed. The differentiation after TPA treatment was confirmed by the increased expression of GPIIb-IIIa as well as characteristic morphological changes (data not shown) as previously reported (23.Yamashiro S. Urano T. Shiku H. Furukawa K. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2461-2468PubMed Google Scholar). Along with the differentiation, surface expression of Gb3/CD77 was reduced (Fig. 6). This result was in good accordance with the reciprocal expression pattern of Gb3/CD77 and GPIIb-IIIa detected among several megakaryoblastic leukemia cell lines (Fig. 3). To investigate the transcriptional regulation of the α1,4Gal-T gene during the induced differentiation, Northern blotting was performed. As shown in Fig. 7, the mRNA levels were relatively increased at 1 day after TPA treatment and sustained high levels, suggesting that the total amount of Gb3/CD77 might not be decreased, although Gb3/CD77 expression at the cell surface was reduced. To analyze total amount of Gb3/CD77 in MEG-01 before and after TPA treatment, neutral glycolipid fractions were compared on TLC. Gb3/CD77 was a major component in the neutral glycolipids in MEG-01, and the intensity of Gb3/CD77 bands after TPA treatment was increased compared with that of untreated cells (Fig. 7C). Western immunoblotting of GPIIb-IIIa revealed the induced expression of GPIIIa after TPA treatment coincidently with cell surface expression of GPIIb-IIIa (Fig. 7D). Cell surface expression of Gb3/CD77 on TPA-treated MEG-01 was decreased, and whether the increased Gb3 crypticity induced its reduced cell surface expression was analyzed by sialidase treatment of MEG-01 at 2 days after TPA treatment. Surface expression of Gb3/CD77 was slightly increased after sialidase treatment, but not so much as TPA untreated MEG-01, indicating that increased crypticity did not contribute so much in the reduction of the surface expression of Gb3/CD77 (Fig. 8A). The effects of the sialidase treatment on the GPIIb-IIIa expression was also analyzed, showing no change (Fig. 8B). The sialidase from Clostridium perfringens showed essentially the same results. The efficiency of the sialidase treatment was confirmed by loss of GD3 expression on SK-MEL-28 melanoma cells after sialidase treatment with the same condition (data not shown). While Gb3/CD77 was stained mainly in a homogenous pattern on the cell surface and partly in the cytoplasm of the untreated MEG-01 (Fig. 9), it was stained more strongly and with a granular pattern in the TPA-treated cells. Stained granules were present throughout the cytoplasm, and small particles present outside of cells were also stained by the anti-Gb3/CD77 antibody. These results suggested that surface Gb3/CD77 moved to the cytoplasm probably to the platelet precursor, and some of them were released from the differentiated megakaryocytes. As for GPIIb-IIIa, it was stained definitely only after TPA treatment indicating the induction of the differentiation. Extracellular particles were also positive for GPIIb-IIIa, suggesting that they were platelet precursor generated in the cytoplasm of MEG-O1 and released as a result of the megakaryocyte maturation (Fig. 9A). In the cytostaining, platelets expressed Gb3/CD77 weakly and GPIIb-IIIa strongly (Fig. 9B). However, particles expressing both Gb3/CD77 and GPIIb-IIIa were a relatively minor population. The Gb3/CD77 single positive was major, and GPIIb-IIIa single positive was also present, although not as a dominant population. When Gb3/CD77 and GPIIb-IIIa staining were merged, the majority of the cytoplasmic region was double stained (Fig. 9C), indicating the possibility that cytoplasmic particles expressing both antigens might be platelet precursors. The treatment of the fixed cells with Triton X-100 for permeabilization resulted in slightly weaker but essentially same staining compared with those with acetone treatment (data not shown). MEG-01 cells, both untreated cells and TPA-treated cells, were exposed to VT-2 to compare the sensitivity to the toxins. Untreated MEG-01 clearly exhibited a DNA ladder more intensely than the TPA-treated one (Fig. 10), indicating that expression levels of Gb3/CD77 were actually regulating the sensitivity to cytotoxicity with VT-2. Among 40 kinds of human hematopoietic tumor cell lines or normal cells, Burkitt lymphoma cells clearly showed high expression levels of the Gb3/CD77 synthase gene in accordance with the high expression of Gb3/CD77 antigen. Surprisingly, megakaryoblastic leukemia cell lines also expressed high levels of both the Gb3/CD77 synthase gene and its products. These findings suggested that Gb3/CD77 expression was mainly regulated at the transcriptional level of the Gb3/CD77 synthase gene. However, it is necessary to consider that expression levels of Gb3/CD77 may also be affected by the availability of the precursor lactosylceramide, and by the conversion rate of Gb3/CD77 to more complex structures such as globoside. In particular, EB-B cells exhibited fairly high expression levels of Gb3/CD77 synthase gene, while Gb3/CD77 expression is minimal or null. This may be due to the crypticity of the antigen (25.Wiels J. Holmes E.H. Cochran N. Tursz T. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14783-14787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or the lack of lactosylceramide, and remains to be clarified. This is the first study to detect Gb3/CD77 expression on megakaryoblasts, although the finding that human platelets contain a high level of Gb3/CD77 as a major glycolipid is well known (26.Cooling L.L. Koerner T.A. Naides S.J. J. Infect. Dis. 1995; 172: 1198-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 27.Cooling L.L. Walker K.E. Gille T. Koerner T.A. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 4355-4366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Koerner T.A. Weinfeld H.M. Bullard L.S. Williams L.C. Blood. 1989; 74: 274-284Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, we demonstrated here that they are also sensitive to VTs and undergo apoptosis via the activation of caspases as shown in other cells (29.Kiyokawa N. Mori T. Taguchi T. Saito M. Mimori K. Suzuki T. Sekino T. Sato N. Nakajima H. Katagiri Y.U. Takeda T. Fujimoto J. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 81: 128-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). As the molecular mechanisms for the VT-mediated apoptosis, two major pathways are involved. First, the cytotoxic effects of VTs were originally suggested to be caused by an A-subunit of the toxin containing RNA N-glycohydrolase activity. The inhibition of protein synthesis with the A-subunit leads to apoptosis (30.Williams J.M. Lea N. Lord J.M. Roberts L.M. Milford D.V. Taylor C.M. Toxicol. Lett. 1997; 91: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 31.Martin S.J. Lennon S.V. Bonham A.M. Cotter T.G. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 1859-1867PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Bazar L.S. Deeg H.J. Exp. Hematol. 1992; 20: 80-86PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, B subunit, a binding subunit of the toxin (33.Fishman P.H. Brady R.O. Science. 1976; 194: 906-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar), has also been shown to induce apoptosis (34.Mangeney M. Ligwood C.A. Taga S. Caillou B. Tursz T. Wiels J. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5314-5319PubMed Google Scholar). The finding that cross-linking of Gb3/CD77 triggered intracellular signaling events in Burkitt lymphoma cells (12.Taga S. Carlier K. Mishal Z. Capoulade C. Mangeney M. Lecluse Y. Coulaud D. Tetaud C. Pritchard L.L. Tursz T. Wiels J. Blood. 1997; 90: 2757-2767Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) supported this possibility. In the present study, it was demonstrated that immature megakaryoblasts are also sensitive to VTs and are induced to apoptosis based on the Gb3/CD77 expression. The activation of caspase 3 with VTs, and inhibition of MEG-01 destruction and caspase 3 activation with z-VAD indicated that megakaryoblasts undergo apoptosis via caspase activation cascade. The sensitivity to apoptosis correlated with Gb3/CD77 expression levels. All these findings suggested that less differentiated megakaryoblasts are more sensitive to VT-induced apoptosis, and the final product, platelets are insensitive to VTs (Fig. 10). HUS is a clinical syndrome characterized by acute renal failure, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and thrombocytopenia which often follows infection by Shiga toxin- or VT-producing strains of E. coli. The pathological process is triggered by the binding of the B-subunit of VTs to cell surface receptors whatever the following events are. To date, three glycosphingolipids containing common Galα1,4Gal- structure have been identified as potential receptors for VTs (35.Lindberg A.A. Brown J.E. Stromberg N. Westling-Ryd M. Schultz J.E. Karlsson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1779-1785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These glycosphingolipids include galabiosylceramide, Gb3, and P1 antigens. Tissue-specific expression of these structures are considered to play a role in the clinical spectrum of the illness seen in HUS (36.Jacewicz M. Clausen H. Nudelman E. Donohue-Rolfe A. Keusch G.T. J. Exp. Med. 1986; 163: 1391-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 37.Zoja C. Corna D. Farina C. Sacchi G. Lingwood C. Doyle M.P. Padhye V.V. Abbate M. Remuzzi G. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1992; 120: 229-238PubMed Google Scholar). Actually, there have been a number of studies to suggest the apoptosis induction of cultured renal cells such as microvasucular endothelial cells (38.Pijpers A.H. van Setten P.A. van den Heuvel L.P. Assmann K.J. Dijkman H.B. Pennings A.H. Monnens L.A. Hinsbergh V.W. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2001; 12: 767-778Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), proximal (39.Kodama T. Naagayama K. Yamada K. Ohba Y. Akeda Y. Honda T. Med. Microbiol. Immunol. (Berl.). 1999; 188: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and distal (40.Kiyokawa N. Taguchi T. Mori T. Uchida H. Sato N. Takeda T. Fujimoto J. J. Infect Dis. 1998; 178: 178-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) tubular epithelial cells, as well as apoptosis of renal tubular cell in vivo (41.Kaneko K. Kiyokawa N. Ohtomo Y. Nagaoka R. Yamashiro Y. Taguchi T. Mori T. Fujimoto J. Takeda T. Nephron. 2001; 87: 182-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). On the other hand, human erythrocytes contain a fair amount of Gb3/CD77, but is hard to be recognized by antibodies. They showed no hemolysis even after incubation for 24 h with VT-2 in PBS at 100 ng/ml (data not shown), suggesting various modes of expression depending on tissues and cells. Platelet is one of the major target cells in HUS, and a number of studies indicated marked consumption and/or activation of platelets leading to microthrombi and bleeding (42.Chong B.H. Murray B. Berndt M.C. Dunlop L.C. Brighton T. Chesterman C.N. Blood. 1994; 83: 1535-1541Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43.Fong J.S. Kaplan B.S. Blood. 1982; 60: 564-570Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, whether VTs directly bind platelets has been controversial. It has been claimed that VTs do not directly affect platelet aggregation (16.Viisoreanu D. Polanowska-Grabowska R. Suttitanamongkol S. Obrig T.G. Gear A.R. Thromb. Res. 2000; 98: 403-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 44.Thorpe C.M. Flaumenhaft R. Hurley B. Jacewicz M. Acheson D.W. Keusch G.T. Acta Haematol. 1999; 102: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), or does not directly bind platelets (45.te Loo D.M. Monnens L.A. van Der Velden T.J. Vermeer M.A. Preyers F. Demacker P.N. van Den Heuvel L.P. van Hinsbergh V.W. Blood. 2000; 95: 3396-3402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, direct binding and activation of platelets with VTs were demonstrated (17.Karpman D. Papadopoulou D. Nilsson K. Sjogren A.C. Mikaelsson C. Lethagen S. Blood. 2001; 97: 3100-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 27.Cooling L.L. Walker K.E. Gille T. Koerner T.A. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 4355-4366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cooling et al. (27.Cooling L.L. Walker K.E. Gille T. Koerner T.A. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 4355-4366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) defined a novel VT receptor (0.03) specific for platelets in addition to Gb3 on TLC binding, although actual involvement of 0.03 was not confirmed. From the present findings, Gb3 expression on platelet cell surface is very low or null, and it appears unlikely that VTs directly induce platelet destruction. The results obtained in the present study suggest another mechanism for thrombocytopenia in HUS. Namely, the destruction of immature megakaryoblasts might take place leading to the arrest of platelet generation in the bone marrow and to thrombocytopenia in HUS patients. If actual receptors on platelets to VTs are present, Gb3 and 0.03 might be potential receptors. Gb3/CD77 synthase can synthesize Galα1,4Gal-ceramide and Gb3, but not P1 (13.Kojima Y. Fukumoto S. Furukawa K. Okajima T. Wiels J. Yokoyama K. Suzuki Y. Urano T. Ohta M. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15152-15156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The proposed structure of 0.03 is Galα1,4Galβ1,3GalNAcβ1,3 Galα1,4Galβ1,4Glc-ceramide (24.Phillips D.R. Charo I.F. Parise L.V. Fitzgerald L.A. Blood. 1988; 71: 831-843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it appears unlikely that 0.03 is a product of Gb3/CD77 synthase. However, it was reported that the Gb3 level and 0.03 level were mutually correlated, suggesting 0.03 is a product of Gb3/CD77 synthase. This point remains to be clarified. In addition, surface expression of Gb3 and 0.03 (Gal-Gb5) on platelets remains to be analyzed. Surface expression of Gb3/CD77 was relatively reduced despite the finding that the mRNA level of the Gb3/CD77 synthase gene was up-regulated during the induced differentiation of MEG-01. It seemed possible that the reduction of Gb3/CD77 expression was caused by increased crypticity due to co-expressed sialylglycoconjugates as previously described (25.Wiels J. Holmes E.H. Cochran N. Tursz T. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14783-14787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, sialidase treatment of MEG-01 did not affect so much the expression levels of Gb3/CD77 as well as of GPIIb-IIIa at both TPA-treated and untreated conditions. Consequently, Gb3/CD77 appeared to have moved from the cell surface to the cytoplasm as shown in Fig. 9, and been incorporated into the granules containing GPIIb-IIIa to form platelet precursors (Fig. 11). If so, platelet precursors may already express both antigens before release. In fact, platelets showed co-expression of Gb3/CD77 and GPIIb-IIIa in the cytostaining. Taken together with the results of flow cytometry, platelets appear to express GPIIb-IIIa on the cell surface and to contain Gb3/CD77 inside of the “cells.” However, the actual function of Gb3/CD77 antigen present inside the platelets remains unclear. Whether this intracellular Gb3/CD77 is accessible by outer ligands or antibodies remains to be clarified."

We recently demonstrated that colon carcinoma cells transfected with oncogenic cellularK-rasV12, but not oncogenic cellular H-rasV12, switched from TGFβ1-insensitive to TGFβ1-growth-stimulated and also became more invasive (Yan, Z., Deng, X., and Friedman, E. (2001)J. Biol. Chem. 276, 1555–1563). We now demonstrate that TGFβ1 growth stimulation of colon carcinoma cells is Ras-dependent and smad-independent. In U9 colon carcinoma cells, which are responsive to TGFβ1 by growth stimulation, a truncating mutation at Gln-311 was found in thesmad4 gene. Very little smad4 protein was detected in these cells. Loss of smad4 protein was confirmed by functional studies. In U9 cells co-transfected wild-type smad4, but not mutant smad4, mediated response of the 3TP-lux and pSBE promoter reporter constructs to TGFβ1. Proliferation initiated by TGFβ1 in U9 cells required Ras-mediated down-regulation of p21cip1 protein. Less p21cip1 was associated with cdk2·cyclin complexes in TGFβ1-treated U9 cells, and the cdk2 complexes had increased kinase activity. Elevation of p21cip1 levels diminished proliferative response to TGFβ1. U9 cells expressing DN-N17ras neither proliferated in response to TGFβ1 nor down-regulated the cdk inhibitor p21cip1, and TGFβ1 activation of 3TP-lux in U9 cells was inhibited by DN-N17ras in a dose-dependent manner. TGFβ1 also decreased p21cip1 levels and stimulated proliferation in SW480 cells, which express mutant K-Ras but no smad4 protein. TGFβ1 did not activate or inhibit the p21cip1 promoter construct in U9 cells even in the presence of co-transfected smad4, or alter p21cip1 mRNA levels. Thus the decrease in p21cip1 levels was mediated by a TGFβ-initiated Ras-dependent, but smad-independent post-transcriptional mechanism. Transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1) can act as a tumor suppressor or a tumor promoter depending on the characteristics of the malignant cell. We recently demonstrated that colon carcinoma cells transfected with oncogenic cellularK-rasV12, but not oncogenic cellular H-rasV12, switched from TGFβ1-insensitive to TGFβ1-growth-stimulated and also became more invasive (Yan, Z., Deng, X., and Friedman, E.

Acta. 1990; 1032: 79-87PubMed Google Scholar). TGFβ1 induces its varied biological responses through the paired heteromeric complex of type I (TβRI) and type II (TβRII) transmembrane serine/threonine kinases. Upon binding of TGFβ1, TβRII transphosphorylates TβRI in a highly conserved GS domain, activating TβRI kinase to its downstream effectors (3Massague J. Cell. 1996; 85: 947-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). Genetic studies in Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans have identified one set of downstream effectors, whose mammalian homologues are termed smads. There are 9 smads in vertebrates: the receptor-regulated smads 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8 with very similar structures, the common interacting smads 4 and 4β, and the signal-blocking smads 6 and 7, which form a third discrete subgroup. Upon binding TGFβ1 and activation of TβRs, the smad2 or smad3 molecules bound to TβRI are phosphorylated, dissociate to form a heteromeric complex with smad4 trimers, and translocate to the nucleus where they modify transcription (4Massague J. Hata A. Liu F. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 187-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) following binding to a palindromic smad binding element (SBE), GTCTAGAC (5Zawel L. Dai J.

TGFβ1 activation of its receptors leads, by as yet unknown pathways, to activation of a series of signaling pathways, in addition to the smads. These pathways include Ras→ERK (8Mulder K. Morris S. J.

There are at present 51 members of the TGFβ superfamily with three TGFβ isoforms found in humans, types 1, 2 and 3, each with a different spectrum of localization in vivo (14Pelton R. Saxena B. Jones M. Moses H. Gold L. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1091-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Use of isoform-specific antisera has shown that only the TGFβ1 isoform is associated with cancer development in a wide series of human neoplasias (colon, breast, prostate, glioma, pancreatic, endometrial, gastric, osteosarcomas, etc.) (15Gold L. Crit. Rev. Oncogenesis. 1999; 10: 303-360PubMed Google Scholar). Elevated expression of TGFβ1, but not TGFβ2 or TGFβ3, was significantly correlated with colon cancer progression to metastases. Patients with elevated levels of TGFβ1 protein in their tumor cells were 18 times more likely to experience recurrence of their disease (16Friedman E. Gold L. Klimstra D. Zeng Z. Winawer S. Cohen A. Cancer Epidemiol. 1995; 4: 549-554PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, when metastatic cells were compared with their primary site colon cancer, the level of TGFβ1 protein in the primary site tumor was maintained or increased in the metastatic cells in roughly 75% of cases (17Picon A. Gold L.I. Wang J. Cohen A. Friedman E. Cancer Epidemiol. 1998; 7: 497-504PubMed Google Scholar). Elevated TGFβ1 levels could mediate increased tumor aggressiveness in several ways, and autocrine TGFβ1 pathways have been shown to mediate increased invasiveness and metastasis in carcinomas (18Oft M. Heider K.-M. Beug H. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1243-1251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another autocrine response to TGFβ1 is increased proliferation, which has been observed in resected carcinomas in primary culture (19Schroy P. Carnright K. Winawer S. Friedman E. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 5487-5494PubMed Google Scholar, 20Schroy P. Rifkin J. Coffey R. Winawer S. Friedman E. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 261-265PubMed Google Scholar) as well as established cell lines such as U9 colon carcinoma cell line. The colon carcinoma cells, which exhibited increased proliferation in response to TGFβ1, have also become more invasive in vitro andin vivo, suggesting that the two biological responses share at least some components of a common TGFβ1-signaling system (21Huang F. Newman E. Kerbel R. Friedman E. Cell Growth Diff. 1995; 6: 1635-1642PubMed Google Scholar, 22Yan Z. Deng X. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1555-1563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). For example, decreasing TGFβ1 protein levels in the metastatic U9 colon cancer cell line by antisense methodology decreased both U9 cell metastasis to the liver and subcutaneous tumor formation in a nude mouse system, and the tumors that did arise had regained TGFβ1 expression (21Huang F. Newman E. Kerbel R. Friedman E. Cell Growth Diff. 1995; 6: 1635-1642PubMed Google Scholar). TGFβ1 growth stimulation has been documented in various aggressive carcinoma cells, including a subset of colon carcinomas (20Schroy P. Rifkin J. Coffey R. Winawer S. Friedman E.

We have previously reported that TGFβ1 growth stimulation in colon carcinoma cells is dependent on mutation in K-Ras (22Yan Z. Deng X. Friedman E. J. Biol.

In the current study we demonstrate that the TGFβ1-initiated signaling pathways, which mediate increased proliferation are Ras-dependent and smad-independent. TGFβ1 was purchased from R&D Systems. Antibodies to cyclins E, D1, and A, smad2, smad4, and rabbit antibody to cdk2 coupled to agarose were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, whereas antibodies to p21 and p27 were from Transduction Laboratories. The pan-Ras antibody Y13–259 and c-Ha-Ras Ab1 (clone 235–17.1.1), a mouse monoclonal specific for H-Ras, were purchased from Oncogene Science. Polyvinylidene difluoride transfer paper Immobilon-P was purchased from Millipore and polyethyleneimine cellulose F from EM Separations. All radioactive materials were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and ECL reagents were from Amersham Biosciences, Inc. Lovastatin was obtained from Merck, Sharp & Dohme Research Laboratories and dissolved in ethanol (4 mg/0.1 ml), made active by addition of 0.15 ml of 0.1 n NaOH and heating for 2 h at 50 °C, neutralized with HCl, then brought to a stock solution of 4 mg/ml with distilled water. All other reagents were from Sigma Chemical Co. pcDPC4wt, pcDPC4–100T, and p6MBE-luc were obtained from S. Kern; pSBE-luc/BV and WWP-luc from B. Vogelstein; p3TP-lux, pCMV5/smad4-HA-(294–552), and pCMV5/DPC-(1–514) from J. Massague; p(SBS)2/tkCAT from A. Mauviel; and pCAL2 from R. Derynck. For transient transfections, cells were plated in 12-well plates at an approximate density of 3 × 105 and cultured for 24 h. LipofectAMINE (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) (5 μλ/well) was mixed with a total of 720 ng of DNA for 30 min in serum-free medium, then added to the cells in serum-free medium for 16–18 h with or without 5 ng/ml TGFβ1, and luciferase activity was then determined. Transfected DNA samples were composed of 200 ng of reporter construct, 20 ng of the pCMV-gal β-galactosidase expression plasmid and, depending on the experiment, 500 ng of test expression plasmid or vector control DNA. Cells were lysed, and both luciferase and β-galactosidase activity were measured using a TD-20/20 luminometer. Luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity for differences in transfection efficiency. Each experiment was performed in triplicate and performed three to four times. The human colon carcinoma cell lines used in this study were maintained in DME medium containing 7% fetal bovine serum, modified, and supplemented as described (24Hafez M. Hsu S. Yan Z. Winawer S. Friedman E. Cell Growth Diff. 1992; 3: 753-762PubMed Google Scholar). Effects on cell growth by TGFβ1 were assayed by direct cell counting using a hemacytometer or by incorporation of [3H]thymidine after culture in serum-free ITS (2.5 μg/ml insulin, 1.7 μg/ml transferrin, 0.1 μm selenous acid, 0.29 μm linoleic acid, 1 mg/ml fatty acid free bovine serum albumin)-DME. The N17rasH construct developed by L. Feig (28Feig L. Cooper G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3235-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar) had been inserted into a pCNC10 expression plasmid behind a CMV promoter by Dr. Fran Kern (University of Alabama) who provided us with the plasmid. This plasmid also carries a neomycin resistance gene behind a CMV promoter. U9 colon carcinoma cells were transfected with this expression plasmid by calcium phosphate precipitation, and putative N17ras transfectants were selected in G418. Transfectants were isolated after transfection with the empty pCNC10 expression plasmid and used as controls. The p21cip1 coding sequence was inserted C-terminal to EGFP (enhanced green fluorescence protein) in the pUC-derived pEGFP-C2 mammalian expression vector (CLONTECH) and designated p21-EGFP-C2. Apoptosis was measured by binding of fluorescein isothiocyanate-bound annexin V to phosphatidylserine on the outer layer of the plasma membrane (CLONTECH K2027–1) by fluorescence microscopy. Following treatment as indicated and washing with cold phosphate-buffered saline, cells were lysed in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mmNaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 200 μm sodium orthovanadate, and 20 mm sodium fluoride. Lysates were pelleted in a microcentrifuge for 15 min to remove insoluble material. Depending on the experiment, 40–100 μg of the cell lysate was blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes after separation on SDS-PAGE. The blots were blocked in either TBS or TBST buffer (TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20) and 3–5% nonfat dry milk for 2 h, incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibody (1 μg/ml Ab to cyclin E, cyclin A, H-Ras, cdc25A, p21cip1, or p15; 0.5 μg/ml for cyclin D1; 1:2500 dilution of antibody to p27), and proteins were subsequently detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. 20 μg of total RNA from each cell line was electrophoresed in a 0.8% agarose-formaldehyde gel, transferred to nylon membranes by downward capillary transfer, and UV cross-linked. The membranes were hybridized to a full-length p21cip1 cDNA. Probes were labeled with 32P by random priming. The blot was hybridized overnight at 42 °C with at least 107 cpm of the labeled probe, washed at room temperature three times for 7 min with 1× SSC-1% SDS, then washed for 20 min at 52 °C in 0.1× SSC-0.1% SDS and autoradiographed. The blots were stripped and rehybridized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Cell lysates were prepared exactly as detailed (29Lee H. Ghose-Dastidar J. Winawer S. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5255-5263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lysates were diluted 10-fold with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 110 mm NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 mm benzamidine, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. 15 μl of cdk2 agarose-coupled antibody (M2) was added to 800 μg to 1 mg lysate protein in a final volume of 500 μl of binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 120 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 mm benzamidine, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated overnight at 4 °C with rocking before four times washing with binding buffer, one rinse with kinase assay buffer, then kinase assay. The reaction buffer (875 μl) was 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 15 mmMgCl2, 1 μm dithiothreitol added immediately before use. Added to it were 3 μl of 10 mg/ml histone H1, 20 μl of 0.1 mm ATP, 2 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (10 mCi/ml), and the reaction proceeded for 5 min at 30 °C. Cells were labeled overnight with 200 μCi of 32P-labeled orthophosphate in serum-free, phosphate-free ITS-DME, then lysed and immunoprecipitated with affinity-purified monoclonal antibody Y13–259, exactly as described (30Yan Z. Winawer S. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13231-13237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After washing the immunoprecipitates, GTP and GDP were eluted with 20 μl of 1 m KH2PO4, pH 3.4, with heating for 3 min at 90 °C, then separated by thin layer chromatography on polyethyleneimine cellulose F developed with 1m KH2PO4, pH 3.4, followed by autoradiography. Immunoblots were scanned using a Lacie Silverscanner DTP and a Power Macintosh 7500, and densitometry was performed using the IP Lab Gel program (Scanalytics). About half of all colon cancers exhibit Ras mutations, with the vast majority in K-Ras, and very rarely, if ever, in H-Ras. Recent results from our laboratory (22Yan Z. Deng X. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1555-1563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) have shown that colon cancer cells can respond to TGFβ1 by growth if they express transfected oncogenic K-Ras proteins, but not transfected oncogenic H-Ras proteins or an equal abundance of transfected wild-type K-Ras proteins. In our earlier studies about 40% of resected colon cancers placed into primary culture, including most metastatic tumors, responded to TGFβ1 by growth stimulation; therefore, the oncogenic K-Ras-expressing cell lines serve as models for this biological response (19Schroy P. Carnright K. Winawer S. Friedman E. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 5487-5494PubMed Google Scholar, 20Schroy P. Rifkin J. Coffey R. Winawer S. Friedman E. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 261-265PubMed Google Scholar). The HT29 colon carcinoma sublines U9 and HP1 are not mutated in Ras, however, and yet respond to TGFβ1 by growth and enhanced invasion and metastasis (21Huang F. Newman E. Kerbel R. Friedman E. Cell Growth Diff. 1995; 6: 1635-1642PubMed Google Scholar, 23Hafez M. Infante D. Winawer S. Friedman E. Yan Z. Hsu S. Winawer S. Friedman E. Cell Growth Diff. 1990; 1: 617-626PubMed Google Scholar, 31Huang F. Hsu S. Yan Z. Winawer S. Friedman E. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3701-3706PubMed Google Scholar, 32Hsu S. Huang F. Hafez M. Winawer S. Friedman E. Cell Growth Diff. 1994; 5: 267-275PubMed Google Scholar). We undertook these studies to determine their molecular basis for growth stimulation. In our earlier study, TGFβ1 down-regulated the abundance of the cdk inhibitor p21cip1 when it stimulated cell proliferation in colon carcinoma cells expressing transfected oncogenic K-Ras proteins (22Yan Z. Deng X. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1555-1563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), but the functional significance of this reduction was not determined. We now tested the effect of TGFβ1 on p21cip1 abundance in HT29 sublines. The HT29 parental line is not clonal, so the isolated sublines represent cells within the tumor with differing malignant potential. These include the weakly invasive HD3 and HD4 sublines, which respond to TGFβ1 by growth inhibition through a block in phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein, and the highly invasive U9 and HP1 sublines, which respond to TGFβ1 by increased proliferation through increased retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation (25Yan Z. Hsu S. Winawer S. Friedman E. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 801-805PubMed Google Scholar). Each of the HT29 sublines displays the same mutations in the colon cancer genes APC and p53(31Huang F. Hsu S. Yan Z. Winawer S. Friedman E. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3701-3706PubMed Google Scholar). Two HT29 sublines, one growth-inhibited and the other growth-stimulated by TGFβ1, were treated with a range of TGFβ1 concentrations. TGFβ1 increased p21cip1 protein levels 9-fold when added to HD3 cells at 4 ng/ml, a concentration that inhibits cell proliferation (Fig.1 A). In contrast, TGFβ1 decreased the abundance of p21cip1 to one-third of control levels in U9 cells (Fig. 1 A, loading and blotting controls shownbelow the p21cip1 lanes), similar to its down-regulation of p21cip1 in HD6-K-RasV12 cells (22Yan Z. Deng X. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1555-1563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Our initial observation, that the retinoblastoma protein was more highly phosphorylated in U9 and HP1 cells induced to proliferate by TGFβ1 (25Yan Z. Hsu S. Winawer S. Friedman E. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 801-805PubMed Google Scholar), implied that TGFβ1 increased the kinase activity of the cdk2·cyclin complexes in these cells. This hypothesis was confirmed when the histone kinase activity of cdk2·cyclin complexes was determined by immunoprecipitation of cdk2. Equal amounts of cdk2 were immunoprecipitated (Fig. 1 C, lower lanes), but TGFβ1 increased the cdk2 kinase activity of U9 cells while inhibiting the cdk2 kinase activity of HD3 cells (Fig. 1 C, one of four experiments with similar results). Analysis of the composition of such complexes revealed that after TGFβ1 treatment there was less p21 associated with cdk2 complexes in U9 cells, whereas more p21cip1 associated with cdk2 complexes in TGFβ1-treated HD3 cells (Fig.1 B; 150% more lysate was used for the cdk2 immunoprecipitates from U9 cells, so the decrease in p21cip1 levels would be more evident). Addition of a cdk2 peptide during the immunoprecipitation blocked the association of p21cip1 with cdk2 (Fig.1 B). These cdk2·cyclin·cdk inhibitor compositions are consistent with modulations in histone H1 kinase activity caused by TGFβ1 treatment (Fig. 1 C). Thus TGFβ1 stimulated the growth of certain colon carcinoma cells by decreasing the total amount of the cdk inhibitor p21, which in turn led to a decrease in the amount of p21cip1 capable of associating with cdk2·cyclin complexes and an increase in the kinase activity of the cdk2·cyclin complexes. Such an increase in cdk2·cyclin activity by TGFβ1 was the likely cause of the increase in retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation seen in TGFβ1-treated U9 and HP1 cells in our earlier studies (25Yan Z. Hsu S. Winawer S. Friedman E. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 801-805PubMed Google Scholar). The cell growth induced by TGFβ1 was not due to a block in apoptosis. U9 cells were treated with 5 ng/ml TGFβ1 for 2 days, and the percentage of apoptotic cells was determined by binding of annexin V. Both untreated and TGFβ1-treated cultures contained 0.9% apoptotic cells (a total of 3996 cells assayed). A longer exposure of the Western blots from U9 cells was needed to detect p21cip1 (Fig. 1 A), suggesting that steady-state levels of p21cip1 were lower in these cells. Both U9 and HD3 cells exhibit autocrine regulation by TGFβ1 (32Hsu S. Huang F. Hafez M. Winawer S. Friedman E. Cell Growth Diff. 1994; 5: 267-275PubMed Google Scholar), so it is possible that their endogenous TGFβ1 regulates their steady-state p21cip1 levels. Steady-state levels of cell cycle modulators were compared between HT29 sublines growth-stimulated by TGFβ1 (U9, HP1) and sublines growth-inhibited by TGFβ1 (HD3, HD4). Western blotting demonstrated that levels of the cdk inhibitor p21cip1 were markedly lower in both growth-stimulated lines (Fig.2 A, lower panel, protein loading controls) whereas levels of other cell cycle modulators were not substantially altered (Fig. 2 B). The extent of the difference in p21cip1 abundance between these lines varied in different experiments (results from two experiments shown in Fig. 2, Aand B) and may reflect differential response to the insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 found in different batches of fetal calf serum. However, in growth media the level of p21cip1 was always lower in the U9 and HP1 cell lines, which were capable of growth stimulation by TGFβ1. In contrast to the differences in abundance of p21cip1, all four lines exhibit similar steady-state levels of the cdk inhibitors p15 and p27, the tyrosine phosphatase cdc25A, which dephosphorylates cdc2 on regulatory tyrosine residues, and the cyclins D1 and E. A small increase in the steady-state level of cyclin A was seen in both TGFβ1-stimulated cell lines (Fig. 2 B), which may simply reflect their increased growth rate. Elevated expression of p21cip1 blocked the proliferation of U9 cells. An expression plasmid for p21cip1 driven by a CMV promoter and tagged with EGFP was transfected into U9 cells, and G418 selection was attempted. The U9 cells expressing exogenous p21cip were identified by the co-expressed EGFP protein by fluorescence microscopy. However, after 4–5 days the vast majority of U9 cells with overexpressed p21cip1 detached from the substratum and then died within the next few days, whereas the control transfectants expressing only the EGFP protein were still viable, attached cells. We concluded that U9 colon carcinoma cells responded to highly elevated levels of p21cip1 by growth arrest and apoptosis as has been reported for other cell types. Therefore, there was no inherent resistance to p21cip1 expression in U9 cells. We then tested whether a more modest elevation of endogenous p21cip1 levels would block TGFβ1-induced cell proliferation. Increasing the level of insulin 16-fold in the serum-free ITS-DME medium caused a 10-fold increase in p21cip1 levels after 24 h (Fig. 2 C). TGFβ1 was added for an additional 2 days to half of the cultures, leading to a 4-fold decrease in p21cip1 levels. Parallel cultures were examined for proliferation. TGFβ1 induced a 2-fold increase in proliferation in U9 cells cultured in standard ITS-DME but only a modest 30% increase in proliferation in U9 cells with elevated p21cip1 levels due to insulin treatment (Fig.2 D). Increasing insulin levels did not increase U9 cell proliferation (Fig. 2 D, compare lanes 1 with3), probably because the increase in p21cip1 levels was balanced by increases in other regulatory molecules such as cyclins. However, increasing p21cip1 levels did diminish the growth stimulation by TGFβ1. We next investigated the TGFβ1 signaling pathways in TGFβ1 growth-stimulated U9 cells and TGFβ1 growth-inhibited HD3 cells. Possibly a mutation in either TβRI or TβRII might explain growth stimulation by TGFβ1. This hypothesized mutation could not be in the extracellular TGFβ-binding domain because TGFβ binding was normal (25Yan Z. Hsu S. Winawer S. Friedman E. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 801-805PubMed Google Scholar). Functional TGFβ receptors had been detected in both TGFβ1 growth-inhibited cells (HD3, HD4) and TGFβ1 growth-stimulated cells (HP1, U9) by [125I]TGFβ1 binding studies (25Yan Z. Hsu S. Winawer S. Friedman E. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 801-805PubMed Google Scholar). All of these cells express equal levels of TβRI, TβRII, and TβRIII mRNA and protein, and these receptors are transported to the cell surface (33Deng X. Bellis S. Yan Z. Friedman E. Cell Growth Diff. 1999; 10: 11-18PubMed Google Scholar). TβRII and TβRI were sequenced in three HT29 subclones: TGFβ1-resistant HD6 cells (25Yan Z. Hsu S. Winawer S. Friedman E. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 801-805PubMed Google Scholar), TGFβ1 growth-inhibited HD3 cells, and TGFβ1 growth-stimulated U9 cells, and compared with the published sequences. DNA sequencing was performed on reverse transcriptase-PCR-generated overlapping fragments from bp 220 through 767 of the coding region of TβRII, which covers the poly(A) tracts mutated in repair-deficient syndromes (34Markowitz S.

https://openalex.org/W1987158848,"Kinetic studies support the concept that protein substrate recognition by the prothrombinase complex of coagulation is achieved by interactions at extended macromolecular recognition sites (exosites), distinct from the active site of factor Xa within the complex. We have used this formal kinetic model and a monoclonal antibody directed against Xa (αBFX-2b) to investigate the contributions of surfaces on the proteinase to exosite-mediated protein substrate recognition by prothrombinase. αBFX-2b bound reversibly to a fluorescent derivative of factor Xa (K d = 17.1 ± 5.6 nm) but had no effect on active site function of factor Xa or factor Xa saturably assembled into prothrombinase. In contrast, αBFX-2b was a slow, tight binding inhibitor of the cleavage of either prethrombin 2 or meizothrombin des-fragment 1 by prothrombinase (K i* = 0.55 ± 0.05 nm). Thus, αBFX-2b binding to factor Xa within prothrombinase selectively leads to the inhibition of protein substrate cleavage without interfering with active site function. Inhibition kinetics could adequately be accounted for by a kinetic model in which prethrombin 2 and αBFX-2b bind in a mutually exclusive way to prothrombinase. These are properties expected of an exosite-directed inhibitor. The site(s) on factor Xa responsible for antibody binding were evaluated by identification of immunoreactive fragments following chemical digestion of human and bovine Xa and were further confirmed with a series of recombinantly expressed fragments. These approaches suggest that residues 82–91 and 102–116 in the proteinase domain contribute to αBFX-2b binding. The data establish this antibody as a prototypic exosite-directed inhibitor of prothrombinase and suggest that the occlusion of a surface on factor Xa, spatially removed from the active site, is sufficient to block exosite-dependent recognition of the protein substrate by prothrombinase.

Prothrombinase, which assembles through reversible interactions between the serine proteinase, factor Xa, the cofactor, factor Va, and membranes, catalyzes the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin by the cleavage of two peptide bonds (2Mann K.G.

Although factor Xa can activate prothrombin by itself, the catalytic efficiency for prothrombin activation is increased by a factor of ∼300,000 upon the incorporation of the proteinase into the prothrombinase complex (2Mann K.G. Jenny R.J. Krishnaswamy S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 915-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 3Kalafatis M. Swords N.A. Rand M.D. Mann K.G. Biochim. Biophys.

Factor Va is considered to contribute in a major way to the enhanced catalytic efficiency for prothrombin activation by prothrombinase (2Mann K.G. Jenny R.J. Krishnaswamy S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 915-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 6Mann K.G. Nesheim M.E. Church W.R. Haley P. Krishnaswamy S. Blood. 1990; 76: 1-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it appears increasingly improbable that the role of the cofactor is primarily realized by perturbing the catalytic site of factor Xa, as has been tacitly assumed (2Mann K.G. Jenny R.J. Krishnaswamy S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 915-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 6Mann K.G. Nesheim M.E. Church W.R. Haley P. Krishnaswamy S.

Instead, the data are more consistent with the idea that factor Va either contributes additional binding sites for the protein substrate and/or perturbs sites on factor Xa removed from the catalytic site, leading to enhanced extended interactions between the protein substrate and prothrombinase (8Krishnaswamy S. Walker R.K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3319-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 9Walker R.K. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13920-13929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It therefore follows that ground state rather than transition state effects likely play a significant role in the enhanced catalytic efficiency of prothrombinase toward its protein substrate. Support for the latter concept has accumulated from mechanistic studies of the individual half-reactions of prothrombin activation (10Krishnaswamy S. Betz A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12080-12086Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 11Boskovic D.S. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38561-38570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In these approaches, the kinetics of substrate recognition and cleavage at the two sites has been discretely assessed using proteolytic derivatives of prothrombin containing one of the two cleavage sites as substrate analogs. In either case, the bimolecular reaction between the protein substrate and prothrombinase results from interactions between extended macromolecular interaction sites (exosites) on the enzyme removed from the catalytic site and substrate sites distinct from structures surrounding the scissile bond (10Krishnaswamy S. Betz A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12080-12086Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 11Boskovic D.S. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol.

Docking of substrate structures at the active site of the enzyme occurs in a second unimolecular binding step preceding scissile bond cleavage. The exosite-binding step dominates the perceived affinity of the enzyme for the protein substrate (10Krishnaswamy S. Betz A.

The contributions of extended surfaces in factors Xa and Va within prothrombinase toward exosite interactions with the protein substrate remain uncertain. An important direct role for factor Va in binding the substrate is implied by the established ability of the cofactor to bind the fragment 2 domain of prothrombin (13Esmon C.T. Owen W.G. Duiguid D.L.

However, a dominant role for such interactions in exosite-dependent protein substrate recognition is neither supported by kinetic studies using substrate derivatives lacking the fragment 2 domain nor by inhibition studies with proteolytic derivatives of thrombin lacking part or all of the fibrinogen-binding site (12Betz A.

All measurements of Xa and prothrombinase function were performed using proteins of bovine origin. Instances in which human Xa was used to probe antibody reactivity either by fragmentation or by expression of recombinant derivatives are explicitly identified in the text. Bovine factor Va, factor X, prothrombin, prethrombin 1, and prethrombin 2 were isolated from bovine plasma using procedures described previously (12Betz A. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol.

Bound protein was eluted with a linear gradient of increasing NaCl in the same buffer (0.15 to 1.0 m) developed over 12 min. Trocarin eluted in a sharp peak at ∼0.6 m NaCl well resolved from other contaminants. Fractions containing trocarin were pooled, concentrated by ammonium sulfate fractionation (80% saturation), dissolved in 50% glycerol, and stored at −20 °C.

Steady state intensities were measured using a PTI QuantaMaster fluorescence spectrophotometer (PTI, Lawrenceville, NJ) using stirred 1 × 1-cm2 quartz cuvettes maintained at 25 °C. Analog ratiometric fluorescence intensity was measured using λEX= 485 nm and λEM = 515 nm with a KV-500 long pass filter (Schott, Duryea, PA) in the emission beam. Samples (2.0 ml) prepared either in assay buffer or assay buffer containing 100 μmEDTA instead of 2 mm Ca2+ were titrated with incremental microliter additions of the indicated reagent. After each addition, samples were maintained in the dark for 5 min, and then the intensity was measured by averaging 15 readings obtained at 1-s intervals. The cycle of incubation and measurement was periodically repeated throughout the titration to ensure that the initial incubation period was sufficient to obtain a limiting signal. Three samples were used to derive data for each titration as follows: Sample A, 25 nm OG488-Xa titrated with incremental additions of αBFX-2b; Sample B, 25 nm OG488-Xa titrated with incremental additions of buffer; and Sample C, 25 nmXa titrated with incremental additions of αBFX-2b. The primary fluorescence signal (Sample A) was corrected for dilution (Sample B) and minor scattering effects (Sample C) by the expression shown in Equation 1, FFo=FA−FCFB−FC·1FoEquation 1 where F o is the corrected ratiometric signal in the absence of titrant. Steady state kinetic constants for the cleavage of SpXa were determined in assay buffer as described (10Krishnaswamy S. Betz A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12080-12086Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), using prothrombinase preassembled with 0.5 nm Xa, 50 μm PCPS, and 20 nm Va. For measurements in the presence of αBFX-2b, the enzyme solution was preincubated with 200 nm antibody for 1–3 h at ambient temperature prior to substrate addition. The influence of αBFX-2b on the inhibition of prothrombinase by PAB was determined in an analogous approach using increasing concentrations of SpXa and different fixed concentrations of PAB corresponding to 0, 15, 30, 60, and 120 μm. The K i* value for the inhibition of Xa by rTAP was measured following incubation of reaction mixtures containing 0.5 nm Xa and increasing concentrations of rTAP in assay buffer either in the presence or absence of 200 nmαBFX-2b. Following incubation for 1 h at ambient temperature, the reaction mixtures were initiated with 100 μmSpXa. Steady state, initial velocities of prethrombin 2 cleavage by prothrombinase were determined from discontinuous measurements of thrombin formation as detailed previously (10Krishnaswamy S. Betz A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12080-12086Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures (200 μl) contained 1 nm Xa, 50 μm PCPS, 25 nm Va, and increasing concentrations of αBFX-2b prepared in assay buffer. Following incubation for 1–3 h at ambient temperature, prethrombin 2 cleavage was initiated by the addition of 50 μl of substrate solution to achieve a final concentration of 1.4 μm, and initial velocities were determined as described (10Krishnaswamy S. Betz A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12080-12086Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The stoichiometry for inhibition was independently assessed using a 10-fold higher concentration of reactants in the initial incubation mixture. The enzyme/antibody mixture was then diluted 10-fold into a solution of 1.4 μm prethrombin 2 followed by initial rate measurements. Destabilizing effects of αBFX-2b on the assembly of prothrombinase were investigated using concentrations of factor Va fixed at 25, 50, and 100 nm. Possible competitive effects with substrate were assessed following initial velocity measurements using 1.4, 2.8, and 5.6 μm prethrombin 2 to initiate the reaction. Inhibition of mIIaΔF1 cleavage was investigated using an equivalent strategy except that product formation was monitored continuously using the fluorescent derivative, mIIaΔF1F, as previously detailed (11Boskovic D.S. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38561-38570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The initial incubation of prothrombinase constituents with increasing concentrations of αBFX-2b was conducted in a final volume of 150 μl in wells of a 96-well plate. Residual activity was measured following the addition of 50 μl of mIIaΔF1F to achieve a final concentration of 0.8 μm. Product formation was monitored continuously using λEX = 480 nm and λEM = 520 nm with a 500 nm long pass filter in the emission beam in a kinetic fluorescence plate reader (Gemini, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA), and initial rates were calculated as described previously (11Boskovic D.S. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38561-38570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Slow and tight binding by αBFX-2b during ongoing catalysis was assessed using progress curves for thrombin formation obtained by the addition of 150 μl of assay buffer containing αBFX-2b and prethrombin 2 to an equal volume of preassembled prothrombinase (0.4 nm factor Xa, 40 nm factor Va, and 100 μm PCPS in assay buffer). Data sets were obtained at final concentrations of 1.4, 5.6, and 9.8 μm prethrombin 2 in the presence of 0, 2, 6, and 16 nm αBFX-2b. Aliquots (10 μl) were withdrawn serially from the reaction mixtures and quenched by mixing with 40 μl of 20 mm Hepes, 0.15m NaCl, 50 mm EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) PEG, 1 μm rTAP, pH 7.4. The concentration of thrombin formed in the quenched samples was determined from initial velocity measurements as described (10Krishnaswamy S. Betz A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12080-12086Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Samples were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE either before or after disulfide bond reduction by either the methods of Laemmli (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar) or Schagger and von Jagow (38Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10481) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic transfer to ImmobilonPSQ membranes was achieved in 20 mm Tris, 20 mm glycine, 10% (v/v) methanol, pH 8.3, in a semidry blotting apparatus (Hoefer Scientific Instruments, San Francisco) at 0.04 mA cm−2 for 15 h. Membranes were blocked with 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in 20 mmHepes, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 7.5, washed with three changes of the same buffer lacking albumin, and reacted for 1 h with a solution of αBFX-2b (5 μg/ml). Following washes to remove unbound antibody, αBFX-2b was detected using the Vectastain ABC Elite kit following the instructions of the manufacturer and visualized using 2.6 mg/ml 4-chloronaphthol, 0.038% (v/v) H2O2 in 20 mm Hepes, 0.15m NaCl, 37.5% (v/v) methanol, pH 7.5. Factor Xa (2 mg), of either human or bovine origin, was dissolved in 2.7 ml of 70% (v/v) HCOOH containing 10 mg/ml CNBr. Following digestion for 11 h at room temperature in the dark, the samples were dried by centrifugal evaporation, redissolved in 3.2 ml of 20 mmHepes, 0.15 m NaCl, 3.0 m guanidine HCl, 12 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5, and fractionated by reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography using a 100 × 4.6-mm Aquapore RP300 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) column equilibrated in 0.05% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. Bound protein fragments from a digest of human Xa were eluted with a gradient of increasing CH3CN (3.3 ml/min) programmed as follows: 0–30%, 5 min; 30–35%, 25 min; and 35–100%, 5 min. For the separation of bovine Xa fragments, the gradient was as follows: 0–23%, 5 min; 23–45%, 25 min; and 45–100%, 5 min. Dot blot analysis of the eluted peaks with αBFX-2b using described procedures (26Baugh R.J. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16126-16134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) identified immunoreactive material eluting at 31.6–32.1% for the human fragments and at 29.4–31.4% in the case of the bovine derivative. Fractions were pooled, concentrated by rotary evaporation, subject to SDS-PAGE, and transferred to ImmobilonPSQmembranes in 10 mm Caps, 10% (v/v) MeOH, pH 11. Proteins were visualized by staining with 0.1% (w/v) Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 in 50% (v/v) methanol, and bands of interest identified by comparison to a Western blot performed in parallel were excised and subjected to automated Edman degradation performed by Dr. Jan Pohl at the Emory University Microchemical Facility. DNA encoding the catalytic domain of human Xa (residues 16–264) 2Residues in the proteinase domain of factor Xa or thrombin are numbered according to the topographically equivalent residues in chymotrypsinogen (1Bode W.

Church W.R. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 99: 291-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) as a template. PCR was conducted using Pfu polymerase, a forward primer (primer 1) containing an NdeI restriction site (5′-CCGGGTGTGCATATGATCGTGGGAGGC-3′) and a reverse primer (primer 2) containing an XhoI restriction site (5′-GACCAGCCACTCGAGCTTTAATGGAGAGGA-3′). The resulting product was digested with the two enzymes, gel-purified, and ligated into the pTYB-2 vector digested previously with NdeI and XhoI. After transformation of XL-1 blue cells, the amplified product was isolated, and insert identity was verified by sequencing. A construct expressing a fusion protein bearing residues 16–116 of human factor Xa was prepared using primer 1 (above) and a reverse primer (5′-GACCAGCCACTCGAGCATGCGGAAGGT-3′) designed to amplify the truncated sequence of interest. For the expression of the catalytic domain of thrombin (residues 16–245), PCR was performed using cDNA for human prothrombin as a template and appropriate forward (5′-CCGGGTGTGCATATGATTGTGGAGGGC-3′) and reverse (5′-GACCAGCCACTCGAGCTCTCCAAACTGATC-3′) primers. The construct expressing a fusion protein of a mutant form of the catalytic domain of human Xa containing residues 92–102 from thrombin was prepared in three PCR steps. DNA fragments encoding residues 16–91 of human Xa and 92–102 of human thrombin were spliced to the sequence encoding 103–264 of human Xa using splicing by overlap extension (40Horton R.M. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Hunt H.D. Cai Z. Pease L.R. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 270-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). All resulting inserts in the pTYB-2 vector were verified by sequencing. The constructs were transformed into E 2566 cells, and the resulting single colonies were picked and amplified, and protein production was induced following the instructions provided with the Impact-CN kit.

J., Jiang, X.-M., Kisker, O., Flynn, E., Underwood, A., Condron, R., and Hogg, P. J. (2000) Nature 408, 869–873). The angiogenesis inhibitor, angiostatin, is cleaved from the reduced plasmin by a combination of serine- and metalloproteinases. The chemistry of protein reductants is typically mediated by a pair of closely spaced Cys residues. There are seven Cys in human PGK, and mutation of all seven to Ala did not appreciably affect plasmin reductase activity, although some of the mutations perturbed the tertiary structure of the protein. Cys-379 and Cys-380 are close to the hinge that links the N- and C-terminal domains of PGK. Alkylation/oxidation of Cys-379 and -380 by four different thiol-reactive compounds reduced plasmin reductase activity to 7–35% of control. Binding of 3-phosphoglycerate and/or MgATP to the N- and C-terminal domains of PGK, respectively, triggers a hinge bending conformational change in the enzyme. Incubation of PGK with 3-phosphoglycerate and/or MgATP ablated plasmin reductase activity, with half-maximal inhibitory effects at ∼1 mmconcentration. In summary, reduction of plasmin by PGK is a thiol-independent process, although either alkylation/oxidation of the fast-reacting Cys near the hinge or hinge bending conformational change in PGK perturbs plasmin reduction by PGK, perhaps by obstructing the interaction of plasmin with PGK or perturbing conformational changes in PGK required for plasmin reduction.

Cell. 1994; 79: 315-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3172) Google Scholar), which is an internal fragment of the plasma zymogen, plasminogen. Plasminogen contains five consecutive kringle domains followed by a serine proteinase module. Urokinase- or tissue-plasminogen activator converts plasminogen to plasmin by hydrolysis of a single peptide bond in the serine proteinase module. Plasmin is processed in the conditioned medium of tumor cells, producing angiostatin fragments consisting of kringle domains 1–4½, 1–4, and 1–3 (Ref. 6Lay A.J. Jiang X.-M. Kisker O. Flynn E. Underwood A. Condron R. Hogg P.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar and references therein). Plasmin proteolysis occurs in three stages. First, the Cys-462–Cys-541 and Cys-512–Cys-536 disulfide bonds in kringle 5 of plasmin are reduced by a plasmin reductase (5Stathakis P. Lay A.J. Fitzgerald M. Schlieker C. Matthias L.J. Hogg P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8910-8916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Second, reduction of the kringle 5 disulfide bonds triggers cleavage at Arg-530–Lys-531 in kringle 5 and also at 2 other positions C- terminal of Cys-462, by a serine proteinase (5Stathakis P.

Autoproteolysis can account for the cleavage (5Stathakis P. Lay A.J. Fitzgerald M. Schlieker C. Matthias L.J. Hogg P.J. J. Biol.

Third, the kringle 1–4½ fragments are cleaved by matrix metalloproteinases to produce either kringle 1–4 or 1–3 (12Dong Z. Kumar R. Yang X. Fidler I.J.

All three kringle-containing fragments have been shown to inhibit endothelial cell proliferation in vitro and angiogenesis in vivo (Ref. 15Cao R. Wu H.L. Veitonmaki N. Linden P. Farnebo J. Shi G.Y.

The plasmin reductase was recently purified from human fibrosarcoma cell-conditioned medium and shown to be the glycolytic enzyme, phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK1; ATP:3-phospho-d-glycerate 1-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.2.3) (6Lay A.J. Jiang X.-M. Kisker O. Flynn E. Underwood A. Condron R. Hogg P.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Plasma of mice bearing fibrosarcoma tumors contained severalfold more PGK than mice without tumors and administration of PGK to tumor-bearing mice caused an increase in plasma levels of angiostatin and a decrease in tumor vascularity and rate of tumor growth. Solid tumors employ PGK and other glycolytic enzymes to facilitate anaerobic production of ATP. These findings indicate that PGK plays an additional role in tumorigenesis by initiating an extracellular formation of angiostatin from plasmin. PGK is the sixth enzyme of the glycolytic pathway where it catalyzes the high energy phosphoryl transfer reaction from the acid anhydride bond of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate to the β-phosphate of MgADP. PGK also influences DNA replication and repair in mammalian cell nuclei (16Vishwanatha J.K. Jindal H.K. Davis R.G. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 25-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,17Popanda O. Fox G.

Mammalian PGKs contain seven Cys, and only two of the seven are nearby in the primary or tertiary structure (26Minard P. Desmadril M. Ballery N. Perahia D. Mouawad L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 185: 419-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Cys-379 and -380 are close to the hinge region and have been referred to as “fast-reacting” as they are amenable to alkylation by several thiol-reactive compounds (27Cserpán I. Vas M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 131: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The role of all seven Cys and in particular the two fast-reacting Cys in reduction of the plasmin disulfide bonds by PGK has been explored in this study. We show that none of the PGK Cys residues are directly involved in plasmin reduction but that alkylation/oxidation of the fast-reacting Cys or conformational changes in the same region of the protein inhibit reductase activity. 3-(N-Maleimidylpropionyl)biocytin (MPB) and dibromobimane (bBBr) were from Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR. HgCl2, sodium tetrathionate (TT), reduced (GSH) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG), 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), ATP, and 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PG) were from Sigma. Plasminogen was purified from fresh frozen human plasma and separated into its two carbohydrate variants according to Castellino and Powell (28Castellino F.J. Powell J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 365-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Glu-1-plasminogen was used in the experiments described herein. Urokinase plasminogen activator was a gift from Serono Australia. Plasmin was generated by incubating plasminogen (20 μm) with urokinase plasminogen activator (20 nm) for 30 min in 20 mm HEPES, 0.14m NaCl, pH 7.4, buffer at 37 °C. A 1.33-kilobase human PGK cDNA was isolated by reverse transcriptase-PCR from total RNA extracted from HT1080 cells as described previously (6Lay A.J. Jiang X.-M. Kisker O. Flynn E. Underwood A. Condron R. Hogg P.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The Cys residues at positions 379 and 380 in wild-type PGK were mutated to Ala by replacing the T at positions 1214 and 1217 to G and the G at positions 1215 and 1218 to C using the following primers and the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene, La Jolla, CA: 5′-GACACTGCCACTGCCGCTGCCAAATGGAACAC-3′ (forward, positions 1202–1233) and 5′-GTGTTCCATTTGGCAGCGGCAGTGGCAGTGTC-3′ (reverse, positions 1233–1202). The derived mutant was called C379A,C380A. Subsequently, Cys-367, -316, -108, -99, and -50 were cumulatively mutated to Ala using the same approach as for C379A,C380A. A single Cys-Ala mutation at position 50 was also generated using wt PGK as the template. The integrity of the mutant DNA was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. The PGK DNAs were sub-cloned into the plasmid vector, pET11a, which was then transfected intoEscherichia coli strain, BL21 (DE3) (Novagen, Madison, WI). Expression of recombinant protein was induced by 0.5 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 5 h at 37 °C. The BL21 cells were collected by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 15 min and resuspended in B-PER bacterial extraction reagent (Pierce) at a ratio of 60 ml.liter−1 of culture. The cells were lysed by sonication in the presence of 0.5% Triton X-100, and the lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 30 min. Solid (NH4)2SO4 was added slowly to the clarified supernatant to a concentration of 70% and stirred for 20 min at 4 °C. The pellet was collected by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min, and additional (NH4)2SO4 was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 90–100% and stirred for 20 min at 4 °C. The pellet was collected by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min, dissolved in 20 mmHEPES, 0.05 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.02% NaN3, pH 7.4, buffer and dialyzed extensively against the same buffer. The protein was applied to an 80-ml (2.5 × 17 cm) column of Cibachron Blue-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) equilibrated with the same HEPES buffer. The column was washed with 3 bed volumes of the HEPES buffer at a flow rate of 1 ml·min−1 to elute unbound proteins and developed with a 240-ml linear NaCl gradient from 0.05 to 2 m in the HEPES buffer. PGK eluted at ∼1 m NaCl. The eluate was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.9, buffer and applied to a 5-ml column of heparin-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was washed with 3 bed volumes of the Tris buffer at a flow rate of 0.5 ml·min−1 to elute unbound proteins and developed with a 40-ml linear NaCl gradient from 0.15 to 1 m in the Tris buffer. PGK eluted at ∼0.8 m NaCl. The purified PGK was dialyzed against 20 mm HEPES, 0.14 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, buffer and stored at −80 °C until use. Plasmin (2 μg.ml−1) was incubated with wt or mutant PGKs (1–40 μg.ml−1) in 20 mm HEPES, 0.14 m NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.4, buffer (HEPES/Tween) for 30 min at temperatures between 20 and 50 °C. On some occasions, the incubation buffer was 50 mm MES, 0.125 m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 6.0, 50 mm HEPES, 0.125 m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.0 or 50 mm HEPES, 0.125m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. On other occasions, the PGK was incubated with 3-PG (0–13 mm) and/or ATP (0–13 mm) and 1 mm MgCl2 in HEPES/Tween before the addition of plasmin. The control reactions were plasmin or PGK incubated alone in HEPES/Tween. Free thiols generated in plasmin/angiostatin were labeled with MPB (100 μm) for 30 min at 37 °C followed by quenching of the unreacted MPB with GSH (200 μm) for 10 min at 37 °C. Unreacted GSH and other free sulfhydryls in the system were blocked with NEM (400 μm) for 10 min at 37 °C. The plasmin kringle products were collected on 50 μl of packed lysine-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) beads by incubation on a rotating wheel for 1 h at room temperature, washed three times with HEPES/Tween, and eluted with 50 μl of 50 mm ε-amino-caproic acid in HEPES/Tween. Two assays for plasmin reduction were employed. In one assay, the MPB-labeled plasmin/angiostatin fragments were immobilized on wells coated with the murine anti-angiostatin monoclonal antibody, 8.19, and detected using streptavidin-peroxidase (6Lay A.J. Jiang X.-M. Kisker O. Flynn E. Underwood A. Condron R. Hogg P.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The 8.19 antibody (100 μl of 5 μg.ml−1 in 0.1 m NaHCO3, 0.02% NaN3, pH 8.3 buffer) was adsorbed to PolySorp 96-well plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) overnight at 4 °C in a humid environment. Wells were washed once with HEPES/Tween, and nonspecific binding sites were blocked by adding 200 μl of 5% nonfat milk powder in 20 mm HEPES, 0.14 m NaCl, 0.02% NaN3, pH 7.4, buffer and incubating for 90 min at 37 °C and then washed two times with HEPES/Tween. MPB-labeled plasmin/angiostatin fragments were diluted 1:8 in HEPES/Tween, and 100-μl aliquots were added to antibody-coated wells and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with orbital shaking. Wells were washed three times with HEPES/Tween, and 100 μl of 1:100 dilution of StreptABComplex/horseradish peroxidase (Dako, Carpinteria, CA) in HEPES/Tween was added and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with orbital shaking. Wells were washed three times, and the bound peroxidase was detected as described previously (5Stathakis P. Lay A.J. Fitzgerald M. Schlieker C. Matthias L.J. Hogg P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8910-8916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In the other assay, the MPB-labeled plasmin/angiostatin fragments were resolved on 8–16% SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA), blotted with a 1:2000 dilution of streptavidin horseradish peroxidase (Molecular Probes), then developed and visualized using chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). wt PGK (10 μm) was incubated with a 1-, 2-, or 4-fold molar excess of HgCl2, bBBr, or TT in 0.1 m HEPES, 0.3 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0, buffer for 1 h at room temperature. wt PGK (90 μm) was also incubated with a 1,000-fold molar excess of GSSG in the HEPES buffer for 2 h at room temperature, and the unreacted GSSG was removed by dialysis against the HEPES buffer. The untreated and alkylated PGKs (10 μm) were incubated with DTNB (200 μm) in 0.1 m HEPES, 0.3 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0, buffer for 30 min at room temperature. The absorbance at 412 nm due to the formation of the 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid dianion was measured using a Molecular Devices Thermomax Plus (Palo Alto, CA) microplate reader. The extinction coefficient for the 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid dianion at pH 7.0 is 14,150 m−1 cm−1 at 412 nm (29Riddles P.W. Blakeley R.L. Zerner B. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). The seven Cys in wt PGK were mutated to Ala in a cumulative fashion. The two fast-reacting Cys, Cys-379 and -380, were mutated first, and the resulting C379A,C380A PGK cDNA was then used to mutate Cys-367. The corresponding C379A,C380A,C367A PGK cDNA was then used to mutate Cys-316 and so forth. The Cys were mutated in the order, Cys-379, -380, -367, -316, -108, -99, and -50. The C50A PGK mutant was also made. The wt and mutant PGKs were expressed in E. coli and extracted with lysozyme. The extract was clarified by ammonium sulfate precipitation, and the protein was purified by affinity chromatography on Cibachron Blue-Sepharose and heparin-Sepharose. The wt and mutant PGKs were homogeneous by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). Different concentrations of the wt and mutant PGKs were incubated with plasmin in HEPES/Tween-buffered saline for 30 min at 37 °C, and the thiols in the reduced plasmin/angiostatin were labeled with MPB. The plasmin/angiostatin fragments were immobilized on antibody-coated wells, and the MPB was detected using streptavidin-peroxidase. The control reactions were the incubations of PGK or plasmin alone. These controls tested for any confounding effects of labeling of the existing free thiols in plasmin or PGK by MPB. Both reactions resulted in negligible signals. The specific plasmin reductase activity of the wt and mutant PGKs were similar, with the exception of the Cys-less PGK (C379A,C380A,C367A,C316A,C108A,C99A,C50A PGK) (Fig. 2 A). This result suggested that Cys-50, which was the last Cys to be mutated, was required for plasmin reductase activity. To test this hypothesis, the C50A PGK mutant was made and assayed for plasmin reductase activity. This C50A mutant had similar specific activity as wt PGK (Fig.2 A). The same qualitative results were observed for all the PGK mutants when plasmin reduction was measured by resolving the MPB-labeled proteins on SDS-PAGE and blotting with streptavidin-peroxidase to detect the labeled angiostatin fragments (Fig. 2 B). These results indicated that neither Cys-50 nor any of the other PGK Cys were required for plasmin reduction. We hypothesized that the Cys-less PGK had lost plasmin reductase activity due to secondary effects of the mutations on the integrity of the PGK tertiary structure. This theory was tested by examining the susceptibility of the mutant PGKs to proteolysis by plasmin. wt or mutant PGKs were incubated with plasmin, and proteolysis of the PGKs was examined by SDS-PAGE. wt PGK and the C379A,C380A,C379A, C380S,C367A,C316A, and C50A PGK mutants were resistant to plasmin proteolysis (Fig.3). In contrast, the C379A,C380A, C367A, C379A,C380A,C367A,C316A,C108A, C379A,C380A,C367A,C316A,C108A,C99A, and C379A,C380A,C367A,C316A, C108A,C99A,C50A PGK mutants were proteolysed by plasmin to different extents. In particular, the 6 and 7 Cys to Ala mutants were completely degraded by plasmin during the incubation. The proteolysis was plasmin-dependent, as all the PGKs remained intact after incubation with plasmin that had been inactivated with Val-Phe-Lys-chloromethyl ketone (not shown). The involvement of the PGK fast-reacting thiols in plasmin reduction was tested by modifying them with various alkylating/oxidizing reagents. Four different alkylating/oxidizing agents were employed; they were HgCl2, bBBr, TT, and GSSG. HgCl2 and bBBr have been used to alkylate the fast-reacting Cys in pig muscle PGK (30Vas M. Csanády G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 163: 365-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Reaction of PGK with all four alkylating/oxidizing agents reduced the number of reactive thiols per mol of PGK to ∼0.2–0.5 (Fig. 4, A–D). Equimolar concentrations of HgCl2, bBBr, and TT were maximally effective because a 4-fold molar excess of these agents did not change the number of residual thiols in PGK. Incubation of PGK with a 1,000-fold molar excess of GSSG reduced the number of reactive thiols per mol of PGK to ∼0.4. The alkylated/oxidized PGKs were tested for plasmin reductase activity. The PGKs were incubated with plasmin in HEPES/Tween-buffered saline for 30 min at 37 °C, and the thiols in the reduced plasmin/angiostatin were labeled with MPB. The plasmin/angiostatin fragments were immobilized on antibody-coated wells, and the MPB was detected using streptavidin-peroxidase. The activity of the modified proteins were reduced to 7–35% of control (Fig. 4 E). PGK was incubated with plasmin in different pH buffers for discrete times at 37 °C (Fig.5 A) with increasing concentrations of NaCl in pH 7.4 buffer for 30 min (Fig. 5 B) or at different temperatures in pH 7.4 buffer for 30 min (Fig.5 C). The thiols in the reduced plasmin/angiostatin were labeled with MPB and detected using streptavidin-peroxidase. The plasmin reductase activity of PGK was optimal at pH 7 at early time points of incubation. There was no obvious effect, however, of pH on plasmin reduction after 60 min of incubation. Increasing NaCl concentrations reduced plasmin reduction, although the effects were relatively modest. Reductase activity was reduced by 73% when the NaCl concentration was increased from 0 to 2 m. There was no substantial effect of temperature on plasmin reductase activity of PGK between 20 and 50 °C. The reactivity of the fast-reacting Cys in pig muscle PGK are reduced upon binding of 3-PG and/or MgATP to PGK (31Tompa P. Hong P.T. Vas M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 154: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This is a result of conformational changes in the enzyme induced by substrate binding (21Watson H.C. Walker N.P.C. Shaw P.J. Bryant T.N. Wendell P.L. Fothergill L.A. Perkins R.E. Conroy S.C. Dobson M.J. Tuite M.F. Kingsman A.J. Kingsman S.M. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 1635-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). The consequences of substrate-induced conformational changes in PGK for plasmin reductase activity was tested. PGK was incubated with plasmin in the absence or presence of 3-PG and/or ATP and 1 mm MgCl2 in HEPES/Tween-buffered saline for 30 min at 37 °C. The thiols in the reduced plasmin/angiostatin were labeled with MPB and detected using streptavidin-peroxidase. Incubation of PGK with 1 mm 3-PG or MgATP reduced plasmin reductase activity by ∼60%, whereas incubation with 1 mm3-PG and MgATP reduced activity by ∼90% (Fig.6 A). Titration of the inhibitory effects of 3-PG and MgATP on plasmin reductase activity is shown in Figs. 6, B and C. The half-maximal inhibitory effects of 3-PG and MgATP on plasmin reductase activity were ∼1 mm. Gallic and ellagic acid competitively inhibit PGK kinase activity (32Joao H.C. Williams R.J.P. Littlechild J.A. Nagasuma R. Watson H.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 1077-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar,33Hickey M.J. Coutts I.G.C. Tsang-Tan L.L. Pogson C.I. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 607Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Gallic acid appears to bind to the same site as MgATP (32Joao H.C. Williams R.J.P. Littlechild J.A. Nagasuma R. Watson H.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 1077-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Both gallic and ellagic acid at 100 μm concentration inhibited plasmin reduction by PGK by >80% (not shown). NAD(H), another adenine nucleotide, also inhibited plasmin reduction by >60% at 10 mm concentration, presumably through binding to the same site on PGK as MgATP (not shown). Protein reductant active sites typically contain a redox active dithiol/disulfide with the sequence, Cys-Gly-X-Cys (34Freedman R.B. Hirst T.R. Tuite M.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 331-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). The Cys thiols cycle between the reduced dithiol and oxidized disulfide bond in coordination with a dithiol or disulfide of a protein substrate. This can result in reduction, formation, or interchange of disulfide bonds in the protein substrate. There are seven Cys in PGK, none of which are involved in disulfide bonds, and only two of the seven are nearby in the primary or tertiary structure (22Blake C.C.F. Evans P.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 84: 585-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 23Harlos K. Vas M. Blake C.C.F. Proteins. 1992; 12: 133-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 24May A. Vas M. Harlos K.

This suggests that the mechanism by which PGK reduces disulfide bonds in plasmin is unconventional. We have reported that the plasmin reductase activity of PGK is inhibited by NEM and iodoacetamide (6Lay A.J. Jiang X.-M. Kisker O. Flynn E. Underwood A. Condron R. Hogg P.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), which implies a role for one or more of the PGK Cys residues in plasmin reduction. In this study we have explored the role of all seven PGK Cys and, in particular, the two fast-reacting Cys in reduction of plasmin disulfide bonds. The 7 Cys in PGK were mutated to Ala in a cumulative fashion in the order, Cys-379, -380, -367, -316, -108, -99, and -50. The two fast-reacting Cys, Cys-379 and -380, were mutated first, and the resulting cDNA was then used to mutate Cys-367 and so forth. The specific plasmin reductase activity of the mutant PGKs, with the exception of the Cys-less PGK, was similar to that of the wild-type protein. Some mutations were shown to change the tertiary structure of PGK, as measured by susceptibility to proteolysis by plasmin. For instance, the Cys-less PGK was rapidly degraded by plasmin, which probably accounted for the loss of plasmin reductase activity. These results implied that PGK Cys residues were not directly involved in plasmin reduction. The question remained, therefore, why alkylation of Cys-379 and -380 inhibited plasmin reduction. This question was explored by reacting the Cys residues with different alkylating/oxidizing agents and examining the consequences for plasmin reductase activity. Carboxymethylation, but not methylation, of the fast-reacting Cys of pig PGK inactivates the kinase activity (35Dékány K. Vas M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 139: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Reaction of the pig enzyme with DTNB also inactivates the kinase activity (27Cserpán I. Vas M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 131: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), whereas reaction with HgCl2 or bBBr reduces kinase activity by up to 80% (30Vas M. Csanády G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 163: 365-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). HgCl2 reacts with free thiols and can facilitate oxidation of a dithiol to a disulfide bond. bBBr is a homobifunctional alkylating agent that can cross-link thiols in close proximity. The fast-reacting thiols of PGK were also reacted with TT and GSSG. Accessible thiols react with these compounds to form mixed disulfides with thiosulfate and glutathione, respectively. Reaction of PGK with all four alkylating/oxidizing agents reduced the number of reactive thiols per mol of PGK to ∼0.2–0.5. The plasmin reductase activity of the modified proteins was reduced to 7–35% of control. These results indicate that alkylation of the fast-reacting thiols perturb plasmin reductase activity, which is consistent with our earlier report of inhibition of plasmin reductase activity by NEM and iodoacetamide (6Lay A.J. Jiang X.-M. Kisker O. Flynn E. Underwood A. Condron R. Hogg P.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Neither changes in pH, ionic strength, nor temperature markedly affected plasmin reductase activity, which implies that the reaction of PGK and plasmin involved predominantly hydrophobic interactions. Kinase substrate binding studies show that MgATP and MgADP bind to the inner surface of the C-domain (20Banks R.D. Blake C.C.F. Evans P.R. Haser R. Rice D.W. Hardy G.W. Merrett M. Phillips A.W.

The bound substrates are ≥10 Å from each other, too large a distance for direct in-line phosphoryl transfer. The enzyme overcomes this distance by undergoing a hinge bending conformational change that brings the two substrates closer together. The reactivity of both the fast-reacting thiols is reduced by binding of 3-PG and/or MgADP and MgATP to PGK (31Tompa P. Hong P.T. Vas M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 154: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Moreover, carboxyamidomethylation of the two fast-reacting Cys in pig PGK blocks the substrate-induced hinge bending conformational change in the enzyme (37Sinev M.A. Razgulyaev O.I. Vas M. Timchenko A.A. Ptitsyn O.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that alkylation of the fast-reacting thiols in PGK can perturb the conformational changes required for kinase activity. We tested the effect of 3-PG/MgADP-induced conformational changes in PGK for plasmin reductase activity. Incubation of PGK with 1 mm 3-PG or MgATP reduced plasmin reductase activity by ∼60%, whereas incubation with 1 mm 3-PG and MgATP reduced activity by ∼90%. The half-maximal effects of 3-PG and MgATP on plasmin reductase activity were ∼1 mm, which is in the range of the Michaelis constants for these substrates in the kinase reaction (38McHarg J. Kelly S.M. Price N.C. Cooper A. Littlechild J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 939-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that the effects of 3-PG and MgATP were additive, which may reflect cooperativity between 3-PG and MgATP in the conformational change in PGK. These findings indicate that hinge bending conformational change in PGK negates the plasmin reductase activity of the protein. A model of the molecular events facilitated by PGK in plasmin kringle 5 is shown in Fig. 7. We have previously proposed that both the Cys-462–Cys-541 and Cys-512–Cys-536 disulfide bonds in plasmin kringle 5 are cleaved, which renders kringle 5 susceptible to proteolysis at either the Arg-530–Lys-531 peptide bond or two other unidentified peptide bonds (5Stathakis P.

The other peptide bonds are likely to be Arg-474–Val-475 (5Stathakis P. Lay A.J. Fitzgerald M. Schlieker C. Matthias L.J. Hogg P.J. J. Biol.

Plasmin undergoes autoproteolysis in alkaline pH, producing a catalytically active microplasmin fragment with a Lys-531 N terminus. Wu et al. (40Wu H.-L. Shi G.-Y. Bender M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8292-8295Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 41Wu H.-L. Shi G.-Y. Wohl R.C. Bender M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We have suggested that the mechanism of plasmin proteolysis at alkaline pH is the same as the mechanism of proteolysis facilitated by PGK at neutral pH (5Stathakis P. Lay A.J. Fitzgerald M.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3258-3271Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) reveal that the left-handed Cys-512–Cys-536 bond has a high strain energy (2.63 kcal.mol−1) compared with the right-handed Cys-462–Cys-541 (1.54 kcal.mol−1) and left-handed Cys-483–Cys-524 (0.98 kcal.mol−1) disulfide bonds. The average dihedral strain energies for left- and right-handed disulfide bonds are 1.68 and 3.19 kcal.mol−1, respectively (42Katz B.A. Kossiakoff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15480-15485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Weiner S.J. Kollman P.A. Case D.A. Singh U.C. Ghio C. Alagona G. Profeta Jr., S. Weiner P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 765-784Crossref Scopus (4885) Google Scholar). A high dihedral strain energy correlates with ease of cleavage of the disulfide bond (42Katz B.A. Kossiakoff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15480-15485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We propose, therefore, that PGK facilitates cleavage of the Cys-512–Cys-536 disulfide bond by −OH, which results in formation of a sulfenic acid at position 512 and a free thiol at Cys-536. The Cys-536 thiol is then available to exchange with the Cys-462–Cys-541 disulfide bond, resulting in formation of a new disulfide at Cys-536–Cys-541 and a free thiol at Cys-462. Kringle 5 is then susceptible to proteolysis at Arg-530–Lys-531, Arg-474–Val-475, and/or Lys-468–Gly-469. This is the simplest sequence of events that can explain all the available data. For instance, cleavage of only the Cys-512–Cys-536 would not enable release of the kringle 1–4 angiostatin fragments from plasmin. The free thiol that is labeled by MPB in the three angiostatin fragments would be Cys-462. We do not exclude cleavage of the Cys-483–Cys-524 disulfide bond, although this is not required to explain the experimental observations. PGK presumably binds to plasmin and induces a conformational change in kringle 5 that facilitates the −OH attack on the Cys-512–Cys-536 disulfide bond. This suggests that other molecules that interact with plasmin might also facilitate cleavage of the kringle 5 disulfides. There is recent evidence to support this hypothesis. Interaction of a truncated porcine plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (residues 80–265), but not full-length protein, with plasmin has been shown to result in generation of kringle-containing angiostatin fragments (45Mulligan-Kehoe M.J. Wagner R. Wieland C. Powell R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8588-8596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It is possible that the truncated protein facilitates the same sequence of events in plasmin that are achieved by PGK."
https://openalex.org/W2034832743,"The object of this work stems from our previous studies on the mechanisms responsible of ribose-1-phosphate- and 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate-mediated nucleobase salvage and 5-fluorouracil activation in rat brain (Mascia, L., Cappiello M., Cherri, S., and Ipata, P. L. (2000) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1474, 70-74; Mascia, L., Cotrufo, T., Cappiello, M., and Ipata, P. L. (1999) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1472, 93-98). Here we show that when ATP at physiological concentration is added to dialyzed extracts of rat brain in the presence of natural nucleobases or 5-fluorouracil, adenine-, hypoxanthine-, guanine-, uracil-, and 5-fluorouracil-ribonucleotides are synthesized. The molecular mechanism of this peculiar nucleotide synthesis relies on the capacity of rat brain to salvage purine and pyrimidine bases by deriving ribose-1-phosphate and 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate from ATP even in the absence of added pentose or pentose phosphates. The levels of the two sugar phosphates formed are compatible with those of synthesized nucleotides. We propose that the ATP-mediated 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate synthesis occurs through the action of purine nucleoside phosphorylase, phosphopentomutase, and 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate synthetase. Furthering our previous observations on the effect of ATP in the 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate-mediated 5-fluorouracil activation in rat liver (Mascia, L., and Ipata, P. L. (2001) Biochem. Pharmacol. 62, 213-218), we now show that the ratio [5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate]/[ATP] plays a major role in modulating adenine salvage in rat brain. On the basis of our in vitro results, we suggest that massive ATP degradation, as it occurs in brain during ischemia, might lead to an increase of the intracellular 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate and ribose-1-phosphate pools, to be utilized for nucleotide resynthesis during reperfusion."

Energy homeostasis (appetitive behavior and metabolism) is influenced by physiological events that occur in both peripheral tissues and the central nervous system. Within the central nervous system, specific hypothalamic nuclei have been identified which are key sites for the integration of these peripheral and central signals (for review, see Ref. 1Schwartz M.W. Woods S.C. Randy Jr., D.P. Seeley R.J. Baskin D.G. Nature. 2000; 404: 661-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (4910) Google Scholar). Because of its key role in regulating energy homeostasis, the hypothalamus has become the focus of intensive research, and targeting of hypothalamic neuronal pathways is presently one of the most actively pursued pharmaceutical strategies for controlling obesity. Whereas prior research has identified various hypothalamic neuroanatomical pathways involved in energy homeostasis and identified many regulatory molecules involved in that process, there remains a huge gap in the scientific understanding of how the various hypothalamic neuronal pathways and regulatory molecules are integrated. Furthermore, in all likelihood, critical regulatory molecules remain to be identified. Analysis of hypothalamic transcriptional changes that occur with energy homeostasis is potentially a useful approach to filling those gaps in our knowledge. Differential display PCR was used to identify melanin-concentrating hormone as an important hypothalamic orexigenic factor (2Qu D. Ludwig D.S. Gammeltoft S. Piper M. Pelleymounter M.A. Cullen M.J. Mathes W.F. Przypek J. Kanarek R. Maratos-Flier E. Nature. 1996; 380: 243-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar). The cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART)1 was originally isolated using differential display PCR to identify genes that were up-regulated in the striatum by psychomotor stimulants. Later CART was found to act within the hypothalamus as an important anorexigenic factor (3Kristensen P. Judge M.E. Thim L. Ribel U. Christjansen K.N. Wulff B.S. Clausen J.T. Larsen P.J. Hastrup S. Nature. 1998; 393: 72-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (1094) Google Scholar). However, use of oligonucleotide microarrays to interrogate a large number of genes that are differentially expressed with conditions that influence energy homeostasis has not yet been reported. We have undertaken studies to examine changes in hypothalamic gene expression associated with alterations in nutritional status using oligonucleotide microarrays containing 26,379 probe sets. We present data for gene expression changes induced in the rodent hypothalamus by 48 h of food deprivation. Nine-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan Laboratories, Madison, WI) weighing 280–300 g were used for microarray studies. Rats within a treatment group were housed in the same cage under conditions that are in accordance with the University of Michigan Unit of Laboratory Animal Medicine guidelines. Animals were maintained at 22 ± 2 °C in a room with a 12-h light-dark cycle. The University Committee on Use and Care of Animals approved all animal experiments. The overall experiment was repeated five times. For each of the five experiments, four rats were in the Fed group and four rats were in the Fasted group. Therefore, 20 fed and 20 fasted rats were eventually used to obtain five separate paired RNA samples (five separate fed RNA samples and five separate fasted RNA samples). Animals in Fed group were allowed free access to regular rat chow and water throughout the 48-h time course of the experiments. Animals in Fasted group were food-deprived for the 48-h time course of the experiments but were allowed free access to water. At the end of the 48-h period animals were sequentially euthanized. Experiments were initiated at 10:00 h, and all dissections were performed between 10:00 and 11:00 h. Hypothalami were rapidly microdissected, placed into a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube, and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Hypothalamic RNA from individual rats was later extracted using a Dounce homogenizer and TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen). After the 75% ethanol wash step in the TRIzol extraction procedure, RNA from each hypothalamus was dissolved in water, and RNA corresponding to each treatment group was pooled. An additional cleanup step was then performed using Qiagen RNeasy. 5 μg of total RNA was converted into double-stranded cDNA using a cDNA synthesis kit (Superscript Choice System, Invitrogen) with an oligo(dT)24 primer containing a T7 RNA polymerase promoter on its 3′-end (Genset, La Jolla, CA). After second strand synthesis, labeled cRNA was generated from the cDNA sample by an in vitro transcription reaction supplemented with biotin-11-CTP and biotin-16-UTP (Enzo, Farmingdale, NY). The labeled cRNA was purified using a Qiagen RNeasy spin column. 15 μg of each cRNA was fragmented at 94 °C for 35 min in fragmentation buffer (40 mm Tris acetate (pH 8.1), 100 mm potassium acetate, 30 mm magnesium acetate) and then used to prepare 300 μl of hybridization mixture (100 mm MES, 1 m NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, 0.01% Tween 20) containing 0.1 mg/ml herring sperm DNA (Promega, Madison WI), 500 μg/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin (Invitrogen), and a mixture of control cRNAs for comparison of hybridization efficiency between arrays and for relative quantitation of measured transcript levels. Before hybridization the mixtures were heated to 94 °C for 5 min, equilibrated at 45 °C for 5 min, then clarified by centrifugation (16,000 × g) at room temperature for 5 min. Aliquots of each sample (10 μg of fragmented cRNA in 200 μl of hybridization mixture) were hybridized to the Affymetrix Rat Genome U34A, B or C arrays, at 45 °C for 16 h in a rotisserie oven set at 60 rpm. The arrays were then washed with nonstringent wash buffer (6 × SSPE) at 25 °C followed by a stringent wash buffer (100 mm MES (pH 6.7), 0.1m NaCl, 0.01% Tween 20) at 50 °C, stained with streptavidin-phycoerythrin (Molecular Probes), washed again with 6 × SSPE, stained with biotinylated anti-streptavidin IgG, followed by a second staining with streptavidin-phycoerythrin, and a third washing with 6 × SSPE. Microarrays were scanned using the GeneArray scanner (Affymetrix). Details of the Affymetrix microarray have been described elsewhere (4Lipshutz R.J. Fodor S.P. Gingeras T.R. Lockhart D.J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 20-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (1868) Google Scholar). Notably, however, in our analysis of the data, Affymetrix probe level data were reexamined using methodology developed in this laboratory. To determine the presence or absence of a gene we reexamined the PM and MM differences derived from all probe cells of each probe set using software which we developed to read the Affymetrix .CEL files. In this analysis, for each type of chip (RG-U34A, B, or C) a standard chip with low background and noise was selected. Probe pairs for which either the PM or MM feature was saturated (pure white) on the standard image, as well as those for which PM was less than MM < −1,000 were excluded from further consideration. Saturated cells (with measures at least 98% of the saturated value) were imputed separately for PM or MM values. The estimated level for a saturated PM was given by the ratios of nonsaturated PM values from the same probe set divided by the homologous PM values of the standard. Then the average of these ratios (by taking the anti-logarithm of the mean of the log ratios) was multiplied by the PM value of the standard (the homolog of the saturated PM) to impute the estimated value to the saturated PM for the chip under consideration. The MM values were imputed similarly. A nonparametric Wilcoxon test was then performed on the adjusted PM-MM differences to judge whether the transcript represented by the probe set was present or absent. In this study we classified probe sets as present if the p value was less than 0.01 and absent if thep value was greater than 0.01. To determine a gene's expression level with a numerical value analogous to Affymetrix's average difference, we computed the mean of the PM-MM differences, after trimming away 25% of the highest and lowest such differences. Data were then quantile normalized by adjusting the sorted average intensities to more nearly match that of standard chips by making 100 individual quantiles have the same values, using a linear spline (i.e. a monotone piecewise linear transformation). Then a log transformation was applied to the rescaled data before performing a paired Student t test to find out which genes were involved in fasting. After this initial treatment of the Affymetrix data several innovative procedures were utilized to identify differentially expressed genes. We first limited the “universe” of genes for further analysis by excluding those that we felt could not be analyzed reliably. In the case of the fed versus 48-h fasted rats there was a total of 10 present or absent calls for each of the 26,379 probe sets from the five experiments. We retained only those genes that had more present than absent calls according to the Wilcoxon test (i.e. at least 6 of 10 present calls). Second we imposed a procedure that we refer to as “directional consistency.” A gene was said to have directional consistency if it exhibited the same direction of change (positive or negative) in four of five or five of five experiments. Third we imposed a procedure that we referred to as “degree of variability.” We analyzed only those genes that did not display too much variability in their expression level (i.e. in their log-transformed average difference change) in the five experiments. In each category (Fast or Fed), for three, four, or five of five samples the ratio of the average difference over the mean average difference across all samples used had to be below a threshold of ±26%. We analyzed the data further using a paired t test. The samples were divided into two groups with the first five corresponding to the Fasted group and the last five to the Fed group. Matched pair comparisons were examined between the measurements obtained on different days. To analyze individual genes within the larger statistically significant group of differentially expressed genes we added several additional criteria. First, the degree of -fold change of a gene based on rescaled data in the fed and fasted states was determined. Second, ap value was determined based on that gene's log-transformed data. A p value less than 0.05 was necessary for a gene to be examined further, although several genes with p values of greater than 0.05 were also examined (see “Results” and “Discussion”). In addition, an arbitrary cut-off of mean -fold change of greater than 1.2 or less than −1.2, i.e. a change in gene expression of 20% from base line, was also used to trim the number of genes examined even further. Information about a gene obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) data base and Medline was also used. Northern blot analysis used to validate microarray changes secondarily was performed using standard methods (5Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.43-7.50Google Scholar). Sprague-Dawley rats, C57BL/6 mice,ob/ob mice (C57BL/6OlaHsd-Lepob), lean obese mice (C57BL/6OlaHsd-lean), Zucker fa/fa rats (HsdHlr:Zucker-fa), and lean Zucker rats (HsdHlr:Zucker-lean) were all obtained from Harlan (Madison, WI). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as the endogenous control for the quantitation of gene expression. Autoradiograms were quantified with a Hewlett-Packard ScanJet 4C/T scanner and the NIH Image 1.55 program. In the case of the gene encoding the enzyme minoxidil sulfotransferase (MST), reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-QPCR) was used to examine changes in gene expression in the unilateral hypothalami of individual animals. Microdissection of hypothalamic nuclei was performed as described by Palkovits (6Palkovits M. Brain Res. 1973; 59: 449-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1351) Google Scholar). RT-QPCR was performed on an Applied Biosystems, Inc. PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System using FAM-labeled fluorogenic probes. β-Actin was used as the endogenous control for the quantitation of gene expression. Our probe set trimming procedure yielded 8,075 expressed genes having at least 6 of 10 present calls determined by the Wilcoxon test as it was applied to the entire universe of probe sets that were examined in the five Fed and five Fasted groups. 3,604 genes had 10 of 10 present calls in this experimental comparison. This selection procedure enabled us to focus our attention on those genes that exhibited a fairly strong hybridization signal. To determine whether the trimming procedure had placed more genes in the Fed versus Fasted groups, or vice versa, we examined the bivariate distribution of fed and fasted genes. As shown in Fig. 1, the bivariate distribution of the number of present calls in the two treatment groups was fairly balanced. This indicated that our trimming procedure had simply limited the number of genes to be analyzed without placing more genes in one of the two treatment groups. It can be seen that ∼40% of the genes received absent calls in all 10 samples using ap value for the Wilcoxon sign rank test of 0.01 for the present call. About 13.5% of the genes received present calls in all 10 samples. Importantly, as determined from the analysis depicted in Fig. 1, our trimming procedure based on a present call of greater than or equal to 6 of 10 encompassed virtually all potentially relevant genes. There were only seven genes that fell outside of this cut-off,i.e. were undetectable in the Fed group and had 5 present calls in the Fasted group. It is possible that these latter genes might have potential physiological relevance. Notably, there were no genes that displayed a characteristic whereby they had 5 present calls in the Fed group and were undetectable in the Fasted group. The seven genes that were only detectable in the Fasted group included genes with GenBank accession numbers AI059503 (exportin-1), AI058953(sodium-coupled nucleoside transporter), and cDNAs/expressed sequence tags (ESTs) AI044721, AI104215, AA942995, AA848964, andAA945453. All of these latter cDNAs/expressed sequence tags, with the exception of AA848964, have been catalogued in NCBI data bases as being expressed in neural tissue. To examine our criterion of directional consistency we first examined the number of probe sets with a p value less than 0.05 contained within each category of present call and then examined the proportion of probe sets with ap value less than 0.05 within each category of present call. As depicted in Fig. 2, based on the stringency of our statistical analysis of the microarray data we have identified a number of candidate hypothalamic energy homeostatic genes. Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 2 A, the number of probe sets with a p less than 0.05 remains remarkably stable despite differences in the number of present calls. Fig. 2 B shows that with increasing directional consistency one observes a greater proportion of probe sets with p values less than 0.05. This indicates that the p value is not correlated with the present call and demonstrates that the number of present or absent calls did not bias our analysis. Table I lists the differentially expressed genes obtained from our analysis. These genes were defined by the criteria of possessing a present call of at least 9 of 10, a directional consistency of at least 4 of 5, a p value of < 0.05 for their log-transformed rescaled data, and a degree of -fold change greater than 20%. Neuropeptide Y, one of our index genes, whose expression is known to increase with fasting, was contained in this group of genes. Two other index genes, which are known to decrease with fasting, proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and CART, were only present in our differentially expressed group of genes if the criterion ofp value was excluded from our definition of differentially expressed genes.Table IFasting effects on genesGenbank accession no.DescriptionFed meanFast meanPaired t testFold changeIncrease with fastingAI228929Brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 3 (B, R)4647370.0251.588L19998Rat MST mRNA (B, M)144422730.00111.562AI010593Putative transcription factor ALF-4 (B, R)185726030.03231.471AI176456Metallothionein II (B, M)169725000.01171.461AA942930Rattus norvegicus cDNA (B)178825620.04571.451AI059426Connexin 30 (B, S)354849640.02351.413AA998957R. norvegicus cDNA (B)140119560.02581.412AI059929R. norvegicus cDNA (B)226931860.01021.411AI102787R. norvegicus cDNA (B)7109590.03821.394Up-regulated by 1,25- dihydroxyvitamin D3AI237654(B, ?)7079920.04981.379AI176028Nephronophthisis 1 homolog (B, ?)99713460.04911.370AI176700R. norvegicus cDNA (B)117415530.04261.364AA996499Complement component 1, q subcomponent (B, R)350747090.00251.351AA997045R. norvegicus cDNA (B)7119430.0071.339AA946551Adductin 1 (alpha) (B, S)271436230.02311.338AI178736R. norvegicus cDNA (B)108914090.02211.319AA924036R. norvegicus cDNA (B)187424320.04521.307AA819487Cervical cancer receptor (B, R)112214490.04211.302M15880Neuropeptide Y mRNA (B, R)274435750.00661.301Myelin-associated oligodendrocyticD28110Basic protein (B, S)476760230.04141.296AI137592R. norvegicus cDNA (B)83510080.04751.272AI136858R. norvegicus cDNA (B)159219930.03031.267AA944304Tumor protein D52 (B, ?)349444110.04961.261Heterogeneous nuclear ribonuclear protein LAA925541(B, R)784397740.01291.250AI029670R. norvegicus cDNA (B)181121960.04671.250AA957491Gankyrin (B, R)303137630.00721.249AI007727R. norvegicus cDNA (B)375445240.02571.237AI234248Cytochromec oxidase subunit 1 (B, M)733191250.00531.233S75687Glutamate/aspartate transporter (B, M)256031640.04231.232AI011716R. norvegicus cDNA (B)374545330.04091.225AA945769R. norvegicus cDNA (B)174721430.04881.221AA926265ADP-ribosylation factor-like protein 5 (B, M)303836970.00041.220AB003992SNAP-25B (B, R)257031950.03661.215H33079R. norvegicus cDNA (B)154218800.03241.212AI178204R. norvegicus cDNA (B)173320870.02071.211Myelin-associated/oligodendrocytic basicAA819183protein-81 (B, S)651078270.02941.205AI013650R. norvegicus cDNA (B)313037490.00921.204similar to phosphoserine aminotransferaseAI230228(B, M)325939200.01851.203L19933Protein-tyrosine phosphatase mRNA (B, R)256230540.00331.201AI228462R. norvegicus cDNA (B)180721500.04611.201Decrease with fastingAA944335R. norvegicus cDNA (B)794965790.0075−1.207AA850554Glycosylphosphatidylinositol 1 homolog (B, M)537444640.0489−1.207AI013913R. norvegicus cDNA (B)158012990.0209−1.210D37920Squalene epoxidase (ND, M)204416910.0332−1.211AI169751β-Interferon-induced mRNA (B, ?)398432650.0055−1.218AI044404R. norvegicus cDNA (B)231919080.018−1.225Thyroid hormone receptor coactivatingAA925437protein (B, R)151212160.0369−1.226AI060012R. norvegicus cDNA (B)172113960.001−1.232AI058940R. norvegicus cDNA (B)699656580.0356−1.236AI058647R. norvegicus cDNA (B)137710950.0193−1.249AI229029Tubulin-β 3 (B, S)865469060.021−1.258AI172293Neurorep 1 (B, ?)475737910.0009−1.259X62875High mobility group protein I (Y) (B, R)282522630.0277−1.264AA946453R. norvegicus cDNA (B)304023930.0251−1.277AA943042Casein kinase 1 γ2 isoform (B, M)375229500.0074−1.279AI103159Interferon-inducible protein 16 (B, ?)361828130.0298−1.280AI009363R. norvegicus cDNA (B)202115540.0052−1.294AI045669R. norvegicus cDNA (B)167112500.0367−1.297AI071578R. norvegicus cDNA (B)10998460.0218−1.298AA997745Nemo-like kinase (B, M)12259480.011−1.308AI232155R. norvegicus cDNA (B)149311360.0026−1.321AI072646R. norvegicus cDNA (B)504736730.0047−1.358AI137259R. norvegicus cDNA (B)172412770.0154−1.363AI171268Inhibitor of DNA binding 3 (B, R)310223030.0421−1.374AI044045R. norvegicus cDNA (ND)226016010.0336−1.392AA944938Small GTP-binding protein Rab 9 (B, R)8886320.0412−1.398M26594Malic enzyme gene (B, M)8506040.0442−1.401AI180172Ceroid lipofuscinosis gene, neuronal 3 (B, ?)143110350.0085−1.409AA942850PSD-95/SAP90-associated protein 3 (B, ?)203414250.0377−1.409AI235931R. norvegicus cDNA (B)176312500.0474−1.423AI059707R. norvegicus cDNA (B)238816360.0128−1.427AI059937R. norvegicus cDNA (B)10306960.0464−1.478AA899106Cyclin D2 (B, R)158710700.0187−1.483AA924140R. norvegicus cDNA (B)9776280.0457−1.498The genes listed have at least 9 out of 10 present calls, 4 out of 5 directional consistency, a p < 0.5 for their log-transformed rescaled data, and a change of greater than 20%.

ND denotes that the NCBI data base has not documented that a cDNA/expressed sequence tag is expressed in neural tissue. The genes in Table I, with the exception of two, are genes that have been catalogued in NCBI data bases as being expressed in the brain (B). This is entirely consistent with the hybridization of a neuronal tissue, in this instance hypothalamus, to the oligonucleotide microarrays. Genes in Table I are recognized to have metabolic function (M), a regulatory function (R), or structural function (S). A question mark (?) indicates a gene that has no known function. With regard to the two genes not documented as being expressed in neuronal tissue, this observation does not exclude the possibility of their expression in neuronal tissue, but simply indicates that to date they have not been identified there. Among the set of genes with 10 of 10 present calls and 5 of 5 directional consistency the gene that increased the most in the fasted state was the gene encoding the enzyme MST. Because of its uniformity of expression and magnitude of its change we examined the expression of MST mRNA by Northern blot analysis in the 48-h fasted rat, 48-h fasted mouse, and two models of rodent obesity, the fa/fa rat (a rodent with a defective leptin receptor) and the ob/ob mouse (a rodent that lacks the adipose tissue hormone leptin). The mRNA of the 48-h fasted rodents and the rodents that are genetically obese were compared with nonfasted rodents or nonfasted lean littermates, respectively. Shown in Fig. 3 are the results of that Northern blot analysis. The MST transcript was increased an average of 203% in the 48-h fasted Sprague-Dawley rats compared with freely fed control animals. The 48-h fasted C57BL/6 mouse displayed an average of 308% increase over freely fed control animals. The fattyZucker rat (fa/fa rat) and the obese mouse (ob/ob mouse) displayed an 80% increase and 61% increase, respectively, in expression of the MST mRNA compared with their lean littermates. The Northern blots shown in Fig. 3 are representative examples of the three Northern blots that were performed for each rodent type. The percent change listed in Fig. 3, however, is an average calculated from the expression levels observed in all three Northern blots. To examine further the up-regulation of MST mRNA expression in the fasted state we examined MST mRNA expression in individual unilateral microdissected hypothalamic nuclei of the fed and fasted rat. Two hypothalamic nuclei that are recognized to be involved in energy homeostasis, the arcuate nucleus (ARC) and the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), were examined. As shown in TableII, MST was found to be up-regulated in a statistically significant manner in those two microdissected hypothalamic nuclei.Table IIChanges in MST gene transcription determined by RT-QPCR in individual unilateral microdissected hypothalamic nuclei that are recognized to be involved in energy homeostasisFedFastedARC 13.2 × 10−35.2 × 10−3ARC 21.8 × 10−310.0 × 10−3ARC 32.5 × 10−316.0 × 10−3ARC 42.4 × 10−317.0 × 10−3ARC 512.0 × 10−319.0 × 10−3ARC 61.3 × 10−318.0 × 10−3ARC 71.5 × 10−39.6 × 10−3ARC 80.41 × 10−31.3 × 10−3PVN 10.51 × 10−37.0 × 10−3PVN 20.72 × 10−35.5 × 10−3PVN 32.4 × 10−36.8 × 10−3PVN 40.37 × 10−34.4 × 10−3PVN 50.54 × 10−38.5 × 10−3PVN 62.2 × 10−37.3 × 10−3PVN 70.19 × 10−32.3 × 10−3PVN 80.34 × 10−32.6 × 10−3Note that unilateral nuclei from four rats were used, which equals a total of eight samples.

In these studies we explored the feasibility of using oligonucleotide microarrays to obtain a broad overview of the transcriptional changes that accompany the complex hypothalamic neuronal process of energy homeostasis. Using the method of analysis outlined under “Experimental Procedures,” we were able to identify sets of genes that displayed a statistically significant probability of undergoing transcriptional change with fasting. To limit the universe of genes (26,379) examined and increase the probability of selecting only those genes with a greater chance of having statistically significant changes a present call of at least 6 of 10 was chosen for these studies.

While dynacortin is highly enriched in the cortex, particularly in cell-surface protrusions, it is excluded from the cleavage furrow cortex during cytokinesis. Here, we describe the biochemical characterization of this new protein. Purified dynacortin is an 80-kDa dimer with a large 5.7-nm Stokes radius. Dynacortin cross-links actin filaments into parallel arrays with a mole ratio of one dimer to 1.3 actin monomers and a 3.1 μm K d. Using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, GFP-dynacortin and the actin bundling protein coronin-GFP are seen to concentrate in highly dynamic cortical structures with assembly and disassembly half-lives of about 15 s. These results indicate that cells have evolved different actin-filament cross-linking proteins with complementary cellular distributions that collaborate to orchestrate complex cell shape changes.

Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R737-R740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Changes in the cortical shape of a cell depend primarily on the actin filament network. Localized forces are either expansive as the result of new actin filament polymerization or contractile typically as a result of the activity of actin-based motor proteins of the myosin superfamily. The cell's material properties include the stiffness and surface tension, which are determined, in part, by the cross-linking of the actin cortical cytoskeleton. Actin-associated proteins determine the stability and the degree of cross-linking of the filament network and may help to identify the locations where expansive and contractile force generation may occur. Cytokinesis is an elegant cellular process because both contractile force generation and new actin filament polymerization act in concert to produce the desired dynamic shape changes. A role for global and spatial activities has been well observed in Dictyostelium discoideum cytokinesis. Factors that are globally distributed and factors recruited to the cleavage furrow are both required for cytokinesis (reviewed in Ref. 2Robinson D.N. Spudich J.A. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 228-237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Genetically, an interaction between global and regional proteins has been demonstrated and from this at least two interacting genetic modules have been proposed to control cytokinesis (3Robinson D.N. Spudich J.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 823-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The first module includes the actin-binding proteins cortexillin I and myosin-II (4DeLozanne A. Spudich J.A. Science. 1987; 236: 1086-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar, 5Faix J. Steinmetz M. Boves H. Kammerer R.A. Lottspeich F. Mintert U. Murphy J. Stock A. Aebi U. Gerisch G. Cell. 1996; 86: 631-642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Myosin-II is a force generating protein that probably produces the majority of the force required for cell cleavage. Cortexillin I was originally identified biochemically as an actin filament-binding protein and has been demonstrated to collaborate with myosin-II to define a spatially restricted midzone of contractility (6Weber I. Neujahr R. Du A. Köhler J. Faix J. Gerisch G. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 501-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The second module is a global pathway that is controlled by the RacE small GTPase and includes dynacortin and the actin bundling protein coronin (3Robinson D.N. Spudich J.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 823-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 7deHostas E.L. Rehfueß C. Bradtke B. Waddell D.R. Albrecht R. Murphy J. Gerisch G. J.

Three of these proteins, RacE, myosin-II, and cortexillin I, have been shown to contribute to the bending modulus and/or surface tension (also in-plane elasticity) of the cell (9Gerald N. Dai J.

Dynacortin, originally discovered in a suppressor screen of acortexillin I mutant cell line, is a novel protein of low complexity (100 hydroxyamino acids out of 354 total amino acids) (3Robinson D.N. Spudich J.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 823-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The protein is distributed globally in the cell cortex and becomes enriched in cell surface protrusions. During cell division, it maintains its global cortical association, becomes enriched at the ruffling poles of the cell and appears to be diminished in the cleavage furrow. This is in stark contrast to the high enrichment of cortexillin I and myosin-II in the cleavage furrow cortex during this time (12Moores S.L. Sabry J.H. Spudich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar,13Weber I. Gerisch G. Heizer C. Murphy J. Badelt K. Stock A. Schwartz J.-M. Faix J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 586-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the distribution of dynacortin and the actin cross-linking protein coronin along the lateral cortex (regions between protrusions) depends on the RacE small GTPase. Dynacortin is a soluble phosphoprotein that is found in a complex with a large Stokes radius. Using a library complementation system for D. discoideum, a truncated cDNA of dynacortin, which encodes the carboxyl 181 amino acids of the protein, was isolated by its ability to suppress the loss of cortexillin I. In contrast, the full-length version of dynacortin did not suppress the cortexillin I mutants. Expression of the truncated protein caused a downshift in the apparent Stokes radius of the endogenous dynacortin complex, suggesting that the native dynacortin complex is multimeric. Together, these observations suggest that the suppressing version of dynacortin may be interrupting normal dynacortin function. Identification of dynacortin's biochemical activity is essential to understand the function of the protein complex and to begin to understand how perturbing this global activity can compensate for the loss of cortexillin I. In this paper, we describe the purification of the native dynacortin complex from D. discoideum and demonstrate that it is homomeric. Since the purified protein from D. discoideum was limiting in amount, we expressed and purified a recombinant form fromEscherichia coli. The recombinant protein has an identical Stokes radius to the native D. discoideum complex and directly binds and bundles actin filaments into complex arrays. The dissociation constant and the native cellular concentrations of this protein complex support a model whereby this soluble complex can directly bind and bundle actin filaments in vivo. Finally, using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, we demonstrate that dynacortin associates with dynamic cortical structures. All of our data indicate that cells have evolved different actin cross-linkers that localize in distinct regions of the cell but that collaborate to promote complex cell shape changes. D. discoideum cells were grown in standard DdHL-5 media (14Manstein D.J. Schuster H.-P. Morandini P. Hunt D.M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 162: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). For large scale preparations, 24 liters of cells were grown 2 liters at a time in 6-liter flasks while shaking at 200 rpm. Cells were grown to late log phase (as they just approached ∼1 × 107 cells/ml) before harvesting. For E. coli, BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL cells (Stratagene) were grown in standard LB with ampicillin and chloramphenicol for plasmid selection. Protein expression was induced when the cells reached an optical density at 600 nm of 0.6. Then, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to 1 mm and cells were allowed to grow an additional 4 h before harvesting. For the E. coli expression plasmid, His-dynacortin pET14b, the dynacortin cDNA was moved from a precursor plasmid of pLD1A15SN:GFP1-dynacortin (3Robinson D.N. Spudich J.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 823-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) into pET28b using SalI and NotI flanking restriction sites. The His tag, protease site, and T7 epitope tag along with the dynacortin cDNA were moved from pET28b using flankingNcoI and NotI sites into pET14b. This allows ampicillin to be used for plasmid selection rather than kanamycin, which is required for pET28b. The GFP-dynacortin and coronin-GFP constructs were described previously (3Robinson D.N. Spudich J.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 823-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and the GFP-RacE was generated in the same pLD1A15SN vector using a GFP tagging cassette as described for the dynacortin and coronin GFP fusion vectors (3Robinson D.N. Spudich J.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 823-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). For a purification experiment, typically 500 g of log-phaseD. discoideum cells were used as starting material. Cells were harvested by centrifugation. The cell pellet was washed one time in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4. Pellets were resuspended in cell lysis buffer (20 mm NaCl, 20 mmNa2VO4, 150 mm Hepes pH 7.1, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA), and a mixture of protease inhibitors including the following: 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 150 μm1-chloro-3-tosamido-7-amino-2-heptanone, 80 μg/mll-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone, 1 μg/ml benzamidine, 100 μg/mlNα-p-tosyl-l-arginine-methyl ester, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin. Cells were lysed by freeze/thaw using liquid nitrogen. After lysis, extracts were centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were decanted and polyethyleneimine was added to a final concentration of 0.23%. Lysates were stirred gently for 5 min at 22 °C. This cationic polymer allows the precipitation of negatively charged molecules such as nucleic acids and monomeric actin. Lysates were centrifuged again at 17,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, which resulted in complete clearing of the supernatant. The supernatant was collected and solid ammonium sulfate was added gradually to 45% saturation. After stirring gently for 15 min, the sample was centrifuged for 15 min at 17,000 × g at 4 °C. The 0–45% ammonium sulfate fraction was recovered for subsequent chromatographic steps. Nearly 100% of the dynacortin was recovered during these initial precipitation steps as judged by Western analysis of supernatant and pellet fractions (Fig. 1 A). The first significant loss occurred during the dialysis of the large ammonium sulfate pellet. However, the apparent yield was higher, approaching 300%, after the polyethyleneimine precipitation probably as a result of epitope exposure as nucleic acids and lipids were removed from the preparation. All chromatography steps were performed using either a Amersham Biosciences, Inc. FPLC system or a Waters MPLC system. All resins and prepacked columns were purchased from Amersham Biosciences, Inc. unless otherwise indicated. The D. discoideum ammonium sulfate pellet was resuspended in Buffer A (20 mm NaCl, 25 mm Hepes pH 7.1, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA with the mixture of protease inhibitors). The solution was dialyzed overnight against the same buffer. After dialysis the solution of protein was collected, centrifuged at 48,000 × gfor 20 min to remove insoluble materials, and the protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay. The protein concentration was adjusted to less than 10 mg/ml for ion exchange. Typically, about 4 g of protein were recovered after the ammonium sulfate separation from 500 g of cells, which meant the volume was adjusted to about 400 ml. No more than 2 g of protein were applied to a 200-ml SP-Sepharose Fast Flow column at a time to prevent saturation of the resin. The Buffer A used was adjusted to pH 7.1. During initial development of the purification procedure, pH 6.5 and 8 were also tested. Only pH 7.1 allowed nearly 100% of the dynacortin to bind to the SP-Sepharose resin. After application, the protein was eluted in a linear gradient from 0% Buffer B to 65% Buffer B over 20 column volumes. Buffer B was the following: 1 m NaCl, 25 mm Hepes pH 7.1, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm EGTA. Because it took two runs to separate the entire sample, the dynacortin peaks, which centered around 7–8 mS/cm conductivity were recovered and combined, concentrated by 60% ammonium sulfate precipitation, and resuspended in 12 ml of Buffer A. This material was applied to a Sephacryl S300 26/60 size exclusion column equilibrated in gel filtration buffer (50 mm NaCl, 25 mm Hepes pH 7.1, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA). The protein eluted from this column at approximatelyK av = 0.25. The first half of the peak was collected; the second half was discarded because of a large fraction of contaminants. The protein was diluted 2-fold and applied to a Mono Q HR 10/10 column equilibrated in Buffer A. The flow-through was collected, concentrated on a Mono S HR 5/5 column using a step gradient and separated on a Mono P HR 5/5 column equilibrated at pH 7 using the chromatofocusing buffer system 96 and 74. The protein was eluted with a pH 7–6 gradient using the manufacturer's suggested buffer combination for this pH range (Amersham Biosciences Inc.). Two peaks of protein were eluted, a minor peak with an apparent pI of ∼7.2 and a second major peak with an apparent pI of 6.8. The second peak (apparent pI = 6.8) was applied to a Sephadex S200 10/30 size exclusion column. The protein eluted with a K av = 0.18 on this column, comparable to the native unpurified and partially purified dynacortin complex. Since His-dynacortin was not well overexpressed in E. coli, presumably because of codon usage bias, a more elaborate purification protocol was required than may be typical for recombinantly expressed proteins. Cells were recovered by centrifugation and pellets were resuspended in the same buffer asD. discoideum cells except with only 10 mm Hepes pH 7.1 and without the 20 mmNa2VO4. E. coli cells were lysed with three passes through a French press at 1200 psi. Lysates were prepared exactly as the D. discoideum extracts with the polyethyleneimine precipitation and ammonium sulfate precipitation at 45% saturation. As with the native D. discoideum protein, only minimal dynacortin loss during these initial steps was detected by Western analysis. The ammonium sulfate pellets derived from E. coli lysates were resuspended in 12 ml of 10 mm Hepes pH 7.1 and were applied to the S300 26/60 size exclusion column equilibrated in 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm Hepes pH 7.1. The protein eluted at the same place as native dynacortin with an approximate K av = 0.25. The appropriate fractions were pooled and applied to an 8-ml Ni2+/NTA (Qiagen) superflow resin column pre-equilibrated with “no salt” Buffer A (10 mm Hepes pH 7.1 only). After binding, the column was washed in no salt Buffer A and the protein was eluted with a gradient from 0% no salt Buffer B to 100% no salt Buffer B (10 mm Hepes, 500 mm imidazole, pH 8.0) in 8 column volumes. The peak of His-dynacortin was pooled and applied to a Mono S HR 5/5 column equilibrated in no salt Buffer A. The protein was eluted with a 22-column volume segmented salt gradient from 0% Buffer B to 100% Buffer B (1 m NaCl, 25 mm Hepes pH 7.1, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm EGTA). Recovered protein was pooled, diluted in no salt Buffer A and reapplied to the Mono S but was eluted with a 50% Buffer B step elution. This concentrated the protein for dialysis. For actin binding studies, the dynacortin was dialyzed overnight in 2 mm NaCl, 10 mm Hepes pH 7.1, 1 mm NaN3. For analytical ultracentrifugation, it was dialyzed into the same buffer except with 400 mm NaCl. Typically, around 0.3 mg of purified dynacortin were recovered per liter of cells and 10 liters of cells were used per purification. To determine the stoichiometry of the His-tagged dynacortin, the protein was subjected to equilibrium sedimentation analysis using a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Instruments). The monomer molecular mass of the purified protein was calculated to be 42,286 Da from the primary sequence. This was verified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectroscopy using a Perseptive Voyager-DE RP Biospectrometry instrument (Stanford PAN Facility) where the monomer mass was determined to be 42,332 Da. The partial specific volume was calculated to be 0.715 ml/g. The solvent density was calculated for different salt concentrations by summing the incremental density contributions of the constituents. All calculations including temperature corrections were made by Laue's methods (15Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S. Rowe A. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, United Kingdom1992Google Scholar). The solvents contained 128, 264, or 400 mm NaCl. The buffer contained 10 mm Hepes pH 7.1. Initial protein concentrations ranged from 7.5 to 30 μm protein. Protein concentration was monitored by absorption at 280 nm. Initial concentration readings were taken at 3,000 rpm. The samples were centrifuged at 9,000, 11,000, 12,000, and 15,000 rpm for at least 26 h, then scans were taken every 2–4 h until the sample reached equilibrium. Absorption curves were integrated after equilibrium and compared with the integrated absorption of the initial scan at 3,000 rpm. The fractional amount of protein in the cell after reaching equilibrium compared with the initial sample was 1.0 ± 0.02 (n = 12; mean ± S.E.), verifying that the measured molecular weight is accurately reflecting the population of protein and that there is no significant loss due to precipitation during the centrifugation. TheM W,app was determined by fitting multiple data files to a single ideal species. Data were also fit to a model of an associating system of a monomer-dimer equilibrium. All fits were performed using the Microcal Origin software (Beckman Instruments). Chicken skeletal G-actin was prepared from chicken breast using standard purification methods (16Pardee J.D. Spudich J.A. Methods Cell Biol. 1982; 24: 271-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The actin was allowed to polymerize at high concentrations for 15 min at 22 °C by the addition of ×10 polymerization buffer (500 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm ATP, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 100 mm imidazole, pH 7 (17Mullins R.D. Machesky L.M. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 325: 214-237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), to a final concentration of 1 × polymerization buffer). Both actin and His-dynacortin were centrifuged to remove any aggregates before the assays were performed. Actin and His-dynacortin were mixed to appropriate concentrations and His-dynacortin dialysis buffer was added to normalize the volume of His-dynacortin buffer. The reactions contained a final concentration of 1 × polymerization buffer. Samples were incubated for 1 h at 22 °C and sedimented at 100,000 × g (total actin binding) in a TL100 ultracentrifuge for 20 min or at 10,000 × g (actin bundling) in a microcentrifuge for 20 min. Supernatant and pellet fractions were collected, resuspended to a final concentration of 1 × Laemmli's sample buffer and equivalent amounts were loaded on 15% SDS-PAGE gels. Gels were stained in Coomassie Blue stain and destained in 10% acetic acid. Proteins were quantitated using an AlphaImager 2000 scanning densitometer (Alpha Innotech Corp.). The linear ranges for dynacortin and actin concentrations were determined so only appropriate amounts at each concentration were loaded on the gel for accurate quantitation. Various concentrations of His-dynacortin and 2 μm F-actin were mixed in 1 × polymerization buffer and incubated for ∼1 h. Carbon-coated copper grids were incubated with the protein mixture for 2 min. The grids were washed two times in filtered 1 × polymerization buffer or water and then grids were incubated in 2% uranyl acetate for times ranging from 2 to 4 min. Grids were allowed to air dry and were imaged using a Philips CM-12 electron microscope. To examine the formation of actin bundles by light microscopy, actin filaments were stabilized with tetramethyl rhodamine-labeled phalloidin (Molecular Probes). Dynacortin was mixed with labeled actin filaments and viewed. Alternatively, flow cells were prepared so that different proteins could be added sequentially. Typically, actin filaments (1 μm) were sheared by 10 passages through a 26-gauage needle and added to the flow cell. Then dynacortin (3–5 μm) was added to one edge of the cell while on the sample stage. This allowed a gradient of dynacortin to form. Actin filament arrays and rings were observed but were biased to different regions of the gradient. The buffer used in flow cell experiments was 25 mm KCl, 25 mmimidazole, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, 4 mmMgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol. To determine the cellular concentration of dynacortin, wholeD. discoideum cell lysates were prepared in cell lysis buffer from DH1 and Ax2 strains. Concentrations were determined using a Bio-Rad Protein Assay. Purified His-dynacortin was used as a standard and its concentration was determined using the calculated extinction coefficient, 19,060 m−1 cm−1. Dilution series of each protein sample were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. The dynacortin protein was detected using rabbit anti-dynacortin polyclonal sera (diluted 1 to 40,000) (3Robinson D.N. Spudich J.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 823-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and goat anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad) (diluted 1 to 10,000). Immune complexes were detected using enzyme-coupled chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences Inc.). Dynacortin bands were quantitated by densitometry and densities were plotted versus the amount of input protein. The resulting lines were fit to a linear equation to identify the linear range. The densities from the five points from Ax2 and DH1 cells that fell in the linear range of the purified recombinant standard line were used to calculate the amount of dynacortin in the sample. After multiplying this amount by 2.9 to correct for epitope exposure observed during the purification of native dynacortin from D. discoideum (Fig.1 A, from the 290% yield during the first few steps of the purification), the protein represents 0.07% of the total cellular protein. To determine the concentration of dynacortin in the cell, the average diameter of D. discoideum cells removed from plates was estimated to be 8 μm using a Coulter Counter (Beckman Coulter). This permitted the rough calculation of the cell's volume, assuming that the cell is a simple sphere. The total cellular protein concentration was measured to be 60 μg/106 cells, which is in reasonable agreement with the published concentration of 50 μg/106 cells (18Loomis W. Methods Cell Biol. 1987; 28: 31-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To monitor the dynamics of the GFP fusion proteins in vivo, cells were imaged in MES starvation buffer (25 mm KCl, 20 mm MES, pH 6.8, 2 mmMgSO4, and 0.2 mm CaCl2) using a through the objective total internal reflection microscope. Excitation light was provided by a 488-nm argon ion laser (Melles Griot) and a ×100 (NA 1.65) objective (Olympus) was used for imaging. Cells were imaged in homemade anodized aluminum imaging chambers through 1.78 refractive index coverglasses. Emission light was collected using a Princeton Instruments PentaMAX intensified CCD and images were collected and processed using Winview (Roper Scientific). One-s frames were collected every second for 200–400 frames. The movies were analyzed using NIH Image. Regions of interest were monitored by tabulating the modal intensity within a 100 pixel2 (0.367 μm2) region versus time. Time frames of interest were fit to a single exponential equation to determine the rates of intensity change using KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software). In our previous study, we determined that nativeD. discoideum dynacortin separated on a size exclusion column with a large apparent Stokes radius of about 5.7 nm (3Robinson D.N. Spudich J.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 823-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To determine whether this complex is homomeric or heteromeric, we have purified it from D. discoideum. We developed a purification scheme that comprised polyethyleneimine and ammonium sulfate precipitations followed by a series of ion exchange, size exclusion, and chromatofocusing columns (Fig.1 A, see “Materials and Methods”). During the early phases of developing a purification protocol, it was difficult to purify the protein to homogeneity. This was partly due to the fact that dynacortin always eluted in somewhat broad peaks typically spanning a 30 mm change of salt concentration, probably due to multiple phosphorylation states of the protein. The difficulty also derived from the fact that dynacortin and the actin-related protein complex 2/3 (Arp2/3; reviewed in Refs. 19Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32531-32534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar and20Welch M.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 423-427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) showed considerable overlap in their fractionation properties on cationic and anionic exchange resins and by size exclusion. Both complexes also showed considerable co-fractionation on a Mono P column by chromatofocusing using a pH range of 7 to 5. However, by adjusting the ionic strength of the fractions pooled from the size exclusion column to 25 mm salt (conductivity about 3 mS/cm), all of the Arp2/3 complex bound to a Mono Q HR 10/10 column and much of the dynacortin also bound. However, a small amount of dynacortin (less than 25%) did not bind to this resin under these conditions. This protein was concentrated on a Mono S column and further fractionated on a Mono P column by chromatofocusing using an elution gradient of pH 7 to 6 (Fig. 1 B). This protocol provided nearly complete purification as judged by SDS-PAGE gels (a 4300-fold enrichment; see below) although the yields were too small to accurately quantitate the amount of recovery at this point. Sufficient quantities of protein were recovered, however, for size exclusion characterization with detection by Western immunoblot analysis, and the purified protein had an identical size to the unpurified (not shown) and partially purified native D. discoideum dynacortin (Fig. 1 C). With the assurance that the native complex is homomeric (not heteromeric) and because the yields were so small, we purified recombinantly expressed His-tagged dynacortin from E. coli (Fig.1 D). This recombinant protein had an identical elution profile from the same size exclusion column as the native D. discoideum complex (Fig. 1, C and E). We used the recombinant His-dynacortin for further biochemical studies. Because the protein has such a large Stokes radius even though the monomer molecular weight (M r) is only 37,800 for the native dynacortin protein and 42,300 for the His-tagged recombinant protein, we performed sedimentation equilibrium analysis of the recombinant protein to determine the stoichiometry of the complex. The apparent molecular weight (M W,app) was 67,000 when the protein species was modeled as a single ideal species. This M W,appwas independent of ionic strength, solvent density, and relative centrifugal force. The ratio of M W,app toM r is 1.59 (67.0/42.3). A few possibilities exist: the protein could be an associating system of a monomer-dimer, the protein could be nonideal, or both. Nonideality can occur if the protein is particularly asymmetric in shape or can result from charge effects. A decrease in M W,app with increasing protein concentration is a strong indicator of nonideality and this trend was observed for dynacortin (not shown). We also used multiple data sets from a variety of speeds and modeled the system as an associating monomer-dimer. The best fits were obtained if the seco"

We used two-hybrid screening to identify new proteins that interacted with the cytoplasmic domain of Mpl, and we found a new family of proteins designated A2D (for Ataxin-2 Domain protein). The A2D are 130-kDa proteins that have three regions similar to those of Ataxin-2, the gene product causing familial type 2 spinocerebellar ataxia. A2D has several isoforms with different C-terminal domains, all produced from a single gene by alternative splicing. Northern blotting indicated that the A2Dgene is widely expressed in immortalized cell lines and hematopoietic and fetal tissues. A2D proteins were constitutively associated with Mplin vivo in human hematopoietic UT7 cells. TPO also caused the release of A2D from the activated receptor, and the phosphorylation of A2D on tyrosines residues was dependent on the Mpl C-terminal domain. Finally, A2D bound to the unstimulated erythropoietin receptor, whereas erythropoietin caused dissociation from the erythropoietin receptor, suggesting that A2D proteins are new components of the cytokine signaling system."

Although the mitogenic properties of HB-EGF have been well characterized, its effects on glucose (Glc) metabolism have not. We therefore examined the possibility that HB-EGF might regulate HK activity and expression in glomerular mesangial cells, which constitute the principal renal cell type affected by a variety of pathologic conditions. Protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent classic mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway activation has been associated with increased HK activity in this cell type, so we also examined dependence upon these signaling intermediates. HB-EGF (≥10 nm) increased total HK activity over 50% within 12–24 h, an effect mimicked by other EGF receptor agonists, but not by IGF-1 or elevated Glc. EGF receptor and classic MAPK pathway antagonists prevented this increase, as did general inhibitors of gene transcription and protein synthesis. Both HB-EGF and phorbol esters activated the classic MAPK pathway, albeit via PKC-independent and PKC-dependent mechanisms, respectively. Both stimuli were associated with increased HK activity, selectively increased HKII isoform expression, and increased Glc metabolism via both the glycolytic-tricarboxylic acid cycle route and the pentose phosphate pathway. HB-EGF thus constitutes a novel regulator of mesangial cell HK activity and Glc metabolism. HKII is the principal regulated isoform in these cells, as it is in insulin-sensitive peripheral tissues, such as muscle. However, the uniform requirement for classic MAPK pathway activation distinguishes HKII regulation in mesangial cells from that observed in muscle.

By catalyzing the first committed step of Glc metabolism, the phosphorylation of Glc to yield Glc-6-phosphate (Glc-6-P), HKs both maintain the concentration gradient permitting facilitated Glc uptake and initiate all major pathways of Glc metabolism. Three high affinity HK isoforms (HKI-III) are expressed in mammalian kidneys, but the specific intrarenal expression patterns, regulation, and relative importance of individual isoforms have not been fully addressed. Interestingly, the extant descriptions of altered HK activity in the adult kidney have been largely restricted to pathological conditions associated with renal functional and/or structural abnormalities (1.Dubach U.C. Recant L. J. Clin. Invest. 1960; 39: 1364-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 2.Anderson J.W. Stowring L. Am. J.

Thus, as the principal renal cell type affected by a variety of pathologic conditions, including diabetic glomerulopathy and many forms of glomerulonephritis, the regulation of HK expression and activity in glomerular mesangial cells may have significant pathophysiologic, as well as physiologic, relevance. We have previously demonstrated novel regulation of HK activity,vis-à-vis total cellular Glc phosphorylating capacity, in cultured mesangial cells exposed to phorbol esters or thrombin (5.Robey R.B.

Induction of mesangial cell HK activity by these agents requires signal transduction via the classic mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, which is activated by a wide variety of stimuli in this cell type, including growth factors and cytokines (7.Tian W.

However, the specific physiologic and pathophysiologic consequences of HB-EGF stimulation are largely undefined, and no effects on Glc metabolism have been described in any cell type that we are aware of. We therefore examined the influence of HB-EGF on HK activity and Glc metabolism in cultured murine mesangial cells. In addition, we sought to integrate our findings with previous demonstrations of regulated mesangial cell HK activity and to identify both HK isoforms and signaling intermediates that contribute to HK induction in this cell type. The EGFR-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor PD153035 was obtained from Tocris Cookson (Ballwin, MO). Both the MEK (MAPK/ERK kinase)-selective inhibitor PD98059 and the protein kinase C (PKC)-selective inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I (GF 109203X; 2-[1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-1H-indol-3-yl]-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)-maleimide) were obtained from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). 5,6-Dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) was obtained from Fluka (Milwaukee, WI), and yeast Glc-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Indianapolis, IN). All cell culture reagents, including serum and other additives, were supplied by Invitrogen. Nitrocellulose was obtained from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA) or Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. [1-14C]Glc and [6-14C]Glc were also from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The high capacity CO2 scavenger Carbo-Sorb® E (4.8 mm CO2/ml) and a compatible liquid scintillation mixture (Permafluor E+) were purchased from Packard (Meriden, CT). All other reagents, including recombinant human HB-EGF, purified murine salivary gland EGF, recombinant human insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), recombinant human transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α), recombinant human amphiregulin (AR), recombinant human betacellulin (BTC), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), actinomycin D, cycloheximide (CHX), genistein (4′,5,7-trihydroxyisoflavone), nitro blue tetrazolium, NADP, and ATP, were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise noted. Mycoplasma-free SV40 MES 13 (murine mesangial) cells, which exhibit biochemical and morphologic features of normal mesangial cells in culture (5.Robey R.B. Ma J. Santos A.V.P. Am. J.

Kidney Int. 1988; 33: 677-684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) at passage 27. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 medium (3:1) containing 6 mm Glc and supplemented with both 14 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 5% fetal bovine serum. Cell monolayers were routinely grown to confluence in a humidified 37 °C/5% CO2 incubator before testing, and all experiments were performed between passages 30 and 40 to minimize the effects of phenotypic variation in continuous culture. Where appropriate, cells were serum-deprived for 16–24 h prior to and during testing. When inhibitors were employed, cells were typically pretreated with inhibitor alone for at least 30–60 min. before testing. Identification of mesangial cell HK isoforms was performed in parallel using both SV40 MES 13 cells and cells cultured from glomerular explants of adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (provided by Dr. Ashok K. Singh, Hektoen Institute, Chicago, IL). The preparation and maintenance of the latter cells has been detailed previously (20.Leehey D.J. Song R.H. Alavi N. Singh A.K. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 929-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In selected experiments, we also examined GLUT1-overexpressing MCGT1 (rat mesangial) cells and their β-galactosidase-expressing MCLacZ counterparts (the gift of Dr. Charles Heilig, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD). These cells have been characterized previously and were maintained as described (21.Heilig C.W. Concepcion L.A. Riser B.L. Freytag S.O. Zhu M. Cortes P. Hassett C.C. Gilbert J.D. Sastry K.S.S. Heilig K.O. Grondin J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1802-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). HK activity was measured as the total Glc-phosphorylating capacity of whole cell extracts using a standard G6PDH-coupled spectrophotometric assay as described previously (5.Robey R.B. Ma J. Santos A.V.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F742-F749PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Robey R.B. Raval B.J. Ma J. Santos A.V.P. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 2308-2318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Protein content was assayed by the method of Bradford (22.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar) using purified bovine γ-globulin as a reference standard. Specific HK activity was routinely expressed as units/g protein, where 1 unit corresponds to that level of enzyme activity resulting in the phosphorylation of 1 μmol of Glc/min at 25 °C. To facilitate comparisons, results were also expressed as percent activity relative to unstimulated time-paired control cells. A modification of this procedure was also employed to visualize HK activity attributable to individual HK isoforms following nondenaturing cellulose acetate electrophoresis (23.Braithwaite S.S.

In situ detection of resolved HK activities was performed as described by Wilson (25.Wilson J.E. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1544-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Lysates from cells overexpressing a heterologous HKI transgene were routinely analyzed in parallel as a reference standard. HKI overexpression in these cells was accomplished by adenoviral gene transfer as detailed below. The recombinant adenoviral expression vector used to overexpress the HKI isoform (rAd·HKI) has been characterized previously (26.Becker T.C. Noel R.J. Coats W.S. Gómez-Foix A.M. Alam T. Gerard R.D.

In preliminary experiments, a β-galactosidase-expressing control vector (rAd·LacZ) obtained from the same source exhibited uniform transfection efficiency in this cell type. rAd·HKI viral stocks were routinely titrated to increase total HK activity in transfected cell monolayers approximately 2- to 3-fold within 24 h. Specific rabbit polyclonal antisera directed against the 16 carboxyl-terminal residues of rat HKI (αHK1-C16) and the 18 carboxyl-terminal residues of rat HKII (αHK2-C18) have been characterized previously (28.Mandarino L.J. Printz R.L. Cusi K.A. Kinchington P. O'Doherty R.M. Osawa H. Sewell C. Consoli A. Granner D.K. DeFronzo R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: E701-E708PubMed Google Scholar) and were the generous gift of Dr. Daryl K. Granner (Vanderbilt University). Additional rabbit polyclonal antibodies were generated against synthetic oligopeptides corresponding to the 11 carboxyl-terminal residues of the human HKI sequence (αHK1-C11) and the nine carboxyl-terminal residues of both the human/rat HKII (αHK2-C9) and human HKIII (αHK3-C9) sequences (Alpha Diagnostic, San Antonio, TX). The murine monoclonal antibody C7C3 directed against rat HKIII (29.Preller A. Wilson J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 294: 482-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) was obtained as neat ascites from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). Commercially available goat polyclonal antisera directed against the 20 amino-terminal (αGLUT1-N20) and 20 carboxyl-terminal (αGLUT1-C20) residues of human GLUT1 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) as were goat polyclonal antisera against both the 19 amino-terminal residues of human HKI (αHK1-N19) and the conserved carboxyl-terminal residues of mouse/human EGFR (αEGFR/sc-03). The murine monoclonal antiphosphotyrosine antibody PY20 and its recombinant RC20 counterpart were both obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). All extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-specific antibodies, including phosphospecific anti-ERK1/2 were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Matched fluorescent AlexaFluor™ 488 and AlexaFluor™ 568 secondary antibody conjugates for use in confocal laser scanning microscopy were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Whole cell lysates were prepared in cold 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, before electrophoretic resolution via SDS-PAGE and transfer to nitrocellulose for immunoblotting. Blots were routinely stained with 0.1% (w/v) Ponceau S in 5% acetic acid to confirm both uniformity of gel loading and transfer between samples. Immunoblot analysis was performed as described previously (5.Robey R.B. Ma J. Santos A.V.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F742-F749PubMed Google Scholar). The rabbit polyclonal antisera αHK2-C18 was used to probe for HKII, and major findings were confirmed using either the goat polyclonal antisera αHK2-C14 or the rabbit polyclonal antisera αHK2-C9. HeLa cell lysates and/or recombinant human HKII (generously provided by Richard L. Printz and Daryl K. Granner, Vanderbilt University) were used as positive controls in all HKII immunoblot analysis. HKIII detection was accomplished using the monoclonal antibody C7C3 (29.Preller A. Wilson J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 294: 482-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and major results were confirmed using rabbit polyclonal antisera directed against human HKIII (αHK3-C9). HKI immunoblotting was performed with goat (αHK1-N19) or rabbit (αHK1-C10 and αHK1-C11) polyclonal antisera. Brain lysates of murine, rat, or bovine origin were routinely employed as positive controls in HKI immunoblot analysis. With the exception of αHK2-C18, which could often be used at dilutions as low as 1:20,000, immunoblotting with all antibody preparations was routinely performed using a 1:1000 dilution of neat serum (or neat ascites, in the case of C7C3). Specificity was evaluated by parallel analysis substituting preimmune sera for, or omitting immune sera from, individual preparations. Specific protein bands were visualized and quantitated using a commercially available chemiluminescent detection system (Phototope®, New England BioLabs) and NIH Image 1.62 software for Macintosh computers (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) as described previously (5.Robey R.B. Ma J. Santos A.V.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F742-F749PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Robey R.B. Raval B.J. Ma J. Santos A.V.P. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 2308-2318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemical analysis was performed on fixed SV40 MES 13 cells cultured on Lab Tek II™ multichamber glass slides (Nunc, Naperville, IL). Where appropriate, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before fixation in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for 5–10 min. at 25 °C. Fixed cells were then thoroughly washed with PBS before incubation in blocking and permeabilization buffer (PBS supplemented with 5% (v/v) goat serum, 0.3% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin for 2 h at 25 °C. Following the addition of primary antibodies (typically at a 1:100–1:2000 dilution), cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C and washed with PBS containing 0.3% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin before incubation with matched secondary antibodies in the same buffer (10 μg/ml for 1 h at 25 °C). Samples were then thoroughly washed with PBS before mounting in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) or Cytoseal XYL (Stephens Scientific, Riverdale, NJ). Fluorescent immunocytochemical localization was achieved using a Ziess LSM 410 confocal laser scanning microscopy system (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) equipped with an Ar-Kr laser and Zeiss LSM4 software for Microsoft Windows NT. Postacquisition digital image processing was routinely performed using PhotoShop 5.5 software for Macintosh computers (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA). Image acquisition parameters and postacquisition image processing were uniformly identical for a given set of paired samples. Preimmune sera or irrelevant antibodies were routinely employed as negative controls, and major results were confirmed using at least two independent antibody preparations. Immobilized αEGFR/sc-03 or PY20 antibodies were employed to immunoprecipitate total EGFR and tyrosine-phosphorylated EGFR, respectively, from whole cell lysates. Immunoprecipitates were then probed in parallel with both αEGFR/sc-03 and PY20 or RC20, and quantitative immunoblot analysis was employed to estimate specific EGFR phosphorylation by a modification of the method of Riese et al. (30.Riese D.J.I. Kim E.D. Elenius K. Buckley S. Klagsbrun M. Plowman G.D. Stern D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20047-20052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Major results were also confirmed by standard EGFR and phospho-EGFR immunoblots using the same antibodies. Specific ERK1/2 phosphorylation was evaluated by parallel assessment of ERK2 and phospho-ERK1/2 content of whole cell lysates via quantitative immunoblot analysis as described previously (5.Robey R.B. Ma J. Santos A.V.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F742-F749PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Robey R.B. Raval B.J. Ma J. Santos A.V.P. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 2308-2318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). ERK1/2 phosphotransferase activity was measured in whole cell lysates by a standard in vitro immunocomplex activity assay as described previously (5.Robey R.B. Ma J. Santos A.V.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F742-F749PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Robey R.B. Raval B.J. Ma J. Santos A.V.P. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 2308-2318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In brief, activated ERK1/2 immunoprecipitates were prepared from cell lysates 1–60 min following stimulation and were analyzed for the ability to specifically serine-phosphorylate a chimeric Elk-1 fusion protein in vitro. Glc utilization and lactate production were assayed as the net disappearance of Glc and the net accumulation of lactate in the culture medium, respectively, as described previously (5.Robey R.B. Ma J. Santos A.V.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F742-F749PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Robey R.B. Raval B.J. Ma J. Santos A.V.P. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 2308-2318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). All measures of medium Glc and lactate content were performed in the presence of non-limiting concentrations of Glc (initial concentration ∼6 mm) and under conditions of linear net Glc utilization and lactate accumulation. The oxidation of14C-radiolabeled Glc was monitored as described previously (31.Sochor M. Gonzalez A.M. McLean P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1984; 121: 8-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 32.Steer K.A. Sochor M. McLean P. Diabetes. 1985; 34: 485-490Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Tian W.-N. Braunstein L.D. Apse K. Pang J. Rose M. Tian X. Stanton R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1121-C1131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), albeit in the absence of artificial electron acceptors, using a simple modification of a classical CO2 capture assay (34.Tanaka K. Mandell R. Shih V.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1976; 58: 164-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). All manipulations were performed at 37 °C unless otherwise noted. In these experiments, individual cell monolayers (∼55 cm2) were washed with divalent cation-deficient PBS, pH 7.4, before detachment and disaggregation by limited trypsinization (0.05% (w/v) trypsin, 0.5 mm EDTA) for ∼3 min. in the same buffer. After pelleting at 250 ×g for 5 min., cells were resuspended in oxidation medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium base (Sigma) containing 5.5 mm Glc and modified by both the equimolar substitution of NaCl for NaHCO3 and supplementation with 14 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Cell numbers in these suspensions were estimated using an improved Neubauer hemocytometer (Hausser Scientific) and adjusted to ∼107 cells/ml. Aliquots (2 ml) were then transferred to 25-ml Erlenmeyer flasks equipped with center wells designed specifically for CO2 capture experiments (Kimble/Kontes, Vineland, NJ). All incubations were initiated by the direct addition of 1 μCi [1-14C]Glc or [6-14C]Glc (specific activity ∼56.0 mCi/mmol) to the medium. Flasks were then sealed and continuously agitated at 40 rpm on a temperature-controlled orbital shaker. Reactions were terminated at appropriate time points by the addition of 0.5 ml of 2 nH2SO4 to the medium via hypodermic needle. Liberated 14CO2 was trapped overnight in 0.2 ml of Carbo-Sorb® E that was introduced into the empty center well in identical fashion following termination of the reaction. After dissolution in Permafluor E+, trapped 14CO2content was assayed in individual samples using a Tri-Carb 1600TR Liquid Scintillation Analyzer (Packard). In preliminary experiments,14CO2 generation from14C-radiolabeled Glc was found to be linear for at least 3–4 h under these conditions, so all subsequent experiments were performed in this timeframe. Paired treated and untreated cells, analyzed in duplicate, were uniformly evaluated in parallel to facilitate direct comparisons, and cell-free control preparations were employed to correct for nonspecific background counts. Total cellular reduced GSH content was assessed spectrophotometrically using a commercially available assay kit (Calbiochem) per the manufacturer's recommendations. PKC phosphotransferase activity was assayed as described previously (5.Robey R.B. Ma J. Santos A.V.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F742-F749PubMed Google Scholar). All data were expressed as the means ± S.E. for at least three independent measures. Statistical comparisons were made by two-tailed paired t-testing or analysis of variance, where appropriate, using a significance level of 95% and StatView 5.0.1 software for Macintosh computers (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). As shown in Fig. 1, recombinant human HB-EGF increased total HK activity over 50% within 12 h (Fig. 1 B) and at concentrations as low as 10 nm, (Fig. 1 A). HK activity was still maximally elevated at 24 h, after which activity declined (data not shown). To examine whether other EGFR agonists were capable of mimicking the effect of HB-EGF on HK activity, we first tested the ability of purified murine EGF to increase total HK activity in cultured murine mesangial cells. As shown in Fig. 1 A, EGF fully mimicked the effect of recombinant human HB-EGF in this regard, albeit with a lower apparent EC50 (0.3 nm versus 1.3 nm). Other EGFR ligands expressed by or with actions in the kidney were similarly tested for this ability. In three consecutive experiments, 20 nm TGF-α, 20 nm AR, and 10 nm BTC increased total HK activity at 24 h by 78 ± 6% (p < 0.01), 85 ± 7% (p < 0.01), and 88 ± 9% (p < 0.02), respectively. Paired control cells treated with 200 nm PMA or 10 nm HB-EGF exhibited corresponding increases of 91 ± 7% (p < 0.01) and 71 ± 13% (p < 0.04), respectively. Both exogenous HB-EGF and IGF-1 increase [3H]thymidine uptake by cultured SV40 MES 13 cells. 2A. K. Sin"

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 195-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The biotinylation of these enzymes is a post-translational modification, which allows the transformation of inactive apo-proteins into their active holo forms. The covalent attachment of biotin is catalyzed by biotin protein ligase also called holocarboxylase synthetase (HCS).1d-Biotin is incorporated to a specific Lys residue of newly synthesized apo enzyme, via an amide linkage between the biotin carboxyl group and a unique ε-amino group of Lys residue (2Samols D.

It is biotinylated by HCS also called BirA. The BirA gene has been cloned and the protein purified and extensively studied (for a review, see Ref. 3Perham R.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 961-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). This is a model system for the biochemical study of biotinylation. However, if the ligases from other bacterial sources are very similar to the E. coli enzyme, their eukaryotic counterparts appear quite different. On the one hand, there is more than only one biotin-dependent carboxylase in eukaryotic cells, and hence, there are different substrates for the biotinylation reaction. This raises the issue of substrate specificity of this reaction. On the other hand, the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells is compartmentalized and the occurrence of biotin-dependent carboxylases in different subcellular compartments complicates the understanding of their biotinylation. In mammalian cells, HCS activity is located in both cytosol and mitochondria (4Chang H.I. Cohen N.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 225: 237-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In human cells, there are four carboxylases requiring biotin as a prosthetic group (acetyl-CoA carboxylase in the cytosol and pyruvate carboxylase, 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase, and propionyl-CoA carboxylase in mitochondria). Only one gene coding for HCS had been evidenced (5Suzuki Y. Aoki Y. Ishida Y. Chiba Y. Iwamatsu A. Kishino Y. Niikawa N. Matsubara Y. Narisawa K. Nat.

A. 1995; 92: 4626-4630Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). As a consequence, in humans, mitochondrial and cytosolic HCS activities should result from alternative splicing of the corresponding mRNA. Furthermore, different HCS polypeptides had been detected in cytosol that could result from the alternative use of three translation initiation codons (7Hiratsuka M. Sakamato O. Li X. Suzuki Y. Aoki Y. Narisawa K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1385: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In yeast, only one hcs gene has been isolated and code for the cytosolic activity of HCS, enabling the biotinylation of both carboxylases detected in yeast cytosol (acetyl-CoA carboxylase and pyruvate carboxylase) (8Cronan Jr., J.E. Wallace J.C. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 130: 221-230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In the plant kingdom, HCS activity has been detected in three subcellular compartments (cytosol, mitochondrion, and plastid) from pea leaves (9Tissot G. Douce R. Alban C. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This is therefore the most complex situation described. These locations are in agreement with the presence of carboxylases in each of the subcellular compartments (acetyl-CoA carboxylase and geranyl-CoA carboxylase in plastid, acetyl-CoA carboxylase in cytosol, and methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase in mitochondria) (for a review, see Ref. 10Alban C. Job D. Douce R. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 51: 17-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). A cDNA encoding HCS has been isolated and characterized in Arabidopsis thaliana (9Tissot G. Douce R. Alban C. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The product of the gene has been biochemically studied and localized in plastids (11Tissot G. Pépin R. Job D. Douce R. Alban C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 586-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The cytosolic and mitochondrial HCS activities remain unexplained. In the present study, we intended to clone a cDNA resulting from the expression of a new hcs gene (hcs2) using RT-PCR. We observed an unexpected diversity of messenger variants resulting from the transcription of this gene. They come from hcs2 mRNA alternative splicing. We investigated the genomic organization of hcs2. We evidenced different allelic isoforms of the hcs2 gene and studied the effects of this polymorphism on hcs1 and hcs2expression and HCS activities.DISCUSSIONWhen making an inventory of the parties involved in biotinylation, we observed a peculiarly complex situation in plants. HCS activity had been detected in three subcellular compartments (9Tissot G. Douce R. Alban C. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and the systematic sequencing ofArabidopsis genome revealed the occurrence of twohcs genes (hcs1 and hcs2) (18The Arabidopsis Genome Initiative Nature. 2000; 408: 796-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (7054) Google Scholar).Hcs1 was previously characterized and found to encode plastidial isoform (9Tissot G. Douce R. Alban C. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 11Tissot G. Pépin R. Job D. Douce R. Alban C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 586-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Here, we focused our attention on thehcs2 gene and its products. The salient facts of our investigation are (i) hcs2 gene is expressed and subjected to alternative splicing; (ii) hcs2 gene is characterized by high level of nucleotide polymorphism inside Ws ecotype; (iii) the level of polymorphism at hcs2 locus contrasts sharply with that observed at hcs1 locus; (iv) the observed polymorphism affects splicing of hcs2 mRNA but does not have any effect on HCS activity level in whole plant extracts nor on plant phenotype; (v) total hcs2 mRNA level is 4-fold lesser than hcs1 mRNA; and (vi) the most abundanthcs2 mRNA spliced variant should encode a truncated protein.Are HCS2 Putative Proteins New Forms of Eukaryotic HCS?We evidenced different isoforms of hcs2 mRNA which could encode putative proteins variable in amino- and carboxyl-terminal. We were not able to test the occurrence of these proteins in a cellular extract of Arabidopsis although we had at our disposal the HCS1 antibody. This antibody cross-reacted with HCS2 recombinant proteins (data not shown) but the HCS proteins concentration in plant extracts was too low to be accurately detected. These putative proteins can be classified according to their domains organization (20Mukhopadhyay B. Purwantini E. Kreder C.L. Wolfe R.S. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3804-3810Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) (Fig.8 A). Whatever hcs2allele, the most represented putative HCS2 protein (according to its corresponding mRNA relative abundance (hcs2b forhcs2ag and hcs2e for hcs2gg)) should be NH2-terminal truncated. It is an original eukaryotic HCS organization and this NH2-terminal structure is related to some bacterial ligases which do not present the helix-turn-helix domain of BirA (involved in DNA fixation and biotin operon regulation) and present no more than the catalytic core domain in NH2-terminal. We evidenced two different putative COOH-terminal HCS2 protein sequences. One presents the PGDNSF eukaryotic specific domain (observed in HCS2a, HCS2b and HCS2c) while the other is devoid of this conserved sequence. This partition is allele-dependent, as far as hcs2gg allele plants could not produce the COOH-terminal complete HCS2 protein. The function of this domain is not determined nor its exact involvement in HCS activity, but human HCS deleted of its last 31 amino acids (comprising the PDGNSF sequence) lost all activity (21Campeau E. Gravel R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12310-12316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, for theArabidopsis enzyme, which is closer to its bacterial counterpart, the HCS2 proteins depleted from this sequence (HCS2d, -e, and -f) could remain active.The significance of several splice variants of hcs2 is unknown. As this alternative splicing affects the 5′ of hcs2mRNA and should modify the NH2 terminus of HCS2 protein, it could produce proteins with different subcellular distributions (Fig. 8). Indeed, prediction programs such as Psort, chloroP, and mitoP give putative HCS2a, HCS2c, and HCS2d a cytosolic localization and HCS2f a mitochondrial localization. These supposed localizations are in good agreement with HCS activities found in plant cell cytosol and mitochondria (9Tissot G. Douce R. Alban C. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and matches well with sites of accumulation of some biotin-containing proteins in plant cells (10Alban C. Job D. Douce R. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 51: 17-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). According to the prediction programs, HCS2b and HCS2e should present a vesicular pathway localization (Fig. 8). It is interesting to notice that in Arabidopsis, two “cytosolic” ACCase isoforms have been described (22Yanai Y. Kawasaki T. Shimada H. Wurtele E.S. Nikolau B.J. Ichikawa N. Plant Cell Physiol. 1995; 36: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The corresponding gene sequences are very close, but one of them (accession number AAG40564) should present a NH2-terminal extension which is predicted to be membranous. Moreover, prediction programs (targetP, chloroP) give this protein a reticular localization. Thus, the HCS2 NH2-terminal truncated isoform could be its specific ligase.Alternatively, the active domain of the hcs2 gene could come down to the sequence between exon 3 and exon 9. So, exon 2 and exon 10, subjected to deleterious alternative splicing could be useless in HCS2 protein. This would give the HCS2 protein peculiar properties (substrate specificity and kinetic properties) different from HCS1. It could influence substrate specificity of each of them, in particular with respect to biotinylation sites different from the consensus one. Indeed, a cytosolic seed-specific biotinylated protein (SBP65) with no carboxylase activity had been evidenced in pea (23Duval M. DeRose R.T. Job C. Faucher D. Douce R. Job D. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 26: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This protein presents an atypical biotinylation site. A SBP65 homologue has been found in Arabidopsis seeds (24Job C. Laugel S. Duval M. Gallardo K. Job D. Seed Sci. Res. 2001; 11: 149-161Google Scholar). It is also possible that other original biotinylated proteins exist in Arabidopsisthat could explain the diversity of HCS isoforms in plant cells.Hcs2 Gene Presents a Nucleotide PolymorphismWhen comparing Col-0 and Ws-0-4 hcs2 sequence, 0.9% of nucleotides are different and 0.17% of the observed polymorphisms result in a change in amino acid composition. It is a significant level of intraspecific sequence polymorphism. By way of comparison, such level of polymorphism was found within the RPS2 gene (1.26%) (25Caicedo A.L. Schaal B.A. Kunkel B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 302-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) or at the RPP5 disease resistance locus (26Noel L. Moores T.L. van der Biezen E.A. Parniske M. Daniels M.J. Parker J.E. Jones J.D.G. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 2099-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). These are examples of sequence polymorphism affecting plant Resistance (R) genes which are currently subjected to such genetic variation (27Bergelson J. Kreiman M. Stahl E. Tian D. Science. 2001; 292: 2281-2285Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Bergelson et al.(28Bergelson J. Stahl E. Dudek S. Kreiman M. Genetics. 1998; 148: 1311-1323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) examined levels of polymorphism for three nuclear genes within and among the population of Arabidopsis. For these nuclear genes, the average nucleotide diversity was 0.04% within theArabidopsis population and 0.14% between populations. The polymorphism observed in the hcs2 gene could have deleterious effects on HCS protein integrity because of its effect onhcs2 mRNA splicing. Despite these severe consequences onhcs2 mRNA and HCS2 protein sequences, the ratio of eachhcs2 alleles was found to be around 50% in the Ws population we had at our disposal, and all the plants analyzed were homozygous for this trait. Moreover, there were no apparent consequences of this allelic diversity on HCS activity and plant phenotypes, which probably indicate relatively week functional constraint on the hcs2 gene. A possibility is that protein HCS2 function is redundant with that of HCS1. These two genes have very close sequence homology. Thus, one cannot exclude that hcs2could be an inactive pseudogene in Arabidopsis. It would be the relic of a former duplication event of the hcs gene consistent with the general duplication of Arabidopsisgenome (18The Arabidopsis Genome Initiative Nature. 2000; 408: 796-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (7054) Google Scholar) leaving, after evolution, only one resulting copy (hcs1) active. This possibility would be consistent with the observation that some of the spliced HCS2 isoforms are allele-dependent (HCS2a, -c, -d, -f; Fig. 8 B). We have isolated by RACE experiment, an hcs1 mRNA 5′ end different from the formerly studied. The observed deletion could influence the ATG choice. Indeed, two in-frame ATG can be used as initiation codons (9Tissot G. Douce R. Alban C. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) in the hcs1 mRNA (see also Fig.2 A). In the present case, the observed deletion covered a zone of repeated sequence that can create some secondary structure. The structure of the 5′-untranslated region can influence the initiation of translation (29Botto J.M. Vincent J.P. Mazella J. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The first ATG gives HCS1 a plastidial localization (11Tissot G. Pépin R. Job D. Douce R. Alban C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 586-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), the second could give HCS1 a cytosolic localization. As a result,hcs1 gene could be sufficient to explain cytosolic and plastidial HCS activities. This situation had been observed in human, where only one hcs gene and two subcellular localizations of HCS activity (mitochondrial and cytosolic) were evidenced (6Leon-Del-Rio A. Leclerc D. Akerman B. Wakamatsu N. Gravel R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4626-4630Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).Another possibility is that HCS2 is useful on occasion, but such occasions may not occur during the lifetime of the average plant. For example, Arabidopsis adh is a nonessential gene that is thought to be subjected to balancing selection for two haplotypes (30Hanfstingl U. Berry A. Kellogg E.A. Costa 3rd, J.T. Rudiger W. Ausubel F.M. Genetics. 1994; 138: 811-828Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, Henikoff and Comai (31Henikoff S. Comai L.A. Genetics. 1998; 149: 307-318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) observed an allelic diversity ofCMT1, some of the alleles presenting deleterious mutations. They put forward such an hypothesis to explain the maintenance of both alleles. In our case, hcs2 could encode an isoform implied, for example, in specific activation of cytosolic ACCase, committed in flavonoids or long chain fatty acid synthesis, restricted in the epidermal cells. As a result, HCS2 deficiency could have any effect apart from the occurrence of an environmental stress such as UV exposition or pathogen attack.Studies of the biochemical and kinetic properties of HCS2 recombinant proteins and of their subcellular localization in the plant cell, which are currently in progress in our laboratory, will entitle us to have insight into their physiological function. Moreover, reverse genetic studies and particularly characterization of knockout hcs1and hcs2 mutants, which have been initiated, will give us some elements to unravel the role of each of Arabidopsis hcsgene in the realization of protein biotinylation. Biotin (vitamin H) is a cofactor for some carboxylases and decarboxylases (1Knowles J.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 195-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The biotinylation of these enzymes is a post-translational modification, which allows the transformation of inactive apo-proteins into their active holo forms. The covalent attachment of biotin is catalyzed by biotin protein ligase also called holocarboxylase synthetase (HCS).1d-Biotin is incorporated to a specific Lys residue of newly synthesized apo enzyme, via an amide linkage between the biotin carboxyl group and a unique ε-amino group of Lys residue (2Samols D. Thornton C.G. Murtif V.L. Kumar G.K. Haase F.C. Wood H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6461-6464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It occurs in two steps, Equations 1 and 2 as follows, D­Biotin+ATP→D­biotinyl­5′­AMP+PPiEquation 1 D­Biotinyl­5′­AMP+apocarboxylaseEquation 2 →holocarboxylase+AMPIn Escherichia coli, there is only one biotin-dependent carboxylase, the acetyl-CoA carboxylase. It is biotinylated by HCS also called BirA. The BirA gene has been cloned and the protein purified and extensively studied (for a review, see Ref. 3Perham R.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 961-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). This is a model system for the biochemical study of biotinylation. However, if the ligases from other bacterial sources are very similar to the E. coli enzyme, their eukaryotic counterparts appear quite different. On the one hand, there is more than only one biotin-dependent carboxylase in eukaryotic cells, and hence, there are different substrates for the biotinylation reaction. This raises the issue of substrate specificity of this reaction. On the other hand, the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells is compartmentalized and the occurrence of biotin-dependent carboxylases in different subcellular compartments complicates the understanding of their biotinylation. In mammalian cells, HCS activity is located in both cytosol and mitochondria (4Chang H.I. Cohen N.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 225: 237-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In human cells, there are four carboxylases requiring biotin as a prosthetic group (acetyl-CoA carboxylase in the cytosol and pyruvate carboxylase, 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase, and propionyl-CoA carboxylase in mitochondria). Only one gene coding for HCS had been evidenced (5Suzuki Y. Aoki Y. Ishida Y. Chiba Y. Iwamatsu A. Kishino Y. Niikawa N. Matsubara Y. Narisawa K. Nat. Genet. 1994; 8: 122-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 6Leon-Del-Rio A. Leclerc D. Akerman B. Wakamatsu N. Gravel R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4626-4630Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). As a consequence, in humans, mitochondrial and cytosolic HCS activities should result from alternative splicing of the corresponding mRNA. Furthermore, different HCS polypeptides had been detected in cytosol that could result from the alternative use of three translation initiation codons (7Hiratsuka M. Sakamato O. Li X. Suzuki Y. Aoki Y. Narisawa K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1385: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In yeast, only one hcs gene has been isolated and code for the cytosolic activity of HCS, enabling the biotinylation of both carboxylases detected in yeast cytosol (acetyl-CoA carboxylase and pyruvate carboxylase) (8Cronan Jr., J.E. Wallace J.C. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 130: 221-230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the plant kingdom, HCS activity has been detected in three subcellular compartments (cytosol, mitochondrion, and plastid) from pea leaves (9Tissot G. Douce R. Alban C. Biochem.

By 1H-13C HSQC spectroscopy of C130 labeled by BA-2-13C-7-ACA, it was shown that tryptophan residue(s) in the enzyme was alkylated, forming a carbon-carbon bond. Replacing Trp-B4 with other amino acid residues caused increases in K m, decreases ink cat, and instability of enzyme activity. None of the mutant enzymes except W-B4Y could be affinity-alkylated, but all were competitively inhibited by BA-7-ACA. Kinetic studies revealed that both BA-7-ACA and BP-7-ACA could specifically alkylate Trp-B4 of C130 as well as Tyr-B4 of the mutant W-B4Y. Because these alkylations were energy-requiring under physiological conditions, it is likely that the affinity labeling reactions were catalyzed by the C130 enzyme itself. The Trp-B4 residue is located in the middle of a characteristic αββα sandwich structure.

Because these steps involve toxic compounds causing environmental contamination, enzymatic methods of CPC deacylation are of great interest. Since cephalosporin acylase (CA) has very low activity toward CPC, most of the bioprocess reported methods involve a two-step conversion of CPC to 7-ACA. First, CPC is oxidized by d-amino acid oxidase (1Isogao T. Ono H. Ishitani Y. Kojo H. Ued Y. Kohsaka M. J. Biochem.

The subunits are derived from one precursor polypeptide. The catalytic mechanism of CA was deduced from its sequence and that of the functionally analogous penicillin G acylase (4Li Y. Chen J. Jiang W. Xiang M. Zhao G. Wang E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 713-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The latter enzyme is a well known serine proteinase that carries out an N-terminal nucleophilic (Ntn) attack (5Brannigan J.A. Dodson G. Duggleby H.J. Moody P.C.E. Smith J.L. Tomchick D.R. Murzin A.G.

Nature. 1995; 373: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). The first crystal structure of a CA, from Pseudomonas diminuta (CAD), was solved at a resolution of 2.0 Å (7Kim Y. Yoon K-H. Khang Y. Turley S. Ho W.G.J. Structure. 2000; 8: 1059-1068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). A similar crystal structure of C130 at a resolution of 2.4 Å, was solved independently. 2Y. Ding, W. Jiang, X. Mao, H. He, S. Zhang, H. Tang, M. Bartlam, S. Ye, F. Jiang, Y. Liu, G. Zhao, and Z. Rao, unpublished data. The sequence identity between CAD and C130 is >98%. The crystal structures revealed some similarities between the active centers of the CAs and penicillin G acylase, although their overall structures are quite different, as expected from the low sequence similarities of the two enzymes. The structure of CAD (and C130) bears a characteristic αββα motif. The N-terminal residue Ser-B1 of the β-subunit is the catalytic center, indicating that CA belongs to the Ntn hydrolase superfamily, as defined by the Structural Classification of Proteins data base (8Murzin A.G. Brenner S.E. Hubbard T. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 536-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (5625) Google Scholar). Recently, structures of the binary complexes of CAD with GL-7-ACA and glutarate were solved at 2.5- and 2.6-Å resolutions, respectively (9Kim Y. Hol W.G.J. Chem. Biol. 2001; 8: 1253-1264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Although the site of initial substrate binding can be inferred from these studies, this information may not reflect the dynamic status of the enzyme-substrate complex during catalysis. In this study, a series of substrate analogs with side chains of variable length were synthesized. Two compounds, 7β-bromoacetyl aminocephalosporanic acid (BA-7-ACA) and 7β-3-bromopropionyl aminocephalosporanic acid (BP-7-ACA), could specifically function as affinity reagents. The reaction site was the indole ring of Trp-B4 as determined by LC/MS peptide mapping, tandem MS spectra analysis, and NMR. These results provide useful insight into the dynamic status of substrate binding and the catalytic mechanism of the C130 acylase. Bromoacetic-2-13C-acid, bromoacetyl chloride, bromopropionic acid, bromobutyric acid, and glutaric anhydride were purchased from Aldrich. 7-ACA was produced by Zhejiang Haimen Pharmacy Co. GL-7-ACA was synthesized by acylation of 7-ACA with glutaric anhydride (10Shibuya Y. Matrumoto K. Fujii T. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1981; 45: 1561-1567Google Scholar). 5-Bromopentanoic and 6-bromohexanoic acids were synthesized by brominating cyclopentanone and cyclohexanone (11Braunwarth J.B. Crosby G. J. Org.

The culture conditions for C130 expression was as described previously (3Li Y. Jiang W. Yang Y. Zhao G. Wang E. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 12: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), while modified slightly for mutated enzymes. Mutants of C130, W-B4A, W-B4L, W-B4T, W-B4F, W-B4H, and W-B4Y were constructed by replacing the Trp-B4 codon with appropriate codons for Ala, Leu, Thr, Phe, His, and Tyr respectively (this work). Mutant P-B8G was constructed by replacing the Pro-B8 codon with an appropriate codon for Gly (this work). Substrate analogs were synthesized by acylation of 7-ACA with the relevant acyl chloride. These structures were verified by MS and NMR.

The 13C NMR data (in 0.1 n 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0) were determined by 1H-13C COSY: δ 23.0, 28.1, 30.1 (C-Br), 59.8, 62.0, 66.8, 119.1, 134.0, 167.0, 171.0, 173.4, 176.7.

The crude enzymes were prepared as described (3Li Y. Jiang W. Yang Y. Zhao G. Wang E. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 12: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). They were further purified on a Sepharose Q F (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) column equilibrated with 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) and eluted with a gradient of NaCl ranging from 0 to 500 mm on fast protein liquid chromatography (Amersham Biosciences). The enzyme peak was collected and concentrated to >1 mg/ml with the Molecut II LGCTM (Millipore Corp.) spin column. Further purification was achieved via size exclusion chromatography. Purified C130 was more than 90% homogenous, as determined by densitometric scanning after Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-PAGE gels using an LKB Ultrascan XL densitometer. In those cases where only partial purification was achieved (i.e. some mutant enzymes), quantitation was performed by SDS-PAGE, followed by densitometric scanning, using various amounts of purified C130 protein as standard. Enzyme activity was determined as previously described (12Ichikawa S. Shibuya Y. Matsumoto K. Fujii T. Komatsu K. Kodaira R. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1981; 45: 2231-2236Google Scholar). One unit of activity is that amount of enzyme that produces 1 μmol of 7-ACA/min (3Li Y. Jiang W. Yang Y. Zhao G. Wang E. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 12: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The specific activity of the purified C130 was 6.2 μmol/min/mg. All experiments were performed on a Bruker REFLEX mass spectrometer. Enzyme samples (1 mg/ml) were prepared using α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as matrix in solution with 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water. 1 μl of sample solution was mixed with 1 μl of matrix solution, and 1 μl of the mixture was applied to the SCOUT 384 target. The W-B4L mutant was conducted by PCR using plasmid pKKCA1 as template and the primer, 5′-TCC AAC TCC TTG GCG GTG GCC CCG-3′. This oligonucleotide corresponds to the coding sequence from Ser-B1 to Pro-B8 with the Trp-B4 codon replaced by a Leu codon (underlined). This mutated gene retained the characteristicBamHI site at the Ser-B1 codon and created a SmaI site by altering the Ala-B7 codon. Mutants of P-B8G, W-B4A, W-B4T, W-B4F, W-B4H, and W-B4Y were obtained by replacing thisBamHI-SmaI fragment using oligodeoxyribonucleotides that replaced Pro-B8 with Gly and Trp-B4 with Ala, Thr, Phe, His, and Tyr, respectively. Correctness of the mutant clones was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The acylases (0.5 mg/ml) were incubated with excess BA-7-ACA (8 mm) in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) for 1 h at 37 °C. The course of the labeling reaction was followed by measuring residual enzymatic activity assay (lower than 1.0% of the original enzymatic activity, indicating the completion of labeling). After concentration, the reaction mixture was subjected to gel filtration (Superdex 75; Amersham Biosciences). The fractions containing modified enzyme were collected and concentrated to >1 mg/ml with Molecut II LGCTM (Millipore Corp.). Both the original enzyme (2 mg/ml) and the labeled enzymes (2 mg/ml) were denatured at 65 °C in 8 m urea for 45 min. The denatured enzymes were digested either with trypsin or Lys-endoproteinase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the protocol of the supplier. On-line HPLC separation was performed on a Hewlett-Packard model 1100 system at a flow rate of 0.05 ml/min. Solvent A was 0.01% trifluoroacetic acid, 1% HOAc in water, and solvent B was 0.01% trifluoroacetic acid, 1% HOAc in acetonitrile. A 2.1 × 30-mm C8 reverse phase column (Applied Biosystems) was used for oligopeptide separation after proteolytic digestion. The gradient was 0–100% solvent B over 60 min. The mass spectra were obtained on a Finnigan LCQ ion trap mass spectrometer (ThermoQuest, San Jose, CA) equipped with an electrospray ionization source. The MS spray voltage was 4.25 kV. The heated capillary was maintained at temperature of 200 °C. The spectrum was scanned from 400 to 2000m/z. The ZoomScan, tandem MS (MS/MS) was performed in the data-dependent mode. The MS/MS collision energy value was 42%. Heteronuclear correlation 1H-13C HSQC (13Kay L.E. Keifer P. Saarinen T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 10663-10665Crossref Scopus (2446) Google Scholar) spectrum was recorded on a Varian Inova 750-MHz spectrometer equipped with a z axis shielded triple resonance probe. The sample of C130 modified by BA-2-13C-7-ACA was dissolved in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) at a concentration of 40 mg/ml. BA-2-13C-7-ACA was synthesized as described previously. Based on the structure of GL-7-ACA, we designed and synthesized a series of substrate analogs by replacing the side chain of GL-7-ACA with different length of bromoacyl moieties (Fig. 1 B). Although these compounds are structurally similar to the native substrate, GL-7-ACA, only marginal hydrolytic activities remained after incubating with C130 (Table I). Only BA-7-ACA and BP-7-ACA could inhibit the activity after prolonged incubation with C130. In addition, the inactivation was irreversible, because reactivated C130 could not be recovered even if the inhibitors were removed (data not shown). The other analogs and bromoacetic acid itself did not affect the activity of C130. Because BA-7-ACA is a much more effective inhibitor than BP-7-ACA (see Tables I and III), we focused our attention on the inhibition of C130 caused by BA-7-ACA.Table IRelative activities of Pseudomonas sp. 130 acylase (C130) in the presence of various substrate analogsSubstrate analogueResidual activity (toward GL-7-ACA)Hydrolysis activity (toward substrate analogs)%%None100100Bromoacetyl-7-ACA3.5< 13-Bromopropionyl-7-ACA72< 14-Bromobutyryl-7-ACA97< 15-Bromopentanoyl-7-ACA98< 16-Bromohexanoyl-7-ACA97< 1Bromoacetic acid95Purified enzyme (0.25 mg/ml) was incubated with the indicated substrate analogs (5.0 mm) in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) at 37 °C for 1 h. 100 μl of the reaction mixture was withdrawn and passed through spin columns to remove the excess reagents.

All experiments were repeated three times independently, and the S.D. values were calculated withn = 3. Open table in a new tab Purified enzyme (0.25 mg/ml) was incubated with the indicated substrate analogs (5.0 mm) in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) at 37 °C for 1 h. 100 μl of the reaction mixture was withdrawn and passed through spin columns to remove the excess reagents. The residual activity was then determined under standard assay conditions (see “Experimental Procedures”). Enzymatic activities (hydrolysis activities) for various substrate analogs were measured by incubating the enzyme (0.10 mg/ml) with the analogs (10 mm) for 30 min. Data given are the mean of two independent sets of measurements. Parameters were determined from the inactivation kinetics study of C130 and W-B4Y by with respect to various concentrations of the inhibitor, BA-7-ACA or BP-7-ACA (Fig. 8). All experiments were repeated three times independently, and the S.D. values were calculated withn = 3. The inhibition of C130 by BA-7-ACA proceeded in a time-dependent manner under physiological conditions. The kinetics of inhibition was pseudo-first-order. Each individual product of the reaction, glutaric acid or 7-ACA, slowed down the rate of inactivation (Fig. 2). A semilogarithmic plot of inhibition rate k versus the concentration of BA-7-ACA yielded a straight line with a slope of 0.91. This implies that BA-7-ACA was functioning as an affinity labeling reagent, resulting in single hit modification of C130. In addition, far UV circular dichroism spectra of the original and modified C130 were almost identical (data not shown), indicating that this modification does not lead to a gross change in protein structure. To confirm the equimolecular character of the alkylation of C130, a comparison of the native and labeled C130 was made by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry to determine the stoichiometry of inhibitors binding. Unambiguously, the signals at m/z 17474.75 andm/z 17474.94 (Fig. 3,A and C) corresponding to the α-subunits (original and labeled) indicated that there was no labeling of the α-subunit of C130. On the other hand, signals corresponding to the β-subunits at m/z 58,315.54 (Fig. 3 B) orm/z 58,614.26 (Fig. 3 D) revealed an average mass increase of 299 on labeled C130. This result, within the instrumental error of MALDI-TOF, matches well enough to the expected molecular mass of 313 for -CH2CO-7-ACA (-R), indicating that there was only one -R covalently bound to the β-subunit of C130. Theoretically, complete digestion of C130 with trypsin should produce 65 peptides. A precise comparison of the LC/MS tryptic fingerprints of native C130 and the alkylated enzyme was made. More than 30 peptides in each of the two digests, covering about 80% of the total amino acid residues, were identified and confirmed by tandem mass spectroscopy (data not shown). Among the peptides identified, we found only one [M + 2]2+ signal atm/z 509 corresponding to SNSWAVAPGK (T1) from C130 that was not present in the peptide spectrum of the labeled C130. In the peptides from the alkylated species, a new [M + 2]2+signal at m/z 665 (T1-R) appeared. The T1 tryptic fragment originates from the N terminus of the C130 β-subunit. Within this segment, the first serine residue (Ser-B1) is known to be the Ntn catalytic center (4Li Y. Chen J. Jiang W. Xiang M. Zhao G. Wang E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 713-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 7Kim Y. Yoon K-H. Khang Y. Turley S. Ho W.G.J. Structure. 2000; 8: 1059-1068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The additional molecular mass of 312 corresponds to that of the inhibitor residue (-R). Thus, the alkylation of the C130 β-subunit by BA-7-ACA is likely to form a stable enzyme-CH2CO-7-ACA complex, and the labeling site is likely to lie within the T1 peptide. Further investigation of MS/MS spectra of both T1 and T1-R was carried out to elucidate the sequence of T1 and to identify the chemically modified amino acid residue within T1-R. As shown in Fig.4, most of the B ions and Y ions (14Mørtz E. O'Connor P.B. Roepstorff P. Kelleher N.L. Wood T.D. Mclafferty F.W. Mann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8264-8267Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) from the MS/MS spectrum of T1 were identified and matched well with the proposed sequence of SNSWAVAPGK. However, the presence of the labeled inhibitor residue -R made it more complicated to clarify the daughter ions in the MS/MS spectrum of T1-R (Fig.5). Under the conditions of the tandem MS ion scan mode, the -R residue may not be stable enough to maintain its structure unchanged. A certain percentage of the -R residues may be further cleaved to produce two possible different subresidues, -R1 and -R2, with molecular weight of 253 and 42, respectively (Fig. 6), as indicated by the presence of [Y9-OH]2+, [M-60]2+, and [M-271]2+. Therefore, the parental ion T1-R may first be cleaved to produce two subparental ions, T1-R1 and T1-R2, and then most of the daughter ions may come from the three parental ions. Although a complete series of Y ions was not observed, probably due to the multiple internal cleavages rather than sequential cleavages, subseries ions, signals at m/z 683,m/z 754, m/z 853, and m/z 924, strongly indicated that the labeling site was on the small peptide fragment NSW. This hypothesis was substantiated by the presence of the B4–60 ion (SNSW + R1). The signal at m/z 835 corresponding to WAVAPG plus R1 (782 + 253) allowed an assignment of Trp (Trp-B4) as the target residue within the T1-R peptide fragment.Figure 5MS/MS spectrum of the doubly charged T1-R ion at m/z 665. T1-R was separated from the tryptic digest of labeled C130 by LC/MS (see “Experimental Procedures”). Daughter ions B4–60 and WAVAPG + R1allowed an assignment that Trp-B4 was the labeling residue within the peptide of SNSWAVAPGK.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 6Scheme of possible cleavage paths for the inhibitor residue R (acyl-7-ACA).

It has been reported that the proline imide bond (15Loo J.A. Edmonds C.G. Smith R.D. Anal. Chem. 1993; 65: 425-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) might interfere with the normal collision-induced dissociation in MS. In addition, based on our observations, replacing Pro-B8 with glycine is likely to be a stable mutant maintaining most of the original enzymatic properties. 3X. Huang, R. Zeng, X. Ding, X. Mao, Y. Ding, Z. Rao, Y. Xie, W. Jiang, and G. Zhao, unpublished observation. Thus, labeled P-B8G was digested by Lys-endoproteinase, and the first peptide fragment of the β-subunit, from Ser-B1 to Lys-B10, containing the -R residue within it, was analyzed by LC/MS, giving a [M + 2]2+ signal at m/z 645. The signals at m/z 439 and m/z 510 in the MS/MS spectrum, corresponding to Trp-R1 and [Trp-Ala]-R1, respectively, directly identified the labeling site of BA-7-ACA. To confirm that a chemical reaction involving the bromoacetyl group of BA-7-ACA and Trp-B4 of C130 had taken place, a13C-labeled inhibitor, BA-2-13C-7-ACA, was synthesized and used in the affinity labeling of C130. The1H-13C COSY spectrum of BA-7-ACA (see “Experimental Procedures”) indicated that the 13C chemical shift of its C-2′ was assigned at δC 30.1 ppm in PBS, pH 8.0 (or δC 28.5 ppm in CD3OD), correlated to the two C-2′ protons (at δ 3.90 and 3.98 ppm, in PBS, pH 8.0). Only one signal of 1H-13C correlation resonance was clearly presented in the two-dimensional HSQC spectroscopy of the 13C-labeled enzyme-inhibitor complex (Fig. 7 A). Thus, only one kind of amino acid residue specifically alkylated. Meanwhile, this alkylation was confirmed by the obvious change of the 13C chemical shift of the 13C labeled carbon, which was assigned at δC 43.4 ppm. From the known increments of substituted alkanes (16Breitmaier E. Voelter W. Carbon-13 NMR Spectroscopy.3rd Ed. VCH Verlagsgesellschaft, Weinheim, Germany1987: 314-315Google Scholar), we can predict the 13C chemical shift of the 13C labeled carbon when an amino acid residue is alkylated by BA-2-13C-7-ACA. For tryptophan, it is believed that C-3 of the indole ring is initially attacked by the bromide and then a C-2 alkylated product would be formed after rearrangement (17Houlihan W.J. Indoles Part One. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1972: 90-91Google Scholar, 18Loudon G.M. Portsmouth D. Lukton A. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1969; 91: 2792-2794Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Therefore, C-2 of the indole ring is considered to be the only possible position to be alkylated (19Eckenhoff R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15521-15526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) (Fig. 7 B). Here, we predict the chemical shift by calculation with the following increments: δC = −2.3 (CH4) + 22 (-CONH2) + 23 (phenyl) = 42.7 (ppm), where the -CONH2 and phenyl groups are approximate substitutes for -CO-7-ACA and Trp residue, respectively. This predicted shift is close to the measured shift (δC 43.4 ppm) assigned in Fig. 7 A. With a similar chemical environment, the C-2′ of penicillin G (Fig.7 B) gives a measured shift at δC 42.8 ppm (20Dorman D.E. Srinivasan R.P. Lichter R.L. J. Org. Chem. 1978; 43: 2013-2016Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar), very close to the predicted one. Since there are no cysteine residues in C130, other possible alkylated functional groups on the residues are -OH, -COOH, and -NH2 (or =NH), giving predicted shifts at δC of 76.7, 71.7, and 56.2 (60.2) ppm, respectively. These shifts are significantly different from those observed, excluding the possible alkylation of Ser, Tyr, Thr, Asp, Glu, His, Lys, Arg, Asn, and Gln residues, as well as N-1 of the indole ring of Trp. Therefore, C-2 of the indole ring is the most likely position for alkylation with BA-7-ACA; this event would lead to the formation of a carbon-carbon bond between C130 and the inhibitor. This covalent bond was stable enough to generate useful information from MS/MS spectra for the determination of modification of Trp-B4 (Fig. 5). In order to further confirm the specific reaction of BA-7-ACA with Trp-B4 of the C130 β-subunit, six site-directed mutants were generated, replacing Trp-B4 with Ala (W-B4A), Leu (W-B4L), Thr (W-B4T), Phe (W-B4F), His (W-B4H), and Tyr (W-B4Y) respectively. Each of the mutant proteins retained significant activity toward its natural substrate, GL-7-ACA, with moderately decreased values ofk cat/K m (TableII), indicating that the Trp-B4 of the C130 β-subunit is essential for neither substrate binding nor catalytic activity, despite the fact that this residue can be specifically alkylated by BA-7-ACA.Table IIKinetic parameters of C130 β subunit mutants and half-life of their enzymatic activitiesEnzymeK mk catk cat/K mK i2-aCompetitive inhibition constant for BA-7-ACA.t 1/2mms−1m−1s−1mmminC1300.21 ± 0.037.8 ± 0.53.7 × 104—2-bThese enzymes can be affinity labeled by BA-7-ACA.600 ± 31W-B4A0.33 ± 0.033.6 ± 0.21.1 × 1046.4 ± 0.561 ± 8W-B4L0.37 ± 0.033.8 ± 0.31.2 × 1046.8 ± 0.698 ± 7W-B4T0.36 ± 0.033.3 ± 0.20.92 × 1045.4 ± 0.812 ± 3W-B4F0.37 ± 0.035.0 ± 0.21.4 × 1046.3 ± 0.516 ± 3W-B4H0.40 ± 0.035.5 ± 0.41.4 × 1045.4 ± 0.5307 ± 25W-B4Y0.33 ± 0.035.9 ± 0.31.8 × 104—2-bThese enzymes can be affinity labeled by BA-7-ACA.50 ± 7Wild type and mutant enzymes were partially purified (>50%).
