https://openalex.org/W1990956718,"Antisera produced against certain isolated human antibodies showed clear antigenic differences between these antibodies. Individual antigenic specificity was demonstrated for two anti-A antibodies, one anti-dextran, and one anti-levan antibody. Failure to produce specific antisera in other instances appeared to be correlated with a greater heterogeneity of the antibody population used as antigen."
https://openalex.org/W2071371484,"A carbon allotrope based on ""sp"" hybridization containing alternating triple and single bonds (an acetylenic or linear carbon allotrope) has been prepared. Studies of small (8 to 28 carbon atoms) acetylenic carbon model compounds show that such species are quite stable (130 degrees to 140 degrees C) provided that nonreactive terminal groups or end caps (such as tert-butyl or trifluoromethyl) are present to stabilize these molecules against further reactions. In the presence of end capping groups, laser-based synthetic techniques similar to those normally used to generate fullerenes, produce thermally stable acetylenic carbon species capped with trifluoromethyl or nitrile groups with chain lengths in excess of 300 carbon atoms. Under these conditions, only a negligible quantity of fullerenes is produced. Acetylenic carbon compounds are not particularly moisture or oxygen sensitive but are moderately light sensitive."
https://openalex.org/W2062430101,"Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) have been used to determine the dimensions of a series of palladium clusters stabilized by tetraalkylammonium salts. Electrochemically prepared colloids were used in which the average diameter of the inner metal core was varied between 2 and 4 nanometers, and the size of the ammonium ions was adjusted in the series (+)N(n-C(4)H(9))(4) < (+)N(n-C(8)H(17))(4) < (+)N(n-C(18)H(37))(4). The difference between the mean diameter determined by STM and that measured by TEM allows the determination of the thickness of the protective surfactant layer. On the basis of these studies, a model of the geometric properties of ammonium-stabilized palladium clusters has been proposed. Suggestions for the mechanism of the STM imaging process are also made."
https://openalex.org/W1996039542,"Over the last several years there have been great improvements in the energy resolution and detection efficiency of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. These improvements have made it possible to discover a number of fascinating features in the electronic structure of the high transition temperature (T(c)) superconductors: apparently bandlike Fermi surfaces, flat-band saddle points, and nested Fermi surface sections. Recent work suggests that these features, previously thought explainable only by one-electron band theory, may be better understood with a many-body approach. Furthermore, other properties of the high-T(c) superconductors, which are difficult to understand with band theory, are well described using a many-body picture. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy has also been used to investigate the nature of the superconducting pairing state, revealing an anisotropic gap consistent with a d-wave order parameter and fueling the current debate over s-wave versus d-wave superconductivity."
https://openalex.org/W2019918459,"The sensitivities of astrometric and radial velocity searches for extrasolar planets are strongly dependent on planetary masses and orbits. Because most nearby stars are less massive than the sun, the first detection is likely to be of a Jupiter-mass planet orbiting a low-mass star, with a possible theoretical expectation being that Jupiter-like planets will be found much closer [inside the Earth-sun separation of 1 astronomical unit (AU)] to these low-luminosity stars than Jupiter is to the sun (5.2 AU). However, radiative hydrodynamic models of protoplanetary disks around low-mass stars (of 0.1 to 1 solar mass) show that Jupiter-like planets should form at distances (approximately 4 to 5 AU) that are only weakly dependent on the stellar mass."
https://openalex.org/W1990296166,"A method for dating clays is important for studies of weathering, diagenesis, hydrocarbon migration, and the formation of major metalliferous deposits. However, many attempts have produced imprecise or inaccurate results. Data from shales show that, contrary to expectations, the (40)Ar-(39)Ar dating technique can be successfully used to determine the diagenetic age of ancient sediments because (39)Ar losses during irradiation are controlled by release from low retentivity sites in illite equivalent to those that have lost radiogenic (40)Ar in nature, rather than by direct recoil as is generally assumed."
https://openalex.org/W1971597806,"The abundance of radiogenic Sr(87) relative to Sr(86) at the time of crystallization has been determined for 45 rocks. The total range in the ratio Sr(87)/Sr(86) is less than 2 percent. Ratios for recent lavas range from 0.702 to 0.711. Oceanic basalts are closely grouped at 0.703, whereas ratios for continental volcanic rocks spread from 0.702 to 0.711. Among the volcanic rocks, ranging from basalt to rhyolite, no correlation was found between original ratio and rock type. Older mafic and felsic rocks that include both plutonic and extrusive types also cover this same range in original Sr(87)/Sr(86) ratios; however, there is a definite trend with geologic time. Precambrian rocks give values as low as 0.700. The data indicate that Sr(87)/Sr(86) of the weathering crust has changed 1.1 percent in 3000 million years, while the ratio in the mantle has changed no more than 0.5 percent."
https://openalex.org/W2061051011,Heavily ionizing particles create trails of damage as they move through materials. In both addition and condensation polymers these trails can be selectively dissolved so that the sites and the directions taken by the moving particles are revealed. These materials thus serve as simple detectors of heavily charged particles.

Such particles would facilitate successive aggregation into planets, comets, and asteroids. The difficulties associated with the aggregation of spherical smoke particles would thus be avoided."
https://openalex.org/W2053318988,"Phase changes in stratospheric aerosols were studied by cooling a droplet of sulfuric acid (H(2)SO(4)) in the presence of nitric acid (HNO(3)) and water vapor. A sequence of solid phases was observed to form that followed Ostwald's rule for phase nucleation. For stratospheric partial pressures at temperatures between 193 and 195 kelvin, a metastable ternary H(2)SO(4)-HNO(3) hydrate, H(2)SO(4) . HNO(3) . 5H(2)O, formed in coexistence with binary H(2)SO(4) . kH(2)O hydrates (k = 2, 3, and 4) and then transformed to nitric acid dihydrate, HNO(3) . 2H(2)O, within a few hours. Metastable HNO(3) . 2H(2)O always formed before stable nitric acid trihydrate, HNO(3).3H(2)O, under stratospheric conditions and persisted for long periods. The formation of metastable phases provides a mechanism for differential particle growth and sedimentation of HNO(3) from the polar winter stratosphere."

Both gulfs closely coincide with the intersection of oceanic rises with continents and have likely been formed under tensional forces, which suggests an association with mantle convection currents."

A peak production of over 3400 microl per kilogram hour was obtained when 97 percent of the blooms were faded."
https://openalex.org/W2090903431,"The microscopic structure of oxygen confined in silica xerogels has been studied as a function of temperature. In large pores, a crystalline solid forms with a structure consistent with that of the bulk. The size of the crystallites is much larger than the pore size, indicating that cooperative effects among pores are important in freezing. As the pore size is decreased, a crossover occurs where solidification results in an amorphous phase in the pores. The resulting amorphous phase is solid but is less ordered than the liquid phase."
https://openalex.org/W2062440886,"Photographs, made at a speed of 5 microseconds, of the ejection of the Arceuthobium seed from its fruit, show that tumbling in the vertical plane begins soon after discharge and that most seeds have turned 90 degrees when they have traveled about 6 centimeters. As the seeds leave the fruit they have a viscous sheath around the trailing end that disintegrates after the seeds have traveled about 2 to 3 centimeters. This viscous material does not act as a rudder as has been postulated."
https://openalex.org/W2018471200,The production of agglutinins to Salmonella typhi was studied in the opossum embryo in the period immediately before and after the development of thymic and lymph node lymphoid tissue. Antibody was found only in embryos older than 8 days which corresponds to an 8- to 10-week human embryo in terms of organogenesis and is the earliest stage at which antibody production has been recorded.
https://openalex.org/W2028866791,"Although man has known for centuries that glass had potentially large mechanical capabilities, he had been content, until rather recently, to accept the fragility of bulk glass. Annealing, the first step in making glass a useful material, enabled him to make articles with strengths adequate for satisfactory service. Physical tempering provided the next big advance, permitting strengths more than three times those of annealed glass in simple shapes. Today, chemical strengthening is a real possibility for producing glass articles, regardless of design, more than three times the strength of physically tempered ware."

https://openalex.org/W2064245524,"In order to determine the endocrine factors in the production of the incubation patch of phalarope birds (Steganopus tricolor and Lobipes lobatus), adults of both sexes have been maintained in captivity and injected with estradiol, testosterone, or prolactin, or with different combinations of these hormones. Only testosterone and prolactin in combination produced incubation patches in all birds, both male and female, in the two species."
https://openalex.org/W2092179895,"Wisconsinan loess from Illinois and Iowa contains a varied assemblage of microfossils including radiolaria, foraminifera, sponge spicules, and opal phytoliths. The foraminifera and radiolaria are derived from Cretaceous rocks occurring on the northern Great Plains. The sponge spicules are from fresh-water sponges living during the epoch of loess deposition. The phytoliths were produced by vegetation growing during deposition. These microfossils are valuable in determining loess and till provenance and in paleoecological reconstruction."

https://openalex.org/W1997450279,"The obvious and not original conclusion is that the results obtained from considerations of sp(3) hybridization in the substituted methanes breaks down as soon as all of the bonding atoms are not equivalent. Indeed, the concept of sp(3) localized carbon hybrids may be invalid even for tetrahedral molecules like CCl(4) where the result of tetrahedral angles may be inferred from a naive hard sphere model. In other words the electrons in CCl(4) have a more delocalized molecular quality than the apparently more localized atomic quality in CH(4). This result implies that perhaps a Hartree-Fock treatment of the outer valence electrons in the substituted methanes (frozen inner atomic shells) might give a fairly good description of the electron distribution. On the other hand, the valence bond method would have to be carried well past the convenient approximation of perfect pairing. McWeeny and Ohno (23) were quite optimistic about the frozen inner atomic shell approximation in their treatment of H(2)O. As far as the strained small-ring compounds it appears the bending of a bond is a function of where one decides to draw the line between localized and delocalized character. Finally, no more appropriate ending could be contrived than a classic quote by Professor R. S. Mulliken (37), ""I believe the chemical bond is not so simple as some people seem to think."""
