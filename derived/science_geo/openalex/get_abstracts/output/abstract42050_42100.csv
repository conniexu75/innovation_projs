https://openalex.org/W1771251144,"The three-dimensional structure of the alpha 2 beta 2 complex of tryptophan synthase from Salmonella typhimurium has been determined by x-ray crystallography at 2.5 A resolution. The four polypeptide chains are arranged nearly linearly in an alpha beta beta alpha order forming a complex 150 A long. The overall polypeptide fold of the smaller alpha subunit, which cleaves indole glycerol phosphate, is that of an 8-fold alpha/beta barrel. The alpha subunit active site has been located by difference Fourier analysis of the binding of indole propanol phosphate, a competitive inhibitor of the alpha subunit and a close structural analog of the natural substrate. The larger pyridoxal phosphate-dependent beta subunit contains two domains of nearly equal size, folded into similar helix/sheet/helix structures. The binding site for the coenzyme pyridoxal phosphate lies deep within the interface between the two beta subunit domains. The active sites of neighboring alpha and beta subunits are separated by a distance of about 25 A. A tunnel with a diameter matching that of the intermediate substrate indole connects these active sites. The tunnel is believed to facilitate the diffusion of indole from its point of production in the alpha subunit active site to the site of tryptophan synthesis in the beta active site and thereby prevent its escape to the solvent during catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W2062876104,"A cell-free translation system has been constructed that uses a continuous flow of the feeding buffer [including amino acids, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and guanosine triphosphate (GTP)] through the reaction mixture and a continuous removal of a polypeptide product. Both prokaryotic (Escherichia coli) and eukaryotic (wheat embryos, Triticum sp.) versions of the system have been tested. In both cases the system has proven active for long times, synthesizing polypeptides at a high constant rate for tens of hours. With the use of MS2 phage RNA or brome mosaic virus RNA 4 as templates, 100 copies of viral coat proteins per RNA were synthesized for 20 hours in the prokaryotic or eukaryotic system, respectively. With synthetic calcitonin messenger RNA, 150 to 300 copies of calcitonin polypeptide were produced per messenger RNA in both types of continuous translation systems for 40 hours."

https://openalex.org/W1992901862,"Sp1 is a sequence-specific DNA binding protein that activates RNA polymerase II transcription from promoters that contain properly positioned GC boxes. A series of deletion mutants of Sp1 were expressed in Escherichia coli and used to identify separate regions of the protein that are important for three different biochemical activities. The sequence-specificity of DNA binding was conferred by Zn(II) fingers, whereas a different region of Sp1 appeared to regulate the affinity of DNA binding. The E. coli-synthesized Sp1 was able to stimulate initiation of RNA synthesis in vitro, and at least two distinct segments of the protein contributed to its transcriptional activity."
https://openalex.org/W1527774170,"Mating type a cells of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae produce a mating hormone, the a-factor, that we have previously characterized as a very hydrophobic, modified dodecapeptide (Betz, R., Crabb, J. W., Meyer, H. E., Wittig, R., and Duntze, W. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 546-548). We have investigated the molecular structure in detail using mass spectrometry and proton NMR spectrometry of the intact hormone and authentic component molecules. Tandem mass spectrometry confirms the previously determined peptide sequence of the hormone and shows that it contains additional structural components with masses of 205 and 15 daltons. These were identified by proton NMR and mass spectrometry as a farnesyl (C15H25) residue and a terminal methyl ester group. The farnesyl moiety is attached to the sulfur atom of the carboxyl-terminal cysteine residue, as revealed by NMR of synthetic S-farnesyl cysteine methyl ester. The stereochemical configuration of the farnesyl moiety was determined to be trans,trans by comparison of gas chromatography retention times, mass spectra, and NMR spectra with those of standards. These results define the structure of a-factor as: (Sequence: see text). Replacement of the farnesyl by a methyl group leads to a partial reduction in specific biological activity of the a-factor, whereas hydrolysis of the carboxyl-terminal methyl ester causes a complete loss of activity."
https://openalex.org/W2156440952,"D-galactose-binding (or chemoreceptor) protein of Escherichia coli serves as an initial component for both chemotaxis towards galactose and glucose and high-affinity active transport of the two sugars. Well-refined x-ray structures of the liganded forms of the wild-type and a mutant protein isolated from a strain defective in chemotaxis but fully competent in transport have provided a molecular view of the sugar-binding site and of a site for interacting with the Trg transmembrane signal transducer. The geometry of the sugar-binding site, located in the cleft between the two lobes of the bilobate protein, is novel in that it is designed for tight binding and sequestering of either the alpha or beta anomer of the D-stereoisomer of the 4-epimers galactose and glucose. Binding specificity and affinity are conferred primarily by polar planar side-chain residues that form intricate networks of cooperative and bidentate hydrogen bonds with the sugar substrates, and secondarily by aromatic residues that sandwich the pyranose ring. Each of the pairs of anomeric hydroxyls and epimeric hydroxyls is recognized by a distinct Asp residue. The site for interaction with the transducer is about 18 A from the sugar-binding site. Mutation of Gly74 to Asp at this site, concomitant with considerable changes in the local ordered water structures, contributes to the lack of productive interaction with the transmembrane signal transducer."
https://openalex.org/W2044530341,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and its less severe form Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) are allelic disorders. It has been suggested that in the mutations involving BMD, the translational reading frame of messenger RNA is maintained and a smaller, though partially functional, protein is produced. In order to test this, the exon-intron boundaries of the first ten exons of the DMD gene were determined, and 29 patients were analyzed. In a number of BMD patients (mild and severe BMD), the reading frame of messenger RNA was not maintained. On the basis of these findings, a model for reinitiation from an internal start codon is suggested."
https://openalex.org/W1979818867,"The anticodon has previously been shown to play a role in recognition of certain transfer RNAs by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases; however, the extent to which this sequence dictates tRNA identity is generally unknown. To investigate the contribution of the anticodon to the identity of Escherichia coli methionine and valine tRNAs, in vitro transcripts of these tRNAs were prepared that contained normal and interchanged anticodon sequences. Transcripts containing wild-type tRNA sequences were excellent substrates for their respective cognate aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and were effectively discriminated against by a variety of noncognate enzymes. The mutant tRNAs produced by switching the anticodon sequences lost their original tRNA identity and assumed an identity corresponding to the acquired anticodon sequence. These results indicate that the anticodon contains sufficient information to distinguish methionine and valine tRNAs with high fidelity."
https://openalex.org/W2025650658,"Regulation of mRNA turnover has emerged as an important control point in lymphokine and oncogene expression. We have studied a monocytic tumor in which activation of GM-CSF expression results from the constitutive stabilization of the normally short-lived GM-CSF mRNA. Linkage of the germ-line 3′ untranslated region of the GM-CSF gene to a neo reporter gene demonstrated that mRNA stabilization is mediated by a tumor-specific trans-acting factor(s), rather than by an alteration of the GM-CSF gene itself. Significantly, similar fusions of the c-myc and c-fos 3′ untranslated regions to neo yielded mRNAs that turned over rapidly in all cells, including the tumor cells. These results demonstrate that AU-rich mRNA turnover signals are recognized differentially in trans within the same cell."
https://openalex.org/W2084222138,"Desipramine and several other tricyclic antidepressant drugs reverse chloroquine resistance in Plasmodium falciparum in vitro at concentrations observed in the plasma of human patients treated for depression. Reversal of resistance is associated with increased chloroquine accumulation in the parasite, probably because of inhibition of a putative chloroquine efflux pump. When owl monkeys (Aotus lemurinus lemurinus) infected with chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum were treated with chloroquine plus desipramine, their parasitemias were rapidly suppressed. Desipramine was found to be one of the most effective compounds yet described for the reversal of chloroquine resistance both in vitro and in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2126911149,"The pol gene of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) is expressed as a gag:pol fusion, arising from a ribosomal frameshift that brings the overlapping, out-of-phase gag and pol genes into translational phase. In this study, we show that HIV frameshifting is mediated by a very short sequence in the viral RNA. We demonstrate the importance of a homopolymeric run within this sequence and conclude that HIV frame-shifting is not dependent on stem-loop structures downstream from the frameshift site. Our analysis also indicates that the sequence requirements are identical in mammalian and yeast systems."
https://openalex.org/W2022713916,"The human malaria parasite P. falciparum exhibits extensive strain-dependent chromosomal polymorphisms that have been implicated in the generation of antigenic variability in this organism. These polymorphisms can result in large deletions in chromosomes as determined by pulsed-field gradient gel electrophoresis. We have investigated the molecular basis for extensive deletions in chromosomes 2 and 8 in multiple geographic isolates of this parasite that result in the loss of expression of well-characterized parasite antigens. The structure of these polymorphic chromosomes reveal that a mechanism of chromosome breakage and healing by the addition of telomeric repeats most plausibly accounts for these karyotypes. Furthermore, the orientation of these gene fragments on their truncated chromosomes reveal that the healed chromosome originally associated with centromeric elements is mitotically stable and maintained. A model for the possible role of this mechanism in the complex parasite life-cycle is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1613928181,"The Escherichia coli gene purR, encoding a repressor protein, was cloned by complementation of a purR mutation. Gene purR on a multicopy plasmid repressed expression of purF and purF-lacZ and reduced the growth rate of host cells by limiting the rate of de novo purine nucleotide synthesis. The level of a 1.3-kilobase purR mRNA was higher in cells grown with excess adenine, suggesting that synthesis of the repressor may be regulated. The chromosomal locus of purR was mapped to coordinate 1755-kb on the E. coli restriction map (Kohara, Y., Akiyama, K., and Isono, K. (1987) Cell 50, 495-508). Pur repressor bound specifically to purF operator DNA as determined by gel retardation and DNase I footprinting assays. The amino acid sequence of Pur repressor was derived from the nucleotide sequence. Pur repressor subunit contains 341 amino acids and has a calculated Mr of 38,179. Pur repressor is 31-35% identical with the galR and cytR repressors and 26% identical with the lacI repressor. These four repressors are likely homologous. Amino acid sequence similarity is greatest in an amino-terminal region presumed to contain a DNA-binding domain. A similarity is also noted in the operator sites for these repressors."
https://openalex.org/W1580454189,"Retroviruses code for a virus-specific protease which is essential for polyprotein processing and viral infectivity. The human immune deficiency virus-1 protease is an aspartic protease of 9 kDa which was synthesized by recombinant DNA technology and arises by autocatalytic processing from a polyprotein precursor which has recently been demonstrated by use of a protease-specific monoclonal antibody. The protease was shown to form dimers. Here we demonstrate that synthetic peptides can be used as both model substrates as well as inhibitors for investigation of the protease. 14 synthetic peptides, 7-18 amino acids in length, containing putative protease cleavage sites of the viral polyprotein gag and pol precursors, have been analyzed with the partially purified protease by the use of high performance liquid chromatography. In seven cases, where cleavage was observed, the length of the peptides did not significantly influence the cleavage efficiencies, heptapeptides being large enough as model substrates. No cleavage was observed with a protein preparation purified in parallel from control bacteria not expressing the human immune deficiency virus-1 protease. The protease was not only able to cut next to a proline but also between other peptides indicating that the proline is not a prerequisite. Three peptides with either reduced bonds at the cleavage site or a substitution by statin were inhibitory while another uncleaved substrate was not. The usefulness of small model substrates for characterization of the protease is further demonstrated by determination of a kinetic optimum pH (3.5-5.5) and incubation temperature (37 degrees C)."
https://openalex.org/W2066645519,"Methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs) function as transmembrane signalers in bacteria. We isolated and characterized mutants of the E. coli Tsr protein that produce output signals in the absence of overt stimuli and that are refractory to sensory adaptation. The properties of these “locked” transducers indicate that MCP molecules are capable of generating signals that actively augment clockwise and counterclockwise rotation of the flagellar motors. Transitions between MCP signaling states can be influenced by amino acid replacements in many parts of the molecule, including the methylation sites, at least one of the two membrane-spanning segments, and a linker region connecting the receptor and signaling domains. These findings suggest that transmembrane signaling may involve direct propagation of conformational changes between the periplasmic and cytoplasmic portions of the MCP molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1825932201,"Abstract We have investigated the ability of DNA polymerases from SOS-induced and uninduced Escherichia coli to incorporate nucleotides at a well-defined abasic (apurinic/apyrimidinic) DNA template site and to extend these chains from this unpaired 3' terminus. A DNA polymerase activity has been purified from E. coli, deleted for DNA polymerase I, that appears to be induced 7-fold in cells following treatment with nalidixic acid. Induction of this polymerase (designated DNA polymerase X) appears to be part of the SOS response of E. coli since it cannot be induced in strains containing a noncleavable form of the LexA repressor (Ind-). The enzyme is able to incorporate nucleotides efficiently opposite the abasic template lesion and to continue DNA synthesis. Although we observe an approximate 2-fold induction of DNA polymerase III in cells treated with nalidixic acid, several lines of evidence argue that DNA polymerase X is unrelated to DNA polymerase III (pol III). In contrast to pol X, pol III shows almost no detectable ability to incorporate at or extend beyond the abasic site; incorporation efficiency at the abasic lesion is at least 100-fold larger for pol X compared to pol III holoenzyme, pol III core, or pol III* (the polymerase III holoenzyme subassembly lacking the beta subunit). Pol X does not cross-react with polyclonal antibody directed against pol III holoenzyme complex or with monoclonal antibody prepared to the alpha subunit of pol III. Despite these structural and biochemical differences, pol X appears to interact specifically with the beta subunit of the pol III holoenzyme in the presence of single-stranded binding protein. Pol X has a molecular mass of 84 kDa. Our results indicate that this novel activity is likely to be identical to DNA polymerase II of E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W1588184424,"The nucleotide sequence of the biotin (bio) biosynthetic operon of Escherichia coli has been determined. The 5.8-kilobase region contains the five biotin operon genes, bioA, B, F, C, and D. and an open reading frame of unknown function. The operon is negatively regulated and divergently transcribed from a control region between the bioA and bioB genes. The product of the bioA gene, 7,8-diaminopelargonic acid aminotransferase, was discovered to be related to ornithine aminotransferase. The product of the bioF gene, 7-keto-8-aminopelargonic acid synthetase, was found to be similar to 5-aminolevulinic acid synthetase."
https://openalex.org/W1488890226,"The proton transport properties of hygromycin B-resistant pma1 mutants which show kinetic defects in the plasma membrane H+-ATPase were examined. It was found that net proton efflux, as measured by whole cell medium acidification in the presence of 25 mM KCl, was similar for normal and pma1 mutant cells. However, in the absence of added KCl, the extent of net proton efflux was considerably less in wild type than in pma1 mutant cells. The cellular membrane potential was implicated as an important factor in regulating net proton transport and was determined from [14C]tetraphenylphosphonium uptake studies to be considerably depolarized in the pma1 mutants. The growth of wild type cells, which is normally inhibited by hygromycin B at 200 micrograms/ml, was found to be resistant to the antibiotic by the addition of 50 mM KCl to the growth medium. These results suggest that the electrogenic behavior of proton transport by the H+-ATPase may be altered in pma1 mutants and that resistance to hygromycin B may be mediated via depolarization of the cellular membrane potential."
https://openalex.org/W1489232619,"In bovine adrenal chromaffin cells nicotinic stimulation or a depolarizing concentration of K+ caused a rapid, transient translocation to membranes of as much as 14% of the total cellular protein kinase C activity. The quantitative relationship between membrane-bound protein kinase C and Ca2+-dependent secretion was determined in cells rendered leaky by digitonin treatment. Intact cells were incubated with various concentrations of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) to activate and cause translocation of protein kinase C to membrane before permeabilization in the presence of Ca2+. For the same amount of membrane-bound protein kinase C, a similar degree of enhancement of Ca2+-dependent secretion occurred in cells incubated for 1 or 30 min with TPA. Translocation of as little as 2-3% of the cellular protein kinase C to the membrane enhanced Ca2+-dependent secretion by 25-30%. Muscarinic agonists caused a 5% increase in membrane-bound protein kinase C at 2 s which rapidly reversed. Nicotinic and muscarinic receptor-mediated increases in membrane-bound protein kinase C were additive at 10 s and synergistic at 3 min. Muscarinic stimulation enhanced nicotinic receptor-dependent secretion. Prior incubation with TPA caused a similar enhancement of nicotinic-mediated secretion. The data indicate that protein kinase C which is translocated within seconds of stimulation of the cells with a nicotinic agonist or elevated K+ probably enhances the secretory response immediately or soon after exocytosis begins. In addition, the muscarinic receptor-mediated enhancement of nicotinic receptor-stimulated secretion may be due to newly activated protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W1488637794,"The introduction of positive charges at the amino terminus of the mature domain of secretory proteins resulted in strong inhibition of their translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane of Escherichia coli, both in vitro and in vivo. The model secretory proteins used were OmpF-Lpp chimeric proteins possessing a cleavable or uncleavable signal peptide, beta-lactamase (Bla) and Bla-Lpp chimeric proteins. It is suggested that positively charged residues preceding the hydrophobic domain of the signal peptide have a positive effect, and ones following the hydrophobic domain, a negative effect on the translocation. These findings are discussed in relation to the orientation of membrane proteins, of which positive charges are predominant on the cytoplasmic surface."
https://openalex.org/W1574212876,"The inositol phospholipid metabolism is one of the main pathways of signal transduction in cells. We measured the activities of its key enzymes in v-Ha-ras-transformed 208F rat fibroblasts. In the ras-transformed clones, incorporation of [32P]Pi into intermediates of the inositol phospholipid metabolism was stimulated. The activities of phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate kinases in the transformed clones were about 35-50% more than in untransformed cells, indicating increased inositol phospholipid metabolism. However, the activity of diacylglycerol kinase in their membrane fraction was 25-35% less than that of untransformed cells, although the total diacylglycerol kinase activity did not change. The imbalance of these kinases could constitute one of the main reasons leading to the increased level of inositol phosphates and the accumulation of diacylglycerol to 2-2.2 times that in control 208F cells. Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate-phospholipase C activity did not change on the transformation when assayed under various conditions. The increased level of diacylglycerol caused intracellular translocation, activation, and down-regulation of protein kinase C changes which may be one of the essential events in transformation by the v-Ha-ras gene."
https://openalex.org/W1559005407,"Abstract The histidine permease of Salmonella typhimurium consists of four protein components, one located in the periplasm and three in the cytoplasmic membrane. Genetic evidence indicated that the periplasmic protein interacts with the membrane proteins during transport. We have utilized two different methods to demonstrate that the periplasmic protein cross-links specifically to one of the membrane components, the Q protein. Formaldehyde, a water-soluble permeant molecule was used in vivo. Sulfosuccinimidyl 6-(4'-azido-2'-nitrophenylamino)hexanoate, a photoactivatable cross-linking reagent, was used in vitro in a reconstituted membrane vesicle system. Furthermore, we show that a mutant periplasmic protein, capable of binding substrate but not transporting it, is defective in cross-linking to the membrane protein, indicating this interaction to be a crucial step in the mechanism of transport."
https://openalex.org/W1490867373,Plastocyanin is synthesized in the cytoplasm as a larger precursor and transported into the thylakoid lumen of the chloroplast. Maturation of preplastocyanin involves successive cleavages by a stromal peptidase and a distinct thylakoidal peptidase. In this report we have analyzed the precise location and orientation of the thylakoidal peptidase with respect to the thylakoid membrane. Experiments involving differential centrifugation of thylakoid extracts and sonication of isolated vesicles indicate that the peptidase is tightly bound to the thylakoid membrane but not intimately associated with any of the major thylakoid protein complexes. Analysis of the lateral distribution of the peptidase has shown that the enzyme is exclusively located in the non-appressed lamellae of the thylakoid network. The active site of the peptidase is on the lumenal face of the thylakoid membrane.
https://openalex.org/W1534211784,"Abstract DNA strand breaks with damaged 3' termini are potentially toxic lesions caused by free radicals. The purified yeast diesterase that removes small nucleotide fragments from such 3' termini in oxidized DNA has been further characterized with respect to its substrate specificity. In addition to the 3'-phosphoglycolaldehyde esters used to monitor the activity during purification, the enzyme efficiently hydrolyzed a variety of other 3'-esters in DNA. These included 3'-phosphates, 3'-(2,3-didehydro-2,3-dideoxyribose phosphates), and the 3'-blocking damages formed in vivo in Escherichia coli by H2O2 or in vitro by DNA treatment with bleomycin. This same transition metal-dependent enzyme also constitutes the major yeast endonuclease for apurinic/apyrimidinic sites in DNA, hydrolyzing these damages to yield normal 3'-hydroxyl nucleotides and 5'-phosphoryl base-free sugar termini (a Type II apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease). Yeast 3'-phosphoglycolaldehyde diesterase therefore appears to be involved in two distinct pathways of DNA repair: initiation of the repair of oxidative strand breaks in DNA and the restoration of sites of base loss caused by many types of DNA-damaging agents."
https://openalex.org/W1970981824,"Based on the chromatin structures of the yeast URA3 gene and the TRP1ARS1 circle, we have designed circular minichromosomes of different sizes that should each form a tight tetranucleosome. This structure was assumed to be stiff and bulky and therefore likely to be sensitive to packaging into a three-dimensional structure. The structures of the minichromosomes were determined using micrococcal nuclease. Only one of the minichromosomes showed a protected region of about 570 bp, compatible with the predicted tight tetranucleosome, while all other constructs showed alternative structures. A comparison of the structures revealed that neither histone-DNA interactions nor influences from flanking boundaries are sufficient determinants of nucleosome positions. The data strongly suggest that chromatin folding modulates the nucleosome arrangement along the DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1596644386,"We tested whether translocation of glucose transporters between subcellular membrane fractions is involved in the stimulation of glucose transport by anoxia by perfusing rat hearts in the presence or absence of oxygen. The hearts were then fractionated by a modification of the procedures of Watanabe, et al. (Watanabe, T., Smith, M. M., Robinson, F. W., and Kono, T. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 13117-13122), who previously demonstrated translocation in response to insulin in heart, to give plasma membrane and high-speed pellet fractions. The contents of glucose transporters in the two fractions were determined by reconstitution of transport activity, D-glucose-reversible binding of cytochalasin B, and labeling with antibodies against the erythrocyte transporter. The heart transporter was also recognized by antibodies against the COOH-terminal peptide of the glucose transporter. All three types of assays revealed a decrease (20-30%) in the high-speed pellet fraction and an increase (20-70%) in the plasma membranes in response to anoxia. Treatment of hearts with insulin produced a similar extent of translocation and a similar stimulation (about 2-fold) of glucose uptake, indicating that translocation plays a role of similar importance in the stimulation of transport by both of these effectors."
https://openalex.org/W1580425989,"Abstract The DNA strand breaks resulting from exposure to the free radicals generated by ionizing radiation or oxidizing agents are refractory to DNA repair synthesis because of deoxyribose fragments that block their 3' termini. The restoration of normal 3'-OH nucleotide primers is the essential first step in the excision repair of these radical-induced strand breaks. We have used a synthetic DNA substrate containing 3'-phosphoglycolaldehyde esters to identify and purify to physical homogeneity the major yeast diesterase that removes such nucleotide fragments. Yeast 3'-phosphoglycolaldehyde diesterase had Mr = 40,500 upon sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A similar molecular weight estimate from gel filtration indicated that the active species is a nearly globular monomer. Purification of the enzyme removed a tightly bound metal, but the activity of the purified enzyme could be restored by the addition of Co2+, Mn2+, Ni2+, or Zn2+, with Co2+ the most effective cofactor. Even 3 microM Co2+ stimulated near-maximal activity, and this metal also conferred significant thermal stability on the purified protein. This is a novel enzyme, whose N-terminal amino acid sequence does not show any significant similarity to published sequences, and which is not the product of any gene in the RAD52 epistasis group."
https://openalex.org/W1808724914,"Febrile sepsis was induced in rats by repeated s.c. injections of live Escherichia coli bacteria. Glucose utilization of different tissues was investigated in vivo by using the 2-deoxyglucose tracer technique. In septic rats the rate of glucose utilization was increased in macrophage-rich tissues, including the liver (2.7-fold), spleen (2.4-fold), and ileum (1.6-fold), compared with tissues from time-matched nonseptic animals. A smaller increase in glucose utilization was evident in the abdominal muscle (1.3-fold) and in the white portion of the quadriceps muscle (1.3-fold). Changes were not significant in nine other tissues, including the brain. We postulate that in sepsis the mononuclear phagocyte system may be responsible for most of the increment of glucose utilization, and the latter provides metabolic support for the increased antibacterial activity of these cells.—Meszaros, K.; Lang, C. H.; Bagby, G. J.; Spitzer, J. J. In vivo glucose utilization by individual tissues during nonlethal hypermetabolic sepsis. FASEB J. 2: 3083-3086; 1988."
https://openalex.org/W1483058401,"Ketogenesis is usually measured in vivo by dilution of tracers of (3R)-hydroxybutyrate or acetoacetate. We show that, in perfused working rat hearts, the specific activities of (3R)-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate are diluted by isotopic exchanges in the absence of net ketogenesis. We call this process pseudoketogenesis. When hearts are perfused with buffer containing 2.3 mM of [4-3H]- plus [3-14C]acetoacetate, the specific activities of [4-3H] and [3-14C]acetoacetate decrease while C-1 of acetoacetate becomes progressively labeled with 14C. This is explained by the reversibility of reactions catalyzed by mitochondrial 3-oxoacid-CoA transferase and acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase. After activation of labeled acetoacetate, the specific activity of acetoacetyl-CoA is diluted by unlabeled acetoacetyl-CoA derived from endogenous fatty acids or glucose. Acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase partially exchanges 14C between C-1 and C-3 of acetoacetyl-CoA. Finally, 3-oxoacid-CoA transferase liberates weakly labeled acetoacetate which dilutes the specific activity of extracellular acetoacetate. An isotopic exchange in the reverse direction is observed when hearts are perfused with unlabeled acetoacetate plus [1-14C]-, [13-14C]-, or [15-14C]palmitate; here also, acetoacetate becomes labeled on C-1 and C-3. Computations of specific activities of (3R)-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate, and acetyl-CoA yield minimal rates of pseudoketogenesis ranging from 19 to 32% of the net uptake of (3R)-hydroxybutyrate plus acetoacetate by the heart."
https://openalex.org/W1632346910,"Ornithine decarboxylase from the African trypanosome is an important target for antitrypanosomal chemotherapy. Despite this, the enzyme had not been previously purified or extensively characterized as it is a very low level protein. In this paper we describe the purification of Trypanosoma brucei brucei ornithine decarboxylase from bloodstream form trypomastigotes by 107,000-fold to a specific activity of 2.7 x 10(6) nmol CO2/h/mg of protein in the parasite. T. brucei ornithine decarboxylase had a native molecular weight of 90,000 and a subunit molecular weight of 45,000. The isoelectric point of the protein was 5.0. The Km for ornithine was 280 microM and the Ki for the irreversible inhibitor alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) was 220 microM with a half-time of inactivation at saturating DFMO concentration of 2.7 min. T. brucei ornithine decarboxylase appears similar to mouse ornithine decarboxylase, further supporting our previous suggestion that the selective toxicity of DFMO to the parasite is not due to catalytic differences between the two proteins. Although a small quantity of T. brucei ornithine decarboxylase was purified from T. brucei, extensive structural and kinetic studies will require a more ample source of the enzyme. We therefore expressed our previously cloned T. brucei ornithine decarboxylase gene in Escherichia coli using a vector that contains an inducible lambda promoter. T. brucei ornithine decarboxylase activity was induced in E. coli to levels that were 50 to 200 fold of that present in the long-slender bloodstream form of T. brucei. Ornithine decarboxylase activity in the crude E. coli lysate was 1500-6000 nmol of CO2/h/mg of protein and represented 0.05-0.2% of the total cell protein. The recombinant T. brucei ornithine decarboxylase was purified to apparent homogeneity from the transformed E. coli. The purified recombinant enzyme had kinetic and physical properties essentially identical to those of the native enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1497199898,"We have utilized the H2a-specific protease as a unique probe to investigate the nature of the interactions between the protein subunits which form the core histone octamer. Upon incubation in high ionic strength media this protease, normally found tightly associated with isolated calf thymus chromatin, releases the 15 COOH-terminal amino acids of histone H2a by specifically cleaving the H2a polypeptide between Val114 and Leu115, yielding cleaved H2a (cH2a) and a free pentadecapeptide (Eickbush, T. H., Watson, D. K., and Moudrianakis, E. N. (1976) Cell 9, 785-792). We find that removal of this pentadecapeptide results in a marked dissociation of the octamer into its H2a:H2b dimer and H3:H4 tetramer subunits. Reconstitution experiments indicate that cH2a is capable of forming a dimer with H2b, but this cH2a:H2b dimer has a substantially lower affinity for the H3:H4 tetramer than native H2a:H2b dimer. Kinetic studies of H2a cleavage in high ionic strength solutions demonstrate that H2a molecules in the octamer are relatively resistant to proteolytic attack compared to H2a molecules in the dimer. The extent of this resistance, in response to various experimental parameters, is directly correlated to the strength of interaction between the H2a:H2b dimer and H3:H4 tetramer subunits. These reconstitution and kinetic experiments suggest that the histone domains proximal to the H2a cleavage site have an important function in maintaining the association of the histone octamer subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1917437221,"In Escherichia coli, the branch point between the Krebs cycle and the glyoxylate bypass is regulated by the phosphorylation of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH). Phosphorylation inactivates IDH, forcing isocitrate through the bypass. This bypass is essential for growth on acetate but does not serve a useful function when alternative carbon sources, such as glucose or pyruvate, are also present. When pyruvate or glucose is added to a culture growing on acetate, the cells responded by dephosphorylating IDH and thus inhibiting the flow of isocitrate through the glyoxylate bypass. In an effort to identify the primary rate-limiting step in the response of IDH phosphorylation to alternative carbon sources, we have examined the response rates of congenic strains of E. coli which express different levels of IDH kinase/phosphatase, the bifunctional protein which catalyzes this phosphorylation cycle. The rate of the pyruvate-induced dephosphorylation of IDH was proportional to the level of IDH kinase/phosphatase, indicating that IDH kinase/phosphatase was primarily rate-limiting for dephosphorylation. However, the identity of the primary rate-limiting step appears to depend on the stimulus, since the rate of dephosphorylation of IDH in response to glucose was independent of the level of IDH kinase/phosphatase."
https://openalex.org/W1578815762,"The 325-residue outer membrane protein, OmpA, of Escherichia coli, like most other outer membrane proteins with known sequence, contains no long stretch of hydrophobic amino acids. A synthetic oligonucleotide, encoding the sequence Leu-Ala-Leu-Val, was inserted four times between the codons for amino acid residues 153 and 154 and two, three, or four times between the codons for residues 228 and 229, resulting in the OmpA153-4, OmpA-228-2, -3, and -4 proteins, respectively. In the first case, the lipophilic sequence anchored the protein in the plasma membrane. In the OmpA228 proteins, 16 but not 12 or 8 lipophilic residues most likely also acted as an anchor. By removal of the NH2-terminal signal peptide, the function of the insert in OmpA153-4 was converted to that of a signal-anchor sequence. Possibly due to differences in amino acid sequences surrounding the insert, no signal function was observed with the insert in OmpA228-4. Production of the OmpA153-4 protein, with or without the NH2-terminal signal sequence, resulted in a block of export of chromosomally encoded OmpA. Clearly, long hydrophobic regions are not permitted within proteins destined for the bacterial outer membrane, and these proteins, therefore, have had to evolve another mechanism of membrane assembly."
https://openalex.org/W1599679506,"Mutations were constructed in vitro which identify the -35 promoter element and the operator site of the Escherichia coli purF operon as well as confirm the -10 promoter sequence. The operator was localized by a two-base change at positions -26 and -27, relative to the start of transcription. This mutation abolished repression of a purF-lacZ fusion. In the wild-type, repression of single copy and multicopy purF-lacZ constructs was equally effective. This indicates that cells contain a greater than 100-fold excess of purR-encoded repressor than is needed to regulate the chromosomal purF operon. Thus, cells contain sufficient repressor to regulate the other pur regulon genes. Two independent purR mutations were isolated which abolished repression of purF and purF-lacZ. We conclude that there is a single repressor protein-operator regulatory system to sense purine or purine nucleotide pools."
https://openalex.org/W1574275716,"The role of exonuclease activity in trans-lesion DNA replication with Escherichia coli DNA polymerase III holoenzyme was investigated. RecA protein inhibited the 3'----5' exonuclease activity of the polymerase 2-fold when assayed in the absence of replication and had no effect on turnover of dNTPs into dNMPs. In contrast, single-stranded DNA-binding protein, which had no effect on the exonuclease activity in the absence of replication, showed a pronounced 7-fold suppression of the 3'----5' exonuclease activity during replication. The excision of incorporated dNMP alpha S residues from DNA by the 3'----5' exonuclease activity of DNA polymerase III holoenzyme was inhibited 10-20-fold; still no increase in bypass of pyrimidine photodimers was observed. Thus, in agreement with our previous results in which the exonuclease activity was inhibited at the protein level (Livneh, Z. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 9526-9533), inhibition at the DNA level also did not increase bypass of photodimers. Fractionation of the replication mixture after termination of DNA synthesis on a Bio-Gel A-5m column under conditions which favor polymerase-DNA binding yielded a termination complex which could perform turnover of dNTPs into dNMPs. Adding challenge-primed single-stranded DNA to the complex yielded a burst of DNA synthesis which was promoted most likely by DNA polymerase III holoenzyme molecules transferred from the termination complex to the challenge DNA thus demonstrating the instability of the polymerase-DNA association. Addition of a fresh sample of DNA polymerase III holoenzyme to purified termination products, which consist primarily of partially replicated molecules with nascent chains terminated at UV lesions, did not result in any net DNA synthesis as expected. However, reactivation of lesion-terminated primers was achieved by pretreatment with a 3'----5' exonuclease which excised 200 nucleotides or more, generating new 3'-OH termini located away from the UV lesions. When these exonuclease-treated products were subjected to a second round of replication, an increased level of DNA synthesis was observed including additional bypass of photodimers. These results suggest the possibility that 3'----5' exonuclease processing might be required at least transiently during one of the stages of trans-lesion DNA replication, which is believed to be the mechanism of SOS-targeted mutagenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1533453598,"Ornithine carbamoyltransferase (OTC; subunit, 36,000 Da) is initially synthesized as a precursor (pOTC) with a transient NH2-terminal presequence of 32 amino acid residues and imported posttranslationally into the mitochondrial matrix. The rat pOTC was synthesized in Escherichia coli using an expression vector containing a thermoinducible lambda pL promoter. The recombinant pOTC represented 5-10% of the total bacterial protein and was present in the precipitate of the disrupted bacteria. The precipitate was washed and pOTC was extracted with 8 M urea or 0.1% cetyltrimethylammonium bromide. The extracted pOTC was essentially homogeneous, as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The purified pOTC was cleaved to the intermediate-sized product of 37,000 Da by a processing protease partially purified from the matrix fraction of rat liver mitochondria. The purified recombinant pOTC, but not the mature form of OTC synthesized in E. coli and purified, competed with the in vitro-synthesized, radiolabeled pOTC for uptake and processing by the isolated rat liver mitochondria. The radiolabeled and purified recombinant pOTC could be imported into the isolated mitochondria and processed to the mature form in an energy- and rabbit reticulocyte lysate-dependent manner. When the purified pOTC was subjected to sucrose gradient centrifugation, it sedimented as a large aggregate of greater than 60 S in the absence of reticulocyte lysate, whereas it sedimented as a complex of about 5 S in the presence of the lysate. These observations together with our previous results indicate that a protein factor(s) present in the lysate interacts with pOTC and holds it in an import-competent form."
https://openalex.org/W1592698358,"RNase D is a 3'-exonuclease whose in vitro specificity has suggested a role in tRNA processing. However, since mutant Escherichia coli strains devoid of RNase D display a normal phenotype, it has not been possible to ascertain the enzyme's function or even to determine which RNA is its substrate in vivo. Here we show that transformation of strains devoid of tRNA nucleotidyltransferase with a multicopy plasmid carrying the rnd+ gene leads to extremely slow growth due to elevated levels of RNase D activity. Analysis of such a slow-growing strain revealed that less tRNA is present in the cell and that the tRNA that could be recovered is substantially damaged. These studies demonstrate that RNase D can act at the 3' terminus of tRNA in vivo, and they support the conclusion that RNase D participates in tRNA metabolism."

https://openalex.org/W1600242953,"The complex between Saccharomyces cerevisiae flavocytochrome b2 and the sulfite anion has been analyzed by x-ray diffraction. A map of the difference in electron density between the complex and the native protein has been computed. One positive peak of electron density is visible at the active site of each of the two subunits in the asymmetric unit, very close to the N-5 of the flavin. The molecular fragment SO3(2-) can account for the shape of this difference in electron density. A third peak is visible in the subunit containing pyruvate, the reaction product. It is a peak of negative electron density localized at the position where the pyruvate usually is in the native form. These results are interpreted on the basis of the mechanism defined in solution for the reaction between flavins and sulfite."
https://openalex.org/W1660918582,"Thirty-five proteins of known x-ray structure were labeled by chloramine-T radioiodination or by reaction with 125I-Bolton-Hunter reagent and introduced into HeLa cells using red cell-mediated microinjection. Degradation rates of the injected proteins were then determined over the next 50 h by measuring the release of soluble isotope to the culture medium. Control experiments demonstrated that the measured rates were not compromised by proteolysis within RBCs, the presence of unfused RBCs, or degradation of protein released from RBCs to the medium. Degradation of some injected proteins was faster during the first 12 h after fusion than at later times, apparently a response of HeLa cells to trypsinization. However, all proteins exhibited first-order degradation rates between 24 and 48 h post injection. Except for seven proteins, stabilities measured during this interval were unaffected by the labeling procedure. Reductive methylation was used to choose among the seven discordant values, and half-lives for the 35 proteins ranged from 16 h for lysozyme to 214 h for yeast alcohol dehydrogenase. Since half-lives for six of the injected proteins closely match values obtained by in vivo measurements, we consider our estimates of the metabolic stabilities of the injected proteins to be generally accurate. Therefore, the half-lives obtained by microinjection should prove useful in the search for relationships between protein structure and intracellular stability."
https://openalex.org/W1701073353,"We have analyzed the nature of RecA protein-RecA protein interactions using an affinity column prepared by coupling RecA protein to an agarose support. When radiolabeled soluble proteins from Escherichia coli are applied to this column, only the labeled RecA protein from the extract was selectively retained and bound tightly to the affinity column. Efficient binding of purified 35S-labeled RecA protein required Mg2+, and high salt did not interfere with the binding of RecA protein to the column. Complete removal of the bound enzyme from the affinity column required treatment with guanidine HCl (5 M) or urea (8 M). These and other properties suggest that hydrophobic interactions contribute significantly to RecA protein subunit recognition in solution. Using a series of truncated RecA proteins synthesized in vitro, we have obtained evidence that at least some of the sequences involved in protein recognition are localized within the first 90 amino-terminal residues of the protein. Based on the observation that RecA proteins from three heterologous bacteria are specifically retained on the E. coli RecA affinity column, it is likely that this binding domain is highly conserved and is required for interaction and association of RecA protein monomers. Stable ternary complexes of RecA protein and single-stranded DNA were formed in the presence of the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog adenosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) and applied to the affinity columns. Most of the complexes formed with M13 DNA could be eluted in high salt, whereas a substantial fraction of those formed with the oligonucleotide (dT)25-30 remained bound in high salt and were quantitatively eluted with guanidine HCl (5 M). The different binding properties of these RecA protein-DNA complexes likely reflect differences in the availability of a hydrophobic surface on RecA protein when it is bound to long polynucleotides compared to short oligonucleotides."
https://openalex.org/W1571527733,"Escherichia coli strains carrying certain prlA mutations (prlA4 and prlA401) could not support the processing and export of staphylokinase, resulting in the accumulation of the precursor form under high-level synthesis conditions. In order to clarify the cause of the defect in the structure of staphylokinase, we constructed signal peptide mutations of sak which suppressed the processing defect in the prlA4 cells by site-directed mutagenesis. The processing defect was suppressed when glycine or asparagine was introduced in place of the serine residue at position 17 from the amino terminus of the signal peptide. Substitutions of glycine for the leucine residue at position 15 and for the serine residue at position 19 were also effective. Other mutations we constructed had no suppression activity. Taking account of the correlation between the suppression activity and the parameter value of each substituted amino acid for the beta-turn probability, we predict that the staphylokinase signal peptide requires a more bending structure at the end of the hydrophobic core to act efficiently in the prlA4 cells than in the prl+ cells and that a function of the PrlA protein necessary to recognize the staphylokinase signal peptide has become deficient through the prlA4 mutation."
https://openalex.org/W1542396125,"Abstract Glucocorticoid hormones induced a stringent dependence on serum for the in vitro proliferation of Fu5 rat hepatoma cells by suppressing the growth rate and final quiescent cell density. Treatment of dexamethasone-suppressed quiescent Fu5 with serum plus insulin caused a rapid reinitiation of cellular proliferation and DNA synthesis that peaked at 16 h. RNA dot blot analysis of this time course showed that the transcript levels for the proto-oncogenes c-fos, c-myc, and c-rasKi peaked at 0.5, 2, and 4 h, respectively, while expression of c-rasHa and ornithine decarboxylase transcripts rose steadily during 16 h. Microspectrofluorimetric measurements of cytosolic calcium (Ca2+i) with fura-2 showed that insulin and serum, alone or in combination, elicited no changes in Ca2+i over a 50-min time course, although ATP, which is not a mitogen, induced large increases in Ca2+i. Cytosolic pH, pHi, was also measured using 2',7'-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein. Insulin and serum, alone or in combination, did not cause pHi to increase in either 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) (pHi 7.17)- or HCO3/CO2 (pHi 7.19)- buffered media. Acid-loading of cells with NH4Cl indicated that both quiescent and proliferating Fu5 cells have equally active, amiloride-sensitive Na/H exchangers. Therefore, induction of DNA synthesis and proto-oncogene expression occurs in Fu5 epithelial tumor cells in the absence of any short term increases of pHi or Ca2+i."
https://openalex.org/W1585554685,"The 39-kDa Ada protein that carries two distinct methyltransferase activities and an activity to promote transcription of the ada and alkA genes is cleaved to smaller polypeptides in the case of incubation with a crude extract of Escherichia coli. A protease that specifically cleaves the Ada protein was partially purified and characterized. The enzyme showed maximal activity at pH 7.8-8.0 and did not require specific ions or ATP for the reaction. The activity was inhibited by p-chloromercuribenzoic acid, thereby suggesting that it is a thiol protease. When a purified preparation of Ada protein was incubated with the protease preparation, definite sizes of cleavage products were formed; at the initial stage of proteolysis, the 20- and 19-kDa proteins were formed as the major products. When each of these products was purified by successive column chromatography, the 20-kDa protein was found to catalyze transfer of a methyl group from methylphosphotriester of methylated polynucleotides, whereas the 19-kDa protein transfers a methyl group from O6-methylguanine of methylated DNA to each of the molecules. Neither the 20- nor 19-kDa protein, even after methyl acceptance, exhibited an activity to promote transcription of the ada gene. However, alkA transcription was promoted by the 20-kDa protein provided that it was methylated."
https://openalex.org/W1608654525,"The high molecular weight aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complexes found in extracts of many eukaryotic cells often contain lipids and other non-protein components. Since hydrophobic interactions play an important role in maintaining synthetases in the complex, it has been suggested that the lipids present may also participate in its functional and structural integrity. In order to learn more about the role of lipids in the complex, we have compared the properties of the normal complex to one which has been delipidated by treatment with Triton X-114. Delipidation does not affect the size or activity of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex, but a variety of functional and structural properties of individual synthetases in the complex are altered dramatically. These include sensitivity to salts plus detergents, temperature inactivation, hydrophobicity, and sensitivity to protease digestion. In the latter case, removal of lipids also affects the low molecular weight products released by protease digestion. Purification of the synthetase complex by various chromatographic procedures can remove the lipids and lead to a structure that behaves like the delipidated complex prepared by detergent treatment. The significance of these findings for the intracellular location of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and for the study of purified complexes are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2171316443,"Metal ion interactions of the monofunctional partial complex of Salmonella typhimurium anthranilate synthase were investigated using kinetic, NMR, and EPR methods. Mn2+ activates AS-partial complex in place of Mg2+, with a Km of 0.08 microM for Mn2+ and of 3.5 microM for Mg2+ in glutamine-dependent anthranilate synthase activity. The kinetics indicated that the metal interacts at the active site with chorismate, not glutamine. EPR and NMR water proton relaxation rate (PRR) studies supported this conclusion. EPR binding analysis showed that chorismate dramatically tightens Mn2+ binding by the partial complex. PRR experiments indicated that stoichiometric amounts of chorismate cause a substantial decrease in the enhancement of water relaxation by Mn2+, while millimolar amounts of glutamine have no effect. Analysis of the frequency dependence of water proton relaxation rates yielded dipolar correlation times of 2.5 x 10(-9) s and 4.1 x 10(-9) s for the Mn2+-partial complex and Mn2+-partial complex-chorismate complexes, respectively. These studies also indicated that chorismate binding reduces the number of fast-exchanging water molecules on enzyme-bound Mn2+ from 1 to 0.25. PRR experiments with the native bifunctional anthranilate synthase-phosphoribosyltransferase enzyme indicated the existence of additional Mn2+-binding sites which presumably function to activate the phosphoribosyltransferase activity of the Component II subunit."
