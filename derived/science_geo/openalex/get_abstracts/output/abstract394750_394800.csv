https://openalex.org/W2058698962,"The control of quantum systems is of fundamental scientific interest and promises powerful applications and technologies. Impressive progress has been achieved in isolating the systems from the environment and coherently controlling their dynamics, as demonstrated by the creation and manipulation of entanglement in various physical systems. However, for open quantum systems, engineering the dynamics of many particles by a controlled coupling to an environment remains largely unexplored. Here we report the first realization of a toolbox for simulating an open quantum system with up to five qubits. Using a quantum computing architecture with trapped ions, we combine multi-qubit gates with optical pumping to implement coherent operations and dissipative processes. We illustrate this engineering by the dissipative preparation of entangled states, the simulation of coherent many-body spin interactions and the quantum non-demolition measurement of multi-qubit observables. By adding controlled dissipation to coherent operations, this work offers novel prospects for open-system quantum simulation and computation."
https://openalex.org/W2045465609,"Many successful vaccines induce persistent antibody responses that can last a lifetime. The mechanisms by which they do so remain unclear, but emerging evidence indicates that they activate dendritic cells via Toll-like receptors (TLRs). For example, the yellow fever vaccine YF-17D, one of the most successful empiric vaccines ever developed, activates dendritic cells via multiple TLRs to stimulate proinflammatory cytokines. Triggering specific combinations of TLRs in dendritic cells can induce synergistic production of cytokines, which results in enhanced T-cell responses, but its impact on antibody responses remain unknown. Learning the critical parameters of innate immunity that program such antibody responses remains a major challenge in vaccinology. Here we demonstrate that immunization of mice with synthetic nanoparticles containing antigens plus ligands that signal through TLR4 and TLR7 induces synergistic increases in antigen-specific, neutralizing antibodies compared to immunization with nanoparticles containing antigens plus a single TLR ligand. Consistent with this there was enhanced persistence of germinal centres and of plasma-cell responses, which persisted in the lymph nodes for >1.5 years. Surprisingly, there was no enhancement of the early short-lived plasma-cell response relative to that observed with single TLR ligands. Molecular profiling of activated B cells, isolated 7 days after immunization, indicated that there was early programming towards B-cell memory. Antibody responses were dependent on direct triggering of both TLRs on B cells and dendritic cells, as well as on T-cell help. Immunization protected completely against lethal avian and swine influenza virus strains in mice, and induced robust immunity against pandemic H1N1 influenza in rhesus macaques."
https://openalex.org/W2068480672,"Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) is known to broadly regulate the cellular stress response. In contrast, it is unclear if the PACAP-PAC1 receptor pathway has a role in human psychological stress responses, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Here we find, in heavily traumatized subjects, a sex-specific association of PACAP blood levels with fear physiology, PTSD diagnosis and symptoms in females. We examined 44 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning the PACAP (encoded by ADCYAP1) and PAC1 (encoded by ADCYAP1R1) genes, demonstrating a sex-specific association with PTSD. A single SNP in a putative oestrogen response element within ADCYAP1R1, rs2267735, predicts PTSD diagnosis and symptoms in females only. This SNP also associates with fear discrimination and with ADCYAP1R1 messenger RNA expression in human brain. Methylation of ADCYAP1R1 in peripheral blood is also associated with PTSD. Complementing these human data, ADCYAP1R1 mRNA is induced with fear conditioning or oestrogen replacement in rodent models. These data suggest that perturbations in the PACAP-PAC1 pathway are involved in abnormal stress responses underlying PTSD. These sex-specific effects may occur via oestrogen regulation of ADCYAP1R1. PACAP levels and ADCYAP1R1 SNPs may serve as useful biomarkers to further our mechanistic understanding of PTSD."
https://openalex.org/W1969186778,"It has recently been shown that neurons in the lateral habenula (LHb), a nucleus that projects to midbrain reward areas, can signal negative reward or 'disappointment' by modulating a dopaminergic centre, and may be disrupted in depressive disorders. Experiments in rats exhibiting learned helplessness (a model of major depression) now show that excitatory synapses onto LHb neurons are potentiated, and that this correlates with helplessness behaviour. Depleting transmitter release by repeated electrical stimulation of the LHb using a protocol similar to deep brain stimulation rescues both synaptic changes and learned helplessness behaviour. These results point to a mechanism by which deep brain stimulation in LHb could be effective in treating depression. It has recently been shown that neurons in the lateral habenula (LHb), a nucleus that projects to midbrain reward areas, can signal aversive outcomes and may be disrupted in depressive disorders. This study now shows that in rats exhibiting learned helplessness (a model of major depression) excitatory synapses onto LHb neurons are potentiated, and that this correlates with helplessness behaviour. Furthermore, depleting transmitter release by repeated electrical stimulation of LHb using a protocol similar to deep brain stimulation rescues both synaptic changes and learned helplessness behaviour. The cellular basis of depressive disorders is poorly understood1. Recent studies in monkeys indicate that neurons in the lateral habenula (LHb), a nucleus that mediates communication between forebrain and midbrain structures, can increase their activity when an animal fails to receive an expected positive reward or receives a stimulus that predicts aversive conditions (that is, disappointment or anticipation of a negative outcome)2,3,4. LHb neurons project to, and modulate, dopamine-rich regions, such as the ventral tegmental area (VTA)2,5, that control reward-seeking behaviour6 and participate in depressive disorders7. Here we show that in two learned helplessness models of depression, excitatory synapses onto LHb neurons projecting to the VTA are potentiated. Synaptic potentiation correlates with an animal’s helplessness behaviour and is due to an enhanced presynaptic release probability. Depleting transmitter release by repeated electrical stimulation of LHb afferents, using a protocol that can be effective for patients who are depressed8,9, markedly suppresses synaptic drive onto VTA-projecting LHb neurons in brain slices and can significantly reduce learned helplessness behaviour in rats. Our results indicate that increased presynaptic action onto LHb neurons contributes to the rodent learned helplessness model of depression."
https://openalex.org/W2070660722,"Double-strand breaks (DSBs) in heterochromatic repetitive DNAs pose significant threats to genome integrity, but information about how such lesions are processed and repaired is sparse. We observe dramatic expansion and dynamic protrusions of the heterochromatin domain in response to ionizing radiation (IR) in Drosophila cells. We also find that heterochromatic DSBs are repaired by homologous recombination (HR) but with striking differences from euchromatin. Proteins involved in early HR events (resection) are rapidly recruited to DSBs within heterochromatin. In contrast, Rad51, which mediates strand invasion, only associates with DSBs that relocalize outside of the domain. Heterochromatin expansion and relocalization of foci require checkpoint and resection proteins. Finally, the Smc5/6 complex is enriched in heterochromatin and is required to exclude Rad51 from the domain and prevent abnormal recombination. We propose that the spatial and temporal control of DSB repair in heterochromatin safeguards genome stability by preventing aberrant exchanges between repeats.

We propose that the spatial and temporal control of DSB repair in heterochromatin safeguards genome stability by preventing aberrant exchanges between repeats. DSB detection and processing occur very efficiently in heterochromatin after IR Heterochromatic DSBs move outside the expanding HP1a domain to complete HR repair HP1a expansion and DSB relocalization require checkpoint and resection proteins Smc5/6 prevent Rad51 foci formation and aberrant recombination within the HP1a domain Double-strand breaks (DSBs) are efficiently repaired by two major pathways, HR (homologous recombination) and NHEJ (nonhomologous end-joining). In HR repair, resection of DSBs generates single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) ends that invade homologous sequences, which serve as templates for DNA synthesis and repair. Repair of single-copy sequences through HR is normally error free because a unique homologous sequence is present on the donor sister chromatid or homolog. NHEJ, by contrast, is intrinsically mutagenic because it simply joins broken ends without restoring any missing sequence. Heterochromatin, a specialized domain enriched for highly repetitive sequences, represents a specific challenge for DSB repair. This cytologically distinct region of the nucleus comprises about 30% of fly and human genomes (Hoskins et al., 2007Hoskins R.A. Carlson J.W. Kennedy C. Acevedo D. Evans-Holm M. Frise E. Wan K.H.

FitzHugh W. et al.International Human Genome Sequencing ConsortiumInitial sequencing and analysis of the human genome.Nature. 2001; 409: 860-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (17710) Google Scholar). The large number of repeated sequences in heterochromatin and their close proximity within nuclei exacerbate the risk for genome rearrangements in the presence of DSBs, particularly during HR repair. Recombination among repetitive sequences results in loss or duplication of information (Peng and Karpen, 2008Peng J.C. Karpen G.H. Epigenetic regulation of heterochromatic DNA stability.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2008; 18: 204-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Recombination between identical repeats on nonhomologous chromosomes produces dicentric and acentric chromosomes that are known to contribute to human diseases such as cancer and infertility (Pearson et al., 2005Pearson C.E. Nichol Edamura K. Cleary J.D. Repeat instability: mechanisms of dynamic mutations.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2005; 6: 729-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). NHEJ repair of a DSB in repetitive DNA is potentially less problematic because small deletions or mutations do not affect the function of tandem repeats as severely as genes. Thus, two unresolved issues are whether DSBs in heterochromatin are repaired by NHEJ or HR and how repair occurs without threatening the stability of the genome. Heterochromatin in S. pombe, flies, and mammals is characterized by enrichment of specific histone modifications (e.g., H3K9me2 and H3K9me3) and associated proteins, such as heterochromatin protein 1a (HP1a) and the histone methyltransferase (HMTase) Su(var)3–9 (Grewal and Jia, 2007Grewal S.I. Jia S. Heterochromatin revisited.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2007; 8: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). Chromatin composition and regulation are integral to many aspects of the DSB response (Downs et al., 2007Downs J.A. Nussenzweig M.C. Nussenzweig A. Chromatin dynamics and the preservation of genetic information.Nature. 2007; 447: 951-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), and heterochromatin components and structure help to maintain repeat stability (Peng and Karpen, 2008Peng J.C. Karpen G.H. Epigenetic regulation of heterochromatic DNA stability.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2008; 18: 204-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). For example, the absence of Su(var)3–9 results in the accumulation of DSBs in heterochromatin, formation of extrachromosomal circular repeated DNAs, translocations, and loss of heterozygosity (Peng and Karpen, 2007Peng J.C. Karpen G.H. H3K9 methylation and RNA interference regulate nucleolar organization and repeated DNA stability.Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, Peng and Karpen, 2009Peng J.C. Karpen G.H. Heterochromatic genome stability requires regulators of histone H3 K9 methylation.PLoS Genet. 2009; 5: e1000435Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). How heterochromatin components promote genome stability and whether they regulate DSB repair have not been determined, but current evidence suggests three possible mechanisms. First, compaction or chromatin composition could make heterochromatin intrinsically less responsive to DSB formation or processing (Kim et al., 2007Kim J.-A. Kruhlak M. Dotiwala F. Nussenzweig A. Haber J.E. Heterochromatin is refractory to gamma-H2AX modification in yeast and mammals.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). DSBs produced by ionizing radiation (IR) in mammalian cells are detected at lower frequencies and are resolved with slower kinetics in heterochromatin (Cowell et al., 2007Cowell I.G. Sunter N.J. Singh P.B. Austin C.A. Durkacz B.W. Tilby M.J. gammaH2AX foci form preferentially in euchromatin after ionising-radiation.PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, Goodarzi et al., 2008Goodarzi A.A. Noon A.T. Deckbar D. Ziv Y. Shiloh Y. Löbrich M. Jeggo P.A. ATM signaling facilitates repair of DNA double-strand breaks associated with heterochromatin.Mol. Cell. 2008; 31: 167-177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar), and delocalization of HP1β and Kap1 (binding partner for HP1) seem to facilitate repair (Ayoub et al., 2008Ayoub N. Jeyasekharan A.D. Bernal J.A. Venkitaraman A.R. HP1-beta mobilization promotes chromatin changes that initiate the DNA damage response.Nature. 2008; 453: 682-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, Goodarzi et al., 2008Goodarzi A.A.

Cell. 2008; 31: 167-177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Second, heterochromatin components could repress HR and promote less-damaging repair processes, similar to suppression of reciprocal recombination in pericentric heterochromatin during meiosis, which requires heterochromatin components (Westphal and Reuter, 2002Westphal T. Reuter G. Recombinogenic effects of suppressors of position-effect variegation in Drosophila.Genetics. 2002; 160: 609-621PubMed Google Scholar). Third, HR repair could occur in heterochromatin, but aberrant recombination is prevented by specific mechanisms, as suggested by studies in S. cerevisiae (Torres-Rosell et al., 2007Torres-Rosell J. Sunjevaric I. De Piccoli G. Sacher M. Eckert-Boulet N. Reid R. Jentsch S. Rothstein R. Aragón L. Lisby M. The Smc5-Smc6 complex and SUMO modification of Rad52 regulates recombinational repair at the ribosomal gene locus.Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 923-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Here, we show that IR-induced DSBs are efficiently formed and processed in Drosophila heterochromatin and that their repair is, surprisingly, dependent on HR. We demonstrate that heterochromatin responds dynamically to IR: proteins involved in early stages of HR are quickly recruited to DSBs and promote expansion of the domain, and repair sites display a dramatic relocalization to outside heterochromatin, where they first recruit a protein (Rad51) required for strand invasion and completion of HR repair. In addition, we identify the Smc5/6 complex as a new heterochromatin component that serves as a key regulator of HR repair in time and space. These results provide new insights into the dynamics of heterochromatic DSB processing and repair and suggest a mechanism for limiting the risk associated with HR repair of repetitive sequences. In Drosophila, the DAPI-bright heterochromatin is organized as a distinct nuclear domain (Figure S1 available online) that is enriched for the canonical heterochromatin markers histone H3K9me2, H3K9me3, and HP1a (Eissenberg and Reuter, 2009Eissenberg J.C. Reuter G. Cellular mechanism for targeting heterochromatin formation in Drosophila.Int. Rev. Cell Mol. Biol. 2009; 273: 1-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In contrast, marks associated with gene expression (e.g., H3K4me2 and me3) are excluded from the heterochromatin domain. This striking three-dimensional (3D) separation is maintained throughout the cell cycle (Figures S1D and S1E). An early marker for DSB formation is a phosphoepitope that appears on histone variant H2Av (H2AX in mammals), which is catalyzed by the ATM and ATR checkpoint kinases and contributes to checkpoint signaling and repair (Downs et al., 2007Downs J.A. Nussenzweig M.C. Nussenzweig A. Chromatin dynamics and the preservation of genetic information.Nature. 2007; 447: 951-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Previous studies in mouse cells showed that γH2AX foci are mostly excluded from the heterochromatic chromocenters (DAPI-bright regions) at > 30 min after IR (Cowell et al., 2007Cowell I.G. Sunter N.J. Singh P.B. Austin C.A. Durkacz B.W. Tilby M.J. gammaH2AX foci form preferentially in euchromatin after ionising-radiation.PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), suggesting that DSBs are not formed or processed in heterochromatin. However, it is also possible that repair foci form in heterochromatin at earlier time points and are either quickly repaired or moved outside of the domain. Therefore, we performed a kinetic analysis of the DSB response in heterochromatin, using Kc tissue culture cells fixed at different time points after IR. TUNEL analysis reveals DNA damage in DAPI-bright in most cells at 10 min after IR (Figure S2A ), demonstrating that heterochromatin is not refractory to IR-induced damage. However, at 30 min after IR, only 10% of the cells display TUNEL signals in DAPI-bright, when they are still abundant in DAPI-weak regions. Immunofluorescence (IF) analysis and quantitation show that the frequencies of γH2Av and Rad51 (a marker of HR repair) foci peak at 30 min (γH2Av) or 60 min (Rad51) after IR in DAPI-weak euchromatin (Figures 1A and 1B ), as observed in mammalian cells (Costes et al., 2009Costes S.V. Chiolo I. Pluth J.M. Barcellos-Hoff M.H. Jakob B. Spatiotemporal characterization of ionizing radiation induced DNA damage foci and their relation to chromatin organization.Mutat. Res. 2009; 704: 78-87Crossref Scopus (160) Google Scholar). At later time points, foci frequencies steadily decrease (Figure 1B), which likely reflects ongoing repair. In contrast, the frequencies of γH2Av foci in DAPI-bright heterochromatin peak at 10 min after IR and then drop sharply (Figure 1B). Notably, Rad51 foci are rarely observed in DAPI-bright, whereas in DAPI-weak, about half of the γH2Av foci are associated with Rad51 foci (Figure 1B). Similar kinetics are observed in S2 cells (data not shown).Figure 1Processing of DSBs in Heterochromatin Occurs with Different Kinetics Than Euchromatin and Requires HRShow full caption(A) γH2Av, but not Rad51, foci form in DAPI-bright (dashed circles) after IR. IF with γH2Av or Rad51 antibodies shows γH2Av foci in DAPI-bright at 10 min and not at 60 min after IR. Rad51 foci are rare in DAPI-bright at both time points (see one example in Figure S2B).(B) IF was performed at different time points after IR as in (A), and quantitative analysis of foci was performed. In DAPI-weak, frequencies of γH2Av and Rad51 foci peak at 30 and 60 min after IR, respectively, and then show a slow decay. In DAPI-bright, rapid reduction of γH2Av foci is observed between 10 and 30 min after IR (p < 0.001; n > 60). No significant differences in the low numbers of Rad51 foci were observed in DAPI-bright throughout the time course (n > 100).(C) HR proteins are required for removal of γH2Av foci from heterochromatin. Quantitative kinetic analysis shows persistent γH2Av foci in DAPI-bright and DAPI-weak after Rad51 or Rad54 RNAi at 60 and 240 min after IR (p < 0.01; n > 100).

Graphs show mean ± SEM. Only Z-stacks including the DAPI-bright are shown as projections in (A) and (D). Scale bars, 1 μm. See also Figure S1 and Figure S2. We conclude that: (1) DSB formation and processing do occur in heterochromatin soon after damage is induced, (2) DSBs and γH2Av foci rapidly disappear from heterochromatin, suggesting that heterochromatic DSBs are either repaired quickly or relocate elsewhere for repair, and (3) Rad51 foci are rarely observed in heterochromatin throughout the time course. Repair by NHEJ would be consistent with the absence of Rad51 foci and the faster kinetics of DSB removal in the heterochromatin domain. To determine which repair pathway is involved, we analyzed the effect of NHEJ or HR inactivation on foci kinetics. Importantly, Kc cells are predominantly in S and G2 phases of the cell cycle (Figures S1A–S1D), when both pathways are functional (Huertas, 2010Huertas P. DNA resection in eukaryotes: deciding how to fix the break.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). In DAPI-weak regions, depleting proteins required for NHEJ (Ku70 and Ku80) or HR (Rad51 or Rad54) results in persistent γH2Av foci after IR (Figure 1C and Figure S2D), confirming the involvement of both pathways in repairing euchromatic DSBs in Kc cells. However, Ku70/80 depletion has no effect on γH2Av or Rad51 foci kinetics in DAPI-bright (Figure S2D), suggesting that NHEJ is not required for DSB repair in heterochromatin. In contrast, depletion of either Rad51 or Rad54 results in persistent γH2Av foci in DAPI-bright (Figure 1C and Figure S2E), reflecting unrepaired DSBs (γH2Av foci overlapping with TUNEL signals) (Figure S2E). We conclude that the fast disappearance of DSBs from Drosophila heterochromatin predominantly depends on the HR pathway. The requirement for HR is surprising, given the lack of Rad51 foci in heterochromatin. To determine whether HR steps that precede Rad51 loading occur in heterochromatin, we analyzed the kinetics of foci formation of ATRIP, which is recruited to RPA-covered resected DNA (Zou and Elledge, 2003Zou L. Elledge S.J. Sensing DNA damage through ATRIP recognition of RPA-ssDNA complexes.Science. 2003; 300: 1542-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (2045) Google Scholar). ATRIP and Rad51 kinetics are similar in DAPI-weak regions (compare Figure 1D to Figure 1B). In sharp contrast, ATRIP foci in DAPI-bright peak at 10 min after IR and then quickly disappear, similar to γH2Av foci (Figure 1D). We conclude that early steps in DSB processing for HR repair (resection and ATRIP loading) occur within heterochromatin, whereas later steps (assembly of Rad51 foci) are excluded from this domain. This separation of early and late HR events is not observed in euchromatin, in which ATRIP and Rad51 foci display similar kinetics. One reason why HR in heterochromatin is potentially dangerous is because of the close proximity of homologous sequences on different chromosomes. Therefore, we explored whether the organization of this domain changes in response to IR. Time-lapse studies of cells expressing mCherry-tagged HP1a (mCh-HP1a) show that the HP1a domain is compact and contiguous prior to IR treatment. However, soon after IR, this domain expands and becomes fragmented, with rapid extension and retraction of HP1a “fingers” (Figure 2A and Movie S1). HP1a domain volume increases within minutes after IR (Figure S3A ) and peaks at 20–40 min (1.5-fold compared to before IR) (Figure 2B and Figure S3A). This is followed by a partial contraction, which is maintained until at least 100 min after IR (Figure 2B and Figure S3B). Fixed cells display a similar increase in HP1a, H3K9me2, and DAPI-bright volumes after IR, with no increase in total nuclear volume (Figures S3C and S3D and data not shown). HP1a expansion was also observed after low dose radiation (1.67 Gy, data not shown; this dose is equivalent to 10cGy treatment of human cells).Figure S3Heterochromatin Expansion is an Early Response to IR, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Cells expressing mCh-HP1a were imaged before (Unt, time 0) and after IR.

(E) ChIP-array analysis of HP1a before (Unt), 30 min and 60 min after IR. The browser view of chromosome 2 and arm 3L shows the position of the euchromatin-heterochromatin border (red line); x axis = genome coordinates in Mbs. y axis = enrichment p values, normalized to input for each time point. Purple rectangle = region shown in Figure 2C. The increased volumes of HP1a and H3K9 methylation could result from spreading of heterochromatin into euchromatic regions in response to IR, as observed for chromosome rearrangements that juxtapose euchromatic and heterochromatic sequences (Eissenberg and Reuter, 2009Eissenberg J.C. Reuter G. Cellular mechanism for targeting heterochromatin formation in Drosophila.Int. Rev. Cell Mol. Biol. 2009; 273: 1-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the heterochromatic domain could physically expand, in which case HP1a would still be restricted to heterochromatic sequences. Genome-wide HP1a ChIP-array analysis shows that HP1a does not become enriched in the euchromatin after IR (Figure 2C and Figure S3E), demonstrating that the volume of the heterochromatin domain expands without spreading into euchromatic sequences. In addition, we used fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis to monitor the locations of the AACAC satellite sequences with respect to DAPI-bright before and after IR. Quantitative analysis demonstrates that these repeats localize predominantly within or close to DAPI-bright in untreated controls (Figure 2D and Figure S1F). However, the average distance between satellite signals and DAPI-bright increases significantly between 10 and 60 min after IR and then decreases by 3 hr (Figure 2D). We conclude that changes in the spatial distribution of heterochromatic repeated sequences occur in concert with the expansion and partial contraction of the HP1a domain. Relocalization of DSBs to outside of heterochromatin to complete HR repair provides one explanation for the fast disappearance of γH2Av and ATRIP foci, the exclusion of Rad51 foci from heterochromatin, and the requirement for HR repair. To test this hypothesis, we performed live studies of cells expressing fluorescent-tagged versions of HP1a and components of the DSB response. Mu2/Mdc1 recruitment to DSBs relies on direct interactions with γH2Av and is an excellent marker for the early response to DSBs (Dronamraju and Mason, 2009Dronamraju R. Mason J.M. Recognition of double strand breaks by a mutator protein (MU2) in Drosophila melanogaster.PLoS Genet. 2009; 5: e1000473Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To detect later steps in HR repair, we tracked proteins recruited to RPA-covered resected DNA (ATRIP and TopBP1) and Rad51, which promotes strand invasion (Su, 2006Su T.T. Cellular responses to DNA damage: one signal, multiple choices.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2006; 40: 187-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Time-lapse studies and 3D reconstructions of nuclei revealed that Mu2, ATRIP, and TopBP1 foci appear within the HP1a domain by 3 min after IR and then move to the HP1a periphery; by ∼30–40 min after IR, most foci are located at the HP1a periphery or outside of the domain (Figures 3A and 3C, Movie S2, Movie S3, Figures S4A–S4E, and Figure S5A). Interestingly, ATRIP and TopBP1 foci are more abundant and much brighter within the HP1a domain at early time points, compared to the euchromatin (Figure 3A and Figure S4B ). ATRIP foci dynamically join and split within the HP1a domain (Figure S5B and Movie S4) and often split into multiple foci when relocated outside of the HP1a domain (Figure 3C and Figure S5A). This suggests that the bright ATRIP and TopBP1 foci could result from early clustering of DSBs in heterochromatin, which separate after relocalization. Interestingly, assembly of ATRIP and TopBP1 foci occurs with kinetics similar to Mu2 foci in heterochromatin but is delayed outside of the HP1a domain (Figure 3A and Figures S4A and S4B), consistent with our observations in fixed cells. Thus, DSB recognition (Mu2 and γH2Av foci) occurs with the same kinetics in euchromatin and heterochromatin, whereas subsequent steps (resection or ATRIP/TopBP1 recruitment) are accelerated or enhanced in heterochromatin.Figure S4Mu2, TopBP1, and ATRIP Foci Form Rapidly within the HP1a Domain after IR, whereas Rad51 Foci Only Form at the Periphery of the HP1a Domain, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Mu2 and TopBP1 foci are formed within the HP1a domain and then relocalize to its periphery. Cells expressing GFP-Mu2 and mCh-HP1a, or mCh-TopBP1 and GFP-HP1a, were imaged before and at different time points after IR. Top: Foci were classified as ‘IN’ when completely included within the HP1a domain, ‘Periphery IN’ when located along the inside edge of the HP1a domain, and ‘Periphery OUT’ when outside the HP1a domain but touching its surface. ‘OUT’ primarily contains foci that were completely external to HP1a, but also includes relocalizing foci connected to the heterochromatin by faint HP1a protrusions/filaments; since these connections can be difficult to visualize in HP1a volume modeling, inclusion in the OUT category provides the most conservative approach, even if it includes some foci that belong in the ‘Periphery OUT’ class. Mu2 and TopBP1 foci form within the HP1a domain (IN) by 4 min and decrease > 10 min after IR, similar to the kinetics observed for ATRIP foci (Figure 3A). Then they accumulate at the periphery of the HP1a domain between 10 and 60 min after IR (p < 0.001, n = 30). In euchromatin (OUT), Mu2 foci form at very early time points, similar to γH2Av foci in fixed samples (Figure 1B), whereas TopBP1 foci appear later, similar to the dynamics of ATRIP foci (Figure 3A).(B) Images of cells expressing Mu2, TopBP1 or ATRIP at 6 min after IR show that Mu2 foci have similar intensity and uniform distribution in euchromatin and heterochromatin at early time points, whereas TopBP1 and ATRIP foci are much brighter and more abundant within the HP1a domain.(C) ATRIP foci are formed within the HP1"

Although full-length (flAcrp) adiponectin also suppresses LPS-induced pro-inflammatory signaling, its signaling mechanisms are not yet understood. The aim of this study was to examine the differential mechanisms by which gAcrp and flAcrp suppress pro-inflammatory signaling in macrophages. Chronic ethanol feeding increased LPS-stimulated TNF-α expression by Kupffer cells, associated with a shift to an M1 macrophage polarization.

Instead, flAcrp, acting via the adiponectin R2 receptor, potently shifted the polarization of Kupffer cells and RAW264.7 macrophages to an M2 phenotype. gAcrp, acting via the adiponectin R1 receptor, was much less effective at eliciting an M2 pattern of gene expression. M2 polarization was also partially dependent on AMP-activated kinase. flAcrp polarized RAW264.7 macrophages to an M2 phenotype in an IL-4/STAT6-dependent mechanism. flAcrp also increased the expression of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation in RAW264.7 macrophages, similar to the effect of flAcrp on hepatocytes.

Resident tissue macrophages exhibit a tremendous plasticity in their response to external stimuli. In particular, the local metabolic and immune microenvironment contributes to this plasticity (1Gordon S. Martinez F.O. Immunity. 2010; 32: 593-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2879) Google Scholar). In response to different stimuli, macrophages express distinct patterns of surface receptors and metabolic enzymes that ultimately generate the diversity of macrophage functions. Although the precise characterization of macrophage diversity is continuing to evolve, two distinct polarization states of macrophages, M1 and M2, have been characterized (1Gordon S. Martinez F.O. Immunity. 2010; 32: 593-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2879) Google Scholar, 2Stout R.D. Suttles J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2004; 76: 509-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). LPS and IFNγ can promote macrophage differentiation to a “classical” or M1 phenotype (1Gordon S. Martinez F.O. Immunity. 2010; 32: 593-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2879) Google Scholar). The M1 activation pattern is associated with tissue destruction and inflammation and is responsible for up-regulating pro-inflammatory cytokines and increasing production of reactive nitrogen species and reactive oxygen species (1Gordon S. Martinez F.O. Immunity. 2010; 32: 593-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2879) Google Scholar). In contrast, the “alternative” or M2 activation phenotype of macrophages is induced in response to IL-4 and IL-13. M2-polarized macrophages dampen the inflammatory process by producing anti-inflammatory factors, such as IL-10 and TGFβ. M2 macrophages also up-regulate mannose receptors, such as the macrophage mannose receptor (MMR) 2The abbreviations used are: MMR, macrophage mannose receptor; AMPK, AMP-activated kinase; flAcrp, full-length adiponectin; gAcrp, globular adiponectin; qRT, quantitative real time PCR; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; Arg-1, arginase-1. and mannose receptor, C type 2 (Mrc2c), IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA), and scavenger receptors, like cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36), as well as increased expression of arginase-1 (Arg-1). Arg-1 metabolizes arginine to ornithine and polyamines and thereby diminishes nitric oxide production (1Gordon S. Martinez F.O. Immunity. 2010; 32: 593-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2879) Google Scholar). The M2 phenotype is thought to promote tissue repair after inflammation and/or injury (1Gordon S. Martinez F.O. Immunity. 2010; 32: 593-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2879) Google Scholar). Macrophages play a central role in resistance against pathogens, tissue remodeling, repair, and resolution of inflammation. However, inappropriate regulation of macrophage function contributes to a variety of chronic inflammatory diseases, such as alcoholic and nonalcoholic liver disease (3Tilg H. Diehl A.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 343: 1467-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). Alcoholic liver disease is a complex process, progressing through several stages of tissue damage and liver dysfunction that are marked by pathological changes in the liver ranging from steatosis and hepatitis to cirrhosis. Chronic ethanol-induced inflammation in the liver is associated with increased sensitivity of Kupffer cells, the resident macrophage in the liver, to activation by TLR4 ligands or phagocytosis, leading to dysregulated expression of pro-inflammatory mediators (4McVicker B.L. Tuma D.J. Casey C.A. World J. Gastroenterol. 2007; 13: 4960-4966Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 5Nagy L.E. Exp. Biol. Med. 2003; 228: 882-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Activation of TLR4 by LPS and signaling via MyD88-dependent and -independent pathways contribute to chronic ethanol-induced liver injury (6Hritz I. Mandrekar P. Velayudham A. Catalano D. Dolganiuc A.

Immunol. 2008; 181: 3049-3056Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Activation of Kupffer cells in the liver during chronic ethanol exposure is likely due to increased exposure to endotoxins (7Rao R. Hepatology. 2009; 50: 638-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), as well as in response to hepatocellular injury (9Cohen J.I. Roychowdhury S. McMullen M.R. Stavitsky A.B. Nagy L.E. Gastroenterology. 2010; 139: 664-674.e1Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Although it is clear that increased sensitivity of Kupffer cells to activation is critical to the progression of ethanol-induced liver injury (10Thurman R.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G605-G611PubMed Google Scholar, 11Vidali M. Stewart S.F. Albano E. Trends Mol. Med. 2008; 14: 63-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), the mechanisms for sustained inflammatory responses in the liver during chronic ethanol exposure are not well understood but may involve both increased sensitivity to pro-inflammatory signals, as well as an impaired capacity to resolve the inflammatory response. The resolution of inflammation is a very active, highly coordinated response that is essential to sustain growth and survival in the face of infection and tissue damage (12Serhan C.N. Savill J. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 1191-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1836) Google Scholar). Recent evidence points to adipose tissue as a critical nexus in the regulation of immune responses (13Schäffler A. Schölmerich J. Trends Immunol. 2010; 31: 228-235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Adipose tissue not only provides an essential store of energetic substrates and inflammatory mediators to support an immune response but also promotes the termination of inflammation (13Schäffler A. Schölmerich J. Trends Immunol. 2010; 31: 228-235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Adiponectin (adiponectin is the generic name for all molecular forms of adiponectin), an abundant adipokine, has potent anti-inflammatory properties. Adiponectin reduces macrophage differentiation and migration (14Yokota T. Oritani K. Takahashi I. Ishikawa J. Matsuyama A. Ouchi N. Kihara S. Funahashi T. Tenner A.J. Tomiyama Y. Matsuzawa Y.

FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 6821-6826Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Adiponectin is present in the circulation as full-length adiponectin (flAcrp); flAcrp forms a number of oligomeric forms termed low molecular weight, middle molecular weight, and high molecular weight. Full-length adiponectin can be proteolytically cleaved to form globular adiponectin (gAcrp). Here, we will use the general term adiponectin to indicate all these different molecular forms and specify either the flAcrp or gAcrp forms when appropriate. Although many of these anti-inflammatory responses of adiponectin are mediated by both gAcrp and flAcrp (see for example Refs. 17Mandal P. Park P.H. McMullen M.R. Pratt B.T. Nagy L.E.

Recent studies have identified an IL-10/heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1)-dependent pathway that mediates the anti-inflammatory effects of gAcrp in murine macrophages (17Mandal P. Park P.H. McMullen M.R. Pratt B.T. Nagy L.E. Hepatology. 2010; 51: 1420-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 18Mandal P. Roychowdhury S. Park P.H. Pratt B.T. Roger T. Nagy L.E. J.

López-Ilasaca M. Libby P. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 25569-25575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Adiponectin also promotes macrophage polarization toward an anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype both in vivo and in cultured macrophages (22Fukushima J. Kamada Y. Matsumoto H. Yoshida Y. Ezaki H. Takemura T. Saji Y. Igura T. Tsutsui S. Kihara S. Funahashi T. Shimomura I. Tamura S. Kiso S. Hayashi N. Hepatol. Res. 2009; 39: 724-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 23Ohashi K.

Here, we have interrogated the mechanisms for adiponectin-mediated polarization of macrophages, and we report that flAcrp is a very potent inducer of M2 macrophage polarization, both in RAW264.7 macrophages and in primary cultures of rat Kupffer cells. In contrast, gAcrp was relatively ineffective at shifting macrophages to the M2 phenotype. flAcrp required adiponectin receptor 2 (AdipoR2) to effect macrophage polarization; this process was dependent on IL-4 and phosphorylation of STAT6.

Zinc protoporphyrin was purchased from Frontier Scientific, Inc. (Logan, UT). All procedures involving animals were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Cleveland Clinic. Chronic ethanol feeding to rats, as well as the isolation and culture of Kupffer cells, were performed as described previously (25Thakur V. Pritchard M.T. McMullen M.R. Nagy L.E. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest Liver Physiol. 2006; 290: G998-G1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Briefly, rats were allowed free access to the Lieber-Decarli high fat complete liquid diet for 2 days and then randomly assigned to pair-fed or ethanol-fed groups. Ethanol-fed rats were allowed free access to a liquid diet containing 17% of the calories (3.3% v/v) from ethanol for 2 days and then a liquid diet containing 35% of the calories (6.6% v/v) from ethanol for 4 weeks. Control rats were pair-fed a liquid diet in which maltose dextrins were substituted isocalorically for ethanol over the entire feeding period. Kupffer cells were isolated and cultured, as described previously (25Thakur V. Pritchard M.T. McMullen M.R. Nagy L.E. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest Liver Physiol. 2006; 290: G998-G1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). For experiments measuring IL-4 protein, Kupffer cells were isolated from chow-fed control rats. Briefly, isolated Kupffer cells were suspended in Connaught Media Research Laboratory (CMRL)-1066 media with 10% FBS, l-glutamine, and antibiotic/antimycotic (CMRL-FBS) at a concentration of 2 × 106 cells/ml. Cell suspensions were immediately plated onto 96-well (0.2 × 106 cells/well for analysis of mRNA) or 24-well (1.5 × 106 cells/well for flow cytometry and Western blot analysis) culture plates. One hour after plating the isolated Kupffer cells, nonadherent cells were removed by aspiration, and fresh media with or without gAcrp or flAcrp were added. After 18 h in culture, cells were treated with or without 100 ng/ml LPS, as indicated in the figure legends. Freshly isolated Kupffer cells were transfected using the Amaxa mouse macrophage Nucleofector kit according to the instructions of the manufacturer using the Y-001 program (Lonza, Cologne, Germany), except for the following modifications. Samples were processed individually, and the entire nucleofection procedure for each sample was completed in less than 5 min. For each nucleofection sample, 2 × 106 Kupffer cells were centrifuged for 10 min at 300 × g. The pellet was washed with 1 ml of PBS, collected at 300 × g for 5 min, and then resuspended in 105 μl of mouse macrophage nucleofector solution and transferred to a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube for a final concentration of ∼2 × 106 cells/100 μl. Cells were then treated or not with 2.0 μg of specific or scrambled siRNA (siRNA sequences are provided in supplemental Table 2), transferred into the electroporation cuvette, and placed in the Nucleofector device. After nucleofection, cells were immediately removed from the cuvette and plated in a 96-well plate (150 μl/well) at 0.5 × 106 cells/well. After 4 h, the cell culture medium was replaced with fresh medium either with or without 45 nm gAcrp or 45 nm flAcrp for 18 h and then treated with or without LPS, as described in the figure legends. The murine RAW264.7 macrophage-like cell line was routinely cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2. For siRNA knockdown experiments, RAW264.7 cells were transfected using the Amaxa Nucleofector apparatus (Lonza, Cologne, Germany). Briefly, 2 × 106 cells were resuspended in 105 μl of nucleofector solution and were nucleofected with 100 nm of specific or scrambled siRNA in the Nucleofector device using the D-032 program, according to the instructions of the manufacturer. After nucleofection, 500 μl of pre-warmed DMEM was added to the transfection mixture, and cells were transferred to 12-well plates containing 1.5 ml of pre-warmed DMEM per well. Transfected cells were seeded at 10.2 × 104/cm2 in 96-well plates and cultured for 24 h prior to experimental treatments. Validated Silencer Select siRNA pre-designed sequences were purchased from Ambion/Applied Biosystems. Efficiency of knockdown was determined by Western blot analysis and quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) (supplemental Fig. 1). Total RNA was isolated and reverse-transcribed, and qRT-PCR amplification was performed. The relative amount of target mRNA was determined using the comparative threshold (Ct) method by normalizing target mRNA Ct values to those of 18 S. RNA was isolated from Kupffer cells and RAW264.7 macrophages using the RNeasy micro kit (Qiagen), with on-column DNA digestion using the RNase-free DNase set (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA (200–300 ng) was reverse-transcribed using the RETROscript kit (Ambion/Applied Biosystems) with random decamers as primers. qRT-PCR amplification was performed in an Mx3000p (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using SYBR Green PCR core reagents (Applied Biosystems; Warrington, UK). All primers used for qRT-PCR analysis were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Statistical analysis of qRT-PCR data was performed using ΔCt values. Details of the primer sequences are provided in supplemental Table 1. After experimental treatments, Kupffer cells or RAW264.7 macrophages were washed by cold PBS and lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer containing 100 μm sodium orthovanadate. Total cellular extracts (20 μg) were separated in a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto PVDF membranes. Membranes were first probed with either phospho-specific STAT3 or STAT6 antibody, followed by secondary antibody conjugated with HRP and then visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were then stripped and reprobed with antibody against total STAT3, STAT6, or HSC70 as a loading control. Signal intensities were quantified by densitometry using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda). After 18 h of culture with or without gAcrp, RAW264.7 cells were gently scraped and adjusted to 1 × 106 cells/ml with culture media. Cells were greater than 90% viable as determined by trypan blue exclusion. The cells were centrifuged at 100 × g for 10 min. The pellet was washed with PBS and resuspended in 100 μl of PBS with 0.1% sodium azide and then blocked with 1.0 μg of anti-mouse CD32/CD16 Fcγ receptor blocking antibody for 15 min at 4 °C. Cells were then stained with 0.5 μg of phycoerythrin-conjugated CD206 or isotype control (phycoerythrin-conjugated IgG1) diluted in PBS containing 0.1% sodium azide for 30 min. Cells were washed twice with PBS, resuspended in 0.5 ml of wash buffer (final concentration ∼106 cells in 0.5 ml), and kept on ice until flow cytometric measurements were performed on a FACScan flow cytometer (Immunocytometry Systems, Mountain View, CA). Data were acquired and processed using FlowJo software (BD Biosciences). Because of the limited number of Kupffer cells available from each animal, data from several feeding trials are presented in this study. All values are reported as means ± S.E. Data were analyzed by general linear models procedure (SAS; Carey, NC). Data were log transformed, if needed, to obtain a normal distribution. Follow-up comparisons were made by least square means testing. Chronic ethanol exposure sensitizes Kupffer cells to stimulation with LPS (Fig. 1). Treatment of Kupffer cells from ethanol-fed rats with 45 nm gAcrp normalizes TLR4-dependent cytokine expression via both MyD88-dependent and -independent pathways via an IL-10/HO-1 dependent pathway (Fig. 1) (17Mandal P. Park P.H. McMullen M.R. Pratt B.T. Nagy L.E. Hepatology. 2010; 51: 1420-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 18Mandal P. Roychowdhury S. Park P.H. Pratt B.T. Roger T. Nagy L.E. J. Immunol. 2010; 185: 4928-4937Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Treatment of Kupffer cells with 45 nm flAcrp also reduced LPS-stimulated TNF-α expression (Fig. 1). This concentration of flAcrp (45 nm or 10 μg/ml) maximally suppresses LPS-stimulated TNF-α mRNA expression in Kupffer cells (25Thakur V. Pritchard M.T. McMullen M.R. Nagy L.E. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest Liver Physiol. 2006; 290: G998-G1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, this response was not attenuated by siRNA knockdown of IL-10 expression, compared with Kupffer cells that were not transfected or transfected with scrambled siRNA (Fig. 1). To delineate more precisely the differential molecular mechanisms for the anti-inflammatory effects of gAcrp and flAcrp, studies were conducted in the macrophage-like cell line, RAW264.7. gAcrp suppresses both TLR4-MyD88-dependent and -independent signaling in RAW264.7 macrophages via an IL-10/HO-1 pathway (18Mandal P. Roychowdhury S. Park P.H. Pratt B.T. Roger T. Nagy L.E. J. Immunol. 2010; 185: 4928-4937Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Culture of RAW264.7 macrophages with flAcrp for 18 h also decreased LPS-stimulated expression of MyD88-signature cytokines, TNF-α and IL-6 (Fig. 2, A and C), as well as MyD88-independent signature cytokines/chemokines, IFNβ and chemokine (CXC motif) ligand 10 (CXCL10) (Fig. 2, B and D). Both gAcrp and flAcrp increased expression of HO-1 mRNA and protein in RAW264.7 macrophages (supplemental Fig. 2). Although the anti-inflammatory effects of gAcrp are completely dependent on HO-1 expression (17Mandal P. Park P.H. McMullen M.R. Pratt B.T. Nagy L.E. Hepatology. 2010; 51: 1420-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 18Mandal P. Roychowdhury S. Park P.H. Pratt B.T. Roger T. Nagy L.E. J. Immunol. 2010; 185: 4928-4937Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), inhibition of HO-1, either with the use of a zinc protoporphyrin (Fig. 2, A and B), a chemical inhibitor of HO-1 activity, or by siRNA knockdown of HO-1 expression (Fig. 2, C and D), only partially prevented the anti-inflammatory effects of flAcrp on expression of both MyD88-dependent and -independent cytokine signatures (Fig. 2). Taken together, these data suggest that, in contrast to gAcrp, the anti-inflammatory effects of flAcrp were independent of IL-10 and only partially dependent on HO-1 (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2). Macrophage polarization between M1 and M2 phenotypes is an important mechanism for the regulation of inflammatory responses. Kupffer cells isolated from ethanol-fed rats exhibited a more predominant M1 polarization, characterized by increased expression of inducible NOS, an M1 marker, and decreased expression of M2 markers, including Arg-1, IL-4Rα, and MMR compared with Kupffer cells from pair-fed controls (Fig. 3A). This polarization is consistent with increased production of inflammatory cytokines typically observed after chronic ethanol exposure (Fig. 1) (5Nagy L.E. Exp. Biol. Med. 2003; 228: 882-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Because alternative macrophage polarization is dependent on IL-4- and/or IL-13-mediated signaling pathways (26Gordon S. Taylor P.R. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 953-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (3878) Google Scholar), rather than IL-10, we hypothesized that flAcrp may act to desensitize Kupffer cells to LPS (Fig. 1) by differentially polarizing Kupffer cells to an M2 phenotype. Treatment of Kupffer cells with 45 nm flAcrp strongly increased the expression of markers of M2 polarization, including Arg-1, MMR, and IL-4Rα (Fig. 3B). This effect of flAcrp was more potent in Kupffer cells from ethanol-fed rats compared with pair-fed controls (Fig. 3B), consistent with previous data indicating that, after ethanol feeding, Kupffer cells are more sensitive to the anti-inflammatory effects of adiponectin compared with cells from pair-fed controls (25Thakur V. Pritchard M.T. McMullen M.R. Nagy L.E. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest Liver Physiol. 2006; 290: G998-G1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In contrast, gAcrp had minimal effects on the expression of M2 markers (Fig. 3B). Neither gAcrp nor flAcrp decreased the expression of inducible NOS under these conditions (Fig. 3B). RAW264.7 macrophages were cultured with 4.5 or 45 nm gAcrp and flAcrp. These concentrations were chosen based on the relative affinity of gAcrp for AdipoR1 and flAcrp for AdipoR2; gAcrp binds AdipoR1 with 1.14 nm affinity, and flAcrp binds AdipoR2 with 49 nm affinity (27Yamauchi T. Kamon J. Ito Y. Tsuchida A. Yokomizo T. Kita S. Sugiyama T. Miyagishi M. Hara K. Tsunoda M. Murakami K. Ohteki T. Uchida S. Takekawa S. Waki H. Tsuno N.H. Shibata Y. Terauchi Y. Froguel P. Tobe K. Koyasu S. Taira K. Kitamura T. Shimizu T. Nagai R. Kadowaki T. Nature. 2003; 423: 762-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (2664) Google Scholar). Although gAcrp had a modest effect on shifting the gene expression profiles of RAW264.7 macrophages to an M2 signature, flAcrp dose-dependently shifted RAW264.7 macrophages to an M2 phenotype (Fig. 4). flAcrp potently increased the expression of multiple markers of M2 macrophages, including Arg-1, scavenger receptors (CD36), surface lectins (macrophage galactose N-acetylgalactosamine-specific lectins 1 and 2 (Mgl1 and Mgl2)), secreted lectins (chitinase-3-like 3 (Chi3l3 or YM-1)), and cytokine receptors (IL-4 receptor α (IL-4Rα)) (Fig. 4). Surface expression of CD206, a marker for M2 macrophages, was increased to a greater extent by flAcrp comp"

Gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, expel toxic chemicals through tripartite efflux pumps that span both the inner and outer membrane. The three parts are an inner membrane, substrate-binding transporter; a membrane fusion protein; and an outer-membrane-anchored channel. The fusion protein connects the transporter to the channel within the periplasmic space. A crystallographic model of this tripartite efflux complex has been unavailable because co-crystallization of the various components of the system has proven to be extremely difficult. We previously described the crystal structures of both the inner membrane transporter CusA1 and the membrane fusion protein CusB2 of the CusCBA efflux system3,4 of E. coli. Here we report the co-crystal structure of the CusBA efflux complex, showing that the transporter (or pump) CusA, which is present as a trimer, interacts with six CusB protomers and that the periplasmic domain of CusA is involved in these interactions. The six CusB molecules seem to form a continuous channel. The affinity of the CusA and CusB interaction was found to be in the micromolar range. Finally, we have predicted a three-dimensional structure for the trimeric CusC outer membrane channel and developed a model of the tripartite efflux assemblage. This CusC3–CusB6–CusA3 model shows a 750-kilodalton efflux complex that spans the entire bacterial cell envelope and exports Cu i and Ag i ions."

We took advantage of two locally camouflaged populations of Peromyscus mice to show that the negative regulator of adult pigmentation, Agouti, also plays a key developmental role in color pattern evolution. Genetic and functional analyses showed that ventral-specific embryonic expression of Agouti establishes a prepattern by delaying the terminal differentiation of ventral melanocytes. Moreover, a skin-specific increase in both the level and spatial domain of Agouti expression prevents melanocyte maturation in a regionalized manner, resulting in a novel and adaptive color pattern. Thus, natural selection favors late-acting, tissue-specific changes in embryonic Agouti expression to produce large changes in adult color pattern."
https://openalex.org/W2000198750,"Nitro-fatty acids (NO(2)-FAs) are electrophilic signaling mediators formed in vivo via nitric oxide (NO)- and nitrite (NO(2)(-))-dependent reactions. Nitro-fatty acids modulate signaling cascades via reversible covalent post-translational modification of nucleophilic amino acids in regulatory proteins and enzymes, thus altering downstream signaling events, such as Keap1-Nrf2-antioxidant response element (ARE)-regulated gene expression. In this study, we investigate the molecular mechanisms by which 9- and 10-nitro-octadec-9-enoic acid (OA-NO(2)) activate the transcription factor Nrf2, focusing on the post-translational modifications of cysteines in the Nrf2 inhibitor Keap1 by nitroalkylation and its downstream responses. Of the two regioisomers, 9-nitro-octadec-9-enoic acid was a more potent ARE inducer than 10-nitro-octadec-9-enoic acid. The most OA-NO(2)-reactive Cys residues in Keap1 were Cys(38), Cys(226), Cys(257), Cys(273), Cys(288), and Cys(489). Of these, Cys(273) and Cys(288) accounted for ∼50% of OA-NO(2) reactions in a cellular milieu. Notably, Cys(151) was among the least OA-NO(2)-reactive of the Keap1 Cys residues, with mutation of Cys(151) having no effect on net OA-NO(2) reaction with Keap1 or on ARE activation. Unlike many other Nrf2-activating electrophiles, OA-NO(2) enhanced rather than diminished the binding between Keap1 and the Cul3 subunit of the E3 ligase for Nrf2. OA-NO(2) can therefore be categorized as a Cys(151)-independent Nrf2 activator, which in turn can influence the pattern of gene expression and therapeutic actions of nitroalkenes."
https://openalex.org/W2102988039,"Head-on encounters between the replication and transcription machineries on the lagging DNA strand can lead to replication fork arrest and genomic instability. To avoid head-on encounters, most genes, especially essential and highly transcribed genes, are encoded on the leading strand such that transcription and replication are co-directional. Virtually all bacteria have the highly expressed ribosomal RNA genes co-directional with replication. In bacteria, co-directional encounters seem inevitable because the rate of replication is about 10-20-fold greater than the rate of transcription. However, these encounters are generally thought to be benign. Biochemical analyses indicate that head-on encounters are more deleterious than co-directional encounters and that in both situations, replication resumes without the need for any auxiliary restart proteins, at least in vitro. Here we show that in vivo, co-directional transcription can disrupt replication, leading to the involvement of replication restart proteins. We found that highly transcribed rRNA genes are hotspots for co-directional conflicts between replication and transcription in rapidly growing Bacillus subtilis cells. We observed a transcription-dependent increase in association of the replicative helicase and replication restart proteins where head-on and co-directional conflicts occur. Our results indicate that there are co-directional conflicts between replication and transcription in vivo. Furthermore, in contrast to the findings in vitro, the replication restart machinery is involved in vivo in resolving potentially deleterious encounters due to head-on and co-directional conflicts. These conflicts probably occur in many organisms and at many chromosomal locations and help to explain the presence of important auxiliary proteins involved in replication restart and in helping to clear a path along the DNA for the replisome."

The modest structure of the Vpr protein, three α-helices flanked by two flexible regions, belies its numerous roles in the virus life cycle and its effects on infected host cells (5Morellet N.

Vpr has been found to hijack various cellular pathways thought to be independent of one another, such as G2 cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, nuclear import, retrotranscription, the integration of the provirus in the nucleus, and transactivation of HIV-1 long terminal repeats (1Andersen J.L.

Vpr has been detected in the sera and cerebrospinal fluids of AIDS patients (8Xiao Y. Chen G. Richard J. Rougeau N. Li H. Seidah N.G. Cohen E.A.

Front Biosci. 2000; 5: D905-D916Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of Vpr-caused cell cycle arrest, different mechanisms have been proposed for its mode of action, yet to date the exact mechanisms are still unknown. For example, the Vpr-DCAF1-DDB1 (DCAF1 is also termed VprBP, binding protein) ternary complex was said to trigger G2 cell cycle arrest (15Belzile J.P. Duisit G. Rougeau N. Mercier J. Finzi A. Cohen E.A. PLoS Pathog. 2007; 3: e85Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). It was recently demonstrated that Vpr is able to form a mobile chromatin-associated nuclear focus containing VprBP, suggesting that Vpr recruits the VprBP-DDB1 complex within mobile nuclear structures to target a chromatin-bound substrate whose ubiquitination and proteolysis activate the ataxia telangiectasia-mutated and Rad3-related-mediated G2/M checkpoint and induce G2 arrest (16Belzile J.P.

Virol. 2010; 84: 3320-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, another report showed that Vpr triggers activation of Chk1 (a cell cycle checkpoint control kinase) through Ser345 phosphorylation in an S phase-dependent manner, subsequently leading to G2 arrest (18Li G. Park H.U. Liang D. Zhao R.Y. Retrovirology. 2010; 7: 59Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These two examples, along with others (6Morellet N. Roques B.P. Bouaziz S. Curr. HIV.

Neuroimmune Pharmacol. 2011; Google Scholar), illustrate more than one potential cell cycle arrest mechanism for Vpr. To complicate matters, Vpr has also been shown to bind to nucleic acids, implying its regulatory role in viral and cellular transcription machineries (20Amini S. Saunders M. Kelley K. Khalili K. Sawaya B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46046-46056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 21Zhang S. Pointer D. Singer G. Feng Y. Park K. Zhao L.J. Gene. 1998; 212: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Despite extensive research into the biology of Vpr, to date only two small molecule inhibitors of Vpr derived from natural compounds have been reported. Our group first reported that fumagillin (1) (22Watanabe N. Nishihara Y. Yamaguchi T. Koito A. Miyoshi H. Kakeya H. Osada H. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 2598-2602Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), isolated from fungal metabolites, was able to inhibit cell cycle arrest activity of Vpr in both yeast and mammalian cells, and in the same year, another group reported that damnacanthal (2) (23Kamata M. Wu R.P. An D.S. Saxe J.P. Damoiseaux R. Phelps M.E. Huang J. Chen I.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 348: 1101-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), a component of noni, is a specific inhibitor of Vpr-associated cell death with no effect on cell cycle arrest. Although extensive efforts have been channeled toward the understanding of the molecular and structural biology of the HIV-1 Vpr, the lack of a crystal structure for this protein frustrates our attempts to further understand it. Increasing evidence has suggested that Vpr and other HIV accessory proteins are promising drug targets for a comprehensive AIDS therapy (24Richter S.N. Frasson I. Palù G. Curr. Med. Chem. 2009; 16: 267-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Thus, small-molecule inhibitors can act as potential lead compounds for the development of effective inhibitors and also as bioprobes (also called chemical probes) to study Vpr. In view of this, our aims were to first develop a screening system to interrogate chemical libraries in the RIKEN NPDepo (25Tomiki T. Saito T. Ueki M. Konno H. Asaoka T. Suzuki R. Uramoto M. Kakeya H. Osada H. J. Comp. Aid. Chem. 2006; 7: 157-162Crossref Google Scholar), an annotated library of microbial secondary metabolites, for Vpr inhibitors and then use the identified small molecule inhibitors to investigate Vpr. Through this, we identified an inhibitor with a 3-phenyl coumarin scaffold, and noting the relatively weak potency and solubility of the hit molecule, employed further chemistry for structural optimization as well as structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies. The hit and derivatives were then used on a panel of single point alanine mutants of Vpr to identify residues with which it may interact. We also prepared small molecule-immobilized beads for use in pull-down assays to confirm Vpr-inhibitor binding. To our knowledge, this is the first report to show Vpr-inhibitor interaction on the amino acid level. Construction of the wild-type and mutant Vpr expression plasmids, the yeast strain (MLC30), and culture conditions for the expression of Vpr used in this study were as described previously (22Watanabe N. Nishihara Y. Yamaguchi T. Koito A. Miyoshi H. Kakeya H. Osada H. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 2598-2602Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). All proteins were FLAG-tagged at the N-terminal for immunodetection in a Western blot analysis. Oligonucleotide sequences to induce alanine mutations in Vpr are available upon request. Standard molecular biology methods were used. The 96-well plate format HTS assays were performed using a modification of the described protocols. Briefly, 99 μl of yeast cells (A620 = 0.05) in inducing medium (synthetic dextrose growth medium without leucine and uracil, with 0.5 mm copper sulfate) were pipetted into each well, along with 1 μl of compounds from NPDepo (each at final concentrations of 33, 11, 3.7 and 1.2 μg/ml), fumagillin (22 μg/ml), or DMSO. Duplicate plates were incubated at 30 °C, and spectrophotometric readings were recorded with a multilabel counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 0, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h. The automated work station Biomek 2000 was used for all liquid handling. For the HTS parameters, see the supplemental “Experimental Procedures”. Secondary confirmatory assays were also performed on 96-well plates and included visual inspection under a low-power microscope (Olympus) at 0 and 48 h to identify optical interfering compounds. For the tertiary screen, cells were grown in inducing medium with compounds or DMSO at 30 °C with shaking (150 rpm) in a 50-ml conical tube (Iwaki). Cells were harvested at 36 h for SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses. The synthesis and characterization of the 3-phenyl coumarin compounds (3-10) are described in the supplemental “Experimental Procedures”. Similar to the primary HTS screen, 1 μl of compounds (3-10) (final concentration, 5–100 μm) or DMSO was added to 99 μl of yeast cells in each well of a 96-well plate in duplicate. Spectrophotometric readings were taken at 0, 12, 24, and 36 h. Paper disc assays were performed as described previously (22Watanabe N. Nishihara Y. Yamaguchi T. Koito A. Miyoshi H. Kakeya H. Osada H. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 2598-2602Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Cells were prepared similar to the HTS screen. Wild-type and mutant Vpr-expressing yeast strains were grown, washed, and recalibrated in inducing media before being dispensed into 96-well plates. 1 μl of compound at the optimum inhibitory concentration was added to each well containing 99 μl of yeast culture (final concentrations are 3, 100 μm; 5, 25 μm; and 9, 10 μm). Spectrophotometric readings were taken at 0, 12, 24, and 36 h. Beads containing immobilized 3 and vipirinin were prepared as described (26Kanoh N. Honda K. Simizu S. Muroi M. Osada H. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2005; 44: 3559-3562Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Yeast cells expressing Vpr were grown overnight in 50 ml inducing medium (30 °C, 150 rpm) to an A600 of 1.5. Cells were harvested and resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold lysis/binding buffer (200 mm sorbitol, 50 mm potassium acetate, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 2 mm EDTA, 0.05% Tween 20) with protease inhibitors (Roche). An equal volume of acid-washed glass beads (Sigma) was added to each tube. The tubes were vortexed at top speed for 30 s and cooled on ice for 30 s. This cycle was repeated for a total of 10 min. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation twice at top speed for 15 min (4 °C). The total cell lysate was assayed (Pierce BCA protein assay kit), and 2 μg (in 500 μl of binding buffer) of Vpr-containing lysate was incubated with 10 μl of beads at room temperature for 8 h. The beads were washed twice with 500 μl of washing buffer (binding buffer containing 0.1% Tween 20), and the bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer followed by electrophoresis in 12% denaturing gels and detection by Western blotting. Human cell culture, the preparation of virus, and immunological techniques for the infectivity assays used in this study were used as described previously (22Watanabe N. Nishihara Y. Yamaguchi T. Koito A. Miyoshi H. Kakeya H. Osada H. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 2598-2602Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We described previously a yeast-based screening system for Vpr inhibitors using paper discs containing fungal metabolites on agar plates and have identified 1 as a potent inhibitor of Vpr. We found that compound 1 was able to reverse the cell cycle arrest of Vpr in yeast and human cells and suppress HIV-1 replication in human macrophages (22Watanabe N. Nishihara Y. Yamaguchi T. Koito A. Miyoshi H. Kakeya H. Osada H. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 2598-2602Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Here, we developed a faster, quantifiable primary high-throughput screening (HTS) system to facilitate the screening of a library of compounds in the RIKEN NPDepo for Vpr inhibitors. For expediency, we screened compounds on 96-well plates using optical density as an index of growth recovery, as described for yeasts (27Toussaint M. Conconi A. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 1922-1928Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Growth of Vpr-expressing yeast in the presence or absence of small molecules was measured spectrophotometrically and plotted as percentage growth (with the growth recovery of yeast in the presence of 1, our positive control in the screen, expressed as 100%). The screening library was provided in 96-well plates at the stock concentration of 10 mg/ml (in DMSO), and it was serially diluted to 3.3, 1.1, 0.37, and 0.12 mg/ml. We screened 6664 small molecules at these four concentrations in duplicate plates by adding 1 μl of each to 99 μl of Vpr-expressing yeast (to final concentrations of compounds of 33, 11, 3.7, and 1.2 μg/ml, respectively). The screening process is summarized in Fig. 1A. Hits from each plate were identified by comparing the growth of yeasts at 48 h to that of yeasts incubated with compound 1, our positive control, which was set at 100% (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. S1). All 212 compounds from the primary HTS that fell within the “hit zone” from the primary HTS were cherry-picked for a confirmatory secondary screening. This screening included visual inspections under a low-power microscope to detect false positives caused by optical interference (because of insoluble compounds or aggregated cells). Thirty-two positive hits from the secondary screen were then tested for their reproducibility in a 5 ml of shaking culture and analyzed by Western blotting for their effects on Vpr expression from the expression plasmid. From these tests, we selected compounds that inhibited the growth-suppressing effect of Vpr in yeast without any noticeable reduction of Vpr expression. As an example of a false-positive hit, DAPI induced yeast growth recovery in the primary and secondary screenings; however, this compound is a DNA intercalating agent that has been reported to inhibit plasmid expression in Escherichia coli (28Parolin C. Montecucco A. Ciarrocchi G. Pedrali-Noy G. Valisena S. Palumbo M. Palu G. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1990; 56: 341-346PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, we found that DAPI inhibited the expression of Vpr, resulting in false-positive growth of yeast cells (Fig. 1D). Following this rigorous tri-level screen, we identified a 3-phenyl coumarin Vpr inhibitor, Natural Product Derivative 4456 (3) (Fig. 1E). To improve the potency of hit compound 3, we synthesized a series of structural derivatives (4–10) (Fig. 2), maintaining the 3-phenyl coumarin scaffold both for structural optimization and to explore its SAR. Hit compound 3 was also resynthesized and purified by HPLC to validate the source compound from the RIKEN NPDepo. The derivatives were tested using a paper disc assay (supplemental Fig. S2), and the potency of each active derivative was accurately determined in a 96-well plate dose-response format. Initially, we found that removal of the 5-methoxy moiety from the 3-phenyl ring of 3, which resulted in 4, completely abolished its Vpr inhibitory activity. In contrast, elimination of the methoxy group from position 2 (5) enhanced Vpr inhibitory potency 4-fold (Fig. 3). Henceforth, subsequent derivatives were without the 2-methoxy moiety. Although we thought that fluorination of the methoxy moiety of 5 might improve its bioavailability (29Leroux F.R. Manteau B. Vors J.P. Pazenok S. Beilstein J. Org. Chem. 2008; 4: 13Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), the substitution was not tolerated, and this resulted in a null derivative (6). To determine the functionality of the amino moiety of 3 and to assess whether the carbamate moiety is also necessary for activity, we substituted the amide nitrogen with a carbon, resulting in a dimethylpropanoate group (7). This resulted in the complete loss of Vpr inhibitory activity, clearly demonstrating the importance of the carbamoyl moiety. We therefore replaced this group with the cyclic carbamates derived from piperidine and morpholine (8 and 9), and found that the potency of these derivatives was 10-fold higher than that of 3 (Fig. 3). However, a methylpiperazine surrogate (10) resulted in a potency that is similar to that of 3. As 9 was more potent than 8 at the lowest concentration and did not aggregate in solution at higher concentrations, compound 9, which we named vipirinin, was selected for use in subsequent analyses. We previously found that the Vpr mutant E25K was resistant toward 1 on a paper disc assay (22Watanabe N. Nishihara Y. Yamaguchi T. Koito A. Miyoshi H. Kakeya H. Osada H. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 2598-2602Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Because this mutant was also resistant to the inhibitory activity of 3 by maintaining the growth arrest (supplemental Fig. S3), we hypothesized that residue Glu-25 may be important for the growth arrest activity of Vpr and that both compounds 1 and 3 interact with Vpr within the vicinity of residue Glu-25. Therefore, we constructed a series of single point alanine mutants (amino acids 21ELLEELKS28 on α-helix 1) of Vpr as well as a second series of mutants (amino acids 61IRILQQLL68 on α-helix 3) in a leucine-rich domain of Vpr, a domain found to be important for binding to VprBP, a precursor in its G2 arrest activity (30DeHart J.L. Zimmerman E.S. Ardon O. Monteiro-Filho C.M. Argañaraz E.R. Planelles V. Virol. J. 2007; 4: 57Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). These two stretches of amino acids (21–28 and 61–68) are adjacent to each other, and a hydrophobic region is present between them (7Pandey R.C. Datta D. Mukerjee R. Srinivasan A. Mahalingam S. Sawaya B.E. Curr. HIV Res. 2009; 7: 114-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The hit compound 3 and active derivatives were then used to assay the Vpr mutants on a 96-well plate format akin to the HTS process described earlier. We found that the effects of these mutations on the cell cycle arrest activity of Vpr were similar to previous findings (6Morellet N. Roques B.P. Bouaziz S. Curr. HIV. Res. 2009; 7: 184-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 7Pandey R.C. Datta D. Mukerjee R. Srinivasan A. Mahalingam S. Sawaya B.E. Curr. HIV Res. 2009; 7: 114-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), as reflected in the overall growth profile of the two series of mutants (supplemental Fig. S3), which also revealed a profile of the inhibitors tested. As the weakened activity of certain Vpr mutants may obscure the inhibitory effect of the inhibitors, we utilized only selected Vpr mutants that maintained significant cell cycle arrest activity in further assays with the derivatives. In this analysis, the hit and derivatives were used at their optimum concentrations. We found that the Vpr mutants L22A and E25A (Fig. 4), which were responsive to 1, were resistant to 3. Furthermore, alanine mutations at residues Arg-62, Ile-63, and Gln-65, which resulted in poor responses to the inhibitory action of 3, were much more responsive toward 5 (Fig. 4). Mutant S28A, however, appeared resistant to the effects of all three compounds. Interestingly, vipirinin was more potent than 5 in inhibiting the activity of Vpr mutants L22A, E25A, and I63A, suggesting a possible effect of the morpholine moiety on these residues. The contrasting profile of the inhibitors 3 and 5 on the Vpr mutants shows a clear structure-activity relationship between the 2-methoxy moiety on the 3-phenyl ring of hit compound 3 and its Vpr inhibitory activity. This inhibitory assay also identified several key residues on the hydrophobic region of Vpr with which these inhibitors interacted. To confirm that 3 and vipirinin are directly interacting with Vpr, we prepared 3- and vipirinin-immobilized-agarose beads using an established photoimmobilization method that allows the introduction of a variety of small molecules onto solid support in a functional group-independent manner (26Kanoh N. Honda K. Simizu S. Muroi M. Osada H. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2005; 44: 3559-3562Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We had successfully used this method to identify the target of an osteoclastogenesis inhibitor (31Kawatani M. Okumura H. Honda K. Kanoh N. Muroi M. Dohmae N. Takami M. Kitagawa M. Futamura Y. Imoto M. Osada H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 11691-11696Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Using these beads, we were able to detect the direct binding of Vpr in yeast total cell lysate to 3 by Western blot analysis (supplemental Fig. S4). However, we were unable to perform a competition assay using free 3, which may have been due to the poor water solubility of coumarins. We observed a precipitate after the addition of excess 3 to the binding buffer, with the soluble portion unable, or containing insufficient amount of inhibitors, to bind with Vpr in the solution (data not shown).Because morpholine has better miscibility (32Budavari S. O'Neil M.J. The Merck Index: An Encyclopedia of Chemicals, Drugs, and Biologicals. 13th ed. Merck Research Laboratories, Division of Merck & Co., Inc., Whitehouse Station, NJ2001Google Scholar), we predicted that vipirinin, with a morpholine moiety, may perform better in the competition assay. Although there was slight precipitation when excess vipirinin was added to the binding buffer, it was less than observed with 3, and in this instance, the amount of vipirinin in solution was sufficient to compete for Vpr on both 3- and vipirinin-immobilized beads (Fig. 5A). These results indicate that 3 and vipirinin most likely inhibit Vpr by directly binding to it. Pull-down assays with selected Vpr mutants using 3- and vipirinin immobilized beads showed that mutant S28A did not bind to either (Fig. 5B), in agreement with findings of the Vpr mutants inhibitory assay that showed Vpr mutant S28A responding poorly to compound 3 and vipirinin. Vpr is necessary for HIV-1 infection of nondividing cells such as macrophages (33Connor R.I. Chen B.K. Choe S. Landau N.R. Virology. 1995; 206: 935-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). As compound 1 was found to be able to inhibit both Vpr-caused growth arrest and Vpr-dependent viral gene expression in our previous study (22Watanabe N. Nishihara Y. Yamaguchi T. Koito A. Miyoshi H. Kakeya H. Osada H. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 2598-2602Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), we wanted to see if the coumarin-based inhibitors are also able to act in the same way. To determine the effect of vipirinin on proviral transcription after infection, we tested the hit compound 3 and vipirinin in a luciferase gene reporter system (33Connor R.I. Chen B.K. Choe S. Landau N.R. Virology. 1995; 206: 935-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). Briefly, luciferase activity, corresponding to proviral transcription, was measured 6 days after infection in cells that had been treated with the inhibitors at the time of infection. Treatment with 1, 3, or vipirinin inhibited luciferase expression from the virus in a dose dependent manner (Fig. 6) without any signs of toxicity toward the macrophages (supplemental Fig. S5A). In addition, these compounds at these concentrations did not significantly affect the growth of human T cells and osteosarcoma cells (supplemental Fig. S5B and data not shown). Infection by Vpr-deficient virus (used as negative control) was about 10% of that of virus carrying wild-type Vpr and was not significantly affected by the compounds (Fig. 6). These findings show that, like 1, the hit compound 3 and vipirinin can inhibit Vpr-dependent viral infection of human macrophages. Because Vpr has several functions, including pre-integration complex transport and transactivation of proviral LTR, it is interesting to determine which of these steps were inhibited by vipirinin and compounds 1 and 3. We examined the effects of these three compounds on PIC transport by semi-quantitative estimation of viral DNA synthesis upon the infection of macrophages. We found that vipirinin and compounds 1 and 3 did not inhibit PIC transport at the early infection, indicating that these compounds inhibited viral infection by perturbing the Vpr-dependent transactivation of proviral LTR (supplemental Fig. S6). Previously, we have shown that compound 1 abrogated the activity of G2 arrest by Vpr in mammalian cells (18Li G. Park H.U. Liang D. Zhao R.Y. Retrovirology. 2010; 7: 59Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Interestingly, however, we found that vipirinin did not have a significant effect on this activity (data not shown). Consistent with the effects of these compounds on mutated Vpr, these results suggest a different mechanism of action between vipirinin and compound 1. Anti-HIV agents have been largely successful in reducing viral load in HIV-positive individuals, thus enhancing their quality of life, but the long-term side effects of these drugs, coupled with increased drug resistance, complicate treatment. Current combination therapy, known as highly active antiretroviral therapy, only targets the structural proteins of HIV, but accumulative knowledge now shows that the targeting of accessory proteins is imperative in the strategy to combat HIV (24Richter S.N. Frasson I. Palù G. Curr. Med. Chem. 2009; 16: 267-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The identification of small molecule inhibitors is the first step toward this direction, and given the still ongoing efforts to understand Vpr, these inhibitors can act as bioprobes and expand the molecular toolbox to glean further insights into it. The initial motivation of this research was to develop an HTS system to screen chemical compounds in the RIKEN NPDepo, an annotated repository containing more than 24,000 natural products and their derivatives (25Tomiki T. Saito T. Ueki M. Konno H. Asaoka T. Suzuki R. Uramoto M. Kakeya H. Osada H. J. Comp. Aid. Chem. 2006; 7: 157-162Crossref Google Scholar). We therefore built on our previous screening experience and capitalized on the measurable growth of yeasts in liquid culture to this end. The simple induction of yeast growth arrest by Vpr (34Macreadie I.G. Castelli L.A. Hewish D.R. Kirkpatrick A. Ward A.C. Azad A.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Knockdown of Sp1/Sp3 expression by siRNA blunted IL-1β induction of both HAS2-AS1 and HAS2, and Smad2/Smad3 knockdown similarly attenuated TGF-β1 stimulation. Inhibition of IL-1β-stimulated HAS2-AS1 RNA induction using HAS2-AS1-specific siRNAs also suppressed up-regulation of HAS2 mRNA transcription. The thermodynamic feasibility of HAS2-AS1/HAS2 heterodimer formation was demonstrated in silico, and locus-specific cytoplasmic double-stranded RNA was detected in vitro.

For all progressive renal diseases, the rate of progression correlates with the degree of corticointerstitial fibrosis. Increased HA synthesis and extracellular matrix expansion in the renal corticointerstitium are common features of kidney fibrosis (16Rouschop K.M. Sewnath M.E. Claessen N. Roelofs J.J.

Post-transcriptional regulation of HAS2 expression by a tetraexonic RNA, transcribed from the opposite genomic DNA strand at the HAS2 locus, has been described by Chao and Spicer (26Chao H. Spicer A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27513-27522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This transcript was originally called HASNT, for HA synthase 2 antisense (26Chao H. Spicer A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27513-27522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), but has since been annotated formally with the NCBI Entrez Gene definition HAS2-AS1 HAS2 antisense RNA (non-protein coding) (Homo sapiens). The most recent HAS2-AS1 reference sequence has NCBI accession number NR_002835.2 and is located on the plus strand of human chromosome 8 from positions 122651586 to 122657564. HAS2-AS1 exon 2 shares sequence complementarity with the first exon of the HAS2 gene (see Fig. 1A). Overexpression of this complementary antisense region has been shown to down-regulate HAS2 transcription and HA synthesis in osteosarcoma cells, but the antisense transcript was not detected in kidney (26Chao H. Spicer A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27513-27522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The aim of this study was to identify the expression of HAS2-AS1 in PTCs and then to investigate the role of this RNA in the post-transcriptional regulation of HAS2 expression in these cells. Having established that HAS2-AS1 was transcribed in PTCs, subsequent time course analyses showed coordinated up-regulation of HAS2 and HAS2-AS1 transcription in response to stimulation with the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β or the key fibrotic regulator TGF-β1. We then set out to identify the factors regulating this simultaneous sense and antisense expression and to analyze the effects on HAS2 expression of modulating HAS2-AS1 transcription in these cells. Finally, we investigated the thermodynamic feasibility of HAS2-AS1/HAS2 heterodimer formation in silico and detected locus-specific ribonuclease-resistant double-stranded RNA, providing evidence for the formation of RNA/mRNA duplexes in vitro. The culture of the human kidney PTC line HK-2 was as described previously (22Monslow J. Williams J.D. Guy C.A. Price I.K. Craig K.J. Williams H.J. Williams N.M. Martin J. Coleman S.L. Topley N.

Nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA extracts were treated with 20 units/ml DNase (Promega UK Ltd., Southampton, Hampshire, United Kingdom) and, where appropriate, 100 μg/ml RNase A (Roche Diagnostics Ltd., Burgess Hill, West Sussex, United Kingdom) at 37 °C for 2 h. First-strand cDNA synthesis from 0.5–1 μg of total RNA was performed using the cDNA reverse transcriptase high capacity kit from Applied Biosystems (Warrington, Cheshire, United Kingdom). End-point RT-PCR primers were designed to span intron-exon boundaries to obviate amplification from contaminating genomic DNA, with the exception of the oligonucleotides used in heteroduplex detection, sequence data for which are given in the legend to Fig. 8B. Details of all other HAS2-AS1-specific primer sequences/binding sites are shown in Fig. 1B. All oligonucleotides were obtained from Invitrogen Ltd. (Paisley, Renfrewshire, United Kingdom) or Metabion (Martinsried, Bavaria, Germany). As we have detailed previously (22Monslow J. Williams J.D. Guy C.A. Price I.K. Craig K.J. Williams H.J. Williams N.M. Martin J. Coleman S.L. Topley N. Spicer A.P. Buckland P.R. Davies M. Bowen T. J. Biol.

Our SYBR Green qRT-PCR assay for HAS2-AS1 was optimized for linear detection with an efficiency of ∼100% using the oligonucleotide primers shown in Fig. 1B. Total RNA was isolated as described above, followed by a HAS2-AS1-specific RT step using 250 ng to 2 μg of total RNA and the SYBR-RT primer at a final concentration of 100 nm, 500 nm, or 1.0 μm. RT was carried out at 45 °C for 5 min, 37 °C for 1 h, and 85 °C for 5 min, followed by chilling at 4 °C. qRT-PCR was then performed in a total reaction volume of 20 μl using 1.3 μl of cDNA, the Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), and HAS2-AS1-specific PCR primers SYBR-F and SYBR-R at a final concentration of 300 nm. Samples were processed in Applied Biosystems fast optical 96-well reaction plates in a 7900HT fast real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) with cycling parameters of 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. Melting curve analysis was performed to confirm amplification of a single product. Following optimization, routine HAS2-AS1 analyses were carried out using RT from 1 μg of total RNA, followed by qRT-PCR as described above. Onboard SDS Version 2.3 software was used for the analysis of output data from biological triplicates. TaqMan assays for HAS2 (catalog no. Hs00193435_m1), Smad2 (Hs00183425_m1), Smad3 (Hs00232222_m1), Sp1 (Hs00412720_m1), Sp3 (Hs01595811_m1), and 18 S rRNA (4310893E) were obtained from Applied Biosystems. A custom HAS2-AS1 TaqMan assay (HAS2-AS1_LS) was also purchased from Applied Biosystems and used, as recommended by the manufacturer, to analyze cDNA generated from subsequent siRNA knockdown experiments. For HAS2 and 18 S rRNA qRT-PCR, 1 μl of cDNA was added to 19 μl of a qRT-PCR mixture in 1× TaqMan Fast Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems); 2 μl of cDNA was added to 18 μl for the corresponding HAS2-AS1 reaction. Biological triplicates of all TaqMan assays were analyzed as described above. Absolute quantification of HAS2 mRNA was carried out by standard means using the HAS2 open reading frame (a gift from Dr. Andrew P. Spicer, Texas A&M University System Health Science Center, Houston, TX) inserted into an expression vector that we have described previously (28Simpson R.M. Meran S. Thomas D. Stephens P. Bowen T.

HAS2-AS1 RNA was quantified similarly using the full-length antisense sequence in pBluescript (Epoch Biolabs Inc., Missouri City, TX) together with oligonucleotide primer sequence aqHAS2-AS1-F and an oligonucleotide binding at the aqHAS2-AS1-R site shown in Fig. 1B. Putative HAS2-AS1 promoter sequences were PCR-amplified using the primers/primer-binding sites highlighted in Fig. 1B, high fidelity Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen Ltd.), and the cycling parameters recommended by the manufacturer. Sense-strand primers 0.1–0.7 (KpnI) and antisense-strand primer R (NotI) bore tails suitable for restriction endonuclease digestion and subsequent ligation into a modified pGL3 luciferase reporter vector, after which they were sequenced to ensure fidelity of amplification as described previously (29Hoogendoorn B.

Transient transfection into HK-2 cells cultured in 6-well plates (BD Biosciences, Oxford, Oxfordshire, United Kingdom) was carried out using Lipofectamine LTX and Plus Reagent (Invitrogen Ltd.) in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. The ability of each HAS2-AS1 promoter fragment to drive transcription of the firefly luciferase gene was tested, according to the manufacturer's instructions, using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega UK Ltd.). In each test sample, in addition to the above firefly luciferase activity, this assay also detected the Renilla reniformis luciferase activity of a second vector that was cotransfected to control for variation in transfection efficiency. The relative luciferase activity of the test constructs was then expressed as the ratio of firefly to Renilla luciferase activities. We have described the growth medium to maximize luciferase output previously (22Monslow J. Williams J.D. Guy C.A. Price I.K. Craig K.J. Williams H.J. Williams N.M. Martin J. Coleman S.L. Topley N.

Three custom siRNAs specific for HAS2-AS1, and not for HAS2, were purchased from Applied Biosystems (catalog no. 295471, 295472, and 295473). A final concentration of 30 nm each siRNA was transfected into HK-2 cells cultured in 12-well plates (BD Biosciences) using siPORT amine transfection reagent as described previously (23Monslow J.

The previously determined time points of 3 h for IL-1β and 48 h for TGF-β1 were used for subsequent cytokine stimulations. HAS2-AS1 locus sequences were retrieved from the genome browser at the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics site and analyzed for the presence of putative transcription factor-binding sites (TFBSs) using the CISTER program (30Frith M.C. Hansen U. Weng Z. Bioinformatics. 2001; 17: 878-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) and the updated MatInspector program from the Genomatix suite (31Cartharius K. Frech K. Grote K. Klocke B. Haltmeier M. Klingenhoff A. Frisch M. Bayerlein M. Werner T. Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: 2933-2942Crossref PubMed Scopus (1643) Google Scholar). Selected putative TFBSs are shown in Fig. 1B. The secondary structures of HAS2 mRNA and HAS2-AS1 RNA were investigated in silico to verify the thermodynamic feasibility of interaction to form a heterodimer. Minimum free energy and partition function calculations were performed using the Vienna suite of programs to probe the relative stabilities of folded RNA monomers, homodimers, and heterodimers (32Hofacker W.F.

Stadler P.F. Hofacker I.L. Algorithms Mol. Biol. 2006; 1: 3Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Data were calculated as the ratio of the firefly luciferase activity for each HAS2-AS1 promoter-reporter construct to the corresponding value for the cotransfected R. reniformis luciferase vector. Where appropriate, statistical analysis was performed using the Wilcoxon signed rank test, and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Fold changes in expression were calculated using 2−(ΔCt1−ΔCt2), where ΔCt represents the difference between the threshold cycle (Ct) for each target gene and 18 S rRNA (34Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (127160) Google Scholar). Values for p were calculated by the t test using Microsoft Excel and were considered significant below 0.05. Fig. 2A shows that, following RT from total PTC RNA, HAS2-AS1 RNA-specific amplification was detected by end-point RT-PCR using primers spanning two intron-exon junctions. We then optimized a SYBR Green qRT-PCR assay from which the typical amplification data shown in Fig. 2B were obtained, and the melting curve of the products generated is shown in Fig. 2C. Both panels demonstrate that the amplification from negative control reactions, including any contaminating genomic DNA remaining in the RNA extracts, was negligible. Fig. 2D illustrates that, using this assay, the detection of HAS2-AS1 was quantitative within the range of 250 ng to 2 μg of total PTC input RNA for the three RT primer concentrations shown. The absolute quantification of HAS2 and HAS2-AS1 RNAs shown in Fig. 2E showed that the ratio of mRNA to RNA was 4.7:1 in quiescent HK-2 cells and 4.4:1 in IL-1β-stimulated cells. Time courses following the expression of HAS2-AS1 and HAS2 by qRT-PCR in response to stimulation of PTCs with IL-1β are shown in Fig. 3 (A and B, respectively). An initial peak of HAS2-AS1 and HAS2 expression was seen at ∼2–3 h. The expression of both RNAs then declined rapidly after 6 h before rising steadily through 48 h. Fig. 3 (C and D) shows that the addition of TGF-β1 also led to the up-regulation of both transcripts in a coordinated fashion, increasing over time points to 72 h. Each luciferase reporter construct containing an insert of putative HAS2-AS1 promoter sequence showed significant luciferase activity in comparison with the promoterless pGL3-Basic control vector, as shown in Fig. 4. The magnitude of activity varied from ∼5-fold greater than pGL3 for the 0.1-kb vector to >10-fold greater for the 0.7-kb construct. The ability of these inserts to drive the transcription of the luciferase gene demonstrated the constitutive promoter activity of each and implied the presence of the HAS2-AS1 proximal promoter. All insert sequences spanned a putative TFBS for both Sp1 and Sp3, mediators of constitutive HAS2 transcription (23Monslow J. Williams J.D. Fraser D.J. Michael D.R. Foka P. Kift-Morgan A.P. Luo D.D. Fielding C.A. Craig K.J. Topley N. Jones S.A. Ramji D.P. Bowen T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18043-18050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and a binding element for Smad proteins, the transcription factors that mediate response to TGF-β. These motifs were identified in silico within the first 100 nucleotides upstream of HAS2-AS1 NR_002835 (see Fig. 1B). Combined transcription factor siRNAs for either Sp1/Sp3 or Smad2/Smad3 were administered prior to the addition of IL-1β or TGF-β1, respectively. The knockdown of Sp1 and Sp3 mRNAs inhibited IL-1β-stimulated up-regulation of HAS2 (Fig. 5A) and HAS2-AS1 (Fig. 5B). This effect was also seen when Smad2 and Smad3 mRNAs were knocked down and the induction of HAS2 by TGF-β1 was blunted (Fig. 5, C and D). Low abundance HAS2-AS1 expression was detected in quiescent PTCs. Therefore, the effectiveness of HAS2-AS1 siRNA knockdown was evaluated following transcriptional induction by IL-1β, which repeatedly induced a greater magnitude of up-regulation of HAS2-AS1 transcription than TGF-β1 (see FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5). Each of the three siRNAs analyzed significantly inhibited IL-1β induction of HAS2-AS1 RNA, as shown in Fig. 6A. In addition, Fig. 6B shows that each siRNA also blunted the up-regulation of HAS2 mRNA synthesis, but this inhibitory effect was statistically significant only in two of three cases. The original description of HAS2-AS1 reported alternative splicing of HAS2-AS1 exon 2, resulting in “long” (L) and “short” (S) HAS2-AS1 isoforms varying in length by 83 nucleotides and sharing either 257 nucleotides (L-HAS2-AS1) or 174 nucleotides (S-HAS2-AS1) of complementary sequence with the first exon of HAS2 (Fig. 7A) (26Chao H. Spicer A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27513-27522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Fig. 7B shows the detection of both L- and S-HAS2-AS1 expression in PTCs by agarose gel electrophoresis of end-point RT-PCR-amplified fragments. For L-HAS2-AS1-specific reactions A–C and B–F, oligonucleotides were designed to prime amplification from the 83-nucleotide alternatively spliced region of exon 2. S-HAS2-AS1-specific products were amplified using primers A–D and E–F. HAS2 mRNA and HAS2-AS1 RNA were predicted to interact primarily through duplex formation of their perfectly complementary regions (174 nucleotides for S-HAS2-AS1 and 257 nucleotides for L-HAS2-AS1), with little other intermolecular hybridization predicted between the sequences (Fig. 8A). Based on the ensemble free energies of the species, at equilibrium at 37 °C, an equimolar mixture of HAS2 mRNA and L-HAS2-AS1 was predicted to exist overwhelmingly as a heterodimer (−2180 kcal/mol) without competition from homodimers (−2055 and −1696 kcal/mol for HAS2 mRNA and L-HAS2-AS1, respectively) or intramolecularly folded monomer forms (−1022 and −841 kcal/mol for HAS2 mRNA and L-HAS2-AS1, respectively). Comparable results were obtained for the interaction of HAS2 mRNA with S-HAS2-AS1 (data not shown). The calculations therefore support the existence of a dimer of HAS2 mRNA and HAS2-AS1 RNA in the absence of sequestration of the RNAs in kinetic or thermodynamic traps, which were not considered by this analysis. The RT-PCR assay data shown in Fig. 8B depict the detection of a ribonuclease- and deoxyribonuclease-resistant HAS2-AS1/HAS2 heteroduplex in PTC cytoplasmic RNA. Very little duplex signal was detected in nuclear RNA extracts (data not shown). Understanding the mechanisms that regulate the expression of the human HAS genes is part of an ongoing series of studies in our laboratory that aim to determine the pathogenic mechanisms underlying renal fibrosis. In this investigation, we analyzed the expression of the HAS2 natural antisense RNA, HAS2-AS1, and investigated its role in the regulation of HAS2 expression. Since the prescient identification of HAS2-AS1 as a post-transcriptional regulator of HAS2 expression and HA synthesis (26Chao H. Spicer A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27513-27522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), a more detailed knowledge of the transcriptional output of the human genome has been revealed, including the pan-genomic significance of noncoding RNAs in gene expression (35Carninci P.

To address if lacrimal gland development and FGF signaling depends on 2-O-sulfation of uronic acids and 6-O-sulfation of glucosamine residues, we genetically ablated heparan sulfate 2-O and 6-O sulfotransferases (Hs2st, Hs6st1, and Hs6st2) in developing lacrimal gland.

https://openalex.org/W2055382546,"Curacin A is a polyketide synthase (PKS)-non-ribosomal peptide synthetase-derived natural product with potent anticancer properties generated by the marine cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscula. Type I modular PKS assembly lines typically employ a thioesterase (TE) domain to off-load carboxylic acid or macrolactone products from an adjacent acyl carrier protein (ACP) domain. In a striking departure from this scheme the curacin A PKS employs tandem sulfotransferase and TE domains to form a terminal alkene moiety. Sulfotransferase sulfonation of β-hydroxy-acyl-ACP is followed by TE hydrolysis, decarboxylation, and sulfate elimination (Gu, L., Wang, B., Kulkarni, A., Gehret, J. J., Lloyd, K. R., Gerwick, L., Gerwick, W. H., Wipf, P., Håkansson, K., Smith, J. L., and Sherman, D. H. (2009) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 131, 16033-16035). With low sequence identity to other PKS TEs (<15%), the curacin TE represents a new thioesterase subfamily. The 1.7-Å curacin TE crystal structure reveals how the familiar α/β-hydrolase architecture is adapted to specificity for β-sulfated substrates. A Ser-His-Glu catalytic triad is centered in an open active site cleft between the core domain and a lid subdomain. Unlike TEs from other PKSs, the lid is fixed in an open conformation on one side by dimer contacts of a protruding helix and on the other side by an arginine anchor from the lid into the core. Adjacent to the catalytic triad, another arginine residue is positioned to recognize the substrate β-sulfate group. The essential features of the curacin TE are conserved in sequences of five other putative bacterial ACP-ST-TE tridomains. Formation of a sulfate leaving group as a biosynthetic strategy to facilitate acyl chain decarboxylation is of potential value as a route to hydrocarbon biofuels."

https://openalex.org/W2034151090,"proBDNF, a precursor of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), is anterogradely transported and released from nerve terminals, but the mechanism underlying this process remains unclear. In this study, we report that proBDNF forms a complex with Huntingtin associated protein-1 (HAP1) and sortilin, which plays an important role in proBDNF intracellular trafficking and stabilization. The interaction of proBDNF with both HAP1A and sortilin in co-transfected HEK293 cells is confirmed by both fluorescence resonance energy transfer and co-immunoprecipitation. The frequent co-localization (>90%) of endogenous HAP1, sortilin, and proBDNF is also found in cultured cortical neurons. Mapping studies using GST pulldown and competition assays has defined the interacting region of HAP1 with proBDNF within amino acids 371-445 and the binding sequences of proBDNF to HAP1 between amino acids 65 and 90. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching confirms the defective movement of proBDNF-containing vesicles in neurites of HAP1(-/-) neurons, which can be partially restored by reintroducing HAP1 cDNA into the neurons. However, the effect is significantly increased by simultaneously reintroducing both HAP1 and sortilin. proBDNF and HAP1 are highly co-localized with organelle markers for the Golgi network, microtubules, molecular motor, or endosomes in normal neurons, but this co-localization is reduced in HAP1(-/-) neurons. Co-immunoprecipitation and Western blot showed that sortilin stabilizes the proBDNF·HAP1 complex in co-transfected HEK293 cells, helping to prevent proBDNF degradation. Furthermore, the complex facilitates furin cleavage to release mature BDNF."
https://openalex.org/W2056943417,"The cancer/testis antigens (CTAs) are an important group of heterogeneous proteins that are predominantly expressed in the testis in the normal human adult but are aberrantly expressed in several types of cancers. Prostate-associated gene 4 (PAGE4) is a member of the CT-X family of CTAs that in addition to testis, is highly expressed in the fetal prostate, and may also play an important role both in benign and malignant prostate diseases. However, the function of this gene remains poorly understood. Here, we show that PAGE4 is a highly (100%) intrinsically disordered protein (IDP). The primary protein sequence conforms to the features of a typical IDP sequence and the secondary structure prediction algorithm metaPrDOS strongly supported this prediction. Furthermore, SDS-gel electrophoresis and analytical size exclusion chromatography of the recombinant protein revealed an anomalous behavior characteristic of IDPs. UV circular dichroism (CD) and NMR spectroscopy confirmed that PAGE4 is indeed a highly disordered protein. In further bioinformatic analysis, the PredictNLS algorithm uncovered a potential nuclear localization signal, whereas the algorithm DBS-Pred returned a 99.1% probability that PAGE4 is a DNA-binding protein. Consistent with this prediction, biochemical experiments showed that PAGE4 preferentially binds a GC-rich sequence. Silencing PAGE4 expression induced cell death via apoptosis and in mice carrying PCa xenografts, siRNA-mediated knockdown of the PAGE4 mRNA attenuated tumor growth in vivo. Furthermore, overexpressing PAGE4 protected cells from stress-induced death. To our knowledge, PAGE4 is the first example of a CTA that is an IDP with an anti-apoptotic function.

Contrary to the prevailing notion that most proteins are globular with rigid three-dimensional conformations, many biologically active proteins lack stable three-dimensional structures under physiological conditions in vitro. Such proteins, referred to as intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), 3The abbreviations used are: IDP, intrinsically disordered protein; CTA, cancer/testis antigen; PAGE4, prostate-associated gene 4; NLS, nuclear localization signal; RONN, regional order neural network; WST-1, 4-[3-(4-iodophenyl)-2-(4-nitrophenyl)-2H-5-tetrazolio]-1,3-benzene disulfonate; PARP-1, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. are highly abundant in nature and possess a number of unique structural properties such as high stability when exposed to low pH and high temperature, and structural indifference toward unfolding by strong denaturants (1Uversky V.N. J. Biomed. Biotechnol. 2010; : 568Google Scholar). Physiologically, IDPs are involved in signaling, and transcriptional regulation, where binding to multiple partners and high specificity/low affinity interactions play a crucial role. They often function by molecular recognition, in which the disordered segments are used for partner recognition (2Hazy E. Tompa P. ChemPhysChem. 2009; 10: 1415-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The binding segment undergoes induced folding to attain an ordered structure upon binding to a biological target (coupled folding and binding), and in addition, IDPs may structurally adapt to different partners with different functional outcomes, resulting in promiscuity in function termed “moonlighting” (3Tompa P. Szász C. Buday L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 484-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Indeed, the overexpression of IDPs is often associated with human diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, amyloidoses, neurodegenerative diseases, and diabetes and thus, the IDPs represent attractive targets for drugs modulating protein-protein interactions (4Uversky V.N. Oldfield C.J. Dunker A.K. Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2008; 37: 215-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar). The cancer/testis antigens (CTAs) are an important group of proteins that are predominantly expressed in the testis but aberrantly expressed in several types of cancers (5Scanlan M.J. Simpson A.J. Old L.J. Cancer Immun. 2004; 4: 1PubMed Google Scholar). Because of their restricted expression in an immune-privileged organ, the CTAs represent attractive immunotherapy targets. Indeed, autoantibodies against several CTAs have been detected in cancer patients and often such patients present with better prognosis (6Scanlan M.J. Gure A.O. Jungbluth A.A. Old L.J. Chen Y.T. Immunol. Rev. 2002; 188: 22-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). Broadly speaking, the CTAs can be divided into two groups: the CT-X antigens located on the X chromosome and non-X CT antigens located on various autosomes. The non-X CTAs are fairly well conserved with known functions including, transformation (7Lee J.H. Schütte D. Wulf G. Füzesi L. Radzun H.J. Schweyer S. Engel W. Nayernia K. Hum. Mol.

In contrast, the CT-X antigens appear to have evolved fairly recently and most lack orthologues in lower mammals except primates (19Stevenson B.J. Iseli C. Panji S. Zahn-Zabal M. Hide W. Old L.J.

PAGE4 is a member of the PAGE family of CT-X antigens that consists of several members that map to Xp11.21 on the X chromosome. However, unlike a typical CT-X antigen that is predominantly expressed only in the testis, PAGE4 appears to be a developmental gene that is highly up-regulated in the fetal prostate but is present at basal levels in the adult gland, both at the protein 4R. H. Getzenberg, unpublished data. and mRNA levels. However, PAGE4 is “reactivated” in both malignant (26Iavarone C. Wolfgang C. Kumar V. Duray P. Willingham M. Pastan I. Bera T.K. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2002; 1: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and symptomatic but not asymptomatic benign prostatic diseases (27Prakash K. Pirozzi G. Elashoff M. Munger W. Waga I. Dhir R. Kakehi Y. Getzenberg R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 7598-7603Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Despite these dynamic expression patterns that parallel the proliferative growth of the prostate gland during development and disease, the function of PAGE4 remains poorly understood. Disorder in the PAGE4 structure was predicted using FoldIndex (28Prilusky J. Felder C.E. Zeev-Ben-Mordehai T. Rydberg E.H. Man O. Beckmann J.S. Silman I. Sussman J.L. Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: 3435-3438Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar), RONN (29Yang Z.R. Thomson R. McNeil P. Esnouf R.M. Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: 3369-3376Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar), and metaPrDOS (30Ishida T. Kinoshita K. Bioinformatics. 2008; 24: 1344-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Nuclear localization signal (NLS) was predicted using the PredictNLS algorithm (31Cokol M. Ozbay F. Rodriguez-Esteban R. EMBO Rep. 2008; 9: 2Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and DNA binding was predicted using the algorithm DBS-Pred (32Ahmad S. Gromiha M.M. Sarai A. Bioinformatics. 2004; 20: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). PAGE4 cDNA was obtained by PCR using a cDNA clone (Origene, Rockville, MD) as template and two gene-specific forward and reverse primers containing NdeI and EcoRI restriction sites, respectively. Following restriction digestion, the cDNA was cloned into the pET28a vector at the NdeI/EcoRI cloning sites resulting in its in-frame fusion with an N-terminal His tag, and transfected into the TOP10 Escherichia coli cells (Invitrogen). Expression of the recombinant protein was induced with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and protein was purified over a nickel column from the supernatant obtained after bacterial lysis. The eluted protein was digested with thrombin (EMD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) to remove the His tag and again passed through a nickel column to capture the His tag. The eluate was dialyzed against PBS. Purified recombinant PAGE4 protein was analyzed on a NuPAGE 4–12% BisTris gel (Invitrogen) under reducing and denaturing conditions and stained with Coomassie Blue. Immunoblotting was done as described previously (33Zeng Y. Kulkarni P. Inoue T. Getzenberg R.H. J. Cell. Biochem. 2009; 107: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Total cellular lysate (50 μg of protein) from LNCaP cells was used to detect endogenous PAGE4. The polyclonal antibody was the same as described previously (25Grigoriadis A. Caballero O.L. Hoek K.S. da Silva L. Chen Y.T. Shin S.J. Jungbluth A.A. Miller L.D. Clouston D. Cebon J. Old L.J. Lakhani S.R. Simpson A.J. Neville A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 13493-13498Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and was used at a 1:2,500 dilution overnight followed by incubation with secondary antibody at 1:50,000 dilution for 1 h. Samples were injected into a Superdex 200 10/30 AKTA FPLC column (GE Healthcare) using PBS as running buffer. Prior to PAGE4 chromatography, 200 μg each of ovalbumin and ribonuclease A were injected to serve as standards. CD spectra were recorded at the following temperatures: 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 °C. A protein concentration of 0.33 mg/ml was used in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer containing 150 mm sodium chloride, pH 7.4. CD measurements were made on a JASCO spectropolarimeter using a 0.1-cm path length. One-dimensional 1H NMR spectra of PAGE4 as a function of temperature were recorded on a Bruker DMX-600 spectrometer using a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml and the same buffer conditions as above. A water flip-back pulse sequence was used for solvent suppression. To determine whether PAGE4 binds DNA and to identify the sequence to which it may preferentially bind, we employed a technique we developed previously (34Nallur G.N. Prakash K. Weissman S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 1184-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) with some modifications. A “library” of 10-mer dsDNA binding sites was constructed using a synthetic oligonucleotide 5′-CGAGGTCGACGGTATCGNNNNNNNNNNGGATCCACTAGTTCTAGAGC-3′ that was converted to dsDNA by PCR. PCR primers had the following sequences: P1, 5′-CGAGGTCGACGGTATCG-3′; and P2, 5′-GCTCTAGAACTAGTGGATC-3′. PCR was performed with GoTaq® Green Master Mix (Promega, Madison, WI). PCR cycling conditions were 95 °C for 30 s, then 95 °C for 10 s, 62 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 s for 35 cycles. The PAGE4 protein was cloned into a FLAG-tagged-pCMV6 (Origene, Rockville, MD), transiently expressed in HEK293T cells (35Mooney S.M. Grande J.P. Salisbury J.L. Janknecht R. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and purified by immunoprecipitation (36Mooney S.M. Goel A. D'Assoro A.B. Salisbury J.L. Janknecht R. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 30443-30452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) with FLAG-agarose beads (Sigma), using Frackelton buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 30 mm Na4P2O7, pH 7.1, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, HaltTM Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL)), containing 10 pmol of the dsDNA oligonucleotide library. The agarose beads were washed 5 times with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) and the DNA that co-immunoprecipitated was extracted with a QIAEX II kit (Qiagen, Gaithersburg, MD) and amplified with P1/P2 primers as described above. The resulting PCR product was purified on a 2% agarose gel and used in a new round of selection with PAGE4 protein. After the third round of selection, the PCR product was cloned into pCR NT/T7 TOPO TA vector (Invitrogen), plated on ampicillin-containing agar plates. Twenty-five clones were randomly selected to determine the DNA sequence of the binding sites. Prostate cancer cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Cells were cultured at 37 °C in routine RPMI (Invitrogen) medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) with humidified air and 5% carbon dioxide. The LNCaP-96 cells used in this study were those established at Johns Hopkins University by Pflug et al. (37Pflug B.R. Reiter R.E. Nelson J.B. Prostate. 1999; 40: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). They were routinely cultured in phenol-red free RPMI supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped FBS (HyClone, Logan, UT). PAGE4 ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool siRNA were obtained from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). Approximately 5 × 103 cells were transfected with siRNAs at 50 nm total concentration using 0.2 μl of DharmaFECT-3 of the transfection reagent and plated in a 96-well plate. Drug treatment was applied 24–48 h after transfection. Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the suppliers protocol. RNA samples were treated with DNase I (Invitrogen), and cDNA was synthesized using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). Real-time PCR was done using an iCycler iQ Multicolor Real-time PCR Detection system (Bio-Rad). PCR was done with RNA samples from a minimum of three independent experiments and each PCR was set up in triplicate. Target gene expression was compared with the housekeeping gene TATA box-binding protein (TBP) for normalization. The sequences of the PCR primers used were: TBP forward, GAATATAATCCCAAGCGGTTTG; TBP reverse, ACTTCACATCACAGCTCCCC; and PAGE4 forward, CGTAAAGTAGAAGGTGATTG, PAGE4 reverse, ATGCTTAGGATTAGGTGGAG. PCR cycling conditions were 95 °C for 5 min, then 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s for 40 cycles. Approximately 1 × 104 cells per well were seeded in 24-well plates. After growing for 1–7 days, the cell proliferation reagent WST-1 (4-[3-(4-iodophenyl)-2-(4-nitrophenyl)-2H-5-tetrazolio]-1,3-benzene disulfonate) was added to each well, as specified by the supplier (Roche Applied Science). After 4 h of incubation, WST-1 absorbance was measured at 450 nm. The cells were also stained with 0.05% crystal violet plus 20% methanol. In some experiments, 5 × 103 cells per well were seeded in 96-well plates. Seventy-two h after drug treatment, cell viability was analyzed by the WST-1 assay. Alternately, cell viability was evaluated by cell counting using a hemocytometer after excluding dead cells by trypan blue staining. All cell viability and inhibition experiments were biological replicates repeated at least three times. Apoptosis and cell cycle were detected on a Guva system (Guava Technologies, Hayward, CA) using the Terminal Transferase dUTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL) kit (Guava Technologies, Billerica, MA) and Guava Cell Cycle Reagent (Guava Technologies), respectively. Twenty-five thousand cells were seeded in chamber slides. Seventy-two h after siRNA treatment, cells were washed with PBS and fixed by 4% paraformalin, and then incubated with phospho-histone H2A.X (γ-H2A.X) antibody (Millipore, Billerica, MA) at room temperature for 1 h followed by FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies. Slides were observed with a Nikon Eclipse TE2000E using the GFP-BP filter (Ex 460–500, DM 5005, DA:510–560) and analyzed with NIS Elements AR 3.00 Software. The entry vector containing the PAGE4 open reading frame with C-terminal fusion of the DDK tag, pCMV6-Entry, and destination vector pCMV6-AC-GFP were purchased from Origene (Rockville, MD). The expression vector pCMV6-PAGE4-GFP was generated by first digesting pCMV6-Entry with SgfI and MluI digestion to extract the PAGE4 cDNA followed by in-frame ligation with destination vector pCMV6-AC-GFP. Sequences of all constructs were verified by SeqWright DNA Technology Services (Houston, TX). These constructs were expressed in CWR22rv1 or HEK-293T cells by transfection with FuGENE HD (Roche Applied Science). For creating xenografts, ∼2 × 106 LNCaP cells suspended in 75 μl of PBS were mixed with an equal volume of Matrigel and inoculated in the flank of 6-week-old SCID mice (Harlan Sprague-Dawley). When tumor volumes reached 200 mm3, mice were divided into 3 groups with 7 animals per group and administered PAGE4 siRNA, scrambled siRNA, or PBS treatment. siRNA was delivered using the AteloGeneTM in vivo siRNA transfection kit (KOKEN, Japan), and administrated intratumorally following the suppliers protocol every 5 days for a total of 3 times. Tumor growth was measured every 3 days and the relative tumor volumes were calculated as described (38Zeng Y. Wu X.X. Fiscella M. Shimada O. Humphreys R. Albert V. Kakehi Y. Int. J. Oncol. 2006; 28: 421-430PubMed Google Scholar). Two days after the last treatment of siRNA, 2 mice in each group were sacrificed under ether anesthesia, and tumors were dissected and frozen at −80 °C in RNAlater until further use. All treatment protocols were approved by the animal care and use committee of the Johns Hopkins University. Statistical comparisons were made using the Student's t test. Two-sided p < 0.05 was considered significant. All experiments were biological replicates repeated a minimum of three times except in the case of the in vivo experiments where they were done twice. Based on the relationships among intrinsic disorder, sequence complexity as measured by Shannon's entropy, and amino acid composition, IDPs are typically thought to display a bias toward polar amino acids and a bias away from non-polar amino acids (39Romero P. Obradovic Z. Li X. Garner E.C. Brown C.J. Dunker A.K. Proteins. 2001; 42: 38-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (1384) Google Scholar). Indeed, as shown in Fig. 1A, whereas the PAGE4 protein sequence was enriched in polar and charged amino acids such as Gln, Ser, Pro, Glu, and Lys, there was a distinct lack of bulky hydrophobic residues such as Leu, Met, Phe, Trp, and Tyr. Thus, whereas the charged residues constitute ∼53% of the total protein, the hydrophobic residues make up <10% suggesting that PAGE4 may represent an IDP (supplemental Table S1). To further investigate this possibility, we applied two different protein secondary structure prediction algorithms namely, FoldIndex and Regional Order Neural Network (RONN) to discern disorder. FoldIndex developed by Prilusky et al. (28Prilusky J. Felder C.E. Zeev-Ben-Mordehai T. Rydberg E.H. Man O. Beckmann J.S. Silman I. Sussman J.L. Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: 3435-3438Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar) implements the algorithm described by Uversky et al. (40Uversky V.N. Gillespie J.R. Fink A.L. Proteins. 2000; 41: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1783) Google Scholar) to make a calculation based on average net charge and average hydrophobicity of the sequence to predict whether a given sequence is ordered or disordered. In contrast, RONN uses a neural network technique to predict whether any given residue is likely to be ordered or disordered in the context of the surrounding amino acid sequence. Although the physical properties of amino acids are the fundamental basis in determining disorder, the neural network used in RONN avoids explicit parameterization of amino acids in this way. Instead it uses non-gapped sequence alignment to measure “distances” between windows of sequence for the unknown protein and windowed sequences for known folded proteins derived from the Protein Data base (29Yang Z.R. Thomson R. McNeil P. Esnouf R.M. Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: 3369-3376Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). However, both FoldIndex and RONN predicted 100% disorder in the PAGE4 protein structure (Fig. 1, B and C, respectively). To rule out any bias in the algorithms, we also used an additional prediction method namely, metaPrDOS. MetaPrDOS uses a meta approach that does not predict disordered regions from amino acid sequence directly but predicts them by integrating the results of eight different prediction methods (30Ishida T. Kinoshita K. Bioinformatics. 2008; 24: 1344-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Consistent with the previous two algorithms, metaPrDOS also predicted 100% disorder in the PAGE4 protein structure (Fig. 1D). Taken together, these data provided good evidence that PAGE4 is an IDP. To experimentally confirm the extent of disorder, a recombinant form of PAGE4 was produced in bacteria with an estimated molecular weight of 11,153 calculated from the conceptual ORF. However, its mobility in SDS-PAGE suggested a size of 25 kDa (Fig. 2A). Size exclusion chromatography under non-denaturing conditions indicated an apparent molecular mass of 26 kDa and the presence of another species of ∼44 kDa suggesting potential dimerization (Fig. 2, C and D). Such anomalous mobility of IDPs is not uncommon (2Hazy E. Tompa P. ChemPhysChem. 2009; 10: 1415-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In SDS-PAGE, their mobility appears to be retarded because of abnormally low SDS binding to hydrophilic residues in the IDPs and, in size exclusion columns, in contrast to the behavior of globular proteins, they present extended conformations resulting in a larger than expected Stokes radius. Anomalous behavior of the endogenous PAGE4 protein as well as the purified recombinant protein was also confirmed by Western blotting with an anti-PAGE4-specific antibody. As shown in Fig. 2B, the endogenous protein exhibited a molecular mass of ∼30 kDa, whereas that of the recombinant protein was ∼25 kDa. The increase in the weight of the endogenous protein presumably reflects some kind of post-translational modification(s). The structural properties of PAGE4 in aqueous solution were characterized qualitatively using circular dichroism (CD) and NMR spectroscopy. CD spectra were recorded as a function of temperature from 5 to 25 °C (Fig. 3A). These spectra showed that the PAGE4 polypeptide chain contains no significant α-helical or β-strand secondary structural elements over this temperature range as evidenced by low ellipticity values in the 215–230 nm region. One-dimensional 1H NMR spectra displayed a narrow chemical shift dispersion of amide proton signals, with most resonances in the 7.0–8.5 ppm range (Fig. 3B). Narrow dispersion of peaks was also present in the aliphatic methyl region of the spectrum (data not shown). Resonances in the amide and methyl regions of folded proteins are more spread out due to ordered packing effects. Thus, the lack of signal dispersion is strongly indicative of a polypeptide chain with little or no defined tertiary structure. Taken together, the CD and NMR data show that PAGE4 does not have detectable secondary and tertiary structure, consistent with an IDP. The PredictNLS algorithm (31Cokol M. Ozbay F. Rodriguez-Esteban R. EMBO Rep. 2008; 9: 2Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) identified a NLS in the N terminus of PAGE4 (Fig. 1A, underlined) suggesting that PAGE4 can potentially translocate into the nucleus, and the algorithm DBS-Pred (32Ahmad S. Gromiha M.M. Sarai A. Bioinformatics. 2004; 20: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) returned a 99.1% probability that PAGE4 is a DNA-binding protein. Furthermore, the DNA binding region precisely overlapped with the NLS (Fig. 1A, Arg residues are indicated by asterisks above the underline). To confirm the DBS-Pred prediction that PAGE4 indeed binds DNA, we challenged immunopurified PAGE4 protein with a library of 10-mer DNA binding sites as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Indeed, as shown in Fig. 4A, whereas there was no “selection” of a dsDNA binding motif with the GFP protein (lane 1), we observed enrichment of PAGE4 preferential binding sites when the PAGE4-FLAG protein was present (lane 3) as well as FLAG-p53, which was used as a positive control. DNA sequence analysis revealed that PAGE4 preferentially binds to a GC-rich sequence, 5′-GCCGCGGGG-3′ (Fig. 4). Thus, it is possible that PAGE4 is a transcription factor or a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein that is involved in aborting stress-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, in a microarray analysis, Iavarone et al. (26Iavarone C. Wolfgang C. Kumar V. Duray P. Willingham M. Pastan I. Bera T.K. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2002; 1: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) observed that the expression of lipoprotein lipase, a gene frequently deleted in prostate cancer, is down-regulated in a cell line that overexpresses PAGE4. It is thus plausible that PAGE4 could transcriptionally regulate lipoprotein lipase expression in these cells. However, additional experiments are required to uncover its precise function. Up-regulation of several CTAs including PAGE4 is associated with drug resistance in cancer cells (41Cilensek Z.M. Yehiely F. Kular R.K. Deiss L.P. Cancer Biol.

Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 102-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). Each subunit contains a relatively large extracellular domain and four hydrophobic transmembrane segments (M1–M4) connected by loops of varying length and ends with a short extracellular carboxyl terminal domain. Three concentric rings can be distinguished in the AChR transmembrane region (3Barrantes F.J. Curr. Opin. Drug Discov. Devel. 2003; 6: 620-632PubMed Google Scholar). The M2 transmembrane segments of all subunits outline the inner ring and form the walls of the ion channel proper; M1 and M3 constitute the middle ring, and the M4 segments form the outer ring, which is in closer contact with the AChR lipid microenvironment (4Barrantes F.J. Brain Res. Brain. Res. Rev. 2004; 47: 71-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Early studies demonstrated that the function of AChR depends on the immediate lipid environment and specific interactions between membrane protein and lipid molecules. These interactions are purported to be responsible for the maintenance of specific secondary structures required to support the ion channel activity of the AChR (5Fong T.M. McNamee M.G. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 3871-3880Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). AChR internalization in the CHO-K1/A5 clonal cell line and C2C12 muscle cells was recently reported to occur via a novel endocytic mechanism (1Kumari S. Borroni V. Chaudhry A. Chanda B. Massol R. Mayor S. Barrantes F.J. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 181: 1179-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) that does not involve the canonical dynamin, clathrin, or caveolin pathways (6Mayor S. Pagano R.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). This pathway is triggered by ligand binding to the receptor and requires the activity of the small GTPase Rac1 as well as the integrity of the cytoskeleton. Ligand binding to AChR induces autophosphorylation of c-Src kinase with the consequent activation of Rac1 (1Kumari S. Borroni V. Chaudhry A. Chanda B. Massol R. Mayor S. Barrantes F.J. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 181: 1179-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). AChR internalization was also triggered by antibody binding (1Kumari S. Borroni V. Chaudhry A. Chanda B. Massol R. Mayor S. Barrantes F.J. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 181: 1179-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), thus relating the internalization process to other pathological conditions, such as those operative in the autoimmune disease mysthenia gravis (7Appel S.H.

We have recently found that cholesterol (Chol), an endogenous lipid present at the postsynaptic membrane, contributes to the homeostasis of receptor levels at the plasmalemma (9Barrantes F.J. J. Neurochem. 2007; 103: 72-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 10Borroni V. Baier C.J. Lang T. Bonini I. White M.M. Garbus I. Barrantes F.J. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2007; 24: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Chol has been found to be necessary for the formation and maintenance of AChR clusters; Chol depletion induces the fragmentation of these relatively large, micrometer sized AChR assemblies (11Willmann R.

Likewise, the supramolecular organization of the AChR is influenced by Chol levels; Chol depletion increases the dimensions of AChR nanometer sized clusters and changes the long range distribution of nanoclusters at the cell surface (15Kellner R.R. Baier C.J. Willig K.I. Hell S.W. Barrantes F.J. Neuroscience. 2007; 144: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Acceleration of the endocytic internalization of cell surface AChR by Chol depletion (10Borroni V. Baier C.J. Lang T. Bonini I. White M.M. Garbus I. Barrantes F.J. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2007; 24: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) is unusual in that all known endocytic mechanisms are hindered upon diminution of cellular Chol levels (6Mayor S. Pagano R.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). In the present work, we characterize this unusual modulatory effect induced by Chol on cell surface AChR endocytosis. The endocytic mechanism disclosed here consists of the internalization of receptors via a pathway involving the activity of the small GTPase Arf6 and its effectors Rac1 and phospholipase D but independent of the integrity of the actin network. Methyl-β-cyclodextrin (CDx), nystatin, latrunculin A, and cytochalasin D were purchased from Sigma. Alexa Fluor-labeled αBTX and Alexa Fluor-labeled antibodies were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc.

Cohen (Harvard Medical School). None of the plasmids listed affected AChR internalization in cells with normal Chol levels over the period studied (supplemental Fig. 1). Fluorescence transferring and plasmids coding for Rab5-GFP and Rab7-GFP were kindly provided by Dr. J. L. Daniotti (CIQUIBIC, Cordoba, Argentina). CHO-K1/A5 cells were grown in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) for 2–3 days at 37 °C as described previously (16Roccamo A.M. Pediconi M.F. Aztiria E. Zanello L. Wolstenholme A. Barrantes F.J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 1615-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In some experiments, CHO-K1/A5 cells were transiently transfected using Lipofectamine according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Cells were used for fluorescence microscopy 12 h after transfection. CHO-K1/A5 cells were treated with CDx in medium 1 (140 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm KCl in 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4) for 30 min at 37 °C to acutely deplete their Chol content prior to fluorescent labeling as described previously (10Borroni V. Baier C.J. Lang T. Bonini I. White M.M. Garbus I. Barrantes F.J. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2007; 24: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Except for Fig. 1, all experiments were carried out using a final concentration of 15 mm CDx. For Chol replenishment, CDx-Chol complexes were prepared as in Ref. 17Christian A.E. Haynes M.P. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2264-2272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. CHO-K1/A5 cells were incubated with 15 mm Chol·CDx complexes (CDx/Chol ratio 6:1) at 37 °C for 30 min. Lipids were extracted from cell suspensions for 3 h at room temperature in chloroform/methanol/water (1:2:0.8 by volume) following the procedure of Bligh and Dyer (18Bligh E. Dyer W. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42694) Google Scholar). Chol determination was carried out using the colorimetric Colestat kit (Wiener Laboratories, Rosario, Argentina). Cytochalasin D stock solution was made in DMSO, and working solutions were prepared upon dilution of the stock in medium 1. The amount of DMSO was kept below 0.5% (v/v). In order to disrupt the cytoskeletal meshwork, CHO-K1/A5 cells were incubated with 12.5 μm latrunculin A, 2.5 μm cytochalasin D, or 1 μm jasplakinolide together with 15 mm CDx. Treatment of control cells with similar amounts of DMSO did not show alteration of cellular morphology or receptor internalization kinetics (see Fig. 3). Cell surface AChR labeling was carried out by incubating the cells in fluorescent αBTX for 1 h in chilled medium 1 on ice. The cells were then examined with a Nikon Eclipse E-600 microscope. Imaging was done with an SBIG Astronomical Instruments (Santa Barbara, CA) model ST-7 digital charge-coupled device camera (765 × 510 pixels, 9.0 × 9.0-μm pixel size). The ST-7 CCD camera was driven by the CCDOPS software package (version 5.02, SBIG Astronomical Instruments). For all experiments, ×40 (1.0 numerical aperture) or ×60 (1.4 numerical aperture) oil immersion objectives were used. Appropriate dichroic and emission filters were employed to avoid cross-over of fluorescence emission. Eight-bit or 16-bit TIFF images were exported for further off-line analysis. Cells initially labeled with fluorescent αBTX for 1 h at 4 °C were shifted to 37 °C for 30 min in the presence of CDx or medium 1, respectively. Confocal images were obtained with a TCS-SP2 confocal microscope (Leica Mikrosysteme Vertrieb GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany) equipped with an acousto-optical beam splitter. Fluorescence intensities of the 8- or 16-bit image were analyzed after manually outlining regions of interest with the software ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). The average fluorescence intensity of a given region of interest was measured within the αBTX-positive region of the cell, and the average fluorescence intensity of an area of the same size positioned over an αBTX-negative region outside the cell was subtracted. The measurements for each experimental condition were undertaken on randomly chosen cells, selected from phase-contrast images to avoid bias. For illustration purposes, images were processed using Adobe Photoshop, scaled with identical parameters, and pseudocolored according to a custom designed look-up table. Chol content was shown to modulate cell surface AChR levels in the CHO-K1/A5 cell line that heterologously expresses adult muscle-type receptor (10Borroni V. Baier C.J. Lang T. Bonini I. White M.M. Garbus I. Barrantes F.J. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2007; 24: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Chol depletion (Chol−) of these cells with CDx for 30 min at 37 °C accelerates the internalization of AChR in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1, A and B). This acceleration was abolished when cells were enriched in Chol by treatment with 15 mm CDxChol complexes for the same period (Fig. 1). In order to verify whether CDx or its complex with Chol did in fact modify cell membrane Chol content, we monitored changes in the fluorescence of the fluorescent Chol analog fPEG-Chol after treatment with CDx or Chol·CDx. fPEG-Chol is a soluble derivative of Chol that preferentially partitions into Chol-rich membrane domains, thus acting as a Chol sensor in cells (19Sato S.B. Ishii K. Makino A. Iwabuchi K. Yamaji-Hasegawa A. Senoh Y. Nagaoka I. Sakuraba H. Kobayashi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23790-23796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The fluorescent Chol derivative showed the same cell surface pattern as Alexa Fluor647-αBTX. Chol− cells exhibited a marked decrease in cell surface fPEG-Chol fluorescence, and, conversely, an overshoot in fPEG-Chol signal was observed when cells were treated with Chol·CDx (Fig. 1, A and B). It was previously reported that AChR internalization can be induced by agonists (20St. John P.A. Gordon H. J. Neurobiol. 2001; 49: 212-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), antagonist (1Kumari S. Borroni V. Chaudhry A. Chanda B. Massol R. Mayor S. Barrantes F.J. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 181: 1179-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and antibody binding (21Lindstrom J. Einarson B. Muscle Nerve. 1979; 2: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 22Tzartos S.J. Sophianos D. Zimmerman K. Starzinski-Powitz A. J. Immunol. 1986; 136: 3231-3238PubMed Google Scholar, 23Engel A.G. Fumagalli G. Ciba Found. Symp. 1982; 90: 197-224PubMed Google Scholar). Ligand-triggered endocytosis is a sluggish process in CHO cells, occurring in a time course of hours (10Borroni V. Baier C.J. Lang T. Bonini I. White M.M. Garbus I. Barrantes F.J. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2007; 24: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). No internalization of AChR·αBTX complexes is observed within the 30 min time window (Fig. 1C). The effect of CDx treatment was observed when cells were labeled with αBTX before (Fig. 1C) or after (Fig. 1, A and B) Chol depletion. The same result was obtained when cells were exposed to the full nicotinic agonist carbamoylcholine (Fig. 1C, carb) during CDx treatment, indicating that the Chol-associated acceleration of AChR internalization is independent of ligand (the agonist carbamoylcholine or the antagonist αBTX) binding. To further corroborate this observation, we labeled AChR with the specific antibody mAb210, which binds to the main immunogenic region of the AChR α subunit. As shown in Fig. 1C, AChR internalization is triggered by mAb210 binding (Fig. 1C). Chol depletion has an additive effect (Fig. 1C). This series of experiments indicates that Chol depletion accelerates AChR internalization in a ligand- and antibody-independent manner. In order to test the reversibility of the effect of Chol depletion on AChR internalization, cells were first depleted of Chol and, immediately after, replenished with Chol using Chol·CDx complexes. At the end of the incubation period, we monitored the changes in AChR and Chol surface levels (Fig. 2A) as well as the total cellular Chol content (Fig. 2B). As shown above, surface AChR levels decreased when Chol was removed from the membrane (Fig. 1A and Fig. 2A, CDx). However, within the time period studied, internalized AChR did not return to the cell surface even upon restoring Chol levels (Fig. 2, A and B, CDx/CDx-Chol). It is worth noting that cells recover membrane Chol, whereas the level of total Chol remains low (Fig. 2, A and B, CDx/F12). When cell membrane Chol returns to control levels (Fig. 2A, CDx/F12 and CDx/CDx-Chol), AChR is no longer internalized at an accelerated rate (Fig. 2A, CDx/F12 and CDx/CDx-Chol), suggesting that surface membrane Chol is the determining factor that modulates plasmalemmal AChR independently of the total Chol content of the cell. To further test this hypothesis, an additional experiment was devised to specifically affect the availability of Chol at the cell surface. Unlike CDx, the CDx surrogate, nystatin, an antibiotic that binds to and forms complexes with membrane-bound Chol, sequesters the neutral lipid without removing it from the membrane (24de Kruijff B. Gerritsen W.J. Oerlemans A. van Dijck P.W. Demel R.A. van Deenen L.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 339: 44-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). When cells were treated with 50 μg/ml nystatin for 1 h at 37 °C, a ∼25% diminution of cell surface AChR was observed (Fig. 2C). As expected, fPEG-Chol levels were not affected (Fig. 2C). Treatment of CHO-K1/A5 cells with nystatin also resulted in the loss of surface AChR, although its effect was less apparent than in the case of CDx. This series of experiments indicates that membrane Chol is necessary for AChR stability and that it is the disruption of AChR-Chol interactions rather than the physical removal of Chol from the membrane that accelerates AChR endocytosis. CDx treatment has been reported to augment the stability of the submembrane cytoskeleton and in particular the actin meshwork (25Kwik J. Boyle S. Fooksman D. Margolis L. Sheetz M.P. Edidin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 13964-13969Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Previous work from our laboratory showed that AChR nanoclusters (<50 nm in diameter) were randomly distributed at the cell membrane but acquired long range (within a 0.25–1.5-μm radius) order upon Chol depletion (15Kellner R.R. Baier C.J. Willig K.I. Hell S.W. Barrantes F.J. Neuroscience. 2007; 144: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). These observations led us to speculate on the possible involvement of the cytoskeletal meshwork in this process and prompted us to investigate whether the acceleration of AChR endocytosis under Chol− conditions was associated with actin meshwork reorganization. Cells were co-incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with CDx (15 mm) and drugs that inhibit actin polymerization: latrunculin A (12.5 μm), cytochalasin D (2.5 μm) (26Spector I. Shochet N.R. Kashman Y. Groweiss A. Science. 1983; 219: 493-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, 27Cooper J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1473-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1632) Google Scholar), or jasplakinolide (1 μm), a drug that promotes actin polymerization (28Bubb M.R. Spector I. Beyer B.B. Fosen K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5163-5170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 29Bubb M.R. Senderowicz A.M. Sausville E.A. Duncan K.L. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14869-14871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). None of these drugs by themselves exerted any effect on AChR internalization in Chol-depleted cells over the 30-min period tested here. When stained with rhodamine-labeled phalloidin, a probe of filamentous actin, control cells exhibited the characteristic pattern of actin stress fibers, some immediately adjacent to the cell membrane. The corresponding Alexa Fluor647-αBTX fluorescence was observed only at the cell surface in proximity to the actin stress fibers. Upon treatment of cells with CDx (together with the solvent used for all drugs in this series of experiments, DMSO) Alexa Fluor647-αBTX staining was observed in the form of punctuate structures, compatible with endosomes. Internalized AChRs thus lost any proximity relationship with the actin fibers (Fig. 3A). When Chol depletion occurred in the presence of cytochalasin D, actin stress fibers decreased in number and clumped together noticeably, but AChR internalization was not affected (Fig. 3A). Treatment with 12.5 μm latrunculin A produced a massive disruption of the stress fibers, phalloidin staining became punctiform, and cells rounded up (Fig. 3A), but AChR endocytosis proceeded as in control cells (Fig. 3B). As expected, when cells were treated with jasplakinolide, a drug that induces polymerization of monomeric actin into amorphous masses (28Bubb M.R. Spector I. Beyer B.B. Fosen K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5163-5170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), actin did not stain with the fluorescent phalloidin because the two molecules compete for the same binding site on actin fibers (Fig. 2A). Thus, cells treated with CDx together with latrunculin A, cytochalasin D, or jasplakinolide showed the same pattern of AChR internalization as cells treated with CDx alone (Fig. 3A). They also showed the same reduction in AChR surface levels (Fig. 3B), indicating that when cellular Chol levels are reduced, AChR internalization no longer depends on the integrity of the actin cytoskeleton. The presence of accessory receptor-binding proteins in muscle cells, such as rapsyn, increases the stability of the AChR in the membrane (30Gervásio O.L. Armson P.F. Phillips W.D. Dev. Biol. 2007; 305: 262-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 31Bruneau E. Akaaboune M. J. Biol.

Rapsyn is associated with the AChR in a 1:1 stoichiometry and stabilizes the receptor protein by linking it with the cytoskeleton (33Banks G.B. Fuhrer C. Adams M.E. Froehner S.C. J. Neurocytol. 2003; 32: 709-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 35Porter S. Froehner S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10034-10040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Porter S. Froehner S.C. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Because CHO-K1/A5 cells lack rapsyn, it was necessary to discard the possibility that it is the absence of this protein that makes AChR endocytosis sensitive to Chol levels. In order to test this hypothesis, CHO-K1-A5 cells were transfected with a plasmid coding for rapsyn-GFP, and AChR internalization was followed in Chol-depleted cells. Rapsyn-expressing cells (marked with an asterisk in supplemental Fig. 2) showed the same pattern of internalization as control cells. Moreover, the presence of rapsyn did not alter the number of cells that internalized AChRs when treated with CDx (supplemental Fig. 2). These results indicate that the absence of the non-receptor protein rapsyn in CHO cells is not responsible for the sensitivity of AChR internalization to Chol levels. Upon Chol depletion, AChR·αBTX complexes were internalized much faster. To elucidate the nature of the structures intervening in AChR endocytosis under Chol− conditions, we performed co-localization studies with markers of different subcellular compartments. Cells were transiently transfected with plasmids coding for the early endosome marker Rab5-GFP or the late endosome marker Rab7-GFP. Twelve h after transfection, cells were labeled with Alexa Fluor647-αBTX for 1 h at 4 °C, washed with medium 1, and treated with 15 mm CDx for 30 min at 37 °C. At the end of the incubation period, cells were imaged. Some αBTX-AChR labeled endosomes were found to co-localize with Rab5-GFP and Rab7-GFP (Fig. 4, top), making it apparent that the receptor-ligand complex is targeted to an endosomal compartment. αBTX-AChR-labeled endosomes do not colocalize with the lysosome marker LysoTracker during the 30-min incubation, indicating that there is no AChR degradation over this period; no reduction in total AChR levels was observed in Chol− cells up to 1 h (Fig. 4, histogram). AChR·αBTX complexes colocalize with lysosome markers only after this 1-h period (Fig. 4, middle), suggesting that internalized AChRs are targeted to degradation. Once internalized, AChR-containing endosomes do not colocalize with fluorescent transferrin or FITC-dextran over the 30-min incubation period, implying that the entry route followed by AChR in Chol− cells does not overlap with the clathrin- and Cdc42-dependent pathways (Fig. 4, bottom). In order to characterize the mechanism underlying the acceleration of cell surface AChR upon Chol depletion from the membrane, CHO-K1/A5 cells were transiently transfected with the cDNA coding for a dominant negative mutant of dynamin (dynK44A-HA) and a truncated form of Eps15, Eps15Δ95–295-EGFP, which blocks entry of cargo through the clathrin pathway (37Benmerah A.

Mayor S. Barrantes F.J. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 181: 1179-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), neither dynK44A-HA nor Eps15Δ95–295-EGFP expression affected AChR internalization; however, as expected, internalization of fluorescent transferrin was impaired in cells transfected with either plasmid (supplemental Fig. 3). Twelve h after transfection, cells were labeled with Alexa Fluor647-αBTX at 4 °C and submitted to CDx treatment. Transfected cells were identified by EGFP fluorescence in the case of Eps15Δ95–295-EGFP and by HA antigen immunocytochemistry in the case of dynK44A-HA. As shown in Fig. 5, neither Eps15Δ95–295-EGFP nor dynK44A-HA overexpression affected the internalization of AChR induced by Chol depletion, indicating that the accelerated AChR internalization in the Chol− condition does not proceed via the clathrin- or dynamin-dependent mechanisms previously disclosed (1Kumari S.

Arf6 is a member of the Arf (ADP-ribosylation factor) family of GTP-binding proteins. It is localized at the plasma membrane, where it regulates membrane traffic (39Donaldson J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41573-41576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). A clathrin-independent endocytic pathway associated with Arf6 has been described (40Naslavsky N. Weigert R. Donaldson J.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3542-3552Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The next series of experiments was aimed at establishing whether AChR internalization is affected by Arf6 under Chol− conditions. CHO-K1/A5 cells were transiently transfected with a dominant negative (Arf6T27N-HA) or a constitutively active mutant (Arf6Q67L-HA) of Arf6 and submitted to CDx treatment. Overexpression of the Arf6 dominant negative mutant (Arf6T27N-HA) clearly inhibited the acceleration of AChR internalization kinetics typically observed upon Chol depletion. The number of cells that showed augmented CDx-mediated internalization was more than 50% lower. Further corroborating these findings, cells transfected with the dominant active form of Arf6 (Arf6Q67L-HA) showed the same behavior as control cells, indicating that the above results are not an artifact of overexpression (Fig. 6A). In order to evaluate the effect of Arf6 inhibition in more detail, we performed a double labeling protocol. Transfected cells were initially labeled with Alexa Fluor568-αBTX (red) at 4 °C and subsequently exposed for 30 min at 37 °C to CDx or medium 1. At the end of the incubation period, cells were labeled with mAb210 anti-AChR antibody and Alexa Fluor647-secondary antibody (far red). Cells were then fixed, permeabilized, and labeled with anti-HA antibody and Alexa Fluor488-secondary antibody. According to this protocol, red fluorescence represents total AChR present at the cell surface at the beginning of the experiment, and far red fluorescence corr"
https://openalex.org/W2163247648,"Maturation of NOS enzymes requires that they incorporate heme to become active, but how this cellular process occurs is unclear. We investigated a role for chaperone heat shock protein 90 (hsp90) in enabling heme insertion into the cytokine-inducible mouse NOS. We used macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 and human embryonic kidney HEK293T cells and studied insertion of native heme during iNOS expression and insertion of exogenous heme into preformed apo-iNOS. Pulldown experiments showed that the hsp90-iNOS complex was present in cells, but the extent of their association was inversely related to iNOS heme content. Hsp90 was primarily associated with apo-iNOS monomer and was associated 11-fold less with heme-containing iNOS monomer or dimer in cells. Kinetic studies showed that hsp90 dissociation occurred coincident with cellular heme insertion into apo-iNOS (0.8 h–1). The hsp90 inhibitor radicicol or coexpression of an ATPase-defective hsp90 blocked heme insertion into apo-iNOS by 90 and 75%, respectively. The ATPase activity of hsp90 was not required for complex formation with iNOS but was essential for heme insertion to occur. We conclude that hsp90 plays a primary role in maturation of iNOS protein by interacting with the apoenzyme in cells and then driving heme insertion in an ATP-dependent manner.—Ghosh, A., Chawla-Sarkar, M., Stuehr, D.

https://openalex.org/W2063266439,"The major L-type voltage-gated calcium channels in heart consist of an α1C (Ca(V)1.2) subunit usually associated with an auxiliary β subunit (Ca(V)β2). In embryonic cardiomyocytes, both the complete and the cardiac myocyte-specific null mutant of Ca(V)β2 resulted in reduction of L-type calcium currents by up to 75%, compromising heart function and causing defective remodeling of intra- and extra-embryonic blood vessels followed by embryonic death. Here we conditionally excised the Ca(V)β2 gene (cacnb2) specifically in cardiac myocytes of adult mice (KO). Upon gene deletion, Ca(V)β2 protein expression declined by >96% in isolated cardiac myocytes and by >74% in protein fractions from heart. These latter protein fractions include Ca(V)β2 proteins expressed in cardiac fibroblasts. Surprisingly, mice did not show any obvious impairment, although cacnb2 excision was not compensated by expression of other Ca(V)β proteins or changes of Ca(V)1.2 protein levels. Calcium currents were still dihydropyridine-sensitive, but current density at 0 mV was reduced by <29%. The voltage for half-maximal activation was slightly shifted to more depolarized potentials in KO cardiomyocytes when compared with control cells, but the difference was not significant. In summary, Ca(V)β2 appears to be a much stronger modulator of L-type calcium currents in embryonic than in adult cardiomyocytes. Although essential for embryonic survival, Ca(V)β2 down-regulation in cardiomyocytes is well tolerated by the adult mice."

Regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) are GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) for Gi and Gq α-subunits that control the intensity and duration of GPCR signaling. Herein we determined the role of Rgs16 in GPCR regulation of liver metabolism. Rgs16 is expressed during the last few hours of the daily fast in periportal hepatocytes, the oxygen-rich zone of the liver where lipolysis and gluconeogenesis predominate. Rgs16 knock-out mice had elevated expression of fatty acid oxidation genes in liver, higher rates of fatty acid oxidation in liver extracts, and higher plasma β-ketone levels compared with wild type mice. By contrast, transgenic mice that overexpressed RGS16 protein specifically in liver exhibited reciprocal phenotypes as well as low blood glucose levels compared with wild type littermates and fatty liver after overnight fasting. The transcription factor carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP), which induces fatty acid synthesis genes in response to high carbohydrate feeding, was unexpectedly required during fasting for maximal Rgs16 transcription in liver and in cultured primary hepatocytes during gluconeogenesis. Thus, RGS16 provides a signaling mechanism for glucose production to inhibit GPCR-stimulated fatty acid oxidation in hepatocytes.

https://openalex.org/W2034102528,"Sequential processing of the β-amyloid precursor protein by β- and γ-secretase generates the amyloid β-peptide (Aβ), which is widely believed to play a causative role in Alzheimer disease. Selective lowering of the pathogenic 42-amino acid variant of Aβ by γ-secretase modulators (GSMs) is a promising therapeutic strategy. Here we report that mutations in presenilin (PS), the catalytic subunit of γ-secretase, display differential responses to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-type GSMs and more potent second-generation compounds. Although many pathogenic PS mutations resisted lowering of Aβ(42) generation by the NSAID sulindac sulfide, the potent NSAID-like second-generation compound GSM-1 was capable of lowering Aβ(42) for many but not all mutants. We further found that mutations at homologous positions in PS1 and PS2 can elicit differential Aβ(42) responses to GSM-1, suggesting that a positive GSM-1 response depends on the spatial environment in γ-secretase. The aggressive pathogenic PS1 L166P mutation was one of the few pathogenic mutations that resisted GSM-1, and Leu-166 was identified as a critical residue with respect to the Aβ(42)-lowering response of GSM-1. Finally, we found that GSM-1-responsive and -resistant PS mutants behave very similarly toward other potent second-generation compounds of different structural classes than GSM-1. Taken together, our data show that a positive Aβ(42) response for PS mutants depends both on the particular mutation and the GSM used and that attenuated Aβ(42) responses to low potency GSMs can be overcome for many PS mutants by second generation GSMs."

In contrast, the molecular mechanisms underlying the export trafficking of newly synthesized GPCRs from the ER to the cell surface remain largely unknown. It has been well documented that GPCR export to the cell surface involve direct interactions with multiple regulatory proteins such as ER chaperones, accessory proteins, and receptor activity modifying proteins, which may stabilize receptor conformation, facilitate receptor maturation, and promote receptor delivery to the plasma membrane (6Dwyer N.D.

Our studies have shown that the Rab and Sar1/ARF subfamilies play an important role in regulation of GPCR transport from the ER to the cell surface along the secretory pathway. More importantly, the small GTPases Rab1, Rab6, Rab8, and Sar1 are able to selectively or differentially modulate the cell surface transport of GPCRs, suggesting that distinct GPCRs with similar structural features may use different pathways to move to the cell surface en route from the ER and the Golgi (14Wu G.

The GST-fusion proteins were expressed in bacteria and purified using a glutathione-affinity matrix as described previously (18Dong C. Zhang X. Zhou F. Dou H. Duvernay M.T. Zhang P. Wu G. J.

Each batch of fusion protein used in experiments was first analyzed by Coomassie Blue staining following SDS-PAGE. Tubulin purified from bovine brain was reconstituted in general tubulin buffer (G-PEM: 80 mm PIPES, pH 6.9, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 50 mm GTP). Tubulin lacking the acidic CT (tubulin S) was prepared by limited proteolysis of rat tubulin with subtilisin as described (34Rostovtseva T.K. Sheldon K.L. Hassanzadeh E. Monge C. Saks V.

Cytoskeleton. 1999; 43: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). 2 μl of GST fusion proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated with 1 μg of purified tubulin (unless otherwise stated) or tubulin S in G-PEM plus 2% Nonidet P-40 and 100 mm NaCl. 10 μl of GST fusion proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated with 100 μg of rat brain cytosolic extracts in homogenization buffer plus 100 mm NaCl. To determine the effect of salt on the interaction with tubulin, the interaction was carried out in buffer containing increasing concentrations of NaCl from 0 to 400 mm. Incubations were carried out at room temperature for 1 h. The resin was then washed three times with binding buffer. The bound proteins were solubilized in 20 μl of 2× SDS-gel buffer and separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. The bound tubulin was detected by Western blotting with either α-tubulin or β-tubulin specific antibodies. The membranes were stained with Amido Black to confirm equal input of fusion proteins into each reaction. As the concentrations of tubulin and tubulin S in GST pull-down assays was lower than that required for polymerization, both tubulin and tubulin S are likely dimeric, but not polymerized. HEK293 cells cultured on 100-mm dishes were transfected with 2 μg of HA-tagged α2B-AR or its mutant 3R-3A in which Arg-437, Arg-441, and Arg-446 were mutated to Ala for 36 h. The cells were washed twice with PBS, harvested and lysed with 500 μl of lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and Complete Mini protease inhibitor mixture. After gentle rotation for 1 h, samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 14,000 × g and the supernatant was incubated with 50 μl of protein G-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C to remove nonspecific bound proteins. Samples were then incubated with 3 μg of anti-HA antibodies overnight at 4 °C with gentle rotation followed by an incubation with 50 μl of protein G-Sepharose 4B beads for 5 h. Resin was collected by centrifugation and washed three times each with 500 μl of lysis buffer without SDS. Immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted with 100 μl of 1× SDS gel loading buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. α2B-AR and tubulin in the immunoprecipitates were detected by Western blotting using anti-HA and anti-tubulin antibodies, respectively. Cell-surface expression of α2B-AR in HEK293 cells was measured by ligand binding on intact cells using [3H]RX821002 as described previously (30Duvernay M.T. Dong C. Zhang X. Robitaille M. Hébert T.E.

Pharmacol. 2009; 75: 751-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells cultured on 6-well dishes were transfected with α2B-AR or its mutants as described above. After transfection for 6 h the cells were split into 12-well dishes pre-coated with poly-l-lysine at a density of 5 × 105 cells/well. After transfection 48 h, the cells were incubated with [3H]RX821002 at a concentration of 20 nm in a total of 400 μl for 90 min at room temperature. The cells were washed twice with ice-cold DMEM, and the retained radioligand was then extracted by digesting the cells in 300 μl of 1 m NaOH for 2 h. The amount of radioactivity retained was measured by liquid scintillation spectrometry. For measurement of α2B-AR internalization, HEK293 cells were cultured 6-well dishes and transfected with 0.5 μg of α2B-AR and 1 μg of arrestin-3 plus 1 μg of empty pcDNA3.1(-) vector, Arr3-(201–409), DynK44A, or Rab5S34N for 24 h. After starvation for 3 h, the cells were stimulated with epinephrine at a concentration of 100 μm for 1 h. The cells were washed three times with cold PBS and α2B-AR expression at the cell surface was measured by intact cell ligand binding as described above. To determine the effect of drug treatment on the cell surface expression of α2B-AR, HEK293 cell transfected with α2B-AR were incubated with GM132 (20 μm), NH4Cl (20 mm), or chloroquine (100 μm) for 6 h at 37C°. For measurement of α2B-AR expression at the cell surface, HEK293 cells were transfected with HA-tagged receptor for 36–48 h. The cells were collected, suspended in PBS containing 1% FBS at a density of 4 × 106 cells/ml and incubated with high affinity anti-HA-fluorescein (3F10) at a final concentration of 2 μg/ml for 30 min at 4 °C. After washing twice with 0.5 ml of PBS/1% FBS, the cells were resuspended, and the fluorescence was analyzed on a flow cytometer (Dickinson FACSCalibur) as described (30Duvernay M.T. Dong C. Zhang X. Robitaille M. Hébert T.E. Wu G. Traffic. 2009; 10: 552-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). For fluorescence microscopic analysis of α2B-AR subcellular distribution, HEK293 cells were grown on coverslips pre-coated with poly-l-lysine in 6-well plates and transfected with 500 ng of α2B-AR-GFP for 36 to 48 h. For co-localization of α2B-AR with Sec24, HEK293 cells were transfected with 100 ng of α2B-AR-GFP and 400 ng of Sar1H79G. For co-localization of α2B-AR with the ER marker DsRed2-ER, HEK293 cells were transfected with 100 ng of α2B-AR-GFP and 100 ng of pDsRed2-ER. The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde-4% sucrose mixture in PBS for 15 min. The coverslips were mounted, and fluorescence was detected with a Leica DMRA2 epifluorescent microscope. Images were deconvolved using SlideBook software and the nearest neighbor deconvolution algorithm (Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Denver, CO) as described previously (30Duvernay M.T. Dong C. Zhang X. Robitaille M. Hébert T.E. Wu G. Traffic. 2009; 10: 552-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were cultured in 6-well dishes and transfected with 0.5 μg of α2B-AR or its mutant. At 6–8 h after transfection, the cells were split into 6-well dishes and cultured for additional 36 h. The cells were starved for at least 3 h and then stimulated with 1 μm UK14304 for 5 min. Stimulation was terminated by addition of 1× SDS gel loading buffer. After solubilizing the cells, 20 μl of total cell lysates were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE. ERK1/2 activation was determined by measuring the levels of phosphorylation of ERK1/2 with phosphospecific ERK1/2 antibodies by immunoblotting (14Wu G. Zhao G. He Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47062-47069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Differences were evaluated using Student's t test, and p < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. To search for proteins interacting with the α2B-AR CT (Fig. 1A), the CT peptide was synthesized, directly conjugated to agarose beads and incubated with the brain cytosolic extracts. The bound proteins were eluted, separated by two-dimensional gels, and identified by LTQ electrospray mass spectrometry. The most predominant proteins pulled out from the rat brain lysates were tubulin isoforms (Fig. 1B). Western blot analysis using monoclonal α-tubulin-specific antibodies further revealed that tubulin was pulled out by the CT-conjugated agarose matrix. In contrast, a control peptide derived from the ICL3 of α2B-AR did not pull down detectable tubulin from brain lysates (Fig. 1C). We next used GST pull-down assays to confirm the interaction between the α2B-AR CT and tubulin. The GST fusion protein encoding the α2B-AR CT, but not GST, strongly interacted with tubulin from total brain extracts (Fig. 2, A and B). To determine if the α2B-AR CT could directly interact with tubulin, the GST fusion proteins were incubated with increasing concentrations of purified bovine brain tubulin. The GST-α2B-AR CT was able to bind to purified α- and β-tubulin (Fig. 2C). These data indicate that the α2B-AR CT directly interacts with tubulin. Next, we identified specific residues in the α2B-AR CT responsible for interacting with tubulin. In the first series of experiments, each non-basic residue in the CT was mutated to Ala, whereas 5 Arg residues were mutated to Glu together (5R-5E), which will presumably preserve the amphipathic character of the α-helix 8, but reverse the charge on the face of the helix. The abilities of mutated CT to interact with purified tubulin and brain extracts were determined in the GST fusion protein pull-down assay. Mutation of the non-basic residues had variable effects on the affinity of the α2B-AR CT for tubulin, but was insufficient to abolish the interaction. Simultaneous mutation of the 5 Arg residues to Glu, on the other hand, abolished the interaction of the α2B-AR CT with purified tubulin (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, mutation of the 5 Arg residues also markedly inhibited the α2B-AR CT interaction with tubulin from the brain extracts (Fig. 3B). These data indicate that Arg residues are the main determinant of the interaction between the α2B-AR CT and tubulin. In the second series of experiments, each Arg residue in the α2B-AR CT was individually mutated to Glu and the effect on the CT interaction with tubulin was measured. Surprisingly, individual mutation of Arg-437, Arg-441, and Arg-446 or simultaneous mutation of all three Arg residues together almost completely blocked the CT interaction with tubulin, whereas mutation of Arg-438 and Arg-442 only partially inhibited the interaction (Fig. 3C). These data demonstrate that the five Arg residues in the CT unequally contribute to α2B-AR interaction with tubulin, and Arg residues at positions of 437, 441, and 446 play a crucial role in mediating α2B-AR interaction with tubulin. In the third series of experiments, we determined if these Arg residues mediate α2B-AR interaction with tubulin in cells. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with the empty vector (control), HA-tagged α2B-AR or its mutant in which Arg-437, Arg-441, and Arg-446 were mutated to Glu (3R-3E) and their interaction with tubulin was determined by co-immunoprecipitation using anti-HA antibodies. The amount of tubulin was much more in the immunoprecipitates from cells expressing wild-type α2B-AR than from cells expressing α2B-AR mutant 3R-3E and control cells (Fig. 3D). These data suggest that α2B-AR may physically associate with tubulin via C-terminal Arg residues in a cellular context. Our preceding data have identified Arg residues as tubulin binding sites in the α2B-AR CT. To define the α2B-AR binding domain in tubulin, we focused on the CT of tubulin as it is negatively charged containing multiple acidic residues. To determine if the CT of tubulin interacts with α2B-AR, we generated tubulin S in which the CT of tubulin was removed and determined its ability to interact with the α2B-AR CT. GST fusion protein pull-down assay shown that tubulin S did not interact with the α2B-AR CT (Fig. 4A). These data indicate that the CT of tubulin is the α2B-AR binding site. We then determined the effect of increasing concentrations of NaCl on α2B-AR CT interaction with tubulin. The maximal levels of tubulin were pulled down in the incubation buffer containing 0, 5, and 10 mm NaCl. When NaCl concentration was increased beyond 10 mm, the amount of tubulin pulled down dropped sharply until there was almost no tubulin detectable at 400 mm NaCl (Fig. 4B). These data further demonstrate that the interaction between α2B-AR and tubulin is ionic in nature. To determine the role of the interaction between α2B-AR and tubulin, we compared the cell surface expression of α2B-AR with its mutants in which the five Arg residues were mutated to Glu individually or in combination. Mutation of Arg-437, Arg-441, and Arg-446 significantly attenuated the numbers of α2B-AR at the cell surface, whereas mutations of Arg-438 and Arg-442 did not have a clear inhibitory effect. Furthermore, simultaneous mutation of all five Arg residues (5R-5E) (not shown) or three Arg residues at positions 437, 441, and 446 (3R-3E) abolished α2B-AR transport to the cell surface (Fig. 5A). In contrast the cell surface expression, the total α2B-AR expression was very much the same between wild type and mutants (Fig. 5A). These data demonstrate that the positively charged Arg cluster in the CT not only mediates α2B-AR interaction with tubulin but also is required for α2B-AR transport to the cell surface. As the cell surface expression of α2B-AR was measured by intact cell ligand binding, to exclude the possibility that mutation of the C-terminal Arg residues alters the ability of α2B-AR to bind to its ligand, α2B-AR and its mutant 3R-3E were tagged with HA at their N termini and their expression at the cell surface was then measured by flow cytometry following staining with anti-HA antibodies in non-permeabilized cells. Consistent with the data obtained in ligand binding, cell surface expression of the mutant 3R-3E was reduced by 96% as compared with wild-type receptor (Fig. 5B). To eliminate the possibility that attenuated cell surface expression of the α2B-AR mutant 3R-3E is caused by its constitutive internalization induced by the mutation, we determined the effect of transient expression of the dominant negative mutants Arr3-(201–409), DynK44A, and Rab5S34N on the cell-surface expression of the mutant. Arrestin-3, dynamin, and Rab5 have been well demonstrated to modulate endocytic trafficking of GPCRs including α2B-AR (4Wu G. Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Lanier S.M. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2017481900,"Insulin is the key regulator of glucose homeostasis in mammals, and glucose-stimulated insulin biosynthesis is essential for maintaining glucose levels in a narrow range in mammals. Glucose specifically promotes the translation of insulin in pancreatic β-islet, and the untranslated regions of insulin mRNA play a role in such regulation. Specific factors in the β-islets bind to the insulin 5' UTR and regulate its translation. In the present study we identify protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI) as a key regulator of glucose-stimulated insulin biosynthesis. We show that both in vitro and in vivo PDI can specifically associate with the 5' UTR of insulin mRNA. Immunodepletion of PDI from the islet extract results in loss of glucose-stimulated translation indicating a critical role for PDI in insulin biosynthesis. Similarly, transient overexpression of PDI resulted in specific translation activation by glucose. We show that the RNA binding activity of PDI is mediated through PABP. PDI catalyzes the reduction of the PABP disulfide bond resulting in specific binding of PABP to the insulin 5' UTR. We also show that glucose stimulation of the islets results in activation of a specific kinase that can phosphorylate PDI. These findings identify PDI and PABP as important players in glucose homeostasis."

https://openalex.org/W2025487560,"In group B Streptococcus (GBS), 3 structurally distinct types of pili have been discovered as potential virulence factors and vaccine candidates. The pilus-forming proteins are assembled into high-molecular-weight polymers via a transpeptidation mechanism mediated by specific class C sortases. Using a multidisciplinary approach including bioinformatics, structural and biochemical studies, and in vivo mutagenesis, we performed a broad characterization of GBS sortase C1 of pilus island 2a. The high-resolution X-ray structure of the enzyme revealed that the active site, into the β-barrel core of the enzyme, is made of the catalytic triad His157-Cys219-Arg228 and covered by a loop, known as the ""lid."" We show that the catalytic triad and the predicted N- and C-terminal transmembrane regions are required for the enzyme activity. Interestingly, by in vivo complementation mutagenesis studies, we found that the deletion of the entire lid loop or mutations in specific lid key residues had no effect on catalytic activity of the enzyme. In addition, kinetic characterizations of recombinant enzymes indicate that the lid mutants can still recognize and cleave the substrate-mimicking peptide at least as well as the wild-type protein."

Splicing of the CaV1.2 gene in arterial smooth muscle cells of resistance size arteries is more conservative and restricted to three mutually exclusive (exons 1b/c, 21/22, and 31/32) and two alternate (exons 9* and 33) exons (15Cheng X.

Previous studies detected CaV1.2 exon 1b and 1c mRNA in cardiac and cerebral artery smooth muscle cells (15Cheng X. Liu J. Asuncion-Chin M. Blaskova E. Bannister J.P. Dopico A.M. Jaggar J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 29211-29221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). CaV1.2 exon 1c was the primary CaV1.2 mRNA variant in cerebral artery smooth muscle cells, with exon 1a mRNA absent (15Cheng X. Liu J. Asuncion-Chin M. Blaskova E. Bannister J.P. Dopico A.M. Jaggar J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 29211-29221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Cell-specific CaV1.2 splice variation may provide a means by which to selectively target these channels to modify physiological functions. However, although CaV1.2 exon 1 mRNA splicing has been described and the effects on current properties have been studied using recombinant proteins, it is unclear whether CaV1.2 proteins encoded by these splice variants exist in native cells. Furthermore, physiological functions of CaV1.2 exon 1 variants are unclear. Given that arterial smooth muscle cell CaV1.2 channels are a major regulator of vascular contractility, and these channels are associated with vascular pathologies, it is important to investigate physiological functions of splice variants and determine whether targeting these variants modifies vascular contractility. Here, we examined the expression and physiological functions of exon 1-encoded CaV1.2 channel variants in smooth muscle cells of small (<250-μm diameter) cerebral arteries and determined the potential for exon 1 and CaV1.2 N-terminal targeting to modify arterial contractility. Our data indicate that cerebral artery smooth muscle cell CaV1.2 channels contain either exon 1b (CaV1.2e1b) or exon 1c (CaV1.2e1c) encoded N termini. Both of these endogenous CaV1.2 channel N-terminal variants are located primarily in the plasma membrane. shRNA targeting exon 1b or 1c selectively reduced the expression of each variant, leading to vasodilation. Overexpression of exon 1b or 1c peptide sequences did not alter total CaV1.2 channel expression but inhibited CaV1.2 surface trafficking, leading to vasodilation. Our data also indicate that α2δ-1 inserts both CaV1.2 N-terminal variants into the arterial smooth muscle cell plasma membrane but preferentially inserts CaV1.2e1c channels. These data identify physiological functions of native arterial smooth muscle cell CaV1.2e1 variants and indicate that exon 1 targeting induces cerebral artery vasodilation. Antibodies were raised to the previously described peptide sequences encoded by exon 1b (MVNENTRMYVPEENHQG, anti-e1b) or exon 1c (MLCCALDCAC, anti-e1c) (15Cheng X. Liu J. Asuncion-Chin M. Blaskova E.

Chicken IgY protein was further purified from egg yolks in our laboratory using an Eggstract IgY purification system (Promega, Madison, WI). Commercially available rabbit anti-α2δ-1 (Aviva Systems Biology) and rabbit anti-CaV1.2, raised to a conserved sequence (TTKINMDDLQPSENEDKS) in the intracellular loop between repeats II and III (Alomone Labs), were also used. Antigenic peptides that were used to raise anti-e1b and anti-e1c antibodies were spotted at 0.01, 0.05, and 0.1 μg onto nitrocellulose membranes and probed with anti-e1b or anti-e1c antibodies. Reactivity was determined by chemiluminescence (Pierce) from HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. Animal protocols used were reviewed and approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (∼250 g) were euthanized by intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital solution (150 mg/kg). The brain was removed, and resistance size cerebral arteries (posterior cerebral, cerebellar, and middle cerebral, <250 μm) were harvested in physiological saline solution containing 5 mm KCl, 112 mm NaCl2, 24 mm NaHCO3, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.8 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm glucose. HEK293 cells (ATCC) were transfected with full-length pIRES-CaV1.2e1b-hrGFPII or pIRES-CaV1.2e1c-hrGFPII and pcDNA3.1-α2δ-1 and pGW-β1b subunits using the Ca2+ phosphate method. The cells were maintained in DMEM (Cellgro, Manassas, VA) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin in culture (21% O2, 5% CO2 at 37 °C) and used for biochemical experiments 32–72 h after transfection. Transfected cell lysates were obtained in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (Sigma) prior to analysis by Western blotting. pcDNA3.1-α2δ-1 was kindly provided by Dr. Diane Lipscomb (Brown University) and pGW-β1b by Dr. Henry Colecraft (John Hopkins University School of Medicine). Experiments were performed using HEK293 cell lysate, human cerebral artery lysate, or rat cerebral artery lysate. A live human cerebral cortex sample was obtained through National Disease Research Interchange (Philadelphia, PA) using an institutional review board-exempt protocol. Human cerebral arteries were manually dissected from cortex using forceps. Rat cerebral arteries were obtained from 1–2 animals/sample. Human and rat arteries were homogenized in 1× Laemmli buffer containing 2% β-mercaptoethanol to obtain whole arterial lysate. HEK293 cell lysate was obtained using radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Laemmli buffer containing 2% β-mercaptoethanol was added to a final concentration of 1×. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation. Protein concentrations were determined using the method of Henkel and Bieger (21Henkel A.W. Bieger S.C. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 223: 329-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The proteins were separated using SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting. Antibodies used were anti α2δ-1 (Aviva Systems Biology), CaV1.2 (Alomone), anti-e1b, anti-e1c, and actin (Millipore). The bands were visualized on a Kodak Image F-Pro system using a West Pico Chemiluminescence kit (Pierce). For quantification, the protein band intensities were normalized to actin and then to control samples. shRNA sequences designed to CaV1.2 exon 1b (GGATGTACGTTCCAGAGGAAA) or CaV1.2 exon1c (CTCTGCTGTGCTCTGGACTGT) were inserted into the pRNA6.1/Neo vector (Genscript, Piscataway, NJ). shRNA sequences designed to recognize α2δ-1 were the same as those described previously (22Bannister J.P. Adebiyi A. Zhao G. Narayanan D. Thomas C.M. Feng J.Y. Jaggar J.H. Circ. Res. 2009; 105: 948-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). A control vector encoding a scrambled sequence (scrmV, TGCGCGTCCGTTGGTCTCTTA) was also used. Vectors encoding shRNA sequences were inserted into rat cerebral arteries using reverse permeabilization (23Lesh R.E. Somlyo A.P. Owens G.K. Somlyo A.V. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Arteries were then placed into DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 1% penicillin-streptomycin in a sterile culture incubator (21% O2, 5% CO2 at 37 °C) for 4 days, as described previously (24Zhao G. Adebiyi A. Blaskova E. Xi Q. Jaggar J.H. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2008; 295: C1376-C1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The cellular distribution of α2δ-1 and CaV1.2 subunit proteins in intact cerebral arteries was determined using arterial surface biotinylation. Arteries were incubated for 1 h in a 1 mg/ml mixture each of EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-LC-Biotin and EZ-Link Maleimide-PEG2-Biotin reagents (Pierce) in PBS (Invitrogen). Unbound biotin was removed by quenching using 100 mm glycine and washing with PBS. For protein determination, biotinylated arteries were homogenized in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (Sigma), and cellular debris removed by centrifugation. The supernatant comprised the total protein lysate. Total protein concentration was then determined using the method of Henkel and Bieger (21Henkel A.W. Bieger S.C. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 223: 329-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) to allow normalization for avidin (monomeric avidin; Pierce) pull-down of biotinylated surface proteins. Following pulldown, the supernatant comprised the nonbiotinylated (cytosolic) protein fraction, while surface proteins remained bound to the avidin beads. Proteins were eluted from beads by boiling in 1× Laemmli buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol (2%). Total, surface, and cytosolic proteins were analyzed using Western blotting. Band intensity was determined using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Smooth muscle cells were enzymatically dissociated from cerebral arteries, as described previously (25Jaggar J.H. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 281: C439-C448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whole cell patch clamp recordings were acquired at room temperature using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) and pCLAMP 8.2. Borosilicate glass electrodes of resistance 3–6 MΩ were filled with pipette solution containing 135 mmol/liter CsMeSO4, 5 mmol/liter CsCl, 5 mmol/liter EGTA, 4 mmol/liter MgATP, 0.25 mmol/liter NaGTP, 10 mmol/liter HEPES, and 10 mmol/liter glucose (pH 7.2, with CsOH). The extracellular bath solution contained 140 mmol/liter N-methyl-d-glucamine, 1 mmol/liter MgCl2, 10 mmol/liter HEPES, 20 mmol/liter BaCl2, and 10 mmol/liter glucose (pH 7.4, adjusted with aspartate). Isolated cells not visibly attached to neighboring cells were used for patch clamp. Cell capacitance was measured by applying a 5-mV test pulse and correcting transients with series resistance compensation. For measurement of current-voltage (I-V) relationships, the cells were clamped at −80 mV, and whole cell currents were evoked every 5 s by 300-ms step depolarizations to between −80 and +40 mV in 10-mV increments. Whole cell currents were filtered at 1 kHz and digitized at 5 kHz. P/4 protocols were used to subtract leak and capacitive transients. Where applicable, the endothelium was denuded, as described previously (26Adebiyi A. McNally E.M. Jaggar J.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2008; 74: 736-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The diameter of pressurized cerebral arteries was measured by edge detection myography (26Adebiyi A. McNally E.M. Jaggar J.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2008; 74: 736-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Myogenic tone (%) was calculated as 100 × (1 − active diameter/passive diameter). Nucleotide sequences encoding exon 1b or 1c were inserted downstream of EGFP in the pEGFP-N3 vector (Loftstrand Labs, Gaithersburg, MD). EGFP-tagged exon 1b (e1b-EGFP) and exon 1c (e1c-EGFP) constructs were inserted into cerebral arteries using reverse permeabilization (23Lesh R.E. Somlyo A.P. Owens G.K. Somlyo A.V. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Control arteries were mock permeabilized or permeabilized with empty pEGFP-N3 vector as indicated. The arteries were placed into DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 1% penicillin-streptomycin in a sterile culture incubator (21% O2, 5% CO2 at 37 °C). After 2–4 days, the arteries were mounted on rectangular glass cannulae (220 × 40 μm). EGFP was excited at 488 nm, and emission was collected at 510 nm using a Zeiss LSM 510 Pascal laser-scanning confocal microscope. Summary data are presented as the means ± S.E. Significance was determined using analysis of variance followed by Student-Newmann-Keul's post hoc test for multiple groups or paired or unpaired t tests with Welsh correction. p < 0.05 was considered significant. Where p > 0.05, power analysis was performed to verify that sample size gave a value >0.8. Rat cerebral artery smooth muscle cells express two different CaV1.2 mRNA variants spliced at exon 1, termed CaV1.2e1b and CaV1.2e1c (15Cheng X. Liu J. Asuncion-Chin M. Blaskova E. Bannister J.P.

Jaggar J.H. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2009; 297: H680-H688Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Whether CaV1.2e1b and CaV1.2e1c proteins are present in arterial smooth muscle cells is unclear. Custom antibodies (anti-e1b and anti-e1c) were raised to each CaV1.2 exon 1-encoded N-terminal amino acid sequence. The specificity of each antibody was confirmed using a dot blot of antigenic peptides and Western blot analysis of lysates from HEK293 cells transfected with cDNA encoding either CaV1.2e1b or CaV1.2e1c together with α2δ-1 and β1b subunits. Anti-e1b and anti-e1c antibodies selectively detected their respective antigenic peptide (Fig. 1A). Anti-e1b and anti-e1c antibodies also detected recombinant proteins expressed in HEK293 cells with molecular masses of ∼240 and 190 kDa, consistent with long and short CaV1.2 (Fig. 1B). Anti-e1b and anti-e1c antibodies selectively detected CaV1.2e1b and CaV1.2e1c subunit proteins, respectively, and did not detect the other splice variant (Fig. 1B). Anti-e1b and anti-e1c antibodies each detected ∼240- and 190-kDa bands in lysate from resistance size (<250-μm diameter) cerebral arteries (Fig. 1C). A commercially available antibody raised against an amino sequence encoded by exon 18, a site that does not undergo splicing, detected proteins of identical molecular mass in cerebral artery lysate (Fig. 1C). In summary, these data indicate that CaV1.2e1b and CaV1.2e1c proteins are expressed in rat cerebral arteries. Using the same custom antibodies, expression of Cav1.2 subunit N-terminal variants was examined in human small (<250-μm diameter) cerebral arteries. The anonymous donor was a 53-year-old Caucasian male with no history of hypertension. Both the CaV1.2e1b and CaV1.2e1c antibody detected CaV1.2 protein in human cerebral artery lysate (Fig. 1D). These data suggest that CaV1.2 splice variants containing amino acid sequences similar to those encoded by exon 1b and 1c are present in human cerebral arteries. To study physiological functions of CaV1.2e1b and CaV1.2e1c in arterial smooth muscle cells, we used shRNA to suppress expression of each splice variant. Silencing vectors encoding shRNA targeting either exon 1b (e1bshV) or exon 1c (e1cshV) nucleotide sequences or a vector encoding a control scrambled shRNA (scrmV) were inserted intracellularly into cerebral arteries using reverse permeabilization (23Lesh R.E. Somlyo A.P. Owens G.K. Somlyo A.V. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). e1bshV and e1cshV reduced total arterial CaV1.2 subunit protein by ∼20 and 42%, respectively, when compared with scrmV (Fig. 2, A and B). Combining e1bshV and e1cshV further reduced total arterial CaV1.2 protein by ∼73%, when compared with scrmV (Fig. 2, A and B). Reprobing blots with N-terminal variant-specific antibodies revealed that e1bshV reduced CaV1.2e1b protein by ∼35% but increased CaV1.2e1c protein by ∼30%, when compared with scrmV. e1cshV reduced CaV1.2e1c protein by ∼65% but increased CaV1.2e1b protein by ∼18% when compared with scrmV (Fig. 2, A and B). These data indicate that shRNA against exon 1b or 1c reduces expression of the targeted CaV1.2 variant, induces compensatory up-regulation of the other variant, and reduces total CaV1.2 in cerebral arteries. To validate the effects of exon 1 knockdown, voltage-dependent Ca2+ currents (Ba2+ as charge carrier) were measured from myocytes isolated from arteries treated with either scrmV or a combination of e1bshV and e1cshV. Combining e1bshV and e1cshV reduced mean CaV1.2 current density from 14.2 ± 0.2 pA/pF (scrmV) to 4.1 ± 1.2 pA/pF, or by ∼72% (Fig. 2C). This attenuation is similar to the ∼73% reduction in total CaV1.2 channel protein that occurred in arteries treated with both e1bshV and e1cshV (Fig. 2B). The functional significance of targeting CaV1.2 exon 1b or 1c was studied by measuring arterial contractility. Endothelium-denuded cerebral arteries were pressurized to 20 and 60 mm Hg. Pressure-induced vasoconstriction (myogenic tone), depolarization-induced vasoconstriction, induced by an elevation in extracellular K+ (60 mm), and responses to nimodipine, a CaV1.2 channel blocker, were measured. Control (scrmV) arteries developed ∼13% myogenic tone at 20 mm Hg and ∼24% tone at 60 mm Hg (Fig. 3). 60 mm K+ constricted control arteries to ∼40% of passive diameter (Fig. 3). Arteries treated with e1bshV developed ∼33 and ∼34% less tone at 20 and 60 mm Hg, respectively, and the response to 60 mm K+ was reduced by ∼34% (Fig. 3). e1cshV reduced myogenic tone at 20 and 60 mm Hg by ∼43 and ∼57%, respectively, and attenuated the response to 60 mm K+ by ∼58% (Fig. 3). Nimodipine (1 μm) fully dilated pressurized arteries that had been treated with scrmV, e1bshV, or e1cshV, indicating that myogenic tone occurred because of Cav1.2 channel activation (Fig. 3). These data indicate that knockdown of either CaV1.2e1b or CaV1.2e1c reduces intravascular pressure- and depolarization-induced vasoconstriction. α2δ-1 inserts CaV1.2 channels into the cerebral artery smooth muscle cell plasma membrane (22Bannister J.P.

CaV1.2 exon 1 splicing modifies membrane insertion of recombinant channels by α2δ-1 when these proteins are expressed in HEK293 and COS-1 cells (15Cheng X. Liu J. Asuncion-Chin M. Blaskova E.

Given that arterial smooth muscle cells express multiple β subunit isoforms and that the ratio of α2δ-1 to β subunits is unclear, we sought to examine whether α2δ-1 differentially regulates trafficking of endogenous CaV1.2 splice variants (7Sonkusare S.

Therefore, we examined the effects of α2δ-1 knockdown on plasma membrane insertion of CaV1.2 N-terminal splice variants in cerebral arteries. Silencing vectors encoding shRNA specific to α2δ-1 (α2δ-1shV) were used to knock down α2δ-1 in cerebral arteries (22Bannister J.P. Adebiyi A. Zhao G. Narayanan D. Thomas C.M. Feng J.Y. Jaggar J.H. Circ. Res. 2009; 105: 948-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Plasma membrane and intracellular localization of endogenous CaV1.2 subunit N-terminal splice variants and α2δ-1 protein was determined using arterial surface biotinylation (22Bannister J.P. Adebiyi A. Zhao G. Narayanan D. Thomas C.M. Feng J.Y. Jaggar J.H. Circ. Res. 2009; 105: 948-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). α2δ-1shV reduced total α2δ-1 protein by ∼40% and increased total CaV1.2 protein by ∼48% when compared with scrmV control (Fig. 4, A and B). α2δ-1shV also reduced surface localization of α2δ-1 and total CaV1.2 proteins by ∼47 and ∼37%, respectively, when compared with scrmV (Fig. 4C). CaV1.2 subunit N terminus-specific antibodies revealed that α2δ-1shV increased total CaV1.2e1b subunit protein by ∼20% but reduced surface localization of CaV1.2e1b subunit protein by ∼14% (Fig. 4, A–C). α2δ-1shV also increased total CaV1.2e1c subunit protein by ∼33% but reduced surface localization by ∼43% (Fig. 4, A–C). Consistent with these data, α2δ-1shV increased cytoplasmic CaV1.2, CaV1.2e1b, and CaV1.2e1c, when compared with scrmV control (Fig. 4D). These data indicate that α2δ-1 subunits insert both endogenous CaV1.2 N-terminal variants into the cerebral artery smooth muscle cell plasma membrane but preferentially insert the CaV1.2e1c variant. The data indicate that exon 1 splice variation alters CaV1.2 channel plasma membrane insertion. Therefore, we investigated the functional effects of inducing an elevation in CaV1.2 subunit N termini. Vectors encoding either exon 1b or 1c tagged to EGFP (e1b-EGFP and e1c-EGFP) were constructed and inserted into cerebral arteries using reverse permeabilization. To verify that exon 1b and 1c were expressed, transfected arteries were imaged using confocal microscopy. EGFP fluorescence was clearly visible in smooth muscle cells of arteries transfected with e1b-EGFP or e1c-EGFP but was absent in mock transfected control arter"

In association with receptor tyrosine kinases, several downstream mitogen-induced kinases facilitate cell migration. Here, we show a role for c-Jun N-terminal kinase 2 (JNK2) in promoting mammary cancer cell migration through inhibition of epidermal growth factor substrate 8 (EPS8) expression, a key regulator of EGF receptor (R) signaling and trafficking. Using jnk2−/− mice, we found that EPS8 expression is higher in polyoma middle T antigen (PyVMT)jnk2−/− mammary tumors and jnk2−/− mammary glands compared with the respective jnk2+/+ controls. The inverse relationship between the jnk2 and eps8 expression was also associated with cancer progression in that patients with basal-type breast tumors expressing high jnk2 and low eps8 experienced poor disease-free survival. In mammary tumor cell lines, the absence of jnk2 greatly reduces cell migration that is rescued by EPS8 knockdown. Subsequent studies show that JNK2 enhances formation of the EPS8-Abi-1-Sos-1 complex to augment EGFR activation of Akt and ERK, whereas the absence of JNK2 promotes ESP8/RN-Tre association to inhibit endocytotic trafficking of the EGFR.

https://openalex.org/W2086646357,"The ubiquitin (Ub)-conjugating enzymes Ubc4 and Ubc5 are involved in a variety of ubiquitination pathways in yeast, including Rsp5- and anaphase-promoting complex (APC)-mediated pathways. We have found the double deletion of UBC4 and UBC5 genes in yeast to be lethal. To investigate the essential pathway disrupted by the ubc4/ubc5 deletion, several point mutations were inserted in Ubc4. The Ubc4 active site mutation C86A and the E3-binding mutations A97D and F63A were both unable to rescue the lethal phenotype, indicating that an active E3/E2∼Ub complex is required for the essential function of Ubc4/Ubc5. A mutation that specifically eliminates RING E3-catalyzed isopeptide formation but not HECT E3 transthiolation (N78S-Ubc4) rescued the lethal phenotype. Thus, the essential redundant function performed by Ubc4 and Ubc5 in yeast is with a HECT-type E3, likely the only essential HECT in yeast, Rsp5. Our results also suggest that Ubc1 can weakly replace Ubc4 to transfer mono-Ub with APC, but Ubc4 cannot replace Ubc1 for poly-Ub chain extension on APC substrates. Finally, the backside Ub-binding mutant S23R-Ubc4 has no observable effect in yeast. Together, our results are consistent with a model in which Ubc4 and Ubc5 are 1) the primary E2s for Rsp5 in yeast and 2) act as monoubiquitinating E2s in RING E3-catalyzed pathways, in contrast to the processive human ortholog UbcH5."

The bridge helix (BH) is a distinct feature of all multisubunit RNAPs and makes direct interactions with several active site-associated mobile features implicated in the nucleotide addition cycle and RNA and DNA binding. Because the BH has been captured in both kinked and straight conformations in different crystals structures of RNAP, recently supported by molecular dynamics studies, it has been proposed that cycling between these conformations is an integral part of the nucleotide addition cycle. To further evaluate the role of the BH, we conducted systematic alanine scanning mutagenesis of the Escherichia coli RNAP BH to determine its contributions to activities required for transcription. Combining our data with an atomic model of E. coli RNAP, we suggest that alterations in the interactions between the BH and (i) the trigger loop, (ii) fork loop 2, and (iii) switch 2 can help explain the observed changes in RNAP functionality associated with some of the BH variants. Additionally, we show that extensive defects in E. coli RNAP functionality depend upon a single previously not studied lysine residue (Lys-781) that is strictly conserved in all bacteria. It appears that direct interactions made by the BH with other conserved features of RNAP are lost in some of the E. coli alanine substitution variants, which we infer results in conformational changes in RNAP that modify RNAP functionality.

To gain further insights into the contributions the BH makes to RNAP activities, we conducted comprehensive alanine scanning mutagenesis of the BH feature of E. coli RNAP (see Fig. 1B). Mutants were assayed for (i) promoter-specific (i.e. σ-dependent), (ii) nonspecific promoter-independent, and (iii) specific (RNA primer-dependent) promoter-independent transcription activities (see “Experimental Procedures” and Fig. 1C), as well as effects on in vivo growth.

In particular, lysine at position 781, which is invariant in bacteria, appears to be essential in all of the in vitro activities tested. The BH variants that fail in elongation and pyrophosphate-mediated RNA cleavage harbor potential defects in the catalytic activity used for RNA synthesis. BH variants that display significantly reduced in vivo growth activities (in contrast to their observed in vitro activities) could display defects not directly tested by our in vitro assays, e.g. promoter pausing. Finally, two BH variants (V801A and D802A) exhibited severely impaired minimal scaffold-binding activities; we infer that these represent forms of RNAP in which the clamp domain may adopt a more closed conformation.FIGURE 2Summary of the activities of the BH variants.

These background “leak” channels are constitutively active once expressed at the plasma membrane, and hence tight control of their targeting and surface expression is fundamental to the regulation of K+ flux and cell excitability. The chaperone protein, 14-3-3, binds to a critical phosphorylated serine in the channel C termini of K2P3.1 and K2P9.1 (Ser393 and Ser373, respectively) and overcomes retention in the endoplasmic reticulum by βCOP. We sought to identify the kinase responsible for phosphorylation of the terminal serine in human and rat variants of K2P3.1 and K2P9.1. Adopting a bioinformatic approach, three candidate protein kinases were identified: cAMP-dependent protein kinase, ribosomal S6 kinase, and protein kinase C. In vitro phosphorylation assays were utilized to determine the ability of the candidate kinases to phosphorylate the channel C termini. Electrophysiological measurements of human K2P3.1 transiently expressed in HEK293 cells and cell surface assays of GFP-tagged K2P3.1 and K2P9.1 enabled the determination of the functional implications of phosphorylation by specific kinases.

https://openalex.org/W2002071785,"Pax5/B cell lineage specific activator protein (BSAP) is a B lineage-specific regulator that controls the B lineage-specific gene expression program and immunoglobulin gene VH to DJH recombination. Despite extensive studies on its multiple functions, little is known about how the activity of Pax5 is regulated. Here, we show that co-expression of histone acetyltransferase E1A binding protein p300 dramatically enhances Pax5-mediated transcriptional activation. The p300-mediated enhancement is dependent on its intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity. Moreover, p300 interacts with the C terminus of Pax5 and acetylates multiple lysine residues within the paired box DNA binding domain of Pax5. Mutations of lysine residues 67 and 87/89 to alanine within Pax5 abolish p300-mediated enhancement of Pax5-induced Luc-CD19 reporter expression in HEK293 cells and prevent Pax5 to activate endogenous Cd19 and Blnk expression in Pax5−/− murine pro B cells. These results uncover a novel level of regulation of Pax5 function by p300-mediated acetylation.

These results uncover a novel level of regulation of Pax5 function by p300-mediated acetylation. Pax5/BSAP is an important regulator for B lineage cell development (1Cobaleda C. Schebesta A.

It belongs to the PAX family of transcription factors with a highly conserved paired box DNA binding domain (PRD) 2The abbreviations used are: PRD, paired box DNA binding domain; Luc, luciferase; HAT, histone acetyltransferase; CBP, CREB-binding protein.

Biol. 1995; 15: 2858-2871Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The expression of Pax5 is initiated in the common lymphoid progenitor cells, continued through all stages of B lineage cells, and turned off in terminally differentiated plasma cells (1Cobaleda C. Schebesta A. Delogu A. Busslinger M. Nat. Immunol. 2007; 8: 463-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 2Schebesta M. Heavey B. Busslinger M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 216-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Pax5 controls the B lineage cell developmental progress at multiple steps. First, Pax5 activates the transcription of many B lineage-specific genes, such as Cd19, Mb1, Blnk, Ebf1, and Aid (1Cobaleda C. Schebesta A. Delogu A. Busslinger M. Nat. Immunol. 2007; 8: 463-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 2Schebesta M. Heavey B. Busslinger M. Curr. Opin.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2319-2333Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). In Pax5−/− mice, B cell development is blocked at the pro B cell stage (6Urbánek P. Wang Z.Q. Fetka I. Wagner E.F. Busslinger M. Cell. 1994; 79: 901-912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar, 7Nutt S.L. Urbánek P. Rolink A. Busslinger M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 476-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Recent studies showed that Pax5 is responsible for the induction of 170 target genes that encode proteins responsible for multiple functions in B lineage cells (8Schebesta A. McManus S. Salvagiotto G. Delogu A. Busslinger G.A. Busslinger M. Immunity. 2007; 27: 49-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 9Pridans C. Holmes M.L. Polli M. Wettenhall J.M.

Second, Pax5 specifies the B lineage developmental program through repressing the expression of lineage-inappropriate genes, such as Notch1, M-CSFR/c-fms, and Ccl3 (1Cobaleda C. Schebesta A. Delogu A. Busslinger M. Nat. Immunol. 2007; 8: 463-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 11Nutt S.L. Heavey B. Rolink A.G. Busslinger M.

Without these restrictions, Pax5−/− pro B cells are able to differentiate into Natural killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, osteoclasts, granulocytes, or T lineage cells under appropriate conditions (11Nutt S.L. Heavey B. Rolink A.G. Busslinger M. Nature. 1999; 401: 556-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar, 13Rolink A.G. Nutt S.L. Melchers F. Busslinger M. Nature. 1999; 401: 603-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Conditionally deleting Pax5 in mature B cells can lead to de-differentiation to uncommitted progenitors back into the bone marrow and then redevelop into T lineage cells (12Cobaleda C. Busslinger M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2008; 20: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 14Nutt S.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 2008; 358: 82-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Third, Pax5 controls the B lineage differentiation progression through repressing the expression of differentiation stage-inappropriate genes, such as Flt3, Sca-1, Igj, Blimp1, and Cd28 (15Delogu A. Schebesta A. Sun Q. Aschenbrenner K. Perlot T. Busslinger M. Immunity. 2006; 24: 269-281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 16Nera K.P. Kohonen P. Narvi E. Peippo A. Mustonen L. Terho P. Koskela K. Buerstedde J.M. Lassila O. Immunity. 2006; 24: 283-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Loss of Pax5 in avian or murine mature B cells also leads to early expression of plasma cell-specific genes (15Delogu A. Schebesta A. Sun Q. Aschenbrenner K. Perlot T. Busslinger M. Immunity. 2006; 24: 269-281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 16Nera K.P. Kohonen P. Narvi E. Peippo A. Mustonen L. Terho P. Koskela K. Buerstedde J.M. Lassila O. Immunity. 2006; 24: 283-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Last, Pax5 plays an important role in regulation of the B lineage-specific immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (IgH) VH to DJH recombination. In Pax5−/− pro B cells, although the DH to JH recombination occurs normally, rearrangement of most of the upstream VH7183 and VHJ558 genes is severely compromised, except for a few DH-proximal VH7183 genes (7Nutt S.L. Urbánek P. Rolink A. Busslinger M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 476-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 17Hesslein D.G. Pflugh D.L. Chowdhury D. Bothwell A.L. Sen R. Schatz D.G. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Conversely, forced expression of Pax5 transgenes in early T lineage cells can induce the recombination of a few DH-proximal VH7183 genes to the DJH locus (18Fuxa M. Skok J. Souabni A. Salvagiotto G. Roldan E. Busslinger M. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 411-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 19Hsu L.Y. Liang H.E. Johnson K. Kang C. Schlissel M.S. J. Exp.

Immunol. 2005; 6: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that Pax5 is required for histone hypomethylation across the IgH locus (21Johnson K. Pflugh D.L. Yu D. Hesslein D.G. Lin K.I. Bothwell A.L. Thomas-Tikhonenko A. Schatz D.G. Calame K. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 853-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and for contraction of the IgH locus prior to V(D)J recombination (18Fuxa M. Skok J. Souabni A. Salvagiotto G. Roldan E. Busslinger M. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 411-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 20Roldán E. Fuxa M. Chong W. Martinez D. Novatchkova M. Busslinger M. Skok J.A. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), a mechanism that might facilitate the recombination of upstream VHJ558 genes by looping them closer to the DJH locus. Moreover, Pax5 has been found to associate with multiple VH gene coding regions and to interact with the recombination activating gene product (RAG)1/RAG2 protein complexes (22Zhang Z. Espinoza C.R. Yu Z. Stephan R. He T. Williams G.S. Burrows P.D. Hagman J. Feeney A.J. Cooper M.D. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 616-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Through these interactions, Pax5 transactivates RAG-mediated VH to DJH recombination (22Zhang Z. Espinoza C.R. Yu Z. Stephan R. He T. Williams G.S. Burrows P.D. Hagman J. Feeney A.J. Cooper M.D. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 616-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Pax5 interacts with many cellular factors to exert its multiple biological functions. For example, Pax5 forms a ternary complex with Ets-1 and binds to a complex Pax5/Ets binding site on the Mb-1 promoter to fully activate the Mb-1 gene transcription (23Fitzsimmons D. Hodsdon W. Wheat W. Maira S.M. Wasylyk B. Hagman J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2198-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 24Fitzsimmons D. Lutz R. Wheat W. Chamberlin H.M. Hagman J.

Zhang G. Hagman J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8539-8551Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Pax5 interacts with Groucho protein family members of transcriptional co-repressors to repress transcription of target genes (27Eberhard D. Busslinger M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1716s-1724sPubMed Google Scholar, 28Linderson Y. Eberhard D. Malin S. Johansson A. Busslinger M. Pettersson S. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The interaction between DAXX and Pax5 also modulates Pax5-mediated functions in different cell types (29Emelyanov A.V. Kovac C.R. Sepulveda M.A. Birshtein B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11156-11164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). It has been well documented that acetylation of lysine residues within histone tails provides an important regulatory mechanism for transcription along DNA templates packed into the chromatin structure (30Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2356) Google Scholar, 31Yang X.J. Seto E. Mol. Cell. 2008; 31: 449-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). A group of histone acetyltransferases (HATs), including general control of amino acid synthesis 5 (GCN5/KAT2A), E1A binding protein p300 or Ep300 (p300), CREB-binding protein (CBP), p300/CBP-associating factor, and TATA Box Binding protein associated factor (TAFII250), can transfer acetyl groups to the ϵ-NH2 of lysine residues at the N terminus of histones (30Ogryzko V.V.

Cell. 2008; 31: 449-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). Besides histones, HATs can acetylate many other cellular proteins, including transcription factors, to modulate their functions (31Yang X.J. Seto E. Mol. Cell. 2008; 31: 449-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). For example, acetylation of p53, GATA-1, NFκB p50, STAT6, and Runx1 enhances their binding to cognate DNA binding elements and augments their transcriptional activities (32Boyes J. Byfield P. Nakatani Y. Ogryzko V. Nature. 1998; 396: 594-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar, 33Gu W. Roeder R.G.

Conversely, acetylation of Bcl-6 diminishes its DNA binding activity and attenuates Bcl-6-mediated transcriptional repression (37Chen L.F. Williams S.A. Mu Y. Nakano H. Duerr J.M. Buckbinder L. Greene W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 7966-7975Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Acetylation of E2A enhances its transcriptional activation through increasing its nuclear retention (38Bradney C. Hjelmeland M. Komatsu Y. Yoshida M. Yao T.P. Zhuang Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2370-2376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Acetylation of p53 excludes polyubiquitination on the same lysine residue and thus stabilizes p53 proteins by preventing them from proteasome-dependent degradation (39Nakamura S. Roth J.A. Mukhopadhyay T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9391-9398Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In searching for potential regulators for Pax5-mediated function, several lines of evidence led us to explore the functional interaction between Pax5 and p300. It has been shown that CBP and p300 are involved in the regulation of numerous transcription factors in B lineage cells, including Pu.1, E47, EBF, and NF-κB (40Busslinger M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 22: 55-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). In particular, Pax5 interacts with GcN5 and CBP through an adaptor protein, Ada2, and thus recruits GcN5 and CBP as transcriptional co-activators (41Barlev N.A. Emelyanov A.V. Castagnino P. Zegerman P. Bannister A.J. Sepulveda M.A. Robert F. Tora L. Kouzarides T. Birshtein B.K. Berger S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6944-6957Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The requirement of p300 during early B lineage cell commitment and development had been demonstrated in conditional p300 knockout mice (p300flox/flox;Mx-Cre mice) (42Xu W. Fukuyama T. Ney P.A. Wang D. Rehg J. Boyd K. van Deursen J.M. Brindle P.K. Blood. 2006; 107: 4407-4416Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) as well as in mice carrying KIX domain-deleted p300 proteins (p300KIX/KIX mice) (43Kasper L.H. Boussouar F. Ney P.A. Jackson C.W. Rehg J. van Deursen J.M. Brindle P.K. Nature. 2002; 419: 738-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In this study, we focused on the functional interaction between Pax5 and p300. We found that histone acetyltransferase p300 interacts with and acetylates Pax5 and thus acts as a potent co-activator for Pax5. HEK293 or ΦNX cells were maintained in DMEM (Cellgro, Herndon, VA) supplemented with 10% heat-inactive fetal bovine serum, 25 mm HEPES, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Human B lineage EU12 cells, Abelson retroviral transformed mouse pre B 2A cells, and Pax5−/− G5 pro B cells were maintained in RPMI medium (Cellgro) supplemented with 10% heat-inactive fetal bovine serum, 12.5 μm β-mercaptoethanol, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The Luc-CD19 reporter construct and expression vectors for human Pax5, ΔHD, and ΔPRD constructs were kindly provided by the laboratory of Dr. Meinrad Busslinger. The wild-type p300 expression vector was obtained from the laboratory of Dr. Gary Nabel. The p300ΔHAT expression vector was obtained from the laboratory of Dr. Tso-Peng Yao. The Pax5 lysine-to-alanine mutant constructs were generated from the FLAG-Pax5 expression vector by a PCR-based mutagenesis approach using specific primers listed in the supplemental list of oligonucleotide sequences. All the mutant sites were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The coding regions of wild-type Pax5 and different Pax5 lysine-to-alanine mutants were subcloned into the pMI retroviral vectors in front of the Internal Ribosome Entry Site-GFP expression cassette to generate retroviral vectors for recombinant retrovirus production. The Luc-CD19 reporter constructs (0.5 μg) were transfected into HEK293 cells together with different combinations of expression vectors using the Fugene 6 (Roche) reagents following the manufacturer's instructions. A pCMV-Renilla luciferase expression vector (0.01 μg) was always included in each transient transfection to monitor the transfection efficiency. One day after transfection, cells were lysed, and luciferase activities were measured using the dual luciferase assay kit (Promega) on a luminometer (Turner Design or BMG). Nuclear extracts were prepared from EU12, 2A, or G5 cells, or HEK293 cells transiently transfected with different Pax5 constructs as described elsewhere (22Zhang Z. Espinoza C.R. Yu Z. Stephan R. He T. Williams G.S. Burrows P.D. Hagman J. Feeney A.J. Cooper M.D. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 616-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). After preclearance with non-relevant goat or rabbit IgG and protein A/G-agarose beads, immunoprecipitation was performed in HEGN150 buffer (10 mm Hepes, 0.25 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm PMSF) using antibodies specific for Pax5 (N-19 and C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or p300 (C-20, Santa Cruz biotechnology) at 4 °C overnight with slow rotation. EtBr (10 μg/ml) was always included in the immunoprecipitation reaction to avoid nonspecific DNA binding. Immunoprecipitates were collected by additional incubation with protein G-agarose (50 μl) for 30 min. After washing four times with HEGN150 buffer, samples were eluted by boiling with 1× SDS gel loading buffer and analyzed by Western blotting. For detection of the full-length Pax5, monoclonal anti-Pax5 (A11, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used. For detection of different Pax5 truncation products, goat polyclonal anti-Pax5 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), either the C-20 antibody recognizing the C terminus of Pax5 or the N-19 antibody recognizing the N terminus of Pax5, were used. Anti-GST antibody (Sigma) was used to detect the GST fusion Pax5. For Western blotting, the primary antibodies were diluted in Tris-Buffered Saline Tween-20 (TBST) with 5% nonfat dry milk, except for the anti-acetyl lysine antibodies (4G12, Upstate, Lake Placid, NY), which were diluted in TBST (1:200). Bound antibodies were detected using HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies, followed by standard ECL detection procedures. For co-immunoprecipitation assays, Trueblot secondary antibodies (eBioscience, San Diego, CA) were used in co-immunoprecipitation experiments to avoid detection of the immunoprecipitation antibodies. GST fusion full-length Pax5 protein or different Pax5 truncation constructs were expressed and purified from HEK293 cells using glutathione-agarose beads. After extensive washing with HEGN600 buffer (10 mm HEPES, 0.25 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 600 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm PMSF), different GST-Pax5 constructs or GST protein retained on the beads was incubated with purified recombinant p300 (200 ng) (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA) in 30 μl of HEGN150 buffer for 2 h at 4 °C. DNase (0.1 units/ml) and ethidium bromide (10 μg/ml) were included in the binding reaction to reduce nonspecific DNA binding. After washing four times with 1 ml HEGN150 buffer, bound proteins were eluted by boiling in 1× SDS gel loading buffer and analyzed by Western blotting. Tandem mass spectral analyses were performed at the University of Alabama at Birmingham Mass Spectroscopy Core and at the University of Nebraska Medical Center Mass Spectrometry Core Facility. Briefly, GST-Pax5 protein was purified from about 100 × 106 HEK293 cells co-transfected with GST-Pax5 and p300 expression vectors. Purified GST-Pax5 proteins (1–5 μg) were separated on premade SDS-PAGE gels (Bio-Rad) and stained with Coomassie Blue. A single band that correlates with the size of GST-Pax5 protein was excised and subjected to tryptic digestion at 37 °C for 16 h. The resulting peptides were purified and analyzed with the Q-TOF2 mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK) at the University of Alabama at Birmingham or the LTQ Orbitrap XL ETD (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. The obtained results at the University of Alabama at Birmingham were analyzed manually to identify the acetylated peptides derived from the Pax5 protein. The results obtained at the University of Nebraska Medical Center were analyzed by Mascot via automated database searching of Mascot generic format files against the Human IPI protein database version 3.52. For in vitro acetylation assays, purified GST fusion Pax5 (1 μg) from HEK293 cells was incubated with full-length recombinant p300 (Active Motif) in the presence of 5 mm Tris HCl (pH8.0), 1% glycerol, 0.1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm PMSF, 1 mm sodium butyrate, and 12 mm acetyl CoA at room temperature for 1 h with gentle shaking. Reaction samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, and acetylated proteins were detected by monoclonal anti-acetyl-lysine antibodies (4G12, Upstate). Recombinant retroviruses were produced by co-transfection of the retroviral expression vectors together with the pGP and pEco booster vectors into semi-confluent ΦNX packaging cells using the Fugene 6 reagent (Roche). Culture supernatant containing recombinant retroviruses was collected 48 h after transfection and filtered through a 0.45-μm filter. The resulting live viruses were used to transduce Pax5−/− mouse pro B cells with the help of Polybrene (4 μg/ml). The culture medium was changed to Polybrene-free RPMI growth medium the following day. Transduction efficiency was monitored by FACS analysis evaluating the frequency of GFP-positive cells. All Pax5 constructs are expressed together with GFP from a bicistronic RNA transcript. The expression of Pax5 constructs can be tracked by analyzing GFP+ cells. After washing with FACS buffer (PBS supplied with 2% fetal bovine serum), cells (106) were stained with phycoerythin (PE) conjugated anti-mouse CD19 antibodies (BD Biosciences) on ice for 30 min. Cells were washed twice with 1 ml FACS buffer and resuspended in 500 μl FACS buffer containing propidium iodide (1 μg/ml). Samples were analyzed on a FACScalibur (BD Biosciences), and FACS data were analyzed using the Winmid 2.8 software. Pax5−/− pro B cells (G5) were reconstituted with retroviruses expressing wild-type or different mutant Pax5 constructs. The reconstituted (GFP+) cells were purified on a MoFlow FACS sorter (BD Biosciences) and directly collected in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Total RNA was purified following the manufacturer's protocol. First-strand cDNA was synthesized using the Superscript III kit (Invitrogen). The cDNA samples were subjected to real-time PCR analysis on an ABI Prism 7900 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems) using the SYBRGreen PCR master mix (SuperArray). Primers used are listed in the supplemental list of oligonucleotide sequences. The BSAP binding probe, derived from the Pax5 binding site within the Cd19 promoter, was labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 at the 5′ end. Nuclear extracts were prepared from HEK293 cells transiently transfected with expression vectors for the wild-type Pax5 or different lysine-to-alanine mutants without or with co-transfection of p300 expression vectors. Binding reactions were carried out in 20 μl of buffer containing 1 μg/μl poly-dI/dC, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 50 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mg/ml BSA, 0.1 mm DTT, and 0.1 mm PMSF at room temperature for 20 min. Samples were separated on 5% native polyacrylamide gel at 4 °C with Tris borate-EDTA buffer (8.9 mm Tris, 8.9 mm boric acid, 0.2 mm EDTA). Wet gels were directly analyzed with a FluorChemQ Multi Imager III (Alpha Innotech). Pax5/BSAP is a B lineage-specific transcription factor that activates many B lineage-specific genes (40Busslinger M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 22: 55-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it has been shown that histone acetyltransferase p300 plays an important role during early B lineage cell commitment and development (42Xu W. Fukuyama T. Ney P.A. Wang D. Rehg J. Boyd K. van Deursen J.M. Brindle P.K. Blood. 2006; 107: 4407-4416Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 43Kasper L.H. Boussouar F. Ney P.A. Jackson C.W. Rehg J. van Deursen J.M. Brindle P.K. Nature. 2002; 419: 738-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). To explore the potential functional interaction between p300 and Pax5, we performed luciferase reporter assays in HEK293 cells using the Pax5-responsive Luc-CD19 reporter construct with different combinations of the Pax5 and p300 expression vectors. Co-expression of Pax5 with the Luc-CD19 reporter construct in HEK293 cells resulted in a 7–10-fold induction of luciferase activities, which was dramatically enhanced by co-expression of p300 together with Pax5 (60-fold higher than that of the basal level) but not by expression of p300 alone (Fig. 1A). The p300-mediated enhancement is dependent on the level of p300 expression, as shown in a series of transient transfection assays using increasing amounts of p300 expression vectors (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. 1A). Overexpression of p300 did not affect Pax5 protein expression levels in these transient transfection assays (supplemental Fig. 1A). It has been well characterized that p300 possesses intrinsic HAT activity, which is required for its co-activator function (30Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2356) Google Scholar). Therefore, we compared the effects of the wild-type p300 and p300ΔHAT constructs on Pax5-mediated function. In contrast to the wild-type p300, the p300ΔHAT construct failed to enhance Pax5-mediated induction of the Luc-CD19 reporter expression (Fig. 1C), indicating that the p300 HAT activity is required for enhancing Pax5 function. In addition, the p300-mediated enhancement of Pax5 transcriptional activity was further augmented by blocking histone deacetylase activity with trichostatin A treatment (Fig. 1D). Conversely, treatment of transfected cells with anacardic acid to inhibit HAT activity attenuated p300-mediated enhancement (Fig. 1E). The p300-mediated enhancement is dependent on the DNA binding domain and transcriptional activation domain of Pax5 (supplemental Fig. 1B). Taken together, these results show that histone acetyltransferase p300 acts as a transcriptional co-activator for Pax5 and that the intrinsic HAT activity of p300 is essential for enhancing the transcriptional activity of Pax5. It has been shown that Pax5 can recruit histone acetyltransferase CBP and Gcn5 as co-activators for transactional regulation (41Barlev N.A. Emelyanov A.V. Castagnino P. Zegerman P. Bannister A.J. Sepulveda M.A. Robert F. Tora L. Kouzarides T. Birshtein B.K. Berger S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6944-6957Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Next, we performed co-immunoprecipitation assays to determine whether Pax5 interacts with p300. Using anti-p300 antibodies but not the control rabbit IgG, we were able to immunoprecipitate Pax5 from crude nuclear extracts prepared from human B lineage EU12 cells containing endogenous Pax5 and p300 proteins (Fig. 2A). Using anti-Pax5 antibodies, we were also able to immunoprecipitate p300 from HEK293 cells transiently transfected with the Pax5 and p300 expression vectors (Fig. 2B). To further dissect the domains of Pax5 responsible for interaction with p300, we performed co-immunoprecipitation assays using a series of Pax5 truncation constructs transiently expressed in HEK293 cells. Using anti-p300 antibodies, we were able to immunoprecipitate Pax5 and the ΔHD proteins and, to a lesser extent, the ΔB construct. Under the same experimental conditions, we could not detect the ΔC and PRD constructs in immunoprecipitated samples (Fig. 2C). To confirm the physical interaction between Pax5 and p300, we performed GST fusion protein pull-down assays. Different GST fusion Pax5 constructs were expressed and purified from HEK293 cells and used to interact with purified full-length p300 proteins. The p300 proteins can be efficiently pulled down by GST-Pax5, ΔHD, and ΔB constructs but not by the GST-PRD construct (Fig. 2D). These results are consistent with our co-immunoprecipitation results and demonstrate that the C terminus of Pax5 is required for interaction with p300 (Fig. 2E). Originally identified as a histone acetyltransferase, p300 can also acetylate many non-histone proteins, such as transcription factors, to modulate their functions. Next, we analyzed if overexpression of p300 enhances Pax5 acetylation. In our transient transfection, overexpression of p300 resulted in global acetylation of man"

Genetic studies have identified disease-causing mutations in at least 11 different genes (NPHP1–11), but the function of the corresponding nephrocystin proteins remains poorly understood. The two evolutionarily conserved proteins nephrocystin-1 (NPHP1) and nephrocystin-4 (NPHP4) interact and localize to cilia in kidney, retina, and brain characterizing nephronophthisis and associated pathologies as result of a ciliopathy. Here we show that NPHP4, but not truncating patient mutations, negatively regulates tyrosine phosphorylation of NPHP1. NPHP4 counteracts Pyk2-mediated phosphorylation of three defined tyrosine residues of NPHP1 thereby controlling binding of NPHP1 to the trans-Golgi sorting protein PACS-1. Knockdown of NPHP4 resulted in an accumulation of NPHP1 in trans-Golgi vesicles of ciliated retinal epithelial cells. These data strongly suggest that NPHP4 acts upstream of NPHP1 in a common pathway and support the concept of a role for nephrocystin proteins in intracellular vesicular transport.

Pyk2 appears to play an important role in the integration of environmental stimuli and the polarized organization of cytoskeletal components in cell migration (20Okigaki M. Davis C. Falasca M. Harroch S. Felsenfeld D.P. Sheetz M.P. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 10740-10745Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the interaction with NPHP1 increases Pyk2 activity (15Benzing T. Gerke P. Höpker K. Hildebrandt F. Kim E. Walz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 9784-9789Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Here, we report that NPHP4 negatively regulates Pyk2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of NPHP1 by controlling the NPHP1/Pyk2 interaction. Phosphorylation at three defined tyrosine residues increases binding of NPHP1 to the trans-Golgi sorting protein PACS-1 (phosphofurin acidic cluster sorting protein 1). By counteracting this process NPHP4 controls subcellular localization of NPHP1 in human ciliated epithelial cells. Several patient mutations of NPHP4 lost their ability to affect tyrosine phosphorylation of NPHP1 which supports a critical function for NPHP4 and Pyk2 in controlling NPHP1 and the NPH protein complex. NPHP1 and Pyk2 constructs have previously been described (15Benzing T. Gerke P. Höpker K. Hildebrandt F. Kim E. Walz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 9784-9789Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 21Blaukat A. Ivankovic-Dikic I. Grönroos E. Dolfi F. Tokiwa G. Vuori K. Dikic I. J. Biol.

HA-tagged Pyk2 constructs and Src cDNA were kindly provided by Dr. I. Dikic (University of Frankfurt, Germany) and Dr. J. Brugge (Harvard Medical School, Boston). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using a modified QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All plasmids were verified by automated DNA sequencing. Antibodies were obtained from Sigma (anti-FLAG, anti-acetylated tubulin), Santa Cruz (anti-myc, anti-HA, anti-src, pY99), BD Transduction (anti-Pyk2, anti-PY 4G10), Serotec (anti-V5), and Abcam (anti-Pericentrin). Bacterially expressed and affinity-purified His-tagged NPHP112–205 was used to immunize mice following a standard immunization protocol (9Schermer B. Höpker K. Omran H. Ghenoiu C. Fliegauf M. Fekete A. Horvath J. Köttgen M. Hackl M. Zschiedrich S. Huber T.B. Kramer-Zucker A. Zentgraf H. Blaukat A. Walz G. Benzing T. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4415-4424Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Fusions resulted in the generation of more than 30 specific monoclonal antibodies producing hybridome clones. Antibodies were screened with immunofluorescent stainings, immunoblotting, and immunoprecipitation. Protein G columns were used to concentrate the NPHP1-specific antibodies. Specificity was verified again by using bacterially expressed recombinant proteins and cell lysates from transfected cells. HEK293T cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). For transfection experiments, cells were grown until 60–80% confluence and transfected with plasmid DNA using a modified calcium phosphate method as described previously (15Benzing T. Gerke P. Höpker K. Hildebrandt F. Kim E. Walz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 9784-9789Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). hTERT-RPE1 were cultured in a 1:1 mixture of DMEM and Ham's F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mm l-glutamine, and sodium bicarbonate (2.6 g/liter). Cilia formation was induced by serum depletion over 48 h. For siRNA transfection experiments cells were grown until 60–80% confluence and transfected with siRNA to a final concentration of 20 nm using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen). Cy3-labeled control siRNA was transfected in parallel and served as transfection control. siRNAs targeting NPHP4 were directed against the following sequences: CTCGTTATCGCTGTTGCTCAA (siRNA 1), CAGCCGCTTTGTCCATCTCAA (siRNA 2), AAGCAACGAGATGGTGCTACA (siRNA 3), and CAGATCTCGGGTCATCTCAAA (siRNA 4). Control siRNA strands were purchased from Biomers and had the sequences 5′-GUGACACGUUCGGAGAATTAC-3′ and 5′-AATTCTCCGAACGUGUCACGU-3′. For the transfection of cDNA into hTERT-RPE1, GeneJuice (Merck) was used. For the inhibition of tyrosine phosphatases peroxovanadate was prepared as described (22Ruff S.J. Chen K. Cohen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1263-1267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Cultured cells were incubated for 15 min with peroxovanadate (final concentration 0.5 mm). Immunoprecipitations were performed as described (15Benzing T. Gerke P. Höpker K. Hildebrandt F. Kim E. Walz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 9784-9789Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK293T cells were transiently transfected by the calcium phosphate method. After incubation for 24 h, cells were washed twice and lysed in a 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer. After centrifugation (15,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C) and ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C) cell lysates containing equal amounts of total protein were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with the appropriate antibody followed by incubation with 30 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) for ∼1 h. For FLAG tags the lysates were incubated at 4 °C with anti-FLAG (M2) agarose beads (Sigma) for ∼1 h. For evaluation of tyrosine phosphorylation the ultracentrifuge step was omitted, and incubation of the lysate with antibodies and beads was reduced to 30 min. The beads were washed extensively with lysis buffer, and bound proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence after incubation of the blots with the respective antibodies. Experiments were repeated at least three times with identical results. 32P labeling of cells (1–2 mCi/ml for 6–8 h), solubilization, and immunoprecipitation of NPHP1 were done as described previously (23Blaukat A.

After separation of the immunoprecipitated proteins by 10% SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Radiolabeled proteins were detected by PhosphorImager (BAS2000, Fuji) analysis, and tryptic digests were performed as described previously with minor modifications (23Blaukat A. Pizard A. Breit A.

Briefly, membrane pieces containing the 32P-labeled proteins were cut out and blocked with 0.5% polyvinylpyrrolidone 40 in 0.6% acetic acid, for 30 min at 37 °C. Following extensive washes with water, membrane-bound NPHP1 was cleaved in situ with sequencing grade trypsin in 50 mm (NH4)HCO3 for 12 h at 37 °C. Released tryptic peptides were vacuum-dried and oxidized with performic acid for 1 h on ice. Reactions were stopped by dilution with 20% (v/v) ammonia solution. Thereafter, samples were frozen and vacuum-dried, and a second digest was performed for 12 h at 37 °C. Following vacuum drying, samples were dissolved in electrophoresis buffer (formic acid:acetic acid:water, 46:156:1790 (v/v/v)), and phosphopeptides were separated by electrophoresis on cellulose thin layer plates in a first dimension (2000 V, 40 min, electrophoresis buffer) and ascending chromatography in a second dimension (15 h, isobutyric acid, 1-butyl alcohol, pyridine, acetic acid, water, 1250:38:96:58:558 (v/v/v/v/v)). Phosphopeptides were detected by PhosphorImager analysis and eluted from the cellulose matrix with 20% (v/v) acetonitrile in a sonicated water bath for 15 min. Part of the extract (25–100 cpm) was hydrolyzed with 6 m HCl for 1 h at 110 °C and subjected to a phosphoamino acid analysis. The second fraction (50–500 cpm) was sequenced by Edman degradation using a solid phase sequencer (ABI 477). Twenty sequencing cycles were collected, dried, and analyzed for their content of 32P radioactivity using a PhosphorImager. Data obtained from Edman degradation were used to predict phosphorylation sites. The prediction was verified by in vitro mutagenesis of corresponding phosphoacceptor sites. hTERT-RPE1 were seeded on coverslips and cultured as described above. Cilia formation was induced by serum depletion over 48 h (25Pugacheva E.N. Jablonski S.A. Hartman T.R. Henske E.P. Golemis E.A. Cell. 2007; 129: 1351-1363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). After washing with ice-cold PBS, cells were fixed using methanol at −20 °C for 8 min. Cells were washed three times with PBS, and double immunofluorescence staining was performed sequentially with the antibodies as indicated in the absence of Triton X-100. After washing, slides were incubated with the secondary antibody, Cy2-labeled anti-mouse, and Cy3-labeled anti-rabbit IgG, washed again, mounted in ProLong Gold antifade reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen), and subjected to immunofluorescence microscopy with a microscope equipped with the apotome system (Axiovert 200; Carl Zeiss MicroImaging) and the software Axiovision (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging). The appropriate controls were performed without the first and/or second primary antibodies. To test whether Pyk2 not only interacted with but also phosphorylated NPHP1, we co-expressed FLAG-tagged NPHP1 (F.NPHP1) and wild-type Pyk2 (Pyk2wt) or a kinase-dead mutant (Pyk2kd) in transiently transfected HEK293T cells. After serum starvation of the cells for 4 h, the cells were lysed, and NPHP1 was precipitated with anti-FLAG antibody. As described previously, hyperphosphorylated Pyk2 interacted with NPHP1 (15Benzing T. Gerke P. Höpker K. Hildebrandt F. Kim E. Walz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 9784-9789Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Moreover, wild-type Pyk2 but not the kinase-dead mutant of the kinase induced strong tyrosine phosphorylation of NPHP1 (Fig. 1A). To analyze Pyk2-mediated phosphorylation of NPHP1 in more detail, we radioactively labeled NPHP1-expressing cells with 32P in vivo. NPHP1 was precipitated, and the proteins of the precipitate were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted on nitrocellulose membranes. Precipitated NPHP1 was cut out of the membrane, extracted, and phosphoamino acid analysis was performed revealing a strong basal level of serine phosphorylation. In addition to this basal level of phosphorylation, Pyk2-dependent phosphorylation of threonine and tyrosine residues could be detected (Fig. 1B). Surprisingly, co-expression of NPHP4 inhibited the Pyk2-induced phosphorylation of NPHP1 (Fig. 1C), whereas NPHP4 itself was only weakly tyrosine-phosphorylated in presence of Pyk2 (supplemental Fig. 1). To assess the pathophysiological relevance of this finding further we included three known NPHP4 patient mutations in the analysis (26Hoefele J. Sudbrak R. Reinhardt R. Lehrack S. Hennig S. Imm A. Muerb U. Utsch B. Attanasio M. O'Toole J.F. Otto E. Hildebrandt F. Hum. Mutat. 2005; 25: 411Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Disease-causing NPHP4 mutations showed a strongly reduced ability to affect NPHP1 phosphorylation, whereas a truncation of NPHP3, another NPH disease gene product, was nearly without effect (Fig. 1C). Next, we addressed the mechanism by which NPHP4 reduces Pyk2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of NPHP1. V5-tagged versions of NPHP4 were co-expressed with F.NPHP1 and Pyk2, and F.NPHP1 was precipitated and analyzed for tyrosine phosphorylation. Although all truncations of NPHP4 weakened the phosphorylation of NPHP1 and attenuated co-precipitation of Pyk2, full-length NPHP4 and NPHP4304–950 abolished tyrosine phosphorylation and were both sufficient to abrogate co-precipitation of Pyk2. These findings suggest that NPHP4 interferes with the binding of Pyk2 to its substrate NPHP1, thereby decreasing NPHP1-induced activation of Pyk2 and phosphorylation of NPHP1 (Fig. 2A). To investigate whether this NPHP4 truncation interacts with NPHP1, F.NPHP4 or F.NPHP4304–950 and V5-tagged NPHP1 were co-expressed and FLAG-tagged proteins were precipitated. NPHP1 co-precipitated with both wild-type NPHP4 and the truncation (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, NPHP4304–950 contains a proline-rich region. The interaction of NPHP1 and Pyk2 has been mapped to the SH3 domain of NPHP1 and the proline-rich region of Pyk2 (15Benzing T. Gerke P. Höpker K. Hildebrandt F. Kim E. Walz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 9784-9789Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Therefore, it may be tempting to speculate that the two proline-rich regions of Pyk2 and NPHP4 compete for the binding to NPHP1. To identify the phosphorylated tyrosine residues of NPHP1 in vivo, we repeated the 32P labeling experiments and subjected precipitated NPHP1 to a complete tryptic digest. Phosphoamino acid analysis of precipitated NPHP1 revealed several major phosphopeptides (Fig. 3A). Total hydrolysis and phosphoamino acid analysis performed on these spots identified two spots (N1 and N2) as containing exclusively phosphotyrosine, but no phosphorylated serine or threonine residues (data not shown). The major fraction of these peptides was used for solid phase Edman degradation. Comparison with the fragments resulting from in silico tryptic digest identified the peptide fragments, indicating that tyrosines 46 and 349 on NPHP1 were phosphorylated in vivo (Fig. 3B). A third site at position 721 on NPHP1 was predicted to be phosphorylated by Src kinase by Scansite and NetPhos programs. Interestingly, the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Src has been shown to be activated by Pyk2 kinase (21Blaukat A. Ivankovic-Dikic I. Grönroos E. Dolfi F. Tokiwa G. Vuori K. Dikic I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14893-14901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Tyrosine-to-phenylalanine mutation of single residues did not demonstrate an effect on Pyk2-induced phosphorylation of NPHP1 (Fig. 3C). Src-induced tyrosine phosphorylation could be prevented by mutating the tyrosine residue at position 721 to phenylalanine (Fig. 3C, lane 12) suggesting that Src kinase phosphorylates NPHP1 at tyrosine 721. This is supported by the finding that Pyk2 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the NPHP1 Y46F/Y349F double mutant (Fig. 3D). This can be explained by activation of endogenous c-Src kinase by Pyk2 and subsequent phosphorylation of the NPHP1 tyrosine 721. In line with this concept, c-Src induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the NPHP1 Y46F/Y349F double mutant but not of the NPHP1 Y46F/Y349F/Y721F triple mutant (Fig. 3E). In addition, the NPHP1 Y721F mutant showed reduced endogenous tyrosine phosphorylation of NPHP1 (Fig. 3F). The combined mutation of the three tyrosine residues abolished the Pyk2-dependent anti-phosphotyrosine signal (Fig. 3G) completely. We have previously shown that NPHP1 localizes to cilia of kidney epithelial cells (6Otto E.A. Schermer B. Obara T. O'Toole J.F. Hiller K.S. Mueller A.M. Ruf R.G. Hoefele J. Beekmann F. Landau D.

Genet. 2003; 34: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Localization to cilia requires binding of PACS-1 (9Schermer B. Höpker K. Omran H. Ghenoiu C. Fliegauf M. Fekete A. Horvath J. Köttgen M. Hackl M. Zschiedrich S. Huber T.B. Kramer-Zucker A. Zentgraf H. Blaukat A. Walz G. Benzing T. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4415-4424Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). PACS-1 has been identified as a sorting connector, which retrieves membrane-associated proteins to the trans-Golgi Network (27Crump C.M. Xiang Y. Thomas L. Gu F. Austin C. Tooze S.A. Thomas G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2191-2201Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 28Wan L. Molloy S.S. Thomas L. Liu G. Xiang Y. Rybak S.L. Thomas G. Cell. 1998; 94: 205-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). These processes are regulated through casein kinase 2-dependent protein interactions of cargo proteins with PACS-1 (9Schermer B. Höpker K. Omran H. Ghenoiu C. Fliegauf M. Fekete A. Horvath J. Köttgen M. Hackl M. Zschiedrich S. Huber T.B. Kramer-Zucker A. Zentgraf H. Blaukat A. Walz G. Benzing T. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4415-4424Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), a mechanism that has been confirmed for the ciliary membrane protein CNGB1b (cyclic nucleotide-gated channel β1) very recently (29Jenkins P.M. Zhang L. Thomas G. Martens J.R. J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 10541-10551Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To test whether tyrosine phosphorylation of NPHP1 may influence binding of PACS-1, HEK 293T cells were transiently transfected with HA-tagged PACS-1 and FLAG-tagged NPHP1 in the presence of wild-type or a kinase-dead mutant of Pyk2. Co-expression of wild-type Pyk2, but not of the kinase-dead mutant, facilitated the interaction of PACS-1 with NPHP1 (Fig. 4A). Mutation of the Pyk2-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation sites in NPHP1 (Tyr-46, Tyr-349, and Tyr-721) to phenylalanines abrogated the Pyk2-mediated effect on PACS-1 binding, suggesting that this effect was intrinsic to NPHP1 and a result of Pyk2-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of NPHP1 (Fig. 4B) rather than an indirect effect of Pyk2 overexpression. Based on our findings that NPHP4 reduces Pyk2-induced NPHP1 phosphorylation, we speculated that NPHP4 might also influence the interaction of NPHP1 with PACS-1. Strikingly, overexpression of NPHP4 substantially attenuated the interaction between NPHP1 and PACS-1 (Fig. 4C). Still, this NPHP4 effect was also seen in the NPHP1 Y46F/Y349F/Y721F triple mutant, suggesting that NPHP4 affects NPHP1 in multiple ways (Fig. 4D). To test for a role of NPHP4 in controlling NPHP1 localization, we generated novel monoclonal antibodies against the N terminus of NPHP1. The monoclonal antibody detected specifically and exclusively NPHP1 but none of the control proteins (Fig. 5A). Several siRNAs targeting human NPHP4 were tested by co-transfection with FLAG-tagged NPHP4 and a FLAG-tagged control protein. Three of four siRNAs showed efficient knockdown activity against NPHP4 (Fig. 5B). To assess a role for NPHP4 in controlling ciliogenesis and/or NPHP1 trafficking, retinal pigment epithelial cells were transfected with siRNA directed against NPHP4 or with control siRNA. Ciliogenesis was induced by serum withdrawal for 48 h. NPHP1 localization was evaluated using the novel monoclonal antibody alone (data not shown) or in combination with a polyclonal antiserum directed against the basal body and centrosomal marker protein pericentrin (Fig. 5C). Although cells transfected with a negative control siRNA showed a predominant staining of NPHP1 at the ciliary base, transfection of NPHP4 siRNA led to a redistribution of NPHP1 to vesicle-like structures surrounding the basal body (Fig. 5C, upper two panels). To clarify this staining pattern further, we performed co-stainings of NPHP1 with an antiserum against the trans-Golgi protein Golgin-97. These stainings revealed a co-localization of NPHP1 with Golgin-97 (Fig. 5C, bottom panel), suggesting a role of NPHP4 in the regulation of bidirectional NPHP1 trafficking between trans-Golgi and the ciliary base. Interestingly, overexpression of NPHP4 had no obvious effect on NPHP1 localization (supplemental Fig. 2). Taken together, these data indicate that NPHP4 acts upstream of NPHP1 and regulates the localization of NPHP1 at the ciliary base. Mutations affecting the transition zone protein NPHP1 are responsible for >25% of all cases of nephronophthisis, making NPHP1 the most frequently affected single gene in this disease (26Hoefele J. Sudbrak R. Reinhardt R. Lehrack S. Hennig S. Imm A. Muerb U. Utsch B. Attanasio M. O'Toole J.F. Otto E. Hildebrandt F. Hum. Mutat. 2005; 25: 411Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The protein has been shown to form a complex with NPHP4 (8Mollet G. Salomon R. Gribouval O. Silbermann F. Bacq D. Landthaler G. Milford D. Nayir A. Rizzoni G. Antignac C. Saunier S. Nat.

Genet. 2007; 39: 882-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The domain architecture, subcellular localization, and interaction with signaling molecules suggest that NPHP1 and the NPH protein complex are involved in sensory pathways that transmit extracellular signals such as mechanical stress, osmotic or acidic stimuli, or chemosensation to the interior of the cell (32Igarashi P. Somlo S. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 2384-2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 33Watnick T. Germino G. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 355-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is supported by a recent study that showed that the C. elegans homologs of NPHP1 and NPHP4 are expressed in ciliated sensory neurons. nph-1;nph-4 double, but not single-mutant males are response-defective (11Jauregui A.R. Barr M.M. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 305: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), indicating that NPH-1 and NPH-4 play important and redundant roles in facilitating ciliary sensory signal transduction. Recently, NPHP1 and NPHP4 have been shown to interact with the tight junction and polarity proteins PALS1, PATJ, and Par6 in mammalian cells and to be involved in epithelial tight junction formation and the regulation of epithelial morphogenesis (34Delous M. Hellman N.E. Gaudé H.M. Silbermann F. Le Bivic A. Salomon R. Antignac C. Saunier S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2009; 18: 4711-4723Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The NPHP1/4 protein complex includes further signaling and scaffolding proteins such as the tyrosine kinase Pyk2, the adaptor protein p130Cas, the GTPase regulator RPGRIP1, and others (7Olbrich H.

U.S.A. 2005; 102: 18520-18525Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, the function of this protein complex as well as its regulation at the molecular level have remained elusive. In the present study we demonstrate a direct interrelation between the two evolutionarily conserved nephrocystins, NPHP1 and NPHP4, and the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Pyk2. We demonstrate that NPHP4 acts upstream of NPHP1 regulating the tyrosine phosphorylation and subcellular localization of NPHP1 and the interaction with Pyk2 kinase. We have previously demonstrated that the trans-Golgi sorting protein PACS-1 is required for the localization of NPHP1 at the transition zone at the ciliary base (9Schermer B. Höpker K. Omran H. Ghenoiu C. Fliegauf M. Fekete A. Horvath J. Köttgen M. Hackl M. Zschiedrich S. Huber T.B. Kramer-Zucker A. Zentgraf H. Blaukat A. Walz G. Benzing T. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4415-4424Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Our new data now link Pyk2 and NPHP4 to this regulation, as illustrated schematically in supplemental Fig. 3 and demonstrate that in addition to a casein kinase 2-dependent mechanism also tyrosine phosphorylation of NPHP1 enhances the interaction with PACS-1. At this point, the exact molecular mechanism still remains unclear. Because the three tyrosine phosphorylation sites are distributed all along the protein (Tyr-46, Tyr-349, Tyr-721) one can speculate that the addition of negatively charged phosphate groups may induce conformational changes of NPHP1, thus enhancing either the affinity to PACS-1 or the accessibility for casein kinase 2 to the serine residues. To clarify this issue, protein structure determination of full-length NPHP1 and further studies whether PACS-1 binding is regulated by sequential phosphorylation events will be needed. Irrespective of the underlying mechanism NPHP1 binding to the trans-Golgi protein, PACS-1 seems to be tightly regulated by NPHP4, casein kinase 2, and Pyk2. Interestingly, our data reveal that the presence of NPHP4 attenuates the binding of NPHP1 to PACS-1 without impairing the ciliary localization of NPHP1. In contrast, the knockdown of NPHP4 clearly affected the subcellular localization NPHP1 in human RPE cells. This is in accordance with findings in C. elegans, where NPH-4 has been shown to be required for the correct subcellular localization of NPH-1 in ciliated neurons (12Winkelbauer M.E. Schafer J.C. Haycraft C.J. Swoboda P. Yoder B.K. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 5575-5587Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells NPHP1 and NPHP4 are enclosed in one protein complex, and the association of NPHP1 and NPHP4 seems to be very tight.4 Therefore, NPHP4 appears to be the favorite binding partner of NPHP1 and may serve as a molecular anchor to keep NPHP1 at a defined subcellular localization, at the ciliary base. This pool of NPHP4 associated NPHP1 would not be within reach for PACS-1 or Pyk2 in a noteworthy amount. However, after the release of NPHP1 from NPHP4 binding, which in our experiments is mimicked by the knockdown of NPHP4, both Pyk2 and PACS-1 could act to recover NPHP1 to the TGN. A role for PACS-1 in TGN retrieval has previously been described (28Wan L. Molloy S.S. Thomas L. Liu G. Xiang Y. Rybak S.L. Thomas G.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6234-6244Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This model is in accordance with our previous findings, which revealed a vesicular distribution of NPHP1 after addition of a dominant negative PACS-1 mutation (9Schermer B. Höpker K. Omran H. Ghenoiu C. Fliegauf M. Fekete A. Horvath J. Köttgen M. Hackl M. Zschiedrich S. Huber T.B. Kramer-Zucker A. Zentgraf H. Blaukat A. Walz G. Benzing T. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4415-4424Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this is the first study to link nonreceptor tyrosine kinase activity with the function and/or localization of ciliary proteins in mammalian cells. Using the biflagellate algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii as model system, Wang and Snell have shown that flagellar adhesion results in activation of an unknown tyrosine kinase (39Wang Q. Snell W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32936-32942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This activity was inhibited by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein, which also inhibits adhesion-dependent cellular programs (for review, Refs. 40Pan J. Wang Q. Snell W.J. Lab. Invest. 2005; 85: 452-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 41Snell W.J. Pan J. Wang Q. Cell. 2004; 117: 693-697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Although the identity of the Chlamydomonas kinase remains unknown, it is tempting to speculate that Pyk2 may represent one of the mammalian orthologs that are activated in response to ciliary sensing. Pyk2 is a calcium-responsive tyrosine kinase (17Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar). Ciliary calcium signaling in response to mechanical stimuli has been linked to the transient receptor potential channel TRPP2/polycystin-2 that forms part of a pressure sensing protein complex (42Nauli S.M. Alenghat F.J. Luo Y. Williams E. Vassilev P. Li X. Elia A.E. Lu W. Brown E.M. Quinn S.J. Ingber D.E. Zhou J. Nat.

Ciliary signal transduction might therefore induce calcium transients that are transmitted to the calcium-responsive tyrosine kinase Pyk2 to regulate NPHP1 protein interactions. Other factors activating Pyk2 are increased salt concentration and an acidic pH, so one could speculate whether Pyk2 links NPH protein function to these physiological stimuli. Taken together, our data suggest a critical role for NPHP4 in dynamically regulating the Pyk2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of NPHP1 and its targeting to either trans-Golgi network or the ciliary base. Based on the calcium dependence of Pyk2, one can envision a signaling cascade triggered by urine flow and ciliary bending or chemical extracellular stimuli that increases intraciliary or intracellular calcium, activation of Pyk2, phosphorylation of nephrocystin, and subsequent interaction with PACS-1. In this cascade NPHP4 would be a negative regulator by antagonizing Pyk2-induced phosphorylation and decreasing the interaction of NPHP1/PACS-1. This role of NPHP4 in keeping NPHP1 at the ciliary base can now explain the role for NPH-4 in controlling NPH-1 localization in C. elegans (12Winkelbauer M.E. Schafer J.C. Haycraft C.J. Swoboda P.

Yet the fundamental parameters that govern the protein aggregation process and dictate fibril stability/clearance are not well known. As the study of protein folding has been greatly advanced by examining its reverse process (i.e. protein unfolding), the assessment of amyloid fibril disassembly could be valuable not only for determining the parameters that define their formation and stability but also for designing medical/biotechnological strategies to prevent or delay the formation of protein aggregates or to favor the clearance of amyloid deposits. Fibrils, although very stable in vitro, can undergo a continuous “molecular recycling” (25Carulla N. Caddy G.L. Hall D.R. Zurdo J. Gairí M. Feliz M. Giralt E. Robinson C.V. Dobson C.M.

We, thus, hypothesized that under high pressure mature fibrillar PrP structures should dissociate and eventually unfold. To prove this hypothesis, a high pressure and particularly the pressure-jump technique (43Font J. Torrent J. Ribó M. Laurents D.V. Balny C. Vilanova M. Lange R. Biophys.

A rapid increase in pressure forced PrP amyloid fibrils to change irreversibly to a new, less cytotoxic state that was still partly fibrillar but lacked the typical structural features of amyloids. The analysis of the relaxation kinetics toward this new state gave information about the reaction mechanism and the transition state ensemble. The pressure-jump technique proved to be advantageous as 1) it does not require the introduction of a chemical reagent into the sample, 2) pressure propagates nearly instantaneously and homogeneously through the sample, and 3) the activation volumes of the reactions can be measured, thus providing structural (volumetric) information about the kinetic transition state, which cannot be obtained with other experimental approaches. The gene encoding mPrP23–230 (murine full-length recombinant prion protein) was cloned into the pET22b(+) vector (Invitrogen) and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells after isopropyl thio-β-d-galactoside induction. Recombinant PrP accumulated as inclusion bodies. After lysis, sonication, and solubilization of the inclusion bodies by guanidine hydrochloride, purification of PrP was performed essentially as described previously (47Rezaei H. Marc D. Choiset Y. Takahashi M. Hui Bon Hoa G. Haertlé T. Grosclaude J. Debey P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2833-2839Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) using a nickel-Sepharose column. Refolding of the protein was achieved on the column by heterogeneous phase renaturation simultaneously with purification. Purified PrP was recovered in the desired buffer by elution through a G25 desalting column. The final protein concentration was measured by absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 63,495 m−1cm−1. Purified PrP was stored lyophilized. To form amyloid fibrils, PrP stock solutions were prepared immediately before use by resuspending lyophilized PrP in 50 mm MES, pH 6.0. The stock solution was diluted to a final protein concentration of 0.5 mg ml−1 with MES, pH 6.0 (final concentration, 50 mm) and guanidine HCl (final concentration, 2 m). Fibrillation reactions were performed in 1.5-ml conical plastic tubes in a total reaction volume of 0.6 ml at 37 °C with continuous shaking at 600 rpm using a Titramax 100 plate shaker (Heidolph). Fibril formation was monitored using a ThT binding assay (7Breydo L. Makarava N. Baskakov I.V. Methods Mol. Biol. 2008; 459: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Fibrils were dialyzed in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0. Fluorescence measurements were carried out using an Aminco Bowman Series 2 fluorescence-spectrophotometer (SLM Aminco) modified to accommodate a thermostated high pressure optical cell that allowed measurements up to 700 MPa. Dialyzed fibrils were diluted in the same buffer to a final protein concentration of 0.125 mg ml−1 and placed in 5-mm diameter quartz cuvettes closed at the top with flexible polyethylene film that was kept in place by a rubber O-ring. Pressure-jumps consisted of rapid (within 30 s) changes from atmospheric pressure to a range of final pressures of 330–600 MPa. The pressure was then maintained for ∼90 min. A pressurization cycle was then completed by decompression of the sample to atmospheric pressure. Protein disaggregation was followed by monitoring the changes in light-scattering intensity at 300 nm (4 nm slits). ThT (10 μm final concentration) was also used as a probe to measure the extrinsic fluorescence. ThT fluorescence intensity was recorded at 482 nm (16 nm slit) and excited at 385 nm using a 4-nm slit. After each pressure-jump the relaxation profiles of the amyloid structural reaction were fitted to double exponential decays, according to Equation 1,l(t)=l0+A(1−e−kobs(1)t)+B(1−e−kobs(2)t)(Eq.1) where I(t) and I0 are the fluorescence intensities at time t and at time 0, A and B are the phase amplitudes, and kobs is the measured apparent rate constant at the final pressure p. The thermodynamic apparent activation parameters ΔH* and ΔS* were determined by fitting NAkBln(kobs/kobs0) =f(1/T) to Equation 2,NAkBln(kobskobs0)=ΔS*−ΔH*1T(Eq.2) where kobs = 1/τ is the observed rate, kobs0 is the pre-exponential factor for the observed rate corrected for the change in medium viscosity due to change in pressure, NA is Avogadro's number, kB is the Boltzmann factor, and T is the absolute temperature in kelvin. From theory, kobs0 = 1.33kBTcNA(1/η), where c is the molar concentration of PrP protein, and η is the medium viscosity at a given pressure (48Först P. Werner F. Delgado A. Rheologica Acta. 2000; 39: 566-573Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The change in apparent activation volume of the kinetic transition state was determined by fitting RTln(kobs/kobs0) = ΔG* to Equation 3,RTln(kobskobs0)=ΔG*0+ΔV*P(Eq.3) where ΔG*0 is the apparent activation free energy change at atmospheric pressure at a given temperature T. Fluorescence measurements at atmospheric pressure were performed at 20 °C using a FluoroMax-2 fluorimeter (Jobin Yvon-Spex) and a 10 × 2-mm path length rectangular cuvette. Aliquots of soluble PrP, PrP fibrils, and PrP fibrils after pressure treatment were incubated with either 10 μm ThT for 1 min or 50 μm 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonate (ANS) at room temperature for 10 min before monitoring the fluorescence. For ANS spectra, excitation was at 385 nm. ThT emission spectra were recorded after excitation at 450 nm. The excitation and emission slits widths were 4 nm. Each emission spectrum was the average of three scans. Sample preparation was carried out as described (7Breydo L. Makarava N. Baskakov I.V. Methods Mol. Biol. 2008; 459: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Briefly, fibrils were diluted to 0.1 μm using the same buffer and stained with ThT (10 μm) for 3 min. Samples were analyzed with an inverted microscope (Zeiss Axiovert 200M). The emission was isolated from Rayleigh and Raman-shifted light by a GFP filter, with excitation at 455–495 nm, and emission at 505–555 nm. Digital images were acquired using an Axiocam MRm camera (Zeiss). Infrared spectra were measured using a Bruker Tensor 27 FTIR instrument (Bruker Optics). Both untreated and pressure-treated samples were concentrated in 5 mm NaOAc, pD 5.0, to 1.5 mg ml−1 using Nanosep centrifugal devices with a 3-kDa cutoff. For each concentrated sample, 20 μl were loaded into BioATR II cell, and 512 scans were collected at 2 cm−1 resolution under constant purging with nitrogen. Average spectra were corrected for buffer and water vapor. Absorption bands were resolved by Fourier self-deconvolution using Lorentz parameters of 20 cm−1 bandwidth and a noise suppression factor of 0.3. Second derivatives of deconvoluted spectra were calculated using 13-point Savitzky-Golay smoothing. PrP fibrils were concentrated by centrifugation. The fibril pellet was washed twice with 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, and resuspended in the same buffer to a final protein concentration of 50 mg ml−1. The in situ pressure experiments were performed with a diamond anvil cell (DAC) using barium sulfate as an internal pressure calibrant (49Meersman F. Heremans K. Biophys. Chem. 2003; 104: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The pressure was raised to 540 MPa (within 2 min), and subsequently IR spectra were acquired every 5 min. Infrared spectra were recorded on a Bruker IFS66 FTIR spectrometer equipped with a liquid nitrogen-cooled mercury cadmium telluride detector at a nominal resolution of 2 cm−1. Each spectrum was the average of 256 interferograms. The sample compartment was continuously purged with dry air to minimize the spectral contribution of atmospheric water. Samples of PrP fibrils before and after treatment with pressure were 100× diluted with ultrapure water to ∼5 μg ml−1. 5 μl of each sample were left on a freshly cleaved piece of mica at room temperature on the bench until dry. To analyze all the ingredients of fibril solutions, the washing step was omitted. Atomic force microscopy imaging was performed using a Pico LE system (Agilent Technologies). The atomic force microscopy scanner equipped with a silicon cantilever PPP-NCH (Nanosensors) was operated in tapping mode. Images (512 × 512 pixels) were collected at a scan rate of 1.5 lines s−1. Samples were deposited onto Formvar carbon-coated grids, negatively stained with freshly filtered 2% uranyl acetate, dried, and viewed in a JEOL 1200EX2 electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV. To study whether monomeric soluble PrP was present before and after pressure treatment of PrP fibrils, samples were treated with denaturing (60 mm Tris-HCl, 2% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 2.25 m urea, heating for 15 min at 90 °C) and non-denaturing buffer (same buffer but without SDS, β-mercaptoethanol, and urea; no heating). 12% SDS-PAGE gels (Criterion XT precast gel, Bio-Rad) were used for sample analysis. To estimate the amount of soluble protein, fibrils and insoluble aggregates were eliminated by centrifugation at 20,800 × g for 45 min. Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, and Triton X-100 were added to untreated and pressure-treated PrP fibrils to final concentrations of 100 mm and 0.1%, respectively. Aliquots (8 μl, 0.1 mg ml−1 of PrP) were placed in 0.5-ml conical plastic tubes, incubated at 80 °C for 15 min, and cooled down. Fibrils were treated with proteinase K (proteinase K to PrP ratio of 1:100) at 37 °C for 1h. Digestion was stopped by adding PMSF. Samples were heated at 95 °C for 10 min and analyzed on 12% SDS-PAGE gels (Criterion XT precast gel, Bio-Rad) followed by silver staining. Primary cell cultures of neurons were derived from the cerebral cortex of 17.5 E rat embryos. Cells were dissociated by enzymatic incubation in 0.05% trypsin-EDTA and by mechanical dissociation. Cells were resuspended in Neurobasal medium with 2% B27, 0.25% 200 mm glutamine, 1% Glutamax, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin and seeded to a density of 50,000 cells per dish on glass coverslips in 24-well plates previously coated with 10 μg ml−1 poly-d-lysine. Two days later, recombinant PrP isoforms (soluble, fibrils, or pressure-treated fibrils) were added at a final concentration of 1 μm. Separation of pressure-treated fibrils from soluble species was performed by centrifugation at 20,800 × g for 45 min. The pelleted fibrils, resuspended in 10 mm sodium acetate pH 5.0, and the supernatant were added to the cultured cells at a final concentration of 1 μm protein. After 72 h of treatment, the cytotoxic effect of each PrP conformer was analyzed by fixing cells in 4% paraformaldehyde solution and staining with Hoechst 33258. Apoptotic cells were identified by the characteristic nuclear bright blue fluorescence due to condensed or fragmented chromatin. Neurons were identified with primary mouse anti-β-3 tubulin antibodies at 1:400 (Sigma). Secondary antibodies were labeled with Cy3 and diluted 1:400 (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Digital images were captured from 5 random fields for each sample (∼500 cells total) using an Axiovert 200M Zeiss inverted microscope. Neuronal cell death was determined by counting the bright neurons (including those with fragmented or condensed nuclei) and expressed as a percentage of the total neuronal cell number compared with control cultures. Statistical analysis (Student's t test) was carried out on the results of three independent experiments. By applying the method (manual set up) developed by the group of Baskakov and co-workers (7Breydo L. Makarava N. Baskakov I.V. Methods Mol. Biol. 2008; 459: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 50Bocharova O.V. Breydo L. Salnikov V.V. Gill A.C. Baskakov I.V. Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 1222-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), full-length mouse recombinant PrP were converted into amyloid fibrils under partially denaturing solvent conditions (2 m guanidine HCl, pH 6.0) and continuous shaking as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Mature amyloid fibrils were then dialyzed against 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0. To evaluate the effects of pressure on amyloid fibrils, 600 MPa (at 25 °C) was applied using the pressure-jump technique to PrP fibrils. The light-scattering intensity substantially decreased within ∼80 min (Fig. 1), and the initial intensity was not recovered upon depressurization, suggesting that pressurization led to irreversible, partial dissociation of PrP fibrils. The amount of resolubilized PrP rescued from the fibrillar form after the pressure treatment was about 30% that of the entire protein sample, as judged from the absorbance at 280 nm of the supernatants obtained after removing fibrils and insoluble aggregates by centrifugation. In accordance with the light-scattering results, the remaining insoluble fraction appeared to be stable, as an additional cycle of compression/decompression did not affect the balance between aggregated and soluble proteins. Moreover, after a cycle of compression (90 min at 600 MPa, 25 °C) and decompression to atmospheric pressure, the ThT fluorescence emission spectrum of amyloid fibrils was comparable with that of native PrP (Fig. 2A), demonstrating a complete and irreversible loss of their amyloid ThT binding capacity. In line with this observation, after decompression, amyloid fibrils could not be detected by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 2B). Similar results were obtained with the fluorescent dye ANS. Indeed, ANS binding to pressure-treated fibrils resulted only in a minor increase of the fluorescence yield and did not show any evidence of a blue shift in the fluorescence spectrum. Conversely, upon binding to PrP fibrils, the ANS fluorescence spectrum was enhanced and blue-shifted in comparison to the weak fluorescence yield observed after binding to native, soluble PrP (supplemental Fig. S1). To better understand the structural changes induced by pressure, we then measured the kinetics of amyloid fibril structural changes by monitoring ThT fluorescence after fast increases (within 30 s) of pressure to 600 MPa. Each pressure-jump produced double exponential kinetics that consisted of a relatively fast (relaxation time, τfast = 4.2 min) and a slower decay (τslow = 27.8 min), each encompassing about half of the total amplitude (Fig. 3). As shown in Fig. 3A, fitting the data to a mono-exponential decay was not satisfactory. Because both processes were irreversible and the amplitude of the fluorescence reduction did not vary significantly as a function of the pressure, we assumed that the individual rate constants for the backward reaction (k−1),Amyloid state↔k−1k1Dissociated stateReaction 1 associated to the fast and slow phases were negligibly small, such that the relaxation time, τ = (1/kobs), predominantly reflected the inverse of the individual rate constant for the forward reaction τ = (1/k1). The observed pressure-induced structural reactions accelerated when the temperature at which pressure-jumps were applied increased from 15 to 45 °C. Within our experimental temperature range, the Arrhenius plots of the relaxation times for the fast and slow phases were linear (Fig. 3B), with positive apparent activation energies of 72 ± 3 and 64 ± 8 KJ mol−1, respectively. These values suggest that the pressure-induced reaction could be ascribed to a chemical transformation process (47Rezaei H. Marc D. Choiset Y. Takahashi M. Hui Bon Hoa G. Haertlé T. Grosclaude J. Debey P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2833-2839Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Moreover, when the known contribution to binding energies of hydrogen bonds was taken into account (51Pace C.N. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 681-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), these apparent activation energy values pointed to significant conformational remodeling in the kinetic transition state. Then, the free energy barriers associated with the pressure-induced process were estimated from the temperature dependence of the observed rate constants. To this aim, the relative contribution of apparent activation enthalpy and entropy to the rate constants was calculated using Equation 2 (see “Experimental Procedures”). The resulting apparent activation parameters summarized in Table 1 showed that the pressure-induced reaction kinetics was controlled by competition between apparent activation enthalpy and entropy. Furthermore, the pressure-induced structural transition involved a high energy barrier, ΔG*, that accounted for the strong stability of amyloid fibrils at atmospheric pressure and physiological temperature.TABLE 1Thermodynamic activation parametersFast phaseSlow phaseTemperature-dependent kineticsΔH* (kJ mol−1)54.4 ± 2.548.5 ± 3.3ΔS* (J mol−1 K−1)54.9 ± 8.121.4 ± 0.0TΔS*298K(kJ mol−1)16.4 ± 2.46.4 ± 0.0ΔG*298K (kJ mol−1)38.0 ± 3.442.1 ± 3.3Pressure-dependent kinetics>ΔG*0298K (kJ mol−1)48.1 ± 0.854.6 ± 0.8ΔV* (ml mol−1)−18.3 ± 1.7−23.8 ± 1.8ΔG*298K (kJ mol−1)37.1 ± 1.340.3 ± 1.3 Open table in a new tab We performed pressure-jumps of different magnitude within a broad pressure range, with final pressures ranging from 330 to 600 MPa.

https://openalex.org/W2032499645,"RET is a tyrosine kinase receptor involved in numerous cellular mechanisms including proliferation, neuronal navigation, migration, and differentiation upon binding with glial cell derived neurotrophic factor family ligands. RET is an atypical tyrosine kinase receptor containing four cadherin domains in its extracellular part. Furthermore, it has been shown to act as a dependence receptor. Such a receptor is active in the absence of ligand, triggering apoptosis through a mechanism that requires receptor intracellular caspase cleavage. However, different data suggest that RET is not always associated with the cell death/survival balance but rather provides positional information. We demonstrate here that caspase cleavage of RET is involved in the regulation of adhesion in sympathetic neurons. The cleavage of RET generates an N-terminal truncated fragment that functions as a cadherin accessory protein, modifying cadherin environment and potentiating cadherin-mediated cell aggregation. Thus, the caspase cleavage of RET generates two RET fragments: one intracellular domain that can trigger cell death in apoptotic permissive settings, and one membrane-anchored ectodomain with cadherin accessory activity. We propose that this latter function may notably be important for the adequate development of the superior cervical ganglion.

https://openalex.org/W2064376735,"Asn-linked glycosylation is the most ubiquitous posttranslational protein modification in eukaryotes and archaea, and in some eubacteria. Oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) catalyzes the transfer of preassembled oligosaccharides on lipid carriers onto asparagine residues in polypeptide chains. Inefficient oligosaccharide transfer results in glycoprotein heterogeneity, which is particularly bothersome in pharmaceutical glycoprotein production. Amino acid variation at the X position of the Asn-X-Ser/Thr sequon is known to modulate the glycosylation efficiency. The best amino acid at X is valine, for an archaeal Pyrococcus furiosus OST. We performed a systematic alanine mutagenesis study of the archaeal OST to identify the essential and dispensable amino acid residues in the three catalytic motifs. We then investigated the effects of the dispensable mutations on the amino acid preference in the N-glycosylation sequon. One residue position was found to selectively affect the amino acid preference at the X position. This residue is located within the recently identified DXXKXXX(M/I) motif, suggesting the involvement of this motif in N-glycosylation sequon recognition. In applications, mutations at this position may facilitate the design of OST variants adapted to particular N-glycosylation sites to reduce the heterogeneity of glycan occupancy. In fact, a mutation at this position led to 9-fold higher activity relative to the wild-type enzyme, toward a peptide containing arginine at X in place of valine. This mutational approach is potentially applicable to eukaryotic and eubacterial OSTs for the production of homogenous glycoproteins in engineered mammalian and Escherichia coli cells. Asn-linked glycosylation is the most ubiquitous posttranslational protein modification in eukaryotes and archaea, and in some eubacteria. Oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) catalyzes the transfer of preassembled oligosaccharides on lipid carriers onto asparagine residues in polypeptide chains. Inefficient oligosaccharide transfer results in glycoprotein heterogeneity, which is particularly bothersome in pharmaceutical glycoprotein production. Amino acid variation at the X position of the Asn-X-Ser/Thr sequon is known to modulate the glycosylation efficiency. The best amino acid at X is valine, for an archaeal Pyrococcus furiosus OST. We performed a systematic alanine mutagenesis study of the archaeal OST to identify the essential and dispensable amino acid residues in the three catalytic motifs. We then investigated the effects of the dispensable mutations on the amino acid preference in the N-glycosylation sequon. One residue position was found to selectively affect the amino acid preference at the X position. This residue is located within the recently identified DXXKXXX(M/I) motif, suggesting the involvement of this motif in N-glycosylation sequon recognition. In applications, mutations at this position may facilitate the design of OST variants adapted to particular N-glycosylation sites to reduce the heterogeneity of glycan occupancy. In fact, a mutation at this position led to 9-fold higher activity relative to the wild-type enzyme, toward a peptide containing arginine at X in place of valine. This mutational approach is potentially applicable to eukaryotic and eubacterial OSTs for the production of homogenous glycoproteins in engineered mammalian and Escherichia coli cells. N-linked glycosylation is the most ubiquitous posttranslational protein modification in eukaryotes and archaea, and in some eubacteria (1Yan A. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol.

It plays an important role in determining the biological activities of glycoproteins as well as the medicinal efficacy of many pharmaceutical recombinant glycoproteins. The covalent attachment of an oligosaccharide occurs on the side chain of an asparagine residue in a polypeptide chain, within the Asn-X-Ser and Asn-X-Thr sequences, where X is any amino acid except for proline (5Gavel Y. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1990; 3: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar, 6Bause E. Hettkamp H. FEBS Lett. 1979; 108: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). About one-third of the potential N-glycosylation sequons are not glycosylated in extracellular proteins (7Petrescu A.J. Milac A.L. Petrescu S.M. Dwek R.A. Wormald M.R. Glycobiology. 2004; 14: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 8Nita-Lazar M. Wacker M. Schegg B. Amber S. Aebi M.

This fact indicates that the presence of a consensus sequence is essential but not sufficient for N-glycosylation. The percentage of proteins modified at a particular sequon is referred to as “site occupancy.” A recent comprehensive proteome analysis of mouse tissues and blood plasma revealed that more than 98% of N-linked glycosylated peptides derived from glycoproteins were not found in their unmodified form, indicating the high occupancy of N-glycosylation sites (10Zielinska D.F. Gnad F. Wiśniewski J.R. Mann M. Cell. 2010; 141: 897-907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Thus, for most N-glycosylation sequons in vivo, the N-glycan attachment is robust, resulting in a homogeneously glycosylated (100% occupancy) or unglycosylated (0% occupancy) site. In contrast, for some recombinant glycoproteins produced in cultured cells, the N-glycan attachment is variable, resulting in a mixture of various glycoforms, including fully, partially, and unglycosylated protein species (11Jones J. Krag S.S. Betenbaugh M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1726: 121-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). This variation in glycan occupancy is referred to as “macroheterogeneity.” Because the glycan attachment enhances solubility, improves folding, facilitates secretion, and increases the in vivo half-life of glycoproteins, glycosylation isoforms of pharmaceutical glycoproteins, such as Antithrombin III and tissue-type plasminogen activator, have different medicinal efficacies within humans (12Wittwer A.J. Howard S.C. Carr L.S. Harakas N.K. Feder J. Parekh R.B. Rudd P.M. Dwek R.A. Rademacher T.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7662-7669Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 13Picard V. Ersdal-Badju E. Bock S.C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8433-8440Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Therefore, controlling the macroheterogeneity of recombinant glycoproteins is vital in therapeutic glycoprotein production. Oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) 2The abbreviations used are: OST, oligosaccharyltransferase; Agl, archaeal glycosylation; LLO, lipid-linked oligosaccharide; Pgl, protein glycosylation; STT, staurosporine and temperature sensitivity; TAMRA, carboxytetramethylrhodamine. catalyzes the transfer of preassembled oligosaccharides on lipid carriers (lipid-linked oligosaccharides (LLO)) onto asparagine residues in polypeptide chains. The site occupancy is determined by the action of OST in eukaryotic cells. Although little information is available, the situation is probably similar in prokaryotic cells. Thus, the critical factors that affect the site occupancy are the supply of the oligosaccharide donors (LLO), the properties of the polypeptide acceptors, and the activity of the OST enzyme. First, in cultured cells overexpressing a recombinant glycoprotein, the limited supply of LLO induces variable site occupancy. The addition of exogenous intermediate substances is expected to increase the level of N-glycosylation, but it is not always effective because of the complexity of the biosynthetic pathway of LLO (11Jones J. Krag S.S. Betenbaugh M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1726: 121-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Second, the manipulation of the amino acid sequence within a sequon and its flanking residues could improve the efficiency of N-glycosylation. The Asn-X-Thr sequon is always a better acceptor than the Asn-X-Ser sequon (13Picard V. Ersdal-Badju E. Bock S.C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8433-8440Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 14Igura M. Kohda D. Glycobiology. 2011; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 15Kasturi L. Chen H. Shakin-Eshleman S.H. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The amino acid at the X position and those at the other positions adjacent to the sequon also influence the glycosylation efficiency (14Igura M. Kohda D. Glycobiology. 2011; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 15Kasturi L. Chen H. Shakin-Eshleman S.H. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 16Bañó-Polo M. Baldin F.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6833-6837Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Thus, changing the amino acid sequence within and near the N-glycosylation site generating macroheterogeneity is a simple solution, but the outcome is not always predictable because the conformational factors around the sequon also influence the extent of N-glycosylation. The last method involves the custom-tailoring of an OST enzyme by mutagenesis. This provides an ideal solution for a specified target protein without manipulation of its amino acid sequence. Oligosaccharyltransferase is a multisubunit membrane protein complex in higher eukaryotes (2Knauer R. Lehle L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 259-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) but a single-subunit membrane protein in lower eukaryotes, archaea, and eubacteria (20Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 47R-62RCrossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 21Igura M. Maita N. Kamishikiryo J. Yamada M. Obita T. Maenaka K. Kohda D.

Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 3016-3021Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The catalytic subunit of the OST enzymes has a common ancestor but is referred to differently among the three domains of life, as STT3 in eukaryotes, AglB in archaea, and PglB in eubacteria. The primary sequences (600 to 1000 residues) of the STT3/AglB/PglB proteins share a common architecture (23Li L. Woodward R. Ding Y. Liu X.W. Yi W. Bhatt V.S. Chen M. Zhang L.W. Wang P.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2010; 394: 1069-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 24Kim H. von Heijne G. Nilsson I. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20261-20267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). There is a multispan transmembrane region in the N-terminal half of the primary sequence, and the C-terminal half forms a globular domain (Fig. 1). The sequence alignment of the STT3/AglB/PglB protein family members revealed two conserved motifs. A five-residue motif, WWDYG, resides in the C-terminal globular domain, whereas a diacidic motif, DXD or EXD (X denotes any amino acid residue), is found in the first lumenal/extracellular loop of the N-terminal transmembrane region. Mutagenesis studies demonstrated the essential roles of these two motifs in the OST activity of the STT3s from yeast and Leishmania major and PglB from Campylobacter jejuni (21Igura M. Maita N.

Biol. 2005; 12: 1311-1315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In addition to the two motifs, the structure-based sequence alignment revealed a third conserved motif (21Igura M. Maita N. Kamishikiryo J. Yamada M. Obita T. Maenaka K. Kohda D. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 234-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The third motif was classified into three groups, according to the different consensus patterns, DXXKXXX(M/I), DXXMXXX(K/I), and MXXIXXX(I/V/W), which were named DK, DM, and MI, respectively (27Maita N. Nyirenda J. Igura M. Kamishikiryo J. Kohda D. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 4941-4950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Eukaryotic STT3 proteins exclusively contain the DK motif, whereas eubacterial PglB proteins only contain the MI motif. In contrast, archaeal AglB proteins contain either the DK, DM, or MI motif. In vivo mutagenesis studies of the STT3 proteins from yeast and L. major revealed the requirement of the DK motif for survival (21Igura M. Maita N. Kamishikiryo J. Yamada M. Obita T. Maenaka K. Kohda D. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 234-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 28Hese K. Otto C. Routier F.H. Lehle L. Glycobiology. 2009; 19: 160-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). An in vitro mutagenesis study of the C. jejuni PglB protein also confirmed the involvement of the MI motif in the activity (27Maita N. Nyirenda J. Igura M. Kamishikiryo J. Kohda D. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 4941-4950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We developed an in vitro OST assay using recombinant AglB expressed in Escherichia coli membrane fractions. The AglB protein from a hyperthermophilic archaeon, Pyrococcus furiosus, was used to perform a systematic mutagenesis study. We identified a residue position where amino acid replacement induced specific changes in the amino acid preference at the X position of the Asn-X-Thr sequon in peptide substrates. This study highlights the feasibility of creating a single point mutation in OST to optimize its activity toward a given N-glycosylation sequon, which would eventually lead to reduced macroheterogeneity in recombinant glycoproteins. The DNA sequence of P. furiosus AglB (residues 1–967, PF0156, Q8U4D2_PYRFU) was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA using the primers 5′-GCAACTATCCATGGTGAAAACCCAAATAAAGGAG-3′ (NcoI underlined) and 5′-CTCGGATCCTTAATGATGATGATGGTGATGAGGAGCCGATGCAC-3′ (BamHI underlined). The PCR product was digested with NcoI and BamHI and cloned into pET-15b (Novagen) for expression in E. coli cells, with a C-terminal His6 tag. The C-terminal His-His in the original sequence of the P. furiosus AglB was used as part of the His6 tag. Single point mutant variants were generated using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The P. furiosus AglB and its variants were expressed in the E. coli C43(DE3) strain (Lucigen). The transformed E. coli cells were grown at 310 K in LB medium, supplemented with 50 mg l−1 ampicillin. When the A600 reached 0.6, isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. After a 4-h induction at 310 K, the cells were harvested by centrifugation. The cell pellets from a 200-ml LB culture were resuspended in 7.5 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm PMSF, supplemented with complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After cell disruption by sonication, the lysate was centrifuged at 5700 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was ultracentrifuged using a Beckman Coulter Optima TLX ultracentrifuge equipped with a TLA 110 rotor at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 h. The supernatant was discarded and the pellets were stored at −80 °C until use. Each pellet was dissolved in solubilization buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside) and incubated for 1 h at ambient temperature. After ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g, the supernatant was recovered and mixed with nickel-Sepharose high-performance resin (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with the solubilization buffer. The bound proteins were eluted with 300 mm imidazole and pooled for the OST assay. The amount of the AglB protein was quantified by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, with rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against the soluble domain of P. furiosus AglB and goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies labeled with a fluorescent IRDye, 800CW (LI-COR). The fluorescence images were recorded with an Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR) and were quantified using the Odyssey software V3.0. The details of the peptide library and fluorescence labeling were described previously (14Igura M. Kohda D. Glycobiology. 2011; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The peptide concentrations were determined by the absorbance at 555 nm, with an extinction coefficient of 90,000 m−1 cm−1. The two peptides used in the OST assay were custom-synthesized (Hayashi Kasei, Osaka, Japan). The N-terminal carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA) was introduced during the peptide synthesis. The OST assay was performed by the PAGE method (30Kohda D. Yamada M. Igura M. Kamishikiryo J. Maenaka K. Glycobiology. 2007; 17: 1175-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A 2-μl aliquot of crude LLO, prepared from P. furiosus cells as described previously (21Igura M. Maita N. Kamishikiryo J. Yamada M. Obita T. Maenaka K. Kohda D. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 234-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), was transferred to a plastic tube and dried in a SpeedVac concentrator. Eight microliters of buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm DTT, 10 mm MnCl2, 0.02% Tween 20) were added, and the assay tube was sonicated in a bath-type sonicator (120 W) for 5 min. One microliter of 30 μm TAMRA-peptide solution and 3 μl of the E. coli membrane fraction containing the full-length AglB or its mutants was added. The reaction mixture (total 12 μl) was incubated at 65 °C for 1 h. The reaction was stopped by adding 2.4 μl of 5× SDS sample buffer and heating at 95 °C for 1 min. The fluorescence images of the SDS-PAGE gel were recorded with an LAS-3000 multicolor image analyzer (Fuji Photo Film) and were quantified using the ImageGauge software (Fuji Photo Film). The relative acceptor efficiency of an individual sequon in the peptide library experiments is defined as the ratio of the amount of each glycopeptide to the total amount of the 19 glycopeptides. The changes in the amino acid preferences of the OST mutants were evaluated by a correlation analysis between the relative acceptor efficiencies of the wild-type AglB and its mutants. The DNA encoding the full-length AglB gene was amplified from P. furiosus genomic DNA and cloned into the vector pET15b with a C-terminal His tag. The protein was expressed in the membrane fraction of E. coli cells, solubilized with 1% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, and purified by nickel affinity chromatography. To measure the amount of the AglB protein, we performed Western blotting and infrared imaging with fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies (supplemental Fig. S1). The details of the experimental results are provided under “Supplemental Information.” To address the role of the three conserved motifs, WWDYG, DXD, and DK, alanine-scanning mutagenesis was performed. The positions of the mutations in the tertiary structure are shown in Fig. 1. All of the mutant proteins were expressed at levels similar to that of the wild-type protein (supplemental Fig. S1D). The oligosaccharyltransferase activity was measured in the presence of the LLO prepared from P. furiosus cells as the oligosaccharide donor and a synthetic eight-residue peptide containing the N-glycosylation consensus as the oligosaccharide acceptor (Fig. 2A). The peptide consists of the optimized amino acid sequence (14Igura M. Kohda D. Glycobiology. 2011; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) and contains a fluorescent dye at the N terminus. The generated glycopeptides were separated from the unmodified peptides by SDS-PAGE and quantified by fluorescence imaging (30Kohda D. Yamada M. Igura M. Kamishikiryo J. Maenaka K. Glycobiology. 2007; 17: 1175-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The specific activity was defined as the amount of glycopeptide formed (fmol) per hour per unit amount of protein defined by infrared imaging (see details in supplemental Fig. S2). The substitution of each aspartate residue in the DXD and WWDYG motifs led to a nearly complete loss of the activity (Fig. 2B). The substitution of each of the tryptophan residues in the WWDYG motif also impaired the enzymatic activity. The mutations of the tyrosine and glycine in the WWDYG motif had an inhibitory effect. The mutations of the three signature residues in the DK motif, Asp-571, Lys-574, and Ile-578, also had an inhibitory effect on the OST activity. These results confirmed the vital contribution of the three conserved motifs to the catalytic function of the archaeal OST. We compared the substrate specificity of the mutant AglBs with that of the wild-type AglB by examining the amino acid preference at the X position of the Asn-X-Thr sequon in the peptide substrates. We prepared a peptide library, sharing a common sequence, Cys-Arg-Gly-Asn-X-Thr-Ala-Arg (14Igura M. Kohda D. Glycobiology. 2011; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). A fluorescent dye was appended to the side chain of the N-terminal cysteine for detection and quantification. The relative acceptor efficiency of different N-glycosylation sequences was determined for the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 3A). There were wide variations in the preference among the amino acids at X. A sequon containing proline was inactive, whereas a sequon with valine served as the most favored substrate. The same peptide library experiment was performed using the G515A mutant for comparison, and we found a similar tendency in the relative amino acid preference. In fact, the correlation plot between the wild-type enzyme and the G515A mutant shows a good linear relationship (Fig. 3A), although the G515A mutation caused a 40% reduction in the specific activity (Fig. 2B). We then tested nine other mutations that were dispensable for the OST activity. Among them, only the K574A mutant changed the amino acid preference significantly (Fig. 3B). A closer look at the correlation plot revealed that the mutation-induced changes in the preference were selective to arginine, lysine, and glutamate residues at the X position (Fig. 3C). The correlation plots for the other mutants are provided in supplemental Fig. S3. We then substituted Lys-574 with six different amino acids other than alanine. The effects on the amino acid preference at the X position were similar to the K574A mutants (Fig. 4): increased efficiency for arginine and lysine and decreased efficiency for glutamate. The enhanced efficiency for arginine at the X position suggests that the K574 mutants may have a higher activity than the wild-type enzyme toward peptides containing the Asn-Arg-Thr sequon. As expected, four mutants had a higher activity on the Asn-Arg-Thr sequon than the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 5B). In contrast, all mutants had a lower specific activity than the wild type on the original Asn-Val-Thr sequon (Fig. 5A).FIGURE 5P. furiosus OST was adapted for a non-optimal N-glycosylation sequon by the point mutations at position 574. A, the specific OST activities of the point mutants at position 574 were compared. The peptide sequence was the same as that used in Fig. 2. B, the same assay was performed using a different peptide with arginine at the X position in place of valine. The activity of the wild-type AglB was defined as 1. Data were compared with the wild type by an unpaired two-tailed t test, assuming unequal variance. *, p < 0.01; §, p < 0.05.

This expectation has been proven right for the eukaryotic STT3s and the eubacterial PglB by mutagenesis studies (21Igura M. Maita N. Kamishikiryo J. Yamada M. Obita T. Maenaka K. Kohda D.

Biol. 2005; 12: 1311-1315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Here, we verified the contribution of these motifs to the OST activity of an archaeal AglB protein. We set up an in vitro OST assay using P. furiosus AglB expressed in the membrane fractions of E. coli cells (supplemental Figs. S1 and S2). The detection of the OST activity using the heterologously expressed AglB confirmed that the AglB protein is solely responsible for the OST activity and that neither posttranslational modifications nor other additional subunits are necessary for the OST activity. This finding guarantees the future installation of the P. furiosus AglB into artificial N-glycosylation machinery engineered in E. coli. The almost complete loss of the OST activity by the mutations in the DXD and WWDYG motifs confirmed the essential roles in the archaeal OST activity (Fig. 2B). The alanine mutation of Asp-167 also impaired the OST activity (Fig. 2B). The Asp-167 residue belongs to another previously unrecognized diacidic motif, GXXDX(D/E) (supplemental Fig. S4). In good agreement, the alanine mutations in the corresponding region (G163SYDNE168) in yeast STT3 generated a lethal phenotype (31Chavan M. Rekowicz M. Lennarz W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51441-51447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Each alanine mutation of the three residues that define the DK motif reduced the OST activity, whereas the other mutations, except for Tyr-568 and Phe-575, within and flanking the DK motif retained nearly full activity (Fig. 2B). The results are in good accordance with the three-dimensional structure of the AglB protein. The three signature residues face the same side of the kinked helix, and the side chains are in close proximity to the essential WWDYG motif (Fig. 1). The K574A mutant exerted significant effects on the amino acid preference at the X position of the Asn-X-Thr sequon (Fig. 3C). These effects were position-specific, as the other residue positions in the WWDYG motif and the DK motif had little influence on the amino acid preference at X (Fig. 3B and supplemental Fig. S3). The effect of the K574A mutation resulted in an enhanced preference for arginine and lysine, a reduced preference for glutamate, and a similar preference for the other residues (Fig. 3C). Other mutations at residue 574 also affected the amino acid preference at X in a similar manner (Fig. 4). The interpretation of the effects of the K574 mutations appears to be rather simple. The removal of the positive charge by the replacement of Lys-574 relieves the arginine and lysine at the X position from the unfavorable electrostatic interactions and abolishes the electrostatic stabilization with the glutamate at the X position. In contrast, the effects of the size and shape of the side chain of residue 574 seem to be negligible. Indeed, the mutations to tryptophan and glycine had the same tendency on the amino acid preference. This indicates that the influence of the lysine at residue 574 basically occurs via long-range electrostatic interactions. The spatial arrangement of the two substrates, LLO and the Asn-X-Thr sequon, in the catalytic site is summarized in Fig. 6. Three interactions (denoted by i, ii, and iii) are formed, at least transiently, with the catalytic motifs of AglB during the sequon recognition and the subsequent reaction. Residue 574 corresponds to the second signature residue of the DK motif. The role of the lysine residue in the DK motif is to control of the amino acid preference at the X position of the sequon via electrostatic interactions. The replacement of the lysine by arginine in the DK motif of yeast STT3 resulted in a lethal phenotype (21Igura M. Maita N. Kamishikiryo J. Yamada M. Obita T. Maenaka K. Kohda D. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 234-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). This indicates that a simple mechanism based on electrostatic interactions is not sufficient to describe the function of the DK motif. Further investigations are necessary to clarify the precise role of the DK motif. The mutations at residue 574 substantially reduced the OST activity when the optimized peptide sequence containing the Asn-Val-Thr sequon was used as a peptide substrate (Fig. 5A). We measured the OST activity using a new peptide substrate with the Asn-Arg-Thr sequon (Fig. 5B). Four mutants displayed higher activity than the wild type. This exemplifies the potential of a single mutation in the AglB protein to optimize its activity toward a particular target N-glycosylation sequon. For practical applications, the present study provides a novel strategy to overcome the macroheterogeneity problem of recombinant glycoproteins. The eukaryotic STT3 proteins contain the DK motif, and thus the lysine residue in the motif is an obvious candidate for mutation. Recently, an innovative glycoprotein production system using the Campylobacter N-glycosylation machinery was reported (32Schwarz F. Huang W. Li C. Schulz B.L. Lizak C. Palumbo A. Numao S. Neri D. Aebi M. Wang L.X. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2010; 6: 264-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The key component of the machinery is Campylobacter PglB. The PglB protein possesses the MI motif in place of the DK motif (27Maita N. Nyirenda J. Igura M. Kamishikiryo J. Kohda D. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 4941-4950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Mutations in the MI motif would affect the amino acid preference at the X position. The common tendency of the changes in amino acid preference among the seven Lys-574 mutants of the P. furiosus AglB (Figs. 3C and 4) may preclude the flexible design of mutants targeted to a particular sequon with a variety of amino acid residues at the X position. We suggest that combinatorial mutation screening, based on the three signature sites in the DK/DM/MI motifs, may generate an optimized OST mutant for a particular substrate sequence. In fact, the alanine mutation of the third signature position of the DK motif, I578A, had a small effect on the amino acid preference at the X position (supplemental Fig. S3).

We have now established an additional role for the cluster in directing molybdenum cofactor assembly during enzyme maturation. EPR spectroscopy indicates that FS0 has a high spin ground state (S = 32 ) in its reduced form, resulting in an EPR spectrum with a peak at g ∼ 5.0. The cluster is predicted to be in close proximity to the molybdo-bis(pyranopterin guanine dinucleotide) (Mo-bisPGD) cofactor, which provides the site of dimethyl sulfoxide reduction. Comparison with nitrate reductase A (NarGHI) indicates that a sequence of residues (18CTVNC22) plays a role in both FS0 and Mo-bisPGD coordination. A DmsAΔN21 mutant prevented Mo-bisPGD binding and resulted in a degenerate [3Fe-4S] cluster form of FS0 being assembled. DmsA belongs to the Type II subclass of Mo-bisPGD-containing catalytic subunits that is distinguished from the Type I subclass by having three rather than two residues between the first two Cys residues coordinating FS0 and a conserved Arg residue rather than a Lys residue following the fourth cluster coordinating Cys. We introduced a Type I Cys group into DmsA in two stages. We changed its sequence from 18CATVNCBGSRCCP27 to 18CATYCBGVGCCG26 (similar to that of formate dehydrogenase (FdnG)) and demonstrated that this eliminated both Mo-bisPGD binding and EPR-detectable FS0. We then combined this change with a DmsAR61K mutation and demonstrated that this additional change partially rescued Mo-bisPGD insertion.

Escherichia coli is a facultative anaerobe able to respire with oxygen or alternative respiratory oxidants such as nitrate, nitrite, fumarate, and dimethyl sulfoxide (1Weiner J.H. Rothery R.A.

This family of enzymes contributes to the broad metabolic diversity that permits bacterial growth utilizing a wide range of respiratory substrates. Each structurally characterized enzyme of this family consists of a catalytic subunit with a molybdo-bis(pyranopterin guanine dinucleotide) (Mo-bisPGD) 3The abbreviations used are: Mo-bisPGDmolybdo-bis(pyranopterin guanine dinucleotide)HOQNO2-n-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline N-oxideBVbenzyl viologenLPCH2reduced lapachol. cofactor and an FS0 [4Fe-4S] cluster, an electron transfer subunit containing four [Fe-S] clusters, and a membrane anchor subunit containing a quinol/quinone-binding site (Q-site). Each enzyme catalyzes an overall reaction that involves transferring two electrons, through an electron transfer relay connecting the Q-site and the Mo-bisPGD cofactor, and reduction (or oxidation) of substrate at the catalytic molybdenum active site of the enzyme (see Fig. 1A). Although DmsABC does not contribute to the transmembrane proton electrochemical potential, it can support anaerobic growth with dimethyl sulfoxide as respiratory oxidant when coupled with an appropriate proton-translocating dehydrogenase (11Bogachev A.V. Murtazina R.A. Skulachev V.P. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6233-6237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DmsABC couples the oxidation of menaquinol within the hydrophobic membrane milieu to the reduction of water-soluble dimethyl sulfoxide in the membrane-extrinsic periplasmic domain of the enzyme (1Weiner J.H. Rothery R.A. Sambasivarao D. Trieber C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1102: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 12Sambasivarao D. Scraba D.G. Trieber C. Weiner J.H. J.

In E. coli DmsABC, it is the DmsA catalytic subunit that contains the Mo-bisPGD cofactor and an FS0 [4Fe-4S] cluster. The FS0 cluster is the last stepping stone of the electron transfer relay and transfers electrons from FS1 in DmsB to the cofactor in the active site of DmsA (see Fig. 1A). The N-terminal sequence of DmsA contains four highly conserved Cys residues, which form a ferredoxin-like Cys motif that, as we show below, coordinates FS0. In the CISM enzymes, the Cys group has the following consensus sequence: (CA/HA)X2–3CBX3CCX27–34CDX(K/R) (1Weiner J.H. Rothery R.A. Sambasivarao D. Trieber C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1102: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 2Rothery R.A. Workun G.J. Weiner J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1778: 1897-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Sequences with two residues between CA and CB are classified as Type I sequences and typically have a Lys residue located after CD (13Trieber C.A. Rothery R.A. Weiner J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4620-4626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 14Trieber C.A. Rothery R.A. Weiner J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7103-7109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DmsA is classified as a Type II sequence because it has three residues between CA and CB and an Arg residue after CD. The third residue after CA in DmsA is an Asn, which is highly conserved in DmsABC-type dimethyl sulfoxide reductases and NarGHI-type nitrate reductases across bacterial species (2Rothery R.A. Workun G.J. Weiner J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1778: 1897-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The interplay between the Type I and II sequences and molybdoenzyme assembly and function remains poorly understood. Previous studies on the FS0-binding motif of DmsA indicated that mutating the second Cys residue to Ser or Ala results in assembly of a [3Fe-4S] cluster into DmsA (13Trieber C.A. Rothery R.A. Weiner J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4620-4626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) at the FS0 position. Careful analysis of the Mo(V) EPR properties of the Mo-bisPGD cofactor indicated that there is a spin-spin interaction between the molybdenum center and a paramagnetic center with a midpoint potential of around −140 mV (15Rothery R.A. Trieber C.A. Weiner J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13002-13009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), but in none of these studies was the EPR spectrum of wild-type FS0 observed. In the case of another Type II enzyme, E. coli NarGHI, the FS0 spectrum was observed at low temperature at g ∼ 5.0 (16Rothery R.A. Bertero M.G. Cammack R. Palak M. Blasco F. Strynadka N.C.

B. 2007; 111: 13632-13637Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Further studies revealed that FS0 insertion was closely linked to that of the Mo-bisPGD cofactor (18Rothery R.A. Bertero M.G. Spreter T. Bouromand N. Strynadka N.C. Weiner J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 8801-8807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). An important distinction between the Type II Cys group sequence of DmsA and that of NarG is that there is a His in the CA position of the latter and a Cys at this position in the former. It was not known whether the observation of a high spin FS0 EPR spectrum is related to the presence of His at the CA position. Maturation of the catalytically competent DmsABC requires efficient cofactor insertion into DmsA (19Sambasivarao D. Turner R.J. Bilous P.T. Rothery R.A. Shaw G. Weiner J.H. Biochem.

Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5935-5943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, assembly and targeting of the apoenzyme are not cofactor insertion-dependent (19Sambasivarao D. Turner R.J. Bilous P.T. Rothery R.A. Shaw G. Weiner J.H. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 80: 435-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 23Rothery R.A. Grant J.L. Johnson J.L. Rajagopalan K.V. Weiner J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2057-2063Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of NarGHI, NarJ functions as a system-specific chaperone participating in cofactor insertion (24Blasco F. Dos Santos J.P. Magalon A. Frixon C. Guigliarelli B. Santini C.L. Giordano G. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 435-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 25Lanciano P. Vergnes A. Grimaldi S. Guigliarelli B. Magalon A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17468-17474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In the case of DmsABC, the system-specific chaperone DmsD plays a role in targeting DmsAB to the tat translocon and may have additional roles in maturation (26Oresnik I.J. Ladner C.L. Turner R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 323-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated by protein crystallography that, in NarGHI, FS0 assembly is a prerequisite for Mo-bisPGD insertion (18Rothery R.A. Bertero M.G. Spreter T. Bouromand N. Strynadka N.C. Weiner J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 8801-8807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It is therefore of great interest to see if a similar sequence of cluster assembly and cofactor insertion occurs in the maturation of DmsABC. In this study, we establish that DmsA contains a novel [4Fe-4S] FS0 cluster that has a high spin ground state (S = 32 ) in its reduced form. By generating mutants of the DmsA N-terminal Cys group, we show that there is critical interplay between correct assembly of FS0 and molybdenum cofactor insertion. These results point toward a new paradigm for Mo-bisPGD cofactor-containing subunit maturation in which FS0 must be assembled prior to cofactor insertion. E. coli strains DSS301 (20Sambasivarao D. Weiner J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5935-5943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and TOPP2 were used in this study (Table 1). DSS301 was used for the growth experiments. TOPP2 was used for enzyme expression and spectroscopic studies, as we found that it was optimal for DmsABC overexpression and assembly (27Cheng V.W. Rothery R.A. Bertero M.G. Strynadka N.C.

Mutants were verified by DNA sequencing carried out by the Department of Biochemistry DNA Core Facility at the University of Alberta. The EcoRI-EcoRV fragments of DmsA containing the mutations were cloned back into the pDMS160 expression vector (30Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.

The ability of the mutant DmsABC enzymes described herein to support respiratory growth on dimethyl sulfoxide was evaluated as follows. Appropriate plasmids were transformed into E. coli DSS301, and anaerobic growth was evaluated in sealed Klett flasks at 37 °C using glycerol/dimethyl sulfoxide minimum medium (27Cheng V.W.

Membranes were prepared by cell lysis using an Avestin microfluidizer and differential centrifugation. PMSF (2 mm final concentration) was added to the cell suspension prior to cell lysis. Membranes were washed, pelleted by ultracentrifugation, resuspended in 100 mm MOPS and 5 mm EDTA (pH 7), and flash-frozen with liquid N2 before being stored at −70 °C prior to use (27Cheng V.W.

Protein concentrations of the membrane preparations were determined with the Lowry assay (32Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol.

Laemmli U.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1102-1106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 30 μg of purified DmsABC was loaded as a standard. Gel electrophoresis was run at 200 V for 45 min, and the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. HOQNO is a menaquinol analog that binds to the DmsC quinol-binding site of DmsABC with 1:1 stoichiometry (35Zhao Z. Weiner J.H. J. Biol.

Fluorescence was monitored at an excitation wavelength of 341 nm and an emission wavelength of 479 nm as aliquots (2 μl) of 0.1 mm HOQNO were added to a membrane sample with final protein concentrations of 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0 mg/ml in a total volume of 3.5 ml. Fluorescence readings were taken using a PerkinElmer LS 50B luminescence spectrophotometer. The concentration of enzyme was estimated as the concentration at which HOQNO fluorescence became detectable in the sample cuvette (27Cheng V.W. Rothery R.A. Bertero M.G. Strynadka N.C. Weiner J.H. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 8068-8077Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Proteins were extracted from the membrane with 1% n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside and 0.5 mm DTT in 100 mm MOPS, 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 160 μm PMSF (pH 7.0) for 1.5 h with gentle shaking on ice. The extraction mixture was then centrifuged at 40,000 rpm for 1.5 h to remove insoluble material, and DmsABC was separated from other proteins in the supernatant by FPLC using a Mono Q HR 10/10 anion exchange column and a GE Healthcare ÄKTA FPLC system. DmsABC was eluted from the column with a linear salt gradient (0–400 mm KCl) in 50 mm MOPS, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.05% n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside, and 0.5 mm DTT. Protein samples were concentrated by ultrafiltration. The specific activities of the wild-type and mutant enzymes were measured as the rate of trimethylamine N-oxide-dependent oxidation of dithionite reduced BV by following the decrease in BV absorption at 570 nm (37Cammack R.

The final concentration of trimethylamine N-oxide was 72 mm in 50 mm MOPS and 5 mm EDTA. The extinction coefficient for BV is 7.4 mm−1 cm−1. Quinol-dependent enzyme activity was determined as the rate of trimethylamine N-oxide-dependent anaerobic oxidation of reduced lapachol (LPCH2) (38Rothery R.A. Chatterjee I. Kiema G. McDermott M.T. Weiner J.H. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Lapachol was reduced by zinc in hydrochloric acid to form LPCH2, which was added to degassed 100 mm MOPS buffer containing 5 mm EDTA and 70 mm trimethylamine N-oxide in a closed cuvette. The reaction was initiated by the addition of enzyme. Lapachol absorbance at 481 nm was monitored and used to calculate the activity as micromoles of LPCH2 oxidized per min/mg of total protein. The extinction coefficient of lapachol is 2.66 mm−1 cm−1 (38Rothery R.A. Chatterjee I. Kiema G. McDermott M.T. Weiner J.H. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The Form A fluorescence assay was used to estimate the relative amount of Mo-bisPGD in each DmsA enzyme preparation (23Rothery R.A. Grant J.L. Johnson J.L. Rajagopalan K.V. Weiner J.H. J.

Form A molybdopterin derivatives were prepared by acidification of membrane preparations (10 mg/sample) with HCl and oxidation by boiling with 2% potassium iodide and 4% iodine (w/v). 200 μl of the acid-denatured iodine-oxidized extracts was added to 3.5 ml of 1 m NH4OH to measure the fluorescence (23Rothery R.A. Grant J.L. Johnson J.L. Rajagopalan K.V. Weiner J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2057-2063Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Excitation spectra were recorded at 240–420 nm (emission at 448 nm), and the emission spectra were recorded at 410–520 nm (excitation at 397 nm) using a PerkinElmer LS 50 luminescence spectrometer. Fluorescence spectra were corrected by subtraction of the spectrum of 1 m ammonium hydroxide as well as the spectrum of a membrane preparation of E. coli harboring only the pBR322 vector. Reduced samples were prepared by anaerobic incubation of purified DmsABC or membrane samples enriched in DmsABC with 6 mm sodium dithionite for 5 min at room temperature. All samples were prepared in 3-mm internal diameter quartz EPR tubes, rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen-chilled ethanol, and stored in liquid nitrogen until used. For analysis of [Fe-S] clusters, EPR spectra were recorded using a Bruker ELEXSYS E500 spectrometer equipped with a Bruker SHQE cavity and an Oxford Instruments ESR900 flowing helium cryostat. The catalytic subunit (NarG) of E. coli NarGHI is currently the best characterized Type II molybdoenzyme subunit (2Rothery R.A. Workun G.J. Weiner J.H. Biochim. Biophys.

The segment comprising three residues between CA and CB, 19TVN21, is predicted to place the side chain of Asn-21 in close proximity to one dithiolene sulfur from each pyranopterin (Fig. 1B). The Arg residue that follows CD in the FS0-coordinating motif (Arg-61) is predicted to be located between the proximal pterin and FS0 (Fig. 1C). Site-directed mutagenesis has demonstrated that this residue plays a critical role in electron transfer and intercenter interactions in E. coli DmsA (14Trieber C.A. Rothery R.A. Weiner J.H. J. Biol.

We exploited our structural model to investigate the interplay between the FS0 [4Fe-4S] cluster and the Mo-bisPGD cofactor during the final stages of DmsABC maturation. We generated mutants of residues predicted to surround the FS0 cluster of DmsA (i) to identify the EPR signature of FS0, (ii) to investigate the effect of converting the DmsA Cys group from a Type II to a Type I sequence, and (iii) to investigate the interplay between FS0 assembly and Mo-bisPGD insertion. Fig. 2 shows the sequences of the mutant Cys groups generated herein. Arg-61 was mutated to Lys to emulate this feature of the Type I sequences. Asn-21 was deleted to investigate the effect of decreasing the CA-CB gap from three to two residues. Mutant enzyme CS1 contains multiple changes (V20Y, ΔAsn-21, S25V, and R25G) to render the DmsA Cys group similar to that of E. coli formate dehydrogenase N (FdnGHI) (43Berg B.L. Stewart V.

R61K and CS1 complete the conversion of the DmsA Cys group from a Type II to a Type I sequence. EPR spectra recorded at g ∼ 2.0 have provided no direct evidence for the existence of FS0 in DmsA (13Trieber C.A. Rothery R.A. Weiner J.H. J. Biol.

The emergence of a range of protein structures of molybdoenzyme subunits with N-terminal Cys groups allows us to predict that such a cluster must also exist in DmsA. In the case of the Type I enzymes, EPR spectra for FS0 have been reported and demonstrate that, in its reduced form, it has an S = ½ ground state with well resolved EPR features at g ∼ 2.0 (46Gladyshev V.N.
