https://openalex.org/W1993179764,"Smell identification ability was measured in 1955 persons ranging in age from 5 to 99 years. On the average, women outperformed men at all ages, and nonsmokers outperformed smokers. Peak performance occurred in the third through fifth decades and declined markedly after the seventh. More than half of those 65 to 80 years old evidenced major olfactory impairment. After 80 years, more than three-quarters evidenced major impairment. Given these findings, it is not surprising that many elderly persons complain that food lacks flavor and that the elderly account for a disproportionate number of accidental gas poisoning cases each year."

https://openalex.org/W1990786675,"Drosophila RNA polymerase II requires at least two chromatographically distinct transcription factors (designated A and B) to initiate transcription accurately in vitro. We describe the partial purification and concentration of one of these transcription factors, the B factor. Footprint analysis of the B fraction demonstrated the presence of a sequence-specific DNA-binding component in the transcription factor preparation. This component binds specifically to a 65 bp region of DNA surrounding the start point of transcription of the histone H3, H4, and actin 5C genes. Included in this binding region is the TATA box, the start point of transcription, and a portion of the leader region. The pattern of protection from DNAase I cleavage on the coding strand of the histone H3 gene is asymmetric with regard to the complementary noncoding strand. Sequence-specific binding of the B fraction occurs in the apparent absence of RNA polymerase II. The potential function of the binding component in the initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2023555221,Portions of the brain stem seem normally to inhibit pain. In man and laboratory animals these brain areas and pathways from them to spinal sensory circuits can be activated by focal stimulation. Endogenous opioids appear to be implicated although separate nonopioid mechanisms are also evident. Stress seems to be a natural stimulus triggering pain suppression. Properties of electric footshock have been shown to determine the opioid or nonopioid basis of stress-induced analgesia. Two different opioid systems can be activated by different footshock paradigms. This dissection of stress analgesia has begun to integrate divergent findings concerning pain inhibition and also to account for some of the variance that has obscured the reliable measurement of the effects of stress on tumor growth and immune function.

https://openalex.org/W1986119684,Injections of leupeptin (a thiol proteinase inhibitor) or chloroquine (a general lysosomal enzyme inhibitor) into the brains of young rats induced the formation of lysosome-associated granular aggregates (dense bodies) which closely resembled the ceroid-lipofuscin that accumulates in certain disease states and during aging. The dense material increased in a dose- and time-dependent fashion and was differentially distributed across brain regions and cell types. These observations provide clues to the origins of ceroid-lipofuscin and suggest means for studying the consequences of its accumulation.
https://openalex.org/W1999457029,"Metastatic mouse melanoma cells have a high affinity for the basement membrane and the ability to degrade it; these properties may allow tumor cells to invade the membrane and disseminate. In this study it was found that the metastatic potential of mouse melanoma cells varied when the cells were exposed in culture to fibronectin or laminin. After removal of fibronectin or exposure to laminin, the cells had an increased affinity for basement membrane collagen, were more invasive of basement membranes in vitro, and produced more lung colonies in vivo. These changes are correlated with and may be due to an increase in the laminin-binding capacity of the tumor cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W2048299411,"In neuroblastoma lines in which the N-myc gene is present as a single copy, the expression of N-myc as messenger RNA is increased relative to that in nonneuroblastoma cell lines and tumors. The increase of expression in neuroblastomas with amplified N-myc genes is the result of (i) an increase in the absolute amount of expression of each N-myc gene and (ii) an increase in the copy number of the N-myc gene. A second gene--which is amplified in many of the same lines as N-myc--is expressed to about the same degree in most human cell lines and primary tumors regardless of origin (when normalized to gene copy number). Thus, a change in the regulation of N-myc expression in neuroblastomas and certain other tumors results in greatly increased expression of each N-myc gene copy."
https://openalex.org/W2094079592,"Flying crickets avoid sources of ultrasound, possibly echolocating bats, by making rapid steering movements that turn them away from the stimulus. Electrical stimulation of a single, identified sensory interneuron (Int-1) elicits avoidance steering; depressing its response to ultrasound abolishes avoidance steering. Int-1 is necessary and sufficient for this behavior but only while the cricket is in flight. Thus, the sufficiency of Int-1 for eliciting this behavior is contingent on behavioral context."
https://openalex.org/W2087799413,"All three forms of discoidin I, an endogenous N-acetylgalactosamine-binding lectin from D. discoideum, contain the amino acid sequence gly-arg-gly-asp also found in fibronectin and implicated in its attachment to cells. Synthetic peptides containing these and adjacent amino acids of discoidin I block organized streaming during aggregation of D. discoideum and, at higher concentrations, block cell attachment and spreading on a plastic surface and formation of fruiting bodies. Pure discoidin I (with or without N-acetylgalactosamine) and univalent anti-discoidin I also block formation of streams during aggregation. Two mutants of D. discoideum with low levels of discoidin I apparently reflect the deficiency of this endogenous lectin by failing to form streams or to spread on plastic and by a partial failure to enter aggregates. Together, the results indicate that discoidin I functions like fibronectin to promote cell attachment and spreading as well as ordered cellular migration during morphogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2002785964,"A monoclonal anti-idiotope antibody coupled to a carrier protein was used to immunize BALB/c mice against a lethal Streptococcus pneumoniae infection. Vaccinated mice developed a high titer of antibody to phosphorylcholine, which is known to protect against infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae. Measurement of the median lethal dose of the bacteria indicated that anti-idiotope immunization significantly increased the resistance of BALB/c mice to the bacterial challenge. Antibody to an idiotope can thus be used as an antigen substitute for the induction of protective immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2083479623,"Analysis of the ability of heteroantisera, monoclonal antibodies, and antibodies to synthetic peptides to react with viral glycoproteins deglycosylated with endoglycosidase F revealed that the reactivities of most of the antibodies to these glycoprotein antigens were influenced by the attached carbohydrate moieties. All heteroantisera prepared in rabbits or goats to either fully glycosylated retroviruses or influenza virus were virtually unreactive toward the viral glycoproteins after carbohydrate removal. Analyses with a panel of monoclonal antibodies to purified Rauscher murine leukemia virus gp70 indicated that the reactivity of most of these antibodies improved while the reactivity of others decreased or remain unchanged after carbohydrate removal. Most of the antibodies to synthetic peptide sequences in the influenza virus hemagglutinin also improved in reactivity after carbohydrate removal. These data indicate that carbohydrate side chains on viral glycoproteins influence the immune response to these antigens, and the more native the glycoprotein immunogen, the more dramatic the carbohydrate influence. Thus the immune response to these glycoproteins is not simply a function of the immunogenicity of certain domains over others but rather is a direct measure of carbohydrate influences on the host's perception of the foreign antigen."
https://openalex.org/W2084392102,"To study the biogenetic pathway of influenza hemagglutinin (HA), a model apical glycoprotein, in polarized epithelial MDCK cells, anti-HA antibodies were added to the basolateral surface during influenza infection. In monolayers grown on collagen gels influenza and VSV plaque development was blocked only when the antibodies were added to the respective budding surface. Addition of anti-HA antibodies to the basal medium of monolayers grown on nitrocellulose filter chambers neither resulted in HA-coupled transport of antibody nor inhibited HA migration to the apical surface. These results indicate that the bulk of HA is vectorially inserted into the apical surface of MDCK cells by polarized exocytosis. Other apical proteins in epithelia may use a similar mechanism during biogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1504438509,"A novel retinol-binding protein, resolved during purification into two essentially identical forms, has been discovered in the rat. It was purified to apparent homogeneity, using whole neonatal rat pups as source. The protein is distinct from other known retinol-binding proteins by behavior during purification, spectra of bound retinol, and immunochemical reactivity. It is a single polypeptide chain with molecular weight of about 16,000. The protein binds all-trans-retinol as an endogenous ligand. Retinol bound to the protein exhibited considerably altered absorbance and fluorescence excitation spectra compared to free retinol in organic solvent. The retinol-binding protein was found by radioimmunoassay in a number of tissues of the neonatal rat. However, liver and intestine had levels 100-fold higher than any other tissues examined. The intestine of the adult rat had levels 500-fold higher than any other tissue examined, with a decreasing gradient from jejenum to colon. The high levels in intestine suggest this protein may have a role in the absorption of retinol."
https://openalex.org/W1574505897,"The kinetics of the activation of plasminogen by tissue-type plasminogen activator were studied in the presence and the absence of CNBr-digested fibrinogen as a soluble cofactor. Michaelis-Menten kinetics applied and the kinetic parameters obtained were very similar to those previously reported for the activation in the presence of solid phase fibrin (Hoylaerts, M., Rijken, D. C., Lijnen, H. R., and Collen, D. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 2912-2919). The affinity of the enzyme for plasminogen dramatically increases in the presence of the soluble cofactor while the catalytic rate constant does not change significantly (KM drops from 83 to 0.18 microM and kcat increases from 0.07 to 0.28 s-1 for tissue-type plasminogen activator of melanoma origin). Fragments containing the lysine-binding sites of plasminogen compete with plasminogen for interaction with CNBr-digested fibrinogen. The dissociation constant of this interaction was found to be 4.5 microM for the high affinity lysine-binding site. No difference was found in the kinetic parameters for the activation of plasminogen by either tissue-type plasminogen activator of melanoma origin or by glycosylated forms of tissue-type plasminogen activator obtained by recombinant DNA technology. The present findings obtained in a homogenous liquid milieu support the previously proposed mechanism of the activation of plasminogen by tissue-type plasminogen activator in the presence of fibrin. This mechanism involves binding of both tissue-type plasminogen activator and plasminogen to fibrin."
https://openalex.org/W2068118637,"In the neocortices and amygdalae of young and aged macaques, cholinergic axons were identified by means of a monoclonal antibody to bovine choline acetyltransferase. Many fine, linear, immunoreactive profiles were seen in these animals. In the older animals, some cholinergic axons showed multifocal enlargements along their course. In some instances, neurites with choline acetyltransferase immunoreactivity were associated with deposits of amyloid (visualized with thioflavin T fluorescence). The appearance of these amyloid-associated abnormal cholinergic processes was similar to that of neurites in senile plaques, as shown by conventional silver impregnation techniques. Cholinergic systems thus give rise to some of the neurites within senile plaques."
https://openalex.org/W2052093025,"The incidence of low birth weight among white live-born infants from 1940 through 1978 was studied in various sections of the Love Canal. A statistically significant excess was found in the historic swale area from 1940 through 1953, the period when various chemicals were dumped in this disposal site. Potential confounding factors such as medical-therapeutic histories, smoking, education, maternal age, birth order, length of gestation, and urban-rural difference did not appear to account for this observation. Low birth weight rates were comparable to those of upstate New York from 1954 through 1978, the period when there was no deposition of chemical wastes."

BIO 14.6 hamsters are known to develop congestive heart failure with edema when they are about 200 days old, and the venous congestion and edema are preventable by parabiosis with normal hamsters. The humoral mediator, the deficiency of which causes venous congestion and edema in BIO 14.6 hamsters, may be atrial natriuretic factor."
https://openalex.org/W1576289006,"Lysophospholipase from human eosinophils is a protein previously considered based upon antigenic, enzymatic, and electrophoretic similarities to be the single component of Charcot-Leyden crystals, which are formed in vivo in association with eosinophilic diseases. The identity of eosinophil lysophospholipase and solubilized Charcot-Leyden crystal protein is now established by biochemical criteria, and a basis for the ease of aggregation and crystallization of the protein is identified in its prominent hydrophobicity. Chromatographically purified enzyme and Charcot-Leyden crystal protein formed in vitro functioned as lysophospholipases with identical Michaelis constants (Km approximately equal to 22 microM) for the substrate lysopalmitoylphosphatidylcholine and had blocked amino-terminal residues and almost identical amino acid compositions. The propensity of lysophospholipase to aggregate was not due to extensive intermolecular disulfide bonding because it contained a single cysteine residue as assessed by amino acid analyses and incorporated 0.986 mol of p-chloromercuribenzoic acid/mol of native enzyme or 0.958 mol of iodoacetic acid/mol of reduced and denatured enzyme. By equilibrium dialysis, lysophospholipase bound 3.820 g of detergent/g of protein in 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate and 0.506 g of detergent/g of protein in 10 mM sodium deoxycholate. In addition, monomeric protein demonstrated enhanced binding of detergent as evidenced by its aberrantly rapid electrophoretic mobility in 1%, but not 0.1%, sodium dodecyl sulfate. The hydrophobic nature of this protein, which accounts for 10% of the protein of the eosinophil, may contribute to its unique propensity for crystallization in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2157618009,"A cloned human cardiac actin gene, introduced into mouse Ltk- cells, is expressed in several thymidine kinase (tk)-positive cotransfectants. The clones not only produce authentic polyadenylated human cardiac actin mRNA but also synthesize human cardiac actin protein. The cardiac actin protein, normally found only in myofibrils, is stably accumulated at a high level, about one-third that of the endogenous mouse beta-actin. Furthermore, this sarcomeric protein partitions between the Triton X-100 insoluble and soluble phases to the same extent as the endogenous beta-actin. This suggests that a sarcomeric actin can participate in the formation of Triton X-100-insoluble cytoskeletal structures."
https://openalex.org/W2016525048,High-resolution proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies of intact cancer cells revealed differences between cells with the capacity to metastasize and those that produce locally invasive tumors. The NMR resonances that characterize the metastatic cells were associated with an increased ratio of cholesterol to phospholipid and an increased amount of plasma membrane-bound cholesterol ester. High-resolution NMR spectroscopy could therefore be used to assess the metastatic potential of primary tumors.
https://openalex.org/W1607936037,"The effects of cytochrome b5 on the decay of the ferrous dioxygen complexes of P-450LM2 and P-450LM4 from rabbit liver microsomes were studied by stopped-flow spectrophotometry. The P-450 (FeIIO2) complexes accept an electron from reduced cytochrome b5 and, in a reaction not previously described, donate an electron to oxidized cytochrome b5 to give ferric P-450. A comparison with the electron-transferring properties of ferrous P-450 under anaerobic conditions allowed determination of the limiting steps of the two reactions involving the oxygenated complex. The rate of decay of the dioxygen complex was increased in all cases with b5 present; however, with oxidized b5 a large increase in the rate was observed with P-450 isozyme 4 but not with isozyme 2, whereas the opposite situation was found when reduced b5 was used. The reactions between b5 and ferrous dioxygen P-450 were not at thermodynamic equilibrium under the conditions employed. From the results obtained, a model is proposed in which the ferrous dioxygen complex decomposes rapidly into another species differing from ferric P-450 in its spectral properties and from the starting complex in its electron-transferring properties. A scheme is presented to indicate how competition among spontaneous decay, cytochrome b5 oxidation, and cytochrome b5 reduction by the ferrous O2 complex may influence substrate hydroxylation."
https://openalex.org/W1994988233,"Electron spectroscopic imaging was combined with reconstruction algorithms to derive the three-dimensional structure of the nucleosome core particle to a resolution of 1.5 nanometers. Images of phosphorus distributions within individual nucleosomes were interpreted as projections of a supercoil of DNA. These were used to orient the corresponding individual nucleosome images, making it possible to reconstruct the entire nucleosome in three dimensions. The structure is consistent with known biochemical and biophysical data and explains site-specific nuclease sensitivity, although differing in part with other nucleosome models."
https://openalex.org/W2108984662,"Lethal t mutations belonging to seven different complementation groups have been mapped. The overall picture emerges as three clusters of t-lethal genes: one near the proximally located tail interaction factor (tT) containing tw73; one numerous cluster associated with the MHC and including tw32, t12, tw5, tw18, and tLub-1; and one distal cluster close to the locus of tf encompassing, t0, t6, and tw12. In the two cases examined, members of the same complementation group map to the same location. Evidence is presented that more than one mutant site may be necessary for the lethality of some lethal t ""mutations,"" and that the expression of a specific lethal phenotype may depend on cis-interactions between multiple mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2067444808,"Administration of cholecystokinin was recently found to attenuate opiate analgesia. In the present study, the role of endogenous cholecystokinin in opiate analgesia was examined. Endogenously released cholecystokinin was sequestered by antibodies to cholecystokinin developed in response to an active immunization procedure. Morphine analgesia was potentiated and prolonged in rats immunized against cholecystokinin. The rate of development of morphine tolerance, however, was not affected by the antibodies. Endogenous cholecystokinin appears to function as a short-term modulator of opiate action."

These sequences are 593 and 590 nucleotides long and have diverged from one another by 8.8 percent. The LTR's resemble those of functional mammalian type C retroviruses in length and in the presence and location of eukaryotic promoter sequences. The 5' LTR is followed by a presumptive primer binding site unlike that of any known mammalian type C retrovirus, exhibiting 17 out of 18 nucleotides complementary to arginine transfer RNA rather than proline transfer RNA."

https://openalex.org/W2065190069,"We have used liposomes to deliver DNAase I inside normal Syrian hamster embryo (SHE) cells. We showed the entrance of DNAase I inside the cell by dose-dependent cytotoxicity; and the entrance of DNAase I into the nucleus by the induction of chromosomal aberrations and somatic mutation at the HPRT locus (but not at the Na+/K+ ATPase locus). The induction of neoplastic transformation in cultures treated by DNAase I-in-liposomes was manifested by increased saturation density, colony formation at low seeding density, colony formation in 1% serum and 0.3% agar, and tumorigenicity in 100% of injected animals. The acquisition of anchorage-independent growth became apparent only after 39-57 posttreatment population doublings. Thus damage to DNA alone can initiate the neoplastic transformation process; but for full expression of the neoplastic phenotypes, a long progression time is required for the acquisition of anchorage-independent growth and tumorigenicity."
https://openalex.org/W1489070596,"We have identified the presence of a lysophospholipase in human placental tissues and have purified this enzyme from the amnion. The specific activity was highest in the amnion and decreased across adjacent tissues. The purification involved the use of DEAE-Sephadex, phenyl-Sepharose, hydroxylapatite, and sulfylpropyl Sephadex chromatography. The activity of the purified enzyme toward palmitoyl lysophosphatidylcholine is 2.5 mumol min-1 mg-1 and the pH optimum is 7.0. The enzyme is not inhibited by EDTA and does not appear to have a metal ion requirement. The enzyme may be of membrane origin; the purified enzyme requires the presence of detergent during storage. The effects of substrate composition and physical state on enzymatic activity were explored. The enzyme was not active toward mono-, di-, or triglycerides, nor toward diacyl phospholipid. The enzyme was active toward myristoyl and palmitoyl lysophosphatidylcholine at concentrations where these substrates spontaneously form micelles or where Triton X-100 was used to induce co-micellization of the substrate at low concentrations with detergent. A role for this enzyme in processing the lysophospholipid product of phospholipase A action must be considered in evaluating arachidonic acid production in human fetal membranes and placental tissue, particularly during the initiation of labor."

https://openalex.org/W1564612786,"The green heme protein sulfmyoglobin (SMb) has been suggested to contain a sulfur-modified iron chlorin prosthetic group. To evaluate this hypothesis, we have obtained high-frequency (greater than 1000 cm-1) resonance Raman spectra of both oxidized and reduced SMb with 457.9-, 488.0-, 514.5-, 568.2-, and 647.1-nm excitation. The SMb spectra are compared to those of native met- and deoxymyoglobin (Mb). Vibrational frequencies for SMb are generally similar to those of Mb, suggesting a high-spin state for both the Fe(III) and Fe(II) SMb species, as is typical of native Mb. However, major differences between SMb and Mb occur both for patterns of relative spectral intensities and for depolarization ratios. In particular, all B1g-depolarized porphyrin modes in the Mb spectra have become polarized, totally symmetric vibrational modes in the SMb spectra. These contrasts reflect a dramatic lowering of the effective symmetry for the SMb prosthetic group. Several new bands are observed in SMb spectra that are not present in spectra of either native Mb or iron protoporphyrin IX complexes. The observation of additional polarized bands flanking the oxidation state marker, V4, is of particular interest. In a parallel study, we compared the resonance Raman spectral properties of iron protoporphyrin IX-derived chlorins and metallo-octaethylchlorins with those of the analogous porphyrins: the chlorin spectra exhibited altered intensity patterns, an increased number of totally symmetric (polarized) vibrational bands, and several new vibrational bands, including one or two in the region of the oxidation state marker, V4. Thus, the resonance Raman spectral characteristics of SMb and metallo-chlorins are complementary and strongly support a chlorin prosthetic group for SMb. Furthermore, they establish testable criteria for investigating the prosthetic group structures of other green heme proteins by resonance Raman spectroscopy."
https://openalex.org/W1588506316,"The hypothesis that the apoprotein composition of nascent very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) secreted by the hepatocyte is determined by the relative rates of apoprotein synthesis and their affinities of binding to VLDL was tested using chick hepatocytes in monolayer culture. Chick cells were chosen for the study of lipoprotein assembly since estradiol treatment can be used to alter the composition of the apoprotein mixture synthesized by these cells. The secretion of apoprotein (apo) B by estradiol-treated hepatocytes was elevated 4.2-fold above the basal level measured in control cells. Furthermore, estradiol-treated cells secreted apo-II, a major VLDL apoprotein not synthesized prior to estradiol treatment, at a level equivalent to that of apo-B. However, no difference in the secretion of apo-A-I and other newly identified nascent VLDL apoproteins was detected. These changes in relative rates of apoprotein synthesis altered the composition of nascent VLDL secreted by control versus estradiol-induced cells from: apo-B, 22 to 40%; apo-II, 0 to 32%; apo-37 kDa, 14 to 6%; apo-A-I, 31 to 12%; apo-17 kDa, 10 to 4%; apo-9 kDa, 15 to less than 10%; and apo-6 kDa, 8 to less than 2%. To investigate the basis for the preferential incorporation of apo-B and apo-II into nascent VLDL, the relative affinities of the apoproteins for VLDL were compared by measuring their capacities to transfer from VLDL into other lipoprotein or nonlipoprotein density classes. Culture medium containing [3H]leucine-labeled VLDL was incubated with plasma deficient in lipoproteins of rho less than 1.006 g/ml. Within 30 min of incubation at 37 degrees C, 3H-labeled apo-A-I and apo-9 kDa exchanged between VLDL and high-density lipoprotein, whereas apo-37 kDa exchanged between VLDL and the rho greater than 1.21 g/ml fraction. Neither apo-B nor apo-II underwent transfer from nascent VLDL. These results suggest that the relative rates of input of apoproteins into the secretory pathway and their affinities of binding to the nascent VLDL particle determine their extent of incorporation into, and, thus, the apoprotein composition of secreted VLDL."

https://openalex.org/W1584225466,"Purified histones, H1 or core histones, induce the aggregation of tubulin. The aggregation process, studied by light scattering at 350 nm and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, is dependent on the respective amounts of histones and tubulin; a maximum is obtained at a stoichiometry of 1 molecule of H1 or 2 molecules of core histones/tubulin dimer. At these molar ratios, all tubulin and histone molecules are found in the insoluble material which sedimented at 2000 X g. Increasing H1 or core histones, there is a progressive decrease of light scattering and a concomitant formation of soluble complexes. The minimum soluble complexes between tubulin and H1 or between tubulin and core histones have the same apparent molecular weight of 150,000-160,000; these complexes consist of one tubulin and two H1 molecules or one tubulin and four core histones. The tubulin-histone interaction is an almost instantaneous reaction which can, however, be slowed down by increasing the ionic strength of the medium. NaCl (0.5 M) decreased by 50% the formation of tubulin-H1 insoluble complexes but slightly affects the core histones-tubulin complex formation. Histones can be classified by their ability to form insoluble complexes with tubulin: H4 = H3 greater than H2B = H2A greater than H1. The reactivity of histones seems to be related to their lysine/arginine content. Electron microscopy revealed that insoluble polymers resulting from the interaction of tubulin with H1 or core histones are similar and consist of unordered aggregates of 35-40 nm ring structures."
https://openalex.org/W1994661507,The elasmobranch spiracular organ is a specialized receptor associated with the first visceral pouch. The structure of the sensory epithelium of the spiracular organ and the pattern of central termination of the afferent neurons that innervate it show that the spiracular organ is a mechanoreceptor closely related to the lateral line system of sense organs. Its position and orientation within the spiracular cleft suggest that it plays a role in proprioception or equilibrium-audition.
https://openalex.org/W2118856757,"The interaction between acetylcholine receptor (AcChR) and monoclonal antibody (mab) 247G--whose binding is blocked by the presence of alpha-bungarotoxin (alpha BgTx)--leads, in the absence of alpha BgTx, to a maximum binding of 0.5 mabs/alpha BgTx-binding site and, in turn, produces a maximum of 50% inhibition of alpha BgTx binding. For the solubilized AcChR, this inhibition is the result of blockade by mab 247G of the kinetically resolved slow component of alpha BgTx binding. The presence of cholinergic ligands does not significantly inhibit mab binding to the AcChR. AcChR X mab 247G complexes bind d-[3H]tubocurarine and carbamyl[3H]choline with the same stoichiometry as for free AcChR. However, while the binding isotherms for the agonist remain unaltered, the dissociation constant of the antagonist for its high-affinity site increases at least 3 times and there is a decrease in the total number of high-affinity sites and a concomitant increase in the total number of low-affinity sites. These results indicate that the binding of mab 247G to the AcChR stabilizes a new conformational state of the molecule capable of binding cholinergic ligands and confirm previous reports indicating that the cholinergic binding site can be viewed as a region of overlapping cholinergic binding subsites."
https://openalex.org/W1563514995,"Diphtheria toxin (DT) binds NAD with a KD of about 10 microM and adenylyl-(3',5')-uridine 3'-monophosphate (ApUp) with KD values ranging from 9 pM to 1.8 nM, depending on temperature (Collins, C. M., Barbieri, J. T., and Collier, R. J. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 15154-15158). Here we report experiments to explore relationships between ApUp binding and NAD binding to DT and to identify structural features of ApUp that determine its high affinity for DT. NAD, adenine, and nicotinamide competitively inhibited ApUp binding to DT, and we confirmed that ApUp blocked the binding and hydrolysis of NAD. Binding of P-site ligands to the toxin blocked interactions with ApUp. CRM197, a mutant form of DT defective in NAD binding and hydrolysis, bound ApUp 5,000-fold less tightly than did DT. These results are consistent with models in which the ApUp- and NAD-binding sites on DT overlap or are identical. Various mono-, di-, and oligonucleotides were studied as competitors of ApUp binding or the NAD-glycohydrolase reaction. The results imply that the high affinity of ApUp for DT depends on the presence of the 3'-terminal phosphate and a 3'-5' internucleoside linkage. There was strong specificity for adenine as the 5' base, but only weak specificity for uracil as the 3' base. Oligoribonucleotides containing additional nucleotides at either or both ends of ApUp sequences bound to the toxin 1-3 orders of magnitude less avidly than ApUp. Oligodeoxyribonucleotides containing dApdT sequences bound with still lower affinities. In contrast to the case with whole toxin, ApUp bound to fragment A less avidly than did NAD, and elimination of the 3'-terminal phosphate of ApUp resulted in increased affinity for the protein. These differences may reflect the absence in free fragment A of interactions with the cationic P-site, located on the toxin's B moiety."

In the presence of sodium molybdate, the macromolecule has a sedimentation coefficient of 8.3 S in sucrose gradients of low ionic strength, a Stokes radius of 56.6 A (Sephacryl S-300 columns), a molecular weight of approximately 192,000, a frictional ratio of 1.5, and an axial ratio of 8.9. The binding protein can be eluted with 0.24 M KCl as a single peak from DEAE-Sephadex A-25 columns. These results indicate that this steroid-binding protein from a primitive eukaryotic microbe has in vitro biochemical properties that are similar to those of other known steroid receptors in higher organisms."

The binding was saturable, irreversible, and inhibited by pyruvate, 2-oxoglutarate, and alpha-cyano-3-hydroxycinnamate, but not by D-lactate. It was markedly enhanced by L-alanine, but not D-alanine or beta-alanine. The binding protein(s) could be solubilized in cholic acid giving a single peak on gel filtration corresponding to a molecular weight of 26,000 and an isoelectric point of 5.1. This peak, when subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, ran in a position corresponding to an apparent molecular weight of 40,000. When membranes were treated with Triton X-100, lactate binding was retained by the Triton-insoluble fraction. The binding of L-[14C]lactate increased with incubation time, due apparently to the appearance of new binding sites and not to sequestration into vesicles. As many of the characteristics of lactate binding to rat hepatocyte plasma membranes were found to be similar to those of lactate entry into isolated hepatocytes, we speculate that the lactate-binding protein could represent part or whole of a plasma-membrane lactate transporter. Lactate-binding proteins of the same molecular weight were identified in the plasma membranes from rat erythrocytes, cardiac muscle, skeletal muscle, lung, and brain."

We used ApUp radiolabeled with 32P to measure equilibrium dissociation constants (KD), and association and dissociation rate constants (k+1 and k-1, respectively) under various conditions. Diphtheria toxin bound 1 molar equivalent of ApUp, regardless of the temperature. Values of KD were 0.2 nM (25 degrees C) and 1.8 nM (37 degrees C) as determined by flow dialysis. No difference in KD was observed between the nicked and intact forms of toxin. The dissociation rate constant showed marked variation with temperature, ranging from 1.8 X 10(-4) s-1 at 5.5 degrees C (t 1/2 of the complex = 64 min) to 2.5 X 10(-2) s-1 at 25 degrees C (t 1/2 of the complex = 28 s). By contrast, k+1 varied only by a factor of 5 over the same temperature range (2.0 X 10(7) M-1 s-1 at 5.5 degrees C; 9.6 X 10(7) M-1 s-1 at 25 degrees C). The KD at 5.5 degrees C, calculated from the ratio of k-1/k+1, is 9 pM, which represents the strongest affinity of a dinucleotide for a protein ever reported. Affinity was maximal in the range of pH 6.5 to 7.1 and was sensitive to ionic strength. Thermodynamic parameters of the system were calculated."
https://openalex.org/W1491981527,"The catalytic action of dopamine beta-hydroxylase on 1-phenyl-1-propyne results in concomitant loss of enzyme activity. At pH 5.5 and 25 degrees C, 1-phenyl-1-propyne inactivates dopamine beta-hydroxylase in a mechanism-based fashion. The inactivation rate is first-order, follows saturation kinetics, and is strictly dependent on catalysis (oxygen and ascorbate are essential). The inactivation rate of saturating 1-phenyl-1-propyne (kinact) increases from 0.08 to 0.22 min-1 when the oxygen saturation increases from 21 to 100%, respectively. Inactivation also requires a copper-containing catalytically competent enzyme. Tyramine and norepinephrine (respectively, substrate and product of the normal catalytic reaction) protect against inactivation, and no regain of enzyme activity occurs after prolonged dialysis. Experiments with ether-extracted incubation solutions (+/- enzyme) showed no difference in their gas chromatography-mass spectral patterns implying that inactivation of dopamine beta-hydroxylase by 1-phenyl-1-propyne occurs through a kinetic process with a partition ratio (kcat/kinact) equal to or near 1. Thus, this acetylenic substrate analog appears to be a very efficient mechanism-based inhibitor of dopamine beta-hydroxylase. We propose that inactivation of this enzyme by 1-phenyl-1-propyne proceeds by formation of a reactive intermediate that occurs prior to product formation and that alkylates an amino acid residue at the active site of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1550672863,"Estrogen-dependent modification of ribosomal proteins during induction of egg-yolk protein synthesis in avian liver was examined in vivo and in cultured hepatocytes. Modification of two proteins of the 40S ribosomal subunit was detected in vivo, within 40 min of injection of hormone. One of the proteins was identified as S6 and the other, tentatively, as S3a. Estrogen treatment resulted in the appearance of multiple, phosphorylated forms of S6 and a shift in electrophoretic mobility of the other protein that was consistent with its dephosphorylation. The steady state achieved within 2 h of injection could be maintained for up to 2 weeks when the hormone was administered from silastic implants. Removal of the implants resulted in a return to the preinduction state within 20-40 min. Similar modifications were induced in hepatocytes maintained in defined medium, with 17 beta-estradiol as the only hormonal supplement. In order to check on the possibility that the modifications observed could selectively influence mRNA utilization, the cytoplasmic distributions of two abundant mRNAs were monitored during the first few hours following withdrawal. One of these was serum albumin mRNA, the levels of which are unaffected by estrogen. The other was very-low-density apolipoprotein II mRNA which specifies a major egg-yolk protein. The synthesis of this mRNA is absolutely dependent on estrogen and its half-life is also markedly affected by the hormone."
https://openalex.org/W1562099670,"Placental alkaline phosphatase activity and immunoreactivity were inhibited in a parallel fashion in choriocarcinoma cells by tunicamycin, a protein glycosylation inhibitor. Tunicamycin suppressed placental alkaline phosphatase biosynthesis in addition to inhibiting protein glycosylation in general. An anti-placental alkaline phosphatase-precipitable polypeptide of 58,000 daltons was formed in the presence of this antibiotic. The 58,000-dalton polypeptide had a degradation rate similar to that of the glycosylated phosphatase monomer from control cultures. Tunicamycin suppressed placental alkaline phosphatase mRNA activity leading to the observed decrease in biosynthesis."
