https://openalex.org/W2904860816,"Background Monitoring the reasons why a considerable number of people do not receive recommended vaccinations allows identification of important trends over time, and designing and evaluating strategies to address vaccine hesitancy and increase vaccine uptake. Existing validated measures assessing vaccine hesitancy focus primarily on confidence in vaccines and the system that delivers them. However, empirical and theoretical work has stated that complacency (not perceiving diseases as high risk), constraints (structural and psychological barriers), calculation (engagement in extensive information searching), and aspects pertaining to collective responsibility (willingness to protect others) also play a role in explaining vaccination behavior. The objective was therefore to develop a validated measure of these 5C psychological antecedents of vaccination. Methods and findings Three cross-sectional studies were conducted. Study 1 uses factor analysis to develop an initial scale and assesses the sub-scales’ convergent, discriminant, and concurrent validity (N = 1,445, two German convenience-samples). In Study 2, a sample representative regarding age and gender for the German population (N = 1,003) completed the measure for vaccination in general and for specific vaccinations to assess the potential need for a vaccine-specific wording of items. Study 3 compared the novel scale’s performance with six existing measures of vaccine hesitancy (N = 350, US convenience-sample). As an outcome, a long (15-item) and short (5-item) 5C scale were developed as reliable and valid indicators of confidence, complacency, constraints, calculation, and collective responsibility. The 5C sub-scales correlated with relevant psychological concepts, such as attitude (confidence), perceived personal health status and invulnerability (complacency), self-control (constraints), preference for deliberation (calculation), and communal orientation (collective responsibility), among others. The new scale provided similar results when formulated in a general vs. vaccine-specific way (Study 2). In a comparison of seven measures the 5C scale was constantly among the scales that explained the highest amounts of variance in analyses predicting single vaccinations (between 20% and 40%; Study 3). The present studies are limited to the concurrent validity of the scales. Conclusions The 5C scale provides a novel tool to monitor psychological antecedents of vaccination and facilitates diagnosis, intervention design and evaluation. Its short version is suitable for field settings and regular global monitoring of relevant antecedents of vaccination."

Every day, more than 750 AGYW are infected with HIV. Many factors make girls and young women particularly vulnerable to HIV, including gender-based violence, exclusion from economic opportunities, and a lack of access to secondary school. The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) is dedicating significant resources through the Determined, Resilient, Empowered, AIDS-free, Mentored, and Safe (DREAMS) partnership to impact the lives of women and girls based on PEPFAR's mission to help countries achieve epidemic control of HIV/AIDS. The data show that new HIV infections must be reduced in AGYW, or the global community risks losing the extensive progress made towards reaching epidemic control. With support from PEPFAR and private sector partners-the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Gilead Sciences, Girl Effect, Johnson & Johnson and ViiV Healthcare, DREAMS works together with partner governments to deliver a core package of interventions that combines evidence-based approaches that go beyond the health sector, addressing the structural drivers that directly and indirectly increase girls' HIV risk. Not only is DREAMS an effort to reduce new HIV infections, but it aims to reduce other critical vulnerabilities such as gender-based violence. When girls and young women thrive, the effects are felt throughout their families, communities and countries."
https://openalex.org/W2605422054,"D-Wave quantum annealers represent a novel computational architecture and have attracted significant interest. Much of this interest has focused on the quantum behavior of D-Wave machines, and there have been few practical algorithms that use the D-Wave. Machine learning has been identified as an area where quantum annealing may be useful. Here, we show that the D-Wave 2X can be effectively used as part of an unsupervised machine learning method. This method takes a matrix as input and produces two low-rank matrices as output—one containing latent features in the data and another matrix describing how the features can be combined to approximately reproduce the input matrix. Despite the limited number of bits in the D-Wave hardware, this method is capable of handling a large input matrix. The D-Wave only limits the rank of the two output matrices. We apply this method to learn the features from a set of facial images and compare the performance of the D-Wave to two classical tools. This method is able to learn facial features and accurately reproduce the set of facial images. The performance of the D-Wave shows some promise, but has some limitations. It outperforms the two classical codes in a benchmark when only a short amount of computational time is allowed (200-20,000 microseconds), but these results suggest heuristics that would likely outperform the D-Wave in this benchmark."
https://openalex.org/W2904347152,"Background Mobile phone applications (apps) offer motivation and support for self-management of diabetes mellitus (DM), but their use is limited by high attrition due to insufficient consideration of end-users perspectives and usability requirements. This study aimed to examine app usage and feature preferences among people with DM, and explore their recommendations for future inclusions to foster engagement with diabetes apps. Methods The study was conducted internationally on adults with type 1 or type 2 DM using online questionnaire (quantitative) to investigate usage and preferences for app features that support diabetes self-management and semi structured telephone interview (qualitative) to explore suggestions on fostering engagement and specific educational information for inclusion into diabetes apps. Survey and interview data were analysed using descriptive/ inferential statistics and inductive thematic analysis respectively. Results A total of 217 respondents with type 1 DM (38.25%) or type 2 DM (61.8%), from 4 continents (Australia, Europe, Asia and America) participated in the survey. About half of the respondents (48%) use apps, mainly with features for tracking blood glucose (56.6%), blood pressure (51.9%) and food calories (48.1%). Preferred features in future apps include nutrient values of foods (56.7%), blood glucose (54.8%), physical exercise tracker (47%), health data analytics (42.9%) and education on diabetes self-management (40.6%). Irrespective of the type of DM, participants proposed future apps that are user friendly, support healthy eating, provide actionable reminders and consolidate data across peripheral health devices. Participants with type 1 DM recommended customised features with news update on developments in the field of diabetes. Nominated specific educational topics included tips on problem solving, use of insulin pump therapy, signs of diabetes complication and transitioning from paediatric into adult care. Conclusions The study has highlighted patients’ perspectives on essential components for inclusion in diabetes apps to promote engagement and foster better health outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2904871856,"The present study underlines a statistically optimized, low cost, effective approach for efficient co-valorization of two non-efficiently utilized, highly accumulated, raw agro-industrial wastes: corn cob and glycerol for co-production of natural biopigments: monascus orange and red pigments by the aid of Monascus purpureus strain ATCC 16436. A three step sequential, statistical modeling approach: one variable at a time (OVAT), Plackett-Burman design (PBD), and central composite design (CCD) was employed to optimize the production of monascus pigments using co-solid state fermentation of the two raw agro-industrial wastes. Corn cob among other carbon sources (e.g., rice grains, sugarcane bagasse, and potato peel) was the most appropriate substrate triggering co-production of orange and red monascus pigments; deduced from OVAT. Glycerol and inoculum size proved to impose significant consequences (P<0.05) on the production of monascus pigments as inferred from PBD. The optimal levels of inoculum size (12 x 1011 spores/mL) and glycerol (2.17 M) did achieve a maximal color value of 133.77 and 108.02 color value units/mL of orange and red pigments, respectively at 30 oC after 10 days; concluded from CCD with an agitation speed of 150 rpm. Present data would underpin the large scale production of monascus pigments using the present approach for efficient exploitation of such biopigments in food, pharmaceutical and textile industries."
https://openalex.org/W2754727929,"Classical simulation of quantum computation is necessary for studying the numerical behavior of quantum algorithms, as there does not yet exist a large viable quantum computer on which to perform numerical tests. Tensor network (TN) contraction is an algorithmic method that can efficiently simulate some quantum circuits, often greatly reducing the computational cost over methods that simulate the full Hilbert space. In this study we implement a tensor network contraction program for simulating quantum circuits using multi-core compute nodes. We show simulation results for the Max-Cut problem on 3- through 7-regular graphs using the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA), successfully simulating up to 100 qubits. We test two different methods for generating the ordering of tensor index contractions: one is based on the tree decomposition of the line graph, while the other generates ordering using a straight-forward stochastic scheme. Through studying instances of QAOA circuits, we show the expected result that as the treewidth of the quantum circuit's line graph decreases, TN contraction becomes significantly more efficient than simulating the whole Hilbert space. The results in this work suggest that tensor contraction methods are superior only when simulating Max-Cut/QAOA with graphs of regularities approximately five and below. Insight into this point of equal computational cost helps one determine which simulation method will be more efficient for a given quantum circuit. The stochastic contraction method outperforms the line graph based method only when the time to calculate a reasonable tree decomposition is prohibitively expensive. Finally, we release our software package, qTorch (Quantum TensOR Contraction Handler), intended for general quantum circuit simulation."
https://openalex.org/W2903761486,"Understanding the relationship between carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and the urbanization of national populations has been a key concern for environmental scholars for several decades. Although sophisticated modeling techniques have been developed to explore the connection between increases in urban populations and CO2 emissions, none has attempted to assess whether declines in urbanization have an effect on emissions that is not symmetrical with that of growth in urbanization. The present study uses panel data on CO2 emissions and the percentage of individuals living in urban areas, as well as a variety of other structural factors, for less-developed countries from 1960–2010, to empirically assess whether the effect of growth in urban populations on emissions is symmetrical with the effect of decline. Findings indicate that the effect of growth/decline in urban populations on CO2 emissions is asymmetrical, where a decline in urbanization reduces emissions to a much greater degree than urbanization increases emissions. We hypothesize that this is at least in part because deurbanization is connected with disruptions to the production and distribution of goods and services and/or access to electricity and other energy sources. Our finding suggests that not only the absolute level of urbanization of nations matters for emissions, but also how the patterns of migration between rural and urban areas change over time. Future research should be mindful of the processes behind deurbanization when exploring socioeconomic drivers of CO2 emissions."
https://openalex.org/W2904510532,"Objective The objective was to predict insufficient response to 3 months methotrexate (MTX) in DMARD naïve rheumatoid arthritis patients. Methods A Multivariable logistic regression model of rheumatoid arthritis patients starting MTX was developed in a derivation cohort with 285 patients starting MTX in a clinical multicentre, stratified single-blinded trial, performed in seven secondary care clinics and a tertiary care clinic. The model was validated in a validation cohort with 102 patients starting MTX at a tertiary care clinic. Outcome was insufficient response (disease activity score (DAS)28 >3.2) after 3 months of MTX treatment. Clinical characteristics, lifestyle variables, genetic and metabolic biomarkers were determined at baseline in both cohorts. These variables were dichotomized and used to construct a multivariable prediction model with backward logistic regression analysis. Results The prediction model for insufficient response in the derivation cohort, included: DAS28>5.1, Health Assessment Questionnaire>0.6, current smoking, BMI>25 kg/m2, ABCB1 rs1045642 genotype, ABCC3 rs4793665 genotype, and erythrocyte-folate<750 nmol/L. In the derivation cohort, AUC of ROC curve was 0.80 (95%CI: 0.73–0.86), and 0.80 (95%CI: 0.69–0.91) in the validation cohort. Betas of the prediction model were transformed into total risk score (range 0–8). At cutoff of ≥4, probability for insufficient response was 44%. Sensitivity was 71%, specificity 72%, with positive and negative predictive value of 72% and 71%. Conclusions A prognostics prediction model for insufficient response to MTX in 2 prospective RA cohorts by combining genetic, metabolic, clinical and lifestyle variables was developed and validated. This model satisfactorily identified RA patients with high risk of insufficient response to MTX."
https://openalex.org/W2905437218,"Criminal justice (CJ) settings disproportionately include populations at high risk for acquiring HIV, and CJ-involved individuals are often at the intersection of multiple overlapping risk factors. However, few studies have examined attitudes about pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) among incarcerated men who have sex with men (MSM). This study explored interest in, knowledge of, and barriers to PrEP uptake among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men at the Rhode Island Department of Corrections. Using semi-structured interviews, 26 MSM were interviewed about PrEP knowledge, interest, timing preferences for provision (e.g. before or after release), and barriers to uptake and adherence during community re-entry. Interviews were coded and analyzed using a general inductive approach. Participants demonstrated low initial knowledge of PrEP but high interest after being told more about it. Participants self-identified risk factors for HIV acquisition, including condomless sex and substance use. In addition, participants preferred provision of PrEP prior to release. Post-release barriers to PrEP uptake and adherence included 1) concerns about costs of PrEP medications; 2) anticipated partner or family disapproval; 3) lack of access to transportation; 4) unstable housing; 5) compounding impacts of multiple hardships leading to a de-prioritization of PrEP and 6) fears of future re-incarceration. These results point to the need for future PrEP interventions among incarcerated populations that address incarceration and PrEP related barriers during community re-entry via wraparound services that address PrEP and incarceration-related barriers."
https://openalex.org/W2903823902,"Many studies have demonstrated the existence of simple, unidimensional socioeconomic gradients in body mass index (BMI). However, in the present paper we move beyond such traditional analyses by simultaneously considering multiple demographic and socioeconomic dimensions. Using the Spanish National Health Survey 2011-2012, we apply intersectionality theory and multilevel analysis of individual heterogeneity and discriminatory accuracy (MAIHDA) to analyze 14,190 adults nested within 108 intersectional strata defined by combining categories of gender, age, income, educational achievement and living situation. We develop two multilevel models to obtain information on stratum-specific BMI averages and the degree of clustering of BMI within strata expressed by the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). The first model is a simple variance components analysis that provides a detailed mapping of the BMI disparities in the population and measures the accuracy of stratum membership to predict individual BMI. The second model includes the variables used to define the intersectional strata as a way to identify stratum-specific interactions. The first model suggests moderate but meaningful clustering of individual BMI within the intersectional strata (ICC = 12.4%). Compared with the population average (BMI = 26.07 Kg/m2), the stratum of cohabiting 18-35-year-old females with medium income and high education presents the lowest BMI (-3.7 Kg/m2), while cohabiting 36-64-year-old females with low income and low education show the highest BMI (+2.6 Kg/m2). In the second model, the ICC falls to 1.9%, suggesting the existence of only very small stratum specific interaction effects. We confirm the existence of a socioeconomic gradient in BMI. Compared with traditional analyses, the intersectional MAIHDA approach provides a better mapping of socioeconomic and demographic inequalities in BMI. Because of the moderate clustering, public health policies aiming to reduce BMI in Spain should not solely focus on the intersectional strata with the highest BMI, but should also consider whole population polices."
https://openalex.org/W2905289338,"There is a growing interest on the role of autophagy in diabetes pathophysiology, where development of neuropathy is one of the most frequent comorbidities. We have previously demonstrated that neuropathic pain after nerve damage is exacerbated in autophagy-defective heterozygous Ambra1 mice. Here, we show the existence of a prediabetic state in Ambra1 mice, characterized by hyperglycemia, intolerance to glucose and insulin resistance. Thus, we further investigate the hypothesis that prediabetes may account for the exacerbation of allodynia and chronic pain and that counteracting the autophagy deficit may relieve the neuropathic condition. We took advantage from caloric restriction (CR) able to exert a double action: a powerful increase of autophagy and a control on the metabolic status. We found that CR ameliorates neuropathy throughout anti-inflammatory and metabolic mechanisms both in Ambra1 and in WT animals subjected to nerve injury. Moreover, we discovered that nerve lesion represents, per se, a metabolic stressor and CR reinstates glucose homeostasis, insulin resistance, incomplete fatty acid oxidation and energy metabolism. As autophagy inducer, CR promotes and anticipates Schwann cell autophagy via AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) that facilitates remyelination in peripheral nerve. In summary, we provide new evidence for the role of autophagy in glucose metabolism and identify in energy depletion by dietary restriction a therapeutic approach in the fight against neuropathic pain."
https://openalex.org/W2903911795,"Pathogenic basidiomycetous yeast, Cryptococcus neoformans, causes fatal meningitis in immunocompromised individuals. Fluconazole (FLC) is a fungistatic drug commonly administered to treat cryptococcosis. Unfortunately, FLC-resistant strains characterized by various degree of chromosomal instability were isolated from clinical patients. Importantly, the underlying mechanisms that lead to chromosomal instability in FLC-treated C. neoformans remain elusive. Previous studies in fungal and mammalian cells link chromosomal instability to the reactive oxygen species (ROS). This study provides the evidence that exposure of C. neoformans to FLC induces accumulation of intracellular ROS, which correlates with plasma membrane damage. FLC caused transcription changes of oxidative stress related genes encoding superoxide dismutase (SOD1), catalase (CAT3), and thioredoxin reductase (TRR1). Strikingly, FLC contributed to an increase of the DNA damage in vitro, when complexed with iron or copper in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. Strains with isogenic deletion of copper response protein metallothionein were more susceptible to FLC. Addition of ascorbic acid (AA), an anti-oxidant at 10 mM, reduced the inhibitory effects of FLC. Consistent with potential effects of FLC on DNA integrity and chromosomal segregation, FLC treatment led to elevated transcription of RAD54 and repression of cohesin-encoding gene SCC1. We propose that FLC forms complexes with metals and contributes to elevated ROS, which may lead to chromosomal instability in C. neoformans."
https://openalex.org/W2904215005,"Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), endopeptidases with diverse biochemical functions, can promote cancer cell invasion and metastasis by degrading the extracellular matrix. A high matrix metalloproteinase-14 (MMP-14) expression in gastric cancer tissue has been associated with metastasis and poor prognosis. To further understand this association, we investigated serum MMP-14 as a biomarker in gastric cancer patients. The patient cohort consisted of 240 gastric adenocarcinoma patients who underwent surgery at Helsinki University Hospital, Finland, between 2000 and 2009. We determined the soluble MMP-14 serum levels using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We then calculated the associations between serum levels and clinicopathologic variables using the Mann-Whitney U-test or the Kruskal-Wallis test. We constructed survival curves using the Kaplan-Meier method and calculating the hazard ratios using the Cox proportional hazard model. We revealed a positive association between a high serum MMP-14 level and stages III-IV (p = 0.029), and between a high serum MMP-14 and distant metastasis (p = 0.022). Patients with a low serum MMP-14 had a 5-year disease-specific survival of 49.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] 45.5-52.9), whereas patients with a high serum MMP-14 had a 5-year survival of 22.1% (95% CI 15.2-29.0; p = 0.001). High serum MMP-14 was a statistically significant prognostic factor among patients with an intestinal type of cancer (hazard ratio [HR] 3.54; 95% CI 1.51-8.33; p = 0.004), but not among patients with a diffuse type. The serum MMP-14 level remained an independent prognostic factor in our multivariate survival analysis (HR 1.55; 95% CI 1.02-2.35; p = 0.040). This study indicates for the first time that high serum soluble MMP-14 levels in gastric cancer serves as a marker for a poor prognosis, possibly indicating the presence of distant metastases."
https://openalex.org/W2903756093,"A large number of coastal ecosystems globally are subjected to concurrent hypoxic and acidified conditions that will likely intensify and expand with continued climate change. In temperate regions, the spawning of many important organisms including the Atlantic blue crab Callinectes sapidus occurs during the summer months when the severity of coastal hypoxia and acidification is the greatest. While the blue crab earliest larval stage can be exposed to co-occurring hypoxia and acidification observed in many coastal ecosystems, the effects of these concurrent stressors on larval blue crab survival is unknown. This study investigated the individual and combined consequences of low dissolved oxygen (DO) and low pH on blue crab larvae survival through a series of short-term experiments. During 14-day experiments with moderately hypoxic conditions (117–127 μM O2 or 3.74–4.06 mg L-1) and acidified conditions (pH on total scale of 7.16–7.33), low DO and low pH individually and significantly reduced larval survival by 60% and 49%, respectively, with the combination of stressors reducing survival by 87% compared to the control treatment (210–269 μM O2 or 6.72–8.61 mg L-1, 7.91–7.94 DO and pH, respectively). During 4-day experiments with lower DO levels (68–83 μM O2 or 2.18–2.62 mg L-1) and comparable pH levels of 7.29–7.39, low DO individually reduced survival by >90% compared to the control (261–267 μM O2 or 8.35–8.54 mg L-1, 7.92–7.97 DO and pH, respectively), whereas low pH had no effect and there was no interaction between stressors. Over a 4-day period, the DO threshold at which 50% of the larval blue crab population died (LC50) was 121 μM O2 (3.86 mgL-1). In 14-day experiments, the DO and pH effects were additive, yielding survival rates lower than the individual treatments, and significantly correlated with DO and pH concentrations. Collectively, these findings indicate that blue crab sensitivity to both low DO and low pH are acute within the larval stage, depend on the intensity and duration of exposure, and leads to mortality, thereby potentially contributing to the interannual variability and possible regional declines of this fishery."
https://openalex.org/W2904824406,"The emissions of BVOCs from oilseed rape (Brassica napus), both when the plant is exposed to clean air and when it is fumigated with ozone at environmentally-relevant mixing ratios (ca. 135 ppbv), were measured under controlled laboratory conditions. Emissions of BVOCs were recorded from combined leaf and root chambers using a recently developed Selective Reagent Ionisation-Time of Flight-Mass Spectrometer (SRI-ToF-MS) enabling BVOC detection with high time and mass resolution, together with the ability to identify certain molecular functionality. Emissions of BVOCs from below-ground were found to be dominated by sulfur compounds including methanethiol, dimethyl disulfide and dimethyl sulfide, and these emissions did not change following fumigation of the plant with ozone. Emissions from above-ground plant organs exposed to clean air were dominated by methanol, monoterpenes, 4-oxopentanal and methanethiol. Ozone fumigation of the plants caused a rapid decrease in monoterpene and sesquiterpene concentrations in the leaf chamber and increased concentrations of ca. 20 oxygenated species, almost doubling the total carbon lost by the plant leaves as volatiles. The drop in sesquiterpenes concentrations was attributed to ozonolysis occurring to a major extent on the leaf surface. The drop in monoterpene concentrations was attributed to gas phase reactions with OH radicals deriving from ozonolysis reactions. As plant-emitted terpenoids have been shown to play a role in plant-plant and plant-insect signalling, the rapid loss of these species in the air surrounding the plants during photochemical pollution episodes may have a significant impact on plant-plant and plant-insect communications."
https://openalex.org/W2899174012,"Physical activity shows promise for reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and protection against cognitive decline among individuals with and without AD. Older adults face many barriers to adoption of physically active lifestyles and people with AD face even further challenges. Physical activity is a promising non-pharmacological approach to improve depressive symptoms, but little is known about the impact of depressive symptoms as a potential barrier to engagement in physical activity. The present study aimed to investigate depressive symptoms as a potential barrier for participation in physical activity across a range of dementia severity.We used longitudinal structural equation modelling to investigate the bi-directional relationship between depressive symptoms and physical activity in 594 older adults with and without AD over a 2 year longitudinal follow up. Participants ranged from no cognitive impairment to moderately severe AD.We found that depressive symptoms predicted reduced engagement in subsequent physical activity, but physical activity did not predict subsequent reductions in depressive symptoms.We conclude that depressive symptoms may be an important barrier to engagement in physical activity that may be addressed in clinical practice and intervention research."
https://openalex.org/W2951503319,"Smoking is still a public health concern in many countries, especially among young adults. Consequently, we determined what factors affect university students' smoking behavior in Turkey.This cross-sectional study was conducted between March and June 2017 using a simple random sampling method. A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect information on participants' (N = 2,505; mean age = 20.9 ± 2.5 years; 58.9% women) sociodemographic characteristics, cigarette smoking status, and related risk factors. Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression analysis were performed with the Backward likelihood-ratio method.Students were completing either two- or four-year degrees (45.6% and 54.4%, respectively). Regarding familial smoking behavior, 36.1% had a father who smoked, 10.3% had a mother who smoked, and 15.0% had siblings who smoked. Among participants, 27.9% were current smokers: 46% of the men and 15.3% of the women. Mean smoking onset age was 16.34 ± 2.72 years (15.65 ± 2.67 years for men and 16.34 ± 2.72 for women (p < .05). Mean Fagerströmtest score was 4.43 ± 1.82, and women had lower test scores than did men (p < .05). After controlling for potential confounders in multivariate analyses, five factors were significantly positively associated with current smoking: being a man (odds ratio (OR): 3.43; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.75-4.28), studying in a two-year program (OR: 1.74; 95% CI: 1.39-2.18), having at least one immediate family member who smoked (OR: 1.63; 95% CI: 1.31-2.04), having all close friends who smoked (OR: 1.81; 95% CI: 1.40-2.33), and alcohol consumption (OR: 4.39; 95% CI: 3.51-5.49).There was a higher smoking rate among our study population, both compared to similar national studies and Turkey's overall smoking rate. Underlying factors should be evaluated via qualitative studies and preventive strategies should be implemented accordingly."
https://openalex.org/W2904442994,"To reduce morbidity and mortality caused by visceral leishmaniasis (VL), the Brazilian Visceral Leishmaniasis Control and Surveillance Program promotes the diagnosis and treatment of cases, vector control, euthanasia of seropositive dogs, and health education. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of these measures is questionable as they lead to little reduction in the transmission of the disease. Thus, the effectiveness of strategies such as insecticide-impregnated collars, spot-on insecticides, and immunization of dogs should be assessed. Herein, we evaluated the effectiveness of deltamethrin-impregnated collars on reducing the incidence of Leishmania infantum infection in dogs living in an endemic area of VL. An intervention study was conducted and a total 5,850 dogs were analyzed in baseline. Of these 3,742 seronegative dogs were divided into two groups: collared and uncollared (control). Dogs were followed for 12 months and three interventions were performed. The Cox regression model was used to evaluate the effectiveness of the collar. All analyzes were performed by Intention-to-treat and per-protocol. By intention-to-treat, the incidence rates of L. infantum infection were 7.5 and 7.9 in the collar group, and 6.5 and 13.2 per 1,000 dogs-months in the control group after 6 and 12 months, respectively. In the per-protocol analysis, the incidence rates in the control group were similar to those observed in the intention-to-treat analysis. In the collar group, the incidence rate was 5.1/1,000 dogs-months after 6 and 12 months. The effectiveness by intention-to-treat after adjustment by the multivariate Cox model was 48%. In the analysis per-protocol, the effectiveness increased to 63%. Although collar use was effective when it was evaluated by intention-to-treat, higher effectiveness was found in the per-protocol analysis after one year of follow-up. The data emphasize the importance of the uninterrupted use of deltamethrin-impregnated collars to increase protection against canine VL."
https://openalex.org/W2905183794,"Thrips palmi is a widely distributed major agricultural pest in the tropics and subtropics, causing significant losses in cucurbit and solanaceous crops through feeding damage and transmission of tospoviruses. Thrips palmi is a vector of capsicum chlorosis virus (CaCV) in Australia. The present understanding of transmission biology and potential effects of CaCV on T. palmi is limited. To gain insights into molecular responses to CaCV infection, we performed RNA-Seq to identify thrips transcripts that are differentially-abundant during virus infection of adults. De-novo assembly of the transcriptome generated from whole bodies of T. palmi adults generated 166,445 contigs, of which ~24% contained a predicted open reading frame. We identified 1,389 differentially-expressed (DE) transcripts, with comparable numbers up- (708) and down-regulated (681) in virus-exposed thrips compared to non-exposed thrips. Approximately 59% of these DE transcripts had significant matches to NCBI non-redundant proteins (Blastx) and Blast2GO identified provisional functional categories among the up-regulated transcripts in virus-exposed thrips including innate immune response-related genes, salivary gland and/or gut-associated genes and vitellogenin genes. The majority of the immune-related proteins are known to serve functions in lysosome activity and melanisation in insects. Most of the up-regulated oral and extra-oral digestion-associated genes appear to be involved in digestion of proteins, lipids and plant cell wall components which may indirectly enhance the likelihood or frequency of virus transmission or may be involved in the regulation of host defence responses. Most of the down-regulated transcripts fell into the gene ontology functional category of ‘structural constituent of cuticle’. Comparison to DE genes responsive to tomato spotted wilt virus in Frankliniella occidentalis indicates conservation of some thrips molecular responses to infection by different tospoviruses. This study assembled the first transcriptome in the genus Thrips and provides important data to broaden our understanding of networks of molecular interactions between thrips and tospoviruses."
https://openalex.org/W2904016702,"We introduce the CDRP (Concatenated Diagnostic-Relapse Prognostic) architecture for multi-task deep learning that incorporates a clinical algorithm, e.g., a risk stratification schema to improve prognostic profiling. We present the first application to survival prediction in High-Risk (HR) Neuroblastoma from transcriptomics data, a task that studies from the MAQC consortium have shown to remain the hardest among multiple diagnostic and prognostic endpoints predictable from the same dataset. To obtain a more accurate risk stratification needed for appropriate treatment strategies, CDRP combines a first component (CDRP-A) synthesizing a diagnostic task and a second component (CDRP-N) dedicated to one or more prognostic tasks. The approach leverages the advent of semi-supervised deep learning structures that can flexibly integrate multimodal data or internally create multiple processing paths. CDRP-A is an autoencoder trained on gene expression on the HR/non-HR risk stratification by the Children's Oncology Group, obtaining a 64-node representation in the bottleneck layer. CDRP-N is a multi-task classifier for two prognostic endpoints, i.e., Event-Free Survival (EFS) and Overall Survival (OS). CDRP-A provides the HR embedding input to the CDRP-N shared layer, from which two branches depart to model EFS and OS, respectively. To control for selection bias, CDRP is trained and evaluated using a Data Analysis Protocol (DAP) developed within the MAQC initiative. CDRP was applied on Illumina RNA-Seq of 498 Neuroblastoma patients (HR: 176) from the SEQC study (12,464 Entrez genes) and on Affymetrix Human Exon Array expression profiles (17,450 genes) of 247 primary diagnostic Neuroblastoma of the TARGET NBL cohort. On the SEQC HR patients, CDRP achieves Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) 0.38 for EFS and MCC = 0.19 for OS in external validation, improving over published SEQC models. We show that a CDRP-N embedding is indeed parametrically associated to increasing severity and the embedding can be used to better stratify patients' survival."
https://openalex.org/W2903591905,"Human activities including those in crop gene banks are subject to errors, especially during seed multiplication and maintenance of seed germination. Therefore, the most serious problem of gene banks is authenticity of the accessions and their genotypic purity. There are many methods for determining the identity of varieties, but comparisons between current data and past records are not easy since the latter are often missing. Breeding barley resistant to powdery mildew caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei (Bgh) was traditionally based on incorporating major genes into new varieties and the results have been published. Our goal was to identify resistance genes to powdery mildew in accessions of the Czech spring barley core collection and compare these data with earlier information to establish the authenticity of the accessions. Two hundred and twenty-three accessions of the collection including 665 single plant progenies were tested. Sixty-four selected reference isolates of Bgh representing the world diversity of the pathogen were used for resistance tests. Twenty-two known resistance genes were postulated either separately or in combinations. In the collection, 151 homogeneous accessions were found, but the resistances of nine of them were inconsistent with published data and in 12 accessions their authenticity is doubtful. The remaining 72 accessions were heterogeneous and comprised 176 resistance genotypes, 54 of which were probably mechanical admixtures of other varieties. There are several pathogens of cereals, e.g. rusts and mildews, against which many resistance genes in host crops have also been exploited. Knowledge of these resistances can assist in maintaining pure and genuine stocks in gene banks. Seed purity and the authenticity of accessions can subsequently be checked with more advanced methods."
https://openalex.org/W2903775227,"Public health spending in India has been traditionally one of the lowest globally. Punjab is one of the states with highest proportion of out-of-pocket expenditures for healthcare in India. We undertook this study to produce the sub-national health accounts (SNHA) for Punjab state in India.We used System of Health Accounts (SHA) 2011 framework for preparing health accounts for Punjab state. Data on health spending by government was obtained from concerned public sector departments both at state and central level. Estimates on Out-of-Pocket Expenditures (OOPE) expenditure were derived from National Sample Survey (NSS) 71st round data, Consumer Expenditure Survey (CES) data and Pharmatrac. Primary surveys were done for assessing health expenditure data by firms and non-governmental organizations. All estimates of healthcare expenditures reported in our paper pertain to 2013-14, and are reported in both Indian National Rupee (INR) and United States Dollar (US $),using average conversion rate of INR 60.50 per US $.In 2013-14, the current health expenditures (CE) in Punjab was INR 134,680million (US $ 2245 million) which was 4.02% of its gross state domestic product (GSDP).However, public spending on health was 0.95% of GSDP i.e. 21% of the total health expenditure (THE), while 79% was private expenditure. In per capita terms, THE in Punjab was INR 4963 (US $ 82.03). In terms of functions, medical goods (41.6%) and curative care (37%) consumed larger share of expenditure in the Punjab state. Households spent 52% of expenditures for medicines and other pharmaceutical goods. Risk pooling mechanisms are being adopted to a lesser extent in the state.The healthcare in Punjab is largely financed through private OOPE. Currently, public health spending in Punjab is inadequate to meet the healthcare demands of population, which is less than 1% of state's GSDP. Monitoring public resources is very important for better resource allocations. Health Accounts production is useful in order to assess future trends and impact of health financing policies on goals of universal health coverage and should be made a part of routine monitoring system both at national and sub-national level."
https://openalex.org/W2904651377,"The Nurse Family Partnership Program developed in the USA, designed to improve mother and infant/child outcomes, has reported lower rates of child protection system involvement. The study tested the hypothesis that an adapted Nurse Family Partnership Program implemented in an Aboriginal community in Central Australia (the FPP) would improve Child Protection outcomes.This was a retrospective and prospective cohort study drawing on linked administrative data, including birth registry, primary health care client information system, FPP program data, and child protection data. Participants were children of women eligible for the FPP program (an exposed and a control group of women, eligible but not referred) live-born between 1/3/2009 (program commencement) and 31/12/2015. Child protection data covered all reports, investigations, substantiations and out-of-home care placements from the time of the child's birth to 31/12/2016. Generalised linear modelling was used to estimate the relative risk (RR) of involvement with child protection and type of involvement (report, investigation, substantiation, out-of-home-care placement) among FPP and control children.FPP mothers (n = 291) were on average younger, were more likely to be first-time mothers and experiencing housing instability than control mothers (n = 563). Among younger mothers ≤20 years, FPP children had statistically significantly lower rates of involvement with child protection (ARRreport = 0.49, 95% CI: 0.29 to 0.82; ARRinvestigation = 0.34, 95% CI: 0.19 to 0.64; ARRsubstantiation = 0.45, 95% CI: 0.21 to 0.96) and experience fewer days in care (ARR = 0.10, 95% CI: 0.02 to 0.48). Among children of first-time mothers, FPP children also had statistically significantly lower rates of involvement with child protection (ARRreport = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.30 to 0.83; ARRinvestigation = 0.36, 95% CI: 0.19 to 0.67; ARRsubstantiation = 0.38, 95% CI: 0.18 to 0.80) and fewer days in care (ARR = 0.06, 95% CI: 0.01 to 0.27).Study results suggest a modified Nurse Family Partnership delivered by an Indigenous community-controlled organisation may have reduced child protection system involvement in a highly vulnerable First Nations population, especially in younger or first-time mothers. Testing these results with an RCT design is desirable."
https://openalex.org/W2905414690,"This study examines the roles of time perspective, affect, and locus of control in mediating the relationship between regulatory mode and procrastination. Participants filled out the Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory, Positive and Negative Affect Schedule Scale, Multidimensional Locus of Control Inventory, Locomotion and Assessment Scale, and Lay’s General Procrastination scale. Results showed that procrastination was negatively related to locomotion orientation but positively associated with assessment orientation. The relations between regulatory mode and procrastination were mediated by negative affective state, internal sense of control, and negative past and future time perspectives. These findings suggest not only a behavioral link between regulatory mode and procrastination but also affective and cognitive differences in locomotion and assessment orientations that may account for such linkage. The present results also provide empirical support for the theory of locomotion-temporality interface (Kruglanski, Pierro, & Higgins, 2016)."
https://openalex.org/W2904473911,"We present an algorithm for a class of statistical inference problems. The main idea is to reformulate the inference problem as an optimization procedure, based on the generation of surrogate (auxiliary) functions. This approach is motivated by the MM algorithm, combined with the systematic and iterative structure of the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. The resulting algorithm can deal with hidden variables in Maximum Likelihood and Maximum a Posteriori estimation problems, Instrumental Variables, Regularized Optimization and Constrained Optimization problems. The advantage of the proposed algorithm is to provide a systematic procedure to build surrogate functions for a class of problems where hidden variables are usually involved. Numerical examples show the benefits of the proposed approach."
https://openalex.org/W2904850138,"The aim of this study was to investigate the metabolism of the spleen, bone marrow (BM), and liver from preoperative F-18 FDG PET/CT scans for the prediction of recurrence in breast cancer.We retrospectively included 153 patients diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) of the breast who underwent preoperative F-18 FDG PET/CT scan and a curative operation. The mean standardized uptake value (SUVmean) of the spleen, liver, and BM and maximum SUV (SUVmax) of primary tumors were measured. The relationships between spleen, BM, and liver metabolism and clinicopathologic parameters were evaluated, and possible prognostic parameters predicting recurrence were assessed using disease-free survival (DFS).Spleen SUVmean was significantly correlated with primary tumor SUVmax, pathologic T (pT) stage, and histologic grade of primary tumor. BM SUVmean also showed a positive correlation with primary tumor SUVmax. Spleen SUVmean were significantly associated with recurrence from binary logistic regression analysis (P = 0.004). Spleen, BM, liver, and primary tumor SUVs were all significant prognostic factors for DFS in univariate Cox regression analysis (all P<0.024). Among all PET parameters analyzed, spleen SUVmean ≥ 2.21 (P = 0.032) was in the multivariable analysis the powerful poor prognostic factor predicting DFS that was independent of other clinicopathological features like T stage (pT >2; P = 0.009) and estrogen receptor (ER) status (ER negativity; P = 0.001).Splenic metabolism together with pT stage and ER status was an independent prognostic factor for predicting recurrence in breast cancer. Metabolic activity of reticuloendothelial system such as spleen, liver or BM on preoperative F-18 FDG PET/CT can be a meritorious imaging factor for discriminating patients with IDC that require adjunctive therapy to prevent recurrence."
https://openalex.org/W2905162173,"Gender segregation exists in all walks of life. One of the most common forms of institutionalized gender segregation is perhaps single-sex schooling. Because schooling experience has important influence on students’ psychosocial development, interest in gender-segregated education has been reviving over the globe. Skeptics of single-sex schooling have suggested that such schooling may increase students’ gender salience (awareness of gender in categorizations), reduce opportunities for mixed-gender interactions, and increase mixed-gender anxiety, but little evidence has been found. It is critical to explore how single-sex schooling is associated with these psychosocial outcomes in adolescents and young adults because they are in the developmental stage when the desire and need to establish mixed-gender relationships increase. We report two systematic studies on gender salience, mixed-gender friendships, and mixed-gender anxiety on 2059 high school students and 456 college students from single-sex or coeducational schools. Even with demographic background controlled, results suggested higher gender salience in single-sex school students in the high school sample, and greater mixed-gender anxiety and fewer mixed-gender friendships in these students in both samples. These differences were not moderated by student gender and were similar in first-year versus senior college students. Moreover, mixed-gender friendships, though not gender salience, appeared to engage in a possibly bi-directional mediation relationship with mixed-gender anxiety that is consistent with a vicious cycle of escalating anxiety and lack of mixed-gender interaction among single-sex school students. These findings help fill the knowledge gap about the correlates of gender-segregated schooling and shed light on the precursors of later social and achievement differences between single-sex and coeducational school students."
https://openalex.org/W2905409366,"The development of a substance or inhibitor-based treatment strategy for the prevention of aortic valve stenosis is a challenge and a main focus of medical research in this area. One strategy may be to use the tankyrase inhibitor XAV-939, which leads to Axin stabilisation and subsequent destruction of the β-catenin complex and dephosphorylation of β-catenin. The dephosphorylated active form of β-catenin (non-phospho-β-catenin) then promotes nuclear transcription that leads to osteogenesis. The aims of the present study were to develop an experimental system for inducing in vitro calcification of human aortic valvular interstitial cells (VICs) to investigate the potential anti-calcific effect of XAV-939 and to analyse expression of the Wnt signalling proteins and Sox9, a chondrogenesis regulator, in this model. Calcification of human VIC cultures was induced by cultivation in an osteogenic medium and the effect of co-incubation with 1μM XAV-939 was monitored. Calcification was quantified when mineral deposits were visible in culture and was histologically verified by von Kossa or Alizarin red staining and by IR-spectroscopy. Protein expression of alkaline phosphatase, Axin, β-catenin and Sox9 were quantified by western blotting. In 58% of the VIC preparations, calcification was induced in an osteogenic culture medium and was accompanied by upregulation of alkaline phosphatase. The calcification induction was prevented by the XAV-939 co-treatment and the alkaline phosphatase upregulation was suppressed. As expected, Axin was upregulated, but the levels of active non-phospho-β-catenin were also enhanced. Sox9 was induced during XAV-939 treatment but apparently not as a result of downregulation of β-catenin signalling. XAV-939 was therefore able to prevent calcification of human VIC cultures, and XAV-939 treatment was accompanied by upregulation of active non-phospho-β-catenin. Although XAV-939 does not downregulate active β-catenin, treatment with XAV-939 results in Sox9 upregulation that may prevent the calcification process."

Therefore, we sought to evaluate the clinical implications of DM in patients with CAD who underwent contemporary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).Based on the National Health Insurance claims data in South Korea, patients aged 18 years or older who had undergone PCI for the diagnosis of CAD between 2011 and 2015 were analyzed. Patients were classified into the DM (n = 26,872) and non-DM (n = 54,243) groups. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality, and it was compared between the two groups via a propensity score matching analysis.The study population was categorized as patients with angina (n = 49,228) or acute myocardial infarction (AMI, n = 31,887). The study population had a median follow-up of 2.1 years (interquartile range, 1.1-3.2). After the propensity score matching analysis, 8,157 and 4,266 pairs of patients with angina and AMI were identified, respectively. In the matched angina group, the incidence of all-cause death was significantly higher in patients with DM (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 1.30; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.16-1.47; p<0.001) than in those without DM. Moreover, in the matched AMI group, the incidence of all-cause death was significantly higher in patients with DM (aHR: 1.35; 95% CI: 1.19-1.53; p<0.001) than in those without DM.In patients undergoing contemporary PCI in Korea, the presence of DM was associated with poorer clinical outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2904590639,"Rheoencephalography is a simple and inexpensive technique for cerebral blood flow assessment, however, it is not used in clinical practice since its correlation to clinical conditions has not yet been extensively proved. The present study investigates the ability of Poincaré Plot descriptors from rheoencephalography signals to detect apneas in volunteers.A group of 16 subjects participated in the study. Rheoencephalography data from baseline and apnea periods were recorded and Poincaré Plot descriptors were extracted from the reconstructed attractors with different time lags (τ). Among the set of extracted features, those presenting significant differences between baseline and apnea recordings were used as inputs to four different classifiers to optimize the apnea detection.Three features showed significant differences between apnea and baseline signals: the Poincaré Plot ratio (SDratio), its correlation (R) and the Complex Correlation Measure (CCM). Those differences were optimized for time lags smaller than those recommended in previous works for other biomedical signals, all of them being lower than the threshold established by the position of the inflection point in the CCM curves. The classifier showing the best performance was the classification tree, with 81% accuracy and an area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic of 0.927. This performance was obtained using a single input parameter, either SDratio or R.Poincaré Plot features extracted from the attractors of rheoencephalographic signals were able to track cerebral blood flow changes provoked by breath holding. Even though further validation with independent datasets is needed, those results suggest that nonlinear analysis of rheoencephalography might be a useful approach to assess the correlation of cerebral impedance with clinical changes."
https://openalex.org/W2904396489,"The biocontrol of the honey bee ectoparasite Varroa destructor is an underexploited but promising avenue that would benefit from being integrated in a Varroa management program. Our study aimed to investigate the potential of the predatory mite Stratiolaelaps scimitus to control Varroa infestations in honey bees. Tests on safety and predation were carried out to: (1) assess the risk of predation of the honey bee brood by S. scimitus under laboratory conditions and within the colony, and (2) evaluate the predation potential of S. scimitus on phoretic Varroa mites. Under laboratory conditions, S. scimitus was able to feed upon free Varroa mites, but also attacked every unprotected honey bee brood stages with a strong preference for bee eggs. When introduced inside colonies, however, S. scimitus does not have negative effects on the survival of the bee brood. Moreover, observations made in the laboratory revealed that S. scimitus does not attack Varroa mites when they are attached to the body of bees. However, all Varroa mites that had naturally fallen from the bees were predated upon by S. scimitus and died in less than 24h. This study provides evidence that S. scimitus does not represent a significant threat to the bee brood, but also suggests that its effect in Varroa control will probably be limited as it does not attack phoretic Varroa mites. Our results represent a first step in assessing the potential of S. scimitus to control V. destructor and provide novel information about the predator's behavior inside the honey bee colony."

The aim of this study was to analyse gender differences in workplace violence against physicians of obstetrics and gynecology in China.Printed questionnaires were sent to participants of a national congress of obstetricians and gynecologists. The questionnaire consisted of items relevant to epidemiologic characteristics, workplace violence experienced in the past 12 months, participants' attitudes toward violence and physician-patient relationship. Data from female and male physicians were compared in univariate and multivariate analyses.We sent out 1,425 questionnaires, and 1,300 (91.2%) physicians responded. Among 1,247 participants with specified gender, female and male physicians consisted of 162 (13.0%) and 1,085 (87.0%), respectively. Over the past 12 months, about two-thirds of these physicians suffered verbal abuse in the workplace, gender difference aside. After adjustment for education status, working hospital and subspecialty, male physicians had suffered more physical assaults than female colleagues (18.8% vs. 10.5%, adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.3, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-3.7), most attacks without apparent physical injuries (adjusted OR 2.3, 95% CI, 1.4-3.7). Male physicians also suffered more sexual assaults than female colleagues (5.0% vs. 1.3%, adjusted OR 4.8, 95% CI, 1.8-13.3), nearly all of verbal harassment. There were only two sexual attacks on female physicians, and no rapes occurred. Although almost all physicians regarded the current circumstance as ""unhealthy and stressful"", more than half of them would take various active initiatives to create and maintain healthy and friendly physician-patient relationships.Male physicians of obstetrics and gynecology in China suffered the same number of verbal abuse incidents but more physical and sexual assaults than their female colleagues. Both genders had similar opinions about causes, consequences and management about work violence against physicians, and had the same pessimistic perspectives but innovative wishes for the physician-patient relationship."
https://openalex.org/W2905314877,"The present study evaluated the effect of supplementing in vitro culture medium with J. insularis compared to FSH on isolated secondary follicles and in vitro maturation of oocytes from those follicles. Secondary follicles were isolated from sheep ovaries and individually cultured for 18 days in α-MEM+ (Control), α-MEM+ supplemented with 100 ng/mL recombinant bovine follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) or with 0.3, 1.25, or 2.5 mg/mL of J. insularis extract (JI0.3, JI1.25, and JI2.5, respectively). Culture medium collected every 2 days was used to measure ROS levels. At the end of the culture period, cumulus oocytes complex (COCs) were collected and matured in vitro. Follicular walls were used for mRNA quantitation. JI0.3 led to a higher (P < 0.05) percentages of intact follicles than other groups after 18 days of culture. While follicular diameter remained unchanged from Day 6 onwards with JI0.3 and FSH, percentages of antral cavity formation were higher (P < 0.05) with JI0.3 at Day 6 than in all other treatments. No differences were observed between controls and treatment groups regarding ROS levels and mRNA expression of genes. Viability of resulting oocytes was higher (P < 0.05) in JI0.3 compared to FSH. Interestingly, in control experiment, supplementation of maturation medium with JI0.3 led to higher (P < 0.05) percentages of metaphase II compared to controls. Although more validations will be needed, it seems that this natural extract could be used as a cheap and easily available alternative to commercial FSH."
https://openalex.org/W2952487260,"Glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) shuttle from the cytoplasm (cy) to the nucleus (nu) when bound with glucocorticoids (i.e. GR internalization) and alter transcriptional activity. GR activation within the fear circuit has been implicated in fear memory and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, no study to date has characterized GR internalization within the fear circuit during fear memory formation or examined how traumatic stress impacts this process. To address this, we assayed cy and nu GR levels at baseline and after auditory fear conditioning (FC) in the single prolonged stress (SPS) model of PTSD. Cy and nu GRs within the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), dorsal hippocampus (dHipp), ventral hippocampus (vHipp), and amygdala (AMY) were assayed using western blot. The distribution of GR in the cy and nu (at baseline and after FC) was varied across individual nodes of the fear circuit. At baseline, SPS enhanced cyGRs in the dHipp, but decreased cyGRs in the AMY. FC only enhanced GR internalization in the AMY and this effect was attenuated by SPS exposure. SPS also decreased cyGRs in the dHipp after FC. The results of this study suggests that GR internalization is varied across the fear circuit, which in turn suggests GR activation is selectively regulated within individual nodes of the fear circuit. The findings also suggest that changes in GR dynamics in the dHipp and AMY modulate the enhancing effect SPS has on fear memory persistence."
https://openalex.org/W2903627202,"Due to prolonged coevolution with the human being, Mycobacterium tuberculosis has acquired a sophisticated capacity to evade host immunity and persist in a latent state in the infected individual. As part of this evolutive process, mycobacteria have developed a highly complex cell wall that acts as a protective barrier. Herein we studied the effects of Di-O-acyl trehalose, a cell-wall glycolipid of virulent mycobacteria on murine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells. We have demonstrated that Di-O-Acyl-trehalose promotes a tolerogenic phenotype in bone marrow-derived murine DCs activated with mycobacterial antigens and Toll-like receptor agonists. This phenotype included low expression of antigen presentation and costimulatory molecules and altered cytokine production with downregulation of IL-12 and upregulation of IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine. Additional markers of tolerogenicity were the expression of Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase and CD25. Furthermore, Di-O-Acyl-Trehalose promoted the expansion of FoxP3+ regulatory T lymphocytes. A better understanding of mycobacterial cell-wall components involved in the evasion of immunity is a prerequisite to designing better strategies to fight tuberculosis."

Epidemiological information was collected using a specific questionnaire. Overall IgM seroprevalence was 0.6% and overall IgG seroprevalence was 7.7%. The presence of anti-HEV IgG was associated with increasing age (p = 0.01), eating chicken offal (p = 0.01) and cooked rabbit (p = 0.02). Conversely, eating fafaru—traditional Polynesian condiment—was associated with a lower rate of anti-HEV IgG (p<0.01).). All donors who surfed or practiced va’a (traditional outrigger canoë) were HEV seronegative. The Polynesian lifestyle and the particular food consumption patterns—especially the very well cooked pork—may be the key to understand the low HEV seroprevalence in French Polynesia."

The phenotypic spectrum of this patient group is exceptionally broad, with symptom onset ranging from early infancy to late adulthood. In addition, the response to enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) varies between patients. The insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) has been suggested to be a modifier of disease onset and/or response to ERT. Here, we have investigated the effect of the ACE I/D polymorphism in a relatively large cohort of 131 children and adults with Pompe disease, of whom 112 were followed during treatment with ERT for 5 years. We assessed the use of wheelchair and mechanical ventilation, muscle strength assessed via manual muscle testing and hand-held dynamometry (HHD), distance walked on the six-minute walk test (6MWT), forced vital capacity (FVC) in sitting and supine position and daily-life activities assessed by R-PAct. Cross sectional analysis at first visit showed no differences between the genotypes with respect to age at first symptoms, diagnosis, wheelchair use, or ventilator use. Also response to ERT over 5 years assessed by linear mixed model analyses showed no significant differences between ACE groups for any of the outcome measures. The patient cohort contained 24 families with 54 siblings. Differences in ACE genotype could neither explain inter nor intra familial differences. We conclude that the ACE I/D polymorphism does not explain the large variation in disease severity and response to ERT observed among Pompe patients with the same c.-32-13T>G GAA variant."

The aim of this study was to identify characteristics of employment associated with dropping out of work and assess whether these were different for workers with versus without disabilities.Using a longitudinal panel study of working Australians (2001 to 2015), the current study estimated Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazard regression models to identify predictors of leaving employment, including psychosocial job quality, employment arrangement, and occupational skill level. Effect modification by disability status of the relationship between employment-related factors and exit from the labour market were assessed by including interaction terms and assessing model fit with a likelihood ratio test. Models were adjusted for a range of socio-demographic and health related factors.Compared to those without disability, those with disability had a greater risk of leaving employment (HR 1.26, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.35, p<0.001). Other predictors of exit from work included low-skilled occupation (HR 1.18, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.29, p = 0.001), being in a job with low psychosocial job quality (HR 1.11, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.19, p = 0.007), and casual, labour hire or fixed-term contract employment (HR 1.58, 95% CI 1.48 to 1.69, p<0.001).

Current methods of measuring milk production and milk transfer from the breast to the infant are inaccessible to the mothers. There is a need for an inexpensive, portable device to enable mothers to measure milk transfer to either confirm their milk production is adequate or identify breastfeeding issues early. The aim of this study was to examine changes in bioimpedance spectroscopy associated with milk removal from the human lactating breast using an electric breast pump. Thirty lactating women participated in 2 research sessions performed in random order over 2 weeks. Milk flow rate and volume were measured during pumping. All mothers completed 24-hour milk profiles. Breasts were monitored using bioimpedance spectroscopy. Analysis was performed using linear mixed effects models to investigate the relationship between both proportional change in membrane capacitance (Cm) and R0/R∞ with milk removal. There was an inverse relationship between R0/R∞ and milk removed (p<0.001). A positive relationship was also observed between Cm and both volume of milk removed (P<0.001) and percentage of available milk removed (p<0.001). This study has shown that changes in bioimpedance are related to the volume of milk removed from the breast during pumping. This modality may hold promise for the measurement of the effectiveness of the breastfeeding infant in removing milk from the breast."
https://openalex.org/W2949398349,"Histone deacetylases (HDACs) catalyze the hydrolysis of Ɛ-acetyl-lysine residues of histones. Removal of acetyl groups results in condensation of chromatin structure and repression of gene expression. Human class I, II, and IV HDACs are said to be zinc-dependent in that they require divalent zinc ions to catalyze the deacetylase reaction. HDACs are considered potential targets for the treatment of cancer due to their role in regulating transcription. They are also thought to play important roles in the development of organisms such as honey bees. The fatty acid, 10-hydroxy-2E-decenoic acid (10-HDA), which can account for up to 5% of royal jelly composition has been reported as an HDAC inhibitor. The crystal structure of the HDAC3:SMRT complex possesses two monovalent cations (MVCs) labeled as potassium with one MVC binding site near the active site Zn(II) and the second MVC binding site ≥20 Å from the active site Zn(II). We report here the inhibitory effects of excess Zn(II) on the catalytic activity of histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) bound to the deacetylase activating domain of nuclear receptor corepressor 2 (NCOR2). We also report the effects of varying concentrations of potassium ions where [K+] up to 10 mM increase HDAC3 activity with a maximum kcat/KM of approximately 80,000 M-1s-1 while [K+] above 10 mM inhibit HDAC3 activity. The inhibition constant (Ki) of 10-HDA was determined to be 5.32 mM. The regulatory effects of zinc, potassium, and 10-HDA concentration on HDAC3 activity suggest a strong correlation between these chemical species and epigenetic control over Apis mellifera caste differentiation among other control mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2904571021,"Catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF) is an established second line therapy for patients with symptomatic paroxysmal AF (PAF) and may be considered as a first line therapy in selected patients who are highly symptomatic, considering patient choice, benefit, and risk, according to recent guidelines. Our study investigated whether a first line vs. second line ablation approach may result in improved sinus rhythm maintenance after ablation.A total of 153 patients undergoing pulmonary vein isolation for PAF were included in the study (age 55±12 years, 29% female). Seventy-nine patients underwent first line AF ablation and 74 patients underwent second line AF ablation after failed antiarrhythmic drug therapy. There was no significant difference in baseline characteristics such as age, history of AF, left atrial size or LVEF between groups. Success was defined as atrial tachyarrhythmia free survival during a 12-month follow-up by means of serial ECG Holter monitoring.There was no significant difference in cumulative arrhythmia-free survival between those patients who received AF ablation as a first or second line therapy. Single procedure success was 78% in the first line group vs. 81% in the second line group; multiple procedure success was 90 vs. 91%, (n.s.). Complication rate was 1.3% vs. 1.4% (n.s.).Success of AF ablation did not differ between patients who receive ablation as first vs. second line therapy. Based on these data, a trial of AAD therapy before AF ablation may be justified in most patients with symptomatic PAF eligible for rhythm control."
https://openalex.org/W2905124200,"In the last decade there has been an increase in the use of medical devices in the home environment. These devices are commonly the same as those used in hospitals by healthcare professionals. The use of these these devices by lay users outside of a clinical environment may become unsafe. This study presents a methodology that allows decision makers to identify potential risk situations that may arise when lay users operate healthcare medical devices at home. Through a usability study based on the Grounded Theory methodology, we create a conceptual model in which we identified problems and errors related to the use of a multi-parameter monitor in a home environment by a group of lay users. The conceptual model is reified as a graphical representation, which allows stakeholders to identify (i) the weaknesses of the device, (ii) unsafe operation modes, and (iii) the most suitable device for a specific user."
https://openalex.org/W2905509126,"Recently, the Act on Guarantee of Right to Health and Access to Medical Service for Persons with Disabilities was implemented to legally define the health care system for persons with disabilities (PWDs) and the guarantee of access to medical care in Korea. This study aimed to develop specific goals and performance indicators to establish a system to guarantee right to health and access to medical service for PWDs. The first procedure was the establishment of the performance indicators, and the second was the content validity verification of the established performance indicators. To establish the performance indicators, we used the policy indicators of the government to improve the health of the Korean people. The indicators that needed to be newly developed were established based on literature review and expert consultation. Three Delphi surveys were conducted to verify the content validity of the established performance indicators. The content validity index (CVI) was obtained for the importance and possibility of the performance indicators. The indicators using the existing policy indicators are ""proportion of public health centers"" and ""rate of health checkup of PWDs,"" and newly developed indicators are ""establishment of facilities for PWDs in health care facilities (buildings and personnel)"" and ""diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder in early childhood (average age and awareness)."" The final performance indicators consist of a total of six areas, 22 sub-areas, and 40 individual indicators. The final performance indicators in this study can be used as basic data for continuously identifying the health status of PWDs in Korea and establishing the national policy for their health promotion. This study is also expected to serve as a framework to guarantee the right to health and access to medical service for PWDs rather than simply containing declarative content."
https://openalex.org/W2895075267,"The Quantum Trajectories Method (QTM) is one of {the} frequently used methods for studying open quantum systems. { The main idea of this method is {the} evolution of wave functions which {describe the system (as functions of time). Then,} so-called quantum jumps are applied at {a} randomly selected point in time. {The} obtained system state is called as a trajectory. After averaging many single trajectories{,} we obtain the approximation of the behavior of {a} quantum system.} {This fact also allows} us to use parallel computation methods. In the article{,} we discuss the QTM package which is supported by the MPI technology. Using MPI allowed {utilizing} the parallel computing for calculating the trajectories and averaging them -- as the effect of these actions{,} the time {taken by} calculations is shorter. In spite of using the C++ programming language, the presented solution is easy to utilize and does not need any advanced programming techniques. At the same time{,} it offers a higher performance than other packages realizing the QTM. It is especially important in the case of harder computational tasks{,} and the use of MPI allows {improving the} performance of particular problems which can be solved in the field of open quantum systems."
https://openalex.org/W2904113816,"Imaging was conducted using an electron tracking-Compton camera (ETCC), which measures γ-rays with energies in the range of 200-900 keV from 95mTc. 95mTc was produced by the 95Mo(p, n)95mTc reaction on a 95Mo-enriched target. A method for recycling 95Mo-enriched molybdenum trioxide was employed, and the recycled yield of 95Mo was 70%-90%. Images were obtained with the gate of three energies. The results showed that the spatial resolution increases with increasing γ-ray energy, and suggested that the ETCC with high-energy γ-ray emitters such as 95mTc is useful for the medical imaging of deep tissue and organs in the human body."
https://openalex.org/W2904199162,"Escherichia coli that express curli are more common in subsurface soil drainage when manure is surface applied. However, it is unknown whether this arises from mutations in individual strains leading to curli expression or by selection for individuals already expressing higher levels of curli. To test this, we examined curli production in pathogenic E. coli O157:H7 EDL933 as a function of manure management. Five treatments were investigated: (1) soil only, (2) soil with surface-applied E. coli O157:H7 EDL933 Δstx1-2 (EcO157), (3) soil with incorporated EcO157, (4) soil with surface-applied EcO157-inoculated manure, and (5) soil with incorporated EcO157-inoculated manure. EcO157 was reisolated from soils immediately after application and weekly thereafter for 8 weeks. EcO157 in the surface-applied treatments died faster than their incorporated treatment counterparts. Phenotypic assays revealed differences between treatments as well. Half of surface-applied manure reisolates from week 6 developed a mixed red and white colony morphology on Congo Red plates, indicating changes in curli production that were not seen in other treatments or times. In 37°C growth tests, week 6 reisolates from all treatments except soil surface-applied EcO157 left the lag phase at a significantly greater rate than week 0 isolates. We applied whole genome sequencing technology to interrogate the genetic underpinnings of these phenotypes. Surprisingly, we only found single-nucleotide polymorphisms in two of the 94 resequenced isolates from the different treatments, neither of which correlated with curli phenotype. Likewise, we found no differences in other genomic characteristics that might account for phenotypic differences including the count of gaps and the origin of discarded reads that failed to map to the parental strain. These results suggest there were no systematic genomic differences (i.e. individual-level selection) that correlated with time or treatment. We recommend future research focus on population-level selection of E. coli strains in the manure-amended soil environment."
https://openalex.org/W2904642723,"To compare the surgical outcomes between pre- and full-term patients with exotropia and to examine the factors associated with surgical outcomes.This retrospective study included 48 pre- and 432 full-term patients with basic-type exotropia who underwent unilateral or bilateral lateral rectus muscle (ULR or BLR) recession. Preoperative characteristics and surgical outcomes were compared between the pre- and full-term infants. Additionally, factors affecting the surgical outcomes were evaluated in all patients.The preoperative characteristics were significantly different between the pre- and full-term groups in terms of neurodevelopmental disabilities (p = 0.020). There were no significant differences between the pre- and full-term groups in terms of the success, overcorrection, and recurrence rates after the mean follow-up period of 34.6 ± 13.9 months (p = 0.697). The major cause of surgical failure was recurrence in both groups. Pre-term birth was not a risk factor for overcorrection and recurrence. However, regardless of the pre- or full-term birth status, the presence of neurodevelopmental disabilities significantly affected final overcorrection (p = 0.004).Pre-term patients with exotropia showed similar surgical outcomes to full-term controls. The presence of neurodevelopmental disabilities was a risk factor for final overcorrection."
