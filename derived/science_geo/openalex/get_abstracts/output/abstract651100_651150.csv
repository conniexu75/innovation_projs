https://openalex.org/W3016360824,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful tool for defining cellular diversity in tumors, but its application toward dissecting mechanisms underlying immune-modulating therapies is scarce. We performed scRNA-seq analyses on immune and stromal populations from colorectal cancer patients, identifying specific macrophage and conventional dendritic cell (cDC) subsets as key mediators of cellular cross-talk in the tumor microenvironment. Defining comparable myeloid populations in mouse tumors enabled characterization of their response to myeloid-targeted immunotherapy. Treatment with anti-CSF1R preferentially depleted macrophages with an inflammatory signature but spared macrophage populations that in mouse and human expresses pro-angiogenic/tumorigenic genes. Treatment with a CD40 agonist antibody preferentially activated a cDC population and increased Bhlhe40+ Th1-like cells and CD8+ memory T cells. Our comprehensive analysis of key myeloid subsets in human and mouse identifies critical cellular interactions regulating tumor immunity and defines mechanisms underlying myeloid-targeted immunotherapies currently undergoing clinical testing."
https://openalex.org/W3016592635,"The mechanisms underlying ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granule assembly, including the basis for establishing and maintaining RNP granules with distinct composition, are unknown. One prominent type of RNP granule is the stress granule (SG), a dynamic and reversible cytoplasmic assembly formed in eukaryotic cells in response to stress. Here, we show that SGs assemble through liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) arising from interactions distributed unevenly across a core protein-RNA interaction network. The central node of this network is G3BP1, which functions as a molecular switch that triggers RNA-dependent LLPS in response to a rise in intracellular free RNA concentrations. Moreover, we show that interplay between three distinct intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) in G3BP1 regulates its intrinsic propensity for LLPS, and this is fine-tuned by phosphorylation within the IDRs. Further regulation of SG assembly arises through positive or negative cooperativity by extrinsic G3BP1-binding factors that strengthen or weaken, respectively, the core SG network."
https://openalex.org/W3016762840,"<h2>Summary</h2> Stressed cells shut down translation, release mRNA molecules from polysomes, and form stress granules (SGs) via a network of interactions that involve G3BP. Here we focus on the mechanistic underpinnings of SG assembly. We show that, under non-stress conditions, G3BP adopts a compact auto-inhibited state stabilized by electrostatic intramolecular interactions between the intrinsically disordered acidic tracts and the positively charged arginine-rich region. Upon release from polysomes, unfolded mRNAs outcompete G3BP auto-inhibitory interactions, engendering a conformational transition that facilitates clustering of G3BP through protein-RNA interactions. Subsequent physical crosslinking of G3BP clusters drives RNA molecules into networked RNA/protein condensates. We show that G3BP condensates impede RNA entanglement and recruit additional client proteins that promote SG maturation or induce a liquid-to-solid transition that may underlie disease. We propose that condensation coupled to conformational rearrangements and heterotypic multivalent interactions may be a general principle underlying RNP granule assembly."
https://openalex.org/W3017159371,"Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) mediates formation of membraneless condensates such as those associated with RNA processing, but the rules that dictate their assembly, substructure, and coexistence with other liquid-like compartments remain elusive. Here, we address the biophysical mechanism of this multiphase organization using quantitative reconstitution of cytoplasmic stress granules (SGs) with attached P-bodies in human cells. Protein-interaction networks can be viewed as interconnected complexes (nodes) of RNA-binding domains (RBDs), whose integrated RNA-binding capacity determines whether LLPS occurs upon RNA influx. Surprisingly, both RBD-RNA specificity and disordered segments of key proteins are non-essential, but modulate multiphase condensation. Instead, stoichiometry-dependent competition between protein networks for connecting nodes determines SG and P-body composition and miscibility, while competitive binding of unconnected proteins disengages networks and prevents LLPS. Inspired by patchy colloid theory, we propose a general framework by which competing networks give rise to compositionally specific and tunable condensates, while relative linkage between nodes underlies multiphase organization."
https://openalex.org/W3016907416,"Summary Tissue homeostasis requires maintenance of functional integrity under stress. A central source of stress is mechanical force that acts on cells, their nuclei, and chromatin, but how the genome is protected against mechanical stress is unclear. We show that mechanical stretch deforms the nucleus, which cells initially counteract via a calcium-dependent nuclear softening driven by loss of H3K9me3-marked heterochromatin. The resulting changes in chromatin rheology and architecture are required to insulate genetic material from mechanical force. Failure to mount this nuclear mechanoresponse results in DNA damage. Persistent, high-amplitude stretch induces supracellular alignment of tissue to redistribute mechanical energy before it reaches the nucleus. This tissue-scale mechanoadaptation functions through a separate pathway mediated by cell-cell contacts and allows cells/tissues to switch off nuclear mechanotransduction to restore initial chromatin state. Our work identifies an unconventional role of chromatin in altering its own mechanical state to maintain genome integrity in response to deformation."

In turn, cancers and cancer therapies can alter nervous system form and function. This Commentary seeks to describe the burgeoning field of “cancer neuroscience” and encourage multidisciplinary collaboration for the study of cancer-nervous system interactions. Mounting evidence indicates that the nervous system plays a central role in cancer pathogenesis. In turn, cancers and cancer therapies can alter nervous system form and function. This Commentary seeks to describe the burgeoning field of “cancer neuroscience” and encourage multidisciplinary collaboration for the study of cancer-nervous system interactions. A growing appreciation that nervous system activity regulates development, homeostasis, plasticity, and regeneration in diverse tissues has prompted investigations of similar roles for dictating cancer formation and progression. Numerous examples have now come to light that reveal mechanistic parallels in the way the nervous system regulates normal and neoplastic cellular function across a range of tissue types. As such, nervous system-cancer crosstalk—both systemically and within the local tumor microenvironment—is now emerging as a crucial regulator of cancer initiation and progression. However, much remains to be learned. The finding that neurons constitute an important non-neoplastic cell type in a broad range of cancers galvanized a recent Banbury meeting on the Nervous System and Cancer (December 10–13, 2019), engaging members of the neuroscience and cancer biology communities. We have written this Commentary in an effort to elucidate emerging principles, identify pressing unanswered questions, and define the scope of this burgeoning new field of “cancer neuroscience.” The nervous system branches as extensively as the circulatory system, and this dense innervation of nearly all tissues—from bone marrow (Katayama et al., 2006Katayama Y. Battista M. Kao W.M. Hidalgo A. Peired A.J. Thomas S.A. Frenette P.S. Signals from the sympathetic nervous system regulate hematopoietic stem cell egress from bone marrow.Cell. 2006; 124: 407-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar) to salivary glands (Knox et al., 2010Knox S.M. Lombaert I.M. Reed X. Vitale-Cross L. Gutkind J.S. Hoffman M.P. Parasympathetic innervation maintains epithelial progenitor cells during salivary organogenesis.Science. 2010; 329: 1645-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar)—is essential to regulate normal tissue function. Analogous to its role in organogenesis, tissue homeostasis, plasticity, and regeneration, the nervous system can also control malignant tumor initiation, growth, and metastasis. While the molecular mechanisms by which neural cells influence cancer cells vary by tissue type, one unifying principle is that the functional effect of the neural-cancer interaction can typically be predicted by the influence of nervous system elements on the normal cellular counterpart of a given cancer. This principle is illustrated by the parallel influences of neuronal activity on normal and neoplastic glial cell proliferation. In the central nervous system (CNS), where glutamatergic neuronal activity promotes glial precursor cell proliferation (Gibson et al., 2014Gibson E.M. Purger D. Mount C.W. Goldstein A.K. Lin G.L. Wood L.S. Inema I. Miller S.E. Bieri G. Zuchero J.B. et al.Neuronal activity promotes oligodendrogenesis and adaptive myelination in the mammalian brain.Science. 2014; 344: 1252304Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar), the activity of glutamatergic neurons similarly drives the growth of malignant gliomas in experimental model systems (Venkatesh et al., 2015Venkatesh H.S.

Ni L. et al.Electrical and synaptic integration of glioma into neural circuits.Nature. 2019; 573: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). The underlying mechanisms involve both paracrine signaling and direct electrochemical communication (Figures 1A and 1B ). Neuronal-activity-dependent secretion of growth factors from neurons and from activity-sensing glial cells promotes glioma progression (Venkatesh et al., 2015Venkatesh H.S. Johung T.B. Caretti V. Noll A. Tang Y. Nagaraja S. Gibson E.M. Mount C.W. Polepalli J.

In addition, malignant cells can electrically integrate into neural circuitry through bona fide neuron-to-glioma synapses (Venkataramani et al., 2019Venkataramani V. Tanev D.I. Strahle C. Studier-Fischer A. Fankhauser L. Kessler T. Körber C. Kardorff M. Ratliff M.

Ni L. et al.Electrical and synaptic integration of glioma into neural circuits.Nature. 2019; 573: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Malignant glioma cells are themselves coupled by gap junctions, such that neuronal activity-dependent currents propagate through an extensively interconnected neural-glioma network (Venkataramani et al., 2019Venkataramani V. Tanev D.I. Strahle C. Studier-Fischer A. Fankhauser L. Kessler T. Körber C. Kardorff M. Ratliff M. Xie R. et al.Glutamatergic synaptic input to glioma cells drives brain tumour progression.Nature. 2019; 573: 532-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, Venkatesh et al., 2019Venkatesh H.S.

Ni L. et al.Electrical and synaptic integration of glioma into neural circuits.Nature. 2019; 573: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Post-synaptic electrical signaling promotes cancer progression through glioma cell membrane potential depolarization (Venkatesh et al., 2019Venkatesh H.S. Morishita W. Geraghty A.C. Silverbush D. Gillespie S.M. Arzt M. Tam L.T. Espenel C. Ponnuswami A. Ni L. et al.Electrical and synaptic integration of glioma into neural circuits.Nature. 2019; 573: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar) and consequent voltage-sensitive mechanisms that remain to be elucidated. The cancer-promoting effect of excitatory neurotransmission extends to brain metastases as well. Breast cancer cells that have metastasized to the brain upregulate neurotransmitter receptor expression and extend perisynaptic processes to receive neuronal-activity-dependent neurotransmitter signals that trigger a receptor-mediated signaling cascade, induce inward currents in the malignant cells, and drive growth of breast cancer brain metastases (Zeng et al., 2019Zeng Q. Michael I.P. Zhang P. Saghafinia S. Knott G. Jiao W. McCabe B.D. Galván J.A. Robinson H.P.C. Zlobec I. et al.Synaptic proximity enables NMDAR signalling to promote brain metastasis.Nature. 2019; 573: 526-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). How other types of metastatic cancer may interact with CNS neurons remains to be determined. Outside of the CNS, peripheral-nerve-derived neurotransmitter and growth factor signaling similarly regulate the progression of diverse cancers, including pancreatic, gastric, colon, prostate, breast, oral, and skin cancers in experimental model systems (Figure 1B) (Magnon et al., 2013Magnon C.

Signaling between sympathetic, parasympathetic, or sensory nerves in the tumor microenvironment and malignant cells may regulate cancer initiation, progression, or metastasis, often through neurotransmitter-dependent signaling cascades. The function of a given nerve type must be understood in a context-specific manner. For example, parasympathetic (i.e., cholinergic) nerves may exert opposite effects in different tumor tissue types, such as promoting growth in the cancer of one organ and inhibiting growth in the cancer of another. In this regard, cholinergic signaling inhibits the growth and progression of pancreatic adenocarcinoma (Renz et al., 2018Renz B.W. Tanaka T. Sunagawa M. Takahashi R. Jiang Z. Macchini M. Dantes Z. Valenti G. White R.A. Middelhoff M.A. et al.Cholinergic Signaling via Muscarinic Receptors Directly and Indirectly Suppresses Pancreatic Tumorigenesis and Cancer Stemness.Cancer Discov. 2018; 8: 1458-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) but strongly promotes adenocarcinoma of the stomach (Hayakawa et al., 2017Hayakawa Y. Sakitani K. Konishi M. Asfaha S. Niikura R. Tomita H. Renz B.W. Tailor Y. Macchini M. Middelhoff M. et al.Nerve Growth Factor Promotes Gastric Tumorigenesis through Aberrant Cholinergic Signaling.Cancer Cell. 2017; 31: 21-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), an organ in which parasympathetic innervation is dominant. It is not yet known whether peripheral nerve-cancer cell interactions exclusively reflect paracrine-signaling events or whether nerve-to-cancer cell synapses, synapse-like structures, or electrical coupling exist outside of the CNS that enable peripheral nerve to cancer communication. Moreover, the roles of diverse peripheral glial cells in nerve-cancer interactions outside of the CNS are largely unexplored. Nervous system-cancer crosstalk occurs both through direct nerve-cancer interactions and via nervous system regulation of other cell types within the tumor microenvironment (e.g., immune cells, endothelial cells). These neural-cancer interactions may occur between neurons or nerves in the local microenvironment (Figure 1B) or through systemic signaling (Figure 1C), such as through elevated circulating catecholamines (neurotransmitters). Neural regulation of angiogenesis via endothelial cell metabolism (Zahalka et al., 2017Zahalka A.H. Arnal-Estapé A. Maryanovich M. Nakahara F. Cruz C.D. Finley L.W.S. Frenette P.S. Adrenergic nerves activate an angio-metabolic switch in prostate cancer.Science. 2017; 358: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) or immune system function (Borovikova et al., 2000Borovikova L.V. Ivanova S. Zhang M. Yang H. Botchkina G.I. Watkins L.R. Wang H. Abumrad N. Eaton J.W. Tracey K.J. Vagus nerve stimulation attenuates the systemic inflammatory response to endotoxin.Nature. 2000; 405: 458-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (2941) Google Scholar) represent distinct mechanisms through which the nervous system may exert a systemic effect on the tumor environment, and interdisciplinary efforts involving oncology, immunology, and neuroscience are needed to fully dissect these important neural-immune-cancer interactions. Nervous system-cancer crosstalk is bidirectional, and cancers may induce profound nervous system remodeling and dysfunction. Secreted signals from brain tumors (gliomas) influence the function of invaded neural circuits by inducing aberrant synaptogenesis, increasing neuronal excitability, and causing seizures (Yu et al., 2020Yu K. Lin C.J. Hatcher A. Lozzi B. Kong K. Huang-Hobbs E. Cheng Y.T. Beechar V.B. Zhu W. Zhang Y. et al.PIK3CA variants selectively initiate brain hyperactivity during gliomagenesis.Nature. 2020; 578: 166-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This pathological increase in neuronal activity promotes the activity-dependent signals that drive glioma growth (Venkatesh et al., 2015Venkatesh H.S. Johung T.B. Caretti V. Noll A. Tang Y. Nagaraja S. Gibson E.M. Mount C.W. Polepalli J. Mitra S.S. et al.Neuronal Activity Promotes Glioma Growth through Neuroligin-3 Secretion.Cell. 2015; 161: 803-816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, Venkatesh et al., 2019Venkatesh H.S.

Xie R. et al.Glutamatergic synaptic input to glioma cells drives brain tumour progression.Nature. 2019; 573: 532-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Similarly, cancers outside of the CNS can act at a distance to disrupt normal brain function (e.g., sleep) (Figure 1C) (Borniger et al., 2018Borniger J.C. Walker Ii W.H. Surbhi Emmer K.M. Zhang N. Zalenski A.A. Muscarella S.L. Fitzgerald J.A. Smith A.N. Braam C.J. et al.A Role for Hypocretin/Orexin in Metabolic and Sleep Abnormalities in a Mouse Model of Non-metastatic Breast Cancer.Cell Metab. 2018; 28: 118-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In the peripheral nervous system (PNS), cancers induce axonal ingrowth (axonogenesis) into the tumor microenvironment (Figure 1B) (Hayakawa et al., 2017Hayakawa Y. Sakitani K. Konishi M. Asfaha S. Niikura R. Tomita H. Renz B.W. Tailor Y. Macchini M. Middelhoff M. et al.Nerve Growth Factor Promotes Gastric Tumorigenesis through Aberrant Cholinergic Signaling.Cancer Cell. 2017; 31: 21-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), where nerve density strongly correlates with cancer aggressiveness in many tumor types. Axonogenesis has been shown in several tumor types to be promoted by cancer cell secretion of neurotrophins (such as nerve growth factor), often through a feed-forward mechanism triggered by increased adrenergic or cholinergic signaling (Hayakawa et al., 2017Hayakawa Y. Sakitani K. Konishi M. Asfaha S. Niikura R. Tomita H. Renz B.W. Tailor Y. Macchini M. Middelhoff M. et al.Nerve Growth Factor Promotes Gastric Tumorigenesis through Aberrant Cholinergic Signaling.Cancer Cell. 2017; 31: 21-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Beyond axonogenesis, recent studies have described neurogenesis within the tumor microenvironment from neural precursor cells detected only in the circulation of subjects with cancer (Mauffrey et al., 2019Mauffrey P. Tchitchek N. Barroca V. Bemelmans A.P. Firlej V. Allory Y. Roméo P.H. Magnon C. Progenitors from the central nervous system drive neurogenesis in cancer.Nature. 2019; 569: 672-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Cancers also exhibit a propensity to invade nerve fibers (“perineural invasion”), causing remodeling of these peripheral nerves and chronic pain syndromes. In both central and peripheral cancers, this structural and functional remodeling of the nervous system amplifies neuron-cancer interactions and contributes to cancer growth and to cancer-related symptoms. Elucidating the mechanisms by which cancer therapy alters nervous system function (Figure 1D) is central to understanding the bidirectional interactions between neural and malignant cells. Traditional cancer therapies, such as radiation and chemotherapies, exert long-lasting deleterious effects on nervous system function, evident as cancer-therapy-related cognitive impairment (colloquially known as “chemobrain” or “chemofog,” a syndrome characterized by impaired attention, memory, multi-tasking, and sometimes increased anxiety) and as peripheral neuropathies (sensory loss, motor weakness, or pain). Similar long-term nervous system effects of newer targeted therapies and cancer immunotherapies are incompletely understood and only now beginning to come to light. Cancer therapies differentially affect cognition, as well as the types of nerves predominantly affected in chemotherapy-associated peripheral neuropathy. The underlying cellular and molecular etiologies of cancer-therapy-induced neural toxicity are becoming better understood, and therapeutic strategies aimed at neuroprotection or neural regeneration are now beginning to emerge (Gibson et al., 2019Gibson E.M. Nagaraja S. Ocampo A. Tam L.T. Wood L.S. Pallegar P.N. Greene J.J. Geraghty A.C. Goldstein A.K. Ni L. et al.Methotrexate Chemotherapy Induces Persistent Tri-glial Dysregulation that Underlies Chemotherapy-Related Cognitive Impairment.Cell. 2019; 176: 43-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, Pease-Raissi et al., 2017Pease-Raissi S.E. Pazyra-Murphy M.F. Li Y. Wachter F. Fukuda Y. Fenstermacher S.J. Barclay L.A. Bird G.H. Walensky L.D. Segal R.A. Paclitaxel Reduces Axonal Bclw to Initiate IP3R1-Dependent Axon Degeneration.Neuron. 2017; 96: 373-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, to what extent chemotherapy-induced neuropathy modulates nerve-cancer interactions to limit malignant growth is not yet clear, and the potentially beneficial role that therapy-induced neurotoxicity may play in the anti-neoplastic efficacy of radiation and chemotherapy remains to be explored. A more complete elucidation of both the mechanisms and implications of cancer-therapy-induced neurotoxicity are needed in order to develop optimized therapeutic strategies aimed at both effectively treating cancer and minimizing the debilitating neurological side effects. Much remains to be discovered with respect to the fundamental biology of the PNS and its role in normal tissue development, homeostasis, plasticity, and regeneration. The resulting knowledge from developmental and regenerative biology will be synergistic to understanding these interactions in cancer. Analogous to circuit-mapping efforts of the CNS over the past decade, similar mapping of the cranial, peripheral, and enteric nervous systems is warranted, as their complex anatomy remains poorly characterized. Moreover, single-cell analyses, coupled with the development of new tools for lineage analysis and pluripotent stem cell modeling, will be required to define and associate the myriad nerve types with specific cancer phenotypes. We are only beginning to uncover how the nervous system contributes to the initiation, growth, spread, recurrence, and therapeutic resistance of cancers. The powerful tools of modern neuroscience, from electrophysiology to optogenetics, should be leveraged toward an understanding of cancer pathophysiology. Tissue- and tumor-type-specific differences underscore the need for careful investigation of each type of cancer over the course of its progression to elucidate the ways in which malignancy and cancer-induced nervous system remodeling co-evolve. A more complete understanding will require true interdisciplinary study and collaboration between the disciplines of neuroscience, developmental biology, immunology, and cancer biology. Attention should be given not only to direct neuron-cancer cell interactions, but also to the influence of the nervous system on other cells of the local stromal, immune, and systemic tumor environment. At this intersection of fields, exciting opportunities exist for cancer biologists to complement the great strides made in cancer genomics, immuno-oncology, and precision therapeutics with a new dimension in the armamentarium and for neuroscientists to take full advantage of sophisticated modern neuroscience approaches for the benefit of millions of individuals suffering from cancer and the effects of its current therapies. While much remains to be learned about neural regulation of tumor growth, early-phase clinical trials are already underway, targeting neural mechanisms that modulate tumor growth in specific tumor types. Precise targeting of neural-cancer interactions will ultimately provide new opportunities for improving outcomes of many difficult-to-treat malignancies.

Although COVID-19 has now been declared a pandemic and risk for infection in the United States (US) is currently high, at the time of survey administration the risk of infection in the US was low. It is important to understand the public perception of risk and trust in sources of information to better inform public health messaging. In this study, we surveyed the adult US population to understand their risk perceptions about the COVID-19 outbreak. We used an online platform to survey 718 adults in the US in early February 2020 using a questionnaire that we developed. Our sample was fairly similar to the general adult US population in terms of age, gender, race, ethnicity and education. We found that 69% of the respondents wanted the scientific/public health leadership (either the CDC Director or NIH Director) to lead the US response to COVID-19 outbreak as compared to 14% who wanted the political leadership (either the president or Congress) to lead the response. Risk perception was low (median score of 5 out of 10) with the respondents trusting health professionals and health officials for information on COVID-19. The majority of respondents were in favor of strict infection prevention policies to control the outbreak. Given our results, the public health/scientific leadership should be at the forefront of the COVID-19 response to promote trust."

Adipocytes store and break down triglycerides to rapidly release fatty acids (FAs) to support metabolism of surrounding cells and tissues. Adipocyte lipolysis, or triglyceride hydrolyzation, starts with the activation of rate-limiting adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), which releases a non-esterified free fatty acid (FFA) and forms diacylglycerol (Eichmann et al., 2012Eichmann T.O.

Subsequent lipases catalyze the hydrolysis of the remaining FAs. Injection of adipocyte-derived lipids can be immunostimulatory in the omentum (Tynan et al., 2014Tynan G.A. Hearnden C.H. Oleszycka E.

Skin is an excellent model for exploring the mechanisms by which adipocytes control tissue repair. A large population of adipocytes resides in dermal white adipose tissue (DWAT) underneath the fibroblast-rich portion of the dermis (Driskell et al., 2014Driskell R.R. Jahoda C.A.B. Chuong C.-M.

Spiegelman B.M. Adipocytes as regulators of energy balance and glucose homeostasis.Nature. 2006; 444: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar). Interestingly, expression of the dominant negative A-ZIP/F protein under the Fabp4 promoter (Reitman and Gavrilova, 2000Reitman M.L. Gavrilova O.

Disord. 2000; 24: S11-S14Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) or use of PPARg inhibitors can reduce adipogenesis in mice and alter fibroblast repopulation in skin wounds (Schmidt and Horsley, 2013Schmidt B.A. Horsley V. Intradermal adipocytes mediate fibroblast recruitment during skin wound healing.Development. 2013; 140: 1517-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Because adipogenic progenitors can form myofibroblasts during skin repair (Shook et al., 2018Shook B.A. Wasko R.R. Rivera-Gonzalez G.C. Salazar-Gatzimas E. López-Giráldez F. Dash B.C. Muñoz-Rojas A.R. Aultman K.D. Zwick R.K. Lei V. et al.). Myofibroblast proliferation and heterogeneity are supported by macrophages during skin repair..Science. 2018; 362: eaar2971Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), it remains unclear whether the wound healing phenotype in A-ZIP/F mice results from defective immature adipogenic precursor cells, mature adipocytes, or other phenotypes like diabetes that develop in these mice (Reitman and Gavrilova, 2000Reitman M.L. Gavrilova O. A-ZIP/F-1 mice lacking white fat: a model for understanding lipoatrophic diabetes.Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab.

Intradermal adipocytes mediate fibroblast recruitment during skin wound healing.Development. 2013; 140: 1517-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Here, we identify a key role for mature adipocytes in tissue repair in the skin. Using genetic strategies to selectively ablate skin resident adipocytes, we find that dermal adipocytes are necessary for robust macrophage inflammation after injury and efficient repair of epithelial and dermal cells. Surprisingly, we find that before macrophage infiltration, mature adipocytes undergo lipolysis, releasing FAs into skin wounds. Abrogation of dermal adipocyte lipolysis via genetic deletion of Atgl in mice results in decreased FA content in wound beds, reduced numbers of inflammatory macrophages, and delayed repair. In addition, genetic lineage tracing of mature adipocytes in mouse wounds, paired with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and transcriptional profiling, revealed that after lipolysis, adipocyte-derived cells generate myofibroblasts after injury. Our data reveal that adipocyte lipolysis plays a key role during tissue repair, allowing mature adipocytes to affect skin inflammation and generate extracellular matrix (ECM)-producing stromal cells. To examine the role of dermal adipocytes in skin repair while avoiding systemic metabolic and diabetic phenotypes associated with systemic loss of adipocytes (Moitra et al., 1998Moitra J. Mason M.M. Olive M. Krylov D. Gavrilova O. Marcus-Samuels B. Feigenbaum L. Lee E. Aoyama T. Eckhaus M. et al.Life without white fat: a transgenic mouse.Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3168-3181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Rochford, 2014Rochford J.J. Mouse Models of Lipodystrophy and Their Significance in Understanding Fat Regulation. Elsevier, 2014Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar), we intradermally injected a low dose of diphtheria toxin (DT) into mice expressing an inducible diphtheria toxin receptor (iDTR) in adipocytes (AdipoqCre;mT/mG;iDTR mice) (Zwick et al., 2018Zwick R.K. Rudolph M.C. Shook B.A. Holtrup B. Roth E. Lei V. Van Keymeulen A. Seewaldt V. Kwei S. Wysolmerski J. et al.Adipocyte hypertrophy and lipid dynamics underlie mammary gland remodeling after lactation.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9: 3592Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Dermal adipocytes were efficiently ablated 4 days after DT administration, whereas total animal weight and other adipocyte depots, like gonadal white adipose tissue (GWAT), remained unchanged (Figure 1A). In addition, the numbers of immune cells, including dendritic cells, Langerhans cells, T cells, and macrophages, were similar between AdipoqCre+;iDTR and AdipoqCre−;iDTR mice in uninjured skin (Figures S1A–S1D). To examine whether wound repair was defective in skin lacking mature adipocytes, we examined the inflammatory phase of repair in AdipoqCre−;iDTR and AdipoqCre+;iDTR mice treated with DT before injury and C57BL/6 mice that were not treated with DT. Ablating dermal adipocytes before injury resulted in a 65% reduction in macrophages in 1.5-day wound beds (Figures 1B and 1C; Figure S1A). Furthermore, depletion of adipocytes did not alter the numbers or activation of other immune cells in 1.5-day wound beds (Figures S1A–S1F). Specifically, wounds of mice lacking dermal adipocytes had fewer inflammatory Ly6CHi macrophages that are recruited during inflammation (Ramachandran et al., 2012Ramachandran P. Pellicoro A. Vernon M.A. Boulter L. Aucott R.L. Ali A. Hartland S.N. Snowdon V.K. Cappon A.

Macrophages that did migrate into wound beds of adipocyte-depleted skin expressed similar levels of cytokine mRNAs as macrophages within adipocyte-containing skin (Figure S1G). Reduced numbers of wound bed macrophages persisted in wounds of adipocyte-depleted skin 3 days after injury (Figure 1D), when the local cytokine milieu transitions from inflammatory to anti-inflammatory and promotes repair (Crane et al., 2014Crane M.J.

We next examined skin repair by analyzing the proliferative phase of healing in DT-treated AdipoqCre−;iDTR, AdipoqCre+;iDTR, and wild-type mice compared with untreated wild-type mice. Although ablating macrophages throughout wound healing has been shown to impair all reparative processes (Clausen et al., 1999Clausen B.E. Burkhardt C. Reith W. Renkawitz R. Förster I.

Delayed revascularization and re-epithelialization in wounds from adipocyte-ablated skin were corrected 7 days after injury (Figures S2H–S2J), similar to when macrophages are ablated during the inflammation phase of wound healing (Lucas et al., 2010Lucas Waisman T.,A. Ranjan R. Roes J.T. Krieg, Müller W. Roers A. Eming S.A. Differential Roles of Macrophages in Diverse Phases of Skin Repair.J. Immunol. 2010; 184: 3964-3977Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). These data suggest that dermal adipocytes are required for efficient activation of inflammatory responses that affect the efficiency of early stages of skin repair. Our adipocyte ablation data suggested that adipocytes affect repair within days after injury. Because adipocyte size and numbers increase rapidly in response to bacterial infection (Zhang et al., 2015Zhang L.-J. Guerrero-Juarez C.F. Hata T. Bapat S.P. Ramos R. Plikus M.V. Gallo R.L. Innate immunity. Dermal adipocytes protect against invasive Staphylococcus aureus skin infection.Science. 2015; 347: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), we examined the size of adipocyte lipid droplets and cell numbers at the periphery of wounds using perilipin 1 (PLIN1) staining. We observed an initial increase in the average adipocyte area 16 h after injury, followed by a dramatic decrease in adipocyte size, whereas the number of PLIN1+ cells within 850 μm from the wound edge did not change (Figure 2A). This decrease in adipocyte size temporally corresponded with infiltration of macrophages (Figure 2B; Leibovich and Ross, 1975Leibovich S.J. Ross R. The role of the macrophage in wound repair. A study with hydrocortisone and antimacrophage serum.Am. J. Pathol. 1975; 78: 71-100PubMed Google Scholar, Rodero et al., 2013Rodero M.P. Hodgson S.S. Hollier B. Combadiere C. Khosrotehrani K.

CD301b+ Macrophages Are Essential for Effective Skin Wound Healing.J. Invest. Dermatol. 2016; 136: 1885-1891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The reduction in adipocyte size at the wound edge suggested that adipocytes may be altering their lipid content through β-oxidation or lipolysis. To examine whether lipolysis of dermal adipocytes occurs after injury, we genetically targeted the first and rate-limiting enzyme in lipolysis, ATGL, to be deleted from adipocytes by crossing AdipoqCreER;mT/mG mice with Atglfl/fl mice. We optimized this system to preferentially target dermal adipocytes with a topical dose of tamoxifen, which resulted in Cre activity (defined by GFP+ cells) in ∼60% of dermal PLIN1+ cells, whereas only ∼20% of subcutaneous white adipose tissue (SWAT) and GWAT adipocytes were labeled (Figures S3A–S3E), without changing the SWAT or GWAT mass (Figure S3F). Because breakdown of the unilocular lipid droplet can result in the detection of multiple smaller droplets (Himms-Hagen et al., 2000Himms-Hagen J. Melnyk A. Zingaretti M.C. Ceresi E. Barbatelli G.

Wysolmerski J. et al.Adipocyte hypertrophy and lipid dynamics underlie mammary gland remodeling after lactation.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9: 3592Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Although wound edge adipocytes contained small lipid droplets, in addition to a larger lipid droplet, in AdipoqCreER−;Atglfl/fl mice, unilocular lipid droplets were retained in wound edge adipocytes in AdipoqCreER+;Atglfl/fl mice, similar to adipocytes in non-wounded skin (Figure 2C). Importantly, quantitative lipid mass spectrometry of non-esterified FAs revealed that genetic inhibition of dermal adipocyte lipolysis reduced saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) by 50% at the wound edge 24 h after injury (Figures 2D and 2E). No difference was observed in the quantity of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Altogether, these data support that skin injury stimulates dermal adipocyte lipolysis to promote SFA and MUFA release into the site of injury. To characterize dermal adipocyte FAs, we performed quantitative lipid mass spectrometry on purified adipocytes from DWAT and SWAT depots (Zwick et al., 2018Zwick R.K. Rudolph M.C. Shook B.A. Holtrup B. Roth E. Lei V. Van Keymeulen A. Seewaldt V. Kwei S. Wysolmerski J. et al.Adipocyte hypertrophy and lipid dynamics underlie mammary gland remodeling after lactation.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9: 3592Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Various long-chain PUFA, including pro-inflammatory immune-modulating arachidonic acid (20:4 n-6), are enriched in DWAT adipocytes compared with SWAT adipocytes (Figure S3G). In addition, arachidonic acid was elevated during the inflammatory phase of wound healing (Figure S3H), which corresponds to the timing of dermal adipocyte lipolysis after injury. To determine whether a specific FA species was mobilized by injury-induced lipolysis, we performed quantitative lipid mass spectrometry on wounds derived from AdipoqCreER−;Atglfl/fl and AdipoqCreER+;Atglfl/fl mice. Although we did not observe differences in free FA species present in skin of non-wounded AdipoqCreER−;Atglfl/fl and AdipoqCreER+;Atglfl/fl mice (Figures S3I–S3M), several FAs, including palmitoleic acid (16:1 n-7), oleic acid (18:1 n-9), and α-linoleic acid (18:3 n-3), were reduced in wound beds of AdipoqCreER+;Atglfl/fl mice compared with control wounds (Figure 2F). Interestingly, despite the contribution of prostaglandins to skin repair (Dhall et al., 2015Dhall S. Wijesinghe D.S. Karim Z.A. Castro A. Vemana H.P. Khasawneh F.T. Chalfant C.E. Martins-Green M.

Altogether, these data suggest that FAs released by mature adipocytes proximal to the wound occurs within 24 h after skin injury. Because dermal adipocytes are required for efficient macrophage infiltration after injury (Figures 1B–1D), and because reduced adipocyte size and lipid dynamics occur concomitant with an increase in macrophages after injury (Figures 2A and 2B), we examined whether adipocyte lipolysis contributes to inflammation in skin wounds. Genetic inhibition of dermal adipocyte lipolysis in AdipoqCreER+;Atglfl/fl mice did not alter the relative number of immune cells in uninjured skin (Figures S4A and S4B). However, inhibition of dermal adipocyte lipolysis reduced total and monocyte-derived Ly6CHi wound bed macrophages by ∼50% 1.5 days after injury compared with control mice (Figures 3A and 3B ), even though this did not alter other immune cells (Figure S4B). By 3 days after injury, the reduced number of wound bed macrophages was no longer detectable (Figure 3C), suggesting that the ∼40% of adipocytes able to undergo lipolysis (Figure S3A) or non-FA-dependent signaling is sufficient to induce macrophage formation in wounds. To explore the impact of reduced dermal adipocyte lipolysis to the proliferative phase of repair, we analyzed revascularization, re-epithelialization, and fibroblast repopulation. Although fibroblast repopulation and re-epithelialization were not significantly altered (Figures S4C–S4F), a ∼50% reduction in revascularization was observed in day 5 wound beds that was corrected by 7 days after injury (Figure 3D; Figure S4F). To determine whether dermal adipocyte lipolysis contributes to revascularization after macrophages are recruited to the site of injury, we administered tamoxifen to AdipoqCreER+;Atglfl/fl mice 2 days after injury and analyzed revascularization in day 5 wounds. Revascularization was not altered when lipolysis was inhibited 2 days after injury (Figure S4G) but was similar for control mice from our adipocyte ablation and lipolysis inhibition experiments (Figures 1E and 3D). These data suggest that reduced macrophage numbers in wound beds of AdipoqCreER+;Atglfl/fl mice likely cause delayed revascularization after injury (Ferrante et al., 2013Ferrante C.J.

Given that inhibition of dermal adipocyte lipolysis did not alter proliferation of monocytes or macrophages (Figure S4H), lipolysis likely promotes monocyte/macrophage recruitment or monocyte differentiation into macrophages. Future studies will explore the mechanisms by which adipocyte-derived FAs affect inflammation in skin wounds. Recent work in Drosophila demonstrated that fat body cells, the adipocyte equivalent in flies, actively migrate to epidermal wounds and contribute to repair (Franz et al., 2018Franz"

We developed a widely adaptable technology to barcode and track targeted integrations of large non-viral DNA templates and applied it to perform pooled knockin screens in primary human T cells. Pooled knockin of dozens of unique barcoded templates into the T cell receptor (TCR)-locus revealed gene constructs that enhanced fitness in vitro and in vivo. We further developed pooled knockin sequencing (PoKI-seq), combining single-cell transcriptome analysis and pooled knockin screening to measure cell abundance and cell state ex vivo and in vivo. This platform nominated a novel transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) R2-41BB chimeric receptor that improved solid tumor clearance. Pooled knockin screening enables parallelized re-writing of endogenous genetic sequences to accelerate discovery of knockin programs for cell therapies."
https://openalex.org/W3017236879,"Depression is a common disorder that affects women at twice the rate of men. Here, we report that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), a recently discovered class of regulatory transcripts, represent about one-third of the differentially expressed genes in the brains of depressed humans and display complex region- and sex-specific patterns of regulation. We identified the primate-specific, neuronal-enriched gene LINC00473 as downregulated in prefrontal cortex (PFC) of depressed females but not males. Using viral-mediated gene transfer to express LINC00473 in adult mouse PFC neurons, we mirrored the human sex-specific phenotype by inducing stress resilience solely in female mice. This sex-specific phenotype was accompanied by changes in synaptic function and gene expression selectively in female mice and, along with studies of human neuron-like cells in culture, implicates LINC00473 as a CREB effector. Together, our studies identify LINC00473 as a female-specific driver of stress resilience that is aberrant in female depression."
https://openalex.org/W3016886041,"Influenza polymerase uses unique mechanisms to synthesize capped and polyadenylated mRNAs from the genomic viral RNA (vRNA) template, which is packaged inside ribonucleoprotein particles (vRNPs). Here, we visualize by cryoelectron microscopy the conformational dynamics of the polymerase during the complete transcription cycle from pre-initiation to termination, focusing on the template trajectory. After exiting the active site cavity, the template 3′ extremity rebinds into a specific site on the polymerase surface. Here, it remains sequestered during all subsequent transcription steps, forcing the template to loop out as it further translocates. At termination, the strained connection between the bound template 5′ end and the active site results in polyadenylation by stuttering at uridine 17. Upon product dissociation, further conformational changes release the trapped template, allowing recycling back into the pre-initiation state. Influenza polymerase thus performs transcription while tightly binding to and protecting both template ends, allowing efficient production of multiple mRNAs from a single vRNP."
https://openalex.org/W3016562543,"Obesity is a major modifiable risk factor for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), yet how and when obesity contributes to PDAC progression is not well understood. Leveraging an autochthonous mouse model, we demonstrate a causal and reversible role for obesity in early PDAC progression, showing that obesity markedly enhances tumorigenesis, while genetic or dietary induction of weight loss intercepts cancer development. Molecular analyses of human and murine samples define microenvironmental consequences of obesity that foster tumorigenesis rather than new driver gene mutations, including significant pancreatic islet cell adaptation in obesity-associated tumors. Specifically, we identify aberrant beta cell expression of the peptide hormone cholecystokinin (Cck) in response to obesity and show that islet Cck promotes oncogenic Kras-driven pancreatic ductal tumorigenesis. Our studies argue that PDAC progression is driven by local obesity-associated changes in the tumor microenvironment and implicate endocrine-exocrine signaling beyond insulin in PDAC development."

https://openalex.org/W3016940686,"Calorie-rich diets induce hyperphagia and promote obesity, although the underlying mechanisms remain poorly defined. We find that short-term high-fat-diet (HFD) feeding of mice activates prepronociceptin (PNOC)-expressing neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARC). PNOCARC neurons represent a previously unrecognized GABAergic population of ARC neurons distinct from well-defined feeding regulatory AgRP or POMC neurons. PNOCARC neurons arborize densely in the ARC and provide inhibitory synaptic input to nearby anorexigenic POMC neurons. Optogenetic activation of PNOCARC neurons in the ARC and their projections to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis promotes feeding. Selective ablation of these cells promotes the activation of POMC neurons upon HFD exposure, reduces feeding, and protects from obesity, but it does not affect food intake or body weight under normal chow consumption. We characterize PNOCARC neurons as a novel ARC neuron population activated upon palatable food consumption to promote hyperphagia."
https://openalex.org/W3017038206,"This randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial tested the hypothesis that 20mg of melatonin before and during the first cycle of adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer (ACBC) reduced the side effects associated with cognitive impairment. We evaluated the effects of melatonin on cognition, depressive symptoms and sleep quality, and whether these effects were related to serum levels of Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and its receptor, tropomyosin kinase B (TrkB). Thirty-six women were randomly assigned to receive melatonin or placebo for 10 days. To evaluate cognitive performance, we used the Trail-Making-Test Parts A and B (A-B), Rey Auditory-Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT) and an inhibitory task type Go / No-Go. Our results revealed that melatonin improved executive function on TMT scores, enhanced episodic memory (immediate and delayed) and recognition on RAVLT, and increased verbal fluency in the orthographic COWAT. The TMT-A-B(A-B) were negatively correlated with baseline levels of TrkB and BDNF, respectively. At the end of treatment, changes in TrkB and BDNF were inversely associated with depressive symptoms and sleep quality, but not with the TMT scores. These results suggest a neuroprotective effect of melatonin to counteract the adverse effects of ACBC on cognitive function, sleep quality and depressive symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W3016331313,"During early development, extrinsic triggers prompt pluripotent cells to begin the process of differentiation. When and how human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) irreversibly commit to differentiation is a fundamental yet unanswered question. By combining single-cell imaging, genomic approaches, and mathematical modeling, we find that hESCs commit to exiting pluripotency unexpectedly early. We show that bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4), an important differentiation trigger, induces a subset of early genes to mirror the sustained, bistable dynamics of upstream signaling. Induction of one of these genes, GATA3, drives differentiation in the absence of BMP4. Conversely, GATA3 knockout delays differentiation and prevents fast commitment to differentiation. We show that positive feedback at the level of the GATA3-BMP4 axis induces fast, irreversible commitment to differentiation. We propose that early commitment may be a feature of BMP-driven fate choices and that interlinked feedback is the molecular basis for an irreversible transition from pluripotency to differentiation."

https://openalex.org/W3017279695,"Background Four percent of the world’s population suffers from depression, which is a major public health issue. Medical students are at risk, as their depressive symptoms (DS) prevalence is reported to be approximately 27% worldwide. Since few data on Italian medical students exist, this study aimed to estimate their DS prevalence and assess risk and protective factors. Methods The PRIMES was a multicentre cross-sectional study performed in 12 Italian medical schools. Questionnaires were self-reported and included 30 sociodemographic items and the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). The primary outcome was the presence of DS (BDI-II score≥14). The main analyses were chi-squared tests and multivariable logistic regressions with a p-value<0.05 considered significant. Results The number of collected questionnaires was 2,513 (117 BDI-II incomplete). Females accounted for 61.3% of the respondents, and the median age was 22 years (IQR = 4). The prevalence of DS was 29.5%. Specifically, 14.0% had mild depression, 11.1% had moderate depression, and 4.5% had severe depression. The main risk factors for DS were age, being female, bisexual/asexual orientation, living with partner/housemates, poor economic status (worsened by living far from home), less than 90 min of weekly exercise, relatives with psychiatric disorders, personal chronic disease, judging medical school choice negatively, unsatisfying friendships with classmates, competitive and hostile climate among classmates, thinking that medical school hinders specific activities and being worried about not measuring up to the profession. Protective factors included family cohesion, hobbies, intellectual curiosity as a career motivation and no worries about the future. Conclusion Italian medical students are at high risk of reporting DS, similar to the global population of medical students’. Medical schools must make efforts to implement preventive and treatment interventions by offering counselling and working on modifiable factors, such as lifestyle and learning climate."

Circadian oscillator proteins are known to regulate the expression of clock-controlled plant genes by controlling their transcription. Here, using a high-throughput RNA-Seq approach, we examined genome-wide circadian and diurnal control of the Arabidopsis transcriptome, finding that the oscillation patterns of different transcripts of multitranscript genes can exhibit substantial differences and demonstrating that the circadian clock affects posttranscriptional regulation. In parallel, we found that two major posttranscriptional mechanisms, alternative splicing (AS; especially intron retention) and alternative polyadenylation (APA), display circadian rhythmicity resulting from oscillation in the genes involved in AS and APA. Moreover, AS-related genes exhibited rhythmic AS and APA regulation, adding another layer of complexity to circadian regulation of gene expression.

https://openalex.org/W3017073686,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a tumorigenic virus that can cause various human malignancies such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and gastric cancer (GC). EBV encodes 44 mature micro (mi)RNAs, mostly exhibiting oncogenic properties and promoting cancer progression. However, we have previously found that one EBV-encoded miRNA, namely EBV-miR-BART6-3p, acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting metastasis and invasion. Here, we report that EBV-miR-BART6-3p inhibits the proliferation of EBV-associated cancers, NPC, and GC, by targeting and downregulating a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), LOC553103. Through proteomics analysis, we determined that stathmin (STMN1) is affected by EBV-miR-BART6-3p and LOC553103. Further, via RNA immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assay, we confirmed that LOC553103 directly binds and stabilizes the 3′UTR region of STMN1 mRNA. These results indicate that the EBV-miR-BART6-3p/LOC553103/STMN1 axis regulates the expression of cell cycle-associated proteins, which then inhibit EBV-associated tumor cell proliferation. These findings provide potential targets or strategies for novel EBV-related cancer treatments, as well as contributes new insights into the understanding of EBV infection-related carcinogenesis."

Current methods to sensitively and selectively detect these toxins are limited by the need for expensive equipment, or they lack accuracy due to cross-reactivity with other chemicals found in mushrooms. In this work, we report the development of a competition-based lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) for the rapid, portable, selective, and sensitive detection of amatoxins. Our assay clearly indicates the presence of 10 ng/mL of α-AMA or γ-AMA and the method including extraction and detection can be completed in approximately 10 minutes. The test can be easily read by eye and has a presumed shelf-life of at least 1 year. From testing 110 wild mushrooms, the LFIA identified 6 out of 6 species that were known to contain amatoxins. Other poisonous mushrooms known not to contain amatoxins tested negative by LFIA. This LFIA can be used to quickly identify amatoxin-containing mushrooms."

We developed a novel voluntary mouse weightlifting model, which elicits squat-like activities against adjustable load during feeding, to investigate the resistance exercise-induced contractile and metabolic adaptations. RNAseq analysis revealed that a single bout of weightlifting induced significant transcriptome responses of genes that function in posttranslational modification, metabolism, and muscle differentiation in recruited skeletal muscles, which were confirmed by increased expression of fibroblast growth factor-inducible 14 (Fn14), Down syndrome critical region 1 (Dscr1) and Nuclear receptor subfamily 4, group A, member 3 (Nr4a3) genes. Long-term (8 weeks) voluntary weightlifting training resulted in significantly increases of muscle mass, protein synthesis (puromycin incorporation in SUnSET assay) and mTOR pathway protein expression (raptor, 4e-bp-1, and p70S6K proteins) along with enhanced muscle power (specific torque and contraction speed), but not endurance capacity, mitochondrial biogenesis, and fiber type transformation. Importantly, weightlifting training profound improved whole-body glucose clearance and skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity along with enhanced autophagy (increased LC3 and LC3-II/I ratio, and decreased p62/Sqstm1). These data suggest that resistance training in mice promotes muscle adaptation and insulin sensitivity with simultaneous enhancement of autophagy and mTOR pathway."

The natural reservoir of IAV is wild aquatic birds, from where they are transmitted to a wide range of mammalian and avian hosts, including humans, pigs, and poultry (1Yoon S.-W. Webby R.J. Webster R.G. Evolution and Ecology of Influenza A Viruses. Springer, Cham, Switzerland2014: 359-375Google Scholar). Based on antigenic criteria of the two viral surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), 16 HA subtypes (H1–H16) and nine NA subtypes (N1–N9) have been identified in avian species, and two more HA subtypes (H17 and H18) and NA subtypes (N10 and N11) have been found in bats. In contrast, humans are the primary host for IBV. Currently, two antigenic lineages of IBV, Victoria and Yamagata, co-circulate with IAV of subtype H1N1 and H3N2 in the human population (2Koutsakos M. Nguyen T.H. Barclay W.S. Kedzierska K.

In addition to seasonal influenza, the recurrent transmission of avian IAV to other host species provides the basis for the emergence of new influenza viruses for which there is little or no preexisting immunity in the human population and may provoke an influenza pandemic. Four influenza pandemics occurred in the 20th and 21st century, with the 1918 influenza pandemic (H1N1, Spanish flu) being the most devastating influenza pandemic in recent history with an estimated 50 million deaths worldwide.

IAV and IBV belong to the family Orthomyxoviridae and are enveloped viruses with a negative-sense, single-stranded RNA genome that consists of eight segments. Influenza virus infection is initiated by the major surface glycoprotein HA through binding to sialic acid–containing receptors and fusion of the viral lipid envelope and the endosomal membrane following receptor-mediated endocytosis to release the viral genome into the host cell. HA is synthesized as a fusion-incompetent precursor protein, HA0, in the infected cell and requires cleavage by a host cell protease into the subunits HA1 and HA2, which remain covalently linked by a disulfide bond. Cleavage of HA is a prerequisite for conformational changes at low pH in the endosome that trigger membrane fusion activity, and it is essential for virus infectivity (reviewed in Ref. 4Steinhauer D.A. Role of hemagglutinin cleavage for the pathogenicity of influenza virus.Virology. 1999; 258 (10329563): 1-2010.1006/viro.1999.9716Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Most influenza viruses, including human IAV and IBV and low pathogenic avian IAV, possess a monobasic HA cleavage site composed of a single arginine (rarely lysine) residue. HA with a monobasic cleavage site is activated by trypsin-like proteases present in the airways of mammalian hosts and respiratory and intestinal tissues of avian species, respectively, that remained unknown for a long time (reviewed in Ref. 5Böttcher-Friebertshäuser E.

Intriguingly, TMPRSS2-deficient mice were protected from pathogenesis and lethal outcome of infection. In contrast, proteolytic activation and pathogenesis of certain H3N2 IAV strains and IBV was shown to be independent of TMPRSS2 in mice, indicating that an additional yet undetermined protease(s) supports activation of H3 and IBV HA (14Hatesuer B.

Tmprss2−/−Tmprss4−/− double-knockout mice showed reduced body weight loss and mortality upon H3N2 infection compared with WT or single-knockout mice (17Kühn N. Bergmann S. Kösterke N. Lambertz R.L.O.

Virol. 2016; 90 (26889029): 4298-430710.1128/JVI.02693-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, H3N2 virus was still proteolytically activated in the double-knockout mice, indicating that at least one more H3-cleaving protease is present in murine lung. Together, these previous findings have made clear that HA with a monobasic cleavage site can differ in its sensitivity to host cell proteases in mice in vivo. Recently, we identified TMPRSS2 as the major activating protease of H1N1pdm, H7N9, and also H3N2 IAV in primary human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) and alveolar epithelial cells type II (AECIIs) as well as in Calu-3 human airway cells (20Limburg H. Harbig A. Bestle D. Stein D.A. Moulton H.M. Jaeger J. Janga H. Hardes K. Koepke J. Schulte L. Koczulla A.R. Schmeck B. Klenk H.-D. Böttcher-Friebertshäuser E.

Proteolytic activation of IBV was found to be independent of TMPRSS2 in Calu-3 cells and primary HBECs, consistent with results previously observed in mice (19Sakai K. Ami Y. Nakajima N. Nakajima K.

Interestingly, TMPRSS2 was crucial for IBV activation in primary human AECIIs, indicating that expression of IBV-activating proteases differs along the respiratory tract and that appropriate proteases in addition to TMPRSS2 are present in human bronchial cells, but obviously not in AECIIs (20Limburg H. Harbig A. Bestle D. Stein D.A. Moulton H.M. Jaeger J. Janga H. Hardes K. Koepke J. Schulte L. Koczulla A.R. Schmeck B. Klenk H.-D. Böttcher-Friebertshäuser E.

In summary, these data showed that IBV can be activated by a broader range of host cell proteases in the airways of both mice and humans, whereas activation of H3N2 is supported by proteases in addition to TMPRSS2 only in mice. The proteases responsible for IBV activation in Calu-3 cells and HBECs remained undetermined. Furthermore, it remained unknown whether IBV is activated by orthologous or different proteases in human and murine airway cells. In this study, by comprehensive RNA-Seq, we examined the repertoire of protease-specific mRNAs present in trachea, bronchi, and lungs of mice to investigate expression and distribution of trypsin-like proteases in the murine lower airways. In addition, we compared the protease transcriptome of primary murine AECIIs and the mouse lung cell line MLE-15, which do and do not support cleavage of HA with a monobasic cleavage site, respectively, to identify H3/IBV HA-activating proteases in addition to TMPRSS2 in murine lung. Potential protease candidates were then analyzed for cleavage of IBV HA and H3 in vitro. We demonstrate that TMPRSS4 contributes to IBV activation in primary murine AECIIs and identify TMPRSS13, hepsin, and prostasin as further potential H3/IBV HA–cleaving proteases in murine lung. Moreover, our data show that hepsin and prostasin orthologues might contribute to the differences observed for TMPRSS2-independent activation of H3 in murine and human cells. First, we analyzed the protease repertoire of murine lower airways to screen for further HA-activating protease candidates and to further examine their distribution along the murine respiratory tract. This was achieved by using RNA-Seq of mRNA species present in trachea, bronchi, and lungs of naive mice (C57BL/6J background). Detected genes expressed in total were 18,086 in trachea, 17,871 in bronchi, and 17,683 in lungs, representing approximately 72.3, 71.5, and 70.7% of the murine genome (∼25,000 genes (21Guénet J.L. The mouse genome.Genome Res. 2005; 15 (16339371): 1729-174010.1101/gr.3728305Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar)), respectively (Fig. 1A). Transcripts were prefiltered to those that yielded at least one FPKM (fragments per kilobase of exon model per million reads mapped) value of ≥0.3 and a tag count ≥50 out of three replicates to exclude insufficiently covered genes from the analysis. Similar numbers of genes for proteases and homologs expressed in trachea, bronchi, and lungs with 468, 465, and 461, respectively, were detected (Fig. 1A), representing approximately 69.6, 69.2, and 68.6% of all murine protease genes (total of 672; Mammalian Degradome Database), respectively. Of these, 68 (trachea and bronchi) and 66 (lungs) expressed serine protease genes were detected (Fig. 1A), which represent 29.6 and 28.7% of all murine serine proteases (total of 230; Mammalian Degradome Database). Among the detected serine proteases, we were particularly interested in serine proteases with trypsin-like activity that have a substrate preference for an arginine residue in the P1 position. Therefore, detected serine proteases were analyzed with the UniProt (22UniProt Consortium UniProt: a worldwide hub of protein knowledge.Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 (30395287): D506-D51510.1093/nar/gky1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (3013) Google Scholar) and MEROPS (23Rawlings N.D.

The MEROPS database of proteolytic enzymes, their substrates and inhibitors in 2017 and a comparison with peptidases in the PANTHER database.Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46 (29145643): D624-D63210.1093/nar/gkx1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar) databases. Finally, 31 expressed trypsin-like serine proteases were selected in trachea and 28 in bronchi, whereas only 25 were present in lungs (Fig. 1A). Expression levels of these trypsin-like protease candidates are shown in Fig. 1B; depicted are mean values of three biological replicates (mean and individual expression values with corresponding S.D. values are included in Table S1). The expression profile of trypsin-like serine proteases differed between examined tissues. Tmprss2 expression was found to be solid and rather constant in trachea, bronchi, and lungs, respectively. A number of human TTSPs, including TMPRSS4, TMPRSS13, and matriptase as well as the KLK members KLK1, KLK5, and KLK12, have been shown to cleave IAV and recently IBV HA with a monobasic cleavage site in vitro (reviewed in Refs. 9Beaulieu A.

Therefore, we first focused on expression of these protease genes in murine lower airways. The expression profile of TTSP members Corin, Hpn/hepsin, Tmprss11a, Tmprss11g, Tmprss13, Tmprss3, Tmprss4, Tmprss5, and Tmprss6 was less strong and varied between tissues, with four TTSPs (Tmprss11a, Tmprss11g, Tmprss3, and Tmprss6) being not expressed in lung tissue. However, expression of Tmprss4 increased from trachea to lung, whereas the opposite was found for St14/matriptase. We did not detect expression of Klk5 and Klk12 in murine trachea, bronchi, and lungs. Low expression of Klk1 was detected in lungs, and even lower gene expression values were found in trachea and bronchi. Klk11 was expressed in trachea and bronchi and, to a lower extent, in lungs, whereas Klk8 was expressed at higher levels in lung tissue compared with trachea and bronchi. Expression of Klk14 was detected only in lung. Strong expression of Cfb/complement factor B (CFB), Plat/tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), and Prss8/prostasin was detected in all three tissues. Expression of Ltf/lactotransferrin was extremely high compared with all other serine proteases in trachea and bronchi, but much lower in lung. In summary, analysis of the protease transcriptome of the murine lower airways revealed 34 proteases possessing a trypsin-like activity expressed, although some of them at very low levels. Moreover, the data show that these serine proteases can vary in their distribution in respiratory tissues and that a slightly reduced number are expressed in lungs compared with trachea and bronchi of mice. Comprehensive transcriptomic profiling of the murine lower respiratory tract revealed 68 protease candidates in trachea and bronchi and 66 in lungs; of those, 31 (trachea), 28 (bronchi), and 25 (lung) remained as potential HA-cleaving protease candidates due to their trypsin-like substrate specificity. To further reduce the number of protease candidates, we wished to compare the protease repertoire of murine lung cells that do support HA cleavage with murine lung cells that do not support HA cleavage and, thus, most likely lack expression of relevant proteases. Recently, we demonstrated that primary murine AECIIs support proteolytic activation of IAV and IBV with a monobasic HA cleavage site and express H3– and IBV HA–cleaving proteases in addition to TMPRSS2 (20Limburg H. Harbig A. Bestle D. Stein D.A. Moulton H.M. Jaeger J. Janga H. Hardes K. Koepke J. Schulte L. Koczulla A.R. Schmeck B. Klenk H.-D. Böttcher-Friebertshäuser E.

In the present study, male and female strains of Collaborative Cross (CC) mice were fed a high-fat and high-sucrose (HF/HS) diet or a control diet for 12 weeks to investigate interindividual- and sex-specific variations in the development of NAFLD. The severity of liver steatosis varied between sexes and individual strains and was accompanied by an elevation of serum markers of insulin resistance, including increases in total cholesterol, low-density lipoproteins, high-density lipoproteins, phospholipids, and glucose. The development of NAFLD was associated with overexpression of the critical fatty acid uptake and de novo lipogenesis genes Pparg, Mogat1, Cd36, Acaab1, Fabp2, and Gdf15 in male and female mice. The expression of Pparg, Mogat1, and Cd36 was positively correlated with liver triglycerides in male mice, and Mogat1 and Cd36 expression were positively correlated with liver triglycerides in female mice. Our results indicate the value of CC mice in combination with HF/HS diet-induced alterations as an approach to study the susceptibility and interindividual variabilities in the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver and early nonalcoholic steatohepatitis at the population level, uncovering of susceptible and resistant cohorts, and identifying sex-specific molecular determinants of disease susceptibility."

Histopathology revealed nuclear inclusion bodies in stromal cells suggesting the additional presence of a nuclear replicating virus. Transmission electron microscopy further demonstrated the presence of herpesvirus particles in the tissues of affected hares. We confirmed the presence of herpesvirus in 13 MYXV-positive hares by PCR and sequencing analysis. Herpesvirus-DNA was also detected in seven healthy hares, suggesting its asymptomatic circulation. Phylogenetic analysis based on concatenated partial sequences of DNA polymerase gene and glycoprotein B gene enabled greater resolution than analysing the sequences individually. The hare’ virus was classified close to herpesviruses from rodents within the Rhadinovirus genus of the gammaherpesvirus subfamily. We propose to name this new virus Leporid gammaherpesvirus 5 (LeHV-5), according to the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses standards. The impact of herpesvirus infection on the reproduction and mortality of the Iberian hare is yet unknown but may aggravate the decline of wild populations caused by the recently emerged natural recombinant myxoma virus."

GPR30 associates with breast cancer (BC) outcome and may contribute to tamoxifen resistance. We investigated the expression and prognostic significance of GPR30 in metachronous contralateral breast cancer (CBC) as a model of tamoxifen resistance.Total GPR30 expression (GPR30TOT) and plasma membrane-localized GPR30 expression (GPR30PM) were analyzed by immunohistochemistry in primary (BC1; nBC1 = 559) and contralateral BC (BC2; nBC2 = 595), and in lymph node metastases (LGL; nLGL1 = 213; nLGL2 = 196). Death from BC (BCD), including BC death or death after documented distant metastasis, was used as primary end-point.GPR30PM in BC2 and LGL2 were associated with increased risk of BCD (HRBC2 = 1.7, p = 0.03; HRLGL2 = 2.0; p = 0.02). In BC1 and BC2, GPR30PM associated with estrogen receptor (ER)-negativity (pBC1<0.0001; pBC2<0.0001) and progesterone receptor (PR)-negativity (pBC1 = 0.0007; pBC2<0.0001). The highest GPR30TOT and GPR30PM were observed in triple-negative BC. GPR30PM associated with high Ki67 staining in BC1 (p<0.0001) and BC2 (p<0.0001). GPR30TOT in BC2 did not associate with tamoxifen treatment for BC1. However, BC2 that were diagnosed during tamoxifen treatment were more likely to express GPR30PM than BC2 diagnosed after treatment completion (p = 0.01). Furthermore, a trend was observed that patients with GPR30PM in an ER-positive BC2 had greater benefit from tamoxifen treatment.PM-localized GPR30 staining is associated with increased risk of BC death when expressed in BC2 and LGL2. Additionally, PM-localized GPR30 correlates with prognostic markers of worse outcome, such as high Ki67 and a triple-negative subtype. Therefore, PM-localized GPR30 may be an interesting new target for therapeutic exploitation. We found no clear evidence that total GPR30 expression is affected by tamoxifen exposure during development of metachronous CBC, or that GPR30 contributes to tamoxifen resistance."
https://openalex.org/W3016296847,"Objective To describe antibiotic prescription rates for Australian Aboriginal children aged <2 years living in three remote Northern Territory communities. Design A retrospective cohort study using electronic health records. Setting Three primary health care centres located in the Katherine East region. Participants Consent was obtained from 149 mothers to extract data from 196 child records. There were 124 children born between January 2010 and July 2014 who resided in one of the three chosen communities and had electronic health records for their first two years of life. Main outcome measures Antibiotic prescription rates, factors associated with antibiotic prescription and factors associated with appropriate antibiotic prescription. Results There were 5,675 Primary Health Care (PHC) encounters for 124 children (median 41, IQR 25.5, 64). Of the 5,675 PHC encounters, 1,542 (27%) recorded at least one infection (total 1,777) and 1,330 (23%) had at least one antibiotic prescription recorded (total 1,468). Children had a median five (IQR 2, 9) prescriptions in both their first and second year of life, with a prescription rate of 5.99/person year (95% CI 5.35, 6.63). Acute otitis media was the most common infection (683 records, 38%) and Amoxycillin was the most commonly prescribed antibiotic (797 prescriptions, 54%). Of the 1,468 recorded prescriptions, 398 (27%) had no infection recorded and 116 (8%) with an infection recorded were not aligned with local treatment guidelines. Conclusion Prescription rates for Australian Aboriginal children in these communities are significantly higher than that reported nationally for non-Aboriginal Australians. Prescriptions predominantly aligned with treatment guidelines in this setting where there is a high burden of infectious disease."

The aim of the current study was to evaluate the effects of the law enforcement on reduction in the incidence rate of road traffic fatality (IRRTF), the incidence rate of road traffic injuries (IRRTI) and the incidence rate of rural road traffic offenses (IRRRTO) in Iran. Methods Interrupted time series analysis was conducted to evaluate the impact of law enforcement and increased traffic tickets fines. Monthly data of fatality on urban, rural and local rural roads, injuries with respect to gender and traffic offenses namely speeding, illegal overtaking and tailgating were investigated separately for the period 2009–2016. Results Results showed a reduction in the incidence rate of total road traffic fatality (IRTRTF), the incidence rate of rural road traffic fatality (IRRRTF) and the incidence rate of urban road traffic fatality (IRURTF) by –21.44% (–39.3 to –3.59, 95% CI), –21.25% (–31.32 to –11.88, 95% CI) and –26.75% (–37.49 to –16, 95% CI) through the first intervention which resulted in 0.383, 0.255 and 0.222 decline in casualties per 100 000 population, respectively. Conversely, no reduction was found in the incidence rate of local rural road traffic fatality (IRLRRTF) and the IRRTI. Second intervention was found to only affect the IRURTF with –26.75% (–37.49 to –16, 95% CI) which led to 0.222 casualties per 100 000 population. In addition, a reduction effect was observed on the incidence rate of illegal overtaking (IRIO) and the incidence rate of speeding (IRS) with –42.8% (–57.39 to –28.22, 95% CI) and –10.54% (–21.05 to –0.03, 95% CI which implied a decrease of 415.85 and 1003.8 in monthly traffic offenses per 100 000 vehicles), respectively. Conclusion Time series analysis suggests a decline in IRTRTF, IRRRTF, and IRURTF caused by the first intervention. However, the second intervention found to be only effective in IRURTF, IRIO, and IRS with the implication that future initiatives should be focused on modifying the implementation of the traffic interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3016999823,"TGFβ induces the differentiation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) into tumor-promoting myofibroblasts but underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Because endocytosis of TGFβ receptor II (TβRII), in response to TGFβ stimulation, is a prerequisite for TGF signaling, we investigated the role of protein diaphanous homolog 1 (known as Diaph1 or mDia1) for the myofibroblastic activation of HSCs. Using shRNA to knockdown Diaph1 or SMIFH2 to target Diaph1 activity of HSCs, we found that the inactivation of Diaph1 blocked internalization and intracellular trafficking of TβRII and reduced SMAD3 phosphorylation induced by TGFβ1. Mechanistic studies revealed that the N-terminal portion of Diaph1 interacted with both TβRII and Rab5a directly and that Rab5a activity of HSCs was increased by Diaph1 overexpression and decreased by Diaph1 knockdown. Additionally, expression of Rab5aQ79L (active Rab5a mutant) increased whereas the expression of Rab5aS34N (inactive mutant) reduced the endosomal localization of TβRII in HSCs compared to the expression of wild-type Rab5a. Functionally, TGFβ stimulation promoted HSCs to express tumor-promoting factors, and α-smooth muscle actin, fibronection, and CTGF, markers of myofibroblastic activation of HSCs. Targeting Diaph1 or Rab5a suppressed HSC activation and limited tumor growth in a tumor implantation mouse model. Thus, Dipah1 and Rab5a represent targets for inhibiting HSC activation and the hepatic tumor microenvironment."

Knowledge of the risk and protective factors associated with PTS in this population may assist with identifying personnel who would benefit from increased or targeted support. Aims To examine factors associated with PTS among New Zealand military personnel. Methods For this cross-sectional study, currently serving and retired military personnel were invited to complete a questionnaire. The questionnaire included a measure of PTS (the Military Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist; PCL-M), where scores ≥30 indicate the experience of significant PTS symptoms and scores ≥45 indicate a presumptive clinical diagnosis of post-traumatic stress. Potential risk and protective factors associated with PTS were examined using logistic regression modelling. Results 1817 military personnel completed the questionnaire. PCL-M scores were ≥30 for 549 (30%) participants and ≥45 for 179 (10%) participants. Factors associated with higher PCL-M scores were trauma exposure, older age, male sex, and Māori ethnicity. Factors associated with lower PCL-M scores were greater length of service, psychological flexibility, and better quality sleep. Conclusions PTS was found to be prevalent among New Zealand military personnel. The experience of trauma was strongly associated with PTS. However, factors such as psychological flexibility (the ability to adapt to changes in circumstances) and good sleep were protective, suggesting that these factors could be key targets for interventions designed to reduce PTS among military personnel in New Zealand."
https://openalex.org/W3017299334,"Individuals involved in the criminal justice (CJ) system continue to be at disproportionate risk for HIV infection, and often have a greater prevalence of substance use and sexual related risk behaviors relative to their non-CJ involved peers. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a once daily antiretroviral medicine, is an evidence-based approach for reducing the risk of contracting HIV but limited data exist regarding the use of PrEP among CJ populations, especially in the U.S. South. This study was conducted at the Pulaski County Regional Detention Facility (PCRDF) in Little Rock, Arkansas (AR), the largest county jail in the state. We explored knowledge about PrEP and HIV, perceptions about PrEP feasibility in both the jail and community settings and barriers to PrEP program implementation, through in-depth qualitative interviews with 21 jail detainees. We purposively sampled individuals based on specific self-reported risk behavior, including sexual risk (both heterosexual and same-sex) and drug related risk (e.g. IDU), among all eligible individuals. We identified five primary themes from the interviews: 1) accessing healthcare during community reentry was a low priority; 2) perception of risk and interaction with people with HIV was low; 3) there are many barriers to disclosing HIV risk behaviors in jail settings; 4) knowledge of PrEP is low but willingness to use is high; and 5) multiple barriers exist to PrEP uptake post-release. Our findings are contextually unique and therefore have important implications for future implementation of PrEP access either within jail settings or linkage to PrEP post release."
https://openalex.org/W3016476381,"Loss of podocyte differentiation can cause nephrotic-range proteinuria and Focal and Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). As specific therapy is still lacking, FSGS frequently progresses to end-stage renal disease. The exact molecular mechanisms of FSGS and gene expression changes in podocytes are complex and widely unknown as marker changes have mostly been assessed on the glomerular level. To gain a better insight, we isolated podocytes of miR-193a overexpressing mice, which suffer from FSGS due to suppression of the podocyte master regulator Wt1. We characterised the podocytic gene expression changes by RNAseq and identified many novel candidate genes not linked to FSGS so far. This included strong upregulation of the receptor tyrosine kinase EphA6 and a massive dysregulation of circadian genes including the loss of the transcriptional activator Arntl. By comparison with podocyte-specific changes in other FSGS models we found a shared dysregulation of genes associated with the Wnt signaling cascade, while classical podocyte-specific genes appeared widely unaltered. An overlap with gene expression screens from human FSGS patients revealed a strong enrichment in genes associated with extra-cellular matrix (ECM) and metabolism. Our data suggest that FSGS progression might frequently depend on pathways that are often overlooked when considering podocyte homeostasis."

In Streptomyces coelicolor, it is required for the late stages of sporulation, but precisely how it functions is unknown. Here, we report results from in vitro and in vivo experiments with WhiD from Streptomyces venezuelae (SvWhiD), which differs from S. coelicolor WhiD (ScWhiD) only at the C terminus. We observed that, like ScWhiD and other Wbl proteins, SvWhiD binds a [4Fe-4S] cluster that is moderately sensitive to O2 and highly sensitive to nitric oxide (NO). However, although all previous studies have reported that Wbl proteins are monomers, we found that SvWhiD exists in a monomer-dimer equilibrium associated with its unusual C-terminal extension. Several Wbl proteins of Mycobacterium tuberculosis are known to interact with its principal sigma factor SigA. Using bacterial two-hybrid, gel filtration, and MS analyses, we demonstrate that SvWhiD interacts with domain 4 of the principal sigma factor of Streptomyces, σHrdB (σHrdB4). Using MS, we determined the dissociation constant (Kd) for the SvWhiD-σHrdB4 complex as ∼0.7 μm, consistent with a relatively tight binding interaction. We found that complex formation was cluster dependent and that a reaction with NO, which was complete at 8–10 NO molecules per cluster, resulted in dissociation into the separate proteins. The SvWhiD [4Fe-4S] cluster was significantly less sensitive to reaction with O2 and NO when SvWhiD was bound to σHrdB4, consistent with protection of the cluster in the complex.

Very recently, a high-resolution crystal structure of WhiB1 in complex with domain 4 of SigA (σA4), was reported, revealing conformational changes of WhiB1 upon complex formation, particularly involving helix 4, which swings away from helix 2 by 120° toward helix 3 of WhiB1 in the complex structure.

Thus, evidence is accumulating that Wbl proteins function together with partner proteins.

Reaction of [4Fe-4S] WhiD with NO results in nitrosylation of the cluster and dissociation of the complex. Anerobically purified His-tagged SvWhiD was straw yellow in appearance with an absorbance spectrum typical of a [4Fe-4S] cluster protein, with a maximum located around 410 nm (Fig. 1A). Cluster loading was typically in the range ∼90%. CD spectroscopy detects cluster optical transitions and is particularly sensitive to the cluster environment. The spectrum in Fig. 1B is very similar to that previously reported for S. coelicolor WhiD (2Crack J.C. den Hengst C.D. Jakimowicz P. Subramanian S. Johnson M.K. Buttner M.J. Thomson A.J.

The LC-MS spectrum of purified SvWhiD contained a major peak at 15,923 Da (predicted mass 15,924 Da) (Fig. S1), corresponding to the cluster-free (apo) protein with an N-terminal methionine cleavage. Two lower intensity peaks were also observed at 13,390 and 12,805 Da, corresponding to truncated forms of the protein, resulting from cleavage of 26 and 33 C-terminal residues, respectively, from the full-length protein. From LC-MS and SDS-PAGE (Fig. S1), the truncated forms were estimated to account for ∼10% of the total protein.

Application here gave a deconvoluted spectrum containing a small peak at 15,919 Da corresponding to the apoprotein with all four cysteines in disulfide bridges.

The spectrum also contained a peak at 13,154 Da, corresponding to the [4Fe-4S]-bound form of one of the truncated forms of SvWhiD (12,805 Da) (see Fig. S1), indicating that the 33 C-terminal residues are not important for cluster binding/stability. Purification of WhiD under aerobic conditions also resulted in weakly colored fractions, consistent with previous findings that the S. coelicolor protein cluster is moderately resistant to O2-mediated degradation. The sample lost color entirely 30 min post purification, resulting in apoprotein, as indicated by the complete disappearance of the 410-nm absorbance band (Fig. 1A). SvWhiD was found to elute from an analytical gel filtration column (Fig. 2A) as a broad peak with an elution volume indicative of a mass of ∼27 kDa, midway between the masses of monomeric and dimeric forms. A low-intensity shoulder on the low mass side of the peak was observed, representing the truncated forms of SvWhiD. SDS-PAGE showed the full-length protein was present across the full elution profile, whereas the truncated forms were observed only in the lower mass fractions, indicating that they exist only as a monomer (Fig. 2B). ApoWhiD was also found to behave as a monomer-dimer mixture, but with some further higher mass species at lower elution volumes (Fig. 2, A and B). Nondenaturing ESI-MS revealed the presence of both monomer and dimer forms of [4Fe-4S] SvWhiD (Fig. 1C and D). Together, the data indicate that the presence or absence of the cluster does not affect the association state of SvWhiD. The absence of the cluster promotes the formation of higher mass forms of WhiD, which may arise from oxidation of Cys residues, resulting in crosslinking of SvWhiD monomers. The role of the C-terminal extension in SvWhiD dimerization was explored further by generating a truncated form of WhiD which lacked 33 residues at the C terminus. Truncated SvWhiD was found to elute from an analytical gel filtration column at a volume indicative of a monomer (Fig. S2), and SDS-PAGE confirmed the presence of truncated SvWhiD across the elution profile. UV-visible absorbance and CD spectra revealed no significant differences between truncated and full-length SvWhiD (Fig. S3), indicating that the absence of the C-terminal extension does not affect the cluster environment. Nondenaturing ESI-MS revealed the presence of only monomeric truncated [4Fe-4S] WhiD (dimeric truncated [4Fe-4S] SvWhiD was not observed using parameters optimized to observe dimeric full-length SvWhiD (Fig. S3). Apo-truncated SvWhiD was not observed because of high cluster load (>90%). Thus, we conclude that the C-terminal part of SvWhiD is essential for dimerization. A general conclusion from previous characterizations of Wbl proteins is that they are monomeric proteins (2Crack J.C. den Hengst C.D. Jakimowicz P. Subramanian S. Johnson M.K. Buttner M.J.

We note that SvWhiD has a C-terminal extension of 18 residues compared with ScWhiD, and, although the proteins exhibit overall 78% sequence identity, only 1 of the last 33 residues of SvWhiD is conserved in ScWhiD (the proteins are 100% identical from residues 1–95) (Fig. S4). Therefore, the difference in the C-terminal part is likely to be functionally important. BLAST analysis revealed comparable putative WhiD sequences (sharing ≥60% identity with the SvWhiD C-terminal extension) to be present in some Streptomyces species.

Stepwise titration of [4Fe-4S] WhiD with PROLI-NONOate, to give 0–20 NO per cluster, resulted in mild precipitation, suggesting that the nitrosylation intermediates/products of SvWhiD may be less stable than those of ScWhiD (22Crack J.C.

Scattering because of precipitation distorted the spectral changes upon nitrosylation (Fig. S5), but a shoulder at 362 nm was observed that is indicative of the formation of iron-nitrosyl species. Spectral changes could be more readily visualized by plotting the difference between absorbance at 410 and 362 nm as a function of NO per cluster (Fig. 3A). This shows that the reaction was complete at ∼9 NO per cluster, demonstrating the reaction of multiple NO molecules with each cluster, consistent with data previously reported for S. coelicolor WhiD (19Crack J.C.

Deconvoluted mass spectra measured at increasing concentrations of NO (Fig. 3B) revealed increasing abundance of peaks because of apoWhiD, and one and two sulfur adducts of apoWhiD (+32 and +64 Da), along with the eventual loss of [4Fe-4S] WhiD. Absolute ion counts for these species were then used to determine percentage abundance of the [4Fe-4S] form as a function of NO per cluster (Fig. 3C). The plot is similar to that of absorbance data in Fig. 3A in that it indicates that ∼9–10 NO molecules are required for full reaction of the SvWhiD [4Fe-4S] cluster. However, the plot is nonlinear, indicating that the reaction is not fully concerted such that the reaction of one cluster with NO does not go entirely to completion before the reaction at another cluster begins.

Whole genome sequencing analysis was performed to establish their genetic relationship and drug resistance mutations profile. Ten genetically different, extensively drug resistant strains were identified circulating among seven wards. The genetic profiles showed resistance primarily against aminoglycosides and beta-lactam antibiotics. Importantly, no mutants conferring resistance to colistin were observed. The results highlight the importance of implementing robust classification schemes for advanced genetic characterization of A. baumannii clinical isolates and simultaneous detection of drug resistance markers for adequate patient's management in clinical settings."

BM3 is a natural fusion enzyme comprising two major domains: a cytochrome P450 (heme-binding) catalytic domain and a NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) domain containing FAD and FMN cofactors in distinct domains of the CPR. A crystal structure of full-length BM3 enzyme is not available in its monomeric or catalytically active dimeric state. In this study, we provide detailed insights into the protein-protein interactions that occur between domains in the BM3 enzyme and characterize molecular interactions within the BM3 dimer by using several hybrid mass spectrometry (MS) techniques, namely native ion mobility MS (IM-MS), collision-induced unfolding (CIU), and hydrogen-deuterium exchange MS (HDX-MS). These methods enable us to probe the structure, stoichiometry, and domain interactions in the ∼240 kDa BM3 dimeric complex. We obtained high-sequence coverage (88–99%) in the HDX-MS experiments for full-length BM3 and its component domains in both the ligand-free and ligand-bound states. We identified important protein interaction sites, in addition to sites corresponding to heme-CPR domain interactions at the dimeric interface. These findings bring us closer to understanding the structure and catalytic mechanism of P450 BM3."
https://openalex.org/W3016416997,"2-Oxoadipate dehydrogenase (E1a, also known as DHTKD1, dehydrogenase E1, and transketolase domain-containing protein 1) is a thiamin diphosphate-dependent enzyme and part of the 2-oxoadipate dehydrogenase complex (OADHc) in l-lysine catabolism. Genetic findings have linked mutations in the <i>DHTKD1</i> gene to several metabolic disorders. These include α-aminoadipic and α-ketoadipic aciduria (AMOXAD), a rare disorder of l-lysine, l-hydroxylysine, and l-tryptophan catabolism, associated with clinical presentations such as developmental delay, mild-to-severe intellectual disability, ataxia, epilepsy, and behavioral disorders that cannot currently be managed by available treatments. A heterozygous missense mutation, c.2185G→A (p.G729R), in <i>DHTKD1</i> has been identified in most AMOXAD cases. Here, we report that the G729R E1a variant when assembled into OADHc <i>in vitro</i> displays a 50-fold decrease in catalytic efficiency for NADH production and a significantly reduced rate of glutaryl-CoA production by dihydrolipoamide succinyl-transferase (E2o). However, the G729R E1a substitution did not affect any of the three side-reactions associated solely with G729R E1a, prompting us to determine the structure–function effects of this mutation. A multipronged systematic analysis of the reaction rates in the OADHc pathway, supplemented with results from chemical cross-linking and hydrogen–deuterium exchange MS, revealed that the c.2185G→A <i>DHTKD1</i> mutation affects E1a–E2o assembly, leading to impaired channeling of OADHc intermediates. Cross-linking between the C-terminal region of both E1a and G729R E1a with the E2o lipoyl and core domains suggested that correct positioning of the C-terminal E1a region is essential for the intermediate channeling. These findings may inform the development of interventions to counter the effects of pathogenic <i>DHTKD1</i> mutations."
https://openalex.org/W3016613016,"Growth Mixture Modeling (GMM) has gained great popularity in the last decades as a methodology for longitudinal data analysis. The usual assumption of normally distributed repeated measures has been shown as problematic in real-life data applications. Namely, performing normal GMM on data that is even slightly skewed can lead to an over selection of the number of latent classes. In order to ameliorate this unwanted result, GMM based on the skew t family of continuous distributions has been proposed. This family of distributions includes the normal, skew normal, t, and skew t. This simulation study aims to determine the efficiency of selecting the “true” number of latent groups in GMM based on the skew t family of continuous distributions, using fit indices and likelihood ratio tests. Results show that the skew t GMM was the only model considered that showed fit indices and LRT false positive rates under the 0.05 cutoff value across sample sizes and for normal, and skewed and kurtic data. Simulation results are corroborated by a real educational data application example. These findings favor the development of practical guides of the benefits and risks of using the GMM based on this family of distributions."

Previously, we determined a 1.8 Å resolution crystal structure of the EAP family member EapH1 bound to neutrophil elastase. This structure revealed that EapH1 blocks access to the enzyme's active site by forming a noncovalent complex with this host protease. To determine how EapH1 inhibits other NSPs, we studied here the effects of EapH1 on cathepsin-G. We found that EapH1 inhibits cathepsin-G with a Ki of 9.8 ± 4.7 nm. Although this Ki value is ∼466-fold weaker than the Ki for EapH1 inhibition of neutrophil elastase, the time dependence of inhibition was maintained. To define the physical basis for EapH1's inhibition of cathepsin-G, we crystallized EapH1 bound to this protease, solved the structure at 1.6 Å resolution, and refined the model to Rwork and Rfree values of 17.4% and 20.9%, respectively. This structure revealed a protease-binding mode for EapH1 with cathepsin-G that was globally similar to that seen in the previously determined EapH1–neutrophil elastase structure. The nature of the intermolecular interactions formed by EapH1 with cathepsin-G differed considerably from that with neutrophil elastase, however, with far greater contributions from the inhibitor backbone in the cathepsin-G–bound form. Together, these results reveal that EapH1's ability to form high-affinity interactions with multiple NSP targets is due to its remarkable level of local structural plasticity.

We previously reported that transfection of the nucleotide sequence encoding for the 16-residue β32_33 peptide from mitochondrial leucyl-tRNA synthetase ameliorates the cell phenotype caused by the mitochondrial tRNA mutations. In this work, we demonstrated that both the β32_33 peptide linked with the known (L)-Phe-(D)-Arg-(L)-Phe-(L)-Lys (FrFK) mitochondrial penetrating sequence and, strikingly, the β32_33 peptide per se, are able to penetrate both the plasma and mitochondrial membranes and exert the rescuing activity when exogenously administered to cells bearing the mutations m.3243A > G and m.8344A > G. These mutations are responsible for the most common and severe mt-tRNA-related diseases. In addition, we dissected the molecular determinants of constructs activity by showing that both the order of amino acids along the sequence and presence of positive charges are essential determinants of the peptide activity in cells and mt-tRNA structures stabilization in vitro. In view of future in vivo studies, this information may be required to design of β32_33 peptide-mimetic derivatives.

Lung disease is variable among CF patients and associated with the development of comorbidities and chronic infections. The rate of lung function deterioration depends not only on the type of mutations in CFTR, the disease-causing gene, but also on modifier genes. In the present study, we aimed to identify genes and pathways that (i) contribute to the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis and (ii) modulate the associated comorbidities. We profiled blood samples in CF patients and healthy controls and analyzed RNA-seq data with Weighted Gene Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA). Interestingly, lung function, body mass index, the presence of diabetes, and chronic P. aeruginosa infections correlated with four modules of co-expressed genes. Detailed inspection of networks and hub genes pointed to cell adhesion, leukocyte trafficking and production of reactive oxygen species as central mechanisms in lung function decline and cystic fibrosis-related diabetes. Of note, we showed that blood is an informative surrogate tissue to study the contribution of inflammation to lung disease and diabetes in CF patients. Finally, we provided evidence that WGCNA is useful to analyze–omic datasets in rare genetic diseases as patient cohorts are inevitably small."

Rs-fMRI sequences were performed under steady state sevoflurane inhalation anaesthesia. Anaesthetic depth was titrated to the minimum level needed for immobilisation and mechanical ventilation of the patient. This required a sevoflurane MAC between 0.8 to 1.2. Group-level ICA dimensionality of 20 components revealed distributed sensory, motor and higher-order networks in the dogs’ brain. We identified in total 7 RSNs (default mode, primary and higher order visual, auditory, two putative motor-somatosensory and one putative somatosensory), which are common to other mammals including humans. Identified RSN are remarkably similar to those identified in awake dogs. This study proves the feasibility of rs-fMRI in anesthetized dogs and describes several RSNs, which may set the basis for investigating pathophysiological characteristics of various canine brain diseases."

Meanwhile, computer simulations using various models have enabled better predictions for phenomena in cancer. However, user-based parameters that are specific to a researcher’s own experimental conditions must be inputted. In order to bridge the gap between experimental and simulated conditions, we have developed an in silico analysis method with virtual three-dimensional embodiment computed using the researcher’s own samples. The present work focused on HeLa spheroid growth in soft agar culture, with spheroids being modeled in silico based on time-lapse images capturing spheroid growth. The spheroids in silico were optimized by adjusting the growth curves to those obtained from time-lapse images of spheroids and were then assigned virtual inner proliferative activity by using generations assigned to each cellular particle. The ratio and distribution of the virtual inner proliferative activities were confirmed to be similar to the proliferation zone ratio and histochemical profiles of HeLa spheroids, which were also consistent with those identified in an earlier study. We validated that time-lapse images of HeLa spheroids provided virtual inner proliferative activity for spheroids in vitro.

https://openalex.org/W3017098213,"TMEM16A, a Ca2+-sensitive Cl- channel, plays key roles in many physiological functions related to Cl- transport across lipid membranes. Activation of this channel is mediated via binding intracellular Ca2+ to the channel with a relatively high apparent affinity, roughly in the sub-μM to low μM concentration range. Recently available high-resolution structures of TMEM16 molecules reveal that the high-affinity Ca2+ activation sites are formed by several acidic amino acids, using their negatively charged sidechain carboxylates to coordinate the bound Ca2+. In this study, we examine the interaction of TMEM16A with a divalent cation, Co2+, which by itself cannot activate current in TMEM16A. This divalent cation, however, has two effects when applied intracellularly. It inhibits the Ca2+-induced TMEM16A current by competing with Ca2+ for the aforementioned high-affinity activation sites. In addition, Co2+ also potentiates the Ca2+-induced current with a low affinity. This potentiation effect requires high concentration (mM) of Co2+, similar to our previous findings that high concentrations (mM) of intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) can induce more TMEM16A current after the Ca2+-activation sites are saturated by tens of μM [Ca2+]i. The degrees of potentiation by Co2+ and Ca2+ also roughly correlate with each other. Interestingly, mutating a pore residue of TMEM16A, Y589, alters the degree of potentiation in that the smaller the sidechain of the replaced residue, the larger the potentiation induced by divalent cations. We suggest that the Co2+ potentiation and the Ca2+ potentiation share a similar mechanism by increasing Cl- flux through the channel pore, perhaps due to an increase of positive pore potential after the binding of divalent cations to phospholipids in the pore. A smaller sidechain of a pore residue may allow the pore to accommodate more phospholipids, thus enhancing the current potentiation caused by high concentrations of divalent cations."
https://openalex.org/W3016700991,"The disease chytridiomycosis, caused by the pathogenic chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), has contributed to global amphibian declines. Bd infects the keratinized epidermal tissue in amphibians and causes hyperkeratosis and excessive skin shedding. In individuals of susceptible species, the regulatory function of the amphibian’s skin is disrupted resulting in an electrolyte depletion, osmotic imbalance, and eventually death. Safe and effective treatments for chytridiomycosis are urgently needed to control chytrid fungal infections and stabilize populations of endangered amphibian species in captivity and in the wild. Currently, the most widely used anti-Bd treatment is itraconazole. Preparations of itraconazole formulated for amphibian use has proved effective, but treatment involves short baths over seven to ten days, a process which is logistically challenging, stressful, and causes long-term health effects. Here, we explore a novel anti-fungal therapeutic using a single application of the ionic liquid, 1-Butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (BMP-NTf2), for the treatment of chytridiomycosis. BMP-NTf2 was found be effective at killing Bd in vitro at low concentrations (1:1000 dilution). We tested BMP-NTf2 in vivo on two amphibian species, one that is relatively tolerant of chytridiomycosis (Pseudacris regilla) and one that is highly susceptible (Dendrobates tinctorius). A toxicity trial revealed a surprising interaction between Bd infection status and the impact of BMP-NTf2 on D. tinctorius survival. Uninfected D. tinctorius tolerated BMP-NTf2 (mean ± SE; 96.01 ± 9.00 μl/g), such that only 1 out of 30 frogs died following treatment (at a dose of 156.95 μL/g), whereas, a lower dose (mean ± SE; 97.45 ± 3.52 μL/g) was not tolerated by Bd-infected D. tinctorius, where 15 of 23 frogs died shortly upon BMP-NTf2 application. Those that tolerated the BMP-NTf2 application did not exhibit Bd clearance. Thus, BMP-NTf2 application, under the conditions tested here, is not a suitable option for clearing Bd infection in D. tinctorius. However, different results were obtained for P. regilla. Two topical applications of BMP-NTf2 on Bd-infected P. regilla (using a lower BMP-NTf2 dose than on D. tinctorius, mean ± SE; 9.42 ± 1.43 μL/g) reduced Bd growth, although the effect was lower than that obtained by daily doses of itracanozole (50% frogs exhibited complete clearance on day 16 vs. 100% for itracanozole). Our findings suggest that BMP-NTf2 has the potential to treat Bd infection, however the effect depends on several parameters. Further optimization of dose and schedule are needed before BMP-NTf2 can be considered as a safe and effective alternative to more conventional antifungal agents, such as itraconazole."
https://openalex.org/W3017260869,"Acoustic signaling plays an important role in mother-offspring recognition and subsequent bond-formation. It remains unclear, however, if mothers and offspring use acoustic signaling in the same ways and for the same reasons throughout the juvenile stage, particularly after mutual recognition has been adequately established. Moreover, despite its critical role in mother-offspring bond formation, research explicitly linking mother-infant communication strategies to offspring survival are lacking. We examined the communicative patterns of mothers and offspring in the feral horse (Equus caballus) to better understand 1) the nature of mother-offspring communication throughout the first year of development; 2) the function(s) of mother- vs. offspring-initiated communication and; 3) the importance of mare and foal communication to offspring survival. We found that 1) mares and foals differ in when and how they initiate communication; 2) the outcomes of mare- vs. foal-initiated communication events consistently differ; and 3) the communicative patterns between mares and their foals can be important for offspring survival to one year of age. Moreover, given the importance of maternal activity to offspring behavior and subsequent survival, we submit that our data are uniquely positioned to address the long-debated question: do the behaviors exhibited during the juvenile stage (by both mothers and their young) confer delayed or immediate benefits to offspring? In summary, we aimed to better understand 1) the dynamics of mother-offspring communication, 2) whether mother-offspring communicative patterns were important to offspring survival, and 3) the implications of our research regarding the function of the mammalian juvenile stage. Our results demonstrate that we have achieved those aims."
