https://openalex.org/W4297249674,"Family visitation in intensive care units (ICU) has been impacted by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (COVID-19) pandemic. While studies report on perceptions of families completely restricted from ICUs, little is known about the burden experienced by designated family caregivers allowed to visit their critically ill loved one. This study sought the perspectives of family caregivers of critically ill patients on the impact of one-person designated visitor policies mandated in ICUs during the COVID-19 pandemic.Throughout the study period a restricted visitation policy was mandated capturing the first (April 2020) and second (December 2020) waves of the pandemic that allowed one designated family caregiver (i.e., spouses or adult children) per patient to visit the ICU. Designated family caregivers of critically ill patients admitted to ICU September 2020 to November 2020 took part in individual 60-minute, semi-structured interviews at 6-months after discharge from the index ICU admission. Themes from family interviews were summarized with representative quotations.Key themes identified following thematic analysis from six participants included: one visitor rule, patient advocate role, information needs, emotional distress, strategies for coping with challenges, practicing empathy, and appreciation of growth.Designated family caregivers of critically ill patients admitted to ICU during the COVID-19 pandemic perceived a complex and highly stressful experience. Support from ICU family liaisons and psychologists may help ameliorate the impact."
https://openalex.org/W4297253319,"Electrocardiograms (ECG) are extensively used for the diagnosis of cardiac arrhythmias. This paper investigates the use of machine learning classification algorithms for ECG analysis and arrhythmia detection. This is a crucial component of a conventional electronic health system, and it frequently necessitates ECG signal reduction for long-term data storage and remote transmission. Signal processing methods must be used to extract the function of the morphological properties of the ECG signal changing with time, which is difficult to discern in the typical visual depiction of the ECG signal. In biomedical research, signal processing and data analysis are commonly employed methodologies. This work proposes the use of an ECG arrhythmia classification method based on Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for feature extraction and an improved AlexNet classifier to distinguish the difference between four types of arrhythmia conditions that were collected from records. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm's results are compared to those of other algorithms, and the simulation results prove that the proposed technique is more effective for various parameters. The final results of the proposed system show that its ability to find deviations is 20% better than that of traditional systems."
https://openalex.org/W4297264324,"To describe clinical and imaging characteristics of patients with Peripheral Exudative Hemorrhagic Chorioretinopathy (PEHCR), prognosis and treatment response.In this retrospective cohort study medical records of patients diagnosed with PEHCR in a tertiary medical center between 2008 and 2018 were reviewed. Collected data included demographics, medical history, ophthalmologic examination and multi-modal imaging including fundus autofluorescence, optical coherence tomography (OCT), ultrasound (US), fluorescein angiography and indocyanine green angiography when available. Bevacizumab treatment results were analyzed when applied.35 eyes of 32 patients were included, with a female predominance (56.25%) and an average age of 79.0±9.87 years at presentation. Most common OCT and US findings were subretinal mass (68.75%), pigment epithelial detachment (30.00%) and atrophic changes (21.86%). Median follow-up period was 18.00 months (range 0-102). Visual acuity (VA) remained stable (39.29%) or improved (25.00%) in most cases available for follow-up. Treatment with intravitreal bevacizumab induced a statistically significant clinical resolution in 88.89% of eyes available for follow-up (8/9 eyes) (p = 0.02).PEHCR is presented with high clinical variability and generally good prognosis. This is the first publication demonstrating a statistically significant clinical resolution of disease following intravitreal bevacizumab injections."
https://openalex.org/W4297250830,"CMTM6, a type 3 transmembrane protein, is known to stabilize the expression of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and hence facilitates the immune evasion of tumor cells. Recently, we demonstrated that CMTM6 is a major driver of cisplatin resistance in oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC). However, the detailed mechanism of how CMTM6 rewires cisplatin resistance in OSCC is yet to be explored. RNA sequencing analysis of cisplatin-resistant OSCC lines stably expressing Nt shRNA and CMTM6 shRNA revealed that CMTM6 might be a potential regulator of the ribosome biogenesis network. Knocking down CMTM6 significantly inhibited transcription of 47S precursor rRNA and hindered the nucleolar structure, indicating reduced ribosome biogenesis. When CMTM6 was ectopically over-expressed in CMTM6KD cells, almost all ribosomal machinery components were rescued. Mechanistically, CMTM6 induced the expression of C-Myc, which promotes RNA polymerase I mediated rDNA transcription. In addition to this, CMTM6 was also found to regulate the AKT-mTORC1-dependent ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis in cisplatin-resistant lines. The nude mice and zebrafish xenograft experiments indicate that blocking ribosome synthesis either by genetic inhibitor (CMTM6KD) or pharmacological inhibitor (CX-5461) significantly restores cisplatin-mediated cell death in chemoresistant OSCC. Overall, our study suggests that CMTM6 is a major regulator of the ribosome biogenesis network and targeting the ribosome biogenesis network is a viable target to overcome chemoresistance in OSCC. The novel combination of CX-5461 and cisplatin deserves further clinical investigation in advanced OSCC."
https://openalex.org/W4297251571,"Background School-based health-promoting interventions are increasingly seen as an effective population strategy to improve health and prevent obesity. Evidence on the long-term effectiveness of school-based interventions is scarce. This study investigates the four-year effectiveness of the school-based Healthy Primary School of the Future (HPSF) intervention on children’s body mass index z-score (BMIz), and on the secondary outcomes waist circumference (WC), dietary and physical activity (PA) behaviours. Methods and findings This study has a quasi-experimental design with four intervention schools, i.e., two full HPSFs (focus: diet and PA), two partial HPSFs (focus: PA), and four control schools. Primary school children (aged 4–12 years) attending the eight participating schools were invited to enrol in the study between 2015 and 2019. Annual measurements consisted of children’s anthropometry (weight, height and waist circumference), dietary behaviours (child- and parent-reported questionnaires) and PA levels (accelerometers). Between 2015 and 2019, 2236 children enrolled. The average exposure to the school condition was 2·66 (SD 1·33) years, and 900 participants were exposed for the full four years (40·3%). After four years of intervention, both full (estimated intervention effect (B = -0·17 (95%CI -0·27 to -0·08) p = 0·000) and partial HPSF (B = -0·16 (95%CI-0·25 to -0·06) p = 0·001) resulted in significant changes in children’s BMIz compared to control schools. Likewise, WC changed in favour of both full and partial HPSFs. In full HPSFs, almost all dietary behaviours changed significantly in the short term. In the long term, only consumption of water and dairy remained significant compared to control schools. In both partial and full HPSFs, changes in PA behaviours were mostly absent. Interpretation This school-based health-promoting intervention is effective in bringing unfavourable changes in body composition to a halt in both the short and long term. It provides policy makers with robust evidence to sustainably implement these interventions in school-based routine."
https://openalex.org/W4297254373,"Background As new SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern emerge, there is a need to scale up testing to minimize transmission of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Many countries especially those in the developing world continue to struggle with scaling up reverse transcriptase polymerase reaction (RT-PCR) to detect SARS-CoV-2 due to scarcity of resources. Alternatives such as antigen rapid diagnostics tests (Ag-RDTs) may provide a solution to enable countries scale up testing. Methods In this study, we evaluated the Panbio ™ and STANDARD Q Ag-RDTs in the laboratory using 80 COVID-19 RT-PCR confirmed and 80 negative nasopharyngeal swabs. The STANDARD Q was further evaluated in the field on 112 symptomatic and 61 asymptomatic participants. Results For the laboratory evaluation, both tests had a sensitivity above 80% (Panbio ™ = 86% vs STANDARD Q = 88%). The specificity of the Panbio ™ was 100%, while that of the STANDARD Q was 99%. When evaluated in the field, the STANDARD Q maintained a high specificity of 99%, however the sensitivity was reduced to 56%. Conclusion Using Ag-RDTs in low resource settings will be helpful in scaling-up SARS-CoV-2 testing, however, negative results should be confirmed by RT-PCR where possible to rule out COVID-19 infection."
https://openalex.org/W4297261086,"Oxidative stress-induced damage to and dysfunction of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells are important pathogenetic factors of age-related macular degeneration (AMD); however, the underlying molecular mechanism is not fully understood. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have important roles in various biological processes. In this study, using an oxidative damage model in RPE cells, we identified a novel oxidation-related lncRNA named CYLD-AS1. We further revealed that the expression of CYLD-AS1 was increased in RPEs during oxidative stress. Depletion of CYLD-AS1 promoted cell proliferation and mitochondrial function and protected RPE cells against hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 )-induced damage. Mechanistically, CYLD-AS1 also regulated the expression of NRF2, which is related to oxidative stress, and NF-κB signaling pathway members, which are related to inflammation. Remarkably, these two signaling pathways were mediated by the CYLD-AS1 interactor miR-134-5p. Moreover, exosomes secreted by CYLD-AS1 knockdown RPE cells had a lower proinflammatory effect than those secreted by control cells. In summary, our study revealed that CYLD-AS1 affects the oxidative stress-related and inflammatory functions of RPE cells by sponging miR-134-5p to mediate NRF2/NF-κB signaling pathway activity, suggesting that targeting CYLD-AS1 could be a promising strategy for the treatment of AMD and related diseases."
https://openalex.org/W4297251245,"There has been limited research on sex trafficking in Canada from a health and health care perspective, despite U.S. research which points to health care providers as optimally positioned to identify and help those who have been sex trafficked. We aim to better understand health care providers' knowledge about, attitudes towards, and care of those who have been sex trafficked in Ontario, Canada.Using a semi-structured interview guide, we will interview physicians, nurses, and social workers working in a health care setting in Ontario until data saturation is reached. An intersectional lens will be applied to the study; analysis will follow the six analytic phases outlined by Braun and Clarke. In the development of this study, we consulted the consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research (COREQ) with regards to reflexivity and study design. We will continue to consult this checklist as the study progresses and in the writing of our analysis and findings.To our knowledge, this will be the first study of its kind in Canada. The results hold the potential to inform the development of standardized training on sex trafficking for health care providers. Results of the study may be useful in addressing sex trafficking in other jurisdictions."
https://openalex.org/W4297254061,"To expose all undergraduate science students to the benefits of participating in research, many universities are integrating course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) into their introductory biology laboratory curriculum. At large institutions, the bulk of introductory labs are instructed by graduate teaching assistants (GTAs). Graduate students, who are often teachers and researchers in training, may vary in their capacity to effectively teach undergraduates via the CURE model. To explore variation in GTA teaching and the subsequent outcomes for students, we used a case study research design at one institution where introductory biology students participate in GTA-taught CURE lab sections. We used multiple data sources, including in-class focus groups, worksheets, and surveys to explore student perceptions of the GTA-led CURE. Students perceived variation both in the ability of their GTAs to create a supportive and comfortable learning environment, and in the instructional priorities of their GTAs. We also compared student and GTA perspectives of student engagement with research elements in the CURE. While GTAs were divided in their perceptions of whether the CURE provided students with the opportunity to experience the element of relevant discovery, most students—regardless of their GTA—did not perceive that relevant discovery was emphasized in the CURE. Finally, individual GTAs seemed to influence how students perceived why they were participating in the CURE. These data imply that students in CUREs may have vastly different and potentially inequitable research experiences depending on their instructor."
https://openalex.org/W4297255512,"The outcome of ischemic stroke can be improved by further refinements of thrombolysis and reperfusion strategies. Factor VII activating protease (FSAP) is a circulating serine protease that could be important in this context. Its levels are raised in patients as well as mice after stroke and a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the coding sequence, which results in an inactive enzyme, is linked to an increased risk of stroke. In vitro, FSAP cleaves fibrinogen to promote fibrinolysis, activates protease-activated receptors, and decreases the cellular cytotoxicity of histones. Based on these facts, we hypothesized that FSAP can be used as a treatment for ischemic stroke. A combination of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), a thrombolytic drug, and recombinant serine protease domain of FSAP (FSAP-SPD) improved regional cerebral perfusion and neurological outcome and reduced infarct size in a mouse model of thromboembolic stroke. FSAP-SPD also improved stroke outcomes and diminished the negative consequences of co-treatment with tPA in the transient middle cerebral artery occlusion model of stroke without altering cerebral perfusion. The inactive MI-isoform of FSAP had no impact in either model. FSAP enhanced the lysis of blood clots in vitro, but in the tail transection model of hemostasis, FSAP-SPD treatment provoked a faster clotting time indicating that it also has pro-coagulant actions. Thus, apart from enhancing thrombolysis, FSAP has multiple effects on stroke progression and represents a promising novel therapeutic strategy in the treatment of ischemic stroke."
https://openalex.org/W4297260279,"The effects of genetic polymorphisms on muscle structure and function remain elusive. The present study tested for possible associations of 16 polymorphisms (across ten candidate genes) with fittness and skeletal muscle phenotypes in 17- to 37-year-old healthy Caucasian male endurance (n = 86), power/strength (n = 75) and team athletes (n = 60), and non-athletes (n = 218). Skeletal muscle function was measured with eight performance tests covering multiple aspects of muscular fitness. Along with body mass and height, the upper arm and limb girths, and maximal oxygen uptake were measured. Genotyping was conducted on DNA extracted from blood. Of the 16 polymorphisms studied, nine (spanning seven candidate genes and four gene families/signalling pathways) were independently associated with at least one skeletal muscle fitness measure (size or function, or both) measure and explained up to 4.1% of its variation. Five of the studied polymorphisms (activin- and adreno-receptors, as well as myosine light chain kinase 1) in a group of one to three combined with body height, age and/or group explained up to 20.4% of the variation of muscle function. ACVR1B (rs2854464) contributed 2.0–3.6% to explain up to 14.6% of limb proximal girths. The G allele (genotypes AG and GG) of the ACVR1B (rs2854464) polymorphism was significantly overrepresented among team (60.4%) and power (62.0%) athletes compared to controls (52.3%) and endurance athletes (39.2%), and G allele was also most consistently/frequently associated with muscle size and power. Overall, the investigated polymorphisms determined up to 4.1% of the variability of muscular fitness in healthy young humans."
https://openalex.org/W4297260444,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 is a global health care problem with high mortality. Despite early mortality seeming alarming, data regarding factors that lead to increased early mortality of COVID 19 patients is not well-documented yet. The objective of this study was to identify the risk factors of early mortality in patients with confirmed COVID-19 infections.A case-control study design was employed. With this, a total of 261 COVID-19 deceased recordings were reviewed. The cases of the study were recordings of patients deceased within three days of intensive care unit admission whereas, the rest 187 were recordings of patients who died after three days of admission. Data were collected using an extraction checklist, entered into Epi data version 4.4.2.2, and analyzed by SPSS version 25. After the description, binary logistic regression was run to conduct bivariate and multivariable analyses. Finally, statistical significance was declared at p-value <0.05, and an adjusted odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval was used to report the strength of association.The analysis was performed on 261 (87 cases and 174 controls) recordings. About 62.5% of the participants were aged above 65 years and two-thirds were males. The presence of cardiovascular disease (AOR = 4.79, with 95%CI: 1.73, 13.27) and bronchial-asthma (AOR = 6.57; 95% CI: 1.39, 31.13) were found to have a statistically significant association with early mortality. The existence of complications from COVID-19 (AOR = 0.22; 95% CI: 0.07, 0.74) and previous history of COVID-19 infection (AOR = 0.17, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.69) were associated with decreased risk of early mortality.Having cardiovascular diseases and bronchial asthma was associated with an increased risk of early mortality. Conversely, the presence of intensive care unit complications and previous history of COVID-19 infection were associated with decreased risk of early mortality."
https://openalex.org/W4297261081,"Adolescence and emerging adulthood represent a period of heightened vulnerability to sexual violence (SV). While some research suggests that exposure to sexually explicit material (SEM) among adolescents and college students is associated with sexually violent behavior, our understanding of this relationship is limited. This study aimed to assess the relationship between prior exposure to several types of SEM and sexually violent behavior in a sample of first-year university men in Vietnam.A cohort of 739 first-year male university students completed three survey waves over 14 months, providing information on contact and non-contact sexually violent behavior, exposure to SEM, and other theorized confounders of the SEM-SV relationship. Controlling for these covariates, we estimated the average treatment effect of SEM on contact and non-contact SV using the propensity score method. We also conducted a dose-response analysis for the effect of violent SEM on SV based on frequency-of-exposure classes derived from latent class analysis. The majority of the sample reported exposure to SEM in the prior six months, with 41% of the sample reporting exposure to violent SEM. In propensity-adjusted models, exposure to violent SEM, but not other types, had a small but significant positive effect on contact and non-contact SV. These effects increased for frequent viewers of violent SEM. Models of contact SV showed endogeneity, warranting caution.Exposure to violent SEM is prevalent among university men in Vietnam and may be contributing to sexually violent behavior. Incorporating media literacy into SV prevention programs to mitigate these potential effects may be warranted."
https://openalex.org/W4297263787,"Despite remarkable advancements in intra-arterial mechanical thrombectomy (IAT), recanalization failure rates up to 24% have been reported. Recently, permanent stent placement (rescue stent, RS) during IAT has been suggested as an optional modality for better reperfusion and outcomes in these patients. However, previous studies were limited owing to non-standardized procedure protocols and small sample sizes. Here, we aimed to determine the efficacy and safety of RS in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) with middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion.Of the 243 patients in our IAT database (2015-2021), 183 were identified as having MCA occlusion alone. Among them, we extracted 53 patients in whom the IAT failed to show thrombolysis in cerebral ischemia (TICI) scores of 2A or worse. Intraoperatively, RS was deployed in 22 patients (RS group), whereas 31 patients (no-stent group) received IAT without stenting. The baseline characteristics and radiologic and clinical outcomes were reviewed. Comparisons between the groups and multivariate logistic analyses for recanalization and good functional outcomes (modified Rankin Scale 0-2) were performed.No baseline differences were noted (RS vs. no-stent); however, the recanalization outcomes (59.1% vs. 25.8%, p = 0.15) and proportion of good modified Rankin Scale scores (45.5% vs. 19.4%, p = 0.041) were better in the RS group. The parameters of symptomatic ICH (9.7% vs. 9.4%) and mortality (6.5% vs. 5.7%) showed no significant difference. In the multivariate analyses, 'hypertension' and 'RS deployment' were identified as significantly associated factors with recanalization and good prognosis.In select patients with MCA occlusion AIS after failed IAT, the RS technique can be an optional rescue treatment modality for acquiring better functional outcomes and delayed recanalization."
https://openalex.org/W4297266310,"In this study, the caprine pancreas has been presented as an alternative to the porcine organ for pancreatic xenotransplantation with lesser risk factors. The obtained caprine pancreas underwent a systematic cycle of detergent perfusion for decellularization. It was perfused using anionic (0.5% w/v sodium dodecyl sulfate) as well as non-ionic (0.1% v/v triton X-100, t-octyl phenoxy polyethoxy ethanol) detergents and washed intermittently with 1XPBS supplemented with 0.1% v/v antibiotic and nucleases in a gravitation-driven set-up. After 48 h, a white decellularized pancreas was obtained, and its extracellular matrix (ECM) content was examined for scaffold-like properties. The ECM content was assessed for removal of cellular content, and nuclear material was evaluated with temporal H&E staining. Quantified DNA was found to be present in a negligible amount in the resultant decellularized pancreas tissue (DPT), thus prohibiting it from triggering any immunogenicity. Collagen and fibronectin were confirmed to be preserved upon trichrome and immunohistochemical staining, respectively. SEM and AFM images reveal interconnected collagen fibril networks in the DPT, confirming that collagen was unaffected. sGAG was visualized using Prussian blue staining and quantified with DMMB assay, where DPT has effectively retained this ECM component. Uniaxial tensile analysis revealed that DPT possesses better elasticity than NPT (native pancreatic tissue). Physical parameters like tensile strength, stiffness, biodegradation, and swelling index were retained in the DPT with negligible loss. The cytocompatibility analysis of DPT has shown no cytotoxic effect for up to 72 h on normal insulin-producing cells (MIN-6) and cancerous glioblastoma (LN229) cells in vitro. The scaffold was recellularized using isolated mouse islets, which have established in vitro cell proliferation for up to 9 days. The scaffold received at the end of the decellularization cycle was found to be non-toxic to the cells, retained biological and physical properties of the native ECM, suitable for recellularization, and can be used as a safer and better alternative as a transplantable organ from a xenogeneic source."
https://openalex.org/W4297249821,"The unwillingness to share contacts is one of the least explored aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Here we report the factors associated with resistance to collaborate on contact tracing, based on the results of a nation-wide survey conducted in Italy in January-March 2021.The repeated cross-sectional on-line survey was conducted among 7,513 respondents (mean age 45.7, 50.4% women) selected to represent the Italian adult population 18-70 years old. Two groups were defined based on the direct question response expressing (1) unwillingness or (2) willingness to share the names of individuals with whom respondents had contact. We selected 70% of participants (training data set) to produce several multivariable binomial generalized linear models and estimated the proportion of variation explained by the model by McFadden R2, and the model's discriminatory ability by the index of concordance. Then, we have validated the regression models using the remaining 30% of respondents (testing data set), and identified the best performing model by removing the variables based on their impact on the Akaike information criterion and then evaluating the model predictive accuracy. We also performed a sensitivity analysis using principal component analysis. Overall, 5.5% of the respondents indicated that in case of positive SARS-CoV-2 test they would not share contacts. Of note, this percentage varied from 0.8% to 46.5% depending on the answers to other survey questions. From the 139 questions included in the multivariable analysis, the initial model proposed 20 independent factors that were reduced to the 6 factors with only modest changes in the model performance. The 6-variables model demonstrated good performance in the training (c-index 0.85 and McFadden R2 criteria 0.25) and in the testing data set (93.3% accuracy, AUC 0.78, sensitivity 30.4% and specificity 97.4%). The most influential factors related to unwillingness to share contacts were the lack of intention to perform the test in case of contact with a COVID-19 positive individual (OR 5.60, 95% CI 4.14 to 7.58, in a fully adjusted multivariable analysis), disagreement that the government should be allowed to force people into self-isolation (OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.12 to 2.84), disagreement with the national vaccination schedule (OR 2.63, 95% CI 1.86 to 3.69), not following to the preventive anti-COVID measures (OR 3.23, 95% CI 1.85 to 5.59), the absence of people in the immediate social environment who have been infected with COVID-19 (1.66, 95% CI 1.24 to 2.21), as well as difficulties in finding or understanding the information about the infection or related recommendations. A limitation of this study is the under-representation of persons not participating in internet-based surveys and some vulnerable groups like homeless people, persons with disabilities or migrants.Our analysis revealed several groups that expressed unwillingness to collaborate on contact tracing. The identified patterns may play a principal role not only in the COVID-19 epidemic but also be important for possible future public health threats, and appropriate interventions for their correction should be developed and ready for the implementation."
https://openalex.org/W4297250972,"Objectives To investigate healthcare resource utilization (HRU) and associated costs by depression severity and year of diagnosis among patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) in Denmark. Methods Including all adult patients with a first-time hospital contact for major depressive disorder (MDD) in 1996–2015, TRD patients were defined at the second shift in depression treatment (antidepressant medicine or electroconvulsive therapy) and matched 1:2 with non-TRD patients. The risk of utilization and amount of HRU and associated costs including medicine expenses 12 months after the TRD-defining date were reported, comparing TRD patients with non-TRD MDD patients. Results Identifying 25,321 TRD-patients matched with 50,638 non-TRD patients, the risk of psychiatric hospitalization following TRD diagnosis was 138.4% (95%-confidence interval: 128.3–149.0) higher for TRD patients than for non-TRD MDD patients. The number of hospital bed days and emergency department (ED) visits were also higher among TRD patients, with no significant difference for somatic HRU. Among patients who incurred healthcare costs, the associated HRU costs for TRD patients were 101.9% (97.5–106.4) higher overall, and 55.2% (50.9–59.6) higher for psychiatric services than those of non-TRD patients. The relative differences in costs for TRD-patients vs non-TRD patients were greater for patients with mild depression and tended to increase over the study period (1996–2015), particularly for acute hospitalizations and ED visits. Limitations TRD was defined by prescription patterns besides ECT treatments. Conclusion TRD was associated with increased psychiatric-related HRU. Particularly the difference in acute hospitalizations and ED visits between TRD and non-TRD patients increased over the study period."
https://openalex.org/W4297252767,"Fluorescence optical imaging technique (FOI) is a well-established and valid method for visualization of changes in micro vascularization at different organ systems. As increased vascularization is an early feature of joint inflammation, FOI is a promising method to assess arthritis of the hands. But usability of the method is limited to the assessors experience as the measurement of FOI is semi-quantitative using an individual grading system such as the fluorescence optical imaging activity score (FOIAS). The goal of the study was to automatically and thus, objectively analyze the measured fluorescence intensity generated by FOI to evaluate the amount of inflammation of each of the subject's joints focusing on the distinction between normal joint status or arthritis in psoriatic arthritis patients compared to healthy volunteers. Due to the heterogeneity of the pathophysiological perfusion of the hands, a method to overcome the absoluteness of the data by extracting heatmaps out of the image stacks is developed. To calculate a heatmap for one patient, firstly the time series for each pixel is extracted, which is then represented by a feature value. Secondly, all feature values are clustered. The calculated cluster values represent the relativity between the different pixels and enable a comparison of multiple patients. As a metric to quantify the conspicuousness of a joint a score is calculated based on the extracted cluster values. These steps are repeated for a total number of three features. With this method a tendency towards a classification into unaffected and inflamed joints can be achieved. However, further research is necessary to transform the tendency into a robust classification model."

https://openalex.org/W4297255295,"Human chorionic villous mesenchymal stem cells (CV-MSCs) are a promising and effective therapeutic option for tissue injury. Vascular dysfunction during pregnancies is significantly involved in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia (PE). This work aims to investigate how CV-MSCs regulate the function of vascular endothelial cells. In this study, RNA-seq analysis was used to examine the changes in HUVECs treated with CV-MSC conditioned medium (CM). We examined the levels of ABCA9 and AKT signaling in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) by immunohistochemistry, western blotting, and qRT-PCR assays. CCK-8, colony formation, and tube formation assays were used to understand the role of ABCA9 in HUVEC proliferation and angiogenesis mediated by CV-MSCs. The CV-MSC treatment significantly enhanced the HUVEC proliferation and angiogenesis. Furthermore, a significant increase in the ABCA9 expression and AKT pathway activation was observed in CV-MSCs -treated HUVECs. Consistent with these findings, ABCA9 overexpression exhibited the same proliferation-and angiogenesis-promoting effect in HUVECs as induced by CV-MSC CM, also accompanied the AKT signaling activation. In addition, inhibition of ABCA9 inactivated the AKT signaling in HUVECs and reduced the HUVEC proliferation and angiogenesis. Importantly, the elevation of proliferation and angiogenesis induced by ABCA9 overexpression in HUVECs could be reversed by AKT pathway inhibition. Our results suggest that ABCA9-dependent AKT signaling activation mediated by CV-MSCs could promote HUVEC proliferation and angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W4297258920,"The task of event extraction consists of three subtasks namely entity recognition, trigger identification and argument role classification. Recent work tackles these subtasks jointly with the method of multi-task learning for better extraction performance. Despite being effective, existing attempts typically treat labels of event subtasks as uninformative and independent one-hot vectors, ignoring the potential loss of useful label information, thereby making it difficult for these models to incorporate interactive features on the label level. In this paper, we propose a joint label space framework to improve Chinese event extraction. Specifically, the model converts labels of all subtasks into a dense matrix, giving each Chinese character a shared label distribution via an incrementally refined attention mechanism. Then the learned label embeddings are also used as the weight of the output layer for each subtask, hence adjusted along with model training. In addition, we incorporate the word lexicon into the character representation in a soft probabilistic manner, hence alleviating the impact of word segmentation errors. Extensive experiments on Chinese and English benchmarks demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods."
https://openalex.org/W4297259301,"Swine dysentery is causally associated with Brachyspira hampsonii and B . hyodysenteriae infection. Given the importance of transmission models in understanding re-emergent diseases and developing control strategies such as vaccines, the objective of this experiment was to evaluate two experimental natural transmission (seeder pig) models in grower pigs, each with 24 animals. Seeder pigs were intragastrically inoculated using broth cultures of either B . hampsonii strain 30446 (genomovar II) or B . hyodysenteriae strain G44. In trial 1, three seeder pigs were placed into two pens containing nine susceptible contact pigs creating a 1:3 seeder:contact ratio. This was sufficient to achieve natural B . hampsonii infection of 13/18 (72%) contact pigs, however, the incidence of mucoid or mucohemorrhagic diarrhea (MMHD) in contact pigs differed significantly between pens (4/9 versus 9/9; P = 0.03). In trial 2, eight seeder pigs inoculated intragastrically with B . hampsonii did not develop MMHD but when re-inoculated with B . hyodysenteriae 14 days later, all developed mucohemorrhagic diarrhea within 13 days of re-inoculation. Two seeder pigs were placed into each of 4 contact pens each containing 4 pigs. This 1:2 seeder:contact ratio resulted in natural infection of 14/16 (87%) contact pigs with incubation period ranging from 9–15 days. There were no significant differences among pens in incubation period, duration, clinical period or severity of diarrhea. These trials demonstrated that a 1:2 seeder:contact ratio with groups of six grower pigs per pen sustained natural transmission of B . hyodysenteriae G44 with greater consistency in the incidence of MMHD among pens compared to a B . hampsonii 30446 transmission model using 1:3 seeder:contact ratio in pens of 12. Understanding why B . hampsonii intragastric inoculation failed in one experiment warrants additional research."
https://openalex.org/W4297260466,"Given recent and abrupt declines in the abundance of moose (Alces alces) throughout parts of Minnesota and elsewhere in North America, accurately estimating statewide population trends and demographic parameters is a high priority for their continued management and conservation. Statistical population reconstruction using integrated population models provides a flexible framework for combining information from multiple studies to produce robust estimates of population abundance, recruitment, and survival. We used this framework to combine aerial survey data and survival data from telemetry studies to recreate trends and demographics of moose in northeastern Minnesota, USA, from 2005 to 2020. Statistical population reconstruction confirmed the sharp decline in abundance from an estimated 7,841 (90% CI = 6,702-8,933) in 2009 to 3,386 (90% CI = 2,681-4,243) animals in 2013, but also indicated that abundance has remained relatively stable since then, except for a slight decline to 3,163 (90% CI = 2,403-3,718) in 2020. Subsequent stochastic projection of the population from 2021 to 2030 suggests that this modest decline will continue for the next 10 years. Both annual adult survival and per-capita recruitment (number of calves that survived to 1 year per adult female alive during the previous year) decreased substantially in years 2005 and 2019, from 0.902 (SE = 0.043) to 0.689 (SE = 0.061) and from 0.386 (SE = 0.030) to 0.303 (SE = 0.051), respectively. Sensitivity analysis revealed that moose abundance was more sensitive to fluctuations in adult survival than recruitment; thus, we conclude that the steep decline in 2013 was driven primarily by decreasing adult survival. Our analysis demonstrates the potential utility of using statistical population reconstruction to monitor moose population trends and to identify population declines more quickly. Future studies should focus on providing better estimates of per-capita recruitment, using pregnancy rates and calf survival, which can then be incorporated into reconstruction models to help improve estimates of population change through time."
https://openalex.org/W4297265428,"Oncogenic reprogramming of cellular metabolism is a hallmark of many cancers, but our mechanistic understanding of how such dysregulation is linked to tumor behavior remains poor. In this study, we have identified dihydroceramide desaturase (DES1)-which catalyzes the last step in de novo sphingolipid synthesis-as necessary for the acquisition of anchorage-independent survival (AIS), a key cancer enabling biology, and establish DES1 as a downstream effector of HER2-driven glucose uptake and metabolism. We further show that DES1 is sufficient to drive AIS and in vitro tumorigenicity and that increased DES1 levels-found in a third of HER2+ breast cancers-are associated with worse survival outcomes. Taken together, our findings reveal a novel pro-tumor role for DES1 as a transducer of HER2-driven glucose metabolic signals and provide evidence that targeting DES1 is an effective approach for overcoming AIS. Results further suggest that DES1 may have utility as a biomarker of aggressive and metastasis-prone HER2+ breast cancer."

Here, we investigated the effect of supplementation with curcumin-loaded nanocomplexes (CNCs) on the severity of NASH in hamsters. Methodology Hamsters were placed in experimental groups as follows: fed standard chow diet (normal control, NC); fed only high-fat and high-fructose (HFF) diet; O . viverrini -infected and fed HFF diet (HFFOV); group fed with blank nanocomplexes (HFFOV+BNCs); groups fed different doses of CNCs (25, 50 and 100 mg/kg body weight: HFFOV+CNCs25; HFFOV+CNCs50; HFFOV+CNCs100, respectively) and a group given native curcumin (HFFOV+CUR). All treatment were for three months. Results The HFF group revealed NAFLD as evidenced by hepatic fat accumulation, ballooning, mild inflammation and little or no fibrosis. These changes were more obvious in the HFFOV group, indicating development of NASH. In contrast, in the HFFOV+CNCs50 group, histopathological features indicated that hepatic fat accumulation, cell ballooning, cell inflammation and fibrosis were lower than in other treatment groups. Relevantly, the expression of lipid-uptake genes, including fatty-acid uptake (cluster of differentiation 36), was reduced, which was associated with the lowering of alanine aminotransferase, total cholesterol and triglyceride (TG) levels. Reduced expression of an inflammation marker (high-mobility group box protein 1) and a fibrosis marker (alpha smooth-muscle actin) were also observed in the HFFOV+CNCs50 group. Conclusion CNCs treatment attenuates the severity of NASH by decreasing hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis as well as TG synthesis. CNCs mitigate the severity of NASH in this preclinical study, which indicates promise for future use in patients."
https://openalex.org/W4297249107,"The study of animal and plant fibers related to grave furnishing, garments, and grave goods in thousands-of-year-old burials provides new insights into these funerary practices. Their preservation presupposes favorable conditions, where bacterial and fungal activity is at a minimum, as in anaerobic, wet, salty, arid, or frozen environments. The extreme acidic-soil environments (i.e., podzols) of Finland pose a challenge when it comes to studying funerary deposits, as human remains are rarely found. However, its potential to preserve microparticles allows us to approach the funerary event from a totally different point of view. Here, we present the first multiproxy analyses of a Mesolithic deposit from Finland. A red-ochre burial of a child found in Majoonsuo is studied by analyzing 1) microscopic fibers, 2) fatty acids, and 3) physical-chemical (CIELab color, pH, grain size) properties of 60 soil samples and associated materials. The microscopic fibers evidenced the remains of waterfowl downy feathers, a falcon feather fragment, canid and small rodent hairs as well as bast fibers. These could have been used in furnishing the grave and as ornaments or clothes. Canid hairs could belong to a dog inhumation, or more likely to canid fur used as grave good/clothes. Samples with microparticles have more long-chain and unsaturated fatty acids, although animal species identification was not possible. Soil properties indicate that the burial was made in the local soil, adding homogeneous red ochre and removing the coarser material; no bioturbation was found. The highly acidic sandy soil, together with a slight increase in finer particles when ochre is abundant, probably resulted in micro-scale, anoxic conditions that prevented bacterial attack. This study reveals the first animal hairs and feathers from a Finnish Mesolithic funerary context, and provides clues about how their preservation was possible."
https://openalex.org/W4297249112,"Background Prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection among Vietnamese Americans is reportedly high. Understanding the profile of those at greater risk of HCV in this ethnic population is a vital step to addressing this high prevalence. We hypothesize that certain sociodemographic characteristics increase the likelihood of having HCV in Vietnamese Americans. Methods Cross-sectional data from 2,497 Vietnamese Americans in Southern California who participated in a series of community hepatitis screening events organized by the Vietnamese American Cancer Foundation (VACF) were analyzed. Serological tests via immunoassays were used to determine whether the participant had hepatitis C antibodies (anti-HCV) to indicate a HCV infection. Sociodemographic characteristics as well as participants’ reasons for screening were collected from questionnaires, and logistic regression models with odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to quantify their associations with HCV infection. Results Approximately 5.8% of the study population was infected with HCV. Older adults and male participants had higher odds of being infected with HCV (e.g. OR = 2.90, 95% CI 1.25–6.76 for ages 70+ versus ages &lt;40; OR = 2.57, 95% CI 1.79–3.69 for male versus female participants) as were those with a family history of HCV infection (OR = 2.74, 95% CI 1.57–4.78). In addition, perceived self-risk as a motivation for screening was significantly associated with HCV infection (OR = 1.88, 95% CI 1.26–2.78). Conclusions This study identifies specific subgroups in the Vietnamese American community who would largely benefit from targeted interventions given their higher likelihood of having HCV. These interventions should emphasize improving HCV knowledge and promoting HCV self-risk assessment since awareness of one’s own risk may motivate those likely to be infected to get screened."
https://openalex.org/W4297250256,"Background The increasing prevalence of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) in developing countries like Bangladesh has been linked to progressive urbanisation. Comparisons of rural and urban populations often find a higher prevalence of CVD risk factors in the urban population, but rural-to-urban migrants might have different CVD risk profiles than either rural or urban residents. This study aimed to describe differences in CVD risk factors between migrants and non-migrants siblings and to determine whether acculturation factors were associated with CVD risk factors among migrants. Methods Using a sibling-pair comparative study, 164 male migrant who migrated from Pirganj rural areas to Dhaka City and their rural siblings (total N = 328) were assessed by interview, anthropometric measurement, blood pressure and blood samples. Comparisons were made using linear or logistic mixed effects models. Findings Physical inactivity, inadequate intake of fruit and vegetables and possible existence of a mental health disorder had 3.3 (1.73; 6.16), 4.3 (2.32; 7.92) and 2.9 (1.37; 6.27) times higher odds among migrants than their rural siblings, respectively. Migrants watched television on average 20 minutes (95% CI 6.17–35.08 min/day) more per day than the rural sibling group whereas PUFA intake, fruit and vegetable and fish intake of the migrants were -5.3 gm/day (-6.91; -3.70), -21.6 serving/week (-28.20; -15.09), -14.1 serving/week (-18.32; -9.87), respectively, lower than that of the rural siblings. No significant difference was observed for other variables. After adjusting, the risk of physical inactivity, inadequate fruit and vegetable intake, a mental health disorder and low HDL were significantly higher in migrants than in rural siblings and tended to be higher for each increasing tertile of urban life exposure. Conclusion The findings suggest that migration from rural-to-urban environment increases CVD risk which exacerbate with time spent in urban area due to acculturation. This study gives new insights into the increased CVD risk related with migration and urbanization in Bangladesh."

RNA devices, a class of engineered RNA-based controllers, enable tunable gene expression control of target genes in response to molecular effectors. RNA devices have been demonstrated in a number of systems showing proof-of-concept of applying ligand-responsive control over therapeutic activities, including regulation of cell fate decisions such as T cell proliferation and apoptosis. Here, we describe the application of a theophylline-responsive RNA device in a muscle progenitor cell system to control myogenic differentiation. Ribozyme-based RNA switches responsive to theophylline control fluorescent reporter expression in C2C12 myoblasts in a ligand dependent manner. HRAS and JAK1, both anti-differentiation proteins, were incorporated into RNA devices. Finally, we demonstrate that the regulation of HRAS expression via theophylline-responsive RNA devices results in the modulation of myoblast differentiation in a theophylline-dependent manner. Our work highlights the potential for RNA devices to exert drug-responsive, tunable control over cell fate decisions with applications in stem cell therapy and basic stem cell biology research."
https://openalex.org/W4297254254,"Non-condensable gases (NCGs) are all gases that do not undergo liquefaction during the saturated steam sterilization process. During a sterilization cycle, the NCGs presence inside the chamber is one of the biggest threats to the sterilization process compromising process validation and product quality.In this work, 170 testing of NCGs concentrations performed between September 2016 and August 2021 were carried out by Orionce Serviços de Metrologia Ltda (Barueri, SP, Brazil), according to EN285:2015 procedure. For steam generation, the types of water used were softened water (SW), one-step reverse osmosis (RO), purified water (PW), and water for injection (WFI). The data obtained were analyzed using Minitab® software, version 18.1, to identify a relationship between the water quality used for steam generation and the concentration of non-condensable gases determined into equipment qualification.From total tests performed, 109 tests passed, and 61 tests failed, representing 64.2% and 35.8%, respectively. A higher failure rate was observed in terms of concentration of non-condensable gases in systems that used purified water for steam generation (64.7%), followed by softened water (55.6%), one-step reverse osmosis (42.9%), and water for injection (7.6%).System processes using WFI for steam generation showed better results for steam quality approvement, in terms of NCGs concentration, compared to softened, purified, or reverse osmosis water treatments in the concentration of non-condensable gases in steam used for sterilization processes of industrial utilities."
https://openalex.org/W4297254828,"In their pristine state, river landscapes consist of complex mosaics of aquatic and terrestrial habitats. They are highly dynamic and, with their harsh environments, offer living space for many specialists. In the present study, the habitat choice of specialists of the riparian arthropod community was studied on a near-natural stretch of the Upper Isar River. Study period was between May and July 2011. Araneae, Formicidae and Staphylinidae were the most common taxa. The dominant species was Pardosa wagleri with 1,092 individuals, followed by Arctosa cinerea with 184 and Paederidus rubrothoracicus with 154 individuals. These three species made up 54% of all located individuals and were considered as representatives for the invertebrate community. Remaining species had by far smaller proportions and were not determined further due to the low individual numbers. Habitat preferences for the three dominant species were analyzed using negative binomial regression. Common and important habitat features were non-silted and coarse gravel areas, which are neighboured by patches with an elevation 1m above the water. Furthermore, the absence of vegetation cover as well the absence of ants was crucial for the occurrence of the three model species. Habitat preferences were subject to seasonal influences due to various requirements of different life stages. Other influencing factors were competition and predation due to Formicidae and larger individuals of Lycosidae. This demonstrates the high importance of structurally rich riverbeds with a mosaic of distinct habitat patches for the three representative species. Our findings are a valuable contribution for the conservation and management of braided rivers and their characteristic gravel bar biocoenosis."

Beyond the physical dimensions, the disease has an extensive emotional and psychosocial effect on patients, influencing their quality of life, social life and interpersonal relationships. Thus patient-reported outcomes are a crucial instrument for the evaluation of disease burden. Navigating life in times of the COVID-19 pandemic is challenging, especially for persons suffering from chronic diseases. We here analyzed the impact of lockdown restrictions on psoriasis patients.To compare the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) before and during the COVID-19 pandemic of patients with psoriasis.Retrospective longitudinal analysis in adult patients with moderate to severe psoriasis undergoing biologic treatment between January 2020 and January 2021. DLQI, patient demographics, Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), and recent biologic treatment were recorded.103 patients were identified, of whom 19 had additional psoriatic arthritis. Female (n = 29) and male (n = 74) patients were distributed 1 to 3. Median age of patients was 54 years (range 18-85). All patients received biologic systemic treatment: anti-IL-23 (n = 39), anti-IL-17A (n = 30), anti-IL-12/23 (n = 25), or anti-TNFα (n = 9). Comparing DLQI scores before the COVID-19 pandemic and under lockdown restriction showed improved DLQI scores over time. Further analysis displayed that patients mostly ticked ""not relevant"" on social activities during lockdown. Thus, the DLQI scores may be artificial improved and may not really reflect the actual disease burden.Psoriasis patients showed a contrary improvement of life quality despite harsh COVID-19 lockdown suggesting that DLQI should be modified when social life is restricted."
https://openalex.org/W4297255558,"Adult acquired flatfoot deformity becomes permanent with stage III posterior tibialis tendon dysfunction and results in foot pain and difficulty walking and balancing. To prevent progression to stage III posterior tibialis tendon dysfunction when conservative treatment fails, a flexor digitorum longus to posterior tibialis tendon transfer is often conducted. However, since the flexor digitorum longus only has one-third the force-capability of the posterior tibialis, an osteotomy is typically also required. We propose the use of a novel implantable mechanism to replace the direct attachment of the tendon transfer with a sliding pulley to amplify the force transferred from the donor flexor digitorum longus to the foot arch. In this work, we created four OpenSim models of an arched foot, a flatfoot, a flatfoot with traditional tendon transfer, and a flatfoot with implant-modified tendon transfer. Paired with these models, we developed a forward dynamic simulation of the stance phase of gait that reproduces the medial/lateral distribution of vertical ground reaction forces. The simulation couples the use of a fixed tibia, moving ground plane methodology with simultaneous activation of nine extrinsic lower limb muscles. The arched foot and flatfoot models produced vertical ground reaction forces with the characteristic double-peak profile of gait, and the medial/lateral distribution of these forces compared well with the literature. The flatfoot model with implant-modified tendon transfer produced a 94.2% restoration of the medial/lateral distribution of vertical ground reaction forces generated by our arched foot model, which also represents a 2.1X improvement upon our tendon transfer model. This result demonstrates the feasibility of a pulley-like implant to improve functional outcomes for surgical treatment of adult acquired flatfoot deformity with ideal biomechanics in simulation. The real-world efficacy and feasibility of such a device will require further exploration of factors such as surgical variability, soft tissue interactions and healing response."
https://openalex.org/W4297255704,"The impact of frailty surges, as the prevalence increases with age and the population age is rising. Frailty is associated with adverse health outcomes and increased healthcare costs. Many validated instruments to detect frailty have been developed. Using these in clinical practice takes time. Automated estimation of the probability of being frail using routinely collected data from hospital electronic health records (EHRs) would circumvent that. We aim to identify potential predictors that could be used as features for modeling algorithms on the basis of routine hospital EHR data to incorporate in an automated tool for estimating the probability of being frail.PubMed (MEDLINE), CINAHL Plus, Embase, and Web of Science will be searched. The studied population consists of older people (≥65 years). The first step is searching articles published ≥2018. Second, we add two published literature reviews (and the articles included therein) [Bery 2020; Bouillon, 2013] to our search results. In these reviews, articles on potential predictor variables in frailty screening tools were included from inception until March 2018. The goal is to identify and extract all potential predictors of being frail. Domain experts will be consulted to evaluate the results.The results of the intended study will increase the quality of the developed algorithms to be used for automated estimation of the probability of being frail in secondary care. This is a promising perspective, being less labor-intensive compared to screening each individual patient by hand. Also, such an automated tool may raise awareness of frailty, especially in those patients who would not be screened for frailty by hand because they seem robust.The identified potential predictors of being frail can be used as evidence-based input for machine learning based automated estimation of the probability of being frail using routine EHR data in the near future."
https://openalex.org/W4297257124,"Background Motor vehicle crashes remain a leading cause of death among young adults (ages 18–25) in the United States. Many drivers implicated in these crashes are under the influence of alcohol, cannabis, or the simultaneous use of alcohol and cannabis. Extremely limited research has assessed impaired driving behaviors and their predictors at the daily level. Perceived norms and motives to use substances have empirical support suggesting they may impact impaired driving-related behavior. Novel approaches to assess these associations at the daily level are needed and may inform future intervention and prevention programs. Objective The goal of the current study is to utilize electronic daily assessments to assess driving under the influence of alcohol, cannabis, or simultaneous use and riding with a driver impaired by these substances to assess variability and predictors of these impaired driving-related behaviors at the daily level. This present manuscript details a protocol, measures, and a plan of analyses to assess how within-person differences in perceived norms and motives to use are associated with the likelihood of engaging in impaired driving-related behaviors. Methods Participants include young adults in Washington State who report simultaneous use in the past month and either driving under the influence of alcohol, cannabis, or simultaneous use, or riding with a driver under the influence of both substances in the past 6 months. Individuals who verify their identity and meet eligibility requirements will complete a baseline assessment after which they will be scheduled for training on the daily assessment procedure via Zoom. Next, they will be invited to complete daily surveys on Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday every other week for 6 months and a 6-month follow up assessment. Analyses will utilize multilevel models with days nested within individuals. Results The study is currently recruiting participants. A total of 192 participants have been recruited and 100 have completed the study protocol. Data collection is expected to be completed in Fall 2022. Conclusions This study utilizes a novel design to assess impaired driving and predictors at the daily level among young adults at high risk of impaired driving-related behaviors. Findings will provide unique data that will shape the knowledge base in the field of social science and public health substance use research and that may be helpful for future prevention and intervention efforts on impaired driving."

Here we use mitochondrial DNA (COI and cytochrome b) and nuclear reduced representation sequencing (ddRADseq) to examine the relationships within and between fairy (Pachyptila turtur) and fulmar (P. crassirostris) prions from across their distributions. We found that neither species was recovered as monophyletic, and that at least three species were represented. Furthermore, we detected several genetic lineages that are also morphologically distinct occurring in near sympatry at two locations (Snares Islands and Chatham Islands). The factors that have driven diversification in the fairy/fulmar prion complex are unclear but may include philopatry, differences in foraging distribution during breeding, differences in non-breeding distributions and breeding habitat characteristics. The observed distribution of genetic variation in the fairy/fulmar prion complex is consistent with population expansion from ice-free Last Glacial Maximum refugia into previously glaciated areas."
https://openalex.org/W4297258482,"The spider mite Tetranychus urticae is an economically important agricultural pest, which feeds on a broad spectrum of plant species. In an RNAseq experiment performed in our laboratory, 4 of the 15 members of the RIN4-like/NOI family of Arabidopsis thaliana were significantly overexpressed after T. urticae infestation. Two of them (NOI3 and NOI5) are shorter and harbour one NOI domain, which characterises this family, and the other two (NOI10 and NOI11) have two-NOI domains. The only member of this family characterized is RIN4, a two-NOI intrinsically disordered protein anchored to the plasma membrane and involved in plant defence against bacterial pathogens. The function of all other members of the RIN4-like/NOI Arabidopsis family and their putative role in herbivore defence remains unknown. We perform a comparative genomic analysis of RIN4-like/NOI sequences to study the evolutionary features of this protein family and the distribution of its members among species. We show that short one-NOI proteins were more numerous and exhibited lower disorder propensity compared to two-NOI members. NOI10 and NOI11, from the two-NOI group, are included in a clade-specific expansion of Brassicaceae with unique predicted posttranslational modification sites and clear predicted structural differences from RIN4. Our analysis suggests that the members of the RIN4-like/NOI family upregulated after mite feeding have novel functions different from those assigned to RIN4, likely involving adaptation to stress specialisation."

With the exception of restless legs and skin changes, there was no statistically significant change in symptom severity or EQ-5D-5L with increasing time from the long interdialytic interval. Patients who responded on non-HD days had higher severity of poor appetite, constipation, difficulty sleeping, poor mobility and depression (approximately 0.2 severity level), and lower EQ-5D-5L (-0.06, CI -0.09 to -0.03) compared to HD days.Measuring symptom severity and EQ-5D-5L in haemodialysis populations does not need to account for dialysis schedule, but completion either on HD or non-HD days could introduce bias that may impact evaluation of interventions. Researchers should ensure completion of these instruments are standardized on either dialysis or non-dialysis days."
https://openalex.org/W4297260349,"Gap and step-off measurements are generally used in the surgical decision-making process of distal radius fractures. Unfortunately, there is no consensus on treatment choice as these measurements are prone to inter- and intraobserver variability. In this study, we aim to introduce a new 3D fracture quantification method and compare it to conventional fracture analysis.Forty patients with a minimally displaced intra-articular distal radius fracture that was treated nonoperatively between 2008-2015 were included. 2D-CT images were reassessed by three orthopedic trauma surgeons who performed gap and step-off measurements. Subsequently, 3D models were created and a 3D measurement method for fracture displacement was developed. For each fracture, the '3D gap area' (3D surface between all fracture fragments) was determined by three observers. Interobserver agreements were calculated for all measurements, and the intraobserver agreement was calculated for the new 3D measurement. All patients completed two questionnaires in order to link our measurements to functional outcome.The interobserver agreement of the 2D measurements was fair (ICC = 0.54) for the gap and poor (ICC = 0.21) for the step-off. The median gap was 2.8 (IQR: 1.9-3.5) mm and step-off was 0.9 (IQR: 0.0-1.6) mm. Interobserver agreement on 3D gap area measurements was excellent (ICC = 0.81), with a median difference between measurements of 6.0 (IQR: 2.0-19.0) mm2, which indicates reliable assessment of 3D fracture displacement. Intraobserver agreement was also excellent (ICC = 0.98), with a median difference of 4.0 (IQR: 1.5-5.5) mm2. No significant differences in clinical outcome were found between the above and below 2mm displacement groups. The score of the DASH was 3.4 (IQR: 0.4-8.8) versus 4.2 (IQR: 0.0-11.6) respectively. Results from the PRWE questionnaire shows a similar result of 3.5 (IQR: 0.0-12.6) versus 5.0 (IQR: 0.0-25.5).3D gap area is a more objective measurement method compared to the conventional gap and step-off measurements to quantify the level of fracture displacement of distal radius fractures. 3D fracture assessment can be used in addition to the currently used classification systems of distal radius fractures."

https://openalex.org/W4297260592,"The pork tapeworm, Taenia solium , is the cause of a preventable zoonotic disease, cysticercosis, affecting both pigs and humans. Continued endemic transmission of T . solium is a major contributor of epilepsy and other neurologic morbidity, and the source of important economic losses, in many rural areas of developing countries. Simulation modelling can play an important role in aiding the design and evaluation of strategies to control or even eliminate transmission of the parasite. In this paper, we present a new agent based model of local-scale T . solium transmission and a new, non-local, approach to the model calibration to fit model outputs to observed human taeniasis and pig cysticercosis prevalence simultaneously for several endemic villages. The model fully describes all relevant aspects of T . solium transmission, including the processes of pig and human infection, the spatial distribution of human and pig populations, the production of pork for human consumption, and the movement of humans and pigs in and out in several endemic villages of the northwest of Peru. Despite the high level of uncertainty associated with the empirical measurements of epidemiological data associated with T . solium , the non-local calibrated model parametrization reproduces the observed prevalences with an acceptable precision. It does so not only for the villages used to calibrate the model, but also for villages not included in the calibration process. This important finding demonstrates that the model, including its calibrated parametrization, can be successfully transferred within an endemic region. This will enable future studies to inform the design and optimization of T . solium control interventions in villages where the calibration may be prevented by the limited amount of empirical data, expanding the possible applications to a wider range of settings compared to previous models."

In this paper, the KdV-CDG equation is analyzed via two reliable and efficient integrating approaches. The suggested techniques; the extended [Formula: see text]-expansion method and exponential (ψ(ξ))-expansion method successfully extract hyperbolic function solutions, trigonometric function solutions and rational function solutions. The existence criteria for all the obtained solutions are also discussed in this paper. At the end, various 3D and 2D contour plots have been constructed for better understanding of constructed solutions."

The key objective of this research is to explore the impact of total quality management initiatives on project performance in the construction industry of Pakistan. Data was collected from 326 personnel working at different management levels across some of the leading construction firms operating in Pakistan. Analysis revealed that operational focus, management commitment, and employee involvement were deemed as dominant total quality management factors affecting project performance in the construction industry. Mediation analysis revealed a significant relationship between employee involvement and project performance mediated by management commitment. Research limitations and directions for future research have also been identified."
https://openalex.org/W4297262251,"Angiogenesis inhibitor drugs targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling to the endothelial cell (EC) are used to treat various cancer types. However, primary or secondary resistance to therapy is common. Clinical and pre-clinical studies suggest that alternative pro-angiogenic factors are upregulated after VEGF pathway inhibition. Therefore, identification of alternative pro-angiogenic pathway(s) is critical for the development of more effective anti-angiogenic therapy. Here we study the role of apelin as a pro-angiogenic G-protein-coupled receptor ligand in tumor growth and angiogenesis. We found that loss of apelin in mice delayed the primary tumor growth of Lewis lung carcinoma 1 and B16F10 melanoma when combined with the VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, sunitinib. Targeting apelin in combination with sunitinib markedly reduced the tumor vessel density, and decreased microvessel remodeling. Apelin loss reduced angiogenic sprouting and tip cell marker gene expression in comparison to the sunitinib-alone-treated mice. Single-cell RNA sequencing of tumor EC demonstrated that the loss of apelin prevented EC tip cell differentiation. Thus, apelin is a potent pro-angiogenic cue that supports initiation of tumor neovascularization. Together, our data suggest that targeting apelin may be useful as adjuvant therapy in combination with VEGF signaling inhibition to inhibit the growth of advanced tumors."
https://openalex.org/W4297262456,"Individuals typically prefer the freedom to make their own decisions. Yet, people often trade their own decision control (procedural utility) to gain economic security (outcome utility). Decision science has not reconciled these observations. We examined how decision-makers' efficacy and security perceptions influence when, why, and how individuals exchange procedural and outcome utility. Undergraduate adults (N = 77; Mage = 19.45 years; 73% female; 62% Caucasian, 13% African American) were recruited from the psychology participant pool at a midwestern U.S. metropolitan university. Participants made financial decisions in easy and hard versions of a paid card task resembling a standard gambling task, with a learning component. During half the trials, they made decisions with a No-Choice Manager who controlled their decisions, versus a Choice Manager who granted decision control. The hard task was designed to be too difficult for most participants, undermining their efficacy and security, and ensuring financial losses. The No-Choice Manager was designed to perform moderately well, ensuring financial gains. Participants felt greater outcome satisfaction (utility) for financial gains earned via Choice, but not losses. Participants (85%) preferred the Choice manager in the easy task but preferred the No-Choice Manager (56%) in the hard task. This change in preference for choice corresponded with self-efficacy and was mediated by perceived security. We used Decision Field Theory to develop potential cognitive models of these decisions. Preferences were best described by a model that assumed decision-makers initially prefer Choice, but update their preference based on loss-dependent attentional focus. When they earned losses (hard task), decision-makers focused more on economic payoffs (financial security), causing them to deemphasize procedural utility. Losses competed for attention, pulling attention toward economic survivability and away from the inherent value of choice. Decision-makers are more likely to sacrifice freedom of choice to leaders they perceive as efficacious to alleviate perceived threats to economic security."
https://openalex.org/W4297263739,"Soil organic carbon (SOC), a core soil quality indicator, is influenced by management practices. The objective of our 2012–2016 study was to elucidate the impact of gypsum, crop rotation, and cover crop on SOC and several of its biological indicators under no-till in Alabama (Shorter), Indiana (Farmland), and Ohio (Hoytville and Piketon) in the USA. A randomized complete block design in factorial arrangement with gypsum (at 0, 1.1, and 2.2 Mg/ha annually), rye ( Secale cereal L.) vs no cover crop, and rotation (continuous soybean [ Glycine max (L) Merr., SS] vs corn [ Zea mays , L.]-soybean, both the CS and SC phases) was conducted. Composite soils were collected (0–15 cm and 15–30 cm) in 2016 to analyze microbial biomass C (SMBC), SOC, total N, active C, cold and hot-water extractable C, C and N pool indices (CPI and NPI), and C management index (CMI). Results varied for main effects of gypsum, crop rotation, and cover crop on SOC pools, total N, and SOC lability within and across the sites. Gypsum at 2.2 Mg/ha increased SMBC within sites and by 41% averaged across sites. Likewise, gypsum increased SMBC:SOC, active C, and hot-water C (as indicators of labile SOC) averaged across sites. CS rotation increased SOC, active C, CPI, and CMI compared to SS, but decreased SMBC and SMBC:SOC within and across sites. CPI had a significant relationship with NPI across all sites (R 2 = 0.90). Management sensitive SOC pools that responded to the combined gypsum (2.2 Mg/ha), crop rotation (CS), and cover crop (rye) were SMBC, SMBC:SOC, active C, and CMI via SMBC. These variables can provide an early indication of management-induced changes in SOC storage and its lability. Our results show that when SOC accumulates, its lability has decreased, presumably because the SMBC has processed all readily available C into a less labile form."
https://openalex.org/W4297263740,"Indoor air pollution is complex and serious. In fact, an on-site investigation of an office building revealed that the concentration of three typical pollutants (CO2, VOCs, PM2.5) exceeded the Chinese standard. To identify a better control method to achieve good indoor air quality, an orthogonal experiment was carried out in an environmental chamber to compare the control time and energy consumption of four control methods (purifier+ and window+, purifier+ and window-, purified fresh air 240 m3/h and purified fresh air 400 m3/h) to meet the standard established for pollutants. The purifier+ and window+ method was found to be more effective in most conditions, with a control time reduced by 8.06% and energy consumption reduced by 11.91% compared with the traditional control method of purified fresh air 240 m3/h. This research highlights the optimal control strategy for the air quality in office buildings under different pollution conditions."
https://openalex.org/W4297264679,"Objective To assess in ART-naïve pregnant women randomized to efavirenz- versus raltegravir-based ART ( IMPAACT P1081 ) whether pretreatment drug resistance ( PDR ) with minority frequency variants (&lt;20% of individual’s viral quasispecies) affects antiretroviral treatment ( ART )-suppression at term. Design A case-control study design compared PDR minority variants in cases with virologic non-suppression (plasma HIV RNA &gt;200 copies/mL) at delivery to randomly selected ART-suppressed controls. Methods HIV pol genotypes were derived from pretreatment plasma specimens by Illumina sequencing. Resistance mutations were assessed using the HIV Stanford Database, and the proportion of cases versus controls with PDR to their ART regimens was compared. Results PDR was observed in 7 participants (11.3%; 95% CI 4.7, 21.9) and did not differ between 21 cases and 41 controls (4.8% vs 14.6%, p = 0.4061). PDR detected only as minority variants was less common (3.2%; 95% CI 0.2, 11.7) and also did not differ between groups (0% vs. 4.9%; p = 0.5447). Cases’ median plasma HIV RNA at delivery was 347c/mL, with most (n = 19/22) showing progressive diminution of viral load but not ≤200c/mL. Among cases with viral rebound (n = 3/22), none had PDR detected. Virologic non-suppression at term was associated with higher plasma HIV RNA at study entry (p&lt;0.0001), a shorter duration of ART prior to delivery (p&lt;0.0001), and randomization to efavirenz- (versus raltegravir-) based ART (p = 0.0085). Conclusions We observed a moderate frequency of PDR that did not significantly contribute to virologic non-suppression at term. Rather, higher pretreatment plasma HIV RNA, randomization to efavirenz-based ART, and shorter duration of ART were associated with non-suppression. These findings support early prenatal care engagement of pregnant women and initiation of integrase inhibitor-based ART due to its association with more rapid suppression of plasma RNA levels. Furthermore, because minority variants appeared infrequent in ART-naïve pregnant women and inconsequential to ART-suppression, testing for minority variants may be unwarranted."
https://openalex.org/W4297264810,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) are the most common referrals in the Inherited Cardiovascular Condition (ICC) Genetics Service. Several issues must be discussed with patients and their families during the genetic consultation session, including the options for genetic testing and cardiovascular surveillance in family members. We developed an ICC registry and performed next-generation-based DNA sequencing for all patients affected by non-syndromic HCM and idiopathic DCM in our joint specialist genetics service. The target gene sequencing panel relied on the Human Phenotype Ontology with 237 genes for HCM (HP:0001639) and 142 genes for DCM (HP:0001644). All subjects were asked to contact their asymptomatic first-degree relatives for genetic counseling regarding their risks and to initiate cardiovascular surveillance and cascade genetic testing. The study was performed from January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2020, and a total of 62 subjects (31-HCM and 31-DCM) were enrolled. The molecular detection frequency was 48.39% (32.26% pathogenic/likely pathogenic, 16.13% variant of uncertain significance or VUS for HCM, and 25.81% (16.13% pathogenic/likely pathogenic, 9.68% VUS) for DCM. The most prevalent gene associated with HCM was MYBPC3 . The others identified in this study included ACTN2 , MYL2 , MYH7 , TNNI3 , TPM1 , and VCL . Among the DCM subjects, variants were detected in two cases with the TTN nonsense variants, while the others were missense and identified in MYH7 , DRSP3 , MYBPC3 , and SCN5A . Following the echocardiogram surveillance and cascade genetic testing in the asymptomatic first-degree relatives, the detection rate of new cases was 8.82% and 6.25% in relatives of HCM and DCM subjects, respectively. Additionally, a new pre-symptomatic relative belonging to an HCM family was identified, although the genomic finding in the affected case was absent. Thus, ICC service is promising for the national healthcare system, aiming to prevent morbidity and mortality in asymptomatic family members."
https://openalex.org/W4297266171,"The problems of water scarcity and ecological fragility are common in the loess gully area. To research the distribution and evolution of the overburden fissures and quantitatively analyze them have certain theoretical and engineering significance for realizing the evaluation of overburden damage degree and safe and green mining. This paper takes the 6102 working face of Chuancao Gedan Coal Mine as the engineering background. The development law and distribution characteristics of overburden fissures caused by the mining of shallow coal seams in the loess gully area were studied by the combination of physical similarity simulation, numerical similarity simulation and fractal theory. The results show that the fractal dimension change of the overburden fissures caused by the shallow mining of coal seam groups in the loess gully area can be divided into three stages during the mining process of the working face. Repeated mining causes the activation and development of overburden fissures, the fractal dimension increases significantly, and the regularity of changes weakens. The magnitude of the stress near the working face and the fluctuation times of the stress in the goaf have an influence on the change of the fractal dimension of the overburden fissures. According to the development angle and the fractal dimension of the overburden fissures, the overburden rock above the goaf is divided into the collapse fissure area, the compaction fissure area, and the vertical fissure area. Overburden fissures develop violently in the vertical fissure area, the overburden fissures in the compaction fissure area are mostly transverse fissures, and the overburden fissures in the caving fissure area are irregular."
