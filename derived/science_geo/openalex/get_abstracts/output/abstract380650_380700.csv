https://openalex.org/W2074617510,"Network science is an interdisciplinary endeavor, with methods and applications drawn from across the natural, social, and information sciences. A prominent problem in network science is the algorithmic detection of tightly-connected groups of nodes known as communities. We developed a generalized framework of network quality functions that allowed us to study the community structure of arbitrary multislice networks, which are combinations of individual networks coupled through links that connect each node in one network slice to itself in other slices. This framework allows one to study community structure in a very general setting encompassing networks that evolve over time, have multiple types of links (multiplexity), and have multiple scales."

Yet, much remains to be learned about how cholesterol levels are regulated at the cellular level (see the Perspective by Brown et al. ). Now, Najafi-Shoushtari et al. (p. 1566 , published online 13 May) and Rayner et al. (p. 1570 , published online 13 May) have discovered a new molecular player in cholesterol control—a small noncoding RNA that, intriguingly, is embedded within the genes coding for sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), transcription factors already known to regulate cholesterol levels. This microRNA, called miR-33, represses expression of the adenosine triphosphate–binding cassette transporter A1, a protein that regulates synthesis of high-density lipoprotein (HDL, or “good” cholesterol) and that helps to remove “bad” cholesterol from the blood. Reducing the levels of miR-33 in mice boosted serum HDL levels, suggesting that manipulation of this regulatory circuit might be therapeutically useful."
https://openalex.org/W2047366062,"Tibetans have lived at very high altitudes for thousands of years, and they have a distinctive suite of physiological traits that enable them to tolerate environmental hypoxia. These phenotypes are clearly the result of adaptation to this environment, but their genetic basis remains unknown. We report genome-wide scans that reveal positive selection in several regions that contain genes whose products are likely involved in high-altitude adaptation. Positively selected haplotypes of EGLN1 and PPARA were significantly associated with the decreased hemoglobin phenotype that is unique to this highland population. Identification of these genes provides support for previously hypothesized mechanisms of high-altitude adaptation and illuminates the complexity of hypoxia-response pathways in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2102901373,"Proper coordination of cholesterol biosynthesis and trafficking is essential to human health. The sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) are key transcription regulators of genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis and uptake. We show here that microRNAs (miR-33a/b) embedded within introns of the SREBP genes target the adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), an important regulator of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) synthesis and reverse cholesterol transport, for posttranscriptional repression. Antisense inhibition of miR-33 in mouse and human cell lines causes up-regulation of ABCA1 expression and increased cholesterol efflux, and injection of mice on a western-type diet with locked nucleic acid-antisense oligonucleotides results in elevated plasma HDL. Our findings indicate that miR-33 acts in concert with the SREBP host genes to control cholesterol homeostasis and suggest that miR-33 may represent a therapeutic target for ameliorating cardiometabolic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1970953441,"Collateral Damage Cotton crops that have been bioengineered to express the insecticidal toxin derived from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) carry their own insect control, particularly against the cotton bollworm, and are less dependent on externally applied pesticides. Lu et al. (p. 1151 , published online 13 April) now show that reduction in general pesticide use in cotton-growing regions of northern China has shifted the balance of regional pest populations. Bt-expressing cotton now serves as a source of herbivorous insects of the Miridae family, rather than the sink that nonengineered cotton was when less specific pesticides were used. Because these insects will eat a variety of plants, they are emerging as a threat to other crops, including grape, apple, peach, and pear."
https://openalex.org/W2106711282,"Klotho has profound effects on phosphate metabolism, but the mechanisms of how Klotho affects phosphate homeostasis is unknown. We detected Klotho in the proximal tubule cell, brush border, and urinary lumen, where phosphate homeostasis resides. Increasing Klotho in the kidney and urine chronically by transgenic overexpression or acutely by intravenous infusion caused hypophosphatemia, phosphaturia from decreased proximal phosphate reabsorption, and decreased activity and protein of the principal renal phosphate transporter NaPi-2a. The phosphaturic effect was present in FGF23-null mice, indicating a direct action distinct from Klotho's known role as a coreceptor for FGF23. Direct inhibition of NaPi-2a by Klotho was confirmed in cultured cells and in cell-free membrane vesicles characterized by acute inhibition of transport activity followed by decreased cell surface protein. Transport inhibition can be mimicked by recombinant beta-glucuronidase and is associated with proteolytic degradation and reduced surface NaPi-2a. The inhibitory effect of Klotho on NaPi-2a was blocked by beta-glucuronidase inhibitor but not by protease inhibitor. Klotho is a novel phosphaturic substance that acts as an enzyme in the proximal tubule urinary lumen by modifying glycans, which cause decreased transporter activity, followed by proteolytic degradation and possibly internalization of NaPi-2a from the apical membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2003138882,"All and Nothing Entanglement, where a system can be in a superposition of a number of distinct states simultaneously, is a principle at the foundation of quantum mechanics (recall Schrödinger's cat, which is both dead and alive). It can also be used in many applications—imaging, communication, patterning, and metrology—with the effect being amplified by entangling larger systems. However, the systematic generation of “large” entangled systems is challenging. Afek et al. (p. 879 ; see the Perspective by Wildfeuer ) present a technique for generating many-photon entanglement in so-called NOON states, where there are two possible paths and N photons in one path and 0 in the other—the system being a superposition of “all and nothing” states. Mixing of entangled pairs with classical light at a beam splitter formed up to five photon-entangled states. The technique should be generally applicable to generate higher-order entangled states."
https://openalex.org/W2120287018,"All Together Now An atom, when excited, will typically decay with a characteristic decay time. An ensemble of atoms, collectively coupled together with just one of the atoms excited will conspire to decay much faster than the single atom case. This enhancement of light-matter interaction is known as superradiance. Röhlsberger et al. (p. 1248 , published online 13 May; see the cover; see the Perspective by Scully and Svidzinsky ) present the realization of an artificial superradiant system comprising resonant iron atoms embedded in a semiconductor cavity and excited by synchrotron radiation and report the signature collective Lamb shift expected from the cooperative interaction and enhanced decay rate. The availability of such a controlled system to look closer at this effect should shed light on its role in natural and complex light-harvesting systems, and possibly allow the production of more efficient solar cells."
https://openalex.org/W2064815954,"Many bacteria in the environment have adapted to the presence of toxic heavy metals. Over the last 30 years, this heavy metal tolerance was the subject of extensive research. The bacterium Cupriavidus metallidurans strain CH34, originally isolated by us in 1976 from a metal processing factory, is considered a major model organism in this field because it withstands milli-molar range concentrations of over 20 different heavy metal ions. This tolerance is mostly achieved by rapid ion efflux but also by metal-complexation and -reduction. We present here the full genome sequence of strain CH34 and the manual annotation of all its genes. The genome of C. metallidurans CH34 is composed of two large circular chromosomes CHR1 and CHR2 of, respectively, 3,928,089 bp and 2,580,084 bp, and two megaplasmids pMOL28 and pMOL30 of, respectively, 171,459 bp and 233,720 bp in size. At least 25 loci for heavy-metal resistance (HMR) are distributed over the four replicons. Approximately 67% of the 6,717 coding sequences (CDSs) present in the CH34 genome could be assigned a putative function, and 9.1% (611 genes) appear to be unique to this strain. One out of five proteins is associated with either transport or transcription while the relay of environmental stimuli is governed by more than 600 signal transduction systems. The CH34 genome is most similar to the genomes of other Cupriavidus strains by correspondence between the respective CHR1 replicons but also displays similarity to the genomes of more distantly related species as a result of gene transfer and through the presence of large genomic islands. The presence of at least 57 IS elements and 19 transposons and the ability to take in and express foreign genes indicates a very dynamic and complex genome shaped by evolutionary forces. The genome data show that C. metallidurans CH34 is particularly well equipped to live in extreme conditions and anthropogenic environments that are rich in metals."
https://openalex.org/W2010860564,"Direct studies of how organic molecules diffuse on metal oxide surfaces can provide insights into catalysis and molecular assembly processes. We studied individual catechol molecules, C6H4(OH)2, on a rutile TiO2(110) surface with scanning tunneling microscopy. Surface hydroxyls enhanced the diffusivity of adsorbed catecholates. The capture and release of a proton caused individual molecules to switch between mobile and immobile states within a measurement period of minutes. Density functional theory calculations showed that the transfer of hydrogen from surface hydroxyls to the molecule and its interaction with surface hydroxyls substantially lowered the activation barrier for rotational motion across the surface. Hydrogen bonding can play an essential role in the initial stages of the dynamics of molecular assembly."
https://openalex.org/W1994412689,"CWD Strain Variation So-called prion diseases are fatal neurogenerative disorders that include chronic wasting disease (CWD) found in deer and other cervids. Prion diseases are thought to be caused by infectious proteins (prions) in the absence of associated infectious DNA. Nevertheless, prion strains have been isolated that can mutate in the absence of nucleic acids, and these strain properties control the ability of prions to cross species barriers. Angers et al. (p. 1154 , published online 13 May; see the Perspective by Collinge ) address the issue of strain variation in the context of CWD. Whereas the host range of this contagious disease continues to expand, the prevalence of CWD strains has not been determined. Understanding CWD strain variation may be important in predicting and preventing any future risks to human health."
https://openalex.org/W2044072065,"Earth's Silver Lining The age of the oldest rocks on Earth's surface is controversial, but, even if they are at their oldest estimate, hundreds of millions of years in our planet's earliest history are still missing. However, in some rocks that until relatively recently resided in the mantle, the isotopic signature from the time of Earth's formation is still preserved. Schönbächler et al. (p. 884 ) exploited this preservation to constrain models that describe the early material that assembled together to form Earth. Because the isotopic profile of silver in these rocks is nearly identical to that measured in a class of primitive meteorites, the earliest material probably had high volatile content. However, the fractionation of other isotopes suggests that the volatile content probably decreased over time in subsequent accretion events. With these isotopic model constraints, it is possible that one of the last major collisions—the Moon-forming giant impact—added considerable amounts of water and other volatile elements to Earth."
https://openalex.org/W1995184566,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the deposition of aggregated beta-amyloid (Abeta), which triggers a cellular stress response called the unfolded protein response (UPR). The UPR signaling pathway is a cellular defense system for dealing with the accumulation of misfolded proteins but switches to apoptosis when endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is prolonged. ER stress is involved in neurodegenerative diseases including AD, but the molecular mechanisms of ER stress-mediated Abeta neurotoxicity still remain unknown. Here, we show that treatment of Abeta triggers the UPR in the SK-N-SH human neuroblastoma cells. Abeta mediated UPR pathway accompanies the activation of protective pathways such as Grp78/Bip and PERK-eIF2alpha pathway, as well as the apoptotic pathways of the UPR such as CHOP and caspase-4. Knockdown of PERK enhances Abeta neurotoxicity through reducing the activation of eIF2alpha and Grp8/Bip in neurons. Salubrinal, an activator of the eIF2alpha pathway, significantly increased the Grp78/Bip ER chaperone resulted in attenuating caspase-4 dependent apoptosis in Abeta treated neurons. These results indicate that PERK-eIF2alpha pathway is a potential target for therapeutic applications in neurodegenerative diseases including AD."
https://openalex.org/W1990157891,"Background Neuromyelitis optica (NMO), a severe demyelinating disease, represents itself with optic neuritis and longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis. Serum NMO-IgG autoantibodies (Abs), a specific finding in NMO patients, target the water channel protein aquaporin-4 (AQP4), which is expressed as a long (M-1) or a short (M-23) isoform. Methodology/Principal Findings The aim of this study was to analyze serum samples from patients with NMO and controls for the presence and epitope specificity of IgG and IgM anti-AQP4 Abs using an immunofluorescence assay with HEK293 cells expressing M-1 or M-23 human AQP4. We included 56 patients with definite NMO (n = 30) and high risk NMO (n = 26), 101 patients with multiple sclerosis, 27 patients with clinically isolated syndromes (CIS), 30 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or Sjögren's syndrome, 29 patients with other neurological diseases and 47 healthy controls. Serum anti-AQP4 M-23 IgG Abs were specifically detected in 29 NMO patients, 17 patients with high risk NMO and two patients with myelitis due to demyelination (CIS) and SLE. In contrast, IgM anti-AQP4 Abs were not only found in some NMO and high risk patients, but also in controls. The sensitivity of the M-23 AQP4 IgG assay was 97% for NMO and 65% for high risk NMO, with a specificity of 100% compared to the controls. Sensitivity with M-1 AQP4 transfected cells was lower for NMO (70%) and high risk NMO (39%). The conformational epitopes of M-23 AQP4 are the primary targets of NMO-IgG Abs, whereas M-1 AQP4 Abs are developed with increasing disease duration and number of relapses. Conclusions Our results confirm M-23 AQP4-IgG Abs as reliable biomarkers in patients with NMO and high risk syndromes. M-1 and M-23 AQP4-IgG Abs are significantly associated with a higher number of relapses and longer disease duration."
https://openalex.org/W2078229478,"A hallmark of p53 function is to regulate a transcriptional program in response to extracellular and intracellular stress that directs cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and cellular senescence. Independent of the role of p53 in the nucleus, some of the anti-proliferative functions of p53 reside within the mitochondria [1]. p53 can arrest cell growth in response to mitochondrial p53 in an EJ bladder carcinoma cell environment that is naïve of p53 function until induced to express p53 [2]. TP53 can independently partition with endogenous nuclear and mitochondrial proteins consistent with the ability of p53 to enact senescence. In order to address the role of p53 in navigating cellular senescence through the mitochondria, we identified SirT3 to rescue EJ/p53 cells from induced p53-mediated growth arrest. Human SirT3 function appears coupled with p53 early during the initiation of p53 expression in the mitochondria by biochemical and cellular localization analysis. Our evidence suggests that SirT3 partially abrogates p53 activity to enact growth arrest and senescence. Additionally, we identified the chaperone protein BAG-2 in averting SirT3 targeting of p53 -mediated senescence. These studies identify a complex relationship between p53, SirT3, and chaperoning factor BAG-2 that may link the salvaging and quality assurance of the p53 protein for control of cellular fate independent of transcriptional activity."
https://openalex.org/W2076032638,"The microtubule-associated protein tau plays a central role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (AD) and abnormally accumulates as neurofibrillary tangles; therefore, the pathways by which tau is degraded have been examined extensively. In AD brain tau is abnormally truncated at Asp421 (tauΔC), which increases its fibrillogenic properties and results in compromised neuronal function. Given the fact that the accumulation of tauΔC is a pathogenic process in AD, in this study we examined whether full-length tau and tauΔC are degraded through similar or different mechanisms. To this end a tetracycline-inducible model was used to show that tauΔC was degraded significantly faster than full-length tau (FL-tau). Pharmacological inhibition of the proteasome or autophagy pathways demonstrated that although FL-tau is degraded by the proteasome, tauΔC is cleared predominantly by macroautophagy. We also found that tauΔC binds C terminus of Hsp70-interacting protein more efficiently than tau. This interaction leads to an increased ubiquitylation of tauΔC in a reconstituted in vitro assay, but surprisingly, tau (full-length or truncated) was not ubiquitylated in situ. The finding that tauΔC and FL-tau are differentially processed by these degradation systems provides important insights for the development of therapeutic strategies, which are focused on modulating degradation systems to preferentially clear pathological forms of the proteins.

The existence of these oligomeric soluble forms combined with the observations that 1) in a tauopathy mouse model, the toxic agent is in a soluble form (as opposed to an insoluble tangle) (9.Santacruz K.

Given the toxic nature of tauΔC, it is of critical importance to understand the pathways that regulate its turnover and clearance from the cell.

In AD neurons there is an accumulation of autophagic vacuoles (AVs) (29.Nixon R.A. Wegiel J. Kumar A. Yu W.H. Peterhoff C. Cataldo A. Cuervo A.M. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2005; 64: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar). This finding of AV accumulation is coupled with indications of disruptions in the macroautophagic pathway, including lowered Beclin-1 levels and structural perturbations to lysosomal morphology (30.Pickford F. Masliah E. Britschgi M. Lucin K. Narasimhan R. Jaeger P.A. Small S. Spencer B. Rockenstein E. Levine B. Wyss-Coray T. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 2190-2199PubMed Google Scholar). Tau has previously been described as a substrate of lysosomal degradation (31.Bednarski E. Lynch G. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 1846-1855Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and more recently as a substrate of autophagy (32.Hamano T. Gendron T.F. Causevic E. Yen S.H. Lin W.L. Isidoro C. Deture M.

Despite these findings, the initiating events and pathways that regulate the proteasomal or lysosomal degradation of tau have not been clearly described. In this study we found that a C-terminal-truncated form of tau that mimics tau cleaved at Asp421 (tauΔC) is removed from the cell much more rapidly than full-length tau (FL-tau) and that the removal of tauΔC from the cell is driven by macroautophagic and lysosomal mechanisms, whereas FL-tau degradation is more dependent on the proteasome. We also found that tauΔC more strongly interacts with CHIP compared with full-length tau and that CHIP preferentially directs the ubiquitylation of tauΔC in vitro. However, we found that neither full-length (FL-tau) nor tauΔC is ubiquitylated in situ. Given these data and the known differences in folding state and aggregative potential (35.Berry R.W. Abraha A. Lagalwar S. LaPointe N. Gamblin T.C. Cryns V.L. Binder L.I. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8325-8331Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) between FL-tau and tauΔC, we propose that the loss of the last 20 amino acids that occurs during AD progression may cause a “switch” between the proteasomal and autophagic degradation pathways and could account for the evidence suggesting the involvement of both pathways in the degradation of tau.

HEK 293-TN cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% Fetal Clone II and 2 mm l-glutamine. Cells were maintained at 33 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. To induce the expression of tau, the stably transfected cells were seeded on 60-mm dishes for 36 h before being treated with doxycycline. The amount of doxycycline used to induce tau expression was experimentally optimized to result in equivalent levels of tau expression between cell lines and ranged from 0.5 to 2 μg/ml. After 12 h, the cells were moved to 37 °C, the culture media were replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and doxycycline, and the cells were cultured for an additional 36 h. For degradation experiments, at time = 0 the doxycycline-containing media was removed, and the cells were carefully washed twice with prewarmed PBS and replenished with doxycycline-deficient media. Transient transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following manufacturer protocols. Cells were cultured for 48 h after transfection before use. For direct blotting of lysates, the cells were collected in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40 (Nonidet P-40), 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin, and the cells were briefly sonicated and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay, and samples were prepared for immunoblotting by dilution in 2× sample buffer (0.25 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2% SDS, 25 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue). For immunoprecipitation (IP), the cells were collected in IP lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm sodium vanadate, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 10 μg/ml leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin. After sonication, centrifugation, and determination of protein content, the samples were diluted to 1 mg/ml with IP lysis buffer. The cells were incubated with mouse monoclonal Tau5 or HA antibodies preconjugated with sheep anti-mouse magnetic beads (Dynal) for 3 h on a rotational shaker at 4 °C. After incubation, the beads were washed either 4 times with low stringency wash buffer (PBS supplemented with 300 mm NaCl and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) or 7 times with high stringency wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1.1 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, and 1 mm EDTA) before elution with 2× sample buffer. For immunoblotting, samples were resolved on 7.5 or 10% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. After a 1-h incubation in 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20), blots were incubated overnight with primary antibody. Blots were washed with TBST and incubated with a secondary antibody for 1 h. After thorough washing with TBST, blots were developed with chemiluminescence (40.Thorpe G.H. Kricka L.J. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 133: 331-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). FL-tau or tauΔC were immunoprecipitated from cells incubated with doxycycline, and the immunoprecipitates were washed with high stringency wash buffer before a final wash in assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol). The ubiquitylation was then carried out essentially as described (41.Moore D.J. West A.B. Dikeman D.A. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. J. Neurochem. 2008; 105: 1806-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The magnetic beads were then incubated with combinations of recombinant Hsp70 (1 μg), HA-ubiquitin (10 μg), E1 (200 ng), UbcH5b (400 ng), CHIP (1 μg), and ATP (2 mm) in a final volume of 50 μl. The samples were incubated for 15 or 60 min. To stop the reactions, 2× sample buffer was added, and the samples were boiled. For the determination of cell viability, cells were seeded in 12-well dishes and cultured as described. Cells were incubated in 400 μm resazurin for 1 h, and fluorescence was measured using a plate reader (BioTek Synergy HT Multi-Detection Microplate Reader) at excitation/emission wavelengths of 530/590 nm. Cells were collected and lysed in IP lysis buffer as described. Protein content was determined using the bicinchoninic acid assay, and equal amounts of protein were incubated with 25 μm proteasome substrate benzoyl-VGR-amidomethylcoumarin (Biomol), an indicator of trypsin-like activity. Fluorescence output was measured kinetically at excitation/emission wavelengths of 360/460 nm. To determine the specificity of the substrate for proteasome activity, parallel samples were spiked with 1 μm epoxomicin. Cells were seeded on 35-mm glass-bottom dishes, transfected with GFP-LC3, and cultured as described above. Images were captured with an AxioCamMR3 camera (Zeiss Corp., Thornwood, NY) connected to a Zeiss Axio Observer D1 microscope with an EC Plan-Neofluor 40×/1.3 oil M27 objective and exported in TIFF format using AxioVision software.

Briefly, cells were treated in either complete media or Hanks' balanced salt solution supplemented with 20 nm bafilomycin A1 to induce maximal numbers of GFP-LC3 puncta. The number of puncta per cell was counted for each condition to determine a threshold autophagy level. Cells with >30 puncta/cell were scored as “autophagic.” and cells with <30 puncta/cell were scored as “non-autophagic.” Degradation rates (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3) were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance and post-hoc t tests. Comparisons in Fig. 6 were performed using Student's t test. A threshold of p < 0.05 was used to establish significance.FIGURE 2Treatment with a proteasome inhibitor attenuated the degradation of FL-tau but not tauΔC.

We have previously shown that two recombinant SP-A2 mutant proteins (G231V and F198S) remain within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of A549 cells and are not secreted into the culture medium. The pathogenic mechanism of the mutant proteins is unknown. Here we analyze all common and rare variants of the surfactant protein A2, SP-A2, in both A549 cells and in primary type II alveolar epithelial cells. We show that, in contrast with all other SP-A2 variants, the mutant proteins are not secreted into the medium with wild-type SP-A isoforms, form fewer intracellular dimer and trimer oligomers, are partially insoluble in 0.5% Nonidet P-40 lysates of transfected A549 cells, and demonstrate greater protein instability in chymotrypsin proteolytic digestions. Both the G231V and F198S mutant SP-A2 proteins are destroyed via the ER-association degradation pathway. Expression of the mutant proteins increases the transcription of a BiP-reporter construct, expression of BiP protein, and production of an ER stress-induced XBP-1 spliced product. Human bronchoalveolar wash samples from individuals who are heterozygous for the G231V mutation have similar levels of total SP-A as normal family members, which suggests that the mechanism of disease does not involve an overt lack of secreted SP-A but instead involves an increase in ER stress of resident type II alveolar epithelial cells.

https://openalex.org/W2099258317,"Glucocorticoids reduce diabetic macular edema, but the mechanisms underlying glucocorticoid effects are imperfectly elucidated. Glucocorticoids may bind to glucocorticoid (GR) and mineralocorticoid (MR) receptors. We hypothesize that MR activation may influence retinal hydration. The effect of the MR agonist aldosterone (24 h) on ion/water channel expression (real-time PCR, Western blot, immunofluorescence) was investigated on cultured retinal Müller glial cells (RMGs, which contribute to fluid homeostasis in the retina), in Lewis rat retinal explants, and in retinas from aldosterone-injected eyes. We evidenced cell-specific expression of MR, GR, and 11-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type II. Aldosterone significantly enhances expression of sodium and potassium channels ENaC-α (6.5-fold) and Kir4.1 (1.9-fold) through MR and GR occupancy, whereas aquaporin 4 (AQP4, 2.9-fold) up-regulation is MR-selective. Aldosterone intravitreous injection induces retinal swelling (24% increase compared to sham-injected eyes) and activation of RMGs. It promotes additional localization of Kir4.1 and AQP4 toward apical microvilli of RMGs. Our results highlight the mineralocorticoid-sensitivity of the neuroretina and show that aldosterone controls hydration of the healthy retina through regulation of ion/water channels expression in RMGs. These results provide a rationale for future investigations of abnormal MR signaling in the pathological retina.—Zhao, M., Valamanesh, F., Celerier, I., Savoldelli, M., Jonet, L., Jeanny, J.-C., Jaisser, F., Farman, N., Behar-Cohen, F.

https://openalex.org/W2109791488,"Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common soft tissue sarcoma in the pediatric population. As this tumor has an undifferentiated myogenic phenotype, agents that promote differentiation hold particular promise as part of a novel therapeutic approach to combat this type of cancer. In this report, we focus on the contribution of two microRNAs (miRNAs) in rhabdomyosarcomas. Levels of miR-1 and miR-133a are drastically reduced in representative cell lines from each major rhabdomyosarcoma subtype (embryonal and alveolar). Introduction of miR-1 and miR-133a into an embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma-derived cell line is cytostatic, thereby suggesting a tumor suppressor-like role for these myogenic miRNAs. Transcriptional profiling of cells after miR-1 and miR-133a expression reveals that miR-1 (but not miR-133a) exerts a strong promyogenic influence on these poorly differentiated tumor cells. We identify mRNAs that are down-regulated by these miRNAs and propose roles for miR-1 and miR-133a in repressing isoforms of genes that are normally not expressed in muscle. Finally, we show that mRNA targets of miR-1 and miR-133a are up-regulated in rhabdomyosarcomas, suggesting a causative role for these miRNAs in the development of rhabdomyosarcomas. More important, these results point to the promise of enhancing rhabdomyosarcoma therapy using miRNAs as agents that mediate cytostasis and promote muscle differentiation.—Rao, P.

https://openalex.org/W2105978178,"As the primary microtubule-organizing centers, centrosomes require gamma-tubulin for microtubule nucleation and organization. Located in close vicinity to centrosomes, the Golgi complex is another microtubule-organizing organelle in interphase cells. CDK5RAP2 is a gamma-tubulin complex-binding protein and functions in gamma-tubulin attachment to centrosomes. In this study, we find that CDK5RAP2 localizes to the Golgi complex in an ATP- and centrosome-dependent manner and associates with Golgi membranes independently of microtubules. CDK5RAP2 contains a centrosome-targeting domain with its core region highly homologous to the Motif 2 (CM2) of centrosomin, a functionally related protein in Drosophila. This sequence, referred to as the CM2-like motif, is also conserved in related proteins in chicken and zebrafish. Therefore, CDK5RAP2 may undertake a conserved mechanism for centrosomal localization. Using a mutational approach, we demonstrate that the CM2-like motif plays a crucial role in the centrosomal and Golgi localization of CDK5RAP2. Furthermore, the CM2-like motif is essential for the association of the centrosome-targeting domain to pericentrin and AKAP450. The binding with pericentrin is required for the centrosomal and Golgi localization of CDK5RAP2, whereas the binding with AKAP450 is required for the Golgi localization. Although the CM2-like motif possesses the activity of Ca(2+)-independent calmodulin binding, binding of calmodulin to this sequence is dispensable for centrosomal and Golgi association. Altogether, CDK5RAP2 may represent a novel mechanism for centrosomal and Golgi localization."
https://openalex.org/W2161616384,"Myoblast differentiation is indispensable for skeletal muscle formation and is governed by the precisely coordinated regulation of a series of transcription factors, including MyoD and myogenin, and transcriptional coregulators. TAZ (transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif) has been characterized as a modulator of mesenchymal stem cell differentiation into osteoblasts and adipocytes through its regulation of lineage-specific master transcription factors. In this study, we investigated whether TAZ affects myoblast differentiation, which is one of the differentiated lineages of mesenchymal stem cells. Ectopic overexpression of TAZ in myoblasts increases myogenic gene expression in a MyoD-dependent manner and hastens myofiber formation, whereas TAZ knockdown delays myogenic differentiation. In addition, enforced coexpression of TAZ and MyoD in fibroblasts accelerates MyoD-induced myogenic differentiation. TAZ physically interacts with MyoD through the WW domain and activates MyoD-dependent gene transcription. TAZ additionally enhances the interaction of MyoD with the myogenin gene promoter. These results strongly suggest that TAZ functions as a novel transcriptional modulator of myogenic differentiation by promoting MyoD-mediated myogenic gene expression.—Jeong, H., Bae, S., An, S.

https://openalex.org/W2031225059,"In thermogenic brown adipose tissue, uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) catalyzes the dissipation of mitochondrial proton motive force as heat. In a cellular environment of high oxidative capacity such as brown adipose tissue (BAT), mitochondrial uncoupling could also reduce deleterious reactive oxygen species, but the specific involvement of UCP1 in this process is disputed. By comparing brown adipose tissue mitochondria of wild type mice and UCP1-ablated litter mates, we show that UCP1 potently reduces mitochondrial superoxide production after cold acclimation and during fatty acid oxidation. We address the sites of superoxide production and suggest diminished probability of ""reverse electron transport"" facilitated by uncoupled respiration as the underlying mechanism of reactive oxygen species suppression in BAT. Furthermore, ablation of UCP1 represses the cold-stimulated increase of substrate oxidation normally seen in active BAT, resulting in lower superoxide production, presumably avoiding deleterious oxidative damage. We conclude that UCP1 allows high oxidative capacity without promoting oxidative damage by simultaneously lowering superoxide production."

Here we describe the crystal structures of recombinant fructosyltransferase (AjFT) from Aspergillus japonicus CB05 and its mutant D191A complexes with various donor/acceptor substrates, including sucrose, 1-kestose, nystose, and raffinose. This is the first structure of fructosyltransferase of the GH32 with a high transfructosylation activity. The structure of AjFT comprises two domains with an N-terminal catalytic domain containing a five-blade β-propeller fold linked to a C-terminal β-sandwich domain.

Whereas recent data suggest that ClC-7 functions as an antiporter, transport characteristics of ClC-6 have remained entirely unknown. Here, we report that fusing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) to the N terminus of ClC-6 increased its cell surface expression, allowing us to functionally characterize ClC-6. Compatible with ClC-6 mediating Cl−/H+ exchange, Xenopus oocytes expressing GFP-tagged ClC-6 alkalinized upon depolarization. This alkalinization was dependent on the presence of extracellular anions and could occur against an electrochemical proton gradient. As observed in other CLC exchangers, ClC-6-mediated H+ transport was abolished by mutations in either the “gating” or “proton” glutamate. Overexpression of GFP-tagged ClC-6 in CHO cells elicited small, outwardly rectifying currents with a Cl− > I− conductance sequence. Mutating the gating glutamate of ClC-6 yielded an ohmic anion conductance that was increased by additionally mutating the “anion-coordinating” tyrosine.

https://openalex.org/W2022181012,"Non-native disulfide isomers of α-conotoxins are generally inactive although some unexpectedly demonstrate comparable or enhanced bioactivity. The actions of “globular” and “ribbon” isomers of α-conotoxin AuIB have been characterized on α3β4 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Using two-electrode voltage clamp recording, we showed that the inhibitory efficacy of the ribbon isomer of AuIB is limited to ∼50%. The maximal inhibition was stoichiometry-dependent because altering α3:β4 RNA injection ratios either increased AuIB(ribbon) efficacy (10α:1β) or completely abolished blockade (1α:10β). In contrast, inhibition by AuIB(globular) was independent of injection ratios. ACh-evoked current amplitude was largest for 1:10 injected oocytes and smallest for the 10:1 ratio. ACh concentration-response curves revealed high (HS, 1:10) and low (LS, 10:1) sensitivity α3β4 nAChRs with corresponding EC50 values of 22.6 and 176.9 μm, respectively. Increasing the agonist concentration antagonized the inhibition of LS α3β4 nAChRs by AuIB(ribbon), whereas inhibition of HS and LS α3β4 nAChRs by AuIB(globular) was unaffected. Inhibition of LS and HS α3β4 nAChRs by AuIB(globular) was insurmountable and independent of membrane potential.

In conclusion, the two isomers of AuIB differ in their inhibitory mechanisms such that AuIB(ribbon) inhibits only LS α3β4 nAChRs competitively, whereas AuIB(globular) inhibits α3β4 nAChRs irrespective of receptor stoichiometry, primarily by a non-competitive mechanism.

Conotoxins are short disulfide-rich bioactive peptides that have been originally isolated from venoms of carnivorous mollusk cone snails, belonging to the genus Conus. α-Conotoxins are among the largest class of conotoxins found in the venom of most cone snail species (1.Azam L. McIntosh J.M. Acta Pharmacol. Sin. 2009; 30: 771-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). This class of conotoxins targets various subtypes of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) 2The abbreviations used are: nAChRnicotinic acetylcholine receptorAChBPacetylcholine-binding proteinHFhydrogen fluorideHShigh sensitivity α3β4 nAChRLSlow sensitivity α3β4 nAChRRP-HPLCreversed phase-high performance liquid chromatographyPDBProtein data bank. and is distinguished by four cysteines arranged in a CC-C-C pattern. nicotinic acetylcholine receptor acetylcholine-binding protein hydrogen fluoride high sensitivity α3β4 nAChR low sensitivity α3β4 nAChR reversed phase-high performance liquid chromatography Protein data bank. α-Conotoxins have attracted considerable attention as some of them, such as Vc1.1 and RgIA, have been shown to possess analgesic activity in rodent behavioral models of neuropathic pain (2.Callaghan B. Haythornthwaite A. Berecki G. Clark R.J. Craik D.J. Adams D.J. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 10943-10951Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 3.Luo S. Kulak J.M. Cartier G.E. Jacobsen R.B. Yoshikami D. Olivera B.M. McIntosh J.M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8571-8579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, AuIB has recently been shown to be analgesic in vivo despite the fact that it acts on the α3β4 nAChR subtype different from the α9α10 nAChR targeted by Vc1.1 and RgIA. 3M. J. Christie, personal communication. Vc1.1 and RgIA have been shown to suppress N-type Ca2+ channel currents in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons of neonatal and adult rats and wild type and α9 knock-out mice via activation of GABAB G protein-coupled receptors (2.Callaghan B. Haythornthwaite A. Berecki G. Clark R.J. Craik D.J. Adams D.J. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 10943-10951Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Similarly, AuIB inhibits N-type Ca2+ channels in rat DRG neurons analogous to Vc1.1 and RgIA and its effect can be blocked with selective GABAB receptor antagonists. 4B. Callaghan and D. J. Adams, unpublished observations. GABAB-mediated inhibition of N-type Ca2+ channels is proposed as an analgesic mechanism for α-conotoxins Vc1.1, RgIA, and AuIB (2.Callaghan B. Haythornthwaite A. Berecki G. Clark R.J. Craik D.J. Adams D.J. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 10943-10951Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), which can reconcile obvious differences in their nAChR subtype selectivity. α-Conotoxin AuIB has been characterized on oocyte-expressed nAChRs and shown to be selective primarily for the α3β4 nAChR subtype (3.Luo S. Kulak J.M. Cartier G.E. Jacobsen R.B. Yoshikami D. Olivera B.M. McIntosh J.M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8571-8579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The α3β4 nAChR subtype is a predominant subtype in autonomic ganglia, adrenal medulla, and in subpopulations of central nervous system neurons such as medial habenula and dorsal medulla (4.Millar N.S. Gotti C. Neuropharmacology. 2009; 56: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). AuIB is a 15-residue conotoxin with an unusual 4/6 intercysteine spacing. Native AuIB peptide found in the venom, like the vast majority of other α-conotoxins, has 2–8, 3–15 (Cys1-Cys3, Cys2-Cys4) cystine globular connectivity (5.Dutton J.L. Bansal P.S. Hogg R.C. Adams D.J. Alewood P.F. Craik D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48849-48857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). When AuIB is synthesized chemically, a disulfide bond isomer having 2–15, 3–8 (Cys1-Cys4, Cys2-Cys3) connectivity is co-produced as a by-product, which is the ribbon isoform of AuIB (Fig. 1A) (5.Dutton J.L.

Surprisingly, the ribbon isomer of AuIB has been shown previously to be ∼10-fold more potent at nAChRs of rat parasympathetic ganglion neurons compared with the globular (native) peptide isoform (5.Dutton J.L. Bansal P.S. Hogg R.C. Adams D.J. Alewood P.F. Craik D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48849-48857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, when AuIB(ribbon) was probed on rat nAChRs heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes it was reported to be less active than the globular isomer (6.Nicke A. Samochocki M. Loughnan M.L. Bansal P.S. Maelicke A. Lewis R.J. FEBS Lett. 2003; 554: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The difference in activity of the two AuIB isomers on native versus recombinant nAChRs remains to be elucidated. Taken together, there is an incomplete understanding of diversity of mechanisms of action of α-conotoxin AuIB and its isoforms. Here, we further explore the inhibitory mechanisms of globular and ribbon isomers of AuIB on rat α3β4 nAChRs expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Manipulations of the α3:β4 subunit ratios show that α3β4 nAChRs expressed in oocytes are present in different subunit stoichiometries and inhibition by AuIB(ribbon), but not AuIB(globular), is limited to one of the receptor stoichiometries. Inhibition by AuIB(ribbon) is consistent with a competitive antagonism, whereas AuIB(globular) inhibits α3β4 nAChRs via a non-competitive mechanism. The peptide was assembled on a 4-methylbenzhydrylamine resin by manual tert-butoxycarbonyl solid-phase peptide synthesis using 2-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate-mediated in situ neutralization protocol with N,N′-dimethylformamide as solvent (7.Schnölzer M. Alewood P. Jones A. Alewood D. Kent S.B.H. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1992; 40: 180-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). HF deprotection and cleavage was performed by treatment of the dried peptide resin (300 mg) with 10 ml of HF/p-cresol/p-thio-cresol (18:1:1, v/v/v) for 2 h at 0 °C. Following evaporation of the HF, the peptide was precipitated and washed with cold ether, filtered, and re-dissolved in 30 ml of 50% acetonitrile, 1% trifluoroacetic acid, and lyophilized. Oxidative folding was carried out in 0.1 m NH4HCO3 (pH 8.2, concentration = 0.1 μm) resulting in formation of the globular and ribbon isomers of AuIB (Fig. 1B). Oxidation was monitored by RP-HPLC, liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, and mass spectrometry, and the peptide isomers were isolated using preparative C18 RP-HPLC. CD spectroscopy was performed on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter. Spectra were recorded at room temperature under nitrogen atmosphere. Peptides were dissolved in 20 mm phosphate buffer, containing 30% trifluoroethanol at pH 7. The peptide concentration was determined by quantitative RP-HPLC. The peptides were transferred into a 0.01-cm path length demountable cell and data were recorded over 5 scans, from 260 to 185 nm at 10 nm/min, with a resolution of 1 nm and a response time of 0.25 s. CD data in ellipticity was converted to mean residue ellipticity ([θ]R) using the equation: [θ]R = θ/(10 × C × Np × l), where θ is the ellipticity in millidegrees, C is the peptide molar concentration (M), l is the cell path length (cm), and Np is the number of peptide residues. CD was used to confirm the globular and ribbon AuIB structure. AuIB(globular) showed CD spectra with α-helical content as opposed to that of AuIB(ribbon), which has less secondary structure (Fig. 1C). Plasmid DNAs encoding rat α3 and β4 nAChR subunits were obtained from J. Patrick (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX). After multiplication plasmid DNA was linearized with appropriate restriction enzymes and cRNA was synthesized in vitro using a SP6 in vitro transcription kit (mMessage mMachine; Ambion, Foster City, CA). RNA for α3 and β4 subunits was synthesized in parallel on the same day using identical procedures to maximize consistency between subunits in concentration and purity. RNA concentration was controlled spectrophotometrically for each new aliquot of RNA and before injections. Total amount of RNA injected per oocyte was ∼5 ng in ∼50 nl/volume. Stage V to VI oocytes obtained from Xenopus laevis were subsequently incubated for 2–8 days at 18 °C before electrophysiological recordings as described previously (6.Nicke A. Samochocki M. Loughnan M.L. Bansal P.S. Maelicke A. Lewis R.J. FEBS Lett. 2003; 554: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Oocytes were transferred to the recording chamber (∼50 μl volume) and perfused at 3–5 ml/min with ND96 solution (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) by a gravity fed perfusion system. nAChR-mediated currents were evoked by pipetting 100 μl of ACh-containing solutions into the bath with the perfusion stopped. Oocytes were preincubated with the peptide for ∼5 min prior to ACh application and subsequently ACh was co-applied together with the peptide. Two-electrode voltage clamp recordings from Xenopus oocytes were made at room temperature (21–23 °C) using a GeneClamp 500B amplifier (Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA) at a holding potential of −80 mV. ACh-induced currents were recorded and their peak amplitudes were measured with pClamp 9 software (Molecular Devices Corp.). ACh-evoked currents recorded following exposure to peptides were normalized to an average of 2–6 control ACh-induced currents. Data from several experiments were pooled and each data point represents the average of 3–8 cells ± S.E. Estimates of toxins potencies (IC50, nH) were obtained by fitting data points to the equation: % response = 100/{1 + ([toxin]/IC50)nH} with SigmaPlot8 (Systat Software Inc., San Jose, CA). The molecular model of rat α3 subunit was generated using α1 nAChR subunit (Protein Data Bank (PDB) code 2QC1 (8.Dellisanti C.D. Yao Y. Stroud J.C. Wang Z.Z. Chen L. Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 953-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar)). The rat β4 subunit homology model was generated using the β chain of Torpedo acetylcholine receptor (PDB ID 2BG9 (9.Unwin N. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 967-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (1419) Google Scholar)), as several attempts by using high resolution AChBP crystal structures were not satisfactory.

The subunit α3 and β4 and the pentamers (α3)3(β4)2 and (α3)2(β4)3 were validated individually using online server Verify3D (18.Bowie J.U. Lüthy R. Eisenberg D. Science. 1991; 253: 164-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (2417) Google Scholar) and Ramachandran plot available from ProFunc data base (19.Laskowski R.A. Watson J.D. Thornton J.M.

Tseng J. Binkowski A. Turpaz Y. Liang J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: W116-W118Crossref PubMed Scopus (1416) Google Scholar). In addition, we further validated our homology models by performing a global docking simulation with ACh. The outcome showed that ACh only docked to the classical agonist binding site in the α(+)β(−) interface and was unaffected by subunit stoichiometry (supplemental Fig. S1). Each of the top 20 lowest energy NMR structures of globular (PDB code 1MXN (5.Dutton J.L. Bansal P.S. Hogg R.C. Adams D.J. Alewood P.F. Craik D.J. J. Biol.

The solutions that disagreed with the known constraints, such as binding at the transmembrane region or inside the ion permeation pathway were excluded. All docking simulation with (α3)3(β4)2 and (α3)2(β4)3 pentamer models were successful, except for docking of ribbon AuIB to (α3)3(β4)2. Global docking (without energy minimization) of ribbon AuIB to (α3)3(β4)2 pentamer showed that ribbon AuIB docked in the C-loop binding site. However, no solution could be obtained after energy minimization. Therefore, we tried the α(+)β(−) dimer extracted directly from the (α3)3(β4)2 pentamer models, an approach used previously for docking simulations at AChBP-derived models of nAChRs. The docking solutions after energy minimization showed that ribbon AuIB docked at the same location as the global docking in the (α3)3(β4)2 pentamer. For consistency, dimer extracted from (α3)3(β4)2 and (α3)2(β4)3 pentamer models were also used for docking simulation with globular and ribbon AuIB. Outcomes of docking simulations of globular and ribbon AuIB to dimer (α3)3(β4)2 and (α3)2(β4)3 models are consistent with results obtained using pentameric models. The top 20 energetically favorable docking solutions of each combination were selected and are presented in Fig. 8. Concentration-response curves were obtained for the inhibition of rat α3β4 nAChRs expressed in Xenopus oocytes by globular and ribbon isomers of AuIB α-conotoxin (Fig. 2). Surprisingly, the two isomers of AuIB demonstrated a marked difference in their efficacy for inhibition of α3β4 nAChRs. AuIB(globular) at a concentration of 10 μm completely inhibited α3β4 nAChRs (95.3 ± 0.9%, n = 6; p < 0.03), whereas AuIB(ribbon) did not exceed 50% block even at a concentration of 30 μm (Fig. 2, A and B). The concentration-response relationships for AuIB(globular) and AuIB(ribbon) gave IC50 values of 2.48 and 0.77 μm, respectively (Table 1). We hypothesized that the difference in inhibitory action of the two AuIB isomers may be due to specific action of the AuIB(ribbon) on one of the two likely ((α3)3(β4)2 versus (α3)2(β4)3) α3β4 nAChR stoichiometries. The concentration-response curves shown in Fig. 2B were obtained on oocytes injected with equal amounts of α3 and β4 RNA (1:1 injection ratio). Theoretically, a 1:1 injection ratio may yield equal occurrence of the (α3)2(β4)3 and (α3)3(β4)2 stoichiometries, which would result in maximal inhibition of 50% of the whole cell ACh-evoked current amplitude if blockade of α3β4 nAChRs by AuIB(ribbon) is stoichiometry dependent.TABLE 1Comparison of concentration-response curves parameters of AuIB analogues obtained in oocytes injected with different α3 and β4 nAChR subunit ratiosα3:β4 ratioAuIB(globular)AuIB(ribbon)IC50nHIC50nHμmμm10:11.11.380.860.941:12.481.370.77aMaximal efficacy ∼50%.

Open table in a new tab To probe the stoichiometry sensitivity of α3β4 nAChR inhibition by AuIB isomers, experiments were carried out on oocytes injected with different amounts of RNA encoding α3/β4 subunits. Concentration-response curves for inhibition of ACh-evoked currents by AuIB isomers in oocytes injected at 10:1 versus 1:10 α3:β4 ratios are shown on Fig. 3A. The efficacy of inhibition (maximal block) by AuIB(ribbon) at α3-dominant (10α:1β) nAChRs increased to 73.2 ± 3.0% (n = 8, p < 0.001) at 10 μm (Fig. 2A) but the IC50 of 0.86 μm remained approximately the same as for 1:1 injected oocytes (IC50 = 0.77 μm, Table 1). In contrast, in β4-dominant (1α:10β) nAChRs, the ribbon isoform of AuIB exhibited a dramatic decrease in inhibitory effect averaging only 14.2 ± 1.1% maximal block at 30 μm AuIB(ribbon) (Fig. 3A, panel ii). In comparison, maximal block by AuIB(globular) was unaffected by varying the α3:β4 ratios at both α3-dominant (10:1 ratio) nAChRs and β4-dominant (1:10 ratio) nAChRs (Fig. 3A, panels i and ii). We note that nAChR inhibition by AuIB(ribbon) in oocytes injected with the 10:1 ratio of mRNAs was incomplete (Fig. 3B, panel ii). This incomplete block likely reflects expression of a population of (α3)2(β4)3 receptors insensitive to the ribbon isomer (Fig. 3A, panel ii). Comparison of the concentration-response relationships obtained from oocytes with different α3β4 nAChR subunit ratios indicates distinct modes of action of AuIB(ribbon) versus AuIB(globular) (Fig. 3). Shifting α3:β4 ratios did not change the maximal inhibition as well as the other parameters of the AuIB(globular) concentration-response curve (Fig. 3B, panel i). Half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) and Hill slopes (nH) obtained for AuIB(globular) inhibition of ACh-evoked currents were 1.1 (1.38), 2.48 (1.37), and 3.0 μm (1.0) for 10:1, 1:1, and 1:10 ratios, respectively (Table 1). In contrast, when the subunit ratio changed from 10:1 to 1:10, the concentration-response curve of AuIB(ribbon) flattened out to exhibit no significant inhibition at β-dominated oocytes (Fig. 3B, panel ii). These results suggest an intrinsic difference in the mechanisms of action of the two isomers of α-conotoxin AuIB. Varying the α3:β4 subunit ratio in oocytes in either direction had a marked effect on the ACh-induced current amplitude. Application of 50 μm ACh elicited the largest currents in oocytes injected at a 1:10 ratio, and the smallest current amplitudes in oocytes injected with a 10:1 α3:β4 ratio. Injecting all three different ratios of RNA in oocytes resulted in a significant difference between the average ACh-evoked current amplitudes in the three groups (Fig. 4A). The average amplitude of ACh-evoked currents in the 10:1 ratio injected oocytes was 1.66 ± 0.14 μA and 13.74 ± 2.26 μA in 1:1, and 23.33 ± 3.48 μA in 1:10 (n = 17–21). The current amplitudes in the 10:1 and 1:10 ratio injected oocytes were significantly different from the current amplitudes obtained for the 1:1 ratio injected oocytes (p < 0.001, 10:1; p < 0.05 1:10, unpaired t test) (Fig. 4A). In a series of experiments on 10:1 ratio injected oocytes, 2.5 mm ACh elicited current amplitudes similar to those observed for 1:10 injected oocytes (data not shown) indicating that the smaller current observed in response to 50 μm ACh in 10:1 oocytes was not due to reduced nAChR expression. We hypothesized that the sensitivity to ACh (EC50) may account for different current amplitudes observed for the three different subunit ratios. To test this possibility, ACh sensitivity of oocytes injected with different α3:β4 subunit ratios was examined. The ACh concentration-response curves obtained for 10:1 and 1:10 ratio groups were strikingly different with an EC50 of 176.9 ± 23.9 μm (n = 4–7) for 10:1 ratio injected oocytes and 22.56 ± 1.41 μm (n = 3–8) for the 1:10 oocyte group (Fig. 4B). The Hill slope was also different between the two ratio groups (2.1 ± 0.5 for 10:1 and 1.00 ± 0.1 for 1:10) suggesting that the 10:1 α3β4 nAChR may bind 2 ACh molecules, whereas the 1:10 α3β4 nAChR binds a single agonist molecule (Fig. 4B). The β-dominated nAChRs (1:10) are high sensitivity receptors and α-dominated nAChRs (10:1) are low sensitivity α3β4 nicotinic receptors. The ACh concentration-response curve for the 1:1 injected oocytes was fit with an EC50 of 92.8 ± 6.6 μm and nH = 1.3 ± 0.1 (n = 3–8), which was between the values obtained for 1:10 and 10:1 ratios (Fig. 4B). The parameters obtained from the ACh concentration-response curves for the three subunit ratios are summarized in Table 2. These findings indicate that the different stoichiometries of α3β4 nAChRs expressed in oocytes underlie the differences in EC50, Hill slope, and ACh-evoked current amplitudes observed for the three groups.TABLE 2Agonist sensitivity of different α3β4 nAChR stoichiometriesα3:β4 ratioEC50 AChnHμm10:1176.9 ± 23.872.14 ± 0.581:192.88 ± 6.611.32 ± 0.131:1022.56 ± 1.411.00 ± 0.06 Open table in a new tab The ACh concentration-response curves determined for the three different α3:β4 ratios indicate that 50 μm ACh used in our initial experiments is below the EC50 for the 10:1 ratio and close to saturation for the 1:10 ratio injected oocytes (Fig. 5). The difference in the EC50 may account for the differential inhibitory effect of AuIB(ribbon) tested on all three injection groups. The ACh dependence of the inhibition of 10:1 ratio α3β4 nAChRs by both AuIB isomers was investigated for three different ACh concentrations: 50, 175 (∼EC50), and 500 μm. Concentration-response curves for AuIB isomers obtained at different ACh concentrations are shown in Fig. 5. The inhibition of α3β4 nAChRs by AuIB(globular) was not strongly dependent on ACh concentration: IC50 values of 1.1, 0.9, and 2.3 μm were obtained for 50, 175, and 500 μm ACh, respectively (Table 3). Overall, increasing the agonist concentration produced a small rightward shift of the concentration-response curve only at saturating ACh concentration (500 μm) without affecting maximal inhibition achieved. In contrast, the efficacy of α3β4 nAChRs inhibition by AuIB(ribbon) decreased with increasing ACh concentration (Fig. 5B). 10 μm AuIB(ribbon) inhibited α3β4 nAChRs by 73.2 ± 3.0% using 50 μm ACh, 34.2 ± 2.1% at 175 μm, and 22.2 ± 3.1% at 500 μm ACh (Fig. 5B). Inhibition of α3β4 nAChRs at a 10:1 ratio by AuIB(ribbon) is sensitive to the ACh concentration, whereas AuIB(globular) is relatively insensitive to the agonist concentration suggesting a competitive mechanism of action for the ribbon isomer of AuIB and non-competitive for the globular isomer.TABLE 3Concentration-response curve parameters determined for AuIB(globular) and -(ribbon) inhibition at different α3:β4 subunit ratios and ACh concentrations (n ≥ 3)AuIB isomer10:11:10[ACh]IC50nH[ACh]IC50nHμmμmGlobular50 μm1.11.385 μm1.240.85175 μm0.861.3750 μm3.01.0500 μm2.361.685 mm5.81.63Ribbon50 μm0.860.943 μmNAaNA, not active.

Open table in a new tab The effect of ACh concentration on the inhibition of β4-dominant oocytes (1:10 ratio) by AuIB isomers was examined. AuIB(globular) inhibition of β4-dominant nAChRs was tested for three different ACh concentrations: 5 μm, 50 μm (∼EC50), and 5 mm. The concentration-response curves obtained for the globular isomer exhibited a rightward shift at low toxin concentrations; however, AuIB(globular) retained full efficacy even at a saturating ACh concentration (5 mm). The maximal inhibition produced by 30 μm AuIB(globular) was 97.8 ± 0.2% at 5 μm ACh, 94.4 ± 1.1% at 50 μm ACh, and 96.1 ± 1.3% at 5 mm ACh (Fig. 6A). Half-maximal inhibitory AuIB(globular) concentrations were 1.24, 3.0, and 5.8 μm for 5 μm, 50 μm, and 5 mm ACh, respectively (Table 3). Because AuIB(ribbon) inhibition is competitive and ACh concentration dependent in LS nAChRs, there is a possibility that in HS inhibition is masked due to lower ACh EC50 for HS; however, AuIB(ribbon) was not active in 1:10 ratio injected oocytes even at low ACh concentrations (3 μm) (Fig. 6B, inset). These data suggest that the lack of activity of AuIB(ribbon) at 1:10 nAChRs may be due to dependence of the inhibition on α3β4 nAChR stoichiometry, probably, because of a modified ACh binding site at 1:10 α3β4 nAChRs. Effects of different ACh concentrations on concentration-response curve parameters for the AuIB isomers obtained in 10:1 and 1:10 oocytes are summarized in Table 3. AuIB(globular) inhibition of α3β4 nAChRs, in contrast to AuIB(ribbon), is not significantly impaired by subunit stoichiometry or agonist concentration. The mechanism of nAChR inhibition by AuIB(globular) is consistent with non-competitive receptor antagonism. To further examine mechanism(s) of action of AuIB(globular), ACh concentration-response curves were determined in the presence of different concentrations of AuIB(globular) at 1:10 ratio injected oocytes where the ribbon isomer is inactive. Increasing concentrations of AuIB(globular) did not induce a parallel shift of the ACh concentration-response curve (see Fig. 7A) and even saturating ACh concentrations did not impair inhibition of HS α3β4 nAChRs by AuIB(globular) when it"
https://openalex.org/W1993581747,"The induction of expression of many cellular immediate early genes (IEG) involves the transcription factor serum response factor (SRF). Two families of SRF coactivators have also been implicated in IEG induction, the ternary complex factors (TCFs), ELK1, Sap1, and Net, and the myocardin-related factors, MKL1 and MKL2. We found that serum induction of some SRF target genes is preferentially regulated by MKL1/2, whereas others are redundantly activated by both TCFs and MKL1/2. Yet ELK1 can also repress transcription. Binding of ELK1 and MKL1 to SRF has been found to be mutually exclusive in vitro, suggesting that ELK1 could repress expression of IEGs by blocking MKL1 binding. We characterized the in vivo binding of MKL1 and ELK1 to target genes and found an inverse relationship of serum-induced MKL1 binding and serum-decreased ELK1 binding. However, experiments with short hairpin RNA-mediated MKL1/2 depletion and expression of a nuclear MKL1 (N100) variant in stably transfected cells failed to alter ELK1 binding, suggesting that ELK1 binding to target genes is regulated independently of MKL1/2. Nevertheless, we found that short interfering RNA-mediated depletion of TCFs increased target gene expression in cells containing the N100 MKL1 activator, most notably in cells under continuous growth conditions. These results indicate that the TCFs can function both as activators and repressors of target gene expression depending upon the cellular growth conditions."

https://openalex.org/W2075851787,"Adult stem cells are present in many tissues including, skin, muscle, adipose, bone marrow, and in the brain. Neuroinflammation has been shown to be a potent negative regulator of stem cell and progenitor cell proliferation in the neurogenic regions of the brain. Recently we demonstrated that decreasing a key neuroinflammatory cytokine IL-1beta in the hippocampus of aged rats reversed the age-related cognitive decline and increased neurogenesis in the age rats. We also have found that nutraceuticals have the potential to reduce neuroinflammation, and decrease oxidative stress. The objectives of this study were to determine if spirulina could protect the proliferative potential of hippocampal neural progenitor cells from an acute systemic inflammatory insult of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). To this end, young rats were fed for 30 days a control diet or a diet supplemented with 0.1% spirulina. On day 28 the rats were given a single i.p. injection of LPS (1 mg/kg). The following day the rats were injected with BrdU (50 mg/kg b.i.d. i.p.) and were sacrificed 24 hours after the first injection of BrdU. Quantification of the BrdU positive cells in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus demonstrated a decrease in proliferation of the stem/progenitor cells in the hippocampus as a result of the LPS insult. Furthermore, the diet supplemented with spirulina was able to negate the LPS induced decrease in stem/progenitor cell proliferation. In a second set of studies we examined the effects of spirulina either alone or in combination with a proprietary formulation (NT-020) of blueberry, green tea, vitamin D3 and carnosine on the function of bone marrow and CD34+ cells in vitro. Spirulina had small effects on its own and more than additive effects in combination with NT-020 to promote mitochondrial respiration and/or proliferation of these cells in culture. When examined on neural stem cells in culture spirulina increased proliferation at baseline and protected against the negative influence of TNFalpha to reduce neural stem cell proliferation. These results support the hypothesis that a diet enriched with spirulina and other nutraceuticals may help protect the stem/progenitor cells from insults."
https://openalex.org/W1975362411,"REX1/ZFP42 is a well-known embryonic stem cell (ESC) marker. However, the role of REX1, itself, is relatively unknown because the function of REX1 has only been reported in the differentiation of ESCs via STAT signaling pathways. Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) isolated from young tissues and cancer cells express REX1.Human umbilical cord blood-derived MSCs (hUCB-MSCs) and adipose tissue-derived MSCs (hAD-MSCs) strongly express REX1 and have a lower activation status of p38 MAPK, but bone marrow-derived MSCs (hBM-MSCs) have weak REX1 expression and higher activation of p38 MAPK. These results indicated that REX1 expression in hMSCs was positively correlated with proliferation rates but inversely correlated with the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK. In hUCB-MSCs, the roles of REX1 and p38 MAPK were investigated, and a knockdown study was performed using a lentiviral vector-based small hairpin RNA (shRNA). After REX1 knockdown, decreased cell proliferation was observed. In REX1 knocked-down hUCB-MSCs, the osteogenic differentiation ability deteriorated, but the adipogenic potential increased or was similar to that observed in the controls. The phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in hUCB-MSCs significantly increased after REX1 knockdown. After p38 MAPK inhibitor treatment, the cell growth in REX1 knocked-down hUCB-MSCs almost recovered, and the suppressed expression levels of CDK2 and CCND1 were also restored. The expression of MKK3, an upstream regulator of p38 MAPK, significantly increased in REX1 knocked-down hUCB-MSCs. The direct binding of REX1 to the MKK3 gene was confirmed by a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay.These findings showed that REX1 regulates the proliferation/differentiation of hMSCs through the suppression of p38 MAPK signaling via the direct suppression of MKK3. Therefore, p38 MAPK and REX-1 status can determine the cell fate of adult stem cells (ASCs). These results were the first to show the role of REX1 in the proliferation/differentiation of ASCs."
https://openalex.org/W1977426928,"Background In order to generate hypotheses regarding the mechanisms by which 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (dioxin) causes toxicity, we analyzed global gene expression changes in developing zebrafish embryos exposed to this potent toxicant in the context of a dynamic gene network. For this purpose, we also computationally inferred a zebrafish (Danio rerio) interactome based on orthologs and interaction data from other eukaryotes. Methodology/Principal Findings Using novel computational tools to analyze this interactome, we distinguished between dioxin-dependent and dioxin-independent interactions between proteins, and tracked the temporal propagation of dioxin-dependent transcriptional changes from a few genes that were altered initially, to large groups of biologically coherent genes at later times. The most notable processes altered at later developmental stages were calcium and iron metabolism, embryonic morphogenesis including neuronal and retinal development, a variety of mitochondria-related functions, and generalized stress response (not including induction of antioxidant genes). Within the interactome, many of these responses were connected to cytochrome P4501A (cyp1a) as well as other genes that were dioxin-regulated one day after exposure. This suggests that cyp1a may play a key role initiating the toxic dysregulation of those processes, rather than serving simply as a passive marker of dioxin exposure, as suggested by earlier research. Conclusions/Significance Thus, a powerful microarray experiment coupled with a flexible interactome and multi-pronged interactome tools (which are now made publicly available for microarray analysis and related work) suggest the hypothesis that dioxin, best known in fish as a potent cardioteratogen, has many other targets. Many of these types of toxicity have been observed in mammalian species and are potentially caused by alterations to cyp1a."

We investigated the gene expression responses of Candidatus Pelagibacter ubique cultures to iron limitation in natural seawater media supplemented with a siderophore to chelate iron. Microarray data indicated transcription of the periplasmic iron binding protein sfuC increased by 16-fold, and iron transporter subunits, iron-sulfur center assembly genes, and the putative ferroxidase rubrerythrin transcripts increased to a lesser extent. Quantitative peptide mass spectrometry revealed that sfuC protein abundance increased 27-fold, despite an average decrease of 59% across the global proteome. Thus, we propose sfuC as a marker gene for indicating iron limitation in marine metatranscriptomic and metaproteomic ecological surveys. The marked proteome reduction was not directly correlated to changes in the transcriptome, implicating post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms as modulators of protein expression. Two RNA-binding proteins, CspE and CspL, correlated well with iron availability, suggesting that they may contribute to the observed differences between the transcriptome and proteome. We propose a model in which the RNA-binding activity of CspE and CspL selectively enables protein synthesis of the iron acquisition protein SfuC during transient growth-limiting episodes of iron scarcity."
https://openalex.org/W2091211735,"Background Social science studies of doping practices in sport rely predominantly on self-reports. Studies of psychoactive drug use indicate that self-reporting is characterised by under-reporting. Likewise doping practice is likely to be equally under-reported, if not more so. This calls for more sophisticated methods for such reporting and for independent, objective validation of its results. The aims of this study were: i) to contrast self-reported doping use with objective results from chemical hair analysis and ii) to investigate the influence of the discrepancy on doping attitudes, social projection, descriptive norms and perceived pressure to use doping. Methodology/Principal Findings A doping attitudes questionnaire was developed and combined with a response latency-based implicit association test and hair sample analysis for key doping substances in 14 athletes selected from a larger sample (N = 82) to form contrast comparison groups. Results indicate that patterns of group differences in social projection, explicit attitude about and perceived pressure to use doping, vary depending on whether the user and non-user groups are defined by self-report or objectively verified through hair analysis. Thus, self-confessed users scored higher on social projection, explicit attitude to doping and perceived pressure. However, when a doping substance was detected in the hair of an athlete who denied doping use, their self-report evidenced extreme social desirability (negative attitude, low projection and low perceived pressure) and contrasted sharply with a more positive estimate of their implicit doping attitude. Conclusions/Significance Hair analysis for performance enhancing substances has shown considerable potential in validating athletes' doping attitude estimations and admissions of use. Results not only confirm the need for improved self-report methodology for future research in socially-sensitive domains but also indicate where the improvements are likely to come from: as chemical validation remains expensive, a more realistic promise for large scale studies and online data collection efforts is held by measures of implicit social cognition."

https://openalex.org/W1970933681,"Background Saccharomyces yeasts are an important model system in many areas of biological research. Very little is known about their ecology and evolution in the wild, but interest in this natural history is growing. Extensive work with lab strains in the last century uncovered the Saccharomyces life cycle. When nutrient limited, a diploid yeast cell will form four haploid spores encased in a protective outer layer called the ascus. Confinement within the ascus is thought to enforce mating between products of the same meiotic division, minimizing outcrossing in this stage of the life cycle. Methodology/Principal Findings Using a set of S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus strains isolated from woodlands in North America, we set up trials in which pairs of asci were placed in contact with one another and allowed to germinate. We observed outcrossing in ∼40% of the trials, and multiple outcrossing events in trials with three asci in contact with each other. When entire populations of densely crowded asci germinated, ∼10–25% of the resulting colonies were outcrossed. There were differences between the species with S. cerevisiae having an increased tendency to outcross in mass mating conditions. Conclusions/Significance Our results highlight the potential for random mating between spores in natural strains, even in the presence of asci. If this type of mating does occur in nature and it is between close relatives, then a great deal of mating behavior may be undetectable from genome sequences."

https://openalex.org/W2098764985,"Neuronal function in the brain requires energy in the form of ATP, and mitochondria are canonically associated with ATP production in neurons. The electrochemical gradient, which underlies the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ΔΨmem), is harnessed for ATP generation. Here we show that ΔΨmem and ATP-production can be engaged in mitochondria isolated from human brains up to 8.5 h postmortem. Also, a time course of postmortem intervals from 0 to 24 h using mitochondria isolated from mouse cortex reveals that ΔΨmem in mitochondria can be reconstituted beyond 10 h postmortem. It was found that complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain was affected adversely with increasing postmortem intervals. Mitochondria isolated from postmortem mouse brains maintain the ability to produce ATP, but rates of production decreased with longer postmortem intervals. Furthermore, we show that postmortem brain mitochondria retain their ΔΨmem and ATP-production capacities following cryopreservation. Our finding that ΔΨmem and ATP-generating capacity can be reinitiated in brain mitochondria hours after death indicates that human postmortem brains can be an abundant source of viable mitochondria to study metabolic processes in health and disease.

https://openalex.org/W2111661887,"Background Several authors, most prominently Jared Diamond (1997, Guns, Germs and Steel), have investigated biogeographic determinants of human history and civilization. The timing of the transition to an agricultural lifestyle, associated with steep population growth and consequent societal change, has been suggested to be affected by the availability of suitable organisms for domestication. These factors were shown to quantitatively explain some of the current global inequalities of economy and political power. Here, we advance this approach one step further by looking at climate and soil as sole determining factors. Methodology/Principal Findings As a simplistic ‘null model’, we assume that only climate and soil conditions affect the suitability of four basic landuse types – agriculture, sedentary animal husbandry, nomadic pastoralism and hunting-and-gathering. Using ecological niche modelling (ENM), we derive spatial predictions of the suitability for these four landuse traits and apply these to the Old World and Australia. We explore two aspects of the properties of these predictions, conflict potential and population density. In a calculation of overlap of landuse suitability, we map regions of potential conflict between landuse types. Results are congruent with a number of real, present or historical, regions of conflict between ethnic groups associated with different landuse traditions. Furthermore, we found that our model of agricultural suitability explains a considerable portion of population density variability. We mapped residuals from this correlation, finding geographically highly structured deviations that invite further investigation. We also found that ENM of agricultural suitability correlates with a metric of local wealth generation (Gross Domestic Product, Purchasing Power Parity). Conclusions/Significance From simplified assumptions on the links between climate, soil and landuse we are able to provide good predictions on complex features of human geography. The spatial distribution of deviations from ENM predictions identifies those regions requiring further investigation of potential explanations. Our findings and methodological approaches may be of applied interest, e.g., in the context of climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2008462557,"HIV-1 entry into host cells is mediated by the sequential binding of the envelope glycoprotein gp120 to CD4 and a chemokine receptor. Antibodies binding to epitopes overlapping the CD4-binding site on gp120 are potent inhibitors of HIV entry, such as the llama heavy chain antibody fragment VHH D7, which has cross-clade neutralizing properties and competes with CD4 and mAb b12 for high affinity binding to gp120. We report the crystal structure of the D7 VHH at 1.5 Å resolution, which reveals the molecular details of the complementarity determining regions (CDR) and substantial flexibility of CDR3 that could facilitate an induced fit interaction with gp120. Structural comparison of CDRs from other CD4 binding site antibodies suggests diverse modes of interaction. Mutational analysis identified CDR3 as a key component of gp120 interaction as determined by surface plasmon resonance. A decrease in affinity is directly coupled to the neutralization efficiency since mutations that decrease gp120 interaction increase the IC50 required for HIV-1 IIIB neutralization. Thus the structural study identifies the long CDR3 of D7 as the key determinant of interaction and HIV-1 neutralization. Furthermore, our data confirm that the structural plasticity of gp120 can accommodate multiple modes of antibody binding within the CD4 binding site."
https://openalex.org/W2064955207,"Background Raf kinase inhibitory protein (RKIP), also known as phoshaptidylethanolamine binding protein (PEBP), has been shown to inhibit Raf and thereby negatively regulate growth factor signaling by the Raf/MAP kinase pathway. RKIP has also been shown to suppress metastasis. We have previously demonstrated that RKIP/Raf interaction is regulated by two mechanisms: phosphorylation of RKIP at Ser-153, and occupation of RKIP's conserved ligand binding domain with a phospholipid (2-dihexanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine; DHPE). In addition to phospholipids, other ligands have been reported to bind this domain; however their binding properties remain uncharacterized. Methods/Findings In this study, we used high-resolution heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy to screen a chemical library and assay a number of potential RKIP ligands for binding to the protein. Surprisingly, many compounds previously postulated as RKIP ligands showed no detectable binding in near-physiological solution conditions even at millimolar concentrations. In contrast, we found three novel ligands for RKIP that specifically bind to the RKIP pocket. Interestingly, unlike the phospholipid, DHPE, these newly identified ligands did not affect RKIP binding to Raf-1 or RKIP phosphorylation. One out of the three ligands displayed off target biological effects, impairing EGF-induced MAPK and metabolic activity. Conclusions/Significance This work defines the binding properties of RKIP ligands under near physiological conditions, establishing RKIP's affinity for hydrophobic ligands and the importance of bulky aliphatic chains for inhibiting its function. The common structural elements of these compounds defines a minimal requirement for RKIP binding and thus they can be used as lead compounds for future design of RKIP ligands with therapeutic potential."

The purpose of this study is to investigate the prevalence of HCV antibodies (anti-HCV) in patients with HIV, the proportion and correlates of infection by different HCV genotypes, and rates of spontaneous resolution of HCV infection.A cross-sectional study was conducted among 1143 HIV patients under follow-up in a HIV/AIDS outpatient reference center of the Brazilian public health system. From 357 anti-HCV positive patients, a consecutive sample of 227 individuals HCV treatment-naïve was interviewed and 207 was tested for HCV-RNA and genotypes.Anti-HCV was detected in 357 patients (31.2%). HCV-RNA was undetectable in 16.4% of 207 anti-HCV positive individuals. Genotype 1 was diagnosed in 81.5% of the sample, genotype 2 in 1.7% and genotype 3 in 16.2%. Male gender was the unique characteristic associated with higher prevalence of genotype 1 HCV.Co-infection by HCV is frequent among patients with HIV in our State, and it is particularly high the infection by HCV genotype 1. Further investigation is necessary to explain the important regional variation in the proportion of infection by the different HCV genotypes and to better understand rates of spontaneous HCV clearance."

A covalent, but transient, bond between heme and a conserved histidine in CcmE along with an interaction between CcmH and the apocytochrome have been previously indicated as core aspects of the Ccm system. Here, we show that in the Ccm system from Desulfovibrio desulfuricans, no CcmH is required, and the holo-CcmE covalent bond occurs via a cysteine residue. These observations call for reconsideration of the accepted models of System I-mediated c-type cytochrome biogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2051774124,"Mutations that diminish the function of the extracellular matrix receptor Dystroglycan (DG) result in muscular dystrophies, with associated neuronal migration defects in the brain and mental retardation e.g. Muscle Eye Brain Disease. To gain insight into the function of DG in the nervous system we initiated a study to examine its contribution to development of the eye of Drosophila melanogaster. Immuno-histochemistry showed that DG is concentrated on the apical surface of photoreceptors (R) cells during specification of cell-fate in the third instar larva and is maintained at this location through early pupal stages. In point mutations that are null for DG we see abortive R cell elongation during differentiation that first appears in the pupa and results in stunted R cells in the adult. Overexpression of DG in R cells results in a small but significant increase in their size. R cell differentiation defects appear at the same stage in a deficiency line Df(2R)Dg248 that affects Dg and the neighboring mitochondrial ribosomal gene, mRpL34. In the adult, these flies have severely disrupted R cells as well as defects in the lens and ommatidia. Expression of an mRpL34 transgene rescues much of this phenotype. We conclude that DG does not affect neuronal commitment but functions R cell autonomously to regulate neuronal elongation during differentiation in the pupa. We discuss these findings in view of recent work implicating DG as a regulator of cell metabolism and its genetic interaction with mRpL34, a member of a class of mitochondrial genes essential for normal metabolic function."
https://openalex.org/W2114251011,"Human perception of ambiguous sensory signals is biased by prior experiences. It is not known how such prior information is encoded, retrieved and combined with sensory information by neurons. Previous authors have suggested dynamic encoding mechanisms for prior information, whereby top-down modulation of firing patterns on a trial-by-trial basis creates short-term representations of priors. Although such a mechanism may well account for perceptual bias arising in the short-term, it does not account for the often irreversible and robust changes in perception that result from long-term, developmental experience. Based on the finding that more frequently experienced stimuli gain greater representations in sensory cortices during development, we reasoned that prior information could be stored in the size of cortical sensory representations. For the case of auditory perception, we use a computational model to show that prior information about sound frequency distributions may be stored in the size of primary auditory cortex frequency representations, read-out by elevated baseline activity in all neurons and combined with sensory-evoked activity to generate a perception that conforms to Bayesian integration theory. Our results suggest an alternative neural mechanism for experience-induced long-term perceptual bias in the context of auditory perception. They make the testable prediction that the extent of such perceptual prior bias is modulated by both the degree of cortical reorganization and the magnitude of spontaneous activity in primary auditory cortex. Given that cortical over-representation of frequently experienced stimuli, as well as perceptual bias towards such stimuli is a common phenomenon across sensory modalities, our model may generalize to sensory perception, rather than being specific to auditory perception."
https://openalex.org/W1991301739,"Protein fold recognition usually relies on a statistical model of each fold; each model is constructed from an ensemble of natural sequences belonging to that fold. A complementary strategy may be to employ sequence ensembles produced by computational protein design. Designed sequences can be more diverse than natural sequences, possibly avoiding some limitations of experimental databases.WE EXPLORE THIS STRATEGY FOR FOUR SCOP FAMILIES: Small Kunitz-type inhibitors (SKIs), Interleukin-8 chemokines, PDZ domains, and large Caspase catalytic subunits, represented by 43 structures. An automated procedure is used to redesign the 43 proteins. We use the experimental backbones as fixed templates in the folded state and a molecular mechanics model to compute the interaction energies between sidechain and backbone groups. Calculations are done with the Proteins@Home volunteer computing platform. A heuristic algorithm is used to scan the sequence and conformational space, yielding 200,000-300,000 sequences per backbone template. The results confirm and generalize our earlier study of SH2 and SH3 domains. The designed sequences ressemble moderately-distant, natural homologues of the initial templates; e.g., the SUPERFAMILY, profile Hidden-Markov Model library recognizes 85% of the low-energy sequences as native-like. Conversely, Position Specific Scoring Matrices derived from the sequences can be used to detect natural homologues within the SwissProt database: 60% of known PDZ domains are detected and around 90% of known SKIs and chemokines. Energy components and inter-residue correlations are analyzed and ways to improve the method are discussed.For some families, designed sequences can be a useful complement to experimental ones for homologue searching. However, improved tools are needed to extract more information from the designed profiles before the method can be of general use."
https://openalex.org/W2074533826,"Interferon beta (IFNβ) is the most common immunomodulatory treatment for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). However, some patients fail to respond to treatment. In this study, we identified putative clinical response markers in the serum and plasma of people with multiple sclerosis (MS) treated with IFNβ. In a discovery-driven approach, we use 2D-difference gel electrophoresis (DIGE) to identify putative clinical response markers and apply power calculations to identify the sample size required to further validate those markers. In the process we have optimized a DIGE protocol for plasma to obtain cost effective and high resolution gels for effective spot comparison. APOA1, A2M, and FIBB were identified as putative clinical response markers. Power calculations showed that the current DIGE experiment requires a minimum of 10 samples from each group to be confident of 1.5 fold difference at the p<0.05 significance level. In a complementary targeted approach, Cytometric Beadarray (CBA) analysis showed no significant difference in the serum concentration of IL-6, IL-8, MIG, Eotaxin, IP-10, MCP-1, and MIP-1α, between clinical responders and non-responders, despite the association of these proteins with IFNβ treatment in MS."
https://openalex.org/W2095488104,"It has been long appreciated that speciation involves changes in body plans and establishes genetic, reproductive, developmental and behavioral incompatibilities between populations. However, little is still known about the genetic components involved in these changes or the sequence and scale of events that lead to the differentiation of species.In this paper, we investigated the genetic changes in three closely related species of Drosophila by making pair-wise comparisons of their genomes. We focused our analysis on the modern relatives of the alleles likely to be segregating in pre-historic populations at the time or after the ancestor of D. simulans became separated from the ancestor of D. melanogaster. Some of these genes were previously implicated in the genetics of reproduction and behavior while the biological functions of others are not yet clear.Together these results identify different classes of genes that might have participated in the beginning of segregation of these species millions of years ago in Africa."
https://openalex.org/W1969086192,"The neuronal mechanisms for ordering sensory signals in time still need to be clarified despite a long history of research. To address this issue, we recently developed a behavioral task of temporal order judgment in mice. In the present study, we examined the expression of c-Fos, a marker of neural activation, in mice just after they carried out the temporal order judgment task. The expression of c-Fos was examined in C57BL/6N mice (male, n = 5) that were trained to judge the order of two air-puff stimuli delivered bilaterally to the right and left whiskers with stimulation intervals of 50–750 ms. The mice were rewarded with a food pellet when they responded by orienting their head toward the first stimulus (n = 2) or toward the second stimulus (n = 3) after a visual “go” signal. c-Fos-stained cell densities of these mice (test group) were compared with those of two control groups in coronal brain sections prepared at bregma −2, −1, 0, +1, and +2 mm by applying statistical parametric mapping to the c-Fos immuno-stained sections. The expression of c-Fos was significantly higher in the test group than in the other groups in the bilateral barrel fields of the primary somatosensory cortex, the left secondary somatosensory cortex, the dorsal part of the right secondary auditory cortex. Laminar analyses in the primary somatosensory cortex revealed that c-Fos expression in the test group was most evident in layers II and III, where callosal fibers project. The results suggest that temporal order judgment involves processing bilateral somatosensory signals through the supragranular layers of the primary sensory cortex and in the multimodal sensory areas, including marginal zone between the primary somatosensory cortex and the secondary sensory cortex."
https://openalex.org/W1981388138,"The Green River Formation (early Eocene, about 42-53 Ma) at and near Fossil Butte National Monument in Wyoming, USA, is world famous for its exquisitely preserved freshwater teleost fish in the former Fossil Lake. Nonetheless, trace fossils attributed to fish interacting with the lake bottom are apparently rare, and have not been associated directly with any fish species. Here we interpret the first known feeding and swimming trace fossil of the teleost Notogoneus osculus Cope (Teleostei: Gonorynchidae), which is also represented as a body fossil in the same stratum.A standard description of the trace fossil, identified as Undichna cf. U. simplicatas, was augmented by high-resolution digital images and spatial and mathematical analyses, which allowed for detailed interpretations of the anatomy, swimming mode, feeding behavior, and body size of the tracemaker. Our analysis indicates that the tracemaker was about 45 cm long; used its caudal, anal, and pelvic fins (the posterior half of its body) to make the swimming traces; and used a ventrally oriented mouth to make overlapping feeding marks. We hypothesize that the tracemaker was an adult Notogoneus osculus.Our results are the first to link a specific teleost tracemaker with a trace fossil from the Green River Formation, while also interpreting the size and relative age of the tracemaker. The normal feeding and swimming behaviors indicated by the trace fossil indicate temporarily oxygenated benthic conditions in the deepest part of Fossil Lake, counter to most paleoecological interpretations of this deposit. Lastly, our spatial and mathematical analyses significantly update and advance previous approaches to the study of teleost trace fossils."
https://openalex.org/W2013278666,"Eukaryotic pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) are receptors activated by neurotransmitters to rapidly transport ions across cell membranes, down their electrochemical gradients. Recent crystal structures of two prokaryotic pLGICs were interpreted to imply that the extracellular side of the transmembrane pore constricts to close the channel (Hilf, R. J., and Dutzler, R.

Here, we utilized a eukaryotic acetylcholine (ACh)-serotonin chimeric pLGIC that was engineered with histidines to coordinate a metal ion within the channel pore, at its cytoplasmic side. In a previous study, the access of Zn2+ ions to the engineered histidines had been explored when the channel was either at rest (closed) or active (open) (Paas, Y., Gibor, G., Grailhe, R., Savatier-Duclert, N., Dufresne, V., Sunesen, M., de Carvalho, L.

In this study, the interactions of Zn2+ with the pore were probed upon agonist (ACh) dissociation that triggers the transition of the receptor from the active conformation to the resting conformation (i.e. during deactivation). Application of Zn2+ onto ACh-bound open receptors obstructed their pore and prevented ionic flow. Removing ACh from its extracellular binding sites to trigger deactivation while Zn2+ is still bound led to tight trapping of Zn2+ within the pore. Together with single-channel recordings, made to explore single pore-blocking events, we show that dissociation of ACh causes the gate to shut on a Zn2+ ion that effectively acts as a “foot in the door.” We infer that, upon deactivation, the cytoplasmic side of the pore of the ACh-serotonin receptor chimera constricts to close the channel.

For recordings, HEK-293T cells were seeded on glass coverslips (13-mm diameter) that had been coated with poly-l-lysine (20 μg/ml). Coverslips were placed in 35-mm plates, and the cells were transfected (by the calcium phosphate technique) with pIRES-CD8 (0.5 μg), as a marker for successful transfection, together with the pcDNA3-receptor (1.5 μg) per plate. Transfected cells were visualized using beads coated with anti-CD8 antibodies (Invitrogen). Recordings were performed 48–72 h following transfection.

The patch pipettes were prepared from borosilicate glass (Warner Instrument Corp.) using a PC-10 puller (NARISHIGE Group). The electrodes were coated with Sylgard to reduce pipette capacitance, and their resistance was 6–10 megohms when filled with the pipette solution. The bath solution contained (in mm) the following: 140 NaCl, 2.8 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 10 glucose, 10 HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.35 with NaOH (310 mosm). The pipette solution contained (in mm) the following: 1 ACh, 140 sodium isethionate, 2.8 KCl, 10 glucose, 10 HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.35 with NaOH (310 mosm). Zinc acetate (10 μm) was added to the pipette solution whenever the effect of Zn2+ was examined. Single-channel currents were recorded using an Axopatch 200B patch clamp amplifier and a Digidata 1440A interface (Molecular Devices). Acquisition of recording data were performed at 10 kHz, and recordings were low-pass filtered at 1 kHz through a four-pole Bessel filter on the Axopatch 200B amplifier. Data acquisition and analysis were performed using the pClamp 10.0 software package (Molecular Devices). Single-channel events were detected by the half-amplitude threshold criterion using the Clampfit 10.0 program implemented within pClamp 10.0. The distributions of open and closed times were fitted with a single or two exponentials. Single-channel current amplitudes were measured as the mean of a Gaussian distribution fitted to the amplitude distribution. Measurements of macroscopic currents were performed basically as in Sunesen et al. (34Sunesen M. de Carvalho L.P. Dufresne V. Grailhe R. Savatier-Duclert N. Gibor G. Peretz A. Attali B. Changeux J.P.

The bath solution contained (in mm) the following: 140 NaCl, 2.8 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 10 glucose, 10 HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.35 with NaOH. Patch pipettes had 6–10 megohm resistance when filled with a solution containing (in mm) the following: 130 CsCl, 4 MgCl2, 4 Na2ATP, 1 EGTA, 10 HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.35 with CsOH. ACh was applied onto the cell by using the VC-77SP fast step system (Warner Instruments) combined with N2 pressure of 3–4 p.s.i. An oligomeric model of the LigBD of chimera H-5′ was built by using the carbachol-liganded ACh-binding protein (35Celie P.H. van Rossum-Fikkert S.E. van Dijk W.J. Brejc K. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Neuron. 2004; 41: 907-914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar) (AChBP, Protein Data Bank code 1UV6) as a quaternary structure template. To this end, the N-terminal sequence of the chimeric subunit was threaded throughout the atomic coordinates of each AChBP chain, according to the sequence alignment shown in supplemental Fig. S1. The resulting three-dimensional alignment was submitted for oligomeric modeling to the SWISS-MODEL Repository, a data base for theoretical protein models. After energy minimization with GROMOS96, the best three-dimensional structural alignment between the pentameric LigBD and the AChBP gave a root mean square difference of 0.38 Å for 3880 backbone atoms of 970 counterpart amino acids. Note that the modeled LigBD and the AChBP have 1030 and 1025 amino acids, respectively. Thus, 60 amino acids from the LigBD and 55 amino acids from the AChBP are not included in this root mean square difference calculation. The final model was then docked onto the structural model previously published for the transmembrane channel domain of chimera H-5′ (21Paas Y. Gibor G. Grailhe R. Savatier-Duclert N. Dufresne V. Sunesen M. de Carvalho L.P. Changeux J.P. Attali B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 15877-15882Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Hence, the backbone carbon atom (C′) of Arg-206 of each LigBD subunit was positioned 1.35 Å away from the backbone nitrogen atom of Pro-207 of the counterpart subunit in the channel domain (see supplemental Fig. S1 for amino acid numbers). The backbone was then ligated in silico to obtain an oligomeric receptor-channel structure, and energy minimization was performed once again with GROMOS96. No clashes have been observed between amino acids or between the backbone and amino acids, within the individual subunits or at the intersubunit interfaces. The models of the closed and open conformations built by Paas et al. (21Paas Y. Gibor G. Grailhe R. Savatier-Duclert N. Dufresne V. Sunesen M. de Carvalho L.P. Changeux J.P. Attali B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 15877-15882Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) were used for Zn2+ docking. Data analysis and computation relating to dissociation constants, EC50 values, and Hill coefficients were carried out using GraphPad Prism. In the case of 3H-αBTx binding assays, curves were fitted to the data points by a nonlinear regression using Equation 1, where B is the bound 3H-αBTx; Bmax is the maximal binding of 3H-αBTx; [3H-αBTx] is the concentration of radiolabeled toxin; and KD is the dissociation constant, which equals the concentration of toxin required to reach half-maximal binding. In the case of inhibition of 3H-αBTx binding by small agonists (ACh or nicotine), curves were fitted to the data points by a nonlinear regression using the Hill Equation 2, where B is the bound [3H]α-BTx; Bmax is the maximal binding of [3H]α-BTx; Ki is the agonist inhibition constant; [agonist] is the ACh or nicotine concentration and nH is the Hill coefficient. In activation experiments where EC50 values were determined electrophysiologically, curves were fitted to the data points by a nonlinear regression using the Hill Equation 3, where I is the current response; Imax is the maximal current response; EC50 is the agonist concentration necessary to obtain 50% of maximal current response; [agonist] is the ACh concentration, and nH is the Hill coefficient. For the two-state allosteric model, Equation 4 was used, where Factive is the fraction of the total receptor population in the active state; [ACh] is the concentration of the activator (ACh) for which there are “n” equivalent binding sites, each binds ACh with a microscopic dissociation constant KDr in the resting state, and KDa in the active state. L is the equilibrium constant of the two states in the absence of ACh; it is equal to the total resting/active receptor ratio. The L value was determined based on functional experiments, as described in the legend to supplemental Fig. S2, E–H. Note that Equation 4 is equivalent to Equation 1 in Ref. 36Karlin A. J. Theor. Biol. 1967; 16: 306-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, where the resting state is called the “T” state and the active state is called the “R” state. To determine the activation time constants, the current rise of the traces (like those shown in FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5) was best fitted with a single exponential time course by using Equation 5, where A is the current amplitude; t is the time; τ is the time constant, and C is the constant y offset.FIGURE 4Blocking of open channels by Zn2+ in a reversible manner. A and B, indicated chimeric receptors (expressed in Xenopus oocytes) are activated by saturating concentrations of ACh (300 μm) for 9 s. 3 s after onset of activation, 1 mm Zn2+ is added for 6 s to block the open channels (left side of the red traces). Then, following a 6-s-long wash of both ACh and Zn2+ simultaneously (1st red wash), the chimeras were reactivated with ACh (300 μm; 2nd red ACh) for 3 s, and washed again (2nd red wash). The black traces are unblocked currents activated by 300 μm ACh for 9 s; they show the maximal nondesensitizing current amplitudes. Recordings were performed at−80 mV and room temperature.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 5Induction of receptor deactivation in the presence of Zn2+ ions. A, six representative current episodes recorded from Xenopus oocytes expressing chimera H-5′ are lined up vertically. The 1st episode corresponds to activation by a saturating ACh concentration (300 μm) for 9 s, which shows the maximal nondesensitizing current amplitude. Dashed line shows the base line. 2nd to 6th episodes show application of an ACh-containing solution (300 μm) for 3 s, which was replaced by a solution that contains both ACh (300 μm) and Zn2+ (1 mm) for a further 6 s. The addition of Zn2+ led to inhibition of the steady-state current (decline to point a). Then, the solution containing both ACh and Zn2+ was replaced by a solution containing 1 mm Zn2+ without ACh, for further 6-s-long application to remove ACh while leaving Zn2+ in the application bath. This step led to further decline of the current to the base line (point b) and then to the inhibition of the leak current (from b to c). The oocyte was then washed with a physiological solution devoid of both ACh and Zn2+ for varying time periods (under 1st wash); within this washing time, the current trace returned from point c to the base line. Then, ACh (300 μm) was reapplied for 3 s (under 2nd ACh), followed by a second wash. Note that after each 60-s-long episode, the oocyte was briefly stimulated for a few times by ACh alone (and washed) until the maximal (primary) amplitude recovered. Recordings were performed at −80 mV at room temperature. B, same as in A but with a glycine-containing control chimera (G-5′). C, histograms of experiments performed as in A and B. Shown are percentages of current recovery (after the indicated washing times) of the chimeras as follows: H-5′ (left, black columns), G-5′ (left, gray columns), H-2′ (right, black columns), and G-2′ (right, gray columns). The recovery of the H-5′ channels significantly differs from that of the G-5′ channels; for 6, 8, 10, and 12 s of wash, p < 0.0001; for a 30-s wash of H-5′ compared with a 12-s wash of G-5′, p < 0.0007 (N = 5). The recovery of the H-2′ channels significantly differs from that of the G-2′ channels: for a 6- and 12-s wash, p < 0.0001 (N = 5).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The zinc association rate constant shown in Scheme 1 (see text) was calculated according to the explanation provided under “Results” (under “Single-Channel Recordings Show Fast and Slow Zn2+-blocking Events”), as in Equation 6, Unless stated otherwise, p values correspond to two-tailed paired t tests. The following methods are provided in the supplemental material under supplemental Experimental Procedures: Chimeras and Mutants, Transfection of Cultured Cells and Cell Harvesting, Membrane Preparation, Ligand Binding Assays, and Electrophysiology in Xenopus Oocytes. The receptors employed here assemble as homopentamers, and each subunit is a fusion polypeptide that consists of the extracellular N-terminal segment of the nAChR α7 subunit fused to the transmembrane and intracellular C-terminal segment of the serotonin receptor 5HT3A subunit (37Eiselé J.L. Bertrand S. Galzi J.L. Devillers-Thiéry A. Changeux J.P. Bertrand D. Nature. 1993; 366: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Therefore, this chimeric α7–5HT3AR responds to ACh, which binds to the LigBD to open a channel of a serotonin receptor. The chimeric α7–5HT3AR was further mutated as follows. (i) Following Dang et al. (38Dang H. England P.M. Farivar S.S. Dougherty D.A. Lester H.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 1114-1122PubMed Google Scholar), a V13′T mutation was introduced in the M2 pore-lining segment to eliminate the desensitization capacity of the chimera. (ii) The M1-M2 connecting sequence was replaced by the homologous sequence of the β subunit of the Caenorhabditis elegans glutamate-gated ion channel (21Paas Y. Gibor G. Grailhe R. Savatier-Duclert N. Dufresne V. Sunesen M. de Carvalho L.P. Changeux J.P. Attali B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 15877-15882Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A homology model of this chimera (H-5′) is shown in Fig. 1A. The replacement of the M1-M2 sequence resulted in a histidine residue at position −5′; thus, upon receptor assembly, five histidines have become organized around the ion permeation pathway (Fig. 1B) (21Paas Y. Gibor G. Grailhe R. Savatier-Duclert N. Dufresne V. Sunesen M. de Carvalho L.P. Changeux J.P. Attali B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 15877-15882Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Note that the replacement of the M1-M2 segment also removed a glutamate residue from position −1′, because the replacing M1-M2 segment naturally contains a glycine residue at this position (Fig. 1C). As such, the negatively charged ring at position −1′ was neutralized and could not serve as a potential metal-binding site, whereas the cytoplasmic (bottom) side of the ion channel pore has been equipped with a metal-binding ring consisting of five imidazole groups. Moving the histidine downstream, along the replacing M1-M2 segment, provided a metal-binding ring slightly higher in the pore (chimera H-2′) (Fig. 1, B and C, and Fig. 6, right side). We further designed control mutants that contain the aforementioned changes, with one exception being a glycine instead of a histidine at either position −5′ (chimera G-5′) or position −2′ (chimera G-2′) (Fig. 1C). We have used these Gly-containing control chimeras to determine whether the effects of Zn2+ are specific to the presence of the engineered histidines. In a previous article, Paas et al. (21Paas Y. Gibor G. Grailhe R. Savatier-Duclert N. Dufresne V. Sunesen M. de Carvalho L.P. Changeux J.P. Attali B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 15877-15882Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) determined the capacity of the aforementioned chimeras to interact with Zn2+ ions before and after activation. For clarity, supplemental Fig. S2, A and B, shows again the dose-dependent inhibitory effect that externally applied Zn2+ ions have on the open state of chimeras H-5′ and H-2′, respectively. The Zn2+ inhibition constants (Ki) at −80 mV were (in μm) as follows: 30 ± 4.8 and 80 ± 12 (mean ± S.D., N = 8 and 6) for chimeras H-5′ and H-2′, respectively (21Paas Y. Gibor G. Grailhe R. Savatier-Duclert N. Dufresne V. Sunesen M. de Carvalho L.P. Changeux J.P. Attali B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 15877-15882Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The supplemental Fig. S2, C and D, shows that the glycine-containing control chimeras, G-5′ and G-2′, were inhibited to much lesser extent (inhibition of 27 ± 2% and 19 ± 5.6% at 1 mm Zn2+ (mean ± S.D., N = 5 and 4), respectively (21Paas Y. Gibor G. Grailhe R. Savatier-Duclert N. Dufresne V. Sunesen M. de Carvalho L.P. Changeux J.P. Attali B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 15877-15882Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar)). We do not know what is the origin of this weak inhibition; however, we do not exclude a weak inhibitory effect by Zn2+ interacting with the LigBD. Indeed, it was recently shown that a pentameric glycine-gated ion channel is strongly inhibited by Zn2+ that binds to the underlined amino acids of the HFHEIT sequence in the LigBD (39Miller P.S. Topf M. Smart T.G. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 1084-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Notably, at the homologous positions of the nAChR-α7 subunit (the donor of the LigBD in our chimeras), there are four side chains that could potentially interact with divalent metal cations (RFDATF; see sequence alignment in Ref. 40Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar). In any event, based on supplemental Fig. S2, A–D, and other results by Paas et al. (21Paas Y. Gibor G. Grailhe R. Savatier-Duclert N. Dufresne V. Sunesen M. de Carvalho L.P. Changeux J.P. Attali B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 15877-15882Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), it was concluded: (i) in the open conformation, a ring of five histidines at either position −5′ or −2′ is accessible for interactions with externally applied Zn2+ ions, and"
