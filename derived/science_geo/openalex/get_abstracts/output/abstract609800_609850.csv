https://openalex.org/W2801527818,"Human hematopoiesis involves cellular differentiation of multipotent cells into progressively more lineage-restricted states. While the chromatin accessibility landscape of this process has been explored in defined populations, single-cell regulatory variation has been hidden by ensemble averaging. We collected single-cell chromatin accessibility profiles across 10 populations of immunophenotypically defined human hematopoietic cell types and constructed a chromatin accessibility landscape of human hematopoiesis to characterize differentiation trajectories. We find variation consistent with lineage bias toward different developmental branches in multipotent cell types. We observe heterogeneity within common myeloid progenitors (CMPs) and granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMPs) and develop a strategy to partition GMPs along their differentiation trajectory. Furthermore, we integrated single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to associate transcription factors to chromatin accessibility changes and regulatory elements to target genes through correlations of expression and regulatory element accessibility. Overall, this work provides a framework for integrative exploration of complex regulatory dynamics in a primary human tissue at single-cell resolution."

Innate immune system can sense the invading pathogens via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to initiate efficient innate response for the elimination of the pathogens (Hajishengallis and Lambris, 2011Hajishengallis G.

As the most extensively studied PRR for recognition of RNA virus, retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I) has been shown to recognize viral RNAs in the cytoplasm and trigger innate immune response through the production of type I interferons (IFNs) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (Chen et al., 2013Chen W.

Immunol. 2004; 5: 730-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (3102) Google Scholar). It is well known that PRR-triggered overproduction of type I IFNs may lead to inflammatory autoimmune diseases (Cao, 2016Cao X. Self-regulation and cross-regulation of pattern-recognition receptor signalling in health and disease.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2016; 16: 35-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it is observed that RIG-I, as one of the interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), can be significantly upregulated by type I IFNs and other innate stimuli and remains present for an extended period of time (Kim et al., 2008Kim M.J. Hwang S.Y. Imaizumi T. Yoo J.Y. Negative feedback regulation of RIG-I-mediated antiviral signaling by interferon-induced ISG15 conjugation.J. Virol. 2008; 82: 1474-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The function of the relatively long-lasting RIG-I must therefore be precisely tuned, especially at late stage of the innate response when innate cytokines including type I IFNs start to disappear. However, the mechanism by which RIG-I activation for innate cytokine induction is efficiently terminated is still largely unknown. The ability of RIG-I to act as innate RNA sensor to discriminate “nonself” viral RNAs from “self” RNA has been identified. When viral infection produces pathogenic RNAs that bind to the basic cleft of RIG-I C-terminal domain (CTD) in the presence of ATP, RIG-I changes to an “open” structure with exposing the CARDs from an inhibitory association with the helicase domain (Kowalinski et al., 2011Kowalinski E. Lunardi T. McCarthy A.A. Louber J. Brunel J. Grigorov B. Gerlier D. Cusack S. Structural basis for the activation of innate immune pattern-recognition receptor RIG-I by viral RNA.Cell. 2011; 147: 423-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). The released CARDs mediate downstream signaling for activation of innate response (Gack et al., 2007Gack M.U. Shin Y.C. Joo C.H. Urano T. Liang C. Sun L. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Chen Z. Inoue S.

However, whether RIG-I can physiologically bind self RNA and its functional importance remain unknown. Over the past years, a number of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as important regulatory molecules in various physiological and pathological processes by binding to specific proteins. Recently, high-throughput sequencing of immunoprecipitated RNAs after cross-linking (CLIP-seq) identified 21,073 and 1,662 RNA-binding protein (RBP)-lncRNA interactions in human and mouse, respectively (Li et al., 2015Li J.H. Liu S. Zheng L.L. Wu J. Sun W.J. Wang Z.L. Zhou H. Qu L.H. Yang J.H. Discovery of protein-lncRNA interactions by integrating large-scale CLIP-Seq and RNA-Seq datasets.Front. Bioeng. Biotechnol. 2015; 2: 88Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, the biological significance and the underlying mechanisms for the interaction of lncRNAs with RBPs in the immunity and inflammation remain to be further investigated. The increasing evidence for the RBP-lncRNA interactions in association with protein functions inspired us to ask whether RIG-I can bind to “self” cellular lncRNAs, and if so, what is the biological function and importance of such self-recognition in maintaining immune homeostasis by feedback restricting or timely terminating RIG-I recognition of “non-self” RNA-induced innate inflammatory response? To identify potential RIG-I-associated host lncRNAs, we performed UV cross-linking and RNA immunoprecipitation (UV-RIP) assay using an anti-Flag antibody in the mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cell line stably expressing Flag-tagged RIG-I, infected with or without RNA virus vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). The co-purified RNAs were analyzed using Illumina short-read sequencing (UV-RIP-seq, GSE106254). RIG-I-interacting lncRNAs in VSV-infected macrophages with the highest abundance were ranked and shown in Figure 1A and Table S1 (including 30 lncRNAs in NONCODE database). We then constructed a library consisting of small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting these lncRNAs to identify the functions of these RIG-I-associated self-RNAs. Preliminary screening indicated that knockdown of lncRNA NONMMUT057981 (original ID in NONCODE v4.0) significantly increased VSV-induced IFN-β production in mouse peritoneal macrophages. Of note, lncRNA NONMMUT057981 was the fourth most abundant RIG-I-binding lncRNA in VSV-infected macrophages but did not bind to RIG-I in the uninfected cells, suggesting it might be involved in RIG-I-mediated antiviral innate immune response. The coverage tracks from the UV-RIP-seq showed that the RIG-I-bound RNA covered partial NONMMUT057981 sequence (chromosome 6, nucleotides 91, 516, 046-91, 517, 771 in NONCODE V4.0), containing partial sequences of Lsm3 introns and exons (Figure 1B). The lncRNA sequence was verified by long-read PacBio’s SMRT sequencing from RIP sample obtained by using an anti-RIG-I antibody in RAW264.7 cells upon VSV infection (Figure 1B) (RIP-seq, GSE106254). Interestingly, by 5′ and 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and PacBio long-read sequencing (GSE106254) of total RNA from mouse peritoneal macrophages, we discovered two splice transcript variants from Lsm3 loci. Variant 1 (termed lnc-Lsm3a) (chromosome 6, nucleotides 91, 516, 035-91, 517, 771, total 1,737 nt) contains exons 1, exon 2, intron 1, and a fragment of intron 2 of the Lsm3 gene. Variant 2 (termed lnc-Lsm3b) (total 768 nt), which can bind RIG-I, lacks the intron 1 as compared to lnc-Lsm3a (Figure S1A; Table S2). To confirm the relationship between these two splice variant transcripts, we compared their locations and expressions. When visualized with Stellaris FISH probes, probes to intron 1 or intron 3 revealed signals in the nucleus, whereas probes to intron 2 of Lsm3 showed enrichment in cytoplasmic fractions with a few foci colocalizing with probes to intron 1 or intron 3 in nucleus (Figure S1B), supporting the view that lnc-Lsm3b is mainly localized in the cytoplasm. In addition, both splicing variants were transcribed from lnc-Lsm3a in HEK293T cells that were transfected with a vector expressing lnc-Lsm3a, but the level of lnc-Lsm3b was significantly higher than that of lnc-Lsm3a (Figure S1C). A splice site mutation at intron 1 of lnc-Lsm3a (lnc-Lsm3a mutant) led to lnc-Lsm3a-only expression (Figure S1C). These results suggest that lnc-Lsm3a is a lnc-Lsm3b precursor, and lnc-Lsm3b is the sole mature lncRNA at the Lsm3 locus. qPCR showed that the expression of lnc-Lsm3b was significantly upregulated upon RNA virus infection (VSV or Sendai virus [(SeV]) (Figure 1C) or 5′ppp-double stranded RNA (dsRNA) transfection (Figure S2A) in a time-dependent manner. Absolute copy-number analysis revealed that lnc-Lsm3b was present at a low level of 30 molecules per uninfected peritoneal macrophage, and increased to ∼250 copies upon VSV infection for 16 hr (Figure S2B), which was as abundant as other lncRNAs (Atianand et al., 2016Atianand M.K.

A long noncoding RNA associated with susceptibility to celiac disease.Science. 2016; 352: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Notably, viral infection-induced expression of lnc-Lsm3b and Lsm3 was completely abolished in peritoneal macrophages derived from Ifnar-deficient (Ifnar−/−) mice (Figures 1D and S2C), indicating that type I IFNs induced the expression of the two transcripts. However, we found that only stimulating with high concentration of type I IFNs for a relative long duration (at least 6 hr) could significantly induce lnc-Lsm3b expression (Figures S2D and S2E). Correspondingly, lnc-Lsm3b promoter (∼2,000 bp upstream of the ATG initiation codon of the mouse Lsm3 gene) could be activated by high concentration of type I IFNs in L929 cells (Figure 1E). Other innate stimuli, including DNA virus herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), bacteria Listeria monocytogenes (L.M), E. coli 0111:B4 (E.coli), various TLR ligands such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), poly(I:C), CpG ODN, and STING ligand (cGAMP) could also induce lnc-Lsm3b expression in a time-dependent manner (Figure S2A). However, these innate stimuli did not induce as much type I IFNs as RNA virus did; accordingly, the fold changes of lnc-Lsm3b expression induced by these innate stimuli were less than what the RNA virus induced. These data suggest lnc-Lsm3b is an interferon-induced lncRNA, although not very reactive. We further determined whether lnc-Lsm3b was specifically bound to RIG-I in macrophages upon viral infection. Consistent with the result of RIP-seq, RIP-qPCR assay also revealed that the binding of lnc-Lsm3b to RIG-I increased in a time-dependent manner in RAW264.7 cells after VSV infection. Surprisingly, lnc-Lsm3b was extremely abundant at 8 hr and 12 hr in RIG-I IP (Figure 1F). RNA pull-down assay also showed that lnc-Lsm3b was bound to the purified RIG-I protein (Figure 1G). We then examined the subcellular localization of lnc-Lsm3b in macrophages by RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). In the resting cells, probes to intron 2 of Lsm3 (the signal in the cytoplasm is mainly lnc-Lsm3b) exhibited punctuate staining in both nuclear and cytosolic compartments of macrophages, whereas the number of the speckles increased significantly from 8 hr to 16 hr in the cytoplasm after VSV infection (Figure 1H), which was further confirmed by qPCR on lnc-Lsm3b from cytosolic fractions (Figure 1I). In addition, VSV-induced lnc-Lsm3b was colocalized with RIG-I in the cytoplasm (Figure 1H). Besides macrophages, lnc-Lsm3b was found to be widely expressed in multiple types of immune cells and organs (Figure S2F). Bioinformatics analysis (Tsai et al., 2010Tsai M.C. Manor O. Wan Y. Mosammaparast N. Wang J.K. Lan F. Shi Y. Segal E. Chang H.Y. Long noncoding RNA as modular scaffold of histone modification complexes.Science. 2010; 329: 689-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (2593) Google Scholar) confirmed lnc-Lsm3b had no coding capability (Figure S2G). Coding substitution frequencies predicted that most of the potential open reading frames (ORFs) of lnc-Lsm3b were negative/low protein-coding potential (Figure S2H). We also detected the protein-coding capacity of lnc-Lsm3b by ribosome sedimentation (Carpenter et al., 2013Carpenter S. Aiello D. Atianand M.K. Ricci E.P. Gandhi P. Hall L.L. Byron M. Monks B. Henry-Bezy M. Lawrence J.B. et al.A long noncoding RNA mediates both activation and repression of immune response genes.Science. 2013; 341: 789-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar), which demonstrated that lnc-Lsm3b could not associate with polysomes and then encode a protein product, thereby being a non-coding RNA (Figure S2I). To evaluate the function of lnc-Lsm3b in antiviral innate immune response, we designed siRNA targeting intron 2 of lnc-Lsm3b (si-lnc-Lsm3b) (Figure S3A). qPCR confirmed that si-lnc-Lsm3b significantly decreased the expression of lnc-Lsm3b (Figure S3B) but did not alter Lsm3 gene expression (Figure S3C). Knockdown of lnc-Lsm3b acted to significantly increase the production of type I IFNs and proinflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-6 in macrophages upon infection with VSV or SeV but not DNA virus HSV-1 (Figures 2A–2C). These data indicate that the endogenous lnc-Lsm3b may act as a potent negative regulator of RIG-I activation in the induction of type I IFNs and proinflammatory cytokine.Figure 2lnc-Lsm3b Inhibits RIG-I-Mediated Signaling in RNA Virus-Infected MacrophagesShow full caption(A–C) ELISA of IFN-α (A), IFN-β (B), and IL-6 (C) in the supernatants of peritoneal macrophages transfected with si-ctrl or si-lnc-Lsm3b for 48 hr before VSV, SeV, or HSV-1 infection for 16 hr.(D–F) ELISA of IFN-α (D), IFN-β (E), and IL-6 (F) in supernatants of lnc-Lsm3b+/+ and lnc-Lsm3b−/− cells infected with VSV for indicated hours.(G and H) IFN-β (G) and NF-κB (H) promoter activity in HEK293T cells transfected with lnc-Lsm3b and RIG-I vectors upon VSV infection.(I) VSV titers by TCID50 assay in supernatants of lnc-Lsm3b+/+ and lnc-Lsm3b−/− cells infected with VSV for 12 hr and 24 hr.(J) Immunoblot analysis of RIG-I signaling pathways in lnc-Lsm3b+/+ and lnc-Lsm3b−/− cells infected with VSV for indicated hours.

Furthermore, we generated lnc-Lsm3b-deficient (lnc-Lsm3b−/−) RAW264.7 cells, lacking a 435 bp genomic region at 3′ end of lnc-Lsm3b (Figure S3A), which did not express lnc-Lsm3b (Figure S3D) and had no effects on the expression of Lsm3, Rig-i (Figure S3E), as well as other neighboring genes (Tmem43, Wnt7a, Slc6a6, Klf15, Prickle2, and Xpc) (Figure S3F). Upon RNA viral challenge, lnc-Lsm3b−/− cells produced more IFN-α and IFN-β than lnc-Lsm3b+/+ cells (Figures 2D and 2E), and the difference was more evident at 12–20 hr after viral infection. Moreover, lnc-Lsm3b could inhibit virus-induced IFN-β and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) promoter activity (Figures 2G and 2H). Correspondingly, the replication of VSV was reduced more significantly in lnc-Lsm3b−/− cells than that in lnc-Lsm3b+/+ cells at 12 or 24 hr post-infection (Figure 2I). We further found that the phosphorylation levels of IRF3 (p-IRF3) and NF-κB signaling (p-p65 and p-IKKα/β) were significantly higher in lnc-Lsm3b−/− cells than lnc-Lsm3b+/+ cells during 8–16 hr after VSV infection (Figure 2J). However, the inhibition of IRF3 signaling by lnc-Lsm3b was more significant than the inhibition of NF-κB signaling, consistent with a previous study showing that VSV infection is a weak NF-κB inducer (Cui et al., 2010Cui J.

NLRC5 negatively regulates the NF-kappaB and type I interferon signaling pathways.Cell. 2010; 141: 483-496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). These data suggest that lnc-Lsm3b effectively suppresses RIG-I-triggered type I IFN production at late stage of antiviral response, unlike other negative regulators to suppress RIG-I-triggered signaling at early stage of antiviral response (Chen et al., 2013Chen W. Han C. Xie B. Hu X. Yu Q. Shi L. Wang Q. Li D. Wang J.

To further determine whether lnc-Lsm3b is important for host innate immune response against virus infection, we generated lnc-Lsm3b-deficient mice (lnc-Lsm3b−/−, deletion of the same region as in lnc-Lsm3b−/− RAW264.7 cells). We infected lnc-Lsm3b−/− mice with a high dose of VSV via tail intravenous (i.v.) injection and found lnc-Lsm3b−/− mice were significantly less susceptible to VSV-induced lethality than lnc-Lsm3b+/+ mice (Figure 3A). When challenged with a moderate dose of VSV, lnc-Lsm3b−/− mice produced significantly higher type I IFNs (IFN-α and IFN-β) in sera at 18 hr or 24 hr after infection than lnc-Lsm3b+/+ mice (Figure 3B). Consistent with the more potent antiviral effect of higher IFNs, the viral burden was significantly reduced in lnc-Lsm3b−/− mice (Figure 3C), and accordingly, the severity of pulmonary inflammation was significantly reduced (Figure 3D). After infection, the levels of Ifn-α4 and Ifn-β mRNA were also significantly higher in tissues of lnc-Lsm3b−/− mice than that of lnc-Lsm3b+/+ mice (Figures 3E and S4A). Notably, the expression of lnc-Lsm3b increased in a time-dependent manner in lnc-Lsm3b+/+ mice after infection (Figure 3F), which was opposite to the decreasing trends of IFNs expression at 18 hr and 20 hr upon VSV infection.Figure S4Deficiency of lnc-Lsm3b in Mice Leads to More Type I IFNs Production, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) qPCR analysis of Ifn-α4 expression in organs (liver, lung and spleen) from lnc-Lsm3b+/+ and lnc-Lsm3b−/− mice after VSV infection via tail intravenous injection (i.v.).(B) ELISA of the production of IFN-β and IL-6 in sera from lnc-Lsm3b+/+ and lnc-Lsm3b−/− mice (n = 3) at 36 hr after intranasal injection with influenza virus (100 pfu per mouse).(C) qPCR analysis of Ifn-β and IL-6 in the lungs of mice from (B).(D) ELISA of the production of IFN-β and IL-6 in sera from lnc-Lsm3b+/+ and lnc-Lsm3b−/− mice (n = 3) at 18 hr after i.v. injection with HSV-1 virus (1 × 107 pfu/g).(E) qPCR analysis of Ifn-β and IL-6 in organs (liver, lung and spleen) of mice from (D).

We also infected lnc-Lsm3b−/− mice with another RNA virus influenza virus strain A/Puerto Rico/8/1981 H1N1 (PR8) through intranasal infection and DNA virus HSV-1 via i.v. injection. As expected, lnc-Lsm3b−/− mice produced higher levels of IFN-β and IL-6 in serum and lung than control mice in response to infection with influenza (Figures S4B and S4C). However, there was no difference of IFN-β or IL-6 production between two groups infected with HSV-1 (Figures S4D and S4E). Taken together, these data suggest that lnc-Lsm3b effectively inhibits RIG-I-triggered antiviral signaling cascades at the late stage of antiviral response. We then investigated how lnc-Lsm3b effectively suppressed RIG-I activation at late innate immune response. We found that the pattern of type I IFN expression and the level of p-IRF3 (rapid increase and then sharply decrease) did not correlate with the continuing increase of RIG-I protein expression in macrophages upon RNA virus infection during a period of 24 hr (Figure 4A and S5A), which was also observed in previous studies (Kim et al., 2008Kim M.J. Hwang S.Y. Imaizumi T. Yoo J.Y. Negative feedback regulation of RIG-I-mediated antiviral signaling by interferon-induced ISG15 conjugation.J. Virol. 2008; 82: 1474-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The decreased interaction of RIG-I and TRIM25 further confirmed that RIG-I protein induced by IFNs at the late stage of antiviral response lost the activity of mediating downstream signaling (Figure 4A). Thus, we wondered whether the binding of lnc-Lsm3b to RIG-I could restrict RIG-I protein conformation shift, thus making RIG-I lose TRIM25 binding ability, CARD ubiquitination, and then prevent the formation of active RIG-I oligomers at the late stage of antiviral response.Figure S5lnc-Lsm3b Competes with Viral RNA to Bind CTD of RIG-I, Related to Figure 4Show full caption(A) Dynamic analysis of type I IFNs mRNA expression, protein expression of RIG-I and p-IRF3 in SeV-infected mouse peritoneal macrophages for indicated hours (the relative protein levels were determined using the ImageJ program).(B) RNA pull-down analysis of the binding of biotinylated lnc-Lsm3b (5 pmol) to Myc-RIG-I protein (extracted from transfected HEK293T cells) by adding increasing amounts of VSV RNA (extracted from VSV-infected HEK293T cells) (competitor) to the reaction mix.(C) IFN-β promoter activity in HEK293T cells transfected with lnc-Lsm3b together with full-length RIG-I (25 ng), RIG-I-CARDs (25 ng) or RIG-I CARD-hel (100 ng).

We first determined the regions of RIG-I binding to lnc-Lsm3b. In vitro RNA pull-down assay showed that lnc-Lsm3b bound to CTD and helicase domain of RIG-I (Figure 4B). However, we noticed that the isolated helicase domain was the truncation mutant removing both CARD and CTD domain (RIG-I 235-735), which is kept in a flexible open conformation and exposed multipartite RNA-binding sites. When lnc-Lsm3b bound to RIG-I, RIG-I was in an auto-repressed form and partial RNA-binding sites in helicase domain was hidden by the interaction of CARD. To further estimate whether lnc-Lsm3b had the ability to bind helicase domain in auto-repressed form, we constructed C-terminal truncation in the pincer-CTD linker to remove the CTD domain (RIG-I 1-797, denoted deltaCTD), whic"

Here, we used quantitative mass spectrometry to systematically analyze the thermal stability and solubility of proteins on a proteome-wide scale during the eukaryotic cell cycle. We demonstrate pervasive variation of these biophysical parameters with most changes occurring in mitosis and G1. Various cellular pathways and components vary in thermal stability, such as cell-cycle factors, polymerases, and chromatin remodelers. We demonstrate that protein thermal stability serves as a proxy for enzyme activity, DNA binding, and complex formation in situ. Strikingly, a large cohort of intrinsically disordered and mitotically phosphorylated proteins is stabilized and solubilized in mitosis, suggesting a fundamental remodeling of the biophysical environment of the mitotic cell. Our data represent a rich resource for cell, structural, and systems biologists interested in proteome regulation during biological transitions."

However, expression levels alone only give a partial view of the biochemical processes determining cellular events. Using a proteome-wide implementation of the cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) to study specific cell-cycle phases, we uncover changes of interaction states for more than 750 proteins during the cell cycle. Notably, many protein complexes are modulated in specific cell-cycle phases, reflecting their roles in processes such as DNA replication, chromatin remodeling, transcription, translation, and disintegration of the nuclear envelope. Surprisingly, only small differences in the interaction states were seen between the G1 and the G2 phase, suggesting similar hardwiring of biochemical processes in these two phases. The present work reveals novel molecular details of the cell cycle and establishes proteome-wide CETSA as a new strategy to study modulation of protein-interaction states in intact cells."

https://openalex.org/W2799277391,"How signaling molecules achieve signal diversity and specificity is a long-standing cell biology question. Here we report the development of a targeted delivery method that permits specific expression of homologous Ras-family small GTPases (i.e., Ras, Rap2, and Rap1) in different subcellular microdomains, including the endoplasmic reticulum, lipid rafts, bulk membrane, lysosomes, and Golgi complex, in rodent hippocampal CA1 neurons. The microdomain-targeted delivery, combined with multicolor fluorescence protein tagging and high-resolution dual-quintuple simultaneous patch-clamp recordings, allows systematic analysis of microdomain-specific signaling. The analysis shows that Ras signals long-term potentiation via endoplasmic reticulum PI3K and lipid raft ERK, whereas Rap2 and Rap1 signal depotentiation and long-term depression via bulk membrane JNK and lysosome p38MAPK, respectively. These results establish an effective subcellular microdomain-specific targeted delivery method and unveil subcellular microdomain-specific signaling as the mechanism for homologous Ras and Rap to achieve signal diversity and specificity to control multiple forms of synaptic plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2800241970,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive and an incurable type of brain cancer. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) DNA and encoded proteins, including the chemokine receptor US28, have been detected in GBM tumors. US28 displays constitutive activity and is able to bind several human chemokines, leading to the activation of various proliferative and inflammatory signaling pathways. Here we show that HCMV, through the expression of US28, significantly enhanced the growth of 3D spheroids of U251- and neurospheres of primary glioblastoma cells. Moreover, US28 expression accelerated the growth of glioblastoma cells in an orthotopic intracranial GBM-model in mice. We developed highly potent and selective US28-targeting nanobodies, which bind to the extracellular domain of US28 and detect US28 in GBM tissue. The nanobodies inhibited chemokine binding and reduced the constitutive US28-mediated signaling with nanomolar potencies and significantly impaired HCMV/US28-mediated tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. This study emphasizes the oncomodulatory role of HCMV-encoded US28 and provides a potential therapeutic approach for HCMV-positive tumors using the nanobody technology."

Decisions take time because the information needed to make them is rarely available all at once but must be gathered sequentially. A large literature, whose beginnings stretch back to the 19th century (Donders, 1869Donders F.C. Over de snelheid van psychologische processen.Acta Psychol. (Amst.). 1869; 4: 117-145Google Scholar), documents systematic variations in the speed of perceptual judgments with stimulus strength: easy decisions, based on unambiguous evidence, tend to be fast, whereas difficult decisions, based on weak or conflicting data, tend to be slow (Hanes and Schall, 1996Hanes D.P.

Evidence for an accumulator model of psychophysical discrimination.Ergonomics. 1970; 13: 37-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). This difficulty-dependent cost of decision time likely reflects the need to construct time-averaged sensory representations. Just as engineers average signals over time to reduce the effects of contaminating noise, the brain appears to improve its signal-to-noise ratio by integrating information from sequential samples. The neural structures and mechanisms responsible for the execution and termination of this integration process remain incompletely understood (Gold and Shadlen, 2007Gold J.I. Shadlen M.N.

From first principles, accumulating information must be encoded in time-varying neural signals that span the evidence-gathering period. Smooth ramps or discrete steps in firing frequency or domino-like activity sequences, which can all be observed before choices are made, have been interpreted to represent these signals (Gold and Shadlen, 2007Gold J.I.

The decision is considered complete when the mean spike rate in the population crosses a threshold or the activity sequence joins a choice-specific trajectory. However, there is little evidence that changing the slope of a ramp or the order or speed at which activity propagates through a sequence alters decision times. And although mechanisms for producing the requisite spiking dynamics have been advanced theoretically (Rajan et al., 2016Rajan K. Harvey C.D. Tank D.W.

Like mammals, fruit flies take longer to commit to difficult perceptual choices than to easy ones (DasGupta et al., 2014DasGupta S. Ferreira C.H. Miesenböck G.

USA. 1995; 92: 930-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Drosophila FoxP mutants are slower to make difficult odor intensity discriminations than wild-type flies, and, in some allelic combinations, are also more error prone (DasGupta et al., 2014DasGupta S. Ferreira C.H. Miesenböck G. FoxP influences the speed and accuracy of a perceptual decision in Drosophila.Science. 2014; 344: 901-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Here, we study the mechanism of sequential sampling through the prism of the FoxP mutation: we identify how FoxP shapes the integrative capabilities of αβc KCs and relate these capabilities to the decision-making behavior of the animal. The single FoxP gene of Drosophila consists of six constitutively and two alternatively spliced exons that give rise to a minimum of two transcripts (RC and RD) and corresponding protein isoforms (Santos et al., 2011Santos M.E. Athanasiadis A. Leitão A.B. DuPasquier L. Sucena E. Alternative splicing and gene duplication in the evolution of the FoxP gene subfamily.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2011; 28: 237-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) (Figure 1A). The two isoforms share an N-terminal zinc finger domain but possess different C-terminal forkhead domains. The transposable element insertion sites of mutant FoxP alleles associated with reaction time phenotypes (DasGupta et al., 2014DasGupta S. Ferreira C.H. Miesenböck G.

FoxP-RC mRNA levels were greatly reduced in homozygous FoxP5-SZ-3955 mutants and flies expressing NP7175-GAL4-driven hairpin RNA directed against the FoxP transcript (FoxPRNAi) (Figure 1B). α’β’ neurons, which lie outside the FoxP-GAL4 expression domain (DasGupta et al., 2014DasGupta S.

For an initial determination of whether and how FoxP regulates the function of neurons that express this transcription factor, we targeted the Ca2+ indicator GCaMP6m to FoxP-positive αβc or FoxP-negative α’β’ KCs and imaged Ca2+ transients evoked by electrical stimulation of the ipsilateral antennal nerve (Figures 1C–1E and S2). Electrical instead of odor stimulation allowed us to recruit many glomerular channels simultaneously and activate KCs broadly rather than in sparse odor-specific ensembles whose membership varies unpredictably from fly to fly (Caron et al., 2013Caron S.J.C.

The dendritic and axonal compartments of both types of KC responded in a saturating fashion to stimulus trains of increasing frequency, but the response amplitudes of FoxP-negative α’β’ cells increased more steeply and leveled off at lower stimulation intensities than those of FoxP-positive αβc KCs (Figures 1E and 1F). Mutating FoxP flattened the stimulus-response curves of αβc KCs and caused them to saturate at reduced plateaux (Figures 1E and 1F). Because the responses of α’β’ neurons were unaffected in mutants (Figure 1F), the overall organization and strength of inputs from olfactory projection neurons, which are thought to be shared among all classes of KC (Caron et al., 2013Caron S.J.C.

Changes specific to the FoxP-positive αβc KCs must therefore lie at the root of the selective response attenuation of these cells. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in vivo (Figure 2A) supported this conclusion. αβc KCs of wild-type flies, homozygous FoxP5-SZ-3955 mutants, and flies expressing FoxPRNAi under NP7175-GAL4 control rested—the marginal hyperpolarization of FoxP-deficient neurons notwithstanding—at broadly similar membrane potentials (Figure 2B) and received synaptic inputs at comparable basal rates (Figure S3A); these inputs gave rise to the same average excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) at a holding potential of –90 mV (Figures S3B–S3D). Regardless of genotype, action potentials were initiated at similar voltages during steps or ramps of depolarizing currents (Figures 2C–2F), but the lower input resistances (Figure 2G) and shorter membrane time constants (Figure 2H) of FoxP-deficient neurons meant that larger currents were required to bring these cells to threshold (Figures 2C and 2F). Because the necessary current amplitudes were reached later during depolarizing ramps (Figure 2C), the spike latencies of FoxP-deficient neurons exceeded those of wild-type cells (Figure 2E).Figure S3FoxP Does Not Regulate Synaptic Transmission to αβc KCs, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Example transmembrane currents (left, holding potential –90 mV) and mean frequency of spontaneous EPSCs (right) of αβc KCs in wild-type flies (black), homozygous FoxP5-SZ-3955 mutants (red), or flies expressing NP7175-GAL4-driven FoxPRNAi (blue).

In 5 αβc KCs of wild-type flies, 1 αβc KC of a FoxP5-SZ-3955 mutant, and 1 αβc KC of a FoxPRNAi fly, a satisfactory single-exponential fit to the decaying phase of the EPSP could not be found; these cells were excluded from the analyis of τdecay in (I). In contrast to the characteristic quiescence of αβc KCs at rest, many FoxP-negative α’β’ KCs (Figure 2J) were spontaneously active at similar membrane potential baselines (Figure 2K), reflecting their lower action potential thresholds (Figures 2L–2O). α’β’ KCs had lower input resistances and shorter membrane time constants than αβc KCs (Figures 2O–2Q) and transduced depolarizing current steps nearly linearly into proportional spike rate increases (Figure 2R), whereas αβc KCs followed sigmoidal current-spike frequency functions (Figure 2I). As would be expected for FoxP-negative neurons (Figure 1B), none of the biophysical characteristics of α’β’ KCs were perturbed after interference with the expression of FoxP, be it ubiquitously through mutation or in an α’β’ KC-restricted manner through VT030604-GAL4-driven FoxPRNAi (Figures 2K–2R). The identical spike thresholds of wild-type and FoxP-deficient αβc KCs (Figure 2D) argue against a role of FoxP in regulating voltage-gated sodium or calcium channels, which shape the upstroke of the action potential. Subtle changes in the action potential waveform during repolarization (Figure S3E) and the prolonged latency to spiking during current ramps (Figures 2C and 2E) instead hint at augmented potassium currents in FoxP-deficient αβc KCs. Voltage-clamp measurements and gene expression analyses confirmed this notion. αβc KCs expressed a prominent voltage-dependent A-type potassium current (Figures 3A–3C) with half-activation and half-inactivation voltages at steady state of –20.3 ± 1.6 mV and –72.9 ± 1.2 mV, respectively (Figures 3C and 3D), and an inactivation time constant of 37.2 ± 2.4 ms at +50 mV (Figures S4A and S4B). The loss of FoxP nearly doubled the membrane density of this current (Figures 3A–3C) while leaving unchanged its steady-state activation and inactivation curves (Figure 3D). FoxP thus appears to control the cell surface density of the pore-forming α subunit of a voltage-gated potassium (KV) channel and not the level of an accessory protein that influences the channel’s gating.Figure S4A-Type Potassium Currents of αβc KCs Show Inactivation Kinetics and Toxin Sensitivities Characteristic of Shal, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Exponential fits (solid lines) to average A-type potassium currents (shaded lines) evoked by stepping αβc KCs of wild-type flies (black), homozygous FoxP5-SZ-3955 mutants (red), or flies expressing NP7175-GAL4-driven FoxPRNAi (blue) from a holding potential of –100 mV to the indicated probe potentials.(B) Inactivation time constants τ of IA in αβc KCs of wild-type flies (black), homozygous FoxP5-SZ-3955 mutants (red), or flies expressing NP7175-GAL4-driven FoxPRNAi (blue) as functions of voltage.

https://openalex.org/W2800931065,"Neurons in piriform cortex receive input from a random collection of glomeruli, resulting in odor representations that lack the stereotypic organization of the olfactory bulb. We have performed in vivo optical imaging and mathematical modeling to demonstrate that correlations are retained in the transformation from bulb to piriform cortex, a feature essential for generalization across odors. Random connectivity also implies that the piriform representation of a given odor will differ among different individuals and across brain hemispheres in a single individual. We show that these different representations can nevertheless support consistent agreement about odor quality across a range of odors. Our model also demonstrates that, whereas odor discrimination and categorization require far fewer neurons than reside in piriform cortex, consistent generalization may require the full complement of piriform neurons."

The synaptic effects of 5-HT signaling at thalamostriatal inputs provide insights into how changes in serotonergic levels associated with behavioral states or pathology affect striatal-dependent processes. The dorsal striatum (DS) of the basal ganglia (BG) plays a critical role in voluntary movement, learning, and motivation. It also represents the primary site of dysfunction in psychomotor diseases such as Parkinson’s disease (PD), drug addiction, and obsessive-compulsive disorders (OCDs). The DS receives glutamatergic excitatory inputs from the cortex and thalamus. These inputs converge on striatal projection neurons (SPNs) of the direct (dSPN) and indirect (iSPN) pathways, which exert opposing control over motor output and hedonic states. While dSPNs stimulate movement, reinforcement, and reward, iSPNs inhibit movement and mediate punishment and aversion (Kravitz et al., 2010Kravitz A.V. Freeze B.S. Parker P.R. Kay K. Thwin M.T.

It is increasingly clear that encoding of action selection at striatal circuits requires regulation of SPN activity and plasticity (Kravitz et al., 2012Kravitz A.V. Tye L.D. Kreitzer A.C.

While the neuromodulatory signaling mechanisms controlling iSPN synaptic plasticity, especially long-term-depression (LTD), have been studied extensively, identifying parallel mechanisms in dSPNs has proven more difficult (Zhai et al., 2018Zhai S. Tanimura A. Graves S.M. Shen W. Surmeier D.J. Striatal synapses, circuits, and Parkinson’s disease.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2018; 48: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). One of the most important neuromodulatory inputs to the striatum is dense dopaminergic innervation from the substantia nigra (Tritsch and Sabatini 2012Tritsch N.X. Sabatini B.L. Dopaminergic modulation of synaptic transmission in cortex and striatum.Neuron. 2012; 76: 33-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). In particular, dSPNs expressing the Gs-coupled D1 dopamine (DA) receptors (D1R) are stimulated by dopaminergic signaling. In the presence of behaviorally relevant stimuli, DA is thought to reinforce motor actions that result in reward outcomes through the potentiation of corticostriatal synapses formed on dSPNs. Recent evidence indicates that DA depletion specifically weakens thalamic connections to dSPNs, but not to cortical afferents to these neurons (Parker et al., 2016Parker P.R. Lalive A.L. Kreitzer A.C. Pathway-Specific Remodeling of Thalamostriatal Synapses in Parkinsonian Mice.Neuron. 2016; 89: 734-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This weakening, which does not occur in iSPNs, is directly associated with motor abnormalities. In addition to dopaminergic afferents, serotonergic inputs from the medial and dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) modulate the activity of SPNs, affecting striatal function and consequently behaviors, including motor and motivational goal-directed behavior (Mathur and Lovinger, 2012Mathur B.N. Lovinger D.M. Serotonergic action on dorsal striatal function.Parkinsonism Relat. Disord. 2012; 18: S129-S131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Serotonergic neurons of the DRN fire coincidently with the initiation and termination of selected voluntary movements, whereas reduction in DRN activity to baseline or below is associated with pauses in motor sequences (Fornal et al., 1996Fornal C.A. Metzler C.W. Marrosu F. Ribiero-do-Valle L.E. Jacobs B.L.

Fornal C.A. Activity of serotonergic neurons in behaving animals.Neuropsychopharmacology. 1999; 21: 9S-15SCrossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The evidence that striatal serotonin (5-HT) influences action control is consistent with the dysfunction of the 5-HT system described in OCD and with the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for treatment of this disorder (Goddard et al., 2008Goddard A.W. Shekhar A. Whiteman A.F. McDougle C.J. Serotoninergic mechanisms in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder.Drug Discov. Today. 2008; 13: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In the DS, 5-HT acts on diverse receptors on both presynaptic and postsynaptic circuit elements (Mathur and Lovinger, 2012Mathur B.N. Lovinger D.M. Serotonergic action on dorsal striatal function.Parkinsonism Relat. Disord. 2012; 18: S129-S131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Depending on their localization, striatal 5-HT receptors initiate transduction through several Gi/o-, Gq/11-, and Gs protein-dependent and -independent pathways (Hannon and Hoyer, 2008Hannon J. Hoyer D. Molecular biology of 5-HT receptors.Behav. Brain Res. 2008; 195: 198-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). The specific responses to 5-HT may also be contingent upon crosstalk with other receptor types. In dSPNs, the temporal, combinational logic of serotonergic and D1R-mediated signaling may shape the net synaptic output, depending on the relative balance of these two neuromodulators. It has been reported that increased concentrations of 5-HT in the striatum reduce glutamate release at corticostriatal afferents by activating presynaptic Gi-coupled 5-HT1b receptors (Mathur et al., 2011Mathur B.N. Capik N.A. Alvarez V.A. Lovinger D.M. Serotonin induces long-term depression at corticostriatal synapses.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 7402-7411Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). 5-HT can also facilitate the release of DA from dopaminergic projections (Navailles and De Deurwaerdère, 2011Navailles S. De Deurwaerdère P. Presynaptic control of serotonin on striatal dopamine function.Psychopharmacology (Berl.). 2011; 213: 213-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Despite their potential implications for BG function and for pathological conditions characterized by hypo-serotonergic states, the synaptic effects of reduced striatal 5-HT signaling remain unexplored. Neither is it known whether there is any input specificity for 5-HT modulation at corticostriatal and thalamostriatal synapses. In the current study, we investigated the effect of impeding 5-HT release, and thereby serotonergic signaling, on timing-dependent synaptic plasticity in dSPNs. This allowed us to describe cellular mechanisms underlying the input-specific impact of 5-HT at thalamostriatal synapses. To determine how plasticity is modulated at glutamatergic inputs on dSPNs of the dorsolateral striatum (DLS), we recorded excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) following intrastriatal stimulation. Intrastriatal stimulation likely activates cortical and thalamic afferents as well as dopaminergic and serotonergic fibers (Figure 1) (Shen et al., 2015Shen W. Plotkin J.L. Francardo V. Ko W.K.

Previous studies show that this STDP protocol leads to long-term synaptic depression (t-LTD) in dSPNs when either D1R is inhibited or striatal DA is depleted (Shen et al., 2008Shen W. Flajolet M.

The effects of decreased 5-HT signaling at glutamatergic dSPN synapses during STDP remain to be determined, however. To address the role of 5-HT, we manipulated its release chemogenetically. We used a newly generated transgenic DREADD (designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs) mouse line (hM4Di+/−/Pet1210-Cre) obtained by crossing the Pet1210-Cre transgenic mice (Pelosi et al., 2014Pelosi B. Migliarini S. Pacini G. Pratelli M. Pasqualetti M. Generation of Pet1210-Cre transgenic mouse line reveals non-serotonergic expression domains of Pet1 both in CNS and periphery.PLoS ONE. 2014; 9: e104318Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) with hM4Di knockin mice expressing the DREADD hM4Di receptor (hM4DiR) fused in-frame with the mCherry reporter and flanked by two sets of Lox sites (i.e., LoxP/Lox2722) (Figure S1A). Upon Cre-mediated somatic recombination, the double-floxed DREADD sequence is effectively inverted, leading to transcription of the inhibitory hM4DiR in Pet1210-expressing 5-HT neurons. In brain slices from hM4Di+/−/Pet1210-Cre mice, these neurons and their projections can be identified by the expression of the mCherry reporter (Figures S1B and S2A–S2L). We first confirmed that the hM4DiR silenced serotonergic neurons of the DRN when activated by its cognate ligand clozapine-N-oxide (CNO; Figures S1C–S1F). Bath application of CNO (5 μM) significantly decreased the firing discharge of mCherrypositive, but not mCherrynegative, neurons (Figures S1D and S1E). CNO did not affect the firing rate of DRN 5-HT neurons from hM4Di+/− littermates negative for Pet1210-Cre (Pet1210-Cre0; Figure S1F). mCherry- and 5-HT co-immunoreactivity was verified in the DLS of hM4Di+/−/Pet1210-Cre mice by immunoelectron microscopy (Figures S2M–S2O). We also confirmed the chemogenetic synaptic silencing of 5-HT release by in vivo 5-HT microdialysis in the DLS of freely moving hM4Di+/−/Petl210-Cre mice and their control littermates (Figure S3A). In hM4Di+/−/Pet1210-Cre mice, high K+ (120 mM) infusion in the DLS induced reliable 5-HT release from serotonergic terminals; the stimulatory effect of a second high K+ challenge was blunted by the intrastriatal infusion of CNO (5 μM; p < 0.01; Figure S3B). CNO did not affect K+-evoked release of 5-HT when infused in control mice (p > 0.05; Figure S3C). These controls indicate that this model can be used to effectively silence the synaptic release of 5-HT in the DLS. We assessed whether 5-HT synaptic silencing in the DLS affects plasticity outcomes by CNO application in hM4Di+/−/Pet1210-Cre mice (Figure 1). In dSPNs from these mice, t-LTD occurred in the presence of CNO, but not in the control (5 μM; 74% ± 4% of baseline, n = 8, p < 0.05 versus 95% ± 5% of baseline, n = 5, p > 0.05; Figure 1C). There were no changes in synaptic responses when CNO was applied during a burst pattern of back propagating action potentials (bAPs) (94% ± 7% of baseline, n = 5, p > 0.05) or in the absence of the STDP protocol (93% ± 3% of baseline, n = 8, p > 0.05; Figure S4A). Further, CNO had no effect when applied during the post-pre STDP paradigm in naive mice (92% ± 6% of baseline, n = 7, p > 0.05; Figure S4B). These results indicate that the chemogenetic inhibition of 5-HT release in the DLS gates t-LTD at glutamatergic afferents to dSPNs. Our findings indicate that 5-HT, similar to DA through the Gs-coupled D1R (Shen et al., 2008Shen W. Flajolet M. Greengard P. Surmeier D.J. Dichotomous dopaminergic control of striatal synaptic plasticity.Science. 2008; 321: 848-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar), disrupts the induction of t-LTD in dSPNs. To elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying this role, we tested whether inhibiting 5-HT Gs-mediated signaling allows t-LTD to occur. The striatum contains a high density of the 5-HT6R and 5-HT4R subtypes, which, like D1R, are coupled to Gs and are expressed in SPNs (Di Matteo et al., 2008Di Matteo V. Pierucci M. Esposito E. Crescimanno G. Benigno A. Di Giovanni G. Serotonin modulation of the basal ganglia circuitry: therapeutic implication for Parkinson’s disease and other motor disorders.Prog. Brain Res. 2008; 172: 423-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Bath perfusion of the 5-HT6R antagonist SB271046 (5 μM) during the post-pre protocol did not promote plasticity in dSPNs (99% ± 8% of baseline, n = 6, p > 0.05; Figure S4C). In contrast, delivering the post-pre STDP paradigm in the presence of the 5-HT4R antagonists GR113808 (5 μM) or RS39604 (5 μM) revealed t-LTD in the same neuronal subpopulation (GR113808, 79% ± 5% of baseline, n = 8, p < 0.05; RS39604, 68% ± 4% of baseline, n = 10, p < 0.05; Figure 2A). Thus, 5-HT4R inhibition recapitulates the synaptic effects of chemogenetic inhibition of 5-HT release. Application of either antagonist in the absence of the pairing protocol did not affect glutamatergic synaptic transmission (GR113808, 94% ± 5% of baseline, n = 5, p > 0.05; RS39604, 96% ± 4% of baseline, n = 6, p > 0.05; Figure S4D), confirming that coordinated postsynaptic and presynaptic activity is necessary for the induction of t-LTD. Previous studies demonstrated that in dSPNs, antagonism of the Gs-coupled D1R signaling allows endocannabinoid (eCB) biosynthesis, ultimately leading to LTD mediated by activation of the presynaptic cannabinoid receptor CB1 (Shen et al., 2008Shen W. Flajolet M. Greengard P. Surmeier D.J.

However, this was not the putative mechanism for antagonism of 5-HT4R signaling, as the co-application of RS39604 with the CB1R antagonist AM251 (4 μM) did not prevent t-LTD induction (RS39604 + AM251, 62% ± 7% of baseline, n = 5, p < 0.05; Figure 2B). We next investigated the locus of plasticity expression by recording synaptic responses generated by twin stimuli, before and after the STDP protocol. In this set of experiments, we found that t-LTD was enabled by antagonism of 5-HT4R (RS39604, 77% ± 5% of baseline, n = 6, p < 0.05; Figure 2C) but was not accompanied by a change in paired-pulse ratio (PPR), a hallmark of presynaptic plasticity (PPR, beforeSTDP, 1.33 ± 0.09; afterSTDP, 1.36 ± 0.10, p > 0.05; Figure 2C). This raises the possibility that this form of LTD is expressed postsynaptically. Consistent with this, intracellular dialysis of the peptide D15 (1.5 mM)—a peptide that prevents AMPAR endocytosis by disrupting the interaction between dynamin and amphiphysin (Carroll et al., 1999Carroll R.C. Beattie E.C. Xia H. Lüscher C. Altschuler Y. Nicoll R.A. Malenka R.C. von Zastrow M. Dynamin-dependent endocytosis of ionotropic glutamate receptors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The application in the postsynaptic neuron of the GluA23Y peptide (100 μg/ml), which blocks regulated, but not constitutive, AMPAR endocytosis (Brebner et al., 2005Brebner K. Wong T.P. Liu L. Liu Y. Campsall P. Gray S. Phelps L. Phillips A.G. Wang Y.T.

Peineau S. Howland J.G. Wang Y.T. Long-term depression in the CNS.Nat. Rev.

Confirming this peptide’s specific action, the control peptide GluA23A (100 μg/ml) did not influence plasticity (GluA23A/RS39604, 70% ± 5% of baseline, n = 6, p < 0.05; Figure 2D). Furthermore, variance analysis of synaptic responses indicated that t-LTD resulting from chemogenetic inhibition of 5-HT release (Figure 1) or application of 5-HT4R antagonists (Figure 2) is not accompanied by changes in trial-to-trial variation in EPSP amplitude (Figure S4E). This further supports a postsynaptic locus of plasticity expression (Shen et al., 2008Shen W. Flajolet M. Greengard P. Surmeier D.J. Dichotomous dopaminergic control of striatal synaptic plasticity.Science. 2008; 321: 848-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). Overall, these data indicate that 5-HT controls plasticity induction in dSPNs through the activation of 5-HT4R; this effect is not mediated by eCBs, and it relies on postsynaptic expression mechanisms. At glutamatergic synapses on SPNs, the induction of t-LTD depends on the temporal convergence of synaptic input and postsynaptic elevations of dendritic Ca2+ signal triggered by (bAPs) (Plotkin et al., 2013Plotkin J.L. Shen W. Rafalovich I. Sebel L.E. Day M. Chan C.S. Surmeier D.J. Regulation of dendritic calcium release in striatal spiny projection neurons.J.

A Ca(2+) threshold for induction of spike-timing-dependent depression in the mouse striatum.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 13015-13022Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). 5-HT has been shown to regulate ionic conductance that may affect the propagation of bAPs (King et al., 2008King M.V. Marsden C.A. Fone K.C. A role for the 5-HT(1A), 5-HT4 and 5-HT6 receptors in learning and memory.Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2008; 29: 482-492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Modulation of the bAP-induced Ca2+ signal may therefore be one of the mechanisms that affect timing-dependent synaptic plasticity in dSPNs (Plotkin et al., 2013Plotkin J.L. Shen W. Rafalovich I. Sebel L.E. Day M. Chan C.S. Surmeier D.J. Regulation of dendritic calcium release in striatal spiny projection neurons.J.

Acker C.D. Netoff T.I. Sen K. White J.A. Increasing Ca2+ transients by broadening postsynaptic action potentials enhances timing-dependent synaptic depression.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 19121-19125Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, simultaneously with the chemogenetic and pharmacological inhibition of 5-HT signaling, we performed two-photon Ca2+ imaging and whole-cell current clamp recordings and monitored changes in intracellular Ca2+. In the proximal dendrites of dSPNs, a single bout of the negative STDP protocol (1b-STDP) triggered Ca2+ transients that were stable over time, as indicated by the lack of variation in the area under the curve (AUC) of the fluorescence transients over 10–15 min (106% ± 8% of control; n = 8, p > 0.05; Figure 3A). In the dSPNs of hM4Di+/−/Pet1210-Cre mice, bath application of CNO (5 μM) to impede 5-HT release enhanced dendritic Ca2+ influx in response to 1b-STDP (AUC, 130% ± 8% of control; n = 11, p < 0.01; Figure 3B). The 1b-STDP-associated dendritic Ca2+ signal increased upon application of the two 5-HT4R antagonists GR113808 (5 μM; AUC, 122% ± 6% of control; n = 15, p < 0.01; Figure 3C) or RS39604 (5 μM; AUC, 130% ± 7% of control; n = 14, p < 0.01; Figure 3C). Together, these results indicate that impeding 5-HT4R-mediated signaling boosts the bAP-induced dendritic Ca2+ signal. These results appear to conflict with the notion that activation, not inhibition, of Gs-coupled receptors typically enhances voltage-gated Ca2+ currents triggered by APs via stimulation of protein kinase A (PKA) (Higley and Sabatini, 2010Higley M.J. Sabatini B.L. Competitive regulation of synaptic Ca2+ influx by D2 dopamine and A2A adenosine receptors.Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 958-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In several neuronal subtypes, including striatal SPNs, inhibition of various types of K+ currents that contribute to the AP repolarization, and after hyperpolarization phases, enhances dendritic Ca2+ transients (Cai et al., 2004Cai X.

Therefore, we hypothesized that 5-HT4R regulates dendritic Ca2+ levels by instead influencing the activity of K+ channels. In addition to PKA, 5-HT4R can potentially signal to Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) (Liu and Voyno-Yasenetskaya, 2005Liu G. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A.

https://openalex.org/W2799510659,"While the canonical assembly of a GABAA receptor contains two α subunits, two β subunits, and a fifth subunit, it is unclear which variants of each subunit are necessary for native receptors. We used CRISPR/Cas9 to dissect the role of the GABAA receptor β subunits in inhibitory transmission onto hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells and found that deletion of all β subunits 1, 2, and 3 completely eliminated inhibitory responses. In addition, only knockout of β3, alone or in combination with another β subunit, impaired inhibitory synaptic transmission. We found that β3 knockout impairs inhibitory input from PV but not SOM expressing interneurons. Furthermore, expression of β3 alone on the background of the β1-3 subunit knockout was sufficient to restore synaptic and extrasynaptic inhibitory transmission. These findings reveal a crucial role for the β3 subunit in inhibitory transmission and identify a synapse-specific role of the β3 subunit in GABAergic synaptic transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2801609441,"3D fluid-structure interaction modelling was utilized for simulation of 13 normal subjects, 11 non-communicating hydrocephalus (NCH) patients at pre-treatment phase, and 3 patients at five post-treatment phases. Evaluation of ventricles volume and maximum CSF pressure (before shunting) following results validation indicated that these parameters were the most proper hydrodynamic indices and the NCH type doesn't have any significant effect on changes in two indices. The results confirmed an appropriate correlation between these indices although the correlation decreased slightly after the occurrence of disease. NCH raises the intensity of vortex and pulsatility (2.4 times) of CSF flow while the flow remains laminar. On day 18 after shunting, the CSF pressure decreased 81.0% and all clinical symptoms of patients vanished except for headache. Continuing this investigation during the treatment process showed that maximum CSF pressure is the most sensitive parameter to patients' clinical symptoms. Maximum CSF pressure has decreased proportional to the level of decrease in clinical symptoms and has returned close to the pressure range in normal subjects faster than other parameters and simultaneous with disappearance of patients' clinical symptoms (from day 81 after shunting). However, phase lag between flow rate and pressure gradient functions and the degree of CSF pulsatility haven't returned to normal subjects' conditions even 981 days after shunting and NCH has also caused a permanent volume change (of 20.1%) in ventricles. Therefore, patients have experienced a new healthy state in new hydrodynamic conditions after shunting and healing. Increase in patients' intracranial compliance was predicted with a more accurate non-invasive method than previous experimental methods up to more than 981 days after shunting. The changes in hydrodynamic parameters along with clinical reports of patients can help to gain more insight into the pathophysiology of NCH patients."
https://openalex.org/W2801321624,"This study aims to understand the phagocytic response of astrocytes to the injury of neurons or other astrocytes at the single cell level. Laser nanosurgery was used to damage individual cells in both primary mouse cortical astrocytes and an established astrocyte cell line. In both cases, the release of material/substances from laser-irradiated astrocytes or neurons induced a phagocytic response in near-by astrocytes. Propidium iodide stained DNA originating from irradiated cells was visible in vesicles of neighboring cells, confirming phagocytosis of material from damaged cortical cells. In the presence of an intracellular pH indicator dye, newly formed vesicles correspond to acidic pH fluorescence, thus suggesting lysosome bound degradation of cellular debris. Cells with shared membrane connections prior to laser damage had a significantly higher frequency of induced phagocytosis compared to isolated cells with no shared membrane. The increase in phagocytic response of cells with a shared membrane occurred regardless of the extent of shared membrane (a thin filopodial connection vs. a cell cluster with significant shared membrane). In addition to the presence (or lack) of a membrane connection, variation in phagocytic ability was also observed with differences in injury location within the cell and distance separating isolated astrocytes. These results demonstrate the ability of an astrocyte to respond to the damage of a single cell, be it another astrocyte, or a neuron. This single-cell level of analysis results in a better understanding of the role of astrocytes to maintain homeostasis in the CNS, particularly in the sensing and removal of debris in damaged or pathologic nervous tissue."

To identify the genes and molecules associated with poor prognosis of early onset breast cancer, we examined gene expression profiles from paired breast normal/tumor tissues, and coupled with Gene Ontology and public data base analysis. Our data showed that the expression of GAS7b gene was lower in the early onset breast cancer patients as compared to the elder patients. We found that GAS7 was associated with CYFIP1 and WAVE2 complex to suppress breast cancer metastasis via blocking CYFIP1 and Rac1 protein interaction, actin polymerization, and β1-integrin/FAK/Src signaling. We further demonstrated that p53 directly regulated GAS7 gene expression, which was inversely correlated with p53 mutations in breast cancer specimens. Our study uncover a novel regulatory mechanism of p53 in early onset breast cancer progression through GAS7-CYFIP1-mediated signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2801524389,"Stem cell self-renewal is critical for tissue homeostasis, and its dysregulation can lead to organ failure or tumorigenesis. While obesity can induce varied abnormalities in bone marrow components, it is unclear how diet might affect hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self-renewal. Here, we show that Spred1, a negative regulator of RAS-MAPK signaling, safeguards HSC homeostasis in animals fed a high-fat diet (HFD). Under steady-state conditions, Spred1 negatively regulates HSC self-renewal and fitness, in part through Rho kinase activity. Spred1 deficiency mitigates HSC failure induced by infection mimetics and prolongs HSC lifespan, but it does not initiate leukemogenesis due to compensatory upregulation of Spred2. In contrast, HFD induces ERK hyperactivation and aberrant self-renewal in Spred1-deficient HSCs, resulting in functional HSC failure, severe anemia, and myeloproliferative neoplasm-like disease. HFD-induced hematopoietic abnormalities are mediated partly through alterations to the gut microbiota. Together, these findings reveal that diet-induced stress disrupts fine-tuning of Spred1-mediated signals to govern HSC homeostasis."

NiV infections were observed in humans in Bangladesh, India and in the first outbreak in Malaysia, where pigs were also infected. HeV infections occurred in horses in the North-Eastern regions of Australia, with singular transmission events to humans. Bats of the genus Pteropus have been identified as the reservoir hosts for henipaviruses. Molecular and serological indications for the presence of henipa-like viruses in African fruit bats, pigs and humans have been published recently. In our study, truncated forms of HeV and NiV attachment (G) proteins as well as the full-length NiV nucleocapsid (N) protein were expressed using different expression systems. Based on these recombinant proteins, Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISA) were developed for the detection of HeV or NiV specific antibodies in porcine serum samples. We used the NiV N ELISA for initial serum screening considering the general reactivity against henipaviruses. The G protein based ELISAs enabled the differentiation between HeV and NiV infections, since as expected, the sera displayed higher reactivity with the respective homologous antigens. In the future, these assays will present valuable tools for serosurveillance of swine and possibly other livestock or wildlife species in affected areas. Such studies will help assessing the potential risk for human and animal health worldwide by elucidating the distribution of henipaviruses."
https://openalex.org/W2801125806,"Mitochondrial Ca2+ is a key regulator of organelle physiology and the excessive increase in mitochondrial calcium is associated with the oxidative stress. In the present study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms linking mitochondrial calcium to inflammatory and coagulative responses in hepatocytes exposed to high glucose (HG) (33mM glucose). Treatment of HepG2 cells with HG for 24 h induced insulin resistance, as demonstrated by an impairment of insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation. HepG2 treatment with HG led to an increase in mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, while cytosolic calcium remained unchanged. Inhibition of MCU by lentiviral-mediated shRNA prevented mitochondrial calcium uptake and downregulated the inflammatory (TNF-α, IL-6) and coagulative (PAI-1 and FGA) mRNA expression in HepG2 cells exposed to HG. The protection from HG-induced inflammation by MCU inhibition was accompanied by a decrease in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Importantly, MCU inhibition in HepG2 cells abrogated the phosphorylation of p38, JNK and IKKα/IKKβ in HG treated cells. Taken together, these data suggest that MCU inhibition may represent a promising therapy for prevention of deleterious effects of obesity and metabolic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2801437120,"Tandem repeats (TRs) are generated by DNA replication errors and retain a high level of instability, which in principle would make them unsuitable for integration into gene regulatory networks. However, the appearance of DNA sequence motifs recognized by transcription factors may turn TRs into functional cis-regulatory elements, thus favoring their stabilization in genomes. Here, we show that, in human cells, the transcriptional repressor ZEB1, which promotes the maintenance of mesenchymal features largely by suppressing epithelial genes and microRNAs, occupies TRs harboring dozens of copies of its DNA-binding motif within genomic loci relevant for maintenance of epithelial identity. The deletion of one such TR caused quasi-mesenchymal cancer cells to reacquire epithelial features, partially recapitulating the effects of ZEB1 gene deletion. These data demonstrate that the high density of identical motifs in TRs can make them suitable platforms for recruitment of transcriptional repressors, thus promoting their exaptation into pre-existing cis-regulatory networks."

Due to the resulting potential health threat to consumers, the development of a fast, label-free, and non-invasive technique for the detection of adulteration over a wide range of food products is necessary. We therefore report the development of a rapid Raman hyperspectral imaging technique for the detection of food adulteration and for authenticity analysis. The Raman hyperspectral imaging system comprises of a custom designed laser illumination system, sensing module, and a software interface. Laser illumination system generates a 785 nm laser line of high power, and the Gaussian like intensity distribution of laser beam is shaped by incorporating an engineered diffuser. The sensing module utilize Rayleigh filters, imaging spectrometer, and detector for collection of the Raman scattering signals along the laser line. A custom-built software to acquire Raman hyperspectral images which also facilitate the real time visualization of Raman chemical images of scanned samples. The developed system was employed for the simultaneous detection of Sudan dye and Congo red dye adulteration in paprika powder, and benzoyl peroxide and alloxan monohydrate adulteration in wheat flour at six different concentrations (w/w) from 0.05 to 1%. The collected Raman imaging data of the adulterated samples were analyzed to visualize and detect the adulterant concentrations by generating a binary image for each individual adulterant material. The results obtained based on the Raman chemical images of adulterants showed a strong correlation (R>0.98) between added and pixel based calculated concentration of adulterant materials. This developed Raman imaging system thus, can be considered as a powerful analytical technique for the quality and authenticity analysis of food products."
https://openalex.org/W2802196723,"Background Alcohol use disorders (AUD) in older people have been the subject of increasing interest in Europe and worldwide. However, thus far, no reliable data exist regarding the prevalence of AUD in people over the age of 65 years in Europe. Objective To assess the current (past month), 12-month and lifetime prevalence of alcohol use, abuse and dependence in people aged 65–84 years. Study design The MentDis_ICF65+ study was a representative stepwise cross-sectional survey that was conducted in six European and associated cities (Hamburg, Germany; Ferrara, Italy; London/Canterbury, England; Madrid, Spain; Geneva, Switzerland and Jerusalem, Israel). Method In total, 3,142 community-dwelling people aged between 65 and 84 years who lived in participating cities were assessed with an age-sensitive diagnostic interview (CIDI65+). Results The prevalence of lifetime alcohol use was 81% for the overall sample. The observed AUD (DSM-IV-TR) prevalence was as follows: current, 1.1%; 12-month, 5.3% and lifetime, 8.8%. Alcohol consumption and AUD were more prevalent in males, and a significant interaction between gender and city was observed; greater gender differences in the prevalence of these disorders were observed in Hamburg, London/Canterbury and Geneva in comparison to the other cities. The prevalence of lifetime alcohol consumption and 12-month AUD tended to be lower in older persons. Conclusion The results highlight the appropriateness of using age-adjusted diagnostic tools (CIDI65+) to identify alcohol use and AUD in older people. Different alcohol use patterns were observed in males and females. The results seem to indicate the presence of different alcohol use patterns between northern and southern European countries. Specialized services are proposed, including brief and/or more intensive interventions framed intensive and more simple interventions framed in stepped care strategies, to improve the social and health resources available for older people across Europe."

We compared different formulations comprising Calotropis procera, Jacaranda mimosifolia, Thevetia peruviana extracts, chemical fungicide (mefenoxam) and salicylic acid to modulate the defense system of wheat host plants. Among the selected plant species J. mimosifolia aqueous and methanolic leaf extracts (1.2% w/v) resulted in 96 to 97% inhibition against B. sorokiniana. Both in pot and field experiments, among all the formulations of selected plant extracts the combined formulation of JAF2 (J. mimosifolia 0.6%)+MFF2 (mefenoxam 0.1%) lowered the dose of chemical fungicide required to reduce the leaf spot blotch disease. The same formulation induced resistance in wheat apparently through the accumulation of peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase, protease, acid invertase, chitinase and phenylalanine ammonia lyase. This formulation also stimulated the defense-related gene expression of PR-proteins. The same treatment gave even more increase (48%, 12% and 22%) in no. of grains/spike, grains weight and grain yield, than the MFF1 (mefenoxam 0.2%). We conclude that foliar application of J. mimosifolia leaf extract with very low dose of chemical fungicide (J. mimosifolia 0.6%+mefenoxam 0.1%) is a promising approach for the management of leaf blight and spot blotch in wheat."

However, limited data is available on the fate and existence of CT fragment on the surface of the cancer cell. Herein, we characterize two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) showing specificity to the retained juxtamembrane region of MUC16. For the first time, we demonstrate that MUC16 is cleaved in ovarian cancer cells (NIH:OVCAR-3 [OVCAR-3]) and that the cleaved MUC16 subunits remain associated with each other. Immunohistochemical analyses on different grades of ovarian tumor tissues indicated differential reactivity of CA125 and MUC16 CT mAbs. The CA125 (M11) mAb detected 32/40 (80%), while the CT mAb (5E6) detected 33/40 (82.5%) of total ovarian cancer cases. For serous and serous papillary cases, the CA125 (M11) mAb stained 27/31 cases (87%), while CT mAb (5E6) stained 29/31 cases (93.5%). The CT mAb(s) accurately predict expression of MUC16 since their epitopes are not tandemly repeated and their reactivity may not be dependent on O-linked glycosylation. These antibodies can serve as valuable reagents for understanding MUC16 cleavage and may also serve as potential therapeutic agents for treatment of ovarian cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2801040189,"Purpose To investigate the prevalence and risk factors for visual field defect in patients with optic disc drusen (ODD). Methods We assessed the visual field status of patients with ODD whose diagnosis were confirmed by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). Visual field defects were classified as normal, enlarged blind spot, or other defects. ODD were classified into either type 1 (without hyperreflective border and heterogenic internal reflectance) or type 2 (with hyperreflective border and lower internal reflectance). The prevalence and risk factors for each visual field defect was analyzed using logistic regression analysis and classification and regression tree (CART) modeling. Results Of the 40 eyes with ODD, 33 (83%) eyes were categorized as type 1 and 7 (17%) eyes were categorized as type 2 ODD. Regarding the visual field defects, 19 (48%) eyes showed normal visual field, 11 (28%) eyes showed enlarged blind spot, and 9 (24%) eyes showed other defects. The latter was more frequent in type 2 ODD (P = 0.001). Logistic regression analysis revealed that the factor associated with other defects was the thinning of the average retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) (per 10 μm decrease, OR = 3.436, P = 0.004), and the factor associated with enlarged blind spot was the height of ODD (per 100 μm increase, OR = 3.956, P = 0.023). CART modeling revealed that the average RNFL thickness lesser than 85.5 μm, and then the ODD height larger than 348 μm were the best split-up factors for predicting the type of visual field defects. Conclusions In this study, one-quarter of ODD patients showed abnormal visual field defect other than enlarged blind spot. These other visual field defects appeared to be associated with the axonal loss in the eyes with type 2 ODD."
https://openalex.org/W2800303453,"Some filamentous fungi of the Trichoderma genus are used as biocontrol agents against airborne and soilborne phytopathogens. The proposed mechanism by which Trichoderma spp. antagonizes phytopathogens is through the release of lytic enzymes, antimicrobial compounds, mycoparasitism, and the induction of systemic disease-resistance in plants. Here we analyzed the role of TGF-1 (Trichoderma Gcn Five-1), a histone acetyltransferase of Trichoderma atroviride, in mycoparasitism and antibiosis against the phytopathogen Rhizoctonia solani. Trichostatin A (TSA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor that promotes histone acetylation, slightly affected T. atroviride and R. solani growth, but not the growth of the mycoparasite over R. solani. Application of TSA to the liquid medium induced synthesis of antimicrobial compounds. Expression analysis of the mycoparasitism-related genes ech-42 and prb-1, which encode an endochitinase and a proteinase, as well as the secondary metabolism-related genes pbs-1 and tps-1, which encode a peptaibol synthetase and a terpene synthase, respectively, showed that they were regulated by TSA. A T. atroviride strain harboring a deletion of tgf-1 gene showed slow growth, thinner and less branched hyphae than the wild-type strain, whereas its ability to coil around the R. solani hyphae was not affected. Δtgf-1 presented a diminished capacity to grow over R. solani, but the ability of its mycelium -free culture filtrates (MFCF) to inhibit the phytopathogen growth was enhanced. Intriguingly, addition of TSA to the culture medium reverted the enhanced inhibition growth of Δtgf-1 MFCF on R. solani at levels compared to the wild-type MFCF grown in medium amended with TSA. The presence of R. solani mycelium in the culture medium induced similar proteinase activity in a Δtgf-1 compared to the wild-type, whereas the chitinolytic activity was higher in a Δtgf-1 mutant in the absence of R. solani, compared to the parental strain. Expression of mycoparasitism- and secondary metabolism-related genes in Δtgf-1 was differentially regulated in the presence or absence of R. solani. These results indicate that histone acetylation may play important roles in the biocontrol mechanisms of T. atroviride."
https://openalex.org/W2801020736,"For individuals, status is derived both from their personal attributes and the groups with whom they are affiliated. Depending on the performance of their groups, the status of individuals may benefit or suffer from identifying closely with the group. When the group excels, high-status members potentially receive much of the credit and increased status. Conversely, high-status members of underperforming groups potentially suffer disproportionate declines in their status relative to the low-status group members. We therefore predict an interaction between group performance and individual status on the willingness to associate with the group and its members. We test our prediction by examining social media ties among teammates in the National Basketball Association. Specifically, we investigate the “following” ties of teammates on Twitter at the end of the 2014–2015 season. Elections to All-Star games are used to measure the status of players, and team performance is measured by recent success in the postseason playoffs. The results show that compared to high-status players on successful teams, high-status players on underperforming teams are less likely to follow their teammates. This result aligns with research on status inconsistency, suggesting that individuals deemphasize their group affiliation when it jeopardizes their individual status. An additional contribution is the advancement of the probit Social Relations Model for the analysis of binary ties in social networks."
https://openalex.org/W2801499829,"A central argument in the research on traditional knowledge, which persists in the scientific literature, is that the entrance of exotic plants in local medical systems is directly associated with acculturation. However, this logic has put an end for a long period to efforts to understand why such species have so successfully entered socio-ecological systems or even their real role in such systems. This study provides evidence that (1) in some socio-environmental contexts, exotic medicinal species usually confer greater adaptive advantages to local populations, and (2) despite their general importance, exotic species only excel in medical systems when cost-benefit ratio is favorable to them. Thus, in order to avoid the loss of knowledge about native plants and to ensure biocultural conservation, it is necessary to create strategies to amplify the advantages of these species."
https://openalex.org/W2801078340,"According to the Climatic Variability Hypothesis [CVH], thermal plasticity should be wider in organisms from temperate environments, but is unlikely to occur in tropical latitudes where temperature fluctuations are narrow. In copepods, food availability has been suggested as the main driver of phenotypic variability in adult size if the range of temperature change is less than 14°C. Leptodiaptomus garciai is a calanoid copepod inhabiting Lake Alchichica, a monomictic, tropical lake in Mexico that experiences regular, narrow temperature fluctuations but wide changes in phytoplankton availability. We investigated whether the seasonal fluctuations of temperature and food produce phenotypic variation in the life-history traits of this tropical species. We sampled L. garciai throughout a year and measured female size, egg size and number, and hatching success, along with temperature and phytoplankton biomass. The amplitude of the plastic responses was estimated with the Phenotypic Plasticity Index. This index was also computed for a published dataset of 84 copepod populations to look if there is a relationship between the amplitude of the phenotypic plasticity of adult size and seasonal change in temperature. The temperature annual range in Lake Alchichica was 3.2°C, whereas phytoplankton abundance varied 17-fold. A strong pattern of thermal plasticity in egg size and adult female size followed the inverse relationship with temperature commonly observed in temperate environments, although its adaptive value was not demonstrated. Egg number, relative reproductive effort and number of nauplii per female were clearly plastic to food availability, allowing organisms to increase their fitness. When comparing copepod species from different latitudes, we found that the magnitude of thermal plasticity of adult size is not related to the range of temperature variation; furthermore, thermal plasticity exists even in environments of limited temperature variation, where the response is more intense compared to temperate populations."
https://openalex.org/W2802279695,"Contrary to the mainstream blood group systems, P1PK continues to puzzle and generate controversies over its molecular background. The P1PK system comprises three glycosphingolipid antigens: Pk, P1 and NOR, all synthesised by a glycosyltransferase called Gb3/CD77 synthase. The Pk antigen is present in most individuals, whereas P1 frequency is lesser and varies regionally, thus underlying two common phenotypes: P1, if the P1 antigen is present, and P2, when P1 is absent. Null and NOR phenotypes are extremely rare. To date, several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been proposed to predict the P1/P2 status, but it has not been clear how important they are in general and in relation to each other, nor has it been clear how synthesis of NOR affects the P1 phenotype. Here, we quantitatively analysed the phenotypes and A4GALT transcription in relation to the previously proposed SNPs in a sample of 109 individuals, and addressed potential P1 antigen level confounders, most notably the red cell membrane cholesterol content. While all the SNPs were associated with the P1/P2 blood type and rs5751348 was the most reliable, we found large differences in P1 level within groups defined by their genotype and substantial intercohort overlaps, which shows that the P1PK blood group system still eludes full understanding."
https://openalex.org/W2801171434,"The objectives of this study are to analyze the associations between educational levels and poor self-rated health (SRH) among adults in Brazil and to assess trends in the prevalence of poor self-rated health across educational groups between 1998 and 2013. Individual-level data came from the 1998, 2003 and 2008 Brazilian National Household Survey and the 2013 National Health Survey. We estimate prevalence rates of poor SRH by education. Using multivariable regressions, we assess the associations between educational levels and poor self-rated health. We use these regressions to predict the estimated ratios between the prevalence rates of those in low vs. high education in order to assess if relative changes in poor SRH have narrowed over time. Finally, we tested for statistically significant time trends in adult chronic disease inequalities by education. Results indicate a clear educational gradient in poor SRH. Prevalence ratios show that Brazilian adults with no education have levels of poor SRH that are 7 to 9 times higher than those with some college or more. The difference between those with lowest and highest education increased from 1998 to 2013. Compared to those with no education, there were increases in the prevalence of poor SRH among those with primary and secondary incomplete as well as among those with secondary complete in 2008 and 2013. In conclusion, there is a positive association between poor SRH and low education. Brazil has many social and geographic inequalities in health. Even though educational levels are increasing, there is no improvement in the general subjective health of Brazilians. Health inequalities by race and region highlight the need to improve the health of socially disadvantaged groups in Brazil. Addressing chronic conditions and mental health is needed to improve self-perceptions of health in Brazil as well."
https://openalex.org/W2801397567,"After the severe nuclear disaster in Fukushima, which was triggered by the Great East Japan earthquake in March 2011, nuclear power plants in Japan were temporarily shut down for mandatory inspections. To prevent large-scale blackouts, the Japanese government requested companies and households to reduce electricity consumption in summer and winter. It is reported that the domestic electricity demand had a structural decrease because of the electricity conservation effect (ECE). However, quantitative analysis of the ECE is not sufficient, and especially time variation of the ECE remains unclear. Understanding the ECE is important because Japan’s NDC (nationally determined contribution) assumes the reduction of CO2 emissions through aggressive energy conservation. In this study, we develop a time series model of monthly electricity demand in Japan and estimate time variation of the ECE. Moreover, we evaluate the impact of electricity conservation on CO2 emissions from power plants. The dynamic linear model is used to separate the ECE from the effects of other irrelevant factors (e.g. air temperature, economic production, and electricity price). Our result clearly shows that consumers’ electricity conservation behavior after the earthquake was not temporary but became established as a habit. Between March 2011 and March 2016, the ECE on industrial electricity demand ranged from 3.9% to 5.4%, and the ECE on residential electricity demand ranged from 1.6% to 7.6%. The ECE on the total electricity demand was estimated at 3.2%–6.0%. We found a seasonal pattern that the residential ECE in summer is higher than that in winter. The emissions increase from the shutdown of nuclear power plants was mitigated by electricity conservation. The emissions reduction effect was estimated at 0.82 MtCO2–2.26 MtCO2 (−4.5% on average compared to the zero-ECE case). The time-varying ECE is necessary for predicting Japan’s electricity demand and CO2 emissions after the earthquake."
https://openalex.org/W2802783997,"Rotavirus A species (RVA) is the leading cause of severe diarrhea among children in both developed and developing countries. Among different RVA G types, humans are most commonly infected with G1, G2, G3, G4 and G9. During 2003-2004, G3 rotavirus termed as ""new variant G3"" emerged in Japan that later disseminated to multiple countries across the world. Although G3 rotaviruses are now commonly detected globally, they have been rarely reported from Pakistan. We investigated the genetic diversity of G3 strains responsible RVA gastroenteritis in children hospitalized in Rawalpindi, Pakistan during 2014. G3P[8] (18.3%; n = 24) was detected as the most common genotype causing majority of infections in children less than 06 months. Phylogenetic analysis of Pakistani G3 strains showed high amino acid similarity to ""new variant G3"" and G3 strains reported from China, Russia, USA, Japan, Belgium and Hungary during 2007-2012. Pakistani G3 strains belonged to lineage 3 within sub-lineage 3d, containing an extra N-linked glycosylation site compared to the G3 strain of RotaTeqTM. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the molecular epidemiology of G3 rotavirus strains from Pakistan and calls for immediate response measures to introduce RV vaccine in the routine immunization program of the country on priority."
https://openalex.org/W2800763849,"Attempts to exploit the cytotoxic activity of death receptors (DR) for treating cancer have thus far been disappointing. DR activation in most malignant cells fails to trigger cell death and may even promote tumor growth by activating cell death-independent DR-associated signaling pathways. Overcoming apoptosis resistance is consequently a prerequisite for successful clinical exploitation of DR stimulation. Here we show that hyperosmotic stress in the tumor microenvironment unleashes the deadly potential of DRs by enforcing BCL-2 addiction of cancer cells. Hypertonicity robustly enhanced cytotoxicity of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and other DR ligands in various cancer entities. Initial events in TRAIL DR signaling remained unaffected, but hypertonic conditions unlocked activation of the mitochondrial death pathway and thus amplified the apoptotic signal. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that hyperosmotic stress imposed a BCL-2-addiction on cancer cells to safeguard the integrity of the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM), essentially exhausting the protective capacity of BCL-2-like pro-survival proteins. Deprivation of these mitochondrial safeguards licensed DR-generated truncated BH3-interacting domain death agonist (tBID) to activate BCL-2-associated X protein (BAX) and initiated mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP). Our work highlights that hyperosmotic stress in the tumor environment primes mitochondria for death and lowers the threshold for DR-induced apoptosis. Beyond TRAIL-based therapies, our findings could help to strengthen the efficacy of other apoptosis-inducing cancer treatment regimens."
https://openalex.org/W2801338353,"Age is a major risk factor for diseases caused by ischemic hypoxia, such as stroke and coronary artery disease. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are the major cells respond to ischemic hypoxia through angiogenesis and vascular remodeling. However, the effect of aging on EPCs and their responses to hypoxia are not well understood. CD34+ EPCs were isolated from healthy volunteers and aged by replicative senescence, which was to passage cells until their doubling time was twice as long as the original cells. Young and aged CD34+ EPCs were exposed to a hypoxic environment (1% oxygen for 48hrs) and their gene expression profiles were evaluated using gene expression array. Gene array results were confirmed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, and BALB/c female athymic nude mice hindlimb ischemia model. We identified 115 differentially expressed genes in young CD34+ EPCs, 54 differentially expressed genes in aged CD34+ EPCs, and 25 common genes between normoxia and hypoxia groups. Among them, the expression of solute carrier family 2 (facilitated glucose transporter), member 1 (SLC2A1) increased the most by hypoxia in young cells. Gene set enrichment analysis indicated the pathways affected by aging and hypoxia most, including genes ""response to oxygen levels"" in young EPCs and genes involved ""chondroitin sulfate metabolic process"" in aged cells. Our study results indicate the key factors that contribute to the effects of aging on response to hypoxia in CD34+ EPCs. With the potential applications of EPCs in cardiovascular and other diseases, our study also provides insight on the impact of ex vivo expansion might have on EPCs."

However, cattle harbor and shed in the feces other O104 serotypes, particularly O104:H7, which has been associated with sporadic cases of diarrhea in humans. The objective of our study was to assess the virulence potential of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) O104:H7 isolated from feces of feedlot cattle using DNA microarray. Six strains of STEC O104:H7 isolated from cattle feces were analyzed using FDA-E. coli Identification (ECID) DNA microarray to determine their virulence profiles and compare them to the human strains (clinical) of O104:H7, STEC O104:H4 (German outbreak strain), and O104:H21 (milk-associated Montana outbreak strain). Scatter plots were generated from the array data to visualize the gene-level differences between bovine and human O104 strains, and Pearson correlation coefficients (r) were determined. Splits tree was generated to analyze relatedness between the strains. All O104:H7 strains, both bovine and human, similar to O104:H4 and O104:H21 outbreak strains were negative for intimin (eae). The bovine strains were positive for Shiga toxin 1 subtype c (stx1c), enterohemolysin (ehxA), tellurite resistance gene (terD), IrgA homolog protein (iha), type 1 fimbriae (fimH), and negative for genes that code for effector proteins of type III secretory system. The six cattle O104 strains were closely related (r = 0.86-0.98) to each other, except for a few differences in phage related and non-annotated genes. One of the human clinical O104:H7 strains (2011C-3665) was more closely related to the bovine O104:H7 strains (r = 0.81-0.85) than the other four human clinical O104:H7 strains (r = 0.75-0.79). Montana outbreak strain (O104:H21) was more closely related to four of the human clinical O104:H7 strains than the bovine O104:H7 strains. None of the bovine E. coli O104 strains carried genes characteristic of E. coli O104:H4 German outbreak strain and unlike other human strains were also negative for Shiga toxin 2. Because cattle E. coli O104:H7 strains possess stx1c and genes that code for enterohemolysin and a variety of adhesins, the serotype has the potential to be a diarrheagenic foodborne pathogen in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2802777998,"Primordial germ cells (PGCs) are precursors of functional gametes and can be used as efficient transgenic tools and carriers in bioreactors. Few methods for long-term culture of PGCs are available. In this study, we tested various culture conditions for PGCs, and used the optimum culture system to culture chicken gonad PGCs for about three hundred days. Long-term-cultured PGCs were detected and characterized by karyotype analysis, immunocytochemical staining of SSEA-1, c-kit, Sox2, cDAZL, and quantitative RT-PCR for specific genes like Tert, DAZL, POUV, and NANOG. Cultured PGCs labeled with PKH26 were reinjected into Stage X recipient embryos and into the dorsal aorta of Stage 14–17 embryos to assay their ability of migration into the germinal crescent and gonads, respectively. In conclusion, the most suitable culture system for PGCs is as follows: feeder layer cells treated with 20 μg/mL mitomycin C for 2 hours, and with 50% conditioned medium added to the factor culture medium. PGCs cultured in this system retain their pluripotency and the unique ability of migration without transformation, indicating the successful preliminary establishment of chicken primordial germ cell lines and these PGCs can be considered for use as carriers in transgenic bioreactors."
https://openalex.org/W2800751751,"Systematics is considered important for effective toothbrushing. A theoretical concept of systematics in toothbrushing and a validated index to quantify it using observational data is suggested. The index consists of three components: completeness (all areas of the dentition reached), isochronicity (all areas brushed equally long) and consistency (avoiding frequent alternations between areas). Toothbrushing should take a sufficient length of time; therefore, this parameter is part of the index value calculation. Quantitative data from video observations were used including the number of changes between areas, number of areas reached, absolute brushing time and brushing time per area. These data were fed into two algorithms that converted the behaviour into two index values (each with values between 0 and 1) and were summed as the Toothbrushing Systematics Index (TSI) value; 0 indicates completely unsystematic and 2 indicates perfectly systematic brushing. The index was developed using theoretical data. The data matrices revealed the highest values when all areas are reached and brushed equally long. Few changes occurred between the areas when the brushing duration was ≥90 s; the lowest values occurred under opposite conditions. Clinical applicability was tested with data from re-analysed videos from an earlier intervention study aiming to establish a pre-defined toothbrushing sequence. Subjects who fully adopted this sequence had a baseline TSI of 1.30±0.26, which increased to 1.74±0.09 after the intervention (p≤0.001). When the participants who only partially adopted the sequence were included, the respective values were 1.25±0.27 and 1.69±0.14 (p≤0.001). The suggested new TS-index can cover a variety of clinically meaningful variations of systematic brushing, validly quantifies the changes in toothbrushing systematics and has discriminative power."
https://openalex.org/W2801356558,"Over the last decades there has been a decline in the recruitment of medical students into academia in all medical fields. Concurrently, medical research has increasingly included other disciplines in multidisciplinary convergence, introducing an unmet recruitment gap and requirement for medical researchers. To counteract the trend and recruit students to academic medicine, a national intercalated Medical Student Research Program (MSRP) was established in Norway in 2002. A preliminary evaluation in 2009 suggested that the MSRP had resulted in recruitment, but could not conclude on a lasting effect beyond graduation in a study that did not include any controls. These results led us to hypothesize that the MSRP could increase the number of PhD degrees and attract medical students towards academic medicine. Adopting a case cohort design, we here report that the intercalated MSRP had a significant impact of the throughput of physician-scientists to PhD, by increasing the rate of PhD completion 10-fold (p<0.001). Moreover, almost twice as many MSRP physicians reported an academic aspiration (49% vs 22%, p<0.001). Results suggested that an MSRP-like approach could efficiently address the unmet recruitment gap and strengthen the medical disciplines in medical research."

We report on the frequency of cognitive dysfunction among both patients and caregivers and examine associations between caregivers' cognitive screening scores and end of life plans and preferences of patients with advanced cancer. The current sample was derived from a National Cancer Institute- and National Institute of Mental Health-funded study of patients with distant metastasis who had disease progression on at least first-line chemotherapy, and their informal caregivers (n = 550 pairs). The Pfeiffer Short Portable Mental Status, a validated cognitive screen, was administered to patients and caregivers. Patients were interviewed about their end of life plans and preferences. Logistic regression models regressed patients' advance care planning and treatment preferences on caregivers' cognitive screen scores. Patients' cognitive screen scores were included as covariates. Most caregivers (55%) were spouses. Almost 30% of patients scored worse on the cognitive screen than their caregivers and 12% of caregivers scored worse than the patients. For each additional error that caregivers made on the cognitive screen, patients were more likely (AOR = 1.59, p = 0.002) to report that they preferred that everything possible be done to keep them alive and were less likely (AOR = 0.75, p = 0.04) to have a living will or a health care proxy/durable power of attorney. Worse caregiver cognitive screening scores were associated with higher likelihood of patients' reporting that they wanted everything done to save their lives and a lower likelihood of having a living will or other type of advanced care plan. Future studies should confirm these findings in other populations and determine the mechanisms that may underlie the identified relationships."

https://openalex.org/W2801929874,"Localized maternal mRNAs play important roles in embryogenesis, e.g. the establishment of embryonic axes and the developmental cell fate specification, in various animal species. In ascidians, a group of maternal mRNAs, called postplasmic/PEM RNAs, is localized to a subcellular structure, called the Centrosome-Attracting Body (CAB), which contains the ascidian germ plasm, and is inherited by the germline cells during embryogenesis. Posterior end mark (Pem), a postplasmic/PEM RNAs member, represses somatic gene expression in the germline during cleavage stages by inhibition of RNA polymerase II activity. However, the functions of other postplasmic/ PEM RNAs members in germline formation are largely unknown. In this study, we analyzed the functions of two postplasmic/PEM RNAs, Popk-1 and Zf-1, in transcriptional regulation in the germline cells. We show that Popk-1 contributes to transcriptional quiescence by controlling the size of the CAB and amount of Pem protein translated at the CAB. Our studies also indicated that zygotic expression of a germline gene starts around the onset of gastrulation and that the decrease of Pem protein is necessary and sufficient for the zygotic germline gene expression. Finally, further studies showed that the decrease of the Pem protein level is facilitated by Zf-1. Taken together, we propose that postplasmic/PEM RNAs such as Popk-1 and Zf-1 control the protein level of the transcriptional repressor Pem and regulate its transcriptional state in the ascidian germline."

https://openalex.org/W2799735373,"This study examines the consequences of mindset switching on behavioral choices in want/should conflicts. Building on the insights of the ego depletion literature, we propose that mindset switching depletes individuals’ self-control resources and therefore prompts the choice of want behavior, which provides immediate pleasure, over should behavior, which provides long-term utility. Four laboratory experiments with university students that stimulated individuals to switch mindsets were conducted to test our hypotheses. Experiment 1 demonstrated that switching between individualist and collectivist mindsets increased the subjects’ tendency to prefer popular magazines over scientific journals. Experiment 2 replicated the results by testing the relationship between an abstract/concrete mindset-switching task and want/should online behavioral choices. The mediating effect of ego depletion was also supported. Experiment 3 retested the main effect of language-switching on reading choices, and the mediating effect of ego-depletion. Experiment 3 also tested the moderating effect of the Need for Cognition, and eliminated the alternative explanation of cognitive fatigue. In Experiment 4, actual food choices were used as the direct measure of want/should behaviors to test the robustness of our findings. The results consistently supported our hypotheses that mindset switching has significant effects on behavioral choices in terms of overindulgence, such as increasing want behavior and thus foregoing should behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2799343294,"Strong deterioration in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is a major concern in a sub-group of long-term oesophageal cancer survivors. This study aimed to identify potential clustering of patients and tumour variables that predicts such deterioration. Patient and tumour variables were collected in a prospective cohort of patients who underwent surgery for oesophageal cancer in Sweden 2001-2005. Latent cluster analysis identified statistically significant clustering of these variables. Multivariable logistic regression adjusted for age, BMI, tumour stage and marital status was used to determine odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) between patient profiles and HRQOL at 3 and 5 years from surgery. Among 155 included patients at 3 years, three patient profiles were identified: 1) 'reference profile' (males, younger age, employed, upper secondary education, co-habitating, urban dwellers, adenocarcinoma and advanced tumour stage) (n = 47;30%), 2) 'adenocarcinoma profile' (middle age, unemployed/retired, males, low education, co-habitating, adenocarcinoma, advanced tumour stage, tumour in lower oesophagus/cardia, and co-morbidities (n = 79;51%), and 3) 'squamous-cell carcinoma profile' (unemployed/retired, middle-age, males, low BMI, urban dwellers, squamous-cell carcinoma, tumour in upper/middle oesophagus (n = 29;19%). These profiles did not differ regarding most HRQOL measures. Exceptions were the squamous-cell carcinoma profile, reporting more constipation (OR = 5.69; 95%CI: 1.34-24.28) and trouble swallowing saliva (OR = 4.87; 95%CI: 1.04-22.78) and the adenocarcinoma profile reporting more dyspnoea (OR = 2.60; 95%CI: 1.00-6.77) and constipation (OR = 3.31; 95%CI: 1.00-10.97) compared to the reference profile. Three distinct patient profiles were identified but these could not explain the substantial deterioration in HRQOL observed in the sub-sample of survivors."
https://openalex.org/W2802910311,"Regulating membrane potential and synaptic function contributes significantly to the energetic costs of brain signaling, but the relative costs of action potentials (APs) and synaptic transmission during high-frequency firing are unknown. The continuous high-frequency (200-600Hz) electric organ discharge (EOD) of Eigenmannia, a weakly electric fish, underlies its electrosensing and communication. EODs reflect APs fired by the muscle-derived electrocytes of the electric organ (EO). Cholinergic synapses at the excitable posterior membranes of the elongated electrocytes control AP frequency. Based on whole-fish O2 consumption, ATP demand per EOD-linked AP increases exponentially with AP frequency. Continual EOD-AP generation implies first, that ion homeostatic processes reliably counteract any dissipation of posterior membrane ENa and EK and second that high frequency synaptic activation is reliably supported. Both of these processes require energy. To facilitate an exploration of the expected energy demands of each, we modify a previous excitability model and include synaptic currents able to drive APs at frequencies as high as 600 Hz. Synaptic stimuli are modeled as pulsatile cation conductance changes, with or without a small (sustained) background conductance. Over the full species range of EOD frequencies (200–600 Hz) we calculate frequency-dependent “Na+-entry budgets” for an electrocyte AP as a surrogate for required 3Na+/2K+-ATPase activity. We find that the cost per AP of maintaining constant-amplitude APs increases nonlinearly with frequency, whereas the cost per AP for synaptic input current is essentially constant. This predicts that Na+ channel density should correlate positively with EOD frequency, whereas AChR density should be the same across fish. Importantly, calculated costs (inferred from Na+-entry through Nav and ACh channels) for electrocyte APs as frequencies rise are much less than expected from published whole-fish EOD-linked O2 consumption. For APs at increasingly high frequencies, we suggest that EOD-related costs external to electrocytes (including packaging of synaptic transmitter) substantially exceed the direct cost of electrocyte ion homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2800107466,"Introduction Objective was to examine the temporal variation of HIV sero-discordancy in select representative countries (Kenya, Lesotho, Mali, Niger, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe) in sub-Saharan Africa at different HIV epidemic scales. A sero-discordant couple is defined as a stable couple (SC) in which one partner is HIV-positive while the other is HIV-negative. Methods A deterministic compartmental mathematical model was constructed to describe HIV transmission dynamics. The model was pair-based, that is explicitly modeling formation of SCs and infection dynamics in both SCs and in single individuals. The model accommodated for different forms of infection statuses in SCs. Using population-based nationally-representative epidemiologic and demographic input data, historical (1980–2014) and future (2015–2030) trends of sero-discordancy and other demographic and epidemiologic indicators were projected throughout HIV epidemic phases. Results As the epidemics emerged, about 90% of SCs affected by HIV were sero-discordant. This proportion declined to 45%-88% at epidemic peak and stabilized as the epidemics started their natural decline. The largest reductions in sero-discordancy were in high HIV-prevalence countries. As the epidemics further declined with antiretroviral therapy (ART) scale-up, the proportion of sero-discordant couples among HIV-affected couples was projected to increase to 70%-92% by 2030. The proportion of sero-discordant couples among all SCs increased as the epidemics emerged and evolved, then peaked at 2%-20% as the epidemics peaked, and then declined as the epidemics declined to reach 0.3%-16% by 2030. Conclusions Sero-discordancy patterns varied with the evolution of the epidemics, and were affected by both epidemic phase and scale. The largest variations were found in high HIV-prevalence countries. The fraction of stable couples that are sero-discordant, as opposed to being sero-concordant positive, was projected to increase with ART scale-up and further HIV incidence decline over the coming two decades. These findings inform strategic planning and resource allocation for interventions among sero-discordant couples."
