https://openalex.org/W2020860451,"Low and high doses of a dopamine blocking agent had effects on lever pressing for intravenous amphetamine reward which resembled the effects of reward reduction and reward termination, respectively. Noradrenaline blockade had no such effects. A role in central mediation of reward perception is suggested for dopamine but not for noradrenaline."
https://openalex.org/W1967336033,Horseradish peroxidase was injected in different parts of the frontal and parietal cortex in 17 rhesus monkeys. In all cases the enzyme was transported retrogradely to neurons in the substantia innominata and hypothalamus as well as in the thalamus. These new findings demonstrate that these cortical areas receive direct afferent fibers from limbic basal forebrain areas concerned with emotion and motivation.

https://openalex.org/W2072730421,"Pigeons had no greater difficulty learning a complex discrimination involving arbitrary among stimuli (symbolic matching) than one involving interrelations based on stimulus similarity (matching-to-sample). The relative rates of acquisitions of matching and symblic matching may be accounted for by the discriminability between sample stimuli and between comparison stimuli, with the former playing the more important role."

https://openalex.org/W2060290000,"The products from nonflaming combustion of wood and a trimethylolpropane-based rigid-urethane foam that was not fire-retarded produced elevated carboxyhemoglobin levels but no abnormal neurological effects. However, when this type of foam contained a reactive phosphate fire retardant, the combustion products caused grand mal seizures and death in rats. The toxic combustion product responsible for the seizures has been identified as 4-ethyl-1-phospha-2,6,7-trioxabicyclo(2.2.2.)octane-1-oxide."

Electroencephalographic activity over the affected cerebral hemisphere was suppressed, and cerebral blood flow decreased by half. Microscopic examination revealed complete obstruction of the hemispheric microcirculation by platelet aggregates."

https://openalex.org/W2027437771,"An alcohol-water extract of Daphne mezereum L., a plant widely used in folk medicine for treating cancers, showed antileukemic activity against the P-388 lymphocytic leukemia in mice. Systematic fractionation of the extract has led to isolation and characterization of mezerein as the principal antileukemic component."

https://openalex.org/W2012738024,"The intestinal metabolism of phenacetin in vitro was increased 1100 percent in rats fed charcoal-broiled ground beef in a semisynthetic diet. The intestinal metabolism of phenacetin was increased 200 percent in rats fed a chow diet, as compared to rats fed the semisynthetic diet. The results obtained suggest a need for studies in man to determine whether charcoal-broiled meat and other dietary constituents can stimulate the intestinal metabolism of phenacetin or other drugs and thereby decrease their absorption and bioavailability."

https://openalex.org/W2029634007,"To determine whether inherited muscular dystrophy of the chicken is neurogenic or myogenic in origin, limb buds from homozygous normal and dystrophic chick embryos were exchanged prior to muscle differentiation and innervation. Biceps muscles of hatched chicks, in which muscle of the donor was innervated by nerves of the host, were analyzed for embryonic properties of muscle acetylcholinesterase and for fiber diameter, two distinctive markers for expression of the dystrophic gene. The results indicate that muscular dystrophy of the chicken is caused by an initial biochemical lesion in the limb and its muscle rather than in its innervating nerve."
