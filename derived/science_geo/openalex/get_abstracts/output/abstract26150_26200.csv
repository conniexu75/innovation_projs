https://openalex.org/W1980253852,"At most synapses, chemical signalling is terminated by a rapid reaccumulation of neurotransmitter into presynaptic terminals. Uptake systems for the biogenic amines are the initial site of action for therapeutic antidepressants and drugs such as cocaine and the amphetamines. We have isolated a complementary DNA clone encoding a human noradrenaline transporter. The cDNA sequence predicts a protein of 617 amino acids, with 12-13 highly hydrophobic regions compatible with membrane-spanning domains. Expression of the cDNA clone in transfected HeLa cells indicates that noradrenaline transport activity is sodium-dependent and sensitive to selective noradrenaline transport inhibitors. Transporter RNA is localized to the brainstem and the adrenal gland. The predicted protein sequence demonstrates significant amino-acid identity with the Na+/gamma-aminobutyric acid transporter, thus identifying a new gene family for neurotransmitter transporter proteins. Analysis of its structure and function may lead to structure-based drug design for the treatment of human depression and could help determine whether transporter abnormalities underlie affective disorders."

It is a precursor for the biosynthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and also is an important source of labile methyl groups. Mammals fed a choline-deficient diet develop liver dysfunction; however, choline is not considered an essential nutrient in humans. Healthy male volunteers were hospitalised and fed a semisynthetic diet devoid of choline supplemented with 500 mg/day choline for 1 wk. Subjects were randomly divided into two groups, one that continued to receive choline (control), and the other that received no choline (deficient) for three additional wk. During the 5th wk of the study all subjects received choline. The semisynthetic diet contained adequate, but no excess, methionine. In the choline-deficient group, plasma choline and phosphatidylcholine concentrations decreased an average of 30% during the 3-wk period when a choline-deficient diet was ingested; plasma and erthrocyte phosphatidylcholine decreased 15%; no such changes occurred in the control group. In the choline-deficient group, serum alanine aminotransferase activity increased steadily from a mean of 0.42 μkat/liter to a mean of 0.62 μkat/liter during the 3-wk period when a choline-deficient diet was ingested; no such change occurred in the control group. Other tests of liver and renal function were unchanged in both groups during the study. Serum cholesterol decreased an average of 15% in the deficient group and did not change in the control group. Healthy humans consuming a choline-deficient diet for 3 wk had depleted stores of choline in tissues and developed signs of incipient liver dysfunction. Our observations support the conclusion and choline is an essential nutrient for humans when excess methionine and folate are not available in the diet.—Zeisel, S. H.; da Costa, K.-A.; Franklin, P.

https://openalex.org/W1501694644,"A novel Mr 28,000 erythrocyte transmembrane protein was recently purified and found to exist in two forms, and gly28kDa, the latter containing N-linked carbohydrate (Denker, B. M., Smith, B. L., Kuhajda, F. P., and Agre, P. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 15634-15642). Although 28kDa protein resembles the Rh polypeptides biochemically, structural homologies were not identified by immunoblot or two-dimensional iodopeptide maps. The NH2-terminal amino acid sequence for the first 35 residues of purified 28kDa protein is 37% identical to the 26-kDa major intrinsic protein of lens (Gorin, M. B., Yancey, S. B., Cline, J., Revel, J.-P., and Horwitz, J. Cell 39, 49-59). Antisera to a synthetic peptide corresponding to the NH2-terminus of 28kDa protein gave a single reaction of molecular mass 28kDa on immunoblots of erythrocyte membranes. Selective digestions of intact erythrocytes and inside-out membrane vesicles with carboxypeptidase Y indicated the existence of a 5-kDa COOH-terminal cytoplasmic domain. Multiple studies indicated that 28kDa and gly28kDa proteins exist together as a multisubunit oligomer: 1) similar partial solubilizations in Triton X-100; 2) co-purification during ion exchange and lectin affinity chromatography; 3) cross-linking in low concentrations of glutaraldehyde; and 4) physical analyses of purified proteins and solubilized membranes in 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 showed 28kDa and gly28kDa proteins behave as a large single unit with Stokes radius of 61 A and sedimentation coefficient of 5.7 S. These studies indicate that the 28kDa and gly28kDa proteins are distinct from the Rh polypeptides and exist as a multisubunit oligomer. The 28kDa protein has NH2-terminal amino acid sequence homology and membrane organization similar to major intrinsic protein and other members of a newly recognized family of transmembrane channel proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1502681357,"We have isolated and characterized a full-length cDNA clone encoding human loricrin. Curiously, this protein displays major differences from the recently described mouse loricrin (Mehrel, T., Hohl, D., Nakazawa, H., Rothnagel, J.A., Longley, M.A., Bundman, D., Cheng, C.K., Lichti, U., Bisher, M.E., Steven, A. C., Steinert, P.M., Yuspa, S.H., and Roop, D.R. (1990) Cell 61, 1103-1112). Although both proteins are glycine-serine-cysteine-rich, the sequences have not been conserved. However, analysis of the sequences reveals a common motif of quasi-peptide repeats of an aliphatic or aromatic amino acid residue followed by several glycine and/or serine and cysteine residues. These sequences are interspersed and flanked by short glutamine- or glutamine/lysine-rich peptides. Thus loricrins consist of a family of cell envelope proteins of highly variable sequences that nevertheless retain common structural elements. We show that unlike all other putative protein components of the cell envelope, loricrins are highly insoluble, due at least in part to cross-linking by disulfide bonds. Furthermore, we have isolated four peptides from purified human cell envelopes that contain recognizable loricrin sequences and which are cross-linked by the N epsilon-(gamma-glutamyl)lysine isodipeptide bond. The presence of such bonds thus affords an explanation for the extraordinary insolubility of loricrin by cross-linking to the cell envelope and can also explain the low steady-state levels of monomeric loricrin in cytoskeletal extracts of epidermis. This study represents the first report of this isodipeptide cross-link in a protein component of the cornified cell envelope. We propose a model for the structure of loricrin in which (i) the unusual glycine-serine-rich sequences adopt a flexible loop conformation, indexed on the recurrent aliphatic residues; (ii) inter- or intramolecular isodipeptide and disulfide cross-links induce or stabilize folding of loricrin so as to form a more compact rosette-like structure; and (iii) the presence of the flexible glycine-rich loops necessarily will impact a flexible character to the cell envelope and entire epithelium."
https://openalex.org/W1499963171,"Equilibrium binding of human alpha-thrombin to heparin was investigated at pH 7.4 as a function of thrombin and heparin concentrations, NaCl concentration, temperature, and heparin chain length with the extrinsic fluorescence probe, p-aminobenzamidine, or by quantitative affinity chromatography, in order to distinguish between sequence-specific and nonspecific electrostatic modes of binding. Analysis of binding data by a nonspecific binding model developed for protein-nucleic acid interactions, or by the discrete binding site model previously used to analyze the thrombin-heparin interaction, indicated that both models described the binding interaction equally well over the range of thrombin binding densities accessible to measurement. However, the strong dependence of the thrombin-heparin binding interaction on NaCl concentration, its minimal dependence on temperature, and the increase in apparent binding affinity with increasing heparin oligosaccharide chain length were best accounted for by a nonspecific electrostatic association of thrombin with 5 to 6 anionic residues contained in a 3-disaccharide binding site of heparin. This interaction was characterized by an intrinsic dissociation constant (KD,obs) of 6-10 microM at physiological ionic strength. Although the nonspecific binding model satisfactorily described the binding of thrombin to heparin chains ranging in size from 3 to approximately 13 disaccharides in terms of a single intrinsic KD,obs, deviations from this model were apparent with longer heparin chains (approximately 22 to approximately 35 disaccharides) from a progressive decrease in the intrinsic KD,obs of up to 4-fold. Sedimentation equilibrium analyses of thrombin-heparin complexes suggested a second weaker binding site on thrombin for heparin, which accounted for these deviations as well as the observed insolubility of thrombin-heparin complexes at high thrombin binding densities."

https://openalex.org/W1563465184,"Heparin has been shown to accelerate the inactivation of alpha-thrombin by antithrombin III (AT) by promoting the initial encounter of proteinase and inhibitor in a ternary thrombin-AT-heparin complex. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the relative contributions of an AT conformational change induced by heparin and of a thrombin-heparin interaction to the promotion by heparin of the thrombin-AT interaction in this ternary complex. This was achieved by comparing the ionic and nonionic contributions to the binary and ternary complex interactions involved in ternary complex assembly at pH 7.4, 25 degrees C, and 0.1-0.35 M NaCl. Equilibrium binding and kinetic studies of the binary complex interactions as a function of salt concentration indicated a similar large ionic component for thrombin-heparin and AT-heparin interactions, but a predominantly nonionic contribution to the thrombin-AT interaction. Stopped-flow kinetic studies of ternary complex formation under conditions where heparin was always saturated with AT demonstrated that the ternary complex was assembled primarily from free thrombin and AT-heparin binary complex at all salt concentrations. Moreover, the ternary complex interaction of thrombin with AT bound to heparin exhibited a substantial ionic component similar to that of the thrombin-heparin binary complex interaction. Comparison of the ionic and nonionic components of thrombin binary and ternary complex interactions indicated that: 1) additive contributions of ionic thrombin-heparin and nonionic thrombin-AT binary complex interactions completely accounted for the binding energy of the thrombin ternary complex interaction, and 2) the heparin-induced AT conformational change made a relatively insignificant contribution to this binding energy. The results thus suggest that heparin promotes the encounter of thrombin and AT primarily by approximating the proteinase and inhibitor on the polysaccharide surface. Evidence was further obtained for alternative modes of thrombin binding to the AT-heparin complex, either with or without the active site of the enzyme complexed with AT. This finding is consistent with the ternary complex encounter of thrombin and AT being mediated by thrombin binding to nonspecific heparin sites, followed by diffusion along the heparin surface to a unique site adjacent to the bound inhibitor."
https://openalex.org/W1572480128,"Factor C is an endotoxin-sensitive, intracellular serine protease zymogen which initiates the coagulation cascade system in the limulus hemolymph. We have determined the entire amino acid sequence of C using recombinant DNA technique. The zymogen consisted of 994 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 109,648 Da. Most interestingly, C has five repeating units (Sushi domain or short consensus repeat) of about 60 amino acid residues each, which have been found in many proteins participating in the mammalian complement system. In addition to a typical serine protease domain in the carboxyl-terminal portion, characteristic segments with an epidermal growth factor-like, a lectin-like, a cysteine-rich, and a proline-rich domain were also found, revealing a unique mosaic protein structure. The serine protease domain was most analogous to human thrombin. Factor C was identified to localize in large granules in the cell, indicating that it is released from the cell by lipopolysaccharide stimulation. Furthermore, we identified a transcript possibly derived by alternative splicing of C mRNA, which encodes a protein sharing the amino-terminal portion of C. We suggest that C, a newly discovered type of serine protease zymogen, is a coagulation-complement factor which may play important roles in both hemostasis and host defense mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1610318839,"The product of the selA gene, selenocysteine synthase, is a pyridoxal 5-phosphate-containing enzyme which catalyzes the conversion of seryl-tRNA(Sec UCA) into selenocysteyl-tRNA(Sec UCA). Reduction of the aldimine group of pyridoxal 5-phosphate inactivates the enzyme. When reacted with seryl-tRNA(Sec UCA) as sole substrate, pyruvate (and possibly also ammonia) is released; in the presence of a high concentration of potassium borohydride, alanyl-tRNA(Sec UCA) is formed from seryl-tRNA(Sec UCA). These results support the notion that the formyl group of pyridoxal phosphate forms a Schiff base with the alpha-amino group of L-serine with the subsequent 2,3-elimination of a water molecule and the generation of an aminoacrylyl-tRNA(Sec UCA) intermediate. ATP is not required for this reaction step, but it is necessary for the conversion of aminoacrylyl-tRNA into selenocysteyl-tRNA(Sec UCA) which, in addition, requires the SELD protein and reduced selenium. Selenocysteine synthase forms a stable complex with seryl-tRNA(Sec UCA) with one tRNA molecule bound per two 50-kDa monomers. The enzyme does not interact with serine-inserting tRNA species. Taken together, the results show that biosynthesis of selenocysteine takes place in the enzyme-bound state and involves the dehydration of L-serine esterified to tRNA in a first step formally followed by the 2,3-addition of HSe- which is provided by the SELD protein in an ATP-dependent reaction in the form of a reactive selenium donor molecule."

https://openalex.org/W1601141433,"The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is an X-linked recessive immunodeficiency affecting B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes, and platelets. Previous studies on lymphocytes from WAS patients have revealed that leu-kosialin (CD43), a cell-surface glycoprotein bearing approximately 90 O-linked oligosaccharide chains, shows an aberrant electrophoretic mobility. To determine whether this finding reflects a different pattern of O-linked glycosylation in WAS cells, we have compared healthy individuals and WAS patients with respect to glycosyltransferase activities in T lymphocytes, platelets, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-immortalized B cell lines. Stimulation of peripheral T cells from normal individuals in vitro with anti-CD3 antibodies and interleukin-2 was associated with a 3-fold increase in UDP-GlcNAc:Gal beta 3GalNAc-R (GlcNAc to GalNAc) beta 6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (core 2 GlcNAc-T) from 0.8 to 2.2 nmol/mg/h. In contrast, peripheral T lymphocytes from WAS patients showed an inversion of this phenotype with high core 2 GlcNAc-T activity in unstimulated cells (2.3 nmol/mg/h) and a 2-3-fold decrease in activity following stimulation. Core 2 GlcNAc-T activity was also three times higher in platelets from WAS patients than in normal platelets. Glycosyltransferase activities were measured in immortalized B cell lines established from WAS and normal subjects by infection with EBV. Core 2 GlcNAc-T was less than 0.4 nmol/mg/h in WAS EBV-B cell lines compared to 2.4 nmol/mg/h in EBV-B cell lines from healthy individuals, In contrast, CMP-SA:SA alpha 2-3Gal beta 1-3GalNAc-R (where SA represents sialyl (sialic acid to GalNAc) alpha 6-sialyltransferase II activity was 2.0 nmol/mg/h in the WAS EBV-B cell and less than .01 nmol/mg/h in EBV-B cell lines derived from normal subjects. Eleven other glycosyltransferase activities were measured and found to be similar in EBV-B cell lines from WAS and normal individuals. Polylactosamine sequences were much reduced in the O-linked oligosaccharides of CD43 from WAS EBV-B cells consistent with decreased core 2 GlcNAc-T activity and expression of core 1 oligosaccharides in the cells. In conclusion, B cells, T cells, and platelets in WAS patients show abnormal expression of two developmentally regulated glycosyltransferases, consistent with the idea that the WAS immunodeficiency is due to a failure of normal lymphocyte maturation."
https://openalex.org/W1576448444,"Phagosomes are membrane-bound vesicles, formed by the receptor-mediated internalization of particulate ligands, which exchange soluble and membrane proteins with other endocytic compartments as a part of their maturation process. This exchange of material is undoubtedly mediated by fusion of phagosomes with other membrane-bound compartments of the endocytic pathway. By using a particulate probe (fixed Staphylococcus aureus coated with mouse anti-dinitrophenol monoclonal antibody) localized in phagosomes and a soluble probe (dinitrophenol-derivitized beta-glucuronidase) internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis, we have studied phagosome-endosome and phagosome-lysosome fusion in intact cells and in a cell-free system. Vesicle fusion was assessed by measuring beta-glucuronidase activity associated with S. aureus particles after lysis of the membranes. In intact macrophages, newly formed phagosomes fused with early endosomes and with lysosomes. Fusion with lysosomes was observed to commence after a short lag period of about 5 min. In broken-cell preparations, phagosomes were able to fuse with early endosomes. It was not possible to reconstitute phagosome-lysosome fusion in vitro. In vitro phagosome-endosome fusion required energy and cytosolic- and membrane-associated proteins. A nonhydrolyzable analog of GTP stimulated fusion at low cytosol concentrations and inhibited fusion at high cytosol concentrations. These observations indicate that the mechanisms mediating phagosome-endosome fusion are similar to those described for endosome-endosome fusion. Our results suggest that exchange of material with endosomes is an important step in the process of phagosome maturation."

An assay for SELA activity was devised which is based on the seryl-tRNA(Sec UCA)-dependent incorporation of [75Se] selenium into acid-insoluble material. It was used to follow SELA purification from cells that overproduced the protein from a phage T7 promoter plasmid. Purified native SELA protein migrates in gel filtration experiments with a native Mr of about 600,000. SELA contains 1 mol of bound pyridoxal 5-phosphate/mol of 50-kDa subunit. Evidence is presented that the overall conversion of seryl-tRNA(Sec UCA) to selenocysteyl-tRNA(Sec UCA) occurs at the SELA protein. SELA, therefore, has the function of a selenocysteine synthase."

As an essential step toward the understanding of the mechanisms involved in the immune response, we have isolated and characterized the lysozyme gene from Cecropia. The complete nucleotide sequence of the gene as well as the immediate flanking sequences have been determined. The gene includes three exons. Its first intron contains a repetitive sequence. In the evolutionary aspect, the Cecropia lysozyme gene and two vertebrate lysozyme genes have been found to maintain a similar organization pattern of exons. The lysozyme gene has been found to be strongly induced by lipopolysaccharides and a phorbol ester as well as bacteria. In the induction by bacteria, the lysozyme transcript appears at about 2 h, reaches to the maximum level at about 24 h, and then declines. Comparison of the 5'-flanking sequences with several other genes involved in the immune response of H. cecropia and Drosophila melanogaster revealed a kappa B-like consensus sequence. This sequence is specifically recognized by a nuclear protein from the induced pupa."

https://openalex.org/W1493556014,"The matrix of yeast mitochondria contains a chelator-sensitive protease that removes matrix-targeting signals from most precursor proteins transported into this compartment. The enzyme consists of two nonidentical subunits that are encoded by the nuclear genes MAS1 and MAS2. With the aid of these cloned genes, we have now overexpressed the active holoenzyme in yeast, purified it in milligram amounts, and studied its biochemical and physical properties. Atomic absorption analysis shows that the purified enzyme lacks significant amounts of zinc, manganese, or cobalt; if none of these metal ions is added during the assay, the enzyme is catalytically inactive but can still cleave substoichiometric amounts of substrate. The amino-terminal sequences of the two mature subunits were determined; comparison with the deduced amino acid sequences of the corresponding precursors revealed that the MAS1 and MAS2 subunits are synthesized with prepeptides composed of 19 and 13 residues, respectively, which have similar sequences. The enzyme is inhibited competitively by chemically synthesized matrix-targeting peptides; the degree of inhibition correlates with the peptides' targeting efficacy. Matrix-targeting peptides containing the cleavage site of the corresponding authentic precursor protein are cleaved correctly by the purified enzyme. A purified artificial precursor protein bound to the holoenzyme can be photocross-linked to the MAS2 subunit."

To identify the DNA sequences involved in this regulation, a 16-kilobase fragment containing a 4.5-kilobase 5‘-flanking region and the complete sequence of the human desmin gene has been isolated. The transcription initiation sites were determined by S1 nuclease mapping and primer extension analysis. A series of constructs have been made by fusing different lengths of human desmin 5‘-flanking fragments to the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) gene, these constructs were introduced either into mouse myogenic cells or into nonmyogenic cells. Comparison of the transient expression of CAT between myogenic and nonmyogenic cells demonstrated that the sequence including 228 base pairs upstream of the transcription initiation site is sufficient to confer low level, muscle-specific expression of the desmin gene. A negative region was located between -693 and -228 base pairs relative to the desmin mRNA start site. High level expression of the gene depends on a 280-base pair muscle-specific enhancer located between -693 and -973 base pairs upstream of the transcription initiation site. This enhancer can activate either the desmin promoter or heterologous promoters about 20-70-fold in myogenic cells. The enhancer, which also acts in myoblast, is discussed in the context of early expression of the desmin during skeletal myogenesis in the mammalian embryo."

(1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 5790-5794). We cloned a Chinese hamster gene, designated pssC, which was able to transform the PSA-3 cell line to a phosphatidylserine prototroph. The resultant transformant contained phosphatidylserine in normal amounts but remained defective in phosphatidylserine synthase I activity, indicating that pssC is a suppressor gene. Using the genomic fragment of pssC as a probe, a cDNA clone of pssC was isolated, and its nucleotide sequence was determined. A computer search through a protein data bank revealed that pssC had homology with the Escherichia coli psd gene encoding the proenzyme of phosphatidylserine decarboxylase at the amino acid level. Introduction of the cloned pssC gene into PSA-3 resulted in a 2-fold increase in phosphatidylserine decarboxylase activity. When the pssC cDNA was placed downstream of the yeast GAL1 promoter and introduced into yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells, the phosphatidylserine decarboxylase activity increased in a galactose-dependent manner. These results indicate that pssC encodes phosphatidylserine decarboxylase. The mechanism by which pssC complements the defect of PSA-3 in phosphatidylserine biosynthesis is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1552400350,"Ecotin, a serine protease inhibitor found in the periplasm of Escherichia coli, is unusual in its ability to inhibit chymotrypsin, trypsin, and elastase. To address the structural basis of its broad specificity, the gene for ecotin has been cloned and its sequence determined. A promoter of the 17-base pair spacing class was identified, and the probable transcriptional start site lies 18 base pairs upstream from a ribosome binding locus. The gene is followed by a series of conserved repetitive extragenic palindromic sequences. Ecotin has a signal peptide of 20 amino acids which confirms its periplasmic localization. Sequence analyses by Edman degradation and mass spectrometry confirmed 71% of the deduced protein sequence of calculated monomeric molecular mass 16,096 Da. Comparisons of the primary structure for the 142-amino acid protein with the major classes of serine protease inhibitors suggest that ecotin is a novel inhibitor. The reactive site of ecotin was determined to be Met84 for its complexes with chymotrypsin, trypsin, and elastase. The scissile Met84-Met85 bond lies within a disulfide-bonded protein segment similar to other classes of inhibitors."

https://openalex.org/W1485794060,"Abstract A technique for the separation of transcriptionally active and inactive nucleosomes by mercury affinity chromatography has been applied to study the nucleosomal distribution of DNA sequences from the GAL1, ACT1, HIS4, MAT alpha, and HMRa genes of yeast. In mammalian cells, the method has been shown to separate active from inactive nucleosomes and to fractionate the active nucleosomes into two classes, one retained on the mercury column because of salt-labile associations with certain thiol-reactive non-histone proteins, and the other bound by covalent linkage of the cysteine 110 thiol groups of histone H3 molecules to the mercurated support. The first class of nucleosomes is elutable in 0.5 M NaCl; the second is displaced by 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) (Walker, J., Chen, T. A., Sterner, R., Berger, M., Winston, F., and Allfrey, V.G. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 5736-5746). We show that, in wild-type yeast cells, in which histone H3 lacks cysteinyl residues, very little DNA and a negligible complement of nucleosomes appear in the DTT-eluate, confirming the requirement for the H3-thiols in the mercury-binding reaction. Moreover, the DTT-eluted fraction is seriously deficient in the actively transcribed GAL1, ACT1, HIS4, and MAT alpha DNA sequences. Site-directed mutagenesis was employed to create an H3 gene containing a cysteine codon in place of the alanine codon at position 110 of the yeast H3 amino acid sequence. A strain was constructed containing the mutant histone H3 gene instead of the normal H3 gene. Subsequent fractionations of the mutant nucleosomes by mercury-affinity chromatography revealed a characteristic nucleosome peak in the DTT-eluted fraction. Its content of transcribed GAL1, ACT1, and HIS4 DNA sequences was 20- to 500-fold higher than that of the corresponding DTT-eluted fraction of wild-type yeast. Although this result is in accord with the finding that, in mammalian cells, the thiol groups of histone H3 become accessible when nucleosomes unfold during transcription, we find that nucleosomes containing the GAL1 DNA sequences of the yeast H3-mutant also bind to the mercury column when that gene is not being expressed. We conclude that many yeast nucleosomes are maintained in a primed, potentially active state, possibly due to the very high constitutive levels of acetylation of the core histones. However, the nucleosomes of the HMRa gene, which is not expressed in a MAT alpha yeast strain, are virtually absent from the DTT-eluted nucleosome fractions of the H3-mutant cells, indicating that prolonged silencing of the gene is accompanied by compaction and loss of H3-thiol reactivity of its nucleosomes."

The MTB subfamily consists of at least two genes, MTB1 and MTB2, and possibly two to three others. The unique MTB1 and MTA genes have a high degree of identity but diverge in structural detail and expression. Transcripts of the MTA, MTB1, troponin C Spec 1, and CyIIIa actin genes begin simultaneously to accumulate at an early blastula stage. MTB1 mRNA becomes localized in the embryonic gut and oral ectoderm, whereas MTA, Spec 1, and CyIIIa actin mRNAs are spatially restricted to the aboral ectoderm. Several DNA elements are localized at the same positions in the MTB1 and MTA genes: these include respective CATA and TATA boxes, two metal response elements, and three distinct upstream DNA elements that are also present, and in the same order, in the Spec 1 gene promoter. A heptameric sequence, element A, is present at two sites each in the Spec 1 and CyIIIa actin genes, five sites in MTA, but only one site in MTB1. Most strikingly, the first intron of MTA contains elements not found in the MTB1 introns, including a consensus metal response element, an element A, and the P3A site demonstrated in the CyIIIa actin gene to be linked to the regulation of spatial expression."

For peptides synthesized by animal cells, they have a rather peculiar structural feature of containing a D-amino acid residue in their sequence which imparts biological activity on them. The cloned cDNA encoding the prodermorphin precursor contains the usual alanine and methionine codons at positions where D-alanine and D-methionine are present in the mature products. In this study, dermorphin precursor was characterized in extracts from amphibian skin by antisera recognizing distinct epitopes within the predicted structure of pro-dermorphin. Proteolytic digestion of purified endogenous pro-dermorphin generated a peptide containing a D-alanine in position 2, identified as prepro-dermorphin-(80-89), i.e. Tyr-D-Ala-Phe-Gly-Tyr-Pro-Ser-Gly-Glu-Ala. In addition, analysis of skin extracts by enzyme immunoassays coupled to high performance liquid chromatography separations revealed the presence of, besides dermenkephalin, novel dermenkephalin-related peptides, i.e. [L-Met2]dermenkephalin, dermenkephalin-OH, and [Met(O)6]dermenkephalin. [L-Met2]dermenkephalin was present in frog skin in a concentration of about 100 times that of dermenkephalin. These observations confirm that, despite the presence of D-amino acid residues, dermorphin and dermenkephalin are genuine products of post-translational processing of a ribosomally made precursor. They suggest that D-Ala and D-Met develop from a dehydrogenation/hydrogenation stereoinversion of their corresponding L isomers incorporated into pro-dermorphin, a process that occurs with low efficiency at an early stage of biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1529710337,"Abstract DNA polymerase epsilon, formerly known as a proliferating cell nuclear antigen-independent form of DNA polymerase delta, has been shown elsewhere to be catalytically and structurally distinct from DNA polymerase delta. The catalytic activity of HeLa DNA polymerase epsilon, an enzyme consisting of greater than 200- and 55-kDa polypeptides, was assigned to the larger polypeptide by polymerase trap reaction. This catalytic polypeptide was cleaved by incubation with trypsin into two polypeptide fragments with molecular masses of 122 and 136 kDa, the former of which was relatively resistant to further proteolysis and possessed the polymerase activity. The cleavage increased the polymerase and exonuclease activities of the enzyme some 2-3-fold. DNA polymerase epsilon was also purified in a smaller 140-kDa form from calf thymus. The digestion of this form of the enzyme by trypsin also generated a 122-kDa polypeptide. These results suggest that the catalytic core of DNA polymerase epsilon is a 258-kDa polypeptide that is composed of two segments linked with a protease-sensitive area. One of the segments harbors both DNA polymerase and 3'----5' exonuclease activities. In spite of the different polypeptide structures, the catalytic properties of the HeLa enzyme, its trypsin-digested form, and the calf thymus enzyme remained essentially the same."
https://openalex.org/W1605916516,"To probe adriamycin-phospholipid interactions, the effects of this cytotoxin on the hydrolysis of a pyrene-labeled acidic alkyl-acyl phospholipid analog 1-octa-cosanyl-2-(6-pyren-1-yl)hexanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phos p hatidylmethanol (C28-O-PHPM) by porcine pancreatic phospholipase A2 (PLA2) were studied. In the absence of added Ca2+ adriamycin caused a 3-4-fold activation of hydrolysis of this pyrenelipid whereas an inhibition of action of PLA2 on the corresponding phosphatidylcholine derivative C28-O-PHPC was observed. Under similar conditions adriamycin also enhanced the rate of hydrolysis of the pyrene-labeled diacyl lipid 1-palmitoyl-2-(pyren-1-yl)hexanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylgly cer ol and inhibited the hydrolysis of PLA2 on the phosphatidylcholine derivative. Increasing calcium concentrations abolished the activating and most of the inhibitory effects of adriamycin with the above phospholipid substrates. Quenching of pyrene excimer fluorescence by adriamycin revealed efficient binding of the drug to acidic lipids. Addition of 1 mM calcium reduced fluorescence quenching by adriamycin maximally by approximately 90%. In comparison, quenching by adriamycin of pyrene-labeled phosphatidylcholine was much weaker and calcium had only an insignificant effect. Monolayer experiments at an air/water interface showed a rapid and surface pressure-dependent penetration of the drug into a film of C28-O-PHPM. Increase in surface pressure was reversed by 80% by the inclusion of 1 mM Ca2+ into the subphase. Penetration of adriamycin into a monolayer of C28-O-PHPC was much weaker. In agreement with earlier studies two types of binding of adriamycin to C28-O-PHPM are proposed."

These putative transition state-analogue inhibitors show unique and interpretationally significant pH dependences for Ki, as well as for the visible absorption spectra of their E.I complexes in the case of the cobalt-substituted enzyme. From the geometry of the enzymically preferred isomer, it may be concluded that the mechanism of peptide scission by the enzyme entails addition of a nucleophile to the si face of the bound-substrate prochiral carboxamide linkage. New interpretational constraints on the mode of action of the enzyme are thereby imposed."
https://openalex.org/W1824862919,"Low-light digitized video fluorescence polarization microscopy was used to measure lipid order parameters in plasma membrane blebs of single, cultured rat hepatocytes during ATP depletion with the metabolic inhibitors cyanide and iodoacetic acid. Hepatocytes were labeled on the microscope stage with the plasma membrane probe trimethylammoniumdiphenylhexatriene at successive stages of cell injury. A pair of fluorescence polarization ratio images was obtained from a series of four fluorescence images recorded with a polarizer in the emission path oriented first parallel and then perpendicular to each of two orthogonal excitation light polarization directions. From the polarization ratio images, the lipid order parameter S was determined in individual plasma membrane blebs. Results indicate that the plasma membrane becomes uniformly rigid within a few minutes of the addition of metabolic inhibitors when small surface blebs have formed and ATP levels have fallen by >95%. The measured order parameter of S ã 0.95 in plasma membrane blebs, compared with S ã 0.75 in normoxic cell plasma membranes, remained unchanged throughout the course of bleb development and ultimate cell death. These findings demonstrate that significant alteration in hepatocyte plasma membrane structure occurs early in hypoxic cell injury.—Florine-Casteel, K.; Lemasters, J. J.; Herman, B.

https://openalex.org/W1488605014,"Nucleoside permeation in L1210/AM cells is mediated by (a) equilibrative (facilitated diffusion) transporters of two types and by (b) a concentrative Na(+)-dependent transport system of low sensitivity to nitrobenzylthioinosine and dipyridamole, classical inhibitors of equilibrative nucleoside transport. In medium containing 10 microM dipyridamole and 20 microM adenosine, the equilibrative nucleoside transport systems of L1210/AM cells were substantially inhibited and the unimpaired activity of the Na(+)-dependent nucleoside transport system resulted in the cellular accumulation of free adenosine to 86 microM in 5 min, a concentration three times greater than the steady-state levels of adenosine achieved without dipyridamole. Uphill adenosine transport was not observed when extracellular Na+ was replaced by Li+, K+, Cs+, or N-methyl-D-glucammonium ions, or after treatment of the cells with nystatin, a Na+ ionophore. These findings show that concentrative nucleoside transport activity in L1210/AM cells required an inward transmembrane Na+ gradient. Treatment of cells in sodium medium with 2 mM furosemide in the absence or presence of 2 mM ouabain inhibited Na(+)-dependent adenosine transport by 50 and 75%, respectively. However, because treatment of cells with either agent in Na(+)-free medium decreased adenosine transport by only 25%, part of this inhibition may be secondary to the effects of furosemide and ouabain on the ionic content of the cells. Substitution of extracellular Cl- by SO4(-2) or SCN- had no effect on the concentrative influx of adenosine."
https://openalex.org/W1607008760,"The complete rat vitamin D binding protein (DBP) gene has been cloned and characterized. Genomic mapping suggests that there is only one copy of this gene in the haploid genome. The gene spans 35 kilobase pairs and contains 13 exons. All exons, exon/intron borders, and 2196 base pairs of 5'-flanking region have been sequenced. The transcription cap site, determined by primer extension analysis, is 62 base pairs upstream from the start of translation and predicts that an unusual TGTAAA motif may serve as a surrogate TATA. The promoter region contains about 50% nucleotide sequence similarity to the corresponding region of the partially characterized human DBP gene and is uniquely interrupted by a repetitive element. Although lacking in overall sequence similarity to the albumin (ALB) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) genes, the 5'-flanking region of the DBP gene contains a number of conserved segments which may correspond to critical proximal promoter elements in this gene family. The location of the introns in the coding region of the DBP gene is highly conserved when compared with the ALB and AFP genes. Detailed comparison of exon size and content confirms the previous prediction that the smaller size of the DBP protein results from loss of internal exons 12 and 13 from the DBP progenitor gene during its evolutionary divergence from ALB and AFP."
https://openalex.org/W1586894042,"An enzyme kinetic analysis of the cytochrome P450XVII-dependent testicular steroid-17 alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase system was performed which catalyzes simultaneously, at one active site, the formation of androstenedione from progesterone (productive pathway, coordinated performance of both hydroxylase and lyase activities) and the formation of 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone as the intermediate (abortive pathway, isolated performance of hydroxylase activity only). Progesterone was used as the substrate and promegestone (17 alpha, 21-dimethyl-4,9(10)-pregnadiene-3,20-dione) or estradiol as competitive inhibitors, and description of the data was based on the discrimination of those alternative routes of progesterone metabolism. The overall catalytic activity of P450XVII obeyed Michaelis-Menten kinetics (control incubations: V = 440 nM/min with 80 nM P450XVII, Km = 140 nM), and KI values amounted to 6.8 microM for promegestone and to 23.5 microM for estradiol. In contrast, analysis of the rates of both abortive and productive events yielded curvilinear Eadie-Hofstee plots. The former presented an apparent negative cooperative behavior with nh = 0.78 in the region of Kh, while the latter presented an apparent substrate inhibition behavior with the maximal rate occurring at that progesterone concentration where nh for the abortive path reached its minimum. Consequently, the ratio of productive versus abortive catalytic events decreased with increasing substrate supply, but did not reach zero. Effective substrate concentrations [S]eff with respect to either the productive or the abortive pathway were derived from Hill plots. Linearization of Eadie-Hofstee plots and parallel calculation methods using these [S]eff instead of [S] yielded V = 236 nM/min and [S]eff(0.5) = 131 nM for the abortive events and V = 217 nM/min and [S]eff(0.5) = 38 nM for the productive events. Both promegestone and estradiol were identified as competitive inhibitors of either reaction after consideration of effective progesterone concentrations. With the inhibitors, ratios of productive versus abortive events were constantly higher at a given substrate concentration than in control incubations, although neither promegestone nor estradiol affected progesterone or 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone accumulation in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane compartment. Rather, a linear correlation between ratios of productive versus abortive events and the overall catalytic rate as a measure of E.S complex concentration was obtained irrespective of the absence or presence of inhibitor. It was therefore concluded that promegestone and estradiol inhibit access or binding of progesterone to P450XVII, whereas the relative efficiency of androgen formation is solely dictated by the local substrate concentration being effective with respect to E.S formation. A model of P450XVII function is presented which proposes that excess substrate at the active site of the P450XVII enzyme protein hinders a certain fraction of a putative transient intermediate from being retained at the bifunctional catalytic site with the consequence that it cannot be further processed to androgen."
https://openalex.org/W1508272266,"Our previous results using the Saccharomyces cerevisiae secretion system suggest that intramolecular exchange of disulfide bonds occurs in the folding pathway of human lysozyme in vivo (Taniyama, Y., Yamamoto, Y., Kuroki, R., and Kikuchi, M. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 7570-7575). Here we report on the results of introducing an artificial disulfide bond in mutants with 2 cysteine residues substituting for Ala83 and Asp91. The mutant (C83/91) protein was not detected in the culture medium of the yeast, probably because of incorrect folding. Thereupon, 2 cysteine residues Cys77 and Cys95 were replaced with Ala in the mutant C83/91, because a native disulfide bond Cys77-Cys95 was found not necessary for correct folding in vivo (Taniyama, Y., Yamamoto, Y., Nakao, M., Kikuchi, M., and Ikehara, M. (1988) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 152, 962-967). The resultant mutant (AC83/91) was secreted as two proteins (AC83/91-a and AC83/91-b) with different specific activities. Amino acid and peptide mapping analyses showed that two glutathiones appeared to be attached to the thiol groups of the cysteine residues introduced into AC83/91-a and that four disulfide bonds including an artificial disulfide bond existed in the AC83/91-b molecule. The presence of cysteine residues modified with glutathione may indicate that the non-native disulfide bond Cys83-Cys91 is not so easily formed as a native disulfide bond. These results suggest that the introduction of Cys83 and Cys91 may act to suppress the process of native disulfide bond formation through disulfide bond interchange in the folding of human lysozyme."

https://openalex.org/W1518694262,"We have sought to identify candidate substrates for src family protein-tyrosine kinases potentially important for transformation. Transfected NIH/3T3 cells, each overexpressing a normal or activated version of the fyn, fgr, or src translational product, were examined using antibody to phosphotyrosine as a probe. Expression of each cDNA induced similar but distinct patterns of tyrosine phosphorylated cellular proteins, with the extent of phosphorylation being greatest in cells expressing an activated kinase. A 70-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein was found to associate with the activated fyn gene product. A protein designated p130, tyrosine phosphorylated in vitro, and in vivo, was found to physically associate with the activated product of each src family gene examined. Physical interaction of three different highly transforming tyrosine kinases with a common cellular protein suggests that p130 may play an important role in transformation induced by src family kinases."
https://openalex.org/W1494056096,"The gene encoding cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase (P450VIIA) was isolated from rat genomic DNA. The gene spanned about 11 kilobases and contained six exons. Blotting analysis of genomic DNA and complete matching of restriction maps of several isolated genomic clones indicated that there appeared to be only one gene in the rat genome. The putative transcription initiation site was present 61 base pairs upstream from the ATG codon. The typical TATA sequence and CCAAT promoter element were found at 24 and 47 base pairs upstream from the transcription initiation site, respectively. Alignment of several P450 proteins showed that the cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase gene shared location of introns with none of the other P450 genes except for intron 5, which was in the same position as intron 10 of the gene encoding P450IVA1. The alignment also indicated that the distal helix of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase contained an asparagine in place of the well conserved threonine that is postulated to be involved in the O2 binding site. Unusual residues, Asn-126 and Thr-442, were also found at the sites where all other P450s have positively charged amino acids, which are considered to be involved in interaction with heme propionate. These replacements may be related to the unique function and unusual lability of the hydroxylase. Analysis of evolutionary distance between the cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase gene and other known P450 genes indicated that yeast P450LIA is most closely related to P450VIIA. This finding suggests that the cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase gene is an evolutionarily old P450 gene."
https://openalex.org/W1583566762,"The intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) in single gonadotropes was measured with a calcium-sensitive fluorescent dye indo-1 or fura-2 and a digital imaging fluorescence microscopic system to determine how interleukin-6 (IL-6) increases release of gonadotropins. IL-6 induced an increase in the basal [Ca2+]i or the amplitude of spontaneous oscillation of [Ca2+]i in gonadotropes in a mixed population. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (Gn-RH) induced a biphasic increase in [Ca2+]i, a transient increase, and then a prolonged increase. These effects were inhibited by the absence of extracellular calcium or pretreatment with calcium channel blockers, cobalt or nifedipine. Next, purified gonadotropes were prepared by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and argon laser treatment of the cells. Gonadotropes labeled with anti-luteinizing hormone antibody were sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and then cultured as monolayers for 24-48 h. In this way, gonadotropes were concentrated from 5-10% to 70-85% from whole pituitary cells. After relabeling with anti-luteinizing hormone antibody, 100% purified gonadotropes were obtained by killing other types of cells with an argon laser. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone induced almost the same responses of [Ca2+]i in the purified cell population as in the mixed cell population, but IL-6 did not affect [Ca2+]i in the purified gonadotropes. These results suggest that IL-6 affects calcium mobilization in gonadotropes indirectly via paracrine pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1607916258,"RecA protein promotes an unexpectedly efficient DNA strand exchange between circular single-stranded DNA and duplex DNAs containing short (50-400-base pair) heterologous sequences at the 5' (initiating) end. The major mechanism by which this topological barrier is bypassed involves DNA strand breakage. Breakage is both strand and position specific, occurring almost exclusively in the displaced (+) strand of the duplex within a 15-base pair region of the heterology/homology junction. Breakage also requires recA protein, ATP hydrolysis, and homologous sequences 3' to the heterology. Although the location of the breaks and the observed requirements clearly indicate a major role for recA protein in this phenomenon, the molecular mechanism is not yet clear. The breakage may reflect a DNA structure and/or some form of structural stress within the DNA during recA protein-mediated DNA pairing which either exposes the DNA at this precise position to the action of a contaminating nuclease or induces a direct mechanical break. We also find that when heterology is located at the 3' end of the linear duplex, strand exchange is halted (without DNA breakage) about 500 base pairs from the homology/heterology junction."
https://openalex.org/W1482507840,"Two leucine-binding proteins with overlapping specificities for the branched-chain amino acids are present in Escherichia coli. In order to study the basis of specificity for the very similar hydrophobic ligands, we have constructed a series of site-directed mutants of both proteins based on inspection of the leucine-isoleucine-valine-binding protein crystal structure reported by Sack et al. (Sack, J. S., Saper, M. A., and Quiocho, F. A. (1989) J. Mol. Biol. 206, 171-191). Each of the mutant proteins was overexpressed and purified, and their binding activity for a wide variety of potential ligands was measured. By introducing a common restriction endonuclease cleavage site in the two proteins, two hybrid binding proteins consisting of the amino-terminal third of one binding protein fused to the carboxyl-terminal two-thirds of the other were created. The results of these studies indicated that the binding site of the leucine-isoleucine-valine binding protein can accommodate a branch at the beta-carbon of the ligand and that hydrophilic groups on the ligand can be accommodated only in certain orientations. None of the single amino acid substitutions resulted in complete switches in specificity between the two proteins, suggesting that additional residues are involved in leucine binding and discrimination among the branched-chain amino acid substrates."

The purification procedure involves ammonium sulfate fractionation of the cytosol followed by chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel, hydroxylapatite, concanavalin A-Sepharose 4B and Sephacryl S-300. The molecular weight of the native protease was estimated to be Mr = 465,000 by high pressure liquid chromatography. It is composed of a closely moving doublet of Mr = 165,000 and 155,000, as determined on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. It degrades [methyl-14C] alpha-casein with a broad pH optimum of 6.8-8.5. [methyl-14C]bovine serum albumin and 125I-bovine serum albumin are hydrolyzed to the same extent as [methyl-14C]alpha-casein, whereas [methyl-14C]methemoglobin is hydrolyzed to half the extent of [methyl-14C] alpha-casein. Divalent cations, nucleotides, and known protease inhibitors (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, p-chloromercuribenzoate, iodoacetic acid, N-ethylmaleimide, leupeptin, antipain, pepstatin, and hemin) have no effect on the activity of the protease. The protease is glycosylated and appears to aggregate readily. Aggregation may be reversed by treating the protease with certain organic solvents. The protease seems to maintain full activity after heat treatment. Electron microscopic data reveals a spherical structure of 20-nm diameter."
