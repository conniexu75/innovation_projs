In this study, activity-dependent changes in oxyhemoglobin, deoxyhemoglobin, and light scattering were characterized by an imaging spectroscopy approach that offers high spatial, temporal, and spectral resolution. Sensory stimulation of cortical columns initiates tissue hypoxia and vascular responses that occur within the first 3 seconds and are highly localized to individual cortical columns. However, the later phase of the vascular response is less localized, spreading over distances of 3 to 5 millimeters."

https://openalex.org/W2134912543,"Despite an increased understanding of the cellular and molecular biology of the CFTR Cl− channel, it is not known how defective Cl− transport across airway epithelia causes chronic bacterial infections in cystic fibrosis (CF) airways. Here, we show that common CF pathogens were killed when added to the apical surface of normal airway epithelia. In contrast, these bacteria multiplied on CF epithelia. We found that bactericidal activity was present in airway surface fluid of both normal and CF epithelia. However, because bacterial killing required a low NaCl concentration and because CF surface fluid has a high NaCl concentration, CF epithelia failed to kill bacteria. This defect was corrected by reducing the NaCl concentration on CF epithelia. These data explain how the loss of CFTR Cl− channels may lead to lung disease and suggest new approaches to therapy."

https://openalex.org/W2157874893,"The cpd mutation localized by T-DNA tagging on Arabidopsis chromosome 5-14.3 inhibits cell elongation controlled by the ecdysone-like brassinosteroid hormone brassinolide. The cpd mutant displays de-etiolation and derepression of light-induced genes in the dark, as well as dwarfism, male sterility, and activation of stress-regulated genes in the light. The CPD gene encodes a cytochrome P450 (CYP90) sharing homologous domains with steroid hydroxylases. The phenotype of the cpd mutant is restored to wild type both by feeding with C23-hydroxylated brassinolide precursors and by ectopic overexpression of the CPD cDNA. Brassinosteroids also compensate for different cell elongation defects of Arabidopsis det, cop, fus, and axr2 mutants, indicating that these steroids play an essential role in the regulation of plant development."
https://openalex.org/W2042308680,"Petunia embryos carrying the no apical meristem (nam) mutation fail to develop a shoot apical meristem. Occasional shoots on nam- seedlings bear flowers that develop ten instead of five primordia in the second whorl. Double mutants with the homeotic gene green petals show that nam acts independently of organ identify in whorl 2 and now also affects primordium number in whorl 3. The nam gene was isolated by transposon tagging. The encoded protein shares a conserved N-terminal domain with several other proteins of unknown function and thus represents a novel class of proteins. Strikingly, nam mRNA accumulates in cells at the boundaries of meristems and primordia. These data indicate a role for nam in determining positions of meristems and primordia."

https://openalex.org/W2043313965,"Recent evidence that the cerebellum is involved in perception and cognition challenges the prevailing view that its primary function is fine motor control. A new alternative hypothesis is that the lateral cerebellum is not activated by the control of movement per se, but is strongly engaged during the acquisition and discrimination of sensory information. Magnetic resonance imaging of the lateral cerebellar output (dentate) nucleus during passive and active sensory tasks confirmed this hypothesis. These findings suggest that the lateral cerebellum may be active during motor, perceptual, and cognitive performances specifically because of the requirement to process sensory data."
https://openalex.org/W1974839791,"The rate of progression to disease varies considerably among individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1). Analyses of semiannual blood samples obtained from six infected men showed that a rapid rate of CD4 T cell loss was associated with relative evolutionary stasis of the HIV-1 quasispecies virus population. More moderate rates of CD4 T cell loss correlated with genetic evolution within three of four subjects. Consistent with selection by the immune constraints of these subjects, amino acid changes were apparent within the appropriate epitopes of human leukocyte antigen class I-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Thus, the evolutionary dynamics exhibited by the HIV-1 quasispecies virus populations under natural selection are compatible with adaptive evolution."
https://openalex.org/W1994338223,"Hox genes regulate patterning during limb development. It is believed that they function in the determination of the timing and extent of local growth rates. Here, it is demonstrated that synpolydactyly, an inherited human abnormality of the hands and feet, is caused by expansions of a polyalanine stretch in the amino-terminal region of HOXD13. The homozygous phenotype includes the transformation of metacarpal and metatarsal bones to short carpal- and tarsal-like bones. The mutations identify the polyalanine stretch outside of the DNA binding domain of HOXD13 as a region necessary for proper protein function."

https://openalex.org/W2048822761,"Bending in plant tissues results from differential cell elongation. We have characterized Arabidopsis “hookless” mutants that are defective in differential growth in the hypocotyl. HOOKLESS1 was cloned and its predicted protein shows similarity to a diverse group of N-acetyltransferases. HOOKLESS1 mRNA is increased by treatment with ethylene and decreased in the ethylene-insensitive mutant ein2. High level expression of HOOKLESS1 mRNA results in constitutive hook curvature. The morphology of the hookless hypocotyl is phenocopied by inhibitors of auxin transport or by high levels of endogenous or exogenous auxin. Spatial patterns of expression of two immediate early auxin-responsive genes are altered in hookless1mutants, suggesting that the ethylene response gene HOOKLESS1controls differential cell growth by regulating auxin activity."

https://openalex.org/W2078015113,"The mutated gene responsible for the tubby obesity phenotype has been identified by positional cloning. A single base change within a splice donor site results in the incorrect retention of a single intron in the mature tub mRNA transcript. The consequence of this mutation is the substitution of the carboxy-terminal 44 amino acids with 24 intron-encoded amino acids. The normal transcript appears to be abundantly expressed in the hypothalamus, a region of the brain involved in body weight regulation. Variation in the relative abundance of alternative splice products is observed between inbred mouse strains and appears to correlate with an intron length polymorphism. This allele of tub is a candidate for a previously reported diet-induced obesity quantitative trait locus on mouse chromosome 7."

https://openalex.org/W2082916410,"The KH module is a sequence motif found in a number of proteins that are known to be in close association with RNA. Experimental evidence suggests a direct involvement of KH in RNA binding. The human FMR1 protein, which has two KH domains, is associated with fragile X syndrome, the most common inherited cause of mental retardation. Here we present the three-dimensional solution structure of the KH module. The domain consists of a stable beta alpha alpha beta beta alpha fold. On the basis of our results, we suggest a potential surface for RNA binding centered on the loop between the first two helices. Substitution of a well-conserved hydrophobic residue located on the second helix destroys the KH fold; a mutation of this position in FMR1 leads to an aggravated fragile X phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2104008077,"In C. elegans, the anchor cell signal induces Pn.p cells to form the vulva by activating a conserved receptor tyrosine kinase pathway. lin-2 and lin-7 mutants exhibit a vulvaless phenotype similar to the phenotype observed when this signaling pathway is defective. We have found that LIN-7 is a cell junction-associated protein that binds to the LET-23 receptor tyrosine kinase. LET-23 is also localized to the cell junctions, and both LIN-2 and LIN-7 are required for this localization. LET-23 overexpression rescues the lin-2 or lin-7 vulvaless phenotype, suggesting that increased receptor density can compensate for mislocalization. These results suggest that proper localization of LET-23 receptor to the Pn.p cell junctions is required for signaling activity."
https://openalex.org/W2022975161,"Type I myosins are thought to drive actin-dependent membrane motility, but the direct demonstration in vivo of their involvement in specific cellular processes has been difficult. Deletion of the genes MYO3 and MYO5, which encode the yeast type I myosins, almost abolished growth. A double-deleted mutant complemented with a MYO5 temperature-sensitive allele (myo5-1) showed a strong defect in the internalization step of receptor-mediated endocytosis, whereas the secretory pathway remained apparently unaffected. Thus, myosin I activity is required for a budding event in endocytosis but not for several other aspects of membrane traffic."

https://openalex.org/W2010760769,"Operation of the secretory pathway in eukaryotic cells requires the selective docking and fusion of transport vesicles with the appropriate target organelle. This is mediated in part by integral membrane proteins termed v-SNAREs (on vesicles) and t-SNAREs (on the target membranes). We describe a novel yeast t-SNARE that resides on the endoplasmic reticulum and mediates retrograde traffic from the Golgi complex. Mutation of this protein prevents both the HDEL receptor and a membrane protein bearing a dibasic retrieval signal from recycling to the endoplasmic reticulum. Forward traffic is also blocked, but only indirectly. Comparison with other yeast mutants indicates that Sec21p (γ-COP) and Sec20p (an endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein) are also involved primarily, if not exclusively, in retrograde transport."

https://openalex.org/W2066971343,"VP39 is a bifunctional vaccinia virus protein that acts as both an mRNA cap-specific RNA 2'-O-methyltransferase and a poly(A) polymerase processivity factor. Here, we report the 1.85 A crystal structure of a VP39 variant complexed with its AdoMet cofactor. VP39 comprises a single core domain with structural similarity to the catalytic domains of other methyltransferases. Surface features and mutagenesis data suggest two possible RNA-binding sites with novel underlying architecture, one of which forms a cleft spanning the region adjacent to the methyltransferase active site. This report provides a prototypic structure for an RNA methyltransferase, a protein that interacts with the mRNA 5' cap, and an intact poxvirus protein."

https://openalex.org/W2056183396,"Central to the Mu transpositional recombination are the two chemical steps; donor DNA cleavage and strand transfer. These reactions occur within the Mu transpososome that contains two Mu DNA end segments bound to a tetramer of MuA, the transposase. To investigate which MuA monomer catalyzes which chemical reaction, we made transpososomes containing wild-type and active site mutant MuA. By pre-loading the MuA variants onto Mu end DNA fragments of different length prior to transpososome assembly, we could track the catalysis by MuA bound to each Mu end segment. The donor DNA end that underwent the chemical reaction was identified. Both the donor DNA cleavage and strand transfer were catalyzed in trans by the MuA monomers bound to the partner Mu end. This arrangement explains why the transpososome assembly is a prerequisite for the chemical steps."
https://openalex.org/W2070073612,"Mu transposition occurs exclusively using a pair of recombination sites found at the ends of the phage genome. To address the mechanistic basis of this specificity, we have determined both where the individual subunits of the tetrameric transposase bind on the DNA and where they catalyze DNA joining. We demonstrate that subunits do not catalyze recombination at the site adjacent to where they are bound, but rather on the opposite end of the phage genome. Furthermore, subunits bound to two different sites contribute to catalysis of one reaction step. This interwoven subunit arrangement suggests a molecular explanation for the precision with which recombination occurs using a pair of DNA signals and provides an example of the way in which the architecture of a protein-DNA complex can define the reaction products."
https://openalex.org/W2140731089,"Tight docking of the ribosome at the translocation channel ensures that nascent secretory proteins are shielded from the cytoplasm during transfer into the endoplasmic reticulum. Discrete pause transfer sequences mediate the transient stopping of translocation in certain proteins. Here we show that during a translocational pause, the junction between the ribosome and translocation channel is opened, exposing the nascent chain to the cytosol. While transient, this opening is sufficient to demonstrate macromolecular interactions between the translocating chain and molecules added to the cytosol, such as antibodies and site-specific proteases. Moreover, this opening is accompanied by alterations in the proteins that neighbor the nascent chain. These results demonstrate that specific sequences within a translocating nascent chain can elicit dramatic and reversible structural changes in the translocation machinery. Thus, the translocon is dynamic and can be regulated."
https://openalex.org/W2018407221,Electrostatic interactions between charges on ligands and charges on proteins that are remote from the binding interface can influence the free energy of binding (delta Gb). The binding affinities between charged ligands and the members of a charge ladder of bovine carbonic anhydrase (CAII) constructed by random acetylation of the amino groups on its surface were measured by affinity capillary electrophoresis (ACE). The values of delta Gb derived from this analysis correlated approximately linearly with the charge. Opposite charges on the ligand and the members of the charge ladder of CAII were stabilizing; like charges were destabilizing. The combination of ACE and protein charge ladders provides a tool for quantitatively examining the contributions of electrostatics to free energies of molecular recognition in biology.
https://openalex.org/W2050027515,"Occluding vision through one eye during a critical period in early life nearly abolishes responses to that eye in visual cortex. This phenomenon is mimicked by long-term depression of synaptic transmission in vitro, which may require metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) and is age-dependent. Peaks in mGluR expression and glutamate-stimulated phosphoinositide turnover during visual cortical development have been proposed as biochemical bases for the critical period. Pharmacological blockade of mGluRs specifically prevented synapse weakening in mouse visual cortical slices but did not alter kitten ocular dominance plasticity in vivo. Thus, a heightened mGluR response does not account for the critical period in development."

Brightnesses decrease with increasing distance above the rings, implying a scale height of about 0.45 Saturn radii (Rs). A spatial scan 0.28Rs above the A and B rings indicates OH column densities of about 10(13) cm(-2) and number densities of up to 700 cm(-3). Saturn's rings must produce roughly 10(25) to 10(29) OH molecules per second to maintain the observed OH distribution."
