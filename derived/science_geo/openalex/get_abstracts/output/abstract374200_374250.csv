https://openalex.org/W2135168743,"A newly developed maize Illumina GoldenGate Assay with 1536 SNPs from 582 loci was used to genotype a highly diverse global maize collection of 632 inbred lines from temperate, tropical, and subtropical public breeding programs. A total of 1229 informative SNPs and 1749 haplotypes within 327 loci was used to estimate the genetic diversity, population structure, and familial relatedness. Population structure identified tropical and temperate subgroups, and complex familial relationships were identified within the global collection. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) was measured overall and within chromosomes, allelic frequency groups, subgroups related by geographic origin, and subgroups of different sample sizes. The LD decay distance differed among chromosomes and ranged between 1 to 10 kb. The LD distance increased with the increase of minor allelic frequency (MAF), and with smaller sample sizes, encouraging caution when using too few lines in a study. The LD decay distance was much higher in temperate than in tropical and subtropical lines, because tropical and subtropical lines are more diverse and contain more rare alleles than temperate lines. A core set of inbreds was defined based on haplotypes, and 60 lines capture 90% of the haplotype diversity of the entire panel. The defined core sets and the entire collection can be used widely for different research targets."
https://openalex.org/W2069350252,"TDP-43 is a DNA/RNA-binding protein implicated in multiple steps of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Alteration of this multifunctional protein is associated with a number of neurodegenerative diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin positive inclusions. Whereas a pathological link to neurodegenerative disorders has been established, the cellular and physiological functions of TDP-43 remain unknown. In this study, we show that TDP-43 is a nuclear protein with persistent high-level expression during embryonic development and with progressively decreased protein levels during postnatal development. In mice where the TDP-43 gene (Tardbp) was disrupted using a gene trap that carries a beta-galactosidase marker gene, heterozygous (Tardbp(+/-)) mice are fertile and healthy, but intercrosses of Tardbp(+/-) mice yielded no viable homozygotic null (Tardbp(-/-)) mice. Indeed, Tardbp(-/-) embryos die between 3.5 and 8.5 days of development. Tardbp(-/-) blastocysts grown in cell culture display abnormal expansion of their inner cell mass. The pattern of beta-galactosidase staining at E9.5 Tardbp(+/-) embryos is predominantly restricted to the neuroepithelium and remains prominent in neural progenitors at E10.5-12.5. TDP-43 is detected in spinal cord progenitors and in differentiated motor neurons as well as in the dorsal root ganglia at E12.5. Beta-galactosidase staining of tissues from adult Tardbp(+/-) mice shows widespread expression of TDP-43, including prominent levels in various regions of the central nervous system afflicted in neurodegenerative disorders. These results indicate that TDP-43 is developmentally regulated and indispensible for early embryonic development."
https://openalex.org/W2167454069,"The ketogenic diet is a high-fat, low-carbohydrate regimen that forces ketone-based rather than glucose-based cellular metabolism. Clinically, maintenance on a ketogenic diet has been proven effective in treating pediatric epilepsy and type II diabetes, and recent basic research provides evidence that ketogenic strategies offer promise in reducing brain injury. Cellular mechanisms hypothesized to be mobilized by ketone metabolism and underlying the success of ketogenic diet therapy, such as reduced reactive oxygen species and increased central adenosine, suggest that the ketolytic metabolism induced by the diet could reduce pain and inflammation. To test the effects of a ketone-based metabolism on pain and inflammation directly, we fed juvenile and adult rats a control diet (standard rodent chow) or ketogenic diet (79% fat) ad libitum for 3-4 weeks. We then quantified hindpaw thermal nociception as a pain measure and complete Freund's adjuvant-induced local hindpaw swelling and plasma extravasation (fluid movement from the vasculature) as inflammation measures. Independent of age, maintenance on a ketogenic diet reduced the peripheral inflammatory response significantly as measured by paw swelling and plasma extravasation. The ketogenic diet also induced significant thermal hypoalgesia independent of age, shown by increased hindpaw withdrawal latency in the hotplate nociception test. Anti-inflammatory and hypoalgesic diet effects were generally more robust in juveniles. The ketogenic diet elevated plasma ketones similarly in both age groups, but caused slowed body growth only in juveniles. These data suggest that applying a ketogenic diet or exploiting cellular mechanisms associated with ketone-based metabolism offers new therapeutic opportunities for controlling pain and peripheral inflammation, and that such a metabolic strategy may offer significant benefits for children and adults."
https://openalex.org/W2024475404,"The intracellular Gram-negative bacterium Francisella tularensis causes the disease tularemia and is known for its ability to subvert host immune responses. Previous work from our laboratory identified the PI3K/Akt pathway and SHIP as critical modulators of host resistance to Francisella. Here, we show that SHIP expression is strongly down-regulated in monocytes and macrophages following infection with F. tularensis novicida (F.n.). To account for this negative regulation we explored the possibility that microRNAs (miRs) that target SHIP may be induced during infection. There is one miR that is predicted to target SHIP, miR-155. We tested for induction and found that F.n. induced miR-155 both in primary monocytes/macrophages and in vivo. Using luciferase reporter assays we confirmed that miR-155 led to down-regulation of SHIP, showing that it specifically targets the SHIP 3′UTR. Further experiments showed that miR-155 and BIC, the gene that encodes miR-155, were induced as early as four hours post-infection in primary human monocytes. This expression was dependent on TLR2/MyD88 and did not require inflammasome activation. Importantly, miR-155 positively regulated pro-inflammatory cytokine release in human monocytes infected with Francisella. In sharp contrast, we found that the highly virulent type A SCHU S4 strain of Francisella tularensis (F.t.) led to a significantly lower miR-155 response than the less virulent F.n. Hence, F.n. induces miR-155 expression and leads to down-regulation of SHIP, resulting in enhanced pro-inflammatory responses. However, impaired miR-155 induction by SCHU S4 may help explain the lack of both SHIP down-regulation and pro-inflammatory response and may account for the virulence of Type A Francisella."
https://openalex.org/W1967566596,"Background The attribution of personal relevance, i.e. relating internal and external stimuli to establish a sense of belonging, is a common phenomenon in daily life. Although previous research demonstrated a relationship between reward and personal relevance, their exact neuronal relationship including the impact of personality traits remains unclear. Methodology/Principal Findings Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we applied an experimental paradigm that allowed us to explore the neural response evoked by reward and the attribution of personal relevance separately. We observed different brain regions previously reported to be active during reward and personal relevance, including the bilateral caudate nucleus and the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (PACC). Additional analysis revealed activations in the right and left insula specific for the attribution of personal relevance. Furthermore, our results demonstrate a negative correlation between signal changes in both the PACC and the left anterior insula during the attribution of low personal relevance and the personality dimension novelty seeking. Conclusion/Significance While a set of subcortical and cortical regions including the PACC is commonly involved in reward and personal relevance, other regions like the bilateral anterior insula were recruited specifically during personal relevance. Based on our correlation between novelty seeking and signal changes in both regions during personal relevance, we assume that the neuronal response to personally relevant stimuli is dependent on the personality trait novelty seeking."
https://openalex.org/W2075376185,"The extensive diversity of Plasmodium falciparum antigens is a major obstacle to a broadly effective malaria vaccine but population genetics has rarely been used to guide vaccine design. We have completed a meta-population genetic analysis of the genes encoding ten leading P. falciparum vaccine antigens, including the pre-erythrocytic antigens csp, trap, lsa1 and glurp; the merozoite antigens eba175, ama1, msp's 1, 3 and 4, and the gametocyte antigen pfs48/45. A total of 4553 antigen sequences were assembled from published data and we estimated the range and distribution of diversity worldwide using traditional population genetics, Bayesian clustering and network analysis. Although a large number of distinct haplotypes were identified for each antigen, they were organized into a limited number of discrete subgroups. While the non-merozoite antigens showed geographically variable levels of diversity and geographic restriction of specific subgroups, the merozoite antigens had high levels of diversity globally, and a worldwide distribution of each subgroup. This shows that the diversity of the non-merozoite antigens is organized by physical or other location-specific barriers to gene flow and that of merozoite antigens by features intrinsic to all populations, one important possibility being the immune response of the human host. We also show that current malaria vaccine formulations are based upon low prevalence haplotypes from a single subgroup and thus may represent only a small proportion of the global parasite population. This study demonstrates significant contrasts in the population structure of P. falciparum vaccine candidates that are consistent with the merozoite antigens being under stronger balancing selection than non-merozoite antigens and suggesting that unique approaches to vaccine design will be required. The results of this study also provide a realistic framework for the diversity of these antigens to be incorporated into the design of next-generation malaria vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W2129316641,"Background The major role of the neuraminidase (NA) protein of influenza A virus is related to its sialidase activity, which disrupts the interaction between the envelope hemagglutin (HA) protein and the sialic acid receptors expressed at the surface of infected cells. This enzymatic activity is known to promote the release and spread of progeny viral particles following their production by infected cells, but a potential role of NA in earlier steps of the viral life cycle has never been clearly demonstrated. In this study we have examined the impact of NA expression on influenza HA-mediated viral membrane fusion and virion infectivity. Methodology/Principal Findings The role of NA in the early stages of influenza virus replication was examined using a cell-cell fusion assay that mimics HA-mediated membrane fusion, and a virion infectivity assay using HIV-based pseudoparticles expressing influenza HA and/or NA proteins. In the cell-cell fusion assay, which bypasses the endocytocytosis step that is characteristic of influenza virus entry, we found that in proper HA maturation conditions, NA clearly enhanced fusion in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly, expression of NA at the surface of pseudoparticles significantly enhanced virion infectivity. Further experiments using exogeneous soluble NA revealed that the most likely mechanism for enhancement of fusion and infectivity by NA was related to desialylation of virion-expressed HA. Conclusion/Significance The NA protein of influenza A virus is not only required for virion release and spread but also plays a critical role in virion infectivity and HA-mediated membrane fusion."
https://openalex.org/W2141876988,"Viral hepatitis is a serious health burden worldwide. To date, few reports have addressed the prevalence of hepatitis A, B, C, and E in China. Therefore, the general epidemiological parameters of viral hepatitis remain unknown.In this cross-sectional study, we performed a serological prevalence analysis of viral hepatitis A, B, C, and E in 8,762 randomly selected Chinese subjects, which represented six areas of China. The overall prevalence of anti-Hepatitis C virus antibody (anti-HCV) was 0.58%, which was much lower than was estimated by WHO. The prevalences of Hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg), anti-Hepatitis B virus surface protein antibody (HBsAb), and anti-Hepatitis B virus core protein antibody (HBcAb) were 5.84%, 41.31%, and 35.92%, respectively, whereas in the group of subjects less than 5 years old, these prevalences were 1.16%, 46.77%, and 8.69% respectively, which suggests that the Hepatitis B virus (HBV)-carrier population is decreasing, and the nationwide HBV vaccine program has contributed to the lowered HBV prevalence in the younger generation in China. Meanwhile, a large deficit remains in coverage provided by the national HBV immune program. In addition, our data suggested the possibility that HBsAb may not last long enough to protect people from HBV infection throughout life. The overall prevalence of anti-Hepatitis A virus antibody (anti-HAV) and anti-Hepatitis E virus antibody (anti-HEV) were as high as 72.87% and 17.66%, respectively. The indices increased with age, which suggests that a large proportion of Chinese adults are protected by latent infection. Furthermore, the pattern of HEV infection was significantly different among ethnic groups in China.Our study provided much important information concerning hepatitis A, B, C, and E prevalence in China and will contribute to worldwide oversight of viral hepatitis."
https://openalex.org/W2032742227,"Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are the most common genetic cause of Parkinson disease (PD). LRRK2 contains an ""enzymatic core"" composed of GTPase and kinase domains that is flanked by leucine-rich repeat (LRR) and WD40 protein-protein interaction domains. While kinase activity and GTP-binding have both been implicated in LRRK2 neurotoxicity, the potential role of other LRRK2 domains has not been as extensively explored.We demonstrate that LRRK2 normally exists in a dimeric complex, and that removing the WD40 domain prevents complex formation and autophosphorylation. Moreover, loss of the WD40 domain completely blocks the neurotoxicity of multiple LRRK2 PD mutations.These findings suggest that LRRK2 dimerization and autophosphorylation may be required for the neurotoxicity of LRRK2 PD mutations and highlight a potential role for the WD40 domain in the mechanism of LRRK2-mediated cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2055168097,"Background Recent population-based estimates in a Dhaka low-income community suggest that influenza was prevalent among children. To explore the epidemiology and seasonality of influenza throughout the country and among all age groups, we established nationally representative hospital-based surveillance necessary to guide influenza prevention and control efforts. Methodolgy/Principal Findings We conducted influenza-like illness and severe acute respiratory illness sentinel surveillance in 12 hospitals across Bangladesh during May 2007–December 2008. We collected specimens from 3,699 patients, 385 (10%) which were influenza positive by real time RT-PCR. Among the sample-positive patients, 192 (51%) were type A and 188 (49%) were type B. Hemagglutinin subtyping of type A viruses detected 137 (71%) A/H1 and 55 (29%) A/H3, but no A/H5 or other novel influenza strains. The frequency of influenza cases was highest among children aged under 5 years (44%), while the proportions of laboratory confirmed cases was highest among participants aged 11–15 (18%). We applied kriging, a geo-statistical technique, to explore the spatial and temporal spread of influenza and found that, during 2008, influenza was first identified in large port cities and then gradually spread to other parts of the country. We identified a distinct influenza peak during the rainy season (May–September). Conclusions/Significance Our surveillance data confirms that influenza is prevalent throughout Bangladesh, affecting a wide range of ages and causing considerable morbidity and hospital care. A unimodal influenza seasonality may allow Bangladesh to time annual influenza prevention messages and vaccination campaigns to reduce the national influenza burden. To scale-up such national interventions, we need to quantify the national rates of influenza and the economic burden associated with this disease through further studies."
https://openalex.org/W2129522164,"Background Accumulating evidence from epidemiological research has demonstrated an association between advanced paternal age and risk for several psychiatric disorders including autism, schizophrenia and early-onset bipolar disorder. In order to establish causality, this study used an animal model to investigate the effects of advanced paternal age on behavioural deficits in the offspring. Methods C57BL/6J offspring (n = 12 per group) were bred from fathers of two different ages, 2 months (young) and 10 months (old), and mothers aged 2 months (n = 6 breeding pairs per group). Social and exploratory behaviors were examined in the offspring. Principal Findings The offspring of older fathers were found to engage in significantly less social (p = 0.02) and exploratory (p = 0.02) behaviors than the offspring of younger fathers. There were no significant differences in measures of motor activity. Conclusions Given the well-controlled nature of this study, this provides the strongest evidence for deleterious effects of advancing paternal age on social and exploratory behavior. De-novo chromosomal changes and/or inherited epigenetic changes are the most plausible explanatory factors."
https://openalex.org/W1993139307,"Background We are investigating the molecular basis of melanoma by defining genomic characteristics that correlate with tumour phenotype in a novel panel of metastatic melanoma cell lines. The aim of this study is to identify new prognostic markers and therapeutic targets that might aid clinical cancer diagnosis and management. Principal Findings Global transcript profiling identified a signature featuring decreased expression of developmental and lineage specification genes including MITF, EDNRB, DCT, and TYR, and increased expression of genes involved in interaction with the extracellular environment, such as PLAUR, VCAN, and HIF1a. Migration assays showed that the gene signature correlated with the invasive potential of the cell lines, and external validation by using publicly available data indicated that tumours with the invasive gene signature were less melanocytic and may be more aggressive. The invasion signature could be detected in both primary and metastatic tumours suggesting that gene expression conferring increased invasive potential in melanoma may occur independently of tumour stage. Conclusions Our data supports the hypothesis that differential developmental gene expression may drive invasive potential in metastatic melanoma, and that melanoma heterogeneity may be explained by the differing capacity of melanoma cells to both withstand decreased expression of lineage specification genes and to respond to the tumour microenvironment. The invasion signature may provide new possibilities for predicting which primary tumours are more likely to metastasize, and which metastatic tumours might show a more aggressive clinical course."
https://openalex.org/W2002468235,"Background Protein structural domains are evolutionary units whose relationships can be detected over long evolutionary distances. The evolutionary history of protein domains, including the origin of protein domains, the identification of domain loss, transfer, duplication and combination with other domains to form new proteins, and the formation of the entire protein domain repertoire, are of great interest. Methodology/Principal Findings A methodology is presented for providing a parsimonious domain history based on gain, loss, vertical and horizontal transfer derived from the complete genomic domain assignments of 1015 organisms across the tree of life. When mapped to species trees the evolutionary history of domains and domain combinations is revealed, and the general evolutionary trend of domain and combination is analyzed. Conclusions/Significance We show that this approach provides a powerful tool to study how new proteins and functions emerged and to study such processes as horizontal gene transfer among more distant species."
https://openalex.org/W2077724488,"Neurological soft signs and neurocognitive impairments have long been considered important features of schizophrenia. Previous correlational studies have suggested that there is a significant relationship between neurological soft signs and neurocognitive functions. The purpose of the current study was to examine the underlying relationships between these two distinct constructs with structural equation modeling (SEM).118 patients with schizophrenia and 160 healthy controls were recruited for the current study. The abridged version of the Cambridge Neurological Inventory (CNI) and a set of neurocognitive function tests were administered to all participants. SEM was then conducted independently in these two samples to examine the relationships between neurological soft signs and neurocognitive functions.Both the measurement and structural models showed that the models fit well to the data in both patients and healthy controls. The structural equations also showed that there were modest to moderate associations among neurological soft signs, executive attention, verbal memory, and visual memory, while the healthy controls showed more limited associations.The current findings indicate that motor coordination, sensory integration, and disinhibition contribute to the latent construct of neurological soft signs, whereas the subset of neurocognitive function tests contribute to the latent constructs of executive attention, verbal memory, and visual memory in the present sample. Greater evidence of neurological soft signs is associated with more severe impairment of executive attention and memory functions. Clinical and theoretical implications of the model findings are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2066665398,"Background TGF-β1 is involved in cardiac remodeling through an auto/paracrine mechanism. The contribution of TGF-β1 from plasmatic source to pressure overload myocardial remodeling has not been analyzed. We investigated, in patients with valvular aortic stenosis (AS), and in mice subjected to transverse aortic arch constriction (TAC), whether plasma TGF-β1 relates with myocardial remodeling, reflected by LV transcriptional adaptations of genes linked to myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis, and by heart morphology and function. Methodology/Principal Findings The subjects of the study were: 39 patients operated of AS; 27 healthy volunteers; 12 mice subjected to TAC; and 6 mice sham-operated. Myocardial samples were subjected to quantitative PCR. Plasma TGF-β1 was determined by ELISA. Under pressure overload, TGF-β1 plasma levels were significantly increased both in AS patients and TAC mice. In AS patients, plasma TGF-β1 correlated directly with aortic transvalvular gradients and LV mass surrogate variables, both preoperatively and 1 year after surgery. Plasma TGF-β1 correlated positively with the myocardial expression of genes encoding extracellular matrix (collagens I and III, fibronectin) and sarcomeric (myosin light chain-2, β-myosin heavy chain) remodelling targets of TGF-β1, in TAC mice and in AS patients. Conclusions/Significance A circulating TGF-β1-mediated mechanism is involved, in both mice and humans, in the excessive deposition of ECM elements and hypertrophic growth of cardiomyocytes under pressure overload. The possible value of plasma TGF-β1 as a marker reflecting preoperative myocardial remodeling status in AS patients deserves further analysis in larger patient cohorts."
https://openalex.org/W1999508680,"Pancreatic polypeptide (PP) is a potent anti-obesity agent known to inhibit food intake in the absence of nausea, but the mechanism behind this process is unknown.Here we demonstrate that in response to i.p. injection of PP in wild type but not in Y4 receptor knockout mice, immunostaining for the neuronal activation marker c-Fos is induced specifically in neurons of the nucleus tractus solitarius and the area postrema in the brainstem, notably in cells also showing immunostaining for tyrosine hydroxylase. Importantly, strong c-Fos activation is also detected in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARC), particularly in neurons that co-express alpha melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH), the anorexigenic product of the proopiomelanocortin (POMC) gene. Interestingly, other hypothalamic regions such as the paraventricular nucleus, the ventromedial nucleus and the lateral hypothalamic area also show c-Fos induction after PP injection. In addition to c-Fos activation, PP injection up-regulates POMC mRNA expression in the ARC as detected by in situ hybridization. These effects are a direct consequence of local Y4 signaling, since hypothalamus-specific conditional Y4 receptor knockout abolishes PP-induced ARC c-Fos activation and blocks the PP-induced increase in POMC mRNA expression. Additionally, the hypophagic effect of i.p. PP seen in wild type mice is completely absent in melanocortin 4 receptor knockout mice.Taken together, these findings show that PP reduces food intake predominantly via stimulation of the anorexigenic alpha-MSH signaling pathway, and that this effect is mediated by direct action on local Y4 receptors within the ARC, highlighting a potential novel avenue for the treatment of obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2167983164,"The interaction between Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and host cells is complex and far from being understood. The role of the different receptor(s) implicated in the recognition of Mtb in particular remains poorly defined, and those that have been found to have activity in vitro were subsequently shown to be redundant in vivo.To identify novel receptors involved in the recognition of Mtb, we screened a macrophage cDNA library and identified scavenger receptor B class 1 (SR-B1) as a receptor for mycobacteria. SR-B1 has been well-described as a lipoprotein receptor which mediates both the selective uptake of cholesteryl esters and the efflux of cholesterol, and has also recently been implicated in the recognition of other pathogens. We show here that mycobacteria can bind directly to SR-B1 on transfected cells, and that this interaction could be inhibited in the presence of a specific antibody to SR-B1, serum or LDL. We define a variety of macrophage populations, including alveolar macrophages, that express this receptor, however, no differences in the recognition and response to mycobacteria were observed in macrophages isolated from SR-B1(-/-) or wild type mice in vitro. Moreover, when wild type and SR-B1(-/-) animals were infected with a low dose of Mtb (100 CFU/mouse) there were no alterations in survival, bacterial burdens, granuloma formation or cytokine production in the lung. However, significant reduction in the production of TNF, IFNgamma, and IL10 were observed in SR-B1(-/-) mice following infection with a high dose of Mtb (1000 CFU/mouse), which marginally affected the size of inflammatory foci but did not influence bacterial burdens. Deficiency of SR-B1 also had no effect on resistance to disease under conditions of varying dietary cholesterol. We did observe, however, that the presence of high levels of cholesterol in the diet significantly enhanced the bacterial burdens in the lung, but this was independent of SR-B1.SR-B1 is involved in mycobacterial recognition, but this receptor plays only a minor role in anti-mycobacterial immunity in vivo. Like many other receptors for these pathogens, the loss of SR-B1 can be functionally compensated for under normal conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2013369367,"Enterobacteriaceae that contain the High Pathogenicity Island (HPI), which encodes the siderophore yersiniabactin, display increased virulence. This increased virulence may be explained by the increased iron scavenging of the bacteria, which would both enhance bacterial growth and limit the availability of iron to cells of the innate immune system, which require iron to catalyze the Haber-Weiss reaction that produces hydroxyl radicals. In this study, we show that yersiniabactin increases bacterial growth when iron-saturated lactoferrin is the main iron source. This suggests that yersiniabactin provides bacteria with additional iron from saturated lactoferrin during infection. Furthermore, the production of ROS by polymorphonuclear leukocytes, monocytes, and a mouse macrophage cell line is blocked by yersiniabactin, as yersiniabactin reduces iron availability to the cells. Importantly, iron functions as a catalyst during the Haber-Weiss reaction, which generates hydroxyl radicals. While the physiologic role of the Haber-Weiss reaction in the production of hydroxyl radicals has been controversial, the siderophores yersiniabactin, aerobactin, and deferoxamine and the iron-chelator deferiprone also reduce ROS production in activated innate immune cells. This suggests that this reaction takes place under physiological conditions. Of the tested iron chelators, yersiniabactin was the most effective in reducing the ROS production in the tested innate immune cells. The likely decreased bacterial killing by innate immune cells resulting from the reduced production of hydroxyl radicals may explain why the HPI-containing Enterobacteriaceae are more virulent. This model centered on the reduced killing capacity of innate immune cells, which is indirectly caused by yersiniabactin, is in agreement with the observation that the highly pathogenic group of Yersinia is more lethal than the weakly pathogenic and the non-pathogenic group."
https://openalex.org/W2051914740,"Guard cells adjust their volume by changing their ion content due to intense fluxes that, for K(+), are believed to flow through inward or outward Shaker channels. Because Shaker channels can be homo- or heterotetramers and Arabidopsis guard cells express at least five genes encoding inward Shaker subunits, including the two major ones, KAT1 and KAT2, the molecular identity of inward Shaker channels operating therein is not yet completely elucidated. Here, we first addressed the properties of KAT1-KAT2 heteromers by expressing KAT1-KAT2 tandems in Xenopus oocytes. Then, computer analyses of the data suggested that coexpression of free KAT1 and KAT2 subunits resulted mainly in heteromeric channels made of two subunits of each type due to some preferential association of KAT1-KAT2 heterodimers at the first step of channel assembly. This was further supported by the analysis of KAT2 effect on KAT1 targeting in tobacco cells. Finally, patch-clamp recordings of native inward channels in wild-type and mutant genotypes strongly suggested that this preferential heteromerization occurs in planta and that Arabidopsis guard cell inward Shaker channels are mainly heteromers of KAT1 and KAT2 subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1984269054,"The cAMP-responsive transcription factor CREB functions in adipose tissue and liver to regulate glycogen and lipid metabolism in mammals. While Drosophila has a homolog of mammalian CREB, dCREB2, its role in energy metabolism is not fully understood. Using tissue-specific expression of a dominant-negative form of CREB (DN-CREB), we have examined the effect of blocking CREB activity in neurons and in the fat body, the primary energy storage depot with functions of adipose tissue and the liver in flies, on energy balance, stress resistance and feeding behavior. We found that disruption of CREB function in neurons reduced glycogen and lipid stores and increased sensitivity to starvation. Expression of DN-CREB in the fat body also reduced glycogen levels, while it did not affect starvation sensitivity, presumably due to increased lipid levels in these flies. Interestingly, blocking CREB activity in the fat body increased food intake. These flies did not show a significant change in overall body size, suggesting that disruption of CREB activity in the fat body caused an obese-like phenotype. Using a transgenic CRE-luciferase reporter, we further demonstrated that disruption of the adipokinetic hormone receptor, which is functionally related to mammalian glucagon and β-adrenergic signaling, in the fat body reduced CRE-mediated transcription in flies. This study demonstrates that CREB activity in either neuronal or peripheral tissues regulates energy balance in Drosophila, and that the key signaling pathway regulating CREB activity in peripheral tissue is evolutionarily conserved."
https://openalex.org/W2010838601,"Background Recently, there has been renewed interest in the link between cholesterol and prostate cancer. It has been previously reported that in vitro, prostate cancer cells lack sterol-mediated feedback regulation of the major transcription factor in cholesterol homeostasis, sterol-regulatory element binding protein 2 (SREBP-2). This could explain the accumulation of cholesterol observed in clinical prostate cancers. Consequently, perturbed feedback regulation to increased sterol levels has become a pervasive concept in the prostate cancer setting. Here, we aimed to explore this in greater depth. Methodology/Principal Findings After altering the cellular cholesterol status in LNCaP and PC-3 prostate cancer cells, we examined SREBP-2 processing, downstream effects on promoter activity and expression of SREBP-2 target genes, and functional activity (low-density lipoprotein uptake, cholesterol synthesis). In doing so, we observed that LNCaP and PC-3 cells were sensitive to increased sterol levels. In contrast, lowering cholesterol levels via statin treatment generated a greater response in LNCaP cells than PC-3 cells. This highlighted an important difference between these cell-lines: basal SREBP-2 activity appeared to be higher in PC-3 cells, reducing sensitivity to decreased cholesterol levels. Conclusion/Significance Thus, prostate cancer cells are sensitive to changing sterol levels in vitro, but the extent of this regulation differs between prostate cancer cell-lines. These results shed new light on the regulation of cholesterol metabolism in two commonly used prostate cancer cell-lines, and emphasize the importance of establishing whether or not cholesterol homeostasis is perturbed in prostate cancer in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2063614581,"Background Chemokines are a subset of cytokines responsible for controlling the cellular migration of inflammatory cells through interaction with seven transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors. The blocking of a chemokine-receptor interaction results in a reduced inflammatory response, and represents a possible anti-inflammatory strategy, a strategy that is already employed by some virus and parasites. Anti-chemokine activity has been described in the extracts of tick salivary glands, and we have recently described the cloning and characterization of such chemokine binding proteins from the salivary glands, which we have named Evasins. Methodology/Principal Findings We have solved the structure of Evasin-1, a very small and highly selective chemokine-binding protein, by x-ray crystallography and report that the structure is novel, with no obvious similarity to the previously described structures of viral chemokine binding proteins. Moreover it does not possess a known fold. We have also solved the structure of the complex of Evasin-1 and its high affinity ligand, CCL3. The complex is a 1∶1 heterodimer in which the N-terminal region of CCL3 forms numerous contacts with Evasin-1, including prominent π-π interactions between residues Trp89 and Phe14 of the binding protein and Phe29 and Phe13 of the chemokine. Conclusions/Significance However, these interactions do not appear to be crucial for the selectivity of the binding protein, since these residues are found in CCL5, which is not a ligand for Evasin-1. The selectivity of the interaction would appear to lie in the N-terminal residues of the chemokine, which form the “address” whereas the hydrophobic interactions in the rest of the complex would serve primarily to stabilize the complex. A thorough understanding of the binding mode of this small protein, and its other family members, could be very informative in the design of potent neutralizing molecules of pro-inflammatory mediators of the immune system, such as chemokines."
https://openalex.org/W1969896605,"Objective The aim of this study was to describe treatment outcomes for multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) outpatients on a standardized regimen in Nepal. Methodology Data on pulmonary MDR-TB patients enrolled for treatment in the Green Light Committee-approved National Programme between 15 September 2005 and 15 September 2006 were studied. Standardized regimen was used (8Z-Km-Ofx-Eto-Cs/16Z-Ofx-Eto-Cs) for a maximum of 32 months and follow-up was by smear and culture. Drug susceptibility testing (DST) results were not used to modify the treatment regimen. MDR-TB therapy was delivered in outpatient facilities for the whole course of treatment. Multivariable analysis was used to explain bacteriological cure as a function of sex, age, initial body weight, history of previous treatment and the region of report. Principal Findings In the first 12-months, 175 laboratory-confirmed MDR-TB cases (62% males) had outcomes reported. Most cases had failed a Category 2 first-line regimen (87%) or a Category 1 regimen (6%), 2% were previously untreated contacts of MDR-TB cases and 5% were unspecified. Cure was reported among 70% of patients (range 38%–93% by Region), 8% died, 5% failed treatment, and 17% defaulted. Unfavorable outcomes were not correlated to the number of resistant drugs at baseline DST. Cases who died had a lower mean body weight than those surviving (40.3 kg vs 47.2 kg, p<0.05). Default was significantly higher in two regions [Eastern OR = 6.2; 95%CL2.0-18.9; Far West OR = 5.0; 95%CL1.0-24.3]. At logistic regression, cure was inversely associated with body weight <36 kg [Adj.OR = 0.1; 95%CL0.0-0.3; ref. 55–75 kg] and treatment in the Eastern region [Adj.OR = 0.1; 95%CL0.0-0.4; ref. Central region]. Conclusions The implementation of an ambulatory-based treatment programme for MDR-TB based on a fully standardized regimen can yield high cure rates even in resource-limited settings. The determinants of unfavorable outcome should be investigated thoroughly to maximize likelihood of successful treatment."
https://openalex.org/W1980501565,"Development of small molecular kinase inhibitors has recently been the central focus in drug discovery. And type II kinase inhibitors that target inactive conformation of kinases have attracted particular attention since their potency and selectivity are thought to be easier to achieve compared with their counterpart type I inhibitors that target active conformation of kinases. Although mechanisms underlying the interactions between type II inhibitors and their targeting kinases have been widely studied, there are still some challenging problems, for example, how type II inhibitors associate with or dissociate from their targeting kinases. In this investigation, steered molecular dynamics simulations have been carried out to explore the possible dissociation pathways of typical type II inhibitor imatinib from its targeting protein kinases c-Kit and Abl. The simulation results indicate that the most favorable pathway for imatinib dissociation corresponds to the ATP-channel rather than the relatively wider allosteric-pocket-channel, which is mainly due to the different van der Waals interaction that the ligand suffers during dissociation. Nevertheless, the direct reason comes from the fact that the residues composing the ATP-channel are more flexible than that forming the allosteric-pocket-channel. The present investigation suggests that a bulky hydrophobic head is unfavorable, but a large polar tail is allowed for a potent type II inhibitor. The information obtained here can be used to direct the discovery of type II kinase inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2048002175,"The C-terminal end of collagen XV, restin, has been the focus of several studies, but the functions of full-length collagen XV have remained unknown. We describe here studies on the production, purification, and function of collagen XV and the production of a monoclonal N-terminal antibody to it. Full-length human collagen XV was produced in insect cells using baculoviruses and purified from the cell culture medium. The yield was 15 mg/liter of cell culture medium. The collagen XV was shown to be trimeric, with disulfide bonds in the collagenous region. Rotary shadowing electron microscopy revealed rod-like molecules with a mean length of 241.8 nm and with a globular domain at one end. The globular domain was verified to be the N-terminal end by N-terminal antibody binding. The molecules show flexibility in their conformation, presumably due to the many interruptions in their collagenous domains. The ability of collagen XV to serve as a substrate for cells was tested in cell adhesion assays, and it was shown that cells did not bind to collagen XV-coated surfaces. When added to the culture medium of fibroblasts and fibrosarcoma cells, however, collagen XV rapidly bound to their fibronectin network. Solid phase assays showed that collagen XV binds to fibronectin, laminin, and vitronectin and that it binds to the collagen/gelatin-binding domain of fibronectin. No binding was detected to fibrillar collagens, fibril-associated collagens, or decorin. Interestingly, collagen XV was found to inhibit the adhesion and migration of fibrosarcoma cells when present in fibronectin-containing matrices."

The diffusion constant of each molecule allowed us to distinguish whether the molecule has already associated with the plasma membrane or was still freely diffusing in the cytosol. From the number of molecules that inserted during the recovery time we quantified the insertion kinetics: on average, membrane-proximal molecules within the evanescent field needed ∼400 ms to be inserted. The average lifetime of Lck in the plasma membrane was estimated at 50 s; together with the mobility of 0.26 μm2/s this provides sufficient time to explore the surface of the whole T cell before dissociation into the cytosol.

Cell Biol. 2008; 182: 765-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). All these types of motion can be regarded as two-dimensional, i.e. the path of the molecule is restricted to the plasma membrane surface. However, in particular for membrane proteins located in the cytosolic leaflet, the assumption that the molecular path is restricted to a two-dimensional plane may not be fully justified. For example, protein palmitoylation is reversible, and it can thus be expected to result in reversible plasma membrane association of molecules (16.Bijlmakers M.J. Marsh M. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 32-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). In addition, vice versa, plasma membrane association of a cytosolic protein could be enabled e.g. by acylation via a membrane-bound acyltransferase (17.Roth A.F. Feng Y. Chen L. Davis N.G. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). So in many cases, protein association with or dissociation from the membrane plane may well contribute to the observable path as well as function of the molecule.Our knowledge of exchange between cytosolic- and membrane-associated fractions of proteins is still rather poor, mainly because of difficulties in determining the turnover rates. Henis et al. (18.Henis Y.I. Rotblat B. Kloog Y. Methods. 2006; 40: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) described an approach based on Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP), in which the dependence of recovery rates on the beam size was used to discriminate between recovery by lateral diffusion and by exchange with cytosolic pools. Hammond et al. (19.Hammond G.R. Sim Y. Lagnado L. Irvine R.F. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 184: 297-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) analyzed the shape of the recovering intensity profile to quantify the off-rate between GFP-labeled pleckstrin homology domains of cytosolic effector molecules and the polyphosphorylated membrane inositols PtdInsP2 and PtdInsP3. Mashanov et al. (20.Mashanov G.I. Tacon D. Peckham M. Molloy J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15274-15280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) determined the lifetime of GFP-labeled pleckstrin homology domain at the plasma membrane directly by measuring the length of single-molecule trajectories between association and dissociation, including a correction for photobleaching effects. This approach proved valid and suitable for immobile proteins, but is difficult to implement in the case of mobile proteins: single-molecule trajectories may be truncated not only because of dissociation or photobleaching of the molecule, but also fluorophore blinking (21.Dickson R.M. Cubitt A.B. Tsien R.Y. Moerner W.E. Nature. 1997; 388: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar), due to tracking ambiguities in case of overlapping segments or simply the movement of the molecule out of the observation window. In a recent study, Knight and Falke (22.Knight J.D. Falke J.J. Biophys. J. 2009; 96: 566-582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) took a further step by combining single-molecule tracking with total internal reflection (TIR) excitation to study the docking of purified pleckstrin homology domain to artificial supported lipid bilayers.We present here an approach to study molecular exchange between the plasma membrane and the cytosol in living cells, which enables in particular the analysis of mobile proteins. It combines the advantages of TIR excitation, FRAP, and single-molecule tracking in a single assay and extends our previously introduced method for “thinning out clusters while conserving the stoichiometry of labeling” (TOCCSL) (23.Moertelmaier M. Brameshuber M. Linimeier M. Schütz G.J. Stockinger H. Appl. Phys. Lett. 2005; 87: 263903Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Upon photobleaching of the bottom plasma membrane via an evanescent field, the first molecules entering the bleached regions are analyzed. In this configuration, the exchange from cytosolic pools can be easily discriminated from the recovery of membrane-anchored molecules via the spatial profile of the recovery signal. When performed at the single-molecule level, the method enables a more detailed analysis of the recovering species: for example, mobility analysis allows for identifying and counting those molecules that have inserted into the plasma membrane during the time course of the recovery process.We used the method to address the exchange dynamics of Lck, the major Src family tyrosine kinase in early T cell signaling (24.Davis M.M. Krogsgaard M. Huse M. Huppa J. Lillemeier B.F. Li Q.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 25: 681-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Lck is membrane-anchored via N-terminal palmitoylation of the two cysteines at positions 3 and 5 and myristoylation of glycine 2. Double palmitoylation was shown to be required to fully target the protein to the plasma membrane and to function properly in T cell signaling (25.Kabouridis P.S. Magee A.I. Ley S.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4983-4998Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Frequently, we and others (26.Bijlmakers M.J. Marsh M. J.

Here, we directly recorded the insertion of cytosolic Lck, quantified the association rate, and provided an estimate of the lifetime of Lck in the plasma membrane, assuming steady state conditions. Experiments on palmitoylation-deficient mutants yielded a dramatically increased off-rate and were interpreted on the basis of a model that explicitly accounts for reversible acylation on cysteines 3 and 5.DISCUSSIONIn this report, we applied single molecule fluorescence microscopy in combination with FRAP to study the exchange kinetics between cytosolic and membrane-bound Lck. A substantial population of cytosolic non-vesicular Lck-YFP was found in the immediate vicinity of the plasma membrane; from this population, we frequently observed individual molecules to associate with or incorporate into the membrane, as evidenced by mobility analysis.The observation of cytosolic Lck is not new (27.Tuosto L. Parolini I. Schröder S. Sargiacomo M. Lanzavecchia A. Viola A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 28.Haughn L. Leung B. Boise L. Veillette A. Thompson C.

Med. 2008; 205: 3201-3213Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and has been frequently ascribed to the presence of transport carriers for delivery to the plasma membrane (26.Bijlmakers M.J. Marsh M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 30.Antón O. Batista A. Millán J. Andrés-Delgado L. Puertollano R. Correas I. Alonso M.A. J. Exp. Med. 2008; 205: 3201-3213Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Indeed, using standard epi-fluorescence microscopy, we also observed Lck-YFP-positive vesicular structures, with occasional periods of directed transport (data not shown). However, when switching to TIR illumination, we could efficiently restrict the analysis to non-vesicular Lck, as evidenced by the following observations. First, we hardly found directed transport of Lck-YFP-positive structures. Second, when blocking directed transport by degrading microtubules, we still observed Lck-YFP molecules entering the evanescent field after photobleaching. The measured diffusion constant of the cytosolic Lck population of D ∼10 μm2/s compares well with a purely cytosolic variant Lck-ΔN10-mGFP, and with data reported in the literature e.g. for the three-dimensional diffusion of a cytosolic pool of farnesylated EGFP (D∼11 μm2/s (35.Ohsugi Y. Saito K. Tamura M. Kinjo M. Biophys. J. 2006; 91: 3456-3464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar)); diffusing vesicular structures would be orders of magnitude slower (36.Schütz G.J. Axmann M. Freudenthaler S. Schindler H. Kandror K. Roder J.C. Jeromin A. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2004; 63: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Together, our data indicate a substantial fraction of soluble non-vesicular Lck-YFP in Jurkat T cells.We estimated the time constant for association of membrane-proximal Lck with the plasma membrane to be ∼400 ms. This association rate, as defined in our study, is independent of the protein expression levels, making it a valid parameter for comparison between the different Lck mutants. This association time appears extremely long compared with a time of ∼0.5 ms a cytosolic molecule needs to traverse the evanescent field (∼100 nm (37.Mattheyses A.L. Axelrod D. J. Biomed. Opt. 2006; 11 (014006)Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar)). Thus, it takes about 1000 encounters for the molecule in order to be attached to the membrane. Once attached, molecules remain on average for ∼50 s in the plasma membrane. With D = 0.26 μm2/s, this time is sufficient for a given Lck molecule to reach the opposite side of the T cell via Brownian motion (x = 2√Dt ∼ 7 μm) before dissociation. Lck is therefore capable of transmitting signals over the whole T cell membrane, a property that is different for example for pleckstrin homology domains: their binding to inositol lipids shows a much lower lifetime of ∼2.5 s, making those interactions suitable for the formation of local concentration gradients (19.Hammond G.R. Sim Y. Lagnado L. Irvine R.F. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 184: 297-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).How can membrane association of Lck be regulated? Lck is acylated via N-terminal palmitoylation of two cysteines at position 3 and 5 and myristoylation at glycine 2. Kabouridis et al. (25.Kabouridis P.S. Magee A.I. Ley S.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4983-4998Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) showed that double palmitoylation is required for full membrane targeting: while a non-palmitoylated mutant was not detectable at the membrane, mono-palmitoylated mutants yielded a decreased membrane association compared with the wild-type. Therefore, reversible palmitoylation mediated by the interplay of membrane-associated palmitoyl transferases and thioesterases (16.Bijlmakers M.J. Marsh M. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 32-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 38.Duncan J.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 74-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar) is most likely responsible for the observed exchange of the two pools.In Fig. 7 we show a working model for the interpretation of our data. The model discriminates between the partitioning of mono-acylated proteins and proteins modified with two or more acyl chains: a single myristic acid modification leads to a soluble molecule (41.Peitzsch R.M. McLaughlin S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10436-10443Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar) whereas additional palmitoylation at a single site, irrespective of whether at C3 or C5, yields a quasi infinite lifetime of the protein at the plasma membrane (42.Shahinian S. Silvius J.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). In our study, we measured the same kinetic on-rates for all constructs (Lck-YFP, Lck-C3A-mGFP, Lck-C5A-mGFP). Noting the high numbers of encounters required before stable membrane association, we ascribe the observed rate-limiting step to the palmitoylation of cytosolic, single-myristoylated Lck. The characteristic time for action of palmitoyl transferases to transfer the first palmitic acid can be thus estimated by 400 ms. To point out that palmitoylation of the soluble versus the membrane-anchored protein may proceed with different kinetics, we discriminated the rate constants kPAT,1 and kPAT.For the point mutants C3A and C5A, membrane association is terminated by the liberation of the mono-palmitate; we can therefore estimate the characteristic time constant for the action of the involved palmitoyl thioesterases by 1/kThio ∼7–9 s. For the wild-type construct Lck-YFP, mono-palmitoylation may be followed either by palmitoylation at the remaining free cysteine or by liberation of the attached palmitic acid. Note that according to the ∼6-fold difference in the rate constants of the mutants versus wild-type Lck, the likelihood for attachment of the second palmitic acid is much higher than for the removal of the mono-palmitate by thioesterases. The most probable state will thus be a double palmitoylated molecule. In consequence, wild-type Lck shows a much higher stability in the plasma membrane. We solved the model analytically (Equation 6). From the experimentally determined parameters for kThio (8 s)and koff (50 s), we estimated the average time constant for addition of the second palmitic acid, 1/kPAT ∼700 ms. This value is only slightly higher than the on-rate of Lck to the membrane; the difference may be due to the slower diffusion of the membrane-anchored protein compared with the cytosolic form, which thus will require a longer time until collision with a palmitoyl transferase.Up to now, there is rather limited knowledge on the kinetics of protein palmitoylation or depalmitoylation, because of the limited time resolution of pulse-chase experiments. For Lck, Paige et al. (43.Paige L.A. Nadler M.J. Harrison M.L. Cassady J.M. Geahlen R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8669-8674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported a turnover of palmitate within 60 min. For a G-protein α-subunit, palmitate turnover with a half-life shorter than 2 min was estimated (44.Wedegaertner P.B. Bourne H.R. Cell. 1994; 77: 1063-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). We show here that the kinetics can actually be much faster and that triple acylation represents another means to fine-tune the lifetime of the protein at the plasma membrane.15 years ago, palmitoylation-depalmitoylation cycles were speculated to be responsible for the subcellular localization of intracellular proteins in general (42.Shahinian S. Silvius J.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), which was recently confirmed experimentally for the Ras protein (45.Rocks O. Peyker A. Kahms M.

Rogers C. Wright L. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Philips M.R. Kenworthy A.K. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Exchange of Ras proteins between the plasma membrane and intracellular organelles enables the differential activity responses of Ras isoforms. An analogous mechanism appears to control Lck: within milliseconds, Lck can be anchored in the plasma membrane for modification of its own activity or that of substrates and can be released with similar speed to shut down this process or transport activated/modified Lck to other reaction centers in the cell. Therefore, we speculate that this high-speed shuttle of Lck between the cytosol and the plasma membrane may provide a primary way to regulate the enzyme, in addition to (de)phosphorylation of the known activation motifs.

Cell Biol. 2008; 182: 765-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). All these types of motion can be regarded as two-dimensional, i.e. the path of the molecule is restricted to the plasma membrane surface. However, in particular for membrane proteins located in the cytosolic leaflet, the assumption that the molecular path is restricted to a two-dimensional plane may not be fully justified. For example, protein palmitoylation is reversible, and it can thus be expected to result in reversible plasma membrane association of molecules (16.Bijlmakers M.J. Marsh M. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 32-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). In addition, vice versa, plasma membrane association of a cytosolic protein could be enabled e.g. by acylation via a membrane-bound acyltransferase (17.Roth A.F. Feng Y. Chen L. Davis N.G. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). So in many cases, protein association with or dissociation from the membrane plane may well contribute to the observable path as well as function of the molecule.Our knowledge of exchange between cytosolic- and membrane-associated fractions of proteins is still rather poor, mainly because of difficulties in determining the turnover rates. Henis et al. (18.Henis Y.I. Rotblat B. Kloog Y. Methods. 2006; 40: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) described an approach based on Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP), in which the dependence of recovery rates on the beam size was used to discriminate between recovery by lateral diffusion and by exchange with cytosolic pools. Hammond et al. (19.Hammond G.R. Sim Y. Lagnado L. Irvine R.F. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 184: 297-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) analyzed the shape of the recovering intensity profile to quantify the off-rate between GFP-labeled pleckstrin homology domains of cytosolic effector molecules and the polyphosphorylated membrane inositols PtdInsP2 and PtdInsP3. Mashanov et al. (20.Mashanov G.I. Tacon D. Peckham M. Molloy J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15274-15280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) determined the lifetime of GFP-labeled pleckstrin homology domain at the plasma membrane directly by measuring the length of single-molecule trajectories between association and dissociation, including a correction for photobleaching effects. This approach proved valid and suitable for immobile proteins, but is difficult to implement in the case of mobile proteins: single-molecule trajectories may be truncated not only because of dissociation or photobleaching of the molecule, but also fluorophore blinking (21.Dickson R.M. Cubitt A.B. Tsien R.Y. Moerner W.E. Nature. 1997; 388: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar), due to tracking ambiguities in case of overlapping segments or simply the movement of the molecule out of the observation window. In a recent study, Knight and Falke (22.Knight J.D. Falke J.J. Biophys. J. 2009; 96: 566-582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) took a further step by combining single-molecule tracking with total internal reflection (TIR) excitation to study the docking of purified pleckstrin homology domain to artificial supported lipid bilayers.We present here an approach to study molecular exchange between the plasma membrane and the cytosol in living cells, which enables in particular the analysis of mobile proteins. It combines the advantages of TIR excitation, FRAP, and single-molecule tracking in a single assay and extends our previously introduced method for “thinning out clusters while conserving the stoichiometry of labeling” (TOCCSL) (23.Moertelmaier M. Brameshuber M. Linimeier M. Schütz G.J. Stockinger H. Appl. Phys. Lett. 2005; 87: 263903Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Upon photobleaching of the bottom plasma membrane via an evanescent field, the first molecules entering the bleached regions are analyzed. In this configuration, the exchange from cytosolic pools can be easily discriminated from the recovery of membrane-anchored molecules via the spatial profile of the recovery signal. When performed at the single-molecule level, the method enables a more detailed analysis of the recovering species: for example, mobility analysis allows for identifying and counting those molecules that have inserted into the plasma membrane during the time course of the recovery process.We used the method to address the exchange dynamics of Lck, the major Src family tyrosine kinase in early T cell signaling (24.Davis M.M. Krogsgaard M. Huse M. Huppa J. Lillemeier B.F. Li Q.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 25: 681-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Lck is membrane-anchored via N-terminal palmitoylation of the two cysteines at positions 3 and 5 and myristoylation of glycine 2. Double palmitoylation was shown to be required to fully target the protein to the plasma membrane and to function properly in T cell signaling (25.Kabouridis P.S. Magee A.I. Ley S.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4983-4998Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Frequently, we and others (26.Bijlmakers M.J. Marsh M. J.

Here, we directly recorded the insertion of cytosolic Lck, quantified the association rate, and provided an estimate of the lifetime of Lck in the plasma membrane, assuming steady state conditions. Experiments on palmitoylation-deficient mutants yielded a dramatically increased off-rate and were interpreted on the basis of a model that explicitly accounts for reversible acylation on cysteines 3 and 5."

However, the role of its individual components in the pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy remains unclear. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, we investigated whether MEF2C plays a role in mediating the left ventricular hypertrophy by pressure overload in mice. The knockdown of myocardial MEF2C induced by specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) has been shown to attenuate hypertrophy, interstitial fibrosis and the rise of ANP levels in aortic banded mice. We detected that the depletion of MEF2C also results in lowered levels of both PGC-1α and mitochondrial DNA in the overloaded left ventricle, associated with enhanced AMP:ATP ratio. Additionally, MEF2C depletion was accompanied by defective activation of S6K in response to pressure overload. Treatment with the amino acid leucine stimulated S6K and suppressed the attenuation of left ventricular hypertrophy and fibrosis in the aforementioned aortic banded mice. Conclusion/Significance These findings represent new evidences that MEF2C depletion attenuates the hypertrophic responses to mechanical stress and highlight the potential of MEF2C to be a target for new therapies to cardiac hypertrophy and failure."
https://openalex.org/W1993828353,"Background Four genome-wide association studies mapped an “obesity” gene to human chromosome 10p11–12. As the zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) transcription factor is encoded by the TCF8 gene located in that region, and as it influences the differentiation of various mesodermal lineages, we hypothesized that ZEB1 might also modulate adiposity. The goal of these studies was to test that hypothesis in mice. Methodology/Principal Findings To ascertain whether fat accumulation affects ZEB1 expression, female C57BL/6 mice were fed a regular chow diet (RCD) ad libitum or a 25% calorie-restricted diet from 2.5 to 18.3 months of age. ZEB1 mRNA levels in parametrial fat were six to ten times higher in the obese mice. To determine directly whether ZEB1 affects adiposity, wild type (WT) mice and mice heterozygous for TCF8 (TCF8+/−) were fed an RCD or a high-fat diet (HFD) (60% calories from fat). By two months of age on an HFD and three months on an RCD, TCF8+/− mice were heavier than WT controls, which was attributed by Echo MRI to increased fat mass (at three months on an HFD: 0.517±0.081 total fat/lean mass versus 0.313±0.036; at three months on an RCD: 0.175±0.013 versus 0.124±0.012). No differences were observed in food uptake or physical activity, suggesting that the genotypes differ in some aspect of their metabolic activity. ZEB1 expression also increases during adipogenesis in cell culture. Conclusion/Significance These results show for the first time that the ZEB1 transcription factor regulates the accumulation of adipose tissue. Furthermore, they corroborate the genome-wide association studies that mapped an “obesity” gene at chromosome 10p11–12."
https://openalex.org/W2108206551,"With age and menopause there is a shift in adipose distribution from gluteo-femoral to abdominal depots in women. Associated with this redistribution of fat are increased risks of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Glucocorticoids influence body composition, and 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11βHSD1) which converts inert cortisone to active cortisol is a putative key mediator of metabolic complications in obesity. Increased 11βHSD1 in adipose tissue may contribute to postmenopausal central obesity. We hypothesized that tissue-specific 11βHSD1 gene expression and activity are up-regulated in the older, postmenopausal women compared to young, premenopausal women. Twenty-three pre- and 23 postmenopausal, healthy, normal weight women were recruited. The participants underwent a urine collection, a subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsy and the hepatic 11βHSD1 activity was estimated by the serum cortisol response after an oral dose of cortisone. Urinary (5α-tetrahydrocortisol+5β-tetrahydrocortisol)/tetrahydrocortisone ratios were higher in postmenopausal women versus premenopausal women in luteal phase (P<0.05), indicating an increased whole-body 11βHSD1 activity. Postmenopausal women had higher 11βHSD1 gene expression in subcutaneous fat (P<0.05). Hepatic first pass conversion of oral cortisone to cortisol was also increased in postmenopausal women versus premenopausal women in follicular phase of the menstrual cycle (P<0.01, at 30 min post cortisone ingestion), suggesting higher hepatic 11βHSD1 activity. In conclusion, our results indicate that postmenopausal normal weight women have increased 11βHSD1 activity in adipose tissue and liver. This may contribute to metabolic dysfunctions with menopause and ageing in women."
https://openalex.org/W2057947694,"Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS), a common, chronic, widespread musculoskeletal pain disorder found in 2% of the general population and with a preponderance of 85% in females, has both genetic and environmental contributions. Patients and their parents have high plasma levels of the chemokines MCP-1 and eotaxin, providing evidence for both a genetic and an immunological/inflammatory origin for the syndrome (Zhang et al., 2008, Exp. Biol. Med. 233: 1171-1180).In a search for a candidate gene affecting inflammatory pathways, among five screened in our patient samples (100 probands with FMS and their parents), we found 10 rare and one common alleles for MEFV, a gene in which various compound heterozygous mutations lead to Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF). A total of 2.63 megabases of genomic sequence of the MEFV gene were scanned by direct sequencing. The collection of rare missense mutations (all heterozygotes and tested in the aggregate) had a significant elevated frequency of transmission to affecteds (p = 0.0085, one-sided, exact binomial test). Our data provide evidence that rare missense variants of the MEFV gene are, collectively, associated with risk of FMS and are present in a subset of 15% of FMS patients. This subset had, on average, high levels of plasma IL-1beta (p = 0.019) compared to FMS patients without rare variants, unaffected family members with or without rare variants, and unrelated controls of unknown genotype. IL-1beta is a cytokine associated with the function of the MEFV gene and thought to be responsible for its symptoms of fever and muscle aches.Since misregulation of IL-1beta expression has been predicted for patients with mutations in the MEFV gene, we conclude that patients heterozygous for rare missense variants of this gene may be predisposed to FMS, possibly triggered by environmental factors."
https://openalex.org/W1966634271,"Formation, degradation and renewal of cellular organelles is a dynamic process based on permanent budding, fusion and inter-organelle traffic of vesicles. These processes include many regulatory proteins such as SNAREs, Rabs and coats. Given this complex machinery, a controversially debated issue is the definition of a minimal set of generic mechanisms necessary to enable the self-organization of organelles differing in number, size and chemical composition. We present a conceptual mathematical model of dynamic organelle formation based on interacting vesicles which carry different types of fusogenic proteins (FP) playing the role of characteristic marker proteins. Our simulations (ODEs) show that a de novo formation of non-identical organelles, each accumulating a different type of FP, requires a certain degree of disproportionation of FPs during budding. More importantly however, the fusion kinetics must indispensably exhibit positive cooperativity among these FPs, particularly for the formation of larger organelles. We compared different types of cooperativity: sequential alignment of corresponding FPs on opposite vesicle/organelles during fusion and pre-formation of FP-aggregates (equivalent, e.g., to SNARE clusters) prior to fusion described by Hill kinetics. This showed that the average organelle size in the system is much more sensitive to the disproportionation strength of FPs during budding if the vesicular transport system gets along with a fusion mechanism based on sequential alignments of FPs. Therefore, pre-formation of FP aggregates within the membranes prior to fusion introduce robustness with respect to organelle size. Our findings provide a plausible explanation for the evolution of a relatively large number of molecules to confer specificity on the fusion machinery compared to the relatively small number involved in the budding process. Moreover, we could speculate that a specific cooperativity which may be described by Hill kinetics (aggregates or Rab/SNARE complex formation) is suitable if maturation/identity switching of organelles play a role (bistability)."
https://openalex.org/W2145303844,"Background The distribution of Palmer's oak (Quercus palmeri Engelm.) includes numerous isolated populations that are presumably relicts of a formerly larger range that has contracted due to spreading aridity following the end of the Pleistocene. Principal Findings We investigated a recently discovered disjunct population of Palmer's oak in the Jurupa Mountains of Riverside County, California. Patterns of allozyme polymorphism, morphological homogeneity, widespread fruit abortion, and evidence of fire resprouting all strongly support the hypothesis that the population is a single clone. The size of the clone and estimates of annual growth from multiple populations lead us to conclude that the clone is in excess of 13,000 years old. Conclusions The ancient age of the clone implies it originated during the Pleistocene and is a relict of a vanished vegetation community. Range contraction after climate change best explains the modern disjunct distribution of Q. palmeri and perhaps other plants in California."
https://openalex.org/W1981529364,"The molecular clock of mitochondrial DNA has been extensively used to date various genetic events. However, its substitution rate among humans appears to be higher than rates inferred from human-chimpanzee comparisons, limiting the potential of interspecies clock calibrations for intraspecific dating. It is not well understood how and why the substitution rate accelerates. We have analyzed a phylogenetic tree of 3057 publicly available human mitochondrial DNA coding region sequences for changes in the ratios of mutations belonging to different functional classes. The proportion of non-synonymous and RNA genes substitutions has reduced over hundreds of thousands of years. The highest mutation ratios corresponding to fast acceleration in the apparent substitution rate of the coding sequence have occurred after the end of the Last Ice Age. We recalibrate the molecular clock of human mtDNA as 7990 years per synonymous mutation over the mitochondrial genome. However, the distribution of substitutions at synonymous sites in human data significantly departs from a model assuming a single rate parameter and implies at least 3 different subclasses of sites. Neutral model with 3 synonymous substitution rates can explain most, if not all, of the apparent molecular clock difference between the intra- and interspecies levels. Our findings imply the sluggishness of purifying selection in removing the slightly deleterious mutations from the human as well as the Neandertal and chimpanzee populations. However, for humans, the weakness of purifying selection has been further exacerbated by the population expansions associated with the out-of Africa migration and the end of the Last Ice Age."

One member of the E2F family, E2F1, also has the paradoxical ability to induce apoptosis; however, the mechanisms underlying this selectivity are not fully understood. We now identify a nucleolar protein, RRP1B, as an E2F1-specific transcriptional target. We characterize the RRP1B promoter and demonstrate its selective response to E2F1. Consistent with the activation of E2F1 activity upon DNA damage, RRP1B is induced by several DNA-damaging agents. Importantly, RRP1B is required for the expression of certain E2F1 proapoptotic target genes and the induction of apoptosis by DNA-damaging agents. This activity is mediated in part by complex formation between RRP1B and E2F1 on selective E2F1 target gene promoters. Interaction between RRP1B and E2F1 can be found inside the nucleolus and diffuse nucleoplasmic punctates.

Methods and Findings In 1998, 881 primary care patients with T2DM aged 60 years and older participated in the ZODIAC study, a prospective observational study. The cohort was divided into two age categories: 60–75 years and older than 75 years. Updated means of all lipid profile indices were calculated after a median follow-up time of 9.8 years. These values were used as time dependent covariates in a Cox proportional hazard model. The cholesterol-HDL ratio and LDL-cholesterol were positively related to both all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in the low age group. In contrast, except for the triglyceride level, none of the other lipid profile indices were related to all-cause mortality in patients aged over 75 years. The mortality risk decreased by 17% (95%CI: 5% to 27%) for each 1 mmol/L higher serum level of triglycerides. The relationships between the various lipid profile indices and cardiovascular mortality were not significant. However, the results were different after stratification for diabetes duration. In the subgroup of elderly patients with a diabetes duration of 8 years and longer, higher lipids were predictive of increased cardiovascular mortality. The main limitation of this study is its observational design, which prevents us drawing conclusions about causality. Conclusion Although the lipid profile was not predictive in the overall group of elderly patients, higher lipids were related to increased cardiovascular mortality in patients with diabetes of long duration. In order to make valid recommendations concerning lipid-lowering treatment, a randomized controlled trial or a meta-analysis concerning this specific population is mandatory."
https://openalex.org/W2000129516,"Prediction markets are powerful forecasting tools. They have the potential to aggregate private information, to generate and disseminate a consensus among the market participants, and to provide incentives for information acquisition. These market functionalities can be very valuable for scientific research. Here, we report an experiment that examines the compatibility of prediction markets with the current practice of scientific publication. We investigated three settings. In the first setting, different pieces of information were disclosed to the public during the experiment. In the second setting, participants received private information. In the third setting, each piece of information was private at first, but was subsequently disclosed to the public. An automated, subsidizing market maker provided additional incentives for trading and mitigated liquidity problems. We find that the third setting combines the advantages of the first and second settings. Market performance was as good as in the setting with public information, and better than in the setting with private information. In contrast to the first setting, participants could benefit from information advantages. Thus the publication of information does not detract from the functionality of prediction markets. We conclude that for integrating prediction markets into the practice of scientific research it is of advantage to use subsidizing market makers, and to keep markets aligned with current publication practice."
https://openalex.org/W2036912862,"Human erythrocytes have been regarded as perfect osmometers, which swell or shrink as dictated by their osmotic environment. In contrast, in most other cells, swelling elicits a regulatory volume decrease (RVD) modulated by the activation of purinic and pyrimidinic receptors (P receptors). For human erythrocytes this modulation has not been tested, and we thus investigated whether P receptor activation can induce RVD in these cells. Further, because ectonucleotidases may scavenge ATP or ADP or act as a source for extracellular adenosine and therefore modulate P receptor activation and RVD, we also determined their activity in intact erythrocytes. We found relatively low ectoATPase but significant ectoADPase and ectoAMPase activities. When erythrocytes were exposed to hypotonic medium alone, they swelled as expected for an osmometric response and showed no RVD. Activation of P2 receptors by exogenous ATP or ADP did not trigger RVD, whereas P1 agonists adenosine and adenosine-5′-N-ethylcarboxamide induced significant RVD. The effect of adenosine-5′-N-ethylcarboxamide was dose-dependent (maximal RVD of 27%; apparent K½ of 1.6 ± 1.7 μm). The RVD induced by adenosine was blocked 80% with the non-selective P1 antagonist 8-(p-sulfophenyl theophylline) or the P1-A2B inhibitor MRS1754, but not by inhibitors of P1 subtypes A1, A2A, and A3. In addition, forskolin (an inducer of intracellular cAMP formation) could mimic the effect of adenosine, supporting the idea of P1-A2B receptor activation. In conclusion, we report a novel P1-A2B receptor-mediated RVD activation in mature human erythrocytes and thus indicate that these long held perfect osmometers are not so perfect after all.

Animal cells are much more permeable to water than to osmolytes. In consequence, a reduction of extracellular osmolarity or an increase in the intracellular osmolarity leads to a net influx of water and fast cell swelling. Because cells can only expand to a certain limit before bursting, it is essential to counteract this osmotic swelling. This is usually accomplished in a process termed regulatory volume decrease (RVD), 4The abbreviations used are: RVDregulatory volume decreaseRBCred blood cellATPγSadenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate)2Mes-ADP2-methylthioadenosine 5-diphosphateNECAadenosine-5′-N-ethylcarboxamide8-SPT8-sulfophenyl theophyllineDPCPX8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthineBCECF2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxifluoresceinHYPOhypotonic mediumADOadenosineectoATPaseectoadenosine triphosphate hydrolaseectoADPaseectoadenosine diphosphate hydrolaseectoAMPaseectoadenosine monophosphate hydrolase. where intracellular osmolarity is reduced by the release of organic and inorganic osmolytes from the cell, together with osmotically obliged water and the concomitant reduction of cell volume (1.Lang F.

Although RVD is observable in almost all animal cells, the mature anucleated mammalian erythrocyte appears to lack mechanisms of volume regulation. This is why as early as 1950 Eric Ponder postulated that, within certain limits normal human red blood cells exist in osmotic equilibrium with their solvent environments and behave as near-ideal volume osmometers (2.Ponder E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1951; 34: 567-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Early studies on red blood cells (RBCs) from normal adults, children, and newborn infants, varying considerably in size, shape, and hemoglobin content, showed a close agreement between the cell volume values for an expected osmometric response and the average cell volumes determined at each tonicity (3.Guest G.M. Wing M. J. Clin. Invest. 1942; 21: 257-262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Guest M.M. Murphy R.C. Bodnar S.R. Ware A.G. Seegers W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1947; 150: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). This lack of RVD is quite exceptional given that erythrocytes from almost all other vertebrate species studied so far display a measurable volume regulation (5.Cala P.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1977; 69: 537-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 6.O'Neill W.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: C858-C864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Garcia-Romeu F. Cossins A.R. Motais R. J.

Gronau R.T. Baumann N.L. J. Membr. Biol. 2001; 182: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The swelling activated response usually involves an increase of KCl co-transport, as in duck, sheep, rabbit, and mouse red cells (10.Lauf P.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 245: C445-C448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Haas M. Harrison Jr., J.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: C265-C272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but may also involve formation of a channel that mediates the efflux of osmolytes such as taurine, as in red cells from skate and trout (7.Garcia-Romeu F. Cossins A.R. Motais R. J. Physiol. 1991; 440: 547-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 12.Musch M.W. Puffer A.B. Goldstein L. Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2008; 294: R1657-R1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In human RBCs, however, volume-sensitive efflux of KCl and RVD appear to be restricted to reticulocytes, which, under normal conditions, comprise only 0.5–1.5% of the whole erythrocyte population. Also, mouse anion exchanger band3/AE1 protein, the homolog of which is involved in RVD of trout erythrocytes (13.Garcia-Romeu F. Borgese F. Guizouarn H. Fiévet B. Motais R. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 42: 985-994PubMed Google Scholar), when expressed in Xenopus oocytes displays neither channel activity nor transport of organic osmolytes. This was consistent with the current idea that transport pathways for RVD remain inactivated in mature mammalian RBCs (14.Guizouarn H. Gabillat N. Motais R. Borgese F. J. Physiol. 2001; 535: 497-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In contrast, in isotonic conditions mammalian erythrocytes are capable of losing water via KCl co-transport activity as well as Ca2+-activated K+ channels known as Gardos Channels (KCNN4 (15.Hoffman J.F. Joiner W. Nehrke K. Potapova O. Foye K. Wickrema A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 7366-7371Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar)). Although these findings established an empirical and theoretical basis to explain the lack of volume regulation of mature mammalian erythrocytes, several lines of evidence demonstrated that, not only the absence or presence of effector mechanisms, but also signaling events have to be taken into account. Specifically, it was shown by Wang et al. (16.Wang Y. Roman R. Lidofsky S.D. Fitz J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 12020-12025Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) that swollen hepatoma cells required endogenous extracellular ATP to down-regulate cell volume (16.Wang Y. Roman R. Lidofsky S.D. Fitz J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 12020-12025Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Further examples of ATP-induced volume regulation were observed in nucleated erythrocytes from the salamander Necturus (9.Light D.B. Dahlstrom P.K. Gronau R.T. Baumann N.L. J. Membr. Biol. 2001; 182: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and in hepatocytes, endothelial cells, astrocytes, and epithelial cells from human and several other mammalian species (1.Lang F. Busch G.L. Ritter M. Völkl H. Waldegger S. Gulbins E. Häussinger D. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 247-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1592) Google Scholar). Similarly, RVD was activated by UTP in salivary gland duct cells (17.Kim H.D. Bowen J.W. James-Kracke M.R. Landon L.A. Camden J.M. Burnett J.E. Turner J.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C86-C97Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and by ATP, UTP, UDP, or ATPγS in trout and goldfish hepatocytes (18.Pafundo D.E. Mut P. Pérez Recalde M. González-Lebrero R.M. Fachino V. Krumschnabel G. Schwarzbaum P.J. Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2004; 287: R833-R843Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 19.Pafundo D.E. Chara O. Faillace M.P. Krumschnabel G. Schwarzbaum P.J. Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2008; 294: R220-R233Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Moreover, extracellular adenosine, derived from hydrolysis of extracellular ATP, was shown to inhibit RVD via P1 activation in fish hepatocytes (18.Pafundo D.E. Mut P. Pérez Recalde M. González-Lebrero R.M. Fachino V. Krumschnabel G. Schwarzbaum P.J. Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2004; 287: R833-R843Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 19.Pafundo D.E.

Thus, it seems clear that understanding volume regulation requires an understanding of events involved in nucleoside signaling on the cell surface. The main players in this regard appear to be extracellular nucleotides, cell surface P receptors (including purinic and pyrimidinic receptors; see Ref. 20.Lazarowski E.R. Boucher R.C. Harden T.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 785-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar), and ectonucleotidases. In mammals, 19 P receptors have been cloned, which belong to two main categories, i.e. P1 receptors with high affinity for adenosine and P2 receptors preferentially binding nucleoside di- and triphosphates (21.Ralevic V. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 413-492PubMed Google Scholar). The P2 receptors have been further subdivided into P2X (ligand-gated ion channels) and P2Y (receptors coupled to a G-protein). Although P receptors are ubiquitous in almost every cell system, there is little information concerning their presence in vertebrate erythrocytes. In human mature RBCs the ADP receptor sub-type P2Y13 is the most abundantly expressed on the mRNA level, whereas other P2 receptors (P2Y1, P2Y2, P2Y4, P2Y6, P2Y11, P2Y12, P2X1, P2X4, and P2X7) display very low levels (22.Sluyter R. Shemon A.N. Barden J.A. Wiley J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44749-44755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 23.Wang L. Olivecrona G. Götberg M. Olsson M.L. Winzell M.S. Erlinge D. Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Up to date, P1 receptors have not been studied in this cell system. In human blood, several processes act to metabolize extracellular ATP; conversion of ATP to ADP and AMP is mainly promoted by the activities of ectonucleoside triphosphate dihydrolases (E-NTPDases) from leukocytes and endothelial cells, with little or no contribution of plasma, platelets, or erythrocytes. The dephosphorylation of AMP to adenosine is primarily mediated by a soluble 5′-nucleotidase of the plasma (24.Heptinstall S. Johnson A. Glenn J.R. White A.E. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2005; 3: 2331-2339Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Regardless of the bulk concentrations of nucleosides present in the plasma, P receptor signaling of erythrocytes will also depend on the capacity of ectonucleotidases present at the surface of these cells. Regarding this, isolated human erythrocytes display significant hydrolysis rates of extracellular AMP and ADP, and very low ectoATPase activity (25.Lüthje J. Klin. Wochenschr. 1989; 67: 317-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, no studies were made on ectonucleotidases of specific erythrocyte subpopulations that would allow discriminating between mature anucleated cells and reticulocytes. Based on the main processes that govern RVD as well as the homeostasis of extracellular nucleotides, a model for autocrine/paracrine modulation of RVD by ATP was proposed (26.Braunstein G.M. Roman R.M. Clancy J.P. Kudlow B.A. Taylor A.L. Shylonsky V.G. Jovov B. Peter K. Jilling T. Ismailov II, Benos D.J. Schwiebert L.M. Fitz J.G. Schwiebert E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6621-6630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In this model, cell swelling causes a non-lytic, regulated release of ATP, which would then stimulate specific P2 receptors and thereby activate the efflux of osmolytes and water, in this way promoting the recovery of cell volume (16.Wang Y. Roman R. Lidofsky S.D. Fitz J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 12020-12025Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). But although this is relatively well established, little is known regarding the potential action of P1 on volume regulation. This, however, would seem of importance, insofar as ATP can readily interconvert to its hydrolysis products in the extracellular space, and adenosine, derived from ATP, ADP, or AMP, may then accumulate in significant concentrations at the cell surface. For example, in pig red cells, adenosine and adenosine analogs were able to inhibit a volume-sensitive chloride-dependent K+ flux, although induction of the response required relatively long incubation times and millimolar concentrations that were several orders higher than the EC50 values of all known P1 receptors (27.Sohn D.H. Kim H.D. J. Cell Physiol. 1991; 146: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In airway epithelial cells ATP released upon swelling was rapidly hydrolyzed to adenosine, followed by adenosine activation of volume-sensitive anion channels. Unfortunately, the corresponding kinetics of cell volume was not studied (28.Musante L. Zegarra-Moran O. Montaldo P.G. Ponzoni M. Galietta L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11701-11707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In the present study we sought to investigate whether extracellular adenine nucleotides and adenosine are able to trigger RVD of mature human erythrocytes. Our approach included an assessment of time-dependent volume changes of cells in the presence of exogenous nucleosides, as well as the use of selective antagonists to identify the specific P receptor mediating the regulatory response. Furthermore, because extracellular nucleosides can be metabolized in the extracellular space, generating different P receptor agonists, we determined ectonucleotidase activities using intact cells. Poly-d-lysine, ATP, ADP, 2-methylthioadenosine 5-diphosphate (2MeS-ADP), AMP, adenosine, adenosine-5′-N-ethylcarboxamide (NECA), 8-sulfophenyl theophylline (8-SPT), 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX), nigericin, adenosine deaminase (type V), and Percoll were purchased from Sigma. 4-(2-{[5-Amino-2-(2-furyl)[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a][1,3,5]triazin-7-yl]amino}ethyl)phenol (ZM241385), 2-phenoxy-6-(cyclohexylamino)purine hemioxalate (MRS3777), and N-(4-cyanophenyl)-2-[4-(2,3,6,7-tetrahydro-2,6-dioxo-1,3-dipropyl- 1H-purin-8-yl)phenoxy]acetamide (MRS1754) were from Tocris Bioscience (Bristol, UK). The 2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxifluorescein, acetoxymethyl ester (BCECF-AM) was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). [γ-32P]ATP (5.4 Ci mg−1, ∼10 mCi ml−1) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. All other reagents were of analytical grade. Ten milliliters of heparinized blood was obtained from healthy volunteers who had not received a transfusion within 3 months. After blood centrifugation (900 × g at 25 °C for 3 min), plasma, platelets, and leukocytes were removed by pipetting, and erythrocytes were washed three times in RBC medium (in mm: 155 NaCl, 2.7 KCl, 1.5 KH2PO4, 2.5 Na2HPO4, 1 CaCl, 1 MgSO4, 5 glucose, pH = 7.4, 20 °C, osmolarity = 300 mosm). Final hematocrit was ∼45%. All experiments shown in this study were performed with a subpopulation of RBCs containing only anucleated mature erythrocytes isolated by means of a discontinuous Percoll density gradient (29.Venerando B. Fiorilli A. Croci G. Tringali C. Goi G. Mazzanti L. Curatola G. Segalini G. Massaccesi L. Lombardo A. Tettamanti G. Blood. 2002; 99: 1064-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, five solutions of modified RBC medium (in mm: 155 NaCl, 2.7 KCl, 1.5 KH2PO4, 2.5 Na2HPO4, 5 glucose, and 5% bovine serum albumin, pH = 7.4, 20 °C, osmolarity = 300 mosm) were prepared with a final Percoll concentration of 60%, 66%, 70%, 74, and 80% (density 1.087–1.098 g ml−1). Discontinuous Percoll gradients were made by careful manual pipetting of 1 ml of 80% solution, 3 ml of 74%, 3 ml of 70%, 3 ml of 66%, and 1.5 of ml 60%. Finally 1.5 ml of erythrocyte suspension containing ∼5.5–6.5 109 cells was seeded on top of the gradient. Centrifugation was carried out in a Sorvall RC-2B in a fixed angle rotor (SS-34) at 4000 × g for 15 min at 20 °C. Cell fractions were collected by aspiration, and the middle fractions (interphase 66–70% and 74–80%) were washed three times in RBC medium (900 × g at 25 °C for 3 min) to eliminate the remaining Percoll. In preliminary experiments no cells of these middle fractions stained with methylene blue, indicating that no reticulocytes were present (30.Mel H.C. Prenant M. Mohandas N. Blood. 1977; 49: 1001-1009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In experiments of Fig. 1, where an assay medium lacking phosphate was required, separation of the erythrocytes was followed by three washes of the cell suspension in RBC-Hepes medium (in mm: 130 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 1.5 CaCl, 1.1 MgSO4, 5 NaHCO3, 10 glucose, 20 HEPES, pH = 7.4, 20 °C, osmolarity = 300 mosm). To remove intracellular phosphate, cells were then incubated in RBC-Hepes for 1 h at 25 °C and then washed twice with RBC-Hepes. All procedures conformed to the Declaration of Helsinki, and written informed consent was given by the subjects. Red blood cells do not take up ATP, ADP, or AMP. Therefore, following addition of adenine nucleotides to a cells suspension, the rate of phosphate accumulation in the medium is a measure of ectoATPase (from ATP), ectoADPase (from ADP), and ectoAMPase (from AMP) activities. EctoATPase activity was determined by following the release of [γ-32P]Pi from [γ-32P]ATP as described before (31.Schwarzbaum P.J. Kaufman S.B. Rossi R.C. Garrahan P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1233: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 32.Schwarzbaum P.J. Frischmann M.E. Krumschnabel G. Rossi R.C. Wieser W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: R1031-R1038Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, the reaction was started by adding 300 μm [γ-32P]ATP to cell suspensions (20% average hematocrit) at 20 °C under continuous stirring. At different times, a 200-μl aliquot of the suspension was withdrawn and centrifuged at 20,000 × g during 30 s, and 100 μl of the supernatant were poured into 750 μl of a stop solution containing 4.05 mm Mo7O24(NH4)6 and 0.83 mm HClO4. The ammonium molybdate solution formed a complex with the released phosphate, which was then extracted by adding 0.6 ml of isobutyl alcohol under vigorous stirring. After the phases were separated by centrifugation for 5 min at 1,000 × g, aliquots of 200 μl of the organic phase containing [γ-32]Pi were transferred to vials containing 2.5 ml of 0.5 m NaOH. Radioactivity was measured by using the Cerenkov effect. EctoADPase and ectoAMPase activities were determined with a malachite green method (33.Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1821) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell suspensions (15% average hematocrit) were incubated with 300 μm of ADP or AMP at 20 °C under continuous agitation. At the indicated times, 200-μl aliquots were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 s, and 150 μl of the supernatant was mixed with 650 μl of ice-cold bidistilled water. 200 μl of the malachite green reagent (containing 3.05 mm malachite green, 4.72 n H2SO4, 12 mm Mo7O24(NH4)6, and 0.16% Tween 20) were added, followed by 100 μl of 1.37 m Na+ citrate. Solutions were incubated at 20 °C for 30 min, and absorbance was determined at 630 nm. Absorbance values were converted to phosphate concentration by means of a calibration curve (2–20 nmol of Pi ml−1). In both methods, care was taken to obtain initial rate values. Values of phosphate concentration in assay medium lacking cells were subtracted from the phosphate accumulation in the presence of cells at each time point. Although phosphate content in the absence of cells was higher than zero, it did not increase with time, i.e. phosphate production was negligible. Relative cell volumes before and after osmotic cell swelling were estimated at room temperature by two different methods as follows. Under certain conditions fluorescence intensity decreases with the increase in fluorophore concentration. This quenching property can be used for measuring water volume changes in cells (34.Hamann S. Herrera-Perez J.J. Bundgaard M. Alvarez-Leefmans F.J. Zeuthen T. J. Physiol. 2005; 568: 123-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In the following, a brief description of the method used to estimate cell volume by fluorescence quenching of BCECF-loaded erythrocytes is given. Human erythrocytes (3.5 × 106) were attached to 0.001% poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips. At this very low concentration of poly-d-lysine cells remain discoidal in shape (35.Hategan A. Law R. Kahn S. Discher D.E. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 2746-2759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Erythrocytes were incubated with RBC medium containing 5 μm BCECF-AM during 60 min at 20 °C. Subsequently, the solution was washed with RBC medium for 30 min to eliminate extracellular BCECF, and the coverslip was mounted on a recording chamber in a Nikon TE-200 epifluorescence inverted microscope. During experimental manipulations, all media were removed from or introduced in the chamber manually. Changes in cell water volume were inferred from readings of the fluorescence intensity recorded by exciting BCECF at 445 nm, where the fluorochrome is pH-insensitive (the isosbestic point; see below). In preliminary experiments erythrocytes were exposed to anisotonic solutions so as to alter cell volume. It was seen that, as cell volume increases, fluorescence intensity increased, and similarly, as cell volume decreases, fluorescence intensity decreased with increasing fluorophore concentration. Thus, the directly proportional relationship between fluorescence intensity and cell volume was interpreted as a result of fluorescence quenching, and changes in fluorescence intensity recorded from a small region of dye-loaded cells (pinhole) reflect alterations of cell water volume. As an example, Fig. 2B shows results of relative cell volume (Vr) versus relative osmolarity of erythrocytes exposed to hypotonic media from the experiments performed in this report. Fluorescence images were acquired by use of a charge-coupled device camera (Hamamatsu C4742–95) and the Metafluor acquisition program (Universal Imaging). Calibration was performed by sequentially exposing cells to assay media of osmolarities of ∼300, 285, 270, and 255 mosm. The hypotonic media for cell volume calibrations and HYPO medium had a similar composition as isotonic RBC medium, except that the NaCl concentration was lower. Values of relative cell volume (Vr) were obtained from the relative fluorescence (Ft/F0), with F0 representing the signal obtained from a pinhole region of the cell equilibrated with isotonic medium, and Ft denoting the fluorescence of the same region of the cell at time t. Thus Vr represents a fractional volume, where the initial isotonic cell volume value is 1, and volume changes are expressed as relative to the initial value. In some cases we found small but constant changes in fluorescence intensity in individual cells that can be due to a leak and/or photobleaching of the fluorophore. When this happened, the drift in fluorescent intensity was corrected using data from isotonic exposure. In other cases, individual cells had a non-constant change in fluorescence intensity or a fast loss of fluorescence intensity, a process compatible with a fast increase in plasma membrane permeability, and cell death. These cells were not used for analysis. Examples of these considerations can be found in supplemental Fig. S1. Because BCECF is sensitive to pH, knowledge of the precise isosbestic point is critical to avoid pH interference on the volume signal. Therefore, pH-dependent changes of BCECF spectra were analyzed as follows. Suspensions of human erythrocytes (1% hematocrit) were incubated with RBC containing 5 μm BCECF during 60 min, and then washed three times by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 s. Afterward the cells were incubated in 300 μl of modified RBC containing 1 μm of the K+/H+ exchanger nigericin and a KCl concentration similar to the cytoplasmic K+ concentration. Under these conditions, this procedure assures rapid equilibration of K+ and H+ concentrations in the intra- and extracellular compartments, so that the values of intra- and extracellular pH are equal. For obtaining the spectra, erythrocyte suspensions (0.032% hematocrit) were incubated in an AMINCO-Bowman series 2 spectrofluorometer (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA) at 20 °C under constant agitation. For each run the pH of the extracellular solution was modified by HCl addition, and time measurements of fluorescent intensity were recorded at 530 ± 4 nm (with 490 ± 4 nm excitation wavelength) until a stationary value was achieved. Then, excitation spectra were recorded at 530 ± 4 nm with excitation wavelengths ranging from 300 ± 2 nm to 500 ± 2 nm. Cell suspensions (1.9–2.8 109 cells ml−1) were loaded into 80-μl capillary tubes (75 mm in length) and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 2 min. Relative volume was calculated from the relative length occupied by cells, as compared with total length of the suspension. The RVD associated with the cellular volumetric response was calculated by Equation 1, RVD=Vr(max)−Vr(t)Vr(max)−1×100(Eq. 1) where Vr(max) is the maximal value of Vr attained during hypotonic swelling, and Vr(t) represents the value of Vr observed at different times after reaching Vr(max). RVD thus denotes the magnitude of volume regulation, with 100% RVD indicating complete volume regulation. In all cases we calculated the extent of RVD observed 40 min after Vr(max). In experiments in Fig. 4, intact erythrocytes were used to assess the effect of exogenous NECA (0.5–4 μm) on RVD. Next, Equation 2 was fitted to experimental data, RVD=RVDHYPO+RVDmax[NECA]K1/2+[NECA](Eq. 2) where RVDmax denotes the apparent maximal RVD and K½ is the substrate concentration at which a half-maximal RVD is obtained under the specific conditions of the experiment. RVDHYPO represents the RVD obtained in the absence of extrinsic modulators. The absence or presence of RVD was evaluated by determining whether the slope of Vrversus time was significantly different from 0 (p < 0.05), using a Pearson correlation test. The effect of the different treatments on RVD was evaluated by means of one-way analysis of variance followed by a Tukey-Kramer test of multiple comparisons. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. In all of the experiments, number of cells (n) and number of independent preparations (N) are indicated. In light of the suggested role of ATP and its hydrolysis products in the volume regulatory response of RBCs, the first series of experiments investigated the capacity of these cells to hydrolyze adenine nucleotides by membrane-bound enzymes called ectonucleotidases. Because nucleotides, unlike adenosine, are not taken up by intact cells, the rate of extracellular hydrolysis is a measure of ectoATPase (from ATP), ectoADPase (from ADP), and ectoAMPase (from AMP) activities. In the presence of 300 μm of any of the nucleotides, Pi accumulation increased linearly (Fig. 1A). EctoATPase activity was 0.26 ± 0.04 nmol of Pi (1010 cells min)−1, whereas ectoADPase and ectoAMPase were 1.49 ± 0.29 nmol of"

No studies have investigated mitochondrial mutation in salivary gland adenoid cystic carcinomas.The entire mitochondrial genome of 22 salivary gland adenoid cystic carcinomas (ACC) of salivary glands and matched leukocyte DNA was sequenced to determine the frequency and distribution of mitochondrial mutations in ACC tumors.Seventeen of 22 ACCs (77%) carried mitochondrial mutations, ranging in number from 1 to 37 mutations. A disproportionate number of mutations occurred in the D-loop. Twelve of 17 tumors (70.6%) carried mutations resulting in amino acid changes of translated proteins. Nine of 17 tumors (52.9%) with a mutation carried an amino acid changing mutation in the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase (NADH) complex.Mitochondrial mutation is frequent in salivary ACCs. The high incidence of amino acid changing mutations implicates alterations in aerobic respiration in ACC carcinogenesis. D-loop mutations are of unclear significance, but may be associated with alterations in transcription or replication."
https://openalex.org/W1974930792,"Allergic reactions towards the birch major pollen allergen Bet v 1 are among the most common causes of spring pollinosis in the temperate climate zone of the Northern hemisphere. Natural Bet v 1 is composed of a complex mixture of different isoforms. Detailed analysis of recombinant Bet v 1 isoforms revealed striking differences in immunologic as well as allergenic properties of the molecules, leading to a classification of Bet v 1 isoforms into high, medium, and low IgE binding proteins. Especially low IgE binding Bet v 1 isoforms have been described as ideal candidates for desensitizing allergic patients with allergen specific immunotherapy (SIT). Since diagnosis and therapy of allergic diseases are highly dependent on recombinant proteins, continuous improvement of protein production is an absolute necessity.Therefore, two different methods for recombinant production of a low IgE binding Bet v 1 isoform were applied; one based on published protocols, the other by implementing latest innovations in protein production. Both batches of Bet v 1.0401 were extensively characterized by an array of physicochemical as well as immunological methods to compare protein primary structure, purity, quantity, folding, aggregation state, thermal stability, and antibody binding capacity.The experiments demonstrated that IgE antibody binding properties of recombinant isoallergens can be significantly influenced by the production method directly affecting possible clinical applications of the molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2113570296,"Regulatory T cells (Tregs) were shown to be central in maintaining immunological homeostasis and preventing the development of autoimmune diseases. Several subsets of Tregs have been identified to date; however, the dynamics of the interactions between these subsets, and their implications on their regulatory functions are yet to be elucidated.We employed a combination of mathematical modeling and frequent in vivo measurements of several T cell subsets. Healthy BALB/c mice received a single injection of either hCDR1--a tolerogenic peptide previously shown to induce Tregs, a control peptide or vehicle alone, and were monitored for 16 days. During this period, splenocytes from the treated mice were analyzed for the levels of CD4, CD25, CD8, CD28 and Foxp3. The collected data were then fitted to mathematical models, in order to test competing hypotheses regarding the interactions between the followed T cell subsets. In all 3 treatment groups, a significant, lasting, non-random perturbation of the immune system could be observed. Our analysis predicted the emergence of functional CD4 Tregs based on inverse oscillations of the latter and CD4(+)CD25(-) cells. Furthermore, CD4 Tregs seemed to require a sufficiently high level of CD8 Tregs in order to become functional, while conversion was unlikely to be their major source. Our results indicated in addition that Foxp3 is not a sufficient marker for regulatory activity.In this work, we unraveled the dynamics of the interplay between CD4, CD8 Tregs and effector T cells, using, for the first time, a mathematical-mechanistic perspective in the analysis of Treg kinetics. Furthermore, the results obtained from this interdisciplinary approach supported the notion that CD4 Tregs need to interact with CD8 Tregs in order to become functional. Finally, we generated predictions regarding the time-dependent function of Tregs, which can be further tested empirically in future work."
https://openalex.org/W2068972585,"Background The pharyngeal microcircuit of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans serves as a model for analysing neural network activity and is amenable to electrophysiological recording techniques. One such technique is the electropharyngeogram (EPG) which has provided insight into the genetic basis of feeding behaviour, neurotransmission and muscle excitability. However, the detailed manual analysis of the digital recordings necessary to identify subtle differences in activity that reflect modulatory changes within the underlying network is time consuming and low throughput. To address this we have developed an automated system for the high-throughput and discrete analysis of EPG recordings (AutoEPG). Methodology/Principal Findings AutoEPG employs a tailor made signal processing algorithm that automatically detects different features of the EPG signal including those that report on the relaxation and contraction of the muscle and neuronal activity. Manual verification of the detection algorithm has demonstrated AutoEPG is capable of very high levels of accuracy. We have further validated the software by analysing existing mutant strains with known pharyngeal phenotypes detectable by the EPG. In doing so, we have more precisely defined an evolutionarily conserved role for the calcium-dependent potassium channel, SLO-1, in modulating the rhythmic activity of neural networks. Conclusions/Significance AutoEPG enables the consistent analysis of EPG recordings, significantly increases analysis throughput and allows the robust identification of subtle changes in the electrical activity of the pharyngeal nervous system. It is anticipated that AutoEPG will further add to the experimental tractability of the C. elegans pharynx as a model neural circuit."
https://openalex.org/W1965973385,"SUMO proteins are small ubiquitin-related modifiers. All SUMOs are synthesized as propeptides that are post-translationally cleaved prior to conjugation. After processing, SUMOs become covalently conjugated to cellular targets through a pathway that is similar to ubiquitination. Ubiquitin like protein proteases/Sentrin specific proteases (Ulp/SENPs) mediate both processing and deconjugation of SUMOs. The action of Ulp/SENPs makes SUMOylation a highly dynamic post-translational modification. To investigate how Ulp/SENPs are regulated in a developmental context, we isolated and characterized all Ulp/SENPs in Xenopus laevis. Xenopus possess homologues of mammalian SENP3, 5, 6 and 7. All of these enzymes reacted with HA-tagged vinyl sulfone derivatives of SUMO-2 (HA-SU2-VS) but not SUMO-1 (HA-SU1-VS), suggesting that they act primarily on SUMO-2 and -3. In contrast, Xenopus possess a single member of the SENP1/SENP2 subfamily of Ulp/SENPs, most closely related to mammalian SENP1. Xenopus SENP1 reacted with HA-SU1-VS and HA-SU2-VS, suggesting that it acts on all SUMO paralogues. We analyzed the mRNA and protein levels for each of the Ulp/SENPs through development; we found that they show distinct patterns of expression that may involve both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. Finally, we have characterized the developmental function of the most abundant Ulp/SENP found within Xenopus eggs, SENP3. Depletion of SENP3 using morpholino antisense oligonucleotides (morpholinos) caused accumulation of high molecular weight SUMO-2/3 conjugated species, defects in developing embryos and changes in the expression of some genes regulated by the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) pathway. These findings collectively indicate that SUMO proteases are both highly regulated and essential for normal development."
https://openalex.org/W2073789869,"Background Adipose tissue grows by two mechanisms: hyperplasia (cell number increase) and hypertrophy (cell size increase). Thiazolidinediones are insulin-sensitizing peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonists that are known to affect the morphology of adipose tissue. Methodology In this study, adipose cell-size probability distributions were measured in six Zucker fa/fa rats over a period of 24 days, from four weeks of age, using micro-biopsies to obtain subcutaneous (inguinal) fat tissue from the animals. Three of the rats were gavaged daily with rosiglitazone, a thiazolidinedione, and three served as controls. These longitudinal probability distributions were analyzed to obtain the rate of increase in cell-size diameter in rosiglitazone-treated animals, and the hyperplasia induced by treatment quantitatively. Conclusions We found that treatment leads to hypertrophy that leads to an approximately linear rate of cell diameter increase (2 m/day), and that the hyperplasia evident in treated animals occurs largely within the first eight days of treatment. The availability of additional lipid storage due to treatment may alleviate lipotoxicity and thereby promote insulin sensitivity. The hypothesis that a TZD regimen involving repeated treatments of limited duration may suffice for improvements in insulin sensitivity merits further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W1979439559,"The regulated degradation of damaged or misfolded proteins, as well as down-regulation of key signaling proteins, within eukaryotic and bacterial cells is catalyzed primarily by large, ATP-dependent multimeric proteolytic complexes, termed proteasomes. Inhibition of proteasomal activity affects a wide variety of physiological and pathological processes, and was found to be particularly effective for cancer therapy. We report here on the development of a novel high throughput assay for proteasome inhibition using a unique, highly sensitive live-cell screening, based on the cytoplasm-to-nucleus translocation of a fluorescent proteasome inhibition reporter (PIR) protein, consisting of nuclear localization signal-deficient p53 derivative. We further show here that mdm2, a key negative regulator of p53 plays a key role in the accumulation of PIR in the nucleus upon proteasome inhibition. Using this assay, we have screened the NCI Diversity Set library, containing 1,992 low molecular weight synthetic compounds, and identified four proteasome inhibitors. The special features of the current screen, compared to those of other approaches are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2033895570,"In humans, defects in lipid metabolism are associated with a number of severe diseases such as atherosclerosis, obesity and type II diabetes. Hypercholesterolemia is a primary risk factor for coronary artery disease, the major cause of premature deaths in developed countries. Statins are inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR), the key enzyme of the sterol synthesis pathway. Since yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae harbours many counterparts of mammalian enzymes involved in lipid-synthesizing pathways, conclusions drawn from research with this single cell eukaryotic organism can be readily applied to higher eukaryotes. Using a yeast strain with deletions of both HMG1 and HMG2 genes (i.e. completely devoid of HMGR activity) with introduced wild-type or mutant form of human HMGR (hHMGR) gene we investigated the effects of statins on the lipid metabolism of the cell. The relative quantification of mRNA demonstrated a different effect of simvastatin on the expression of the wild-type and mutated hHMGR gene. GC/MS analyses showed a significant decrease of sterols and enhanced conversion of squalene and sterol precursors into ergosterol. This was accompanied by the mobilization of ergosterol precursors localized in lipid particles in the form of steryl esters visualized by confocal microscopy. Changes in the level of ergosterol and its precursors in cells treated with simvastatin depend on the mutation in the hHMGR gene. HPLC/MS analyses indicated a reduced level of phospholipids not connected with the mevalonic acid pathway. We detected two significant phenomena. First, cells treated with simvastatin develop an adaptive response compensating the lower activity of HMGR. This includes enhanced conversion of sterol precursors into ergosterol, mobilization of steryl esters and increased expression of the hHMGR gene. Second, statins cause a substantial drop in the level of glycerophospholipids."
https://openalex.org/W1971639783,"GATA4 is an essential transcription factor required for the development and function of multiple organs. Despite this important role, our knowledge of how the GATA4 gene is regulated remains limited. To better understand this regulation, we characterized the 5' region of the mouse, rat, and human GATA4 genes.Using 5' RACE, we identified novel transcription start sites in all three species. GATA4 is expressed as multiple transcripts with varying 5' ends encoded by alternative untranslated first exons. Two of these non-coding first exons are conserved between species: exon 1a located 3.5 kb upstream of the GATA4 ATG site in exon 2, and a second first exon (exon 1b) located 28 kb further upstream. Expression of both mRNA variants was found in all GATA4-expressing organs but with a preference for the exon 1a-containing transcript. The exception was the testis where exon 1a- and 1b-containing transcripts were similarly expressed. In some tissues such as the intestine, alternative transcript expression appears to be regionally regulated. Polysome analysis suggests that both mRNA variants contribute to GATA4 protein synthesis.Taken together, our results indicate that the GATA4 gene closely resembles the other GATA family members in terms of gene structure where alternative first exon usage appears to be an important mechanism for regulating its tissue- and cell-specific expression."
https://openalex.org/W2015044064,"The Centers for Disease Control recommend screening for asymptomatic sexually transmitted infection (STI) among HIV-infected men when there is self-report of unprotected anal-receptive exposure. The study goals were: (1) to estimate the validity and usefulness for screening policies of self-reported unprotected anal-receptive exposure as a risk indicator for asymptomatic anorectal infection with Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) and/or Chlamydia trachomatis (CT). (2) to estimate the number of infections that would be missed if anal diagnostic assays were not performed among patients who denied unprotected anorectal exposure in the preceding month.Retrospective analysis in HIV primary care and high resolution anoscopy (HRA) clinics. HIV-infected adult men were screened for self-reported exposure during the previous month at all primary care and HRA appointments. Four sub-cohorts were defined based on microbiology methodology (GC culture and CT direct fluorescent antibody vs. GC/CT nucleic acid amplification test) and clinical setting (primary care vs. HRA). Screening question operating characteristics were estimated using contingency table methods and then pooled across subcohorts. Among 803 patients, the prevalence of anorectal GC/CT varied from 3.5-20.1% in the 4 sub-cohorts. The sensitivity of the screening question for self-reported exposure to predict anorectal STI was higher in the primary care than in the HRA clinic, 86-100% vs. 12-35%, respectively. The negative predictive value of the screening question to predict asymptomatic anorectal STI was > or = 90% in all sub-cohorts. In sensitivity analyses, the probability of being an unidentified case among those denying exposure increased from 0.4-8.1% in the primary care setting, and from 0.9-18.8% in the HRA setting as the prevalence varied from 1-20%.As STI prevalence increases, denial of unprotected anal-receptive exposure leads to an increasingly unacceptable proportion of unidentified asymptomatic anorectal STI if used as a criterion not to obtain microbiologic assays."
https://openalex.org/W2081804818,"Background Neisseria meningitidis diversifies rapidly, due to its high recombination rates. The aim of this study was to analyze the possible impact of two vaccination campaigns (a once-off A/C polysaccharide vaccination campaign in people aged 18 months to 20 years old in 1997, and a meningococcal C conjugate vaccination campaign in children aged ≤6 years old from 2000 to 2008) on diversification of the population of invasive isolates obtained between 1997 and 2008. All of the 461 available isolates were included (2, 319, 123, 11 and 6 belonging to serogroups A, B, C, Y and W-135, respectively). Methodology/Principal Findings The isolates were analyzed for diversity using multilocus sequence typing, eBURST and the S.T.A.R.T.2 program. One hundred and seven sequence types (ST) and 20 clonal complexes were obtained. Five different STs (ST11, ST8, ST33, ST1163 and ST3496) included 56.4% of the isolates. With the exception of ST11, all other STs were associated with a specific serogroup. Epidemic circulation of serogroup C ST8 isolates was detected in 1997–1998, as well as epidemic circulation of ST11 isolates (serogroups B and C) in 2002–2004. The epidemic behavior of serogroup B ST11 (ST11_B:2a:P1.5) was similar, although with lesser intensity, to that of ST11 of serogroup C. Although clonality increased during epidemic years, the overall diversity of the meningococcal population did not increase throughout the 12 years of the study. Conclusion The overall diversity of the meningococcal population, measured by the frequency of STs and clonal complexes, numbers of alleles, polymorphic sites, and index of association, remained relatively constant throughout the study period, contradicting previous findings by other researchers."
https://openalex.org/W2080363505,"B-cell activation factor belonging to the tumor necrosis factor family (BAFF) is a major contributor to survival of B lymphocytes during development and maturation. A relationship between circulating BAFF levels and disease activity has been reported in patients with the autoimmune disease Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). Clinical trials targeting BAFF or its receptors are currently in progress. In order to further characterize a rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) model of SLE, we investigated the expression of BAFF and its receptors in non-inbred, pedigreed rabbits derived from breeding and selection based on autoantibody responses. We immunized rabbits related to previous groups that developed autoantibodies and inflammatory responses after immunizations with peptides synthesized on multiple antigen-branched polylysine backbones. Blood and sera collected before immunization and after boosts were used for health monitoring, analyses of serum autoantibody responses by ELISA and immunofluorescence. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were studied by flow cytometry and were the source of mRNA for quantitative PCR analyses. We hypothesized that BAFF mRNA expression and serum BAFF levels measured indirectly through BAFF receptor binding might increase in autoantibody-producing rabbits. Immunized rabbits developed elevated levels of leucocyte populations, anti-nuclear, anti-dsDNA and other autoantibodies. BR3 mRNA levels in total PBMC decreased and BAFF levels remained low and unchanged in most immunized rabbits. By flow cytometry, percentages of BAFF positive cells decreased. Percentages of transmembrane activator and CAML interactor (TACI) decreased in most rabbits from all the immunized groups. The rabbit is an important model for human autoimmune and infectious diseases, and a high quality draft rabbit genome assembly was recently completed. Human disease models developed in non-inbred pedigreed animals are better able to reflect the complexities of diseases such as SLE with familial patterns of inheritance. Although no consistent pattern of elevated expression of BAFF mRNA or protein was found in the rabbits studied, the data collected and reported here build upon previous data to refine understanding of a rabbit model of SLE."
https://openalex.org/W2092008382,"Background Childhood asthma prevalence and morbidity have been shown to vary by neighborhood. Less is known about between-school variation in asthma prevalence and whether it exists beyond what one might expect due to students at higher risk of asthma clustering within different schools. Our objective was to determine whether between-school variation in asthma prevalence exists and if so, if it is related to the differential distribution of individual risk factors for and correlates of asthma or to contextual influences of schools. Methods Cross-sectional analysis of 16,640 teens in grades 7–12 in Wave 1 (data collected in 1994–5) of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Outcome was current diagnosis of asthma as reported by respondents' parents. Two-level random effects models were used to assess the contribution of schools to the variance in asthma prevalence before and after controlling for individual attributes. Results The highest quartile schools had mean asthma prevalence of 21.9% compared to the lowest quartile schools with mean asthma prevalence of 7.1%. In our null model, the school contributed significantly to the variance in asthma ( = 0.27, CI: 0.20, 0.35). Controlling for individual, school and neighborhood attributes reduced the between-school variance modestly ( = 0.19 CI: 0.13–0.29). Conclusion Significant between-school variation in current asthma prevalence exists even after controlling for the individual, school and neighborhood factors. This provides evidence for school level contextual influences on asthma. Further research is needed to determine potential mechanisms through which schools may influence asthma outcomes."
