https://openalex.org/W2073568903,"The coordination between cell proliferation and cell death is essential to maintain homeostasis within multicellular organisms. The mechanisms underlying this regulation are yet to be completely understood. Here, we report the identification of hippo (hpo) as a gene that regulates both cell proliferation and cell death in Drosophila. hpo encodes a Ste-20 family protein kinase that binds to and phosphorylates the tumor suppressor protein Salvador (Sav), which is known to interact with the Warts (Wts) protein kinase. Loss of hpo results in elevated transcription of the cell cycle regulator cyclin E and the cell-death inhibitor diap1, leading to increased proliferation and reduced apoptosis. Further, we show that hpo, sav, and wts define a pathway that regulates diap1 at the transcriptional level. A human homolog of hpo completely rescues the overgrowth phenotype of Drosophila hpo mutants, suggesting that hpo might play a conserved role for growth control in mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2083106714,"Establishing and maintaining homeostasis is critical to the well-being of an organism and is determined by the balance of cell proliferation and death. Two genes that function together to regulate growth, proliferation, and apoptosis in Drosophila are warts (wts), encoding a serine/threonine kinase, and salvador (sav), encoding a WW domain containing Wts-interacting protein. However, the mechanisms by which sav and wts regulate growth and apoptosis are not well understood. Here, we describe mutations in hippo (hpo), which encodes a protein kinase most related to mammalian Mst1 and Mst2. Like wts and sav, hpo mutations result in increased tissue growth and impaired apoptosis characterized by elevated levels of the cell cycle regulator cyclin E and apoptosis inhibitor DIAP1. Hpo, Sav, and Wts interact physically and functionally, and regulate DIAP1 levels, likely by Hpo-mediated phosphorylation and subsequent degradation. Thus, Hpo links Sav and Wts to a key regulator of apoptosis."

https://openalex.org/W1966383348,"E type cyclins (E1 and E2) are believed to drive cell entry into the S phase. It is widely assumed that the two E type cyclins are critically required for proliferation of all cell types. Here, we demonstrate that E type cyclins are largely dispensable for mouse development. However, endoreplication of trophoblast giant cells and megakaryocytes is severely impaired in the absence of cyclin E. Cyclin E-deficient cells proliferate actively under conditions of continuous cell cycling but are unable to reenter the cell cycle from the quiescent G0 state. Molecular analyses revealed that cells lacking cyclin E fail to normally incorporate MCM proteins into DNA replication origins during G0→S progression. We also found that cyclin E-deficient cells are relatively resistant to oncogenic transformation. These findings define a molecular function for E type cyclins in cell cycle reentry and reveal a differential requirement for cyclin E in normal versus oncogenic proliferation."

https://openalex.org/W2109975639,"We have characterized the mechanisms of cargo selection into ER-derived vesicles by the COPII subunit Sec24p. We identified a site on Sec24p that recognizes the v-SNARE Bet1p and show that packaging of a number of cargo molecules is disrupted when mutations are introduced at this site. Surprisingly, cargo proteins affected by these mutations did not share a single common sorting signal, nor were proteins sharing a putative class of signal affected to the same degree. We show that the same site is conserved as a cargo-interaction domain on the Sec24p homolog Lst1p, which only packages a subset of the cargoes recognized by Sec24p. Finally, we identified an additional mutation that defines another cargo binding domain on Sec24p, which specifically interacts with the SNARE Sec22p. Together, our data support a model whereby Sec24p proteins contain multiple independent cargo binding domains that allow for recognition of a diverse set of sorting signals."
https://openalex.org/W2000479887,"Haplodiploid organisms comprise about 20% of animals. Males develop from unfertilized eggs while females are derived from fertilized eggs. The underlying mechanisms of sex determination, however, appear to be diverse and are poorly understood. We have dissected the complementary sex determiner (csd) locus in the honeybee to understand its molecular basis. In this species, csd acts as the primary sex-determining signal with several alleles segregating in populations. Males are hemizygous and females are heterozygous at this locus; nonreproducing diploid males occur when the locus is homozygous. We have characterized csd by positional cloning and repression analysis. csd alleles are highly variable and no transcription differences were found between sexes. These results establish csd as a primary signal that governs sexual development by its allelic composition. Structural similarity of csd with tra genes of Dipteran insects suggests some functional relation of what would otherwise appear to be unrelated sex-determination mechanisms."

https://openalex.org/W2029983725,"The COPII coat buds transport vesicles from the endoplasmic reticulum that incorporate cargo and SNARE molecules. Here, we show that recognition of the ER-Golgi SNAREs Bet1, Sed5, and Sec22 occurs through three binding sites on the Sec23/24 subcomplex of yeast COPII. The A site binds to the YNNSNPF motif of Sed5. The B site binds to Lxx-L/M-E sequences present in both the Bet1 and Sed5 molecules, as well as to the DxE cargo-sorting signal. A third, spatially distinct site binds to Sec22. COPII selects the free v-SNARE form of Bet1 because the LxxLE sequence is sequestered in the four-helix bundle of the v-/t-SNARE complex. COPII favors Sed5 within the Sed5/Bos1/Sec22 t-SNARE complex because t-SNARE assembly removes autoinhibitory contacts to expose the YNNSNPF motif. The COPII coat seems to be a specific conductor of the fusogenic forms of these SNAREs, suggesting how vesicle fusion specificity may be programmed during budding."
https://openalex.org/W2066888192,"The serine/threonine kinase Cdk5 plays an essential role in neuronal positioning during corticogenesis, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. In nonneuronal cells, the tyrosine kinase FAK is a major regulator of cell motility through focal adhesions. It is unclear whether FAK plays a role in brain development. Here, we show that FAK phosphorylation by Cdk5 at S732 is important for microtubule organization, nuclear movement, and neuronal migration. In cultured neurons, S732-phosphorylated FAK is enriched along a centrosome-associated microtubule fork that abuts the nucleus. Overexpression of the nonphosphorylatable mutant FAK S732A results in disorganization of the microtubule fork and impairment of nuclear movement in vitro, and neuronal positioning defects in vivo. These observations are reminiscent of what is seen in the Cdk5-deficient mice. Taken together, these results suggest that Cdk5 phosphorylation of FAK is critical for neuronal migration through regulation of a microtubule fork important for nuclear translocation."
https://openalex.org/W2100470175,"Proteolytic machines powered by ATP hydrolysis bind proteins with specific peptide tags, denature these substrates, and translocate them into a sequestered compartment for degradation. To determine how ATP is used during individual reaction steps, we assayed ClpXP degradation of ssrA-tagged titin variants with different stabilities in native and denatured forms. The rate of ATP turnover was 4-fold slower during denaturation than translocation. Importantly, this reduced turnover rate was constant during denaturation of native variants with different stabilities, but total ATP consumption increased with substrate stability, suggesting an iterative application of a uniform, mechanical unfolding force. Destabilization of substrate structure near the degradation tag accelerated degradation and dramatically reduced ATP consumption, revealing an important role for local protein stability in resisting denaturation. The ability to denature more stable proteins simply by using more ATP endows ClpX with a robust unfolding activity required for its biological roles in degradation and complex disassembly."

https://openalex.org/W2118606994,"Human DJ-1 and Escherichia coli Hsp31 belong to ThiJ/PfpI family, whose members contain a conserved domain. DJ-1 is associated with autosomal recessive early onset parkinsonism and Hsp31 is a molecular chaperone. Structural comparisons between DJ-1, Hsp31, and an Archaea protease, a member of ThiJ/PfpI family, lead to the identification of the chaperone activity of DJ-1 and the proteolytic activity of Hsp31. Moreover, the comparisons provide insights into how the functional diversity is realized in proteins that share an evolutionarily conserved domain. On the basis of the chaperone activity the possible role of DJ-1 in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1972192342,"We report the identification of SED1, a protein required for mouse sperm binding to the egg zona pellucida. SED1 is homologous to a small group of secreted cell-matrix adhesive proteins that contain Notch-like EGF repeats and discoidin/F5/8 type C domains. SED1 is expressed in spermatogenic cells and is secreted by the initial segment of the caput epididymis, resulting in SED1 localization on the sperm plasma membrane overlying the acrosome. SED1 binds specifically to the zona pellucida of unfertilized oocytes, but not to the zona of fertilized eggs. Recombinant SED1 and anti-SED1 antibodies competitively inhibit sperm-egg binding, as do truncated SED1 proteins containing a discoidin/C domain. SED1 null males are subfertile and their sperm are unable to bind to the egg coat in vitro. These studies illustrate that Notch-like EGF and discoidin/C domains, protein motifs that facilitate a variety of cellular interactions, participate in gamete recognition as well."
https://openalex.org/W2068100440,"The human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I)-encoded Tax protein activates transcription from the viral promoter via association with the cellular basic leucine zipper factor cAMP-response element-binding protein-2. Tax is also able to induce cellular transformation of T lymphocytes probably by modulating transcriptional activity of cellular factors, including nuclear factor-κB, E2F, activator protein-1 (AP-1), and p53. Recently, we characterized in HTLV-I-infected cells the presence of a novel viral protein, HBZ, encoded by the complementary strand of the HTLV-I RNA genome (Gaudray, G., Gachon, F., Basbous, J., Biard-Piechaczyk, M., Devaux, C., and Mesnard, J.-M. (2002) J. Virol. 76, 12813–12822). HBZ is a nuclear basic leucine zipper protein that down-regulates Tax-dependent viral transcription by inhibiting the binding of cAMP-response element-binding protein-2 to the HTLV-I promoter. In searching for other cellular targets of HBZ, we identified two members of the Jun family, JunB and c-Jun. Co-immunoprecipitation and cellular colocalization confirmed that HBZ interacts in vivo with JunB and c-Jun. When transiently introduced into CEM cells with a reporter gene containing the AP-1 site from the collagenase promoter, HBZ suppressed transactivation by c-Jun. On the other hand, the combination of HBZ with Jun-B had higher transcriptional activity than JunB alone. Consistent with the structure of its basic domain, we demonstrate that HBZ decreases the DNA-binding activity of c-Jun and JunB. Last, we show that c-Jun is no longer capable of activating the basal expression of the HTLV-I promoter in the presence of HBZ in vivo. Our results support the hypothesis that HBZ could be a negative modulator of the Tax effect by controlling Tax expression at the transcriptional level and by attenuating activation of AP-1 by Tax.

Karin M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2251) Google Scholar). Various AP-1 components, including c-Jun (2Vogt P.K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2365-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), can induce oncogenic transformation upon chronic activation in avian and mammalian cells (3Mechta-Grigoriou F. Ferald D.

The ability to regulate such a number of biological processes is due to the formation of various dimers between the Jun (c-Jun, JunB, and JunD) and Fos (c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1, and Fra-2) family members through their leucine zipper, a structural motif involving a heptad repeat of leucine residues. Jun proteins form both homodimers and heterodimers with Fos proteins (5Gentz R. Rauscher F.J. Abate C. Curran T. Science. 1989; 243: 1695-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 6Kouzarides T. Ziff E. Nature. 1988; 15: 646-651Crossref Scopus (551) Google Scholar, 7Ransone L.J. Visvader J. Sassone-Corsi P. Verma I.M. Genes Dev. 1989; 6: 770-781Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar), but Fos proteins are unable to homodimerize and require heterodimerization to bind to DNA (8Cohen D.R.

Verma I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4565-4573Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Dimers formed by Fos and Jun bind with the highest affinity to the AP-1 site, but they are also able to recognize the cAMP-response element (CRE) motif (11Hai T. Curran T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3720-3724Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar, 12Nakabeppu Y. Ryder K. Nathans D.

The AP-1 complexes are not limited to Jun and Fos dimers because certain Jun and Fos proteins have been shown to dimerize with other basic leucine zipper (bZIP) proteins, including members of the activating transcription factor/CRE-binding protein (CREB) family and the Maf transcription factors generating complexes with altered binding specificities (4van Dam H. Castellazzi M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2453-2464Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 14Kerppola T.K. Curran T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 675-684PubMed Google Scholar, 15Macgregor P.F. Abate C. Curran T. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 451-458PubMed Google Scholar). The relative binding affinities of the AP-1 transcription factors depend on the specific DNA sequence, on the promoter context, and on the dimer combinations (16Chinenov Y. Kerppola T.K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2438-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) is an oncogenic retrovirus etiologically associated with the development of adult T-cell leukemia. HTLV-I transforms T-cells via its regulatory protein Tax (17Basbous J. Gaudray G. Devaux C. Mesnard J.-M. Recent Res. Dev. Mol. Cell.

Moreover, AP-1 sites have been characterized as responsive elements for Tax in different cellular genes, including fra-1 (28Tsuchiya H. Fujii M. Niki T. Tokuhara M. Matsui M. Seiki M. J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 14946-14950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that Tax could be involved in AP-1 regulation at a post-transcriptional level (20Iwai K. Mori N. Oie M. Yamamoto N. Fujii M. Virology. 2001; 279: 38-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 22Mori N. Fujii M. Iwai K. Ikeda S. Yamasaki Y. Hata T. Yamada Y. Tanaka Y. Tomonaga M. Yamamoto N. Blood. 2000; 95: 3915-3921PubMed Google Scholar), but the exact mechanism of activation remains misunderstood. Tax is also involved in the transcription control of the HTLV-I genome itself (34Thébault S. Gachon F. Gaudray G. Mesnard J.-M. Recent Res. Dev. Virol. 2001; 3: 151-164Google Scholar). The elements that impart Tax responsiveness to the promoter consist of three 21-bp repeats containing an imperfect CRE sequence. Because Tax does not bind CRE by itself, previous studies have focused on identifying cellular proteins that bind to the viral CRE in conjunction with Tax. Using the yeast two-hybrid approach, the cellular bZIP transcription factor CREB-2 has been identified as a protein that interacts with Tax (35Gachon F. Péléraux A. Thébault S. Dick J. Lemasson I. Devaux C. Mesnard J.-M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8332-8337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Reddy T.R. Tang H. Li X. Wong-Staal F. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2785-2792Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that Tax enhances CREB-2 binding to the 21-bp repeats (37Gachon F. Thebault S. Peleraux A. Devaux C. Mesnard J.-M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3470-3481Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), probably by promoting homodimerization of the CREB-2 bZIP domain (38Gachon F. Gaudray G. Thebault S. Basbous J. Koffi A.J. Devaux C. Mesnard J.-M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 502: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 39Wagner S. Green M.R. Science. 1993; 262: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Then, the promoter-bound Tax molecule recruits the transcriptional coactivator CREB-binding protein, which is involved in the acetylation of the core histone tails (40Gachon F. Devaux C. Mesnard J.-M. Virology. 2002; 299: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 41Georges S.A. Kraus W.L. Luger K. Nyborg J.K. Laybourn P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). AP-1 is also able to transactivate the HTLV-I promoter in vivo (42Jeang K.-T. Chiu R. Santos E. Kim S.-J. Virology. 1991; 181: 218-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 43Lemasson I. Polakowski N.J. Laybourn P.J. Nyborg J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49459-49465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, no direct interactions between the AP-1 factors and Tax have been characterized, suggesting that AP-1 is obviously involved in basal transcription of the HTLV-I genome. Recently, we characterized a novel HTLV-I protein encoded by the complementary strand of the viral RNA genome (44Larocca D. Chao L.A. Seto M.H. Brunck T.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 163: 1006-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and named by us HBZ for HTLV-I bZIP factor (45Gaudray G. Gachon F. Basbous J. Biard-Piechaczyk M. Devaux C. Mesnard J.-M. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 12813-12822Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). The structure of HBZ resembles that of a prototypical bZIP transcription factor, with an N-terminal transcriptional activation domain and a C-terminal bZIP domain. HBZ acts as a repressor of viral transcription by forming heterodimers with CREB-2 that are no longer able to bind to the viral CRE (45Gaudray G. Gachon F. Basbous J. Biard-Piechaczyk M. Devaux C. Mesnard J.-M. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 12813-12822Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Here, through a combination of in vitro and in vivo experiments, we demonstrate that HBZ also interacts with two other bZIP factors, JunB and c-Jun. Our analysis reveals that HBZ decreases the DNA-binding activity of JunB and c-Jun, as is the case for CREB-2. In addition, we show that c-Jun is no longer capable of activating the basal expression of the HTLV-I promoter in the presence of HBZ in vivo. Our results support the hypothesis that HBZ could be a negative modulator of the Tax effect by controlling Tax expression at the transcriptional level and by attenuating activation of AP-1 by Tax. Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—MT2 cDNA fused to the Gal4 activation domain of the pGAD10 vector (35Gachon F. Péléraux A. Thébault S. Dick J. Lemasson I. Devaux C. Mesnard J.-M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8332-8337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was screened using the HBZ bZIP domain as a bait fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain of the pGBT9 vector. The two-hybrid screen was performed with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae HF7c reporter strain (3 × 106 clones were screened) as already described (35Gachon F. Péléraux A. Thébault S. Dick J.

Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—For immunoprecipitation of HBZ, plasmid pCI-HBZ, pcDNA-JunB, or pcDNA-c-Jun was cotransfected into 293T cells using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) as recommended by the manufacturer. Cultures were grown to saturation in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% penicillin and streptomycin antibiotic mixture and 10% fetal calf serum. After centrifugation, cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1% Triton X-100, and proteins were immunoprecipitated from protein extracts (2.5 mg of total proteins) by incubation at 4 °C for 2 h using rabbit anti-HBZ antiserum (45Gaudray G.

Bound fractions were washed six times and then electrophoresed on SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by immunoblotting as described (46Thébault S. Gachon F. Lemasson I. Devaux C. Mesnard J.-M.

(Santa Cruz, CA) and Oncogene Research Products (San Diego, CA), respectively. Fluorescence Microscopy Analysis—COS-7 cells were transfected with 1 μg of plasmid pEGFP-HBZ, expressing a green fluorescent protein-HBZ fusion protein (45Gaudray G. Gachon F. Basbous J. Biard-Piechaczyk M. Devaux C. Mesnard J.-M. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 12813-12822Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), and 1 μg of pcDNA-JunB or pcDNA-c-Jun. Cells were cultured on glass slides and then analyzed by fluorescence 24 h after transfection as described (35Gachon F. Péléraux A. Thébault S. Dick J. Lemasson I. Devaux C. Mesnard J.-M. J.

Jun proteins were detected using the above-cited mouse antibodies and secondary goat anti-mouse IgG antibody coupled to rhodamine (Pierce). Analysis of the green, red, and merged fluorescence was carried out using a fluorescence microscope. Transfections and Luciferase Assays—CEM cells were transiently cotransfected according to a previously published procedure (46Thébault S. Gachon F. Lemasson I. Devaux C. Mesnard J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4848-4857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). 5 μgof pcDNA3.1-lacZ (β-galactosidase-containing reference plasmid) was included in each transfection to control transfection efficiency. The total amount of DNA in each transfection was the same, the balance being made up with empty plasmids. Cell extracts equalized for protein content were used for luciferase and β-galactosidase assays. For the assays with the Gal4-binding site promoter-reporter plasmid, JunB or c-Jun fused in-frame with the DNA-binding domain of Gal4 into vector pBIND was cotransfected into CEM cells in the presence of the luciferase reporter plasmid pG5luc, containing five Gal4-binding sites upstream of a minimal TATA box. Microwell Colorimetric AP-1 Assay—15 μg of nuclear cell extracts was incubated with 30 μl of binding buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 8 mm NaCl, 12% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin) in microwells coated with probes containing the AP-1 site (Trans-AM™ AP-1, Active Motif Europe, Rixensart, Belgium). After a 1-h incubation at room temperature, microwells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and 0.1% Tween 20. The AP-1-bound complexes were detected with mouse anti-c-Jun or anti-JunB antibody and peroxidase-conjugated goat antibodies. For colorimetric detection, tetramethylbenzidine was incubated at room temperature before addition of stop solution. Optical density was read at 450 nm using a 620-nm reference wavelength with a Tecan microplate reader. Streptavidin-Biotin Complex Assay—A biotinylated oligonucleotide containing the AP-1 site (5′-cgcttgaTGAGTCAgccggaa-3′) was annealed with its complementary oligonucleotide to form a double-stranded DNA. Biotinylated double-stranded DNA was incubated with bacterially produced proteins in 200 μl of binding buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton, 5% glycerol, and 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at room temperature for 2 h before addition of streptavidin beads (Pierce). After a 1-h incubation at 4 °C, the beads were extensively washed with binding buffer without bovine serum albumin. The proteins that remained bound to the beads were eluted in SDS loading buffer and analyzed by Western blotting. Binding of HBZ to JunB and c-Jun—To identify proteins that interact with HBZ, a two-hybrid approach in yeast was performed with the bZIP domain of HBZ (amino acids 123–209) as a bait. The yeast strain expressing the HBZ bZIP domain fused to the DNA-binding domain of Gal4 was transformed with a library of cDNA derived from the HTLV-I-infected MT2 cell line fused to the transcriptional activation domain of Gal4 (35Gachon F. Péléraux A. Thébault S. Dick J. Lemasson I. Devaux C. Mesnard J.-M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8332-8337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several positive clones were found to correspond to two members of the Jun family, JunB and c-Jun (Fig. 1, A and B). The leucine zipper domain was, as expected, necessary for the interaction between both cellular factors and HBZ because truncated mutants of JunB (amino acids 1–273) and c-Jun (amino acids 1–287) lacking the leucine zipper did not bind to HBZ (Fig. 1C). To be sure of the specificity of the test in yeast, JunB and c-Jun were also tested in the presence of an unrelated protein, lamin, which was unable to interact with either of the two proteins (Fig. 1C). Moreover, HBZ was unable to form homodimers in yeast, as shown in Fig. 1C. To eliminate the possibility that the binding of HBZ to JunB or c-Jun may be indirect and dependent on yeast components, fusion proteins of either JunB or c-Jun with glutathione S-transferase (GST) were produced in Escherichia coli, and their binding to [35S]methionine-labeled HBZ, produced in rabbit reticulocyte lysate, was analyzed. As shown in Fig. 2A, HBZ bound to JunB (lane 3) or c-Jun (lane 6) fused to GST, but not to GST alone (lanes 2 and 5). Taken together, our results show that HBZ interacts with JunB and c-Jun in vitro.Fig. 2HBZ interacts with JunB and c-Jun. A, in vitro binding assays carried out with HBZ and JunB or c-Jun. Equal amounts of GST (lane 2) and GST-JunB (lane 3) immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated with 35S-labeled HBZ (lane 1), and bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The same assay was carried out with GST-c-Jun (lane 6). B, HBZ-JunB association in vivo. 293T cells were transfected with HBZ expression vector pCI-HBZ (lanes 1–3) or the corresponding empty vector (lanes 4 and 5) and plasmid pcDNA-JunB (lanes 1–5). Proteins from total lysates were directly probed with mouse anti-JunB antibody (lanes 1 and 4) or immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-HBZ antibody (lanes 2 and 5) or preimmune serum (PI; lane 3), followed by Western analysis with anti-JunB antibody (lanes 2, 3, and 5). Proteins from the total lysate of the HTLV-I-infected C8166 cells (lanes 8 and 9) or uninfected CEM cells (lane 7) were also immunoprecipitated with anti-HBZ antibody (lane 7 and 8) or preimmune serum (lane 9), and immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed with anti-JunB antibody (lanes 7–9). Lane 6 corresponds to C8166 proteins directly probed with anti-JunB antibody. C, HBZ-c-Jun association in vivo. The experiment was performed as described for HBZ and JunB, but with mouse anti-c-Jun antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) HBZ Co-immunoprecipitates with JunB and c-Jun in Vivo—To examine the in vivo interaction between HBZ and JunB, we coexpressed both proteins in 293T cells. Cell extracts were then immunoprecipitated with either rabbit anti-HBZ antiserum or preimmune serum from the same rabbit (45Gaudray G. Gachon F. Basbous J. Biard-Piechaczyk M. Devaux C. Mesnard J.-M. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 12813-12822Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), followed by Western analysis using anti-JunB monoclonal antibody. By this approach, JunB was found in the immunoprecipitate with anti-HBZ antiserum (Fig. 2B, lane 2), but not in the control immunoprecipitate (lane 3). When the same experiment was performed with extracts of 293T cells transfected only with JunB, no protein was found in the immunoprecipitate with anti-HBZ antiserum (Fig. 2B, lane 5), confirming the specificity of the interaction between HBZ and JunB. To confirm that both endogenous HBZ and JunB could also associate in infected cells, immunoprecipitation from a cell lysate of the HTLV-I-infected C8166 cell line expressing HBZ (45Gaudray G. Gachon F. Basbous J. Biard-Piechaczyk M. Devaux C. Mesnard J.-M. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 12813-12822Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) was performed with anti-HBZ antiserum and probed with anti-JunB antibody. As expected, this approach revealed the presence of a complex between HBZ and JunB in C8166 extracts (Fig. 2B, lane 8). By the same approach, such a complex was also detected in MT4 cells (data not shown), another HTLV-I-infected cell line, but not in the uninfected CEM cell line (Fig. 2B, lane 7). Altogether, these results clearly demonstrate that HBZ and JunB interact in vivo. As shown in Fig. 2C, the same co-immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out with c-Jun. The data obtained show that HBZ also bound to c-Jun in vivo. HBZ Colocalizes with JunB and c-Jun in the Nucleus—The HBZ-JunB interaction was further investigated in COS-7 cells by confirming the co-distribution of the proteins by immunofluorescence microscopy. In transient transfection assays, we found that HBZ tagged with green fluorescent protein exhibited a granular distribution in the nucleus (Fig. 3a), as described previously (45Gaudray G. Gachon F. Basbous J. Biard-Piechaczyk M. Devaux C. Mesnard J.-M. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 12813-12822Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). On the other hand, although JunB was also localized in the nucleus, here it showed a diffuse pattern (Fig. 3b). However, when JunB was cotransfected with HBZ, both proteins colocalized in the nuclear spots formed by the viral protein (Fig. 3, d–f). The same approach was also performed with c-Jun in COS-7 cells. Unlike JunB, c-Jun was distributed in either a diffuse or punctate staining pattern throughout the nucleus (Fig. 3c). Although we have already observed the existence of these two different staining patterns for other cellular proteins (47Thébault S. Basbous J. Gay B. Devaux C. Mesnard J.-M. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 79: 834-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), we do not know the exact mechanisms of their formation. However, like JunB, after cotransfection with HBZ, c-Jun localized with HBZ in the nuclear spots (Fig. 3, g–i). These observations support the notion that HBZ and either JunB or c-Jun colocalize in the nucleus, but also show that HBZ entails an intranuclear redistribution of both JunB and c-Jun. Taken together with co-immunoprecipitation, our results strongly suggest that HBZ and either JunB or c-Jun can interact with each other in vivo. HBZ Decreases the DNA-binding Activity of c-Jun—We next examined the effect of HBZ on transcription from the collagenase promoter containing a canonical AP-1 element. The reporter plasmid was first cotransfected into CEM cells with pcDNA-c-Jun in the presence of increasing amounts of the HBZ expression vector pCI-HBZ. As shown in Fig. 4A, c-Jun alone activated expression of the luciferase reporter gene by 34-fold; but this stimulation was inhibited in the presence of HBZ, and this inhibitory effect was proportional to the quantity of transfected HBZ plasmid. Moreover, we checked that the level of c-Jun expressed from pcDNA-c-Jun was not significantly decreased by the expression of HBZ (data not shown). Thus, HBZ negatively modulates c-Jun activity on a promoter containing the AP-1 element. Two simple mechanisms may explain the repression of c-Jun activity by HBZ. First, HBZ and c-Jun may form heterodimers that may not bind to the AP-1 site. If the heterodimer does not bind to the AP-1 motif, obviously it cannot stimulate transcription. Second, for unknown reasons, the complex between HBZ and c-Jun bound to the AP-1 site is much less active than the c-Jun homodimers. To discriminate between these two possibilities, we fused the full-length c-Jun protein to the DNA-binding domain of the yeast transcription factor Gal4 and used this chimera to analyze the effect of HBZ on c-Jun directly bound to a promoter bearing Gal4-binding sites. The Gal4-c-Jun chimera was assayed using the reporter plasmid pG5luc, encoding luciferase under the control of five Gal4-binding sites upstream of a minimal TATA box. After cotransfection of CEM cells with pG5luc and Gal4-c-Jun, luciferase expression was stimulated by 5-fold (Fig. 4B). When increasing amounts of HBZ were added, luciferase expression was stimulated by 23-fold (Fig. 4B). These results show that HBZ is no longer capable of inhibiting c-Jun activity when c-Jun is stably bound to the promoter. Consequently, they also suggest that HBZ could negatively regulate c-Jun activity by forming heterodimers that are unable to form stable complexes with the AP-1 site. To confirm this hypothesis, we compared c-Jun DNA-binding activity in the presence and absence of HBZ. The first series of experiments were based on the analysis of c-Jun DNA-binding activity by the microwell colorimetric assay from Active Motif Europe (48Renard P. Ernest I. Houbion A. Art M. Le Calvez H. Raes M. Remacle J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: E21Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Nuclear cell extracts of 293T cells transfected with c-Jun alone or associated with HB"
https://openalex.org/W1975173830,"Osteocytes embedded in the matrix of bone are thought to be mechanosensory cells that translate mechanical strain into biochemical signals that regulate bone modeling and remodeling. We have shown previously that fluid flow shear stress dramatically induces prostaglandin release and COX-2 mRNA expression in osteocyte-like MLO-Y4 cells, and that prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) released by these cells functions in an autocrine manner to regulate gap junction function and connexin 43 (Cx43) expression. Here we show that fluid flow regulates gap junctions through the PGE2 receptor EP2 activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) signaling. The expression of the EP2 receptor, but not the subtypes EP1,EP3, and EP4, increased in response to fluid flow. Application of PGE2 or conditioned medium from fluid flow-treated cells to non-stressed MLO-Y4 cells increased expression of the EP2 receptor. The EP2 receptor antagonist, AH6809, suppressed the stimulatory effects of PGE2 and fluid flow-conditioned medium on the expression of the EP2 receptor, on Cx43 protein expression, and on gap junction-mediated intercellular coupling. In contrast, the EP2 receptor agonist butaprost, not the E1/E3 receptor agonist sulprostone, stimulated the expression of Cx43 and gap junction function. Fluid flow conditioned medium and PGE2 stimulated cAMP production and PKA activity suggesting that PGE2 released by mechanically stimulated cells is responsible for the activation of cAMP and PKA. The adenylate cyclase activators, forskolin and 8-bromo-cAMP, enhanced intercellular connectivity, the number of functional gap junctions, and Cx43 protein expression, whereas the PKA inhibitor, H89, inhibited the stimulatory effect of PGE2 on gap junctions. These studies suggest that the EP2 receptor mediates the effects of autocrine PGE2 on the osteocyte gap junction in response to fluid flow-induced shear stress. These data support the hypothesis that the EP2 receptor, cAMP, and PKA are critical components of the signaling cascade between mechanical strain and gap junction-mediated communication between osteocytes.

These data support the hypothesis that the EP2 receptor, cAMP, and PKA are critical components of the signaling cascade between mechanical strain and gap junction-mediated communication between osteocytes. Mechanical usage of bone results in strain-induced endogenous signals for bone modeling and remodeling. These signals are sensed by a proposed “mechanostat” in bone, of which the osteocyte is the cellular component (1Frost H.M. Anat. Rec. 1987; 219: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar, 2Frost H.M. Anat. Rec. 1996; 244: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 3Turner C.H. Forwood M.R.

Gap junction-mediated intercellular communication has been proposed to play a role in determining the set point for the bone mechanostat (5Donahue H.J. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1998; 62: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Osteocytes are dispersed throughout the mineralized matrix and connected to neighboring osteocytes via the extensive network of long slender cell processes. The cell processes of osteocytes are connected to each other and to the cells at the bone surface via gap junctions (6Doty S.B. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1981; 33: 509-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Gap junctions are transmembrane channels that connect the cytoplasm of two adjacent cells. These channels permit molecules with a molecular mass of less than 1 kDa, such as small metabolites, ions, and intracellular signaling molecules (i.e. calcium, cAMP, and inositol triphosphate), to pass through (7Bennett M.V.L. Goodenough D.A. Neurosci. Res. Program Bull. 1978; 16: 373-486Google Scholar). These channels have been demonstrated to be important in modulating cell and tissue functions in many organs (8Goodenough D.A. Goliger J.A. Paul D.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 475-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar). Gap junction channels are formed by members of a family of proteins known as connexins (9Beyer E.C. Paul D.L. Goodenough D.A.

The application of force to bone results in several potential forms of mechanical stimuli for osteocytes including hydrostatic pressure, direct cell strain, and fluid flow-induced shear stress. Over the past few years, a number of theoretical and experimental studies support the hypothesis that flow of interstitial fluid is the major stimuli for osteocytes in response to loading (14Reich K.M. Gay C.V. Frangos J.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 143: 100-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 15Cowin S.C. Moss-Salentijin L. Moss M.L. J. Biomed.

It has been found that mechanical forces applied to bone cause fluid to flow through the canaliculi surrounding the osteocyte and that fluid flow is probably responsible for deformation in the extracellular matrix and of the cell membrane (16Weinbaum S. Cowin S.C. Zeng Y. J. Biomed. Eng. 1993; 27: 339-360Google Scholar, 17Turner C.H. Forwood M.R. Otter M.W. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 875-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Primary chicken osteocytes have been shown to be more sensitive than osteoblasts with respect to release of prostaglandins in response to either hydrostatic compression or to fluid flow shear stress, with fluid flow being more effective (18Klein-Nulend J.

Osteocytes are deeply embedded in the mineralized bone matrix and are not readily accessible for many experimental approaches. An osteocyte-like cell line named MLO-Y4 has been established and characterized, which appears to have characteristics of primary osteocytes (20Kato Y. Windle J.J. Koop B.A. Mundy G.R. Bonewald L.F. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 2014-2023Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). More importantly, MLO-Y4 cells express an osteocyte-specific marker protein, E11 (21Bonewald L.F. Zhao S. Zhang Y. Harris S.F. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15 (abstr.): 502Google Scholar). We and others (20Kato Y. Windle J.J. Koop B.A. Mundy G.R. Bonewald L.F. J. Bone Miner.

We have shown that MLO-Y4 cells are functionally coupled and that this coupling is mediated by gap junction channels (23Cheng B. Zhao S. Luo J. Sprague E. Bonewald L.F. Jiang J.X. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 249-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In addition, studies by Yellowley et al. (22Yellowley C.E. Li Z. Zhou Z. Jacobs C.R. Donahue H.J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) have reported that MLO-Y4 cells can couple through gap junctions to osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cells. Therefore, this cell line is a valuable model to study the function of gap junctions in cell-to-cell communication between osteocytes and other bone cells in response to mechanical strain. Primary osteocytes and primary calvarial bone cells have been shown to release prostaglandins in response to fluid flow treatment (18Klein-Nulend J. Van Der Plas A. Semeins C.M. Ajubi N.E.

These receptors have been characterized as specific G-protein-coupled receptors (37Boie Y. Stocco R. Sawyer N. Slipetz D.M. Ungrin M.D. Neuschafer-Rube F. Puschel G.P. Metters K.M. Abramovitz M. Eur.

Stocco R. Sawyer N. Slipetz D.M. Ungrin M.D. Neuschafer-Rube F. Puschel G.P. Metters K.M. Abramovitz M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 340: 227-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). EP2 and EP4, for example, signal through increased cAMP (39Bastien L. Sawyer N. Grygorczyk R. Metters K. Adam M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11873-11877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Regan J.W. Bailey T.J. Pepperl D.J. Pierce K.L. Bogardus A.M. Bonello J.E. Fairbairn C.E. Kedzie K.M. Woodward D.F. Fil D.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 213-220PubMed Google Scholar). However, the role of these receptors in bone cells, especially in osteocytes, remains largely unknown. PGE2 has also been shown to stimulate gap junction function and Cx43 expression in osteoblast-like UMR106-01 cells (41Civitelli R. Ziambaras K. Warlow P.M. Lecanda F. Nelson T. Harley J. Atal N. Beyer E.C. Steinberg T.H. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 68: 8-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In our previous studies, we have reported that fluid flow-induced shear stress stimulates gap junction-mediated intercellular communication and increases Cx43 expression in osteocyte-like MLO-Y4 cells (23Cheng B. Zhao S. Luo J. Sprague E. Bonewald L.F. Jiang J.X. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 249-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have shown that fluid flow increases the release of PGE2 in MLO-Y4 cells (42Cheng B. Kato Y. Zhao S. Luo J. Sprague E. Bonewald L.F. Jiang J.X. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 3464-3473Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and the released PGE2 functions in an autocrine fashion to stimulate gap junction function and Cx43 expression. Here we show that expression of the PGE2 receptor subtype EP2 is increased in response to fluid flow and mediates the autocrine effects of PGE2. Moreover, we identified intracellular cAMP and activated PKA as the signaling mediators between mechanical strain, autocrine PGE2, and gap junction-mediated communication in osteocytes.

All other reagents were purchased from Sigma or Fisher. Cell Cultures—MLO-Y4 cells were cultured on collagen-coated (rat tail collagen type I, 0.15 mg/ml) surfaces. Cells were grown in α-modified essential medium supplemented with 2.5% fetal bovine serum and 2.5% calf serum and incubated in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C as described previously (20Kato Y. Windle J.J. Koop B.A. Mundy G.R. Bonewald L.F. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 2014-2023Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Cell Shear Stress Induced by Fluid Flow—Fluid flow experiments were conducted as described previously (23Cheng B. Zhao S. Luo J. Sprague E. Bonewald L.F. Jiang J.X. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 249-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 42Cheng B. Kato Y. Zhao S. Luo J. Sprague E. Bonewald L.F. Jiang J.X.

Res. 1993; 72: 827-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). MLO-Y4 cells were cultured on collagen-coated polyester sheets. The wall shear stress experienced by cells in these chambers was directly related to the flow rate of the circulating medium through the channel and inversely to the square of the channel height. Flow was gravity-driven, and the rate was governed by the height of separation between the upper and lower medium reservoirs using a peristaltic pump (Cole-Parmer Instrument, Chicago, IL) to return medium to the upper reservoir. Flow rate was continually monitored by an in-line flowmeter (Cole-Parmer). By using this flow system, wall shear stress levels caused by steady laminar flow of 16 dynes/cm2 were generated by adjusting the channel height (using spacers) and medium flow rate (1–1.8 ml/s). The construction design of these chambers also permitted continuous microscopic visualization and recording of cells residing within the flow channel during shear stress regimens to monitor loss or change in cell orientation. All experiments were repeated at least three times. The circulating medium was identical to the culture medium. The entire flow system was housed within a large walk-in CO2 incubator to maintain the circulating medium and the cell environment at 37 °C and pH 7.4. Upon completion of the flow regimen, the cell-covered sheets were removed for the analyses described below. RT-PCR and Northern Blot Analyses—Total RNA was isolated from the cultures of MLO-Y4 cells using TRI REAGENT according to the manufacturer's instructions. For RT-PCR analyses, cDNA was synthesized from 5 μg of the total RNA in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing 1× first strand buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm KCl, 25 mm MgCl2, pH 8.4), 500 μm deoxy-NTPs, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 50 ng of oligo(dT)12–18 primers, and 280 units of Superscript II reverse transcriptase. 0.2% cDNA was amplified by using PCR in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 1× PCR buffer, 10 nm 5′ and 3′ primer, 200 μm deoxy-NTPs, 1 mm MgCl2, and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase. Amplifications were formed in a DNA Thermal Cycler (Techne) for 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40 cycles following the reaction profile of 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 45 s. From preliminary experiments, we determined that the linear range of the PCR cycles versus products is between 20 and 30 cycles (data not shown). The PCR products presented in Figs. 1 and 3 are from 25 cycles of PCRs. The primers for EP1, EP2, EP3, EP4, and control β-actin genes were used exactly as described previously (42Cheng B. Kato Y.

Boyan B.D. Schwartz Z. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 182: 196-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). PCR-amplified fragments were size-selected and purified from a 1% agarose gel using the QIAquick Gel Extraction kit according to the manufacturer's instructions and sequenced by the Center for Advanced DNA Technologies at the University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio. Northern blots were performed as described previously (45Katsuyama M. Nishigaki N. Sugimoto Y. Morimoto K. Negishi M. Narumiya S. Ichikawa A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 372: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNAs were prepared using Micro Poly(A) Pure™ kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Thirty micrograms of total RNA or 3 μg of poly(A)+ RNA were loaded and separated by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis containing formaldehyde and transferred to a nylon membrane. The membrane was hybridized at 45 °C for 24 h in a hybridization solution containing 50% formamide and 32P-labeled cDNA probe corresponding to nucleotides 338–1037 of EP2. The probed membrane was washed in a high stringency solution of 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 68 °C for 1 h.Fig. 3Stimulation of EP2 receptor expression by fluid flow-conditioned medium as determined by RT-PCR and Western blots. Conditioned medium (CM) was collected from MLO-Y4 cells after 2-h of fluid flow (FF) shear stress (+) or unstressed control cells (–) and was incubated with unstressed MLO-Y4 cells for 1 (lanes 1 and 2) and 24 h (lanes 3 and 4). A, total RNA was isolated from these cultures, and single-stranded cDNA was prepared. RT-PCR experiments were performed using specific DNA primers for EP2 and β-actin. B, the cells were lysed and crude membranes prepared. Western blot analysis was performed using anti-EP2 receptor or anti-β-actin antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—The protein concentration of crude membrane samples of MLO-Y4 cells was determined using the Micro-BCA assay according to the manufacturer's instructions. Equal amounts of protein (10 μg) were loaded in each lane of a 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes according to the method of White et al. (46White T.W. Bruzzone R. Goodenough D.A. Paul D.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 711-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Membranes were incubated with a 1:250 dilution of affinity-purified anti-Cx43 antibody as described previously (47He D.S. Jiang J.X. Taffet S.M. Burt J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6495-6500Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), a 1:250 dilution of anti-EP2 receptor polyclonal antibody, or a 1:5,000 dilution of monoclonal anti-β-actin antibody. The primary antibody was detected using peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antiserum followed by use of a chemiluminescence reagent kit (ECL) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The membranes were exposed to X-Omat AR films and detected by fluorography. The band intensity was quantified by densitometry (NIH image). “Scrape-loading” Dye Transfer Assay and Fluorescence Microscopy— MLO-Y4 cells were grown to ∼75–85% confluence. The scrape-loading dye transfer assay was performed based on the modified procedure described by El-Fouly et al. (49El-Fouly M.H. Trosko J.E. Chang C.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1987; 168: 422-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). In this method, cells were scratched in the presence of two types of fluorescence dyes: Lucifer Yellow (LY) (457 Da), which can penetrate through gap junction channels, and rhodamine dextran (RD) (10 kDa), which is too large to pass through the channels, thus serving as a tracer dye for the cells originally receiving the dye. Cells were washed three times with HBSS plus 1% bovine serum albumin. Then 1% LY and 1% RD dissolved in PBS were applied to the cells, which subsequently were scraped lightly with a 26-gauge needle. After incubation for 10 min, cells were washed with HBSS three times, then with PBS twice, and finally fixed in fresh 2% paraformaldehyde (from 16% stock) for 20 min. The dye transfer results were examined using a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axioscope, Zeiss, Jena, Germany), in which LY could be detected by using the filter set for fluorescein and RD using the filter set for rhodamine. To reach statistical significance, more than 500 cells receiving RD were counted for each assay. cAMP Immunoassay and Analysis of PKA Activity—MLO-Y4 cells were grown to a density where only the dendritic processes and not the cell body made contact in 6-well 35-mm culture plates. Cells were treated with 0.2 mm isobutylmethylxanthine, 0.2 mm ethanol (vehicle), PGE2, forskolin, or fluid flow-conditioned medium for various times at 37 °C. The cells were washed with cold PBS and then harvested in ice-cold ethanol. The collected samples were vacuum-dried and resuspended in assay buffer as suggested in the kit. The amount of the intracellular cAMP was determined using cAMP EIA kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. The activity of protein kinase A was determined as described previously (48Michael L.F. Asahara H. Shulman A.I. Kraus W.L. Montminy M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1596-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Briefly, MLO-Y4 cells were washed with cold PBS, lysed in HP buffer (10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 10 μm ATP, and 300 μg/ml Kemptide substrate), and then homogenized by passing 15 times through a 26-gauge needle. The homogenates were centrifuged at 8,000 rpm at 4 °C for 5 min, and the supernatant was collected for PKA assay. The activity of PKA was measured in a total volume of 100 μl containing 5 × 105 cpm [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol). The reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 5 min, and 30 μl of reaction mixture was spotted onto a Whatman P-81 paper. The paper was washed in 75 mm phosphoric acid twice, acetone once, and then subjected to scintillation counting for measurement of the levels of Kemptide phosphorylation. Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance and Bonferroni comparison test with the Instat biostatistic program (GraphPad software). Data are presented as the mean ± S.D. of three determinations. In the figures, asterisks indicate the degree of significant differences compared with the controls (*, ρ < 0.05, **, ρ < 0.01, and ***, ρ < 0.001). Fluid Flow-induced Shear Stress Stimulates the Expression of Prostaglandin Receptor Subtype EP2 but Not Other Subtypes in Osteocyte-like MLO-Y4 Cells—In our previous studies, PGE2 released by mechanically stressed MLO-Y4 cells functioned in an autocrine manner to enhance the activity of gap junctions and increase the expression of Cx43 protein (42Cheng B. Kato Y. Zhao S. Luo J. Sprague E. Bonewald L.F. Jiang J.X. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 3464-3473Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). To determine the PGE2 receptor subtype responsible for this autocrine effect, the expression of four known subtypes of PGE2 receptors (EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4) (36Breyer R.M. Bagdassarian C.K. Myers S.A. Breyer M.D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 661-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar, 37Boie Y. Stocco R. Sawyer N. Slipetz D.M. Ungrin M.D. Neuschafer-Rube F. Puschel G.P. Metters K.M. Abramovitz M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 340: 227-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) was analyzed. RT-PCR was performed with RNA isolated from MLO-Y4 cells at various poststress time points after these cells were treated with fluid flow for 2 h (Fig. 1) (n = 4). Whereas mRNA levels of EP1 (not shown), EP3, EP4, and housekeeping gene β-actin remained relatively constant (Fig. 1, EP3 and EP4, lanes 1–6), the levels of EP2 mRNA were increased starting 30 min after fluid flow treatment (Fig. 1, EP2, lanes 1 and 2). This increase was sustained and became more evident 2 and 24 h after fluid flow treatment (Fig. 1, EP2, lanes 3–6). To confirm this observation made using RT-PCR, Northern blot (Fig. 2A) (n = 3) analyses were performed. By using β-actin as a control, fluid flow shear stress induced an increase in t"

Whereas δ opioid receptors are selectively sorted to lysosomes, μ opioid receptors recycle rapidly to the plasma membrane by a process that has been proposed to occur via bulk membrane flow. We have observed that μ opioid receptors do not recycle by default and have defined a specific sequence present in the cytoplasmic tail of the cloned μ opioid receptor that is both necessary and sufficient for rapid recycling of internalized receptors. This sequence is completely distinct from a sequence shown previously to be required for recycling of the β2 adrenergic receptor yet is functionally interchangeable when tested in chimeric mutant receptors. These results indicate that signal-dependent recycling is a more common property of G protein-coupled receptors than previously appreciated and demonstrate that such a modular recycling signal distinguishes the regulation of homologous receptors that are naturally co-expressed. δ and μ opioid receptors are homologous G protein-coupled receptors that are differentially sorted between divergent degradative and recycling membrane pathways following agonist-induced endocytosis.

Many GPCRs are regulated by ligand-induced endocytosis (1Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Adv.

This process can mediate diverse functional consequences, which depend in large part on the specific membrane trafficking pathway followed by endocytosed receptors. For example, recycling of internalized receptors to the plasma membrane typically promotes the recovery of cellular responsiveness to agonist as characterized extensively in studies of functional resensitization of the β2 adrenergic catecholamine receptor (B2AR) (2Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. Life Sci. 1998; 62: 1561-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 4Lefkowitz R.J. Pitcher J. Krueger K. Daaka Y. Adv. Pharmacol. 1998; 42: 416-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Trafficking of internalized receptors to lysosomes typically has an opposite effect, promoting proteolytic degradation that is characterized by down-regulation of the total number of receptors present in cells and a prolonged attenuation of cellular responsiveness to agonist (5Trejo J. Hammes S.R. Coughlin S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13698-13702Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The ability of endocytic membrane trafficking to mediate these functionally opposite effects on receptor regulation underscores fundamental questions about the mechanisms that control the specificity of receptor trafficking in the endocytic pathway.Trafficking of GPCRs to lysosomes requires a specific membrane sorting event involving ubiquitin-dependent or -independent interactions of internalized receptors with cytoplasmic sorting proteins (6Marchese A.

Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). In contrast, recycling of receptors to the cell surface has been proposed to represent a “default” pathway that occurs by bulk membrane flow. The idea that GPCRs can recycle by default is consistent with previous studies of constitutively recycling nutrient receptors (10Mayor S. Presley J.F. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1257-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), which traverse a membrane pathway similar to recycling GPCRs, and with the enhanced recycling of various receptors observed after experimental manipulations that disrupt mechanisms of endosomal retention or lysosomal trafficking (8Whistler J.L.

The generalization that all GPCR recycling occurs by default has been challenged by studies of the B2AR where a specific sequence present in the cytoplasmic tail is required for efficient recycling of receptors, suggesting that certain GPCRs do not recycle by default but do so in a signal-dependent manner (15Cao T.T. Deacon H.W. Reczek D. Bretscher A. von Zastrow M. Nature. 1999; 401: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar, 16Gage R.M. Kim K.A. Cao T.T. von Zastrow M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 45145-45152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar).The sequence required for rapid recycling of the B2AR is not conserved in most GPCRs and binds to cytoplasmic proteins that appear to interact with few other family members, raising basic questions regarding the generality and physiological relevance of this principle of receptor regulation. First, is signal-dependent recycling unique to the B2AR or restricted to a limited subset of GPCRs that possess highly similar cytoplasmic tails? Second, if signal-dependent recycling is a more general phenomenon, can structurally distinct cytoplasmic sequences (which presumably bind to distinct proteins) mediate similar functions as specific recycling signals? Third, while signal-dependent recycling of the B2AR is evident from study of mutant receptors that do not occur in natural tissues, does signal-dependent recycling distinguish the regulation of physiologically relevant GPCRs that are naturally expressed?We have addressed these questions by focusing on the murine μ and δ opioid receptors (MOR and DOR, respectively), homologous G protein-coupled neuropeptide receptors that are natively co-expressed in several cell types (18Lee M.C.

Studies of cultured cells indicate that both MOR and DOR are rapidly endocytosed via clathrin-coated pits and colocalize in early endosomes within several minutes after agonist-induced activation. DOR is subsequently down-regulated by endocytic sorting to lysosomes, whereas MOR efficiently recycles to the plasma membrane and is rapidly resensitized (24Law P.Y. Loh H.H. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

A candidate lysosomal sorting protein binds strongly to the DOR tail but much less strongly to MOR in vitro and apparently not at all in vivo, suggesting that DOR is sorted to lysosomes via a noncovalent interaction and MOR recycles by default (8Whistler J.L. Enquist J. Marley A. Fong J. Gladher F. Tsuruda P. Murray S.R. von Zastrow M. Science. 2002; 297: 615-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). On the other hand, MOR undergoes proteolytic down-regulation under some conditions (28Chaturvedi K. Bandari P. Chinen N. Howells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12345-12355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 29Tao P.L. Han K.F. Wang S.D. Lue W.M. Elde R. Law P.Y. Loh H.H. Eur. J.

Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1064-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), suggesting that this GPCR may be capable of lysosomal trafficking and that additional machinery may modulate its endocytic sorting.The present studies indicate that MOR does indeed have a significant capacity to undergo endocytic sorting to lysosomes and define a 17-amino acid sequence present in the cytoplasmic tail of MOR that specifically promotes sorting of receptors into a rapid recycling pathway. The necessary and sufficient activity of this “MOR-derived endocytic recycling sequence” (MRS) establishes this sequence as a bona fide endocytic sorting signal. The MRS, although structurally distinct from the sorting signal identified previously in the B2AR, is functionally interchangeable with this sequence. These results demonstrate that endocytic recycling signals can distinguish the regulation of physiologically relevant GPCRs that are naturally co-expressed and indicate that such endocytic “recycling signals” are not unique to a single GPCR. Furthermore they suggest that a considerable variety of such signals may exist in the GPCR superfamily.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDUREScDNA Constructs—Amino-terminally FLAG-tagged versions of the cloned murine DOR-1 (31Evans C.J.

Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11130-11140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). MOR truncations and point mutations were generated by polymerase chain reaction (Vent polymerase, New England Biolabs) using pcDNA3-SFMOR as template. MOR7 was constructed by polymerase chain reaction of MOR12T where the downstream primer introduced the carboxyl-terminal 5 residues of SFMOR in-frame to the 3′ end of the coding region followed by a stop codon. DOR/MOR fusions were constructed by insertion of a synthetic linker-adapter (Operon Technologies) encoding the desired sequence corresponding to segments of the MOR tail followed by a stop codon into an existing SrfI site present in the sequence encoding the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain of DOR. The truncated B2AR and B2AR/MOR chimera were constructed by inserting synthetic linkers encoding a stop signal or the carboxyl-terminal 17 residues of MOR followed by a stop signal, respectively, into an EcoRV site present in the sequence encoding the B2AR cytoplasmic tail. All mutated cDNAs were cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), sequences were verified by dideoxynucleotide sequencing (University of California San Francisco Genetics Core Facility), and functionality was confirmed in transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK)293 cells.Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293 cells (ATCC) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (University of California San Francisco Cell Culture Facility). Cells grown in 6-cm culture dishes were transfected with 5 μg of plasmid DNA encoding the indicated receptor using calcium phosphate co-precipitation according to standard methods (34Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4810) Google Scholar). For studies of receptor trafficking in transiently transfected cells, cells were transfected as above and plated onto glass coverslips 24 h after transfection, and experiments were conducted 24-48 h thereafter. Stably transfected cells expressing epitope-tagged receptors were generated by selection for neomycin resistance using 500 μg/ml G418 (Geneticin, Invitrogen). Colonies representing individual neoR clones were isolated, and clones were selected for further study based on receptor expression levels (assessed by fluorescence flow cytometry and Western blot of cell lysates using M1 anti-FLAG antibody). Radioligand binding assay using [3H]diprenorphine (Amersham Biosciences) as tracer indicated that this expression level corresponds to 0.5-1pmol of receptor/mg of membrane protein.Fluorescence Microscopy—Endocytic trafficking of receptors initially labeled in the plasma membrane was visualized by fluorescence microscopy using a previously described “antibody feeding” method (15Cao T.T. Deacon H.W. Reczek D. Bretscher A. von Zastrow M. Nature. 1999; 401: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). In brief, transiently transfected 293 cells were grown on glass coverslips (Corning), and surface receptors were specifically labeled by incubating intact cells with M1 anti-FLAG antibody (2.0 μg/ml, Sigma). Surface-labeled cells were subsequently incubated (at 37 °C for 30 min) in the presence of the appropriate opioid (10 μm DADLE) or adrenergic (10 μm isoproterenol) agonist to drive agonist-induced internalization. Following this incubation, cells were either fixed immediately or were washed twice in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and subsequently incubated (37 °C for 45 min) in the presence of an excess concentration of the appropriate opioid (10 μm naloxone) or adrenergic (10 μm alprenolol) antagonist to prevent receptor activation by any residual agonist and thereby prevent subsequent agonist-induced endocytosis. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde freshly prepared in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) for 15 min and then quenched with three washes of Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.5) supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2. Specimens were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) in a blocking solution (3% dry milk in Tris-buffered saline plus 1 mm CaCl2) and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:500 dilution, Jackson Immunoresearch) for 30 min to detect antibody-labeled receptors. Epifluorescence microscopy was performed using an inverted microscope (Nikon Diaphot) equipped with a Nikon 60×NA1.4 objective and standard interference filter sets (Omega Optical). Images were collected using a 12-bit cooled charge-coupled device camera (Princeton Instruments) interfaced to a Macintosh computer running IPLab Spectrum software (Scanalytics). For colocalization studies, receptors were detected using a rabbit anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) followed by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:500 dilution, Jackson Immunoresearch). Lysosomes were localized using LAMP1 monoclonal antibody obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Data Bank followed by incubation with Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse secondary antibody. Confocal fluorescence microscopy was performed using a Zeiss LSM510 microscope fitted with a Zeiss 63×NA1.4 objective operated in single photon mode with standard filter sets and standard (one Airy disc) pinhole.Quantative Analysis of Receptor Recycling Using Fluorescence Ratio Microscopy—To quantify the extent of recycling observed following agonist removal in individual cells, a modified version of the antibody feeding method was devised. Transiently transfected cells grown on glass coverslips were incubated with Alexa488-conjugated M1 anti-FLAG antibody (prepared by standard methods using Alexa-fluor 488 N-hydroxysuccinimide ester, Molecular Probes) to selectively label FLAG-tagged receptors present in the plasma membrane at the beginning of the experiment. Then cells were incubated (at 37 °C for 30 min) in the presence of 10 μm DADLE or 10 μm isoproterenol to drive internalization as above. At the end of this incubation cells were quickly washed three times in PBS lacking Ca2+ or Mg2+ and supplemented with 0.04% EDTA to dissociate FLAG antibody bound to residual surface receptors remaining in the plasma membrane, thereby leaving antibody bound only to the internalized pool of receptors. EDTA-stripped cells were then incubated (at 37 °C for 45 min) in the presence of 10 μm naloxone or 10 μm alprenolol to prevent subsequent receptor activation and to allow recycling to occur, and then cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, PBS under non-permeabilizing conditions, quenched with Tris-buffered saline with 3% bovine serum albumin (but no Triton X-100), and incubated with Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse secondary antibody to detect recycled, antibody-labeled receptors. For experiments examining the effect of latrunculin B, immediately following the EDTA stripping step cells were incubated on ice for 1 h in medium containing antagonist and 10 μg/ml latrunculin B followed by a further 45-min incubation at 37 °C to allow recycling of internalized receptors. In each experiment, and for each receptor construct examined, two parallel control coverslips were included, one in which cells were fixed after a 30-min incubation in the absence of agonist and without an EDTA stripping step (100% surface receptor control) and one in which cells were fixed immediately after the EDTA-mediated stripping step (0% recycled control). Cells were examined by epifluorescence microscopy using appropriate filter sets to selectively detect Alexa488 or Cy3, and staining intensities of each fluor in individual cells were integrated using IPLab Image software. This analysis indicated that the efficiency of the EDTA strip (reduction of Cy3 staining intensity in the 0% recycled control relative to the 100% surface receptor control) was >95%, consistent with previous measures using fluorescence flow cytometry. The percentage of receptors recycled in individual cells following agonist washout was then calculated from the red/green ratios determined from the control conditions according to the following formula: (E - Z)/(C - Z) × 100, where E = the mean ratio for the experimental coverslip, Z = the mean ratio for the zero surface control, and C = the mean ratio for the 100% surface control. 20-30 cells/construct/condition were analyzed at random in this manner for each experiment, and average values reported under “Results” represent mean recycling percentages derived from three to five independent experiments.Fluorescence Flow Cytometry—Internalization and recycling of epitope-tagged receptors were estimated using fluorescence flow cytometry of stably transfected cells to measure changes in the relative amount of FLAG-tagged receptors present in the plasma membrane after surface labeling with Alexa488-conjugated M1 antibody as described previously (16Gage R.M. Kim K.A. Cao T.T. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44712-44720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Fluorescence flow cytometry was performed using a FACScan instrument (BD Biosciences). 20,000 cells were collected for each sample. Triplicate samples were analyzed for each condition in each experiment. The mean fluorescence values for each experiment (n = 5 experiments) were averaged, and the S.E. was calculated across all experiments.Surface Biotinylation and Assays of Receptor Proteolysis—A previously described cell surface biotinylation method was used to specifically detect FLAG-tagged receptors present in the plasma membrane and to measure their proteolysis (3Tsao P.I. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11130-11140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Briefly, stably transfected 293 cells expressing the indicated FLAG-tagged receptors were grown in 10-cm dishes, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and incubated with 300 μg/ml sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide-biotin (Pierce) in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C to biotinylate surface proteins. Unreacted biotin was quenched and removed with three washes of ice-cold Tris-buffered saline. Biotinylated cells were then transferred to prewarmed medium containing a 10 μm concentration of the appropriate agonist for the indicated times, and then cells were immediately chilled on ice and lysed in extraction buffer (1.0% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 25 mm KCl, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Extracts were clarified by centrifugation (12,000 × g for 20 min), and then biotinylated proteins were isolated from cell extracts by immobilization on streptavidin-conjugated Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) and washing five times in PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 to remove nonspecifically bound material. Washed beads were eluted with SDS sample buffer, and eluted proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed for FLAG-tagged receptor by immunoblotting using M1 antibody, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences), and SuperSignal detection reagent (Pierce). Band intensities were quantified by densitometry of films exposed in the linear range using a range of lysates run in parallel as reference, imaged using a charge-coupled device camera, and analyzed using FluorChem Version 2.0 software (AlphaInnotech Corp.).GST Fusion Protein Binding Assay—Clarified HEK293 cell lysates were incubated for 4 h with 5 μg of the indicated GST-receptor tail fusion protein, which was prebound to glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Beads were washed five times with extraction buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer. Eluted proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with rabbit anti-EBP50 antibody (supplied by Dr. Anthony Bretscher, Cornell University) or mouse anti-NSF antibody (supplied by Dr. Sidney Whiteheart, University of Kentucky).RESULTSIn the course of characterizing a series of stably transfected cell lines expressing truncated mutant opioid receptors, we noticed that truncation of 17 residues from the cytoplasmic tail of MOR1 created a functional mutant receptor (MOR17T) with significantly reduced stability after agonist-induced endocytosis. A FLAG-tagged version of MOR17T, labeled by surface biotinylation (15Cao T.T. Deacon H.W. Reczek D. Bretscher A. von Zastrow M. Nature. 1999; 401: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar) in stably transfected HEK293 cells, was extensively proteolyzed within 2 h after addition of the peptide agonist DAMGO to the culture medium. In contrast, little proteolysis of wild type MOR was observed even after 4 h of agonist exposure (Fig. 1, A and B). The MOR17T mutant receptor colocalized extensively with the late endosome/lysosome marker LAMP1 within 60 min after agonist addition to the culture medium, whereas wild type MOR was localized primarily in LAMP1-negative endocytic vesicles under these conditions (Fig. 1C). Together these results indicate that the MOR17T truncated mutant receptor traffics to lysosomes at a significantly increased rate relative to wild type MOR, and they suggest that the distal cytoplasmic tail of MOR contains a structural element that inhibits lysosomal trafficking of receptors.To determine whether this structural element is required for efficient recycling of MOR to the plasma membrane after agonist-induced endocytosis, we utilized fluorescence flow cytometry to compare ligand effects on internalization and recovery of surface-accessible MOR and MOR17T mutant receptors. Stably transfected cells expressing FLAG-tagged MOR or MOR17T displayed a similar reduction (∼50-60%) in surface receptor immunoreactivity following a 30-min exposure to DAMGO, indicating that truncation of the distal cytoplasmic tail of MOR did not markedly affect agonist-induced endocytosis. However, while the number of immunoreactive MORs present in the plasma membrane recovered almost completely within 45 min after removal of agonist from the culture medium, the MOR17T truncated mutant receptor exhibited significantly reduced surface recovery even when assayed 90 min after agonist washout (Fig. 2A). To investigate this observation further, we developed a ratiometric fluorescence-based assay in which the internalized pool of receptors is specifically labeled with a monoclonal antibody that does not interfere with GPCR recycling (15Cao T.T. Deacon H.W. Reczek D. Bretscher A. von Zastrow M. Nature. 1999; 401: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar), and recycling of the internal receptor pool is detected by surface accessibility to a secondary antibody (Fig. 2B). This assay was validated by comparing the behavior of FLAG-tagged MOR with that of the murine DOR, a distinct opioid receptor that endocytoses via a similar early endocytic pathway (35Keith D.E. Murray S.R. Zaki P.A. Chu P.C. Lissin D.V. Kang L. Evans C.J. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19021-19024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar) but does not recycle efficiently to the plasma membrane (3Tsao P.I. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11130-11140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, little recycling of antibody-labeled DOR was observed 45 min after washout of DADLE (a peptide agonist that induces rapid endocytosis of both DOR and MOR) as indicated by the weak cell staining with the surface-applied secondary antibody (Fig. 2C, top panels). In contrast, under the same conditions a strong signal representing recycled MOR was observed (Fig. 2C, bottom panels). Quantification of these data by ratiometric analysis (see “Experimental Procedures”) of numerous transiently transfected cells, which rep"

We reported previously that Fbs1 (F-box protein that recognizes sugar chains; equivalent to Fbx2 or NFB42) binds specifically to proteins attached with high mannose oligosaccharides and subsequently contributes to elimination of N-glycoproteins in cytosol (Yoshida, Y., Chiba, T., Tokunaga, F., Kawasaki, H., Iwai, K., Suzuki, T., Ito, Y., Matsuoka, K., Yoshida, M., Tanaka, K., and Tai, T. (2002) Nature 418, 438–442). Here we report the identification of another F-box protein that recognizes N-glycan, Fbs2 (called Fbx6b or FBG2 previously). Although the expression of Fbs1 was restricted to the adult brain and testis, the Fbs2 transcript was widely expressed. The Fbs2 protein forms an SCFFbs2 ubiquitinligase complex that targets sugar chains in N-glycoproteins for ubiquitylation. Only glycoproteins bound to concanavalin A lectin and not to wheat germ agglutinin or Ricinus communis agglutinin interacted with Fbs2 in various tissues and cell lines. Pull-down analysis using various oligosaccharides revealed that Man3–9GlcNAc2 glycans were required for efficient Fbs2 binding, whereas modifications of mannose residues by other sugars or deletion of inner GlcNAc reduced Fbs2 binding. Fbs2 interacted with N-glycans of T-cell receptor α-subunit (TCRα), a typical substrate of the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, and the forced expression of mutant Fbs2ΔF, which lacks the F-box domain essential for forming the SCF complex, and decrease of endogenous Fbs2 by small interfering RNA led to inhibition of TCRα degradation in cells. Thus, Fbs2 is a novel member of F-box protein family that recognizes N-glycans and plays a role in ERAD.

Selective protein degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway serves as a powerful regulatory mechanism in a wide variety of cellular processes. Ubiquitin conjugation requires the sequential activities of three enzymes or protein complexes called the ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), 1The abbreviations used are: E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme; E3, ubiquitin-protein ligase; chitobiose, di-N-acetylchitobiose; ConA, concanavalin A; WGA, wheat germ agglutinin; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ERAD, ER-associated degradation; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GTF, GlcNAc-terminated fetuin; HA, hemagglutinin A; RCA, Ricinus communis; SCF, Skp1-Cullin1-F-box protein-Roc1; siRNA, small interfering RNA; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; TCRα; T-cell receptor α-subunit; UGGT, UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase.1The abbreviations used are: E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme; E3, ubiquitin-protein ligase; chitobiose, di-N-acetylchitobiose; ConA, concanavalin A; WGA, wheat germ agglutinin; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ERAD, ER-associated degradation; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GTF, GlcNAc-terminated fetuin; HA, hemagglutinin A; RCA, Ricinus communis; SCF, Skp1-Cullin1-F-box protein-Roc1; siRNA, small interfering RNA; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; TCRα; T-cell receptor α-subunit; UGGT, UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase. the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), and the ubiquitin-protein ligase (E3) (1Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6792) Google Scholar). In the ubiquitin pathway, E3 plays an important role in the selection of target proteins for degradation, because each distinct E3 usually binds a protein substrate with a degree of selectivity for ubiquitylation. E3s are believed to exist as molecules with a large diversity, presumably in more than hundreds of species, which are classified into many subfamilies. One of the best characterized E3 families is the Skp1-Cullin1-F-box protein-Roc1 (SCF) complex (2Deshaies R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 435-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). The SCF is composed of a Cullin1/Cdc53, Skp1, Roc1/Rbx1/Hrt1, and one member of a large family of proteins called F-box proteins. F-box proteins typically have a bipartite structure with an N-terminal F box motif consisting of ∼40 amino acid residues and a C-terminal region that interacts with the substrate and, thereby, the function of the F-box protein is to trap target proteins (3Winston J.T. Koepp D.M. Zhu C. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1180-1182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 4Kipreos E.T. Pagano M. Genome. Biol. 2000; 1: 3002.1-3002.7Crossref Google Scholar). However, it remains elusive how E3s accurately recognize target proteins. Accumulating evidence suggests that phosphorylation of target proteins is a prerequisite for their recognition by SCF complexes (1Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6792) Google Scholar, 2Deshaies R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 435-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar, 4Kipreos E.T. Pagano M. Genome. Biol. 2000; 1: 3002.1-3002.7Crossref Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that proline hydroxylation of the transcription factor hypoxia-induced factor 1α (HIF1α) serves as a signal for ubiquitylation by the SCF-like Cullin2-based VBC ubiquitin-ligase (5Ivan M. Kondo K. Yang H. Kim W. Valiando J. Ohh M. Salic A. Asara J.M. Lane W.S. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Science. 2001; 292: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (3828) Google Scholar, 6Jaakkola P. Mole D.R. Tian Y.M.

Science. 2001; 292: 468-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (4367) Google Scholar). On the other hand, we have reported recently that Fbx2 forms an SCFFbx2 ubiquitin ligase complex that targets sugar chains in N-linked glycoproteins for ubiquitylation (7Yoshida Y. Chiba T. Tokunaga F. Kawasaki H. Iwai K. Suzuki T. Ito Y. Matsuoka K. Yoshida M. Tanaka K. Tai T. Nature. 2002; 418: 438-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Thus, Fbx2 is a novel example of F-box proteins that have evolved to recognize protein modifications other than phosphorylation and hydroxylation. N-glycosylation acts as a targeting signal to eliminate intracellular glycoproteins by Fbx2-dependent ubiquitylation and subsequent proteasomal degradation.N-glycosylation of the proteins occurs when newly synthesized proteins enter the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through the translocation channel “translocon.” N-glycans play an important role in glycoprotein transport and sorting (8Fiedler K. Simons K. Cell. 1995; 81: 309-312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), in particular at the initial step of secretion that occurs in the ER compartment (9Ellgaard L. Molinari M. Helenius A. Science. 1999; 286: 1882-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar, 10Helenius A. Aebi M. Science. 2001; 291: 2364-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (1955) Google Scholar). N-linked glycoproteins are subjected to “quality control” in which aberrant proteins are distinguished from properly folded proteins and retained in the ER (10Helenius A. Aebi M. Science. 2001; 291: 2364-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (1955) Google Scholar). The quality control system includes the calnexin-calreticulin cycle, a unique chaperone system that recognizes Glc1Man9–6GlcNAc2 and assists refolding of misfolded or unfolded proteins. When the improperly folded or incompletely assembled proteins fail to restore their functional states, they are degraded by the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) system, which involves a retrograde transfer of proteins from the ER to the cytosol followed by degradation by the proteasome (11Plemper R.K. Wolf D.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 266-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 12Brodsky J.L. McCracken A.A. Semin. Cell Dev.

Precisely how they are selected for ERAD remains unclear, but what is clear is that the trimming of N-glycans plays a key role in the selection process. Recent studies have demonstrated that Man8GlcNAc2 structures serve as part of the signal needed for ERAD and that a lectin for Man8GlcNAc2 in ER accelerates the turnover rate of the misfolded glycoprotein (14Hosokawa N.

In addition, we have recently identified a novel member of the ERAD-linked E3 family, SCFFbx2, which participates in ERAD for selective elimination of glycoproteins (7Yoshida Y. Chiba T. Tokunaga F.

Misfolding or misassembly might be the general feature of all substrates; however, Fbx2 is expressed mainly in neuronal cells in the adult brain (22Erhardt J.A. Hynicka W. DiBenedetto A. Shen N.

Our results showed that Fbx6b/FBG2 bound several glycoproteins, but other F-box proteins failed to bind any of the glycoproteins tested so far. In considering the results of these functional studies, we renamed Fbx2/FBG1 and Fbx6b/FBG2 Fbs1 (F-box protein that recognizes sugar chains 1) and Fbs2, respectively. We found that Fbs2 is widely distributed in a variety of mouse tissues, differing from the restricted expression of Fbs1. Furthermore, a dominant negative Fbs2 mutant suppressed degradation of a typical ERAD substrate, the T cell receptor α subunit (TCRα). Taken together, we concluded that Fbs2 is a new member of the E3-Fbs subfamily for ubiquitylation of N-linked glycoproteins and plays a role in the ERAD pathway.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Ribonuclease B, fetuin, asialofetuin type II, and thyroglobulin were purchased from Sigma. β-galactosidase (Streptococcus 6646K) and β-N-acetylhexosaminidase (Jack Bean) were purchased from Seikagaku-Kogyo (Tokyo, Japan), and N-glycosidase F was from Roche Applied Science.

Man9GlcNAc2 was a kind gift from Y. Ito. ConA, RCA, and WGA lectin-agaroses were purchased from Seikagaku-Kogyo.Isolation of cDNAs Coding for F-box Proteins and Plasmid Construction—The sequences of mouse Fbs2/Fbx6b/FBG2 (accession number AF176526), Fbx17/FBG4 (accession number AF176532), and FBG3 (accession number XM_204068) cDNAs were obtained from the GenBank™ data base. The cDNAs for mouse Fbs2, Fbx17, and FBG3 were amplified by PCR with Taq polymerase (Sigma) from mouse kidney cDNA. The PCR primers were as follows: 5′-TCT CTG GGA TCC CCA TGG TCC ACA TCA AGG AG-3′ and 5′-GAG CCT GAG CGG CCG CTA ACG CCT TAG CCT TTG CCA-3′ for Fbs2; 5′-CTG ACC GGA TCC TCA TGG GAG CGC GGC CCT CG-3′ and 5′-ACC TGA AGG CGG CCG CAT CAC ATC ATG GTA GTC C-3′ for Fbx17; and 5′-ACG CCA GGA TCC CAG TAG GCA ACA TCA ACG-3′ and 5′-TGA GGA CTG CGG CCG CTC AGG AGG CAT CAG GGC AG-3′ for FBG3. PCR products were digested with BamHI/NotI, subcloned into pBluescriptII SK+, and sequenced. The cDNAs of wild-type or deletion mutants were amplified by PCR with appropriate primers and ligated into BamHI/NotI-cut pcDNA3-FLAG or pVL1393-His expression vector. The coding residues of the Fbs2 deletion mutant ΔF were from amino acids 47 to 295.Overlay Assay—Cultured cells and mouse tissues were homogenized in 10 volumes of TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl) containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and protease inhibitor mixture (complete EDTA-free; Roche Applied Science). After centrifugation of the homogenate at 15,000 × g for 30 min, each supernatant (15-mg proteins) was incubated with 50 μl of various lectin-agaroses under gentle rotation at 4 °C for 2 h. The agaroses were washed with ice-cold TBS containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and bound proteins were boiled with SDS sample buffer. Proteins were separated with SDS-PAGE and blotted onto a membrane (Immobilon, Millipore, Bedford, MA). To prepare the [35S]methionine-Fbs1 and Fbs2 probes, we constructed Fbs1-Metx3 and Fbs2-Metx3 plasmids for Fbs1 (ΔN-2) (7Yoshida Y. Chiba T. Tokunaga F. Kawasaki H. Iwai K. Suzuki T. Ito Y. Matsuoka K. Yoshida M. Tanaka K. Tai T. Nature. 2002; 418: 438-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) and Fbs2 (ΔF), respectively, with three additional methionines at the C termini by subcloning them into pcDNA3-FLAG. The TnT Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega, Madison, WI) was used for generating [35S]methionine-Fbs1, Fbs2, and βTrCP1. Membranes were blocked by 5% skim milk in TBS, washed, and then incubated with probes in 1% skim milk at 4 °C for 18 h with gentle shaking. Membranes were washed with TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, air-dried, and analyzed by autoradiography.Northern Blot Analyses—Tissues from 8-week-old ICR mice were employed for RNA extraction using the guanidine thiocyanate method. 15 μg of total RNA was fractionated on a denaturing formaldehyde-agarose gel (1%) and then transferred onto a nylon membrane (Nytran, Schleicher & Schuell). Northern blots were probed with the full-length Fbs1 or Fbs2 cDNA that had been labeled with [α32P]dCTP. The blots were washed at 65 °C in 0.2× standard saline citrate containing 0.1% SDS and then exposed and analyzed with a Molecular Imager FX (Bio-Rad).In Vitro Ubiquitylation Assays—Recombinant His-Ubc4 and His-Ubc12, His-NEDD8, and GST-ubiquitin were produced in Escherichia coli. Recombinant His-E1 (Uba1), His-APP-BP1/T7-Uba3, and SCFFbs2 (FLAG-Skp1/Cul1-HA/His-Fbs2/T7-Roc1) were produced by baculovirus-infected HiFive or Sf9 insect cells. The SCFFbs2 complex was obtained by simultaneously infecting four baculoviruses. These proteins were affinity-purified by a HiTrap HP column (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (24Kawakami T. Chiba T. Suzuki T. Iwai K. Yamanaka K. Minato N. Suzuki H. Shimbara N. Hidaka Y. Osaka F. Omata M. Tanaka K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4003-4012Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar).The methods for preparation of GlcNAc-terminated fetuin (GTF) and deglycosylated fetuin (DGF) were described previously (7Yoshida Y.

One microgram each of GTF or DGF was incubated in 50 μl of the reaction mixture containing the ATP-regenerating system, 0.5 μg E1, 1 μg of Ubc4 (E2), 2 μg of SCFFbs2, and 6.5 μg of recombinant GST-ubiquitin in the presence or absence of the NEDD8 system (24Kawakami T. Chiba T. Suzuki T. Iwai K. Yamanaka K. Minato N. Suzuki H. Shimbara N. Hidaka Y. Osaka F. Omata M. Tanaka K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4003-4012Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) consisting of NEDD8 (10 μg), APP-BP1/T7-Uba3 (0.5 μg), and Ubc12 (0.5 μg) at 30 °C. After terminating the reaction by the addition of 25 μl of 3× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, the proteins in 8 μl of the boiled supernatants were separated with 4–20% SDS-PAGE, and the high molecular mass ubiquitylated proteins were detected by immunoblotting with an anti-fetuin (Chemicon) or anti-GST (Ab-1; Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) antibody.Pull-down Assay—Each 2.0 mg of glycoprotein was immobilized to 0.5 ml of Affi-Gel 10 or 15. Each cell extract prepared with TBS containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 from FLAG-tagged Fbs2 (ΔF) or Fbs1 (ΔN-2)-expressing cells (25 μg) was incubated with 15 μl of various glycoprotein-immobilized beads, and bound proteins were eluted by boiling with SDS sample buffer or incubation with 15 μl of various concentrations of oligosaccharides at room temperature for 10 min. The eluates were separated by spin filtration.RNA Interference Experiment—Twenty-one nucleotide dsRNAs were prepared by Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). The siRNA sequences targeting Fbs2 mRNA (GenBank™ accession number NM 018438) corresponded to the coding regions 285–304 (GAGGAUAUGUUUGCAUGGC) and 754–773 (ACAGCAGCAUUGUCGUCAG) relative to the first nucleotide of the start codon. A nonspecific control duplex was purchased from Dharmacon. 293T cells were transfected with siRNA and/or plasmid DNA by the use of LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen). Total RNA was isolated with TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription PCR was performed using total RNA of 293T cells as a template. The 5′ and 3′ primers were 5′-CCTCCTGGCGGGACCTCATCG-3′ and 5′-ACCAGCTGGGACTTGAGGCAC-3′ for Fbs2 and 5′-GAGCTGAACGGGAAGCTCAC-3′ and 5′-ACCACCCTGTTGCTGTAGC-3′ for the glyceroaldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, respectively.Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—293T cells were transiently transfected with1 μg of the TCRα-HA expression plasmid and 1 μg of the Fbs2 plasmid or pcDNA3. Twenty-four hours after transfection, 293T cells were starved for 30 min in methionine- and cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum. Cells were then labeled for 30 min with 150 μCi of Pro-Mix l-35S in vitro cell-labeling mix (Amersham Biosciences) per milliliter. For pulse-chase experiments, cells were washed after labeling and chased with complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum for different lengths of time at 37 °C. In experiments with tunicamycin, cells were treated with 5 μm tunicamycin (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan) 2 h prior to and throughout the labeling period. In the experiments of Fbs2 knock-down by siRNA, cells that had been co-transfected with 4.2 μg (300 pmol) of siRNA duplex and 1 μg of the TCRα-HA expression plasmid and cultured for 48 h were metabolically labeled with the cell-labeling mix. After labeling or chase, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with TBS buffer containing 0.1% SDS and 1% Nonidet P-40. In co-immunoprecipitation experiments, TBS buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 was used for lysing. After one cycle of freezethaw, cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and the supernatants were used for immunoprecipitation. Briefly, the supernatants were precleared with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), mouse monoclonal antibodies, anti-FLAG (M2; Sigma), and anti-HA (HA11, BABCO) were then added, and incubation was performed at 4 °C with rotation. Immune complexes were then incubated with protein A-Sepharose, collected by centrifugation, and washed four times with the lysis buffer. For protein analysis, immune complexes were dissociated by heating in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and loaded onto SDS-PAGE. After drying, gels were exposed, and radioactive band intensity was measured using Molecular Imager FX. All experiments described in this study were approved by the institutional ethics review committee for animal experimentation.RESULTSFbs2 Interacts with High Mannose Oligosaccharide-containing Glycoproteins—We reported recently that Fbs1/Fbx2/NFB42 forms a SCFFbs1 ubiquitin ligase complex that targets N-linked high mannose oligosaccharides in glycoproteins for ubiquitylation (7Yoshida Y. Chiba T. Tokunaga F. Kawasaki H. Iwai K. Suzuki T. Ito Y. Matsuoka K. Yoshida M. Tanaka K. Tai T. Nature. 2002; 418: 438-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Fbs1 interacts with substrate glycoproteins through its C-terminal domain, which shows high homology with other F-box proteins (3Winston J.T. Koepp D.M. Zhu C. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1180-1182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 23Ilyin G.P. Serandour A.L. Pigeon C. Rialland M. Glaise D. Guguen-Guillouzo C. Gene. 2002; 296: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To explore the presence of other F-box proteins that recognize N-glycans, we isolated mouse cDNA clones that encode F-box proteins homologous to Fbs1 and examined the properties of the proteins with regard to interaction with N-linked glycoproteins. The mouse Fbs2/Fbx6b/FBG2, Fbx17/FBG4, and FBG3 cDNA clones obtained by reverse transcription PCR were expressed in 293T cells as FLAG-tagged, full-length F-box proteins, and these cell extracts were incubated with various N-linked glycoproteins. Only Fbs2 bound several glycoproteins, whereas the other F-box proteins failed to bind any of the glycoproteins tested (see Fig. 3, and data not shown).Next, we investigated the interaction of these F-box proteins with oligosaccharides on endogenous proteins by overlay assay. To enrich glycoproteins that were fractionated by their oligosaccharide structures, we prepared proteins bound to lectins from the extracts of several cell lines and adult mouse tissues. These glycoproteins were then separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by each 35S-labeled F-box protein. In glycoproteins bound to ConA, a lectin that binds to high mannose oligosaccharides, many protein bands were detected by Fbs1 and Fbs2 probes (Fig. 1). These glycoproteins did not bind to βTrCP1, which is a F-box protein with WD repeats for substrate recognition (1Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6792) Google Scholar, 2Deshaies R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 435-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). On the other hand, a few proteins reacted with Fbs1 and Fbs2 in the glycoproteins bound to RCA120, a lectin that binds to terminal Galβ1–4GlcNAc or WGA and is specific for terminal GlcNAc or sialic acids (Fig. 1). The broad 75–80-kDa protein band(s) and the 60-kDa protein in the WGA-bound fraction prepared from brain extract seemed to be identical to that bound to ConA. Because many proteins contain several and/or structurally diversified oligosaccharides, these 75–80-kDa and 60-kDa proteins may be modified by high mannose oligosaccharides and complex type glycans. The whole pattern of the protein bands detected by the Fbs2 probe was almost the same as those detected by Fbs1, but the strength of binding activity with Fbs2 seemed to be somewhat weak compared with Fbs1. Any glycoproteins concentrated with ConA, RCA120, and WGA lectins failed to be detected with Fbx17 and FBG3 probes (data not shown). These results suggest that high mannose oligosaccharides are important for the substrate recognition by Fbs2 as well as Fbs1.Fig. 1Interaction of Fbs2 and Fbs1 with endogenous glycoproteins containing N-linked high mannose type oligosaccharides. Each extract of Neuro2a (N2a), P19, PC12 cells, and tissues from adult mice (brain and testis) was incubated with ConA, RCA, or WGA lectin-agarose. The lectin-bound proteins were separated with 4–20% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to membranes that were used for the overlay assay. 35S-labeled Fbs2/Fbx6b ΔF, Fbs1/Fbx2 ΔN-2, and βTrCP1 ΔF were used for the probes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Expression of Fbs Genes in Mouse Tissues—Fbs1 is reported to be expressed in the adult rat brain but not in non-neural tissues (22Erhardt J.A.

We compared the expression patterns of Fbs1 and Fbs2 by Northern blot analysis in 12 different mouse tissues. This analysis demonstrated that the Fbs1 transcript of ∼1.5 kb mRNA was expressed in the brain and, to a lesser extent, in the testis (Fig. 2). Western blot analysis using Fbs1 polyclonal antiserums confirmed that Fbs1 protein is present only in the brain and testis among the 12 different tissues examined (data not shown). The transcription of Fbs1 appeared in 1-week-old mice, reaching the highest level in the adult brain. On the other hand, an ∼1.8-kb transcript of Fbs2 was detected in various tissues, mainly in the heart, intestine, kidney, liver, lung, muscle, stomach, and testis as well as other tissues (brain, skin, spleen, and thymus) with low abundance. Fbs2 expression was not observed in the fetus, but became detectable after birth and increased in the adult brain. Thus, although the expression of Fbs1 is restricted to the brain and testis, the Fbs2 transcript is ubiquitously expressed in all tissues examined.Fig. 2Expression of Fbs genes in mouse tissues. Total RNA was extracted from adult mouse tissues or mice brains at different stages of development. A membrane preloaded with 15 μg of total RNA per lane was hybridized with radiolabeled mouse Fbs1 and Fbs2 cDNAs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In Vitro Ubiquitylation Assay of Fbs2—To directly demonstrate the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity in SCFFbs2, we devised a fully reconstituted system for ubiquitylation of GTF in the presence of the NEDD8 system.

Ubiquitylation of GTF by GST-tagged ubiquitin was detected by immunoblotting using an anti-fetuin or anti-GST antibody. No ubiquitylation activity was detected in the absence of E1, E2, ATP, SCFFbs2, or GTF (Fig. 3A). The amount of ubiquitylation increased in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 3B).

By searching sequence databases with the M2 pore domain of ligand-gated anion channels, we identified potential Ca2+-activated Cl- channels, which included members of the bestrophin family. We cloned two bestrophins from Xenopus oocytes, which express high levels of Ca2+-activated Cl- channels. The Xenopus bestrophins were expressed in a variety of tissues. We predict that bestrophin has six transmembrane domains with the conserved RFP domain playing an integral part in ionic selectivity. When Xenopus bestrophins were heterologously expressed in human embryonic kidney-293 cells, large Ca2+-activated Cl- currents were observed. The currents are voltage- and time-independent, do not rectify, have a Kd for Ca2+ of ∼210 nm, and exhibit a permeability ratio of I- > Br- > Cl- >> aspartate. The W93C and G299E mutations produce non-functional channels that exert a dominant negative effect on wild type channels.

Calcium-activated Chloride Channels. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2002Google Scholar). Despite their physiological importance, the molecular identity of these channels remains in question. The CLCA family, initially cloned from bovine trachea by Cunningham et al. (2.Cunningham S.A. Awayda M.S. Bubien J.K. Ismailov I.I. Arrate M.P. Berdiev B.K. Benos D.J. Fuller C.M. J. Biol.

Gene. 1999; 228: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, CLCA proteins have not been universally accepted as Ca2+-activated Cl- channels for several reasons (8.Jentsch T.J. Stein V. Weinreich F. Zdebik A.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 503-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar, 9.Papassotiriou J. Eggermont J. Droogmans G. Nilius B. Pflugers Arch. 2001; 442: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The properties of CLCA-induced currents differ depending on the cell type in which they are expressed. Furthermore, some CLCAs are cell adhesion proteins or secreted proteins with poorly conserved trans-membrane architecture. Furthermore, the current is activated by very high, non-physiological Ca2+ concentrations, and native expression of CLCAs does not correlate with Ca2+-activated Cl- currents. Several years ago, we began an in silico approach to identify novel Cl- channel genes. Our previous studies on the endogenous Ca2+-activated Cl- channels of Xenopus oocytes suggested that these channels might have a pore architecture similar to ligand gated anion channels (LGACs) 1The abbreviations used are: LGACligand gated anion channelsRPEretinal pigment epitheliumGSTglutathione S-transferasexBest-2aXenopus bestrophin-2a (GenBank™ accession number AY273825)xBest-2bXenopus bestrophin-2b (GenBank™ accession number AY273826)GABAγ-aminobutyric acidRTreverse transcriptaseGFPgreen fluorescent proteinEGFPenhanced GFPHEKhuman embryonic kidneyGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenasePIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acidPBSphosphate-buffered salineWGAwheat germ agglutinin. of the GABA(A), GABA(C), and glycine receptor family (10.Qu Z.

LGACs and Ca2+-activated Cl- channels have similar anion selectivity sequences and similar pore dimensions. Furthermore, both are blocked by anion channel blockers that enter the pore selectively from the extracellular side, unlike cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator and ClC channels that seem to have the wide end of their pores oriented cytoplasmically (12.Machaca K.

The determinants of ligand-gated channel anion selectivity have been well studied. Mutagenesis of both anion- and cation-selective ligand-gated channels have established that three rings of charged residues formed by the M2 transmembrane domains of the channel subunits play a major role in ion selectivity (13.Lester H.A. Ann. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1992; 21: 267-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 14.Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1231-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). In LGACs, both the intermediate and extracellular rings are positively charged, whereas in cation-selective channels these residues are negatively charged. Although both the extracellular (15.Langosch D. Laube B. Rundstrom N. Schmieden V. Bormann J. Betz H.

Physiol. 1996; 107: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) contribute to ion selectivity, the intermediate ring is critical, because the pore tapers to a constriction at this point to bring the charged residues of the intermediate ring close to the permeant ion. This geometric constraint is apparently conferred on the channel by a proline residue at position -2′ (17.Keramidas A. Moorhouse A.J. French C.R. Schofield P.R. Barry P.H. Biophys.

Among the hits we obtained was a family of proteins called bestrophins. Human bestrophin-1 (VMD2) was positionally cloned in 1998 from a Swedish family with an inherited form of early onset macular degeneration called Best vitelliform macular dystrophy (19.Petrukhin K. Koisti M.J. Bakall B. Li W. Xie G. Marknell T. Sandgren O. Forsman K. Holmgren G. Andreasson S. Vujic M. Bergen A.A.B. McGarty-Dugan V. Figueroa D. Austin C.P. Metzker M.L. Caskey C.T. Wadelius C. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Bestrophin was initially thought to be involved in fatty acid transport (19.Petrukhin K. Koisti M.J. Bakall B. Li W. Xie G. Marknell T. Sandgren O. Forsman K. Holmgren G. Andreasson S. Vujic M. Bergen A.A.B. McGarty-Dugan V. Figueroa D. Austin C.P. Metzker M.L. Caskey C.T. Wadelius C. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar), but more recently (20.Sun H. Tsunenari T. Yau K.-W. Nathans J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4008-4013Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), it has been shown that human bestrophin-1 expressed in heterologous systems induces a chloride current. The possibility that bestrophin is a Cl- channel is particularly exciting, because the hallmark diagnostic feature of Best disease is an abnormal electro-oculogram (21.Francois J. De Rouck A. Fernandez-Sasso D. Arch. Ophthalmol. 1967; 77: 726-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 22.Deutman A.F. Arch. Ophthalmol. 1969; 81: 305-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The slow light peak of the electro-oculogram, which is reduced in Best disease, is thought to reflect an increase in Cl- conductance across the basolateral membrane of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) (23.Gallemore R.P. Hughes B.A. Miller S.S. Marmor M.F. Wolfensberger T.J. The Retinal Pigment Epithelium. Oxford University Press, Oxford1998Google Scholar). Trans-RPE transport plays an important role in maintaining the fluid and ionic composition of the fluid surrounding the photoreceptors. Recently (24.Marmorstein A.D. Mormorstein L.Y. Rayborn M. Wang X. Hollyfield J.G. Petrukhin K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12758-12763Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), it has been demonstrated that human bestrophin-1 is localized to the basolateral membrane of RPE, making it a candidate for the basolateral Cl- channel of RPE. In this paper, we report the cloning and expression of two bestrophins from Xenopus oocyte mRNA. These proteins have high similarity to human bestrophins and induce Cl- currents when expressed in heterologous systems. Cloning—Expressed sequence tags for Xenopus bestrophins were identified by BLAST searches using conserved domains of mammalian bestrophins. PCR primers were constructed, and full-length Xenopus bestrophins were obtained by RT-PCR using total RNA isolated from Xenopus oocytes. The resulting PCR products were subcloned into TOPO-PCRII and sequenced in both forward and reverse directions. Each clone was sequenced at least three times. xBest-2b was subcloned into pIRES2-EGFP (Invitrogen) by PCR. The forward PCR primer contained a BglII restriction site, and the reverse primer contained a SacII restriction site for insertion into the pIRES2-EGFP vector. Site-specific Mutation of xBest-2a—Site-specific mutations were made using a PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis kit (QuikChange; Stratagene). Specific mutations were introduced into primers. The template, xBest-2a in pCMV-Sport6, was amplified with the Pfu DNA polymerase by the polymerase chain reaction. The methylated original templates were digested with DpnI, and the PCR products were transformed into XL-1 Blue Escherichia coli. Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Heterologous Expression of Bestrophins in HEK-293 Cells—xBest-2a subcloned in pCMV-Sport6 was transfected into HEK-293 cells with pIRES2-EGFP vector at a ratio of 10:1. xBest-2b was subcloned in pIRES2-EGFP vector. Plasmid transfection was carried out with Fu-GENE 6 kit (Roche Applied Science) or Ca2+-PO4 precipitation (Clontech). Transfected cells were dissociated and replated 1 day after transfection and spread on glass coverslips. Fluorescent cells were used for patch clamp experiments within 3 days. Antibody Production—Antibodies were raised against a peptide of xBest-2a. The amino acid sequence was EFQSQEPIQDPPYN, which corresponds to amino acids 451-464 of xBest-2a. xBest-2b differs in six of these 14 residues (VFQFPETVQDPPNN). BLAST hits with an E value <10 included only xBest-2a. Peptides were synthesized by Research Genetics (Invitrogen) using multiple antigenic peptide resin technology to enhance antigenic response. The peptides (with a cysteine added to the C terminus) were conjugated to KLH (keyhole limpet hemocyanin), emulsified with an equal volume of Freud's incomplete adjuvant, and injected into two New Zealand White rabbits. The animals received a boost after two, six, and eight weeks. Sera were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot analysis with GST fusion proteins of bestrophins. The sera were then affinity-purified. GST Fusion Proteins—GST fusion proteins of several bestrophins were engineered by subcloning the bestrophin C-terminal tail into pGEX-4T expression vectors (Amersham Biosciences) in-frame with GST. The C-terminal fragments used for xBest-2a and xBest-2b were residues 291-512 (GEQLIN... LSVAT). The resulting GST fusion protein consisted of N-terminal GST followed by the C-terminal fragments of the bestrophin. The fusion proteins were grown in BL21-Gold(DE3) competent E. coli (Stratagene) and induced by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at a final concentration of 1 mm for 3-4 h at 37 °C. Bacterial pellets were resuspended in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 40 mm EDTA, 2.5% sucrose, 0.02% NaN3, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2.5 mg/ml lysozyme, and protease inhibitor mixture set II (5 μl/20 mg bacteria; Calbiochem). The lysate was subjected to French press twice at 1000 p.s.i. The lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 min and then passed over a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Biosciences). The fusion proteins were eluted from the columns with 10 mm reduced glutathione, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Total RNA Isolation and Purification—Total RNA from Xenopus RPE, neural retina, brain, spleen, gut, lung, liver, blood, heart, and oocyte were isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen), a monophasic solution of phenol and guanidine isothiocyanate. Tissue (1 g/10 ml Trizol) was homogenized using a Polytron (Brinkman) homogenizer. The Trizol was extracted two times with chloroform, and the total RNA was recovered by precipitation with isopropyl alcohol. DNA was removed by DNase treatment and DNA-free™ (Ambion). Semi-quantitative PCR—cDNA was synthesized from total RNA using ThermoScript™ reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) primed with oligo(dT). The reaction mixture contained 4 μg of total RNA, 2.5 μm oligo(dT), 1 mm dNTP mix, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 units/μl RNaseOUT, and 0.75 units/μl ThermoScript™ reverse transcriptase. The cDNA was amplified by using xBest-2a specific primers and SYBR Green JumpStart™ Taq ReadyMix™ (Sigma). The concentration of primers was 40 nm. Data were analyzed with iCycler software, which determines the threshold cycle for each sample. The house keeping gene GAPDH of the same cDNA sample was also amplified. The quantification of the xBest-2a gene is defined by the ratio of the threshold cycle values of xBest-2a against the GAPDH in the same sample. The thermocycler used for quantitative detection was iCycler (Bio-Rad), and the protocol was as follows: one cycle at 95 °C for 2 min, 40 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 30 s. The primers for xBest-2a were 5′-TTG GCT GAA GGT GGG TGA ACA-3′ and 5′-GGG CGC GGG TCT GAG TGA TT-3′. The primers for GAPDH were 5′-GAC CTG CCG CCT GCA GAA G-3′ and 5′-GAC TAG CAG GAT GGG CGA C-3′. SDS-PAGE and Western Blots—Xenopus laevis were acutely decapitated, and organs were quickly collected and weighed. The organs were homogenized (50 mg tissue per ml) in the LSB buffer (60 mm NaCl, 25 mm Na-PIPES, pH 6.9, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm NaN3, 0.3 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100-fold diluted protease inhibitor mixture III (Calbiochem)). SDS was added to a final concentration of 1%. DNA was sheared by passing the solution through a 20-gauge needle. Protein concentration was measured by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) and checked with Coomassie Blue staining in gels. Protein samples were run on 4-15% gradient polyacrylamide gels in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 200 mm glycine, 0.5% SDS with ∼10 μg of protein per well. The proteins were transferred electrophoretically to Hybond nitrocellulose membranes in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 200 mm glycine, 20% methanol. The membranes were blocked with 5% dry milk in PBS-T (PBS with 0.1% Tween 20) overnight at 4 °C or 1 h at room temperature. The blot was incubated with primary antibody (1/1000 dilution) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1/7000) (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) in PBS-T with 1% dry milk. Immunoreactivity was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL kit; Amersham Biosciences). Immunocytochemistry—HEK-293 cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, for 2 h. The cells were washed three times with PBS (136 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 6 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.3) and then blocked with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 3% bovine serum albumin, and 10% normal goat serum for 30 min. The cells were then incubated at 4 °C overnight with 180 ng/ml affinity-purified A5925 in PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin overnight. The cells were then washed extensively with PBS and incubated with Alexa-488 (Molecular Probes)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes) diluted 1:200. The cells were visualized using a Zeiss 510 confocal microscope. Electrophysiological Methods—Recordings were performed using the whole-cell recording configuration of the patch clamp technique. Patch pipettes were made of borosilicate glass (Sutter Instrument Co., Novato, CA), pulled by a Sutter P-2000 puller (Sutter Instrument Co.), and fire-polished. Patch pipettes had resistances of 3-5 megohms filled with the standard intracellular solution (see below). The bath was grounded via a 3 m KCl-agar bridge connected to a Ag-AgCl- reference electrode. Solution changes were performed by gravity-feed of the 1-ml chamber at a speed of ∼4 ml/min. To measure the steady-state current-voltage relationship, the cells were voltage-clamped from a holding potential of 0 mV with 700-ms-duration pulses from -100 to +100 mV. To measure the instantaneous current-voltage relationship, a pre-pulse was first applied to +100 mV for 200 ms and then 500-ms-duration voltage steps were applied between -100 and +100 mV. Data were acquired by an Axopatch 200A amplifier controlled by Clampex 8.1 via a Digidata 1322A data acquisition system (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Experiments were conducted at room temperature (∼24 °C). Recording Solutions—The standard pipette solution contained the following (in mm): 146 CsCl, 2 MgCl2, 5 Ca2+-EGTA, 8 HEPES, 10 sucrose, pH 7.3. The “zero” free Ca2+ pipette solution contained 5 mm EGTA without added Ca2+ whereas high free Ca2+ pipette solution contained 5 mm Ca2+-EGTA made by the pH-metric method described by in Ref. 25.Tsien R.Y. Pozzan T. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 172: 230-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar. Working solutions having different free Ca2+ were prepared by mixing the zero-Ca2+ solution with the high Ca2+ solution in various ratios. The free [Ca2+] was calculated from the equation [Ca2+] = Kd × [Ca2+-EGTA]/[EGTA], where Kd is the Kd of EGTA (Kd = 1.0 × 10-7m at 24 °C, pH 7.3, ionic strength 0.16 m). The calculated Ca2+ concentrations were confirmed in each solution by Fura-2 (Molecular Probes) measurements using an LS-50B luminescence spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). In some experiments, pipette solution contained the following (in mm): 148 CsCl, 2 MgCl2, 0.5 CaCl2, 5 EGTA, 8 HEPES, pH 7.3, with free [Ca2+] = 164 nm. The standard extracellular solution contained the following (in mm): 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 15 glucose, 10 HEPES, pH 7.4. When Cl- was substituted with another anion, NaCl was replaced with NaX, where X is the substitute anion. Solution osmolarity was 300 mosm for both intra- and extracellular solutions (Micro Osmometer, Model 3300; Advanced Instrument, Inc., Norword, MA). Slight differences in osmolarity were adjusted by addition of sucrose. Analysis of Data—For the calculations and graphical presentation, we used Origin 6.0 software (Microcal, Northampton, MA). Relative halide permeability of the channels was determined by measuring the shift in Erev upon changing the bath solution from one containing 151 mm Cl- to another with 140 mmX and 11 mm Cl-, where X is the substitute anion. The permeability ratio was estimated using the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation (26.Hille B. Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes, 2nd Ed. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA1992Google Scholar), PX/PCl = [Cl-]i/([X]o exp(ΔErevF/RT)) - [Cl-]o/[X]o, where ΔErev is the difference between the reversal potential with the test anion X and that observed with symmetrical Cl-, and F, R, and T have their normal thermodynamic meanings. Accession Numbers—xBest-2a has been entered in GenBank™ as accession number AY273825, and xBest-2b has been entered as AY273826.

Fig. 1 shows an alignment of the M2 domain of the human GABA(A) α1 subunit with four human bestrophins. The residues of the GABA(A) receptor are labeled in accordance with Keramidas (18.Keramidas A.

Physiol. 2002; 119: 393-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) with the arginines of the intermediate and extracellular rings located at position 0′ and 19′, respectively. The homology between the bestrophins and the GABA(A) receptor in this region is rather weak (19% identity, 39% strong similarity). However, the critical residues for GABA(A) receptor ion selectivity are conserved: the 19′ Rofthe extracellular ring, the 0′ R of the intermediate ring, the -5′ negative charge of the cytoplasmic ring, and the -2′ proline at the pore constriction. The physical properties of the M2 domain of the human GABA(A)R and the RFP domain of xBest-2a are quite similar (Table I). Interestingly, the RFP sequence (positions 0 to -2′) of the bestrophins that corresponds to the intermediate ring and associated proline of the GABA receptor is invariant among all 40+ members of the bestrophin family for which sequences are available, from Caenorhabditis elegans to human. This strongly suggests that the RFP sequence is crucial to channel function. We propose it is involved in ion selectivity.Table IPhysical properties of the M2 domain of GABA receptor and xBest-2a RFP domainHuman GABA(A)R α1xBest2aIsoelectric point9.610.9Acidic (D,E)11Basic (K,R)24Polar (N,C,Q,S,T,Y)96Hydrophobic (A,I,L,F,W,V)1013 Open table in a new tab Because Ca2+-activated Cl- channels are expressed at high levels in Xenopus oocytes (12.Machaca K. Qu Z. Kuruma A. Hartzell H.C. McCarty N. Fuller, C.M. Calcium-activated Chloride Channels. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2002Google Scholar), we used the sequences obtained from mammalian bestrophins to find expressed sequence tags for Xenopus bestrophins. One Xenopus expressed sequence tag (BE669309, Image clone 3401219) was obtained and sequenced and found to be a full-length bestrophin. The sequence was confirmed by sequencing full-length PCR products obtained by RT-PCR of mRNA isolated from Xenopus oocyte mRNA. At least three overlapping sequencing runs were performed. The PCR products from different clones differed reproducibly in sequence from one another, so new primers were designed to amplify a second, closely related transcript (xBest-2b). Fig. 2 compares the sequences of the two Xenopus bestrophins to four human bestrophins. Evolutionary relationships between 15 vertebrate bestrophins for which complete sequence information is available were determined by the neighbor joining method of Saitou and Nei (32.Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). The bestrophins from Zebrafish, Fugu, Xenopus, mouse, rat, and human fall into four groups with the both Xenopus bestrophins being in group 2. The two Xenopus bestrophins are 89% identical. Because X. laevis is pseudo-tetraploid, and xBest-2a and xBest-2b are more closely related to one another than any of the four human bestrophins are to one another, we believe that the Xenopus bestrophins are orthologs.Fig. 3Properties of bestrophins.A, cladogram of vertebrate bestrophins. The relationships between Xenopus (x), human (h), mouse (m), Fugu (f), rat (r), and zebrafish (z) bestrophins were determined using the method of Saitou and Nei (32.Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar). Accession numbers are as in Fig. 2, except that Fugu sequences were obtained from the Fugu Genomics Project Assembly (fBest1 is SINFRUP00000141703, fBest2 is SINFRUP00000151123, and fBest-3 is SINFRUP00000134584). The Zebrafish bestrophins were cloned in our laboratory.2B, hydropathy analysis of xBest-2a by the Kyte-Doolittle algorithm (38.Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17296) Google Scholar) with a window of 17 residues shows six distinct hydrophobic domains. This finding, coupled with the results of the SOSUI transmembrane prediction shown in Fig. 2, suggests six transmembrane domains. C, proposed topology of xBest-2a. Transmembrane domains are shaded yellow. Positively charged residues are red, negatively charged residues are blue, and proline is orange. Note the location of the RFP sequence at the cytoplasmic end of transmembrane helix 4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) All bestrophins are highly conserved in the first ∼300 residues but differ significantly in the C-terminal third of the protein. xBest-2a is 95% identical to xBest-2b in the first 307 amino acids but only 85% identical in the remaining 205 amino acids. xBest-2a is 81% identical to hBest-2 in the first 307 amino acids but only 50% identical from residue 307 to the end. The Xenopus bestrophins contain multiple protein kinase A, casein kinase, and protein kinase C phosphorylation consensus (PROSITE) sequences, but only three were conserved in the human proteins (Fig. 2). Thr-164 is a predicted casein kinase site that is conserved in all six bestrophins shown here and is conserved in a majority of the other bestrophins we have examined. Thr-6 and Thr-216 are predicted protein kinase C phosphorylation sites found in four and three, respectively, of the bestrophins shown here. The other phosphorylation sites were not conserved across species. Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy analysis of xBest-2a with a window of 17 found six hydrophobic domains (Fig. 3B). The SOSUI algorithm predicted six transmembrane domains (shown as red lines over the sequence in Fig. 2). The (150)RFP sequence is at the C-terminal end of the 4th transmembrane domain and thus would be predicted to be located at the cytoplasmic mouth of the channel. Fig. 3C shows our model for xBest-2a bestrophin topology. Semi-quantitative PCR—Real-time PCR was used to evaluate the tissue-specific expression of xBest-2. The primers that were chosen were identical to sequences in both xBest-2a and xBest-2b. Thus, the quantification represents the total of both orthologs (Fig. 4). xBest-2 mRNA is expressed at high levels in RPE, liver, and spleen and to a lesser extent in neural retina and lung. Relatively little message was found in brain, heart, and gut. Even though we were able to RT-PCR full-length xBest-2a and xBest-2b from RNA isolated from oocyte, we were unable to quantify the level of xBest-2 message by real-time PCR. Western Blot Analysis—Polyclonal antibodies were developed to peptide sequences of the Xenopus bestrophins. Affinity-purified antibody A5925 was raised against residues 441-454 of xBest-2a (EFQSQEPIQDPPYN). This antibody specifically recognized GST fusion prote"
https://openalex.org/W2016665004,"Studies of prokaryotic chromosome replication have focused almost exclusively on organisms with one chromosome. We defined and characterized the origins of replication of the two Vibrio cholerae chromosomes, oriCI(vc) and oriCII(vc). OriCII(vc) differs from the origin assigned by bioinformatic analysis and is unrelated to oriCI(vc). OriCII(vc)-based replication requires an internal 12 base pair repeat and two hypothetical genes that flank oriCII(vc). One of these genes is conserved among diverse genera of the family Vibrionaceae and encodes an origin binding protein. The other gene codes for an RNA and not a protein. OriCII(vc)- but not oriCI(vc)-based replication is negatively regulated by a DNA sequence adjacent to oriCII(vc). There is an unprecedented requirement for DNA adenine methyltransferase in both oriCI(vc)- and oriCII(vc)-based replication. Our studies of replication in V. cholerae indicate that microorganisms having multiple chromosomes may utilize unique mechanisms for the control of replication."

https://openalex.org/W1985239521,"Many hormones activate transcription by raising the level of cAMP within cells. In one well studied pathway, cAMP induces protein kinase A to phosphorylate the transcription factor CREB, which binds to a consensus sequence, the cAMP-regulated enhancer, found in many target genes. A generally accepted model suggests that phosphorylated CREB recruits the histone acetyltransferase CBP to activate transcription. In contrast, histone deacetylases have been linked to the cessation of CREB-dependent transcription. Here we tested this model in the regulation of endogenous CREB target genes. We used a constitutively active CREB mutant and microarray analysis to identify target genes in PC12 cells. We then tested the role of histone deacetylase activity in cAMP activation of four of these genes (c-FOS, ICER, NOR-1, and NUR77) by treating cells with the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A. Consistent with the generally accepted model, trichostatin A enhanced activation of c-FOS and NUR77 by cAMP. Surprisingly, trichostatin A blocked activation of ICER and NOR-1. The block of ICER and NOR-1 activation persisted in the presence of cycloheximide, indicating that the trichostatin A effect did not depend on new protein synthesis. This unexpected role of histone deacetylases in transcriptional activation of certain endogenous CREB target genes was not apparent in transfected reporter genes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis indicated that the differential roles of histone deacetylases in activating or repressing CREB target genes was manifested at the level of preinitiation complex recruitment. These data indicate that histone deacetylases differentially regulate CREB target genes by contributing to either activation or cessation of transcription.

Hormones regulate gene transcription by initiating signal transduction cascades that ultimately influence the activity of transcription factors at promoters (1Brivanlou A.H. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 2002; 295: 813-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). These factors in turn recruit coregulators that either activate or repress transcription (2Pazin M.J. Kadonaga J.T.

Coregulators fall into several groups based on the functions they perform, including physically linking transcription factors and RNA polymerase II (4Rachez C. Freedman L.P. Curr. Opin.

Perhaps the best studied of the histone-modifying proteins are the numerous enzymes that either add (histone acetyltransferases (HATs) 1The abbreviations used are: HATs, histone acetyltransferases; HDACs, histone deacetylases; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; CREs, cAMP-response elements; TSA, trichostatin A; RT, reverse transcriptase.) or remove (histone deacetylases (HDACs)) acetyl groups from histone tail lysines. Activating transcription factors have been found to recruit HATs, whereas repressors recruit HDACs (for a review, see 8). Hence, a general model has emerged in which HATs mediate activation and HDACs mediate repression. Many hormones and neurotransmitters regulate transcription via the transcription factor CREB. CREB is expressed ubiquitously in all tissues, and CREB-regulated transcription has been implicated in a large number of physiological processes, including learning and memory (9Kandel E.R. Science. 2001; 294: 1030-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (2708) Google Scholar), neuronal survival (10Lonze B.E. Ginty D.D. Neuron. 2002; 35: 605-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1757) Google Scholar), and T-cell development (11Rudolph D. Tafuri A. Gass P. Hammerling G.J. Arnold B. Schutz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4481-4486Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). A consideration of known CREB target genes suggests functions in many other tissues as well (for a review, see Ref. 12Mayr B. Montminy M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 599-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2084) Google Scholar). Thus, elucidating the mechanism of transcriptional activation by CREB is important for understanding many aspects of physiology. Hormones can regulate transcription via CREB by causing an elevation of the second messenger cAMP, which activates protein kinase A. Protein kinase A phosphorylates CREB at serine 133 (13Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2064) Google Scholar). CREB binds to cAMP-response elements (CREs) in promoters of many cAMP-regulated genes, and its phosphorylation recruits the HAT CBP to activate transcription (12Mayr B. Montminy M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 599-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2084) Google Scholar). One recent study suggested that HDAC1 simultaneously associates with CREB and protein phosphatase 1, thereby causing dephosphorylation of CREB and the attenuation of transcription (14Canettieri G. Morante I. Guzman E. Asahara H. Herzig S. Anderson S.D. Yates III, J.R. Montminy M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Indeed, the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) has been shown to enhance activation of CRE reporter genes by cAMP (14Canettieri G. Morante I. Guzman E. Asahara H. Herzig S. Anderson S.D. Yates III, J.R. Montminy M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 15Lu Q. Hutchins A.E. Doyle C.M. Lundblad J.R. Kwok R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15727-15734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Thus, the regulation of transcription by CREB, at least in the context of transfected reporter genes, appears to conform to the general model of HATs mediating activation and HDACs mediating repression. In the present study, we tested this model by examining the role of HDACs in the regulation of transcription of endogenous CREB target genes by cAMP. First, we used a DNA microarray screen to identify genes up-regulated by a constitutively active CREB mutant. Then we measured activation of four of these genes (c-FOS, ICER, NOR-1, and NUR77) by cAMP in the absence and presence of the HDAC inhibitor TSA. CREB target genes could be grouped into two subsets based on the effects of TSA as follows: one in which TSA augments transcription activated by cAMP (c-FOS and NUR77) and another in which TSA blocks transcription (ICER and NOR-1). The augmentation of c-FOS and NUR77 transcription by TSA indicates that HDAC activity inhibits activation of these genes. In contrast, the inhibition of ICER and NOR-1 transcription by TSA shows that HDAC activity is required for cAMP activation of a subset of endogenous CREB target genes. This requirement for HDAC activity was not recapitulated in a stably incorporated reporter gene driven by the ICER promoter; activation of this reporter gene was actually slightly augmented by TSA. Thus, transfected reporter genes may be subject to different regulatory mechanisms than genes in their native chromatin environment. Cell Culture, Drug Treatments, and Reporter Gene Assays—For all experiments, PC12 cells were grown on poly-d-lysine-coated plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% neonatal calf serum and 5% fetal bovine serum plus 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 units/ml streptomycin. Medium for PC12 stable cell lines was supplemented with 700 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Reporter genes stably incorporated into cell lines were 6× -CRE-lacZ (16Meinkoth J. Alberts A.S. Feramisco J.R. CIBA Found. Symp. 1990; 150: 47-51PubMed Google Scholar) and ICER-Luc, which consisted of –189 to +1 of the rat ICER promoter (numbering according to Ref. 17Molina C.A. Foulkes N.S. Lalli E. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 1993; 75: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar) cloned into the pGL3 luciferase vector (Promega). Cells were serumstarved (using media containing 0.5% neonatal calf serum and 0.25% fetal bovine serum) for 16 h prior to drug treatments. Drugs (all from Calbiochem) were used at the following concentrations: forskolin, 10 μm; trichostatin A, 100 ng/ml; apicidin, 1 μm, cycloheximide, 50 μg/ml. β-Galactosidase and luciferase activities were determined with a luminometer (EG&G Berthold AutoLumat) and Tropix reagents (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Statistical analyses of reporter gene assay data (one-way analysis of variance and post tests using the Bonferroni correction) were performed with PRISM software (GraphPad). Affymetrix Microarray Screen—PC12 cells in 6-well plates were transfected with 1 μg of VP16-CREB expression vector (VP16-CREB in pcDNA3 from Invitrogen) or empty expression vector (pcDNA3) for 12 h with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). This procedure typically resulted in transfection of 60–90% of cells, as determined by separate transfections of a green fluorescent protein expression vector (data not shown). Total RNA was extracted 12 h after the end of the transfection with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Microarray assays were performed in the Affymetrix Microarray Core of the Oregon Health and Science University Gene Microarray Shared Resource, which uses Affymetrix Expression Analysis software (www.ohsu.edu/gmsr/amc/). The screen was performed in duplicate on Affymetrix Rat Genome U34A microarray chips, and the genes listed in Table I were up-regulated in both screens.Table IGenes up-regulated by VP16-CREB in PC12 cellsCREB target geneFold inductionCREs in promoterNOR-1 aThese genes have multiple names: NOR-1 is also known as MINOR/TEC/CHN/NOR-2/NR4A3; NUR77 is also known as NGFI-B/TR3/NAK1/N10/ST59/TIS1/NR4A2; PC3 is also known as TIS21/BTG2/APRO1; RNR-1 is also known as NOT/TINUR/HZF-3; and EGR-4 is also known as NGFI-C.

Transfected cells were plated onto poly-d-lysine-coated plates, cultured for 24 h, and serum-starved for 2 h before drug treatments. RT-PCR Assay—Total RNA was collected with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Contaminating genomic DNA was removed with the DNA-free kit (Ambion). First strand cDNA synthesis was performed with Superscript II (Invitrogen). PCR primers were as described for ICER (19Tinti C.

PCR products were verified by DNA sequencing. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed according to the Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., protocol (www.upstate.com), with the following exceptions. 5–10 × 106 cells were used for each sample. Formaldehyde fixation was performed at room temperature. Cells were lysed in 200 μl of RIPA lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm NaPO4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.8). Sonicated lysate was brought up to 1 ml with RIPA buffer (same as RIPA lysis buffer except with 0.1% SDS). Antibodies (both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) used for chromatin immunoprecipitations were H-224 (pol II) and C-18 (TFIIB). Low salt wash buffer was RIPA buffer. High salt wash buffer was RIPA buffer with 500 mm NaCl. DNA was purified from eluates from protein A/G beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) with the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). The following primers were used to amplify the ICER, c-FOS, and NUR77 promoters in 35-cycle PCRs with Qiagen Taq: CATTCGGGTGGTTTATTACAGGAAGAG (ICER forward primer); GTGGTCTTATTGGCCGTACCACAGTCC (ICER reverse primer); TCCTACATGCGGAGGGTCCAGGAGAC (c-FOS forward primer); GAGTAGTAGGCGCCTCAGCTGGCCG (c-FOS reverse primer); TCACGCGCGCAGACATTCCA (NUR77 forward primer); and CACCTCTTAAGCGCTCCGTGA (NUR77 reverse primer). PCR products were electrophoresed on agarose gels and detected with ethidium bromide. Identification of CREB Target Genes—To identify CREB target genes, we used a constitutively active CREB mutant, VP16-CREB, which consisted of the transcriptional activation domain of the herpes simplex protein VP16 fused to the basic/leucine zipper dimerization and DNA-binding domain of CREB (22Hoeffler J.P. Meyer T.E. Yun Y. Jameson J.L. Habener J.F. Science. 1988; 242: 1430-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). VP16-CREB can bind to CREs in the promoters of endogenous CREB target genes and produces robust activation (23Riccio A. Ahn S. Davenport C.M. Blendy J.A. Ginty D.D. Science. 1999; 286: 2358-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). We chose to use VP16-CREB to up-regulate CREB target genes rather than an agent that would raise the level of cAMP, because such a stimulus would also up-regulate genes through pathways that do not involve CREB (24Richards J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). VP16-CREB was transfected into PC12 cells, and up-regulated genes were detected on Affymetrix DNA microarrays. Table I lists nine CREB target genes that were strongly up-regulated by VP16-CREB 12 h after transfection. All except NUR77 are known to have CREs in their promoters (17Molina C.A. Foulkes N.S.

A. 1992; 89: 4739-4743Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the NUR77 promoter contains four AP-1 elements (32Watson M.A. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4213-4219Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and that JunD, rather than CREB, binds to these sites (33Yoon J.K. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7731-7743Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, these proposed AP-1 elements, which have the sequence TGCGTCA, differ from the canonical AP-1 element (TGACTCA; Ref. 34Lee W. Mitchell P. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 49: 741-752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar) by two nucleotides and actually better resemble the consensus CRE (TGACGTCA; Ref. 35Montminy M.R. Sevarino K.A. Wagner J.A. Mandel G. Goodman R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6682-6686Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar). Indeed, the NUR77 elements contain the central CpG that is critical for CREB binding (36Schumacher M.A. Goodman R.H. Brennan R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35242-35247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). All CREB target genes in Table I are known to be cAMP-inducible except EGR-4 (17Molina C.A.

In Fig. 1A, we used RT-PCR assays to determine the time course of activation of ICER, c-FOS, NOR-1, and NUR77 produced by forskolin, an activator of adenylyl cyclase. ICER is a product of an intronic promoter within the CREM gene (17Molina C.A. Foulkes N.S. Lalli E. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 1993; 75: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar) and contains only the CREM CRE-binding domain. The lack of an activation domain makes ICER a repressor of CRE-mediated transcription (17Molina C.A. Foulkes N.S. Lalli E. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 1993; 75: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). NOR-1 and NUR77 are orphan nuclear receptors (21Maruyama K. Tsukada T. Bandoh S. Sasaki K. Ohkura N. Yamaguchi K. Cancer Lett. 1995; 96: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). All four were activated robustly over the course of 1 h of forskolin treatment, with c-FOS and NUR77 having the earliest responses. The strength of the induction by forskolin was anticipated given the presence of multiple CRE elements in the promoters of these genes. Thus, the chimeric VP16-CREB protein identified highly inducible CREB target genes in PC12 cells. To confirm the CREB dependence of cAMP activation of ICER, c-FOS, NOR-1, and NUR77, we used the dominant negative CREB inhibitor A-CREB. A-CREB consists of the CREB leucine zipper domain with an acidic amphipathic extension on its N terminus (18Ahn S. Olive M. Aggarwal S. Krylov D. Ginty D.D. Vinson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 967-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). We transfected A-CREB into PC12 cells and selected transfected cells with a MACS selection kit (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fig. 1B shows that A-CREB inhibited induction of ICER, c-FOS, NOR-1, and NUR77 by forskolin. These data further confirm that these four genes are CREB target genes. HDAC Activity Is Required for Activation of a Subset of CREB Target Genes—To test the role of HDACs in transcriptional regulation of CREB target genes, we treated PC12 cells with the HDAC inhibitor TSA for 30 min prior to forskolin stimulation. Fig. 2A shows that TSA had gene-specific effects. TSA slightly enhanced activation of c-FOS and NUR77, as has been reported previously (39Jang T.H. Sun S.H. Chin. J. Physiol. 2000; 43: 149-158PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, TSA treatment alone produced modest activation of c-FOS and NUR77 (Fig. 2C) as has been observed previously (39Jang T.H. Sun S.H. Chin. J. Physiol. 2000; 43: 149-158PubMed Google Scholar, 41Naranjo J.R. Mellstrom B. Auwerx J. Mollinedo F. Sassone-Corsi R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3605-3610Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and this effect was not blocked by A-CREB, indicating that it is CREB-independent (Fig. 2D). Surprisingly, TSA inhibited the forskolin-induced activation of ICER and NOR-1. Fig. 2B shows that apicidin, an HDAC inhibitor that is structurally distinct from TSA (for a review, see Ref. 40Johnstone R.W. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 287-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar), also inhibited ICER transcription. Thus, HDAC activity is required for activation of a subset of CREB target genes. In principle, the inhibitory effect of HDAC inhibitors on ICER and NOR-1 transcription could be due to either a direct action (i.e. inhibition of an HDAC or HDACs required for activation of transcription) or an indirect action (e.g. de novo synthesis of a transcription factor that represses ICER and NOR-1). To rule out an indirect action, we tested the ability of TSA to inhibit forskolin-induced ICER and NOR-1 transcription in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. Fig. 3 shows that TSA inhibition of ICER and NOR-1 transcription was intact in the presence of cycloheximide. Thus, TSA does not block transcription of ICER and NOR-1 through an indirect action that requires protein synthesis. Inhibition by TSA Does Not Occur in Stably Transfected CRE-driven Reporter Genes—The cAMP inducibility of the ICER and NOR-1 promoters is mediated by regions that contain four and three tandem CREs, respectively (17Molina C.A. Foulkes N.S. Lalli E. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 1993; 75: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 25Ohkura N. Ito M. Tsukada T. Sasaki K. Yamaguchi K. Miki K. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 211: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We tested whether inhibition of CREB target gene activation by TSA could be recapitulated in reporter genes driven by promoters containing multiple CREs. First, we used PC12 cells containing a stably incorporated reporter gene driven by six tandem CREs (16Meinkoth J. Alberts A.S. Feramisco J.R. CIBA Found. Symp. 1990; 150: 47-51PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 4A shows that TSA did not block but rather augmented activation of the 6× -CRE reporter gene by forskolin. Next, we tested whether the region of the ICER promoter that contains four tandem CREs was sensitive to inhibition by TSA. A reporter gene containing this region of the ICER promoter was stably incorporated into PC12 cells. Fig. 4B shows that TSA produced a small but statistically significant augmentation of activation of the stably incorporated ICER promoter reporter gene by forskolin. Thus, the CRE-containing portion of the ICER promoter is not sufficient to confer sensitivity to inhibition by TSA in the context of a stably incorporated reporter gene. Inhibition of CREB target gene activation by TSA is only observed in endogenous genes. HDAC Activity Differentially Regulates pol II and TFIIB Recruitment to the ICER, c-FOS, and NUR77 Promoters—Inhibition of ICER and NOR-1 expression by TSA could be due to a block of transcription or rapid degradation of ICER and NOR-1 mRNA. To test these two possibilities, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation assays to examine recruitment of pol II and TFIIB to the ICER promoter. Due to the high content of AC repeats and GC-rich regions, we were unable"

NHX-2 is a Caenorhabditis elegans Na+/H+ exchanger expressed exclusively at the apical membrane of intestinal epithelial cells. The inactivation of various intestinal nutrient transport proteins has been shown previously to influence aging via metabolic potential and a mechanism resembling caloric restriction. We report here a functional coupling of NHX-2 activity with nutrient uptake that results in long lived worms. Gene inactivation of nhx-2 by RNAi led to a loss of fat stores in the intestine and a 40% increase in longevity. The NHX-2 protein was coincidentally expressed with OPT-2, an oligopeptide transporter that is driven by a transmembrane proton gradient and that is also known to be involved in fat accumulation. Gene inactivation of opt-2 led to a phenotype resembling that of nhx-2, although not as severe. In order to explore this potential functional interaction, we combined RNA interference with a genetically encoded, fluorescence-based reagent to measure intestinal intracellular pH (pH i) in live worms under physiological conditions. Our results suggest first that OPT-2 is the main dipeptide uptake pathway in the nematode intestine, and second that dipeptide uptake results in intestinal cell acidification, and finally that recovery following dipeptide-induced acidification is normally a function of NHX-2. The loss of NHX-2 protein results in decreased steady-state intestinal cell pH i , and we hypothesize that this change perturbs proton-coupled nutrient uptake processes such as performed by OPT-2. Our data demonstrate a functional role for a Na+/H+ exchanger in nutrient absorption in vivo and lays the groundwork for examining integrated acid-base physiology in a non-mammalian model organism. Na+/H+ exchangers are involved in cell volume regulation, fluid secretion and absorption, and pH homeostasis. NHX-2 is a Caenorhabditis elegans Na+/H+ exchanger expressed exclusively at the apical membrane of intestinal epithelial cells. The inactivation of various intestinal nutrient transport proteins has been shown previously to influence aging via metabolic potential and a mechanism resembling caloric restriction.

Na+/H+ exchangers mediate the electroneutral transfer of extracellular Na+ for an intracellular H+ (for review see Refs. 1Hayashi H. Szaszi K. Grinstein S. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

This class of protein has been implicated in cell volume regulation, net bicarbonate movement, and Na+ reabsorption and is thought to have a housekeeping role in maintaining pH homeostasis (5Repishti M.

Caenorhabditis elegans is a simple alternative model organism with a high degree of similarity to mammals both physiologically and genetically. As the entire repertoire of nine potential Na+/H+ exchanger homologs has recently been cloned from C. elegans (11Nehrke K. Melvin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29036-29044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), we have utilized a combination of reverse genetics and a novel technique for in vivo pH measurements to assess the role of one of these isoforms in normal gut function. Nutrient uptake processes in absorptive epithelia such as the intestine can be coupled to inward movement of a proton and thus tied indirectly to the cellular resting pH. Although it has long been known that the rate of substrate absorption via the PepT1 and T2 oligopeptide-H+ symporters is greatly enhanced at a low extracellular pH (12Fei Y.J. Kanai Y. Nussberger S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 6456-6463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar), more recent data suggest that the resulting cytoplasmic acidification leads to the selective activation of apical Na+/H+ exchangers (primarily NHE3) in intestinal Caco-2 cells (14Thwaites D.T. Ford D. Glanville M. Simmons N.L. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In addition, while this study was in progress, a report was published suggesting that the inhibition of dipeptide uptake caused by treatment with vasoactive intestinal peptide was indirect and manifest primarily through a modification of NHE3 activity (15Anderson C.M. Mendoza M.E. Kennedy D.J. Raldua D. Thwaites D.T. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 138: 564-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These results suggest that a functional coupling occurs between oligopeptide uptake and Na+/H+ exchange at the apical cell membrane. However, it is not known whether these observations hold in vivo nor whether Na+/H+ activity is required for oligopeptide uptake in a live organism. In order to address this question, we turned to the nematode C. elegans. Exclusive localization of the NHX-2 isoform to the apical membrane of the intestine suggested that it might represent the nematode NHE3 ortholog. In addition, the nematode genome contains the coding potential for three H+-coupled oligopeptide transporters (opt-1, -2, and -3), which have been functionally expressed and shown to possess dipeptide transport activity that is enhanced by a transmembrane H+ gradient (16Fei Y.J. Romero M.F. Krause M. Liu J.C. Huang W. Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9563-9571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 17Fei Y.J. Fujita T. Lapp D.F. Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 565-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We demonstrate here that the opt-2 gene codes for the intestinal H+-oligopeptide symporter and suggest using a combination of reverse genetics and a novel in vivo pH imaging technique that the activity of OPT-2 is closely linked to the intracellular pH established specifically by NHX-2 in the nematode intestinal epithelia. Our observations are also consistent with preferential activation of the intestinal Na+/H+ exchanger on the apical membrane by nutrient-induced acidification. Most importantly, our results show that an inhibition of Na+/H+ exchange can lead to a phenotype resembling caloric restriction, perhaps through a reduced nutrient uptake capacity, and a concomitant increase in life span. Promoter Transgene Cloning and Strains—Strains used were SU93, containing an integrated ajm1::GFP translational fusion that labels cell boundaries in the embryo, e2131ts, containing a mutant temperature-sensitive pha-1 allele that prevents pharyngeal development, and the wild-type N2, Bristol strain. These strains were routinely propagated at 15 °C on nematode growth media agar plates containing 5 μg/ml cholesterol and seeded with OP50 bacteria. The vectors pRNAi-nhx-2 and opt-2 were created by PCR cloning from nucleotide 133 to 1759 and from nucleotide 649 to 1339 of the respective coding regions into the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) feeding vector pPD129.36. The feeding vectors pLT61.1, containing an unc-22 insert, and pLT63.1, containing a fem-1 insert (courtesy of A. Fire, Carnegie Institute of Washington, Baltimore, MD), were used as controls to assess the efficiency of double-stranded RNA-mediated gene interference (RNAi). Transcriptional promoter fusions to GFP were created by PCR amplification of 4 kb of genomic sequence from upstream of the first start codon for nhx-2, opt-1, and opt-2 using restriction site-tagged oligonucleotide primers that contained a mutated start codon complement (ATG to TTG) to prevent translational initiation. The PCR products were cloned into the complementary sites of the vector pFH6.II (courtesy of F. Hagen, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY), which is a derivative of pPD 95.81 (courtesy of A. Fire, Carnegie Institute of Washington, Baltimore) to create pJP109-nhx-2, pKN109, and pKN110, respectively. Translational promoter fusions were created similarly but instead used a downstream genomic primer that annealed immediately prior to the stop codon (rather than start codon), and the PCR product was cloned so that GFP would be translated in-frame with the full protein coding regions for nhx-2 (pJP113-nhx-2) or opt-2 (pKN111). To create a nematode expression vector for pHluorin, a PCR product was amplified containing the 5′-coding sequences of GFP, including the first three synthetic introns, from the vector pFH6.II (synthetic introns greatly enhance the stability of mRNA in C. elegans). A separate PCR product was then amplified from an expression vector for ratiometric pHluorin in pGEX-2T (courtesy of James Rothman, Sloan-Kettering Institute, New York). This product contained the 3′-coding sequences of pHluorin, including all of the pHluorin mutations, and also included a 30-nucleotide overlap at the 5′ end with the 3′ end of the PCR product from pFH6.II. These two PCR products were annealed, extended, and reamplified using primers to the 5′- and 3′-most sequences of the extended product. The final PCR product was used to replace GFP in a pFH6.II background. Finally, the enhanced GFP mutation (S65C) in the pFH6.II vehicle was converted back to a serine by QuikChange mutagenesis (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). This construct represented a promoterless pHluorin expression vector with four synthetic introns (one each in the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions) and contained the unc-54 3′-untranslated region. The entire coding region and four synthetic introns in the final vector pIA3 were sequenced on both strands. We found that the L220F mutation was not present in either pIA3 nor in the original pHluorin clone provided. The nhx-2 promoter was used to drive pHluorin expression in the gut, as described (11Nehrke K. Melvin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29036-29044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). A nematode 4 synthetic intron expression vector for ecliptic pHluorin (18Miesenbock G. De Angelis D.A. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1998; 394: 192-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (2009) Google Scholar) was also engineered but was not used in this work. Nematode Microinjections—GFP or pHluorin fusion constructs were mixed with pCL1, which rescues the pha-1 deficit (19Granato M. Schnabel H. Schnabel R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1762-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), at 75 μg/ml each in high potassium injection buffer, and then coinjected into the gonad of young adults, as described (20Mello C.C. Kramer J.M. Stinchcomb D. Ambros V. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3959-3970Crossref PubMed Scopus (2469) Google Scholar). After 4 days at 22 °C, surviving F1 progeny were picked from at least 10 injections to separate plates to look for germ line transmission. F2 generation nematodes were then imaged on 2% agarose pads using either a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope equipped with Nikon Apo series objectives under 100-watt mercury illumination and a GFP or 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole filter set, or a Leica DRME confocal microscope under 488-nm laser illumination and a fluorescein isothiocyanate filter set as appropriate. The images were captured using a Spot2 camera and analyzed in Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA). RNAi and Growth Analysis—Fresh transformants of each RNAi vector, including the insertless control vector pPD129.36, were grown in the bacterial strain HT115 to mid-log phase at 37 °C and then induced for 2 h with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. After 5-fold concentration, 80 μl of bacteria was added to the surface of 35-mm nematode growth media agar plates supplemented with cholesterol and 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Two days later, L4 larvae were placed onto the RNAi plates for 24 h prior to being moved to a fresh plate, where they were allowed to lay eggs for a period of 12–24 h. The maturation and phenotype of these progeny were assessed using a variety of methods. In order to measure growth rate, images of each animal were captured daily through a Nikon E800 microscope as described above. Images were stored using SPOT image software and then calibrated, measured, and transferred to Origin 6.1 (OriginLab Corp., Northampton, MA) for analysis. To determine rates of pharyngeal pumping, video was captured using a dissecting microscope fitted with a DAGE digital camera and transferred to a SONY TRV-120 digital camcorder. Playback was later slowed electronically to follow pharnygeal contractions. To assess the brood size, F1 generation nematodes were transferred to fresh RNAi plates every 24 h, and the progeny were counted and removed using a flame-drawn pipette connected to a vacuum source. Mortality of the F1 nematodes was assessed daily over a period of 5 weeks. Nile Red staining was used to assess the distribution of fat in the RNAi-treated worms. Nile Red was diluted to 0.25 μg/ml in M9 buffer, and 1 ml was spread and allowed to dry onto 35-mm seeded RNAi plates (final concentration 0.05 μg/ml). Newly hatched larva were transferred to these plates and allowed to mature. These worms were then anesthetized in M9 solution containing 0.1% tetramisole and 0.1% Tricaine and imaged on 2% agarose pads using a rhodamine filter set as described above. The overall pattern (or lack) of staining did not differ greatly between the various larval stages in the RNAi-treated samples, although the degree of fluorescence in the region of the lumen increased in nhx-2 RNAi-treated worms as they aged. To assess the distribution of cells in the F2 generation embryos, the SU93 strain was subjected to RNAi treatment, and the F2 embryos were examined under both fluorescent and Nomarski optics as described above. Intracellular pH Measurements and Dipeptide-induced Acidification—The intestinal pH of nematodes expressing pHluorin was examined using a glue-down and perfusion technique coupled with real time fluorescent microscopy. Nematodes (L4 or young adult) were glued to 2% agarose/M9 pads on 40-mm glass coverslips using NexaBand H/C, a cyanoacrylate veterinary adhesive, and were then place into an perfusion chamber (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT) and superfused with a nominally bicarbonate-free physiological saline solution (in mm: 135 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 0.4 KH2PO4, 0.33 NaH2PO4, 20 Hepes, 1.2 CaCl2, 0.8 MgSO4, pH adjusted to 7.4 with Tris base). A dual wavelength excitation system (TILL Photonics, Germany) rigged to a Nikon E2000 inverted microscope equipped with a CCD camera detection system (Cooke, Germany) was used to monitor pH changes. The fluorescent emissions were measured at 530 nm following excitation at 410 and 470 nm. To convert the derivative fluorescent ratio to pH i , the intestinal cells were exposed via gently slicing open the worm with a 32-gauge needle immediately posterior to the pharyngeal-intestinal valve, and in situ calibration was performed using the high K+/nigericin technique (21Thomas J.A. Buchsbaum R.N. Zimniak A. Racker E. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2210-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1771) Google Scholar). For experiments where pH was followed over time, pharyngeal pumping was initiated by the addition of serotonin to 2 mm final concentration, and all subsequent solutions contained serotonin. To assess oligopeptide-induced acidification, the superfusate was first switched to sodium-free solution containing NMDG/HCl in place of NaCl, and after several minutes, the dipeptide glycylsarcosine (GlySar) was added to a final concentration of 20 mm. Recovery from acidification was then monitored in the original salt solution, plus or minus the addition of 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride (EIPA). NHX-2 Protein Colocalizes with OPT-2, an Intestinal H + -Oligopeptide Transporter—GFP reporter constructs that expressed transcriptional or translational promoter fusions in transgenic nematodes were used to assess cellular expression patterns and protein distributions of candidate genes that may represent nematode orthologs of the mammalian NHE3 and PepT1 proteins. We have shown previously (11Nehrke K. Melvin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29036-29044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) that NHX-2 is expressed strongly and uniformly throughout the apical membrane of intestinal cells, making it a likely candidate for the mammalian NHE3 ortholog. Those results were confirmed in Fig. 1 (panels A, B, G, and H). In addition, C. elegans has three genes that could represent the mammalian PepT1 H+-coupled oligopeptide transporter ortholog, named opt-1, -2 and -3. Although all three genes code for functional transporters (16Fei Y.J. Romero M.F. Krause M. Liu J.C. Huang W. Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9563-9571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 17Fei Y.J. Fujita T. Lapp D.F. Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 565-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), opt-3 is expressed in a pan-neural pattern (16Fei Y.J. Romero M.F. Krause M. Liu J.C. Huang W. Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9563-9571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), making it an unlikely candidate to interact with NHX-2. Similarly, the opt-1 promoter drove GFP expression in a variety of cells, including vulval, pharyngeal, and anal muscles but not in the intestine (Fig. 1, panels C and D). However, the opt-2 gene promoter drove GFP expression specifically in the intestine (Fig. 1, panels C and D), and the OPT-2::GFP fusion protein was distributed along the apical membrane of the intestinal cells, coincident with the NHX-2::GFP fusion (panels I–L). RNAi of nhx-2 and opt-2 Results in Both Overlapping and Distinct Phenotypes—The role of the nhx-2 and opt-2 gene products in nematode development was studied using double-stranded RNA-mediated gene inactivation, which phenocopies a loss-of-function null allele. dsRNA was introduced via bacterial feeding (22Kamath R.S. Fraser A.G. Dong Y. Poulin G. Durbin R. Gotta M. Kanapin A. Le Bot N. Moreno S. Sohrmann M. Welchman D.P. Zipperlen P. Ahringer J. Nature. 2003; 421: 231-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (2762) Google Scholar, 23Fire A. Xu S. Montgomery M.K. Kostas S.A. Driver S.E. Mello C.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 806-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (12000) Google Scholar), which is particularly potent in intestinal cells. Fig. 2 shows 2-day-old worms grown on Escherichia coli expressing dsRNA from insertless control, opt-2, or nhx-2 vectors (panels A–C, respectively). It is immediately apparent that both opt-2 and nhx-2 are required for optimal growth, as the RNAi-treated worms are shorter, thinner, and more transparent relative to the representative control worm. This decreased opacity is quite likely related to the accumulation of fat storage granules in the intestine. A recent report (24Ashrafi K. Chang F.Y. Watts J.L. Fraser A.G. Kamath R.S. Ahringer J. Ruvkun G. Nature. 2003; 421: 268-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar) on fat regulatory genes in C. elegans in fact demonstrated that RNAi inactivation of opt-2 caused a reduction in fat content, as assessed by Nile Red staining. We found this to be true in our work as well (Fig. 3, panels A–D) but not to the same extent as nhx-2 gene inactivation, which resulted in a nearly complete loss of fat storage granules in the intestine (Fig. 3, panels E–H). This is consistent with the smaller size of the worms following nhx-2 gene inactivation (Fig. 2). Confocal microscopy using a longer exposure time revealed that much of the residual Nile Red staining following nhx-2 gene inactivation occurred in the lumen of the intestine (panels G and H). This may represent a deficit in transport of receptor-bound substrates for Nile Red staining or perhaps a weak signal that is normally veiled by the intense staining of the gut granules.Fig. 3Changes in fat content in RNAi-treated nematodes. Nile Red was added to NGM plates containing bacteria expressing control dsRNA (panels A and B) and dsRNA targeted toward opt-2 (panels C and D) or toward nhx-2 (panels E–H). L4 nematodes were seeded onto untreated RNAi plates for 24 h prior to being moved to plates containing Nile Red. The F1 progeny were allowed to grow for 48–96 h following hatching on Nile Red plates. These progeny were examined by fluorescence microscopy under a rhodamine filter set (panels A, C, E, and G) and under a DIC filter set using transmitted light (panels B, D, F, and H). Control nematodes stained brightly in presumed lipid storage granules in the intestine (panel A), as reported previously (24Ashrafi K. Chang F.Y. Watts J.L. Fraser A.G. Kamath R.S. Ahringer J. Ruvkun G. Nature. 2003; 421: 268-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). Under identical exposure conditions, opt-2 gene inactivation resulted in a dramatic decrease in fluorescent intensity (panel C), whereas nhx-2 gene inactivation resulted in a nearly complete loss of fluorescence in the gut granules (panel E), reflecting a lower level of fat accumulation in the intestine. By using confocal microscopy and a longer exposure, the majority of Nile Red staining was observed at the luminal surface of the intestine following nhx-2 gene inactivation (panel G).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A more complete analysis of several physiological indicators of the metabolic state following gene inactivation is shown in Fig. 4. Quantitative growth curves for the RNAi-treated worms indicate that both the rate of growth and the final size is impaired by abolition of either gene product or by both in combination (Fig. 4, panel A), a fact that suggests they function in the same physiological pathway. In addition, progression through the four larval stages, particularly the L1/L2 stages, is also slowed by RNAi treatment (data not shown). The rate of pharyngeal pumping was slower in nhx-2 RNAi-treated worms than in control worms (p < 0.01). However, there was no apparent difference between the opt-2 RNAi-treated and control worms (Fig. 4, panel B). Likewise, the brood size was severely reduced from ∼200 to 300 progeny in the control to less than 5 progeny in the nhx-2-treated worms but was only reduced by 2-fold in the opt-2-treated worms (Fig. 4, panel C). Finally, the life span of the worms was assessed, and the percent survival was plotted on a daily basis over the course of 5 weeks (Fig. 4, panel D). On average, nhx-2 RNAi treatment caused an increase of 30–40% in post-reproductive life span, consistent with previous models of nutrient deprivation (25Houthoofd K. Braeckman B.P. Lenaerts I. Brys K. De Vreese A. Van Eygen S. Vanfleteren J.R. Exp. Gerontol. 2002; 37: 1371-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 26Larsen P.L. Clarke C.F. Science. 2002; 295: 120-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 27Lakowski B. Hekimi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13091-13096Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). In fact, caloric restriction has been shown in worms to lead to many of the same phenotypes observed in our nhx-2 gene inactivation model, i.e. an increase in the average life span, decreased brood size, and reduced accumulations of lipid storage granules in the intestine (28Klass M.R. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1977; 6: 413-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Mutations in a variety of genes involved predominantly in pharyngeal function and, correspondingly, food uptake mirrors these phenotypes (29Avery L. Genetics. 1993; 133: 897-917Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Caloric restriction can also lead to an increased life span in mammals, suggesting that many of the physiological changes that occur from restricted dietary intake are conserved along the evolutionary scale (30Sohal R.S. Weindruch R. Science. 1996; 273: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2646) Google Scholar, 31Tatar M. Bartke A. Antebi A. Science. 2003; 299: 1346-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). The mean life span of the opt-2 RNAi-treated worms also increased by several days, but this small effect may reflect the observed delay in larval maturation and not an increase in post-reproductive life span at all. Finally, the slight reduction in life span of the double RNAi-treated animals compared with the nhx-2-treated animals may represent a dosage effect of mixing dsRNAs that appears over time; note that the initial rates of die-off appear similar, and differences begin to arise after about 50% of the worms have perished. These data suggest that whereas NHX-2 may facilitate dipeptide uptake by OPT-2, as the combined effects of inactivating both genes was no more detrimental than NHX-2 alone, they also suggest that NHX-2 is involved in other aspects of intestinal function that result in severe physiological consequences. To examine more closely the reason behind the reduced brood size in the RNAi-treated worms, embryogenesis was examined in the F2 generation using the SU93 strain, which expresses an adherin::GFP fusion protein that labels cell boundaries. The control and opt-2-treated F2 embryos appeared to develop normally (Fig. 5, panels A–D), whereas the few nhx-2-treated embryos that were laid were morphologically abnormal (panels E and F). It is unlikely, however, that nhx-2 plays a direct role in embryonic development, as the F1 embryos appeared normal and the F1 brood was of a comparable size with control worms (data not shown). In addition, we have not observed nhx-2::GFP reporter expression prior to the L1 larval stage (11Nehrke K. Melvin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29036-29044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Instead, we hypothesize that the embryos are not getting enough nutrients to develop normally in the absence of maternal NHX-2 activity. From these results, we conclude that whereas the nhx-2 gene product may in fact be functionally coupled to the activity of OPT-2 in the intestine, there is potentially an additional unexplored role for intestinal Na+/H+ exchange in other nutrient uptake processes, particularly those involved in regulating fat accumulation and storage, and loss of this function results in worms that display a phenotype mirroring starvation.

https://openalex.org/W2039249192,"FtsK and topoisomerase (Topo) IV are both involved in chromosome segregation in Escherichia coli. The former protein resides at the septal ring and is required for resolution of chromosome dimers. The latter protein is the chromosomal decatenase. We have demonstrated recently that Topo IV activity is concentrated at the septal proximal regions of the nucleoids late in the cell cycle. Here we demonstrate that FtsK and Topo IV physically and functionally interact. Topo IV was recovered in immunoprecipitates of FtsK. Two-hybrid analysis and immunoblotting showed that this interaction was mediated by the ParC subunit of Topo IV. In addition, we show that the C-terminal motor domain of FtsK stimulates the decatenation activity of Topo IV but not that of DNA gyrase, the other type II topoisomerase in the cell. Topo IV and FtsK appear to cooperate in the cell as well. Rescue of a parE temperature-sensitive mutation by overproduction of DnaX, which leads to stabilization of the temperature-sensitive Topo IV, required both the C-terminal domain of FtsK and dif, whereas rescue by overproduction of Topo III, which bypasses Topo IV function, did not. The interaction between FtsK and Topo IV may provide a means for concentrating the latter enzyme at the cell center. FtsK and topoisomerase (Topo) IV are both involved in chromosome segregation in Escherichia coli. The former protein resides at the septal ring and is required for resolution of chromosome dimers. The latter protein is the chromosomal decatenase. We have demonstrated recently that Topo IV activity is concentrated at the septal proximal regions of the nucleoids late in the cell cycle. Here we demonstrate that FtsK and Topo IV physically and functionally interact. Topo IV was recovered in immunoprecipitates of FtsK. Two-hybrid analysis and immunoblotting showed that this interaction was mediated by the ParC subunit of Topo IV. In addition, we show that the C-terminal motor domain of FtsK stimulates the decatenation activity of Topo IV but not that of DNA gyrase, the other type II topoisomerase in the cell. Topo IV and FtsK appear to cooperate in the cell as well. Rescue of a parE temperature-sensitive mutation by overproduction of DnaX, which leads to stabilization of the temperature-sensitive Topo IV, required both the C-terminal domain of FtsK and dif, whereas rescue by overproduction of Topo III, which bypasses Topo IV function, did not. The interaction between FtsK and Topo IV may provide a means for concentrating the latter enzyme at the cell center. In bacteria, the division plane at mid-cell is the crucial locus where most of the events leading to cytokinesis take place. The DNA polymerases assemble (1Lemon K.P. Grossman A.D. Science. 1998; 282: 1516-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 2Espeli O. Levine C. Hassing H. Marians K.J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 189-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and replicate DNA at mid-cell (3Koppes L.J. Woldringh C.L. Nanninga N. Biochimie (Paris). 1999; 81: 803-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 4Lemon K.P. Grossman A.D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1321-1330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). This replication factory remains stationary, suggesting that the DNA is drawn through the factory during replication. These observations have led to the development of the “extrusion-capture” model of chromosome partitioning (5Lemon K.P. Grossman A.D. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2031-2041Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), whereby replication itself drives DNA segregation by pushing the newly replicated DNA outward from the anchored factory toward opposite cell poles. Transcription may also participate in chromosome dynamics, with relatively stationary RNA polymerases playing the role of motor proteins that also act to drive the sister chromosomes away from the cell center (6Dworkin J. Losick R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14089-14094Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), because transcription units tend to be oriented away from oriC. Chromosome segregation and cytokinesis are functionally linked. Delays in chromosome segregation that lead to prolonged residence of the nucleoid in the cell center will prevent cell division (7Hendricks E.C. Szerlong H. Hill T. Kuempel P. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 973-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The major structure for cytokinesis is the septal ring. Formation starts early after the initiation of replication with the assembly of the FtsZ ring at mid-cell. FtsZ is a tubulin-like protein (8Lowe J. Amos L.A. Nature. 1998; 391: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar), and contraction of the ring results in cell division. The septal ring is also linked to chromosome segregation via FtsK. FtsK is a bifunctional protein composed of three domains (9Liu G. Draper G.C. Donachie W.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain consists of four transmembrane segments. This domain is required for cell viability and is presumed to be involved in closure of the septal ring (10Draper G.C. McLennan N. Begg K. Masters M. Donachie W.D. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4621-4627Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal part of FtsK is cytoplasmic and is required for XerCD-catalyzed resolution of chromosomal dimers at dif (11Steiner W. Liu G. Donachie W.D. Kuempel P. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 579-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This portion of FtsK is composed of two domains: a proline- and glutamine-rich domain of unknown function and a 500-amino acid C-terminal domain (domain 3) that is necessary for normal chromosome segregation (9Liu G. Draper G.C. Donachie W.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), in part because of its effect on XerCD recombination at dif (12Recchia G.D. Aroyo M. Wolf D. Blakely G. Sherratt D.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5724-5734Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Domain 3 is homologous to the C-terminal domain of SpoIIIE, a protein involved in DNA transfer from the mother cell to the prespore in Bacillus subtilis (13Wu L.J. Lewis P.J. Allmansberger R. Hauser P.M. Errington J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1316-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The purified FtsK50C fragment of the protein, which includes FtsK amino acids 179–230 linked to the N terminus of domain 3, is a hexameric AAA DNA-dependent ATPase that can alter the topology of DNA and affect the direction of XerCD-catalyzed resolution in vitro (14Aussel L. Barre F.X. Aroyo M. Stasiak A. Stasiak A.Z. Sherratt D. Cell. 2002; 108: 195-205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Topoisomerase (Topo) IV 1The abbreviations used are: Topo IV, topoisomerase IV; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DTT, dithiothreitol; BSA, bovine serum albumin. was discovered by Kato et al. (15Kato J. Nishimura Y. Imamura R. Niki H. Hiraga S. Suzuki H. Cell. 1990; 63: 393-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar) as a new topoisomerase activity that appeared when the products of parE and parC were co-overexpressed in Escherichia coli. Mutations in these genes produce partition-defective, conditionally lethal phenotypes (15Kato J. Nishimura Y. Imamura R. Niki H. Hiraga S. Suzuki H. Cell. 1990; 63: 393-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 16Kato J. Nishimura Y. Yamada M. Suzuki H. Hirota Y. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3967-3977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The purified enzyme consists of a heterotetramer of a dimer of ParE, which contains the ATPase domain, and a dimer of ParC, which contains the DNA binding and DNA cleavage and religation domains (17Peng H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24481-24490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Topo IV can decatenate replicating daughter chromosomes in vitro (18Peng H. Marians K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8571-8575Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and in vivo (19Adams D.E. Shekhtman E.M. Zechiedrich E.L. Schmid M.B. Cozzarelli N.R. Cell. 1992; 71: 277-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), demonstrating that it, and not DNA gyrase, the other type II topoisomerase present in bacteria, was responsible for topological unlinking of the daughter chromosomes during segregation and partition. We have shown that Topo IV activity is temporally regulated in the cell (2Espeli O. Levine C. Hassing H. Marians K.J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 189-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This regulation manifests itself because the two subunits of the enzyme reside in different locations in the cell for a significant fraction of the cell cycle. ParC is associated with the replication factory, whereas ParE appears to be distributed in the DNA-free spaces in the cell. As a result, Topo IV activity becomes concentrated in the cell center toward the end of the cell cycle after the replication factory disassembles. Interestingly, a strong Topo IV cleavage site has been found very close to dif, whereas they are scarce for 35–54 kbp on either side of it (20Hojgaard A. Szerlong H. Tabor C. Kuempel P. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 1027-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These observations prompted us to ask whether Topo IV and FtsK were associated in the cell. We show here that this is indeed the case, that this association is mediated by the ParC subunit of Topo IV, and that the C-terminal domain 3 of FtsK stimulates the chromosome decatenation activity of Topo IV in vitro and is required for the Topo IV-mediated chromosome decatenation pathway in vivo when Topo IV function is compromised. FtsKC Immunoprecipitation—W3110(pFX90) (a gift of D. Sherratt, Oxford University) was grown in LB medium at 37 °C until reaching an A 600 of 0.2. Either arabinose (0.2%) or glucose (0.2%) was then added to either induce or repress, respectively, expression of FtsKC, and the cultures (40 ml) were incubated at 37 °C until they reached an A 600 of 0.5. Protein-protein cross-links were induced by addition of formaldehyde to 2% followed by incubation for 20 min at 37 °C. Cross-linking was then blocked by the addition of glycine to 300 mm followed by incubation for 5 min at 37 °C. The cells were harvested, and FtsKC was isolated as described below except that lysis was in 5 ml. The lysis buffer included 20 μg/ml DNase I. 200 μl of FLAG antibody beads were used per culture, and elution of FtsKC was in batches with 1 ml of FLAG peptide (100 μg/ml) for 1 h. Western blot analysis was performed as described by Levine and Marians (21Levine C. Marians K.J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1232-1240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) except that the samples (25 μl of eluted material) were heated at 100 °C for 10 min to reverse the crosslinks. Antisera used were rabbit polyclonal antibodies to Topo IV, FtsZ, and GyrA and mouse monoclonal antibodies to GyrB and the FLAG epitope. Immunoblotting—200 μl of 1× PBS and then 200 μl of the indicated proteins in 1× PBS was spotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond ECL) by using a Schleicher & Schuell Minifold II dot blotting apparatus, and the membrane was then air-dried for 10 min. The membrane was then blocked by incubation in 1× PBS, 5% non-fat dried milk for 1 h at room temperature. FtsKC (2 μg/ml) was then incubated with the membrane for 15 min in a solution containing 40 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 8.0), 12 mm MgOAc, 5 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, and 4% sucrose. Glutaraldehyde was then added to a final concentration of 0.1%, and the incubation was continued for 45 min. The membrane was then washed with 1× TPS (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)), 2% milk, and 200 mm glycine and then washed four times (10 min each wash) with 1× PBS, 2% milk. Monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (1:2000 dilution) in 1× PBS was then incubated with the blot overnight at 4 °C. The blot was washed three times quickly, once for 15 min, and three times for 5 min each with ≥50 ml of 1× PBS, 2% milk, and then incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase at a 1:5000 dilution in 1× PBS, 2% milk, for 1 h at room temperature. The blot was washed again, as after application of the primary antibody, and FtsKC was detected using ECL-Western blotting detection reagents as described by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). Two-hybrid Analysis—DNA-binding fusions were made to the first 202 amino acids of LexA in the pCA-1 plasmid (a gift of S. Keeney, Sloan-Kettering Institute). In this plasmid, expression of a nuclear localization signal-modified N-terminal LexA fragment is driven by an actin promoter. The expression cassette is followed by the Gal11 transcription terminator. The FtsKC open reading frame was amplified by PCR using primers containing SalI and BglII restriction endonuclease sites, and the DNA fragment was digested and cloned into the SalI and BglII sites of the plasmid to give the lexA-ftsKC fusion gene. Transcriptional activator fusions were made to the activator domain of Gal4 (amino acids 768–881) in the pACT2 plasmid (Clontech). In this plasmid, expression of a nuclear localization signal-modified Gal4 activation domain is driven by an alcohol dehydrogenase promoter followed by the alcohol dehydrogenase transcriptional terminator. The ParE and ParC open reading frames were amplified by PCR using primers containing NcoI and BglII restriction endonuclease sites and cloned into the NcoI and BglII sites of the plasmid to give the gal4-parE and gal4-parC fusion genes. To assay for interaction, Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain L40 (Invitrogen) carrying the two plasmids of interest was grown at 30 °C in minimal media lacking Leu and Trp but containing the other 18 amino acids to an A 600 of 0.5–1.0. β-Galactosidase was then assayed as described by Bartel and Fields (22Bartel P.L. Fields S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 241-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) using 0.5 ml of cell culture and chlorophenyl red β-d-galactopyranoside (Calbiochem) as the substrate with incubation times ranging from 10 min to 1 h at 37 °C. Purification of FtsKC—Purification was as described by Aussel et al. (14Aussel L. Barre F.X. Aroyo M. Stasiak A. Stasiak A.Z. Sherratt D. Cell. 2002; 108: 195-205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). W3110(pFX90) was grown in rich media in the presence of 0.2% arabinose to A 600 = 1.0. Cells were harvested (from 2.4 liters of culture), washed in 120 ml of washing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5 at 4 °C), 250 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol), resuspended in 120 ml of washing buffer containing 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 20 μg/ml RNase A, and lysed by sonication. The soluble lysate was recovered after centrifugation at 50,000 × g for 30 min. FLAG antibody-agarose (1.4 ml) (Sigma) equilibrated in washing buffer was added, and the suspension was incubated with gentle agitation for 15 h at 4 °C. The resin was washed five times in batches with 7 ml of washing buffer for 30 min each time. The resin was then poured into a 3-ml syringe to form a column and the FtsKC eluted with washing buffer containing 100 μg/ml FLAG peptide (Sigma). Fractions (100 μl) were collected, and those containing FtsKC were pooled. EDTA was added to 1 mm to the final pool (1.25 ml, 0.65 mg/ml). FtsKC ATPase Assay—Reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH. 7.8 at 37 °C), 2.5 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl, 5 mm [γ-32P]ATP (9000 cpm/nmol), 250 μg/ml BSA, and the indicated concentrations of FtsKC and a 6-kb supercoiled plasmid DNA were incubated for 3 min at 37 °C. ATP hydrolysis was then determined by the method of Conway and Lipmann (23Conway T. Lipmann F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1964; 52: 1462-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Decatenation of Multiply Linked Dimers—Multiply linked, form II: form II DNA dimers were prepared as described by Marians (24Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10362-10368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Decatenation reaction mixtures (10 μl) containing 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 8.0 at 37 °C), 10 mm DTT, 10 mm MgOAc, 5 mm ATP, 100 μg/ml BSA, 0.8 nm form II:form II DNA dimers, either 0.2 nm Topo IV or 25 nm DNA gyrase, and either 1.2 μm FtsKC or the equivalent volume of FtsKC elution buffer were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. Reactions were terminated by the addition of EDTA to 20 mm, and the DNA was analyzed by electrophoresis through a vertical 1% agarose gel at 20 V/cm for 17 h at room temperature using 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8 at 23 °C), 40 mm NaOAc, and 1 mm EDTA as the electrophoresis buffer. The gel was dried, exposed to a PhosphorImager screen for quantitation, and autoradiographed. Rescue of the parE10 Allele—W3110parE10 (15Kato J. Nishimura Y. Imamura R. Niki H. Hiraga S. Suzuki H. Cell. 1990; 63: 393-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar) was used as the recipient to construct W3110parE10ftsK::cam and W3110-parE10dif::kan by P1 transduction from DS9091 (12Recchia G.D. Aroyo M. Wolf D. Blakely G. Sherratt D.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5724-5734Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and NL250 (25Leslie N.R. Sherratt D.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1561-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), respectively. Plasmids pBAD-topB (26Nurse P. Levine C. Hassing H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8653-8660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and pLex-dnaX(γ) (2Espeli O. Levine C. Hassing H. Marians K.J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 189-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) have been described. Their parent plasmids are pBAD18 and pLex5BA (27Diederich L. Roth A. Messer W. BioTechniques. 1994; 16: 916-923PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. These four plasmids were transformed into all three W3110parE10 derivatives. Cultures of these strains were grown overnight at 30 °C, diluted 1:500 into fresh media, grown at 30 °C to mid-log phase, and plated for viable cells at both 30 and 42 °C. Growth was in LB medium with ampicillin (50 μg/ml), arabinose (0.5%), and IPTG (250 μm) added as required. A Physical Association between FtsK and Topo IV—To examine the interaction of Topo IV and FtsK in vivo, W3110(pFX90) was grown in LB medium to an A 600 of 0.2. pFX90 is a pBAD plasmid that expresses FtsK domain 3 (FtsKC) tagged with the FLAG epitope at the N terminus (28Barre F.X. Aroyo M. Colloms S.D. Helfrich A. Cornet F. Sherratt D.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2976-2988Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Either glucose or arabinose was then added to either repress or induce expression of the FLAG-tagged FtsKC, respectively, and growth was continued until the cultures reached an OD of 0.5. Formaldehyde was added to induce protein-protein cross-links, and cross-linking was then blocked by the subsequent addition of glycine. Soluble lysates were prepared, and the FLAG-tagged FtsKC was isolated via the use of antibodies against the FLAG epitope linked to agarose beads. To ensure specificity, proteins were eluted from the beads by competition with FLAG peptide and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (Fig. 1). As expected, FLAG-FtsKC was only present in the lysate when arabinose was added to the culture. Essentially all of the FLAG-FtsKC in the lysate was captured by the antibody. Both subunits of Topo IV, ParE and ParC, were detected in the peptide eluate from the immunoprecipitate when the cultures had been exposed to arabinose and FtsKC was produced, whereas no Topo IV was evident when the cultures had been exposed to glucose. The third band detected with the Topo IV antibodies is a specific degradation product of ParE that we observe consistently in cell extracts. These observations indicated that the presence of Topo IV in the immunoprecipitate was dependent on the presence of FtsKC. Note that because DNase I was included during preparation of the extracts, the presence of Topo IV in the FtsKC immunoprecipitate was not the result of co-residence of the two enzymes on the same DNA fragment. The specificity of the interaction between Topo IV and FtsKC was reinforced by the finding that neither of the subunits of DNA gyrase could be found in the peptide eluate of the immunoprecipitate under any condition. We have described a temporal regulation of Topo IV activity whereby ParC associates with the replication factory during most of the cell cycle, associating with ParE when the factory disassembles (2Espeli O. Levine C. Hassing H. Marians K.J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 189-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). These events cause Topo IV activity to be concentrated at the end of the cell cycle in the central region of the cell, either at or in the vicinity of the invaginating septum. FtsKC lacks the N-terminal membrane domain that localizes the intact FtsK to the septal ring. We have found, not surprisingly for a domain that self-associates, that FtsKC localizes to the septal ring via interaction with the C-terminal domain of the intact protein (data not shown). This observation likely accounts for our ability to co-immunoprecipitate FtsKC with both subunits of Topo IV. Because of the residence of FtsK at the septal ring, it was also reasonable to expect that FtsZ would be found in the immunoprecipitate. This proved to be the case. Like Topo IV, FtsZ could be found in the peptide eluate from immunoprecipitates from cultures treated with arabinose. The findings described by the experiment shown in Fig. 1 indicated that Topo IV interacted with FtsK in the cell. However, this experiment could not differentiate between a direct or indirect interaction between the two proteins. To address this issue, we performed two-hybrid analysis in yeast (Table I). FtsKC was fused to the DNA-binding domain of LexA in plasmid pCA-1, whereas ParE and ParC were fused to the transcriptional activator domain of Gal4 in plasmid pACT2. The indicated pairs of plasmids were transformed into S. cerevisiae strain L40; cultures were grown in minimal media to an A 600 of 0.5, and β-galactosidase activity was determined. LexA-FtsKC gave a low amount of activity with either Gal4 or Gal4-ParE; however, the combination of LexA-FtsKC with Gal4-ParC gave a substantial level of activity. The combinations of either Gal4-ParC or Gal4-ParE with LexA gave only low background levels of activity. These data suggest that the interaction between Topo IV and FtsKC detected by immunoprecipitation was direct and mediated by an interaction between ParC and FtsKC. To confirm that the ParC-FtsKC interaction was direct, we performed immunoblotting (Fig. 2).Table ITwo-hybrid analysis of the interaction of FtsK and Topo IVDNA binding fusion (LexA-X)Activation fusion (Gal4-Y)β-Galactosidase activityMiller unitsNoneNone0.75FtsKCNone3.9FtsKCParE1.5FtsKCParC50.5NoneParE0.9NoneParC2.9 Open table in a new tab Both the individual subunits and the heterotetramers of Topo IV and DNA gyrase were spotted onto nitrocellulose paper along with single-stranded DNA-binding protein and RecA as negative interaction controls and purified FLAG-FtsKC (see next section) as a positive control. The blot was probed with a solution of FLAG-FtsKC; interactions were stabilized by glutaraldehyde cross-linking, and the FLAG-FtsKC retained on the blot was visualized by ECL-Western analysis using a monoclonal antibody to the FLAG epitope. Only the Topo IV heterotetramer and ParC interacted with FtsKC to a significant extent (Fig. 2). Thus, based on the immunoprecipitation, two-hybrid, and immunoblotting data, we conclude that ParC and the C-terminal domain of FtsK interact directly. A Functional Interaction between FtsK and Topo IV—In order to investigate the consequences of the interaction between Topo IV and FtsK, we purified FtsKC and assessed its effect on Topo IV activity in vitro. FLAG-tagged FtsKC was purified from W3110(pFX90) cells grown to late log phase in the presence of arabinose as described by Aussel et al. (14Aussel L. Barre F.X. Aroyo M. Stasiak A. Stasiak A.Z. Sherratt D. Cell. 2002; 108: 195-205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Purified FtsKC (Fig. 3A) exhibited a powerful ATPase activity that was absolutely dependent on the presence of DNA (Fig. 3B). Aussel et al. (14Aussel L. Barre F.X. Aroyo M. Stasiak A. Stasiak A.Z. Sherratt D. Cell. 2002; 108: 195-205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) reported that this fragment of FtsK was a very poor ATPase that, unlike the FtsK50C fragment, was not DNA-dependent. They attributed the difference in activities to the probable requirement of the region from amino acid residues 179–230 for oligomerization. However, they noted that FtsKC could activate Xer recombination in vivo, indicating that the fragment was active and that other factors in the cell, most likely increased concentration, could lead to its oligomerization. The ATPase activity of FtsKC displays a strong sigmoidal response to protein concentration (Fig. 3C); thus we suspect that oligomerization, which is presumably required for activity, was aided by both the presence of DNA and the high FtsKC concentration that we were able to achieve in the reaction mixtures. We also note that FtsKC ATPase activity is strongly inhibited if Mg2+ is in excess of ATP (activity at a Mg:ATP ratio of 2:1 is one-tenth that at a ratio of 1:1), as it was in the report of Aussel et al. (14Aussel L. Barre F.X. Aroyo M. Stasiak A. Stasiak A.Z. Sherratt D. Cell. 2002; 108: 195-205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). We decided to examine the activity of FtsKC, rather than FtsK50C, because the latter protein undergoes aggregation (14Aussel L. Barre F.X. Aroyo M. Stasiak A. Stasiak A.Z. Sherratt D. Cell. 2002; 108: 195-205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), whereas we found the former protein to be very well behaved. The principal role of Topo IV in the cell is to effect daughter chromosome decatenation. This reaction can be modeled in vitro with the use of multiply linked DNA dimers as a substrate (24Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10362-10368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This DNA form arises in and can be purified from DNA replication reactions in vitro that utilize small plasmid DNAs as templates. They consist of the daughter DNA molecules linked together as toroidal catenanes and as such are precisely the same substrate that is seen by Topo IV in the cell. The number of linkages between the daughter chromosomes is described by Lki, the intermolecular topological linking number. Typically, these molecules are purified from DNA replication reactions where DNA ligase has been omitted, and thus the product DNA is form II. Therefore, when analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, the form II:form II DNA dimers appear as a ladder of bands with a certain distribution, with each step in the ladder representing one intermolecular linkage between the two daughter DNAs (Fig. 4, 1st lane). When treated with either Topo IV (Fig. 4, 2nd and 3rd lanes) or DNA gyrase (Fig. 4, 4th and 5th lanes), decatenation can be observed as a shift in the distribution of linkages to a lower average value of Lki. If the reactions shown in Fig. 4 had been allowed to proceed to completion, the final product would have been the monomer form II DNA. The reactions are quantitated by determining by PhosphorImaging the amount of total linkages present (in femtomoles) at 0 time and after the 5-min incubation and then deriving a rate of decatenation, which is measured in linkages decatenated (fmol)/min. Note that the total amount of linkages is given by the sum of the products of the fraction of any particular topoisomer in the preparation, and its Lki multiplied by one-half the total amount of monomer DNA circles present. Thus, for example, although there is more DNA present in each of the topoisomers in the 3rd lane of Fig. 4 than in the 1st lane, because the topoisomers present in the 1st lane have considerably greater values of Lki than those in the 3rd lane, the total number of linkages present in the 1st lane is much greater than in the 3rd lane. Note also that unlike the common decatenation assay that measures unlinking of the mini- and maxi-circles of kinetoplast DNA (29Krasnow M.A. Cozzarelli N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2687-2693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), because one strand passage event leads to the reduction of the Lki of the multiply linked DNA dimers by a value of 1, the assay used here measures the actual rate of strand passage events. Because DNA circles in the kinetoplast DNA are linked only once, that assay measures only the rate of product accumulation. Befitting their different roles in the cell, Topo IV is the superior decatenating enzyme to DNA gyrase (30Hiasa H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21529-21535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 31Ullsperger C. Cozzarelli N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31549-31555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Thus, only 0.2 nm Topo IV was required to establish a decatenation rate of 0.85 (Fig. 4, 2nd lane), whereas 25 nm DNA gyrase gave a rate about twice that (1.83) (Fig. 4, 4th lane). The presence of 1.2 μm FtsKC stimulated Topo IV-catalyzed decatenation 2.5-fold (Fig. 4, compare 2nd and 3rd lanes), whereas it inhibited DNA gyrase-catalyzed decatenation by 25% (Fig. 4, compare 4th and 5th lanes). Although the range of FtsKC concentration that elicited a stimulation of Topo IV activity was high (0.6–1.2 μm as monomer) relative to the concentration of either the substrate or the topoisomerase used, it mirrored the response of the ATPase activity to the FtsKC concentration. Therefore, it is likely that the high concen"
https://openalex.org/W2035708557,"The steroid hormone aldosterone plays an important role during pathological tissue modifications, similar to cardiovascular or renal fibrosis. The underlying mechanisms for the pathological actions are not understood. Interaction of aldosterone with the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor is an attractive hypothesis to explain pathological tissue remodeling elicited by aldosterone, because (i) mineralocorticoids can sensitize cells for EGF, (ii) mineralocorticoid receptor (MR)-antagonists reduce EGFR-mRNA expression, (iii) EGFR itself supports the development of cardiovascular or renal fibrosis, and (iv) signaling elements involved in the pathological action of aldosterone (similar to ERK1/2 or NFkB) are typical downstream modules during EGF signaling. In addition, an interaction of aldosterone and EGF with respect to ERK1/2 activation has been described. Here we show that aldosterone stimulates EGFR expression in renal tissue of adrenalectomized rats and in human renal primary cell cultures. Furthermore, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells normally devoid of EGFR or MR express EGFR after transfection with human MR (CHO-MR cells) but not after transfection with human glucocorticoid receptor (CHO-GR cells). In CHO-MR cells, EGFR-expression is up-regulated by aldosterone and inhibited by spironolactone. CHO-MR cells but not CHO-GR cells respond with ERK1/2 phosphorylation to EGF exposure. The responsiveness to other peptide hormones was virtually not affected. These data suggest that EGFR is an aldosterone-induced protein and is involved in the manifold (patho)biological actions of aldosterone.

Nowadays, it is evident that the importance, especially the pathophysiological importance, of aldosterone and the mineralocorticoid receptor extends beyond the regulation of salt and water homeostasis. Most importantly, it has been demonstrated that aldosterone promotes cardiovascular and renal fibrosis because of tissue remodeling as well as endothelial dysfunction independent of its effects on blood pressure or salt homeostasis (1Funder J.

Several mechanisms have been proposed for the pathological actions of aldosterone, including enhanced collagen and fibronectin synthesis, stimulation of reactive oxygen species formation, decreased nitric oxide availability, and enhanced expression of peptide hormones (e.g. endothelin-1) or their receptors (e.g. AT1-receptor) (2Epstein M.

Cell Cardiol. 2000; 32: 865-879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The pathophysiological role of aldosterone has received impressive support from clinical studies, especially the Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study and the Eplerenone Post-acute Myocardial Infaction Heart Failure Efficacy and Survival Study. Low doses of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists led to a dramatic improvement of mortality in patients with severe congestive heart failure or after myocardial infarction (7Pitt B. Zannad F.

Thus, it is clear that aldosterone exerts important non-classical, non-epithelial actions. Unfortunately, the underlying mechanisms of this important action of aldosterone and the mineralocorticoid receptor are only poorly understood.Classically, aldosterone binds to the cytosolic mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) 1The abbreviations used are: MR, mineralocorticoid receptor; ADX, adrenalectomized; Aldo, aldosterone; EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGFR, EGF receptor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; GR, glucocorticoid receptor; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney cells; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Luc, luciferase; ANOVA, analysis of variance; hMR, human MR; hGR, human GR; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase.1The abbreviations used are: MR, mineralocorticoid receptor; ADX, adrenalectomized; Aldo, aldosterone; EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGFR, EGF receptor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; GR, glucocorticoid receptor; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney cells; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Luc, luciferase; ANOVA, analysis of variance; hMR, human MR; hGR, human GR; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase.

It has been proposed that the transcription factors NFkB and AP1 as well as the mitogen-activated kinases ERK1/2 are involved in the pathological actions of aldosterone (15Fiebeler A. Schmidt F.

However, these signaling pathways are usually associated with growth factors or cytokine receptors rather than with aldosterone signaling. In this respect, it is of interest that steroids, including aldosterone, have the ability to interact with peptide hormone signaling (17Krug A.W. Schuster C. Gassner B. Freudinger R. Mildenberger S. Troppmair J. Gekle M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45892-45897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). One important peptide signaling “system” with respect to aldosterone is the epidermal growth factor (EGF) and its receptor (EGFR) (17Krug A.W. Schuster C. Gassner B. Freudinger R. Mildenberger S.

Pharmacological in vivo studies have shown that mineralocorticoids enhance EGF-induced contraction of arteries (19Florian J.A. Dorrance A. Webb R.C. Watts S.W. Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2001; 281: R878-R886Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that the MR-antagonist spironolactone reduces the expression of EGFR-mRNA after cerebral ischemia (20Dorrance A.M. Osborn H.L. Grekin R. Webb R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: R944-R950PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, EGFR expression supports fibrosis in cardiovascular and renal tissue (21Terzi F. Burtin M. Hekmati M.

Hypertension. 2003; 41: 824-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The importance of the EGFR in mediating pathophysiological effects of heterologous signaling systems is supported by its role in endothelin-induced fibrogenic effects (22Flamant M. Tharaux P.L. Placier S. Henrion D. Coffman T. Chatziantoniou C. Dussaule J.C. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 327-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Endothelin-induced phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase and endothelin-induced increase in collagen I gene activity were completely prevented by an inhibitor of the EGFR kinase. Thus, EGFR does not only transduce the signal of its classical ligand EGF but also serves as a heterologous transducer for other signaling pathways (24Hackel P.O. Zwick E. Prenzel N. Ullrich A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 184-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 25Moghal N. Sternberg P.W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) including glucocorticoids, aldosterone, and estrogen. The steroids modulate EGFR activity and the downstream signaling modules (17Krug A.W. Schuster C. Gassner B. Freudinger R. Mildenberger S. Troppmair J. Gekle M. J. Biol.

This study was designed to investigate the effect of aldosterone and the MR on EGFR expression.MATERIALS AND METHODSAnimal Study—Male Munich-Wistar rats weighing between 250 and 350 g (Charles River, Sulzfeld, Germany) underwent adrenalectomy or sham operation under NarcorenR anesthesia using two lumbodorsal incisions. Aldosterone (ADX+aldo) (36 μg/100 g body weight and day) or vehicle (ADX) was applied by osmotic mini-pumps (model 2ML1, Alzet, Palo Alto, CA). The adrenalectomized animals were maintained on 0.9% NaCl solution in lieu of drinking water and on a standard rat pellet diet (35Wiederholt M. Stolte H. Brecht J.P. Hierholzer K. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1966; 292: 316-333Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 36Krug A.W. Papavassiliou F. Hopfer U. Ullrich K.J. Gekle M. Pflugers Arch. 2003; 446: 492-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The completeness of adrenalectomy and the effectiveness of aldosterone application by osmotic mini-pump were assessed by determination of plasma aldosterone and the plasma Na+/K+ ratio. Plasma aldosterone in ADX animals was 0.06 ± 0.02 and 6.3 ± 0.8 nmol/liter in ADX+aldosterone animals. The Na+/K+ ratio was 27 ± 5 in ADX animals and 54 ± 2 in ADX+aldosterone animals. 5 days after adrenalectomy, the animals were anesthetized with Inactin (120 mg/kg body weight, Byk-Gulden, Konstanz, Germany), the kidneys were removed, and the cortex was homogenized with 20 strokes of a Janke & Kunkel (Staufen, Germany) homogenizer at 4 °C. Protein content was determined according to Lowry (37Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, equal amounts of protein (60 μg) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot as described below.Cell Culture—CHO-K1 cells from ATCC (Manassas, VA) were cultivated as described previously (17Krug A.W.

Cells were grown in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C and 5% CO2. 24 h prior to the experiments, serum was removed from the media. For the experiments presented, the cells were cultivated either on Petri dishes (BD Biosciences) or in 96-well plates (for pERK1/2-ELISA). Primary cells of human kidney cortex were purchased from Clonetics (Walkersville, MD) and cultured according to the manufacturer's instructions.Transfection and Dilution Cloning—Transfection of the cells was performed with the Qiagen Polyfect reagent (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. We used the HER1 expression vector pRK5-HER1 (38Redemann N. Holzmann B. von Ruden T. Wagner E.F. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1992; 12: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), the hMR expression vector pcDNA1-MR, the hGR expression vector pcDNA1-GR (18Gekle M. Freudinger R. Mildenberger S. Silbernagl S. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: F669-F679Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and pBabepuro (39Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1892) Google Scholar), which carries a puromycin resistance gene (ratio 10:1). Selection of transfected clones was performed with puromycin (5 mg/liter). After isolating clones by limited dilution cloning, their hMR or hGR expression was determined by RT-PCR and their EGF receptor expression was determined by Western blot analysis.Western Blot Analysis—Cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in ice-cold Triton X-100 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 200 μm sodium orthovanadate, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin A, 40 mg/liter bestatin, 2 mg/liter aprotinin, 1% Triton X-100) or RIPA buffer for 25 min at 4 °C. Cell lysates were matched for protein content, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Subsequently, membranes were blotted with either rabbit anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibody, rabbit anti-ERK1/2 antibody (1:1000, New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), rabbit anti-EGFR-antibody (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), or goat anti-MR-antibody (1:1000). The bound primary antibody was visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary IgG (1: 10,000–25,000) and the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences).Immunofluorescence—Cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde (15 min), washed three times with PBS, and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100. Subsequently, cells were incubated for 10 min in 1% SDS/PBS followed by 10 min of 100 mmol/liter glycine/PBS and finally for 20 min in 10% serum, 1% bovine serum albumin/PBS. After 60-min incubation with anti-EGFR, the cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated for 45 min with anti-rabbit-Cy3 secondary antibody. After three further washes, the cells were transferred to the stage of an inverted microscope (Zeiss IM 35) and fluorescence images were taken using a ICCD camera (Hamamatsu, Herrsching, Germany).Quantification of ERK1/2 Phosphorylation by ELISA—Quantification of ERK1/2 phosphorylation was done by pERK1/2-ELISA according to Versteeg et al. (40Versteeg H.H. Nijhuis E. Van den Brink G.R. Evertzen M. Pynaert G.N. van Deventer S.J. Coffer P.J. Peppelenbosch M.P. Biochem.

Cells were seeded in 96-well plates (Maxisorp, Nunc) and serum-starved for 24 h prior to the experiment. After stimulation as indicated in the text, the cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS and washed three times with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Cells were blocked with 10% fetal calf serum in PBS/Triton X-100 for 1 h and incubated overnight with the primary antibody (1:1000). After three washes, cells were incubated with the secondary antibody (peroxidase-conjugated mouse anti-rabbit antibody, dilution 1:10000) in PBS/Triton X-100 with 5% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature and washed three times with PBS/Triton X-100 for 5 min and twice with PBS. Subsequently, the cells were incubated with 50 μl of a solution containing 0.4 mg/ml O-phenylenediamine, 11.8 mg/ml Na2HPO4, 7.3 mg/ml citric acid, and 0.015% H2O2 15 min at room temperature in the dark. The resulting signal was detected at 490 nm with a multiwell multilabel counter (Victor2, Wallac, Turku, Finland). Finally, protein content in the wells was determined with trypan blue solution (17Krug A.W. Schuster C. Gassner B. Freudinger R. Mildenberger S. Troppmair J. Gekle M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45892-45897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).RT-PCR, PCR, and Sequencing—RNA was isolated using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and genomic DNA was isolated using standard techniques (41Gross-Bellard M. Oudet P. Chambon P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 36: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar). RT-PCR was performed using the SuperScript™ One-Step RT-PCR kit from Invitrogen. PCR was performed using the TaqPCR kit from Qiagen. Sequencing was carried out by MWG-Biotech AG (Ebersberg, Germany). The following primers were used: MR forward 1, 5′-ACACTGCTTCTGGCACCTCT-3′; MR reverse 1, 5′-AAAGCTCCATCTGGTTCTGG-3′ (annealing temperature, 57 °C, 35 cycles, product size 190 bp); MR forward 2, 5′-ATCACGATCGGCTAGAGACC-3′; MR reverse 2, 5′-CCCATAATGGCATCCTGAAG-3′ (annealing temperature 57 °C, 35 cycles, product size 244 bp); GR forward 1, 5′-TCCCTTTCTCAACAGCAGGAT-3′; and GR reverse 1, 5′-CAATCATTCCTTCCAGCACAT-′ (annealing temperature 55 °C, 35 cycles, product size 371 bp).EGFR Promoter Activity Determination—The pER-1-Luc construct containing firefly luciferase under the control of the EGFR promoter was kindly provided by Dr. A. Johnson (National Institutes of Health) (30Nishi H. Senoo M. Nishi K.H. Murphy B. Rikiyama T. Matsumura Y. Habu S. Johnson A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41717-41724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with pER-1-Luc and the secretory alkaline phosphatase2 construct (constitutively expressing secretory alkaline phosphatase to determine transfection efficiency). Luciferase activity was determined using the Steady-Glo luciferase assay system (Promega, Madison, WI), and secretory alkaline phosphatase 2 was determined using the AttoPhos AP detection system (Promega). Luciferase activity was always corrected for secretory alkaline phosphatase 2 activity.Materials—U0126, tyrphostin AG 1478, and the protease inhibitors were purchased from Calbiochem. Unless stated otherwise, all of the other materials were obtained from Sigma. Control Ringer solution was composed of (mmol/liter): 130.0 NaCl; 5.4 KCl; 1.0 CaCl2; 1.0 MgCl2; 1.0 NaH2PO4; 10 HEPES; and 5 glucose, pH 7.4, at 37 °C plus the respective vehicles (ethanol or Me2SO ≤ 1‰).Statistics—The data are presented as mean values ± S.E. Significance of difference was tested by paired or unpaired Student's t test or ANOVA as applicable. Differences were considered significant if p < 0.05. Cells from at least two different passages were used for each experimental series. n represents the number of cell or tissue culture dishes investigated.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONFirst, we tested whether aldosterone application to adrenalectomized rats affects EGFR expression. For this purpose, we analyzed kidney cortex homogenates. Fig. 1a shows that the application of aldosterone resulted in an enhanced expression of EGFR. The serum concentration of aldosterone (6.3 ± 0.8 nmol/liter) was in the high physiological to low pathophysiological range of aldosterone but was one to two orders of magnitude below the concentration range of glucocorticoids. Our results show that aldosterone stimulates EGFR expression in vivo, most probably via the MR. Of course, the in vivo data presented here are not complete and future studies will have to investigate in detail different tissues and compare the effects of aldosterone to those of dexamethasone (a GR agonist) and spironolactone (a MR antagonist). Studies from other groups have already provided evidence for a stimulatory action of aldosterone on EGFR expression (19Florian J.A. Dorrance A. Webb R.C. Watts S.W. Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2001; 281: R878-R886Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Dorrance A.M. Osborn H.L. Grekin R. Webb R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: R944-R950PubMed Google Scholar). A general up-regulation of protein expression can be excluded because (i) equal amounts of total protein were loaded for each sample and (ii) because we have shown in a previous study (36Krug A.W. Papavassiliou F. Hopfer U. Ullrich K.J. Gekle M. Pflugers Arch. 2003; 446: 492-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) that total cortical NHE3 expression is not affected by the same maneuver. In a next step, we used human kidney cortex cells to test whether there is a direct effect of aldosterone on human cells. RT-PCR (Fig. 1b) and Western blot analysis (Fig. 1c) provided evidence for the expression of MR in the cells used. Application of aldosterone in a similar concentration range as in the in vivo study led to an increased EGFR expression (Fig. 1d). Thus, the in vivo data could be reproduced in a primary cell culture of human origin.Because our data indicated that aldosterone stimulates EGFR expression via the MR, we turned our experimental focus to a heterologous expression system of CHO cells transfected with hMR or hGR. This system has the advantage of being well defined and the disadvantage of not representing differentiated tissue. However, for our purposes the advantages clearly outweigh the disadvantages. Fig. 2a shows that CHO cells, which do not express EGFR or MR and are not responsive to EGF under control conditions (17Krug A.W. Schuster C. Gassner B. Freudinger R. Mildenberger S. Troppmair J. Gekle M. J. Biol.

This result was reproduced in three independently isolated CHO-MR cell clones and several mock-transfected clones (Fig. 2, b and c). The expression of EGFR could be also detected by immunofluorescence (Fig. 2d), and there was no major difference in EGFR distribution when comparing cells transfected with human EGFR1 (17Krug A.W.

Thus, not only estrogen receptors and thyroid hormone receptors affect EGFR expression as mentioned under Introduction but also the mineralocorticoid receptor.Fig. 2EGFR expression in CHO cells transfected with hMR. a, successful transfection of CHO cells with human MR (CHO-MR) was evaluated by RT-PCR. Subsequently, EGFR expression in CHO-MR cells and in cells transfected with the empty plasmid (CHO-pcDNA) was determined by Western blot. CHO cells transfected with human EGFR (CHO-HER1) (17Krug A.W.

The left panel shows that the primer pair used is suitable for MR detection because we obtained the expected signal during genomic PCR. The sequence of this CHO-MR fragment is identical to human MR (numbering of hMR is according to Arriza et al. (9Arriza J.L. Weinberger C. Cerelli G. Glaser T.M. Handelin B.L. Housman D.E. Evans R.M. Science. 1987; 237: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (1632) Google Scholar)). The right panel shows that RT-PCR yields no signal, indicating that endogenous MR is not expressed (positive control = hMR-transfected CHO-cells). f, using a primer pair that spans intron B in human MR, we obtained a RT-PCR signal of the expected size from MDCK-C11 cell RNA indicating the expression of endogenous MR. The sequence of MDCK-MR is 95% homologous to human MR. In addition, this experiment confirms the lack of expression of MR in CHO-wild-type or CHO-mock cells. g, incubation of MDCK-C11 cells with 10 nmol/liter aldosterone stimulates EGFR expression.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The negative RT-PCR results for MR obtained with CHO-mock cells could be interpreted in the way that the primers used did not correspond to the CHO-MR sequence, which is currently unknown, and therefore endogenous MR was not detected. To rule out this possibility, we used the MR primer pair 1 (see “Materials and”Methods“), which spans a region on exon 1 of the hMR (42Zennaro M.C. Keightley M.-C. Kotelevtsev Y. Conway G.S.

Fig. 2e shows the positive signal obtained as well as the sequence identity with hMR, indicating that our primers were suitable to detect CHO-MR. These data support our hypothesis that endogenous MR expression in CHO cells is neglectable. Stable transfection of hMR may lead to overexpression, and it cannot be ruled out completely that overexpressed MR exhibits a different transactivation profile than endogenous MR. The animal studies and the data on human cells in primary culture (Fig. 1) argue against this possibility. To strengthen our hypoth"

Modulation of this release has important consequences for defining the particular spatio-temporal characteristics of Ca2+ signals. In this study, regulation of Ca2+ release by phosphorylation of type-1 InsP3R (InsP3R-1) by cAMP (PKA)- and cGMP (PKG)-dependent protein kinases was investigated in the two major splice variants of InsP3R-1. InsP3R-1 was expressed in DT-40 cells devoid of endogenous InsP3R. In cells expressing the neuronal, S2+ splice variant of the InsP3R-1, Ca2+ release was markedly enhanced when either PKA or PKG was activated. The sites of phosphorylation were investigated by mutation of serine residues present in two canonical phosphorylation sites present in the protein. Potentiated Ca2+ release was abolished when serine 1755 was mutated to alanine (S1755A) but was unaffected by a similar mutation of serine 1589 (S1589A). These data demonstrate that Ser-1755 is the functionally important residue for phosphoregulation by PKA and PKG in the neuronal variant of the InsP3R-1. Activation of PKA also resulted in potentiated Ca2+ release in cells expressing the non-neuronal, S2- splice variant of the InsP3R-1. However, the PKA-induced potentiation was still evident in S1589A or S1755A InsP3R-1 mutants. The effect was abolished in the double (S1589A/S1755A) mutant, indicating both sites are phosphorylated and contribute to the functional effect. Activation of PKG had no effect on Ca2+ release in cells expressing the S2- variant of InsP3R-1. Collectively, these data indicate that phosphoregulation of InsP3R-1 has dramatic effects on Ca2+ release and defines the molecular sites phosphorylated in the major variants expressed in neuronal and peripheral tissues.

Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors are ubiquitous ligand-gated ion channels localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, which function to couple activation of cell surface receptors to intracellular Ca2+ release (1Berridge M.J.

Notably, the type-1 receptor gene is alternatively spliced to yield additional variants of the receptor, which have specific tissue distribution (6Nakagawa T. Okano H. Furuichi T. Aruga J.

The functional channel is a tetramer, consisting of a binding site for InsP3 in the N terminus of each subunit (8Yoshikawa F. Morita M. Monkawa T. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol.

Between these regions is a cytoplasmic loop of ∼1600 amino acids, which is termed the regulatory and coupling domain. In this region, sites are located that are thought to be important in modulating the Ca2+ release properties of the channel (12Patel S. Joseph S.K. Thomas A.P. Cell Calcium. 1999; 25: 247-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). This regulation of InsP3R, together with the complement of InsP3R types and the sub-cellular localization of the channel, are thought to be the major determinants of the spatio-temporal characteristics of agonist-evoked Ca2+ signals (13Berridge M.J.

These particular characteristics likely contribute to the fidelity and specificity associated with activation of Ca2+-dependent effectors.

Although phosphorylation of the S2+ InsP3R-1 was originally reported to result in decreased Ca2+ release, more recent studies have indicated that phosphorylation results in enhanced release (23Tang T.S.

The functional effects of phosphorylation at each site have not been evaluated, presumably because of the lack of a suitable null background to perform mutational analysis.

Studies of the functional effects of phosphorylation of the peripheral form have suggested that, in contrast to the neuronal form of the receptor, phosphorylation of the “short form” of the InsP3R-1 results in attenuated Ca2+ release (21Tertyshnikova S. Yan X. Fein A. J. Physiol. 1998; 512: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 22Tertyshnikova S. Fein A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1613-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Thus, the possibility exists that differences in both the sites of phosphorylation and therefore the functional effects of phosphorylation are defined by the particular splice variants expressed in particular tissues. In this study we have investigated the sites of phosphorylation by PKA and PKG, functionally important for regulation of Ca2+ release in the two major splice variants of the InsP3R-1. By expression of mutant InsP3R-1 in InsP3R null DT-40 cells (42Miyakawa T. Maeda A. Yamazawa T. Hirose K. Kurosaki T. Iino M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1303-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 43Sugawara H. Kurosaki M. Takata M. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3078-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), our studies reveal that phosphorylation of Ser-1755 by PKA or PKG results in markedly enhanced Ca2+ release for S2+ InsP3R-1. Notably, in S2- InsP3R-expressing cells, PKG activation does not markedly alter Ca2+ release, whereas PKA-mediated phosphorylation of both Ser-1755 and Ser-1589 results in enhanced Ca2+ release. Thus, the expression of particular InsP3R splice variants defines the functional consequences of phosphoregulation by cyclic nucleotide-dependent kinases. Materials—The acetoxymethylesters of Fura-2 and Fluo-4 were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Fura-2FF was purchased from Tefabs (Austin, TX). Cell-permeable cyclic nucleotides and forskolin were purchased from BIOMOL (Plymouth Meeting, PA). All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). The DT-40 cells lacking InsP3R (DT-40 3ko) were kindly provided by Dr. Kurosaki (Kansai Medical University, Japan) and were maintained as previously described (42Miyakawa T. Maeda A. Yamazawa T.

Production of Mutations—The S1-/S2+ InsP3R-1 in the expression plasmid pIRES-GFP (provided by Dr. S. Joseph, Thomas Jefferson University) was digested with the restriction endonuclease SalI. The overhang created by digestion was blunted using T4 polymerase. An EcoRI linker was then ligated onto the blunted ends of the construct. The entire receptor DNA was excised from the plasmid using EcoRI and ligated into the plasmid MXT-1. The region containing the S2- splice variant and potential PKA phosphorylation sites was excised from its backbone in pCDNA 3.1+ (provided by Dr. S. Joseph, Thomas Jefferson University) by RsrII and KasI and ligated into the InsP3R construct in MXT-1. The potential PKA sites, Ser-1589 and Ser-1755, were mutated, individually in both splice variants and together in the S2- splice variant, to alanines using sequential PCR mutagenesis. The outer oligonucleotides used for the mutagenesis reaction flanked the restriction sites RsrII and KasI. Following mutation, the resulting fragments were cut with RsrII and KasI and inserted into the IP3R-1 backbone at the corresponding sites. The mutations and lack of spurious misincorporations were confirmed by Big Dye fluorescent sequencing. Mutated receptor DNAs were excised from MXT-1 using EcoRI and ligated into the mammalian expression vector pGW (provided by Dr. David Yue, Johns Hopkins University). Orientation was confirmed by using restriction enzyme digestion. Transfection of DT-40 Cells—DT-40 cells lacking all three InsP3 receptor subtypes were transfected using electroporation, at 350 V and 950 microfarads. 2 × 107 cells were co-transfected with 25 μg of the InsP3R cDNA, 25 μg of the muscarinic type 3 (M3) receptor, and 4 μg of the red fluorescent protein plasmid pHcRed1-N1. Cells were incubated with DNA in 500 μl of Opti-MEM media on ice for 10 min. The cell/DNA mixture was electroporated, incubated on ice for 30 min, brought up to 5 ml with Opti-MEM, and placed in a 5% CO2 incubator at 39 °C for 5 h. The cells were then centrifuged and resuspended in 12 ml of complete RPMI media. Transfection efficiency was typically ∼20%. Experiments were performed within 32 h of transfection. Digital Imaging of [Ca + 2] i —Transfected DT-40 3ko cells were washed once in a HEPES-buffered physiological saline solution (HEPES-PSS) containing (in mm) 5.5 glucose, 137 NaCl, 0.56 MgCl2, 4.7 KCl, 1 Na2HPO4, 10 HEPES (pH 7.4), 1.2 CaCl2, and 1% w/v bovine serum albumin. Cells were then resuspended in bovine serum albumin HEPES-PSS with 1 μm Fura-2AM, placed on a 15-mm glass coverslip in a low volume perfusion chamber (Warner Instruments), and allowed to adhere for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were perfused continually for 10 min with HEPES-PSS before experimentation to allow Fura-2AM de-esterification. A field of cells for each experiment was chosen that contained a wide range of transfection efficiency based upon the intensity of red fluorescence emitted when excited at 560 nm. [Ca2+]i imaging was performed essentially as previously described (28Giovannucci D.R. Groblewski G.E. Sneyd J. Yule D.I. J. Biol.

Cells were excited alternately with light at 340 and 380 nm (±10-nm bandpass filters, Chroma) using a monochrometer (TILL Photonics). Fluorescence images were captured and digitized with a digital camera driven by TILL Photonics software. Images were captured every 2 s with an exposure of 35 ms and no binning. 340/380 ratio images were calculated online and stored immediately to hard disk. Only data from cells exhibiting an increase in ratio units of less than 0.2 upon stimulation were used for further analysis. Flash Photolysis—Transfected cells were simultaneously loaded by incubation with the visible wavelength indicator Fluo-4 and a cell-permeable form of caged inositol trisphosphate (ciIP3/PM) for 30 min. ciIP3/PM is a homologue of cmIP3/PM (45Li W. Llopis J. Whitney M. Zlokarnik G. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1998; 392: 936-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar) The 2- and 3-hydroxyls of the inositol ring were protected by an isopropylidene group in ciIP3/PM and were protected by a methoxymethylene group in cmIP3/PM. Like cmIP3/PM, ciIP3/PM diffuses across cell membranes and induces internal calcium release upon photo-uncaging. 2W.-H. Li, unpublished data. A further period of ∼30 min was allowed for de-esterification of both dye and cage. Cells were illuminated at 488 ± 10 nm, and fluorescence was collected through a 525 ± 25-nm band pass filter and captured using the Till Photonics imaging suite. These traces are displayed as % ΔF/F 0, where F is the recorded fluorescence and F 0 is the mean of the initial 10 sequential frames. Photolytic release was performed as previously described (28Giovannucci D.R. Groblewski G.E. Sneyd J. Yule D.I. J. Biol.

A high intensity (0.5- to 5-ms duration; 80 J) discharge of UV light (360 ± 7.5 nm) was reflected onto the plane of focus using a DM400 dichroic mirror and Nikon 40× oil immersion objective (numerical aperture, 1.3). Statistical Analysis—The effects of treatment were determined by normalizing the peak change in fluorescence ratio by stimulation following forskolin or 8-Br-cGMP exposure to that of stimulation in control HEPES-PSS. Thus, pooled data represents a normalized -fold increase over control for the treated trial. Two tailed heteroscedastic t tests with p values < 0.05 were considered to have statistical significance. PKA Phosphorylation of Ser-1755 in S2 + InsP 3 R-1 Results in Enhanced Ca2 + Release—A majority of studies have reported that PKA activation results in enhanced InsP3-induced Ca2+ release from the neuronal form of the InsP3R-1 (23Tang T.S. Tu H. Wang Z. Bezprozvanny I. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 403-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Nakade S. Rhee S.K. Hamanaka H. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 5670-5677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). To confirm these earlier findings, experiments were performed in DT-40 3ko cells transfected with S2+ InsP3R-1. Because to our knowledge there are no reports of Gαq-coupled receptors expressed in DT-40 cells, initial experiments were performed eliciting [Ca2+]i changes by stimulating the endogenous B cell receptor with α-IgM antibody. This resulted in somewhat irregular Ca2+ oscillations, which were not reversible when the antibody was removed making paired analysis of any effects of raising cyclic nucleotides difficult to interpret (data not shown). Thus, in all further experiments, DT-40 3ko cells were cotransfected with the M3 receptor and HcRed, to facilitate identification of transfected cells (inset, Fig. 1). Stimulation of M3 receptors with the muscarinic agonist carbachol (CCh), provided a convenient means of stimulating [Ca2+]i changes, presumably through Gαq-induced activation of phospholipase C and production of InsP3. Stimulation with a low concentration of CCh (25-50 nm) resulted in an increase in [Ca2+]i, which returned to baseline when the agonist was removed. Following 10-min incubation with 20 μm forskolin to maximally raise cAMP, the initial peak in [Ca2+]i elicited by identical CCh treatment was markedly potentiated (Fig. 1A and pooled data in Fig. 1D). After washout of forskolin a subsequent stimulation resulted in a [Ca2+]i change comparable to the initial exposure. The potentiation was most marked when threshold elevations in [Ca2+]i were evoked by the initial exposure to CCh, and therefore only cells in which the initial CCh treatment evoked a Δ340/380 ratio of <0.2 ratio units were included for analysis. These data are consistent with previous reports that phosphorylation of the S2+ InsP3R results in enhanced Ca2+ release by increasing the sensitivity of the receptor to InsP3 (23Tang T.S. Tu H. Wang Z. Bezprozvanny I. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 403-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Wojcikiewicz R.J. Luo S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5670-5677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). [Ca2+]i changes were never evoked by CCh treatment in cells transfected with only M3 cDNA in the absence of InsP3R or likewise InsP3R with no M3 cDNA. Similarly, cells exhibiting no HcRed fluorescence seldom responded to CCh treatment (black trace, Fig. 1A). Phosphorylation of both Ser-1589 and Ser-1755 have been reported following PKA activation (34Ferris C.D. Cameron A.M. Bredt D.S. Huganir R.L. Snyder S.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

In the present report, we used the oligonucleotide microarray technique to identify new hypoxia-inducible genes in malignant melanoma with a special emphasis on angiogenesis factors. A commercially available Affymetrix® gene chip system was used to analyze five melanoma cell lines of different aggressiveness. A total of 160 hypoxia-inducible genes were identified, clustering in four different functional clusters. In search of putative angiogenesis and tumor progression factors within these clusters, Cyr61, a recently discovered angiogenesis factor, was identified. Cyr61 was hypoxia-inducible in low aggressive melanoma cells; however, it showed constitutive high expression in highly aggressive melanoma cells. Further analyses of transcriptional mechanisms underlying Cyr61 gene expression under hypoxia demonstrated that an AP-1 binding motif within the Cyr61 promoter plays a central role in the hypoxic regulation of Cyr61. It could be shown by use of in vitro luciferase assays, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and immunoprecipitation that hypoxia-inducible factor-1α interacts with c-Jun/AP-1 and may thereby contribute to Cyr61 transcriptional regulation under hypoxia. Taken together, the presented data show that Cyr61 is a hypoxia-inducible angiogenesis factor in malignant melanoma with tumor stage-dependent expression. This may argue for a hypoxia-induced selection process during tumor progression toward melanoma cells with constitutive high Cyr61 expression.

This may argue for a hypoxia-induced selection process during tumor progression toward melanoma cells with constitutive high Cyr61 expression. It is well accepted that local growth and metastasis of a large variety of malignant tumors are dependent on neoangiogenesis (1Folkman J. J. Natl.

The process of tumor angiogenesis is largely based on the production and secretion of so-called angiogenesis factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), 1The abbreviations used are: VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; ECL, enhanced chemiluminescence; DMRIE-C™, 1,2-dimyristyloxypropyl-3-dimethylhydroxyethyl ammonium bromide; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; HIF-1α, hypoxia-inducible factor-1α; AP-1, activator protein-1; ARNT, aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator; CTGF, connective tissue growth factor; STAT-1, signal transducer and activator of transcription-1; Ab, antibody; IL, interleukin; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; MEKK, mitogen-activated extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; CMV, cytomegalovirus; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropane-sulfonic acid; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; FCS, fetal calf serum.1The abbreviations used are: VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; ECL, enhanced chemiluminescence; DMRIE-C™, 1,2-dimyristyloxypropyl-3-dimethylhydroxyethyl ammonium bromide; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; HIF-1α, hypoxia-inducible factor-1α; AP-1, activator protein-1; ARNT, aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator; CTGF, connective tissue growth factor; STAT-1, signal transducer and activator of transcription-1; Ab, antibody; IL, interleukin; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; MEKK, mitogen-activated extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; CMV, cytomegalovirus; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropane-sulfonic acid; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; FCS, fetal calf serum. fibroblast growth factor, and interleukin (IL)-8 (3Carmeliet P.

Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 68: 1-8PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms of angiogenesis factor production are still poorly understood. Evidence has been provided that a constitutive high expression of angiogenesis factors in isolated tumor cells or cell clones may be the first step in a selection process toward angiogenesis factor-producing tumors (6Rak J. Yu J.L. Klement G. Kerbel R.S. J. Invest. Dermatol. Symp. Proc. 2000; 5: 24-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). This constitutive high expression in tumor cells may derive from the so-called “angiogenic switch,” which is supposed to happen very early during tumor development initiating a selection process (for review, see Ref. 2Hanahan D. Folkman J. Cell. 1996; 86: 353-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6016) Google Scholar). In accordance with this, it has been shown that a constitutive high expression of IL-8 promotes tumor growth of melanoma cells in vivo (7Singh R.K. Gutman M. Radinsky R. Bucana C.D. Fiedler I.J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3242-3247PubMed Google Scholar, 8Luca M. Huang S. Gershenwald J.E. Singh R.K. Reich R. Bar-Eli M. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 151: 1105-1113PubMed Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the induction of the angiogenic switch in tumors have not been defined so far.More recent investigations have emphasized that the specific conditions of the tumor microenvironment may have a strong impact on the secretion of angiogenesis factors. In particular, tissue hypoxia has been shown to play a key role for the induction of these factors (9Folkman J. Shing Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10931-10934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Bouck N. Stellmach V. Hsu S.C. Adv. Cancer Res. 1996; 69: 135-174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Harris A.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 38-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (4204) Google Scholar). Interestingly, even after neovascularization, tumor areas may remain under low oxygen tension, because of inadequate vascularization after neoangiogenesis (12Helmlinger G. Yuan F. Dellian M. Jain R.K. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1326) Google Scholar). Thus, hypoxic areas remain a constant feature of malignant tumors and metastases. Up to now a large series of angiogenesis factors have been identified to be inducible by hypoxia. Among these are fibroblast growth factor, VEGF, platelet-derived growth factor, IL-8, and angiogenin (13Shweiki D. Itin A. Soffer D. Keshet E.

It could be shown that the transcription factors AP-1 and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α are major contributors to gene transcription of hypoxia-inducible genes (21Rupec R.A. Baeuerle P.A. Eur. J.

In search for further upstream activators, signal transduction cascades interfering with transcription factors were analyzed in more detail. It could be shown that protein kinase C and the stress signaling pathway of c-Jun N-terminal kinase might play a central role in hypoxic signaling (28Goldberg M. Zhang H.L. Steinberg S.F. J. Clin.

However, the mechanisms underlying hypoxic signal transduction are still poorly defined.In the present report we used the oligonucleotide microarray technique to analyze the gene expression pattern of malignant melanoma cells in search for new hypoxia-inducible genes involved in tumor angiogenesis. It could be shown that Cyr61, a recently discovered angiogenesis factor, is hypoxia-inducible in malignant melanoma cells. Moreover, Cyr61 showed a tumor stage-dependent expression with a constitutive strong expression in highly aggressive melanoma cell lines. The underlying mechanisms of its transcriptional regulation under hypoxia were further studied. We demonstrated that AP-1 and HIF-1α may both contribute to hypoxia-induced gene expression of Cyr61.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlasmids—The following plasmid constructs were used for co-transfection studies in in vitro luciferase assays: pRc/CMV, pRc/CMV-HIF-1α, and pARNT/CMV4. The pRc/CMV plasmid (empty control vector) was purchased from Invitrogen (Leek, The Netherlands); the pRc/CMV-HIF-1α vector was generated by cloning of HIF-1α cDNA into the pRc/CMV vector.

The metastatic potential of these cell lines has been investigated in nude mice. The cell lines 530 and 1F6 represent low aggressive, non-metastatic cell lines; the cell line Mel57 has been characterized as intermediate to highly aggressive; and BLM and MV3 are both highly aggressive, metastatic cell lines (33Van Muijen G.N.

Melanoma cell lines and Jurkat cells (which were used in control experiments) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Linaris, Bettingen, Darmstadt, Germany), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; Linaris), 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% nonessential amino acids. Cells were cultured in a humidified incubator (37 °C in 5% CO2, 95% air). For hypoxic treatment cultures were transferred for different time periods to hypoxic culture conditions (1% O2; mentioned as hypoxia) in an hypoxic incubator as described previously (32Wenger R.H. Camenisch G. Desbaillets I. Chilov D. Gassmann M. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5678-5680PubMed Google Scholar). Harvesting of cells was also performed under hypoxic conditions to avoid reoxygenation artifacts. Parallel cultures were constantly kept under normal oxygen conditions (mentioned as normoxia). H-Ras-transformed wild type mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF-HIF+/+) and HIF-1α-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF-HIF-/-) (36Ryan H.E. Poloni M. McNulty W. Elson D. Gassmann M. Arbeit J.M. Johnson R.S. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4010-4015PubMed Google Scholar) were kept in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin.RNA Extraction and Gene Chip Hybridization—Melanoma cell lines 530, 1F6, Mel57, BLM, and MV3, respectively, were kept under normoxic conditions or exposed to 24 h of hypoxia (1% oxygen). Total RNA was isolated using the total RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). RNA concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically at 260 nm. Probes for chip hybridization derived from isolated RNA samples were generated according to the instructions from the supplier (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). The HuGeneFL Array™ (Affymetrix) with a capacity of 5600 human full-length characterized genes was used for mRNA expression profiling. Hybridization and washing of gene chips were performed according to the instructions from the supplier and as described earlier by Lockhart and co-workers (37Lockhart D.J. Dong H. Byrne M.C. Follettie M.T Gallo M.V. Chee M.S. Mittmann M. Wang C. Kobayashi M. Horton H. Brown E.L. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1675-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (2795) Google Scholar). A laser scanner (Hewlett-Packard Gene Scanner™) was used for analysis of gene chips, and the expression levels were calculated using a commercially available software provided by Affymetrix (Microarray Suite®).Biostatistical Analysis of Gene Chip Data—Before cluster analysis genes were pre-selected for those that showed increased expression under hypoxia in at least one out of five cell lines to encompass all hypoxia-inducible genes of our experiments. Pre-selection resulted in a list of 1349 candidate genes. These were subjected to hierarchical clustering using Eisen software as recently described (38Eisen M.B. Spellman P.T. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14863-14868Crossref PubMed Scopus (13134) Google Scholar). Clustering tools were downloaded from www.rana.lbl.gov/EisenSoftware.htm. Hierarchical clustering was performed using average linkage differences. The “-fold change” of gene expression under hypoxia was used as clustering parameter. By this means four different clusters (cluster I–IV) were generated overall covering 160 genes. Cluster IV was re-clustered to analyze absolute gene expression with the average difference (representing the absolute value of gene expression) as clustering parameter. In the latter analyses, gene expression values were normalized to the mean value of all genes in this experiment.Generation of a Cyr61 cDNA Probe—A Cyr61 cDNA probe for Northern hybridization was generated by reverse transcriptase-PCR. For this purpose total RNA was extracted from BLM melanoma cells using the total RNeasy kit (Qiagen). One μ g of total RNA was reverse transcribed by superscript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Eggenstein, Germany) using hexamer priming. Primers for PCR amplification were purchased from ARK Scientific Biosystems (Darmstadt, Germany). These had the following recently published sequences (39Tsai M.S. Hornby A.E. Lakins J. Lupu R. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5603-5607PubMed Google Scholar): 5′ primer, 5′-TGTGGAACTGGTATCTCCACACGA-3′; 3′ primer, TCTTTTCACTGAATATAAAATTAAAA-3′. PCR amplification generated a cDNA probe of 1039 bp length. PCR conditions: an initial 5-min denaturation step was followed by 10 cycles of 30 s of denaturation at 94 °C, 30 s of annealing at 58 °C, 1 min of primer extension at 72 °C. After that, 20 cycles of 30 s of denaturation at 94 °C, 30 s of annealing at 60 °C, and 1 min of primer extension at 72 °C were carried out. A terminal primer extension step of 10 min at 72 °C was added. The PCR products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. The specific fragment of 1039 bp was cut out, purified using the QIAExII gel extraction kit (Qiagen), cloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega, Heidelberg, Germany), and sequenced using an automated capillary sequencer (PerkinElmer, Weiterstadt, Germany). For Northern hybridization the cDNA probe was cut out from the pGEM-T vector by restriction enzyme digest and radioactively labeled.RNA Extraction and Northern Blot Analysis—Total cytoplasmic RNA was isolated using the total RNeasy kit (Qiagen). RNA concentration was determined spectrophotometrically at 260 nm. Fifteen micrograms of RNA/sample were denatured in 50% formamide in gel running buffer (0.1 m MOPS, pH 7.0, 40 mm sodium acetate, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) for 15 min at 65 °C, fractionated on a 1% agarose gel in formaldehyde buffer, and subsequently transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond N+, Amersham Biosciences) in 20× SSC. As a probe for Cyr61 mRNA, a specific 1039 cDNA fragment was used. For Northern hybridization the purified fragment was labeled to high specific activity with [32P]dATP using a random primer labeling system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany). Membranes were cross-linked by ultraviolet light irradiation and prehybridized in a dextran sulfate buffer (100 g/liter dextran sulfate, 0.6 m NaCl, 0.2 m Na2HPO4, 6 mm EDTA, 1.75% lauroylsarcosinate, 50 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, pH 6.2) for 1 h at 65 °C. Hybridization was carried out in the same prehybridization solution containing 5 × 106 cpm/ml of labeled probe. After hybridization for 16 h at 65 °C and 6 h at 60 °C, membranes were washed twice with 2× SSPE, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) at room temperature; once with 1× SSPE, 0.1% SDS at 60 °C; and once again with 0.2× SSPE, 0.1% SDS. Membranes were then exposed to Hyperfilm™ (Amersham Biosciences) with intensifying screens at -80 °C for 3 days. Northern blots for ribosomal L28 RNA were performed, which served as control for equal loading (40Wenger R.H. Rolfs A. Marti H.H. Bauer C. Gassmann M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27865-27870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar).Generation of Cyr61 Promoter Luciferase Constructs—A 883-bp and a 605-bp fragment, respectively, of the recently published promoter region of the Cyr61 gene (Ref. 41Schütze N. Rücker N. Müller J. Adamski J. Jakob F. Mol. Pathol. 2001; 54: 170-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar; EMBL GenBank™, accession no. HSA249826) were generated by PCR amplification. The first fragment covers almost the complete Cyr61 promoter region of 935 bp beginning at the transcription start site. Further 5′ sequences (beyond position -883) carry no binding motifs for known transcription factors. The second fragment (605 bp) covers the promoter region (also beginning at the transcription start site) ending immediately downstream of an AP-1 binding motif (TGACTCA) at position -624. For fragment generation of the Cyr61 promoter, genomic DNA was isolated from BLM melanoma cells using a commercially available DNA isolation kit (Qiagen). PCR amplification was carried out using the following primers: 883-bp fragment: 5′ primer (5′-CGGGTACCTAAAGTGGGAACCTCCA-3′) and 3′ primer (5′-CCGCTCGAGTCTCGCTCGCGGTCTGCC-3′); 605-bp fragment: 5′ primer (5′-CGGGGTACCTCTTCCCCGTTCTACTC-3′) and 3′ primer (5′-CCGCTCGAGTCTCGCTCGCGGTCTGCC-3′). Both pairs of primers generated a KpnI restriction site at the 5′ end and an XhoI restriction site at the 3′ end of the amplified fragments. These sites were used for further cloning of the fragments into the pGL3 vector (Promega, Heidelberg, Germany). The pGL3 promoter constructs were sequenced using an automated capillary sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The promoter construct carrying the 883-bp fragment was termed cyr-900-luc, and the promoter construct with the 605-bp construct was termed cyr-600-luc.In Vitro Mutagenesis of Cyr61 Promoter—In vitro mutagenesis was performed to generate mutated cyr-900-luc constructs. A promoter construct with a mutated AP-1 binding motif was termed cyr-900APmut-luc. A promoter construct where all four HRE-like motifs (position -68, -371, -400, -653) mutated was termed cyr-900HIFmut-luc. For mutagenesis of the AP-1 binding motif, TGACTCA, this motif was changed to TGACTAC, which results in an inhibition of transcription factor binding (42Wenig H. Choi S.Y. Faller D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13637-13644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). For mutagenesis of the four HRE-like binding motifs, present on the promoter as CACG, this motif was changed to CTTT. A commercially available mutagenesis kit was used (QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and mutagenesis was performed according to the specifications from the manufacturer. The mutagenesis primers used were as follows.For AP-1 motif mutagenesis, primers were 5′-GAAGTCCACAAATATTCCTGACTACGAGACACACTCCTC-3′ and 5′-GAGGAGTGTGTCTCGTAGTCAGGAATATTTGTGGACTTC-3′. For mutagenesis of HRE-like motifs at position -68, primers were 5′-ACGTCACTGCAACTTTCGGCGCCTCCGC-3′ and 5′-GCGGAGGCGCCGAAAGTTGCAGTGACGT-3′; at position -371, 5′-CATCACCACCATCTTTCCCAAAGAACC-3′ and 5′-GGTTCTTTGGGGAAAGATGGTGGTGATG-3′; at position -400, 5′-CCCCTCGCCCCTCTTTACCCTCCAACTA-3′ and 5′-TAGTTGGAGGGTAAAAGGGGCGAGGGG-3′; and at position -653, 5′-ACTTGTTCCGAACTTTCCTCTTTGAAGT-3′ and 5′-ACTTCAAAGAGGAAAGTTCGGAACAAGT-3′.Successful mutagenesis was confirmed by sequencing using an automated capillary sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).In Vitro Luciferase Assays—Cyr61 promoter luciferase constructs were used for in vitro luciferase assays. For this purpose the melanoma cell line 1F6 was transfected with 2 μg of plasmid DNA (of wild type and mutated promoter constructs) using the DMRIE-C™ (1,2-dimyristyloxypropyl-3-dimethyl-hydroxyethyl ammonium bromide) reagent (Invitrogen) according to the specifications from the manufacturer. Briefly, cells were kept under serum-free medium for at least 16 h. 2 μg of plasmid DNA and DMRIE-C™ reagent, respectively, were diluted in 500 μl of OptiMEM (Invitrogen). Both mixtures were put together and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Culture medium was removed and the lipid-DNA overlaid onto cells and incubated overnight. Subsequently, medium was replaced by RPMI medium (10% FCS) and after additional 24 h changed to low serum conditions (1% FCS) for another 24 h. Subsequently, cells were exposed to hypoxic conditions for indicated time points.For luciferase assays, total cell extracts were prepared. Briefly, cells were harvested in 100 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm NaMES, pH 7.8, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 2% Triton X-100). The crude cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation, 50 μl of cleared cell extracts were added to 50 μl of luciferase assay buffer (125 mm NaMES, pH 7.8, 25 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mg/ml ATP), and activity was measured after injection of 50 μl of 1 mm d-luciferin (AppliChem, Darmstadt, Germany) in a Berthold luminometer (Berthold, Bad Wildbach, Germany). Total protein concentration was measured by the Bradford technique (Bio-Rad, München, Germany). The luciferase activities were normalized on the basis of protein content as well as on β-galactosidase activity of cotransfected Rous sarcoma virus-β-gal vector. The β-galactosidase assay was performed with 20 μl of precleared cell lysate according to a standard protocol, as described earlier (43Hoffmeyer A. Grosse-Wilde A. Flory E. Neufeld B. Kunz M. Rapp U.R. Ludwig S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4319-4327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). For calculation of the -fold induction of luciferase activities, parallel cultures under normoxia and hypoxia were analyzed. Mean ± S.D. of four independent experiments are shown.To analyze the effect of HIF-1α/ARNT on c-Jun-dependent transcription, a commercially available trans-reporting system (PathDetect®, Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany) was used. This system analyses the effects of upstream molecules (e.g. signaling kinases) on the transcriptional activity of c-Jun in an in vitro luciferase assay system. In our experiments, 1F6 melanoma cell were transfected with the fusion transactivator plasmid, pFA2-c-Jun, which contains the activation domain of c-Jun fused with the yeast GAL4 binding domain. The co-transfected pFR-Luc reporter plasmid carries five tandem repeats of a GAL4 binding site linked to the firefly luciferase gene. Co-transfection was performed with a combination of both HIF-1α/ARNT-carrying plasmids or an appropriate control plasmid, which was used for mock transfection (pFC-dbd). Parallel experiments were performed by co-transfection of mitogen-activated extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase kinase (MEKK), which served as a positive control. Total cell extracts were prepared for luciferase assays as described above.Preparation of Nuclear Extracts and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)—Melanoma cells (1F6 cell line) were exposed to hypoxic conditions for 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 h, respectively. Parallel cultures were kept under normoxia. Nuclear extracts were prepared as previously described (17Kunz M. Hartmann A. Flory E. Toksoy A. Koczan D. Thiesen H.J. Mukaida N. Neumann M. Rapp U.R. Bröcker E.B. Gillitzer R. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 753-763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and pelleted. Supernatants were removed, and cells were resuspended in 500 μl of buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and allowed to swell for 10 min. Cells were pulled 10–15 times through a 26-gauge 3/8 needle for cell membrane disruption, and nuclei were pelleted in a microcentrifuge. Nuclei were washed twice in buffer A and resuspended in 50 μl of buffer C (20 mm Hepes, 20% glycerol, 0.4 m NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated on ice for 45 min with occasional shaking. After centrifugation, supernatants were harvested, frozen, and stored at -70 °C. The following double-stranded oligonucleotide was used as probe (derived from Cyr61 promoter region including the AP-1 binding sequence (underlined)): 5′-AATATTCCTGACTCAGAGACACA-3′ and 5′-TGTGTCTCTGAGTCAGGAATATT-3′. In control experiments a commercially available STAT-1 probe (sc-2573; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany) with the following sequence was used (STAT-1 binding sequence underlined"
https://openalex.org/W2040332703,"Binding of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) to its receptor, TNF-R1, results in the activation of inhibitor of κB kinase (IKK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways that are coordinately regulated and important in survival and death. We demonstrated previously that in response to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), the ability of TNFα to activate IKK in mouse lung epithelial cells (C10) was inhibited and that H2O2 alone was sufficient to activate JNK and induce cell death. In the current study, we investigated the involvement of TNF-R1 in H2O2-induced JNK activation. In lung fibroblasts from TNF-R1-deficient mice the ability of H2O2 to activate JNK was inhibited compared with fibroblasts from control mice. Additionally, in C10 cells expressing a mutant form of TNF-R1, H2O2-induced JNK activation was also inhibited. Immunoprecipitation of TNF-R1 revealed that in response to H2O2, the adapter proteins, TRADD and TRAF2, and JNK were recruited to the receptor. However, expression of the adaptor protein RIP, which is essential for IKK activation by TNFα, was decreased in cells exposed to H2O2, and its chaperone Hsp90 was cleaved. Furthermore, data demonstrating that expression of TRAF2 was not affected by H2O2 and that overexpression of TRAF2 was sufficient to activate JNK provide an explanation for the inability of H2O2 to activate IKK and for the selective activation of JNK by H2O2. Our data demonstrate that oxidative stress interferes with IKK activation while promoting JNK signaling, creating a signaling imbalance that may favor apoptosis.

Despite the emerging role of redox signaling in cellular physiology, the exact mechanisms by which oxidants act as signaling molecules are under intense investigation, and many critical targets remain enigmatic.

Although oxidants have also been implicated in the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB, currently a number of significant controversies exist around the role of redox events in NF-κB activation (18Li N.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3356-3366Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Under basal conditions NF-κB is sequestered in the cytoplasm through binding to the inhibitor of κB (IκB). Upon phosphorylation of IκB by IκB kinase (IKK), IκB is rapidly degraded via the 26 S proteasome, allowing NF-κB to translocate to the nucleus and activate the transcription of over 100 genes, including genes critical to cell survival (20Barinaga M.

The signaling events that are required for the activation of JNK and NF-κB have been investigated in great detail using the ligand tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα). TNFα binds as a trimer to three TNF-R1 monomers causing aggregation of the intracellular death domains. The death domain (DD) containing-protein, TRADD, binds directly to the DD of TNF-R1 and then recruits the adaptor molecule (23Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 81: 495-504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1738) Google Scholar), TRAF2. TRAF2 is essential for JNK activation as well as the recruitment of the IKK complex to the receptor (24Devin A. Cook A. Lin Y. Rodriguez Y. Kelliher M. Liu Z.

Receptor-interacting protein (RIP) is recruited to TNF-R1 through interaction with TRADD and is essential for the activation of IKK (24Devin A. Cook A. Lin Y. Rodriguez Y. Kelliher M. Liu Z. Immunity. 2000; 12: 419-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Additionally, TRADD can directly interact with FADD, which is involved in executing caspase-dependent cell death. Recently it has been demonstrated that activation of IKK and JNK following stimulation of TNF-R1 is coordinately regulated and that the activation of NF-κB regulates the extent and duration of JNK activation. Transcription of NF-κB-driven anti-apoptotic genes such as X-IAP is critical in preventing sustained activation of JNK and also in promoting survival (25Tang G. Minemoto Y. Dibling B. Purcell N.H. Li Z. Karin M. Lin A. Nature. 2001; 414: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 26Tang F. Tang G. Xiang J. Dai Q. Rosner M.R. Lin A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 8571-8579Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Additionally, transient activation of JNK can also mediate survival signaling via JunD, which collaborates with NF-κB to increase the expression of the survival gene cIAP-2 (13Lamb J.A. Ventura J.J. Hess P. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1479-1489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Conversely, when NF-κB-dependent gene transcription is prevented, JNK activation is prolonged allowing the execution of TNF-induced apoptosis (25Tang G. Minemoto Y. Dibling B. Purcell N.H. Li Z. Karin M. Lin A. Nature. 2001; 414: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 26Tang F. Tang G. Xiang J. Dai Q. Rosner M.R. Lin A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 8571-8579Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Previously we demonstrated that the oxidant hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) inhibits IKK, activates JNK, and causes apoptosis (1Janssen Y.M. Matalon S. Mossman B.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: L789-L796PubMed Google Scholar, 8Korn S.H. Wouters E.F. Vos N. Janssen-Heininger Y.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35693-35700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In the present study we have investigated the role of TNF-R1 in the activation of JNK by H2O2. We demonstrate here that H2O2 signals to JNK via TNF-R1 and TRAF2 and that IKK and NF-κB activation are prevented as a result of degradation of the adaptor protein, RIP, and cleavage of its chaperone, Hsp90. Cell Culture and Reagents—A line of spontaneously transformed mouse alveolar type II epithelial cells (C10) was propagated in CRML-1066 medium containing 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 10% fetal bovine serum, all from Invitrogen. Murine recombinant TNFα was purchased from Calbiochem. The JNK, IKK, TRAF2, TRADD and Hsp90 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and TNF-R1 antibody was obtained from R&D Systems. Primary lung fibroblasts were isolated from C57BL/6 or TNF-R1–/– mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) by mincing lungs and propagation of explants in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 medium containing 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 10% fetal bovine serum, all from Invitrogen. p60Δ cytoplasmic domain plasmid was provided by Dr. Michael Lenardo (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) and Flag-TRAF2 by Dr. Brian Seed (Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA). NF-κB-luciferase and IκB-SR plasmids were provided by Dr. Patrick Baeuerle (Micromet, Martinsreid, Germany). CA-IKK was a kind gift from Dr. Michael Karin (University of California, San Diego), and glutathione S-transferase (GST)-IκB was provided by Dr. Rosa Ten (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN). Kinase Assays—Cells were exposed to the test agents and, at the indicated times, transferred to ice, washed once with cold PBS, and lysed as described elsewhere (8Korn S.H. Wouters E.F. Vos N. Janssen-Heininger Y.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35693-35700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm, 4 °C for 10 min. Protein concentrations were determined, and IKK or JNK was immunoprecipitated from 200 μg of protein with an IKKγ, JNK, or HA antibody (Santa Cruz) at 4 °C for 1.5 h using protein G-agarose beads (Invitrogen). For TNF-R1 immunoprecipitation and JNK kinase assay, TNF-R1 was immunoprecipitated from 700 μg of protein using an anti-TNF-R1 antibody from R&D Systems. Precipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer and once with kinase buffer (8Korn S.H. Wouters E.F. Vos N. Janssen-Heininger Y.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35693-35700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The kinase reaction was performed using 1 μg of GST-IκBα or GST-c-Jun as a substrate and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]adenosine triphosphate at 30 °C for 30 min. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 2× Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were boiled and stored at –20 °C. Proteins were separated on a 15% polyacrylamide gel. Gels were dried and examined by autoradiography. Transfection—Cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE-Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's directions. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—A fraction of lysates for analysis of adaptor protein expression or co-immunoprecipitation was added to 2× Laemmli sample buffer, boiled, and loaded on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Shuell), and membranes were subsequently blocked in 5% milk in tris-buffered saline (TBS). Levels of HA were detected with a monoclonal antibody (12CA5, Roche Applied Science). All other proteins were detected with antibodies from Santa Cruz according to the following protocol. Membranes blocked overnight in TBS/milk were washed two times for 15 min in TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated with the primary antibody for 1 h at 4 °C. Membranes were washed three times for 20 min in TBS/Tween 20 and incubated with a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 1 h at room temperature. After a 30-min wash with TBS/Tween 20, conjugated peroxidase was detected by ECL according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). For immunoprecipitations, cells were grown to confluence in 100-mm dishes, washed three times with PBS, and treated with test agents in PBS. Cells were lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA. 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% aprotinin), and lysates were incubated with TNF-R1 antibody for 2 h with rocking at 4 °C. After incubation with antibody, protein G-agarose beads (Invitrogen) were added for 1 h. Precipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer, and 2× Laemmli was added followed by boiling, loading onto a 10% polyacrylamide gel, and Western analysis. Assessment of NF-κB Transcriptional Activity—C10 cells were transiently transfected with a 6 κB-tk-luc plasmid containing 6 NFκB DNA elements and either TRAF2 or pCDNA3. Cells were treated with 1 ng/ml TNF for 4 h. Cells were lysed in Luciferase Assay Lysis Buffer (Promega, Madison, WI), and a luciferase assay was performed as previously described (8Korn S.H. Wouters E.F. Vos N. Janssen-Heininger Y.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35693-35700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). H2O2 Activates JNK in a TNF-R1-dependent Manner—We demonstrated previously that H2O2 causes activation of JNK in lung epithelial cells while inhibiting TNFα-induced activation of IKK (8Korn S.H. Wouters E.F. Vos N. Janssen-Heininger Y.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35693-35700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). To directly demonstrate that H2O2-induced JNK signaling is mediated by TNF-R1, lung fibroblasts were isolated from TNF-R1–/– mice, and JNK activation was assessed. The results shown in Fig. 1A demonstrate that the ability of H2O2 to activate JNK was substantially decreased in TNF-R1–/– cells compared with wild type controls at time points ranging from 15 min to 2 h. As expected, TNFα-induced activation of JNK was also abrogated in TNF-R1–/– fibroblasts. Additionally, overexpression of a truncated form of TNF-R1 (p60ΔCD), which lacks the intracellular death domain in C10 cells also resulted in inhibition of the TNFα- or H2O2-induced activation of JNK (Fig. 1B). These results demonstrate that H2O2-induced activation of JNK requires TNF-R1. Activation of JNK and IKK following TNF-R1 activation is coordinately regulated; the duration of JNK activation depends on the activity of NF-κB-dependent gene products such as XIAP, which associates with TNF-R1 to repress sustained JNK activity (25Tang G. Minemoto Y. Dibling B. Purcell N.H. Li Z. Karin M. Lin A. Nature. 2001; 414: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 26Tang F. Tang G. Xiang J. Dai Q. Rosner M.R. Lin A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 8571-8579Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In agreement with these findings, inhibition of NF-κB activity via the expression of a dominant acting version of IκB, IκB-SR, led to an augmented and sustained JNK activity profile after exposure to TNFα, illustrating the repression of JNK by NF-κB activation downstream of TNF-R1 in lung epithelial cells (Fig. 2A). To further support a role of TNF-R1 in JNK activation by H2O2, we addressed whether JNK activation by H2O2 could also be regulated by the NF-κB pathway. We therefore expressed a constitutively active version of IKKβ (CA-IKKβ), and assessed the ability of H2O2 or TNFα to activate JNK. Compared with vector controls, CA-IKKβ-expressing cells displayed attenuated JNK activation following treatment with H2O2 or TNFα (Fig. 2B), illustrating that JNK activation by H2O2 is also subject to negative regulation by NF-κB, analogous to JNK activation by TNFα. H2O2 Causes Recruitment of Adapter Proteins to TNF-R1— TNF-R1 is catalytically inactive and requires the recruitment of adaptor proteins to its intracellular domain in order to transmit signals (28Tartaglia L.A. Ayres T.M. Wong G.H. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1993; 74: 845-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). Upon ligand binding, the intracellular domain aggregates and the DD-containing protein, TRADD, is recruited to and binds to the DD of the receptor (23Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 81: 495-504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1738) Google Scholar). TRADD forms a platform for TRAF2 and RIP (29Rothe M. Wong S.C. Henzel W.J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1994; 78: 681-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar), which are required for JNK activation and the recruitment and activation of IKK (24Devin A. Cook A. Lin Y. Rodriguez Y. Kelliher M. Liu Z. Immunity. 2000; 12: 419-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether H2O2 also causes recruitment of TRADD and TRAF2 to TNF-R1. Endogenous TNF-R1 was immunoprecipitated, and TRADD and TRAF2 co-immunoprecipitation was evaluated by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 3A, TRADD co-precipitated with TNF-R1 in unstimulated cells and increased in response to TNFα or H2O2. Furthermore, in samples from TNFα- or H2O2-exposed cells post-immunoprecipitation, TRADD levels were decreased (Fig. 3B). TRAF2 also co-immunoprecipitated with TNF-R1 in control cells, increased following exposure to TNFα or H2O2 (Fig. 3C), and decreased in the post-immunoprecipitate lysates (Fig. 3D). Because it has been demonstrated that IKK is recruited to TNF-R1 (24Devin A. Cook A. Lin Y. Rodriguez Y. Kelliher M. Liu Z. Immunity. 2000; 12: 419-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), we next assessed whether JNK could also be recruited to TNF-R1 after incubation with TNFα or H2O2. As shown in Fig. 3E, JNK activity was present in the immunoprecipitated TNF-R1 and increased after exposure to TNFα or H2O2. Collectively, our findings suggest that TRADD, TRAF2, and JNK are associated with TNF-R1 in response to H2O2, and they support the role of TNF-R1 in the activation of JNK by H2O2. H2O2 Causes Degradation of RIP and Cleavage of Hsp90 — Despite the dependence of TNF-R1 in the H2O2-induced activation of JNK, H2O2 does not activate IKK or NF-κB (8Korn S.H. Wouters E.F. Vos N. Janssen-Heininger Y.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35693-35700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The activation of IKK by TNFα requires the recruitment of RIP and Hsp90 (30Chen G. Cao P. Goeddel D.V. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 401-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) to the TNF-R1 DD. Hsp90 and RIP form a complex; destabilization of Hsp90 leads to RIP degradation and consequently prevents the activation of IKK and NF-κB (31Lewis J. Devin A. Miller A. Lin Y. Rodriguez Y. Neckers L. Liu Z.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10519-10526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether the lack of IKK activation in cells treated with H2O2 was due to destabilization of RIP and/or Hsp90 and assessed the levels of TRAF2, RIP, and Hsp90 by Western blot analysis. As seen in Fig. 4A, TRAF2 levels were not affected by H2O2 or TNFα in a time frame of up to 2 h. Evaluation of Hsp90 revealed that a lower molecular weight species of Hsp90 was present after treatment with H2O2 for 2 h (Fig. 4B) and first appeared after 30 min of exposure (data not shown). This Hsp90 cleavage product did not appear in cells treated with TNFα (Fig. 4B). In agreement with these findings, RIP levels were markedly decreased in cells treated with H2O2 for 2 h, whereas TNFα exposure did not affect RIP expression compared with sham controls (Fig. 4C, and data not shown). Because RIP and Hsp90 are required for IKK activation, their destabilization by H2O2 provides a plausible explanation for the inability of H2O2 to activate IKK. Overexpression of TRAF2 Activates JNK and Inhibits the Ability of TNFα to Activate IKK and NF-κB—The results presented above demonstrate that in response to H2O2, TRADD and TRAF2 are recruited to the TNF-R1, whereas RIP and Hsp90, which are essential for IKK activation, are destabilized. The absence of RIP at TNF-R1 has been demonstrated to enhance recruitment of TRADD and TRAF2, suggesting a competition for binding at TNF-R1 between TRADD/TRAF2 and RIP (24Devin A. Cook A. Lin Y. Rodriguez Y. Kelliher M. Liu Z. Immunity. 2000; 12: 419-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Therefore, an enhanced presence of TRAF2 at TNF-R1 in response to H2O2 may sustain JNK activation while inhibiting IKK. To confirm that the effects of H2O2 in C10 cells can be mimicked by TRAF2 accumulation at the receptor, we overexpressed wild type TRAF2 and analyzed the activity of IKK, NF-κB, and JNK. TRAF2 overexpression was sufficient to inhibit the ability of TNFα to activate IKK and NF-κB (Fig. 5, A and B). Moreover, TRAF2 overexpression also led to activation of JNK under base-line conditions (Fig. 5C). Lastly, we determined whether H2O2-induced degradation of RIP and cleavage of Hsp90 would alter JNK and IKK activation in response to TNFα. As expected, pretreatment of C10 cells with H2O2 for 2 h, the time point associated with RIP degradation and Hsp90 cleavage (Fig. 4), led to a complete inhibition of IKK activation by TNFα. Although under these conditions JNK activation by H2O2 was no longer observed, pretreatment with H2O2 enhanced JNK activation in response to TNFα (Fig. 6). These data confirm that H2O2 causes a signaling imbalance at TNF-R1, leading to preferential activation of JNK, while inhibiting IKK.Fig. 6H2O2 disrupts TNFα-dependent signaling. Cells were exposed to 500 μm H2O2 for 2 h and then to 10 ng/ml TNFα for an additional 5 min (top panel) or 15 min (middle panel) for the assessment of IKK or JNK, respectively, via in vitro kinase assays. The bottom panel demonstrates JNK levels, as a loading control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although it has been established that H2O2 is a signaling molecule that can activate JNK (8Korn S.H.

Biol. 1999; 20: 942-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), the exact mechanism by which this occurs has not been elucidated. We demonstrate here that H2O2, in concentrations observed under inflammatory conditions (33Reeves E.P. Lu H. Jacobs H.L. Messina C.G. Bolsover S. Gabella G. Potma E.O. Warley A. Roes J. Segal A.W.

Med. 1990; 171: 2025-2041Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), activates JNK in a TNF-R1-dependent manner and, consequently that H2O2-induced JNK is substantially decreased in cells lacking TNF-R1 or in cells expressing a truncated version of TNF-R1 lacking the intracellular death domain. We also provided evidence for the presence of TRAF2 and TRADD at TNF-R1 under base-line conditions, in agreement with recent reports demonstrating that adaptor proteins can be present in nonstimulated cells (36Harper N. Hughes M. MacFarlane M. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25534-25541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). We were only able to detect small changes in the recruitment of endogenously expressed adaptor proteins to TNF-R1 after stimulation of the lung epithelial cells examined here, in agreement with findings by others (19Hayakawa M. Miyashita H. Sakamoto I. Kitagawa M. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. Karin M. Kikugawa K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3356-3366Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar) but in contrast to reports that use expression cassettes or immune cells (24Devin A. Cook A. Lin Y. Rodriguez Y. Kelliher M. Liu Z. Immunity. 2000; 12: 419-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Interestingly, analogous to observations demonstrating the presence of IKK at TNF-R1, we provide evidence here that JNK can also be recruited to and is active at TNF-R1. The H2O2-induced destabilization of RIP and cleavage of its chaperone Hsp90, both of which are essential in the activation of IKK, provide a plausible explanation for the selective activation of JNK, but not IKK, by H2O2. A similar disruption of adaptor protein recruitment to the death domain of TNF-R1 has been demonstrated in response to geldanamycin (GA), a disruptor of Hsp90, which leads to the destabilization of RIP and consequently inhibits the activation of IKK and NF-κB by TNFα (30Chen G. Cao P. Goeddel D.V. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 401-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 31Lewis J. Devin A. Miller A. Lin Y. Rodriguez Y. Neckers L. Liu Z.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10519-10526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). In agreement with our observations on H2O2, GA did not affect the stability of TRAF2 nor did it affect JNK activation. GA-induced RIP degradation involves the proteasome and appears to occur in a caspase- and lysosome-independent manner (31Lewis J. Devin A. Miller A. Lin Y. Rodriguez Y. Neckers L. Liu Z.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10519-10526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). It remains to be determined whether these events are also involved in RIP degradation by H2O2. It is of interest to note that GA brings about a disruption of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase, causing it to produce superoxide, the precursor of H2O2 (37Pritchard Jr., K.A. Ackerman A.W. Gross E.R. Stepp D.W. Shi Y. Fontana J.T. Baker J.E. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17621-17624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Thus, it is conceivable that H2O2 production may also contribute to RIP degradation and NF-κB repression after GA treatment (31Lewis J. Devin A. Miller A. Lin Y. Rodriguez Y. Neckers L. Liu Z.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10519-10526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), although this possibility remains to be tested formally. In cells overexpressing TRAF2, the ability of TNFα to activate IKK and NF-κB was inhibited, whereas JNK was constitutively active. In contrast to our observations, others have shown that TRAF2 overexpression leads to NF-κB activation (22Baud V. Karin M. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 372-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1367) Google Scholar, 38Song H.Y. Regnier C.H. Kirschning C.J. Goeddel D.V. Rothe M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9792-9796Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 39Takeuchi M. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. J. Biol.

Science. 1995; 269: 1424-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). The discrepancy of their findings compared with our study may stem from the cell type and experimental conditions used. For example, it is possible that IKK activation by TRAF2 was transient, as opposed to JNK, and that we missed its elevated activity, or that the levels of TRAF2 expression necessary to activate IKK and NF-κB are higher than those required for JNK activation. Alternatively, it is possible that expression levels and/or the localization of TNF-R family members (40Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1995; 269: 1424-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar), RIP, Hsp90, IKKγ, and MEKK1 (41Baud V. Liu Z.G. Bennett B. Suzuki N. Xia Y. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1297-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), can sustain NF-κB activation in response to TRAF2 overexpression in some, but not all, cell types. Findings demonstrating that in RIP–/– cells additional TRAF2 recruitment to TNF-R1 occurs (24Devin A. Cook A. Lin Y. Rodriguez Y. Kelliher M. Liu Z. Immunity. 2000; 12: 419-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) support the notion that a critical balance of RIP and TRAF2 at TNF-R1 is required to activate NF-κB. In agreement with these findings, the H2O2-induced destabilization of RIP and Hsp90 shown in the present study was also associated with the enhanced presence of TRAF2 at TNF-R1, as well as with prolonged activation of JNK. Sustained JNK activation by H2O2 is not observed in response to TNFα because of the NF-κB-dependent expression of anti-apoptotic genes, which are recruited to TNF-R1 and inhibit prolonged JNK activity and TNFα-induced apoptosis (21Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Korneluk R.G. Goeddel D.V. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2566) Google Scholar, 26Tang F. Tang G. Xiang J. Dai Q. Rosner M.R. Lin A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 8571-8579Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Conversely, overexpression of a constitutively active form of IKK resulted in an attenuation of H2O2-induced JNK activation, demonstrating that JNK activation by H2O2 is also subject to negative feedback regulation by NF-κB. It will be of interest to determine whether diminution of JNK activation as a result of NF-κB activation also represses oxidant-induced apoptosis, analogous to observations with TNFα. Although we recently demonstrated that H2O2 is capable of directly oxidizing IKK leading to its inactivation (8Korn S.H. Wouters E.F. Vos N. Janssen-Heininger Y.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35693-35700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), in the present study we have demonstrated that H2O2 can also inhibit TNFα-induced NF-κB activation upstream by interfering with the formation of the TNF-R1 signaling complex. It is plausible that H2O2 can affect binding of TNFα to its receptor or can promote its shedding. Recent observations demonstrate that redox events affect the binding of TNFα to TNF-R1 (19Hayakawa M. Miyashita H. Sakamoto I. Kitagawa M. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. Karin M. Kikugawa K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3356-3366Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), and H2O2-induced shedding of soluble TNF-R1 has been demonstrated in lung epithelial cells (42Hino T. Nakamura H. Abe S. Saito H. Inage M. Terashita K. Kato S. Tomoike H. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 20: 122-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, it is unlikely that these events have contributed to our present observations, as we have demonstrated that JNK activation by TNFα is enhanced in cells pretreated with H2O2 (Fig. 6), illustrating that TNFα is still able to induce signaling. The sites of H2O2-induced oxidation relevant to adaptor protein recruitment and degradation remain elusive. Cysteines present in the extracellular domain of TNF-R1 occur as disulfide bridges (43Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Janes W. Gentz R. Schoenfeld H.J. Broger C. Loetscher H. Lesslauer W. Cell. 1993; 73: 431-445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar) and therefore are unlikely targets for oxidation by H2O2. However, cysteines contained in the intracellular DD may be prone to oxidation by H2O2 and could promote receptor clustering and adaptor protein recruitment. Furthermore, oxidant-induced dissociation of thioredoxin from apoptosis signal-regulating kinase-1 promotes its activation and binding to TRAF2 (44Liu H. Nishitoh H. Ichijo H. Kyriakis J.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 2198-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar), providing an additional explanation by which H2O2 promotes TNF-R1-dependent signaling to JNK. It is not known at this time whether H2O2 acting through TNF-R1 is ligand-independent; however failure to activate IKK strongly suggests that H2O2 affects TNF-R1 function in a manner distinct from TNFα. The H2O2-induced signaling imbalance at TNF-R1 may have important ramifications for the cellular fate. It is well known that oxidant-induced JNK activation can mediate apoptosis (16Chen K. Vita J.A.

It is of interest to note that TNFα itself can alter the redox potential of the cell and uses oxidants to signal (for review, see Ref. 27Garg A.K. Aggarwal B.B. Mol. Immunol. 2002; 39: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that the extent of oxidant production, including H2O2, dictates whether TNF-R1 activation by TNFα will lead to cell death or survival. Our present findings point to a putative proapoptotic role for oxidants under inflammatory conditions by causing direct signaling through TNF-R1, in addition to promoting TNFα-induced apoptosis via c-Jun N-terminal kinase.

This reaction can be reproduced in vitro with an assay that utilizes two purified viral proteins, RNA polymerase 3Dpol and viral protein 3CDpro, synthetic VPg, UTP, and Mg2+. The template for the reaction is either poliovirus RNA or transcripts of a small RNA hairpin, termed cre(2C), located in the coding sequence of protein 2CATPase. The products of the reaction are VPgpU and VPgpUpU, the primers used by 3Dpol for RNA synthesis. With mutant template RNAs in this assay we determined the precise initiation site. Our results indicate that 1) 3Dpol does not possess strict specificity toward the nucleotide it links to VPg, 2) A-5 of the conserved 1GXXXAAAXXXXXXA14 sequence in the loop is the template nucleotide for the linkage of both the first and second UMPs to VPg, 3) VPgpUpU is synthesized by a “slide-back” mechanism, and 4) A-6 provides specificity to the reaction during the slide-back step and also modulates the uridylylation reaction. In additional experiments we determined the effect of mutations in the 5AAA7 sequence of cre(2C) on viral growth, RNA replication, and on the activity of the 2CATPase protein. Furthermore, we observed that the spacing between G-1 and A-5 and the size of the loop affect the yield but not the nature of the VPg-linked products.

Furthermore, we observed that the spacing between G-1 and A-5 and the size of the loop affect the yield but not the nature of the VPg-linked products. One of the mechanisms to initiate the replication of viral genomes involves the use of terminal proteins as primers for DNA or RNA synthesis (1Salas M. Miller J.T. Leis J. DePamphilis M.L. DePamphilis M.L. DNA Replication in Eukaryotic Cells. Cold Spring Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 131-176Google Scholar, 2Paul A.V. Semler B.L. Wimmer E. Molecular Biology of Picornaviruses. American Society for Microbiology, Washington D. C.2002: 227-246Google Scholar). In the genome these proteins are covalently attached to the 5′ end of the DNA/RNA strands. During the initiation step they provide the hydroxyl group required by the polymerase to start the synthesis of long chains. In this process the very first step is the linkage of a nucleotide to the hydroxyl group of an amino acid in the terminal protein catalyzed by the DNA/RNA polymerase. Interestingly, the same polymerases are also responsible for the elongation of DNA/RNA strands. Thus, these enzymes are structurally adapted for using either a protein or a nucleic acid primer.

The 5′-terminal U (UMP) of the RNA is covalently linked to the hydroxyl group of a tyrosine in the terminal protein VPg (5Ambros V Baltimore D. J. Biol.

First, it can elongate RNA chains on a suitable template (8Flanegan J.B. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 3677-3680Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar).

Melchers W.J.G. Slot H.J. Agol V.I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5428-5436Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In addition, an important RNA hairpin (cre(2C)) is located in the PV-coding sequence of protein 2CATPase (16Goodfellow I. Chaudhry Y. Richardson A. Meredith J. Almond J.W. Barclay W. Evans D.J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 4590-4600Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). This RNA element is similar in size and shape to rhinoviral cre elements such as HRV2 cre(2A) (17Gerber K. Wimmer E. Paul A.V.

All of these hairpins contain a conserved sequence of 1GXXXAAAXXXXXXA14 (19Yang Y. Rijnbrand R. McKnight K.L. Wimmer E. Paul A. Martin A. Lemon S.M. J.

Virol. 2003; 77: 5152-5166Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) either in one large loop or in a loop and a nearby bulge of the stem. Mutational analysis of this sequence indicated that the first two A residues of the 5AAA7 sequence are essential for viral viability, whereas changes in the other nucleotides resulted in growth defects (11Rieder E. Paul A.V. Kim D.W. van Boom J.H. Wimmer E. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 10371-10380Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 19Yang Y. Rijnbrand R. McKnight K.L. Wimmer E. Paul A. Martin A. Lemon S.M. J.

Using an in vitro assay system the function of these A residues has been recently identified for poliovirus (10Paul A.V. Rieder E Kim D.W. van Boom J.H. Wimmer E. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 10359-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 11Rieder E. Paul A.V. Kim D.W. van Boom J.H. Wimmer E. J.

Virol. 2002; 76: 7485-7494Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), as the template for the linkage of U to VPg and for the elongation of the resulting VPgpU precursor into VPgpUpU. The synthesis of VPgpUpU is catalyzed by 3Dpol and requires the presence of proteinase 3CDpro and either full-length viral RNA or transcripts of cre RNA (10Paul A.V. Rieder E Kim D.W. van Boom J.H. Wimmer E. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 10359-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar): VPg + 3Dpol + 3CDpro + UTP + viral RNA (or cre RNA) + Mg2+ → VPgpU + VPgpUpU. Because both plus- and minus-strand RNAs are VPg-linked in vivo (21Nomoto A. Detjen B. Pozzattti R. Wimmer E. Nature. 1977; 268: 208-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) it is generally accepted that VPgpUpU is the primer used by PV 3Dpol for the synthesis of both RNA strands. Recent studies suggest that the VPgpUpU made on the cre(2C) is used only for plus but not for minus strand RNA synthesis (22Murray K.E. Barton D.J. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 4739-4750Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 23Morasco J.B. Sharma N. Parilla J. Flanegan J.B. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 5136-5144Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). It remains to be shown how these precursors are translocated to the 3′ end of minus strands before plus-strand RNA synthesis. Although it is also not yet known where the VPg-linked precursors are made for minus-strand synthesis, the poly(A) tail has been proposed as a possible site (9Paul A.V. van Boom J.H. Filippov D. Wimmer E. Nature. 1998; 393: 280-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 22Murray K.E. Barton D.J. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 4739-4750Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 23Morasco J.B. Sharma N. Parilla J. Flanegan J.B. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 5136-5144Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Based on the polarity of the 5′-5AAA7-3′ sequence one would expect that A-6 is the template nucleotide for the linkage of U to VPg. However, our previous studies with an 6A→ C mutant of PV cre(2C) in the in vitro uridylylation reaction showed that the primary product was VPgpU, which was only poorly elongated to the dinucleotide stage (11Rieder E. Paul A.V. Kim D.W. van Boom J.H. Wimmer E. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 10371-10380Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). This observation suggested the possibility that A-5 rather than A-6 was the template nucleotide for the attachment of U to VPg. To determine the precise initiation site in the PV cre(2C) element we have carried out an extensive mutational analysis of the three As in the conserved 1GXXXAAAXXXXXXG14 sequence. We also included mutants of A-7 in these studies because this nucleotide is fully conserved in all of the known picornaviral RNA elements (16Goodfellow I. Chaudhry Y. Richardson A. Meredith J. Almond J.W. Barclay W. Evans D.J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 4590-4600Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 17Gerber K. Wimmer E. Paul A.V. J.

Virol. 2002; 76: 9686-9694Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To correlate the results of our in vitro experiments of VPg-uridylylation with in vivo studies we tested the effect of all of the 5AAA7 cre mutations on viral growth, RNA replication, and 2CATPase function. Transcripts of wt and mutant cre RNAs were then used as template in the in vitro reaction with α-32P-labeled UTP, ATP, CTP, or GTP as nucleotide donors. This approach allowed us to establish that A-5 is the template nucleotide directing the linkage of both the first and second U to VPg, whereas A-6 provides specificity to the reaction. In addition, A-6 and to a small extent also A-7 modulate the VPg-uridylylation step and affect the yield of product. These results are consistent with a slide-back mechanism for the synthesis VPgpUpU, which is similar to the mechanism used by viral DNA polymerases such as that of adenovirus (26King A.J. van der Vliet P.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5786-5792Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and phages Φ29 (27Mendez J. Blanco L. Esteban J.A. Bernad A. Salas M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1996; 260: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) that catalyze protein-primed DNA synthesis. Furthermore, we investigated other aspects of the mechanism of VPg-uridylylation and determined that 1) the fact that the synthesis of VPgpUpU on cre(2C) is aborted at the dinucleotide stage is most likely not due to RNA sequence/structure, 2) the spacing between G-1 and A-5 in the conserved motif of entero- and rhinoviral cre is essential for optimal cre function, 3) a small loop size (5 nt) is detrimental for VPg-uridylylation, but the relocation of A-5 from the loop to the top of the stem does not significantly interfere with cre function.

RNA Transfection and Plaque Assays—RNA transcripts were transfected into HeLa R19 cells with the DEAE-dextran method, and virus titers were determined by plaque assays on HeLa R19 monolayers (33Molla A. Paul A.V. Wimmer E. Science. 1991; 254: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Reverse Transcription (RT)/PCR—Single plaques isolated from virus stocks were grown in HeLa R19 cells. The total cellular RNA was isolated and subjected to RT/PCR using a kit from Invitrogen (Superscript™ first strand synthesis system). Rescue of Mutant cre(2C) in a Dual-cre Poliovirus—RNA derived from the parental dual-cre poliovirus pPV(5A→ C)/PVwt(S) (Fig. 1B) or its mutant derivatives were transfected into HeLa R19 cells. Their growth was monitored by the appearance of CPE, and the genotypes of the resulting viruses were determined by DNA sequencing after RT/PCR. PV RNA Replication Assays—The replication of poliovirus RNA was assayed by measurement of luciferase expression in HeLa R19 cells transfected with RNA derived from the parental pP/L(5A→ C)/PVwt(N) plasmid (Fig. 1C) or its mutant derivatives. Luciferase assays were carried out as described before (20Yin J. Paul A.V. Wimmer E. Rieder E. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 5152-5166Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Computer-based Prediction of RNA Structures—RNA secondary structure was predicted by using the MFOLD program designed by M. Zucker (www.bioinfo.rpi.edu/applications/mfold). Effect of Nucleotide Substitutions in the 5AAA7 Sequence of cre(2C) Elements on Replication Phenotypes—Based on mutational analyses of the HRV14cre(VP1) (19Yang Y. Rijnbrand R. McKnight K.L. Wimmer E. Paul A. Martin A. Lemon S.M. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 7485-7494Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and poliovirus cre(2C) (20Yin J. Paul A.V. Wimmer E. Rieder E. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 5152-5166Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and in comparison with other known (17Gerber K. Wimmer E. Paul A.V. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 10979-10990Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) or putative entero- and rhinovirus cre elements, a common 1RXXXAARXXXXXXR14 motif has been proposed that is essential for VPg uridylylation in vitro. For poliovirus this motif is 1GXXXAAAXXXXXXA14 (Fig. 1A) in which the 5AAA7 triplet is likely to serve as template for VPg-uridylylation (10Paul A.V. Rieder E Kim D.W. van Boom J.H. Wimmer E. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 10359-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 11Rieder E. Paul A.V. Kim D.W. van Boom J.H. Wimmer E. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 10371-10380Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). To decipher the mechanism of this reaction, we carried out a complete mutational analysis involving every other possible base substitution of the three consecutive adenosine residues and analyzed their effect in the context of viral genomes, dual-cre viral genomes, or luciferase-expressing dual-cre replicons. The results of these experiments are summarized in Fig. 2. With one exception (7A→ G) all nucleotide substitutions lead to a change in the amino acid sequence of 2CATPase (Fig. 2, column B). The mutation 5A→ U introduces a termination codon (Fig. 2, column B) and, thus, has been analyzed only with a replicon (see “Results”). Virus growth (Fig. 2, column C) could be impaired not only by reduced uridylylation per se but by imperfect proteolytic processing of the polyprotein or by debilitated 2CATPase function. Impaired protein synthesis is highly unlikely since the full-length transcript RNAs of wt and mutated plasmid cDNAs yielded nearly identical translation and processing patterns in the HeLa cell-free translation system of Molla et al. (33Molla A. Paul A.V. Wimmer E. Science. 1991; 254: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) (data not shown). The possibility of impaired 2CATPase function will be addressed later. As shown in Fig. 2, column C, nearly all of the mutations lead to replication phenotypes. The most severe is the 5A→ C substitution, which we consider lethal because we have never been able to isolate revertants. 2A. V. Paul, E. Rieder, J. Yin, and E. Wimmer, unpublished results. Four of the mutations led to a quasi-infectious phenotype; that is, all progeny virus carried reversions to the wt sequence. Two mutations, 7A→ C and 7A→ U, although not quasi-infectious, severely debilitated viral replication. Whereas wt transcripts produce CPE 20–24 h after transfection, CPE with the 7A→ C and 7A→ U mutants was delayed to 42 and 72 h, respectively. The plaque size of the resulting viruses was about half that of the wt virus (data not shown). The progeny of the transfections already contained revertants (Fig. 2, column C). Importantly, all reversions produced only the wt sequence. Repressor mutations have not been scored in our experiments. To separate cre function from the function of 2CATPase, we repeated the analysis with a dual-cre viral genome, as described previously (20Yin J. Paul A.V. Wimmer E. Rieder E. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 5152-5166Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In this genome, a second cre element was inserted into the open reading frame between P1 and P2 (Fig. 1B), and the extra cre-specific amino acid sequence was cleaved out by 2Apro (20Yin J. Paul A.V. Wimmer E. Rieder E. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 5152-5166Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The genomes that we have analyzed, therefore, contain an endogenous cre with mutations as indicated in Fig. 2, column A, and a wt cre(2C) in the SacI site (Fig. 1B). The replication phenotypes of these viral genomes is summarized in Fig. 2, column D. Our results indicate that the positively charged lysine encoded by the 5AAA7 sequence can be functionally fully replaced in the 2CATPase protein by either a Gln or a Glu and to a smaller extent by Asn. The other substitutions appear to exert a detrimental effect. These data indicate that the lethal growth phenotype of the 5A→ C mutant is not related to a defect in 2CATPase function, and therefore, A-5 of the conserved uridylylation motif is important for cre function. The result that the lethal 5A→ C mutation can be fully complemented in a dual-cre genome (20Yin J. Paul A.V. Wimmer E. Rieder E. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 5152-5166Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) has allowed us to analyze the effect of mutations in the 5AAA7 triplet directly on RNA synthesis. For this purpose, we have made use of a dual-cre PV replicon carrying a luciferase gene (Fig. 1C). The endogenous cre(2C) in this replicon was inactivated by the 5A→ C mutation, and a second cre was inserted at a NheI site into the 5′-NTR of the genome (Fig. 1C, Ref. 20Yin J. Paul A.V. Wimmer E. Rieder E. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 5152-5166Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This second cre element that is highly efficient in intragenomic complementation of the inactivated endogenous cre(2C) (20Yin J. Paul A.V. Wimmer E. Rieder E. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 5152-5166Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) was then mutated as depicted in Fig. 2, column A. RNAs were transcribed from the corresponding plasmid DNAs and transfected into HeLa cells, and luciferase activity was monitored as a measure of RNA replication (20Yin J. Paul A.V. Wimmer E. Rieder E. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 5152-5166Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The data, expressed as % of wt luciferase activity, are shown in Fig. 2, column E. It is evident that none of the second cre elements carrying a mutation in A-5 or A-6 was able to rescue the endogenous, inactivated 5A→ C cre(2C). Mutations in A-7, on the other hand, could still rescue the debilitated endogenous cre(2C), although to different extents. These results indicate an essential role for A-5 and A-6 and a less important role for A-7 of the 1GXXXAAAXXXXXXA14 motif in cre(2C) function. A-5 Is the Template Nucleotide for the Linkage of Uridylic Acid to VPg—Genetic studies and in vitro uridylylation assays with 5A→ C and 6A→ C cre(2C) variants suggest that the 5AA6 dinucleotide serves as template for VPgpUpU synthesis (11Rieder E. Paul A.V. Kim D.W. van Boom J.H. Wimmer E. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 10371-10380Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Based on the polarity of the 5′-5AAA7-3′ sequence, we expected that A-6 is the nucleotide in the template for the linkage of U to VPg followed by reading A-5 to elongate VPgpU into VPgpUpU. To determine the precise initiation site we adapted a method from studies of DNA polymerases, which catalyze protein-primed DNA synthesis. Although the terminal protein in the genomes of these viruses is always linked to a single type of nucleotide, these DNA polymerases"

Sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1) is a key transcription factor to induce postprandial hypertriglyceridemia. We found that insulin-resistant rats fed a diet high in fructose showed an increased proteintyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) content with strong expression of SREBP-1 mRNA in the liver. To clarify the association of PTP1B with SREBP-1 gene expression, we overexpressed PTP1B in rat hepatocytes, which led to increased mRNA content and promoter activity of SREBP-1a and -1c, resulting in the increased mRNA expression of fatty-acid synthase, one of the SREBP-1-responsive lipogenic genes. Because PTP1B overexpression increased phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity, we inhibited PP2A activity by expression of its selective inhibitor, SV40 small t antigen and found that this normalized the PTP1B-enhanced SREBP-1a and -1c mRNA expressions through activation of the Sp1 site. These results indicate that PTP1B may regulate gene expression of SREBP-1 via enhancement of PP2A activity, thus mediating hepatic lipogenesis and postprandial hypertriglyceridemia. We demonstrate here a unique serial activation of the PTP1B-PP2A axis as a novel mechanism for the regulation of gene expression in the biosynthesis of triglyceride.

The insulin resistance/metabolic syndrome is characterized by the variable coexistence of hyperinsulinemia, hyperlipidemia, obesity, and hypertension. Many individuals with obesity and insulin resistance suffer from fatty liver (steatohepatosis). Like hyperglycemia, postprandial (diet-induced) hypertriglyceridemia is thought to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of the insulin resistance/metabolic syndrome. Several lines of evidence indicate that fatty liver in insulinresistant states is caused by activation of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1c, 1The abbreviations used are: SREBP-1, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1; C/S, Cys215/Ser215; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; Erk, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; IRS, insulin receptor substrate; PP2A, protein phosphatase 2A; PTP1B, proteintyrosine phosphatase 1B; ST, SV40 small t antigen; WT, wild type. which is elevated in response to high insulin levels (1Horton J.D.

Lipid Res. 2001; 40: 439-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Although insulin resistance is present in peripheral tissues, compensatory hyperinsulinemia is postulated to persistently activate SREBP-1c transcription and cleavage, which increases lipogenic gene expression, enhances fatty acid synthesis, and accelerates triglyceride accumulation in the liver in obese insulin-resistant mice (3Shimomura I.

However, the reason that expression of hepatic SREBP-1c mRNA remains high in insulin-resistant states is little understood. We have reported that high fructose feeding causes insulin resistance with increased hepatic SREBP-1 mRNA content (6Nagai Y. Nishio Y. Nakamura T. Maegawa H. Kikkawa R. Kashiwagi A. Am. J. Physiol.. 2002; 282: E1180-E1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), and we recently found that, as reported (7Taghibiglou C. Rashid-Kolvear F. Van Iderstine S.C. Le-Tien H. Fantus I.G. Lewis G.F. Adeli K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 793-803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) abundance is also increased in the liver. PTP1B is a major regulator of insulin sensitivity and body fat content, and deletion of its gene leads to augmented insulin sensitivity and resistance to obesity induced by high fat feeding (8Cheng A.

Moreover, at least one genetic polymorphism of PTP1B is associated with several features of the insulin resistance/metabolic syndrome (12Di Paola R. Frittitta L. Miscio G. Bozzali M. Baratta R. Centra M. Spampinato D. Santagati M.G. Ercolino T. Cisternino C. Soccio T. Mastroianno S. Tassi V. Almgren P. Pizzuti A. Vigneri R. Trischitta V. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2002; 70: 806-812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). We reported that overexpression of PTP1B in both liver and muscle cells led to insulin resistance (13Egawa K. Maegawa H. Shimizu S. Morino K. Nishio Y. Bryer-Ash M. Cheung A.T. Kolls J.K. Kikkawa R. Kashiwagi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10207-10211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In high fructose-fed rats, overexpression of PTP1B may induce hepatic insulin resistance. However, high mRNA expression of SREBP-1 still continues in these rats. Although the magnitude of hyperinsulinemia is relatively less than that in fatless mice (3Shimomura I. Bashmakov Y. Horton J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30028-30032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar), it is not known why overexpression of PTP1B fails to suppress insulin-induced SREBP-1 mRNA expression in high fructose-fed rats. Alternatively, it is possible that there may be another mechanism for the continued strong expression of hepatic SREBP-1c mRNA in insulinresistant states. The coexistent strong hepatic expression of PTP1B and SREBP-1 in high fructose-fed rats led us to postulate that PTP1B may regulate SREBP-1 gene expression. To clarify this issue, in the present study we examined the effect of PTP1B overexpression on SREBP-1 gene expression in rat hepatocytes. We found that PTP1B may enhance SREBP-1 gene expression by up-regulating Sp1 transcriptional activity via an increase in protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity, as a distinct mechanism of insulin resistance.

Cell. 1993; 75: 887-897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). PP2A exists primarily as a heterotrimer composed of a catalytic subunit (C), a scaffolding subunit (A), and one of a variety of regulatory subunits (B). The C subunit is always associated with the A subunit. A number of variable B subunits can bind to this dimeric core, and these B subunits affect enzymatic activity and substrate specificity of PP2A. Small t antigen is known to specifically inhibit PP2A by binding to the A regulatory subunit, interfering with the ability of PP2A to bind to B subunits that determine its cellular substrates (15Sontag E.

High Fructose Feeding—Six-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats (Japan SLC, Shizuoka, Japan) were housed in an environmentally controlled room with a 12-h light/dark cycle. The animals were divided into a normal diet (control) and a diet high in fructose. The rats of each group were fed for 8 weeks. The normal diet (Oriental Yeast, Tokyo, Japan) consisted of 58% carbohydrate (no fructose), 12% fat, and 30% protein (energy percent of diet). The diet high in fructose (oriental yeast) contained 67% carbohydrate (98% of which was fructose), 13% fat, and 20% protein as described (6Nagai Y. Nishio Y. Nakamura T. Maegawa H. Kikkawa R.

The day before the experiment, food was withdrawn from all animals at 8 p.m. Rats were re-fed in the dark from 6 to 8 a.m., and then the diet was removed again. After 4 h of food deprivation, rats were anesthetized, and the livers were removed, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C until use. RNA and protein were extracted from the frozen samples. Plasma glucose, triglyceride, and insulin levels were determined as described (6Nagai Y. Nishio Y. Nakamura T. Maegawa H. Kikkawa R.

Cells were plated on 100-mm rat collagen dishes (Asahi Techno Glass, Chiba, Japan) and cultured in William's E medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1 nm insulin, 100 nm triiodothyronine, 100 nm dexamethasone, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (6Nagai Y.

Kahn (Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston), were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Western Blotting—Each liver was homogenized in a solubilizing buffer containing 20 mm Tris, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 50 mm NaF (pH 7.5) for 30 min at 4 °C. The tissue lysates were centrifuged to remove insoluble materials. Each sample (20 μg protein/lane) was denatured by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The gels were transferred to nitrocellulose by electroblotting in Towbin buffer containing 0.02% SDS and 20% methanol. Membranes were blocked and probed with specified antibodies. Blots were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked second antibody followed by chemiluminescence detection as described (13Egawa K. Maegawa H. Shimizu S. Morino K. Nishio Y. Bryer-Ash M.

Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen), and 20-μg RNA samples were run on a 1% agarose gel containing formaldehyde and transferred to a nylon membrane (Nytran N, Schleicher & Schuell). The cDNA probes were generated by reverse transcriptase-PCR amplification from total RNA isolated from the rat liver as reported (6Nagai Y. Nishio Y. Nakamura T. Maegawa H. Kikkawa R. Kashiwagi A.

Each cDNA probe labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with a labeling kit (Takara, Shiga, Japan) was hybridized to UV cross-linked blots overnight at 68 °C in the hybridization buffer Perfecthyb (Toyobo, Tokyo) and washed at 68 °C for 40 min with 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS. The blots were exposed to Kodak Biomax MR film at –80 °C. The signal was quantified with a densitometer, and loading differences were normalized to the signal generated with a probe for 18 S ribosomal RNA. RNase Protection Assay—SREBP-1 mRNA is produced from a single gene through the use of alternative transcription start sites that produce alternate forms of exon 1, designated 1a and 1c (1Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 1125-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (3838) Google Scholar). Thus, the amount of SREBP-1a and SREBP-1c mRNA was assessed by RNase protection assay according to the method of Shimomura et al. (16Shimomura I. Bashmakov Y. Ikemoto S. Horton J.D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13656-13661Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Aliquots of total RNA (10 μg) from each sample were incubated with the SREBP-1 cRNA probe or with a cRNA probe for the mRNA of β-actin. After digestion with RNase A/T1, protected fragments corresponding to SREBP-1a and SREBP-1c were quantified. Measurement of Luciferase Reporter Gene Activity—The 5′-flanking region of rat Srebp-1c was amplified by PCR using rat genomic DNA (17Deng X. Cagen L.M. Wilcox H.G. Park E.A. Raghow R. Elam M.B.

The resultant PCR product was inserted upstream of the luciferase gene in the pGL3-basic reporter vector (Promega, Madison, WI) to form pGL3-SREBP-1c (0.4 kb). A fragment composed of –0.9 kb of a human SREBP-1a gene promoter was made by PCR using primer (18Miserez A.R. Cao G. Probst L.C. Hobbs H.H. Genomics. 1997; 40: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and inserted upstream of the luciferase gene in the pGL3-basic reporter vector to form pGL3-SREBP-1a (0.9 kb). For the luciferase reporter gene assay, transient transfection into Fao hepatoma cells was performed with SuperFECT in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Expression plasmids for WT, mutated PTP1B, small t antigen, or control vector without insert were cotransfected with the reporter plasmid and pRL-TK. Luciferase activity was assayed using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System as described (19Sekine O. Nishio Y. Egawa K. Nakamura T. Maegawa H. Kashiwagi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36631-36639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). PP2A Phosphatase Activity—Phosphatase activity was measured using para-nitrophenyl phosphate as a substrate as described (20Ugi S. Imamura T. Ricketts W. Olefsky J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2375-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Briefly, starved rat hepatocytes were stimulated with 100 ng/ml insulin for 30 min at 37 °C and lysed. Clarified supernatants were incubated with anti-PP2A antibody and protein G-agarose for 2 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed and incubated with 900 μg/ml para-nitrophenyl phosphate for 30 min at 30 °C. The amount of para-nitrophenol produced was determined by measuring the absorbance at 405 nm. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—EMSA was performed using radiolabeling double-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to the Sp1 consensus sequence (Promega). The protein-DNA binding reaction was performed at room temperature for 20 min in a volume of 20 μl. The reaction mixture contained 5 mg of nuclear protein extract, 1 mg of poly(dI:dC), 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 60 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 7% glycerol, and 100,000 cpm labeled probe. After the incubation, samples were loaded onto 5% polyacrylamide gels in 0.25 mm Tris borate-EDTA buffer and run at 150 V for 1.5 h. The gels were dried, and the bands were visualized by autoradiography. For competition assay, nonlabeled oligonucleotides were added at a 50-fold molar excess to the reaction mixture before the addition of nuclear extract protein as described (19Sekine O. Nishio Y. Egawa K. Nakamura T. Maegawa H. Kashiwagi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36631-36639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Generation of Mutant SREBP-1a and SREBP-1c Promoter—The putative Sp1 binding site in the proximal promoter region of human SREBP-1a gene was mutated using the oligonucleotides 5′-CTCTCTCAAGGTGttGCGGGGCCGTCTATCTG-3′ and 5′-GTCTATCTGCCGGGGCGttGTGGAACTCTCTC-3′ as primers in the in vitro mutagenesis reaction. The putative Sp1 binding site in the proximal promoter region of rat Srebp-1c gene was also mutated using the oligonucleotides 5′-CACCCGAGGGGCGGttCACGGGGGCGCTTC-3′ and 5′-CTTCGCGGGGGCACtt GGCGGGGAGCCCAC-3′ as primers. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as means ± S.E. of four separate experiments unless stated otherwise. Scheffe's multiple comparison test was used to determine the significance of any differences among more than three groups. p < 0.05 was considered significant. Coexistence of High Expression of PTP1B and SREBP-1 mRNA in the Liver of High Fructose-fed Rats—High fructose feeding for 8 weeks induced postprandial hyperinsulinemia and hypertriglyceridemia in rats as reported previously (6Nagai Y. Nishio Y. Nakamura T. Maegawa H. Kikkawa R. Kashiwagi A. Am. J. Physiol.. 2002; 282: E1180-E1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). These rats also revealed several characteristic features of the insulin resistance/metabolic syndrome. Moreover, we found the coexistence of high expression of PTP1B and SREBP-1 mRNA in the liver (Fig. 1). Overexpression of PTP1B Enhances SREBP-1 mRNA but Impairs Insulin Signaling in Isolated Rat Hepatocytes—We next examined the effect of PTP1B overexpression on both SREBP-1 mRNA expression and insulin signaling in isolated hepatocytes by the adenovirus-mediated gene transfer technique. PTP1B overexpression markedly enhanced SREBP-1 mRNA expression to a level comparable with that seen after insulin stimulation alone. We did not observe any synergic effect of PTP1B on insulin-stimulated SREBP-1 mRNA expression. Furthermore, mRNA expression of fatty-acid synthase, one of the SREBP-1-responsive lipogenic genes, was also increased (Fig. 2a). On the other hand, overexpression of PTP1B led to decreased insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrates 1 and 2 (IRS-1 and IRS-2), as shown in Fig. 2b. The insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt and Erk was also attenuated in cells overexpressing PTP1B (Fig. 2b). Thus, PTP1B regulates “off”-signaling of insulin action in hepatocytes, as is also reported to occur in Fao hepatoma cells, L6 myocytes, and 3T3-L1 adipocytes (13Egawa K. Maegawa H. Shimizu S. Morino K. Nishio Y. Bryer-Ash M. Cheung A.T. Kolls J.K. Kikkawa R. Kashiwagi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10207-10211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 21Shimizu S.

Effect of PTP1B Overexpression on SREBP-1 Gene Expression in Rat Hepatocytes—Although insulin signaling was inhibited by overexpression of PTP1B, its overexpression markedly enhanced SREBP-1 mRNA expression. This PTP1B effect was mediated by tyrosine-phosphatase activity, because a phosphatase-defective PTP1B C/S mutant had no such effect (Fig. 3a). PTP1B overexpression enhanced SREBP-1 mRNA expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner (data not shown). Although insulin selectively increases SREBP-1c mRNA expression (16Shimomura I. Bashmakov Y. Ikemoto S. Horton J.D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13656-13661Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar), RNase protection assay revealed that PTP1B increased the mRNA contents of both SREBP-1a and -1c in rat hepatocytes (Fig. 3b). Consistently, PTP1B overexpression increased transcriptional activities of both SREBP-1a and SREBP-1c promoter-luciferase constructs, but a phosphatase-defective PTP1B C/S mutant was without effect (Fig. 3, c and d). These results indicate that tyrosine phosphatase activity is required for up-regulation of SREBP-1 expression. Identical findings were also observed in Fao hepatoma cells. PTP1B and Activation of SREBP-1 Expression in Rat Hepatocytes—To clarify the molecular mechanism for PTP1B-induced SREBP-1 gene expression, we selected as a candidate molecule, protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which is activated by dephosphorylation of the tyrosine residue and might regulate SREBP-1 gene expression, because catalytic A subunit of PP2A is inactivated by in vitro phosphorylation of Tyr307 by receptor tyrosine kinases (22Chen J. Parsons S. Brautigan D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7957-7962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesized that PP2A would be activated by tyrosine dephosphorylation when PTP1B is overexpressed. In fact, we found that PTP1B overexpression enhanced PP2A activity in a dose-dependent manner, whereas a phosphatase-defective PTP1B C/S mutant had no such effect (Fig. 4a). Furthermore, we confirmed that overexpression of SV40 small t antigen (ST), a selective inhibitor of PP2A (15Sontag E. Fedorov S. Kamibayashi C. Robbins D. Cobb M. Mumby M. Cell. 1993; 75: 887-897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 20Ugi S. Imamura T. Ricketts W. Olefsky J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2375-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), inhibited PP2A activity in hepatocytes (Fig. 4a). Moreover, co-transfection of ST and PTP1B gene blocked the PTP1B-induced increase in SREBP-1 mRNA expression in hepatocytes (Fig. 4b). To further confirm the association of PP2A activity with SREBP-1 expression, we co-transfected ST and PTP1B genes into hepatocytes and found that the increases in PTP1B-induced SREBP-1a and -1c promoter activities were inhibited (Fig. 4, c and d). These results indicate that PTP1B enhances the activity of the SREBP-1 promoter through increased PP2A activity. PTP1B/PP2A Signaling Is Required for Activation of Sp1 Promoter Activities of SREBP-1 Gene—In EMSA, we found that PTP1B overexpression markedly increased nuclear Sp1 binding in both the basal and insulin-stimulated states (Fig. 5a). When the Sp1 binding sites in the SREBP-1a and -1c promoters were mutated from GCGGGG to GCGGTT by in vitro mutagenesis, we were unable to detect any stimulation of SREBP-1a and -1c promoter activities by PTP1B overexpression in hepatocytes (Fig. 5b). It is clear that these sites are important for the PTP1B effect on the regulation of the activities of SREBP-1a and -1c promoters (2Shimano H. Prog. Lipid Res. 2001; 40: 439-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 17Deng X. Cagen L.M. Wilcox H.G. Park E.A. Raghow R. Elam M.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Thus, we conclude that activated PP2A may enhance Sp1 transcriptional activity when PTP1B is overexpressed. These results indicate that PTP1B enhances the activity of the SREBP-1 promoter by modulating Sp1 transcriptional activity through increased PP2A activity. PTP1B is a major negative regulator of insulin signal transduction and is associated with the development of insulin resistance (13Egawa K. Maegawa H. Shimizu S. Morino K. Nishio Y. Bryer-Ash M.

Furthermore, we and others have observed that hyperinsulinemia as well as increased carbohydrate intake stimulate its gene expression (6Nagai Y. Nishio Y. Nakamura T. Maegawa H. Kikkawa R.

(Tokyo). 1998; 123: 813-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Moreover, we observed that hepatic PTP1B content was increased by 3-fold in high fructose-fed rats and that exposure of isolated hepatocytes to 25 mm fructose for 8 h led to doubled PTP1B mRNA content (data not shown). Thus, a vicious metabolic cycle may be initiated, in which PTP1B plays a key role. A mouse model lacking PTP1B consistently exhibited augmented insulin sensitivity and was resistant to the development of obesity induced by high fat feeding (10Elchebly M. Payette P. Michaliszyn E. Cromlish W. Collins S. Loy A.L. Normandin D. Cheng A. Himms-Hagen J. Chan C.C. Ramachandran C. Gresser M.J. Tremblay M.L. Kennedy B.P.

Stricker-Krongrad A. Shulman G.I. Neel B.G. Kahn B.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5479-5489Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). Therefore, PTP1B is postulated to be an important therapeutic target to reduce insulin resistance (9Johnson T.O. Ermolieff J. Jirousek M.R. Nat. Rev. Drug. Discov. 2002; 1: 696-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar) as well as resistance to diet-induced obesity. Postprandial (diet-induced) hypertriglyceridemia is thought to be a central feature of the insulin resistance/metabolic syndrome, and enhanced expression of SREBP-1c mRNA is responsible in part for these abnormalities (1Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 1125-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (3838) Google Scholar, 2Shimano H. Prog. Lipid Res. 2001; 40: 439-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). In insulinresistant fatless mice, IRS-2 protein has been shown to be diminished, but SREBP-1 expression is continuously activated (4Shimomura I. Matsuda M. Hammer R.E. Bashmakov Y. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 77-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Thus, despite the presence of insulin resistance in both the peripheral tissues and liver in these mice, the compensatory hyperinsulinemia maintains a high level of SREBP-1c gene transcription (3Shimomura I. Bashmakov Y. Horton J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30028-30032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar, 4Shimomura I. Matsuda M. Hammer R.E. Bashmakov Y. Brown M.S.

Therefore, there may be another mechanism for the continued strong expression of hepatic SREBP-1c mRNA in insulin-resistant mice. We found coexistent strong expression of PTP1B and SREBP-1 in rats that were insulin-resistant by a high fructose diet. Overexpression of PTP1B protein has been also observed in insulin-resistant db/db mice, and treatment with antisense PTP1B in db/db mice has been reported to improve hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia (27Zinker B.A. Rondinone C.M. Trevillyan J.M. Gum R.J. Clampit J.E. Waring J.F. Xie N. Wilcox D. Jacobson P. Frost L. Kroeger P.E. Reilly R.M. Koterski S. Opgenorth T.J. Ulrich R.G. Crosby S. Butler M. Murray S.F. McKay R.A.

Furthermore, this antisense treatment in ob/ob mice also ameliorates adiposity and attenuates increased lipogenic gene expression in adipose tissue (28Rondinone C.M. Trevillyan J.M. Clampit J. Gum R.J. Berg C. Kroeger P. Frost L. Zinker B.A. Reilly R. Ulrich R. Butler M. Monia B.P. Jirousek M.R. Waring J.F. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2405-2411Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). However, in the study, it is unclear whether the effect of PTP1B inhibition on SREBP-1 expression was mediated by a direct interaction or mediated by improvements of hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia. We hypothesized that PTP1B might directly regulate SREBP-1 gene expression and modulate hepatic lipogenesis in insulin-resistant states. In the current study, we found that overexpression of PTP1B directly enhanced SREBP-1 gene expression, revealing a new aspect of PTP1B action. Furthermore, we propose a unique new molecular mechanism for the activation of SREBP-1 gene expression through activation of PP2A by PTP1B overexpression. Phosphorylation of the tyrosine residue of PP2A was found to decrease its enzymatic activity in an in vitro experiment (22Chen J. Parsons S. Brautigan D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7957-7962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that dephosphorylation of PP2A may stimulate its phosphatase activity. In the present study, we have demonstrated that PTP1B increases PP2A activity, resulting in increased activity of the SREBP-1 promoter. Furthermore, overexpression of ST, a specific inhibitor of PP2A, blocks the effect of PTP1B on SREBP-1 gene expression by inhibiting PP2A activity. These results indicate that PTP1B activates SREBP-1 gene expression via increased PP2A activity. The Sp1 sites are located at about the –90 bp region of the SREBP-1a and -1c promoters and are thought to be important sites in the regulation of its gene expression (2Shimano H. Prog. Lipid Res. 2001; 40: 439-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 17Deng X. Cagen L.M. Wilcox H.G. Park E.A. Raghow R. Elam M.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

In the current study, a defective mutation of the Sp1 binding sites in SREBP-1a and -1c promoters led to the cancellation of PTP1B effect on its promoter activity (Fig. 5b). These results indicate that the Sp1 site is important for the PTP1B effect on SREBP-1 gene expression. With regard to the regulation of Sp1 transcriptional activity (29Black A.R. Black J.D. Azizkhan-Clifford J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 188: 143-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar, 30Samson S.L. Wong N.C. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 29: 265-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), increased Sp1 glycosylation is responsible for increased gene expression in hyperglycemic condition by an enhanced hexosamine pathway (31Du X.L. Edelstein D. Rossetti L. Fantus I.G. Goldberg H. Ziyadeh F. Wu J. Brownlee M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12222-12226Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). However, we did not observe increased glycosylation of Sp1 protein in PTP1B-overexpressed cells (data not shown). PP2A is known to activate Sp1 transcriptional activity in nonhepatic cultured cells (32Lacroix I. Lipcey C. Imbert J. Kahn-Perles B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9598-9605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). SREBP-1 promoter activities were well correlated with PP2A activities. Thus, it is possible that PTP1B may activate SREBP-1 gene expression by enhancing Sp1 transcriptional activity via increased PP2A activity. It has been reported that PP2A dephosphorylates Sp1 protein and increases DNA binding. However, the dephosphorylation site(s) of Sp1 by PP2A has not been determined (29Black A.R. Black J.D. Azizkhan-Clifford J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 188: 143-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar, 30Samson S.L. Wong N.C. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 29: 265-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In the current study, we did not detect any significant changes in phosphorylation levels of Sp1 protein in cells overexpressing PTP1B (data not shown), although subtle change might not have been detectable by the methods used. Thus, the dephosphorylation site(s) by PP2A needs to be determined in further studies. We propose that the molecular mechanism for the activation of SREBP-1 gene expression by activation of Sp1 transcription factor is through activation of PP2A. We demonstrate here a unique serial activation of the PTP1B-PP2A axis as a novel mechanism for the regulation of gene expression in the biosynthesis of triglyceride. Therefore, PTP1B is a crucial molecule in the pathogenesis of postprandial hypertriglyceridemia and the insulin resistance/metabolic syndrome (Fig. 6). Further in vivo study is necessary to confirm the in vitro findings and to clarify the clinical significance of PTP1B roles in insulin-resistant states. In summary, we demonstrate here that another important action of PTP1B stimulates SREBP-1 gene expression, hepatic triglyceride synthesis, and postprandial hypertriglyceridemia, even though PTP1B is postulated to be an important target to reduce resistance to insulin and leptin in obesity and other insulin-resistant states (9Johnson T.O. Ermolieff J. Jirousek M.R. Nat. Rev. Drug. Discov. 2002; 1: 696-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). We therefore propose that PTP1B represents a novel therapeutic target for the amelioration of postprandial (diet-induced) hypertriglyceridemia through modulation of SREBP-1a and -1c expression in the liver by activation of the PTP1B-PP2A axis.

Two genes were co-transcribed with cmtR, one encoding a deduced P1 type ATPase. Purified CmtR bound to the cmt operator-promoter, and repression of transcription was lost after introduction of a stop codon into cmtR. Assays of metal-dependent expression from cmt and nmt operator-promoters established that the metal specificity of CmtR in vivo was perfectly inverted relative to the nickel-cobalt sensor NmtR from the same organism, with CmtR totally insensitive to Co(II) or Ni(II) and NmtR totally insensitive to Cd(II) or Pb(II). Absorption spectroscopy of Cd(II)-, Co(II)-, and Ni(II)-substituted CmtR revealed S– to metal-charge-transfer which was absent in NmtR, providing diagnostic metal-difference spectra that discriminated between metal-binding to these two proteins. Ni(II)-binding isothermal titrations of CmtR are complex, with K app = 1.8 × 104m–1 for site1, three orders of magnitude weaker than K Ni for NmtR. Mixing equimolar apo-NmtR and apo-CmtR with 0.9 equivalents of Cd(II) gave Cd(II)-dependent difference spectra almost identical to Cd(II)0.9-CmtR. Thus, Cd(II) bound to CmtR in preference to NmtR, whereas the converse was true for Ni(II); this correlates faithfully with and provides a simplistic basis for metal-sensing preferences. In contrast, CmtR and NmtR had similar affinities for Co(II), and alternative explanations for Co(II) sensitivities are invoked.

Intracellular metal sensors must detect any surplus ions and modulate expression of genes encoding proteins that expel, sequester, or otherwise detoxify the excess. What molecules sense that some critical metal threshold has been exceeded, and how do they discriminate between the elements?

Permutations in the use of these sites for allostery, involving distinct ligand sets in sensors with differing selectivities, has been described as “a theme and variations model” (22Busenlehner L.S. Pennella M.A. Giedroc D.P. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2003; 27: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Here we report a new sensor in which the residues required for inducer recognition compose completely original sites. Metal availability within the host cytosol can also contribute to observed specificities (13Cavet J.S. Meng W. Pennella M.A. Appelhoff R.J. Giedroc D.P. Robinson N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38441-38448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Repression mediated by NmtR from Mycobacterium tuberculosis was alleviated by Ni(II) and Co(II) in mycobacterial cells, but solely by Co(II) when introduced into a cyanobacterium. Nonetheless, intrinsic differences between SmtB and NmtR must allow SmtB to respond to Zn(II) but not Co(II), and NmtR to respond to Co(II) but not Zn(II), when tested in a common cell type. In this case, metal-binding preferences of the two proteins do not provide a simplistic explanation for the observed selectivities. NmtR binds Co(II) with an affinity 500-fold weaker than non-inducing Zn(II), and K Co for SmtB is at least 3000-fold greater than Co(II)-sensing NmtR (13Cavet J.S. Meng W.

However, Co(II)-NmtR undergoes allostery in vitro in the presence of metal concentrations where Zn(II) is ineffective, and critically spectroscopic studies reveal hexa- or pentadentate coordination for Ni(II) and Co(II) (13Cavet J.S. Meng W. Pennella M.A. Appelhoff R.J. Giedroc D.P. Robinson N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38441-38448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) but tetradentate coordination for Zn(II) (23Pennella M.A. Shokes J.E. Cosper N.J. Scott R.A. Giedroc D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3713-3718Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Six α5C residues are obligatory for NmtR inducer recognition in vivo. In this instance, selectivity against Zn(II) but in favor of Co(II) and Ni(II) is at the level of allostery being restricted to metals preferring higher coordination number complexes. Thus, Zn(II) readily binds to NmtR but does not associate with all six ligands and hence fails to promote DNA dissociation. This is in contrast to SmtB, where tetrahedral Zn(II) complexes (24VanZile M.L. Cosper N.J. Scott R.A. Giedroc D.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11818-11829Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) do undergo allostery (25VanZile M.L. Chen X. Giedroc D.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9776-9786Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). M. tuberculosis is a surprisingly valuable model organism for exploring metal selectivity of ArsR/SmtB sensors because its genome (26Cole S.T. Brosch R. Parkhill J. Garnier T. Churcher C. Harris D.

Nature. 1998; 393: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (6506) Google Scholar) contains 10 related genes. Do these sensors differ in their metal selectivities and, if so, how do they discern different metals within the same cytosol? The DNA-binding sites and effectors of the products of the remaining nine genes other than nmtR are unknown, but the proximity of Rv1994c (hereafter called cmtR) to a gene predicted to contribute to metal homeostasis (Fig. 1A) strongly suggested that CmtR may associate with a common promoter to regulate their expression in response to some unknown metal. We confirm that this is true and establish that the inducing metals are Cd(II) and Pb(II). CmtR and NmtR have been analyzed simultaneously to directly contrast their in vivo metal specificities and to compare their in vitro metal-binding characteristics. In this case, relative metal-binding preferences in vitro of NmtR versus CmtR do support the most obvious explanation for the observed specificities for Cd(II) and Ni(II) but not for Co(II). Site-directed mutagenesis has been used to further define the CmtR residues essential for detecting metals. The chemical nature of the ligands and their spatial arrangement provides further insight into the sub-molecular bases of selective metal detection inside cells. Bacterial Strains and DNA Manipulations—Mycobacterium smegmatis mc2155 and Mycobacterium bovis BCG (Pasteur) were grown with shaking at 37 °C in LB medium (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) containing 0.05% Tween 80 (v/v) or Sauton medium (28Sauton M.B. C. R. Acad. Sci. (Paris). 1912; 155: 860-861Google Scholar), respectively. Escherichia coli strains JM109 (Stratagene), JM101, and BL21(DE3) were grown in LB medium. Cells were transformed to antibiotic resistance as described (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed.

Standard DNA manipulations were performed according to Sambrook et al. (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). All generated plasmid constructs were checked by sequence analysis. RNA Manipulation and Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR—The cmtR region (Fig. 1A) is conserved with 100% identity in M. bovis BCG. Nucleic acids were extracted from M. bovis BCG using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), treated with DNase I (Stratagene), and used (∼0.5 μg) as template for reverse transcription reactions with M-MuLV reverse transcriptase (Stratagene), primer I (5′-GAACTGAAACCCGGTGGCCTG-3′) (Fig. 1A), and RNase block (Stratagene), according to manufacturers' instructions. A control reaction in which reverse transcriptase was replaced with H2O was included. The reverse transcriptase-PCR amplification reactions used primers I and II (5′-GTCGAGATGACAGGTAGCTG-3′) (Fig. 1A). Construction of cmtR-lacZ Fusions, Site-directed Mutagenesis, and β-Galactosidase Assays—M. tuberculosis H37Rv DNA was used as template for PCR with primers III (5′-GAAGAATTCCGAGCCCGCCAGCTATCG-3′) and IV (5′-GAAGGATCCTGCTGCTCAGCTACCTG-3′) and the amplification product containing the cmt operator-promoter and cmtR, ligated to pGEM-T prior to subcloning into the ScaI/BamHI site of pJEM15 (29Timm J. Lim E.M. Gicquel B. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6749-6753Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to create a transcriptional fusion with lacZ (Fig. 1C). QuickChange (Stratagene) site-directed mutagenesis was subsequently used, according to manufacturer's protocols, to generate derivatives with codon substitutions in cmtR: Ser9 to a UAG stop codon; Cys4, Cys24, Cys35, Cys57, Cys61, and Cys102 to Ser; His 81, Glu105, Glu111, and Glu114 to Gln; and Asp79, Asp97, and Asp99 to Ala. The lacZ fusion constructs were introduced into M. smegmatis mc2155 and transformants selected on Middlebrook 7H10 agar supplemented with 10% (w/v) oleic acid/albumin/dextrose/catalase enrichment (Difco) and 25 μg/ml–1 kanamycin. M. smegmatis mc2155 containing nmtR and the nmtA operator-promoter in pJEM15 (13Cavet J.S. Meng W. Pennella M.A. Appelhoff R.J. Giedroc D.P. Robinson N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38441-38448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) was also used to examine expression from the nmtA operator-promoter. β-galactosidase assays were performed as described previously (30Morby A.P. Turner J.S. Huckle J.W. Robinson N.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 921-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) in triplicate on at least three separate occasions. The medium was supplemented with various concentrations of metals (described in individual experiments) for ∼20 h immediately prior to assays. The metal salts used were ZnSO4, CoSO4, NiCl2, CdCl2, Fe(III) citrate, Pb(NO3)2, Bi(No3)3, CuSo4, AgN03, and HgCl2. Expression and Purification of CmtR—The cmtR coding region was amplified by PCR from M. tuberculosis H37Rv DNA using primers V (5′-GAACATATGCTGACGTGTGAGATGC-3′) and VI (5′-GAAGAATTCTGCTGCTCAGCTACCTG-3′) and ligated to pGEM-T (Promega) prior to subcloning into the NdeI/EcoRI site of pET29a (Novagen). Recombinant protein was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3), cell lysates were prepared (30Morby A.P. Turner J.S. Huckle J.W. Robinson N.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 921-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), and CmtR was purified by binding to heparin-Sepharose (CL-4B column, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.8), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, and eluted into the same buffer but containing 400 mm NaCl. Fractionation of pooled eluate was done on Sephadex G-75 (246 ml) and concentrated by re-application to heparin-Sepharose equilibrated with 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.8), 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Elution into this buffer was done with 400 mm NaCl. Final application and elution was from Sephadex-G25 (Amersham Biosciences) in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) and 150 mm KCl in an anaerobic chamber. A single prominent band of the anticipated size (12.487 kDa) was detected by PAGE, and the concentration of purified protein was calculated from the theoretical molar extinction coefficient at 280 nm of 4200 m–1 cm–1. Gel Retardation Assays—Purified CmtR was incubated for 20 min at 25 °C in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 3% glycerol (v/v), and 0.05 mm spermidine with ∼0.2 μm nonspecific competitor DNA generated using the T7 primer (5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG-3′) and primer VII (5′-CAAGCTATGCATCCAACGCG-3′) with self-ligated pGEM-T as template and ∼0.2 μm P1, P2, P3, or P4 probe DNA (Fig. 1D). The latter were generated by PCR with pGEM-T containing cmtR and the cmt operator-promoter region as template, using primer VIII (5′-GAGCCAGGGCCGATTCC-3′) with primer IX (5′-CGCCGATCATATCTGCT-3′), primer X (5′-GCTGTTATACCAGTATATGG-3′) or primer XI (5′ATGCTGACGTGTGAGATG-3′) for P1, P2, and P4, respectively, or primer XII (5′-TCAAATAGTACACCA-3′) with primer X for P3. Samples were loaded onto 12% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels (30:1, acrylamide:bisacrylamide) and electrophoresed using 1× TBE (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) as the buffer system. Protein-DNA complexes were visualized by ethidium-bromide staining. Cd(II), Co(II), and Ni(II) Binding Experiments—Titrations of apo-CmtR with Cd(II), Co(II), and Ni(II) under anaerobic conditions were monitored by UV-visible optical spectroscopy in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) and 150 mm KCl essentially as described for SmtB (24VanZile M.L. Cosper N.J. Scott R.A. Giedroc D.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11818-11829Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To monitor Cd(II) binding in competition with NmtR (prepared as described in Ref. 13Cavet J.S. Meng W. Pennella M.A. Appelhoff R.J. Giedroc D.P. Robinson N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38441-38448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), 20.8 μm CmtR, 20.8 μm NmtR, or an equimolar mix of both proteins (total protein, 41.5 μm) were incubated in an anaerobic chamber with 18.7 μm Cd(II), and the optical spectra were recorded. Co(II) competition experiments were performed as above but using 37.4 μm Co(II) with 41.5 μm CmtR or NmtR, or 83 μm of a 1:1 mix of both proteins. Structural Model of CmtR—CmtR structure was modeled against SmtB (14Cook W.J. Kar S.R. Taylor K.B. Hall L.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 337-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) using SWISSMODEL. The secondary structure of the carboxyl-terminal extension of CmtR was predicted using PredictProtein. Rv1993c, cmtR, and cmtA Are Co-transcribed, and CmtR Binds to a Common Operator-Promoter Region—The proximity of cmtR, Rv1993c, and cmtA indicates that these three ORFs are co-transcribed (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, similarity of the deduced product of cmtR to members of the ArsR-SmtB family of metal-responsive repressors and of cmtA to metal-transporting P1-type ATPases suggests that the former might bind to the upstream operator-promoter region to regulate their transcription. Reverse transcriptase-PCR was used to detect any polycistronic mRNA containing cmtR, Rv1993c, and cmtA. Total RNA was extracted from M. bovis BCG, treated with DNase I, and used as template for reversed transcription with primer I, designed to anneal to sequences within the cmtA coding region (Fig. 1A). To control for PCR amplification of contaminating DNA, a reaction was performed in which H2O was substituted for reverse transcriptase. Products were used as PCR template with primers I and II, the latter annealing to sequences within the cmtR coding region. A reverse-transcriptase-dependent product of the anticipated size of 432 bp was detected (Fig. 1B). Purified CmtR was used in gel retardation assays with a 111-bp DNA fragment, P1, containing part of the cmt operator-promoter and the 5′ end of cmtR (Fig. 1D). A major retarded complex (and several minor retarded complexes) was formed with increasing concentrations of CmtR with a concomitant decrease in the amount of free probe but no shift of nonspecific competitor DNA (Fig. 1D), demonstrating specific binding of CmtR to the 111-bp P1 fragment. To further map the CmtR-DNA binding site, assays were repeated using truncations of P1. A major complex was detected with P2 and P3 but not with P4 (Fig. 1D), confirming CmtR binding to sequences contained within a 35-bp DNA fragment that includes a degenerate 10–5-10 hyphenated-inverted repeat (Fig. 1E). CmtR Is a Cadmium- and Lead-responsive Repressor—CmtR shows the greatest similarity to the Hg(II) sensor MerR from S. lividans, whereas CmtA shows greater similarity to Cd(II)-exporting CadA (31Nucifora G. Chu L. Misra T.K. Silver S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3544-3548Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). It is probable that the same metals will be sensed by CmtR and transported by CmtA. To establish which, if any, metals induce transcription from the cmt operator-promoter, a 520-bp DNA fragment including the 156-bp cmt operator-promoter and the entire cmtR coding region was fused to a promoterless lacZ in plasmid pJEM15 (Fig. 1C) and introduced into M. smegmatis mc2155. Elevated β-galactosidase activity was detected in response to exposure (20 h) to maximum permissive concentrations of either Cd(II) or Pb(II) but no other metals (Fig. 2A). In the absence of added metal ions, elevated β-galactosidase activity was detected from an analogous construct in which codon 9 within the cmtR coding region had been converted to a stop codon (Fig. 2B), confirming that CmtR acts negatively toward expression from the cmt operator-promoter. Cd(II)-thiol Bonding in CmtR—The next challenge was to identify the inducer recognition sites of CmtR. Comparison with the amino acid sequences of related sensors (Fig. 3A) reveals that CmtR lacks potential liganding residues that precisely align with α3/α3N ligands required for inducer recognition by some ArsR-SmtB family members (8Sun Y. Wong M.D. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14955-14960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 15Shi W. Wu J. Rosen B.P. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4426-4436Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), although Cys35 is proximal to helix α3 and Cys4 is proximal to the amino terminus. CmtR has only two (Asp79 and His81) potential ligands aligning with the four conserved ligands at predicted α5 regulatory metal-binding sites of SmtB and NmtR (13Cavet J.S. Meng W.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9765-9775Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), although additional candidate ligands are present within a 21-residue carboxyl-terminal extension relative to SmtB, which is predicted (using PredictProtein) to form an additional α-helix not seen in other family members. The modeled structure of CmtR is based on the coordinates for SmtB (14Cook W.J. Kar S.R. Taylor K.B. Hall L.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 337-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Fig. 3B shows a hypothetical CmtR homodimer. UV-visible absorption spectroscopy was used to detect any involvement of thiols in CmtR Cd(II) binding. S– to Cd(II) ligand-to-metal charge transfer confers distinctive absorption in the UV region of ∼240 nm (8Sun Y. Wong M.D. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14955-14960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 9Busenlehner L.S. Weng T.-C. Penner-Hahn J.E. Giedroc D.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 685-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows spectra from anaerobic titration of CmtR with Cd(II) giving distinctive Cd(II)-dependent features; the Inset shows the Cd(II) binding isotherm fit to a site with a predicted maximum absorption at 240 nm of 13,900 M–1 cm–1. The absolute magnitude of the molar absorption (ϵ) at ∼240 nm reports on the number of Cd-S bonds, with ϵ248 ∼5500–6000 M–1 cm–1 per S–-Cd(II) bond (8Sun Y. Wong M.D. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14955-14960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These data are, therefore, consistent with at least two cysteinyl ligands involved in Cd(II) coordination. Of course, any “non-thiolate” Cd(II)-binding residues which lack ligand-to-metal charge transfer would not be detected by this method. The curve fit (Fig. 4, Inset) implies that saturation of binding requires the addition of more than one equivalent of Cd(II), which is suggestive of a second site. Identification of Cysteine Residues Essential for Cd(II)-recognition in Vivo—Having established that Cd(II)-coordination in vitro involves thiols, the next question is which, if any, cysteine residues are essential for inducer recognition and might supply these ligands? CmtR has a total of six cysteine residues (Fig. 3A), and substitution of Cys4, Cys35, Cys57, Cys61, and Cys102 with Ser in CmtR created functional repressors that mediated low expression of lacZ from the cmt operator-promoter in mycobacterial cells grown with no metal supplements (Fig. 5). However, β-galactosidase activity was constitutively elevated in cells containing a Ser substitution of Cys24, which is analogous to that observed after introduction of a stop codon (Fig. 2B), establishing that the Cys24 mutant is repressor non-functional. Most significantly, β-galactosidase activity was not elevated in cells containing Ser substitutions of Cys57, Cys61, and Cys102 at a Cd(II) concentration that causes loss of repression by wild-type CmtR (Fig. 5) and also by the Cys4- and Cys35-substituted mutants (Fig. 5). Consistent with this, alleviation of repression in the presence of maximum permissive [Pb(II)] was only observed for the Cys4- and Cys35-substi"

Unlike Ras, up-regulation or overexpression of these GDP/GTP binding molecular switches, but not activating point mutations, has been associated with human cancer. Although they share over 85% sequence identity, RhoA, RhoB, and RhoC appear to play distinct roles in cell transformation and metastasis. In NIH 3T3 cells, RhoA or RhoB overexpression causes transformation whereas RhoC increases the cell migration rate. To specifically target RhoA, RhoB, or RhoC function, we have generated a set of chimeric molecules by fusing the RhoGAP domain of p190, a GTPase-activating protein that accelerates the intrinsic GTPase activity of all three Rho GTPases, with the C-terminal hypervariable sequences of RhoA, RhoB, or RhoC. The p190-Rho chimeras were active as GTPase-activating proteins toward RhoA in vitro, co-localized with the respective active Rho proteins, and specifically down-regulated Rho protein activities in cells depending on which Rho GTPase sequences were included in the chimeras. In particular, the p190-RhoA-C chimera specifically inhibited RhoA-induced transformation whereas p190-RhoC-C specifically reversed the migration phenotype induced by the active RhoC. In human mammary epithelial-RhoC breast cancer cells, p190-RhoC-C, but not p190-RhoA-C or p190-RhoB-C, reversed the anchorage-independent growth and invasion phenotypes caused by RhoC overexpression. In the highly metastatic A375-M human melanoma cells, p190-RhoC-C specifically reversed migration, and invasion phenotypes attributed to RhoC up-regulation. Thus, we have developed a novel strategy utilizing RhoGAP-Rho chimeras to specifically down-regulate individual Rho activity and demonstrate that this approach may be applied to multiple human tumor cells to reverse the growth and/or invasion phenotypes associated with disregulation of a distinct subtype of Rho GTPase.

The Ras-related Rho family of small GTPases regulates the actin cytoskeletal organization, cell to cell or cell to extracellular matrix adhesion, intracellular membrane trafficking, gene transcription, apoptosis, and cell cycle progression (1Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2082) Google Scholar, 2Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5168) Google Scholar, 3Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3768) Google Scholar). Like Ras, they exist in an inactive, GDP-bound and an active, GTP-bound conformations. Rho GTPases are activated by a class of positive regulators, the Dbl family guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) 1The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; CS, calf serum; FBS, fetal bovine serum; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HME, human mammary epithelial; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; HA, hemagglutinin.1The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; CS, calf serum; FBS, fetal bovine serum; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HME, human mammary epithelial; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; HA, hemagglutinin. that catalyze the release of bound GDP and facilitate the binding of GTP (4Zheng Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 724-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), whereas deactivation of Rho proteins is achieved through their intrinsic GTP-hydrolytic activities that are further stimulated by a class of negative regulators, the GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) (5Moon S.Y. Zheng Y. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 13-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). A third class of regulators of Rho GTPases, the Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitors, can negatively impact Rho protein activities by sequestering them in the GDP-bound state and preventing effective cycling between the two conformational states (6Olofsson B. Cell Signal. 1999; 11: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Upon binding to GTP, Rho GTPases may further interact with an array of potential effector molecules to elicit cellular responses (7Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1655) Google Scholar). It has become increasingly clear that Rho proteins play important roles in many aspects of cancer development, and each member of the Rho family may be involved to a different extent at different tumor progression stages (8Sahai E. Marshall C.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar, 9Keely P.J. Lancet. 2001; 358: 1744-1745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 10Jaffe A.B. Hall A. Adv. Cancer Res. 2002; 84: 57-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). For example, it was shown that constitutively active RhoA has oncogenic potential (11Zohn I.M. Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1415-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), and RhoA acts as a critical signaling component in Ras-induced transformation (12Qiu R. Chen J. McCormick F. Symons M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11781-11785Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Furthermore, RhoA promotes the invasiveness of rat hepatoma cells (13Yoshioka K. Matsumura F. Akedo H. Itoh K. J. Biol. Chem.,. 1998; 273: 5146-5154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and induces metastasis of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (14del Peso L. Hernández-Alcoceba R. Embade N. Carnero A. Esteve P. Paje C. Lacal J.C. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 3047-3057Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), whereas RhoC was revealed as a key regulator of migration and metastasis in a human melanoma cell line (15Clark E.A. Golub T.R. Lander E.S. Hynes R.O. Nature. 2000; 406: 532-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). Upon introduction into normal mammalian epithelial cells, RhoC readily caused transformation and invasion, leading to an inflammatory breast cancer cell phenotype (16van Golen K.L. Wu Z.F. Qiao X.T. Bao L.W. Merajver S.D. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5832-5838PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, RhoB is required for the apoptotic responses induced by farnesyltransferase inhibitors or DNA damaging agents and may have a suppressor or negative modifier function in cancer progression (17Prendergast G.C. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 162-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Unlike Ras, there are no reports of mutation-caused constitutive activation of Rho proteins in tumors. Recent studies of primary human tumors (18Kamai T. Arai K. Tsujii T. Honda M. Yoshida K. BJU Int. 2001; 87: 227-231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Fritz G. Just I. Kaina B. Int. J.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6835-6839Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) revealed that many Rho GTPases, including RhoA and RhoC, are highly expressed in a variety of cancer types such as colon, lung, testicular germ cell, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, and inflammatory breast cancer, and in some cases, the Rho protein up-regulation and/or overexpression correlates with poor prognosis (22Suwa H. Ohshio G. Imamura T. Watanabe G. Arii S. Imamura M. Narumiya S. Hiai H. Fukumoto M. Br. J. Cancer. 1998; 77: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). These observations help put Rho proteins in a lineup of potential molecular targets for anti-cancer therapy (8Sahai E. Marshall C.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). Currently available molecular tools to target Rho GTPase pathways at the small G-protein level include the dominant negative mutants of Rho proteins (23Feig L.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E25-E27Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), the p21-binding domain of effectors (24Nur-E-Kamal M.S.A. Kamal J.M. Qureshi M.M. Maruta H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7787-7793Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and a class of bacterial toxins that can modify Rho GTPase functions (25Lerm M. Schmidt G. Aktories K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 188: 1-6Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although they have been widely used in cell biological studies, each of these reagents has its own drawbacks. The dominant negative forms of Rho proteins act by sequestering the upstream GEF activators of endogenous Rho GTPases and tend to be nonspecific among closely related Rho family members (23Feig L.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E25-E27Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Further, because of their non-catalytic nature, a 3–5-fold overexpression versus the endogenous Rho protein level is typically needed for effective blockage of the endogenous activity, and this may not be desirable in many in vivo situations. Similarly, the limited specificity of effector p21-binding domains and bacterial toxins such as Clostridium botulinum C3-transferase is worrisome in terms of differentiating the roles of highly homologous isoforms such as RhoA, RhoB, and RhoC. Furthermore, very little is known about the anti-cancer potential of these Rho GTPases inhibitors. Because RhoGAPs have been established as the major class of negative regulators of Rho GTPase signaling (5Moon S.Y. Zheng Y. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 13-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar), and some of them are actually known for their tumor suppressor function (26Yuan B.Z. Miller M.J. Keck C.L. Zimonjic D.B. Thorgeirsson S.S. Popescu N.C. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2196-2199PubMed Google Scholar, 27Wang D.Z. Nur-E-Kamal M.S. Tikoo A. Montague W. Maruta H. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2478-2484PubMed Google Scholar), another possible approach for inhibiting Rho GTPase activities in tumor cells is to employ RhoGAPs as antagonists for Rho activities. The conserved GAP domain in RhoGAPs contains the necessary and sufficient structural determinants for Rho protein recognition and GTPase catalysis but displays limited substrate specificity (5Moon S.Y. Zheng Y. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 13-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). For example, the RhoGAP domain of p190 RhoGAP can catalyze GTP hydrolysis of RhoA, RhoB, and RhoC equally well but works weakly on Rac or Cdc42 (28Zhang B. Zheng Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5249-5257Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 29Settleman J. Narasimhan V. Foster L.C. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1992; 69: 539-549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). It depends on other regulatory domains in the RhoGAP to direct and regulate substrate selection and catalysis in vivo (30Brouns M.R. Matheson S.F. Hu K.Q. Delalle I. Caviness V.S. Silver J. Bronson R.T. Settleman J. Development. 2000; 127: 4891-4903PubMed Google Scholar, 31Brouns M.R. Matheson S.F. Settleman J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 361-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Conversely, although Rho proteins may share up to 90% sequence identity, each Rho subtype appears to play distinct roles in cellular transformation and metastasis. The differences in Rho GTPase functions may come in part from their distinct subcellular localization patterns that are mostly determined by the unique C-terminal hypervariable sequences in each case (32Adamson P. Paterson H.F. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 617-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 33Michaelson D. Silletti J. Murphy G. D'Eustachio P. Rush M. Philips M.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 111-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have developed a novel strategy combining the RhoGAP domain of p190 RhoGAP with the C-terminal hypervariable sequences of Rho proteins to specifically target RhoA, RhoB, or RhoC activity in human tumor cells. We show that although RhoA, RhoB, and RhoC are equally effective in stimulating actin stress fiber formation and focal complex assembly in NIH 3T3 cells, RhoA and RhoB are capable of transforming cells whereas RhoC induces cell migration. The chimera made of p190 and the C terminus of RhoA specifically inhibited RhoA-induced cell transformation whereas the p190-RhoC chimera specifically reversed RhoC-mediated migration phenotype by down-regulating RhoC activity. Moreover, when applied to the HME-RhoC human inflammatory breast cancer cells or to the A375-M human melanoma cells, the p190-RhoC chimera was effective in reversing the anchorage-independent growth and/or the invasion phenotypes that were attributed to RhoC up-regulation. Our results suggest that such a RhoGAP-based approach targeting specific Rho GTPase activity could be useful in reversing tumor cell phenotypes associated with disregulation of a distinct subtype of Rho GTPase. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutants of human RhoA, RhoB, and RhoC were generated by polymerase chain reactions using the Pfu polymerase, with primers that contained the desired mutations following the published protocols (34Li R. Zhang B. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32830-32835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The mutant cDNAs were subcloned into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of mammalian expression vector pCEFL-GST, and the mutants were expressed as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusions (35Vanni C. Mancini P. Gao Y. Ottaviano C. Guo F. Salani B. Torrisi M.R. Zheng Y. Eva A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19745-19753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The sequences of mutagenized DNA inserts were confirmed by automated sequencing. All point mutants used are described by single-letter amino acid denominations. Construction of p190-Rho Chimeras—p190-Rho chimeric cDNAs were generated by fusing the cDNAs encoding the RhoGAP domain of rat p190 and the cDNAs encoding the C terminus of human RhoA, RhoB, or RhoC after PCR amplification of the respective sequences. The primer sequences are as follows: for RhoA C terminus, 5′ GCGAATTCTCACAAGACAAGGCAACCAGATTTTTTCTTCCCACGTCTAGCTTGCAGAGAAGACAACTGATTTTCCTGC 3′; for RhoB C terminus, 5′ GCGAATTCTCATAGCACCTTGCAGCAGTTGATGCAGCCGTTCTGGGAGCCGTAGCTTCTGCAGAGAAGACAACTGATTTTCCTGC 3′; and for RhoC C terminus, 5′ GCGAATTCTCAGAGAATGGGACAGCCCCTCCGACGCTTGTTCTTGCGGACCTGGAGAGAAGACAACTGATTTTCCTGC 3′. The ligation products of cDNAs encoding p190RhoGAP domain, and the respective Rho sequences were cloned into the MIEG-3-(HA)3 and SF91-EMCV-IRES-GFP retroviral vectors that express the chimeras as (HA)3- or FLAG-tagged fusions, together with the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) bicistronically (36Gu Y.

Cell Culture and Transfection—NIH 3T3 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum (CS) in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. COS-7 cells, and the retroviral packaging Phoenix cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The A375 and HME tumor cell lines were maintained as described (15Clark E.A. Golub T.R. Lander E.S. Hynes R.O. Nature. 2000; 406: 532-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar, 16van Golen K.L. Wu Z.F. Qiao X.T. Bao L.W. Merajver S.D. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5832-5838PubMed Google Scholar). To generate stable transfectants, NIH 3T3 cells were seeded in 6-well plate at a density of 1.5 × 105 cells in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% CS. These cells were transfected with the pCEFL-GST-Rho constructs in the next day using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Selection of stable transfectants was carried out by adding 0.35 mg/ml of G418 to the culture medium 48 h after transfection. After ∼2 weeks culturing in the selection medium, the surviving cells including over 100 colonies were examined for the expression of GST fusion proteins by anti-GST immunoblotting. GTPase Activity Assay—The intrinsic and p190GAP-stimulated GTPase activities of RhoA were measured as described (34Li R. Zhang B. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32830-32835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) by the nitrocellulose filter-binding method. Briefly, recombinant RhoA were preloaded with [γ-32P]GTP (10 μCi, 6000Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in a 100-μl buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.5 mm EDTA for 10 min at ambient temperature before the addition of MgCl2 to a final concentration of 5 mm. An aliquot of the [γ-32P]GTP-loaded RhoA was mixed with GAP assay buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 5 mm MgCl2 in the presence or absence of various GAPs. At different time points the reaction was terminated by filtering the reaction mixture through nitrocellulose filters. The radioactivity retained on the filters were then subjected to quantitation by scintillation counting. Retroviral Gene Transfer—Various p190-Rho chimeras were expressed in NIH 3T3 cells or tumor cells by the retroviral infection method. Production of recombinant retrovirus in the retroviral packaging Phoenix cells and subsequent host cell infection were carried out according to the described protocols (36Gu Y. Jia B. Yang F.C.

The infected cells were harvested 72 h post-infection. EGFP-positive cells (typically 10–50%) were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and were used for further analysis. Rho Effector Pull-down Assay—To determine the RhoA, RhoB, or RhoC activity in cells, the effector pull-down assay (38Zhu K. Debrecini B. Li R. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25993-26001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) was carried out in the respective cells that have been serum-starved for 20 h. The effector probe for Rho-GTP, recombinant (His)6-Rhotekin, was expressed and purified from Escherichia coli and immobilized on the Ni-NTA-agarose beads. The bead-associated (His)6-Rhotekin (about 1 μg/sample) was incubated with the respective cell lysates expressing various GST-Rho proteins for 45 min at 4 °C, and the co-precipitates were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-GST or anti-Rho monoclonal antibody. Transformation Assay—Measurements of the anchorage-independent growth of mutant Rho protein expressing cells or tumor cells were carried out as described (38Zhu K. Debrecini B. Li R. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25993-26001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 39Lin R. Cerione R.A. Manor D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23633-23641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 × 104 cells were suspended in the 10% FBS-supplemented Ham's F-12 complete medium with growth factors and 0.3% agarose and were plated on top of a solidified, 0.6% agarose. The cells were fed weekly by the addition of 1 ml of medium. Three weeks after plating, the colonies grown larger than 50 μm in diameter were scored under a microscope. To measure cell transforming activity, 5 × 103 cells transfected with various Rho constructs were mixed with 5 × 104 wild type NIH 3T3 cells and were plated in 100-mm dishes in a medium containing DMEM supplemented with 10% CS. The cells were fed every other day, and the visible foci were scored 14 days post-plating. Wound Healing and Migration Assays—For wound healing assays, cells were plated at 2 × 106/dish density in 60-mm diameter dishes. A plastic pipette tip was drawn across the center of the plate to produce a clean 1-mm-wide wound area after the cells have reached confluency. After a 12-h culturing in DMEM supplemented with 0.5% CS, cell movement into the wound area was examined at different time points using a phase-contrast microscope. The distances between the leading edge of the migrating cells and the edge of the wound were compared (40Guo F. Gao Y. Wang L. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14414-14419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Cell migration was also measured by using a Transwell plate inserted with a 6.5-mm polycarbonate membrane (8.0-μm pore size; Costar Corp.). Briefly, 5 × 104 cells were suspended in 0.2 ml of culture medium and were added to the upper chamber. 10% FBS in culture medium was used as chemoattractant in the lower chamber. The cells were incubated for 16 h in a humidified CO2 incubator at 37 °C. The cells that traversed the 8.0-μm membrane pores and spread to the lower surface of the membrane were stained with 5% Giemsa solution, and the cells retained in the membrane were counted in at least six different fields. Each experiment was carried out in triplicate, and the error bars represent the mean standard error. Invasion Assay—Cell invasion assays were performed using the 6.4-mm Biocoat Matrigel invasion chambers equipped with the 8.0-μm pore sized PET membrane filters (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 2.5 × 104 cells were suspended in 0.5 ml of culture medium and were added to the upper chamber. 10% FBS in the culture medium was plated in the lower chamber as chemoattractant. Cells in the invasion chambers were incubated in a humidified incubator. The cells that traversed the Matrigel matrix and the 8-μm membrane pores and spread to the lower surface of the filters were stained with 5% Giemsa solution for visualization. Each data point of the invasion test was derived from triplicate chambers, and error bars represent the mean standard error. Immunofluorescence—Cells grown on coverglasses were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min and washed with phosphate-buffered saline once followed by permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 20 min. The cells were then blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin for 20 min. For actin staining, the cells were incubated with rhodamine-phalloidin. For vinculin staining, the cells were labeled with anti-vinculin monoclonal antibody (Sigma) followed by incubation with a rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody. To determine the intracellular localization of various Rho proteins and p190-Rho chimeras, the fluorescence-activated cell sorting-isolated, EGFP-positive cells were labeled with anti-HA monoclonal antibody or with anti-GST polyclonal antibody followed by rhodamine- or cy5-conjugated secondary antibody staining. The stained cells were mounted onto slides in Aqua-mount and viewed with a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscopy or a Leica fluorescence microscopy equipped with the deconvolution software (Improvision, Inc.). Distinct Roles of RhoA, RhoB, and RhoC in Cell Transformation and Migration—Among the three closely related Rho proteins, RhoA, RhoB, and RhoC, RhoA is the best characterized one and has been shown to regulate actin stress fiber and focal complex formation (41Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3788) Google Scholar), to promote cell growth (39Lin R. Cerione R.A. Manor D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23633-23641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and to transform NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (42Khosravi-Far R. Solski P.A. Clark G.K. Kinch M.S. Der C.J.

By contrast, the function of RhoB or RhoC in fibroblasts has not been examined in detail and has not been directly compared with that of RhoA. To make comparisons of the cellular roles of RhoA, RhoB, and RhoC, we have generated two sets of activating mutants for each of the Rho proteins: the fast-cycling Rho-F30L and the GTPase-defective Rho-Q63L. Both types of the mutants result in the net enhancement of the active Rho-GTP species in cells but involve distinct mechanisms; Rho-F30L proteins contain significantly increased intrinsic GDP/GTP exchange activity and remain responsive to RhoGAP stimulation to cycle between the GDP- and GTP-bound states (39Lin R. Cerione R.A. Manor D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23633-23641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), whereas the Rho-Q63L mutants cannot hydrolyze bound GTP and are locked into the GTP-bound active conformation (42Khosravi-Far R. Solski P.A. Clark G.K. Kinch M.S. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6443-6453Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). We introduced these mutants into NIH 3T3 cells and generated the mutant expressing stable clones. Western blots show that the two mutant forms of all three Rho GTPases were expressed in the cells but at a lesser level than the endogenous Rho (Fig. 1A). Staining of the cells with fluorescently labeled phalloidin or anti-vinculin antibody revealed that under the serum-free conditions, both active forms of RhoB and RhoC stimulated the actin stress fiber and focal adhesion plaque formation, effects similar to that induced by the active RhoA mutants or by 10% CS stimulation (Fig. 1, B and C). Because the amino acid sequences of the three Rho proteins are over 85% identical overall and are almost 100% identical in the switch I effector domain, it is likely that they utilize the same set of effector targets to mediate actin structural changes and focal adhesion assembly. Although RhoB has been suggested to be involved in Ras-mediated oncogenic transformation (43Prendergast G.C. Khosravi-Far R. Solski P.A. Kurzawa H. Lebowitz P.F. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2289-2296PubMed Google Scholar), RhoA is the only one among the three that has been shown to possess transforming activity (42Khosravi-Far R. Solski P.A. Clark G.K. Kinch M.S. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6443-6453Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). When the transformation ability of the RhoA, RhoB, and RhoC mutants were directly compared in a foci-forming assay, we found that RhoB displayed a potent transforming activity similar to RhoA in both RhoB-F30L and RhoB-Q63L forms. In contrast, neither active forms of RhoC were able to transform cells (Fig. 2A). RhoA was shown previously (44Nobes C.D. Hall A J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1235-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (1201) Google Scholar) to be involved in fibroblast cell movement by mediating cell body contraction. When the migration rates of the cells expressing the active mutants of RhoA, RhoB, or RhoC were compared in a wound healing assay, we found that RhoC, but not RhoA or RhoB, was able to significantly increase migration of the cells from the edge of the wound to the open space in the middle of the wound (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that individual Rho proteins have unique functions in the two aspects related to tumorigenesis, transformation and migration. RhoA, in particular, is important for cell growth control and transformation, whereas RhoC might be a key player in mediating cell movement. Althou"

Other factors, including but not necessarily limited to CBP/p300, then bind within the C-terminal 38 amino acid transactivation domain (TAD) to activate transcription. We show that both tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT1α (full-length wild-type protein) and STAT1β (lacking the TAD) stimulate in vitro transcription on a naked DNA template. Furthermore, in a system with purified proteins and naked DNA, STAT1α- and STAT1β-dependent transcription is stimulated by the TRAP/Mediator co-activator complex. Thus STAT1, through some site other than the C-terminal TAD, can interact with TRAP/Mediator or some intermediate protein. Although both STAT1α and STAT1β bind to known STAT sites within in vitro assembled chromatin templates, only STAT1α, and not STAT1β, in cooperation with p300 and acetyl-CoA, stimulated in vitro transcription from chromatin. After interferon-γ treatment, cells recruit STAT1α or -β to the chromosomal interferon-1 gene, but only STAT1α-containing cells recruit p300 and stimulate transcription. We conclude that chromatin remodeling by p300 in vivo makes TRAP/Mediator effective in stimulating transcription.

These binding sites are capable of directing IFN-induced transcription of synthetic reporter genes in transfection experiments. Extensive studies of this family of transcription factors by mutagenesis and by reintroduction of mutant proteins into cells lacking particular STATs has allowed assignment of various functions to physical domains of the STATs that were then specifically delineated by crystallography (3Levy D.

Residues from 580 to 680 form an SH2 domain, which, by reciprocal SH2-pY interactions, provides the only protein contact in DNA-bound dimers. Residues from 1 to 130 form an N-terminal domain that allows a STAT dimer-dimer interaction on DNA (6Vinkemeier U. Cohen S.L. Moarefi I. Chait B.T. Kuriyan J. Darnell Jr., J.E.

A coil-coil region (residues 135–320) affords an extensive surface that could serve to interact with other nuclear proteins and is known to do so in several cases (9Horvath C.M. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M.

Finally, a C-terminal 38-amino acid segment binds the coactivator p300/CBP and is required for IFN-γ-induced transcriptional activation (13Muller M. Laxton C. Briscoe J. Schindler C. Improta T.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6963-6971Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Despite this progress, many detailed mechanistic questions about STAT function remain, particularly because STAT molecules will likely participate in cooperative transcription factor clusters called enhanceosomes (4Horvath C.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 496-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 11Zhang X. Wrzeszczynaska M.H. Horvath C.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell.

In particular, it is unknown whether STATs contain transcriptional activation domains other than the C-terminal domain that interacts with p300 and whether cognate-interacting factors function (like p300) in chromatin remodeling or at subsequent steps. The analysis of STAT function through in vitro transcription should both illuminate details of STAT function in transcriptional activation and provide the opportunity to study biochemical details of enhanceosome function for individual genes. Accordingly, we have explored in vitro transcription with STAT1 and mutant STAT1 proteins on both naked DNA and corresponding reconstituted chromatin templates. These latter results have been correlated with in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, and the combined results argue for distinct activation domains that function in chromatin modification and in a subsequent step(s). Recombinant Proteins—N-terminal His6-tagged STAT1α, STAT1β, and all STAT1 mutants were produced in Sf9 cells by means of baculovirus vectors and purified by standard techniques (Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system, Invitrogen). Purified STATs were treated with T4 endonuclease V-protease to remove His6 tags. All STAT proteins were modified by phosphorylation on Tyr-701 by in vitro activated epidermal growth factor receptor as described (6Vinkemeier U. Cohen S.L. Moarefi I. Chait B.T. Kuriyan J. Darnell Jr., J.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5616-5626Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). His6-tagged NAP-1 was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by Ni2+ agarose batch binding and elution followed by MonoQ column chromatography (18Ito T. Ikehara T. Nakagawa T. Kraus W.L. Muramatsu M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1899-1907Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FLAG-tagged ISWI and Acf1 were co-expressed via baculovirus vectors in Sf9 cells and co-purified as a complex (ACF) by anti-FLAG affinity batch binding and elution as described previously (19Ito T. Evenstein M.E.L. Fyodorov D.V. Kutach A.K. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1529-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). His6-tagged p300 and CBP were expressed and purified from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells. DNA Templates—Transcription reactions with STATs were carried out with the test plasmid pLy6E/G-less, which contained three STAT-binding sites from the mouse LY6E gene (20Khan K.D. Shuai K. Lindwall G. Maher S.E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Bothwell A.L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6806-6810Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). These three IFN-γ-activated sites were placed upstream of the adenovirus major late core promoter (21Shuai K. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1993; 261: 1744-1746Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar) followed by a G-less cassette; the construct is referred to as pLy6MLΔ53 or as pLy6. The control plasmid, pMLΔ53, lacked activator binding sites and contained the adenovirus major late promoter followed by a G-less cassette shorter than that in the LY6E plasmid. The plasmid pA4xMLΔ53 (22Malik S. Karathanasis S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1824-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) contains four cognate sites for HNF-4 upstream of the same core promoter. Chromatin Assembly—The assembly of chromatin with purified recombinant ACF, purified recombinant dNAP1, purified core histones from chicken erythrocytes (Upstate Biotechnology), pLy6E/G-less plasmid DNA, and ATP was performed as described (19Ito T. Evenstein M.E.L. Fyodorov D.V. Kutach A.K. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1529-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The assembly of chromatin with the Drosophila S190 extract was carried out as described (23Bulger M. Kadonaga J.T. Methods Mol. Genet. 1994; 5: 241-262Google Scholar). The resulting chromatin samples were subjected to micrococcal nuclease digestion analysis to confirm the appropriate distribution of periodic arrays. In Vitro Transcription—In vitro transcription reactions other than those seen in Fig. 3 were performed with HeLa nuclear extract (24Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). For reactions with naked DNA, STAT1 proteins were incubated with pLy6E/G-less for 20 min at 30 °C. After the addition of HeLa nuclear extract, reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 20 min before adding nucleoside triphosphates. RNA synthesis was allowed to proceed for 45–60 min at 30 °C. With chromatin templates, STAT1, p300/CBP, acetyl-CoA (Sigma), and HeLa nuclear extract were added as indicated subsequent to the completion of chromatin assembly (Fig. 1). After pre-initiation complex formation (30 min at 30 °C), NTPs were added and transcription was allowed to proceed for 60 min at 30 °C. Measurement of the transcription product was carried out as described (25Pognonec P. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5125-5136Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In vitro transcription reactions in Fig. 3 were performed with purified factors as described (26Malik S. Guermah M. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Reactions contained 10 ng of TFIIA, 10 ng of TFIIB, ∼50 ng of TFIID (containing 5 ng equivalent of TATA box-binding protein), 5 ng of TFIIEα, 2.5 ng of TFIIFβ, 25 ng of TFIIF, 20 ng of TFIIH, and 50 ng of Pol II. As indicated, reactions were supplemented with 1.5 μg of the USA preparation (see Fig. 3A) or 150 ng of positive cofactor 4 and ∼50–100 ng of TRAP/Mediator purified from extracts of a cell line expressing a tagged mediator component (27Malik S. Gu W. Wu W. Qin J. Roeder R.G. Mol.

HeLa cells were grown in Joklik medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. All media were supplemented with 100 μg/ml penicillin-streptomycin mix (Invitrogen). Cells were grown at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Cells bred were treated with IFN-γ (1000 units/ml) for chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments. Electrophoretic Mobility-shift Assay—A DNA probe of 155 base pairs (–210 to –55) containing three STAT1 binding sites was obtained by PCR with the pLy6E/G-less cassette. Unless indicated otherwise, 100 ng of recombinant tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT1 was incubated with 1 ng of 32P-labeled DNA probe for 20 min at room temperature. The protein-DNA complexes were analyzed as described previously (28Fried M. Crothers D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 6505-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar, 29Yang E.

ChIP Assay—One 15-cm dish of U3A cells was treated with INF-γ for the specified time, formaldehyde was added to the culture medium to a final concentration of 1%, and treated cells were incubated for 10 min at room temperature to cross-link the protein-DNA complexes. Cells were washed and collected in ice cold phosphate-buffered saline with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A. After centrifugation at 4 °C (1200 rpm), cell pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8) and rotated at 4 °C for 10 min. The cell lysate was then sonicated to reduce the DNA length to 200–500 base pairs. Debris was removed by centrifugation (13,000 rpm) for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatant was collected and diluted 10-fold in IP buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 167 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A). One percent of the chromatin solution was kept to check the amount of input DNA present in different samples. 1 μg of appropriate antibody was added to the remaining chromatin solution and incubated overnight at 4 °C with rotation. 60 μl of 50% protein A agarose slurry containing 20 μg of sonicated salmon sperm DNA and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Upstate Biotechnology) were added to immune complexes and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were collected by centrifugation and washed once with buffer I (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl) and twice with Tris-EDTA, pH 8. Immune complexes were eluted by incubating pelleted beads with 500 μl of 1% SDS in 0.1 m NaHCO3 for 30 min at room temperature with rotation. The supernatant fraction was collected by centrifugation. 20 μlof5 m NaCl was then added, and crosslinks were reversed by heating the eluates at 65 °C for 4 h. 10 μl of 0.5 m EDTA, 20 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and 2 μl of 10 mg/ml proteinase K were added to the eluates, and samples were incubated for 1 h at 45 °C. DNA was recovered by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation using 20 μg of glycogen as a carrier. DNA samples were then analyzed with 28 cycles of PCR to amplify IRF-1 promoter sequences. The nucleotide sequences of the primers used for the PCR reaction were 5′-CTTCGCCGCTAGCTCTAC-3′ and 5′-GCTCCGGGTGGCCTCGG. RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from U3A cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). The PCR conditions to detect IRF-1 mRNA were as follows: 94 °C, 30 s; 50 °C, 1 min; 72 °C, 30 s; and repeat 22 cycles. Primers used were as described (30Yang E. Wen Z. Haspel R.L. Zhang J.J. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5106-5112Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). DNase I Primer Extension Footprinting on Chromatin—600 ng of an ACF-assembled chromatin template was incubated with or without 150 ng of phospho-STAT1 followed by DNase I digestion and primer extension reaction as described previously (31Fyodorov D.V. Kadonaga J.T. Nature. 2002; 418: 897-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The 5′-end of the primer used for the extension reaction corresponds to the –210 position of the template. The three STAT binding sites are located at the –110, –130, and –155 positions. In Vitro Function of STATs on DNA versus Chromatin Templates—STATs must be phosphorylated on tyrosine (residue 701 in STAT1) to dimerize and bind DNA (21Shuai K. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1993; 261: 1744-1746Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar, 32Shuai K. Horvath C.M. Tsai-Huang L.H. Qureshi S. Cowburn D. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1994; 76: 821-828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). In addition, maximal in vivo transcriptional activity requires phosphorylation of a C-terminal serine residue (Ser-727 in STAT1) (33Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar). Purified, tyrosine-phosphorylated full-length STAT1 can be most efficiently prepared in large quantities by production in baculovirus-infected insect cells and subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation by activated epidermal growth factor receptor (6Vinkemeier U. Cohen S.L. Moarefi I. Chait B.T. Kuriyan J. Darnell Jr., J.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5616-5626Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). STAT1 prepared in this fashion is completely and exclusively phosphorylated on Tyr-701, with no evidence of Ser-727 phosphorylation (estimated limit of detection is ∼5%) from mass spectrometric analysis (data not shown). Because transcription is only reduced and not ablated in cells when Ser-727 is changed to alanine (33Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar), we performed in vitro transcriptional experiments with the purified, tyrosine phosphorylated STAT1 without attempting to phosphorylate Ser-727. The test DNA template contained three STAT1 binding sites upstream of the adenovirus major late core promoter (20Khan K.D. Shuai K. Lindwall G. Maher S.E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Bothwell A.L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6806-6810Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 21Shuai K. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1993; 261: 1744-1746Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar) followed by a G-less cassette, whereas a control template contained only the adenovirus core promoter (–53 to +10) and a shorter G-less cassette. The STAT1 binding sites on the plasmid (pLy6) were from the IFN-γ-induced murine Ly6E gene and were shown previously to function on model templates in vivo (21Shuai K. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1993; 261: 1744-1746Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Two transcription systems were employed to analyze the coactivator-dependence of the transcriptional activity of STAT proteins. One system (26Malik S. Guermah M. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2192-2197Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) consisted of the following: highly purified RNA polymerase II from HeLa cells; affinity purified preparations of recombinant general transcription factors TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIIE, and TFIIF; an enriched chromatographic fraction from HeLa cell nuclear extract containing TFIIH; and TFIID that was affinity-purified from HeLa cells expressing epitope-tagged TATA box-binding protein. Consistent with earlier results (26Malik S. Guermah M. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2192-2197Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 34Meisterernst M. Roy A.L. Lieu J.M.

Methods Enzymol. 1996; 274: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), this system supports basal (activator-independent) transcription from templates (including pLy6, see below) that contain the adenovirus major late promoter. However, to support activator-dependant transcription, this system requires additional cofactors, such as those present in the previously described USA fraction (34Meisterernst M. Roy A.L. Lieu J.M.

Therefore, to identify a potential role for the Mediator in STAT1-dependent transcriptional activation, the system that supports basal transcription was supplemented with affinity-purified USA or TRAP/Mediator fractions. A second transcription system used to compare STAT and coactivator-dependent transcription from DNA and chromatin templates employed HeLa cell nuclear extract as a source of all necessary components of the transcriptional machinery. The protocols and the order of addition of reagents are shown in Fig. 1A (DNA) and Fig. 1B (Chromatin). Chromatin templates for all experiments except those seen in Fig. 5 were prepared according to Ito et al. (18Ito T. Ikehara T. Nakagawa T. Kraus W.L. Muramatsu M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1899-1907Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and samples of chromatin preparations digested with micrococcal nuclease are shown in Fig. 1, C and D. STAT1α is the wild-type full-length transcriptional activator, and STAT1β is a naturally occurring splice variant (40Schindler C. Fu X.-Y. Improta T. Aebersold R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7836-7839Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar) that lacks the C-terminal transcriptional activation domain which can bind the histone acetyltransferases p300/CBP (14Horvai A.E. Xu L. Korzus E. Brard G. Kalafus D. Mullen T.-M. Rose D.W. Rosenfield M.G. Glass C.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1074-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 15Zhang J.J.

Both STAT1α and STAT1β bind DNA, with STAT1α showing a stronger tendency to form dimer-dimer complexes (Ref. 6Vinkemeier U. Cohen S.L. Moarefi I. Chait B.T. Kuriyan J. Darnell Jr., J.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5616-5626Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar and Fig. 2A). In crude nuclear extracts containing the general transcription machinery and various cofactors, tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT1α and STAT1β both stimulated transcription (above the basal level) from the test DNA template (pLy6) but not from the control (pMLΔ53) template (Fig. 2B). Using the partially purified transcription system that depends upon the USA coactivator fraction, we tested the ability of STAT1α and STAT1β to activate naked DNA templates (Fig. 3A). Under the conditions of the assay, basal level transcription on naked DNA was seen both from the test (pLy6) plasmid containing STAT binding sites and the reference template lacking these sites (pA4xMLΔ53) (Fig. 3A, lane 1). Consistent with the necessity of tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 for dimerization and DNA binding, neither unphosphorylated STAT1α (Fig. 3A, lane 2) nor unphosphorylated STAT1β (Fig. 3A, lane 3) displayed any activity. By contrast, both phosphorylated forms of STAT1 significantly stimulated transcription from the test template (Fig. 3A; compare lanes 4 and 5 with lanes 2 and 3, respectively) in the presence of added USA. As a positive control, the transcriptional activator HNF-4 increased transcription from the reference template, which contained HNF-4 binding sites (Fig. 3A, lane 6) (22Malik S. Karathanasis S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1824-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In a further analysis, the reconstituted transcription system containing pure preparations of all required factors (26Malik S. Guermah M. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2192-2197Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) was used to test directly the TRAP/Mediator-dependence of STAT/function (Fig. 3, B and C). In the absence of added TRAP/Mediator there was no transcriptional activation either by phosphorylated STAT1α (Fig. 3A, lanes 3 and 4) or by HNF-4 (Fig. 3A, lane 2; used as a positive control). However, when this reconstituted system was supplemented with affinity-purified TRAP/Mediator, activation by both STAT1α (Fig. 3A, lanes 7 and 8 versus lane 5) and HNF-4 (Fig. 3A, lane 6 versus lane 5) was evident. Separately, we further found that phosphorylated STAT1β was also able to activate transcription of the naked DNA template with the aid of the TRAP/Mediator complex (Fig. 3C). Overall, these results strongly implicate TRAP/Mediator in the function of STAT1 on naked DNA templates in vitro, and this stimulation can occur (perhaps less well; Fig. 3A, lanes 4 and 5) without the c-terminal STAT1 transactivation domain. We next examined the ability of STAT1 to activate transcription on chromatin templates (pLy6 and pΔ53ML). The low level basal transcription observed with the naked DNA templates was completely repressed on chromatin templates (Fig. 2C, lanes 1 and 2, and Fig. 4, lane 1). Significantly, transcriptional activation was observed with STAT1α but not with STAT1β (Fig. 2C, lanes 3 and 5 versus lane 1). Furthermore, preincubation with p300 (Fig. 2C, lanes 3–6) or CBP (data not shown) prior to adding the transcribing extract stimulated chromatin transcription by STAT1α but not STAT1β. In addition to the stimulation by added p300 (a histone acetyltransferase), further stimulation was achieved upon the addition of acetyl-CoA as an acetyl donor (Fig. 4, lane 3 versus lane 2). These results are in accord with the conclusion of in vivo experiments that at least one function of the carboxyl-terminal STAT1 domain is binding CBP/p300 (11Zhang X. Wrzeszczynaska M.H. Horvath C.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7138-7146Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). By analogy with the function of this coactivator in mediating other transcriptional events (Ref. 41An W. Palhan V.B. Karymov M.A. Leuba S.H. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 811-821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar and references therein), these results suggest that transcriptional activation by STAT1 involves p300-mediated acetylation of histones to promote access of the transcriptional machinery. To compare possible in vitro contributions of the STAT1α C terminus with known in vivo functions, transcriptional stimulation by the wild-type protein was compared with stimulation by two mutant proteins in vitro. First, Ser-727, the known phosphorylation site required for full IFNγ-induced transcriptional activity of STAT1, was changed to alanine (S727A). A second mutant (L724A) contained a leucine to alanine change at residue 724. Both of these mutations reduce IFNγ-induced transcriptional activity ∼3-fold when expressed in cells lacking STAT1 (16Zhang J.J. Zhao Y. Chait B.T. Lathem W.W. Ritzi M. Knippers R. Darnell Jr., J.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6963-6971Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The L724A and S727A proteins bound DNA similarly to wild-type STAT1 (Fig. 5A) and, when assayed on a naked DNA template in a nuclear extract, both the L724A and the S727A proteins increased transcription to approximately the same extent as wild-type protein (Fig. 5B). On similarly assayed chromatin templates, the two STAT1α mutants showed no transcriptional activity (Fig. 5C). However, addition of ectopic CBP to the nuclear extract resulted in significant stimulation of transcription by the mutant proteins, as well as stimulation by wild-type protein. These results agree with the known role of the C terminus in binding CBP/p300 and suggest a decreased affinity of CBP/p300 for the L724A and S727A mutant proteins, as was suggested but not demonstrated earlier (16Zhang J.J. Zhao Y. Chait B.T. Lathem W.W. Ritzi M. Knippers R. Darnell Jr., J.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6963-6971Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The relative activities of the mutant and wild-type proteins in vitro approximate the levels observed in transfection assays in vivo (16Zhang J.J. Zhao Y. Chait B.T. Lathem W.W. Ritzi M. Knippers R. Darnell Jr., J.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6963-6971Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Binding of STATs to Specific Sites within Chromatin—Because STAT1β did not stimulate transcription on a chromatin template, we employed DNaseI footprint analysis to determine whether it could bind to its cognate sites in chromatin. After incubation with STAT1α or STAT1β, chromatin templates were treated with DNaseI, and the resulting DNA fragments were purified and analyzed by radiolabeled primer extension and resolved on acrylamide gels. STAT1α and β gave similar footprints on the chromatin template, with all three STAT1 binding sites (indicated by lines) protected at the protein:DNA ratio used in this experiment (Fig. 6). Thus, the failure of STAT1β to stimulate transcription on chromatin templates was not caused by a failure to bind to cognate sites. IFN-γ-induced Association of STATs and p300 with the Promoter of a Chromosomal IFN-γ-responsive Gene—We next tested whether STAT1α and -β could bind to natural chromosomal loci in vivo. U3 cells, which lack STAT1 (13Muller M. Laxton C. Briscoe J. Schindler C. Improta T. Darnell Jr., J.E. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4221-4228Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), were stably transfected with either STAT1α or STAT1β (Fig. 7). STAT1α, but not STAT1β, restored the IFN-γ-induced response of the endogenous IRF-1 gene (Fig. 7A). To test for association of STAT1α or STAT1β with the endogenous IRF-1 promoter, STAT1α- or STAT1β-expressing cells were treated with IFN-γ, and samples were taken at intervals for ChIP (after crosslinking and sonication) with an antibody that recognizes a common epitope in STAT1α and STAT1β. There was an interferon-dependent increase of IRF-1 promoter DNA in the chromatin immunoprecipitates of extracts from both STAT1α- and STAT1β-expressing cell lines (Fig. 7B), showing that both proteins (1α and 1β) bind to natural sites within chromatin in vivo. Next, chromatin immunoprecipitation using p300 antibody was carried out to see whether both STAT1α and STAT1β would lead to accumulation of p300 on STAT sites within chromatin. Significantly, and despite equal binding of STAT1α and STAT1β to chromatin sites (Fig. 7B), only STAT1α recruited p300 to these sites (Fig. 7C). As a control in the chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments, an upstream region 3 kb from the start site was tested and not found to be precipitated by either STAT or p300 antibodies (data not shown). The in vitro experiments described in this paper establish that STAT1 molecules bound to known DNA recognition sites for STAT1 can effect recruitment of the transcriptional machinery and stimulate transcriptional initiation on both naked DNA and chromatin templates. The demonstrated ability of STAT1α, but not STAT1β, to stimulate in vitro transcription of a chromatin template is in accord with earlier mutagenesis, protein-protein association and transfection experiments that demonstrated a stimulatory role of the STAT1α-specific carboxyl terminus in STAT-induced transcription (16Zhang J.J. Zhao Y. Chait B.T. Lathem W.W. Ritzi M. Knippers R. Darnell Jr., J.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6963-6971Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 33Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar). However, the observation that STAT1β, as well as STAT1α, stimulates transcription of naked DNA revealed a heretofore unrecognized transcriptional activation function common to STAT1α and STAT1β and further suggested that STAT1 (α and β) could also interact with proteins other than those (such as p300/CBP) involved in chromatin remodeling. Using a partially purified transcription system, we have shown that one such factor involved in STAT-dependent transcriptional activation is the TRAP/Mediator complex. Given that several transcription activators have been shown to act in part through direct interactions with TRAP/Mediator (37Malik S. Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 277-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), we have made extensive, but thus far unsuccessful, efforts to show physical interactions of STAT1 (either free or DNA-bound and with or without phosphorylation) with the TRAP/Mediator complex. Thus, there may be other intermediary proteins linking STAT1 with TRAP/Mediator or, alternatively, the putative direct association may be weak and dependent upon cooperative interactions that are manifested only in the presence of the general transcription machinery (42Roeder R.G. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 201-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In this regard, STAT1 contains a relatively weak activation domain by comparison to other activators or to STAT2 (43Shen Y. Darnell Jr., J.E. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 2627-2633Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Moreover, the recent demonstration (44Lau J.F. Nusinzon I. Barkov D. Freedman L.P. Horvath C.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 620-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) of physical and functional interactions of STAT2 with the TRAP170/vitamin D receptor-interacting protein 150 component of Mediator establishes the concept, suggested here only from functional studies, of STAT-Mediator interactions. In addition, as indicated above, the ability of both STAT1α and STAT1β to mediate transcription from DNA templates suggests a secondary activation domain distinct from the C-terminal domain that has been linked thus far only to p300/CBP recruitment. Recent studies have shown that activator- and p300-dependent transcription from chromatin templates depends upon promoter-localized acetylation of nucleosomal histones (Ref. 41An W. Palhan V.B. Karymov M.A. Leuba S.H. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 811-821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar and references therein). Hence, the present demonstration of in vitro transcriptional enhancement on chromatin templates by p300/CBP and acetyl-CoA makes it likely that histone acetylation is required at or near the promoter for maximal STAT1-driven transcription. The ability of STAT1α, but not STAT1β, to activate transcription from a chromatin template in the presence of p300 and acetyl-CoA further suggests (see also below) that STAT1α, presumably through the C-terminal 38 amino acids, can recruit CBP/p300 whereas STAT1β cannot. Thus, if there is a role for the reported p300/CBP binding site in the N terminus of STAT1α and STAT1β (15Zhang J.J. Vinkemeier U. Gu W. Chakravarti D. Horvath C.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15092-15096Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), it is insufficient for significant independent action. It is also possible that other chromatin remodeling proteins and histone transacetylase may be involved in STAT1-mediated gene activation. For example, STAT2 is known to interact with GCN5 (45Paulson M. Press C. Smith E. Tanese N. Levy D.E. Nat. Cell. Bio. 2002; 4: 140-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, the ∼200 amino acid carboxyl terminus of STAT2 is very different from that of STAT1. In strong support of the conclusions of the in vitro transcription studies, in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses showed that whereas both STAT1α and STAT1β can accumulate on the IFNγ-induced IRF-1 promoter in vivo, only STAT1α is capable of recruiting CBP/p300 and stimulating transcription. This establishes the primary importance of the earlier demonstrated C-terminal STAT1-CBP/p300 interaction relative to the N-terminal STAT1-CBP/p300 interaction (16Zhang J.J. Zhao Y. Chait B.T. Lathem W.W. Ritzi M. Knippers R. Darnell Jr., J.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6963-6971Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) and, most importantly, elucidates the specific step at which this C-terminal activation domain functions. The in vitro system faithfully reproduces the decreased ability of STAT1 mutants to stimulate transcription in vivo (16Zhang J.J. Zhao Y. Chait B.T. Lathem W.W. Ritzi M. Knippers R. Darnell Jr., J.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6963-6971Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Thus, STAT1 L724A and S727A are poor activators on chromatin templates compared with wild-type protein, although they do show some activity. The basis for stronger activation by the natural amino acid sequence in the activation domain may include a more avid binding of p300/CBP due to Ser-727 phosphorylation or the presence of the Leu-724 residue. However, the ability of an increased level of CBP to stimulate transcription by both mutants suggests that they bind this co-activator less well than wild-type protein. The present study of STAT1 function on DNA versus chromatin templates has allowed the resolution of distinct activation domains and corresponding functions with distinct coactivators acting at chromatin remodeling versus post-chromatin remodeling steps. They also open the way for further identification of other factors that may be recruited by activated STAT1 molecules in the course of IFN-γ-stimulated gene transcription. Because all of the STAT proteins are so similar (particularly STAT3, which is 45% identical in amino acid sequence to STAT1), these results also suggest likely success in studies of other STAT molecules where in vivo interactions with other transcription factors have been documented (11Zhang X.

Remarkably, strong activators result in higher levels of splicing and 3′-cleavage than weak activators and can control the efficiency of these steps in pre-mRNA processing separately. The pre-mRNA processing stimulatory property of activators is dependent on their binding to promoters, but is not an indirect consequence of the levels of transcripts produced. Moreover, stimulation of splicing and cleavage by a strong activator operates by a mechanism that requires the carboxyl-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II. The splicing stimulatory property of activators was observed for unrelated transcripts and for separate introns within a transcript, indicating a possible general role for strong activators in facilitating pre-mRNA processing levels. The results suggest that the efficiency of constitutive splicing and 3′-end cleavage is closely coordinated with transcription levels by promoter-bound activators.

The generation of mature mRNA involves the addition of an m7G cap at the 5′-end, splicing, and cleavage and polyadenylation at the 3′-end of precursor (pre-)mRNAs. Although these steps can occur in isolation of each other, the majority of pre-mRNA processing occurs as RNA polymerase II (pol II) 1The abbreviations used are: pol II, RNA polymerase II; CTD, COOH-terminal domain; ESE, exonic splicing enhancer; DBD, DNA binding domain; TAT, Tat transactivator; Ad2ML, adenovirus 2 major late promoter; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; FBP, Far upstream element binding protein. is transcribing. This is evident from numerous microscopy studies, in which the removal of most introns is observed to coincide with nascent transcript synthesis, as well as from more recent studies that demonstrate that transcription and pre-mRNA processing steps are physically coupled and can influence one another (1Hirose Y.

The largest subunit of pol II contains a carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD), which in mammals consists of 52 repeats of the heptapeptide consensus sequence YSPTSPS (4Corden J.L. Cadena D.L.

Moreover, purified pol II, or the CTD itself, can stimulate splicing as well as the 3′-end processing of transcripts in vitro (17Hirose Y. Manley J.L.

Consistent with these results, factors involved in capping, splicing, and 3′-end formation have been found to interact with the CTD (1Hirose Y. Manley J.L.

It is not known at which stage of transcription different pre-mRNA processing components are recruited to transcription complexes, nor how CTD-associated components influence pre-mRNA processing. The 3′-end cleavage polyadenylation stimulatory factor (CPSF) interacts with the general transcription factor TFIID during transcription initiation (21Dantonel J.C. Murthy K.G. Manley J.L. Tora L. Nature. 1997; 389: 399-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), as well as with the CTD (15McCracken S. Fong N. Yankulov K. Ballantyne S. Pan G. Greenblatt J. Patterson S. Wickens M. Bentley D.L. Nature. 1997; 385: 357-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar), indicating that it is recruited to transcription initiation complexes prior to its role in cleavage. A number of splicing or splicing-related factors have recently been detected in association with holoenzyme complexes involved in transcription initiation, further suggesting that specific pre-mRNA processing components may be recruited to active genes at the stage of transcription initiation (22Robert F.

Recent work has also shown that the type of promoter or activator used to drive transcription can influence the level of inclusion of alternative exons in transfected pre-mRNA reporters (24Cramer P.

However, whether transcriptional activators can also influence the efficiency of constitutive pre-mRNA processing reactions, including splicing and 3′-end formation, has not been investigated. In the present study we provide evidence that tethering transcriptional activators of different strengths to the promoter of pre-mRNA reporters can modulate the efficiency of splicing and 3′-end cleavage. Stronger activators resulted in higher levels of splicing of constitutive introns, as well as higher levels of 3′-end cleavage, than weak activators. Stronger transcriptional activators were also found to stimulate 3′-end cleavage independently of splicing. The differential stimulation of splicing and cleavage by these activators was not a consequence of the different levels of transcripts produced but, instead, appeared to be because of an inherent functional property of the transcriptional activator. Our results also demonstrate that the increased level of splicing and cleavage promoted by a strong activator is dependent on the CTD of pol II, indicating an important role for this domain in mediating the effects of promoters on pre-mRNA processing. In summary, our results suggest that an important role of transcriptional activators is to modulate pre-mRNA processing efficiency in accordance with transcript levels. Transfections and RNA Analysis—Human 293 cells grown on 15-cm plates were transfected using FuGENE-6 (Roche Diagnostics) as per the manufacturer's instructions, with 5 μg of reporter, 0.5 μg of Gal4-(fusion) expression plasmid (or as indicated in Fig. 2), 0.5 μg of pSP-VA, and the appropriate empty vector to maintain equal amounts of DNA between samples. Cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection and RNA was isolated as previously described (28Yankulov K. Blau J. Purton T. Roberts S. Bentley D.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 749-759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In Fig. 3, 5 μg of α-amanitin-resistant pol II expression plasmid or the corresponding empty vector was transfected in addition to the above plasmids. 2.5 μg/ml α-amanitin was added to the medium after 16 h and RNA was isolated after another 48 h. RNase protection assays were performed as previously described. RNase protection analysis products were detected by autoradiography and quantified using a phosphorimager from Bio-Rad, after electrophoresis on a 6% polyacrylamide-urea gel. Spliced:unspliced and cleaved:uncleaved RNA ratios were calculated as follows. Band intensities were first normalized to the number of U residues; the corrected unspliced or uncleaved band intensities were divided by the corresponding corrected spliced or cleaved band intensities, respectively. Primer extension analysis was performed using 10 μg of total RNA and the oligonucleotide primer sequence 5′-GAGGTTTTTAAGCAAGCAAGCGTGGGGCCG-3′, which is complementary to a sequence located 148 bases downstream of the expected transcriptional start site, within the HIV-TAR region of the Gal5HIV2dsx pre-mRNA reporters.Fig. 3The CTD of pol II is required for VP16-stimulated splicing and 3′-end cleavage. RNase protection analysis of splicing and cleavage, as described in the legend to Fig. 1B, for Gal5HIV2dsx(+ESE) reporter transcripts generated by α-amanitin-resistant RNA pol II containing either a wild type CTD (pol II-(1–52)) (lanes 3, 6, and 9) or no CTD (pol IIΔ) (lanes 2, 5, and 8), and when activated by Gal4-SW6, Gal4-VP16, or Gal4 alone (N.A., no activator), as indicated. Controls represent background levels of reporter transcripts in cells not expressing α-amanitin-resistant pol II (lanes 1, 4, and 7). A shorter exposure of the gel is shown for lanes 7–9 to facilitate comparison with lanes containing weaker signals. Spliced:unspliced and cleaved:uncleaved ratios are shown in the adjacent bar graphs, calculated as described in the legend to Fig. 1C. Bands present in lane 7 likely represent residual stable transcripts generated by endogenous pol II, and activated by VP16, in the first few hours of the experiment before complete depletion of endogenous pol II as a consequence of α-amanitin treatment. Signals in lanes 8 and 9 are essentially entirely because of plasmid-derived α-amanitin-resistant pol IIΔ and pol II-(1–52), respectively, because the levels of these polymerases are in vast excess of endogenous pol II levels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Plasmids—Previously described plasmids include pSVED-aGal5HIV2 (24Cramer P.

Pre-mRNA Reporters and RNase Protection Probes—Gal5-HIV2dsx(+/–ESE) were constructed by replacing the BglII-EcoRI segments of pAD2MLdsxΔ and pAD2MLdsx(GAA)6 plasmids (31McCracken S. Lambermon M. Blencowe B.J. Mol. Cell.

Roberts S. Bentley D.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 749-759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), using PCR primers 5′-GAAGATCTCTCGAGCAGCTGAAGCTTGCA-3′ and 5′-GCTGATGAATTCGAGCTCGG-3′. Gal5HIV-dsx-Δint(+/–ESE) reporters were constructed by ligation of PCR products generated in Pfu polymerase reactions containing the Gal5HIV2dsx(+/–ESE) plasmids, a reverse primer that hybridizes specifically to exon 3 sequences immediately upstream of the intron, and a forward primer to exon 4 sequences immediately downstream of the intron. The following primer sequences were used: 5′-CCTCTTCGATTCGCCGGG-3′ and 5′-GCCAATACGTTGTGAATG-3′. pSVEDaGal5HIV2 was a generous gift from A. Kornblihtt, and has been previously described (24Cramer P.

RNase protection probes for 5′-end, splicing, and VA-RNA analysis (Figs. 1, 2, 3) have been previously described (28Yankulov K. Blau J. Purton T. Roberts S. Bentley D.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 749-759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 31McCracken S. Lambermon M. Blencowe B.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 148-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The RNase protection probe for 3′-end cleavage analysis (Figs. 1 and 3) was constructed by PCR amplification of sequences including 40 bp downstream of the cleavage position of the SV40 late polyadenylation signal, and 196 bp upstream including sequences in dsx exon 4 and the ESE using PCR primer sequences 5′-GGGGGGAGTACTCCCCTCAACATAATTTGA-3′ as a primer forward, and 5′-GGGGGGGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCTCGAGCCCCCCTGAACCTGAAACATAAAATG-3′ as a reverse primer, which contains the T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence for in vitro antisense transcription from the PCR product. The PCR product was digested with ScaI and XhoI, and subcloned into the SmaI and XhoI sites of the polylinker in pBluescript SK+ (Stratagene). Digesting the resulting plasmid with NotI, and transcribing with T7 RNA polymerase generates an RNase protection probe that will result in protected fragments from Gal5HIV2dsx(+ESE) reporter transcripts with sizes of 236 bases for uncleaved and 196 bases for cleaved RNA. The RNase protection probe for detecting splicing of α1-globin introns 1 and 2 from pSVEDaGal5HIV2 (Fig. 4) was generated by PCR amplification of 205 bp of α1-globin exon 2 and the flanking intronic sequences including 113 bp upstream and 35 bp downstream. The PCR primer sequences used were 5′-CGGGGATCCGGCTCCCTCCCCTGCTCCGACCC-3′ as a forward primer, and 5′-CGGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGGCTTGATATCGAATTCCTGCACCCTCGACCCAGATCGCTCC-3′ as a reverse primer, which contains the T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence for in vitro antisense transcription from the PCR product. However, the PCR product was digested with EcoRI and BamHI, and was subcloned into the corresponding sites in the polylinker of pBluescript SK+ (Stratagene). Upon digestion with XbaI and transcription with T7 RNA polymerase, the resulting plasmid yields an RNase protection probe 424 bases long, and will protect RNAs generated from pSVEDaGal5HIV2 with the following sizes: fully unspliced, 353 bases; unspliced at intron 1 only, 318 bases; unspliced at intron 2 only, 240 bases; and fully spliced, 205 bases. Pol II Expression Plasmids—Pol IIΔ was constructed by PCR amplification and subcloning of nucleotides 1 to 4767 of an α-amanitin-resistant form of the largest subunit of pol II from pAT7GRPB1αAmr (32Nguyen V.T. Giannoni F. Dubois M.F. Seo S.J. Vigneron M. Kedinger C. Bensaude O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2924-2929Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) into mammalian expression plasmid pcDNA3.1(–) (Invitrogen). The coding sequence is flanked by an upstream FLAG epitope sequence and downstream XbaI and ClaI restriction sites. Coding sequences for CTD heptapeptide 1 to 52 (for pol II-(1–52)) were generated by PCR amplification and subcloned into the XbaI and ClaI sites of pol IIΔ. Primer sequences and more detailed descriptions of the construction of pol II expression plasmids are available from the authors upon request. Transcriptional Activators Influence Splicing and 3′-End Cleavage Levels—To investigate whether transcriptional activators influence pre-mRNA processing levels, we tethered different transactivation domains to the promoter of a model pre-mRNA reporter (Gal5HIV2dsx) derived from exons 3 and 4 of the Drosophila doublesex (dsx) gene (Fig. 1A). The dsx pre-mRNA requires an exonic splicing enhancer (ESE) in exon 4 for efficient processing in vitro and in vivo (31McCracken S. Lambermon M. Blencowe B.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 148-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 33Inoue K. Hoshijima K. Higuchi I. Sakamoto H. Shimura Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1999; 96: 6125-6130Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To determine whether activators might affect ESE-dependent or ESE-independent processing differently, we compared splicing and 3′-end cleavage levels of Gal5HIV2dsx(+intron) transcripts, with or without a typical mammalian ESE consisting of six GAA repeats inserted into exon 4. The Gal5HIV2dsx pre-mRNA reporter contains an HIV2 promoter and five upstream binding sites for the yeast Gal4-DNA binding domain (DBD), and can be activated by Gal4-DBD fusion proteins containing different transcriptional activation domains. The Gal5HIV2dsx(+/–ESE) reporters were transiently transfected into human 293 cells, initially with expression plasmids for Gal4-DBD fusion proteins containing either a strong activation domain, derived from the Herpesvirus VP16 protein (Gal4-VP16), or a relatively weak activation domain corresponding to a mutant derivative of Gal4-VP16, “Gal4-SW6” (37Walker S. Greaves R. O'Hare P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5233-5244Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) (refer to Fig. 1B, legend). RNA isolated from the transfected cells was analyzed by RNase protection using probes for detection of splicing or 3′-end cleavage (Fig. 1B, refer to Fig. 1A), as well as a probe for detection of a pol III VA-RNA (refer to “Experimental Procedures”), which served as an internal control for transfection efficiency and RNA recovery. Primer extension analysis, and RNase protection with an antisense probe spanning the transcription start site of the dsx reporters, were also performed to assess whether initiation occurred at the correct position (Fig. 1E and data not shown). Ratios of spliced to unspliced and cleaved to uncleaved RNA, as well as transcript levels, were routinely determined from three independent transfection experiments. In addition to stimulating transcription greater than 10-fold (as determined by summation of unspliced and spliced bands) compared with Gal4-SW6, Gal-VP16 also resulted in approximately a 4-fold higher ratio of spliced:unspliced RNA and a similar higher ratio of cleaved:uncleaved RNA of the Gal5HIV2dsx(+ESE) pre-mRNA (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 4 and 6; refer also to the bar graph in Fig. 1C, which represents quantification of the data in Fig. 1B as well as three separate experiments analyzing Gal4-VP16, Gal4-SW6, and additional activators described below). Gal4-VP16-dependent stimulation of splicing and 3′-end cleavage, by ∼5- and 6-fold, respectively, was also observed in the absence of the ESE (compare Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 5; refer also to data shown in Fig. 1C). The differences in levels of splicing and cleavage resulting from activation of transcription by Gal4-VP16 versus Gal4-SW6 was not because of differential stability of transcripts. Actinomycin D chase experiments revealed no difference in the half-life of unspliced or spliced transcripts generated by these activators (data not shown). To investigate whether other activators can influence pre-mRNA processing, we next tested Gal4 fusions containing activation domains from the HIV-1 Tat transactivator (TAT), c-Myc Far upstream element binding protein (FBP) and p53 tumor suppressor protein (Fig. 1C). Compared with each other as well as to Gal4-VP16 and Gal4-SW6, each activation domain resulted in a different level of splicing and 3′-end cleavage of the Gal5HIV2dsx(+/–ESE) substrates, as well as different transcript levels. The highest levels of splicing and cleavage were observed consistently with strong activation domains, derived from p53 and VP16, whereas lower levels were observed with relatively weak activation domains derived from SW6, TAT, and FBP (refer to the bar graph in Fig. 1C). Splicing and cleavage levels paralleled each other and varied by as much as 18-fold between the different transactivation domains. Independent of the specific activator used to drive transcription, the presence of an ESE consistently stimulated splicing (∼4-fold) and 3′-end cleavage (∼five to 10-fold) (compare bar graphs in Fig. 1C). Thus, irrespective of which activator is used to drive transcription, splicing and cleavage levels are closely coordinated. However, the particular activator used to drive transcription, independently of the presence of an ESE, markedly affects the level of splicing and cleavage of a transcript. Transcriptional Activators Influence 3′-End Cleavage in the Absence of Splicing—We next determined whether the Gal4 activators can modulate 3′-end formation in the absence of splicing (note: because splicing is prevented in the absence of cleavage on the dsx pre-mRNA (31McCracken S. Lambermon M. Blencowe B.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 148-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), it was not possible to determine whether activators modulate splicing independently of cleavage for this substrate). Each Gal4 activator was expressed with an intronless version of the Gal5-HIV2dsxΔInt(+ESE) pre-mRNA reporter and RNase protection assays were performed to measure cleavage levels (Fig. 1D). Analysis with the 3′-end protection probe revealed that different activators resulted in cleavage levels of the intronless substrate that were similar to those observed with the intron-containing reporter (compare lanes 1–5); Gal4-VP16 was the exception, resulting in even greater stimulation of cleavage of the intronless reporter (compare data in Fig. 1, D and C). Thus, transcriptional activators can modulate 3′-end cleavage levels in the absence of splicing. Transcripts Generated by Different Activators Are Accurately Initiated—The activator-dependent changes in splicing and 3′-end cleavage efficiency were not a consequence of altered initiation of transcription. The 5′-ends of RNAs generated by Gal4-SW6 or VP16-activated transcription of the Gal5HIV2dsx(+ESE) reporter were mapped by primer extension (Fig. 1E, refer to A). Initiation was only detected at the expected position (Fig. 1E, compare lanes 2 and 3). Analysis of the 5′ ends of transcripts generated by each Gal4 activator by RNase protection, using an antisense probe spanning the transcription start site, also showed that initiation occurred at the correct position and not at spurious upstream sites (data not shown). Thus, the different levels of splicing and 3′-end cleavage observed with each activator are not a consequence of altered transcription initiation. Promoter-bound Activators Influence Splicing and Cleavage Levels Independently of Transcript Levels—None of the activators described above resulted in a significant change in the level of splicing or cleavage of the dsx reporter transcripts when driven by an adenovirus major late (Ad2ML) promoter that lacks Gal4 binding sites (data not shown; see also Fig. 4). Moreover, the increased levels of splicing and cleavage were not an indirect consequence of the increased levels of transcripts. For example, splicing and cleavage were more efficient when the dsx(+/–ESE) pre-mRNAs were transcribed from the Ad2ML promoter that, compared with the Gal4-VP16-activated Gal5HIV2 promoter, produced ∼10-fold lower levels of transcripts (Fig. 1C, -fold activation of transcription and splicing/cleavage levels are indicated). Furthermore, VP16 and p53 activation domains resulted in similar levels of splicing and cleavage stimulation of the dsx pre-mRNAs, but VP16 consistently yielded at least 2-fold higher levels of transcripts than p53. To further establish whether the level of splicing and cleavage of reporter transcripts reflects the type of activator used to drive transcription, rather than the specific level of transcripts produced, we determined whether the efficiency of splicing and cleavage is altered when Gal4-VP16 is expressed at reduced levels (Fig. 2). Reducing Gal4-VP16 expression to an extent where transcript levels are less than Gal4-SW6-activated levels did not significantly alter the ratios of spliced to unspliced RNA, or cleaved to uncleaved RNA (Fig. 2 and data not shown). These results demonstrate that the higher levels of splicing and cleavage resulting from Gal4-VP16 compared with the Gal4-SW6-activated transcription reflect an intrinsic functional property of the VP16 activation domain rather than an indirect consequence of its activity in promoting increased transcript levels. A Role for the Pol II CTD in Mediating Activator-dependent Stimulation of Splicing and Cleavage—The experiments described so far suggest that strong activators could result in increased recruitment of pre-mRNA processing components to promoters, thereby facilitating more efficient processing of the transcripts that are subsequently produced. If this is the case then it is possible that recruitment operates in a manner that is dependent on the pol II CTD, which has been shown previously to facilitate splicing and 3′-end cleavage (refer to Introduction). To investigate whether increased pre-mRNA processing levels dependent on a strong activator is mediated by the CTD, we compared splicing and cleavage levels of the Gal5HIV2dsx(+ESE) pre-mRNA transcribed by α-amanitin-resistant and FLAG epitope-tagged derivatives of pol II, with or without a CTD, and when activated with either Gal4-VP16 or Gal4-SW6 (Fig. 3). Immunoblotting confirmed similar levels of expression of these pol II derivatives (data not shown). Consistent with a previous report (38Liao S.M. Taylor I.C. Kingston R.E. Young R.A. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2431-2440Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), full levels of Gal4-VP16-activated transcription required the CTD (Fig. 3, lanes 7–9). Whereas deletion of the CTD did not have a pronounced effect on the level of splicing or cleavage of transcripts generated by the Gal4-SW6 activator, Gal4-VP16 resulted in approximately a 4-fold increase in splicing and a 6-fold increase in cleavage that was dependent specifically on the CTD (Fig. 3, compare lanes 6 and 9 with 5 and 8; refer to adjacent bar graphs). This indicates an important role for the CTD in mediating the increased splicing and cleavage levels that are specifically dependent on a strong activator. Activator-dependent Stimulation of Splicing Occurs on Unrelated Transcripts—To establish whether the increased level of dsx pre-mRNA processing observed with strong versus weak activators reflects a more general effect of activators on pre-mRNA processing, we next determined the influence of activator-stimulated transcription on the splicing of an unrelated pre-mRNA reporter, containing sequences from the constitutively spliced human α1-globin gene, which contains two introns (Fig. 4). This reporter, which also has an HIV2 promoter and five upstream Gal4 DNA binding sites, contains an alternative EDI exon and flanking constitutive exonic sequences from the human fibronectin gene downstream of the α1-globin minigene (pSVEDaGal5HIV2, see Fig. 4A) (24Cramer P.

Consistent with the results observed with the dsx pre-mRNA reporters, when transcription was driven by the Gal4-VP16 and Gal-p53 activators, splicing of α1-globin introns 1 and 2 was stimulated by approximately 8- and 4-fold, respectively, compared with when transcription was driven by the Gal4-SW6, -TAT, and -FBP activators (Fig. 4B, refer to the adjacent bar graph). Because there was a Gal4-VP16- and Gal4-p53-dependent increase in splicing of both α1-globin introns 1 and 2, it is possible that the effects of activators on splicing is not an indirect consequence of any effects they may have on 5′-end cap formation, as well as effects they have on 3′-end cleavage, because intron 2 is spatially (and most likely temporally) separated from these 5′- and 3′-end processing steps (see “Discussion” below). Moreover, the increased splicing levels were not an indirect consequence of expression of the activators. As observed for the dsx pre-mRNA reporter, expression of the different activators did not alter splicing efficiency of the α1-globin introns when the reporter was transcribed from a promoter lacking Gal4 DNA binding sites, in this case the native α1-globin promoter (Fig. 4C, compare lanes 1–6). The results with the α1-globin pre-mRNA reporter therefore indicate a more direct and general role for activators in modulating pre-mRNA processing levels. Our results establish for the first time a role for transcriptional activators in controlling constitutive splicing and 3′-end cleavage levels. In particular, we provide evidence that there is a parallel relationship between the strength of a promoter-bound activator and the efficiency of constitutive splicing and 3′-end cleavage. These findings extend recent studies in which the effect of different promoters and activators on pre-mRNA processing was studied specifically in the context of alternative splicing regulation (24Cramer P.

Blencowe, unpublished observation. This effect was attributed to an altered elongation rate of pol II (27Nogues G. Kadener S. Cramer P. Bentley D. Kornblihtt A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43110-43114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 39Kadener S. Fededa J.P. Rosbash M. Kornblihtt A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8185-8190Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In contrast, we show that strong activators promote increased levels of splicing of the constitutive α1-globin introns in this reporter, as well as the ESE-independent levels of splicing of the dsx pre-mRNA reporter. Thus, stronger activators can result in an increased level of splicing of introns for unrelated transcripts and for different constitutive introns within a transcript. Moreover, we also show for the first time that activator strength can determine the efficiency of 3′-end processing and that this function of activators can occur independently of splicing. Thus, our results provide evidence that an additional and possible general role for transcriptional activators is the stimulation of constitutive splicing as well as 3′-end cleavage. The splicing stimulatory property of a strong activator occurs independently of the total levels of transcripts produced, yet requires the CTD of pol II. An attractive possibility is that activators result in increased pre-mRNA processing levels by recruiting pre-mRNA processing factors to promoters. These pre-mRNA processing factors could be recruited by activators directly or indirectly, for example, via association with a pol II holoenzyme. Association of these factors with the pol II CTD during transcription elongation would then facilitate the assembly of splicing and 3′-end processing complexes on nascent transcripts. Consistent with this model, several reports have described interactions between pre-mRNA processing factors and transcriptional activators (40Lai M.C. Teh B.H. Tarn W.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11832-11841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), coactivators (41Ge H. Si Y. Wolffe A.P. Mol.

RNA. 2002; 8: 1102-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that increased splicing and cleavage levels promoted by transcriptional activators is the consequence of increased recruitment of pre-mRNA processing components to promoters. It is also interesting to speculate that the increased level of splicing and 3′-end cleavage may be due, at least in part, to increased levels of 5′-end cap formation resulting from activator-dependent transcription. For example, formation of a cap-binding complex is known to stimulate the splicing of cap-proximal introns, as well as 3′-end processing of intronless transcripts (44Izaurralde E. Lewis J.

Future work will be directed at determining the mechanism(s) by which activators modulate pre-mRNA processing levels. We conclude that the efficiency of multiple steps in gene expression, including transcription, splicing, and 3′-end cleavage, is determined in part by the strength of promoter-bound activator(s). Such a mechanism may be important to ensure the efficient processing of increased levels of transcripts generated by strong transcriptional activators. We thank J. Ingles, A. Cochrane, M. Downey, A.

To further define the pathways and molecular mechanisms for water movement across hepatocytes, we directly assessed osmotic water permeability (Pf) and activation energy (Ea) in highly purified, rat hepatocytes basolateral membrane vesicles (BLMV) and canalicular membrane (CMV) vesicles by measuring scattered light intensity using stopped-flow spectrophotometry. The time course of scattered light for BLMV and CMV fit well to a single-exponential function. In BLMV, Pf was 108 ± 4 μm·s–1 (25 °C) with an Ea of 7.7 kcal/mol; in CMV, Pf was 86 ± 5 μm·s–1 (25 °C) with an Ea of 8.0 kcal/mol. The AQP blocker, dimethyl sulfoxide, significantly inhibited the Pf of both basolateral (81 ± 4 μm·s–1; –25%) and canalicular (59 ± 4 μm·s–1; –30%) membrane vesicles. When CMV were isolated from hepatocytes treated with dibutyryl cAMP, a double-exponential fit was needed, implying two functionally different vesicle populations; one population had Pf and Ea values similar to those of CMV from untreated hepatocytes, but the other population had a very high Pf (655 ± 135 μm·s–1, 25 °C) and very low Ea (2.8 kcal/mol). Dimethyl sulfoxide completely inhibited the high Pf value in this second vesicle population. In contrast, Pf and Ea of BLMV were unaltered by cAMP treatment of hepatocytes. Our results are consistent with the presence of both lipid- and AQP-mediated pathways for basolateral and canalicular water movement across the hepatocyte plasma membrane barrier. Our data also suggest that the hepatocyte canalicular membrane domain is rate-limiting for transcellular water transport and that this domain becomes more permeable to water when hepatocytes are exposed to a choleretic agonist, presumably by insertion of AQP molecules. These data suggest a molecular mechanism for the efficient coupling of osmotically active solutes and water transport during canalicular bile formation.

AQP9, an aquaglyceroporin, resides exclusively on the basolateral plasma membrane of hepatocytes and may facilitate the movement of water and certain small solutes (Ref. 5Elkjaer M. Vajda Z.

Our previous studies using isolated hepatocytes suggest that under basal (non-stimulated) conditions, water transport across hepatocyte plasma membranes occurs mainly via a non-AQP-mediated, diffusional pathway (5Elkjaer M.

This situation is due to the very low canalicular membrane expression of AQPs in resting, non-stimulated hepatocytes. However, upon stimulation of hepatocytes with a secretegogue (e.g. cAMP), intracellular AQP8 is redistributed to the canalicular plasma membrane, thereby increasing the cell surface water permeability (6Garcia F.

To directly define the pathways and molecular mechanisms for osmotic water transport in hepatocytes, we examined the water transport properties of the individual hepatocyte canalicular and basolateral plasma membrane domains using highly purified hepatocyte membrane vesicles. Membrane water permeability coefficients and activation energies were determined using stopped-flow spectrophotometry, a well established method that makes use of the dependence of scattered light on vesicle volume to quantitate the time course of net water flow in response to transmembrane osmotic gradients (14Benga G. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1989; 114: 273-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Isolation and Treatment of Rat Hepatocytes—Highly purified (>98%) rat hepatocytes were isolated from livers of male Fisher rats as described (15Seglen P.O. Methods Cell Biol. 1976; 13: 29-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (5190) Google Scholar). Briefly, livers were perfused with oxygenated Hepes buffer solution containing 0.02% EGTA (Sigma) to remove blood cells and then transferred to a temperature-controlled chamber at 37 °C and perfused with an Hepes buffer solution containing 0.45 mg/ml Collagenase D (Roche Applied Science). Following perfusion, hepatocytes were gently removed from the biliary tree by mechanical disruption and filtered twice through 40-μm nylon mesh. Hepatocytes were purified further by isopycnic centrifugation through a discontinuous Percoll gradient (Amersham Biosciences). Viability was greater than 90% as assessed by trypan blue exclusion. Cells were suspended in Krebs-Ringer-HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, in the presence of 0 or 100 μm dibutyryl cAMP (DBcAMP) for 10 min at 37 °C, washed, and frozen until the preparation of plasma membrane fractions. Isolation of Canalicular and Basolateral Hepatocyte Plasma Membranes—Canalicular and basolateral plasma membranes were prepared from freshly isolated hepatocytes as described previously by us (16Tietz P.S. Holman R.T. Miller L.J. LaRusso N.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5436-5443Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 17Marinelli R.A. Tietz P.S. Pham L.D. Rueckert L. Agre P. LaRusso N.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G280-G286PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, hepatocytes were washed and sonicated in 0.3 m sucrose containing 0.01% soybean trypsin inhibitor, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 mm leupeptin (Sigma). The plasma membrane fraction was obtained by centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 60 min on a discontinuous 1.3 m sucrose gradient. This membrane fraction was further subfractionated by high speed centrifugation through discontinuous sucrose gradients to obtain two subfractions enriched in either canalicular or basolateral hepatocyte plasma membrane domains. Hepatocytes exposed to DBcAMP and corresponding controls were processed in parallel; the protein membrane yields did not differ between groups. The purity and cross-contamination of the membranes, assessed using canalicular and basolateral marker enzymes, were similar to those observed previously by us (11Huebert R.C. Splinter P.L.

Protein concentration was determined by the fluorescamine method using bovine serum albumin as standard (18Udenfriend S. Stein S. Bohlen P. Dairman W. Leimgruber W. Weigele M. Science. 1972; 178: 871-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (2185) Google Scholar). Vesicle Size Measurements—To determine the size of vesicles, electron micrographs were taken on a Jeol electron microscope. Pellets of membrane vesicles were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in a 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), treated with 1% OsO4, and washed with the same phosphate buffer. After dehydration and embedding in Epon, thin sections were stained with uranyl and lead citrate. Size measurements were made on micrographs at ×30,000 magnification using the software Image-Pro Plus (Media Cybernetics). The software was set to select objects (i.e. vesicular structures) in the range of 50–500 nm. Stopped-flow Measurements—The time course of vesicular volume was followed from changes in intensity of scattered light at the wavelength of 450 nm using an Applied Photophysics SX.18MV stopped-flow reaction analyzer which has a 1.3-ms dead time and 99% mixing efficiency in <1 ms. The sample temperature was controlled by a circulating water bath. To perform the experiments, 50 μl of a concentrated vesicle suspension was diluted into 450 μl of 50 mm sucrose and 5 mm HEPES-Tris, pH 7.4 (buffer A). One of the syringes of the stopped-flow apparatus was filled with the membrane suspension, whereas the other was filled with the same buffer containing increasing amounts of sucrose to establish a hypertonic gradient upon mixing. The final protein concentration after mixing was 150 μg/ml. Immediately after applying a hypertonic gradient, water outflow occurs, and the vesicles shrink, causing an increase in scattered light intensity. The data were fitted to either single or double exponential functions. The osmotic water permeability coefficient (Pf) was calculated as described (19van Heeswijk M.P. van Os C.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1986; 92: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 20Verkman A.S. Weyer P. Brown D. Ausiello D.A. J. Biol.

The medium osmolarity was measured by freezing point depression, using an Advanced Micro Osmometer 3300 (Advanced Instruments, Inc.). In some experiments, before the stopped-flow experiments, vesicles were incubated for 5 min with 500 mm dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), an established aquaporin water channel blocker (6Garcia F.

Water Permeability of Hepatocyte Basolateral and Canalicular Membrane Vesicles— Fig. 1 shows the electron micrographs of hepatocyte basolateral and canalicular membrane vesicles. The vesicles had a similar appearance, displaying somewhat irregular shapes and showing a lack of contamination by other hepatocyte organelles. Mean basolateral vesicle diameter was 166 ± 2 (S.E.) nm (n = 1664), and mean canalicular vesicle diameter was 159 ± 1 (S.E.) nm (n = 1757). Osmotic water permeability was measured by a stopped-flow method in which vesicles were subjected rapidly (<1 ms) to a hypertonic osmotic gradient. The time course of vesicle volume was followed from the change in scattered light. Fig. 2 shows the time course of osmotic water transport in hepatocyte basolateral and canalicular plasma membrane vesicles in response to hypertonic osmotic gradients obtained by adding sucrose to the external buffer. No change in scattered light was observed when vesicles were mixed with isosmotic buffer, showing an absence of mixing artifacts. There was a time-dependent increase in the amplitude and rate constant of the scattered light with increasing osmotic gradients (Fig. 2). Data fit well to a single exponential function for all gradients, indicating the presence of functionally homogeneous populations of basolateral and canalicular vesicles. Pf values at 25 °C, calculated from the kinetic data and the size of the vesicles, were 115 μm·s–1 for the basolateral vesicles and 90 μm·s–1 for the canalicular vesicles. Pf values were independent of the size of the osmotic gradient except at very high osmotic gradients (400 mosm) when there was a slight decrease in basolateral and canalicular Pf (about 13%), possibly because of mechanical restrictions to vesicle shrinkage.Fig. 2Time course of osmotic water transport in hepatocyte basolateral and canalicular plasma membrane vesicles at 25 °C. Vesicles in buffer A (see “Materials and Methods”) were mixed with an equal volume of the same buffer containing increasing amounts of sucrose to give the indicated hypertonic gradients.

Fig. 3 shows a marked increase in the rate of osmotic water transport when vesicles were subjected to the same osmotic gradient at increasing temperatures. Fig. 3 (bottom panel) summarizes these data in the form of an Arrhenius plot; Table I shows the calculated Pf values at different temperatures and the corresponding Ea .Table ITemperature dependence of osmotic water permeability in hepatocyte basolateral and canalicular plasma membrane vesiclesTemperatureBasolateral PfCanalicular Pfo Cμm·s-1μm·s-137179151251159112675754641Activation energykcal/molkcal/mol7.78.0 Open table in a new tab Water Permeability of Hepatocyte Basolateral and Canalicular Vesicles from DBcAMP-treated Hepatocytes— Fig. 4 shows the typical tracings of a time course of scattered light intensity (water transport) in response to a 200 mosm hypertonic sucrose gradient in basolateral and canalicular vesicles from hepatocytes in the basal state or treated previously with DBcAMP. The scattered light from BLMV ± exposure to DBcAMP and untreated CMV increased progressively and reached a plateau representing data that fit to a single-exponential curve function and suggest a rather homogeneous vesicle population. Data for basolateral vesicles showed a slow exponential increase in osmotic water transport with a Pf value of 71 ± 10 μm·s–1, whereas DBcAMP treatment did not modify basolateral Pf. A similar Pf was observed for canalicular vesicles from untreated hepatocytes (86 ± 5 μm·s–1) (Fig. 4). In contrast, the course of scattered light from CMV +DBcAMP showed a markedly faster rise in slope and increase in initial intensity and fit to a double-exponential curve function representative of two functionally non-homogeneous vesicle populations. Indeed, when we performed calculations based only on the early portion of the time course (0–100 ms), we found a 6-fold higher Pf value of 491 ± 81 μm·s–1. Together, analysis of the kinetics of water transport indicated that the fractional DBcAMP-dependent rapid component was 0.25; i.e. roughly 25% of canalicular vesicles have an 8-fold higher Pf value than the rest of the vesicles. A weighted Pf (Fig. 4) was calculated using the low and high Pf values and their percentages of contribution to the total, i.e. weighted Pf = (low Pf × 75 + high Pf × 25)/100. Also, pretreatment of hepatocytes with DBcAMP markedly reduced the canalicular Ea from 8.0 to 2.8 kcal/mol but had no effect on Ea for basolateral vesicles. Together, these data suggest a DB-cAMP-induced specific alteration in hepatocyte canalicular membranes, which, based on our previous work (11Huebert R.C. Splinter P.L. García F. Marinelli R.A. LaRusso N.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22710-22717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), reflects the isolation of two functionally different subpopulations of vesicles derived from the canalicular membrane, likely reflecting one with and one without newly inserted AQP8 molecules. Effect of Me2SO on the Water Permeability of Hepatocyte Basolateral and Canalicular Plasma Membrane Vesicles— Fig. 5 shows the effect of the aquaporin blocker, Me2SO, on the time course of osmotic water transport of hepatocyte basolateral and canalicular vesicles and the corresponding calculated Pf , respectively. The weighted Pf was used for the DBcAMP-treated canalicular vesicles. Basolateral and canalicular Pf values were inhibited by 25 and 30%, respectively, whereas DBcAMP-induced canalicular Pf was completely blocked. The major findings in this study relate to the properties of hepatocyte plasma membrane domains influencing transcellular water transport and the molecular mechanisms of canalicular bile secretion. Using an established technique to assess biophysical properties of membranes, we found that: (i) hepatocyte canalicular and basolateral plasma membrane domains differ in their permeability coefficients but not their activation energies; (ii) an inhibition of AQPs diminished the permeability coefficients of both membrane domains; and (iii) exposure of isolated hepatocytes to a choleretic agonist (i.e. DBcAMP) increased the Pf and lowered the Ea of canalicular but not basolateral membrane vesicles. These data extend our previous observations that AQP8 is redistributed to the canalicular hepatocyte membrane in response to a secretagogue and demonstrate directly an agonist-induced selective increase in the Pf of the canalicular membrane domain. The data support the importance of both diffusion and channel-mediated water transport in canalicular bile secretion. To our knowledge, this is the first study to measure Pf and Ea in isolated hepatocyte basolateral and canalicular plasma membrane domains. Although our previous studies in single hepatocytes and in polarized hepatocyte couplets have yielded valuable information about the mechanisms of hepatocyte water transport in these cells (6Garcia F. Kierbel A. Larocca M.C. Gradilone S.A. Splinter P. LaRusso N.F. Marinelli R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12147-12152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 11Huebert R.C.

Chem. 2002; 277: 22710-22717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), pitfalls in studying water flow across intact cells are unstirred layers, time resolution of flow measurements, and membrane area amplification. These problems can be circumvented when osmotic flows are measured across isolated membrane vesicles with stopped-flow spectrophotometry because volume flows are monitored continuously with time resolution <1 ms, and osmotic flows are related to real membrane area without interference of unstirred layers. The disadvantage of this approach is that vesicle populations may be non-homogeneous in size and composition. In this study, the size analysis based on electron microscopy and image processing showed reasonably homogeneous vesicle preparations with respect to size. Moreover, the optical signal from basolateral and canalicular vesicles fit well with one exponential function, indicating homogeneity in size and in water permeability. Hepatocyte basolateral and canalicular Pf values were higher than those of a tissue thought to have a predominant lipid solubility diffusion mechanism for water permeation (i.e. small intestine with Pf values about 60 μm·s–1) (19van Heeswijk M.P. van Os C.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1986; 92: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), but lower than a tissue with very high flow, AQP-mediated water transport (i.e. kidney cortex with Pf values of 300–600 μm·s–1) (19van Heeswijk M.P. van Os C.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1986; 92: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 24Verkman A.S Ives H.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 250: F633-F643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Ea is generally >10 kcal/mol for water movement by a lipid solubility diffusion mechanism, e.g. Ea for small intestine is 13.3 kcal/mol (19van Heeswijk M.P. van Os C.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1986; 92: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), whereas Ea is <6 kcal/mol for water movement through aqueous channels, e.g. Ea for kidney cortex is 1.0 kcal/mol (19van Heeswijk M.P. van Os C.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1986; 92: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The high Ea for water movement through lipids is thought to be related to the formation and breaking of hydrogen bonds as water moves from the aqueous to lipid phases and back to the aqueous phase. Relatively high Ea values like those for hepatocyte membrane water permeation (i.e. ∼8 kcal/mol) may be due to a relatively low number of channels present in the lipid matrix or to water movement through narrow channels in which significant interactions can occur. This is consistent with the recently reported very low single water permeability of basolateral AQP9 water channels (25Carbrey J.M. Gorelick-Feldman D.A. Kozono D. Praetorius J. Nielsen S. Agre P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2945-2950Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) and with the low surface expression of canalicular AQP8 (6Garcia F. Kierbel A. Larocca M.C.

Thus, the Pf and Ea values obtained for hepatocyte basolateral and canalicular membranes suggest the presence of both lipid- and AQP-mediated pathways for water movement. The sensitivity of basolateral and canalicular water transport to the AQP inhibitor Me2SO also supports the contribution of AQP water channels to hepatocyte water movement. Although the exact mechanism by which Me2SO exerts its action has not yet been determined, at a concentration of 500 mm, Me2SO blocks AQP-mediated water transport in kidney brush border membrane vesicles (21van Hoek A.N de Jong M.D. van Os C.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1030: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) without affecting water transport by lipid solubility diffusion (21van Hoek A.N de Jong M.D. van Os C.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1030: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In addition, we have successfully used Me2SO to block aquaporin-mediated water transport in hepatocytes (6Garcia F. Kierbel A. Larocca M.C. Gradilone S.A. Splinter P. LaRusso N.F. Marinelli R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12147-12152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 11Huebert R.C. Splinter P.L. García F. Marinelli R.A. LaRusso N.F. J. Biol.

Biochem. 2002; 302: 104-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Me2SO was also found to specifically inhibit the aquaporin-associated increase in osmotic membrane water permeability of aquaporin-transfected cells (22Ma T. Frigeri A. Tsai S.T. Verbavatz J.M. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22756-22764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In our previous studies, we found that mercuric chloride, another potent inhibitor of AQPs, was toxic to hepatocytes at doses required to inhibit AQPs; since the mechanism of toxicity is unknown, and to avoid any possibility of mercuric chloride damage to hepatocytes vesicles, we chose Me2SO as an alternative. After treatment of hepatocytes with DBcAMP, the osmotic water transport for canalicular vesicles showed a bi-exponential time course consistent with a functionally heterogeneous vesicle population. A double-exponential fitting requires the presence of at least two distinct populations of vesicles, whereas multiple parallel pathways for water transport in one vesicle type would give a single additive water permeability response (20Verkman A.S. Weyer P. Brown D. Ausiello D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20608-20613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, a portion of canalicular vesicles from DBcAMP-treated hepatocytes showed a fast exponential increase with a very high Pf (655 μm·s–1), most likely reflecting a population of vesicles derived from the canalicular membrane that contain the agonist-induced increase in AQP8 molecules. AQP8-expressing hepatocytes are able to redistribute the AQP water channel to the canalicular plasma membrane (11Huebert R.C. Splinter P.L. García F. Marinelli R.A. LaRusso N.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22710-22717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In agreement with this finding, the Ea for water permeation was markedly lower (2.8 kcal/mol) after DBcAMP treatment. These data agree well with our previous results that choleretic secretagogues such as DBcAMP induce the redistribution of AQP8 in hepatocytes from intracellular vesicles to the canalicular plasma membrane (11Huebert R.C. Splinter P.L. García F. Marinelli R.A. LaRusso N.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22710-22717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Another interesting finding of this study is that in the basal or non-stimulated state, the canalicular plasma membranes had a Pf value ∼20% lower than that of basolateral membranes. In addition to a differential membrane domain expression of AQPs, this finding may reflect the higher cholesterol content of canalicular membranes (26Meier P.J. Sztul E.S. Reuben A. Boyer J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 991-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), which is known to reduce water permeability in liposome systems (27de Gier J. Benga G. Water Transport in Biological Membranes: From Model Membranes to Isolated Cells. Vol. 1. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1989: 77-98Google Scholar). The lower canalicular Pf value suggests that this membrane domain is the rate-limiting step for basal, diffusional transcellular water transport in hepatocytes. Moreover, the fact that cAMP-stimulated canalicular targeting of AQP8 markedly increases the water permeability of the canalicular membrane suggests that this membrane is rate-limiting for stimulated, channel-mediated, water transport as well. We recently reported that AQP blockers completely abolished osmotic water transport in isolated polarized rat hepatocyte couplets (11Huebert R.C. Splinter P.L. García F. Marinelli R.A. LaRusso N.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22710-22717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) consistent with the importance of transcellular osmotic water flow in canalicular bile secretion. Transcellular Pf can be calculated from the basolateral and apical Pf values after correction for membrane folding factors (24Verkman A.S Ives H.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 250: F633-F643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as has been done for kidney proximal tubular epithelia in which basolateral and apical membrane folding factors have been estimated to be 36 and 20, respectively (24Verkman A.S Ives H.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 250: F633-F643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Assuming similar membrane area amplifications for hepatocyte membranes, we estimated a transcellular hepatocyte Pf value of 0.22 and 0.31 cm·s–1 for resting and DBcAMP-treated hepatocytes, respectively. Corresponding estimates for rat kidney proximal tubule, in which water flow seems to be entirely transcellular (24Verkman A.S Ives H.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 250: F633-F643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Schnermann J. Chou C.L. Ma T. Traynor T. Knepper M.A. Verkman A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9660-9664Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), is of the same order of magnitude, being reported to be 0.38 cm·s–1 (24Verkman A.S Ives H.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 250: F633-F643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, bearing in mind both the assumptions and the approximate nature of this calculation, our results support a major role for a transcellular pathway for hepatocyte water transport (i.e. canalicular bile secretion) under stimulated conditions. In conclusion, our results suggest the presence of both lipid- and AQP-mediated pathways for basolateral and canalicular osmotic water movement. They also suggest that the canalicular plasma membrane domain is rate-limiting for transcellular water transport in hepatocytes and that under cAMP-mediated stimulation, this domain becomes highly permeable to water, facilitating transcellular osmotic water transport. This mechanism may be relevant to efficient coupling between osmotically active solute and water transport during canalicular bile formation. We thank Sergio Gradilone for technical assistance."

Methionine can be activated by ATP to give rise to the universal methyl donor, S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet). Previously, a chimeric MTHFR (Chimera-1) comprised of the yeast Met13p N-terminal catalytic domain and the Arabidopsis thaliana MTHFR (AtMTHFR-1) C-terminal regulatory domain was constructed (Roje, S., Chan, S. Y., Kaplan, F., Raymond, R. K., Horne, D. W., Appling, D. R., and Hanson, A. D. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 4056–4061). Engineered yeast (SCY4) expressing Chimera-1 accumulated more than 100-fold more AdoMet and 7-fold more methionine than the wild type. Surprisingly, SCY4 showed no appreciable growth defect. The ability of yeast to hyperaccumulate AdoMet was investigated by studying the intracellular compartmentation of AdoMet as well as the mode of hyperaccumulation. Previous studies have established that AdoMet is distributed between the cytosol and the vacuole. A strain expressing Chimera-1 and lacking either vacuoles (vps33 mutant) or vacuolar polyphosphate (vtc1 mutant) was not viable when grown under conditions that favored AdoMet hyperaccumulation. The hyperaccumulation of AdoMet was a robust phenomenon when these cells were grown in medium containing glycine and formate but did not occur when these supplements were replaced by serine. The basis of the nutrient-dependent AdoMet hyperaccumulation effect is discussed in relation to homocysteine biosynthesis and sulfur metabolism.

The basis of the nutrient-dependent AdoMet hyperaccumulation effect is discussed in relation to homocysteine biosynthesis and sulfur metabolism. Folate derivatives, which are present in virtually every known organism and cell type, mediate one-carbon (C1) transfers that play essential roles in several key cellular processes. Folate-dependent one-carbon metabolism is necessary for the syntheses of purines, thymidylate, formylmethionyl-tRNA, glycine, serine, and methionine (1Blakley R.L. The Biochemistry of Folic Acid and Related Pteridines. North-Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam1969Google Scholar, 2Matthews R.G. Blakley R.L. Benkovic S.J. Folates and Pterins. Vol. 1. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New, York1984: 497-553Google Scholar). Furthermore, many methylated molecules such as nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids are formed by transmethylation reactions with S-adenosylmethionine. This latter compound is synthesized indirectly by a folate-dependent pathway (Fig. 1) and is second only to ATP as the most abundantly used cofactor in metabolic reactions. In addition to serving as a methyl group donor, the propylamine group of decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine can be used in the synthesis of spermidine from putrescine; donation of a second propylamine group results in the formation of spermine.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae expresses two isozymes of MTHFR encoded by the MET12 and MET13 genes (3Raymond R.K. Kastanos E.K. Appling D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 372: 300-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The methyl group of CH3-THF is transferred to homocysteine in the synthesis of methionine. Methionine can be incorporated into proteins, but the bulk of it is activated by ATP to generate S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet). AdoMet is a high energy sulfonium compound that is utilized in the majority of biological methylation reactions (4Clarke S. Banfield K. Carmel R. Jacobsen D.W. Homocysteine in Health and Disease. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK2001: 63-78Google Scholar). The other product of AdoMet-dependent methylation is S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy), which is rapidly hydrolyzed by AdoHcy hydrolase, encoded by the yeast SAH1 gene (5Hansen J. Johannesen P.F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2000; 263: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Homocysteine regenerated by this reaction can re-enter the methyl cycle or participate in the transulfuration pathway to synthesize cysteine. Because homocysteine is the central component in methyl group biogenesis, the synthesis and metabolism of this nonprotein amino acid is tightly controlled. Coordinated regulation of the re-methylation and transulfuration pathways is important in determining the intracellular fate of homocysteine. AdoMet plays an important role in the regulation of these two competing pathways by inhibiting MTHFR (6Kutzbach C. Stokstad E.L.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 250: 459-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 7Jencks D.A. Matthews R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2485-2493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Roje S. Chan S.Y.

AdoMet also activates cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) in mammalian cells (9Finkelstein J.D. Martin J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9508-9513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but this regulation is absent in yeast (10Maclean K.N. Janosik M. Oliveriusova J. Kery V. Kraus J.P. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2000; 81: 161-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 11Jhee K.H. McPhie P. Miles E.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10548-10556Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, AdoMet is required for full cysteine-mediated transcriptional regulation of sulfur assimilation genes (5Hansen J. Johannesen P.F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2000; 263: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Therefore, regulation by AdoMet would potentially prevent the unnecessary use of activated C1 units and limit the buildup of homocysteine. Elevated levels of homocysteine in human plasma or urine are indicative of a deficiency in the re-methylation or transulfuration pathways and can be detrimental to human health. However, it is not clear if homocysteine is directly pathogenic. In fact, recent studies with S. cerevisiae suggest that AdoHcy may be the causative agent (12Christopher S.A. Melnyk S. James S.J. Kruger W.D. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2002; 75: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The MTHFR encoded by MET13 has been shown to be NADPH-dependent and inhibited by AdoMet in vivo (8Roje S.

This physiologically irreversible reaction commits the methyl group carried by THF to methionine synthesis (13Vanoni M.A. Matthews R.G.

Diekert G. Arch. Microbiol. 1991; 155: 378-381Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Therefore, the regulation of MTHFR is crucial for C1 metabolism in all organisms because the MTHFR reaction has the potential to trap folates in the methylated form (16Appling D.R. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2645-2651Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 17Herbert V. Zalusky R. J. Clin. Invest. 1962; 41: 1263-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 18Bagley P.J. Selhub J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13217-13220Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). An excessive accumulation of CH3-THF may be detrimental to the de novo synthesis of nucleic acids that use non-methylated folates as substrates. A metabolically engineered yeast strain (SCY4) expressing an AdoMet-insensitive, chimeric yeast-plant MTHFR (Chimera-1) is able to accumulate greatly elevated pools of methionine and AdoMet (8Roje S. Chan S.Y. Kaplan F. Raymond R.K. Horne D.W. Appling D.R. Hanson A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4056-4061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Although the folate pool is enlarged, the distribution of folate derivatives in SCY4 is not shifted toward the CH3-THF derivative (8Roje S. Chan S.Y. Kaplan F. Raymond R.K. Horne D.W. Appling D.R. Hanson A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4056-4061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In the present study it is demonstrated that the hyperaccumulation of AdoMet is detrimental to yeast if the excess AdoMet cannot be sequestered in the vacuole using polyphosphate as a cationic exchanger. Furthermore, it is shown that the transulfuration pathway plays a vital role in regulating AdoMet biosynthesis. Materials—General chemicals of the highest grade commercially available were obtained from Sigma or Fisher. The high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) of AdoMet and AdoHcy used 1-heptanesulfonic acid from Sigma and Spherisorb® 5-μm ODS2 columns supplied by Waters Corp. (Milford, MA). Quinacrine dihydrochloride was purchased from Acros Organics (Fisher), and acid-washed glass beads were from Sigma. Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized and purified by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA).

The resulting diploids were sporulated by incubation on presporulation medium at 30 °C for 2 days followed by transfer to minimal sporulation medium supplemented with leucine and uracil and incubation for 5–7 days at 24 °C. Tetrads were incubated in 200 μl of sterile H2O, 2 μl of 1 m 2-mercaptoethanol, and 3 μl of 10 mg ml–1 lyticase (Sigma) at 30 °C for 6–8 min and dissected using a Zeiss Tetrad microscope system (Carl Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, NY). Desired haploids were selected based on nutritional requirements and PCR analysis. The polyphosphate mutants DAY4pop and SCY4pop were constructed by gene replacement. Genomic DNA was isolated by the method described by Hoffman (19Hoffman C.S. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology.

The VTC1 locus of Y10212 was amplified by PCR using Taq DNA polymerase and primers 5′-CCCAGGATGCGCCTATATCG-3′ (VTC1-kanMX4-5′) and 5′-AGCGCTTGGTTGTACTACGC-3′ (VTC1-kanMX4-3′). The amplified 2.7-kb fragment containing the 1.6-kb kanMX4 module (20Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2235) Google Scholar) was purified using a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and transformed into the DAY4 and SCY4 strains using lithium acetate (21Gietz R.D. Woods R.A. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2069) Google Scholar). Polyphosphate mutants were identified after isolating genomic DNA from Geneticin-resistant cells and performing PCR analysis of the VTC1 locus using primers 5′-TTAGCACGTGTCTCGGAGAG-3′ (PHM4-5′) and 5′-CTCAGCGTACCATTAGGCCC-3′ (PHM4-3′). The cystathionine β-synthase mutants were constructed by amplifying the URA3 cassette out of pJR-URA3 (22Roca J. Gartenberg M.R. Oshima Y. Wang J.C.

The PCR product was gel-purified using a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen) and introduced into the uracil auxotrophs DAY4 and SCY4. Deletion of CYS4 was confirmed by isolating genomic DNA from uracil prototrophs and performing PCR analysis of the CYS4 locus using primers 5′-TGGCACGTGATAGTAGTGGC-3′ (CYS4-5′) and 5′-CGGTGTCAAGAAATGACGGC-3′ (CYS4-3′) to establish the DAY4cbs and SCY4cbs strains. Growth Studies—The growth of Δvps33 yeast strains was studied by first growing a 5-ml culture in rich medium for 18 h. Overnight cultures were washed twice with 5 ml of sterile H2O, resuspended in 3 ml of sterile H2O, and used to inoculate 10 ml of synthetic minimal medium supplemented with glycine, formate, leucine, histidine, tryptophan, and uracil at an OD600 = 0.05. Cells were grown at 30 °C in a rotary shaker, and the turbidity of the cultures at 600 nm was measured approximately every 2 h with a Hewlett Packard 8452A diode array spectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). Growth rates were calculated using data points in the linear portion of the exponential growth phase. Visualization of Vacuoles—Yeast cells to be labeled with quinacrine were grown to mid-log growth phase in YPAD medium supplemented with 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.6. Quinacrine was added to 1-ml aliquots of cells to a final concentration of 200 μm. After incubation at 30 °C for 5 min, cells were pelleted by centrifugation (15,000 × g, 30 s) and resuspended in 30 μl of YPAD with 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.6, and 1% low melting temperature agarose. Observation of cells at ×100 magnification employed a Zeiss Axioplan microscope equipped with a Universal Arclamp Power Supply XB075 HBO100, narrow band green fluorescent protein filter set (Axio) with excitation at 480 nm and emission at 520 nm with a bandwidth of 10 nm, dichroic mirror at 505 nm, and standard narrow band for eliminating auto-fluorescence. Data were collected as photographs of random fields using a Roper Scientific camera RTE/CCD-1300-Y/HS (Trenton, NJ). Each field was photographed using filters for both Nomarski optics (175-ms exposure time) and epifluorescence (5-s exposure time) and analyzed with MetaMorph Imaging Series software (Universal Imaging Corp., Downingtown, PA). Determination of AdoMet and AdoHcy Pools—Yeast cells were grown in YMD medium supplemented with leucine, histidine, tryptophan, uracil, and either serine or glycine and formate. Cells were harvested in mid-log growth phase and washed with distilled water. To measure the levels of AdoMet and AdoHcy, 300-mg samples of wet cells were resuspended in 500 μl of sterile H2O and lysed by vortexing with glass beads for 5 × 30 s. Protein from clarified lysates was precipitated with ethanol (final concentration of 70%) at –20 °C for 15 min and removed by centrifugation (13,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C). The supernatant was evaporated to dryness in vacuo, and the residue was redissolved in sterile H2O and analyzed by isocratic HPLC (23Wise C.K. Cooney C.A. Ali S.F. Poirier L.A. J. Chromatogr. B. Biomed. Sci. Appl. 1997; 696: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). A Waters Spherisorb® 5-μm ODS2 column (4.6 × 250 mm) was used with a Beckman Coulter® System Gold 126 Solvent Module and 166 Detector (Fullerton, CA) equipped with a Rheodyne 7725i injector (Cotati, CA). The mobile phase, consisting of 50 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm 1-heptanesulfonic acid, and 20% (v/v) methanol, pH 4.4, was pumped through the column during the 17-min run. This chromatographic program was run at a flow rate of 0.8 ml min–1 at 24 °C after a 20-μl sample injection, and the eluate was monitored at 260 nm. Folate Determination—Yeast strains were grown, harvested, and washed as described for AdoMet and AdoHcy determination. Pelleted cells were resuspended in twice their wet weight of extraction buffer (50 mm HEPES, 50 mm CHES, 0.2 m 2-mercaptoethanol, and 2% (w/v) sodium ascorbate, pH 7.85). Glass beads were added at 1.5 times the wet weight of the cell pellet. The samples were heated at 100 °C for 10 min and lysed by vortexing for 4 min. After centrifugation (20,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C), supernatants were decanted, and their volumes were measured and stored at –70 °C until analysis. Folate derivatives were separated by ion-pair reverse phase HPLC and quantified using the Lactobacillus rhamnosus (ATCC 7469) microbiological assay (24Wilson S.D. Horne D.W. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 142: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 25Horne D.W. Patterson D. Clin. Chem. 1988; 34: 2357-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Growth of SCY4 in Medium Supplemented with Serine Versus Glycine and Formate—A yeast strain (SCY4) was previously engineered in which the coding sequence of Chimera-1 replaced the chromosomal MET13 gene in the wild type DAY4 strain (8Roje S.

The growth rates of these two ser1 mutant strains in synthetic minimal medium supplemented with serine, leucine, histidine, tryptophan, and uracil were similar (doubling times, 2.5 ± 0.2 h). When glycine and formate replaced serine in YMD medium, the doubling time of SCY4 (11 ± 0.2 h) was nearly twice as long as that of the wild type strain expressing the native yeast MET13 MTHFR (6.5 ± 0.2 h). Concurrent with the decrease in growth rate, SCY4 accumulates >100-fold more AdoMet than DAY4 in minimal medium supplemented with glycine and formate but not in medium with serine (8Roje S. Chan S.Y.

Intracellular Compartmentation of AdoMet—AdoMet is distributed between the cytosol and the vacuole in yeasts, with up to 80% of cellular AdoMet reported in the vacuoles of wild type cells (26Svihla G. Schlenk F. J. Bacteriol. 1960; 79: 841-849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Schlenk F. Dainko J.L. Svihla G. Arch. Biochem.

The ability of yeast to hyperaccumulate AdoMet was investigated by studying the role of the vacuole in removing excess AdoMet from the metabolically active pool. VPS33, encoding a protein essential in vacuolar morphogenesis and function (29Jacquemin-Faure I. Thomas D. Laporte J. Cibert C. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 244: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), was deleted in DAY4 and SCY4 to establish the vacuole mutant strains DAY4vac and SCY4vac. No vacuoles were present in the vps33 mutants, as observed by labeling the cells with quinacrine (Fig. 2). Cells treated with quinacrine were viewed with Nomarski and fluorescence optics, and identical frames of the same cells were photographed. In SCY4 cells (Fig. 2, A and B), the fluorescent bodies within the cells indicate the presence of vacuoles (Fig. 2B). In contrast, SCY4vac (Fig. 2, C and D) has no vacuoles, as shown by the lack of fluorescence in these cells (Fig. 2D). The growth of the vacuole mutants was studied by first growing them in rich medium and then switching them to synthetic minimal medium containing glycine and formate (with the other required nutrients of leucine, histidine, tryptophan, and uracil), where they would hyperaccumulate AdoMet. The turbidity of the liquid cultures was followed over 3 days (Fig. 3). DAY4vac grew regularly, displaying a very short lag phase and reaching stationary phase at 30 h (Fig. 3A). On the other hand, SCY4vac divided only a few times before growth ceased (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, when SCY4vac was transferred from minimal medium containing serine to that containing glycine and formate, there was an immediate arrest in growth (Fig. 3B). DAY4vac again grew normally under these conditions. The intracellular concentration of AdoMet in the vacuole mutants was studied by growing the cells initially in medium containing serine to mid-log growth phase (OD600 = 2) before switching them to medium supplemented with glycine and formate. After only one cell division, SCY4vac accumulated 6-fold higher levels of AdoMet (309 ± 28 nmol g–1 wet weight) compared with DAY4vac (54 ± 4 nmol g–1 wet weight). Sequestration of AdoMet in Vacuoles—Polyphosphate, which is found almost exclusively in the vacuole (30Urech K. Durr M. Boller T. Wiemken A. Schwencke J. Arch. Microbiol. 1978; 116: 275-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), has been championed to act as a sink for many positively charged molecules, including basic amino acids, divalent cations, and AdoMet (31Kornberg A. Rao N.N. Ault-Riche D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 89-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). VTC1, which is involved in vacuolar polyphosphate accumulation (32Ogawa N. DeRisi J. Brown P.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4309-4321Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), was deleted in DAY4 and SCY4 by gene transplacement (Fig. 4). Polyphosphate synthesis is blocked in vtc1 mutants (32Ogawa N. DeRisi J. Brown P.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4309-4321Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar); growth of these mutants was tested on medium containing glycine and formate (Fig. 5). The wild type strain, DAY4, as well as DAY4pop (“pop,” signifying cells defective in polyphosphate synthesis) and SCY4 all exhibited growth on medium that permits AdoMet hyperaccumulation. However, SCY4pop, which does not have the polyanion but has vacuoles, is not viable on medium with glycine and formate (Fig. 5).Fig. 5Growth of Δvtc1 mutants. DAY4 (MET13 VTC1), DAYpop (MET13 Δvtc1), SCY4 (met13::CHIMERA-1 VTC1), and SCY4pop (met13::CHIMERA-1 Δvtc1) were incubated at 30 °C for 3 days on YMD medium supplemented with glycine, formate, leucine, histidine, tryptophan, and uracil.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Intracellular Folate Levels in Yeast Strains DAY4 and SCY4 —The pools of 10-CHO-THF, THF, and CH3-THF were determined by HPLC combined with microbiological assay (24Wilson S.D.

Chem. 1988; 34: 2357-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) from cells grown in minimal medium supplemented with serine, leucine, histidine, tryptophan, and uracil (Table II). The most abundant folate derivative in both strains was CH3-THF, constituting >85% of the total folate pool. The other coenzymes (10-CHO-THF and THF) each represented <15% of the total folate in both strains (Table II). It is significant that the folate pool expansion in SCY4 over DAY4 in serine-supplemented medium (16.1 nmol g–1 wet weight) can be almost completely accounted for by the CH3-THF derivative alone (Table II).Table IIFolate levels in DAY4 and SCY4 yeast strains grown with serine in mediumStrain10-CHO-THFTHFCH3-THFTotalnmol g-1 wet weightDAY4 (MET13)NDaNot detected.4.125.829.9SCY4 (met13::CHIMERA-1)2.63.739.746.0a Not detected. Open table in a new tab Nutrient-dependent Accumulation of AdoMet—The ability of yeast to hyperaccumulate AdoMet in selective medium was studied by testing the viability of SCY4vac on different media involving combinations of serine, glycine, and formate. Because AdoMet hyperaccumulation restricts the growth of SCY4vac, this represents a simple assay to test for elevated AdoMet content. Of the nine different media examined, two do not permit the growth of SCY4vac, namely media containing glycine and formate (as described above) and formate alone (Table III). Serine or high levels of glycine (100 mg ml–1) can rescue SCY4vac on these two media. Furthermore, a SER1 wild type version of SCY4vac (SCY4vac SER1) was viable and did not hyperaccumulate AdoMet when grown in medium with glycine plus formate (78 ± 2 nmol g–1 wet weight). In medium containing serine, SCY4vac SER1 had 21 ± 1 nmol of AdoMet g–1 wet weight. This suggests that serine may prevent overproduction of AdoMet by regulating the reductive flux of formate through the trifunctional C1-THF synthase ADE3 gene product. Alternatively, serine may deplete homocysteine from the methyl cycle by driving the cystathionine β-synthase reaction toward the synthesis of cystathionine (Fig. 1).Table IIIGrowth of SCY4vac on different mediaMediaGrowthSerineYes5 × Serinea5 × Serine, 1875 mg liter-1.Yes5 × Glycineb5 × Glycine, 100 mg liter-1.YesSerine + glycineYesGlycine + formateNoFormateNoSerine + glycine + formateYesSerine + formateYes5 × Glycine + formateYesa 5 × Serine, 1875 mg liter-1.b 5 × Glycine, 100 mg liter-1.

Quantum chemical calculations reproduced the observed active site crystal structure with severe deviations from standard stereochemistry and indicated the protonation state of the catalytic residues. Multipole refinement directly revealed the charge distribution in the active site and proved the validity of the ab initio calculations. The combined results confirmed the catalytic function of the active site residues and the two water molecules acting as the nucleophile and the proton donor.

Serine proteases are among the most abundant proteins. A large subgroup comprising trypsin and chymotrypsin is called trypsin-like serine proteases. Trypsin cleaves peptides at the C-terminal side of arginine or lysine. Catalysis takes place in a cleft from which a binding pocket (specificity pocket) protrudes into the interior of the enzyme. A catalytic triad (Ser195-His56-Asp99) constitutes the core of the reactive center. For the stabilization of the charges developing on the reaction intermediates during catalysis an oxyanion hole is formed by the main-chain N-H of residues 192–195 in an arrangement known as a nest (1Pal D. Suhnel J. Weiss M.S. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2002; 41: 4663-4665Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The specificity pocket accommodates long, basic amino acid side chains. At its bottom, an aspartate residue forms a tight salt bridge with the substrate. The difference in specificity between various serine proteases is determined by the shape and the width of the specificity pocket (2Lu W. Apostol I. Qasim M.A. Warne N. Wynn R. Zhang W.L. Anderson S.

Proteins. 2002; 47: 357-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Yet several questions remain unanswered. One is the identification of the catalytically active water molecules. Also, the catalytic triad appears to function in different ways in different proteins and display different features, particularly the presence of the so-called short hydrogen bonds (11Frey P.A. Whitt S.A. Tobin J.B. Science. 1994; 264: 1927-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). Trypsin from Fusarium oxysporum shows auto-proteolysis activity even at crystallization conditions. A peptide fragment can always be found in the active site of the crystalline enzyme (12Rypniewski W.R. Ostergaard P.R. Norregaard-Madsen M. Dauter M. Wilson K.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2001; 57: 8-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This together with the fact that its crystals diffract extremely well has made it especially interesting for mechanistic studies and offered an excellent tool for the investigation of the catalytic activity at the electronic level (13Meijers R.

Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 698-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Crystallization—Protein samples of Fusarium oxysporum trypsin were supplied by Novozymes at a concentration of 10 mg/ml. Crystals were grown as described elsewhere (15Rypniewski W.R. Hastrup S. Betzel C. Dauter M. Dauter Z. Papendorf G. Branner S. Wilson K.S. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 341-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), with the pH lowered to 5.0 instead of 6.0 using 100 mm sodium citrate buffer. A combination of streak seeding and macroseeding was applied to initiate nucleation. Crystals grew to a size of 0.3–0.5 mm within a few days. Co-crystallization with the Inhibitor DFP 1The abbreviations used are: DFP, diisopropyl fluorophosphate; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; rmsd, root-mean-square-deviation.—DFP (diisopropyl fluorophosphate, Mw = 184 g/mol) was purchased from Aldrich Chemicals. 5 μl of the inhibitor were dissolved in 250 μl of isopropyl alcohol. 1 μl of this solution was added to a drop containing 10 μl of protein solution and 20 μl of precipitant solution. The approximate molar ratio of inhibitor to protein was 20:1. Co-crystallization with the Inhibitor PMSF—An aqueous stock solution of a concentration of 8 mg/ml PMSF (Mw = 174 g/mol) from Sigma was prepared, and 1 μl of this solution was added to the drops containing 10 μl of protein and 20 μl of precipitant solution. The molar ratio of inhibitor to protein was again 20:1. Nucleation was initiated as for the native crystals in both cases. Soaking—Native trypsin crystals were soaked in a drop containing the precipitant solution at pH 4 for several minutes prior to cryo-freezing. Cryo-freezing Conditions—In previous publications, the cryo-freezing conditions involved a gradual increase of glycerol content in the mother liquor up to 20% (v/v) glycerol (12Rypniewski W.R. Ostergaard P.R. Norregaard-Madsen M. Dauter M. Wilson K.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2001; 57: 8-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Now, we transferred the crystals into light paraffin oil directly from their drops. In order to avoid ice formation, all traces of the mother liquor were carefully removed from the crystal surface by moving it around in the oil drop. Crystals were then flash frozen directly in the cryo-stream at 100 K. Data Collection and Processing—Data were collected on beamlines X11 and X13 at EMBL Hamburg, equipped with MAR CCD detectors, at wavelengths of 0.8110 and 0.8020 Å, respectively. A summary of the data statistics is given in Table I. Data were processed with denzo/scalepack or HKL2000 (16Otwinowsky Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar), intensities were truncated to structure factors using the CCP4 suite of programs (17CCP4Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13712) Google Scholar). Subsequent steps were performed with SHELXL (20Sheldrick G.M. Schneider T.R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 319-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1867) Google Scholar), including the addition of hydrogen atoms and anisotropic B factors, until convergence was reached. Refinement was carried out against diffracted intensities. The same refinement protocol was used for all structures described here. Heterocompounds were introduced in the refinement as early as possible. Occupancies for alternate conformers, and the substrate were set according to their anisotropic atomic displacement parameters (ADP) and individually refined in a last round. Solvent molecules with ADP higher than 60 Å2 were removed; those with ADP higher than 45 Å2 were assigned occupancy of 0.5. Complementary Methods—Ab initio quantum chemical calculations on the pH 4 structure were performed using GAMESS (21Schmidt M.W. Baldridge K.K. Boatz J.A. Elbert S.T. Gordon M.S. Jensen J.H. Koseki S. Matsunaga N. Nguyen K.A. Su S. Windus T.L. Dupuis M. Montgomery Jr., J.A. J. Comput. Chem. 1993; 14: 1347-1363Crossref Scopus (18874) Google Scholar) with a 6–31G** base set and a Hückel model for the construction of the initial molecular orbitals. The active site residues, the substrate and side chains involved in direct contact with the substrate were chosen as the geometrical template. Only relevant parts of the interacting compounds (i.e. atoms at an H-bonding distance) were included in the calculations. The substrate arginine was treated as alanine since only its main chain atoms interacted with the active site. Aspartate 99 was modeled as acetic acid. The system included a total of 64 atoms (265 electrons, with a net charge of–1). Atoms of chemically inert groups not involved in direct contact with the substrate were fixed at their positions. Solvent effects were neglected as the occupied active site is a closed cavity without considerable contact to the solvent space. Hydrogen atoms (at the two water molecules in the active site) were inserted into the structure according to standard stereochemistry and existing H-bonding partners. The following cases were subjected to ab initio quantum chemical calculations: QC1, active site in the native state; QC2, Ser195 de-protonated; QC3, W1 as hydroxyl ion; PMSF, covalently bound. Multipolar Atoms Refinement—The 0.80 Å structure was refined using the charge density refinement program MoPro (20Sheldrick G.M. Schneider T.R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 319-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1867) Google Scholar). The program describes the electron density of the atoms with the Hansen and Coppens model (22Hansen N.K. Coppens P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1978; 34: 909-921Crossref Scopus (1451) Google Scholar), which includes atomic charges, expansion/contraction coefficients, and multipoles. The structure refined with SHELXL was used as the starting model. The charge density parameters were transferred to the structure from our data bank describing the electron density of atoms in proteins (23Pichon-Pesme V. Lecomte C. Lachekar H. J. Phys. Chem. 1995; 99: 6242-6250Crossref Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 24Jelsch C. Pichon-Pesme V. Lecomte C. Aubry A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 1306-1318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein atoms with ADPs higher than 15 Å2 and multiple conformers were considered spherical and were only assigned a charge and a contraction/expansion coefficient. Water molecules were described as a neutral oxygen atom and were refined in conventional manner. The contribution of the bulk solvent to the crystal diffraction was added to the structure factors (25Tronrud D.E. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 306-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 26Fokine A. Urzhumtsev A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

The following weighting scheme was applied to the reflections shown in Equation 2. Whkl=[(4σF)2+(0.02F)2]-1/2(Eq. 2) The three different types of structural parameters were refined in an iterative way until convergence: scale factor with solvent parameters K sol and B sol, atomic coordinates, ADPs. Hydrogen atoms were not refined and their coordinates were constrained according to standard stereochemistry while their isotropic B-factors were set to the B eq of the parent atom. Usual distance restraints were applied on the structure according to the Engh & Huber stereochemical dictionary (target rmsd deviations of 0.02 and 0.05 Å for bond and angle distances, respectively). Despite a considerable degree of disorder in the structures, all of the models refined to crystallographic R factors well below 15%. A summary of the structure refinements is given in Table II. The active site was never empty. In the native cases, an arginine molecule was bound into the specificity pocket with its main-chain atoms located in a good position for catalysis near Ser195. Arginine is the C-terminal residue of a tripeptide, which is the remaining fragment of auto-proteolysis. The substrate tripeptide shows only partial occupancy, which seems to correlate with the occupancy distribution of the multiple conformers in the structure. The arginine lacks the second oxygen atom of its carboxylic group and the C=O distance of 1.48 Å is unusually long. The arginine side chain was observed in at least two conformations, in the pH 4 structure even overlapping with a lysine. Ser195 was always in a single conformation in well defined electron density. Water molecule W2 was located close to the substrate carbonyl oxygen atom in the oxyanion hole. The substrate carbonyl carbon had contacts to W1 (1.87 Å) and Ser195 Oγ (2.05 Å) (Fig. 1), which implies covalent interaction. The geometry around the substrate carbonyl carbon was roughly tetrahedral. No electron density could be found for the N-terminal fragment of the substrate. The water molecules W1 and W2 were fully occupied as opposed to the substrate, which showed partial occupancy with the total ranging from 0.4 (pH 5) to 0.8 (pH 5/borax and pH 4).Table IICrystallographic refinementpH 4pH 5PMSFDFPp H5/boraxResolution1.00.831.231.220.80R (%; all data)12.89.814.114.010.7Number of unique reflections86,663146,83944,08147,457165,882Number of atoms total2,1392,2631,9351,9792,162Number of water molecules330489269265495Overall atomic displacement (all atoms)11.89.216.816.09.4Overall atomic displacement (protein)9.86.615.314.66.7Number of disordered residues4033162714 Open table in a new tab DFP and PMSF were bound covalently to Ser195.

The respective isopropyl and phenyl moieties displayed weaker electron density and did not point into the specificity pocket but in the direction of His56. As an effect, the histidine side chain is statically disordered showing two conformations, one of which is rotated away from the inhibitors thus disrupting the catalytic triad (Fig. 1). In the DFP and PMSF structures, one oxygen atom in the sulfonyl or phosphate groups takes the position of W1, another one the position of W2. Like the other native structures, the pH 5/borax structure also had a peptide bound into the active site. This structure had the highest quality data set and was used for multipole refinement. Co-crystallization with DFP and PMSF changed the space group from P1 to P21 but left the internal protein structure unchanged and the crystal contacts mostly preserved. Disorder and Mobility—One-fifth of the total number of residues of F. oxysporum trypsin shows at least two conformers. Their occupancies relate to the occupancy of the substrate or of the inhibitor side chain. In all the structures except native pH 5, the substrate- or inhibitor-bound state seems to correspond to the protein conformer with higher occupancy, with an average value of 0.65 in all structures. The conformers with corresponding lower occupancy (0.35) correspond to the empty active site. The rmsd for the two visible main chain conformers of disordered residues lies between 1 and 2 Å There was no evidence for the presence of other, intermediate conformational states. Most of the disordered residues are spatially linked to each other. The effect starts in the loops of the active site cleft and is then transferred to the adjacent regions. The patterns of disorder are different for the native and the inhibited structures. The inhibited structures, mimicking a reaction intermediate, show higher anisotropy of the active site residues. In the native structures at pH 4 and pH 5, disorder arises in the specificity pocket, which is not the case in the DFP and PMSF structures where this site is empty. Despite the apparent movement in and around the active site, Ser195 shows only one conformation as mentioned above. An analysis of corresponding conformers showed that there is good correlation between rmsd and ADP in the native structures indicating disorder of mostly dynamic origin. Disorder in the inhibited structure appears to be mostly static. Quantum Chemical Calculations on the pH 4 Structure—A stable match between the crystal structure and the theoretical model could only be achieved under the assumption that the catalytic serine is de-protonated and the attacking water molecule W1 is actually a water molecule and not a hydroxyl ion. In all other cases, the geometry was directed toward either the products of peptide cleavage (QC3) or the covalent intermediate (see Fig. 2 for an overview of the catalytic pathway). This implies that the crystal structure represents a state close to a tetrahedral transition state. Bonds of respective order 0.99 and 0.47 are formed between the substrate C and the Ser195 Oγ and from the substrate C to W1, which is held in place from the other side by His56. His56 is deprotonated and acts as a Lewis base, activating the catalytic water molecule, which is indicated by a strong H-bonding contact of bond order 0.2–0.3. Water molecule W2 in the oxyanion hole forms a very strong H bond to the carbonyl oxygen of the arginine substrate in the model matching the crystal structure. This is accompanied by a high negative charge (–0.99) on the W2 oxygen atom. Multipole Refinement—For the ultra-high resolution structures (pH 5 and pH 5/borax), the protonation state in the active site could be visualized directly in residual electron density maps. His56 was indeed not protonated (Nϵ1 is non-protonated while the hydrogen atom Hδ1 is bound to Nδ2). The multipole charge density parameters were transferred from the data base and Fig. 3A shows the corresponding deformation electron density on the catalytic histidine. The small peak near Nϵ2 indicates the electron lone-pair on the nitrogen atom or a partial protonation (which at this pH would be quite probable), or a rotation of the histidine ring by 180° around the Cβ–Cγ bond. The electrostatic potential derived from the multipoles transfer is shown for the His56-Asp99 interaction (Fig. 3B). Comparison to the Previously Refined Structures—Remnants of the substrate have been observed in the F. oxysporum trypsin structures before (12Rypniewski W.R. Ostergaard P.R. Norregaard-Madsen M. Dauter M. Wilson K.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2001; 57: 8-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Lowering the pH to 5.0 resulted in lower occupancy and higher mobility of the substrate arginine side chain and the disappearance of two of the three water molecules arranged around the arginine carbonyl in the previous structures (12Rypniewski W.R. Ostergaard P.R. Norregaard-Madsen M. Dauter M. Wilson K.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2001; 57: 8-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Only water W1 remained. The structures showed no other significant differences. Mobility in the Crystal—The walls of the active site cleft at the subsites S2, S3 (residues 144–150) are always in double conformation, subsites S2′ and S3′ (residues 93–95) only in the DFP and PMSF structures. This can be understood as an effect of the release of the N-terminal fragment of the substrate (sites S2, S3) and, for the C-terminal part of the active site cleft, adjustments in the positioning of the substrate just before the nucleophilic attack of water W1. In the pH 4 and pH 5 structures, Cys191, Tyr225, and the stretch between amino acids 215 and 220 show main chain double conformations. Cys191 and Tyr225 are part of the wall of the specificity pocket. Cys216 forms a disulfide bridge with Cys191 and hence moves together with it. Apparently, this is related to the binding and release of the substrate arginine side chain, which also shows multiple conformers. Movement upon binding or release is supported by the fact that in the case of the covalently bound inhibitors, which did not reach into the pocket, the specificity pocket was completely rigid. An induced fit model was also supported by interpretation of the structures with inhibitors. In both cases the protein showed two different conformers in the subsites S2, S3, S2′, and S3′, whose occupancies relate to the occupancies of DFP (0.7) and PMSF (0.6). Two important residues involved in this movement are Asp189 and Ser190, both located at the very bottom of the pocket, highly conserved and responsible for the preference of trypsin for basic residues (2Lu W. Apostol I. Qasim M.A. Warne N. Wynn R. Zhang W.L. Anderson S. Chiang Y.W. Ogin E. Rothberg I. Ryan K. Laskowski M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 441-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 3Brandsdal B.O. Aqvist J. Smalas A.O. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1584-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Asp189 forms a strong ion pair with the substrate arginine side chain and its movement as well as the disorder of the other residues in the specificity pocket appears to be induced directly by the substrate. Changes in the substrate position would be transmitted to the catalytic center or vice versa. Re-positioning must occur during the formation and breaking of the covalent bond to Ser195. NMR experiments on complexes showed that neither active site nor specificity pocket is fully pre-formed in the native structures. Only binding to specificity subsites creates an environment suitable for a tetrahedral transition state (27Tsilikounas E. Kettner C.A. Bachovchin W.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12839-12846Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This seems to be the case also in F. oxysporum trypsin, in contrast to the widely accepted lock-and-key model for serine protease substrate binding (28Talhout R. Engberts J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1554-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Increased anisotropy was observed for the residues of the catalytic triad in the inhibited structures. The shape of the thermal ellipsoids of the atoms in His56 and Asp99 indicated movement toward Ser195 and the atoms in Ser195 tend to move perpendicular to the plane formed by Cβ, Oγ, and P or S (Fig. 4). In addition, some residues at sites S2′ and S3′ show considerable shift of one conformer toward the active site, shortening the cleft. This is not observed in the structures with the substrate. We therefore assume that a re-arrangement in the substrate binding region is required before de-acylation. In the covalent intermediate, the Ser195 ester carbonyl can have any orientation (10Topf M. Varnai P. Schofield C.J. Richards W.G. Proteins. 2002; 47: 357-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). It has to be adjusted, fixed, and a water molecule has to approach the covalent intermediate and position itself in a location suitable for catalysis. The water molecule W1 in the pH 4 and pH 5 structures is already at its nucleophilic attack and steric effects might explain why the reaction did not proceed further. Embedding of protein molecules in crystals makes large movement impossible and impedes product release or binding: the active site of trypsin was in principle accessible in the crystals, but it was impossible to bind DFP to the protein by soaking; DFP could not be seen in the active site of trypsin in soaked crystals. This again strongly indicates an induced fit mechanism for substrate binding and the presence of an “open” and “closed” state or an “empty” and “loaded” conformation of the protein molecule. Reaction Partners and Water Molecules—W1, attached to His56, and W2 in the oxyanion hole were the two candidates for participation in catalysis. The role of the water molecule W1 as the nucleophile is easy to see. The location of water molecule W2 in the oxyanion hole seemed at first glance a bit exotic for steric reasons and in view of the commonly accepted direct stabilization of the carbonyl oxygen by the oxyanion hole. However, in the bovine trypsin, a water molecule has been found in the same position (29Singer P.T. Smalas A. Carty R.P. Mangel W.F. Sweet R.M. Science. 1993; 259: 669-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Its proposed role was to protonate the carbonyl oxygen atom of the substrate, to take up the excess electrons and facilitate the shift of electrons toward the oxyanion hole (5Perona J.J. Craik C.S. Fletterick R.J. Singer P.T. Smalas A. Carty R.P. Mangel W.F. Sweet R.M. Science. 1993; 261: 620-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This role was controversial, as this water molecule does not exist in all known serine protease structures. In F. oxysporum trypsin the distance of the substrate carbonyl to W2 is much shorter than expected for even the strongest of H bonds. This is exactly the property that can help facilitate catalysis. In short H bonds, the energy barrier for the proton transfer from one binding partner to the other becomes very small (30Schiott B. Iversen B.B. Madsen G.K. Larsen F.K. Bruice T.C. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12799-12802Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 31Cleland W.W. Kreevoy M.M. Science. 1994; 264: 1887-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). There has been a very lively debate over the influence of “low barrier hydrogen bonds” (30Schiott B. Iversen B.B. Madsen G.K. Larsen F.K. Bruice T.C. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12799-12802Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 32Warshel A. Papazyan A. Kollman P.A. Science. 1995; 269: 102-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 33Cleland W.W.

In these studies, a strong hydrogen bond was defined as of an O–O distance of 2.4 Å, while the hydrogen bond between W2 and the substrate carbonyl oxygen atoms is 1.83 Å long. The proton between these two oxygen atoms should be able to fluctuate easily. Ab initio calculations show that the bond order to the carbonyl oxygen is 0.82 (see Table III). This means that the proton has almost been transferred from the water molecule to the substrate. The hydrogen atoms of the water molecules W1 and W2 were not seen in the electron density maps.Table IIIQuantum chemical calculationsQC 1QC 2QC 3CrystalDistances (Å)Ser195 Oγ-Arg C2.292.05n/a2.05Arg C-Arg O1.141.471.201.48W1 O-Arg C1.801.871.311.87W1 O-His56 Ne22.652.922.062.76W2 O-Arg O2.511.831.861.83R.m.s.d. to the crystal0.240.070.47structureBond ordersSer195 Oγ-Arg C0.000.990.00Arg C-Arg O1.791.071.63W1 O-Arg C0.700.471.05W1 H2-His56 Nϵ20.370.210.05W2 H1-Arg O0.050.820.06ChargesArg C0.8240.9390.809Arg O-0.550-0.541-0.656Ser195 Oγ0.856-0.668-0.791W2 O-0.744-0.990-0.757W1 O-0.700-0.720-0.637 Open table in a new tab Quantum Chemistry—The QC2 theoretical model matching the crystal structure shows the most extreme charge distribution as compared with the other models. The structure is close to a tetrahedral transition state. Its stability can be attributed mostly to the capability of the water molecule in the oxyanion hole to take up a large excess of electrons. It achieves that by attachment to the carbonyl oxygen via a very strong H bond with bond order 0.82. As the bond order between the shared hydrogen atom and the W2 oxygen atoms is only 0.11, the water molecule should be pictured rather as a HO––H+-O– arrangement at an extremely close distance with the internal structure of the water molecule maintained. In the other models (QC1 and QC3), W2 remains a water molecule with strong internal bonds and external H bridges of normal strength. This indicates that, after the nucleophilic attack of W1, W2 regains its original state and functions as the Henderson water is supposed to function (29Singer P.T. Smalas A. Carty R.P. Mangel W.F. Sweet R.M. Science. 1993; 259: 669-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The QC3 model corresponds to the end-state of peptide cleavage, step 5 in Fig. 2. W1 has been identified before in crystal structures (4Wilmouth R.C. Edman K. Neutze R. Wright P.A. Clifton I.J. Schneider T.R. Schofield C.J. Hajdu J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 29Singer P.T. Smalas A. Carty R.P. Mangel W.F. Sweet R.M. Science. 1993; 259: 669-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) but its chemical state was never clear. Quantum chemical calculations show that W1 performs its nucleophilic attack as a water molecule. When a hydroxyl ion was input into the calculations, the system was immediately converted into the products and the arginine pushed out of the active site. This is understandable as a hydroxyl ion is among the hardest nucleophiles. Its proximity to a carbon carrying a positive partial charge would naturally result in immediate attachment, excluding the chance to observe such a state in a crystal structure. Our results show that not only one, but both water molecules are catalytically active at the same time. Electronic Details Revealed at Ultra-high Resolution—The beauty of ultra-high resolution protein crystallography is that one can attain electronic detail by crystallography alone (34Lamzin V.S. Morris R.J. Dauter Z. Wilson K.S. Teeter M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20753-20755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). At ultra-high resolution the individual atoms in a molecule can no longer be considered spherical. The presence of lone-pair and bonding electrons has then to be directly included into the refinement. The electron density in the active site of the ultra-high resolution trypsin structures shows that His56 is definitely deprotonated. Because of a relatively high thermal motion on the Ser195 Oγ, the electron density cannot give evidence for an attached proton on this side chain. However, the serine 195 Cβ–Oγ distance is 1.22 Å (pH 5-borax structure), which is significantly smaller than the standard protonated serine Cβ–Oγ distance of 1.417 ± 0.020 in the Engh and Huber (35Engh R.A. Huber R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 392-400Crossref Scopus (2533) Google Scholar) stereochemistry dictionary. This implies the following. First, the pKa of His56 is lower than 6.5. This is already hinted at by the presence of enzymatic activity under crystallization conditions despite a basic pH optimum and proves that His56 acts as a general base. A rotation of the imidazole ring by 180° could play a role in the substrate binding and product release steps. Second, Ser195 is de-protonated as well and is capable of covalent attachment to the substrate. And third, the assumptions made on the protonation state in the active site were correct and therefore the ab initio calculations have produced a realistic model. Implications for Catalysis and Conclusions—Using the atomic resolution structures and the results from the ab initio calculations, it could be shown directly that trypsin de-acylation does occur via a tetrahedral intermediate with subsequent hydrolysis in true SN2 fashion. The water molecule W1 is the obvious candidate to perform hydrolysis, while the preparation for this step is performed by W2 by protonating the carbonyl oxygen. Despite the requirement for W1 to carry a negative partial charge in order to perform a nucleophilic attack, complete de-protonation does not occur. Its attachment to the substrate and proton abstraction is concerted. The lowered pKa of His56 explains why the enzyme was still active in the crystallization solution. The fact that the His56 side chain swings out upon contact with the inhibitors implies that the catalytic triad is not rigid and tight. The inhibitors are larger than the substrate intermediate and remove the water molecules W1 and W2 from their normal positions. Therefore, no activator (W2) and no nucleophile (W1) for hydrolysis are present. Hence, with their modifications (fluorine instead of oxygen and therefore strong withdrawal of electrons), the inhibitors have triple effect. Ab initio calculations on the PMSF structure (result not shown) yielded a charge distribution around the Ser195 Oγ similar to the native, which indicates that inhibitors are good models for the tetrahedral intermediates. F. oxysporum trypsin is a dynamic enzyme, in which substrate binding and product release involves an induced fit mechanism and where the “loaded” and “empty” states can be structurally distinguished. Atomic and ultra-high resolution crystal structure determination and ab initio quantum chemical calculations have now become indispensable tools for comprehensive structure interpretation, acquiring snapshots along the reaction pathway and the assignment of function to the residues involved in catalysis. The motion of the macromolecule in the crystal structure, revealed from the anisotropic atomic displacement parameters, complements the time-average structural picture with dynamics thus opening a new prospective in the structure-functional analysis of biological processes.

Previous mutational studies from our laboratory and others have shown that the regions in transmembrane domain 1 (M1) and pre-M1 of α and β subunits in GABA receptors are essential for positive modulation of GABA binding and function by the intravenous (IV) general anesthetics. Mutation of β2Gly-219 to Phe corresponded in ρ nearly eliminated the modulatory effect of IV anesthetics in α1/β2/γ2S combination. However, the general anesthetics retained the ability to directly open the channel of mutant G219F, and the apparent affinity for GABA was increased, and desensitization rate was reduced. In this study, we made additional single mutations such as 219 Ser, Cys, Ile, Asp, Arg, Tyr, and Trp. The larger side chains of the replacement residues produced the greatest reduction in enhancement of GABA currents by IV anesthetics at clinical concentrations (Trp > Tyr = Phe > Arg > Asp > Ile > Cys > Ser = wild type). Compared with a 2–3-fold response in wild type, pentobarbital and propofol enhanced less than 0.5-fold; etomidate and alphaxalone modulation was reduced from more than 4- to 1-fold in G219F, G219Y, and G219W. A linear correlation was observed between the volume of the residue at position 219 and the loss of modulation. An identical correlation was found for the effect of modulation on left-shift in the GABA EC50 value; furthermore, the same rank order of residues, related to size, was found for reduction in the maximal direct channel-gating by pentobarbital (1 mm) and etomidate (100 μm) and for increased apparent affinity for direct gating by the IV anesthetics.

Considerable evidence supports the hypothesis that general anesthesia can be produced, at least in part, by enhancing neuronal inhibition mediated by GABAA receptors (GABAR). 1The abbreviations used are: GABAR, γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptor; GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid; GABAA, γ-aminobutyric acid type A; LGIC, ligand-gated ion channel; M1–4, transmembrane domain 1–4; PB, Pentobarbital; cRNA, capped mRNA; nAChR, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; IV, intravenous. GABA and most volatile and general intravenous (IV) anesthetics bind to GABAR. These are ligand-gated channels that enhance the flow of chloride ions (Cl–) into the postsynaptic neuron, thus increasing its resting potential and making it less likely to fire, i.e. the inhibitory effect in GABA synapses. GABAR are modulated positively by a wide variety of structurally diverse general anesthetics (1Olsen R.W. Toxicol. Lett. 1998; 100: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In particular, volatile anesthetics (2Harris B.D. Wong G. Moody E.J. Skolnick P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 363-367PubMed Google Scholar, 3Longoni B. Olsen R.W. Adv. Biochem.

Smith S.S. Neurosteroid Effect in the Central Nervous System: The Role of GABAA Receptor. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL2003: 47-61Google Scholar), all enhance the function of GABAR at clinically relevant concentrations. In addition, IV and volatile anesthetics can activate GABAR directly in the absence of GABA (11Yang J. Isenberg K.E. Zorumski C.F. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 914-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Anesthetics appear to allosterically modulate ligand-gated ion channel (LGIC) receptor function by binding to the receptor itself, but not at the agonist-binding site, and to affect the conformation of the membrane protein in a functional manner. Exactly how such modulatory sites affect agonist-regulated channel opening is a major contemporary question in pharmacology and neurobiology. Obviously, the structure and function of these integral membrane proteins, including GABAR, are sensitive to the membrane environment and its molecular constituents. The mammalian GABAR is a heteropentameric complex formed by 19 different glycoprotein subunits (α1–6, β1–3, γ1–3, δ, ϵ, θ, π, and ρ1–3) that co-assemble to form a chloride channel (12Whiting P.J. McKernan R.M. Wafford K.A. Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 1995; 38: 95-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 13Macdonald R.L. Olsen R.W. Annu. Rev.

Most GABAR in vivo are composed of pentameric complexes of 2α,2β, and 1γ subunits. GABAR are members of the LGIC receptor superfamily and share significant amino acid sequence homology with other members (15Ortells M.O. Lunt G.G. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 16Corringer P.J. Le Novere N. Changeux J.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 431-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). Each subunit in the superfamily has a similar proposed three-dimensional structure and membrane topology, with four membrane-spanning α-helical domains, M1–M4. The M2 transmembrane domain of all five subunits contributes to the channel wall and determines ion permeability, whereas the N-terminal extracellular domain determines the ligand binding specificity. In the pentameric complex of GABAR, there are two putative GABA-binding pockets at the interfaces of α and β subunits. Amino acids that participate in ligand binding have been identified by photoaffinity labeling and sequencing, as well as by site-directed mutagenesis (17Smith G.B. Olsen R.W. J. Biol.

In contrast to other members of the LGIC superfamily, ρ subunit GABA receptors are insensitive to nearly all anesthetic compounds, including propofol, barbiturates, volatile anesthetics, and steroid anesthetics (38Mihic S.J.

Chimeras, domain-swapping, and point mutations comparing ρ and non-ρ subunits allowed us to identify areas required for IV anesthetic modulation within pre-M1 and M1 regions and the identification of specific amino acid residues within α and β that seem to be necessary for modulation of GABAR by IV general anesthetics. The current study further examines our demonstration (43Carlson B.X. Engblom A.C. Kristiansen U. Schousboe A. Olsen R.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 474-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 44Engblom A.C. Carlson B.X. Olsen R.W. Schousboe A. Kristiansen U. J. Biol.

Additional experiments were performed to test what sort of alterations these specific mutations at β2Gly-219 produced on modulation and direct activation by IV general anesthetics. A preliminary report of this work has appeared (45Chang C.S. Olcese R. Olsen R.W. J. Neurochem. 2003; 85: 47Google Scholar). Molecular Cloning—Rat α1, β2, and γ2S GABA receptor subunit cDNAs are in the expression vector pBlueScript II SK. For mutants of the β2 subunit in the mature rat protein sequence used in this study, a glycine at position 219 substituted by serine, cysteine, isoleucine, aspartate, arginine, tyrosine, and tryptophan were generated by recombinant PCR using overlapping complementary oligonucleotide methods designed to create a 20-bp overlap at the desired amino acid mutation region. Using a β2 sense oligonucleotide and an antisense oligonucleotide 5′-TGTTTCTTTTCAGCTTAAAACTTAGGGA-3′ with β2 cDNA as a template, upstream PCR fragments with deletion of a HindIII site without changing the amino acid residue at position 219 were generated. Simultaneously, by using a sense junction oligonucleotide with a single mutation 5′-TCCCTAAGTTTTAAGCTGAAAAGAAACATTTTCTACTTCATCCTG-3′ (for example, G219F) and an antisense oligonucleotide after the termination codon with β2 cDNA as template, downstream PCR fragments with a single mutation were also prepared in separate PCRs. Upstream and downstream PCR fragments were then combined and amplified to create the full-length β2 cDNA fragments that were subcloned into pBlueScript II SK vector for expression in Xenopus oocytes. All mutants were verified by restriction digest (Hind-III used for the first mutation screen, XhoI and NotI used for the orientation of ligation) and double-stranded DNA sequencing using standard techniques. Expression of Rat GABAA Receptors in Xenopus Oocytes—Capped mRNA (cRNA) transcribing for the wild type and mutant subunits was synthesized by in vitro transcription from ApaI-linearized cDNA construct in pBlueScript II SK using the mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion). cRNA concentrations were calculated by UV absorption and corroborated by comparison to RNA standards on 1% agarose RNA HEPES gels. Oocytes from Xenopus laevis were prepared as described previously (46Gordey M. DeLorey T.M. Olsen R.W. Epilepsia. 2000; 41: S25-S29Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and injected with a total volume of 50 nl of cRNA (100–200 pg/nl/subunit) mixed in a ratio of 1:1:2 (α1:β2:γ2S). Oocytes were maintained in 6-well plates at 17–19 °C in SOS solution (in mm, 100 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, and 5 HEPES), supplemented with 50 μg/ml gentamycin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and penicillin, and were used for electrophysiological experiments 3–7 days (5–10 days for the better expression of G219R mutant) following injection. The total amount of cRNA was scaled to yield maximal GABA-induced currents of 1.5–2 μA for wild type α1β2γ2S. Two-electrode Voltage Clamp Analysis—Oocytes under a two-electrode voltage clamp (47Zaman S.H. Shingai R. Harvey R.J. Darlison M.G. Barnard E.A. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 225: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) (voltage hold at –70 mV) were gravity-perfused continuously with ND96 recording solution containing (in mm) 96 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, and 5 HEPES, pH 7.4, at an approximate rate of 5 ml/min. In general, drugs and reagents (GABA, Sigma) were dissolved in ND96. Stock drug solutions (50–100 mm) were made in 10% dimethyl sulfoxide and further diluted in the same medium to the desired concentrations. Maximal current amplitude (1.5–2 μA) for all receptors was elicited by a 30-s application of a saturation concentration of 1 mm GABA, which was measured to be a lower concentration (100 μm) in some mutant receptor combinations. A standard two-electrode voltage clamp recording was carried out using an Axoclamp-2A amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) interfaced to a computer with a DigiData 1322-A device (Axon Instruments). Electrodes were filled with 3 m KCl and had a resistance of 0.5–1.5 megohms. By using a standard similar Hill equation to model the GABA dose responses, data acquisition and analyses were performed using pClamp 8.2, Axo-Data, Axo-Graph (Axon Instruments), Excel (Microsoft), and Prism software (GraphPad). Statistical comparisons of potentiation data employed non-linear least square Excel for multiple independent samples and sigmoid curve fitting of dose-response curves using Equation 1, I=Imax/(1+(EC50/[A])n)(Eq. 1) where I is the peak amplitude of the current elicited by a given concentration of agonist [A]; I max is the maximum amplitude of the current; EC50 is the concentration required for half-maximal inhibition, and n is the Hill coefficient. The normalized data are presented as % control to generate concentration-response curves. We calculated that the mutant receptors (G219F: EC50, 15.9 μm; and G219W: EC50, 21.8 μm) show a 3-fold shift in GABA EC50 from wild type receptors (EC50, 45.8 μm). Anesthetic potentiations of GABA were recorded at EC10 GABA. Potentiation is defined as (I (Anes.+GABA) – I (GABA))/I (GABA) in terms of enhancement fold, where I (Anes.+GABA) is the current response in the presence of the anesthetic pre-perfused for 15 s, followed by anesthetics containing EC10 GABA for 30 s by perfusion or by direct application, and washing out the applied drugs for 1.5–2.5 min (a longer washout time is required for etomidate and alphaxalone application). I (GABA) is the control EC10 GABA-induced current. The correlation between anesthetic modulation and residue volume were fitted to the one-phase exponential Equation 2, Ef=E0+ER·expV/t(Eq. 2) where Ef is enhancement fold; E 0 represents the enhancement for residue-occupied “zero” volume; ER is the correlation versus residue volume; V is the residue volume; and t is rate of enhancement. GABA-sensitive Point-mutated Recombinant GABAR—We introduced point mutations Gly-219* located at the entrance of transmembrane domain 1 (M1) into the rat GABAR β2 subunit cDNA (Fig. 1a), including the residue Phe found in the anesthetic-insensitive homomeric ρ1 subunit (GABAC receptor) (Fig. 1b). The Concentration-dependent Responses of Wild Type and Mutant Receptors—The wild type and point-mutated β2 subunit capped mRNAs (cRNAs) were mixed and co-injected into Xenopus oocytes with rat α1 and γ2S (short form) subunit cRNAs. The GABA-induced current could be measured after a 3-day incubation. Remarkably, there were no GABA-induced currents for wild type and G219I in response to 100 nm GABA, but there were for G219R, G219F, and G219W. Compared with 100 μm GABA application, the 1 mm GABA could not induce greater currents for G219F and G219W (in this experiment, rapid desensitization was elicited at a high concentration of 1 mm GABA for G219F and G219W); however, we could observe greater 1 mm GABA-induced currents than 100 μm for wild type, G219I, and G219R (Fig. 2a). The EC50 value of GABA for the wild type receptor α1β2γ2S was 45.8 μm (Fig. 2b), which is similar to the value previously obtained in our laboratory on oocyte expression (46Gordey M. DeLorey T.M. Olsen R.W. Epilepsia. 2000; 41: S25-S29Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The GABA dose-response curve for the α1β2(G219F)γ2 receptor, which has larger aromatic side chain volume, was shifted to the left, with a decreased EC50 value of 15.9 μm, significantly different (a 3-fold shift) from wild type (**, p < 0.001) (Fig. 2b). The Hill slopes of the GABA concentration-response relationships for the point-mutated β2 containing receptors were assumed similarly and obtained the value of 0.72 under running the non-linear least square curve fitting by Excel software. The maximal GABA-induced currents for mutant receptor combinations were less. Theoretically, the fully open probability for maximal channel activation could not be elicited by GABA application alone, so we let the concentration-response curves float to a higher value of 100% to generate the best curve fitting. No spontaneous channel opening was observed in the mutant receptors when applying 50 μm picrotoxin to block the GABA channel (data not shown). Fig. 2b , inset, shows the EC50 values for the wild type and mutant GABAR. The Correlation of EC50 GABA Relative to the Substituted Side Chain Residue Volume at Position 219 of β2 Subunit— Mutation of Gly-219 to large amino acid residues produced a leftward shift in the curves, consistent with an increased apparent affinity for GABA in the mutant receptors (Fig. 2b). The mutant receptors α1β2(Gly-219*)γ2S had EC50 GABA values lower than that for the wild type receptor. In receptors mutated at β2 Gly-219, a strong negative correlation between the EC50 value and the molecular volume size was observed (Fig. 3) (48Krasowski M.D. Harrison N.L. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 129: 731-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The EC50 value for GABA varied over ∼3-fold magnitude. For EC50 GABA, normalized maximal current amplitude was generated as mentioned above, and individually, the variations of EC50 for the wild type and mutant receptors were generated by Prism software (GraphPad). Data for all receptors tested are summarized in Table I. Interestingly, when β2Gly-219 was replaced by negatively charged aspartate which showed a slower desensitization than wild type, conversely, the positively charged arginine showed a much faster desensitization and a slower deactivation than wild type (data not shown).Table IThe characteristics of wild type and mutant GABAA receptor from GABA-induced current dataSubunit combinationEC50EC10Emaxμ m%α1β2γ2S45.8 ± 0.945.03100α1β2(G219S)γ2S39 ± 1.55.0195 ± 12α1β2(G219C)γ2S41 ± 1.55.2281 ± 5α1β2(G219I)γ2S31.9 ± 0.94.52106 ± 8α1β2(G219D)γ2S36 ± 1.24.173 ± 16α1β2(G219R)γ2S24.7 ± 0.73.5574 ± 24α1β2(G219F)γ2S15.9 ± 3.90.9863 ± 13α1β2(G219Y)γ2S18.3 ± 0.51.0155 ± 7α1β2(G219W)γ2S21.8 ± 0.781.1571 ± 5 Open table in a new tab The Effects of Point Mutations on Potentiation of GABA Responses by Pentobarbital and Propofol—To determine whether the mutated amino acid residues influenced the ability of IV general anesthetics at a constant concentration, which would not elicit more than EC5 of maximal GABA current on direct activation by itself, to potentiate GABAR function, the effects of PB and propofol on potentiation of EC10 GABA responses (wild type α1β2γ2S, EC10, 5.03 μm; α1β2(G219I) γ2S, EC10, 4.52 μm; α1β2(G219R)γ2S, EC10, 3.55 μm; α1β2(G219F)γ2S, EC10, 0.98 μm; α1β2(G219W)γ2S, EC10, 1.15 μm) were examined. Fig. 4a , a–e shows the potentiation by PB (10 μm) and propofol (5 μm) of EC10 GABA-induced currents in oocytes expressing the wild type α1β2γ2S receptor (calculated by the following equation: (I (Anes.+GABA) – I (GABA))/I (GABA) as the enhancement fold). GABA responses were greatly enhanced by co-application of either PB (1.9 ± 0.6-fold, n = 32 versus control) or propofol (2.3 ± 0.4-fold, n = 29). When β2Gly-219 was substituted by a large amino acid such as Trp, the mutations at position Gly-219 of β2 subunit nearly eliminated positive modulation (less than 0.5 enhancement fold) by PB and propofol (0.4 ± 0.03- and 0.28 ± 0.08-fold of control value, respectively, Fig. 4b), suggesting that β2Gly-219 is one of the key residues for the modulation of GABAR by IV general anesthetics. On the other hand, greater potentiation by the anesthetics was observed in some β2Gly-219 mutated receptors. For example, α1β2(G219I)γ2S, in which glycine was substituted by the amino acid isoleucine that is smaller than an aromatic group Phe or Trp, both PB and propofol elicited a greater and significant potentiation of EC10 GABA currents (1.2 ± 0.25- and 1.1 ± 0.31-fold of control value, respectively, Fig. 4b). The Effects of Point Mutations on Potentiation of GABA Responses by Etomidate and Alphaxalone—To determine whether the mutated amino acid residues influenced the ability of other IV general anesthetics to potentiate GABAR function, the effects of etomidate and alphaxalone on potentiation of EC10 GABA responses were examined. Fig. 5a , a–d shows the potentiation by etomidate (5 μm) and alphaxalone (0.5 μm) of EC10 GABA-induced currents in oocytes expressing the wild type α1β2γ2S receptor. GABA responses are greatly enhanced by co-application of either etomidate (3.1 ± 0.35-fold, n = 21 versus control) or alphaxalone (3.3 ± 0.4-fold, n = 18). When β2Gly-219 was substituted by a large amino acid such as Trp, the mutations at position Gly-219 of β2 subunit decreased the positive modulation down to less than 1-fold enhancement by etomidate and alphaxalone (0.75 ± 0.09- and 0.7 ± 0.11-fold of control value, respectively, Fig. 5b). On the other hand, greater potentiation by etomidate and alphaxalone such as by PB and propofol was also observed in some β2Gly-219 mutated receptors. Noteworthy, α1β2(G219R)γ2S, in which glycine was substituted by a positively charged Arg, both etomidate and alphaxalone elicited a significantly lower potentiation of EC10 GABA currents (1.1 ± 0.13- and 1.3 ± 0.06-fold of control value, respectively, Fig. 5b), compared with wild type receptor and other non-aromatic group substituted residue combinations. The Correlation of Anesthetic Modulation Relative to the Substituted Side Chain Residue Volume at Position 219 of β2 Subunit—When the α1β2γ2S GABAR β2Gly-219 mutants were tested for modulation by the IV general anesthetics PB and propofol, there appeared to be a limiting volume for the side chains, such that amino acid residues with small side chains such as Gly and Ile demonstrated greater anesthetic potentiation,"

This polypeptide is required for accumulation of the PSII complex. In the present study, we generated an antibody against recombinant mature PsbK of Chlamydomonas and used it in Western blots to localize PsbK in the PSII core complex. PsbK was found in the thylakoid membranes, and purification of the PSII core complex from detergent-solubilized thylakoid membranes showed that PsbK is tightly associated with the PSII core complex. We used potassium thiocyanate to separate PSII into subcore complexes, including the D1/D2/cytochrome b 559 reaction center complex, CP47, and CP43, and we found that PsbK co-purifies with one of the core antenna complexes, CP43, during ion exchange chromatography. Subsequent gel filtration chromatography of the purified CP43 confirmed that PsbK is tightly associated with CP43. Steady-state levels of PsbK were also determined in Chlamydomonas mutants expressing various levels of PSII. Quantitative Western blotting revealed that the levels of PsbK in these mutants are approximately equal to those of CP43, suggesting that PsbK is stable only when associated with CP43 in the chloroplast.

Photosystem II (PSII) 1The abbreviations used are: PSII, photosystem II; RC, reaction center; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; DM, n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside. catalyzes the light-induced transfer of electrons from water to plastoquinone (1Blankenship R.E. Molecular Mechanisms of Photosynthesis. Blackwell Science, London2002: 95-123Crossref Google Scholar). It is a large complex consisting of more than 20 polypeptides and a number of cofactors, including chlorophyll a, pheophytin a, β-carotene, plastoquinone, non-heme iron, and manganese atoms. The reaction center (RC), in which the photochemical reaction occurs, consists of two homologous polypeptides, D1 and D2, encoded by the psbA and psbD genes, respectively. The D1/D2 heterodimer contains all of the redox components involved in photochemical reactions. Cytochrome b 559 is composed of α-and β-subunits encoded by the psbE and psbF genes, respectively, but is not directly involved in the main electron transfer of PSII. The two core antenna complexes, CP43 and CP47, are encoded by the psbC and psbB genes, respectively, and are intimately associated with the reaction center. In addition to these major cofactor-binding subunits, the PSII complex contains extrinsic lumenal polypeptides, which are located in proximity to the O2-evolving manganese cluster and which optimize water-splitting activity. Application of improved SDS-PAGE systems that can resolve small polypeptides together with microsequencing of the N-terminal amino acids has allowed identification of a number of small (<10 kDa) polypeptides in various PSII preparations (2Ikeuchi M. Bot. Mag. Tokyo. 1992; 105: 327-373Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 3Takahashi Y. J. Plant. Res. 1998; 111: 101-111Crossref Google Scholar). Based on their deduced amino acid sequences, most of these small polypeptides contain a single transmembrane helix. These biochemical analyses have revealed not only the presence of the small polypeptides but also their approximate localization in PSII complex. PsbI, PsbT, PsbW, and cytochrome b 559 appear to be bound to RC because they are detected in preparations of the D1/D2 heterodimer (RC complex) (4Lorkovic Z.J. Schroder W.P. Pakrasi H.B. Irrgang K.D.

Other small polypeptides, including PsbH, PsbL, PsbM, and PsbX, are not detected in the RC complex but are found in the PSII core complex, which consists of RC and two core antenna complexes (7Kim S.J. Robinson D. Robinson C. FEBS Lett. 1996; 390: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 8de Vitry C. Diner B.A. Popo J.L. J. Biol.

This suggests that these small polypeptides are only weakly bound to the RC complex or that they are directly associated with CP43 and CP47. PsbK is a small hydrophobic polypeptide of PSII with an apparent molecular mass of ∼4 kDa. This polypeptide is encoded by the chloroplast psbK gene, is synthesized as a precursor with N-terminal extension, and is processed to a mature form (37 amino acid residues) (10Murata N. Miyao M. Hayashida N. Hidaka T. Sugiura M. FEBS Lett. 1988; 235: 283-288Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). How tightly PsbK is bound to PSII complex is controversial. PsbK was first found in the O2-evolving PSII membrane fragment from spinach (10Murata N. Miyao M. Hayashida N. Hidaka T. Sugiura M. FEBS Lett. 1988; 235: 283-288Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar) but was not detected in the O2-evolving PSII core complex (11Ikeuchi M. Takio K. Inoue Y. FEBS Lett. 1989; 242: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that PsbK is loosely bound to the PSII complex and is easily released during solubilization and purification procedures. In contrast, PsbK was detected in the PSII core complex from cyanobacteria (12Koike H. Mamada K. Ikeuchi M. Inoue Y. FEBS Lett. 1989; 244: 391-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (8de Vitry C. Diner B.A. Popo J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16614-16621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating tighter association with the PSII complex. Functional roles of many small PSII polypeptides remain to be elucidated. Disruption of the psbE and psbF genes eliminated accumulation of PSII complex, indicating that they are essential for assembly and/or stability of PSII complex (13Pakrasi H.B. Nyhus K.J. Granok H. Z. Naturforsch. Sect. C. Biosci. 1990; 45: 423-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In addition, some of the small polypeptides (PsbH, PsbI, and PsbL) are required for optimal assembly and/or stability of PSII complex because disruption of their genes significantly reduced the level of the PSII complex (14Anbudurai P.R. Pakrasi H.B. Z. Naturforsch. Sect. C. Biosci. 1993; 48: 267-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 15Ikeuchi M. Shukla V.K. Pakrasi H.B. Inoue Y. Mol. Gen.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1454-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). PsbT, another small PSII polypeptide, has a unique function in the repair of photodamaged PSII (5Ohnishi N. Takahashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33798-33804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Disruption of the psbK gene in cyanobacterium, Synechocystis PCC6803, reduces the steady-state level of PSII to a half of the wild-type level but allows photosynthetic cell growth (18Ikeuchi M. Eggers B. Shen G.Z. Webber A. Yu J.J. Hirano A. Inoue Y. Vermaas W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11111-11115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the cyanobacterial mutants, mutants of the green alga, C. reinhardtii, were not able to grow photosynthetically and possessed a reduced level of PSII (19Takahashi Y. Matsumoto H. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Rochaix J.D. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 24: 779-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Collectively, these studies indicate that PsbK plays an important role in the stability and/or assembly of PSII complex. Recent progress in the determination of the three-dimensional structure of the PSII complex reveals the presence of 22 transmembrane helices in the D1/D2 heterodimer and the two core antenna complexes as well as two transmembrane helices in cytochrome b 559. In addition to these helices found in the major PSII polypeptides, 14 transmembrane helices have been detected in the PSII complex (20Zouni A. Witt H.T. Kern J. Fromme P. Krauss N. Saenger W. Orth P. Nature. 2001; 409: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1776) Google Scholar). These additional helices appear to be contributed by the small hydrophobic polypeptides associated with the PSII complex. However, the presence of the individual helices in the small hydrophobic polypeptides has not clearly been demonstrated because these polypeptides have neither cofactors nor structural characteristics that allow them to be identified. In the present study, we raised an antibody against mature Chlamydomonas PsbK and used it to localize PsbK in the PSII core complex. In addition, we developed procedures to purify the PSII core and subcore complexes. Finally, we took advantage of a collection of Chlamydomonas PSII-deficient mutants to study the roles of the PSII polypeptides in PsbK stability. We found that PsbK is tightly bound to CP43 and that CP43 stabilizes PsbK in vivo. Strains and Growth Condition—In these studies, we utilized the C. reinhardtii wild-type strain 137C, the PSII-deficient mutants, Fud7, nac.2.26, 222E, F34, and Fud44, and the psbK-deficient mutant (ΔpsbK). Cells were grown to mid-log phase (2–5 × 106 cells ml-1) in Tris acetate-phosphate medium at 25 °C (21Gorman D.S. Levine R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 54: 1665-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1303) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Mature PsbK—The region encoding mature PsbK was amplified by PCR using a pair of synthetic oligonucleotides, 5′-CATATGAAACTTCCTGAAGCATAC-3′ and 5′-CATATGTTAACGGAAACTAACAGCTGC-3′ (22Silk G.W. Cruz F.D. Wu M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4930Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). NdeI sites were introduced at both ends of the amplified DNA fragment. The amplified fragment was digested with NdeI and was cloned in the pET3X-c vector at the NdeI site in the right orientation. Expression was induced in Escherichia coli with 1 mm isopropylthio-β-d-galactoside. The recombinant protein was purified by SDS-PAGE according to Ref. 23Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar, eluted electrophoretically from the gel, and injected into rabbits. Western Blotting—Polypeptides from cells or thylakoid membranes were solubilized with 2% SDS and 0.1 m dithiothreitol at 100 °C for 1 min, whereas polypeptides in PSII preparations were solubilized at room temperature for 60 min. Except for PsbK, the polypeptides were separated by urea-SDS-PAGE as described in Ref. 24Takahashi Y. Utsumi K. Yamamoto Y. Hatano A. Satoh K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1996; 37: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar. To improve the isolation of small polypeptides, PsbK was separated by SDS-PAGE according to Ref. 23Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar. Separated polypeptides were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose filters and then probed with specific polyclonal antibodies. The signals were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. A dilution series of total thylakoid polypeptides was used as a calibration standard to estimate the amount of PSII polypeptides in thylakoid membranes. Antibodies raised against D1 and PsaA were kindly provided by Drs. M. Ikeuchi (University of Tokyo) and K. Redding (University of Alabama), respectively. Purification and Dissociation of PSII Complexes—Thylakoid membranes were isolated and purified by discontinuous sucrose density gradient centrifugation as described in Ref. 25Chua N.-H. Bennoun P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 2175-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar. The thylakoid membranes (0.8 mg of chlorophyll ml-1) were solubilized with 0.8% (w/v) n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (DM), and the resulting extracts were fractionated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation as described previously (26Takahashi Y. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Soen S.Y. Franzén L.G. Rochaix J.-D. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2033-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The sucrose gradient contained a linear concentration of sucrose from 0.1 to 1.3 m, 5 mm Tricine-NaOH, pH 8.0, and 0.05% DM. Four green bands were separated after centrifugation at 141,000 × g (SW28, Beckman) at 4 °C for 24 h. The PSII core complex was purified from the PSII-enriched fraction by ion-exchange chromatography with DEAEToyopearl 650S (Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan). Fractions were eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (25–175 mm) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.05% DM. A dilution series of total thylakoid polypeptides was used as a calibration standard. The PSII subcore complexes were dissociated from the PSII core complex by incubation with 0.75 m KSCN and 0.05% DM in the dark at 30 °C for 1 h. Dissociation was terminated by a 90-fold dilution with cold 0.05% DM. The resulting subcore complexes were loaded onto a DEAE column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.05% DM, and fractions were eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (0–200 mm) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.05% DM. Gel filtration chromatography of subcore complexes was performed using a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200pg column (Amersham Biosciences) and fractions were eluted with 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.05% DM, at a flow rate of 1 ml min-1. PsbK Is Associated Exclusively with PSII Core Complex—To localize PsbK in Chlamydomonas cells, we generated an antibody against the mature form of PsbK. Wild-type Chlamydomonas cells were broken with a French pressure cell, and the resulting cell extracts were separated into soluble and insoluble portions by centrifugation. Western blotting revealed that PsbK is present in the pellet, whereas PsbK is not detected in the supernatant (Fig. 1). This indicates that PsbK is located in membrane fraction, consistent with the fact that PsbK is a hydrophobic polypeptide with a putative transmembrane helix. We further found that PsbK is present in thylakoid membranes purified from the pellet by discontinuous sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Although the purified thylakoid membranes may be contaminated by submitochondrial membranes (27Atteia A. de Vitry C. Pierre Y. Popot J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 226-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is very unlikely that the chloroplast-encoded PsbK is translocated from chloroplast into mitochondria. Thus, these results indicate that PsbK is located exclusively in the thylakoid membranes. It has already been reported that the Chlamydomonas PSII core complex contains PsbK (8de Vitry C. Diner B.A. Popo J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16614-16621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is not clear whether all of the PsbK in the thylakoid membranes remains associated with the purified PSII core complex or whether part of the PsbK is released during thylakoid membrane solubilization or purification of the extracts. To examine these possibilities, the thylakoid membranes were solubilized with DM and fractionated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. As shown in Fig. 2A, four green bands were present in the density gradient and were designated as A-1, A-2, A-3, and A-4, starting from the top of the gradient. The polypeptide composition of the fractions was analyzed by SDS-PAGE as shown in Fig. 2B. Band A-1 (fractions 7–11) contained two major proteins of ∼25–30 kDa and therefore corresponds to light-harvesting complex of photosystem II (LHCII). Bands A-3 (fractions 19–21) and A-4 (fractions 24–27) contained PSI polypeptides and therefore correspond to PSI complexes. The PSII core complex was enriched in band A-2. This band also contained PSI polypeptides but fewer than band A-3 (Fig. 2C). Western blotting clearly indicated that PSII polypeptides as well as PsbK are found only in band A-2 (Fig. 2C). Dissociation of PsbK from the PSII core complex was not observed during solubilization and purification, indicating that PsbK is tightly associated with the PSII core complex. Co-purification of PsbK and CP43—Because band A-2 contained not only the PSII complex but also the PSI complex, we fractionated this band by ion-exchange chromatography on DEAE (Fig. 3). The elution profile shows the separation of three peaks (B-1b, B-2, and B-3) and two shoulders (B-1a and B-4). The profile of Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained polypeptides (Fig. 3B) and Western blotting (Fig. 3C) indicated that B-1b and B-2 contain PSI polypeptides, whereas B-3 contains all the major PSII polypeptides. In addition, B-4 contained major PSII polypeptides except for CP43 (fractions 71 and 75) and thus represented CP43-depleted PSII core complex. A small amount of CP43 was released during purification and was separated into B-1a fractions. These results suggest that CP43 is associated with the PSII core complex more weakly than the other major PSII polypeptides. As expected, almost all of the PsbK was detected in B-3, confirming that PsbK is a component of the PSII core complex. However, PsbK was absent from B-4, whereas a small amount of PsbK was detected in B-1a. These observations strongly suggest that PsbK is bound to the dissociated CP43. To investigate the co-purification of PsbK and CP43 in more detail, we analyzed every fraction from 23 to 35 (Fig. 4). We found that the peak for CP43 occurred in fraction 27, whereas that for PsaA was in fraction 32. The elution profile for PsbK was very similar to that for CP43, supporting the idea that PsbK co-purifies with CP43. Association of PsbK with CP43—Our observations suggest the novel finding that PsbK is localized in the PSII subcore complex. To reveal definitely the association of PsbK with CP43, we dissociated the purified PSII core complex into subcore complexes, without releasing free pigments, by using the chaotropic reagent KSCN (5Ohnishi N. Takahashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33798-33804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 28Yamaguchi N. Takahashi Y. Satoh K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1988; 29: 123-129Google Scholar). After treatment of the PSII core complex with 0.75 m KSCN, the subcore complexes were fractionated by ion-exchange on DEAE. The elution profile included three peaks: C-1, C-2, and C-3 (Fig. 5A). Western blotting using antibodies against major PSII polypeptides revealed that C-1 corresponds to CP43, whereas C-2 corresponds to CP47. C-3 contains the PSII reaction center because it consisted of both D1 and D2 but lacked CP43 and CP47 (Fig. 5B). These findings demonstrate that the PSII core complex was completely dissociated into subcore complexes with KSCN. Furthermore, PsbK was only present in C-1 and was not detected in C-2 or C-3. To confirm that PsbK is associated with CP43, we further separated C-1 by gel filtration on Superdex-200pg (data not shown). Gel filtration resulted in a single peak containing CP43 and PsbK, indicating that the CP43 is homogeneous and that PsbK specifically and tightly binds to CP43. The apparent size of CP43 was estimated as 150–170 kDa, suggesting that the CP43 in C-1 may be a dimer because the monomeric CP43 is calculated to be 70 kDa or may be a monomer bound by a significant amount of detergent. PsbK Is Stabilized by CP43—We examined the correlation between PsbK and PSII levels by taking advantage of the large collection of photosynthetic mutants of C. reinhardtii. Deficiency of one of the PSII proteins can affect assembly and/or stability of the whole PSII complex, leading to a decreased amount of the other PSII proteins (3Takahashi Y. J. Plant. Res. 1998; 111: 101-111Crossref Google Scholar). This pleiotrophic effect is observed in the PSII mutants that lack D1 (Fud7) (29Bennoun P. Spierer-Herz M. Erickson J. Girard-Bascou J. Pierre Y. Delsome M. Rochaix J.-D. Plant Mol. Biol. 1986; 6: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), D2 (nac.2.26) (30Kuchka M.R. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. van Dillewijn J. Rochaix J.D. Cell. 1989; 58: 869-876Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), CP43 (F34) (31Rochaix J.D. Kuchka M. Mayfield S. Schirmer-Rahire M. Girard-Bascou J. Bennoun P. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1013-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), CP47 (222E) (32Monod C. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Rochaix J.D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 231: 449-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), or OEE1 (Fud44) (33Mayfield S.P. Bennoun P. Rochaix J.D. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6). D1, D2, and CP47 were not detected in the mutants deficient for these polypeptides, including Fud7, nac.2.26, and 222E. However, CP43 was found at 28–36% of the wild-type level in these mutants (Table I). A similar phenotype was observed in Fud44, which lacks OEE1. In contrast to the other mutants, F34 is deficient in CP43 but still contains D1, D2, and CP47 at 12–16% of the wild-type levels.Table ILevels of PSII polypeptides in Chlamydomonas PSII mutantsStrainsPhenotype% of wild-type levelD1D2CP47CP43PsbKFud7ΔD100031 ± 224 ± 3nac.2.26ΔD200036 ± 443 ± 2222EΔCP47<<10<<10028 ± 731 ± 2F34ΔCP4316 ± 113 ± 212 ± 200Fud44ΔOEE1<<100<<1018 ± 324 ± 4ΔpsbKΔPsbK16 ± 218 ± 115 ± 217 ± 20 Open table in a new tab Interestingly, the level of PsbK in Fud7, nac.2.26, 222E, and Fud44 was 24–43% of the wild-type level, whereas F34 did not contain PsbK. Apparently, the steady-state level of PsbK in the various PSII-deficient mutants was approximately equal to that of CP43. It appears that accumulation of PsbK is dependent on the presence of CP43, or vice versa. As reported previously (19Takahashi Y. Matsumoto H. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Rochaix J.D. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 24: 779-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), the level of PSII polypeptides in ΔpsbK mutants is ∼10% of the wild-type level. In the present study, the amount of PSII in the ΔpsbK mutants was re-evaluated by Western blotting using an antibody against D1. We generated a dilution series of D1 by mixing wild-type cells with Fud7 mutant cells that lack D1, thereby maintaining the concentration of total cellular protein, and used it to create a calibration curve for D1 levels. We estimated that the level of D1 in ΔpsbK mutants is 15–18% of the wild-type level (Table I). We also found that the light-induced O2-evolving activity, measured in the presence of the artificial electron acceptor phenyl-p-benzoquinone, was 10–20% of the wild-type level. Thus, the PSII complex that exists in the ΔpsbK mutant cells is functional. Although there is a significantly reduced level of PSII in ΔpsbK mutants, the steady-state level of the major PSII proteins, D1, D2, CP43, and CP47, is almost identical (Table I). Thus, it can be concluded that PsbK is stable only when associated with CP43. To analyze whether the major PSII polypeptides are assembled into a stable complex in the ΔpsbK mutants, the thylakoid membranes were solubilized with DM and fractionated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation (Fig. 7). The separation pattern was similar to that of the wild type shown in Fig. 2 except that A-2 was reduced and thus separated as a shoulder of A-3. Because A-2 contained both PSI and PSII complexes, the significant reduction in A-2 resulted from the decreased amount of PSII complex. As expected, the major PSII polypeptides, D1, D2, CP47 and CP43, were detected in A-2 (fractions 17 and 19), whereas PSI polypeptide (PsaF) was found in A-2, A-3, and A-4. However, a small portion of CP43 was detected in A-1 (fractions 13 and 15). This suggests that, when PsbK is absent, some CP43 dissociates from the PSII core complex and separates into the upper region of the sucrose gradient due to reduced CP43 binding to the PSII core complex. Alternatively, a small amount of CP43 may remain unbound to the CP47-RC subcore complex in vivo because of reduced efficiency of CP43 assembly into the subcore complex. In support of the latter explanation, we found that there was no increase in CP43 dissociation when the thylakoid membranes were solubilized with higher concentrations (1.0–1.4%) of DM. PsbK Is a New Component of the Core Antenna Complex, CP43—PsbK was first found in an O2-evolving PSII membrane preparation isolated from spinach (10Murata N. Miyao M. Hayashida N. Hidaka T. Sugiura M. FEBS Lett. 1988; 235: 283-288Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). How tightly PsbK binds to the PSII complex has been controversial. PsbK is lost during preparation of O2-evolving PSII core complexes that lack light-harvesting complex of photosystem II (LHCII) but retain high O2-evolving activity (12Koike H. Mamada K. Ikeuchi M. Inoue Y. FEBS Lett. 1989; 244: 391-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This suggests that PsbK binds weakly to the PSII complex. However, PsbK has been detected in Chlamydomonas PSII core complexes that lack extrinsic lumenal polypeptides and O2-evolving activity (8de Vitry C. Diner B.A. Popo J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16614-16621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, a dimeric form of the CP47-RC subcore complex (CP43-deficient PSII core complex) from spinach was found to retain PsbK, suggesting a more tight binding of PsbK to PSII complex (34Zheleva D. Sharma J. Panico M. Morris H.R. Barber J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16122-16127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In the present study, we raised an antibody against mature recombinant PsbK and successfully used it in Western blots to localize PsbK in the PSII core complex. Our results clearly demonstrated that PsbK is present in the thylakoid membranes and co-purifies with the PSII core complex. In addition, we showed that all of the PsbK is specifically associated with CP43. This observation was further supported by the analyses of the various PSII-deficient mutants. Mutants deficient in D1, D2, CP47, or OEE1 contained some of both CP43 and PsbK, whereas the mutant lacking CP43 also lacked PsbK. These findings are novel because small polypeptides have not been reported previously in purified CP43 preparations. Also, transmembrane helices other than the six helices of CP43 were not found in electron microscopic analyses of spinach CP43 microcrystals (35Buchel C. Morris E. Barber J. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 131: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of the cyanobacterial PSII complex determined at 3.8-Å resolution reveals a number of small hydrophobic polypeptides that have a single transmembrane helix (20Zouni A. Witt H.T. Kern J. Fromme P. Krauss N. Saenger W. Orth P. Nature. 2001; 409: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1776) Google Scholar). Two polypeptides of cytochrome b 559 have been localized because they bind the heme. However, it has been difficult to assign the other small polypeptides because they contain neither cofactors nor characteristic structures. Recently, an improved three-dimensional structure of the PSII complex has been determined at 3.7-Å resolution (36Kamiya N. Shen J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). According to this structure, one transmembrane helix with a bend is in close proximity to CP43. This helix was assigned PsbK because it is the only polypeptide that contains Pro in the hydrophobic region, which is expected to form the bend in the transmembrane helix. This observation agrees with our findings that PsbK co-purifies with CP43. Although the monomeric form of the CP47-RC subcore complex from spinach has been reported to lack PsbK, the dimeric form contains PsbK (34Zheleva D. Sharma J. Panico M. Morris H.R. Barber J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16122-16127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This finding is inconsistent with our observations that all of the PsbK co-purifies with CP43. According to the three-dimensional structure of cyanobacterial PSII complex, PsbK is present in the space formed between D2 and CP43 but is located much closer to CP43 than to D2 (20Zouni A. Witt H.T. Kern J. Fromme P. Krauss N. Saenger W. Orth P. Nature. 2001; 409: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1776) Google Scholar, 36Kamiya N. Shen J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). It is unlikely that PsbK is located at a different region in the spinach PSII complex, but it is possible that PsbK is positioned closer to D2 in spinach. If this is the case, the affinity of PsbK for RC could be higher than for CP43 so that PsbK might remain associated to the dimeric form of CP47-RC. However, this is not the case in Chlamydomonas because the CP47-RC subcore complex elutes in B-4, which lacks PsbK. Although it is not known whether CP47-RC is monomeric or dimeric, it is clear that the dissociated CP43 binds PsbK in Chlamydomonas. In contrast to CP43, PSII-RC preparations consisting of D1/D2 heterodimer contain several small hydrophobic polypeptides, including the α- and β-subunits of cytochrome b 559 encoded by the chloroplast psbE and psbF genes (6Nanba O. Satoh K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 109-112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the chloroplast-encoded psbI gene product (9Ikeuchi M. Inoue Y. Plant Cell Physiol. 1988; 29: 1233-1239Google Scholar), and the nuclear-encoded psbW gene product (4Lorkovic Z.J. Schroder W.P. Pakrasi H.B. Irrgang K.D. Herrmann R.G. Oelmuller R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8930-8934Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Recently, Western blotting detected the chloroplast-encoded PsbT in a PSII-RC preparation (5Ohnishi N. Takahashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33798-33804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Two-thirds of PsbT was present in the PSII-RC, whereas the other one-third was released from the PSII-RC. It is not yet clear how tightly PsbI and PsbW are associated with PSII-RC. The three-dimensional structure of the PSII complex suggests an intimate association of additional small transmembrane polypeptides with the D1/D2 heterodimer. Furthermore, several transmembrane helices are present in proximity to core antenna complexes, CP43 and CP47. More intensive characterization of polypeptide composition of the purified CP43 and CP47 preparations and a more detailed analysis of the crystal structure of the PSII complex will be required for full assignment of the small hydrophobic polypeptides in the PSII core complex. Involvement of PsbK in Assembly and Stability of PSII Complex—Assembly of PSII complex is predicted to be a multistep process because a large number of subunits and cofactors must be sequentially integrated into a functional pigment protein complex (37Hippler M. Rimbault B. Takahashi Y. Protist. 2002; 153: 197-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). As described in the present studies and in Ref. 38de Vitry C. Olive J. Drapier D. Recouvreur M. Wollman F.A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 991-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, CP43 levels in Fud7, nac.2.26, 222E, and Fud44 mutants are 28–36% of wild-type levels, whereas D1, D2, and CP47 levels are 12–16% of wild type in the CP43-deficient mutant F34. Nearly stoichiometric levels of D1, D2, and CP47 occur in F34 mutant cells, suggesting that the CP47-RC subcore complex is assembled in the absence of CP43. This possibility is supported by CP47-RC complexes found in psbC deletion mutants of cyanobacteria (39Rögner M. Chisholm D.A. Diner B.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5387-5395Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Our observation that F34, but not the other PSII mutants, lacks PsbK indicates that PsbK is stable when CP43 is present, likely when it is bound to CP43. Therefore, it appears that, after synthesis, PsbK immediately binds to CP43 to form a PsbK-CP43 complex that is subsequently integrated into the CP47-RC subcore complex, thus forming the PSII core complex. If this is the case, assembly of PsbK-CP43 and CP47-RC subcore complexes may occur independently. In the previous report (19Takahashi Y. Matsumoto H. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Rochaix J.D. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 24: 779-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), it was proposed that the absence of PsbK affects the assembly and/or stability of the whole PSII complex because the mutant cells of Chlamydomonas synthesized PSII polypeptides normally but contained only 10–20% of the wild-type level of PSII complex. The PSII complex was stable in the thylakoid membranes isolated from the ΔpsbK cells but was unstable in vivo (data not shown), suggesting that assembled PSII complex lacking PsbK is subject to proteolytic degradation. A structural modification of the PSII complex induced by the absence of PsbK could be recognized by protease(s) in the chloroplast. In addition to the instability of the PSII complex, the absence of PsbK might also affect the assembly of CP43 into the CP47-RC subcore complex. In fact, a small amount of dissociated CP43 was detected on the sucrose density gradient of thylakoid extracts from ΔpsbK. The amount of dissociated CP43 remained constant when the concentration of DM was increased to enhance thylakoid membrane solubilization, indicating that the free CP43 might be derived from unassembled CP43 rather than from partial dissociation from the core complex by detergent. These observations strongly suggest that PsbK located between RC and CP43 may facilitate assembly of CP43 into CP47-RC subcore complex. We also found that the absence of CP43 leads to a significantly reduced amount of PSII complex. Thus, the decreased steady-state level of PSII complex in ΔpsbK cells may be partly due to a defect in this assembly step. Collectively, these results suggest that PsbK affects both the assembly and the stability of the PSII complex."

Whereas UCP1 is uniquely present in brown adipose tissue where it uncouples respiration from ATP synthesis and activates respiration and heat production, UCP2 is present in numerous tissues, and its exact function remains to be clarified. Two sets of data provided the rationale for this study: (i) the intriguing report that UCP1 is present in uterus of mice (Nibbelink, M., Moulin, K., Arnaud, E., Duval, C., Penicaud, L., and Casteilla, L. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 47291-47295); and (ii) an observation that Ucp2(-/-) female mice (homozygous matings) have smaller litters compared with Ucp2(+/+) animals (S. Rousset and A.-M. Cassard-Doulcier, unpublished observations). These data prompted us to examine the expression of UCP1 and UCP2 in the reproductive tract of female mice. Using wild type, Ucp1(-/-) mice, and Ucp2(-/-) mice, we were unable to detect UCP1 in uterus of mice with appropriate antibodies, and we conclude that the signal assigned to UCP1 by others was neither UCP1 nor UCP2. Using a polyclonal antibody against UCP2 and tissues from Ucp2(-/-) mice as controls, UCP2 was detected in ovary, oviduct, and uterus. Expression of Ucp2 mRNA was also observed in ovary and uterus using in situ hybridization analysis. Bone marrow transplantation experiments revealed that the UCP2 signal of the ovary was restricted to ovarian cells. UCP2 level in ovary decreased during follicular growth and increased during the pre-ovulatory period, during which aspects of an inflammatory process are known to exist. Because UCP2 down-regulates reactive oxygen species, a role in the regulation of inflammatory events linked to the preparation of ovulation is suggested.

UCP1, the first member identified, is uniquely expressed in brown adipocytes where it stimulates heat production by uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation (2Nicholls D.G. Locke R.M. Physiol.

Genes encoding homologues of the brown fat UCP1 have been identified in mammals, birds, marsupials and also in plants or fungi (see reviews in Refs. 5Ricquier D. Bouillaud F. Biochem.

Despite the significant homology of these proteins with UCP1 and their apparent uncoupling activity in heterologous expression systems (9Rial E. Gonzalez-Barroso M. Fleury C. Iturrizaga S. Sanchis D.

The phenotypic analysis of Ucp2(-/-) mice indicates that this gene does not play a role in either thermogenesis or the regulation of body fat content but is strongly implicated in the regulation of ROS production (18Arsenijevic D.

In addition, very recent studies support a role of UCP2 in immunity and inflammatory responsiveness (14Pecqueur C. Alves-Guerra M.C. Gelly C. Levi-Meyrueis C. Couplan E. Collins S. Ricquier D.

A recent publication has presented evidence for Ucp1 expression in the longitudinal smooth muscle of uterus (1Nibbelink M. Moulin K. Arnaud E. Duval C. Penicaud L. Casteilla L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47291-47295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This observation challenges the prevailing view that Ucp1 is expressed exclusively in brown adipocytes. In addition, it has already led to other publications in which a role for UCP1 has been proposed in mechanisms of smooth muscle relaxation in intestine (23Shabalina I. Wiklund C. Bengtsson T. Jacobsson A. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2002; 283: G1107-G1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we decided to reinvestigate the putative presence of UCP1 in this organ with UCP1-deficient mice and also to investigate the presence of UCP2 in the reproductive tract of female mice. This particular study was, to an extent, justified by our observations that the Ucp2(-/-) mice raised on a C57BL/6J genetic background have litters significantly lower than the Ucp2(+/+) mice (5.6 ± 0.4 and 7.9 ± 0.9 pups, respectively, p < 0.01). 2S. Rousset and A.-M. Cassard-Doulcier, unpublished observations. Materials—An ECL kit and Hyperfilm ECL-TM were from Amersham Biosciences. Antibody against subunit 1 of cytochrome c oxidase (COX) was from Molecular Probes. Other chemical products and anti-rabbit IgG were from Sigma Aldrich. The 11A anti-UCP1 antibody, used by Nibbelink et al. (1Nibbelink M. Moulin K. Arnaud E. Duval C. Penicaud L. Casteilla L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47291-47295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), was purchased from Alpha Diagnostic (San Antonio, TX), and anti-rabbit IgG NA934 was from Interchim (Montlucon, France). The anti-hUCP2 (hUCP2-605) antibody purification was described previously (14Pecqueur C. Alves-Guerra M.C. Gelly C. Levi-Meyrueis C. Couplan E. Collins S. Ricquier D. Bouillaud F. Miroux B. J. Biol.

Chorulon (human chorionic gonadotropin, or hCG) and folligulon (pregnant mare serum gonadotropin, or PMSG) were from Intervet S.A. (Beaucouzé, France). Animals and Treatments—Studies on mice were performed in agreement with the institutional CNRS guidelines defined by the European Community guiding principles and by the French decree number 87/848 of October 19, 1987. Authorization to perform animal experiments was given by the French ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Food (A92580 issued February 2 1994 and 92-148 issued May 14, 2002). C57BL/6J, OF1, and B6D2F1 female mice were obtained from Elevage Janvier (Orléans) and maintained under a 12-h light, 12-h dark schedule with food and water ad libitum. Rats from the Wistar strain were used. The Ucp1(-/-) and the Ucp2(-/-) mice were described previously (18Arsenijevic D. Onuma H. Pecqueur C. Raimbault S. Manning B.S. Miroux B. Couplan E.

Guerra C. Yamashita H. Harper M.E. Kozak L.P. Nature. 1997; 387: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar). Ucp2(-/-) and Ucp1(-/-) mice were raised on a C57BL/6J genetic background. To cycle mice, mature female were intraperitoneally injected with 5 IU of PMSG to stimulate follicular growth. They were also intraperitoneally injected 48 h later with 5 IU of hCG to trigger ovulation and luteinization. Timed pregnancies of mature C57BL/6J female mice were determined by the presence of a vaginal plug. Plugged females were isolated, and this day was taken as day 0 of pregnancy. Mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation, and tissues were removed immediately and processed for mitochondria extraction as described previously (14Pecqueur C. Alves-Guerra M.C. Gelly C. Levi-Meyrueis C. Couplan E. Collins S. Ricquier D. Bouillaud F. Miroux B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8705-8712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). To collect tissues for in situ hybridization analysis, mice were anesthetized with 0.3-0.5 ml of a mixture containing 2 mg/ml ketamine and 2.5 mg/ml xylazine immediately and perfused intracardially with 20 ml of ice-cold isotonic saline followed by 100 ml of paraformaldehyde (4%) solution. At the end of perfusion, the reproductive tract was removed. To carry out bone marrow transplantation in mice, medullar aplasia was induced by 9.5-gray total body irradiation of Ucp2(+/+) or Ucp2(-/-) mice. Mice were reconstituted intravenously under anesthesia with 1.2 × 106 bone marrow cells extracted from the femur and tibia of either Ucp2(+/+) or Ucp2(-/-) mice. Mice were allowed to recover for 4 months. Western Blot Analysis—Mitochondrial protein extracts were loaded onto polyacrylamide gels, separated by electrophoresis, and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane as described previously (14Pecqueur C. Alves-Guerra M.C. Gelly C. Levi-Meyrueis C. Couplan E. Collins S. Ricquier D. Bouillaud F. Miroux B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8705-8712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Western blots were hybridized with the appropriate antibodies (see above) according to the following conditions: UCP1 detection, 11A antibody (at 1/4000 dilution) and NA934 rabbit anti-IgG (at 1/3000 dilution); UCP2, hUCP2-605 antibody (at 1/10,000 dilution) and rabbit anti-IgG (at 1/3000 dilution); and COX, anti-COX antibody (at 1/4000 dilution) and mouse anti-IgG (at 1/3000 dilution). For analysis of UCP1, Western blots were developed by autoradiography using Hyperfilm ECL-TM as described in Nibbelink et al. (1Nibbelink M. Moulin K. Arnaud E. Duval C. Penicaud L. Casteilla L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47291-47295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The amount of UCP2 was normalized by using the antibody against COX. Direct recording of the chemiluminescence corresponding to UCP2 and COX was performed using the CCD camera of the GeneGnome analyzer, and quantification was achieved using the Genetool software (Ozyme, Saint-Quentin en Yvelines, France). In Situ Hybridization Analysis—The fixative of collected tissues was washed out of the samples, which were dehydrated in graded concentrations of ethanol. The ethanol was then replaced by toluene, and the samples were embedded in paraffin wax. 5-μm sections were prepared and mounted on glass slides. The protocol used was largely adapted from the technique described by Simmons et al. (25Simmons D.M. Arriza J.L. Swanson L.W. J. Histotechnol. 1989; 12: 169-181Crossref Google Scholar) and used previously, comprising the labeling of the antisense 35S-labeled cRNA probes (26Richard D. Rivest R. Huang Q. Bouillaud F. Sanchis D. Champigny O. Ricquier D. J. Comp. Neurol. 1998; 397: 549-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). After being developed, tissues were rehydrated and stained with Harri's hematoxylin and eosin solutions for histological examination. Statistical Analysis—Values were expressed as mean ± S.E. Comparisons among the different groups were assessed by one-way analysis of variance. The level of significance (p value; shown in Fig. 4) were as follows: *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; and ***, p < 0.001. UCP1 Is Not Expressed in the Uterus of Mice—Mitochondria were isolated from tissues of mice, and a Western blot analysis was carried out as described previously (14Pecqueur C. Alves-Guerra M.C.

The 11A antibody used previously by Nibbelink et al. (1Nibbelink M. Moulin K. Arnaud E. Duval C. Penicaud L. Casteilla L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47291-47295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) was used to detect UCP1. UCP1 was detected in 0.1 μg of BAT mitochondria protein isolated from rat or C57BL/6J (Fig. 1A , lanes 1 and 2). For this amount of protein, no signal was obtained in BAT mitochondrial protein obtained from the Ucp1(-/-) mice (lane 3), undoubtedly indicating that the signal detected using the 11A antibody was UCP1. However, when a large amount (30 μg) of BAT mitochondrial protein from Ucp1(-/-) mice was loaded onto the gel, a single and strong band corresponding to a protein with a smaller molecular weight was observed. This result indicates that the 11A antibody also cross-reacted with a BAT mitochondrial protein other than UCP1 when a large amount of protein was used. The 11A antibody was able to detect the same signal in uterus mitochondria from either C57BL/6J or OF1 mice (Fig. 1B , lanes 1 and 4). This signal was clearly not UCP1, because it was present in uterus mitochondria isolated from Ucp1(-/-) mice (Fig. 1B , lane 2). We tested the possibility that the UCP1-antibody could detect UCP2 in uterus, but Fig. 1B , lane 3 shows that the same signal was detected in mitochondria extracted from Ucp2(-/-) mice. At this stage, we concluded that a mitochondrial protein, detected by the 11A antibody, was present at low levels in a large amount of uterus mitochondria, and it was neither UCP1 nor UCP2 (Fig. 1A). Because Nibbelink et al. also reported the detection of UCP1 in smooth muscle of some tissues comprising gut and stomach of mice (1Nibbelink M. Moulin K. Arnaud E. Duval C. Penicaud L. Casteilla L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47291-47295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), mitochondria were isolated from several organs of Ucp1(-/-) mice. Actually, the 11A antibody detected a mitochondrial protein in many organs of C57BL/6J mice comprising the stomach (Fig. 1C), but, again, this protein was distinct from UCP1, because a similar signal was detected in mitochondria prepared from the testis, ovary, kidney, spleen, brain, stomach, and heart. No signal was recorded in liver, lung, or gut mitochondria. Expression of the UCP2 in the Genital Tract of Female Mice—Tissues from the reproductive tract of wild type or Ucp2(-/-) female mice were dissected. Tissues were also collected from B6D2F1 mice. Mitochondria were isolated and analyzed for the expression of UCP2 in Western blot. Spleen mitochondria were also prepared, because this organ has the highest UCP2 content (14Pecqueur C. Alves-Guerra M.C. Gelly C. Levi-Meyrueis C. Couplan E. Collins S. Ricquier D. Bouillaud F. Miroux B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8705-8712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). UCP2 was detected in the ovary, uterus, and oviduct of Ucp2(+/+) mice (Fig. 2A). As expected, UCP2 protein was undetectable in mitochondria from the tissues of Ucp2-deficient mice (Fig. 2A). In mammary gland mitochondria, the picture was more complex, because an abundant and unknown protein other than UCP2 was also observed. The UCP2 amount was estimated by using the COX as an indicator of the mitochondria enrichment in two strains of mice. The level of UCP2 in the ovary, uterus, and lung was estimated to be ∼20% of the level in the spleen in both strains of mice (Fig. 2B). In the stomach, the level of UCP2 was 20 or 60% of the level in the spleen for C57Bl/6J and B6D2/F1 mice, respectively. Analysis of UCP2 Expression in Cells of Ovary and Uterus—To identify cells expressing Ucp2 mRNA in ovary and uterus of mice, in situ hybridization analysis was performed. In the ovary, the Ucp2 mRNA was strongly expressed in granulosa cells of primordial and primary ovarian follicles (Fig. 3, A and B). In contrast, the hybridization signal was weak in theca cells immediately surrounding the follicle (Fig. 3, B and C). At the level of the early antral follicle (Fig. 3C), the marked expression of Ucp2 mRNA was not only found in healthy granulosa cells but also in some granulosa cells that showed necrobiotic changes, as it occurs during a degenerative process known as atresia (arrow, in Fig. 3C). In the uterus, the hybridization signal was uniformly detected at a strong level in the endometrium, including glandular epithelium cells as well as uterine glands (Fig. 3, D-F). In contrast, the hybridization signal was low in connective tissue (stroma) and completely absent in myometrium (data not shown). In the oviduct, the hybridization signal was present through the length of the mucosa epithelial cells (data not shown). UCP2 is present in immune cells that are disseminated over many organs (12Fleury C. Neverova M. Collins S. Raimbault S. Champigny O. Levi-Meyrueis C. Bouillaud F. Seldin M.F. Surwit R.S. Ricquier D.

In the absence of antibodies allowing immunohistochemical analysis of UCP2, it was decided to perform transplantation of bone marrow cells in irradiated animals, as was recently carried out to document the protective role of UCP2 in macrophages against atherosclerosis (22Blanc J. Alves-Guerra M.C. Esposito B. Rousset S. Gourdy P. Ricquier D. Tedgui A. Miroux B. Mallat Z. Circulation. 2003; 107: 388-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Ucp2(-/-) mice were irradiated and transplanted with bone marrow from Ucp2(+/+) mice (and henceforth called Ucp2(-/-)/t(+/+) mice), whereas Ucp2(+/+) mice were irradiated and transplanted with bone marrow from Ucp2(-/-) mice (and henceforth called Ucp2(+/+)/t(-/-) mice). Transplanted mice were allowed to recover for 4 months to ensure that the engraftment of resident macrophages was close to completion. Then, the mice were sacrificed, and expression of UCP2 in ovary and uterus was analyzed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3G). In the ovary, expression of UCP2 was still present in Ucp2(+/+)/t(-/-) mice, whereas it completely disappeared in the Ucp2(-/-)/t(+/+) mice. This experiment demonstrated that UCP2 expression was restricted exclusively to the ovary cells. In contrast, UCP2 protein was present in the uterus of Ucp2(+/+)/t(-/-) and Ucp2(-/-)/t(+/+) mice (Fig. 3G), suggesting that it was present both in immune and endometrium cells in this organ. Analysis of UCP2 Variation during Estrus Cycle and Gestation of Mice—Mature C57BL/6J female mice were synchronized by an intraperitoneal injection with 5 IU of PMSG to stimulate follicular growth. They were injected 48 h later with 5 IU of hCG to trigger ovulation and luteinization. Western blot analysis of the ovary showed variations in UCP2 expression along the estrus cycle. The beginning of the pro-estrus was characterized by the highest level of UCP2. The UCP2 level transiently decreased during follicular growth prior to induction before ovulation (Fig. 4A). In the uterus, a similar pattern of expression was observed (Fig. 4A). To assay UCP2 in the uterus during gestation, females were sacrificed at various stages of pregnancy or 1 day post partum. As shown in Fig. 4B, the UCP2 level in the uterus increased during the first part of the gestation and reached its maximal level at day 12. In the ovary, no significant variation occurred during gestation (data not shown). A number of historical and more recent studies established the unique respiration uncoupling in brown adipocytes mitochondria and its direct relationship to the mitochondrial UCP1. Biochemical, immunological, transcriptional, and physiological studies demonstrated the specificity of expression of UCP1 in brown adipocytes (2Nicholls D.G. Locke R.M. Physiol.

Moulin K. Arnaud E. Duval C. Penicaud L. Casteilla L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47291-47295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In the present study, using Ucp1(-/-) mice tissues as control animals, we show that the antibody used by Nibbelink et al. (1Nibbelink M. Moulin K. Arnaud E. Duval C. Penicaud L. Casteilla L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47291-47295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) certainly recognizes UCP1 in BAT but also interacts with another protein having a slightly lower molecular weight in uterus mitochondria as well as in many other organs. Similar data were obtained in C57BL/6J and OF1 mice, this latter strain being the strain used by Nibbelink et al. (1Nibbelink M. Moulin K. Arnaud E. Duval C. Penicaud L. Casteilla L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47291-47295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Using Ucp2(-/-) mice, we also demonstrated that the protein identified by Nibbelink et al. was not UCP2. Therefore, we confirm the specific expression of UCP1 in BAT. UCPs are members of the mitochondrial carrier protein family (12Fleury C. Neverova M. Collins S. Raimbault S. Champigny O. Levi-Meyrueis C. Bouillaud F. Seldin M.F. Surwit R.S. Ricquier D.

The difficulty in obtaining specific and sensitive antibodies is probably due to the possible cross reactivity with these different proteins (14Pecqueur C. Alves-Guerra M.C. Gelly C. Levi-Meyrueis C.

The previously reported ectopic expression of UCP1 in skeletal muscle of mice chronically treated by a β3-adrenoreceptor agonist was never confirmed (36Nagase I. Yoshida T. Kumamoto K. Umekawa T. Sakane N. Nikami H. Kawada T. Saito M. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2898-2904Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Following the data of Nibbelink (1Nibbelink M. Moulin K. Arnaud E. Duval C. Penicaud L. Casteilla L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47291-47295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), Shabalina et al. reported a difference in intestinal relaxation between Ucp1(-/-) mice and wild type mice and also proposed a role for UCP1 in uterus muscle relaxation (23Shabalina I. Wiklund C. Bengtsson T. Jacobsson A. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2002; 283: G1107-G1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). However, these investigators did not attempt to independently confirm the presence or absence of UCP1 in the intestine despite that fact that they had access to Ucp1(-/-) mice. Their conclusions on a role for UCP1 in smooth muscle do not agree with our findings that UCP1 is not present in the uterus or in several other smooth muscle preparations that we have analyzed. The importance of the genetic background for the study of a protein function and, in particular, of UCP1, was supported by recent studies (37Hofmann W.E. Liu X. Bearden C.M. Harper M.E. Kozak L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12460-12465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). It seems that Shabalina et al. compared Ucp1(-/-) mice raised on a mixed genetic background to three strains of wild type mice (23Shabalina I. Wiklund C. Bengtsson T. Jacobsson A. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2002; 283: G1107-G1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Therefore, their data may simply reflect differences between genetic backgrounds. The present study provides clear evidence that UCP2 is expressed in the female reproductive system, both in the ovary and the uterus. An increase of the amount of UCP2 was observed in the uterus at day 12 of gestation and correlates with previous mRNA data (38Masaki T. Yoshimatsu H. Chiba S. Kurokawa M. Sakata T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1440: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). However, if the mRNA level remains high until the end of the gestation (38Masaki T. Yoshimatsu H. Chiba S. Kurokawa M. Sakata T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1440: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), the UCP2 protein appears to decline during the last third of gestation. These data underline the complexity of the UCP2 regulation due to transcriptional regulation as well as strong translational regulation (14Pecqueur C. Alves-Guerra M.C. Gelly C. Levi-Meyrueis C. Couplan E. Collins S. Ricquier D. Bouillaud F. Miroux B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8705-8712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Immune cells contain UCP2 (12Fleury C. Neverova M. Collins S. Raimbault S. Champigny O. Levi-Meyrueis C. Bouillaud F. Seldin M.F. Surwit R.S. Ricquier D. Warden C.H. Nat.

Ricquier D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 760-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), and such cells are resident in the genital tract. In the ovary, the number and types of leukocytes change during the estrus cycle, especially the number of macrophages and neutrophils, which increase around ovulation (40Aten R.F. Kolodecik T.R. Rossi M.J. Debusscher C. Behrman H.R. Biol. Reprod. 1998; 59: 1069-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Results of in situ hybridization analysis showed that the cells principally expressing the UCP2 mRNA in the ovary are granulosa cells, whereas the signal was particularly low in the theca layer, wherein the resident white blood cells are localized. However, results from Ucp2(+/+) mice transplanted with bone marrow of the Ucp2(-/-) led to the conclusion that the UCP2 signal of the ovary was restricted to ovarian cells. In the endometrium, macrophages represent an important mechanism of defense, including the degradation of cellular debris in endometrial shedding and repair and protection against infections. However, the mechanisms involved in recruiting, maintaining, and activating uterine macrophages are not fully defined (41Hunt J.S. Miller L. Platt J.S. Dev. Immunol. 1998; 6: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 42Cohen P.E. Nishimura K. Zhu L. Pollard J.W. J. Leukoc.

Reprod. 2001; 64: 1200-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In situ hybridization has shown that the expression of UCP2 in the uterus is restricted to the endometrium, especially in epithelial cells and uterine glands. The bone marrow transplantation experiment suggest that immune cells contribute to UCP2 expression in the uterus. The organs forming the reproductive tract are the site of continuous remodeling. In the ovary, follicular growth, atresia, ovulation, and formation and regression of the corpus luteum occur during cycle. Many changes also occur in the uterus, such as proliferation of the endometrium, possible embryo implantation, and endometrial shedding. The analysis of the expression profile of UCP2 during the estrus cycle showed that UCP2 expression was very low during follicular growth before increasing in the hours preceding ovulation. Based upon these results an important question yet to be answered relates to UCP2 function in the female genital tract. Several studies implicated UCP2 in decreasing ROS production (18Arsenijevic D. Onuma H. Pecqueur C. Raimbault S. Manning B.S. Miroux B. Couplan E. Alves-Guerra M.C. Goubern M. Surwit R. Bouillaud F. Richard D. Collins S. Ricquier D. Nat.

S. A. 2002; 99: 9392-9397Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Whether UCP2 decrease during follicular growth increases ROS in the ovary or whether the UCP2 level decreases in response to a production of ROS was not investigated. In the ovary, the pre-ovulatory period is characterized by rapid and dramatic changes in the follicular structure comparable with an inflammatory process (44Espey L.L. Biol. Reprod. 1994; 50: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 45Machelon V. Emilie D. Eur. Cytokine Netw. 1997; 8: 137-143PubMed Google Scholar). It may be hypothesized that UCP2 increase during this period lowers ROS production and attenuates the inflammatory process. Because we observed a lower rate of reproduction of the Ucp2(-/-) compared with the Ucp2(+/+) mice, it may be proposed that the absence of UCP2 causes an excessive inflammation and maintains ROS at a high level that inhibits ovulation.

Under basal conditions, channels are closed; but both physiologic (e.g. insulin) and pathologic (e.g. oxidative stress) stimuli that are known to stimulate tyrosine kinases are associated with large increases in membrane Na+ permeability to ∼80 pA/pF or more. Consequently, the purpose of these studies was to evaluate whether volume-sensitive tyrosine kinases mediate cell volume increases through effects on the activity or distribution of NSC channel proteins. In HTC hepatoma cells, decreases in cell volume evoked by hypertonic exposure increased total cellular tyrosine kinase activity ∼20-fold. Moreover, hypertonic exposure (320–400 mosm) was followed after a delay by NSC channel activation and partial recovery of cell volume toward basal values (regulatory volume increase (RVI)). The tyrosine kinase inhibitors genistein and erbstatin prevented both NSC channel activation and RVI. Similarly, hypertonic exposure resulted in an increase in p60c- src activity, and intracellular dialysis with recombinant p60c- src led to activation of NSC currents in the absence of an osmolar gradient. Utilizing FM1-43 fluorescence, exposure to hypertonic media caused a rapid increase in the rate of exocytosis of ∼40% (p < 0.01), and genistein inhibited both exocytosis and channel activation. These findings indicate that volume-sensitive increases in p60c- src and/or related tyrosine kinases play a key role in the regulation of membrane Na+ permeability, suggesting that increases in the NSC conductance may be mediated in part through rapid recruitment of a distinct pool of channel-containing vesicles.

Liver cell volume homeostasis is mandatory for cell survival. In addition, there is increasing evidence that cell volume represents a physiologically important mechanism for coupling changes in membrane transport to other cell and organ functions. Increases in cell volume, for example, serve as a signal to stimulate protein synthesis, bile secretion, and gene expression (1Bruck R. Haddad P. Graf J. Boyer J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: G806-G812PubMed Google Scholar, 2Lang F. Busch G.L. Ritter M. Volkl H. Waldegger S. Gulbins E. Haussinger D. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 247-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1592) Google Scholar). In addition, failure to regulate cell volume has been implicated in liver cell injury associated with alcohol, ischemia/reperfusion, and organ preservation (3Wondergem R. Davis J. Alcohol. Clin. Exp. Res. 1994; 18: 1230-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 4Carini R. Autelli R. Bellomo G. Albano E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 360-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Consequently, the definition of the sensing and regulatory mechanisms involved has broad implications for the modulation of liver cell and organ function as well as cellular response to injury (5Schlenker T. Feranchak A.P. Schwake L. Stremmel W. Fitz J.G. Gastroenterology. 2000; 118: 395-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that Na+-permeable ion channels in the plasma membrane play a key role in this process. Under basal conditions, membrane Na+ permeability is low because of tonic inhibition of channels by p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) 1The abbreviations used are: MAP, mitogen-activated protein; PI, phosphoinositide; pF, picofarad; NSC, nonselective cation; RVI, regulatory volume increase; ENaC, epithelial Na+ channel; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; NS, not significant. kinase, a human homologue of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae HOG-1 gene product essential for cellular osmoregulation (6Feranchak A.P.

Decreases in cell volume stimulated by oxidative stress and/or hypertonic exposure initiate an adaptive response that leads within minutes to Na+ influx through opening of nonselective cation (NSC) channels (5Schlenker T.

Physiol. 1998; 506: 127-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The resulting movement of water into the cell contributes to the restoration of volume toward basal values, a general process referred to as regulatory volume increase (RVI). Interestingly, hypertonic exposure has no effect on p38 MAP kinase activity, and the inhibitory effect of high intracellular concentrations of recombinant p38 MAP kinase can be overcome by changes in cell volume (6Feranchak A.P. Berl T. Capasso J. Wojtaszek P.A. Han J. Fitz J.G. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 1495-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus, it seems likely that inhibitory signaling is counterbalanced by additional, as yet unidentified pathways that increase the number or activity of NSC channels in the plasma membrane. Both receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases play important roles in regulation of cell growth, cell cycle, and mitogenic signaling (8Broome M.A. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16798-16806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 9Hunter T. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol.

In addition, there is increasing evidence that tyrosine kinases, either directly or through an effector pathway involving phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinase, modulate vesicular exocytosis and related membrane transport events (10Blume-Jensen P. Hunter T. Nature. 2003; 411: 355-365Crossref Scopus (3161) Google Scholar, 11Kilic G. Doctor R.B. Fitz J.G. J. Biol.

These membrane effects include positive or negative modulation of Na+ influx through regulation of specific epithelial Na+ channels (ENaC) and transporters (NHE1) (14Krump E. Nikitas K. Grinstein S.

Fitz J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26762-26768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and a primary increase in liver cell volume through opening of NSC channels with properties analogous to those responsible for RVI (2Lang F.

These findings suggest that, in liver, volume-sensitive tyrosine kinases may counter the inhibitory effects of p38 MAP kinase and lead to the opening of NSC channels and increases in cell volume. Based on these considerations, the purpose of these studies was to evaluate in a model liver cell line whether tyrosine kinases serve as positive signals that mediate RVI through effects on the activity and/or distribution of NSC channels.

Decreases in cell volume caused by exposure to hypertonic buffer or oxidative stress are followed by Na+ influx through opening of NSC channels in the plasma membrane (5Schlenker T. Feranchak A.P.

Cells were passaged at weekly intervals and maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in HCO3--containing minimal essential media (Invitrogen) supplemented with heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (10%) and l-glutamine (2 mm). Exposure of cells to hypertonic buffer (320–600 mosm, increase in NaCl) for 10 min had no effect on viability as measured by trypan blue exclusion and by intact and reversible whole-cell patch clamp current responses. Measurement of Na + Currents—Membrane Na+ currents were measured using whole-cell patch clamp techniques (24Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15175) Google Scholar). Cells on a coverslip were mounted in a chamber (volume ∼400 μl) and perfused at 4–5 ml/min with a standard extracellular solution containing (in mm): 140 NaCl, 4 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 1 KH2PO4, 10 glucose, and 10 HEPES/NaOH (pH ∼7.40). The standard intracellular (pipette) solution contained (in mm): 130 KCl, 10 NaCl, 2 MgCl2, 10 HEPES/KOH, 0.5 CaCl2, and 1 EGTA (pH 7.3), corresponding to a free [Ca2+] of ∼100 nm (6Feranchak A.P.

With these solutions, inward currents at a test potential of –80 mV are carried by influx of Na+ ions (5Schlenker T. Feranchak A.P. Schwake L. Stremmel W. Fitz J.G.

The ionic selectivity of currents was confirmed by partial substitution of extracellular Na+ with equimolar concentrations of K+ or Tris+ as indicated. Cell volume decreases were produced by exposure to hypertonic media created by addition to the extracellular media of (i) sucrose 20–50 mm or (ii) NaCl as indicated. Solution osmolality was measured by a vapor pressure osmometer (Westcor). Patch pipettes were pulled from Corning 7052 glass and had a resistance of 3–10 megaohms. Recordings were made with an Axopatch ID amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA), and were digitized (1 kHz) for storage on a computer and analyzed using pCLAMP version 6.0 programs (Axon Instruments) as described (5Schlenker T.

Current-voltage (I-V) relations were measured between –120 mV and +100 mV in 20 mV increments (400 ms duration, 2 s between test potentials); or using a ramp protocol (–100 mV to +100 mV in 400 ms). Pipette voltages (Vp) are referred to the bath. In the whole-cell configuration, Vp corresponds to the membrane potential, and downward deflections of the current trace indicate inward membrane current. Reagents—Genistein and erbstatin at concentrations of 10 μm were utilized as nonselective inhibitors of cellular tyrosine kinases and were obtained from Calbiochem. PP2 at concentrations of 10 μm was utilized as a more selective inhibitor of p60c -src , and results were compared with the same concentrations of the inactive isomer PP3 (Calbiochem). Recombinant p60c- src was obtained from Calbiochem and was delivered to the cell interior by inclusion in the patch pipette solution and concentrations of 0.02 units/μl. β-Mercaptoethanol (1%) and ATP (0.1 mm) were included in the same solution to increase specific activity as per the manufacturer's instructions. In control studies, intracellular dialysis with these co-factors in the absence of p60c- src did not activate currents. All other reagents were obtained from Sigma. Measurement of Tyrosine Kinase Activities—Subconfluent cells in 100-mm tissue culture dishes were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min in medium alone or medium supplemented with 150 mm NaCl (600 mosm final). They were then washed three times in ice-cold isosmotic phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 0.2–0.5 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm β-glycerophosphate (pH 7.2), 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 4 μg/ml aprotinin). The lysate was centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min (10,000 × g) to remove nuclei and cell debris, and the supernatants were adjusted to 100–200 μg of protein in 0.5 ml, to which was added 5 μl of rabbit polyclonal IgG against p60c- src (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog no. sc-016, lot J135) and 100 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). After 2 h of rocking incubation at 4 °C, the adsorbed proteins were washed three times in lysis buffer and resuspended in 40 μl of 50 mm β-glycerophosphate (pH 7.2), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (5,000 cpm/pmol) containing 1 mm p60c- src substrate peptide (RRLIEDNEYTAR). The reactions were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C and then stopped by the addition of 10 μl of 25% trichloroacetic acid. The p60c- src substrate peptide phosphorylation was assessed by phosphocellulose filter binding as described previously (27Heasley L.E. Senkfor S.I. Winitz S. Strasheim A. Teitelbaum I. Berl T. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: F366-F373PubMed Google Scholar). Total cellular tyrosine kinase activity was measured by Western blot using an anti-phosphotyrosine mouse IgG (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., catalog no. 05-321). Cultured cells were homogenized as described above, and lysates were heated in a boiling water bath after the addition of SDS sample buffer. Then 50 μg of protein was loaded per lane on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred either to Immobilon or NitroPlus (MSI, Westboro, MA), and the blot was blocked with 5% BSA, Fraction V (Amresco, Solon, OH) in Tris-buffered saline, pH 8, plus 0.1% Tween 80 for 2 h at room temperature. Antiserum incubation was done at 4 °C for 16 h in 5% BSA/Tween 80/TBS, after which the membrane was washed with Tween 80/TBS. Secondary antisera conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was incubated with the membrane for 2 h at room temperature in 5% BSA/Tween 80/TBS followed by washes as described above and incubation with chemiluminescent substrate. The intensity of the bands on Western blot films was determined by scanning with a video image scanner and digitizing software. For measurement of potential regulatory interactions between activated Akt and Src, cell cultures were exposed to hypertonic buffer (40% increase in NaCl, ∼395 mosm) for 5 min in the presence of either the Src inhibitor PP2 (10 μm) or the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin (50 nm). Cell lysates were obtained after 0, 5, 15, and 30 min by the addition of 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (above). The lysates were centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 21,000 × g to remove nuclei and cell debris. The supernatants were saved and used for Western blot analysis. Protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce). Immunoblotting was carried out using 10% polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred by the procedures of Towbin and processed for ECL (Amersham Biosciences) for detection with specific antibodies using 5% BSA and 1% Tween in 1× TBS. All washes were in 0.5% Tween/TBS for 5 min. Analyses of autoradiograms were performed by video image scanning as described above. Anti-phospho-Src (Tyr-416) clone 9A6 monoclonal was obtained from Upstate USA, Inc., and anti-Phospho-Akt (Ser-473) was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Cell Volume Measurements—Changes in cell volume were measured electronically using a Coulter Multisizer (Accucomp software, version 1.19, Hialeah, FL) with a 100 μm aperture and 20,000 cells/time point as described (6Feranchak A.P. Berl T. Capasso J. Wojtaszek P.A. Han J. Fitz J.G. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 1495-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 28Roman R.M. Feranchak A.P. Davison A.K. Schwiebert E.M. Fitz J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: G1222-G1230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Changes in volume over time are expressed as relative volume normalized to the basal period in standard isotonic buffer. Measurement of Membrane Turnover—The rate of exocytosis was assessed by real-time imaging using a fluorescent probe FM1-43 (Molecular Probes, OR) as described (11Kilic G. Doctor R.B. Fitz J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26762-26768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). FM1-43 has two specific properties that permit its use in this capacity. First, it binds to membranes but does not cross lipid bilayers. Second, it is not fluorescent in solution, but when it binds to biological membranes its quantum yield increases about 350-fold (29Betz W.J. Mao F. Bewick G.S. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 363-375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the fluorescence intensity is directly proportional to the amount of membrane exposed to FM1-43. For these studies, FM1-43 was added to the external solution at a concentration of 4 μm. Initially, FM1-43 partitions into the plasma membrane exposed to the external solution (100%). Subsequently, when vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane, FM1-43 equilibrates with the new membrane resulting in an increase in the apparent fluorescence. Consequently, the overall change in FM1-43 fluorescence normalized to the initial plasma membrane value (100%) provides a measure of the sum of all exocytic events. Statistics—Results are presented as the means ± S.E., with n representing the number of cells for patch clamp and imaging studies and the number of culture plates or repetitions for other assays. Same day controls were utilized for patch clamp and Coulter counter studies to minimize and effects of day-to-day changes in cell properties. Student's paired or unpaired t test was used to assess statistical significance as indicated, and p values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Volume-dependent Increases in Tyrosine Kinase Activity—To evaluate whether tyrosine kinases are involved in the adaptive response to HTC cell shrinkage, the effects of hypertonic exposure on tyrosine kinase activity and cell volume were assessed, and the results are summarized in Fig. 1. Exposure of HTC cells to hypertonic buffer (150 mm increase in NaCl, ∼600 mosm) for 10 min increased total tyrosine kinase activity ∼20-fold, and the response was inhibited by genistein (10 μm, Fig. 1, top, n = 3, p < 0.01). In parallel studies, the effects of hypertonic exposure on cell volume were assessed by electronic cell sizing (20,000 cells/time point). Under control conditions, hypertonic exposure (40% increase in NaCl, ∼395 mosm) caused a rapid initial decrease in relative cell volume (85.8 ± 2.1% of control value at 1 min) followed by a gradual recovery toward basal values (relative volume of 97.2 ± 2.2% at 25 min) despite the continued presence of hypertonic buffer (regulatory volume increase). In the presence of genistein (10 μm), there was a decrease in cell volume in isotonic buffer (relative volume of 93.2 ± 0.9%), an exaggerated response to hypertonic exposure (relative volume of 72.9 ± 2.2%), and no apparent RVI (relative volume of 76.1 ± 2.1% at 25 min; Fig. 1, bottom, p < 0.001 at all time points in hypertonic buffer). These findings confirm that tyrosine kinase activity is volume-sensitive in HTC cells as observed in primary hepatocytes (12Reinher R. Schliess F. Haussinger D. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 731-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and suggest that it contributes to the regulation of cell volume recovery from shrinkage. Inhibition of Tyrosine Kinases Prevents Volume-dependent Activation of Na + Influx—Previous studies indicate that RVI depends in large part on channel-mediated Na+ influx through a NSC conductance (5Schlenker T. Feranchak A.P. Schwake L. Stremmel W. Fitz J.G. Gastroenterology. 2000; 118: 395-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The potential relationship between activation of tyrosine kinases and the increase in NSC conductance was evaluated using whole-cell patch clamp recording techniques; the results are summarized in Fig. 2. In the example shown in Fig. 2A, currents were measured at a holding potential of –40 mV and at test potentials of 0 mV and –80 mV (400 ms duration) at 10-s intervals; inward currents at –80 mV (downward deflection of the current trace) are carried by influx of Na+ ions through the NSC conductance pathway (6Feranchak A.P. Berl T. Capasso J. Wojtaszek P.A. Han J. Fitz J.G. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 1495-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Under basal conditions, Na+ currents (at –80 mV) were –13.2 + 3.3 pA (n = 16). Hypertonic exposure (20 mm sucrose, ∼320 mosm) was followed after a delay by an increase in currents to –769.1 ± 63.5 pA at –80 mV (n = 16). To confirm that currents reflect Na+ influx through NSC channels, the current-voltage relationship was measured using a ramp protocol (Fig. 2B, –100 mV to +100 mV). With standard Na+-containing bath solutions, currents exhibited a nearly linear current-voltage relationship and reversed near the cation equilibrium potential (E cat) of ∼0 mV. Partial substitution of Na+ with K+ (final extracellular [K+] 140 mm, E cat ∼ –1.6 mV) had no significant effect on the reversal potential; but partial substitution of Na+ with the impermeable cation Tris+ (final extracellular [Na+]20 mm, E cat –45.1 mV) decreased current density at –80 mV from –55.8 ± 5.9 to –4.45 ± 1.5 pA/pF and caused a negative shift in reversal potential to –40.4 ± 4.3 mV as anticipated for the NSC conductance (n = 5). To evaluate whether tyrosine kinases contribute to activation of this conductance, cells were exposed to hypertonic buffer (∼320 mosm) in the absence versus presence of putative tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Representative recordings are shown in Fig. 2A, and results are summarized in Fig. 2C. Under control conditions, hypertonic exposure increased current density to –86.3 ± 15.1 pA/pF (n = 10, p < 0.001). The peak response was markedly inhibited by prior exposure (preincubation for 15 min) to the tyrosine kinase inhibitors (10 μm each) genistein (–3.6 ± 0.4 pA/pF, n = 6, p < 0.01) or erbstatin (–27.6 ± 3.1 pA/pF, n = 6, p < 0.01). Thus, opening of the NSC channels may be mediated in part by activation of volume-sensitive tyrosine kinases. p60c-src Represents a Candidate Volume-sensitive Tyrosine Kinase—p60c -src has been implicated in both positive and negative regulation of Na+ transport depending on the cell type and transport pathway under investigation (15Gilmore E.S. Stutts M.J. Milgram S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42610-42617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To evaluate whether p60c- src contributes to volume-sensitive Na+ influx in HTC cells, p60c -src activity was measured in cell lysates following high levels of hypertonic exposure to stimulate maximal activity as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Exposure of cells to hypertonic buffer (600 mosm for 10 min) to stimulate maximal adaptive responses caused a 3-fold increase in specific p60c -src activity (Fig. 3A). Using more conventional levels of hypertonic exposure, preincubation of cells in PP2 (10 μm, 15 min), a cell-permeable inhibitor of p60c- src (30Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1790) Google Scholar), inhibited current activation by hypertonic (40% increase in NaCl, ∼407 mosm) exposure (Fig. 3B). Under control conditions, hypertonic exposure increased current density at –80 mV to –90.1 ± 11.9 pA/pF (n = 4). In the presence of PP2, the response was inhibited to –13.0 ± 2.6 pA/pF (n = 7, p < 0.001). Preincubation with the inactive analog PP3 (10 μm) had no effect (–93.5 ± 11.5 pA/pF, n = 4, NS). Thus, p60c- src represents one candidate for a tyrosine kinase involved in activation of Na+ influx through effects on the NSC conductance. Intracellular Dialysis with p60c-src Activates NSC Channels in the Absence of a Volume Challenge—To assess whether p60 c-src is capable of activating currents directly, whole-cell currents were measured in cells dialyzed with recombinant p60c- src. For these studies, p60c- src was included in the standard intracellular patch pipette solution (0.02 units/μl with 1% β-mercaptoethanol and 0.1 mm ATP), and no osmotic gradients were imposed. Intracellular delivery of p60c- src resulted in the gradual activation of inward currents, which reached maximal values 2–5 min after achieving the whole-cell configuration (Fig. 4A). Partial substitution of extracellular Na+ with Tris+ again caused a decrease in inward currents (from –717.2 ± 60.1 to –69.1 ± 12.3 pA at –80 mV) and a negative shift in reversal potential (–41.2 ± 3.5 mV) toward the new cation equilibrium potential (Fig. 4B), indicating that inward p60c- src -activated currents are carried by influx of Na+ ions through the NSC conductance. The results summarized in Fig. 4C demonstrate that intracellular dialysis with p60c- src, but not heat-inactivated p60c- src, increases current density from –2.85 ± 1.1 to –35.7 ± 10.5 pA/pF (n = 8, p < 0.01). Thus, p60c- src is capable of stimulating Na+ influx in the absence of a primary volume decrease, overcoming the inhibitory effect of constitutive p38 MAP kinase activity. Tyrosine Kinases Modulate Vesicular Trafficking—By analogy with other channel proteins, volume-sensitive tyrosine kinases can increase NSC activity by direct phosphorylation of channel proteins and/or by increasing the number of channel proteins in the plasma membrane (31Berger H.A. Travis S.M. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 26"

The enzyme complexes were observed by 15N-heteronuclear single-quantum coherence nuclear magnetic resonance (15N-HSQC NMR) spectroscopy for the presence of 1-15N-l-Trp bound to the β-active site. No 15N-HSQC signal was detected for 1-15N-l-Trp in 10 mm triethanolamine hydrochloride buffer at pH 8. 1-15N-l-Trp in the presence of wild-type tryptophan synthase in the absence or presence of 50 mm sodium chloride showed a cross peak at 10.25 ppm on the 1H axis and 129 ppm on the 15N axis as a result of reduced solvent exchange for the bound 1-15N-l-Trp, consistent with formation of a closed conformation of the active site. The addition of disodium α-glycerophosphate produced a signal twice as intense, suggesting that the equilibrium favors the closed conformation. 15N-HSQC NMR spectra of βK87T and βE109D mutant Trp synthase with 1-15N-l-Trp showed a similar cross peak either in the presence or absence of disodium α-glycerophosphate, indicating the preference for a closed conformation for these mutant proteins. In contrast, the βD305A Trp synthase mutant only showed a 15N-HSQC signal in the presence of disodium α-glycerophosphate. Thus, this mutant Trp synthase favored an open conformation in the absence of disodium α-glycerophosphate but was able to form a closed conformation in the presence of disodium α-glycerophosphate. Our results demonstrate that the 15N-HSQC NMR spectra of 1-15N-l-Trp bound to Trp synthase can be used to determine the conformational state of mutant forms in solution rapidly. In contrast, UV-visible spectra of wild-type and mutant Trp synthase in the presence of l-Trp with NaCl and/or disodium α-glycerophosphate are more difficult to interpret in terms of altered conformational equilibria. 1-15N-l-Tryptophan (1-15N-l-Trp) was synthesized from 15N-aniline by a Sandmeyer reaction, followed by cyclization to isatin, reduction to indole with LiAlH4, and condensation of the 15N-indole with l-serine, catalyzed by tryptophan synthase. 1-15N-l-Trp was complexed with wild-type tryptophan synthase and β-subunit mutants, βK87T, βD305A, and βE109D, in the absence or presence of the allosteric ligands sodium chloride and disodium α-glycerophosphate.

The enzyme is an α2β2 complex, consisting of two α-subunits bound to a central β2-dimer. Each α-subunit independently catalyzes the reversible aldol cleavage of indole-3-glycerol phosphate to indole and d-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (α-reaction, Reaction 1). The β-subunit catalyzes the conversion of indole and l-serine to l-Trp, with PLP as the cofactor (β-reaction, Reaction 2). The overall reaction is the combination of the α-reaction and the β-reaction (αβ-reaction, Reaction 3). Indole is not observed as a free intermediate in the αβ-reaction (5Yanofsky C. Rachmeler M.

X-ray crystallographic investigations of Trp synthase from Salmonella typhimurium have revealed a 25–30-Å long interenzyme tunnel linking the α- and β-active sites, through which it has been proposed that indole travels to the β-active site directly from the α-active site after formation (10Hyde C.C.

Kawasaki H. Ahmed S.A. Morita H. Morita H. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6280-6287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction of l-Ser at the β-site, promoted by the presence of indole-3-glycerol phosphate bound at the α-active site, forms an external aldimine (E EA-Ser), which is converted to an α-aminoacrylate Schiff's base (E AA) with elimination of water, by the action of βLys87 as a general base (19Lu Z. Nagata S. McPhie P. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8727-8734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In return, formation of the α-aminoacrylate Schiff's base with PLP at the β-site activates the α-reaction (20Banik U. Zhu D.-M. Cnock P.B. Miles E.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12704-12711Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). d-Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate bound to the α-site keeps the α-site closed, blocking the release of indole into solution and facilitating transfer of indole from the α- and β-active sites through the interenzyme tunnel. Nucleophilic addition of indole to the α-aminoacrylate intermediate at the β-site then affords the quinonoid intermediate of l-Trp (E Q). βGlu109 activates the addition of indole, a weak nucleophile, probably by acting as a general base or H-bond acceptor to the N-H of the reacting indole (21Brzovic P.S. Kayastha A.M. Miles E.W. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1180-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). At this point, βLys87 acts as a general acid, providing the proton for the conversion of E Q to the l-Trp external aldimine (E EA-Trp) (19Lu Z. Nagata S. McPhie P. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8727-8734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Release of d-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate from the α-site results in an open conformation, which then allows release of the l-Trp product from the β-active site. Nucleophilic attack of βLys87 on E EA-Trp concomitant with release of l-Trp (19Lu Z. Nagata S. McPhie P. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8727-8734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) leads to regeneration of the internal aldimine to begin another catalytic cycle. Evidence of allosteric regulation of Trp synthase comes from both x-ray data (22Rhee S. Parris K.D. Ahmed S.A. Miles E.W. Davies D.R.

Yang L.-H. Miles E.W. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7421-7432Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).

In the present study, l-Trp enriched with 15N at the 1-position of the indole ring was synthesized and used as an NMR probe to obtain conformational information on wild-type and several β-site Trp synthase mutants, βK87T, βE109D, and βD305A, in both the absence and presence of Na+, an activating monovalent cation, and an analog of the α-reaction product, disodium α-glycerophosphate (GP). This novel NMR method permits the simple and rapid determination of the conformational state of wild-type and mutant Trp synthase in solution. Materials—l-Ser, l-Trp, PLP, and disodium α-GP were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. or U. S. Biochemical Corp. 15N-Aniline was obtained from Isotec, Inc. Triethanolamine was a product of Fisher Scientific. 15N-Isonitrosoacetanilide—Isonitroacetanilide was prepared by the method of Sandmeyer (30Sandmeyer T. Helv. Chem. Acta. 1919; 2: 234-237Crossref Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 31Marvel C.S. Hiers G.S Organic Syntheses. Coll. Vol. 1. John Wiley and Sons, New York1944: 327-330Google Scholar). 15N-Aniline (0.500 g, 0.0053 mol) was placed in a 100-ml, round-bottomed flask with 5 ml of water and 0.5 ml of concentrated HCl. One g (0.0051 mol) of chloral hydrate in 15 ml of water was added to this solution, followed by 15 g of sodium sulfate. A solution consisting of 1.2 g (0.05 mol) of hydroxylamine hydrochloride in 5 ml of water was added after 20 min of stirring at room temperature. The reaction mixture was heated at reflux in an oil bath for 1 h. The flask containing the reaction mixture was immediately removed from heat, allowed to cool to room temperature, and then placed in an ice bath. 15N-Isonitrosoacetanilide crystallized from the ice-cold solution and was collected by filtration. The product was recovered as a white, crystalline powder, which was dried in vacuo to afford 0.770 g (88%). 15N-Isatin—15N-Isonitrosoacetanilide (0.500 g, 0.003 mol) was added to 5 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid at 40 °C. The reaction mixture was slowly heated to 65 °C and stirred at that temperature for 1 h. Upon completion of the reaction, the opaque, purple mixture was poured over 200 g of crushed ice. The ice quickly melted to reveal a bright orange precipitate, which was collected by filtration to afford 0.412 g (92%) of 15N-isatin. 15N-Indole—Isatin is reduced to indole with LiAlH4 (32Giovanni E. Lorenz T. Helv. Chem. Acta. 1957; 161: 1552-1561Google Scholar). 15N-Isatin (0.350 g, 0.00237 mol) was combined with 6 ml of freshly distilled diethyl ether and cooled to –78 °C with a dry ice/acetone bath. Four equivalents of lithium aluminum hydride in 10 ml of diethyl ether were cooled to –78 °C and added dropwise to the 15N-isatin solution with vigorous stirring. This mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature over a period of 6 h. Ethanol was then added until gas evolution stopped. Water (5 ml) was then added to the reaction mixture, followed by 1.0 ml of 1.0 m HCl. The aqueous layer was separated, and the ether layer was extracted with 5 ml of 0.5 m HCl. The ether layer was distilled in steam, and 15N-indole was isolated from the distillate after concentration by rotary evaporation. The product, 15N-indole, was purified by cold-finger sublimation to afford 0.185 g (66%) of white solid. 1H-NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3): δ 6.31 (1H, t, 3-CH), 6.7 (1H, q, 2-CH), 7.1 (1H, t, NH), 7.3 (1H, d, Ar), 7.65 (1H, d, Ar), 7.82 (1H, t, Ar), 8.34 (1H, t, Ar). 15N-L-Trp—15N-Indole (0.137 g) was placed in a 100-ml, round-bottomed flask with 50 ml of 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8. l-Ser, 200 mg, 200 μl of Trp synthase solution (6.7 mg of enzyme), and 0.5 mg of pyridoxal 5′-phosphate were added. The reaction flask was sealed, wrapped in aluminum foil, and allowed to stir for 30 h. Upon completion of the reaction, the solution was heated to 80 °C to denature the enzyme. The mixture was filtered through Celite, and the filtrate was concentrated by rotary evaporation. The concentrated filtrate was loaded onto a reverse phase column (2.5 × 30 cm; Analtech bonded C18, 35–75 μm). 15N-l-Trp was eluted in 5 to 20% methanol/water to yield 198 mg (83%) of 15N-l-Trp. 1H-NMR (400 Mhz, D2O): δ 3.10 (1H, dd, J ββ′ = 15.6, J αβ′ = 8.6 Hz, β′-H), 3.28 (1H, dd, J ββ′ = 14.9, J αβ = 4.7 Hz, β-H), 3.83 (1H, dd, J αβ, αβ′ = 8.6, 4.7 Hz, α-H), 6.99 (1H, t, J = 7.0 Hz, C5-H), 7.08 (1H, t, J = 7.8 Hz, C6-H), 7.10 (1H, d, J = 4.7 Hz, C2-H), 7.31 (1H, d, J = 7.8 Hz, C7-H), 7.51 (1H, d, J = 7.8 Hz, C4-H); 13C-NMR (100 Mhz, D2O): δ 26.5 (β-C), 55.1 (α-C), 107.5 (3-C), 112.0 (7-C), 118.5 (4-C), 119.5 (5-C), 122.2 (6-C), 125.1 (2-C), 126.7 (3′-C), 136.4 (7′-C), 174.6 (-COO-), ESMS, m/z = 206 (M+1, calcd. for C11H12N2O2, 206). Wild-type Trp synthase used in chemoenzymatic reactions was expressed from Escherchia coli CB149 cells containing plasmid pSTB7 (18Miles E.W. Kawasaki H. Ahmed S.A. Morita H. Morita H. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6280-6287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown, collected by centrifugation, and sonicated, and the enzyme was purified as described previously (18Miles E.W. Kawasaki H. Ahmed S.A. Morita H. Morita H. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6280-6287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All samples of Trp synthase, wild-type and mutant βK87T, βE109D, and βD305A, used in the NMR experiments were purified as described previously (18Miles E.W. Kawasaki H. Ahmed S.A. Morita H. Morita H.

Purif. 1996; 8: 126-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (0.5 mg) was added to 1.0 ml of enzyme solution (∼40 mg/ml), and it was allowed to stand at room temperature for 1 h. The solution was then applied to a PD-10 (Pharmacia) gel filtration column equilibrated with 10 mm triethanolamine hydrochloride (TEA-HCl), pH 8, eluted with 10 mm TEA-HCl, pH 8, and then concentrated to 0.5 ml by ultrafiltration in a PM-3 Amicon ultrafiltration cell over a YM-30 membrane. The final concentration of Trp synthase was ∼75 mg/ml (1 mm). Three or four NMR spectra were then obtained for each enzyme sample. The initial data acquisition was made with 500 μl of enzyme in 10 mm TEA-HCl, pH 8, plus 50 μl of D2O for lock. The subsequent spectra were collected after addition to the sample of 25 μl of a solution containing 0.02 m15N-l-Trp for the second spectrum, 25 μl of 1 m NaCl for the third spectrum, and addition of 25 μl of 0.5 m disodium α-GP for the fourth spectrum. NMR data were collected with a Varian Inova 500 spectrometer (499.8 MHz, 1H) with a triple resonance probe. Water signal suppression was done using flip-back pulses (34Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 12593-12594Crossref Scopus (1012) Google Scholar) and pulse-field gradients (35Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3523) Google Scholar). Heteronuclear single-quantum coherence (HSQC) experiments (36Vuister G.W. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1992; 98: 428-432Google Scholar) were carried out with sensitivity-enhanced, gradient coherence selection (37Zhang O. Kay L.E. Olivier J.P. Forman-Kay J.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 845-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar), and the data were processed with NMRPipe (38Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11529) Google Scholar). The UV-visible spectra were obtained with a Cary 1 spectrophotometer. The samples, in a total of 0.6 ml, contained 1 mg/ml of Trp synthase in 10 mm TEA-HCl, pH 8. Spectra were collected of the enzyme alone and together with 1 mm l-Trp and 50 mm NaCl or disodium α-GP from 300 to 550 nm at 25 °C. Synthesis of 1-15N-L-Trp—The methodology chosen for the synthesis of 1-15N-l-Trp affords a high yield starting from 15N-aniline (Scheme 2). Several total syntheses of 15N-l-Trp have been reported previously in the literature (39van den Berg E.M.M. Baldew A.U. de Goede A.T.J.W. Raap J. Lugtenburg J. Trav. Chim. Pays-Bas. 1988; 107: 73-81Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 40Yuan S.-S. Ajami A.M. Tetrahedron. 1982; 38: 2051-2053Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 41Unkefer C.J. Siegfried N.L. Silks III, L.A. Hanners J.L. Ehler D.S. Gibson R. J. Labelled Comp. Radiopharm. 1991; 29: 1247-1256Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and each used the conversion of 15N-indole and l-Ser to 1-15N-l-Trp using Trp synthase, either by reaction in cell cultures modified to express this enzyme in high yield or by the free enzyme in aqueous buffer. However, none of the syntheses reported previously used 15N-aniline, either as a step or starting material, as the source of the label. We considered the various ways to synthesize indole from aniline, e.g. the Fischer indole synthesis, Japp-Klingeman synthesis, and via the Sandmeyer synthesis of isatin, and the latter was chosen for its overall efficiency. A Sandmeyer reaction of 15N-aniline with chloral hydrate and hydroxylamine afforded 15N-isonitrosoacetanilide, which gave 15N-isatin, as a brilliant orange powder, after ring closure with sulfuric acid. Subsequent reduction of isatin with four equivalents of lithium aluminum hydride and purification by steam distillation and crystallization produced pure 1-15N-indole in good yield. 15N-l-Trp was synthesized from 1-15N-indole by reaction with one equivalent of l-Ser and a catalytic amount of PLP using Trp synthase. All steps gave greater than 80% yield, except for the reduction of isatin to indole, which gave 66% yield. HSQC NMR of Trp Synthase— 15N-HSQC NMR measurements were performed on wild-type Trp synthase, K87T, E109D, and D305A mutants, with 1-15N-l-Trp, with and without a monovalent cation activator, NaCl, and the α-subunit ligand, disodium α-GP, in 10 mm TEA-HCl, pH 8. Control experiments showed no detectable 15N-HSQC signal from 1-15N-l-Trp in the same conditions, in the absence of Trp synthase, because of the rapid exchange of the N-1H with solvent at pH 8. 1-15N-l-Trp in the presence of wild-type Trp synthase exhibited a cross peak at 10.2 ppm on the 1H axis and 128.8 ppm on the 15N axis (Fig. 1A). The coupling constant for 15N and 1H is J NH = 99.8 Hz. Addition of a monovalent cation, NaCl, resulted in a slight increase in signal intensity (Fig. 1B), but 50 mm α-GP resulted in a 2-fold increase in peak intensity (Fig. 1C). In contrast, the mutant enzymes, βK87T (data not shown) and βE109D (Fig. 2), exhibited HSQC cross peaks with 1-15N-l-Trp that were equal in intensity in the presence or absence of NaCl or disodium α-GP. For βE109D, the coupling constant for 15N and 1H is J NH = 97.3 Hz. However, the βD305A mutant Trp synthase exhibited an HSQC cross peak with 1-15N-l-Trp only in the presence of disodium α-GP (data not shown). The results of the 15N-HSQC NMR experiments are summarized in Table I.Fig. 2HSQC NMR spectra of βE109D Trp synthase. A, 1mm Trp synthase in 10 mm TEA-HCl, pH 8, with 1 mm 1-15N-l-Trp.

Open table in a new tab UV-Visible Spectra of Wild-type and Mutant Trp Synthase with L-Trp—Addition of 1 mm l-Trp to solutions of wild-type Trp synthase in 10 mm TEA-HCl had only minimal effects on the spectrum of the PLP cofactor of the enzyme (Fig. 3A, dashed line). There was little change in the spectrum if 50 mm NaCl was added. However, if 50 mm disodium α-GP was included, there was a red shift in the peak at about 410 nm, and a new peak at 476 nm, attributable to a quinonoid intermediate, was observed as well as a weak new band at 330 nm. βE109D Trp synthase exhibited only a slight change in the spectrum in the presence of l-Trp alone or together with NaCl, but a more prominent peak at 330 nm was observed when disodium α-GP was added (Fig. 3B) (21Brzovic P.S. Kayastha A.M. Miles E.W. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1180-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). βD305A mutant Trp synthase also showed little change in spectrum with l-Trp alone or with NaCl, but with disodium α-GP, a prominent peak at 330 nm and a very weak shoulder at 476 nm were observed (Fig. 3C). NMR spectroscopy is a very useful technique for the study of enzyme structure and function. Whereas x-ray crystallography is time-intensive and is only capable of providing details of protein structure in a crystalline sample, observation of proteins by NMR spectroscopy, with the use of selectively labeled ligands, is rapid and easy to perform with modern instrumentation. A problem in the measurement of 15N-NMR spectra in the past has been the very low sensitivity of the 15N-nucleus, because of the low resonance frequency of 15N, combined with the low natural abundance of 15N. The problem of natural abundance can be overcome by enrichment of the compound of interest, but the inherently low sensitivity of the 15N nucleus remains. 15N-HSQC NMR overcomes this problem by observation of a 15N signal by detecting the attached proton(s) (36Vuister G.W. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1992; 98: 428-432Google Scholar). Because this method observes the 15N nucleus indirectly via polarization transfer with the attached hydrogens, an N-H proton must be present, and not exchanging rapidly with the bulk solvent, for a NMR signal to be seen. Trp synthase is an ideal enzyme for study by NMR with a labeled ligand for several reasons. First, Trp synthase has been the subject of considerable biochemical investigation, and a number of x-ray crystal structures of the wild-type enzyme, several mutant forms, and complexes with ligands have been reported (10Hyde C.C. Ahmed S.A. Padlan E.A. Miles E.W. Davies D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17857-17871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Rhee S. Parris K.D. Ahmed S.A. Miles E.W. Davies D.R.

Thus, the information provided by NMR observation of a labeled ligand can be correlated with known crystallographic structural data. Once structural correlations are made, the NMR data can provide new information for systems that lack x-ray structural data. Second, various intermediate complexes of this enzyme allosterically regulate enzyme conformation, catalysis, and intermediate stability of the two active sites, and NMR is a tool that is well-suited for measuring these subtle conformational and electronic changes. Indeed, experiments with 19F-NMR of 5-fluoro-l-Trp provided the first evidence for very slow indole formation from l-Trp by Trp synthase (42Miles E.W. Phillips R.S. Yeh H.J.C. Cohen L.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4240-4249Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). More recently, NMR studies by McDowell et al. (43McDowell L.M. Lee M. Schaefer J. Anderson K.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 12352-12353Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar) with β-13C-l-Ser demonstrated direct evidence for an α-aminoacrylate intermediate formed by dehydration of l-Ser in the β-active site of Trp synthase. l-Trp bound to the β-active site of Trp synthase was observed with 15N-HSQC NMR of 1-15N-l-Trp as a cross peak at ∼129 ppm in the 15N axis and 10.2 ppm in the 1H axis (Fig. 1A). The observation of this signal is dependent on the slow exchange of the hydrogen with the solvent, because a signal from 1-15N-l-Trp is not observed under these conditions in the absence of Trp synthase. Thus, the observation of the NMR signal in Fig. 1A implies that 1-15N-l-Trp is bound at the β-site and that Trp N-H is at least partially sheltered from solvent exchange. The presence of Na+, which can influence the conformational equilibrium of open and closed conformations, did not have much effect on the HSQC NMR spectrum (Fig. 1B). The binding of α-site ligands, disodium α-GP or d-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, results in a closed conformation of the α-site, which is transmitted allosterically to the β-active site and shifts the equilibrium at the β-site to favor the closed conformation (11Dunn M.F. Aguilar V. Brzovic P. Drewe W.F. Houben K. Leja C.A. Roy M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8598-8607Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In the presence of disodium α-GP, the NMR signal was about twice as intense (Fig. 1C). This result is consistent with the hypothesis that the β-active site of Trp synthase with l-Trp bound is in equilibrium between open and closed forms in the absence of disodium α-GP and shifts to a predominantly closed conformation in the presence of disodium α-GP. The results of the 15N-HSQC experiments with wild-type Trp synthase are summarized in Table I. Although no x-ray structure of Trp synthase with α-GP bound to the α-site and l-Trp bound to the β-site has been determined, the structure of Trp synthase with d-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate in the α-site and dihydroisotryptophan bound to the β-site has been determined, and it is in a closed conformation. 2I. Schlicting, personal communication. The UV-visible spectra of wild-type Trp synthase with l-Trp present (Fig. 3A) showed little change with NaCl, but an increase in the content of the quinonoid intermediate, absorbing at 476 nm, was seen in the presence of disodium α-GP, consistent with a closed conformation (11Dunn M.F. Aguilar V. Brzovic P. Drewe W.F. Houben K. Leja C.A. Roy M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8598-8607Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The ϵ-amino side chain of βLys87 binds PLP in the form of the internal aldimine, which undergoes nucleophilic attack by the incoming substrate, l-Ser, to form the external aldimine (E A-Ser). Mutation of βLys87 to threonine (K87T) results in an inactive enzyme, which can form an external aldimine (E A-Ser) but which cannot form an α-aminoacrylate intermediate (19Lu Z. Nagata S. McPhie P. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8727-8734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Addition of ammonia to the K87T l-Ser complex can form an α-aminoacrylate intermediate, suggesting that Lys-87 functions as a general base in the mechanism (20Banik U. Zhu D.-M. Cnock P.B. Miles E.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12704-12711Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Furthermore, addition of l-Trp to βK87T under typical reaction conditions leads to the slow formation of the l-Trp external aldimine. Because the lysine ϵ-amino group is not present in K87T, this external aldimine is very stable, the internal aldimine cannot form, and hence l-Trp is bound slowly but not released. This property of βK87T has been useful for the study of stable complexes of Trp synthase by x-ray crystallography. Currently, x-ray crystal structures of βK87T Trp synthase have been solved for various complexes, including l-Ser bound to the β-site, l-Ser bound to the β-site and indole-3-propanol phosphate bound to the α-site, l-Ser bound to the β-site and α-GP bound to the α-site, and of l-Trp bound to the β-site (23Rhee S. Parris K.D. Hyde C.C. Ahmed S.A. Miles E.W. Davies D.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7664-7680Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The structure of the βK87T complex with l-Trp is found to be in a closed conformation. Our 15N-HSQC NMR experiments with 1-15N-l-Trp are consistent with these x-ray crystallographic results. A strong 15N signal is observed for 1-15N-l-Trp with βK87T Trp synthase, either with or without the presence of disodium α-GP (Table I), as expected, because the closed conformation is seen in the βK87T-l-Trp crystal structure, even without an α-site ligand present. The second mutant Trp synthase that we examined by 15N-HSQC NMR was βE109D. βGlu109 in the β-active site is seen in the structure of the βK87T-l-Trp complex (23Rhee S. Parris K.D. Hyde C.C. Ahmed S.A. Miles E.W. Davies D.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7664-7680Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) to form a hydrogen bond to the indole N-H of the product. Substitution of this glutamate residue by aspartate reduces the reach and conformational freedom of the carboxylate functionality. Kinetic studies of βE109D have indicated that allosteric communication between the α- and β-active sites is unaffected by this mutation (21Brzovic P.S. Kayastha A.M. Miles E.W. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1180-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). d-Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate bound to the α-site activates the reaction of l-Ser at the β-site of βE109D, as it does with the wild-type enzyme. Furthermore, formation of the α-aminoacrylate intermediate is unaffected, as well as its allosteric communication to the α-site to release glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. 15N-HSQC NMR spectra of 1-15N-l-Trp with βE109D Trp synthase revealed a strong signal, with equal intensity either with or without the presence of NaCl or disodium α-GP (Fig. 2). This result suggests that the l-Trp external aldimine of βE109D Trp synthase adopts a predominantly closed conformation, as does the βK87T mutant Trp synthase. Because formation of the α-aminoacrylate intermediate is essentially unaffected by the βE109D mutation, the critical role of this residue must be catalysis of indole addition to the aminoacrylate (21Brzovic P.S. Kayastha A.M. Miles E.W. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1180-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Indeed, kinetic experiments reveal an accumulation of indole at the β-active site for βE109D Trp synthase (14Anderson K.S. Miles E.W. Johnson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8020-8033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas this accumulation does not occur with the wild type, indicating a slower reaction of indole with the aminoacrylate for βE109D Trp synthase. Furthermore, the βE109D mutant enzyme demonstrates a marked preference for indoline as opposed to indole as the β-site nucleophile, perhaps suggesting a change in the steric environment of the active site (21Brzovic P.S. Kayastha A.M. Miles E.W. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1180-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The N-H coupling constant, J NH, is reduced from 99.8 Hz for wild-type to 97.3 Hz for βE109D Trp synthase. This is consistent with a stronger hydrogen bond with the N-H of l-Trp for βE109D Trp synthase, which may be responsible for the apparent increased preference for a closed conformation. The 15N-HSQC NMR results with βE109D Trp synthase are summarized in Table I. The UV-visible spectra of E109D Trp synthase in the presence of l-Trp did not show much difference with disodium α-GP (Fig. 3B) added. There is a small increase in the band at 330 nm with disodium α-GP present (21Brzovic P.S. Kayastha A.M. Miles E.W. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1180-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), which could be due to a gem-diamine complex or to an enolimine form of the external aldimine. The enolimine form of a PLP Schiff's base is generally favored by a hydrophobic environment. In contrast to the NMR data, these UV-visible data are more difficult to interpret in terms of altered conformational equilibria. The third mutant Trp synthase that we studied by 15N-HSQC NMR was βD305A Trp synthase. Unlike the other mutant proteins, βK87T and βE109D, residue βD305 is not located within the β-active site. The x-ray data of different conformations of Trp synthase suggest that βAsp305 may be important for allosteric communication between the α- and β-subunits via the monovalent cation binding site (29Weber-Ban E. Hur O. Bagwell C. Banik U. Yang L.-H. Miles E.W. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3497-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 44Ferrari D. Niks D. Yang L.-H. Miles E.W. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7807-7818Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), because it forms an ion pair with βArg141 in the closed conformation. βD305A Trp synthase has a broader substrate specificity for nucleophiles than wild-type Trp synthase, suggesting that it favors a more open, solvent-accessible active site than wild-type Trp synthase (26Ferrari D. Yang L.-H. Miles E.W. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7421-7432Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The results of our experiments given in Table I suggest that although the conformational equilibrium in the absence of α-ligands indeed preferentially favors the open structure, allosteric communication in βD305A is similar to that of the wild-type enzyme. The complete absence of a 15N-HSQC signal for 1-15N-l-Trp with βD305A Trp synthase without disodium α-GP is consistent with previous conclusions that the βD305A protein may adopt a more open conformation than wild-type Trp synthase (26Ferrari D. Yang L.-H. Miles E.W. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7421-7432Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 29Weber-Ban E. Hur O. Bagwell C. Banik U. Yang L.-H. Miles E.W. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3497-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 44Ferrari D. Niks D. Yang L.-H. Miles E.W. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7807-7818Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, the observation of the 15N-HSQC cross peak with disodium α-GP present implies that the closed conformation of the l-Trp complex can still form, at least partially, when an α-ligand is present. This is consistent with the observation that a closed complex with l-Ser can be formed by βD305A Trp synthase in the presence of disodium GP or Cs+ but not with Na+ (44Ferrari D. Niks D. Yang L.-H. Miles E.W. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7807-7818Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). There were some differences in the UV-visible spectra of βD305A Trp synthase with l-Trp and disodium α-GP (Fig. 3C). As with βE109D Trp synthase, a band appeared at 330 nm, and similar to wild-type Trp synthase, there was absorption at 476 nm, but very much weaker than for the wild-type enzyme. It is not clear from these UV-visible spectra that a closed conformation is formed by βD305A Trp synthase in the presence of disodium α-GP. An important concern with x-ray crystallography is whether the conformational state of a protein in solution is the same as that seen in the crystalline state. An advantage of NMR spectroscopy is that it measures the properties of proteins in solution and thus provides direct information on the solution structure of the protein. Our NMR results with wild-type and βK87T Trp synthase, for which x-ray crystal structural data are available, are in agreement with the crystal structures. However, no crystal structures have been obtained yet for βE109D and βD305A Trp synthase. The 15N-HSQC NMR results reported herein suggest that the conformational equilibrium of βE109D Trp synthase has a preference for the closed conformation with l-Trp bound, more so than does wild-type Trp synthase, whereas the l-Trp complex of βD305A Trp synthase favors the open conformation more than wild-type Trp synthase."

Cleavage of Pro by thrombin liberates fragment 1 and generates the zymogen analog, prethrombin 1 (Pre 1). The properties of exosite I on Pre 1 and its factor Xa activation intermediates were characterized in spectroscopic and equilibrium binding studies using the fluorescein-labeled probe, hirudin54–65 ([5F]Hir54-65-(SO3-)). Prethrombin 2 (Pre 2), formed by factor Xa cleavage of Pre 1 at Arg271-Thr272, had the same affinity for hirudin54–65 peptides as Pre 1 in the absence or presence of near-saturating fragment 2 (F2). Pre 2 and thrombin also had indistinguishable affinities for F2. By contrast, cleavage of Pre 1 at Arg320-Ile321, to form active meizothrombin des-fragment 1 MzT(-F1), showed a 11- to 20-fold increase in affinity for hirudin54–65, indistinguishable from the 13- to 20-fold increase seen for conversion of Pre 2 to thrombin. Thus, factor Xa cleavage of Pre 1 at Arg271-Thr272 does not effect exosite I expression, whereas cleavage at Arg320-Ile321 results in concomitant activation of the catalytic site and exosite I. Furthermore, expression of exosite I on the Pre 1 activation intermediates is not modulated by F2, and exosite II is not activated conformationally. The differential expression of exosite I affinity on the Pre 1 activation intermediates and the previously demonstrated role of (pro)exosite I in factor Va-dependent substrate recognition suggest that changes in exosite I expression may regulate the rate and direction of the Pre 1 activation pathway.

Biol. 1997; 425: 17-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), and Pro fragment 2 (F2, 25). On Pro, exosite I is in a precursor, low affinity state (proexosite I) that is activated on conversion of Pro to thrombin, as shown by a ∼100-fold increase in affinity for an exosite I-specific hirudin54–65-peptide probe (26Anderson P.J. Nesset A. Dharmawardana K.R. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16428-16434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Characterization of proexosite I supports an important a role for this site in factor Va-mediated Pro binding and recognition as a substrate of the factor Xa·factor Va catalytic complex (27Anderson P.J.

Recent mutagenesis studies in which proexosite I residues were shown to play a critical role in factor Va acceleration of prethrombin 1 (Pre 1) activation support the importance of this site in substrate recognition (30Chen L. Yang L. Rezaie A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27564-27569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In Pro and Pre 1, exosite II is covered by the covalently linked fragment 2 domain (25Arni R.K. Padmanabhan K. Padmanabhan K.P. Wu T-P. Tulinsky A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4727-4737Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Whether exosite II is expressed as a result of passive dissociation of F2 following cleavage at Arg271-Thr272 or by a conformational change affecting affinity for F2 is not known. Delineating the pathway of expression of exosites I and II is important to understanding the roles of these sites in the mechanism of factor Va acceleration of Pro activation, regulation of the activation pathway, and regulation of physiological interactions of the Pro activation intermediates and thrombin. Previous studies of exosite I interactions of Pro activation species do not provide a consistent view of the pathway of expression of exosite I. Exosite I was accessible on human meizothrombin des-fragment 1 (MzT(-F1)) for binding of thrombomodulin and an anti-exosite I antibody, whereas exosite I on human Pro, Pre 2, and MzT did not bind these macromolecules (31Wu Q. Picard V. Aiach M. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3725-3730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In studies of the bovine proteins, however, binding of fluorescein-labeled hirudin53–64 (hirugen) to Pro and Pre 1 was undetectable, whereas Pre 2 bound the peptide with similar affinity as thrombin (32Liu L.-W. Ye J. Johnson A.E. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23632-23636Google Scholar). MzT and MzT-(-F1) both bound the peptide with 2- to 8-fold higher affinity than Pre 2, suggesting that either peptide bond cleavage in Pro results in activation of exosite I (32Liu L.-W. Ye J. Johnson A.E. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23632-23636Google Scholar). Comparison of the previous studies is difficult because of the use of different ligands and proteins from different species. This prompted a quantitative analysis of the pathway of expression of exosite I on the human Pro activation intermediates and investigation of the effects of the activation fragments on exosite I affinity. Pre 1, formed by removal of fragment 1 (F1) from Pro by thrombin cleavage at Arg155-Ser156, and the Pre 1 activation intermediates, Pre 2 and F2, and MzT(-F1), were chosen as analogs of Pro for initial investigation of the expression of exosites I and II and the influence of F2. Hirudin54–65 fluorescently labeled with 5-carboxy(fluorescein) ([5F]Hir54-65(SO3-)) was used as an exosite I-specific probe in equilibrium binding studies to characterize the properties of exosite I on the Pre 1 species in comparison with previous results for Pro and thrombin (26Anderson P.J. Nesset A. Dharmawardana K.R. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16428-16434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Conversion of Pro to Pre 1 was accompanied by a surprising 2- to 6-fold increase in affinity of Pre 1 for hirudin54–65 peptides. Among Pre 1 activation intermediates, Pre 2 bound the peptide with the same affinity as Pre 1, whereas MzT(-F1) displayed a 11- to 20-fold increase in affinity, with a dissociation constant indistinguishable from that determined for thrombin. F2 bound with similar affinity to Pre 2 and thrombin, indicating no change in affinity of exosite II for this specific ligand accompanying the proteinase activating conformational change. The results demonstrate that proteolytic cleavage of Pre 1 in the proteinase zymogen domain by factor Xa results in activation of regulatory exosite I as well as the catalytic site, whereas cleavage at Arg271-Thr272 does not change exosite I affinity significantly. The differential expression of exosite I affinity on the Pre 1 activation intermediates is thought to play a role in the activity of factor Va to regulate the rate and direction of the Pre 1 activation pathway. In the companion paper (33Anderson P.J. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44489-44495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), these studies are extended to the Pro activation intermediates to investigate the effect of the F1 domain in modulating activation of exosite I. Protein Purification and Characterization—Human Pro, factor X, factor Xa, and thrombin were purified and characterized as described previously (34Bock P.E. J. Biol.

Thrombin was active-site labeled with N α-[(acetylthio)acetyl]-d-Phe-Pro-Arg-CH2Cl (ATA-FPR-CH2Cl) and 5- or 6-(iodoacetamido)fluorescein, and the resulting [5F]FPR-thrombin and [6F]FPR-thrombin were characterized as described previously (34Bock P.E.

Pre 1 (100 mg) was incubated with 0.4 μm factor Xa for 90 min in 100 mm Hepes, 10 mm CaCl2, pH 7.6, at 25 °C in the presence of 10 μm Thromstop (American Diagnostica). The reaction was quenched by immediate loading onto soybean trypsin inhibitor-agarose (1.5 × 24 cm) at 4 °C. Pre 2 and F2 were eluted from the column in 50 mm Hepes, 110 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4. Fractions were collected into 10 mm MES, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm benzamidine, pH 6.0, to prevent slow proteolysis. The eluted proteins were loaded immediately onto Blue-Sepharose (2.5 × 14 cm) at 4 °C, equilibrated with 50 mm Tris, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm EDTA, 0.02% NaN3, pH 7.5. F2 eluted from the column in the wash fractions, whereas Pre 2 bound to the column and was eluted with a 1-liter gradient of buffer containing up to 1.5 m NaCl. Pre 2 was purified further by chromatography on benzamidine-Sepharose (1.5 × 28 cm) to remove thrombin (11Carlisle T.L. Bock P.E. Jackson C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22044-22055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pre 2 was concentrated, dialyzed against 50 mm Hepes, 0.125 m NaCl, pH 7.4, snap frozen, and stored at –80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by absorbance at 280 nm with the following absorption coefficients ((mg/ml–1)cm–1) and molecular weights (8Krishnaswamy S. Church W.R. Nesheim M.E. Mann K.G. J.

Hir54-65(SO3-) (Sigma or Bachem) was dissolved in water or buffer, and the concentration was determined by the purity and peptide content specified by the manufacturer. The amino terminus of Hir54-65(SO3-) was labeled with 5-carboxy(fluorescein) ([5F]Hir54-65(SO3-)) as described previously (40Bock P.E. Olson S.T. Björk I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19837-19845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Quantitative Affinity Chromatography— Hir54-65(SO3-) binding to Pre 1 was analyzed by quantitative affinity chromatography on Hir54-65(SO3-)-agarose. Hir54-65(SO3-) was coupled to Affi-Gel-10 (Bio-Rad) as described previously (26Anderson P.J. Nesset A. Dharmawardana K.R. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16428-16434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), except that 0.2 mg of peptide was coupled to ∼3 ml of gel. Chromatography experiments were performed by loading 300 μl of 6.7 μm Pre 1 (0.1 mg) in 50 mm Hepes, 110 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 1 mg/ml polyethylene glycol 8000, pH 7.4, onto 2.7-ml columns at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/h. Pre 1 was preincubated for 30 min at 25 °C with 1 μm FPR-CH2Cl and various concentrations of Hir54-65(SO3-) prior to chromatography. The elution volume (V obs) was determined from the midpoint of the A 230 nm absorbance peak. The recovery of the protein eluted in the separations was estimated to be 40–108% by integration of the peaks. Pre 1 was also subjected to chromatography on a control matrix prepared without peptide to determine the elution volume under conditions where the protein did not interact with the gel (Vo*) and similarly in the presence of buffer containing 2 m NaCl. A concentration of ≥81 μm binding sites for Pre 1 on the gel matrix was determined by batchwise titrations of 50 μlof gel with Pre 1 and measurement of binding from the decrease in solution protein absorbance. This confirmed that under the chromatography conditions only a small fraction of the matrix binding sites was occupied. On this basis, the dependence of the fractional change in elution volume ((Vobs-Vo*)/Vo*) on the total Hir54-65(SO3-) concentration was analyzed using the hyperbolic equation (26Anderson P.J.

Fluorescence Studies—Fluorescence intensities were measured with an SLM 8100 fluorometer in acrylic cuvettes coated with polyethylene glycol 20,000. All experiments were performed in 50 mm Hepes, 110 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 1 mg/ml polyethylene glycol 8000, pH 7.4, and at 25 °C. Experiments with the Pre 1 activation intermediates contained 0.1 μm FPR-CH2Cl. Fluorescence excitation spectra of 0.2 μm[5F]Hir54-65(SO3-) with near-saturating concentrations of Pre 1 activation species were recorded at the emission maximum of 520 nm (4-nm excitation and emission band passes). Spectra were normalized to the initial fluorescence intensity of [5F]Hir54-65(SO3-) measured with excitation at 491 nm. Corrections for background (≤1%) were made from parallel measurements on blanks lacking the labeled peptide, and corrections for dilution were ≤5%. Binding of Hirudin Peptides to Pre 1 and the Activation Intermediates—Binding of [5F]Hir54-65(SO3-) was measured by titrating the labeled peptide with each protein and monitoring the change in fluorescence at 520 nm with excitation at 491 nm. Fluorescence changes expressed as (F obs – F 0)/F 0 = ΔF/F 0 as a function of total protein concentration were fit by the quadratic binding equation to obtain the maximum fluorescence change ((F max – F 0)/F 0 = ΔF max/F 0) and the dissociation constant (KD). For MzT(-F1), the stoichiometry (n) was also obtained, whereas for Pre 1 and Pre 2, n was fixed at 1. Competitive binding of unlabeled peptide and [5F]Hir54-65(SO3-) was quantitated in titrations of mixtures of fixed concentrations of probe and protein with the unlabeled peptide. The return of the observed fluorescence change toward the starting value was measured as a function of unlabeled peptide concentration. The data were corrected for a small linear increase (<2.4%/μmHir54-65(SO3-)) in fluorescence of [5F]Hir54-65(SO3-) when titrated with unlabeled peptide. Together with the direct titrations, the competitive displacement data were fit simultaneously by the cubic equation for competitive binding to determine the maximal fluorescence change and the dissociation constant for the unlabeled peptide interaction, with n fixed at 1 (43Lindahl P. Raub-Segall E. Olson S.T. Björk I. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 44Olson S.T. Bock P.E. Sheffer R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 286: 533-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Binding of F2 to Thrombin and Pre 2—Binding of F2 to thrombin was determined by monitoring the change in fluorescence of 190 nm [6F]FPR- or [5F]FPR-thrombin as a function of F2 concentration. Competitive binding of F2 to Pre 2 and thrombin was measured by titration with F2 of mixtures of 190 nm [6F]FPR- or [5F]FPR-thrombin and 20 μm Pre 2. The titrations were fit by the cubic equation for competitive binding to obtain ΔF max/F 0 and the dissociation constant for F2 binding to either the labeled thrombin or Pre 2 with n = 1 (43Lindahl P. Raub-Segall E. Olson S.T. Björk I. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 44Olson S.T. Bock P.E. Sheffer R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 286: 533-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Effect of F2 on Binding of Hirudin Peptides to Pre 2—The effects of F2 on binding of [5F]Hir54-65(SO3-) to Pre 2 were determined by titration of 50 nm[5F]Hir54-65(SO3-) and 20 μm F2 with Pre 2 and compared with similar titrations in the absence of F2. Scheme I describes the random addition ternary complex model for F2 and [5F]Hir54-65(SO3-) (H) binding to Pre 2 (P2) to form the binary complexes, P2·F2 or P2·H, and addition of the alternate ligand to the binary complexes to form the ternary complex, P2·F2·H. The model was used to analyze the titrations of [5F]Hir54-65(SO3-) with Pre 2 in the presence and absence of F2 to determine the dissociation constants for [5F]Hir54-65(SO3-) binding to Pre 2 (K P2(H)), F2 binding to Pre 2 (K P2(F2)), and the formation of the ternary complex, P2·F2·H (K P2F2(H) or K P2H(F2)) (see Scheme I). The observed fluorescence changes of the labeled hirudin peptide in Scheme I can be described as a function of the concentration of the two fluorescent complex species relative to probe alone, as given by Equation 1. ΔFF0=ΔFmaxP2(H)F0[P2·H][H]0+ΔFmaxP2F2(H)F0[P2·F2·H][H]0(Eq. 1) Computer solution of the equations for the dissociation constants and mass conservation was used to determine the concentration of the binary complex, [P2·H], and the concentration of the ternary complex, [P2·F2·H], the dissociation constants for [5F]Hir54-65(SO3-) binding to Pre 2 in the absence and presence of F2 (K P2(H) and K P2F2(H)), and the maximum fluorescence changes for each of the fluorescent complexes (ΔF max P2(H)/F 0 and ΔF max P2F2(H)/F 0). The dissociation constant for F2 binding to Pre 2 (K P2(F2)) was fixed at the value determined previously as described above. Nonlinear least-squares fitting was performed with Scientist software. Error estimates represent ±2 S.D. Fluorescence Spectral Properties of SO3- Binding to Prethrombin 1, Prethrombin 1 Activation Intermediates, and Thrombin—Spectral changes accompanying binding of fluorescein-labeled hirudin54–65 were evaluated from excitation difference spectra and from the maximum amplitudes of the spectral changes determined in titrations as described below. Upon [5F]Hir54-65(SO3-) binding to Pre 1 and the Pre 1 activation intermediates, the fluorescence excitation difference spectra showed distinct features that differentiated the characteristics of exosite I on Pre 1 from those on the activation intermediates (Fig. 1). Pre 1 quenched the fluorescence of [5F]Hir54-65(SO3-) by 21.1 ± 0.5%. The S-shaped difference spectrum was similar to that seen previously for the same peptide binding to Pro, but the fluorescence change was slightly (3%) larger (Table I) (26Anderson P.J. Nesset A. Dharmawardana K.R. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16428-16434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The fluorescence excitation difference spectra for [5F]Hir54-65(SO3-) binding to Pre 2 exhibited properties similar to that of Pre 1, with the fluorescence quenched 26.5 ± 0.5%. By contrast, the spectra for the fluorescein-labeled peptide binding to MzT(-F1) displayed characteristics that were essentially identical to those of thrombin (Fig. 1), where the fluorescence was quenched by 29.8 ± 0.5 and 29.2 ± 0.4%, respectively (Table I) (26Anderson P.J. Nesset A. Dharmawardana K.R. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16428-16434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Comparison of the excitation difference spectra and the maximum amplitudes suggested that exosite I on Pro, Pre 1, and Pre 2 was slightly different, whereas exosite I on MzT(-F1) and thrombin was the same. This suggested slightly different states of exosite I for the inactive zymogen precursors, distinctly different from the environment on the catalytically active products.Table IParameters determined for binding of hirudin54–65 peptides to prethrombin 1, the prethrombin 1 activation intermediates, and productsInteractionMethodKDSitesΔF max/F 0μ mmol/mol protein%Prothrombin[5F]Hir54-65(SO3-)Direct titration3.2 ± 0.3-17.6 ± 0.5Hir54-65(SO3-)Competitive titration2.6 ± 0.6-18.7 ± 0.4Prethrombin 1[5F]Hir54-65(SO3-)Direct titration0.5 ± 0.1-21.1 ± 0.5Hir54-65(SO3-)Competitive titration0.7 ± 0.1-21.1 ± 0.5+F1: [5F]Hir54-65(SO3-)Direct titration0.6 ± 0.1-19.3 ± 0.4Hir54-65(SO3-)Quantitative affinity chromatography0.7 ± 0.1Prethrombin 2[5F]Hir54-65(SO3-)Direct titration0.44 ± 0.04-26.5 ± 0.5Hir54-65(SO3-)Competitive titration0.5 ± 0.1-26.6 ± 0.8+F2: [5F]Hir54-65(SO3-)Ternary complex0.4 ± 0.1-25.8 ± 0.7Meizothrombin des-fragment 1[5F]Hir54-65(SO3-)Direct titration0.024 ± 0.0031.1 ± 0.1-29.8 ± 0.5Hir54-65(SO3-)Competitive titration0.065 ± 0.013-31.4 ± 1.0Thrombin[5F]Hir54-65(SO3-)Direct titration0.025 ± 0.0020.84 ± 0.06-29.2 ± 0.4+F2: [5F]Hir54-65(SO3-)Ternary complex0.020 ± 0.007-27.6 ± 0.7 Open table in a new tab Binding of Hirudin Peptides to Prethrombin 1—The affinity of Hir54-65(SO3-) for Pre 1 was determined initially by small zone quantitative affinity chromatography. Pre 1 eluted from Hir54–65(SO3)-agarose as a broad peak in I 0.15 m, 5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4, buffer and was eluted in successively smaller volumes from the column equilibrated with increasing concentrations of free peptide (Fig. 2). Pre 1 eluted in the void volume of the peptide column in 2 m NaCl and a control column lacking peptide, indicating a specific interaction of Pre 1 with the immobilized peptide. Analysis of the hyperbolic decrease in elution volume of Pre 1 as a function of increasing peptide concentration gave a dissociation constant of 0.7 ± 0.1 μm for Hir54-65(SO3-) binding to Pre 1, with an intercept of 6.2 ± 0.2 for the ratio of the concentration of matrix sites to the dissociation constant for matrix binding (Fig. 2, inset). The latter result was reasonably consistent with the independently determined value of 3.1 from titration of the gel matrix with Pre 1 (see “Experimental Procedures”). The results showed that Pre 1 bound Hir54-65(SO3-) with 5-fold higher affinity in comparison to Pro (Table I) and demonstrated that the enhanced affinity was a bulk property of Pre 1 and not due to contaminating proteins that bound with higher affinity.

It is a homeodomain-containing protein that activates specific target genes during early embryogenesis. Our recent studies have identified a domain of Bcd located outside its homeodomain and referred to as a self-inhibitory domain that can dramatically repress its own ability to activate transcription. Here we present evidence that the self-inhibitory function is evolutionarily conserved. A systematic analysis of this domain reveals a composite 10-amino acid motif with interdigitating residues that regulate Bcd activity in opposite manners. Mutations within the Bcd motif can exert their respective effects when the self-inhibitory domain is grafted to an entirely heterologous activator, but they do not affect DNA binding in vitro or subcellular localization of Bcd in cells. We further show that the self-inhibitory domain of Bcd can interact with Sin3A, a component of the histone deacetylase co-repressor complex. Our study suggests that the activity of Bcd is intricately controlled by multiple mechanisms involving the actions of co-repressor proteins.

Our study suggests that the activity of Bcd is intricately controlled by multiple mechanisms involving the actions of co-repressor proteins. It is becoming increasingly evident that transcription is a highly coordinated process requiring the actions of both activators and repressors. Meanwhile, the distinction between activators and repressors is less clear-cut than previously thought. For example, a transcription factor can act either as an activator or repressor depending on the enhancer context (1Johnson A.D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) or availability of specific physiological stimuli (2Torchia J. Glass C. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin.

Enhancer elements also contain recognition sites, sometimes overlapping, for both activators and repressors that work together to control gene transcription (6Senger K. Merika M. Agalioti T. Yie J.

Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 827-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In addition, some activators can interact with co-repressor complexes that can repress their own activities (2Torchia J.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10467-10471Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Most intriguingly, some repressor proteins can apparently interact with basal transcription factors (10Saurin A.J. Shao Z. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Kingston R.E. Nature. 2001; 412: 655-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 11Breiling A. Turner B.M. Bianchi M.E. Orlando V. Nature. 2001; 412: 651-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), presumably forming inactive transcription complexes at gene promoters. How the activity of transcription factors is regulated remains a fundamental question in molecular biology because disruption of normal regulatory mechanisms can lead to severe biological consequences. Our recent studies of the Drosophila morphogenetic protein Bicoid (Bcd) help illustrate this point. Bcd is a molecular morphogen required for embryonic patterning along the anterior-posterior axis in Drosophila (12Nusslein-Volhard C. Dev. Suppl. 1991; 1: 1-10PubMed Google Scholar, 13Driever W. McKnight S.L. Yamamoto K. Transcriptional Regulation. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, NY1992: 1221-1250Google Scholar). Synthesized from maternally contributed and anteriorly localized bcd mRNA, Bcd protein is distributed as an anterior-to-posterior gradient in early embryos, with the highest concentration at the anterior (14Berleth T. Burri M. Thoma G. Bopp D. Richstein S. Frigerio G. Noll M. Nüsslein-Volhard C. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1749-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 15Driever W. Nüsslein-Volhard C. Cell. 1988; 54: 83-93Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). Bcd is a homeodomain-containing transcriptional activator that stimulates the expression of its target genes in a concentration-dependent manner (13Driever W. McKnight S.L. Yamamoto K. Transcriptional Regulation. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, NY1992: 1221-1250Google Scholar). For example, Bcd activates the target gene hunchback (hb) in the anterior half of the embryo (16Struhl G. Struhl K. Macdonald P. Cell. 1989; 57: 1259-1273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 17Driever W. Nüsslein-Volhard C. Nature. 1989; 337: 138-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar), whereas the head-specific gene orthodenticle (otd) responds to higher concentrations of Bcd with an expression domain restricted to a more anterior portion of the embryo (18Gao Q. Finkelstein R. Development. 1998; 125: 4185-4193PubMed Google Scholar). Our recent studies in Drosophila tissue culture cells identified a self-inhibitory domain of Bcd that can severely repress its own activity (19Zhao C. York A. Yang F. Forsthoefel D.J. Dave V. Fu D. Zhang D. Corado M.S. Small S. Seeger M.A. Ma J. Development. 2002; 129: 1669-1680PubMed Google Scholar). This self-inhibitory domain (residues 52–91) is located in the amino terminus of the protein outside its homeodomain. A deletion derivative lacking this domain is greater than 40 times more active than the wild type protein on a hb-CAT reporter in transfected cells. A Bcd mutant (Bcd(A52–56)) bearing alanine substitutions at the critical residues 52–56 causes dominant, gain-of-function defects in embryonic patterning. Embryos from wild type females carrying the bcd(A52–56) transgene exhibit patterning defects in both anterior and abdominal segments. In addition, the expression domains of hb and otd are dramatically expanded toward the posterior (19Zhao C. York A. Yang F. Forsthoefel D.J. Dave V. Fu D. Zhang D. Corado M.S. Small S. Seeger M.A. Ma J. Development. 2002; 129: 1669-1680PubMed Google Scholar). In this report we further characterize the self-inhibitory domain of Bcd. We provide evidence that the self-inhibitory function of Bcd is evolutionarily conserved. Our systematic mutagenesis experiments reveal that the most critical region of this domain is localized to a 10-amino acid motif at residues 52–61. Strikingly, mutations at immediately adjacent residues in this motif cause opposite effects on the ability of Bcd to activate a hb-CAT reporter gene in Drosophila S2 cells. In particular, whereas Bcd(A52–56) has a dramatically increased activity on hb-CAT, Bcd(A57–61), which has the immediately adjacent residues 57–61 changed to alanines, was nearly inactive on this same reporter gene. Like the A52–56 mutation, the A57–61 mutation does not affect subcellular localization of Bcd in cells or its DNA binding in vitro, and both mutations can confer their respective, opposite effects to an entirely heterologous activator. In addition, Bcd(A57–61) can inhibit efficiently the activity of wild type Bcd in reporter activation assays. A systematic dissection of this 10-amino acid motif suggests that it is composed of interdigitating residues that impact the Bcd function in opposing manners. Our biochemical experiments further show that the paired amphipathic helix (PAH) domains of Drosophila Sin3A can interact with the self-inhibitory domain of Bcd. These experiments suggest that the activity of Bcd is modulated by multiple mechanisms involving the actions of co-repressor proteins such as Sin3A. Plasmid Construction—All activator gene constructs for expressing wild type Bcd or its mutants were based on pAC5.1C (Invitrogen) and were generated in two steps. First, the DNA fragment containing full-length wild type or mutant bcd genes were cloned as NdeI-XbaI fragments into a modified pGEM3 vector, pFY7002. All the bcd genes have a Xenopus β-globin leader sequence followed by the coding sequence for a single hemagglutinin tag (MAYPYDVPDYAH) attached to the first codon; bcd mutations were generated by a PCR-mediated method as described previously (20Ma X. Yuan D. Diepold K. Scarborough T. Ma J. Development. 1996; 122: 1195-1206PubMed Google Scholar, 21Bi W. Stambrook P.J. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 256: 137-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Secondly, the DNA fragments including the hemagglutinin-tagged Bcd sequence and the β-globin leader were then taken as HindIII-XbaI fragments and inserted into pFY403, which was derived from pAC5.1C with its KpnI and EcoRV sites converted to HindIII and XbaI sites, respectively (22Zhao C. Dave V. Yang F. Scarborough T. Ma J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8112-8123Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The luciferase reporter construct, 5xGa14-TATA-luc, was based on luciferase 3 basic vector (Promega), which contains the E1A TATA box.

Dave V. Yang F. Scarborough T. Ma J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8112-8123Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Drosophila Sin3A coding fragments were generated by PCR using a cDNA (kindly provided by Drs. Lori Pile and David Wassarman) as a template. They were then cloned into the NdeI-XbaI sites of pFY441 (19Zhao C. York A. Yang F. Forsthoefel D.J. Dave V. Fu D. Zhang D. Corado M.S. Small S. Seeger M.A. Ma J. Development. 2002; 129: 1669-1680PubMed Google Scholar), resulting in pAY559 (for PAH1 domain, residues 1–373 of Sin3A), pAY560 (PAH2, residues 419–780), pAY561 (PAH3, residues 910–1318), pAY562 (PAH4, residues 1439–1748), pDF320 (PAH2–3, residues 411–1080), and pDF321 (PAH3–4, residues 904–1611). Transient Transfection and CAT Assays—Drosophila S2 cells were transfected with plasmids by the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method as described previously (22Zhao C. Dave V. Yang F. Scarborough T. Ma J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8112-8123Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). For each transfection, a total amount of 10 μg of DNA, including 1 μg of effector plasmid, 1 μg of report plasmid and 1 μg of copia-lacZ transfection efficiency control plasmid was transfected to cells seeded in a 60-mm-diameter tissue culture plate. The luciferase assay was performed according to the vendor's protocol (Promega), and the CAT activity was measured as described previously (22Zhao C. Dave V. Yang F. Scarborough T. Ma J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8112-8123Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Cellular Fractionation and Gel Shift Assays—The cellular fractionation experiments were performed as described previously (19Zhao C. York A. Yang F. Forsthoefel D.J. Dave V. Fu D. Zhang D. Corado M.S. Small S. Seeger M.A. Ma J. Development. 2002; 129: 1669-1680PubMed Google Scholar). For gel shift assays, both in vitro translated proteins and nuclear extracts from transfected Drosophila S2 cell were analyzed for their ability to bind a 26-bp probe containing a consensus A1 site as described previously (19Zhao C. York A. Yang F. Forsthoefel D.J. Dave V. Fu D. Zhang D. Corado M.S. Small S. Seeger M.A. Ma J. Development. 2002; 129: 1669-1680PubMed Google Scholar). The in vitro translated proteins were generated by rabbit reticulocyte lysate using Sp6 polymerase (Promega), and the nuclear extracts from S2 cells were generated as described previously (19Zhao C. York A. Yang F. Forsthoefel D.J. Dave V. Fu D. Zhang D. Corado M.S. Small S. Seeger M.A. Ma J. Development. 2002; 129: 1669-1680PubMed Google Scholar). The binding reactions were performed in 30 μl of BB Buffer (15 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 40 mm KCl) containing 1.0 μgofdI·dC on ice for 20 min. See the legends for Figs. 3 and 9 for more details.Fig. 9DNA binding of Bcd is inhibited by PAH domains of Sin3A. Shown are gel shift results of full-length Bcd in the presence (lanes 1–12) or absence (lane 13) of the indicated PAH domains of Sin3A. A 32P-labeled 26-bp DNA probe with a single Bcd binding site was used in this assay (final probe concentration of ∼4 × 10–8m); free probe and protein-DNA complex (bound) containing full-length Bcd are marked on the right. Both Bcd and Sin3A PAH domains were generated using an in vitro translation system, and the amounts of the translation lysates in the experiments were 6 μl for Bcd in all lanes (estimated active Bcd concentration ∼3.6 × 10–10m) and 1 μl (lanes 1, 4, 7, 10), 2 μl (lanes 2, 5, 8, 11), and 6 μl (lanes 3, 6, 9, 12) for Sin3A PAH domains.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) GST Pull-down Assays—The GST pull-down assays were performed as described previously (19Zhao C. York A. Yang F. Forsthoefel D.J. Dave V. Fu D. Zhang D. Corado M.S. Small S. Seeger M.A. Ma J. Development. 2002; 129: 1669-1680PubMed Google Scholar, 23Zhang D.Y. Carson D.J. Ma J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 3078-3085Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, GST-Bcd fusion proteins containing Bcd (1–91) and either wild type or mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli (DH5α) cells and coupled to glutathione-agarose beads. The amount of all GST-Bcd fusion proteins was adjusted to be ∼2–3 μg/10-μl bead suspension, as estimated by Coomassie Blue staining. After washing with binding buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 30 mm NaCl, 0.012% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.25% milk), 20 μl of GST beads were resuspended in 200 μl of binding buffer and mixed with 6 μl of translation lysate (TNT-couple reticulocyte system; Promega) containing 35S-labeled Sin3A PAH domains. After incubation for 3 h at 4 °C, the beads were washed 3 times with the binding buffer and 1 time with binding buffer without milk. The pull-down products were resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and analyzed using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. The Self-inhibitory Function of Bcd Is Evolutionarily Conserved—Recent studies have isolated a bcd gene from the primitive cyclorrhaphan fly Megaselia abdita (24Stauber M. Jackle H. Schmidt-Ott U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3786-3789Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Although the carboxyl-terminal portions of the Bcd proteins from Drosophila and M. abdita (Ma-Bcd) show relatively little conservation, their amino-terminal portions share a contiguous stretch of highly conserved sequence (24Stauber M. Jackle H. Schmidt-Ott U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3786-3789Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). This conserved sequence covers the homeodomain and the region immediately amino-terminal to the homeodomain including the self-inhibitory domain (Fig. 1A). To determine whether the self-inhibitory function of Bcd is evolutionarily conserved we compared the abilities of wild type and mutant Ma-Bcd proteins to activate the hb-CAT reporter gene in S2 cells (Fig. 1B). The mutant protein, Ma-Bcd(A43–47), contains alanine substitutions at residues 43–47, corresponding to residues 52–56 of Drosophila Bcd. In our experiments this mutant Ma-Bcd(A43–47) protein exhibited an activity 7.5 times higher than its wild type counterpart (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 4), demonstrating that the self-inhibitory function is evolutionarily conserved. Interestingly, compared with Drosophila Bcd, Ma-Bcd proteins are relatively poor activators in Drosophila S2 cells (Fig. 1B; also see Ref. 25Shaw P.J. Wratten N.S. McGregor A.P. Dover G.A. Evol. Dev. 2002; 4: 265-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) despite their stable accumulation in transfected cells (Fig. 1C). Two Critical Regions of the Self-inhibitory Domain of Bcd Are Located Immediately Adjacent to Each Other—To further define regions within the self-inhibitory domain of Drosophila Bcd important for its action, we generated systematic alanine-scanning mutants of the full-length protein, each bearing five residues converted to alanines (Fig. 2A). In our experiments, 1-μg effector plasmids were transfected into S2 cells together with the hb-CAT reporter plasmid; because Bcd at this concentration has already reached its maximal activity on this reporter (19Zhao C. York A. Yang F. Forsthoefel D.J. Dave V. Fu D. Zhang D. Corado M.S. Small S. Seeger M.A. Ma J. Development. 2002; 129: 1669-1680PubMed Google Scholar), our observed CAT activities are reflective of the activation potentials of the Bcd derivatives. As shown previously (19Zhao C. York A. Yang F. Forsthoefel D.J. Dave V. Fu D. Zhang D. Corado M.S. Small S. Seeger M.A. Ma J. Development. 2002; 129: 1669-1680PubMed Google Scholar), a mutation of residues 52–56 increased the activity of Bcd by 25-fold (line 2) on the hb-CAT reporter in S2 cells. Our results shown in Fig. 2A also identify several other regions that when mutated can increase Bcd activity moderately, most notably residues 72–76 (9.7-fold increase, line 6) and residues 67–71 (5.3-fold increase, line 5; also see “Discussion”). Mutations in other regions (except residues 57–61; see below) had relatively little or no effect on Bcd activity in this assay. Fig. 2B shows that all Bcd derivatives were accumulated in S2 cells to comparable levels as determined by a Western blot analysis. Our alanine-scanning mutation analysis shown in Fig. 2A also reveals another region of Bcd, residues 57–61, that is located immediately adjacent to residues 52–56 but plays an opposite role. Specifically, mutation at residues 57–61 almost completely abolished Bcd activity on the hb-CAT reporter in S2 cells (line 3). The inability of this mutant protein to activate hb-CAT cannot be overcome by expressing it at a higher level in transfected cells (not shown). In addition, Bcd derivatives with critical residues within 57–61 individually mutated also caused a reduction in Bcd activity on hb-CAT (see below). Together, our results identify 2 immediately adjacent regions, residues 52–56 and residues 57–61, that regulate Bcd function in opposing manners. The A57–61 Mutation Does Not Affect Subcellular Distribution or DNA Binding—Our previous studies show that the A52–56 mutation does not affect the subcellular distribution or DNA binding properties of Bcd in vitro (19Zhao C. York A. Yang F. Forsthoefel D.J. Dave V. Fu D. Zhang D. Corado M.S. Small S. Seeger M.A. Ma J. Development. 2002; 129: 1669-1680PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the two adjacent regions located at residues 57–61 and 52–56 exert their regulatory activities on Bcd function through a common mechanism(s) we analyzed the effect of the A57–61 mutation on subcellular distribution and DNA binding properties of Bcd. Our results (Fig. 3A) show that, similar to both wild type Bcd (lanes 1 and 2) and Bcd(A52–56) (19Zhao C. York A. Yang F. Forsthoefel D.J. Dave V. Fu D. Zhang D. Corado M.S. Small S. Seeger M.A. Ma J. Development. 2002; 129: 1669-1680PubMed Google Scholar), Bcd(A57–61) is predominantly localized to the nucleus (lanes 3 and 4). In addition, our gel shift analysis using both in vitro translated proteins (Fig. 3B) and extracts made from transfected S2 cells (Fig. 3C) revealed a normal DNA binding by Bcd(A57–61) in vitro. Dissociation constant measurements using extracts generated from transfected S2 cells (Fig. 3D) further revealed a comparable DNA binding affinity for wild type Bcd and Bcd(A57–61). Together these experiments demonstrate that the A57–61 mutation does not disrupt Bcd activity by altering its in vitro DNA binding or subcellular distribution properties. Bcd(A57–61) Can Efficiently Inhibit the Activity of Wild Type Bcd—Because Bcd(A57–61) was virtually inactive on the hb-CAT reporter in S2 cells (Fig. 2A, line 3), we wanted to further rule out the possibility that it is a completely defective protein due to, e.g. inadequate protein folding or sub-cellular localization. When co-transfected into S2 cells, Bcd(A57–61) inhibited in a dose-dependent manner the ability of wild type Bcd to activate the hb-CAT reporter (Fig. 4). Such an inhibition was significant (5-fold) even when Bcd(A57–61) and the wild type protein were expressed from the same amount of transfected effector DNA (lane 3). These results demonstrate a dominant negative (and potentially an active repression) role of Bcd(A57–61), suggesting that this mutant protein retains its ability to access the hb-CAT reporter in cells but is specifically defective in activating transcription. Mutations in Adjacent Regions of Bcd Can Exert Their Respective Effects on a Heterologous Activator—It has been shown previously that the self-inhibitory domain of Bcd works as a functional module that does not target any specific Bcd domains and can repress the activity of heterologous activators (19Zhao C. York A. Yang F. Forsthoefel D.J. Dave V. Fu D. Zhang D. Corado M.S. Small S. Seeger M.A. Ma J. Development. 2002; 129: 1669-1680PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the observed “inactivating” effect of the A67–61 mutation is a transferable property of the self-inhibitory domain of Bcd, we analyzed the activity of a hybrid activator protein, Bcd-GAL4-B6, in S2 cells. This fusion protein contains the self-inhibitory domain of Bcd (residues 1–91) linked to the heterologous activator GAL4-B6 that has the DNA binding domain of GAL4 (residues 1–147) fused to the bacterially derived activation domain B6 (26Ma J. Ptashne M. Cell. 1987; 51: 113-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). In addition to the wild type self-inhibitory domain of Bcd, we also assayed the activity of fusion derivatives bearing the A52–56 or A57–61 mutation. These proteins were assayed for their abilities to activate a 5xGAL4-Luc reporter gene containing five GAL4 binding sites upstream of the luciferase reporter (Fig. 5A). Our results shown in Fig. 5B demonstrate that GAL4-B6 can respond to both A52–56 and A57–61 mutations. Specifically, the A52–56 mutation increased the activity of Bcd-GAL4-B6 by more than 13-fold (line 2; also see Ref. 19Zhao C. York A. Yang F. Forsthoefel D.J. Dave V. Fu D. Zhang D. Corado M.S. Small S. Seeger M.A. Ma J. Development. 2002; 129: 1669-1680PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the A57–61 mutation reduced the activity by more than 30-fold (line 3). These results demonstrate that the two immediately adjacent regions of Bcd can exert their respective, opposite effects on an entirely heterologous activator. Systematic Mutation Analysis Defines Critical Residues Controlling Bcd Activity—To further dissect individual residues that are responsible for controlling the activity of Bcd, we conducted a systematic mutagenesis analysis of the 10-amino acid motif (residues 52–61). It should be noted that this entire 10-amino acid region has an overall inhibitory function on the hb-CAT reporter; either deletion of this region or mutation of all 10 amino acids to alanines in full-length Bcd dramatically increased its activity (Ref. 19Zhao C. York A. Yang F. Forsthoefel D.J. Dave V. Fu D. Zhang D. Corado M.S. Small S. Seeger M.A. Ma J. Development. 2002; 129: 1669-1680PubMed Google Scholar and data not shown). In our mutation analysis, full-length Bcd derivatives bearing single or multiple amino acid mutations were assayed for their abilities to activate the hb-CAT reporter in S2 cells. These Bcd derivatives were accumulated in transfected cells to comparable levels as determined by a Western blot analysis (not shown). Our mutational analysis shown in Fig. 6 reveals the following results. First, three residues of Bcd (Phe-53, Leu-56, and Phe-57) play a most critical role in repressing its activity. Mutations at these residues either individually (Mut 7, 8, 16) or in combination with other residues (Mut 1, 2, 4, and 13), significantly increased Bcd activity in S2 cells. Second, residues Asp-54, Asp-58, and Glu-59 appear to contribute positively to Bcd activity, and mutating these residues further reduced Bcd activity (Mut 9, 14, and 17–20). These results show that the 10-amino acid motif of Bcd is composed of interdigitating residues that have opposite effects on Bcd function (for a summary see Fig. 7A). Mutations in other residues only had relatively minor effects.Fig. 7A motif important for the self-inhibitory function of Bcd. A, a critical 10-amino acid motif within the self-inhibitory domain of Bcd contains residues that contributes to Bcd function both positively (arrowheads above) and negatively (arrowheads below).

Three additional residues on the carboxyl-terminal side of the Bcd motif are also included because structural studies show that the PAH2-interacting α-helix of Mad1 SID is 13 residues in length (27Brubaker K.

HD, homeodomain.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Our mutagenesis analysis shown in Fig. 6 also suggests that the inhibitory function conferred by the 10-amino acid motif may require the formation of an α-helix; mutation of Leu-55 to proline (L55P) weakened the inhibitory function, resulting in a Bcd derivative that is almost 6 times more active than the wild type protein (Mut 11). In addition, mutation of Asp-54 to proline (D54P; Mut 10) resulted in higher Bcd activity than mutation of this residue to alanine (D54A; Mut 9), although D54P was not more active than wild type Bcd. Finally, the mutagenesis analysis shows that a consensus C-terminal-binding protein (CtBP)-interacting motif (PLDLS) led to an increase rather than decrease in Bcd activity (Mut 12), further confirming our previous suggestion that the co-repressor CtBP is not responsible for mediating self-inhibition of Bcd (19Zhao C.

The Self-inhibitory Domain of Bcd Interacts with PAH Domains of Sin3A—A careful examination of the self-inhibitory motif of Bcd indicates that it shares similarity to motifs previously shown to interact with Sin3A (27Brubaker K.

The TAF N-terminal domain (TAND) of TAF1 may play a significant role in these two principal TFIID functions by regulating the access of TBP to the TATA element. In yeast, TAND consists of two subdomains, TAND1 (10-37 amino acids (aa)) and TAND2 (46-71 aa), which interact with the concave and convex surfaces of TBP, respectively. Here we demonstrate that another region located on the C-terminal side of TAND2 (82-139 aa) can also bind to TBP and induce transcriptional activation when tethered to DNA as a GAL4 fusion protein. As these properties are the same as those of TAND1, we denoted this sequence as TAND3. Detailed mutational analyses revealed that three blocks of hydrophobic amino acid residues located within TAND3 are required not only for TBP binding and transcriptional activation but also for supporting cell growth and the efficient transcription of a subset of genes. We also show that the surface of TBP recognized by TAND3 is broader than that recognized by TAND1, although these regions overlap partially. Supporting these observations is that TAND1 can be at least partly functionally substituted by TAND3.

In fact, when TBP is mixed together with TAND in vitro, they promptly form a stable complex that is unable to bind to the TATA element (15Kokubo T. Swanson M.J. Nishikawa J.I. Hinnebusch A.G. Nakatani Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1003-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 16Bai Y. Perez G.M. Beechem J.M. Weil P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3081-3093Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Moreover, both native and partially reconstituted TFIID were shown to exhibit lower activities for DNA binding and basal transcription than TBP alone (5Sanders S.L. Garbett K.A. Weil P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6000-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 20Furukawa T. Tanese N. J. Biol.

Biol. 2000; 20: 1923-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). On the other hand, since TAND1 and acidic type of activators like VP16 compete for TBP binding (18Nishikawa J. Kokubo T. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Nakatani Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), it has been proposed that activators may first sever the inhibitory interaction between TAND1 and TBP and subsequently facilitate the transfer of TBP from TAND1 to the TATA element (denoted as the two-step handoff model in Ref. 23Kotani T. Banno K. Ikura M. Hinnebusch A.G. Nakatani Y. Kawaichi M. Kokubo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7178-7183Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In this model, TFIIA is proposed to also play a pivotal role in dislodging TAND2 from the opposite side of TBP by competitively binding to TBP. In good agreement with this, TFIIA significantly increased the DNA-binding ability of either native TFIID (5Sanders S.L. Garbett K.A. Weil P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6000-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 24Ozer J. Mitsouras K. Zerby D. Carey M. Lieberman P.M. J. Biol.

Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6882-6894Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). TFIIA also suppressed the temperature-sensitive growth of strains lacking TAND (ΔTAND) (15Kokubo T. Swanson M.J. Nishikawa J.I. Hinnebusch A.G. Nakatani Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1003-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). TBP function is also negatively regulated by other factors, such as Mot1 and NC2, or by self-dimerization (reviewed in Ref. 26Pugh B.F. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 255: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Mot1 is a member of the Snf2/Swi2 ATPase family and, in the absence of ATP, forms a complex with TBP in solution or on the TATA element (27Auble D.T. Hansen K.E. Mueller C.G. Lane W.S. Thorner J. Hahn S. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1920-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 28Darst R.P. Dasgupta A. Zhu C. Hsu J.Y. Vroom A. Muldrow T. Auble D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13216-13226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, when ATP is provided to this complex, some conformational change appears to occur in Mot1 or TBP upon ATP hydrolysis, and this results in dissociation of TBP from the TATA element (28Darst R.P. Dasgupta A. Zhu C. Hsu J.Y. Vroom A. Muldrow T. Auble D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13216-13226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In contrast, NC2 is a histone-folded heterodimer, composed of NC2α and NC2β (29Goppelt A. Stelzer G. Lottspeich F. Meisterernst M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3105-3116Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 30Goppelt A. Meisterernst M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4450-4455Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 31Kim S. Na J.G.

Biol. 1997; 17: 2057-2065Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), that inhibits TATA-dependent transcription as well as facilitating downstream promoter element-dependent transcription (34Willy P.J. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T. Science. 2000; 290: 982-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Mechanistically, it was shown that NC2 associates preferentially with promoter-bound TBP and thereby precludes further recruitment of TFIIA and TFIIB (29Goppelt A. Stelzer G. Lottspeich F. Meisterernst M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3105-3116Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 35Kamada K. Shu F. Chen H. Malik S. Stelzer G. Roeder R.G. Meisterernst M. Burley S.K. Cell. 2001; 106: 71-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Therefore, the inhibitory mechanism of NC2 differs from those of TAND and Mot1 since it does not entail TBP dissociation from the DNA. Importantly, genome-wide expression analyses demonstrated that all of these TBP inhibitory factors, i.e. TAND, Mot1, and NC2, regulate transcription not only negatively but also positively (36Geisberg J.V. Moqtaderi Z. Kuras L. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8122-8134Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 37Geisberg J.V. Holstege F.C. Young R.A. Struhl K. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 2002; 10: 871-882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Although the mechanisms by which these factors exert such opposing functions are poorly understood, recent findings that NC2α and NC2β are not always associated and can act independently under certain conditions may provide a partial explanation, at least in the case of NC2 (41Creton S. Svejstrup J.Q. Collart M.A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 3265-3276Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 42Iratni R. Yan Y.T. Chen C. Ding J. Zhang Y. Price S.M. Reinberg D. Shen M.M. Science. 2002; 298: 1996-1999Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that there are two distinct classes of promoters in S. cerevisiae, namely TAF-dependent and TAF-independent promoters (43Li X.Y. Bhaumik S.R. Green M.R. Science. 2000; 288: 1242-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 44Kuras L. Kosa P. Mencia M. Struhl K. Science. 2000; 288: 1244-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The former depends on multiple TAFs for its transcription, whereas the latter does not. In addition, although significant amounts of TAFs are recruited specifically to the former, TBP is recruited to both types, which suggests that there may be other form(s) of TBP besides TFIID. It still remains unclear whether this corresponds to a free form of TBP or form(s) associated with Mot1, NC2, SAGA or other unknown factors (43Li X.Y. Bhaumik S.R. Green M.R. Science. 2000; 288: 1242-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 44Kuras L. Kosa P. Mencia M. Struhl K.

In any case, the recruitment of an appropriate form of TBP onto each promoter appears to be directed by upstream activator(s) (46Mencia M. Moqtaderi Z. Geisberg J.V. Kuras L. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 823-833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 47Li X.Y. Bhaumik S.R. Zhu X. Li L. Shen W.C. Dixit B.L. Green M.R. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1240-1244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In the case of TFIID, a cooperative interaction with Mediator is also important for the efficient assembly of the productive preinitiation complex (48Baek H.J. Malik S. Qin J. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2842-2852Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 49Johnson K.M. Carey M. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 772-777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, in strains lacking TAND1 (ΔTAND1), artificial recruitment of some Mediator components by connection to the Zif DNA binding domain dramatically increased transcription from a template bearing Zif-binding sites (50Cheng J.X. Nevado J. Lu Z. Ptashne M. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 934-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In other words, Mediator recruitment by itself is not sufficient to relieve an inhibitory effect of TAND1. Since pre-recruitment of Mediator by an activator, in the absence of TFIID, decreased preinitiation complex assembly and transcription in vitro (49Johnson K.M. Carey M. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 772-777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), it appears that the inhibitory effect of TAND1 could be relieved by the concurrent actions of an activator and Mediator. Accumulating evidence suggests that TAND is in fact involved in transcriptional regulation (19Kou H. Irvin J.D. Huisinga K.L. Mitra M. Pugh B.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3186-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 40Chitikila C. Huisinga K.L. Irvin J.D. Basehoar A.D. Pugh B.F. Mol.

Despite this important function, the primary sequence of the TAND region is poorly conserved between yeast and Drosophila, with the exception of the small TAND2 segment (17Kotani T. Miyake T. Tsukihashi Y. Hinnebusch A.G. Nakatani Y. Kawaichi M. Kokubo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32254-32264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 18Nishikawa J. Kokubo T. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Nakatani Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Structural determination of the binary complex composed of Drosophila TAND1 and TBP revealed that TAND1 mimics the minor groove surface of the partially unwound TATA element (55Liu D. Ishima R. Tong K.I. Bagby S. Kokubo T. Muhandiram D.R. Kay L.E. Nakatani Y. Ikura M. Cell. 1998; 94: 573-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Since yeast TAND1 (10-37 aa) is about half the size of Drosophila TAND1 (11-77 aa), it is difficult to imagine that these two TAND1 sequences can form a similar structure. Thus, we suspect that there may be another unidentified TBP-interacting region in close proximity to TAND1 in yeast Taf1p (see details in the first paragraph under “Results”). To test this possibility, we searched for TAND1-like activity in the region adjoining TAND2, and we found that the sequence from 82 to 139 aa meets this criterion. We designated this region as TAND3 and compared its properties with those of TAND1. The relationships of yeast TAND1 and TAND3 to Drosophila TAND1 are also discussed. Yeast Strains and Culture—Standard techniques were used for yeast growth and transformation (56Adams A. Gottschling D.E. Kaiser C.A. Stearns T.

To introduce alanine substitution mutations into the three subregions of TAND3, pM1169 was subjected to site-specific mutagenesis to create pM4089, pM4090, pM4091, pM4092, pM4093, pM4094, and pM4095 by using oligonucleotides TK4083, TK4084, TK4085, TK4083+TK4084, TK4084+TK4085, TK4083+TK4085, and TK4083+TK4084+TK4085, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W2007989871,"The cAMP receptor protein (CRP) regulates the expression of several genes in Escherichia coli. The protein is a homodimer, and each monomer is folded into two distinct structural domains. After allosteric transitions resulting from the binding of cAMP, CRP specifically binds to DNA and activates transcription. We have used stopped-flow fluorometry measurements of CRP mutants bearing amino acid substitutions T127I, S128A, and T127I/S128A to study the kinetics of conformational changes in the protein induced by cAMP binding. Amino acid substitutions at positions 127 and 128 were chosen because these residues play a crucial role in interdomain and intersubunit communication during allosteric transition. Using N-iodoacetylaminoethyl-5-naphthylamine-1-sulfonic acid-labeled Cys178, localized in the protein helix-turn helix motif, we observed conformational changes in the helix-turn helix, localized in the C-terminal domain, upon binding of cAMP to high affinity sites (CRP·cAMP2) in the N-terminal domain of CRP. The rate constants for the forward and backward conformational changes depend on the amino acid substitution: kc = 3.62 s–1 and k –c = 3.13s–1 for CRP T127I and k c = 0.42 s–1 and k – c = 0.78 s–1 for CRP S128A. These values can be compared with kc = 9.7 s–1 and k – c = 0.31 s–1 for wild-type CRP. The observed conformational changes can be described by the sequential model of allostery, with the amino acid substitutions influencing the allosteric changes. In the case of the double mutant, the observed rate constant of cAMP binding supports the suggestion that this unligated mutant possesses the structure that is close to the allosteric conformation necessary for promoter binding. The results of intrinsic fluorescence measurements suggest that the formation of the CRP·cAMP4 complex results from displacement of equilibrium between the two forms of the CRP·cAMP2 complex in the mutants studied, similar to wild-type CRP. The observed conformational changes occur according to a concerted model of allostery, and isomerization equilibrium between the two CRP states depends on the amino acid substitution. The data presented in this study indicate that Ser128 and Thr127 in CRP play an important role in the kinetics of intramolecular transitions triggered by cAMP.

The cAMP receptor protein (CRP) 1The abbreviations used are: CRP, cAMP receptor protein; HTH, helix-turn-helix; KNF, Koshland-Némethy-Filmer (sequential model of allostery); MWC, Monod-Wyman-Changeux (concerted model of allostery); I-EDANS, N-iodoacetylaminoethyl-5-naphthylamine-1-sulfonic acid; EDANS-CRP, cAMP receptor protein covalently labeled with I-EDANS at Cys178. regulates the expression of >100 genes in Escherichia coli. CRP is a dimeric protein composed of two identical subunits of 209 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 22.6 kDa (1Busby S. Ebright R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar, 2Harman J.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1574: 1-17Crossref Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Each subunit is folded into two distinct domains (3Anderson W.B. Schneider A.B. Emmer M. Perlman R.L. Pastan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 5929-5937Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The larger N-terminal domain contains a binding site for cAMP in the anti-conformation, and the smaller C-terminal domain contains a helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif responsible for DNA recognition and binding. The two domains are connected with a short hinge region composed of residues 135–138. Crystal structure studies have shown that the protein additionally possesses a second binding site (located between the hinge and the turn of HTH) that binds cAMP in the syn-conformation (4Passner J.M. Steitz T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2843-2847Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Indeed, a recent microcalorimetric isothermal titration calorimetry study has shown that, in solution, CRP sequentially binds two molecules of cAMP with negative cooperativity and high affinity; and additionally, at least one additional molecule binds to a low affinity binding site (5Lin S.H. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11857-11867Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It is believed that, at ∼100 μm cAMP, CRP is able to recognize and bind specific DNA sequences and to stimulate transcription (6Taniguchi T. O'Neill M. de Crombrugghe B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 5090-5094Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and this active form of the protein is represented by the CRP·cAMP2 complex with two anti-sites occupied (7Mukhopadhyay J. Sur R. Parrack P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 8Małecki J. Polit A. Wasylewski Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8480-8486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, in the presence of millimolar concentrations of cAMP, at which the CRP·cAMP4 complex predominates, there is a loss of affinity for DNA and sequence specificity for its recognition and transcription regulation (7Mukhopadhyay J. Sur R. Parrack P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Therefore, the occupancy of cAMP-binding anti- or syn-sites of CRP may have different effects on the regulatory mechanism of CRP associated with interactions between the protein subunits and domains. The idea of four cAMP-binding sites, viz. two in its anti-conformation operating at low concentrations of the ligand and two additional binding sites active at high cAMP concentrations, has also been used to describe the results of our fast kinetic studies (8Małecki J. Polit A. Wasylewski Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8480-8486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) as well as time-resolved anisotropy (9Błaszczyk U. Polit A. Guz A. Wasylewski Z. J. Protein Chem. 2002; 20: 601-610Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and fluorescence energy transfer measurements (10Polit A. Błaszczyk U. Wasylewski Z. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1413-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). A variety of biochemical and biophysical studies (2Harman J.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1574: 1-17Crossref Scopus (212) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that binding of cAMP allosterically induces CRP to assume a conformation that binds to DNA and that interacts with RNA polymerase (1Busby S. Ebright R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). However, the details of the mechanism, which mediates the allosteric activation of CRP, remain obscure because the crystal structure of unligated CRP has not yet been elucidated. It is believed that the binding of cAMP involves subunit realignment and a reorientation of the hinge between the protein domains (11Won H.-S. Yamazaki T. Lee T.-W. Yoon M.-K. Park S.-H. Kyogoku Y. Lee B.-J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13953-13962Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Our recent fluorescence energy transfer studies support this idea and show that the binding of anti-cAMP in the CRP·cAMP2 complex results in the movement of the C-terminal domain of CRP by ∼8 Å toward the N-terminal domain (10Polit A. Błaszczyk U. Wasylewski Z. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1413-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The binding of cAMP in the CRP·cAMP4 complex effects only a very small increase in fluorescence energy transfer efficiency between fluorescently labeled Cys178 and Trp85. Biochemical and biophysical studies focused on the identification of structural changes accompanying binding of cAMP to CRP have been mostly performed under equilibrium conditions, and much less attention has been paid to the description of the kinetic mechanism of the ligand interaction with CRP. Our previous stopped-flow studies investigating the kinetics of conformational changes in CRP induced by cAMP binding had shown that, at micromolar cAMP concentrations, allosteric changes take place according to a sequential (Koshland-Némethy-Filmer (KNF)) model, whereas conformational changes observed at millimolar concentrations can be described by a concerted (Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC)) model (8Małecki J. Polit A. Wasylewski Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8480-8486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The conformational change observed upon binding of cAMP to anti-sites, described by the KNF model, clearly indicates long-range structural communication between the N- and C-terminal domains of CRP remaining under kinetic control (8Małecki J. Polit A. Wasylewski Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8480-8486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). On the other hand, binding of cAMP to syn-sites of CRP, described by the MWC model, results from displacement of equilibrium between the two structural forms of CRP·cAMP2, where only one form is able to form a CRP·cAMP4 complex. Because the four cAMP-binding sites of CRP possess different cooperative affinity for the ligand (8Małecki J. Polit A. Wasylewski Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8480-8486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), it can be expected that the kinetically controlled domain-domain and subunit-subunit communication may play a crucial role in the molecular regulatory mechanism of CRP action. In this study, we report a further kinetic description of cAMP-induced conformational changes in CRP based on the use of different mutants (T127I, S128A, and T127I/S128A). It is well known (12Cheng X. Kovac L. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10816-10826Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 13Leu S.W. Baker C.H. Lee E.J. Harman J.G.

Chem. 2001; 276: 11230-11236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) that all of these mutants exhibit altered allosteric activation of CRP both in vitro and in vivo (15Lee E.J. Glasgow J. Leu S.F. Belduz A.O. Harman J.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2894-2901Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Because Thr127 and Ser128 are directly involved in cAMP binding as well as in intersubunit and interdomain interactions in CRP·cAMP complexes (4Passner J.M. Steitz T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2843-2847Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 16Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 311-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar), fast kinetic measurements can provide further insight into the allosteric activation of CRP. Materials—N-Iodoacetylaminoethyl-5-naphthylamine-1-sulfonic acid (I-EDANS) was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. EDTA, dithiothreitol, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, Tris, and cAMP were obtained from Sigma. Fractogel EMD SO3- 650M was from Merck, and Q-Sepharose Fast Flow, Sephacryl S-200HR, and Sephadex G-25 were from Amersham Biosciences. The nutrients for bacterial growth were from Invitrogen. All other chemicals were analytical grade products from ICN. All measurements were performed in buffers prepared in water purified with the Millipore system. Protein Purification—CRP S128A was isolated from E. coli strain CA8445 transformed with plasmid pPLc28, which encodes a mutant crp gene. The mutation at position 127 (threonine replaced by isoleucine) as well as the double mutation T127I/S128A were performed using the overlap extension method with Pwo polymerase. Plasmid pHA7, which encodes mutant crp genes, was introduced into E. coli M182Δcrp. Cells were grown on LB medium at 37 °C (M182Δcrp) or 28 °C (CA8445) in a Biostat B fermentor (B. Braun Biotech International). CRP S128A expression was induced in the host bacteria by shifting the temperature from 28 to 42 °C. All proteins were purified at 4 °C essentially as described previously (8Małecki J. Polit A. Wasylewski Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8480-8486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), with one modification. After ion-exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose, the protein was additionally purified by gel filtration on Sephacryl S-200HR. After the purification procedure, the protein was highly pure (>97%) as judged by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Measurements were performed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 100 mm KCl and 1 mm EDTA (buffer A) or 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) supplemented with 100 mm KCl and 1 mm EDTA (buffer B). The following absorption coefficients were used: 14,650 m–1 cm–1 at 259 nm for cAMP (17Merck & Co., Inc.The Merck Index. 9th ed. Merck & Co., Inc., Rahway, NJ1976Google Scholar), 20,400 m–1 cm–1 at 278 nm for CRP monomer (18Takahashi M. Blazy B. Baudras A. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5124-5130Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and 6000 m–1 at 340 nm for I-EDANS (19Hudson E.N. Weber G. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 4154-4161Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Labeling of CRP—Details of the preparation of I-EDANS-labeled CRP T127I, CRP S128A, and CRP T127I/S128A were described previously (10Polit A. Błaszczyk U. Wasylewski Z. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1413-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The labeled proteins were purified on a Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated with buffer A. Fractions displaying absorbance at both 280 and 340 nm were combined and dialyzed extensively against buffer A. The stoichiometry of labeling was determined spectrophotometrically and was in the range of 1.0–1.8 mol of label/mol of CRP dimer. It has been shown previously that only Cys178 (C-terminal domain) can be chemically modified under conditions preserving its native structure (10Polit A. Błaszczyk U. Wasylewski Z. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1413-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 20Eilen E. Krakow J.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 114: 47-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Stopped-flow Fluorescence Measurements—The stopped-flow fluorescence experiments were performed using an SX-17 MV stopped-flow spectrophotometer (Applied Photophysics, Leatherhead, UK) in the two-syringe mode. The dead time of mixing was determined to be <2 ms. Conformation changes in the proteins induced by cAMP binding were monitored by the fluorescence intensity of I-EDANS covalently attached to Cys178 or by the fluorescence intensity of tryptophan residues (Trp13 and Trp85). CRP covalently labeled with I-EDANS at Cys178 (I-EDANS-CRP) was excited at 340 nm, and fluorescence emission was monitored at wavelengths >475 nm using a cutoff filter. The fluorescence intensity of tryptophan residues was observed at >320 nm using a cutoff filter after excitation at 295 nm. All measurements were performed at 20 ± 0.1 °C, and the reaction mixtures contained final concentrations of 1 μm I-EDANS-CRP and ∼2 μm CRP (for tryptophan experiments). Background measurements were also carried out at the beginning of each experiment. The sample was incubated in a stoppedflow syringe for 5 min to allow for thermal equilibration. Stopped-flow experiments were initiated by mixing equal volumes of protein (fixed concentration) and various concentrations of cAMP. Fourthousand data points were acquired in each stopped-flow experiment. Multiple kinetic runs were summed (10Polit A. Błaszczyk U. Wasylewski Z. Eur. J.

Such averaged kinetic traces were fit to a single exponential or to a sum of such terms (Equation 1), F(t)=Aexp(-kt)+C(Eq. 1) where F is the fluorescence intensity at time t; A and k are the amplitude and observed rate constant, respectively; and C is the fluorescence at infinite time. All kinetic traces were analyzed using software supplied by Applied Photophysics. The validity of the fit was evaluated by an inspection of residuals and normalized variation parameters. Binding of cAMP Monitored by I-EDANS Fluorescence—The kinetics of the binding of cAMP to the CRP T127I, CRP S128A, and CRP T127I/S128A mutants were measured as changes in the I-EDANS-CRP fluorescence using a stopped-flow method under pseudo first-order conditions. In the absence of cAMP, after excitation at 340 nm, the maximum fluorescence emission of I-EDANS was observed at ∼490 nm for all of the labeled CRP mutants. In all cases, after adding cAMP, an increase in I-EDANS fluorescence was observed with increasing ligand concentrations. The maximum increases in the fluorescence intensity of the I-EDANS moiety observed in the kinetic experiments were ∼16.5 and ∼7% for CRP T127I and CRP S128A, respectively. In addition, a blue shift occurred in the emission spectra, shifting the maximum to ∼478 and ∼480 nm and for CRP T127I and CRP S128A, respectively. The fluorescence intensity changes and the blue shift suggest that the conformational changes induced by cAMP in CRP T127I and CRP S128A are different. In the case of the CRP double mutant, the addition of the ligand did not cause significant changes in the fluorescence intensity of I-EDANS. The progress curves of the reactions of CRP T127I and CRP S128A with cAMP fit well with the single-exponential model. The addition of a second exponent did not significantly alter the goodness of the fit. The normalized variance value (obtained with the single- and double-exponential fits) indicates that the two-component analysis is not significantly better than the one-component analysis. Also, the distribution of the residuals was not improved upon the addition of the second exponent. Fig. 1 shows a typical kinetic course of the binding reaction between cAMP and CRP T127I. For the CRP T127I and CRP S128A mutants, the observed rate constants (k obs) increased with increasing ligand concentrations and approached a constant value at high millimolar concentrations of cAMP, as shown in Figs. 2 and 3. Thus, they are consistent with our previous kinetic studies using wild-type CRP (8Małecki J. Polit A. Wasylewski Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8480-8486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).Fig. 2Dependence of observed rate constants (k obs) for cAMP-induced changes in the fluorescence intensity of I-EDANS-CRP T127I on the final cAMP concentration.

Polit A. Wasylewski Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8480-8486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), hyperbolic saturation of k obs versus the cAMP concentration would indicate a two-step binding process. After a very fast binding process, the doubleligated protein undergoes conformational changes, which were observed in our measurements. Thus, the increase in rate constants accompanying the binding of cAMP at micromolar concentrations to CRP S128A and CRP T127I was analyzed in terms of a sequential (KNF) model of allostery, represented by Scheme 1, are intrinsic dissociation constants for binding of the first and second cAMP molecules to high affinity (anti) sites, respectively; and CRP and CRP* represent the protein before and after the conformational change, respectively. KC is the equilibrium constant between these two forms, whereas kc and k – c are rate constants that describe the conformational change step. If cAMP binding occurs with a simple two-step mechanism, assuming independent binding, as shown in Scheme 1, then the observed rate constant (k obs) should increase with increasing cAMP concentrations according to Equation 2. kobs=k-c+kc[cAMP]2Kanti2+2Kanti[cAMP]+[cAMP]2(Eq. 2) In Equation 2, Kanti has been considered as a geometric average of K 1 and K 2.

Open table in a new tab Binding of cAMP Monitored by Fluorescence of Tryptophan Residues—The rate of cAMP binding to CRP T127I, CRP S128A, and CRP T127I/S128A was also measured by fluorescence intensity of tryptophan residues using a stopped-flow method. As we have shown previously (8Małecki J. Polit A. Wasylewski Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8480-8486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), binding of cAMP to wild-type CRP caused significant changes in the Trp intensity only at high ligand concentrations (>300 μm). Similar observations were made with the CRP S128A mutant. However, pronounced changes in the fluorescence intensity of the tryptophan residues of CRP T127I and CRP T127I/S128A were detected only at very high concentrations of cAMP, viz. 3 and 10 mm, respectively. In all cases, mixing cAMP with CRP T127I, CRP S128A, and CRP T127I/S128A resulted in a time-dependent increase in fluorescence emission by the tryptophan residues. The fluorescence intensity increased by ∼5, 9, and 3% for CRP T127I, CRP S128A, and CRP T127I/S128A, respectively. This suggests that the conformational changes induced by cAMP in CRP T127I, CRP S128A, and CRP T127I/S128A are different. Fig. 4 presents the progress curves for association of CRP T127I, CRP S128A, and CRP T127I/S128A with 10 mm cAMP. For all concentrations of cAMP, the kinetic traces could be fitted well using a single-exponential curve; double-exponential fitting did not improve the goodness of the fit. The rate constants (k obs) calculated from the kinetic traces were plotted against the concentration of the ligand. For all investigated CRP mutants, as the cAMP concentration increased, the observed rate constants decreased, reaching a plateau at very high ligand concentrations, as shown in Fig. 5. A good description of the CRP T127I, CRP S128A, and CRP T127I/S128A interactions with cAMP was obtained using a model that we described in our previous study, where we analyzed the binding of cAMP to wild-type CRP (8Małecki J. Polit A. Wasylewski Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8480-8486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). As we have reported, at millimolar cAMP concentrations, CRP undergoes a conformational change according to a concerted (MWC) model of allostery, which can be represented by Scheme 2, where P′ and P are the binding and non-binding forms of protein; K 0 is the equilibrium constant between these two states; k on and k off are rate constants that describe the isomerization step; and K 3 and K 4 are intrinsic dissociation constants for binding of the first and second cAMP molecules to low affinity (syn) sites, respectively. The association of cAMP with CRP is a very fast process, and P and P′ are two interconvertible forms of the CRP·cAMP2 complex. The changes in fluorescence intensity of Trp residues upon the addition of cAMP observed in our experiment must be associated with the slow isomerization of the CRP·cAMP2 complex after its formation. Moreover, as these changes occur at a millimolar concentration of cAMP, they must be associated with binding of the ligand to low affinity sites of the protein.Fig. 5Dependence of observed rate constants (k obs) for cAMP-induced changes in the Trp fluorescence intensity of CRP T127I, CRP S128A, and CRP T127I/S128A on the final cAMP concentration. □, CRP T127I; ▿, CRP S128A; ○, CRP T127I/S128A.

Open table in a new tab The conformational changes induced by cAMP binding to high affinity anti-sites result in a switch of CRP from a low affinity nonspecific DNA-binding protein to a state of the protein that binds DNA with high affinity and sequence specificity. It has been accepted that this phenomenon is associated with CRP subunit-subunit realignment and hinge reorientation (11Won H.-S. Yamazaki T. Lee T.-W. Yoon M.-K. Park S.-H. Kyogoku Y. Lee B.-J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13953-13962Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and our recent experiments have shown that this change is accompanied by an ∼8-Å decrease in the distance between the two domains of the protein (10Polit A. Błaszczyk U. Wasylewski Z. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1413-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Our previous kinetic studies have demonstrated that the formation of the CRP·cAMP2 complex, after saturation of high affinity sites, is followed by a conformational change that occurs according to the sequential model of allostery (8Małecki J.
