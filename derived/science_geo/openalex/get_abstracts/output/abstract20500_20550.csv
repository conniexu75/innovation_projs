https://openalex.org/W2007660746,"Actin stress fibers are one of the major cytoskeletal structures in fibroblasts and are linked to the plasma membrane at focal adhesions. rho, a ras-related GTP-binding protein, rapidly stimulated stress fiber and focal adhesion formation when microinjected into serum-starved Swiss 3T3 cells. Readdition of serum produced a similar response, detectable within 2 min. This activity was due to a lysophospholipid, most likely lysophosphatidic acid, bound to serum albumin. Other growth factors including PDGF induced actin reorganization initially to form membrane ruffles, and later, after 5 to 10 min, stress fibers. For all growth factors tested the stimulation of focal adhesion and stress fiber assembly was inhibited when endogenous rho function was blocked, whereas membrane ruffling was unaffected. These data imply that rho is essential specifically for the coordinated assembly of focal adhesions and stress fibers induced by growth factors."
https://openalex.org/W2093226717,"The function of rac, a ras-related GTP-binding protein, was investigated in fibroblasts by microinjection. In confluent serum-starved Swiss 3T3 cells, rac1 rapidly stimulated actin filament accumulation at the plasma membrane, forming membrane ruffles. Several growth factors and activated H-ras also induced membrane ruffling, and this response was prevented by a dominant inhibitory mutant rac protein, N17rac1. This suggests that endogenous rac proteins are required for growth factor-induced membrane ruffling. In addition to membrane ruffling, a later response to both rac1 microinjection and some growth factors was the formation of actin stress fibers, a process requiring endogenous rho proteins. Using N17rac1 we have shown that these growth factors act through rac to stimulate this rho-dependent response. We propose that rac and rho are essential components of signal transduction pathways linking growth factors to the organization of polymerized actin."

https://openalex.org/W2082995803,"CILIARY neurotrophic factor (CNTF) supports the survival of embryonic motor neurons in vitro1,2 and in vivo3, and prevents lesion-mediated degeneration of rat motor neurons during early post-natal stages4. Here we report that CNTF greatly reduces all the functional and morphological changes in pmn/pmn mice5, an autosomal recessive mutant leading to progressive caudo-cranial motor neuron degeneration. The first manifestations of progressive motor neuronopathy in homozygous pmn/pmn mice become apparent in the hind limbs at the end of the third post-natal week, and all the mice die up to 6 or 7 weeks after birth from respiratory paralysis. Treatment with CNTF prolongs survival and greatly improves motor function of these mice. Moreover, morphological manifestations, such as loss of motor axons in the phrenic nerve and degeneration of facial motor neurons, were greatly reduced by CNTF, although the treatment did not start until the first symptoms of the disease had already become apparent and substan-tial degenerative changes were already present. The protective and restorative effects of CNTF in this mouse mutant give new perspectives for the treatment of human degenerative motor neuron diseases with CNTF."

https://openalex.org/W2076839443,"For S. cerevisiae cells, the assembly of a bipolar mitotic spindle requires the action of either Cin8p or Kip1p, gene products related to the mechanochemical enzyme kinesin. In this paper we demonstrate that the activity of either one of these proteins is also required following spindle assembly. When their function was eliminated, preanaphase bipolar spindles rapidly collapsed, with previously separated poles being drawn together. In contrast, anaphase spindles were apparently resistant to collapse. Deletion of kinesin-related KAR3 partially suppressed the phenotypes associated with loss of Cin8p/Kip1p function. Our findings suggest that the structure of the preanaphase bipolar spindle is maintained by counteracting forces produced by kinesin-related proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2056943636,"The sigma 70 subunit of E. coli RNA polymerase is required for sequence-specific recognition of promoter DNA. Genetic studies and sequence analysis have indicated that sigma 70 contains two specific DNA-binding domains that recognize the two conserved portions of the prokaryotic promoter. However, intact sigma 70 does not bind to DNA. Using C-terminal and internal polypeptides of sigma 70, carrying one or both putative DNA-binding domains, we demonstrate that sigma 70 does contain two DNA-binding domains, but that N-terminal sequences inhibit the ability of intact sigma 70 to bind to DNA. Thus, we propose that sigma 70 is a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein that normally functions through an allosteric interaction with the core subunits of RNA polymerase."

https://openalex.org/W1548119734,"Expression of rat procathepsin B in yeast led to the secretion of both the latent and mature forms of the enzyme. Culture in the presence of a cysteine proteinase inhibitor prevented this processing. We have expressed and purified a mutant form of rat procathepsin B whose active-site cysteine residue has been changed to a serine, and which also lacks the glycosylation site in the mature region of the protein. This non-active mutant protein was secreted essentially in an unprocessed form. The purified protein has been incubated with a variety of proteinases, and results indicate that cathepsins D and L, as well as mature cathepsin B itself, can produce a processed (single-chain) form of cathepsin B from this precursor. Amino-terminal sequencing of these processed forms has revealed that they are all elongated by a few residues with respect to the mature form found in vivo. The action of a combination of cathepsin B with dipeptidylpeptidase I produced a single-chain form of cathepsin B with the correct amino terminus. This work has also shown that the processing of procathepsin B to a single-chain form can be an autocatalytic process, in at least an intermolecular manner."
https://openalex.org/W1542499527,"Abstract Contractile activity of myosin II in smooth muscle and non-muscle cells requires phosphorylation of myosin by myosin light chain kinase. In addition, these cells have the potential for regulation at the thin filament level by caldesmon and calponin, both of which bind calmodulin. We have investigated this regulation using in vitro motility assays. Caldesmon completely inhibited the movement of actin filaments by either phosphorylated smooth muscle myosin or rabbit skeletal muscle heavy meromyosin. The amount of caldesmon required for inhibition was decreased when tropomyosin is present. Similarly, calponin binding to actin resulted in inhibition of actin filament movement by both smooth muscle myosin and skeletal muscle heavy meromyosin. Tropomyosin had no effect on the amount of calponin needed for inhibition. High concentrations of calmodulin (10 microM) in the presence of calcium completely reversed the inhibition. The nature of the inhibition by the two proteins was markedly different. Increasing caldesmon concentrations resulted in graded inhibition of the movement of actin filaments until complete inhibition of movement was obtained. Calponin inhibited actin sliding in a more all or none fashion. As the calponin concentration was increased the number of actin filaments moving was markedly decreased, but the velocity of movement remained near control values."
https://openalex.org/W1525948836,"We have analyzed the in vitro phosphorylation of tau protein by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, casein kinase II, and proline-directed serine/threonine protein kinase. These kinases phosphorylate tau protein in sites localized in different regions of the molecule, as determined by peptide mapping analyses. Focusing on the phosphorylation of tau by protein kinase C, it was calculated as an incorporation of 4 mol of phosphate/mol of tau. Limited proteolysis assays suggest that the phosphorylation sites could be located within the tubulin-binding domain. Direct phosphorylation of synthetic peptides corresponding to the cysteine-containing tubulin-binding region present in both fetal and adult tau isoforms demonstrates that serine 313 is modified by protein kinase C. Phosphorylation of the synthetic peptide by protein kinase C diminishes its binding to tubulin, as compared with the unphosphorylated peptide."
https://openalex.org/W1557552990,"Protein histidine kinase was prepared from whole cell extracts of the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The enzyme was assayed using either histone H4 or a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 70 to 102 of histone H4 as an in vitro substrate. With either substrate, both genistein and its solvent, dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), inhibited protein histidine kinase. Me2SO alone gave a cooperative dose-response curve, with inhibition changing from almost zero below 10% Me2SO to 80% at 20% Me2SO with either substrate. Genistein gave a simple dose-response curve with 50% inhibition of protein histidine kinase at 110 microM genistein. In experiments with protein histidine kinase, genistein was a noncompetitive inhibitor with respect to ATP, histone H4 or the synthetic peptide, although, in the case of the synthetic peptide, the data were also consistent with competitive inhibition. These data gave Km values for both ATP and histone H4 of 15 microM, in satisfactory agreement with previously reported values (Huang, J., Wei, Y., Kim, Y., Osterberg, L., and Matthews, H. R. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 9023-9031). The Km for the synthetic peptide was 80 microM. The KI values were 270 or 310 microM measured with histone H4 or the synthetic peptide as substrate, respectively. While these KI values are relatively high, relative to published KI values for genistein inhibition of protein tyrosine kinases, many reported experiments use genistein at concentrations where inhibition of protein histidine kinase occurs. It is possible that some of the observed effects of genistein in vivo may be due to inhibition of protein histidine kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2060845186,"A CENTRAL event in transcription is the assembly on DNA of specific complexes near the initiation sites for RNA synthesis. Activation of transcription by one class of enhancer-binding proteins requires an RNA polymerase holoenzyme' containing the specialized transcription factor, sigma-54 (σ54). We report here that σ54 alone specifically binds to promoter DNA and is responsible for many of the close contacts between RNA polymerase holoenzyme and promoter DNA, a property proposed for the major σ70 protein family. Binding of σ54 to promoter DNA is not equivalent to that of holoenzyme suggesting that there is a constraint on σ54 conformation when bound with core RNA polymerase. Footprints indicate σ54 is at the leading edge of DNA-bound holoenzyme. Like the holoenzyme1–4, σ54-binding to promoter DNA does not result in DNA strand separation. Instead the specific DNA-binding activity of σ54 assists assembly of a closed promoter complex. This complex can be isomerized to the open (DNA melted) complex by activator protein5,6, but promoter-bound σ54 alone cannot be induced to melt DNA. The pathway leading to productive transcription is similar to that proposed for eukaryotic RNA polymerase II systems."
https://openalex.org/W1494115702,"To characterize structural changes induced in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) by agonists, we have mapped the sites of photoincorporation of the cholinergic noncompetitive antagonist 3-(trifluoromethyl)-3-(m-[125I]iodophenyl)diazirine (]125I]TID) in the presence and absence of 50 microM carbamylcholine. [125I]TID binds to the AChR with similar affinity under both these conditions, but agonist inhibits photoincorporation into all subunits by greater than 75% (White, B. H., Howard, S., Cohen, S. G., and Cohen, J. B. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 21595-21607). [125I]TID-labeled sites on the beta- and delta-subunits were identified by amino-terminal sequencing of both cyanogen bromide (CNBr) and tryptic fragments purified by Tricine sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. In the absence of agonist, [125I]TID specifically labels homologous aliphatic residues (beta L-257, delta L-265, beta V-261, and delta V-269) in the M2 region of both subunits. In the presence of agonist, labeling of these residues is reduced approximately 90%, and the distribution of labeled residues is broadened to include a homologous set of serine residues at the amino terminus of M2. In the beta-subunit residues beta S-250, beta S-254, beta L-257, and beta V-261 are all labeled in the presence of carbamylcholine. This pattern of labeling supports an alpha-helical model for M2 with the labeled face forming the ion channel lumen. The observed redistribution of label in the resting and desensitized states provides the first direct evidence for an agonist-dependent rearrangement of the M2 helices. The efficient labeling of the resting state channel in a region capable of structural change also suggests a plausible model for AChR gating in which the aliphatic residues labeled by [125I]TID form a permeability barrier to the passage of ions. We also report increased labeling of the M1 region of the delta-subunit in the presence of agonist."
https://openalex.org/W1493788388,"Physiological concentrations of oleate stimulate apolipoprotein (apo) B-containing lipoprotein secretion from HepG2 cells without increasing apoB mRNA levels. The purpose of this study was to determine whether oleate acts by increasing translation of apoB mRNA or through posttranslational effects on the apoB protein. To address the mechanism of oleate-stimulated secretion of apoB, a series of carboxyl terminally truncated apoB constructs was made. Each contained the SV40 early promoter, the apoB 5'-untranslated region, and SV40 polyadenylation signals. Any difference in the response to oleate between endogenous apoB and the proteins encoded by the constructs or between the constructs themselves should thus depend on the protein sequence. Stable transformants were established for each of the constructs in the rat hepatoma cell line McArdle-RH7777. The effect of oleate on secretion of the apoB protein products was determined by labeling with [35S]methionine, immunoprecipitation, and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Carboxyl-terminal truncation of apoB41 resulted in a loss of the ability of apoB secretion to respond to oleate. Ultracentrifugation of secreted proteins on continuous CsCl gradients from 1.0-1.4 g/ml revealed that this correlated with a decrease in the ability of apoB to be recovered as a buoyant lipoprotein particle. Addition of oleate decreased the densities at which the short forms of apoB secreted as lipoproteins were recovered. Pulse-chase analysis of the secretion of apoB100 and of the truncated proteins revealed that they all underwent rapid posttranslational intracellular degradation. We conclude that oleate has no effect on the translation of apoB mRNA but promotes the secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins by reducing presecretory degradation of those forms of apoB that can produce buoyant lipoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W1499017814,"The kinetics of the binding of rVIIa to cell surface tissue factor (TF) and the resultant expression of VIIa/TF activity were studied. Binding of 125I-rVIIa (10 nM) to cell surface TF required 30-60 min for saturation, whereas VIIa/TF activity was fully expressed toward factor X (F X) on intact monolayers after only 1 min of incubation. At the time only 10-20% of the total VIIa TF complexes present at saturation had formed. Freeze-thawing the monolayers before assay increased VIIa/TF activity up to 30-fold, and the time course of its expression was similar to that of TF-specific binding of VIIa to the monolayers. Equilibrium binding revealed a single high affinity binding class of TF sites on intact monolayers for rVIIa with a Kd of 1.6 nM. Experiments with active-site inhibited rVIIa yielded evidence for two populations of VIIa. TF complexes on intact monolayers: (1) a minor population (less than 20%) that formed within 1 min of incubation and accounted for all VIIa/TF activity toward F X present on the intact monolayers, and (2) a major population that was inactive toward F X on intact monolayers but which was fully active after the monolayers were lysed. Tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI).F Xa complexes inhibited the VIIa/TF activity of the first population, i.e. of the complexes active on intact monolayers, half maximally at a concentration of 0.2 nM TFPI. TFPI/Xa also bound to the second population of VIIa.TF complexes on intact monolayers and inhibited their expression of VIIa/TF activity following cell lysis with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration of 2.0 nM. The potential physiologic implications of these findings are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1598566391,"Human platelets were found by immunoblot analysis to express protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes alpha, beta, delta, and zeta, but not gamma, epsilon, or eta. Exposure of platelets to thrombin, in the presence of 1 mM calcium, induced increased membrane association of PKC-alpha, -beta, and -zeta, while the subcellular distribution of PKC-delta remained unaltered. Maximal membrane association (2-fold) of PKC-alpha, -beta, and -zeta occurred within 1 min and was sustained for at least 10 min after the addition of thrombin. Similar results were obtained in the presence of the RGDS peptide, which blocks thrombin-induced binding of fibrinogen to its receptor, which indicates that PKC translocation was independent of fibrinogen binding. In the absence of added extracellular calcium, thrombin-induced translocation of PKC-alpha, -beta, and -zeta was transient, reaching a maximum at 1 min and returning to base line by 10 min. In the presence of calcium, thrombin induced a rapid (within 15 s) 8-fold rise in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, which returned to baseline levels within 1 min, and a biphasic increase in sn-1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG), with peaks at 15 s and 2 min, which remained elevated for at least 5 min. Chelation of external calcium abolished the second phase of DAG formation but had no effect on the kinetics or magnitude of the increase in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate or the first phase of DAG formation. Two early PKC-dependent functions, serotonin release and 40-kDa protein phosphorylation, were independent of extracellular calcium and sustained DAG. These data demonstrate that in thrombin-stimulated human platelets the duration of the increased PKC membrane association closely parallels that of increased DAG content, and sustained elevations in DAG content and PKC translocation are dependent on extracellular calcium."
https://openalex.org/W1546423706,"The lethal factor (LF) and edema factor (EF) components of anthrax toxin are toxic to animal cells only if internalized by interaction with the protective antigen (PA) component. PA binds to a cell surface receptor and is proteolytically cleaved to expose a binding site for LF and EF. To study how LF and EF are internalized and trafficked within cells, LF was fused to the translocation and ADP-ribosylation domains (domains II and III, respectively) of Pseudomonas exotoxin A. LF fusion proteins containing Pseudomonas exotoxin A domains II and III were less toxic than those containing only domain III. Fusion proteins with a functional endoplasmic reticulum retention sequence, REDLK, at the carboxyl terminus of domain III were less toxic than those with a nonfunctional sequence, LDER. The most potent fusion protein, FP33, had an EC50 = 2 pM on Chinese hamster ovary cells, exceeding that of native Pseudomonas exotoxin A (EC50 = 420 pM). Toxicity of all the fusion proteins required the presence of PA and was blocked by monensin. These data suggest that LF and LF fusion proteins are efficiently translocated from acidified endosomes directly to the cytosol without trafficking through other organelles, as is required for Pseudomonas exotoxin A. This system provides a potential vehicle for importing diverse proteins into the cytosol of mammalian cells."

https://openalex.org/W1491920498,"The tissue distribution and subcellular location of branched chain aminotransferase was analyzed using polyclonal antibodies against the enzyme purified from rat heart mitochondria (BCATm). Immunoreactive proteins were visualized by immunoblotting. The antiserum recognized a 41-kDa protein in the 100,000 x g supernatant from a rat heart mitochondrial sonicate. The 41-kDa protein was always present in mitochondria which contained branched chain aminotransferase activity, skeletal muscle, kidney, stomach, and brain, but not in cytosolic fractions. In liver mitochondria, which have very low levels of branched chain aminotransferase activity, the 41-kDa protein was not present. However, two immunoreactive proteins of slightly higher molecular masses were identified. These proteins were located in hepatocytes. The 41-kDa protein was present in fetal liver mitochondria but not in liver mitochondria from 5-day neonates. Thus disappearance of the 41-kDa protein coincided with the developmental decline in liver branched chain aminotransferase activity. Two-dimensional immunoblots of isolated BCATm immunocomplexes showed that the liver immunoreactive proteins were clearly different from the heart and kidney proteins which exhibited identical immunoblots. Investigation of BCATm in subcellular fractions prepared from different skeletal muscle fiber types revealed that branched chain aminotransferase is exclusively a mitochondrial enzyme in skeletal muscles. Although total detergent-extractable branched chain aminotransferase activity was largely independent of fiber type, branched chain aminotransferase activity and BCATm protein concentration were highest in mitochondria prepared from white gastrocnemius followed by mixed skeletal muscles with lowest activity and protein concentration found in soleus mitochondria. These quantitative differences in mitochondrial branched chain aminotransferase activity and enzyme protein content suggest there may be differential expression of BCATm in different muscle fiber types."
https://openalex.org/W1481832452,"Three chymotryptic fragments accounting for almost the entire amino acid sequence of gizzard calponin (Takahashi, K., and Nadal-Ginard, B. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 13284-13288) were isolated and characterized. They encompass the segments of residues 7-144 (NH2-terminal 13-kDa peptide), 7-182 (NH2-terminal 22-kDa peptide), and 183-292 (COOH-terminal 13-kDa peptide). They arise from the sequential hydrolysis of the peptide bonds at Tyr182-Gly183 and Tyr144-Ala145 which were protected by the binding of F-actin to calponin. Only the NH2-terminal 13- and 22-kDa fragments were retained by immobilized Ca(2+)-calmodulin, but only the larger 22 kDa entity cosedimented with F-actin and inhibited, in the absence of Ca(2+)-calmodulin, the skeletal actomyosin subfragment-1 ATPase activity as the intact calponin. Since the latter peptide differs from the NH2-terminal 13-kDa fragment by a COOH-terminal 38-residue extension, this difference segment appears to contain the actin-binding domain of calponin. Zero-length cross-linked complexes of F-actin and either calponin or its 22-kDa peptide were produced. The total CNBr digest of the F-actin-calponin conjugate was fractionated over immobilized calmodulin. The EGTA-eluted pair of cross-linked actin-calponin peptides was composed of the COOH-terminal actin segment of residues 326-355 joined to the NH2-terminal calponin region of residues 52-168 which seems to contain the major determinants for F-actin and Ca(2+)-calmodulin binding."
https://openalex.org/W1603481918,"Factor VIII functions in an enzyme complex upon the activated platelet membrane where phosphatidylserine exposure correlates with expression of receptors for factor VIII. To evaluate the specificity of phosphatidylserine-containing membrane binding sites for factor VIII, we have developed a novel membrane model in which phospholipid bilayers are supported by glass microspheres (lipospheres). The binding of fluorescein-labeled factor VIII to lipospheres with membranes of 15% phosphatidylserine was equivalent to binding to phospholipid vesicles (KD = 4.8 nM). Purified von Willebrand factor (vWf), a carrier protein for factor VIII, decreased membrane binding of factor VIII with a Ki of 10 micrograms/ml. Likewise, normal plasma decreased bound factor VIII by more than 90% whereas plasma lacking vWf decreased the binding of factor VIII by only 20%. Proteolytic activation of factor VIII by thrombin, which releases factor VIII from vWf, increased liposphere binding in the presence of vWf and in the presence of normal plasma. Although factor V is homologous to factor VIII and binds to lipospheres with the same affinity, purified factor V was not an efficient competitor for the membrane binding sites of factor VIII. These results indicate that phosphatidylserine-containing membrane sites have sufficient specificity to select thrombin-activated factor VIII from the range of phospholipid-binding proteins in plasma."
https://openalex.org/W1562095280,"Indolepyruvate decarboxylase, a key enzyme for indole-3-acetic acid biosynthesis, was found in extracts of Enterobacter cloacae. The enzyme catalyzes the decarboxylation of indole-3-pyruvic acid to yield indole-3-acetaldehyde and carbon dioxide. The enzyme was purified to apparent homogeneity from Escherichia coli cells harboring the genetic locus for this enzyme obtained from E. cloacae. The results of gel filtration experiments showed that indolepyruvate decarboxylase is a tetramer with an M(r) of 240,000. In the absence of thiamine pyrophosphate and Mg2+, the active tetramers dissociate into inactive monomers and dimers. However, the addition of thiamine pyrophosphate and Mg2+ to the inactive monomers and dimers results in the formation of active tetramers. These results indicate that the thiamine pyrophosphate-Mg2+ complex functions in the formation of the tetramer, which is the enzymatically active holoenzyme. The enzyme exhibited decarboxylase activity with indole-3-pyruvic acid and pyruvic acid as substrates, but no decarboxylase activity was apparent with L-tryptophan, indole-3-lactic acid, beta-phenylpyruvic acid, oxalic acid, oxaloacetic acid, and acetoacetic acid. The Km values for indole-3-pyruvic acid and pyruvic acid were 15 microM and 2.5 mM, respectively. These results indicate that indole-3-acetic acid biosynthesis in E. cloacae is mediated by indolepyruvate decarboxylase, which has a high specificity and affinity for indole-3-pyruvic acid."
https://openalex.org/W1540680229,"Cementum is the mineralized structure that covers the surface of the roots of teeth; it serves as the attachment site for collagen fibers of adjacent soft connective tissues. Very little is known about how cementum formation is regulated or how it affects other periodontal structures. We have raised a monoclonal antibody that may aid in studies to determine the biology and function of cementum. Mice were immunized with a 55-kDa attachment protein partially purified from human cementum and a monoclonal antibody, H166, was produced. Incubation of tissue sections with this antibody and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody revealed that it immunostains cementum but not dentin, gingiva, or periodontal ligament. Alveolar bone did not bind the antibody, although a few paravascular cells were positive. Long bones, kidney, liver, skin, and several other tissues were negative. Protein fractions separated from cementum extracts by binding to immobilized H166 column contained 55-, 49-, 39-, 29- to 31-, and 23-to 26-kDa components that cross-reacted with the antibody in Western blots; these components were previously shown to be derived from a common precursor. We conclude that the antibody recognizes a group of proteins related to 55-kDa attachment protein in cementum. Our data show that the antibody could serve as a marker for cementum.— Arzate, H.; Olson, S. W.; Page, R. C.; Gown, A. M., Narayanan, A. S.

https://openalex.org/W1550569605,"Utilizing protein engineering of troponin C (TnC), combined with the physiology of skinned fibers, the present study sought to delineate the mechanisms for metal ion coordination and sensitivity in the sites (EF-hands) that execute the Ca2+ switch for contraction. A total TnC-encoding gene comprising multiple target sequences for restriction enzymes was synthesized, furnishing a pliant molecular handle to manipulate sites I and II in the NH2 terminus of the protein. Of the six positions (X, Y, Z, -Y, -X, and -Z) essential for metal ion chelation in a typical EF-hand, invariably the X position has aspartate, and -Z position has glutamate. In the X position of site II, mutation of aspartate for either glutamate (gamma-carboxylate) or asparagine (same side chain length as aspartate) yielded functionally inactive proteins with concomitantly diminished Ca2+ binding capacity. Similarly, in -Z position (site I), neither aspartate nor glutamine were compatible in exchange for the conserved glutamate. In contrast, for the Y coordinate of site II, a preference for asparagine comparable to that for wild-type aspartate was detected, but glutamate was impermissible. Evidently, physicochemical and steric factors both are critical in governing the mechanism for metal ion chelation in TnC in a physiological milieu. Furthermore, the findings manifest that the quaternary structure of hydrated TnC restrains the EF-hands during on-off operation of the Ca2+ switch."
https://openalex.org/W2015944075,"Coliphage N4 virion-encapsidated, DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (vRNAP) is inactive on double-stranded N4 DNA; however, denatured promoter-containing templates are accurately transcribed. We report that all determinants of vRNAP promoter recognition exist in the template strand, indicating that this enzyme is a site-specific, single-stranded DNA-binding protein. We show that conserved sequences and the integrity of inverted repeats present at the promoters are essential for activity, suggesting the necessity for specific secondary structure. Evidence for such a structure is presented. We propose a model for in vivo utilization of vRNAP promoters in which template negative supercoiling yields single-strandedness at the promoter to reveal the determinants of vRNAP binding. This structure is stabilized by the binding of E. coli single-stranded DNA-binding protein to yield an ""activated promoter."""
https://openalex.org/W1494502407,"The soybean vegetative storage protein genes (vspA, and vspB) are regulated in a complex manner developmentally and in response to external stimuli such as wounding and water deficit. The proteins accumulate to almost one-half the amount of soluble leaf protein when soybean plants are continually depodded and have been identified as storage proteins because of their abundance and pattern of expression in plant tissues. We have shown that purified VSP homodimers (VSP alpha and VSP beta) and heterodimers (VSP alpha/beta) possess acid phosphatase activity (alpha = 0.3-0.4 units/mg; beta = 2-4 units/mg; alpha/beta = 7-10 units/mg). Specific activities were determined by monitoring o-carboxyphenyl phosphate (0.7 mM) cleavage at pH 5.5 (VSP alpha) or pH 5.0 (VSP alpha/beta and VSP beta) in 0.15 M sodium acetate buffer at 25 degrees C. These enzymes are active over a broad pH range, maintaining greater than 40% of maximal activity from pH 4.0 to 6.5 and having maximal activity at pH 5.0-5.5. They are inactivated by sodium fluoride, sodium molybdate, and heating at 70 degrees C for 10 min. These phosphatases can liberate Pi from several different substrates, including napthyl acid phosphate, carboxyphenyl phosphate, sugar-phosphates, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, dihydroxyacetone phosphate, phosphoenolpyruvate, ATP, ADP, PPi, and short chain polyphosphates.

Apparent Km and Vmax values at 25 degrees C and pH 5.0 were 42 microM and 2.0 mumol/min/mg, 150 microM and 4.2 mumol/min/mg, and 420 microM and 4.1 mumol/min/mg, for tetrapolyphosphate, pyrophosphate, and phosphoenolpyruvate, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1569777370,"alpha-Tocopherol and three derivatives in which the phytol chain is modified or deleted were examined for their effect on cultured keratinocyte arachidonic acid metabolism. 2,2,5,7,8-Pentamethyl-6-hydroxychromane (PMC), in which the phytol chain is replaced by a methyl group, inhibited basal, bradykinin (BK)- and A23187-stimulated prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthesis with an apparent Ki of 1.3 microM. The Ki of the analogue with six carbon atoms in the side chain (C6) was 5 microM while that of the C11 analogue was 10 microM. No effect of alpha-tocopherol was observed. The mechanism of inhibition was studied using PMC. The effect of PMC on phospholipase and cyclooxygenase activity was assayed using stable isotope mass measurements of PGE2 formation, which assesses arachidonate release and cyclooxygenase metabolism simultaneously. BK-stimulated formation of PGE2, derived from endogenous phospholipid, was decreased 60% by 5 microM PMC and eliminated by 50 microM PMC, compared with controls. No difference in PGE2 formed from exogenous arachidonic acid was observed, indicating no effect of PMC on cyclooxygenase activity. In contrast, no effect of 5 microM PMC was observed on BK-stimulated [3H]arachidonic acid release from prelabeled cultures. The capacity of PMC to inhibit phospholipase activity in vitro was also assessed. PMC inhibited hydrolysis of phospholipid substrate by up to 60%. These results suggest that alpha-tocopherol analogues with alterations in the phytol chain inhibit eicosanoid synthesis by preferential inhibition of phospholipase."
https://openalex.org/W1672031277,"DNA photolyase from the cyanobacterium Anacystis nidulans contains two chromophores, flavin adenine dinucleotide (FADH2) and 8-hydroxy-5-deazaflavin (8-HDF) (Eker, A. P. M., Kooiman, P., Hessels, J. K. C., and Yasui, A. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 8009-8015). While evidence exists that the flavin chromophore (in FADH2 form) can catalyze photorepair directly and that the 8-HDF chromophore is the major photosensitizer in photoreactivation it was not known whether 8-HDF splits pyrimidine dimer directly or indirectly through energy transfer to FADH2 at the catalytic center. We constructed a plasmid which over-produces the A. nidulans photolyase in Escherichia coli and purified the enzyme from this organism. Apoenzyme was prepared and enzyme containing stoichiometric amounts of either or both chromophores was reconstituted. The substrate binding and catalytic activities of the apoenzyme (apoE), E-FADH2, E-8-HDF, E-FAD(ox)-8-HDF, and E-FADH2-8-HDF were investigated. We found that FAD is required for substrate binding and catalysis and that 8-HDF is not essential for binding DNA, and participates in catalysis only through energy transfer to FADH2. The quantum yields of energy transfer from 8-HDF to FADH2 and of electron transfer from FADH2 to thymine dimer are near unity."
https://openalex.org/W1490824550,"Soluble fibrinogen binding to the glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex (integrin alpha IIb beta 3) requires platelet activation. The intracellular mediator(s) that convert glycoprotein IIb-IIIa into an active fibrinogen receptor have not been identified. Because the lipid composition of the platelet plasma membrane undergoes changes during activation, we investigated the effects of lipids on the fibrinogen binding properties of purified glycoprotein IIb-IIIa. Anion exchange chromatography of lipids extracted from platelets exposed to thrombin or other platelet agonists resolved an activity that increased fibrinogen binding to glycoprotein IIb-IIIa. A monoester phosphate was important for activity, and phosphatidic acid coeluted with the peak of activity. Purified phosphatidic acid dose-dependently promoted a specific interaction between glycoprotein IIb-IIIa and fibrinogen which possessed many but not all of the properties of fibrinogen binding to activated platelets. Phosphatidic acid appeared to increase the proportion of fibrinogen binding-competent glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complexes without altering their affinity for fibrinogen. The effects of phosphatidic acid were a result of specific structural properties of the lipid and were not mimicked by other phospholipids. Lysophosphatidic acid, however, was a potent inducer of fibrinogen binding to glycoprotein IIb-IIIa. These results demonstrate that specific lipids can affect fibrinogen binding to purified glycoprotein IIb-IIIa and suggest that the lipid environment has the potential to influence fibrinogen binding to its receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1854163794,"Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is a dimeric protein composed of A- and B-chains (AA, AB, and BB). PDGF purified from human platelets has been shown to be composed primarily of the AB heterodimer. Immunoblots of total platelet extracts, cell-bound PDGF from the platelet extracts, and acute human wound fluid with PDGF A- and B-chain-specific antisera all demonstrate that the PDGF A-chain is the predominant peptide. Chemotactic and immunochemical assays of chromatographic fractions during PDGF isolation support these observations and demonstrate that PDGF AA can be separated from PDGF AB and BB by ion exchange chromatography. These studies indicate that the AA isoform constitutes the major PDGF dimer contained in human platelets and is the major form present at sites of injury during the acute phase of the wound repair response.— Soma, Y.; Dvonch, V.; Grotendorst, G.

https://openalex.org/W2114824538,"The kinetics of K(+)-leucine cotransport in the midgut of lepidopteran larvae was investigated using brush border membrane vesicles. Initial rate (3 s) of leucine uptake was determined under experimental conditions similar to those occurring in vivo, i.e. in the presence of delta psi much greater than 0 (inside negative) and a delta pH of 1.4 units (7.4in/8.8out). Leucine and K+ bind to the carrier according to a sequential mechanism, and the binding of one substrate changed the dissociation constant for the other substrate by a factor of 0.15. Both trans-K+ and trans-leucine were mixed-type inhibitors of leucine uptake. Moreover, a portion of total leucine uptake was K+ independent, and it was competitively inhibited by trans-leucine. We interpret the trans inhibitory effects to mean that the partially loaded K+ only form is virtually unable to translocate across the membrane, whereas the binary complex carrier, leucine, can isomerize from the trans to the cis side of the membrane. However, the K(+)-independent leucine uptake occurs with a Keq greater than 1, i.e. the efflux route through the partially loaded leucine only form is slower than the rate of isomerization of the unloaded carrier from trans to cis side. Taken together, these results suggest a model in which transport occurs by an iso-random Bi Bi system. Since K+ does not act as a pure competitive activator, this model is different from that proposed for most of the Na(+)-linked solutes transport agencies and may be related to the broadening of the cation specificity of the amino acid transporters in lepidopteran larvae."
https://openalex.org/W1500448079,"Expression of insulin and immunoglobulin genes is dependent on the presence of E boxes (consensus sequence CAXXTG) within the enhancer regions. These sequences are recognized by cell-specific nuclear factors IEF1 (insulin enhancer factor 1) and LEF1 (lymphoid enhancer factor 1). Although IEF1 and LEF1 are distinct by several parameters, they are both recognized by antisera to the mouse helix-loop-helix (HLH) protein A1 (a homolog of the human protein E47, product of the E2A gene). This suggests that A1/E47 or a close relative is a component of both complexes. In order to further characterize the complexes, we have used in vitro translated DNA-binding proteins of known size to verify that electrophoretic mobility shift analysis can be used to estimate the molecular weight of DNA-binding proteins from both the HLH family and the leucine zipper family. Under the conditions used, migration is relatively insensitive to changes in protein charge. This analysis, in combination with mixing experiments between nuclear extracts and in vitro translated HLH proteins, indicates that IEF1 and LEF1 are dimeric complexes. IEF1 behaves as a complex of two proteins, one of which is 67 kDa and is recognized by antibodies to A1, and the second of which is 25 kDa. LEF1 on the other hand, appears to be a complex of two proteins of 67 kDa. The size of the 67-kDa subunits is consistent with that reported for the full-length E2A gene products. The 25-kDa subunit of IEF1 forms DNA-binding heterodimers with A1 but not MyoD and is present in a limited range of cell types, features characteristic of class B HLH proteins such as MyoD and achaete-scute. Taken together, the data support the idea that the E2A gene products are involved directly in regulation of insulin and immunoglobulin gene expression; regulation of the insulin gene apparently requires, in addition, the 25-kDa HLH protein (designated IESF1 for insulin enhancer-specific factor 1)."
https://openalex.org/W1605118125,Hepatic sterol carrier protein-2 (SCP2) and sterol carrier protein-X (SCPx) levels in normal and in mutant Niemann-Pick Type C mice were determined by immunoblotting with antiserum against rat SCP2. A 14-kDa protein (SCP2) was detected in the cytosol fraction and a 58-kDa protein (SCPx) was found in both cytosolic and organellar fractions. Expression of hepatic SCPx protein was developmentally regulated in a sex-specific pattern. The amounts of organelle-associated SCPx increased 4-fold during sexual development of normal males but decreased dramatically during development of normal females. Levels of hepatic SCP2 increased much less dramatically during sexual maturation of normal males and females. Adult Niemann-Pick Type C mice were deficient in both hepatic SCPx and SCP2. The deficit in SCPx in affected males reflected a failure to increase hepatic SCPx levels during sexual maturation. In affected males SCPx remained at levels found in immature mice. Affected male and female mice were also unable to maintain levels of hepatic SCP2. The level of SCP2 was near normal in affected immature males and subnormal in affected immature females. During sexual maturation hepatic SCP2 declined in affected animals.
https://openalex.org/W1598459162,"Chemical conjugates of recombinant soluble CD4 (sCD4) with toxins, or with antibodies that activate cytotoxic T cells, can be used to direct selective killing of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected cells. This approach takes advantage of the ability of sCD4 to bind with high affinity to gp120, the envelope protein of HIV-1, which is expressed on actively infected cells. However, conjugation of sCD4 via reagents that target amino groups may reduce its affinity for gp120, since at least one such group is important for gp120 binding. Here, we describe a novel cross-linking reagent which enables the conjugation of sCD4 via its carbohydrate moieties rather than its free amino groups. This heterobifunctional reagent, 4-(4-N-maleimidophenyl)butyric acid hydrazide (MPBH), combines a nucleophilic hydrazide with an electrophilic maleimide, thereby allowing coupling of carbohydrate-derived aldehydes to free thiols. We describe conditions by which MPBH is coupled selectively to the sialic acid residues of sCD4, and exemplify the use of MPBH by conjugating sCD4 to hemoglobin and to beta-galactosidase. We show that, whereas conjugation of sCD4 via amino groups markedly reduces its gp120 binding affinity, conjugation via the carbohydrate chains using MPBH does not affect binding. Moreover, we demonstrate the ability of a sCD4-MPBH-fluorescein conjugate to label HIV-infected human CEM cells selectively. These results indicate that, by targeting its carbohydrate moieties, sCD4 can be cross-linked to other molecules without compromising its function. The approach described here can be useful for glycoproteins in which amino groups, but not carbohydrates, are important for function. More generally, this approach can be considered for use in cross-linking glycoconjugates to compounds which either contain thiols, or to which thiols can be added."
https://openalex.org/W1564618126,"It has been shown previously by others that transcription is temporally correlated with the onset of V(D)J recombination at the endogenous antigen receptor loci. We have been interested in determining whether this temporal correlation indicates a causal connection between these two processes. We have compared V(D)J recombination minichromosome substrates that have transcripts running through the recombination zone with substrates that do not in a transient transfection assay. In this system, the substrates acquire a minichromosome conformation within the first several hours after transfection. We find that the substrates recombine equally well over a 100-fold range in transcriptional variation. In additional studies, we have taken substrates that have low levels of transcription and inhibited transcription further by methylating the substrate DNA or by treating the cells with a general transcription inhibitor (alpha-amanitin). Although these treatments decrease the level of expression an additional 10-100-fold, there is still no observable effect on V(D)J recombination. Based on these results, we conclude that transcription is not necessary for the V(D)J reaction mechanism and does not alter substrate structure at the DNA level or at the simplest levels of chromatin structure in a way that affects the reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1548897196,"Matrix protein effects on the differentiated activity of osteoclasts were examined in order to understand the functional significance of bone protein interactions with osteoclasts. Bone acidic glycoprotein 75 (BAG 75) from rat calvariae inhibited the resorption of bone by isolated rat osteoclasts with IC50 = 1 nM compared to IC50 = 10 nM for chicken osteoclasts. By contrast, other phosphoproteins similarly isolated from bone were less effective in inhibiting resorption with IC50 = 100 nM osteopontin and IC50 greater than 100 nM bone sialoprotein. Likewise, RGD-containing matrix proteins vitronectin, thrombospondin, and fibronectin all displayed IC50 greater than or equal to 100 nM. Mechanistically, 10 nM BAG 75 marginally slowed, but did not block, the association of bone particles with chicken osteoclasts compared with osteopontin or control media. Pretreatment of osteoclasts with 50 nM BAG 75 had no effect on subsequent bone resorption; however, pretreatment of bone with BAG 75 before incubation with osteoclasts reduced the extent of resorption by 55%. These data suggest that a BAG 75/bone surface complex, rather than BAG 75 alone, represents the inhibitory form. Consistent with this hypothesis, direct binding studies provided no evidence of specific, high-affinity receptors on osteoclasts for BAG 75, nor was an excess of BAG 75 (100 nM) able to compete with 0.3 nM sechistatin for osteoclastic avB3-like receptors. However, BAG 75 displayed cooperative binding to tissue fragments and bone particles at concentrations greater than 10 nM, suggesting that BAG 75 self-associates into higher-order species on bone surfaces. Electron microscopy confirmed the time-dependent polymerization of BAG 75 into interconnecting filaments. These data suggest a novel, inhibitory activity for surface-bound BAG 75 on bone resorption that does not appear to involve the osteoclastic avB3-like integrin."
https://openalex.org/W1608043654,"The interaction between troponin I and troponin C plays a critical role in the regulation of muscle contraction. In this study the interaction between troponin C (TnC) and the N-terminal region of TnI was investigated by the synthesis of three TnI peptides (residues 1-40/Rp, 10-40, and 20-40). The regulatory peptide (Rp) on binding to TnC prevents the ability of TnC to release the inhibition of the acto-S1-tropomyosin ATPase activity caused by TnI or the TnI inhibitory peptide (Ip), residues 104-115. A stable complex between TnC and Rp in the presence of Ca2+ was demonstrated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of 6 M urea. Rp was able to displace TnI from a preformed TnI.TnC complex. In the absence of Ca2+, Rp was unable to maintain a complex with TnC in benign conditions of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis which demonstrates the Ca(2+)-dependent nature of this interaction. Size-exclusion chromatography demonstrated that the TnC.Rp complex consisted of a 1:1 complex. The results of these studies have shown that the N-terminal region of TnI (1-40) plays a critical role in modulating the Ca(2+)-sensitive release of TnI inhibition by TnC."
https://openalex.org/W1507889270,"To gain insight into the structural requirements for tyrosine sulfation in vivo, we have constructed and expressed an artificial gene encoding a polypeptide substrate for tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase. This gene codes for a protein, referred to as sulfophilin, which consists of a 12-times repeated heptapeptide unit corresponding to the identified tyrosine sulfation site of chromogranin B (secretogranin I), Glu-Glu-Pro-Glu-Tyr-Gly-Glu. The gene was fused to the signal sequence of secretogranin II to direct the sulfophilin protein to the secretory pathway. Stable expression of the artificial gene in NIH 3T3 cells resulted in the secretion of sulfated sulfophilin. Analysis of the stoichiometry of sulfation revealed that each of the 12 tyrosyl residues in sulfophilin was sulfated. Remarkably, up to 50% of the total protein-bound tyrosine sulfate secreted by the cells was contained in sulfophilin. The results indicate that the structural information contained in the heptapeptide motif is sufficient for stoichiometric tyrosine sulfation to occur in the living cell."

To determine the amino acid residues responsible for binding thymine photodimers, a photoaffinity reagent, 4-(1-azi-2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)-benzoate, was linked to the aminoalkylphosphonate of a thymine photodimer in a 14-mer duplex. The reactive substrate was treated with the enzyme under UV light (365 nm). The nascent enzyme and the modified enzyme were treated with lysyl endopeptidase, and the peptide maps were compared. Three peptides from the C terminus were found to interact with the reactive oligonucleotide to various extents. The three modified peptides were isolated and analyzed by Edman degradation. The amino acid residues Gly-133, Tyr-129, and Thr-89 were partially linked with the reactive substrate and may be involved in the binding of thymine photodimers."

It was sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, The American Association of Immunologists, and the Clinical Immunology Society. Five topics were discussed by leading researchers in areas of immunology that currently are of exceptional interest and show promise of leading to new advances in the prevention and treatment of human diseases. The topics included: the interactions between immunogenic peptides, class I MHC molecules and T cell receptors; initiation, maintenance, and breakdown of self-tolerance in B lymphocytes; inflammatory disease in HLA-B27 transgenic rats; properties and functions of interleukin-10; and transforming growth factor-beta in reproductive immunology. The exceptional quality of the presentations in this seventh symposium exemplified perfectly the path of basic research that often leads from the laboratory to the clinic."
