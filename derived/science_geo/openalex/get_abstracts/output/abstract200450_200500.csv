https://openalex.org/W2048771036,"CULTURES of cells from the buffy coat of the blood were described by Carrel and Ebeling in 19221, and since then they have been used by many workers. Several have described the appearance of fibrocytic cells in these cultures2. They have been reported as early as one day after explantation, and Hulliger2, using mainly rabbit buffy coat, found that within one to three weeks cultures of fibrocytic cells were frequently formed in which a high level of mitosis occurred. It would be useful to be able to establish strains of cells from individuals whenever they are required for certain genetic studies, and since the peripheral blood is the easiest tissue to obtain aseptically from volunteers, the possibility that permanent strains might be developed from this source was investigated. Strains were established from four out of five bloods. The technique used is as follows."

https://openalex.org/W1963746367,"ALTHOUGH claims for nitrogen fixation by Gram-negative bacteria other than the Azotobacter have been made in the past1, confirmation of such claims is comparatively recent2–5. Nitrogen fixation by particular strains of Pseudomonas has been reported by Anderson2 and by Voets and Debacker3. Recently, Jensen5 isolated from a Danish water-course a nitrogen-fixing organism that appears to be a species of Achromobacter. In most of these studies, the investigators were attempting to obtain species such as Azotobacter that are known to fix nitrogen; hence the techniques employed would select for this characteristic. Because of the significance of the discovery of these new agents for both theoretical and applied biology we have examined strains of Pseudomonas and Achromobacter that had been isolated under non-selective conditions."

The example they gave was a pair of dyes, orange II and methylene blue. These substances were introduced continuously on to a hanging paper at two separate points. They ran down vertically due to gravity and at the same time migrated horizontally towards each other under the influence of the applied electrical field. It was anticipated that the procedure would be applicable not only to the molecular compounds of dyestuffs but also to antigen–antibody complex formation. However, simpler methods have been devised for the antigen–antibody reaction2–4."

https://openalex.org/W1996607940,"GAS chromatography has been employed in separating numerous types of compounds, but has not yet been applied to the alkaloids, a field where it might find particular utility. We wish to report preliminary results clearly indicating the usefulness of gas chromatography in the study of the tobacco alkaloids. Other families of alkaloids having slight volatility and good thermal stability may also prove to be separable under similar conditions."

https://openalex.org/W2064023055,"Heinemann and Glenn1 observed that certain bacteria were agglutinated in milk serum and concluded that this was possibly related to the germicidal action of milk. Chambers2 made similar observations but could find no correlation between agglutination and germicidal action. Hobbs3 examined a variety of milk organisms and attributed the clumping effect of milk on some of them to agglutinins which were probably non-specific. More recently, Wright and Tramer4 demonstrated that certain organisms noted for slow acid production in activity tests of cheese starters were agglutinated in heat-treated milk. The lag in acid production was shown to be due not to agglutination but to the removal of the agglutinated organisms by the rising cream."

https://openalex.org/W2038282885,"THE observation of Lorente de No1, that small frog axons (“Et fibres”) are excitable in media where the sodium is totally replaced by certain quaternary ammonium, ions, has since been extended to crustacean muscle fibres2, frog A-fibres3,4, frog spinal ganglion cell-bodies5 and mammalian striated muscle6,7 and nerve8 fibres. Such findings suggested that the membrane of muscle fibres and neurones in different species was capable of maintaining excitability when the external sodium was replaced by a favourable cation possessing a tetracovalent nitrogen atom. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether synaptic transmission could also be maintained in sodium-free media. It is well known that the membrane characteristics of the junctional region are somewhat different from those possessing the conductile activity, since the post-synaptic membrane produces graded responses by the action of the transmitter released from the pre-synaptic membrane. It was previously reported9 that in the frog spinal ganglion cell-bodies hydrazinium ion was the most favourable substitute for sodium ion; the action potentials of cell-bodies being very similar to those observed in normal Ringer. An attempt to replace sodium ion by hydrazinium ion was quite successful; the neuromuscular transmission was restored in the sodium-free hydrazinium solution."
