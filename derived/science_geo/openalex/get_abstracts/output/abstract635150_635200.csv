https://openalex.org/W2953177586,"We introduce APEX-seq, a method for RNA sequencing based on direct proximity labeling of RNA using the peroxidase enzyme APEX2. APEX-seq in nine distinct subcellular locales produced a nanometer-resolution spatial map of the human transcriptome as a resource, revealing extensive patterns of localization for diverse RNA classes and transcript isoforms. We uncover a radial organization of the nuclear transcriptome, which is gated at the inner surface of the nuclear pore for cytoplasmic export of processed transcripts. We identify two distinct pathways of messenger RNA localization to mitochondria, each associated with specific sets of transcripts for building complementary macromolecular machines within the organelle. APEX-seq should be widely applicable to many systems, enabling comprehensive investigations of the spatial transcriptome."

Tissue regeneration is achieved through the coordinated regulation of tissue destruction via removal of damaged cells, tissue repair via the release of pro-regenerative signals (often pro-inflammatory cytokines), and production of replacement cells by activated tissue-specific stem cells (Naik et al., 2018Naik S.

Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) produce all mature blood cells and regenerate the blood system throughout life (Orkin and Zon, 2008Orkin S.H. Zon L.I.

The vast majority of adult HSCs are kept quiescent in the bone marrow (BM) and survive environmental stresses that kill most progenitor and mature cells (Mohrin et al., 2010Mohrin M. Bourke E.

HSCs respond to a wide range of insults by activating their metabolism and cell-cycle machinery, mobilizing into the circulation, and changing their differentiation output to increase the production of specific blood lineages (Baldridge et al., 2010Baldridge M.T. King K.Y. Boles N.C. Weksberg D.C.

While all these mechanisms allow for HSC maintenance and rapid recovery of blood homeostasis after injury, how they are triggered and integrated to mediate an effective regenerative response remains elusive. The tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) is one of the most intensively studied pro-inflammatory cytokines with central roles in mammalian immunity and cellular homeostasis (Silke and Hartland, 2013Silke J. Hartland E.L. Masters, marionettes and modulators: intersection of pathogen virulence factors and mammalian death receptor signaling.Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2013; 25: 436-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). TNF-α is a prototypical death ligand induced upon infection that can elicit two types of programmed cell death, apoptosis and necroptosis (Brenner et al., 2015Brenner D. Blaser H. Mak T.W. Regulation of tumour necrosis factor signalling: live or let die.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2015; 15: 362-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). The fate of a TNF-α-exposed cell depends on the cellular context, particularly the ubiquitylation status of the receptor-interacting serine-threonine kinase 1 (RIPK1) enzyme, which is in large part regulated by the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (cIAP) E3 ubiquitin ligases. Upon TNF-α binding to its receptors (TNF-R), poly-ubiquitylated RIPK1 acts as a scaffold protein necessary for activating pro-survival signaling, essentially the canonical nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathway. In situations where RIPK1 remains non-ubiquitylated, such as upon cIAP depletion, RIPK1 assembles with initiator caspases (CASPs) including CASP-8, whose activation leads to the execution of classical CASP-3/7-mediated apoptosis. In contrast, in cells where CASPs are inactivated, RIPK1 phosphorylates RIPK3, which in turn phosphorylates the mixed-lineage kinase-domain-like (MLKL) protein, resulting in the execution of necroptosis (Brenner et al., 2015Brenner D. Blaser H. Mak T.W. Regulation of tumour necrosis factor signalling: live or let die.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2015; 15: 362-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Despite such a detailed molecular understanding of TNF-α mechanisms of action, its role in HSC regulation remains controversial. Earlier studies report conflicting results for the effect of TNF-α on growth and proliferation of human hematopoietic progenitor in vitro, ranging from potent inhibition (Broxmeyer et al., 1986Broxmeyer H.E. Williams D.E. Lu L. Cooper S. Anderson S.L. Beyer G.S. Hoffman R. Rubin B.Y. The suppressive influences of human tumor necrosis factors on bone marrow hematopoietic progenitor cells from normal donors and patients with leukemia: synergism of tumor necrosis factor and interferon-gamma.J. Immunol. 1986; 136: 4487-4495PubMed Google Scholar) to actual stimulation (Caux et al., 1990Caux C. Saeland S. Favre C. Duvert V. Mannoni P. Banchereau J. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha strongly potentiates interleukin-3 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor-induced proliferation of human CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells.Blood. 1990; 75: 2292-2298PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, studies using TNF-R knockout mice show opposite effects as to whether TNF-α acts in a positive (Pearl-Yafe et al., 2010Pearl-Yafe M. Mizrahi K. Stein J. Yolcu E.S. Kaplan O. Shirwan H. Yaniv I. Askenasy N. Tumor necrosis factor receptors support murine hematopoietic progenitor function in the early stages of engraftment.Stem Cells. 2010; 28: 1270-1280PubMed Google Scholar) or negative (Pronk et al., 2011Pronk C.J. Veiby O.P. Bryder D. Jacobsen S.E. Tumor necrosis factor restricts hematopoietic stem cell activity in mice: involvement of two distinct receptors.J. Exp. Med. 2011; 208: 1563-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) manner on the survival of HSC-enriched populations. The impact of TNF-α on HSC engraftment potential is also highly debated, since both promoting and inhibitory effects are observed, depending on the experimental setting (Ishida et al., 2017Ishida T. Suzuki S. Lai C.Y. Yamazaki S. Kakuta S. Iwakura Y. Nojima M. Takeuchi Y. Higashihara M. Nakauchi H. Otsu M. Pre-transplantation blockade of TNF-α-mediated oxygen species accumulation protects hematopoietic stem cells.Stem Cells. 2017; 35: 989-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, Pronk et al., 2011Pronk C.J. Veiby O.P. Bryder D. Jacobsen S.E. Tumor necrosis factor restricts hematopoietic stem cell activity in mice: involvement of two distinct receptors.J. Exp. Med. 2011; 208: 1563-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In addition, TNF-α, like other classical inflammatory signals, has emerged as an essential regulator of HSC ontogeny during embryonic development (Espin-Palazon et al., 2018Espin-Palazon R. Weijts B. Mulero V. Traver D. Proinflammatory signals as fuel for the fire of hematopoietic stem cell emergence.Trends Cell Biol. 2018; 28: 58-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). RIPK1 has also been suggested to be critical for protection of hematopoietic cells from TNF-α-driven necroptosis (Roderick et al., 2014Roderick J.E. Hermance N. Zelic M. Simmons M.J. Polykratis A. Pasparakis M. Kelliher M.A. Hematopoietic RIPK1 deficiency results in bone marrow failure caused by apoptosis and RIPK3-mediated necroptosis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111: 14436-14441Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), yet the ability of TNF-α to induce necroptosis in the most primitive HSCs and the importance of TNF-α-driven necroptosis in regulating HSC viability and function remain largely unaddressed. Here, we set out to clarify the effect of TNF-α on adult HSC function and understand how TNF-α-dependent mechanisms are integrated to coordinate hematopoietic regeneration during inflammation. To assess the effect of TNF-α on hematopoiesis, wild-type (WT) mice were injected with various concentrations of TNF-α (0.5–4 μg per injection) using a previously published 48-h delivery protocol with three injections, 12 h apart, followed by a 24-h wait period (Figure 1A), which at the dose of 2 μg TNF-α reduced BM cellularity and compromised HSC engraftment potential (Pronk et al., 2011Pronk C.J. Veiby O.P. Bryder D. Jacobsen S.E. Tumor necrosis factor restricts hematopoietic stem cell activity in mice: involvement of two distinct receptors.J. Exp. Med. 2011; 208: 1563-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In fact, TNF-α treatment induced a dose-dependent reduction in BM cellularity, which was already evident at 0.5 μg TNF-α (Figure 1B). Flow cytometry analyses (Figure S1A) also indicated a dose-dependent elimination of BM mature B cells and granulocytes (Gr) (Figures 1C and S1B), and their committed progenitors including common lymphoid progenitors (CLP), common myeloid progenitors (CMP), granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMPs) and megakaryocyte-erythrocyte progenitors (MEPs) (Figures 1D and S1C–S1E). In contrast, the changes in the HSC-containing LSK (Lin− c-Kit+ Sca-1+) compartment, which consists mainly of distinct populations of lineage-biased multipotent progenitors (MPPs) (Pietras et al., 2015Pietras E.M. Reynaud D. Kang Y.A. Carlin D. Calero-Nieto F.J. Leavitt A.D. Stuart J.M. Göttgens B. Passegué E. Functionally distinct subsets of lineage-biased multipotent progenitors control blood production in normal and regenerative conditions.Cell Stem Cell. 2015; 17: 35-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), were more contrasted. While lymphoid-primed MPP4 also showed a dose-dependent elimination, despite an initial increase at 0.5 μg TNF-α, myeloid-primed MPP2-3 displayed a sustained expansion and HSCs maintained rather constant numbers up to the highest dose of 4 μg TNF-α (Figures 1E, 1F, S1F, and S1G). These results highlight the potent cytotoxic effect on TNF-α on nearly all BM hematopoietic populations, except for the most immature HSCs and MPP2-3. To further investigate the differential effect of TNF-α on HSCs and their progeny, we isolated HSCs and GMPs from WT mouse BM and performed in vitro cultures with or without (±) TNF-α (Figure 1G). When expanded for 72 h (3 days) in cytokine-rich media, HSCs were not inhibited by TNF-α regardless of its concentration (1 ng to 10 μg/mL), whereas GMPs exhibited a consistent ∼50% reduction in cell number with as low as 10 ng/mL TNF-α (Figure 1H). Consistently, HSCs did not activate CASP-3/7 upon 24-h exposure with 1 μg/mL TNF-α, while GMPs strongly did (Figure 1I). Cultured MPP2-3 cells were also resistant to TNF-α cytotoxicity, while MPP4, CMPs, and MEPs were all susceptible (Figure S1H). Of note, the growth of HSC-containing LSK cells was reportedly suppressed by TNF-α when cultured with only stem cell (SCF) and granulocyte-colony stimulating (G-CSF) factors (Pronk et al., 2011Pronk C.J. Veiby O.P. Bryder D. Jacobsen S.E. Tumor necrosis factor restricts hematopoietic stem cell activity in mice: involvement of two distinct receptors.J. Exp. Med. 2011; 208: 1563-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, the expansion rate and colony-forming ability of both HSCs and GMPs was already compromised in these “cytokine-poor” conditions (Figures 1J, S1I, and S1J), suggesting a possible confounding effect of other stress-response mechanisms activated by cytokine deprivation. In fact, we directly demonstrated induction of autophagy in cytokine-poor conditions using HSCs isolated from autophagy reporter GFP-LC3 mice (Mizushima et al., 2004Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Matsui M. Yoshimori T. Ohsumi Y. In vivo analysis of autophagy in response to nutrient starvation using transgenic mice expressing a fluorescent autophagosome marker.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1101-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (1937) Google Scholar, Warr et al., 2013Warr M.R. Binnewies M. Flach J. Reynaud D. Garg T. Malhotra R. Debnath J. Passegué E. FOXO3A directs a protective autophagy program in haematopoietic stem cells.Nature. 2013; 494: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar) and showed a strong inhibition of this protective response upon TNF-α treatment (Figure 1K). Autophagy inhibition by TNF-α in these cytokine-poor culture conditions may therefore sensitize HSCs to cell death. Collectively, these results demonstrate that HSCs are highly resistant to TNF-α cytotoxicity, although their survival can be affected by other environmental stresses, whereas GMPs are eliminated by TNF-α in a dose-dependent manner by apoptosis. They also show that the resistance to TNF-α extends to myeloid-biased MPP2-3 but disappears shortly afterward, resulting in a broad hematopoietic clearance initiated at the MPP4 level in the LSK compartment. We next investigated the kinetics of TNF-α response and associated hematopoietic regeneration using the same delivery protocol (three injections, 12 h apart) and 2 μg TNF-α (Figure 2A). We confirmed significantly increased TNF-α levels in the BM fluid of 24-h-injected mice, which rapidly became undetectable at 48 h (Figure S2A). Interestingly, BM HSC numbers transiently increased at 24 h, returned to basal levels at 48 h, and remained stable thereafter. In contrast, BM GMPs and Grs were depleted as early as 3 h after the first TNF-α injection, with GMP numbers fully recovering by 96 h. For Grs, we observed a transient overshoot by 96–144 h, indicative of ongoing myeloid regeneration and GMP cluster formation (Hérault et al., 2017Hérault A. Binnewies M. Leong S. Calero-Nieto F.J. Zhang S.Y. Kang Y.A. Wang X. Pietras E.M. Chu S.H. Barry-Holson K. et al.Myeloid progenitor cluster formation drives emergency and leukaemic myelopoiesis.Nature. 2017; 544: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), before normalizing by 192 h. To address the possibility of an egress of GMPs and Grs from the BM in response to TNF-α injections, we tracked their numbers in the spleen (SP) and peripheral blood (PB) (Figure 2B). These kinetics analyses confirmed that HSCs expanded mainly in the BM at 24 h, with a small number of HSCs migrating and accumulating in the SP by 96 h. Interestingly, the rapid depletion of BM GMPs was not accompanied by a complementary increase in the periphery until the appearance of splenic GMPs by 96 h, likely as a consequence of in situ differentiation of homed HSCs (Figure 2B). Indeed, BM HSCs did not engage apoptosis at any time points, whereas BM GMPs showed massively increased CASP-3/7 activity at 3 h and 24 h (Figure 2C), thus confirming their direct elimination by apoptosis. In contrast, we observed a transient increase in PB Grs at 3 h that could be explained by the known egress of TNF-α-exposed Grs into the circulation (Sadik et al., 2011Sadik C.D. Kim N.D. Luster A.D. Neutrophils cascading their way to inflammation.Trends Immunol. 2011; 32: 452-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), although we cannot formally exclude a quick differentiation of some TNF-α-exposed GMPs producing Grs that were immediately released in the circulation. However, this increase in PB Grs disappeared by 24 h and two additional injections of TNF-α, indicating a mostly depleting effect of TNF-α on Grs. Collectively, these results demonstrate that TNF-α transiently expands HSCs while rapidly eliminating GMPs and Grs, which is followed by hematopoietic regeneration upon return to normal TNF-α levels. To understand how TNF-α triggers regeneration, we first assessed the cell cycle of HSCs isolated from TNF-α-treated mice (Figure 2D). As expected, HSCs quickly exited quiescence and started cycling by 24 h, an effect that persisted for at least 96 h but was fully restored by 192 h. Concomitantly, HSCs transiently shifted to a metabolically activated CD34+ MPP1 fate (Cabezas-Wallscheid et al., 2014Cabezas-Wallscheid N. Klimmeck D. Hansson J. Lipka D.B. Reyes A. Wang Q. Weichenhan D. Lier A. von Paleske L. Renders S. et al.Identification of regulatory networks in HSCs and their immediate progeny via integrated proteome, transcriptome, and DNA methylome analysis.Cell Stem Cell. 2014; 15: 507-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) and a CD41+ myeloid-primed state (Yamamoto et al., 2013Yamamoto R. Morita Y. Ooehara J. Hamanaka S. Onodera M. Rudolph K.L. Ema H. Nakauchi H. Clonal analysis unveils self-renewing lineage-restricted progenitors generated directly from hematopoietic stem cells.Cell. 2013; 154: 1112-1126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar), which was quickly reverted by 96 h (Figures 2E and 2F). Fluidigm qRT-PCR analyses of 3 h- and 48-h HSCs revealed a sustained inhibition of quiescence-enforcing mechanisms and activation of the cell cycle and metabolic machineries (Figure S2B; Table S1). They also confirmed the strong induction of the master myeloid regulator Spi1 (PU.1) in 3-h HSCs, which was subsequently attenuated by 48 h. Using PU.1-eYFP knockin mice, we confirmed elevated levels of PU.1 protein in TNF-α-treated HSCs, which quickly peaked by 24 h before slowly declining (Figure 2G and S2C). We also observed accelerated differentiation into myeloid cells from cultured 24 h HSCs (Figures 2H and S2D), which directly demonstrates their myeloid-priming. In vitro, the exposure of HSCs to TNF-α also accelerated cell division (Figure S2E), increased PU.1 levels (Figure S2F), and promoted myeloid differentiation (Figure S2G), although the produced myeloid cells were directly killed by apoptosis due to the constant presence of TNF-α in the culture media, leading to blunted expansion over time (Figures S2H and S2I). Together, these results demonstrate that TNF-α activates a strong regenerative program in HSCs, leading to cell cycle activation and myeloid priming likely through precocious PU.1 activation. However, such TNF-α-driven myeloid regeneration is futile when TNF-α is still present, demonstrating that a tapering of TNF-α release is critical for effective restoration of blood homeostasis. To understand the mechanisms by which TNF-α preserves HSCs while killing GMPs, we focused on the canonical NF-κB pro-survival signaling pathway (Figure S3A). We confirmed that both HSCs and GMPs express the two TNF-α receptors, with GMPs having higher levels of TNF-R1 than HSCs (Figure S3B). Using NF-κB-eGFP reporter mice, we showed the immediate activation of NF-κB in TNF-α-exposed HSCs and GMPs, with stronger NF-κB activity observed in HSCs (Figure 3A). We also found higher expression and more robust nuclear translocation of p65 (RelA) and p50 (Nfkb1) in TNF-α-treated HSCs compared to GMPs (Figures 3B). Importantly, treatment with the IκB kinase inhibitor (IKKi) BMS-345541 partially inhibited p65 nuclear translocation (Figure S3C), and rendered HSCs partly, and GMPs completely, susceptible to TNF-α cytotoxicity (Figure 3C). However, p50 deficiency in p50−/− mice had no effect on HSC survival while further promoting GMP death by apoptosis (Figure 3C). In contrast, p65 loss in Mx1-Cre:p65f/f conditional knockout (p65cKO) mice completely abrogated HSC resistance to TNF-α cytotoxicity, with both p65cKO HSCs and GMPs being killed by apoptosis (Figures 3C and 3D). Interestingly, the capacity of TNF-α to activate p65 was maintained in p50−/− HSCs (Figure S3D), which suggest that the transcriptional program responsible for HSC survival might be activated solely by p65, perhaps through p65 homodimers or other atypical heterodimers without p50. Collectively, these results indicate that HSCs entirely rely on strong p65-dependent NF-κB activity to survive TNF-α exposure. To further characterize the cell death pathways that are blocked by the strong NF-κB induction in TNF-α-treated HSCs, we next isolated HSCs from various apoptosis- (i.e., Mx1-Cre:Casp8f/f, Bid−/−, and Mx1-Cre:Bak−/−:Baxf/f) and necroptosis-deficient (i.e., Ripk1 kinase-dead (Ripk1KD), Ripk3−/−, and Mlkl−/−) mice (Figure S3A) and submitted them to 72 h in vitro expansion assay ± TNF-α and IKKi to partially block TNF-α-induced NF-κB activity. Surprisingly, while apoptosis inhibition did not rescue TNF-α cytotoxicity caused by partial NF-κB blockade, necroptosis inhibition fully restored HSC survival (Figure 3E). The importance of necroptosis in TNF-α-mediated HSC elimination was reinforced in p65cKO HSCs with complete NF-κB blockade, since only concurrent inhibition of both apoptosis via treatment with the pan-CASP inhibitor (CASPi) zVAD-fmk, and necroptosis via Ripk3 deficiency in Mx1-Cre:p65f/f:Ripk3−/− mice could restore HSC survival (Figures 3F). These results were recapitulated by treating p65cKO HSCs with both zVAD-fmk and the RIPK1 kinase inhibitor (RIPK1i) GSK’963 (Berger et al., 2015Berger S.B. Harris P. Nagilla R. Kasparcova V. Hoffman S. Swift B. Dare L. Schaeffer M. Capriotti C. Ouellette M. et al.Characterization of GSK’963: a structurally distinct, potent and selective inhibitor of RIP1 kinase.Cell Death Discov. 2015; 1: 15009Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) (Figure S3E). In contrast, the cytotoxic effects of TNF-α on GMPs could not be rescued by apoptosis or necroptosis inhibition or a combination of both (Figures S3E–S3G), suggesting the involvement of an additional form of programmed cell death when apoptosis is inhibited. Collectively, these results demonstrate that TNF-α-induced p65-NF-κB activity protects HSCs primarily from necroptosis, which is the first form of cell death unleashed upon decreased NF-κB activity (Figure S3H). To gain a broader understanding of the mechanisms dictating differential survival outcomes following TNF-α exposure, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses on both HSCs and GMPs exposed to TNF-α in culture for 3 h and 12 h or isolated from TNF-α-treated mice at 3 h (Figure 4A). We selected these conditions to extract common gene expression signatures, which are independent of the treatment conditions and reflect an early response when p65-NF-κB is differentially activated between the two population and necroptosis or apoptosis not yet engaged. Principal-component analysis (PCA) confirmed that TNF-α-treated cells are transcriptionally distinct from untreated cells, with a greater number of significantly affected genes in HSCs compared to GMPs (Figures 4B and 4C; Table S2). We also observed a larger effect upon in vivo treatment compared to in vitro exposure, likely reflecting the contribution of indirect environmental effects not observed upon direct TNF-α stimulation By using only genes that were upregulated in all three TNF-α treatment conditions, which had a false discovery rate (FDR) <0.1 and fold changes (FCs) >3, we extracted a stringent TNF-α signature of 62 genes in HSCs and 51 genes in GMPs (Figures 4C and 4D; Tables S3–S5). 18 of those genes were commonly upregulated in both cell types and represented core regulators of the NF-κB pathway (Zhang et al., 2017Zhang Q. Lenardo M.J. Baltimore D. 30 years of NF-κB: a blossoming of relevance to human pathobiology.Cell. 2017; 168: 37-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar) (Table S6). Strikingly, the remaining 33 GMP-specific genes highlighted a clear pro-death signature, with enrichment of gene ontology (GO) terms, including apoptosis and inflammation, and upregulation of genes such as Tnf (TNF-α) itself, Lta (lymphotoxin-α), and Il6 (interleukin-6 [IL-6]). In contrast, the remaining 44 HSC-specific genes defined a strong pro-survival signature, characterized by anti-inflammatory GO terms and anti-apoptotic genes, including Birc3 (cIAP2), which directly blocks the cytotoxic effect of TNF-α by ubiquitylating RIPK1 (Brenner et al., 2015Brenner D. Blaser H. Mak T.W. Regulation of tumour necrosis factor signalling: live or let die.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2015; 15: 362-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar, Wallach et al., 2016Wallach D. Kang T.B. Dillon C.P. Green D.R. Programmed necrosis in inflammation: Toward identification of the effector molecules.Science. 2016; 352: aaf2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), as well as Cd274 (PD-L1) and Pdcd1lg2 (PD-L2), which are ligands for the PD-1 receptor that induce immune tolerance (Okazaki et al., 2013Okazaki T. Chikuma S. Iwai Y. Fagarasan S. Honjo T. A rheostat for immune responses: the unique properties of PD-1 and their advantages for clinical application.Nat. Immunol. 2013; 14: 1212-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Taken together, these molecular data provide two novel TNF-α gene signatures that reflect the actual pro-survival and pro-death effect of TNF-α on HSCs and GMPs, respectively. Next, we investigated the role of the uncovered signature genes in mediating HSC survival upon TNF-α exposure. We first confirmed that Birc3 was the only cIAP family members induced in a p65-dependent manner in TNF-α-treated HSCs (Figure 4E). We then used two synthetic second mitochondria-derived activator of CASP (SMAC) mimetics, the dimeric AEG40730 and monomeric LCL-161 compounds (Fulda and Vucic, 2012Fulda S. Vucic D. Targeting IAP proteins for therapeutic intervention in cancer.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2012; 11: 109-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar), to rapidly trigger cIAP degradation in TNF-α-treated HSCs. Remarkably, despite preserved p65 nuclear translocation (Figure 4F), cIAP inhibition (cIAPi) rendered HSCs highly sensitive to TNF-α cytotoxicity (Figures 4G). We also confirmed the transcriptional upregulation, mainly via p65 activation, and the increased surface expression of PD-L1 and PD-L2 protein in TNF-α-treated HSCs (Figures 4H and 4I). Moreover, we showed in co-culture experiments that TNF-α-treated HSCs could block the increased proliferation of BM CD8+ T cells induced by TNF-α exposure, which was reverted by treatment with an anti-PD-1 blocking antibody (Figure 4J). Together, these results demonstrate the functional role of the TNF-α signature genes in protecting HSCs from necroptosis via cIAP2 induction and providing the immunomodulatory capacity to suppress T cell proliferation through upregulation of PD-L1 and PD-L2. To directly assess the effect of TNF-α on HSC regenerative function in vivo, we transplanted HSCs isolated from TNF-α-treated WT mice at various times post-TNF-α injections (Figure 5A). As expected, the engraftment potential of TNF-α-treated HSCs matched their activation state, with 3-h HSCs, which had just started entering the cell cycle, having minimally decreased engraftment compared to PBS-treated (0-h) HSCs; 48-h HSCs, which had exited quiescence, having severely compromised reconstitution ability; and 192-h HSCs, which had restored quiescence, having normal engraftment and BM reconstitution potential (Figures 5B and 5C). However, no major changes in lineage distributions was observed from TNF-α-treated HSCs at any time points (Figures S4A and S4B). Remarkably, 48-h HSCs sh"

It is unknown how the brain identifies behavioral failures and mediates this behavioral-state switch. In larval zebrafish swimming in virtual reality, visual feedback can be withheld so that swim attempts fail to trigger expected visual flow. After tens of seconds of such motor futility, animals became passive for similar durations. Whole-brain calcium imaging revealed noradrenergic neurons that responded specifically to failed swim attempts and radial astrocytes whose calcium levels accumulated with increasing numbers of failed attempts. Using cell ablation and optogenetic or chemogenetic activation, we found that noradrenergic neurons progressively activated brainstem radial astrocytes, which then suppressed swimming. Thus, radial astrocytes perform a computation critical for behavior: they accumulate evidence that current actions are ineffective and consequently drive changes in behavioral states.

https://openalex.org/W2950053601,"Social interactions involve complex decision-making tasks that are shaped by dynamic, mutual feedback between participants. An open question is whether and how emergent properties may arise across brains of socially interacting individuals to influence social decisions. By simultaneously performing microendoscopic calcium imaging in pairs of socially interacting mice, we find that animals exhibit interbrain correlations of neural activity in the prefrontal cortex that are dependent on ongoing social interaction. Activity synchrony arises from two neuronal populations that separately encode one's own behaviors and those of the social partner. Strikingly, interbrain correlations predict future social interactions as well as dominance relationships in a competitive context. Together, our study provides conclusive evidence for interbrain synchrony in rodents, uncovers how synchronization arises from activity at the single-cell level, and presents a role for interbrain neural activity coupling as a property of multi-animal systems in coordinating and sustaining social interactions between individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2952216243,"The locus coeruleus (LC) supplies norepinephrine (NE) to the entire forebrain and regulates many fundamental brain functions. Studies in humans have suggested that strong LC activation might shift network connectivity to favor salience processing. To causally test this hypothesis, we use a mouse model to study the effect of LC stimulation on large-scale functional connectivity by combining chemogenetic activation of the LC with resting-state fMRI, an approach we term ""chemo-connectomics."" We show that LC activation rapidly interrupts ongoing behavior and strongly increases brain-wide connectivity, with the most profound effects in the salience and amygdala networks. Functional connectivity changes strongly correlate with transcript levels of alpha-1 and beta-1 adrenergic receptors across the brain, and functional network connectivity correlates with NE turnover within select brain regions. We propose that these changes in large-scale network connectivity are critical for optimizing neural processing in the context of increased vigilance and threat detection."
https://openalex.org/W2950889989,"Summary How the central innate immune protein, STING, is activated by its ligands remains unknown. Here, using structural biology and biochemistry, we report that the metazoan second messenger 2′3′-cGAMP induces closing of the human STING homodimer and release of the STING C-terminal tail, which exposes a polymerization interface on the STING dimer and leads to the formation of disulfide-linked polymers via cysteine residue 148. Disease-causing hyperactive STING mutations either flank C148 and depend on disulfide formation or reside in the C-terminal tail binding site and cause constitutive C-terminal tail release and polymerization. Finally, bacterial cyclic-di-GMP induces an alternative active STING conformation, activates STING in a cooperative manner, and acts as a partial antagonist of 2′3′-cGAMP signaling. Our insights explain the tight control of STING signaling given varying background activation signals and provide a therapeutic hypothesis for autoimmune syndrome treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2952891726,"Animals rely on the relative timing of events in their environment to form and update predictive associations, but the molecular and circuit mechanisms for this temporal sensitivity remain incompletely understood. Here, we show that olfactory associations in Drosophila can be written and reversed on a trial-by-trial basis depending on the temporal relationship between an odor cue and dopaminergic reinforcement. Through the synchronous recording of neural activity and behavior, we show that reversals in learned odor attraction correlate with bidirectional neural plasticity in the mushroom body, the associative olfactory center of the fly. Two dopamine receptors, DopR1 and DopR2, contribute to this temporal sensitivity by coupling to distinct second messengers and directing either synaptic depression or potentiation. Our results reveal how dopamine-receptor signaling pathways can detect the order of events to instruct opposing forms of synaptic and behavioral plasticity, allowing animals to flexibly update their associations in a dynamic environment."
https://openalex.org/W2950219708,"Epitranscriptomic regulation controls information flow through the central dogma and provides unique opportunities for manipulating cells at the RNA level. However, both fundamental studies and potential translational applications are impeded by a lack of methods to target specific RNAs with effector proteins. Here, we present CRISPR-Cas-inspired RNA targeting system (CIRTS), a protein engineering strategy for constructing programmable RNA control elements. We show that CIRTS is a simple and generalizable approach to deliver a range of effector proteins, including nucleases, degradation machinery, translational activators, and base editors to target transcripts. We further demonstrate that CIRTS is not only smaller than naturally occurring CRISPR-Cas programmable RNA binding systems but can also be built entirely from human protein parts. CIRTS provides a platform to probe fundamental RNA regulatory processes, and the human-derived nature of CIRTS provides a potential strategy to avoid immune issues when applied to epitranscriptome-modulating therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2953102055,"Social interactions occur between multiple individuals, but what is the detailed relationship between the neural dynamics across their brains? To address this question across timescales and levels of neural activity, we used wireless electrophysiology to simultaneously record from pairs of bats engaged in a wide range of natural social interactions. We found that neural activity was remarkably correlated between their brains over timescales from seconds to hours. The correlation depended on a shared social environment and was most prominent in high frequency local field potentials (>30 Hz), followed by local spiking activity. Furthermore, the degree of neural correlation covaried with the extent of social interactions, and an increase in correlation preceded their initiation. These results show that inter-brain correlation is an inherent feature of natural social interactions, reveal the domain of neural activity where it is most prominent, and provide a foundation for studying its functional role in social behaviors."

Here, we report a single-cell transcriptomic study of human cardiac (hiCM) reprogramming that utilizes an analysis pipeline incorporating current data normalization methods, multiple trajectory prediction algorithms, and a cell fate index calculation we developed to measure reprogramming progression. These analyses revealed hiCM reprogramming-specific features and a decision point at which cells either embark on reprogramming or regress toward their original fibroblast state. In combination with functional screening, we found that immune-response-associated DNA methylation is required for hiCM induction and validated several downstream targets of reprogramming factors as necessary for productive hiCM reprograming. Collectively, this single-cell transcriptomics study provides detailed datasets that reveal molecular features underlying hiCM determination and rigorous analytical pipelines for predicting cell fate conversion."

However, despite enormous progress in molecular profiling of cellular constituents, spatially mapping them remains a disjointed and specialized machinery-intensive process, relying on either light microscopy or direct physical registration. Here, we demonstrate DNA microscopy, a distinct imaging modality for scalable, optics-free mapping of relative biomolecule positions. In DNA microscopy of transcripts, transcript molecules are tagged in situ with randomized nucleotides, labeling each molecule uniquely. A second in situ reaction then amplifies the tagged molecules, concatenates the resulting copies, and adds new randomized nucleotides to uniquely label each concatenation event. An algorithm decodes molecular proximities from these concatenated sequences and infers physical images of the original transcripts at cellular resolution with precise sequence information. Because its imaging power derives entirely from diffusive molecular dynamics, DNA microscopy constitutes a chemically encoded microscopy system."

Here, unusual physiological and computational properties of the ON and OFF smooth monostratified ganglion cells are explored. Large-scale multi-electrode recordings from 48 macaque retinas revealed that these cells exhibit irregular receptive field structure composed of spatially segregated hotspots, quite different from the classic center-surround model of retinal receptive fields. Surprisingly, visual stimulation of different hotspots in the same cell produced spikes with subtly different spatiotemporal voltage signatures, consistent with a dendritic contribution to hotspot structure. Targeted visual stimulation and computational inference demonstrated strong nonlinear subunit properties associated with each hotspot, supporting a model in which the hotspots apply nonlinearities at a larger spatial scale than bipolar cells. These findings reveal a previously unreported nonlinear mechanism in the output of the primate retina that contributes to signaling spatial information."

Puerarin, an active ingredient in the root of Pueraria lobate has been suggested to have a potent anti-obesity effect. Herein, we tested whether this effect of puerarin is associated with changes in the gut microbiota. In addition to reducing body weight, inflammation, and insulin resistance, puerarin administration significantly altered the composition of the gut microbiota. Notably, puerarin treatment greatly increased the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila, a mucin-degrading bacterium known to be beneficial for host metabolism and significantly downregulated in high-fat diet–fed mice. Further experiments revealed that puerarin increased intestinal expression levels of Muc2 and Reg3g and protected intestinal barrier function (normal permeability) by increasing the expression of ZO-1 and occludin in vivo and in vitro. These data suggest that puerarin’s enriching effect on A. muciniphila is mediated, at least in part, by a host cellular response to protect the host from diet-induced metabolic disorders and other diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2952342168,"Objective To explore psychological distress experienced by parents who express a need for psychotherapy after curative treatment for their child’s cancer. Methods 15 parents (eight mothers and seven fathers) of children treated for cancer (median time since end of curative treatment: two years) were recruited via a pediatric oncology center. Each parent was interviewed twice and data was analyzed with inductive latent qualitative content analysis. Results Two overarching themes emerged. One theme, An unfamiliar and frightening situation during treatment, portrayed experiences during the treatment period, and included the sub-themes Initial reactions to the uncontrollable situation, Adjustment to the situation, and Focus on supporting the child. Another theme, Emotional struggles after end of curative treatment, portrayed experiences following curative treatment, and included the sub-themes Transitioning back to life as it was before the diagnosis, Emotional scars, Uncontrollable fears and worries of diseases, and New perspectives on life. Conclusions Parents of children with cancer experience existential, physical, psychological, and social struggles. They describe an unstable situation after diagnosis and having focused their attention towards protecting their child during treatment. After the end of curative treatment, they experience challenges with transitioning back to life as it was before the diagnosis and dealing with their own emotional scars and fears related to the child’s cancer. The findings indicate an unmet need for psychological support among parents of children treated for cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2953692224,"Citizen science is an increasingly popular way of engaging volunteers in the collection of scientific data. Despite this, data quality remains a concern and there is little published evidence about the accuracy of records generated by citizen scientists. Here we compare data generated by two British citizen science projects, Blooms for Bees and BeeWatch, to determine the ability of volunteer recorders to identify bumblebee (Bombus) species. We assessed recorders’ identification ability in two ways–as recorder accuracy (the proportion of expert-verified records correctly identified by recorders) and recorder success (the proportion of recorder-submitted identifications confirmed correct by verifiers). Recorder identification ability was low (<50% accuracy; <60% success), despite access to project specific bumblebee identification materials. Identification ability varied significantly depending on bumblebee species, with recorders most able to correctly identify species with distinct appearances. Blooms for Bees recorders (largely recruited from the gardening community) were markedly less able to identify bumblebees than BeeWatch recorders (largely individuals with a more specific interest in bumblebees). Within both projects, recorders demonstrated an improvement in identification ability over time. Here we demonstrate and quantify the essential role of expert verification within citizen science projects, and highlight where resources could be strengthened to improve recorder ability."
https://openalex.org/W2950169387,"Isorhynchophylline (IRN), an oxindole alkaloid isolated from Uncaria rhynchophylla, elicited distinct antidepressant-like activity in mice. The present study aimed to investigate the antidepressant-like effects of IRN in chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced depressive-like behaviors in mice and to illustrate its possible mechanisms of action. The mice were subjected to CUMS for 6 wk and administered with IRN (20 or 40 mg/kg) daily by oral gavage for 3 wk. The PI3K/protein kinase B (Akt) inhibitor and glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) inhibitors were used to determine the involvement of the PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β pathway in the antidepressant-like effects of IRN in the mice. The results showed that CUMS caused depression-like behaviors in the mice, such as behavioral despair by the forced swim test (FST) and anhedonia by the sucrose preference test. In addition, CUMS could significantly reduce the levels of nerve growth factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor but markedly increase the release of TNF-α and IL-6 in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of the mice. Western blotting analysis showed that CUMS markedly suppressed the levels of phosphorylated GSK-3β (Ser9) and phosphorylated Akt (Ser473) but significantly enhanced the translocation of NF-κB p65 from cytosol to nuclei in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of the mice. CUMS could also significantly increase the NF-κB binding activity in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of the mice, whereas IRN treatment could significantly reverse the behavioral and biochemical changes induced by CUMS in the mice. Moreover, the antidepressant-like effect of IRN was completely abolished by the PI3K/Akt inhibitor. Combination treatment with IRN and GSK-3β inhibitors in the mice exerted a synergistic anti-immobility action in the FST. The results of mechanistic investigations indicated that the antidepressant-like action of IRN was mediated, at least in part, by enhancing neurotrophins and attenuating neuroinflammation via modulating the PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β pathway.-Xian, Y.-F., Ip, S.-P., Li, H.-Q., Qu, C., Su, Z.-R., Chen, J.-N., Lin, Z.-X.

https://openalex.org/W2953611370,"Biofilms are microbial communities encased in a protective matrix composed of exopolymeric substances including exopolysaccharides, proteins, lipids, and extracellular DNA. Biofilms cause undesirable effects such as biofouling, equipment damage, prostheses colonization, and disease. Biofilms are also more resilient than free-living cells to regular decontamination methods and therefore, alternative methods are needed to eradicate them. The use of non-thermal atmospheric pressure plasmas is a good alternative as plasmas contain reactive species, free radicals, and UV photons well-known for their decontamination potential against free microorganisms. Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms colonize catheters, indwelling devices, and prostheses. Plasma effects on cell viability have been previously documented for P. aeruginosa biofilms. Nonetheless, the effect of plasma on the biofilm matrix has received less attention and there is little evidence regarding the changes the matrix undergoes. The aim of this work was to study the effect plasma exerts mostly on the P. aeruginosa biofilm matrix and to expand the existing knowledge about its effect on sessile cells in order to achieve a better understanding of the mechanism/s underlying plasma-mediated biofilm inactivation. We report a reduction in the amount of the biofilm matrix, the loss of its tridimensional structure, and morphological changes in sessile cells at long exposure times. We show chemical and structural changes on the biofilm matrix (mostly on carbohydrates and eDNA) and cells (mostly on proteins and lipids) that are more profound with longer plasma exposure times. We also demonstrate the presence of lipid oxidation products confirming cell membrane lipid peroxidation as plasma exposure time increases. To our knowledge this is the first report providing detailed evidence of the variety of chemical and structural changes that occur mostly on the biofilm matrix and sessile cells as a consequence of the plasma treatment. Based on our results, we propose a comprehensive model explaining plasma-mediated biofilm inactivation."
https://openalex.org/W2955790347,"Soil C:N:P stoichiometry plays a vital role in nutrient cycling in ecosystems, but its importance to P transformation in paddy soil remains unclear. We investigated the effect of soil C:N:P stoichiometry on P mobility and uptake under long-term fertilization. Three treatments, CK (no fertilization), NPK (inorganic nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium fertilization) and NPKM (combined inorganic NPK fertilizer and manure application), were selected from two long-term experiments of paddy soil that were initiated in 1991 and 1982 in Chongqing and Suining, respectively. The results showed that in comparison the control treatment, under long-term fertilization, soil pH decreased. In comparison with the NPK and CK treatments, the NPKM treatment significantly increased soil nutrient contents, P uptake and phosphatase activities. In comparison to the CK treatment, the NPK and NPKM treatments significantly decreased soil C:N, C:P and N:P ratios. In comparison to NPK and CK treatments, the NPKM treatment decreased residual-P at both sites. Compared with CK treatment, the NPKM treatments increased labile-P and moderately labile-P by 987% and 144%, respectively, and NPK treatment increased these factors by 823% and 125%, respectively, at the Chongqing site. At the Suining site, with NPKM treatment, increases in labile-P and moderately labile-P were 706% and 73%, respectively, and with NPK treatment, the increases were 529% and 47%, respectively. In contrast, non-labile-P was significantly decreased with NPKM treatment in comparison to that with NPK and CK treatments. Moreover, increases in soil C:N and C:P ratios decreased the labile-P pools and increased non-labile-P pools. A path analysis indicated that soil C:N:P stoichiometry indirectly controlled P uptake by directly affecting P transformation from non-labile to labile-P pools. Moreover, the non-labile-P in soil with high SOM and P content directly affected P uptake, indicating that soil P transformation is mainly driven by soil C and P in paddy soil. In conclusion, understanding mechanism of P mobility influenced by soil C:N:P stoichiometry could be helpful to manage soil P fertility under long-term fertilization in paddy soils of these regions."

Gene modification targeted at eliminating boar taint in male pigs has been proposed as a possible alternative to surgical castration. The aims of this study were to explore public acceptability of this biotechnology using a mixed methods approach. Quantitative data to assess acceptability of 570 participants from southern Brazil were analysed with multinomial logistic regression models and Spearman correlations; qualitative responses of the reasons provided in support of their position were coded into themes. Just over half of the participants (56%) considered gene modification of male pigs acceptable. Acceptability was lower among participants who grew up in an agricultural environment (ρ = 0.02), but was not influenced by sex, age, religion, urban or rural living, or level of education. Acceptability of gene modification of male pigs as an alternative to surgical castration was positively related to the perception of benefits (r = -0.56, ρ<0.0001) and negatively related to the participant’s perception of risks (r = -0.35, ρ<0.0001). Acceptability was not related to knowledge of basic concepts of genetic biotechnologies (r = 0.06, ρ<0.14), or to awareness of issues related to pig castration or boar taint (r = 0.03, ρ<0.44), both of which were low among participants. Participants that considered gene modification of pigs acceptable justified their position using arguments that it improved animal welfare. In contrast, those that were not in favour were generally opposed to genetic modification. Unforeseen downstream consequences of using genetic modification in this manner was a major concern raised by over 80% of participants. Our findings suggest that perceived animal welfare may encourage public support of gene editing of food animals. However, potential risks of the technology need to be addressed and conveyed to the public, as many participants requested clarification of such risks as a condition for support."

Potential disease-attenuating effects of the ASBT inhibitor volixibat (5, 15, and 30 mg/kg) were investigated in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed Ldlr-/-.Leiden mice over 24 weeks. Plasma and fecal bile acid levels, plasma insulin, lipids, and liver enzymes were monitored. Final analyses included liver histology, intrahepatic lipids, mesenteric white adipose tissue mass, and liver gene profiling. Consistent with its mechanism of action, volixibat significantly increased the total amount of bile acid in feces. At the highest dose, volixibat significantly attenuated the HFD-induced increase in hepatocyte hypertrophy, hepatic triglyceride and cholesteryl ester levels, and mesenteric white adipose tissue deposition. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease activity score (NAS) was significantly lower in volixibat-treated mice than in the HFD controls. Gene profiling showed that volixibat reversed the inhibitory effect of the HFD on metabolic master regulators, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1β, insulin receptor, and sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 2. Volixibat may have beneficial effects on physiological and metabolic aspects of NASH pathophysiology."

This study determines the vitamin D status and its associated factors among third trimester pregnant women attending government health clinics in Selangor and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Methods Information on socio-demographic characteristics, obstetrical history, and sun exposure were obtained through face-to-face interviews. Vitamin D intake was assessed using a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration was measured and classified as deficient (< 30 nmol/L), insufficient (30–50 nmol/L), and sufficient (≥ 50 nmol/L). Results Of the 535 pregnant women recruited, 42.6% were vitamin D deficient. They consumed an average of 8.7 ± 6.7 μg of vitamin D daily. A total of 80.4% of the vitamin D were obtained from the food sources, while 19.6% were from dietary supplements. Fish and fish products showed the highest contribution to vitamin D intake (35.8%). The multivariable generalized linear mixed models, with clinic as a random effect, indicates that higher intake of vitamin D is associated with lower odds of vitamin D deficiency among pregnant women (OR = 0.96; 95% CI = 0.93–0.99). The odds of having vitamin D deficiency was reduced by 87% in non-Malays (OR = 0.14; 95% CI = 0.05–0.41) compared to Malays. No associations were found between age, educational level, monthly household income, work status, gravidity, parity, pre-pregnancy body mass index, total hours of sun exposure, total percentage of body surface area, and sun exposure index per day with vitamin D deficiency. Conclusion Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent among Malaysian pregnant women. Considering the possible adverse obstetric and fetal outcomes of vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy, future nutrition education should emphasise on vitamin D-fortified foods consumption among pregnant women by taking into consideration ethnic differences."
https://openalex.org/W2949977623,"This study investigates the role of extrinsic and intrinsic predictors in the perception of affect in mostly unfamiliar musical chords from the Bohlen-Pierce microtonal tuning system. Extrinsic predictors are derived, in part, from long-term statistical regularities in music; for example, the prevalence of a chord in a corpus of music that is relevant to a participant. Conversely, intrinsic predictors make no use of long-term statistical regularities in music; for example, psychoacoustic features inherent in the music, such as roughness. Two types of affect were measured for each chord: pleasantness/unpleasantness and happiness/sadness. We modelled the data with a number of novel and well-established intrinsic predictors, namely roughness, harmonicity, spectral entropy and average pitch height; and a single extrinsic predictor, 12-TET Dissimilarity, which was estimated by the chord's smallest distance to any 12-tone equally tempered chord. Musical sophistication was modelled as a potential moderator of the above predictors. Two experiments were conducted, each using slightly different tunings of the Bohlen-Pierce musical system: a just intonation version and an equal-tempered version. It was found that, across both tunings and across both affective responses, all the tested intrinsic features and 12-TET Dissimilarity have consistent influences in the expected direction. These results contrast with much current music perception research, which tends to assume the dominance of extrinsic over intrinsic predictors. This study highlights the importance of both intrinsic characteristics of the acoustic signal itself, as well as extrinsic factors, such as 12-TET Dissimilarity, on perception of affect in music."
https://openalex.org/W2954998565,"Rationale Patients with heart failure have an increased incidence of depression. Central and peripheral inflammation play a major role in the pathophysiology of both heart failure and depression. Aim Minocycline is an antibiotic that inhibits microglia activation and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. We assessed effects of minocycline on extent of heart failure and depression at 2 and 8 weeks post myocardial infarction. Methods/Results Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 3 groups: (i) sham + vehicle; (ii) MI + vehicle; and (iii) MI + minocycline with n/group of 8, 9 and 9 at 2 weeks, and 10, 16, 8 at weeks, respectively. Oral minocycline (50 mg/kg/day) or vehicle started 2 days before surgery. Depression-like behaviour was assessed with sucrose preference and forced swim tests, and cardiac function with echo and hemodynamics. After myocardial infarction, microglia activation and plasma/brain pro-inflammatory cytokines increased, which were mostly prevented by minocycline. At 8 weeks, cardiac dysfunction was attenuated by minocycline: infarct size (MI + Vehicle 29±1, MI + Min 23±1%), ejection fraction (Sham 80±1, MI + Vehicle 48±2, MI + Min 58±2%) and end diastolic pressure (Sham 3.2±0.3, MI + Vehicle 18.2±1.1, MI + Min 8.5±0.9 mm Hg). Depression-like behaviour was significantly improved by minocycline in sucrose preference test (% Sucrose Intake: Sham 96±1, MI + Vehicle 78±2, MI + Min 87±2) and forced swim test (% Immobile: Sham 40±4, MI + Vehicle 61±3, MI + Min 37±6). Conclusion Rats post myocardial infarction develop systemic inflammation, heart failure and depression-like behaviour that are all attenuated by minocycline. Targeting (neuro) inflammation may represent new therapeutic strategy for patients with heart failure and depression."

The conceptual frameworks of the constructs were scientifically well grounded. A set of semi-structured interviews and anonymous web-based surveys was performed. The final questionnaire was applied to 220 non-medically educated people and 121 medically educated people.A 17-item questionnaire on knowledge about dietary supplements and eight-item questionnaire on trust in advertising dietary supplements were developed. The measures presented satisfactory proof of validity, however, the psychometric properties of the questionnaire on knowledge were modest. Both the knowledge about dietary supplements in the study group and trust in advertising them were low. A significant negative relationship was found between knowledge about dietary supplements and trust in advertising them among the general public (Pearson's r = -0.42, 95%CI: -0.52 to -0.30, p<0.0001). This association was especially pronounced in people who reported not taking dietary supplements (Pearson's r = -0.61, 95%CI: -0.76 to -0.39, p<0.0001).The extensive advertising of dietary supplements appears to be in conflict with promoting evidence-based knowledge about them, which raises substantial concerns for the public health.

https://openalex.org/W2952902762,"The increased prevalence of obesity and associated insulin resistance calls for effective therapeutic treatment of metabolic diseases. The current PPARγ-targeting antidiabetic drugs have undesirable side effects. The present study investigated the anti-diabetic and anti-obesity effects of withaferin A (WFA) in diet-induced obese (DIO) C57BL/6J mice and also the anti-adipogenic effect of WFA in differentiating 3T3- F442A cells. DIO mice were treated with WFA (6 mg/kg) or rosiglitazone (10 mg/kg) for 8 weeks. At the end of the treatment period, metabolic profile, liver function and inflammatory parameters were obtained. Expression of selective genes controlling insulin signaling, inflammation, adipogenesis, energy expenditure and PPARγ phosphorylation-regulated genes in epididymal fats were analyzed. Furthermore, the anti-adipogenic effect of WFA was evaluated in 3T3- F442A cell line. WFA treatment prevented weight gain without affecting food or caloric intake in DIO mice. WFA-treated group also exhibited lower epididymal and mesenteric fat pad mass, an improvement in lipid profile and hepatic steatosis and a reduction in serum inflammatory cytokines. Insulin resistance was reduced as shown by an improvement in glucose and insulin tolerance and serum adiponectin. WFA treatment upregulated selective insulin signaling (insr, irs1, slc2a4 and pi3k) and PPARγ phosphorylation-regulated (car3, selenbp1, aplp2, txnip, and adipoq) genes, downregulated inflammatory (tnf-α and il-6) genes and altered energy expenditure controlling (tph2 and adrb3) genes. In 3T3- F442A cell line, withaferin A inhibited adipogenesis as indicated by a decrease in lipid accumulation in differentiating adipocytes and protein expression of PPARγ and C/EBPα. The effect of rosiglitazone on physiological and lipid profiles, insulin resistance, some genes expression and differentiating adipocytes were markedly different. Our data suggest that WFA is a promising therapeutic agent for both diabetes and obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2952962345,"Male sterility (induced or natural) is a potential tool for commercial hybrid seed production in different crops. Despite numerous endeavors to understand the physiological, hereditary, and molecular cascade of events governing CMS in cotton, the exact biological process controlling sterility and fertility reconstruction remains obscure. During current study, RNA-Seq using Ion Torrent S5 platform is carried out to identify ‘molecular portraits’ in floral buds among the Cytoplasmic Genic Male Sterility (CGMS) line, its near-isogenic maintainer, and restorer lines. A total of 300, 438 and 455 genes were differentially expressed in CGMS, Maintainer, and Restorer lines respectively. The functional analysis using AgriGo revealed suppression in the pathways involved in biogenesis and metabolism of secondary metabolites which play an important role in pollen and anther maturation. Enrichment analysis showed dearth related to pollen and anther’s development in sterile line, including anomalous expression of genes and transcription factors that have a role in the development of the reproductive organ, abnormal cytoskeleton formation, defects in cell wall formation. The current study found aberrant expression of DYT1, AMS and cytochrome P450 genes involved in tapetum formation, pollen development, pollen exine and anther cuticle formation associated to male sterility as well as fertility restoration of CGMS. In the current study, more numbers of DEGs were found on Chromosome D05 and A05 as compared to other chromosomes. Expression pattern analysis of fourteen randomly selected genes using qRT-PCR showed high concurrence with gene expression profile of RNA-Seq analysis accompanied by a strong correlation of 0.82. The present study provides an important support for future studies in identifying interaction between cyto-nuclear molecular portraits, to accelerate functional genomics and molecular breeding related to cytoplasmic male sterility studies in cotton."

Whether AKI followed by a return to baseline creatinine is associated with incident infection is unknown.We hypothesized that risk of both short and long term infection would be higher among patients with AKI and return to baseline creatinine than in propensity score matched peers without AKI in the year following a non-infectious hospital admission.Retrospective, propensity score matched cohort study.We identified 494 patients who were hospitalized between January 1, 1999 and December 31, 2009 and had AKI followed by return to baseline creatinine. These were propensity score matched to controls without AKI.The predictor variable was AKI defined by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes and by the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes definition, with return to baseline creatinine defined as a decrease in serum creatinine level to within 10% of the baseline value within 7 days of hospital discharge. The outcome variable was incident infection defined by ICD-9 code within 1 year of hospital discharge.AKI followed by return to baseline creatinine was associated with a 4.5-fold increased odds ratio for infection (odds ratio 4.53 [95% CI, 2.43-8.45]; p<0.0001) within 30 days following discharge. The association between AKI and subsequent infection remained significant at 31-60 days and 91 to 365 days but not during 61-90 days following discharge.Among patients from an integrated health care delivery system, non-infectious AKI followed by return to baseline creatinine was associated with an increased odds ratio for infection in the year following discharge."
https://openalex.org/W2955864355,"Purpose Orbital decompression surgery is performed in patients with Graves’ orbitopathy to treat dysthyroid optical neuropathy (DON) and reduce disfiguring proptosis. The intended proptosis reduction can deviate from the postoperative result and changes of motility with consecutive diplopia can occur. We performed a retrospective study to identify anatomical factors in computed tomography (CT), which influence the surgical effect and postoperative ocular motility and diplopia. Methods Pre- and postoperative CT-scans of 125 eyes of 68 patients, who mainly underwent a balanced orbital decompression for disfiguring proptosis (≥18mm Hertel Index), have been analyzed. Proptosis, ductions, misalignment and diplopia were assessed before and after surgery. Medial and lateral orbital wall length, conus angle, depth of ethmoidal sinus, orbital surface, length of medial and orbital defect, depth of tissue prolapse and horizontal muscle diameters were analyzed in CT scans before and after surgery. With linear regression and multivariate analyses these parameters have been correlated with postoperative proptosis, abduction deficit, deviation and binocular single vision (BSV). Results Proptosis could be reduced by 5.3±2mm. Patients with <5mm proptosis reduction had significantly less often new onset of diplopia compared to patients with >5mm reduction (13% vs. 56%, p = 0.02). Multiple linear regression showed a significant correlation between tissue prolapse and depth of the ethmoidal sinus as well as age (p<0.001, r = 0.71). Proptosis reduction could not be predicted by tissue prolapse, defect length or depth of ethmoidal sinus. The abduction deficit correlated significantly with tissue prolapse and orbital surface area (p<0.001, r = 0.37) but not with the horizontal muscle diameter. Conclusion We were able to show that orbital morphology influences the outcome of balanced orbital decompression surgery in terms of proptosis reduction and motility. However, the rather low coefficients of correlation show that the surgical outcome cannot be predicted with simple CT measurements, although risk factors for postoperative abduction deficit could be found. Therefore, preoperative planning should consider especially the orbital surface area and depth of ethmoidal sinus. Patients should be informed about the higher risk of diplopia with higher proptosis reduction."
https://openalex.org/W2949218221,"In many woody dicot plant species, colder temperatures correlate with a greater degree of leaf dissection and with larger and more abundant leaf teeth (the serrated edges along margins). The measurement of site-mean characteristics of leaf size and shape (physiognomy), including leaf dissection and tooth morphology, has been an important paleoclimate tool for over a century. These physiognomic-based climate proxies require that all woody dicot plants at a site, regardless of species, change their leaf shape rapidly and predictably in response to temperature. Here we experimentally test these assumptions by growing five woody species in growth cabinets under two temperatures (17 and 25°C). In keeping with global site-based patterns, plants tend to develop more dissected leaves with more abundant and larger leaf teeth in the cool treatment. Overall, this upholds the assumption that leaf shape responds in a particular direction to temperature change. The assumption that leaf shape variables respond to temperature in the same way regardless of species did not hold because the responses varied by species. Leaf physiognomic models for inferring paleoclimate should take into account these species-specific responses."
https://openalex.org/W2954944777,"The black caiman is one of the largest neotropical top predators, which means that it could play a structuring role within swamp ecosystems. However, because of the difficulties inherent to studying black caimans, data are sorely lacking on many aspects of their general biology, natural history, and ecology, especially in French Guiana. We conducted a detailed study of the Agami Pond black caiman population using a multidisciplinary approach. The aim was to better understand the species’ dietary ecology and movements in the pond, and thus its functional role in pond system. We gathered natural history data, tracked caiman movements using satellite transmitters, and characterized feeding ecology via stable isotope analysis. Our study was carried out over three sampling periods and spanned both wet and dry seasons, which differ in their hydrological and ecological conditions. Our results show that black caiman abundance and age demographics differed between seasons in Agami Pond. In the dry season, Agami Pond is one of the only areas within the marsh to hold water. It thus contains large quantities of different fish species, which form the basis of the black caiman’s diet. Caiman body size, a proxy for age class, was around 1.5 meters. During the wet season, which corresponds to the breeding period for migratory birds (e.g., Agami herons), adult black caimans are present in Agami Pond. Adults were most abundant in the inundated forest. There, most individuals measured up to 2 meters. They also exhibited a particular “predatory” behavior near bird nests, preying on fallen chicks and adults. Juveniles and subadults were present during both seasons in the pond’s open waters. These behavioral observations were backed up by stable isotope analysis, which revealed ontogenetic variation in the caiman’s isotopic values. This isotopic variation reflected variation in diet that likely reduced intraspecific competition between adults and young. The telemetry and microchip data show that different age classes had different movement patterns and that seasonal variation in the pond may influence caiman prey availability and reproductive behavior. The new information gathered should help predict this species’ responses to potential ecosystem disturbance (e.g., water pollution, habitat destruction) and inform the development of an effective conservation plan that involves locals and wildlife officials."
https://openalex.org/W2949464077,"Introduction ARV-based pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has the potential to avert many new HIV infections, yet little is known about how to reach women at high risk for HIV infection and motivate them to initiate PrEP. Clinical trials have succeeded in recruiting at-risk participants, evidenced by control arm HIV incidence ≥3% (defined by the World Health Organization as “substantial risk”). We examined experiences from HIV prevention trials to document recruitment strategies and identify practical, potentially effective strategies for reaching women in real-world PrEP delivery. Methods We conducted semi-structured qualitative phone interviews with 31 staff from five countries who had worked on one or more of seven ARV-based HIV prevention clinical trials. Questions explored recruitment strategies used to reach women at risk of HIV and to successfully communicate about PrEP (inclusive of oral and vaginal formulations). We structurally coded data in NVivo and analyzed codes to derive themes. We conducted results interpretation webinars with research and programmatic stakeholders to validate findings and develop recommendations. Results Clinical trial researchers employed a range of recruitment strategies to recruit at-risk women. They recommended engaging the local community and potential PrEP users via community events, meetings with gatekeepers, and use of community advisory boards; and they encouraged interpersonal communication like presentations in waiting rooms and door-to-door recruitment to address personal concerns and prevent misinformation. Participants also stressed the importance of addressing the challenges that already exist within the health system to create a more enabling environment and delivering positive messages through a variety of communication channels to normalize PrEP. Conclusions Findings from this study provide important insights into potentially effective ways for countries currently rolling out oral PrEP to reach at-risk women with information about PrEP and promote uptake."
https://openalex.org/W2954311083,"In the city of Magelang, Indonesia, the distribution of Dengue Haemorhagic Fever (DHF) cases tend to be clustered, ever changing along with human urbanization from 2014 to 2017. Although DHF cases have been less reported in the city of Magelang for the past 5 years, vector control measures by using insecticide space spraying, particularly permethrin, have been continuously performed. Current study aimed to detect kdr mutations associated with pyrethroid resistance in Ae. aegypti and to study possible association between insecticide resistance and DHF case distribution related to human urbanization. The study was a cross sectional study conducted in 3 sub-districts in the city of Magelang, Central Java, Indonesia. Eggs of Ae. aegypti collected from 195 sample households were reared and were tested for resistance to pyrethroids by using PCR. Primers AaSCF1 and AaSCR4, and primers AaSCF7 and AaSCR7 were used in detecting presence of mutation in VGSC IIS6 and IIIS6 gene, respectively. Fragments of amplified DNA were sequenced and were analyzed. Spatio-temporal using Standard Deviational Ellipse (SDE) was performed to obtain mapping of DHF case distribution trends. The total number of DHF case was 380 cases, with the most cases (158) occurred in 2015 and the least cases (66) reported in 2017. DHF case distribution was grouped into several clusters. SDE calculation demonstrated movement of DHF case in the direction to principal arterial road, suggesting link to urbanization. Gene sequencing demonstrated VGSC IIS6 gene mutation (S989P and V1016G) in Ae. aegypti collected from study areas, indicating resistance to permethrin. VGSC IIIS6 gene mutation was not found. Current study concluded that multiple kdr mutations associated with resistance to pyrethroid was detected in Ae. aegypti, and that human urbanization may have a role in the development of such resistance."
https://openalex.org/W4230908338,"Introduction Queues are inherent to service encounters, as it is not always possible to provide service to all clients at the exact moment they request service. Queues involve waiting for a service in a specific place that might also be crowded, they obstruct the client's’ goal of receiving service, and at times lead clients to mistreat service providers and in extreme cases even attack them violently. We show, in a hospital setting, that perceived predicted future wait and load can buffer the causes of violence towards service staff. Methods We combine objective data on crowdedness, reports of violence, and durations of time people waited, with psychological measures of perceived load and perceived future wait, collected from 226 people in the Emergency Department (ED) of a large hospital. Visitors to the ED were recruited as they waited for service. They indicated their perceived load in the ED and their perceived remaining wait for service. This data was then triangulated with objective operational data regarding the actual number of people waiting for service (i.e., crowdedness) and objective data regarding staff calls to security to stop violent accounts. Results We find that with increased crowdedness, there are more calls to security reporting violence. However, this relationship is moderated by two factors: when people perceive the future wait to be short and when they perceive the load on the system to be high. Moreover, a three-way interaction shows that crowdedness is associated with more incidents of violence, however high perceived load and low perceived future wait are associated with fewer violent incidents. Conclusions This paper demonstrates the relationship between crowded queues and violence towards service staff, and suggests two psychological mechanisms for buffering such violence: reducing perceived future wait and elevating perceived load."
https://openalex.org/W2949199710,"In economic decisions, we make a good-based choice first, then we transform the outcome into an action to obtain the good. To elucidate the network mechanisms for such transformation, we constructed a neural circuit model consisting of modules representing choice, integration of choice with target locations, and the final action plan. We examined three scenarios regarding how the final action plan could emerge in the neural circuit and compared their implications with experimental data. Our model with heterogeneous connectivity predicts the coexistence of three types of neurons with distinct functions, confirmed by analyzing the neural activity in the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) of behaving monkeys. We obtained a much more distinct classification of functional neuron types in the ventral than the dorsal region of LPFC, suggesting that the action plan is initially generated in ventral LPFC. Our model offers a biologically plausible neural circuit architecture that implements good-to-action transformation during economic choice."
https://openalex.org/W2949710711,"Marine fish contribute to the carbon cycle by producing mineralized intestinal precipitates generated as by-products of their osmoregulation. Here we aimed at characterizing the control of epithelial bicarbonate secretion and intestinal precipitate presence in the gilthead sea bream in response to predicted near future increases of environmental CO2. Our results demonstrate that hypercapnia (950 and 1800 μatm CO2) elicits higher intestine epithelial HCO3- secretion ex vivo and a subsequent parallel increase of intestinal precipitate presence in vivo when compared to present values (440 μatm CO2). Intestinal gene expression analysis in response to environmental hypercapnia revealed the up-regulation of transporters involved in the intestinal bicarbonate secretion cascade such as the basolateral sodium bicarbonate co-transporter slc4a4, and the apical anion transporters slc26a3 and slc26a6 of sea bream. In addition, other genes involved in intestinal ion uptake linked to water absorption such as the apical nkcc2 and aquaporin 1b expression, indicating that hypercapnia influences different levels of intestinal physiology. Taken together the current results are consistent with an intestinal physiological response leading to higher bicarbonate secretion in the intestine of the sea bream paralleled by increased luminal carbonate precipitate abundance and the main related transporters in response to ocean acidification."
https://openalex.org/W2950718362,"Ptaquiloside is a natural toxin present in bracken ferns (Pteridium sp.). Cattle ingesting bracken may develop bladder tumours and excrete genotoxins in meat and milk. However, the fate of ptaquiloside in cattle and the link between ptaquiloside and cattle carcinogenesis is unresolved. Here, we present the toxicokinetic profile of ptaquiloside in plasma and urine after intravenous administration of ptaquiloside and after oral administration of bracken. Administered intravenously ptaquiloside, revealed a volume of distribution of 1.3 L kg-1 with a mean residence-time of 4 hours. A large fraction of ptaquiloside was converted to non-toxic pterosin B in the blood stream. Both ptaquiloside and pterosin B were excreted in urine (up to 41% of the dose). Oral administration of ptaquiloside via bracken extract or dried ferns did not result in observations of ptaquiloside in body fluids, indicating deglycosolidation in the rumen. Pterosin B was detected in both plasma and urine after oral administration. Hence, transport of carcinogenic ptaquiloside metabolites over the rumen membrane is indicated. Pterosin B recovered from urine counted for 7% of the dose given intravenously. Heifers exposed to bracken for 7 days (2 mg ptaquiloside kg-1) developed preneoplastic lesions in the urinary bladder most likely caused by genotoxic ptaquiloside metabolites."
https://openalex.org/W2954706812,"In this study, we investigated the role and mechanism of Salt-induced kinase 1 (SIK1) in regulation of hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism in a high-fat food (HFD) and streptozocin (STZ)-induced type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) rat model.A diabetic rat model treated with HFD plus low-dose STZ was developed and was transduced to induce a high expression of SIK1 in vivo via a tail-vein injection of a recombinant adenoviral vector. The effects on hepatic glucogenetic and lipogenic gene expression, systemic metabolism and pathological changes were then determined.In T2DM rats, SIK1 expression was reduced in the liver. Overexpression of SIK1 improved hyperglycaemia, hyperlipidaemia and fatty liver, reduced the expression of cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB)-regulated transcription co-activator 2 (CRTC2), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), pS577 SIK1, sterol regulatory element binding-protein-1c (SREBP-1c) and its target genes, including acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and fatty acid synthase (FAS), and increased the expression of SIK1, pT182 SIK1 and pS171 CRTC2 in diabetic rat livers with the suppression of gluconeogenesis and lipid deposition.SIK1 plays a crucial role in the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism in the livers of HFD/STZ-induced T2DM rats, where it suppresses hepatic gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis by regulating the SIK1/CRTC2 and SIK1/SREBP-1c signalling pathways. Strategies to activate SIK1 kinase in liver would likely have beneficial effects in patients with T2DM and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)."

Whereas relational variants of the Implicit Association Test (IAT) have been proposed in the past, we put forward the Truth Misattribution Procedure (TMP) as a relational variant of the Affect Misattribution Procedure (AMP) that aims to capture implicit beliefs. Across three experiments, we demonstrate that TMP effects are sensitive to the relational information contained within sentence primes, both in the context of causal stimulus relations of a known truth value (e.g., “smoking causes cancer” vs. “smoking prevents cancer”), as well as in the domain of gender stereotypes (e.g., “men are arrogant” vs. “men should be arrogant”).

https://openalex.org/W2954231276,"Physical activity (PA) is a key component of a healthy life, and it is hypothesised that individuals with higher levels of PA utilise fewer hospital resources. Quantifying the association between PA and hospital resource use is of interest to both payers and planners but estimates of its size in the general population are rare. In this paper we provide estimates of the association between PA and payments to hospitals in the Australian population over age 45. We use data from 45 and Up Study, a survey that contains health and lifestyle factors information about approximately 260,000 individuals over age 45 living in NSW, linked to hospital and death data. The linked data set allows to define a unique indicator for the level of PA over the week prior to the survey interview and to calculate payments to hospitals over the next year. We use Coarsened Exact Matching and multivariate analysis to study the relationship between PA and hospital payments, controlling for chronic health conditions, risk factors, standard socioeconomic variables and death. Our results clearly indicate that there is a statistically significant association between PA and lower hospital payments. While the size of the association depends to some extent on the covariates used in the model the conclusions are robust to changes in model specification. We also perform a sub-group analysis and show that the cost savings associated with PA are significantly larger for older and lower income populations. This study shows that if one is interested in lowering hospital expenditures then increasing PA levels is a policy that has the potential of being effective. It also shows that one does not need to target the entire population to achieve cost savings but can limit the intervention to the older population and/or the one in the lowest socioeconomic status."
https://openalex.org/W2953336476,"Although most research on sleep and adolescent health has focused on how long each youth sleeps on average, variability in sleep duration may be just as problematic. Existing findings have been inconsistent and unable to address cause-effect relationships. This study piloted an experimental protocol to induce sleep variability and explore its impact on daytime sleepiness in adolescents. Healthy adolescents aged 14–17 participated in a 3-week, at-home protocol. Sleep was monitored by sleep diaries and actigraphy. Following a run-in period to stabilize wake times (set at 6:30am throughout the protocol), participants were randomly counterbalanced across two 5-night experimental conditions. Bedtimes were consistent at 11:00pm during the stable sleep condition (7.5-hour sleep period each night) but changed on alternating nights during the variable sleep condition (ranging from 9:30pm to 12:30am) so that sleep duration averaged 7.5 hours across the condition with a standard deviation of 1.37 hours. Difficulty waking was assessed each morning and daytime sleepiness was assessed by end-of-condition parent- and adolescent-reports. Of the 20 participants who completed the study, 16 met the predetermined adherence definition. For those who were adherent, there were no differences in overall sleep duration between the stable and variable sleep conditions (p>.05) but adolescents had 58.6 minutes greater night-to-night variation in sleep duration in the variable condition (p < .001). Across all nights, youth reported greater difficulty waking following nights of shorter assigned sleep (p = .004) and greater overall sleepiness during the variable condition (p = .03). It is feasible to experimentally vary how long adolescents sleep on a nightly basis while holding average sleep duration constant. Such a protocol will promote tests of the acute effects of day-to-day changes in sleep duration on health."
https://openalex.org/W2954397542,"Infectious disease and sepsis represent a serious problem for all, but especially in early life. Much of the increase in morbidity and mortality due to infection in early life is presumed to relate to fundamental differences between neonatal and adult immunity. Mechanistic insight into the way newborns’ immune systems handle infectious threats is lacking; as a result, there has only been limited success in providing effective immunomodulatory interventions to reduce infectious mortality. Given the complexity of the host-pathogen interactions, neonatal mouse models can offer potential avenues providing valuable data. However, the small size of neonatal mice hampers the ability to collect biological samples without sacrificing the animals. Further, the lack of a standardized metric to quantify newborn mouse health increases reliance on correlative biomarkers without a known relationship to ‘clinical’ outcome. To address this bottleneck, we developed a system that allows assessment of neonatal mouse health in a readily standardized and quantifiable manner. The resulting health scores require no special equipment or sample collection and can be assigned in less than 20 seconds. Importantly, the health scores are highly predictive of survival. A classifier built on our health score revealed a positive relationship between reduced bacterial load and survival, demonstrating how this scoring system can be used to bridge the gap between assumed relevance of biomarkers and the clinical outcome of interest. Adoption of this scoring system will not only provide a robust metric to assess health of newborn mice but will also allow for objective, prospective studies of infectious disease and possible interventions in early life."

https://openalex.org/W2953426383,"Analysis of a large number of markers is crucial in both genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and genome-wide selection (GWS). However there are two methodological issues that restrict statistical analysis: high dimensionality (p≫n) and multicollinearity. Although there are methodologies that can be used to fit models for data with high dimensionality (eg, the Bayesian Lasso), a big problem that can occurs in this cases is that the predictive ability of the model should perform well for the individuals used to fit the model, but should not perform well for other individuals, restricting the applicability of the model. This problem can be circumvent by applying some selection methodology to reduce the number of markers (but keeping the markers associated with the phenotypic trait) before adjusting a model to predict GBVs. We revisit a tournament-based strategy between marker samples, where each sample has good statistical properties for estimation: n>p and low collinearity. Such tournaments are elaborated using multiple linear regression to eliminate markers. This method is adapted from previous works found in the literature. We used simulated data as well as real data derived from a study with SNPs in beef cattle. Tournament strategies not only circumvent the p≫n issue, but also minimize spurious associations. For real data, when we selected a few more than 20 markers, we obtained correlations greater than 0.70 between predicted Genomic Breeding Values (GBVs) and phenotypes in validation groups of a cross-validation scheme; and when we selected a larger number of markers (more than 100), the correlations exceeded 0.90, showing the efficiency in identifying relevant SNPs (or segregations) for both GWAS and GWS. In the simulation study, we obtained similar results."

This study aimed to evaluate the association between brain metastasis and BMI and bone mineral density (BMD) in NSCLC. Methods We retrospectively enrolled patients with non–small cell lung cancer who underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging with contrast within 3 months of diagnosis. The BMI was collected, and the BMD was measured in Hounsfield unit (HU) on initial staging computed tomography scans. The independent relationship between BMI and BMD was assessed using multivariable linear regression according to the presence of brain metastasis. Results A total of 356 consecutive NSCLC patients were enrolled in the study over a 8-year period in a single institution. Lower BMI with higher BMD was an independent predictive factor for brain metastasis in patients with NSCLC, relative to the other group (HR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.21 to 3.40; P = 0.007). We also found a significant negative correlation between BMI and BMD among patients with NSCLC with brain metastases (B, -3.343; 95% confidence interval, -6.352 to -0.333; P = 0.030). Conclusions Brain metastasis may possibly be associated with lower BMI and higher BMD in NSCLC patients. We expect that these results may facilitate future predictions of brain metastases during the clinical course of NSCLC and enhance our understanding of the underlying mechanisms that link brain metastases and lung cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2953310500,"Biased transmission of health knowledge has far-reaching effects on information reproduction and health-related cognitions. We examined whether transmissions of different types of disorder and etiological information influence recollections of health knowledge and evaluations of patients, by simulating the digital transmission of information. Transmission chains of four non-interacting persons (i.e., four generations) were formed. The first generation read three vignettes describing fictitious patients with one of three disorders (physiological, psychological, culture-bound) uniquely paired with one of three etiologies (genetic, environmental, unknown etiology). Next, they evaluated patients’ well-being, rated desired social distance, and recalled the vignettes. These written recollections replaced the original vignettes for a second-generation of participants, whose recollections were used for the third generation and so on. The framing of disorders affected recollections of etiology, in which culture-bound framings resulted in the poorest recall of etiologies. Participants also perceived the culture-bound disorder as the least serious but desired the most social distance from patients diagnosed with it, when compared to other disorders. The study showed that health information is selectively attended to and reproduced, possibly affected by perceived self-relevance. Faulty recollections and framing of disorders affect health cognitions, potentially instigating biased transmission of disorder- and patient-related narratives."

We used unadjusted and adjusted logistic and Cox regressions to determine the association between the geographic origin of the participants and the following outcomes: antiviral treatment status; sustained virologic response; cirrhosis at enrolment; incident cirrhosis; loss to follow-up (LTFU); and mortality. The analyses were adjusted for sex, baseline age, education, source of income, alcohol consumption, injection drug use (IDU), HCV genotype, HIV or HBV coinfection, duration of HCV infection, time since enrolment, cirrhosis, (type of) HCV treatment, and centre at enrolment. Among 5,356 persons, 1,752 (32.7%) were foreign-born. IDU was more common among Swiss- (64.1%) than foreign-born (36.6%) persons. Cirrhosis at enrolment was more frequent among foreign- than Swiss-born persons, reflecting the high frequency of cirrhosis among Italian-born persons who acquired HCV between 1950 and 1970 in Italian healthcare settings. Although antiviral treatment coverage was similar, the sustained viral response rate was increased and the mortality was lower among foreign-vs. Swiss-born persons, with the lowest mortality in persons from Asia/Oceania. LTFU was more frequent in persons from Germany, Eastern and Southern Europe, and the Americas. In conclusion, in Switzerland, a country with universal healthcare, geographic origin had no influence on hepatitis C treatment access, and the better treatment outcomes among foreign-born persons were likely explained by their lower prevalence of IDU and alcohol consumption than among Swiss-born persons."

Bioharness-3 (Zephyr, MD) WS recorded occurrences of PII during games and impacts were generated using Impact Processor (Zephyr, MD). Eight players with the top activity levels each game determined by WS, were observed using video and synchronized with game video collected by NTDP staff. Impacts identified by WS of 6-7.9 g (Z3), 8-9.9 g (Z4) and 10+ g (Z5) were used to corroborate PII. Magnitude and duration of each identified impact were compared by category using MANOVA with Tukey post hoc (α = 0.05; SPSS 22.0, IBM, NY).Of 419 on-ice impacts, 358 were confirmed true PII (85.5%), 60 as other non-PII (14.3%) and 1 false positive (0.2%). For 358 PII, 17 (4.1%) were 1) Board contact/no check, 74 (17.7%), 2) Board contact/check, 202 (48.2%), 3) Open ice check, 65 (15.5%), 4) Player fall. Of 60 Non-PII, 19 (4.5%) as 5) other form of player to player event, 16 (3.8%) as 6) Hard Stop, 19 (4.5%) as 7) Slapshots and 6 (1.4%) as 8) other identifiable player events. 160 of the 200 Z3 events were PII (80%), 103 of 110 Z4 events (93.6%) and 95 of 109 Z5 events were PII (87.2%). The magnitude of impacts was not different by category, but the duration of category 6 (Hard stop; .058 s) was lower than categories 2, 4 and 7 (.112, .112, .133 s, respectively, p < .05).These data show that using some limited criteria (e.g. impact magnitude and duration), PII can be identified with relatively high accuracy in ice hockey using trunk-worn wearable sensors."
