https://openalex.org/W2006640177,"Numerical simulations of a simple reaction--diffusion model reveal a surprising variety of irregular spatio--temporal patterns. These patterns arise in response to finite--amplitude perturbations. Some of them resemble the steady irregular patterns discussed by Lee et al. Others consist of spots which grow until they reach a critical size at which time they divide in two. If, in some region, the spots become overcrowded, all the spots in that region decay into the uniform background."
https://openalex.org/W1989741811,"The solvent dependence of the second hyperpolarizability, gamma, of a variety of unsaturated organic compounds has been measured by third harmonic generation at 1907 nanometers. It is seen that the measured gamma is a function of solvent polarity. These solvent-dependent hyperpolarizabilities are associated with changes in molecular geometry from a highly bond-length alternated, polyene-like structure for a formyl-substituted compound in non-polar solvents, to a cyanine-like structure, with little bond-length alternation, for a dicyanovinyl-substituted compound in polar solvents. By tuning bond-length alternation, gamma can be optimized in either a positive or negative sense for polymethine dyes of a given conjugation length."
https://openalex.org/W2007252739,"Chemical reactions far from equilibrium on solid surfaces may exhibit typical phenomena of nonlinear dynamics, as exemplified by the catalytic oxidation of carbon monoxide on a platinum(110) single-crystal surface. Depending on the external parameters (temperature and partial pressures of the reactants), the temporal variation of the reaction rate may become oscillatory or even chaotic. In a parallel way, the concentration distributions of the adsorbed species on the surface form spatio-temporal patterns including propagating and standing waves, rotating spirals, as well as irregular and rapidly changing structures denoted ""chemical turbulence."""
https://openalex.org/W2011633980,"Early reports on the formation of the higher fullerenes C(76), C(78), C(84), C(90), and C(94) by resistive heating of graphite stimulated theoretical calculations of possible cage structures for these all-carbon molecules. Among the five fullerene structures with isolated pentagons found for C(78), a closed-shell D3h-isomer was predicted to form preferentially. Two distinct C(78)-isomers were formed in a ratio of approximately 5:1 and could be separated by high-performance liquid chromatography. The carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum of the major isomer is uniquely consistent with a C2v-structure. The NMR data also support a chiral D(3)-structure for the minor isomer. The isolation of specifically these two isomers of C(78) provides insight into the stability of higher fullerene structures and into the mechanism for fullerene formation in general."
https://openalex.org/W1997273053,"Experiments on a bistable chemical reaction in a continuously fed thin gel layer reveal a new type of spatiotemporal pattern, one in which fronts propagate at a constant speed until they reach a critical separation (typically 0.4 millimeter) and stop. The resulting asymptotic state is a highly irregular stationary pattern that contrasts with the regular patterns such as hexagons, squares, and stripes that have been observed in many nonequilibrium systems. The observed patterns are initiated by a finite amplitude perturbation rather than through spontaneous symmetry breaking."
https://openalex.org/W2091376824,"One of the most dramatic climate change events observed in marine and ice core records is the Younger Dryas, a return to near-glacial conditions that punctuated the last deglaciation. High-resolution, continuous glaciochemical records, newly retrieved from central Greenland, record the chemical composition of the arctic atmosphere at this time. This record shows that both the onset and the termination of the Younger Dryas occurred within 10 to 20 years and that massive, frequent, and short-term (decadal or less) changes in atmospheric composition occurred throughout this event. Changes in atmospheric composition are attributable to changes in the size of the polar atmospheric cell and resultant changes in source regions and to the growth and decay of continental biogenic source regions."
https://openalex.org/W1991931592,"Helium-3 in hotspot magmas has been used as unambiguous evidence for the existence of a primordial, undegassed reservoir deep in the Earth's mantle. However, a large amount of helium-3 is delivered to the Earth's surface by interplanetary dust particles (IDPs). Recycling of deep-sea sediments containing these particles to the mantle, and eventual incorporation in magma, can explain the high helium-3/helium-4 ratios of hotspot magmas. Basalts with high helium-3/helium-4 ratios may represent degassing of helium introduced by ancient (probably 1.5 to 2.0 billion years old) pelagic sediments rather than degassing of primordial lower mantle material brought to the surface in plumes. Influx of IDPs can also explain the neon and siderophile compositions of mantle samples."
https://openalex.org/W2034126772,"Measurement from Christmas Island (2 degrees N, 157 degrees W) of long-term mean vertical motions in the tropical atmosphere using very-high-frequency wind-profiling Doppler radar show that there is a transition from downward motion in the free troposphere to upward motion in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. The observations in the free troposphere are consistent with a balance between adiabatic and diabatic heating and cooling rates in a clear atmosphere. Comparison of the results at Christmas Island during El Niño and non-El Niño conditions with earlier results obtained for stratiform rain conditions over Pohnpei, Federated States of Micronesia, show that cirrus clouds in the vicinity of the tropopause likely play an important role in determining the sense and magnitude of vertical motions in this region. These results have implications for the exchange of mass between the troposphere and stratosphere over the tropics."
https://openalex.org/W2056809600,"Low-frequency spectra for the 1989 Macquarie Ridge earthquake (magnitude 8.2) show an amplitude increase and a phase-delay decrease below 6 millihertz that require a short-term slow precursor. This earthquake can be modeled as a compound event in which a fast-rupturing, ordinary earthquake was initiated by an episode of slow, smooth deformation that began more than 100 seconds before the main shock. The moment released in the slow precursor was large, about 3 × 1020 newton-meters, equivalent to an event of magnitude 7.6. The data are consistent with the precursor being generated in a region of the oceanic upper mantle below the main rupture."
https://openalex.org/W2007808248,"Atomic sodium is a useful tracer of the tenuous lunar atmosphere because of its high efficiency in scattering sunlight at the D(1) (5896 angstroms) and D(2) (5890 angstroms) wavelengths. In 1988, Earth-based instruments revealed the presence of sodium at a density of less than 50 atoms per cubic centimeter at lunar altitudes below 100 kilometers. Telescopic observations that are made with a coronograph technique to block out the disk of the moon allow a true picture of the circumiunar atmosphere to be obtained and show the presence of sodium out to a distance of several lunar radii. The distribution of sodium has a solar zenith angle dependence, suggesting that most of the sodium that reaches great altitudes is liberated from the moon's surface by solar photons (by heating or sputtering) or by solar wind impact, in contrast to a source driven by uniform micrometeor bombardment."

https://openalex.org/W2066696229,"Foreign direct investment entered the United States at unprecedented rates during the second half of the 1980s. The result has been much higher levels of foreign ownership of U.S. economic activities than those to which the nation has been accustomed. The reasons for this investment include loss of competitiveness of U.S. firms compared to international rivals as well as attractions to foreign investors of the United States itself. The economic effects of greater levels of foreign ownership are generally positive, although some problems with levels of competition could ensue. National security considerations might cause the United States to place some restrictions on this investment, but other restrictions at the present time appear to be unwarranted."
https://openalex.org/W2023435549,"Among the isotope systems exploited by mantle geochemists to deduce the chemical evolution of the Earth, those of the rare gases are unique because they record the migration of volatile species from the mantle to the atmosphere. The isotopic composition of helium in mantle-derived rocks is now reasonably well known, and it suggests that this migration has been both more heterogeneous and less extensive than commonly expected. The implications of the helium data are profound, but they seem to conflict with widely held beliefs derived from other geochemical tracers, including the isotopic characteristics of lithophile elements (that is, elements such as Sr, Nd, and Pb found predominantly in Earth's silicate rust). Although the geochemical processes affecting the rare gases and lithophile species must be intimately related, it has proven difficult to reconcile them in any obvious way. On page 170 of this issue, Anderson offers a controversial hypothesis that can simultaneously explain all of these disparate tracers (1). If he is correct, a dramatic reinterpretation of the terrestrial rare gas data and their significance to planetary evolution is required."

https://openalex.org/W1975379348,"Four years into the job of building the superconducting Super Collider (SSC)-and in the face of growing political pressure to kill the project-congressional and federal officials are questioning whether the university consortium that run the SSC is up to the job. Universities Research Association Inc. (URA), a group of 80 public and private research universities that also operates Fermilab, was selected as prime contractor in January 1989. But after repeated charges of mismanagement and accounting buses, the Department of Energy (DOE), which funds the project, is contemplating major changes to the contract, including terminating it. DOE Secretary Hazel O'Leary has begun a 30-day review of the project and has laid out three options: terminating the URA contract; awarding separate contracts for science and conventional construction; and renegotiating the existing contract to give DOE a larger oversight role. Sources close to the project predict that O'Leary will pick a variation of the third option and will remove at least one of the managers grilled at last week's hearing."

https://openalex.org/W2046781150,"Scientists have hoisted seven instrument packages by kite to an altitude of 3.5 kilometers, where they measured humidity, temperature, pressure, and electric potential in the troposphere above Christmas Island. The appeal of kites to atmospheric scientists is their ability to hover for weeks over a single location, unlike a balloon or airplane. This results in a long-term profile of atmospheric conditions that couldn't be obtained otherwise. However, only a few Pacific islands and the polar regions remain sufficiently jet-free for the long-term, high altitude kite flights. Plans are underway to seek funding for a 4-year series of kite experiments at Christmas Island and Antarctica. One goal is to probe the stratosphere to investigate such issues as the ozone hole and global warming."
