https://openalex.org/W2056486423,"Neuronal oscillations are ubiquitous in the brain and may contribute to cognition in several ways: for example, by segregating information and organizing spike timing. Recent data show that delta, theta and gamma oscillations are specifically engaged by the multi-timescale, quasi-rhythmic properties of speech and can track its dynamics. We argue that they are foundational in speech and language processing, 'packaging' incoming information into units of the appropriate temporal granularity. Such stimulus-brain alignment arguably results from auditory and motor tuning throughout the evolution of speech and language and constitutes a natural model system allowing auditory research to make a unique contribution to the issue of how neural oscillatory activity affects human cognition."
https://openalex.org/W2152885121,"We present an approximate conditional and joint association analysis that can use summary-level statistics from a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and estimated linkage disequilibrium (LD) from a reference sample with individual-level genotype data. Using this method, we analyzed meta-analysis summary data from the GIANT Consortium for height and body mass index (BMI), with the LD structure estimated from genotype data in two independent cohorts. We identified 36 loci with multiple associated variants for height (38 leading and 49 additional SNPs, 87 in total) via a genome-wide SNP selection procedure. The 49 new SNPs explain approximately 1.3% of variance, nearly doubling the heritability explained at the 36 loci. We did not find any locus showing multiple associated SNPs for BMI. The method we present is computationally fast and is also applicable to case-control data, which we demonstrate in an example from meta-analysis of type 2 diabetes by the DIAGRAM Consortium."

Here, we present an integrative personal omics profile (iPOP), an analysis that combines genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and autoantibody profiles from a single individual over a 14 month period. Our iPOP analysis revealed various medical risks, including type 2 diabetes. It also uncovered extensive, dynamic changes in diverse molecular components and biological pathways across healthy and diseased conditions. Extremely high-coverage genomic and transcriptomic data, which provide the basis of our iPOP, revealed extensive heteroallelic changes during healthy and diseased states and an unexpected RNA editing mechanism. This study demonstrates that longitudinal iPOP can be used to interpret healthy and diseased states by connecting genomic information with additional dynamic omics activity."
https://openalex.org/W2056664023,"Amino acids are required for activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase, which regulates protein translation, cell size, and autophagy. However, the amino acid sensor that directly couples intracellular amino acid-mediated signaling to mTORC1 is unknown. Here we show that leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LRS) plays a critical role in amino acid-induced mTORC1 activation by sensing intracellular leucine concentration and initiating molecular events leading to mTORC1 activation. Mutation of LRS amino acid residues important for leucine binding renders the mTORC1 pathway insensitive to intracellular levels of amino acids. We show that LRS directly binds to Rag GTPase, the mediator of amino acid signaling to mTORC1, in an amino acid-dependent manner and functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Rag GTPase to activate mTORC1. This work demonstrates that LRS is a key mediator for amino acid signaling to mTORC1."
https://openalex.org/W2046466087,"The DNA-damage response (DDR) arrests cell-cycle progression until damage is removed. DNA-damage-induced cellular senescence is associated with persistent DDR. The molecular bases that distinguish transient from persistent DDR are unknown. Here we show that a large fraction of exogenously induced persistent DDR markers is associated with telomeric DNA in cultured cells and mammalian tissues. In yeast, a chromosomal DNA double-strand break next to a telomeric sequence resists repair and impairs DNA ligase 4 recruitment. In mammalian cells, ectopic localization of telomeric factor TRF2 next to a double-strand break induces persistent DNA damage and DDR. Linear, but not circular, telomeric DNA or scrambled DNA induces a prolonged checkpoint in normal cells. In terminally differentiated tissues of old primates, DDR markers accumulate at telomeres that are not critically short. We propose that linear genomes are not uniformly reparable and that telomeric DNA tracts, if damaged, are irreparable and trigger persistent DDR and cellular senescence. D’Adda di Fagagna and colleagues observe that, after genotoxic treatment of cells and mice, unrepaired DNA-damage foci and DNA-damage signalling persist at telomeres. They show that introducing the telomeric protein TRF2 near a double-strand break elsewhere on the chromosomes prevents repair. Unrepaired foci are also observed at telomeres of ageing animals, suggesting a role for TRF2 in senescence establishment."
https://openalex.org/W2020407498,"Rett syndrome is an X-linked autism spectrum disorder. The disease is characterized in most cases by mutation of the MECP2 gene, which encodes a methyl-CpG-binding protein. Although MECP2 is expressed in many tissues, the disease is generally attributed to a primary neuronal dysfunction. However, as shown recently, glia, specifically astrocytes, also contribute to Rett pathophysiology. Here we examine the role of another form of glia, microglia, in a murine model of Rett syndrome. Transplantation of wild-type bone marrow into irradiation-conditioned Mecp2-null hosts resulted in engraftment of brain parenchyma by bone-marrow-derived myeloid cells of microglial phenotype, and arrest of disease development. However, when cranial irradiation was blocked by lead shield, and microglial engraftment was prevented, disease was not arrested. Similarly, targeted expression of MECP2 in myeloid cells, driven by Lysm(cre) on an Mecp2-null background, markedly attenuated disease symptoms. Thus, through multiple approaches, wild-type Mecp2-expressing microglia within the context of an Mecp2-null male mouse arrested numerous facets of disease pathology: lifespan was increased, breathing patterns were normalized, apnoeas were reduced, body weight was increased to near that of wild type, and locomotor activity was improved. Mecp2(+/-) females also showed significant improvements as a result of wild-type microglial engraftment. These benefits mediated by wild-type microglia, however, were diminished when phagocytic activity was inhibited pharmacologically by using annexin V to block phosphatydilserine residues on apoptotic targets, thus preventing recognition and engulfment by tissue-resident phagocytes. These results suggest the importance of microglial phagocytic activity in Rett syndrome. Our data implicate microglia as major players in the pathophysiology of this devastating disorder, and suggest that bone marrow transplantation might offer a feasible therapeutic approach for it."

https://openalex.org/W2094207365,"In parallel with an ongoing human clinical trial, genetically engineered mouse models of lung cancer with different genetic alterations are treated with chemotherapeutic agents; the results have implications for the clinical trial. The idea of 'co-clinical' trials has been put forward as way of evaluating novel therapies. By testing a drug simultaneously in human clinical and mouse preclinical trials, the thinking is, the two sets of data can be combined to extract extra information. To demonstrate the potential of this approach, genetically engineered mouse models were used to mirror a randomized phase II clinical trial of the chemotherapeutic docetaxel in KRAS-driven lung cancer, comparing its action alone with that in combination with a MEK inhibitor. In the mouse model, tumours with Kras or Kras and p53 mutations were more responsive to the combination than to docetaxel alone, whereas mice carrying a deletion of Lkb1 in addition to activated Kras remained relatively unresponsive. This has important implications for the ongoing clinical trial, suggesting that patients should be tested for LKB1 mutations. Targeted therapies have demonstrated efficacy against specific subsets of molecularly defined cancers1,2,3,4. Although most patients with lung cancer are stratified according to a single oncogenic driver, cancers harbouring identical activating genetic mutations show large variations in their responses to the same targeted therapy1,3. The biology underlying this heterogeneity is not well understood, and the impact of co-existing genetic mutations, especially the loss of tumour suppressors5,6,7,8,9, has not been fully explored. Here we use genetically engineered mouse models to conduct a ‘co-clinical’ trial that mirrors an ongoing human clinical trial in patients with KRAS-mutant lung cancers. This trial aims to determine if the MEK inhibitor selumetinib (AZD6244)10 increases the efficacy of docetaxel, a standard of care chemotherapy. Our studies demonstrate that concomitant loss of either p53 (also known as Tp53) or Lkb1 (also known as Stk11), two clinically relevant tumour suppressors6,9,11,12, markedly impaired the response of Kras-mutant cancers to docetaxel monotherapy. We observed that the addition of selumetinib provided substantial benefit for mice with lung cancer caused by Kras and Kras and p53 mutations, but mice with Kras and Lkb1 mutations had primary resistance to this combination therapy. Pharmacodynamic studies, including positron-emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT), identified biological markers in mice and patients that provide a rationale for the differential efficacy of these therapies in the different genotypes. These co-clinical results identify predictive genetic biomarkers that should be validated by interrogating samples from patients enrolled on the concurrent clinical trial. These studies also highlight the rationale for synchronous co-clinical trials, not only to anticipate the results of ongoing human clinical trials, but also to generate clinically relevant hypotheses that can inform the analysis and design of human studies."
https://openalex.org/W2009265628,"Here we show that bacterial communication through indole signaling induces persistence, a phenomenon in which a subset of an isogenic bacterial population tolerates antibiotic treatment. We monitor indole-induced persister formation using microfluidics and identify the role of oxidative-stress and phage-shock pathways in this phenomenon. We propose a model in which indole signaling 'inoculates' a bacterial subpopulation against antibiotics by activating stress responses, leading to persister formation."
https://openalex.org/W2055692928,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are chronic relapsing and remitting conditions associated with long-term gut dysfunction resulting from alterations to the enteric nervous system and a loss of enteric neurons. The mechanisms underlying inflammation-induced enteric neuron death are unknown. Here using in vivo models of experimental colitis we report that inflammation causes enteric neuron death by activating a neuronal signaling complex composed of P2X7 receptors (P2X7Rs), pannexin-1 (Panx1) channels, the Asc adaptor protein and caspases. Inhibition of P2X7R, Panx1, Asc or caspase activity prevented inflammation-induced neuron cell death. Preservation of enteric neurons by inhibiting Panx1 in vivo prevented the onset of inflammation-induced colonic motor dysfunction. Panx1 expression was reduced in Crohn's disease but not ulcerative colitis. We conclude that activation of neuronal Panx1 underlies neuron death and the subsequent development of abnormal gut motility in IBD. Targeting Panx1 represents a new neuroprotective strategy to ameliorate the progression of IBD-associated dysmotility."
https://openalex.org/W2027415486,"A family of small molecules called ‘ciliobrevins’ are described that can rapidly and reversibly modulate the AAA+ ATPase motor dynein, which transports cargo molecules along microtubule tracks. Enzymes of the AAA+ ATPase family convert chemical potential energy into the mechanical forces required for cellular processes, such as cargo transport and cytoskeleton disassembly. Here, Firestone et al. describe a class of small molecules called ciliobrevins. These molecules can rapidly and reversibly modulate the AAA+ ATPase motor, dynein, which transports cargo molecules along microtubule tracks. The ciliobrevins will be useful as molecular probes of dynein function. The conversion of chemical energy into mechanical force by AAA+ (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities) ATPases is integral to cellular processes, including DNA replication, protein unfolding, cargo transport and membrane fusion1. The AAA+ ATPase motor cytoplasmic dynein regulates ciliary trafficking2, mitotic spindle formation3 and organelle transport4, and dissecting its precise functions has been challenging because of its rapid timescale of action and the lack of cell-permeable, chemical modulators. Here we describe the discovery of ciliobrevins, the first specific small-molecule antagonists of cytoplasmic dynein. Ciliobrevins perturb protein trafficking within the primary cilium, leading to their malformation and Hedgehog signalling blockade. Ciliobrevins also prevent spindle pole focusing, kinetochore–microtubule attachment, melanosome aggregation and peroxisome motility in cultured cells. We further demonstrate the ability of ciliobrevins to block dynein-dependent microtubule gliding and ATPase activity in vitro. Ciliobrevins therefore will be useful reagents for studying cellular processes that require this microtubule motor and may guide the development of additional AAA+ ATPase superfamily inhibitors."

https://openalex.org/W2096486669,"Metabolic challenge protocols, such as the oral glucose tolerance test, can uncover early alterations in metabolism preceding chronic diseases. Nevertheless, most metabolomics data accessible today reflect the fasting state. To analyze the dynamics of the human metabolome in response to environmental stimuli, we submitted 15 young healthy male volunteers to a highly controlled 4 d challenge protocol, including 36 h fasting, oral glucose and lipid tests, liquid test meals, physical exercise, and cold stress. Blood, urine, exhaled air, and breath condensate samples were analyzed on up to 56 time points by MS-and NMR-based methods, yielding 275 metabolic traits with a focus on lipids and amino acids. Here, we show that physiological challenges increased interindividual variation even in phenotypically similar volunteers, revealing metabotypes not observable in baseline metabolite profiles; volunteer-specific metabolite concentrations were consistently reflected in various biofluids; and readouts from a systematic model of β-oxidation (e.g., acetylcarnitine/palmitylcarnitine ratio) showed significant and stronger associations with physiological parameters (e.g., fat mass) than absolute metabolite concentrations, indicating that systematic models may aid in understanding individual challenge responses. Due to the multitude of analytical methods, challenges and sample types, our freely available metabolomics data set provides a unique reference for future metabolomics studies and for verification of systems biology models.—Krug, S., Kastenmüller, G., Stückler, F., Rist, M.

In this study, we have successfully directed human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) to enriched populations of DARPP32-expressing forebrain GABA neurons. Transplantation of these human forebrain GABA neurons and their progenitors, but not spinal GABA cells, into the striatum of quinolinic acid-lesioned mice results in generation of large populations of DARPP32(+) GABA neurons, which project to the substantia nigra as well as receiving glutamatergic and dopaminergic inputs, corresponding to correction of motor deficits. This finding raises hopes for cell therapy for HD."
https://openalex.org/W1980913885,"The RNA-binding proteins TDP-43 and FUS form abnormal cytoplasmic aggregates in affected tissues of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar dementia. TDP-43 and FUS localize mainly in the nucleus where they regulate pre-mRNA splicing, but they are also involved in mRNA transport, stability, and translation. To better investigate their cytoplasmic activities, we applied an RNA immunoprecipitation and chip analysis to define the mRNAs associated to TDP-43 and FUS in the cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein complexes from motoneuronal NSC-34 cells. We found that they bind different sets of mRNAs although converging on common cellular pathways. Bioinformatics analyses identified the (UG)(n) consensus motif in 80% of 3'-UTR sequences of TDP-43 targets, whereas for FUS the binding motif was less evident. By in vitro assays we validated binding to selected target 3'-UTRs, including Vegfa and Grn for TDP-43, and Vps54, Nvl, and Taf15 for FUS. We showed that TDP-43 has a destabilizing activity on Vegfa and Grn mRNAs and may ultimately affect progranulin protein content, whereas FUS does not affect mRNA stability/translation of its targets. We also demonstrated that three different point mutations in TDP-43 did not change the binding affinity for Vegfa and Grn mRNAs or their protein level. Our data indicate that TDP-43 and FUS recognize distinct sets of mRNAs and differently regulate their fate in the cytoplasm of motoneuron-like cells, therefore suggesting complementary roles in neuronal RNA metabolism and neurodegeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2001969173,"The basic unit of skeletal muscle in all metazoans is the multinucleate myofibre, within which individual nuclei are regularly positioned. The molecular machinery responsible for myonuclear positioning is not known. Improperly positioned nuclei are a hallmark of numerous diseases of muscle, including centronuclear myopathies, but it is unclear whether correct nuclear positioning is necessary for muscle function. Here we identify the microtubule-associated protein ensconsin (Ens)/microtubule-associated protein 7 (MAP7) and kinesin heavy chain (Khc)/Kif5b as essential, evolutionarily conserved regulators of myonuclear positioning in Drosophila and cultured mammalian myotubes. We find that these proteins interact physically and that expression of the Kif5b motor domain fused to the MAP7 microtubule-binding domain rescues nuclear positioning defects in MAP7-depleted cells. This suggests that MAP7 links Kif5b to the microtubule cytoskeleton to promote nuclear positioning. Finally, we show that myonuclear positioning is physiologically important. Drosophila ens mutant larvae have decreased locomotion and incorrect myonuclear positioning, and these phenotypes are rescued by muscle-specific expression of Ens. We conclude that improper nuclear positioning contributes to muscle dysfunction in a cell-autonomous fashion."
https://openalex.org/W2057020332,"In this Perspective, we synthesize past and present observations in the field of epigenetics to propose a model in which the epigenome can modulate cellular plasticity in development and disease by regulating the effects of noise. In this model, the epigenome facilitates phase transitions in development and reprogramming and mediates canalization, or the ability to produce a consistent phenotypic outcome despite being challenged by variable conditions, during cell fate commitment. After grounding our argument in a discussion of stochastic noise and nongenetic heterogeneity, we explore the hypothesis that distinct chromatin domains, which are known to be dysregulated in disease and remodeled during development, might underlie cellular plasticity more generally. We then present a modern portrayal of Waddington's epigenetic landscape through a mathematical formalism. We speculate that this new framework might impact how we approach disease mechanisms. In particular, it may help to explain the observation that the variability of DNA methylation and gene expression are increased in cancer, thus contributing to tumor cell heterogeneity."
https://openalex.org/W2059752598,"Neurons are interconnected with extraordinary precision to assemble a functional nervous system. Compared to axon guidance, far less is understood about how individual pre- and postsynaptic partners are matched. To ensure the proper relay of olfactory information in the fruitfly Drosophila, axons of ∼50 classes of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) form one-to-one connections with dendrites of ∼50 classes of projection neurons (PNs). Here, using genetic screens, we identified two evolutionarily conserved, epidermal growth factor (EGF)-repeat containing transmembrane Teneurin proteins, Ten-m and Ten-a, as synaptic-partner-matching molecules between PN dendrites and ORN axons. Ten-m and Ten-a are highly expressed in select PN-ORN matching pairs. Teneurin loss- and gain-of-function cause specific mismatching of select ORNs and PNs. Finally, Teneurins promote homophilic interactions in vitro, and Ten-m co-expression in non-partner PNs and ORNs promotes their ectopic connections in vivo. We propose that Teneurins instruct matching specificity between synaptic partners through homophilic attraction."
https://openalex.org/W2089268791,"Two Drosophila Teneurin proteins, Ten-m and Ten-a, are shown to be required for neuromuscular synapse organization and target selection. Our molecular understanding of brain wiring has mostly concerned proteins implicated in axon guidance and large-scale dendritic-arborization development. In a pair of papers published this week, Liqun Luo and colleagues now show that two members of the Teneurin family of large transmembrane proteins control the final steps of neuronal targeting. The papers, which focus on the Drosophila olfactory systems and neuromuscular junctions respectively, indicate that Teneurins interact homophilically across the synaptic cleft to ensure proper matching among developing neurons. Synapse assembly requires trans-synaptic signals between the pre- and postsynapse1, but our understanding of the essential organizational molecules involved in this process remains incomplete2. Teneurin proteins are conserved, epidermal growth factor (EGF)-repeat-containing transmembrane proteins with large extracellular domains3. Here we show that two Drosophila Teneurins, Ten-m and Ten-a, are required for neuromuscular synapse organization and target selection. Ten-a is presynaptic whereas Ten-m is mostly postsynaptic; neuronal Ten-a and muscle Ten-m form a complex in vivo. Pre- or postsynaptic Teneurin perturbations cause severe synapse loss and impair many facets of organization trans-synaptically and cell autonomously. These include defects in active zone apposition, release sites, membrane and vesicle organization, and synaptic transmission. Moreover, the presynaptic microtubule and postsynaptic spectrin cytoskeletons are severely disrupted, suggesting a mechanism whereby Teneurins organize the cytoskeleton, which in turn affects other aspects of synapse development. Supporting this, Ten-m physically interacts with α-Spectrin. Genetic analyses of teneurin and neuroligin reveal that they have differential roles that synergize to promote synapse assembly. Finally, at elevated endogenous levels, Ten-m regulates target selection between specific motor neurons and muscles. Our study identifies the Teneurins as a key bi-directional trans-synaptic signal involved in general synapse organization, and demonstrates that proteins such as these can also regulate target selection."
https://openalex.org/W2077472315,"Even though schizophrenia has a strong hereditary component, departures from simple genetic transmission are prominent. DNA methylation has emerged as an epigenetic explanatory candidate of schizophrenia's nonmendelian characteristics. To investigate this assumption, we examined genome-wide (global) and gene-specific DNA methylation levels, which are associated with genomic stability and gene expression activity, respectively. Analyses were conducted using DNA from leukocytes of patients with schizophrenia and controls. Global methylation results revealed a highly significant hypomethylation in patients with schizophrenia (P<2.0×10-6) and linear regression among patients generated a model in which antipsychotic treatment and disease onset explained 11% of the global methylation variance (adjusted R2=0.11, ANOVA P>0.001). Specifically, haloperidol was associated with higher (“control-like”) methylation (P=0.001), and early onset (a putative marker of schizophrenia severity) was associated with lower methylation (P=0.002). With regard to the gene-specific methylation analyses, and in accordance with the dopamine hypothesis of psychosis, we found that the analyzed region of S-COMT was hypermethylated in patients with schizophrenia (P=0.004). In summary, these data support the notion of a dysregulated epigenome in schizophrenia, which, at least globally, is more pronounced in early-onset patients and can be partly rescued by antipsychotic medication. In addition, blood DNA-methylation signatures show promise of serving as a schizophrenia biomarker in the future.—Melas, P. A., Rogdaki, M., Ösby, U., Schalling, M., Lavebratt, C., Ekström, T. J.

https://openalex.org/W1987920581,"Leptin and BDNF are two protein cytokines known to inhibit food intake. Baoji Xu and colleagues have now shown that leptin-mediated inhibition of food intake is dependent on leptin binding to one set of hypothalamic neurons, which results in neuronal activation of other hypothalamic neurons to increase the dendritic expression of BDNF in those targeted neurons. These results show a new functional link between these two anorexigenic cytokines and how leptin signaling is propagated to regulate food intake. Mutations in the Bdnf gene, which produces transcripts with either short or long 3′ untranslated regions (3′ UTRs), cause human obesity; however, the precise role of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the regulation of energy balance is unknown. Here we show the relationship between Bdnf mRNA with a long 3′ UTR (long 3′ UTR Bdnf mRNA), leptin, neuronal activation and body weight. We found that long 3′ UTR Bdnf mRNA was enriched in the dendrites of hypothalamic neurons and that insulin and leptin could stimulate its translation in dendrites. Furthermore, mice harboring a truncated long Bdnf 3′ UTR developed severe hyperphagic obesity, which was completely reversed by viral expression of long 3′ UTR Bdnf mRNA in the hypothalamus. In these mice, the ability of leptin to activate hypothalamic neurons and inhibit food intake was compromised despite normal activation of leptin receptors. These results reveal a novel mechanism linking leptin action to BDNF expression during hypothalamic-mediated regulation of body weight, while also implicating dendritic protein synthesis in this process."
https://openalex.org/W2081143491,"Although development leads unidirectionally toward more restricted cell fates, recent work in cellular reprogramming has proven that one cellular identity can strikingly convert into another, promising countless applications in biomedical research and paving the way for modeling diseases with patient-derived stem cells. To date, there has been little discussion of which disease models are likely to be most informative. Here, we review evidence demonstrating that, because environmental influences and epigenetic signatures are largely erased during reprogramming, patient-specific models of diseases with strong genetic bases and high penetrance are likely to prove most informative in the near term. We also discuss the implications of the new reprogramming paradigm in biomedicine and outline how reprogramming of cell identities is enhancing our understanding of cell differentiation and prospects for cellular therapies and in vivo regeneration."

Here we reflect on analogous challenges faced by researchers in infectious diseases. We compare and contrast the resistance mechanisms arising in cancer and infectious diseases and discuss how approaches for overcoming viral and bacterial infections, such as HIV and tuberculosis, are instructive for developing a more rational approach for cancer therapy. In particular, maximizing the effect of the initial treatment response, which often requires synergistic combination therapy, is foremost among these approaches. A remaining challenge in both fields is identifying drugs that eliminate drug-tolerant ""persister"" cells (infectious disease) or tumor-initiating/stem cells (cancer) to prevent late relapse and shorten treatment duration."
https://openalex.org/W2097736544,"The protein phosphatase LYP is known to regulate signaling in the immune system, but the regulatory mechanisms controlling LYP itself are less clear. Exploration of spatiotemporal dynamics and application of a newly identified chemical inhibitor now define a role for the kinase CSK in dialing down LYP activity. Lymphoid tyrosine phosphatase (LYP) and C-terminal Src kinase (CSK) are negative regulators of signaling mediated through the T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) and are thought to act in a cooperative manner when forming a complex. Here we studied the spatiotemporal dynamics of the LYP–CSK complex in T cells. We demonstrate that dissociation of this complex is necessary for recruitment of LYP to the plasma membrane, where it downmodulates TCR signaling. Development of a potent and selective chemical probe of LYP confirmed that LYP inhibits T-cell activation when removed from CSK. Our findings may explain the reduced TCR-mediated signaling associated with a single-nucleotide polymorphism that confers increased risk for certain autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis, and results in expression of a mutant LYP that is unable to bind CSK. Our compound also represents a starting point for the development of a LYP-based treatment of autoimmunity."

Pulido et al. extend this approach and identify specific tumor-associated antigens from tumor-derived virus-expressed cDNA libraries that can be used in combination to cure established melanoma in mice. Multiple intravenous injections of a cDNA library, derived from human melanoma cell lines and expressed using the highly immunogenic vector vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), cured mice with established melanoma tumors. Successful tumor eradication was associated with the ability of mouse lymphoid cells to mount a tumor-specific CD4+ interleukin (IL)-17 recall response in vitro. We used this characteristic IL-17 response to screen the VSV-cDNA library and identified three different VSV-cDNA virus clones that, when used in combination but not alone, achieved the same efficacy against tumors as the complete parental virus library. VSV-expressed cDNA libraries can therefore be used to identify tumor rejection antigens that can cooperate to induce anti-tumor responses. This technology should be applicable to antigen discovery for other cancers, as well as for other diseases in which immune reactivity against more than one target antigen contributes to disease pathology."

Dendrites from a single neuron may be highly branched but typically do not overlap. Self-avoidance behavior has been shown to depend on cell-specific membrane proteins that trigger mutual repulsion. Here we report the unexpected discovery that a diffusible cue, the axon guidance protein UNC-6 (Netrin), is required for self-avoidance of sister dendrites from the PVD nociceptive neuron in Caenorhabditis elegans. We used time-lapse imaging to show that dendrites fail to withdraw upon mutual contact in the absence of UNC-6 signaling. We propose a model in which the UNC-40 (Deleted in Colorectal Cancer; DCC) receptor captures UNC-6 at the tips of growing dendrites for interaction with UNC-5 on the apposing branch to induce mutual repulsion. UNC-40 also responds to dendritic contact through another pathway that is independent of UNC-6. Our findings offer a new model for how an evolutionarily conserved morphogenic cue and its cognate receptors can pattern a fundamental feature of dendritic architecture."
https://openalex.org/W1986918091,"Neuronal injury elicits potent cellular responses from glia, but molecular pathways modulating glial activation, phagocytic function and termination of reactive responses remain poorly defined. Here we show that positive or negative regulation of glial responses to axon injury is molecularly encoded by unique isoforms of the Drosophila melanogaster engulfment receptor Draper. Draper-I promotes engulfment of axonal debris through an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM). In contrast, Draper-II, an alternative splice variant, potently inhibits glial engulfment function. Draper-II suppresses Draper-I signaling through a previously undescribed immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM)-like domain and the tyrosine phosphatase Corkscrew (Csw). Intriguingly, loss of Draper-II-Csw signaling prolongs expression of glial engulfment genes after axotomy and reduces the ability of glia to respond to secondary axotomy. Our work highlights a novel role for Draper-II in inhibiting glial responses to neurodegeneration, and indicates that a balance of opposing Draper-I and Draper-II signaling events is essential to maintain glial sensitivity to brain injury."

Genetically engineered mice provide a powerful tool to analyze these changes, although they are slow and costly and do not always recapitulate human biology. Recent advances in genomic technologies, rodent-modeling approaches, and the production of patient-derived reprogrammed cell lines now provide a plethora of complementary systems to study disease states and test new therapies. Continued evolution and integration of these model systems will be the key to realizing the benefits of the genomic revolution and refining our understanding and treatment of human diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1987528629,"IL-9 regulates diverse inflammatory immune responses. Although the functional importance of IL-9 has been investigated in various pathophysiological conditions, molecular mechanisms by which TCR stimulation induced IL-9 gene expression are still unclear. In this study, we investigated the functional importance of the NFAT1 and NF-κB (p65) in IL-9 gene transcription in CD4+ T cells. In vivo binding of NFAT1 and NF-κB (p65) to the IL-9 promoter was observed. NFAT1 binding induced a transcriptionally active chromatin configuration at the IL-9 promoter locus, whereas NF-κB (p65) binding transactivated the IL-9 promoter. Mouse deficient in NFAT1 shows a significant down-regulation of IL-9 expression that resulted from an inaccessible chromatin configuration at the IL-9 promoter. In parallel, knockdown of NF-κB (p65) also resulted in reduced IL-9 expression. In this process, NFAT1 plays a pivotal role as a core protein that creates an accessible platform for the assembly of transcription activators. The presence of NFAT1 correlates with recruitment of NF-κB (p65), p300, and active histone markers on the IL-9 promoter, resulting in a transcriptionally competent promoter. NFAT1 deficiency significantly reduced the recruitment of the above activation complex to the IL-9 promoter. In summary, our data suggest that functional cooperation of NFAT1 and NF-κB synergistically enhances IL-9 transcription in CD4+ T cells. IL-9 regulates diverse inflammatory immune responses.

Thus, elucidating the underlying mechanism of IL-9 expression will further advance the understanding of the functional variety and diversity of IL-9-producing cells and IL-9 itself. The activation and expression of specific transcription factors in the T helper cell subsets govern their signature cytokine expression. So far, Pu.1, IRF4, and STAT6 have been reported to play crucial roles in Th9 lineage commitment and regulation of IL-9 expression (21Chang H.C. Sehra S. Goswami R. Yao W. Yu Q. Stritesky G.L.

However, these factors do not act alone and require the participation of other transcription factors that may play a pivotal role in inducing IL-9 following TCR stimulation (24Perumal N.B.

Ubiquitously expressed transcription factors are also known to induce subset-specific expression of cytokines. This includes the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) 2The abbreviations used are: NFATnuclear factor of activated T cellsPMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetateqRT-PCRquantitative RT-PCRMNasemicrococcal nucleaseAcH3 and AcH4acetyl histone H3 and H4, respectivelyH3K4Me2dimethyl lysine histone H3Pol IIpolymerase IIPIPMA/ionomycin. family members, which have diverse roles in T cell subsets (25Hermann-Kleiter N. Baier G. NFAT pulls the strings during CD4+ T helper cell effector functions.Blood. 2010; 115: 2989-2997Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The NFAT proteins (NFAT1 to -4) are regulated by Ca2+ except for NFAT5 (TonEBP (tonicity element-binding protein) or OREBP (osmotic response element-binding protein)), which responds to osmotic stress (26Macian F.

Activation and deactivation of gene expression by Ca2+/calcineurin-NFAT-mediated signaling.Mol. Cells. 2004; 18: 1-9PubMed Google Scholar). TCR stimulation coupled with Ca2+ mobilization results in the activation of Ca2+-dependent NFATs via the calcium-calmodulin phosphatase pathway (28Cantrell D.

Signal transduction by lymphocyte antigen receptors.Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1957) Google Scholar). NFATs act in concert with other transcription factors to direct their target gene expression, often in a cell- and tissue-specific manner. For example, NFAT1/T-bet interaction directs the Th1-specific IFN-γ expression; NFAT1/IRF4 induces IL-4 and IL-10 expression in Th2 cells, whereas NFAT2/Smad3 interaction governs Foxp3 expression in regulatory T cells (30Lee C.G.

NFATs also interact with active histone modifiers, CBP/p300, to direct changes in chromatin architecture (34García-Rodríguez C. Rao A.

Luo C. Hogan P.G. Transcription factors of the NFAT family. Regulation and function.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2227) Google Scholar). In the context of IL-9, previous reports suggested a potential link of NFAT with IL-9 expression. Treatment of cyclosporin A (CsA) to the mice infected with the parasite, Leishmania major, ablated antigen-specific IL-9 production (37Gessner A. Blum H. Röllinghoff M.

More specifically, umbilical cord blood T cells that express reduced NFAT1 compared with adult blood T cells produce a significantly reduced level of IL-9 (38Kadereit S. Mohammad S.F. Miller R.E.

NF-κB family is another well known ubiquitous transcription factor family that regulates genes involved in diverse biological processes, such as growth and survival and also inflammatory immune responses. They bind to specific decameric sequences located within the target gene promoter or other regulatory regions (40Baldwin Jr., A.S. The NF-κB and IκB proteins. New discoveries and insights.Annu. Rev.

Modulation of interferon-regulated gene expression by Rel/nuclear factor κB.J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1281-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). This family consists of five members (NF-κB1 (p50/p105), NF-κB2 (p52/p100), c-REL, RELA (p65), and RELB (I-REL)). Inhibitory proteins, inhibitory κB (IκB), regulate the activity of NF-κB family of proteins by sequestering them in the cytosol and preventing their nuclear translocation (43Sun S.C. Yamaoka S. Activation of NF-κB by HTLV-I and implications for cell transformation.Oncogene. 2005; 24: 5952-5964Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). This family requires the activity of transcription coactivators to execute their transactivity. CBP/p300 is one of the coactivators with intrinsic histone acetylase activity and is required for p65-mediated transactivation (44Gao Z. Chiao P. Zhang X. Zhang X. Lazar M.A. Seto E. Young H.A. Ye J.

NF-κB has also been implicated in IL-9 expression in mouse macrophage cells upon LPS stimulation (46Stassen M. Müller C. Arnold M. Hültner L. Klein-Hessling S. Neudörfl C. Reineke T. Serfling E. Schmitt E. IL-9 and IL-13 production by activated mast cells is strongly enhanced in the presence of lipopolysaccharide. NF-κB is decisively involved in the expression of IL-9.J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 4391-4398Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Also, binding of NF-κB to the human IL-9 promoter in T cells has been demonstrated (24Perumal N.B. Kaplan M.H. Regulating Il9 transcription in T helper cells.Trends Immunol. 2011; 32: 146-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 47Zhu Y.X. Kang L.Y. Luo W. Li C.C. Yang L.

In this study, we identified the functional synergy of two transcription factors, NFAT1 and NF-κB (p65), in IL-9 expression by Th9 cells. NFAT1 is primarily involved in stabilizing and maintaining a transcriptionally competent chromatin structure, whereas NF-κB transactivates the IL-9 promoter. To identify potential transcription factor binding sites in the IL-9 promoter, comparative genomic analysis was performed. Genomic sequence of the IL-9 gene promoter was analyzed using the Web-based alignment software ECR Browser and VISTA Browser 2.0 (48Frazer K.A. Pachter L. Poliakov A. Rubin E.M. Dubchak I. VISTA. Computational tools for comparative genomics.Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W273-W279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1696) Google Scholar). C57BL/6 mice 6–8 weeks of age were purchased from Orient Bio (Daejon, Korea). NFAT1-deficient mice (KO) were kindly provided by Dr. A. Rao (Harvard Medical School). Mice were housed in specific pathogen-free barrier facilities and used in accordance with protocols approved by the Animal Care and Ethics Committees of the Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology. CD4+ T cells were isolated, differentiated, and cultured as described previously (30Lee C.G. Kang K.H. So J.S. Kwon H.K. Son J.S. Song M.K. Sahoo A. Yi H.J. Hwang K.C. Matsuyama T. Yui K. Im S.H.

Briefly, CD4+ T cells were purified from the lymph nodes and spleen of 8–12-week-old mice with the use of magnetic beads (L3T4, Miltenyi). For T helper cell differentiation, CD4+ T cells (2–3 × 106/ml) were stimulated with 1 μg/ml plate-bound α-CD3 and 2 μg/ml soluble α-CD28 under Th1 skewing (10 ng/ml IL-12 plus 10 μg/ml α-IL-4), Th2 skewing (10 ng/ml IL-4, 10 μg/ml α-IFN-γ plus 10 μg/ml anti-IL-12), and Th9-skewing (10 ng/ml IL-4 and 1 ng/ml TGF-β) or left in unpolarized (CD4+ T cell blasts) (6Veldhoen M.

On day 3, cells were shifted to complete medium containing IL-2 and expanded. On day 5, they were restimulated with 50 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) plus 1 μm ionomycin or 1 μg/ml plate-bound α-CD3 and α-CD28 as mentioned in particular cases. Total RNA was extracted from the stimulated or unstimulated cells using TRIzol reagent (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For reverse transcription, 1 μg of total RNA was used, and cDNA was generated using oligo(dT) primer (Promega, Madison, WI) and Improm-II reverse transcriptase (Promega) in a total volume of 20 μl. The mRNA level was determined using 1 μl of cDNA by real-time PCR with SYBR green according to the manufacturer's protocol (Chromo4, MJ Research). Mouse hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase primer was used for qRT-PCR to normalize the amount of cDNA used for each condition. The primer sequences used are as follows: hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (5′-TTA TGG ACA GGA CTG AAA GAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCT TTA ATG TAA TCC AGC AGG T-3′ (reverse)), IL-9 (5′-GTG ACA TAC ATC CTT GCC TC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GTG GTA CAA TCA TCA GTT GGG-3′ (reverse)). For ELISA, cell supernatants were collected from unstimulated and 24 h PMA/ionomycin- or α-CD3/CD28-stimulated cells, and cytokines were measured using IL-4, IL-9, and IFN-γ ELISA kits (eBiosciences, San Diego, CA).

Chromatins prepared from Th9 cells after PMA/ionomycin stimulation were immunoprecipitated using antibodies against RNA Pol II (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), acetyl histone H3 (AcH3), acetyl histone H4 (AcH4), dimethyl lysine histone H3 (H3K4me2) (Upstate, Lake Placid, NY), p300 (Millipore, Billerica, MA), NFAT1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), p65 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), and rabbit IgG (Sigma-Aldrich). After washing, samples were eluted in elution buffer (1% SDS and 0.1 m NaHCO3) for the first ChIP. For the second immunoprecipitation, complexes were eluted from the primary immunoprecipitation with 10 mm DTT at 37 °C for 30 min and diluted 1:50 in buffer (1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1), followed by reimmunoprecipitation with second antibodies similarly to the first ChIP (52Lerner L.

Following reversal of cross-links, the presence of selected DNA sequences was assessed by qRT-PCR using SYBR Green PCR mix. As a loading control, PCR was done directly on input DNA purified from chromatin before immunoprecipitation. The primer pairs used for detecting IL-9 promoter are: (5′-CAT TAC CAC CCC TGT AAC TCA C-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTA CCA GCA TCT TCC AGT CTA GC-3′ (reverse)). A pair of primers corresponding to the non-relevant region (designated as NR; +1864/+2193), NR-F-5′ (ATG TAA CCA GGA ACA AGA TCA CTG CAG) and NR-R-5′ (GTG GAA GTA CTT ACC TAG ACC TTG GTG TC), was used as a control for the time-dependent ChIP experiment. The amount of chromatin precipitated by the indicated antibodies as detected by RT-PCR with primers against the target regions relative to that detected in the input (total chromatin) by the same primer pair is represented as a fraction of input or as negative images of EtBr-stained gels. Th9 cells (5 × 106 cells/sample) differentiated from wild type (WT) and NFAT1−/− (KO) CD4+ T cells were left unstimulated or restimulated with PMA/ionomycin (PI) for 8 h and pelleted by centrifugation at 500 × g, washed in ice-cold PBS, and then resuspended in 100 μl of digestion buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 15 mm NaCl, 60 mm KCl, 0.15 mm spermine, 0.5 mm spermidine, 1 mm CaCl2) with or without 5 units/ml micrococcal nuclease (MNase) (Roche Applied Science) and were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Reactions were terminated by adding 20 μl of Stop solution (100 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, pH 8.1) and 10 ml of SDS 10% (w/v). DNA was isolated using the DNA blood genomic prep kit (Intron Biotechnology, Daejon, Korea) and eluted into 100 μl of TE (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA) buffer. DNAs recovered from MNase samples were checked for fragmentation (500–1000 bp) in 1% agarose gel. Primers used in the quantitative assays were validated by amplifying serially diluted genomic DNA as templates to create a standard curve for each primer set and analyzed using the quantification method. Untreated and MNase-treated samples were used in PCR assays to measure the relative abundance of target regions using the primer sets used in ChIP experiments. Actin promoter primers (5′-TTC CGA AAG TTG CCT TTT ATG GCT CGA-3′ (forward) and 5′-AAG GAG CTG CAA AGA AGC TGT G-3′ (reverse)) were used as controls. Chromatin accessibility values were calculated as the ratio of the undigested sample to the digested samples, and then the data were plotted as the ratio of accessibility observed in the digested DNA samples.

IL-9 promoter reporter construct that lacks the first NF-κB binding site (designated as ΔNF-κB1-Prom) was amplified using primer 5′-CCA GAA TTC CTG CTT TTA AAG (forward) and cloned into pXPG luciferase reporter vector. The sequences of cloned DNA fragments were confirmed by DNA sequencing.

https://openalex.org/W2027304858,"The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) and its regulatory partner phospholamban (PLN) are essential for myocardial contractility. Arg(9) → Cys (R9C) and Arg(14) deletion (R14del) mutations in PLN are associated with lethal dilated cardiomyopathy in humans. To better understand these mutations, we made a series of amino acid substitutions in the cytoplasmic domain of PLN and tested their ability to inhibit SERCA. R9C is a complete loss-of-function mutant of PLN, whereas R14del is a mild loss-of-function mutant. When combined with wild-type PLN to simulate heterozygous conditions, the mutants had a dominant negative effect on SERCA function. A series of targeted mutations in this region of the PLN cytoplasmic domain ((8)TRSAIRR(14)) demonstrated the importance of hydrophobic balance in proper PLN regulation of SERCA. We found that Arg(9) → Leu and Thr(8) → Cys substitutions mimicked the behavior of the R9C mutant, and an Arg(14) → Ala substitution mimicked the behavior of the R14del mutant. The results reveal that the change in hydrophobicity resulting from the R9C and R14del mutations is sufficient to explain the loss of function and persistent interaction with SERCA. Hydrophobic imbalance in the cytoplasmic domain of PLN appears to be a predictor for the development and progression of dilated cardiomyopathy."
https://openalex.org/W2042026122,"Iron is an essential nutrient for the proliferation of Staphylococcus aureus during bacterial infections. The iron-regulated surface determinant (Isd) system of S. aureus transports and metabolizes iron porphyrin (heme) captured from the host organism. Transportation of heme across the thick cell wall of this bacterium requires multiple relay points. The mechanism by which heme is physically transferred between Isd transporters is largely unknown because of the transient nature of the interactions involved. Herein, we show that the IsdC transporter not only passes heme ligand to another class of Isd transporter, as previously known, but can also perform self-transfer reactions. IsdA shows a similar ability. A genetically encoded photoreactive probe was used to survey the regions of IsdC involved in self-dimerization. We propose an updated model that explicitly considers self-transfer reactions to explain heme delivery across the cell wall. An analogous photo-cross-linking strategy was employed to map transient interactions between IsdC and IsdE transporters. These experiments identified a key structural element involved in the rapid and specific transfer of heme from IsdC to IsdE. The resulting structural model was validated with a chimeric version of the homologous transporter IsdA. Overall, our results show that the ultra-weak interactions between Isd transporters are governed by bona fide protein structural motifs."
https://openalex.org/W2026919551,"Sulforaphane (SFN) is an important cancer preventive agent derived from cruciferous vegetables. We show that SFN treatment suppresses normal human keratinocyte proliferation via a mechanism that involves increased expression of p21(Cip1). SFN treatment produces a concentration-dependent increase in p21(Cip1) promoter activity via a mechanism that involves stabilization of the p53 protein leading to increased p53 binding to the p21(Cip1) promoter p53 response elements. The proximal p21(Cip1) promoter GC-rich Sp1 factor binding elements are also required, as the SFN-dependent increase is lost when these sites are mutated. SFN treatment increases Sp1 binding to these elements, and the response is enhanced in the presence of exogenous Sp1 and reduced in the presence of ΔN-Sp3. CpG island methylation alters p21(Cip1) promoter activity some systems; however, expression in SFN-treated keratinocytes does not involve changes in proximal promoter methylation. The promoter is minimally methylated, and the methylation level is not altered by SFN treatment. This study indicates that SFN increases p21(Cip1) promoter transcription via a mechanism that involves SFN-dependent stabilization of p53 and increased p53 and Sp1 binding to their respective response elements in the p21(Cip1) promoter. These results are in marked contrast to the mechanisms observed in skin cancer cell lines and suggest that SFN may protect normal keratinocytes from damage while causing cancer cells to undergo apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2032276295,"ADP-ribosyltransferase Diphtheria toxinlike 1 [ARTD1; formerly called poly-ADP-ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1)] is a chromatin-associated enzyme involved in regulating metabolic homeostasis. The liver is at the core of glucose and lipid metabolism and is significantly affected by obesity and the metabolic syndrome. Here, we show that when fed a high-fat diet (HFD), mice lacking ARTD1 developed exacerbated hepatic steatosis. ARTD1–/– mice had a 19% higher liver weight than wild-type (WT) animals and exhibited a significantly increased serum concentration of cholesterol (38%) and impaired glucose tolerance. In addition, adipocyte function and size were significantly reduced in ARTD1–/– mice fed an HFD (7794 μm2 for WT and 5579 μm2 for ARTD1–/– mice). The significantly reduced adipogenic differentiation of adipose-derived stromal cells (ASCs) isolated from ARTD1–/–mice (28 vs. 11% Oil red O-positive cells in WT and ARTD1–/– ASCs, respectively) suggested that impaired adipogenesis as the underlying cause for this adipose tissue malfunction. This function of ARTD1 was specific for adipogenesis, since osteogenic differentiation was not affected by the ARTD1 deletion. In summary, we show that ARTD1–/– mice fed an HFD display impaired adipogenesis and show exacerbated hepatic steatosis, which can have important implications for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.—Erener, S., Mirsaidi, A., Hesse, M., Tiaden, A.

https://openalex.org/W2039433425,"Steroid hormones ecdysteroids regulate varieties of developmental processes in insects. Although the ecdysteroid titer can be increased experimentally with ease, its artificial reduction, although desirable, is very difficult to achieve. Here we characterized the ecdysteroid-inactivating enzyme ecdysteroid-22-oxidase (E22O) from the entomopathogenic fungus Nomuraea rileyi and used it to develop methods for reducing ecdysteroid titer and thereby controlling insect development. K(m) and K(cat) values of the purified E22O for oxidizing ecdysone were 4.4 μM and 8.4/s, respectively, indicating that E22O can inactivate ecdysone more efficiently than other ecdysteroid inactivating enzymes characterized so far. The cloned E22O cDNA encoded a FAD-dependent oxidoreductase. Injection of recombinant E22O into the silkworm Bombyx mori interfered with larval molting and metamorphosis. In the hemolymph of E22O-injected pupae, the titer of hormonally active 20-hydroxyecdysone decreased and concomitantly large amounts of inactive 22-dehydroecdysteroids accumulated. E22O injection also prevented molting of various other insects. In the larvae of the crambid moth Haritalodes basipunctalis, E22O injection induced a diapause-like developmental arrest, which, as in normal diapause, was broken by chilling. Transient expression of the E22O gene by in vivo lipofection effectively decreased the 20-hydroxyecdysone titer and blocked molting in B. mori. Transgenic expression of E22O in Drosophila melanogaster caused embryonic morphological defects, phenotypes of which were very similar to those of the ecdysteroid synthesis deficient mutants. Thus, as the first available simple but versatile tool for reducing the internal ecdysteroid titer, E22O could find use in controlling a broad range of ecdysteroid-associated developmental and physiological phenomena."
https://openalex.org/W2079627677,"We investigated the role of the ubiquitously expressed calpain 2 isoform in breast tumor cell growth, migration, signaling, and tumorigenesis. RNAi-mediated knockdown of the capn2 transcript was used to manipulate expression of the catalytic subunit of calpain 2 in the AC2M2 mouse mammary carcinoma cell line. Stable knockdown of capn2 correlated with reduced in vitro proliferation rates, soft agar colony formation efficiency, and migration rates, indicating roles for calpain 2 in mitogenesis, survival, and motogenesis. Biochemical analysis showed increased levels of protein phosphatase 2A and reduced levels of activated Akt in calpain 2-deficient cells, and this correlated with increased levels of the FoxO3a target gene product p27(Kip1), a key regulator of cell proliferation. Calpain 2 deficiency in the AC2M2 cells correlated with enhanced nuclear localization of FoxO3a, consistent with it being in a derepressed state capable of regulating transcriptional targets. Orthotopically engrafted calpain 2 knockdown AC2M2 cells generated tumors with reduced growth rates and enhanced in vivo expression of p27(Kip1). In summary, calpain 2 deficiency correlated with reduced Akt activity, increased protein phosphatase 2A levels, derepression of FoxO3a, and enhanced expression of the p27(Kip1) tumor suppressor. These observations argue that calpain 2 promotes tumor cell growth both in vitro and in vivo through the PI3K-Akt-FoxO-p27(Kip1) signaling cascade. Inhibition of calpain 2 might therefore provide therapeutic benefits in the treatment of cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2062957324,"Lrwd1, a protein containing a leucine-rich repeat and a WD40 repeat domain, interacts with the origin replication complex (ORC), a protein complex involved in both initiation of DNA replication and heterochromatin silencing. Lrwd1 and ORC are known to co-purify with repressive histone marks (trimethylated lysine 9 of histone H3 (H3K9me3) and trimethylated lysine 20 of histone H4 (H4K20me3)) and localize to pericentric heterochromatin. However, how the Lrwd1 is recruited to heterochromatin and the functional significance of the localization of Lrwd1 to the heterochromatin are not known. Here, we show that Lrwd1 preferentially binds to trimethylated repressive histone marks in vitro, which is dependent on an intact WD40 domain but independent of ORC proteins. The localization of Lrwd1 and Orc2 at pericentric heterochromatin in mouse cells is lost in cells lacking H3K9me3 but not in cells lacking H4K20me3. In addition, depletion of HP1α has little impact on the localization of Lrwd1 on pericentric heterochromatin. Finally, depletion of Lrwd1 and Orc2 in mouse cells leads to increased transcription of major satellite repeats. These results indicate that the Lrwd1 is recruited to pericentric heterochromatin through binding to H3K9me3 and that the association of Lrwd1 with pericentric heterochromatin is required for heterochromatin silencing and maintenance."
https://openalex.org/W2045094458,"Most glycosphingolipids are synthesized by the sequential addition of monosaccharides to glucosylceramide (GlcCer) in the lumen of the Golgi apparatus. Because GlcCer is synthesized on the cytoplasmic face of Golgi membranes, it must be flipped to the non-cytoplasmic face by a lipid flippase in order to nucleate glycosphingolipid synthesis. Halter et al. (Halter, D., Neumann, S., van Dijk, S. M., Wolthoorn, J., de Mazière, A. M., Vieira, O. V., Mattjus, P., Klumperman, J., van Meer, G., and Sprong, H. (2007) Pre- and post-Golgi translocation of glucosylceramide in glycosphingolipid synthesis. J. Cell Biol. 179, 101-115) proposed that this essential flipping step is accomplished via a complex trafficking itinerary; GlcCer is moved from the cytoplasmic face of the Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by FAPP2, a cytoplasmic lipid transfer protein, flipped across the ER membrane, then delivered to the lumen of the Golgi complex by vesicular transport. We now report biochemical reconstitution studies to analyze GlcCer flipping at the ER. Using proteoliposomes reconstituted from Triton X-100-solubilized rat liver ER membrane proteins, we demonstrate rapid (t(½) < 20 s), ATP-independent flip-flop of N-(6-((7-nitro-2-1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)amino)hexanoyl)-D-glucosyl-β1-1'-sphingosine, a fluorescent GlcCer analog. Further studies involving protein modification, biochemical fractionation, and analyses of flip-flop in proteoliposomes reconstituted with ER membrane proteins from yeast indicate that GlcCer translocation is facilitated by well characterized ER phospholipid flippases that remain to be identified at the molecular level. By reason of their abundance and membrane bending activity, we considered that the ER reticulons and the related Yop1 protein could function as phospholipid-GlcCer flippases. Direct tests showed that these proteins have no flippase activity."

https://openalex.org/W1970156132,"Cell division is controlled through cooperation of different kinases. Of these, polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) and p90 ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (RSK1) play key roles. Plk1 acts as a G(2)/M trigger, and RSK1 promotes G(1) progression. Although previous reports show that Plk1 is suppressed by RSK1 during meiosis in Xenopus oocytes, it is still not clear whether this is the case during mitosis or whether Plk1 counteracts the effects of RSK1. Few animal models are available for the study of controlled and transient cell cycle arrest. Here we show that encysted embryos (cysts) of the primitive crustacean Artemia are ideal for such research because they undergo complete cell cycle arrest when they enter diapause (a state of obligate dormancy). We found that Plk1 suppressed the activity of RSK1 during embryonic mitosis and that Plk1 was inhibited during embryonic diapause and mitotic arrest. In addition, studies on HeLa cells using Plk1 siRNA interference and overexpression showed that phosphorylation of RSK1 increased upon interference and decreased after overexpression, suggesting that Plk1 inhibits RSK1. Taken together, these findings provide insights into the regulation of Plk1 during cell division and Artemia diapause cyst formation and the correlation between the activity of Plk1 and RSK1."
https://openalex.org/W1991261537,"A signaling or S-helix has been identified as a conserved, up to 50-residue-long segment in diverse sensory proteins. It is present in all major bacterial lineages and in euryarchea and eukaryotes. A bioinformatic analysis shows that it connects upstream receiver and downstream output domains, e.g. in histidine kinases and bacterial adenylyl cyclases. The S-helix is modeled as a two-helical parallel coiled coil. It is predicted to prevent constitutive activation of the downstream signaling domains in the absence of ligand-binding. We identified an S-helix of about 25 residues in the adenylyl cyclase CyaG from Arthrospira maxima. Deletion of the 25 residue segment connecting the HAMP and catalytic domains in a chimera with the Escherichia coli Tsr receptor changed the response to serine from inhibition to stimulation. Further examination showed that a deletion of one to three heptads plus a presumed stutter, i.e. 1, 2, or 3 × 7 + 4 amino acids, is required and sufficient for signal reversion. It was not necessary that the deletions be continuous, as removal of separated heptads and presumed stutters also resulted in signal reversion. Furthermore, insertion of the above segments between the HAMP and cyclase catalytic domains similarly resulted in signal reversion. This indicates that the S-helix is an independent, segmented module capable to reverse the receptor signal. Because the S-helix is present in all kingdoms of life, e.g. in human retinal guanylyl cyclase, our findings may be significant for many sensory systems."

Later, the blood flow increases as β-cell differentiation occurs. We have previously reported that pO2 controls β-cell development in rats. Here, we checked that hypoxia inducible factor 1α (HIF1α) is essential for this control. First, we demonstrated that the effect of pO2 on β-cell differentiation in vitro was independent of epitheliomesenchymal interactions and that neither oxidative nor energetic stress occurred. Second, the effect of pO2 on pancreas development was shown to be conserved among species, since increasing pO2 to 21 vs. 3% also induced β-cell differentiation in mouse (7-fold, P< 0.001) and human fetal pancreas. Third, the effect of hypoxia was mediated by HIF1α, since the addition of an HIF1α inhibitor at 3% O2 increased the number of NGN3-expressing progenitors as compared to nontreated controls (9.2-fold, P<0.001). In contrast, when we stabilized HIF1α by deleting ex vivo the gene encoding pVHL in E13.5 pancreas from Vhl floxed mice, Ngn3 expression and β-cell development decreased in such Vhl-deleted pancreas compared to controls (2.5 fold, P<0.05, and 6.6-fold, P< 0.001, respectively).

Initial regulation of Hox expression is important to establish these overlapping transcription domains. The Cdx homeodomain factors have been proposed as Hox regulators, but their precise role and mechanism during this regulatory interaction remain unclear. In Xenopus embryos, HoxC8 transcripts begin to accumulate during mid/late gastrula. Cdx1 overexpression and knockdown lead to precocious or slower HoxC8 expression, respectively. The mouse HoxC8 early enhancer when introduced into Xenopus embryos recapitulates the endogenous XHoxC8 temporal expression pattern and shows the same responsiveness to Cdx1 regulation. Three pairs of conserved Cdx binding sites were identified within the HoxC8 early enhancer. We demonstrate that Cdx1 binds directly these responsive elements during embryogenesis, as part of the mechanism for the timely activation of HoxC8 expression.
