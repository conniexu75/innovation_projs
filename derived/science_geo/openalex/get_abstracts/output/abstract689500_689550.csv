https://openalex.org/W4214845634,"The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted both physical and mental health. This study aimed to understand whether exposure to green space buffered against stress and distress during the COVID-19 pandemic while taking into account significant stressors of the pandemic.We leveraged a cross-sectional survey on green space exposure and mental health among residents of Denver, CO that ran from November 2019 through January 2021. We measured objective green space as the average NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) from aerial imagery within 300m and 500m of the participant's residence. Perceived green space was measured through Likert scores on five questions about vegetation near the home that captured perceived abundance, visibility, access, usage, and quality of green space. We used generalized linear models to assess the relationship between each green space exposure variable and perceived stress (PSS-4), depression (CES-D-10), or anxiety (MMPI-2) adjusted for sociodemographic and COVID-19 impact variables.We found significantly higher depression scores for all covid periods compared to the ""before covid"" period, and significantly higher anxiety scores during the ""fall wave"" compared to earlier periods. Adjusted for sociodemographic and pandemic stressors, we found that spending a lot of time in green space (usage) was significantly associated with lower anxiety and depression. We also observed significantly lower depression scores associated with NDVI in both buffers (objective abundance) and significantly lower anxiety scores with perceived abundance of green space. There was some evidence of lower anxiety scores for people reporting having high quality green spaces near the home (quality). We did not observe significant associations for any green space metric and perceived stress after adjustment for confounding variables.Our work provides further evidence of mental health benefits associated with green space exposure during the COVID-19 pandemic even after adjustment for sociodemographic variables and significant pandemic-related stressors."

https://openalex.org/W4214678596,"Schools are experiencing an unprecedented mental health crisis, with teachers reporting high levels of stress and burnout, which has adverse consequences to their mental and physical health. Addressing mental and physical health problems and promoting wellbeing in educational settings is thus a global priority. This study investigated the feasibility and effectiveness of an 8-week Compassionate Mind Training program for Teachers (CMT-T) on indicators of psychological and physiological wellbeing.A pragmatic randomized controlled study with a stepped-wedge design was conducted in a sample of 155 public school teachers, who were randomized to CMT-T (n = 80) or a waitlist control group (WLC; n = 75). Participants completed self-report measures of psychological distress, burnout, overall and professional wellbeing, compassion and self-criticism at baseline, post-intervention, and 3-months follow-up. In a sub-sample (CMT-T, n = 51; WLC n = 36) resting heart-rate variability (HRV) was measured at baseline and post-intervention.CMT-T was feasible and effective. Compared to the WLC, the CMT-T group showed improvements in self-compassion, compassion to others, positive affect, and HRV as well as reductions in fears of compassion, anxiety and depression. WLC participants who received CMT-T revealed additional improvements in compassion for others and from others, and satisfaction with professional life, along with decreases in burnout and stress. Teachers scoring higher in self-criticism at baseline revealed greater improvements post CMT-T. At 3-month follow-up improvements were retained.CMT-T shows promise as a compassion-focused intervention for enhancing compassion, wellbeing and reducing psychophysiological distress in teachers, contributing to nurturing compassionate, prosocial and resilient educational environments. Given its favourable and sustainable effects on wellbeing and psychophysiological distress, and low cost to deliver, broader implementation and dissemination of CMT-T is encouraged."
https://openalex.org/W4214575794,"Agent-based models (ABMs) have become a common tool for estimating demand for hospital beds during the COVID-19 pandemic. A key parameter in these ABMs is the probability of hospitalization for agents with COVID-19. Many published COVID-19 ABMs use either single point or age-specific estimates of the probability of hospitalization for agents with COVID-19, omitting key factors: comorbidities and testing status (i.e., received vs. did not receive COVID-19 test). These omissions can inhibit interpretability, particularly by stakeholders seeking to use an ABM for transparent decision-making. We introduce a straightforward yet novel application of Bayes' theorem with inputs from aggregated hospital data to better incorporate these factors in an ABM. We update input parameters for a North Carolina COVID-19 ABM using this approach, demonstrate sensitivity to input data selections, and highlight the enhanced interpretability and accuracy of the method and the predictions. We propose that even in tumultuous scenarios with limited information like the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, straightforward approaches like this one with discrete, attainable inputs can improve ABMs to better support stakeholders."
https://openalex.org/W4214589987,"Although 3D cell culture models are considered to reflect the physiological microenvironment and exhibit high concordance with in vivo conditions, one disadvantage has been that cell proliferation is slower in 3D culture as compared to 2D culture. However, the signaling differences that lead to this slower proliferation are unclear. Here, we conducted a cell-based high-throughput screening study and identified novel small molecules that promote cell proliferation, particularly under 3D conditions. We found that one of these molecules, designated GA-017, increases the number and size of spheroids of various cell-types in both scaffold-based and scaffold-independent cultures. In addition, GA-017 also enhances the ex vivo formation of mouse intestinal organoids. Importantly, we demonstrate that GA-017 inhibits the serine/threonine protein kinases large tumor suppressor kinase 1/2, which phosphorylate Yes-associated protein and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif , key effectors of the growth- and proliferation-regulating Hippo signaling pathway. We showed that GA-017 facilitates the growth of spheroids and organoids by stabilizing and translocating Yes-associated protein and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif into the cell nucleus. Another chemical analog of GA-017 obtained in this screening also exhibited similar activities and functions. We conclude that experiments with these small molecule large tumor suppressor kinase inhibitors will contribute to further development of efficient 3D culture systems for the ex vivo expansion of spheroids and organoids."
https://openalex.org/W3158739288,"Racial disparity in academia is a widely acknowledged problem. The quantitative understanding of racial-based systemic inequalities is an important step towards a more equitable research system. However, because of the lack of robust information on authors' race, few large-scale analyses have been performed on this topic. Algorithmic approaches offer one solution, using known information about authors, such as their names, to infer their perceived race. As with any other algorithm, the process of racial inference can generate biases if it is not carefully considered. The goal of this article is to assess the extent to which algorithmic bias is introduced using different approaches for name-based racial inference. We use information from the U.S. Census and mortgage applications to infer the race of U.S. affiliated authors in the Web of Science. We estimate the effects of using given and family names, thresholds or continuous distributions, and imputation. Our results demonstrate that the validity of name-based inference varies by race/ethnicity and that threshold approaches underestimate Black authors and overestimate White authors. We conclude with recommendations to avoid potential biases. This article lays the foundation for more systematic and less-biased investigations into racial disparities in science."
https://openalex.org/W4214537646,"MicroRNA (miRNA) is a kind of noncoding RNA whose function involved in various biological processes in neuronal maturation and adipocyte cells, such as differentiation, proliferation, development, apoptosis, and metabolism. Herein, miRNA-Seq was used to identify miRNAs in the tail fat tissue of Hu sheep (short-fat-tailed) and Tibetan sheep (short-thin-tailed). In this study, 155 differentially expression miRNAs (DE miRNAs) were identified, including 78 up-regulated and 77 down-regulated. Among these DE miRNAs, 17 miRNAs were reported and related with lipid metabolism. MiRanda and RNAhybrid software were used to predict the target genes of DE miRNAs, obtaining the number of targeting relationships is 38553. Target genes were enriched by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). 742 terms and 302 single pathways are enriched, including lipid metabolic process, response to lipid, cellular lipid catabolic process, lipid catabolic process, cellular lipid metabolic process, inositol lipid-mediated signaling, calcium channel activity, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, ECM-receptor interaction, AMPK signaling pathway, Wnt signaling pathway and TGF-beta signaling pathway. Notably, miR-379-5p was associated with tail fat deposition of sheep. Dual-Luciferase reporter assays showed miR-379-5p and HOXC9 had targeted relationship. The result of RT-qPCR showed that the expression trend of miR-379-5p and HOXC9 was opposite. miR-379-5p was down-regulated and highly expressed in tail adipose tissue of Tibetan sheep. HOXC9 was highly expressed in adipose tissue of Hu sheep. These results could provide a meaningful theoretical basis for studying the molecular mechanisms of sheep tail adipogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W3130702445,"Many of our routines and activities are linked to our ability to move; be it commuting to work, shopping for groceries, or meeting friends. Yet, factors that limit the individuals' ability to fully realise their mobility needs will ultimately affect the opportunities they can have access to (e.g. cultural activities, professional interactions). One important aspect frequently overlooked in human mobility studies is how gender-centred issues can amplify other sources of mobility disadvantages (e.g. socioeconomic inequalities), unevenly affecting the pool of opportunities men and women have access to. In this work, we leverage on a combination of computational, statistical, and information-theoretical approaches to investigate the existence of systematic discrepancies in the mobility diversity (i.e. the diversity of travel destinations) of (1) men and women from different socioeconomic backgrounds, and (2) work and non-work travels. Our analysis is based on datasets containing multiple instances of large-scale, official, travel surveys carried out in three major metropolitan areas in South America: Medellín and Bogotá in Colombia, and São Paulo in Brazil. Our results indicate the presence of general discrepancies in the urban mobility diversities related to the gender and socioeconomic characteristics of the individuals. Lastly, this paper sheds new light on the possible origins of gender-level human mobility inequalities, contributing to the general understanding of disaggregated patterns in human mobility."
https://openalex.org/W4214505317,"Acute lesions are among the most important causes of death due to vascular lesions worldwide. However, there are no accurate genetic markers for Acute myocardial infarction (AMI). This project will use microarray integration analysis in bioinformatics analysis to find and validate relevant AMI gene markers.Five microarray gene expression datasets were downloaded through the GEO database. We identified 50 significant DEGs by comparing and analyzing gene expression between 92 AMI and 57 standard samples. The BioGPS database screened differentially expressed genes specific to the immune system. DEGs were mainly involved in immune-related biological processes based on Enrichment analysis. Eight hub genes and three-gene cluster modules were subsequently screened using Cytoscape and validated using Box plot's grouping comparison and ROC curves. Combined group comparison results and ROC curves analysis concluded that AQP9, IL1B, and IL1RN might be potential gene markers for the AMI process. We used the StarBase database to predict target miRNAs for eight essential genes. The expected results were used to screen and obtain target lncRNAs. Then Cytoscape was used to create CeRNA networks. By searching the literature in PubMed, we concluded that AQP9, IL1B, and IL1RN could be used as gene markers for AMI, while FSTL3-miR3303p-IL1B/IL1RN and ACSL4-miR5905p-IL1B could be used as RNA regulatory pathways affecting AMI disease progression.Our study identified three genes that may be potential genetic markers for AMI's early diagnosis and treatment. In addition, we suggest that FSTL3-miR-330-3p-IL1B/IL1RN and ACSL4-miR-590-5p-IL1B may be possible RNA regulatory pathways to control AMI disease progression."
https://openalex.org/W4214889873,"Angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) are a class of drugs approved for the treatment of several common conditions, such as hypertension and heart failure. Recently, regulatory agencies have started to identify possibly carcinogenic nitrosamines and azido compounds in a multitude of formulations of several ARBs, resulting in progressive recalls. Furthermore, data from several randomized controlled trials suggested that there is also a clinically increased risk of cancer and specifically lung cancer with ARBs; whereas other trials suggested no increased risk. The purpose of this analysis was to provide additional insight into the ARB-cancer link by examining whether there is a relationship between degree of cumulative exposure to ARBs and risk of cancer in randomized trials. Trial-level data from ARB Trialists Collaboration including 15 randomized controlled trials was extracted and entered into meta-regression analyses. The two co-primary outcomes were the relationship between cumulative exposure to ARBs and risk of all cancers combined and the relationship between cumulative exposure and risk of lung cancer. A total of 74,021 patients were randomized to an ARB resulting in a total cumulative exposure of 172,389 person-years of exposure to daily high dose (or equivalent). 61,197 patients were randomized to control. There was a highly significant correlation between the degree of cumulative exposure to ARBs and risk of all cancers combined (slope = 0.07 [95% CI 0.03 to 0.11], p<0.001), and also lung cancer (slope = 0.16 [95% CI 0.05 to 0.27], p = 0.003). Accordingly, in trials where the cumulative exposure was greater than 3 years of exposure to daily high dose, there was a statistically significant increase in risk of all cancers combined (I2 = 31.4%, RR 1.11 [95% CI 1.03 to 1.19], p = 0.006). There was a statistically significant increase in risk of lung cancers in trials where the cumulative exposure was greater than 2.5 years (I2 = 0%, RR 1.21 [95% CI 1.02 to 1.44], p = 0.03). In trials with lower cumulative exposure to ARBs, there was no increased risk of all cancers combined or lung cancer. Cumulative exposure-risk relationship with ARBs was independent of background angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor treatment or the type of control (i.e. placebo or non-placebo control). Since this is a trial-level analysis. the effects of patient characteristics such as age and smoking status could not be examined due to lack of patient-level data. In conclusion, this analysis, for the first time, reveals that risk of cancer with ARBs (and specifically lung cancer) increases with increasing cumulative exposure to these drugs. The excess risk of cancer with long-term ARB use has public health implications."
https://openalex.org/W4220925890,"Estimation of genetic diversity in rapeseed is important for sustainable breeding program to provide an option for the development of new breeding lines. The objective of this study was to elucidate the patterns of genetic diversity within and among different structural groups, and measure the extent of linkage disequilibrium (LD) of 383 globally distributed rapeseed germplasm using 8,502 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. We divided the germplasm collection into five subpopulations (P1 to P5) according to geographic and growth habit-related patterns. All subpopulations showed moderate genetic diversity (average H = 0.22 and I = 0.34). The pairwise Fst comparison revealed a great degree of divergence (Fst > 0.24) between most of the combinations. The rutabaga type showed highest divergence with spring and winter types. Higher divergence was also found between winter and spring types. Admixture model based structure analysis, principal component and neighbor-joining tree analysis placed all subpopulations into three distinct clusters. Admixed genotype constituted 29.24% of total genotypes, while remaining 70.76% belongs to identified clusters. Overall, mean linkage disequilibrium was 0.03 and it decayed to its half maximum within < 45 kb distance for whole genome. The LD decay was slower in C genome (< 93 kb); relative to the A genome (< 21 kb) which was confirmed by availability of larger haplotype blocks in C genome than A genome. The findings regarding LD pattern and population structure will help to utilize the collection as an important resource for association mapping efforts to identify genes useful in crop improvement as well as for selection of parents for hybrid breeding."
https://openalex.org/W4214626995,"Dengue virus (DENV) causes a major arthropod-borne viral disease, with 2.5 billion people living in risk areas. DENV consists in a 50 nm-diameter enveloped particle in which the surface proteins are arranged with icosahedral symmetry, while information about nucleocapsid (NC) structural organization is lacking. DENV NC is composed of the viral genome, a positive-sense single-stranded RNA, packaged by the capsid (C) protein. Here, we established the conditions for a reproducible in vitro assembly of DENV nucleocapsid-like particles (NCLPs) using recombinant DENVC. We analyzed NCLP formation in the absence or presence of oligonucleotides in solution using small angle X-ray scattering, Rayleigh light scattering as well as fluorescence anisotropy, and characterized particle structural properties using atomic force and transmission electron microscopy imaging. The experiments in solution comparing 2-, 5- and 25-mer oligonucleotides established that 2-mer is too small and 5-mer is sufficient for the formation of NCLPs. The assembly process was concentration-dependent and showed a saturation profile, with a stoichiometry of 1:1 (DENVC:oligonucleotide) molar ratio, suggesting an equilibrium involving DENVC dimer and an organized structure compatible with NCLPs. Imaging methods proved that the decrease in concentration to sub-nanomolar concentrations of DENVC allows the formation of regular spherical NCLPs after protein deposition on mica or carbon surfaces, in the presence as well as in the absence of oligonucleotides, in this latter case being surface driven. Altogether, the results suggest that in vitro assembly of DENV NCLPs depends on DENVC charge neutralization, which must be a very coordinated process to avoid unspecific aggregation. Our hypothesis is that a specific highly positive spot in DENVC α4-α4’ is the main DENVC-RNA binding site, which is required to be firstly neutralized to allow NC formation."
https://openalex.org/W4214651185,"Cytoskeletal microtubules (MTs) are nucleated from γ-tubulin ring complexes (γTuRCs) located at MT organizing centers (MTOCs), such as the centrosome. However, the exact regulatory mechanism of γTuRC assembly is not fully understood. Here, we showed that the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase c-Abl was associated with and phosphorylated γ-tubulin, the essential component of the γTuRC, mainly on the Y443 residue by in vivo (immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation) or in vitro (surface plasmon resonance) detection. We further demonstrated that phosphorylation deficiency significantly impaired γTuRC assembly, centrosome construction, and MT nucleation. c-Abl/Arg deletion and γ-tubulin Y443F mutation resulted in an abnormal morphology and compromised spindle function during mitosis, eventually causing uneven chromosome segregation. Our findings reveal that γTuRC assembly and nucleation function are regulated by Abl kinase-mediated γ-tubulin phosphorylation, revealing a fundamental mechanism that contributes to the maintenance of MT function."
https://openalex.org/W4214664629,"Understanding vaccine hesitancy is becoming increasingly important, especially after the global outbreak of COVID-19. The main goal of this study was to explore the differences in vaccination conspiracy beliefs between people with a university degree coming from different scientific fields-Social Sciences & Humanities (SH) and Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). The study was conducted on an online convenience sample of respondents with college and university degrees in Croatia (N = 577). The results revealed that respondents educated in SH proved to be more prone to vaccination conspiracy beliefs. The indirect effect through science literacy was confirmed, while this was not the case for the indirect effects through health beliefs (natural immunity beliefs) and trust in the healthcare system. However, all three variables were important direct predictors of vaccination conspiracy beliefs. Female gender and religiosity were positively correlated with vaccination conspiracy beliefs, while age was not a statistically significant predictor. The authors concluded by emphasizing the necessity of the more theoretically elaborated approaches to the study of the educational and other socio-demographic differences in vaccine hesitancy."
https://openalex.org/W4214671060,"Obesity has been indicated to be a risk factor of diverticulosis. However, plausible relationship remained controversial. This cross-sectional study elucidated the association between percentage of body fat and the risk of diverticulosis.The study was conducted at a single medical center in Taiwan from 2000-2016 which enrolled 5557 adults with age above 20 years old receiving a health examination including self-reported questionnaires, measurement of percentage of body fat (PBF), blood test and colonoscopy at the Tri-Service General Hospital (TSGH). Logistic regressions were used to analyze the association between PBF and diverticulosis. Further stratification of participants was based on age and gender and three extended models were established for multivariable adjustment.243 of 3141 males and 103 of 2416 females were diagnosed with having diverticulosis. After covariates adjustment, only participants in the highest quartile of PBF (Q4 ≥33.8%) showed significantly positive association with the risk diverticulosis (OR 2.089, p <0.001). In subgroup analysis, the odds ratio for having diverticulosis in females was significantly higher than in males. In addition, We found that the odds ratio of having diverticulosis was higher in the group older than 60 years old compared to the younger group (OR 1.052; p<0.001; OR 1.043; p<0.001).In conclusion, PBF was a potential risk factor of diverticulosis. Individuals with higher PBF exhibits increased risk of diverticulosis, especially in females. Furthermore, bioelectrical impedance analysis may create a simple, available and radiation-free way to assess the risk of diverticulosis."
https://openalex.org/W4214696139,"ADHD is one of the most prevalent mental health disorders among children and adolescents. Household socio-economic status (SES) in early childhood is inversely related to ADHD later in childhood or adolescence. We conducted a systematic review to examine psychological, social and behavioural factors that mediate these relationships (PROSPERO Registration number: CRD42020182832).We searched Medline, EMBASE, PsychINFo, and Web of Science from inception until May 2020. Both authors independently reviewed abstracts and identified papers for inclusion. We sought primary observational studies (cohort, cross-sectional and case control studies) of general population-based samples of children and adolescents aged 18 and under that investigated potential mediators of the relationships between SES and ADHD. Studies based upon non-general population-based samples, twins or biochemical/physiological changes were excluded. Direct and indirect effects derived from standard validated mediation analysis were extracted for potential mediators. We assessed risk of bias using a modified NIH tool and synthesised quantitative data without meta-analysis according to the (SWiM) protocol because of heterogeneity between included studies. Family adversity, paternal and maternal ADHD symptoms, Home Learning Environment, breastfeeding duration and a combined fine motor and language score at age 2 may lie on the SES-ADHD pathway. Evidence concerning the influence of maternal depression/anxiety and adverse parenting was inconsistent across studies. There was no evidence that mother's health-related behaviour, family characteristics, child's consumption of fizzy drinks or other developmental characteristics at birth/during infancy lie on the SES-ADHD pathway. Publication bias may have been introduced by our decision not to search grey literature, not to approach study authors and limit the search to the English language.Evidence for mediation of the SES-ADHD pathway in childhood/adolescence is under-researched. Maternal mental health, family adversity, parenting and health-related behaviours warrant further research based on longitudinal data and employing the most advanced mediation analysis methods."
https://openalex.org/W4214709347,"Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is a bone marrow cell produced hormone that functions in the intestine and kidney to regulate phosphate homeostasis. Increased serum FGF23 is a well-established predictor of mortality in renal disease, but recent findings linking increased levels to hepatic and cardiac diseases have suggested that other organs are sources of FGF23 or targets of its effects. The potential ability of the liver to produce FGF23 in response to hepatocellular injury was therefore examined. Very low levels of Fgf23 mRNA and FGF23 protein were detected in normal mouse liver, but the amounts increased markedly during acute liver injury from the hepatotoxin carbon tetrachloride. Serum levels of intact FGF23 were elevated during liver injury from carbon tetrachloride. Chronic liver injury induced by a high fat diet or elevated bile acids also increased hepatic FGF23 levels. Stimulation of toll-like receptor (TLR) 4-driven inflammation by gut-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS) underlies many forms of liver injury, and LPS induced Fgf23 in the liver as well as in other organs. The LPS-inducible cytokines IL-1β and TNF increased hepatic Fgf23 expression as did a TLR2 agonist Pam2CSK3. Analysis of Fgf23 expression and FGF23 secretion in different hepatic cell types involved in liver injury identified the resident liver macrophage or Kupffer cell as a source of hepatic FGF23. LPS and cytokines selectively induced the hormone in these cells but not in hepatocytes or hepatic stellate cells. FGF23 failed to exert any autocrine effect on the inflammatory state of Kupffer cells but did trigger proinflammatory activation of hepatocytes. During liver injury inflammatory factors induce Kupffer cell production of FGF23 that may have a paracrine proinflammatory effect on hepatocytes. Liver-produced FGF23 may have systemic hormonal effects as well that influence diseases in in other organs."
https://openalex.org/W4214842562,"Circular shell rings along the South Atlantic Coast of North America are the remnants of some of the earliest villages that emerged during the Late Archaic (5000–3000 BP). Many of these villages, however, were abandoned during the Terminal Late Archaic (ca 3800–3000 BP). We combine Bayesian chronological modeling with mollusk shell geochemistry and oyster paleobiology to understand the nature and timing of environmental change associated with the emergence and abandonment of circular shell ring villages on Sapelo Island, Georgia. Our Bayesian models indicate that Native Americans occupied the three Sapelo shell rings at varying times with some generational overlap. By the end of the complex’s occupation, only Ring III was occupied before abandonment ca. 3845 BP. Ring III also consists of statistically smaller oysters harvested from less saline estuaries compared to earlier occupations. Integrating shell biochemical and paleobiological data with recent tree ring analyses shows a clear pattern of environmental fluctuations throughout the period in which the rings were occupied. We argue that as the environment became unstable around 4300 BP, aggregation at villages provided a way to effectively manage fisheries that are highly sensitive to environmental change. However, with the eventual collapse of oyster fisheries and subsequent rebound in environmental conditions ca. post-3800 BP, people dispersed from shell rings, and shifted to non-marine subsistence economies and other types of settlements. This study provides the most comprehensive evidence for correlations between large-scale environmental change and societal transformations on the Georgia coast during the Late Archaic period."
https://openalex.org/W4214489749,"Background/Objectives Obesity is associated with an increased risk of noncommunicable diseases, such as diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke, cancers, and conditions, including obstructive sleep apnea and osteoarthritis. Obesity is largely preventable, and halting its rise is one of the World Health Organization Global Action Plan for the Prevention of Noncommunicable Diseases targets. This study aimed to assess trends of anthropometric measurements in Italy using the data collected within the CUORE Project health examination surveys (HESs) 1998, 2008, and 2018. Subjects/Methods Within the HESs 1998–2002, 2008–2012, and 2018–2019, anthropometric measurements were collected in random samples of the resident population aged 35–74 years, stratified by age and sex, from 10 Italian Regions in Northern, Central, and Southern Italy (2984 men and 2944 women, 2224 men and 2188 women, 1035 men and 1065 women, respectively). Weight, height, and waist and hip circumferences were measured using standardized methodologies. A standardized questionnaire was used to collect data on education. Indicators were age standardized. Results For both men and women, mean body mass index in 2018 was comparable with those in 1998 and 2008 (in 1998, 2008, and 2018—men: 26.7, 27.5, and 27.0 kg/m 2 ; women: 26.2, 26.6, and 26.3 kg/m 2 ). In 1998, 2008, 2018 prevalence of overweight resulted 49%, 47%, 46% in men and 33%, 32%, 28% in women respectively; prevalence of obesity resulted 17%, 24% 20% in men and 19%, 23%, 23% in women respectively. All indicators of excess weight worsen with increasing age and are more severe in persons with a lower educational level. Conclusions Although the overall trend of excess weight over the past two decades appeared to be substantially stable in the Italian adult population, the continuous strengthening of undertaken initiatives should continue since there remains a high proportion of overweight or obesity and a gap between educational levels."
https://openalex.org/W4214759058,"Intracranial germinoma (IG) rarely occurs in adults. Its optimal treatment strategy is unclear. We evaluated the outcomes of radiotherapy in adults with intracranial germinoma. Data of 29 adult patients (age, 18-52 years; median age, 24.3 years) with IG treated with radiotherapy at Taipei Veterans General Hospital were retrospectively reviewed. They were followed up for a median time of 5.9 years (range, 1.0-12.8 years). We used the Kaplan-Meier method to estimate the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), and univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models to identify the factors affecting PFS. PFS and OS were compared between adult and pediatric patients with IG. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year PFS rates were 96.6%, 85.8%, and 77.8%, respectively, in the adult patients, and the OS rate were all 100%. Seven patients (24.1%) experienced recurrence, and in six of them, salvage therapy successfully controlled the disease. Two patients (6.9%) died after 5 years of follow-up due to disease progression and central pontine myelinolysis. In the univariate and multivariate Cox analysis, bifocal lesions had a significantly lower PFS than those with single lesions (p = 0.008). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that adult patients had a poorer PFS (p = 0.06) and OS (p = 0.025) than pediatric patients. Our study showed bifocal lesions were associated with lower PFS than a single lesion among adult IG patients, and adult IG patients tended to have poorer PFS and OS compared to pediatric IG patients. For adult patients with bifocal IG, we recommend treatment with craniospinal irradiation, whole ventricle irradiation (WVI) with chemotherapy, or frequent spine images follow-up for patients who received only WVI."
https://openalex.org/W4214814747,"People living with a long-term condition, such as chronic kidney disease (CKD), often suffer from multiple symptoms simultaneously, making symptom management challenging. This study aimed to identify symptom clusters in adults with CKD across treatment groups and investigate their association with people's ability to perform their usual activities.We conducted a secondary analysis of both cross-sectional and longitudinal data collected as part of a national service improvement programme in 14 kidney centres in England, UK. This data included symptom severity (17 items, POS-S Renal) and the extent to which people had problems performing their usual activities (single item, EQ-5D-5L). We categorised data by treatment group: haemodialysis (n = 1,462), transplantation (n = 866), peritoneal dialysis (n = 127), or CKD without kidney replacement therapy (CKD non-KRT; n = 684). We used principal component analysis to identify symptom clusters per treatment group, and proportional odds models to assess the association between clusters and usual activities.Overall, clusters related to: lack of energy and mobility; gastrointestinal; skin; and mental health. Across groups, the 'lack of energy and mobility' clusters were associated with having problems with usual activities, with odds ratios (OR) ranging between 1.24 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.21-1.57) for haemodialysis and 1.56 for peritoneal dialysis (95% CI, 1.28-1.90). This association was confirmed longitudinally in haemodialysis (n = 399) and transplant (n = 249) subgroups.Our findings suggest that healthcare professionals should consider routinely assessing symptoms in the 'lack of energy & mobility' cluster in all people with CKD, regardless of whether they volunteer this information; not addressing these symptoms is likely to be related to them having problems with performing usual activities. Future studies should explore why symptoms within clusters commonly co-occur and how they interrelate.

However, evidence of their association with actual data fabrication and falsification is inconclusive. A recent case-controlled analysis of articles containing problematic image duplications suggested that country of affiliation of first and last authors is a significant predictor of scientific misconduct. The same analysis found null or negative associations with individual proxies of publication rate, impact and gender. The latter findings, in line with previous evidence, failed to support common hypotheses about the prevalence and causes of misconduct, but country-level effects may have confounded these results. Here we extend and complete previous results by comparing, via matched-controls analysis, articles from authors in the same country. We found that evidence for individual-level risk factors may be significant in some countries, and null or opposite in others. In particular, in countries where publications are rewarded with cash incentives, and especially China, the risk of problematic image duplication was higher for more productive, more frequently cited, earlier-career researchers working in lower-ranking institutions, in accordance with a ""misaligned incentives"" explanation for scientific misconduct. However, a null or opposite pattern was observed in all other countries, and especially the USA, UK and Canada, countries where concerns for misaligned incentives are commonly expressed. In line with previous results, we failed to observe a statistically significant association with industry funding and with gender. This is the first direct evidence of a link between publication performance and risk of misconduct and between university ranking and risk of misconduct. Commonly hypothesised individual risk factors for scientific misconduct, including career status and productivity, might be relevant in countries where cash-reward policies generate perverse incentives. In most scientifically active countries, however, where other incentives systems are in place, these patterns are not observed, and other risk factors might be more relevant. Policies to prevent and correct scientific misconduct may need to be tailored to a countries' or institutions' specific context."
https://openalex.org/W4214883521,"Governments around the world have implemented numerous policies in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This research examines the political issues resulting in public opinion concerning their responses to the pandemic via an international perspective. The objectives of this study are to: (1) measure the association and determine whether differences in political support can be attributed to the presence of approval ratings during the pandemic, and to (2) identify exceptional cases based on statistical predictions.We collect information from several open-sourced surveys conducted between June and September 2020 of public sentiment concerning governments' response toward COVID-19. The 11 countries in our sample account for over 50% of the world's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The study includes country-specific random effects to take into account the data's clustered structure. We consider ""political partisanship"" and ""pre-pandemic approval ratings in 2019"" as two potential explanatory variables and employ a mix-effect regression for bounded responses via variable transformation and the wild bootstrap resampling method.According to the wild bootstrap method, the mixed-effect regression explains 98% of the variation in approval ratings during the pandemic in September 2020. The findings reveal partisan polarization on COVID-19 policies in the U.S., with opposing supporters most likely to express negative sentiments toward the governing party.The evidence suggests that approval ratings during the pandemic correlate to differences in political support and pre-pandemic approval ratings, as measured by approval ratings from the views between governing coalition supporters and opponents."

The objectives of the present study were the isolation and genotypic characterization (16S rRNA) of new LAB isolates from Egyptian Laban Rayeb, Zabady and mothers' breast milk as potential probiotics. Strains were in vitro and in vivo evaluated for their safety and probiotic health promoting traits in Albino rats then applied into two types of functional dairy products. Three strains Streptococcus thermophilus MH422542, Enterococcus faecium MH422543 and Lactococcus lactis subsp lactis MH422545, were selected from a pool of 82 strains. St. thermophilus showed proteolytic activity and production of Exopolysaccharides (EPS). When evaluated in animal models; the strains showed hypolipidemic effects especially E. faecium that reduced atherogenic indices up to 88%. The strains modulated the gut microbiota by reducing Staphylococcus sp. and coliforms with no adverse effects either on blood parameters, antioxidant enzymes, cancer markers or hepatocytes histological examination. Only E. faecium MH422543 showed an immune response by increased white blood cells (WBC) while lymph and platelets values were not affected. The probiotic strains approved their convenience as starter/ adjunct cultures and enhanced organoleptic properties of the fermented dairy products."

The height of the alveolar bone and the thickness and area of the cortical, cancellous, and total alveolar bone were measured separately on each side of the mandibular central incisors.The thickness of the labial cortical bone from 6 mm below the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) to the root apex; the thickness of the labial cancellous bone at the root apex; the total thickness of the alveolar bone at the root apex; the area of labial cortical bone; the total area of labial alveolar bone; and the height of the labial alveolar bone were highest in the labial-inclination group (all P<0.05). All these variables were positively correlated with the labial inclination of the mandibular central incisors (all P<0.05). There were no statistical differences between the groups for any of the measurements on the lingual side of the teeth (P>0.05).The morphology of the alveolar bone on the labial but not the lingual side of the mandibular central incisors was statistically significantly correlated with the labial inclination of those teeth in patients with low-angle, skeletal class III malocclusion."

Here, we use microfluidics to align fibers of a collagen matrix and study the influence of fiber orientation on invasion from a cancer cell spheroid. The microfluidic setup allows for highly oriented collagen fibers of tangential and radial orientation with respect to the spheroid, which can be described by finite element simulations. In invasion experiments, we observe a strong bias of invasion towards radial as compared to tangential fiber orientation. Simulations of the invasive behavior with a Brownian diffusion model suggest complete blockage of migration perpendicularly to fibers allowing for migration exclusively along fibers. This slows invasion toward areas with tangentially oriented fibers down, but does not prevent it."

We investigated the significance of early venous thromboembolism (VTE) detection in patients with unresectable metastatic pancreatic cancer (UR-MPC) who received first-line chemotherapy with gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel (GnP).This single-center retrospective study enrolled 174 patients with UR-MPC who underwent GnP as a first-line chemotherapy from April 2017 to March 2020. The early detection of VTE (deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary thromboembolism) was defined as diagnosis by the first follow-up CT scan after the initiation of chemotherapy. We compared the patients with early detection of VTE (VTE (+) group) with the others (VTE (-) group). We examined overall survival (OS), progress free survival (PFS), severe adverse events, and predictors associated with OS using the Cox proportional hazards model.Early detection of VTE was observed in 17 patients (9.8%). Thirteen patients were diagnosed with VTE at treatment initiation, and four patients were diagnosed after treatment initiation. The median time to diagnosis after treatment initiation was 55 days (range: 31-71 days). Only 3 patients were symptomatic. The VTE (+) group exhibited worse OS and PFS than the VTE (-) group (OS: 259 days vs. 400 days, P < 0.001; PFS: 120 days vs. 162 days, P = 0.008). The frequency of grade 3-4 adverse events was not significantly different. Although the performance status was poorer in the VTE (+) group, VTE was identified as a statistically significant independent predictor for OS in multivariate analyses (HR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.02-3.44; P = 0.041).Early VTE detection is a predictor of a poor prognosis in UR-MPC patients who receive GnP as first-line chemotherapy, suggesting that screening VTE for patients with UR-MPC is crucial, even if patients are asymptomatic."
https://openalex.org/W4214731482,"The aim of this study was to determine how the depressor supercilii (DS) connects to the levator labii superioris alaeque nasi (LLSAN) and inferior fibers of the orbicularis oculi (OOc INF) in the human midface. While grimacing, contraction of the DS with fibers connecting to the LLSAN and OOc INF can assist in pulling the medial eyebrow downward more than when these connecting fibers are not present. Contraction of these distinct connecting fibers between the DS and the LLSAN can also slightly elevate the nasal ala and upper lip. The DS was examined in 44 specimens of embalmed adult Korean cadavers. We found that the DS connected to the LLSAN or the OOc INF by muscle fibers or thin aponeuroses in 33 (75.0%) of the 44 specimens. The DS was connected to both the LLSAN and OOc INF by muscle fibers or aponeuroses and had no connection to either in 5 (11.4%) and 11 (25.0%) specimens, respectively. The DS was connected to the LLSAN by the muscle fibers and thin aponeuroses in 6 (13.6%) and 4 (9.1%) specimens, respectively. The DS was connected to the OOc INF by the muscle fibers and thin aponeuroses in 5 (11.4%) and 23 (52.3%) specimens, respectively. Our findings regarding the anatomical connections of the glabellar region DS to the midface LLSAN and OOc INF provide insights on the dynamic balance between the brow depressors such as the DS and brow-elevating muscle and contribute to understanding the anatomical origins of individual variation in facial expressions. These results can also improve the safety, predictability, and aesthetics of treatments for the glabellar region with botulinum toxin type A and can be helpful when performing electromyography."
https://openalex.org/W4214831060,"Background Maternal exposure to oil pollution is an important public health concern. However, there is a dearth of literature on the effects of maternal exposure to oil pollution on maternal outcomes in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. This study was therefore designed to determine the effect of maternal exposure to oil pollution on maternal outcomes in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. Methods Prospective cohort study design involving 1720 pregnant women followed from pregnancy to delivery was conducted. The participants were 18–45 years old at a gestational age of less than 17 weeks, who attended randomly selected health facilities in the areas with high exposure and low exposure to oil pollution in the Niger Delta, Nigeria. Data were collected using an interviewer-administered questionnaire and review of medical records from April 2018 to April 2019. Multivariate log-binomial model was used to examine the effect of maternal exposure to oil pollution on the risk of adverse maternal outcomes adjusting for sociodemographic, maternal and lifestyle characteristics. Results A total of 1418 women completed the follow-up and were included in the analysis. Women in high exposure areas had a higher incidence of premature rupture of membrane (PROM), caesarean section (CS) and postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) compared to women in areas with low exposure to oil pollution. After adjusting for cofounders, women in high exposure areas also had a higher risk of PROM (ARR = 1.96; 95% CI: 1.24–3.10) and PPH (ARR = 2.12; 95% CI: 1.28–3.36) in Model I–III when compared to women in areas with low exposure to oil pollution. However, pregnancy-induced hypertension and CS had no association with maternal exposure area status to oil pollution. Conclusion Women in high exposure areas are at a higher risk of PROM and PPH. This calls for policies and intervention toward reducing maternal exposure to oil pollution in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria."
https://openalex.org/W4220797555,"High quality daily testing for the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 in workplace settings has become part of the standard and mandatory protection measures implemented widely in response to the current pandemic. Such tests are often limited to a small fraction of the attending personnel due to cost considerations, limited availability and processing capabilities and the often cumbersome requirements of the test itself. A maximally efficient use of such an important and frequently scarce resource is clearly required. We here present an optimal testing strategy which minimises the presence of pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic infected members of the population in a workplace setting, derived under a series of simplifying statistical assumptions. These assumptions however, retain many of the generalities of the problem and yield robust results, as verified through a number of numerical simulations. We show that reduction in overall infected-person-days, IPD, by significant percentages can be achieved, for fixed numbers of tests per day of 5% and 10% of the population, of 30% and 50% in the IPD numbers, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W4221019902,"Laminin N-terminus α31 (LaNt α31) is an alternative splice isoform derived from the laminin α3 gene. The LaNt α31 protein is enriched around the terminal duct lobular units in normal breast tissue. In the skin and cornea the protein influences epithelial cell migration and tissue remodelling. However, LaNt α31 has never been investigated in a tumour environment. Here we analysed LaNt α31 in invasive ductal carcinoma and determined its contribution to breast carcinoma invasion. LaNt α31 expression and distribution were analysed by immunohistochemistry in human breast tissue biopsy sections and tissue microarrays covering 232 breast cancer samples. This analysis revealed LaNt α31 to be upregulated in 56% of invasive ductal carcinoma specimens compared with matched normal tissue, and further increased in nodal metastasis compared with the tumour mass in 45% of samples. 65.8% of triple negative cases displayed medium to high LaNt α31 expression. To study LaNt α31 function, an adenoviral system was used to induce expression in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. 2D cell migration and invasion into collagen hydrogels were not significantly different between LaNt α31 overexpressing cells and control treated cells. However, LaNt α31 overexpression reduced the proliferation rate of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Moreover, LaNt α31 overexpressing MDA-MB-231 cells displayed a striking change in their mode of invasion into laminin-containing Matrigel; changing from multicellular streaming to individual cellular-invasion. In agreement with these results, 66.7% of the tumours with the highest LaNt α31 expression were non-cohesive. Together these findings indicate that breast cancer-associated changes in LaNt α31 expression could contribute to the processes involved in tumour invasion and may represent a new therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W4214659051,"Objectives To evaluate the incidence, etiologies, and clinical outcomes of secondary postpartum hemorrhage in a hospital with a high cesarean section rate and to compare the etiologies of secondary postpartum hemorrhage following cesarean delivery versus vaginal delivery. Materials and methods This retrospective study included 123 women with secondary postpartum hemorrhage who were treated at a tertiary-level hospital between January 2004 and June 2018. Descriptive statistics and the chi-square test were used for data analysis. Results The incidence of secondary postpartum hemorrhage was 0.21%. The median onset of bleeding was 12 days after delivery. Fifty-two percent of the deliveries were by cesarean section. The most common etiology of secondary postpartum hemorrhage was endometritis (67.5%), followed by retained placental tissue (21.1%). Women who delivered by cesarean section had a higher rate of endometritis (80.0% vs 53.4%) and a lower rate of retained placental tissue (10.8% vs. 32.8%) than those who delivered vaginally. Surgical intervention included uterine evacuation in 29.3% and hysterectomy in 8.1% of the patients. Five percent of women were treated by embolization. Conclusions Endometritis was the most common cause of secondary postpartum hemorrhage. Women who delivered by cesarean section were less likely to have retained placental tissue but were at higher risk for endometritis and uterine pseudoaneurysm than those who delivered vaginally."

Several urban specific studies conducted in Ethiopia showed varying prevalence of hypertension. The aim of this study was to determine prevalence of hypertension and to identify factors associated with hypertension in Hawassa city administration, Southern Ethiopia.A community-based cross sectional study was carried out in Hawassa city administration in 2017. A multi-stage sampling technique was used to select 612 study participants. Descriptive statistics was used to describe socio-demographic, behavioral and anthropometric variables. The economic status of household, 'wealth index', was constructed by running principal component analysis. Binary logistic regression analysis was performed to assess factors associated with hypertension at 95%CI.The overall prevalence of hypertension was 21.2% (95% CI: 18.1-24.7), (24.5% for urban and 14.7% for peri-urban). About two fifths of hypertension cases (42.3%) were newly diagnosed with elevated blood pressure during data collection. Age, occupation, wealth status, consuming vegetables and animal fat, usual mode of transport, body mass index (BMI), family history of hypertension and existence of diabetes were associated with presence of hypertension at 95%CI. The average diastolic blood pressure for urban was 2.18mmHg higher than that of peri-urban groups (p-0.01).More than one fifth of study participants had hypertension and about two fifths of hypertension cases were newly diagnosed. Health communication should be strengthened focusing on identified risk factors and attention should be given to early detect and tackle the effects of hypertension in resource limited setting."

The EFV plasma concentration at steady-state were determined using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography with a tandem quadruple mass spectrometer (LC-MS/MS). Thirteen CYP2B6 (329G>T, 341T>C, 444 G>T/C, 15582C>T, 516G>T, 548T>G, 637T>C, 785A>G, 18492C>T, 835G>C, 1459C>T and 21563C>T) and one CAR (540C>T) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped using real-time polymerase chain reaction. HIV drug resistance mutations were detected using an in-house genotypic assay. The EFV concentration of patients ranged from 4 ng/mL to 332697 ng/mL (median 2739.5 ng/mL, IQR 1878-4891.5 ng/mL). Overall, 22% patients had EFV concentrations beyond therapeutic range of 1000-4000 ng/mL (4.5%% < 1000 ng/mL and 31.7% > 4000 ng/mL). Five SNPs (15582C>T, 516G>T, 785A>G, 983T>C and 21563C>T) were associated with higher EFV plasma concentration while 18492C>T with lower EFV plasma concentration (p<0.05). Strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) was observed for 15582C>T, 516G>T, 785A>G, 18492C>T, 983T>C, 21563C>T, 1459C>T and CAR 540C>T. Sixteen haplotypes were observed and CTGCTTCC, CTGCTTCT, TTGCTTCT and CGACCCCT were associated with high EFV plasma concentration. In multivariate analysis, factors significantly associated with EFV plasma concentration included; the presence of skin rash (β = 1379, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 3216.9-3416.3; p < 0.039), T allele of CYP2B6 516G>T (β = 1868.9, 95% CI 3216.9-3416.3; p < 0.018), the C allele of CYP2B6 983T>C (β = 2638.3, 95% CI = 1348-3929; p < 0.0001), T allele of CYP2B6 21563C>T (β = 1737, 95% CI = 972.2-2681.9; p < 0.0001) and the presence of 5 to 7 numbers of SNPs per patient (β = 570, 95% CI = 362-778; p < 0.0001) and HIV viral load ≤1000 cells/mL (β = -4199.3, 95% CI = -7914.9 --483.6; p = 0.027). About 36.2% of the patients had EFV plasma concentrations beyond therapeutic window, posing high risk of treatment failure or toxicity.

https://openalex.org/W4220926246,"Providing Virtual Reality(VR) users with a 3D representation of their body complements the experience of immersion and presence in the virtual world with the experience of being physically located and more personally involved. A full-body avatar representation is known to induce a Sense of Embodiment (SoE) for this virtual body, which is associated with improvements in task performance, motivation and motor learning. Recent experimental research on embodiment provides useful guidelines, indicating the extent of discrepancy tolerated by users and, conversely, the limits and disruptive events that lead to a break in embodiment (BiE). Based on previous works on the limit of agency under movement distortion, this paper describes, studies and analyses the impact of a very common yet overlooked embodiment limitation linked to articular limits when performing a reaching movement. We demonstrate that perceiving the articular limit when fully extending the arm provides users with an additional internal proprioceptive feedback which, if not matched in the avatar's movement, leads to the disruptive realization of an incorrect posture mapping. This study complements previous works on self-contact and visuo-haptic conflicts and emphasizes the risk of disrupting the SoE when distorting users' movements or using a poorly-calibrated avatar."
https://openalex.org/W4221037776,"Norisoboldine (NOR), an alkaloid isolated from Radix Lindera, was previously reported to promote the differentiation of regulatory T cells (Treg cells), an important subtype of lymphocytes capable of controlling autoimmune diseases. The present study was performed to explore the mechanism of NOR in the view of cellular metabolism. A global metabolomic analysis indicated that NOR preferentially altered the fatty acid oxidation (FAO) pathway and elevated the content of related metabolites during Treg cell differentiation. The detection of oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and mRNA expression of FAO-related enzymes demonstrated that NOR promoted FAO in the early stage of Treg cell differentiation. Consistently, pharmacological or genetic inhibition of FAO markedly diminished the induction of NOR on Treg cell differentiation. Furthermore, NOR was shown to elevate the level of acetyl-CoA derived from FAO and acetylation of lysine 27 on histone 3 (H3K27) at the Foxp3 promoter and CNS2 regions. A knockdown of CPT1, the rate-limiting enzyme of FAO, weakened the promotion of NOR on the development, acetyl-CoA level, and acetylation of H3K27 of Treg cells in vitro and in the mice with collagen-induced arthritis, and attenuated the anti-arthritic effect of NOR. These findings demonstrate that NOR induces the development of Treg cells through promoting FAO, therefore, facilitating gene transcription of Foxp3 via acetyl-CoA-mediated H3K27 acetylation modification, and FAO might serve as a novel target to induce Treg cell development."
https://openalex.org/W4214514534,"The kinetics of growth and α-amylase production of a novel Candida wangnamkhiaoensis yeast strain were studied in single-stage steady-state continuous cultures. This was performed in a split-cylinder internal-loop airlift bioreactor, using a variety of carbon sources as fermentation substrates. Results showed that the steady-state yields of cell mass from carbohydrates were practically constant for the range of dilution rates assayed, equaling 0.535 ± 0.030, 0.456 ± 0.033, and 0.491 ± 0.035 g biomass/g carbohydrate, when glucose, maltose, and starch, respectively were used as carbon sources. No α-amylase activity was detected when glucose was used as the carbon source in the influent medium, indicating that α-amylase synthesis of C. wangnamkhiaoensis is catabolically repressed by glucose. Contrastingly, maltose and starch induce synthesis of α-amylase in C. wangnamkhiaoensis, with starch being the best α-amylase inducer. The highest α-amylase volumetric and specific activities (58400 ± 800 U/L and 16900 ± 200 U/g biomass, respectively), and productivities (14000 ± 200 U/L·h and 4050 ± 60 U/g biomass·h, respectively) were achieved at a dilution rate of 0.24 h-1 using starch as the carbon source. In conclusion, single-stage steady-state continuous culture in an airlift bioreactor represents a powerful tool, both for studying the regulatory mechanisms of α-amylase synthesis by C. wangnamkhiaoensis and for α-amylase production. Furthermore, results showed that C. wangnamkhiaoensis represents a potential yeast species for the biotechnological production of α-amylase, which can be used for the saccharification of starch. This offers an attractive renewable resource for the production of biofuels (particularly bioethanol), representing an alternative to fossil fuels with reduced cost of substrates."
https://openalex.org/W4214597939,"In Brugada syndrome, even within the same family where all affected individuals share the same mutation, phenotypic variation is prominent, with variable penetrance and expressivity, presenting different degrees of involvement. It is difficult to establish a direct correlation between genotype and phenotype to predict prognosis in complications and risk of sudden death. The factors that modulate this inter- and intra-familial phenotypic variability remain to be determined. With the intention of testing whether other genetic factors, in addition to the causal mutation in SCN5A, may have a modulating effect on the Brugada phenotype and the risk of sudden death, we have studied 8 families with a causal variant in SCN5A with at least two affected individuals, one of whom has suffered cardiac arrest or sudden death. Whole exome sequencing was performed looking for additional variants that modify the phenotype and allow us to predict a better or worse prognosis for the evolution of the disease. The results did not show any clear genetic modifier; nevertheless, highlight the possible implication of the cholesterol and fibrosis pathways, as well as the circadian rhythm, as possible modulators of Brugada syndrome phenotype."

The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of proline-based solution (PL-BS) on cell viability and the stemness of newly established canine adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (cAD-MSCs) under hypothermic conditions. Characterized cAD-MSCs were stored in 1, 10, and 100 mM PL-BS or NSS at 4°C for 6, 9, and 12 hours prior to an evaluation. The results demonstrated that storage in 1 mM PL-BS for 6 hours decreased cell apoptosis and proliferation ability, but improved cell viability and mitochondrial membrane potential. cAD-MSCs maintained their high expression of CD44 and CD90, but had a low expression of CD34 and MHC class II. Trilineage differentiation ability of cAD-MSCs was not affected by storage in 1 mM PL-BS. Gene expression analysis demonstrated that immunomodulatory genes, including IDO, HGF, PGE-2, and IL-6, were upregulated in cAD-MSCs stored in 1 mM PL-BS. In conclusion, PL-BS can be effectively applied for storing cAD-MSCs under hypothermic conditions. These findings provide a new solution for effective handling of cAD-MSCs which might be promising for clinical applications."
https://openalex.org/W4214675599,"Membrane contact sites are specialized areas where the membranes of two distinct organelles are physically connected and allow for the exchange of molecules and for signaling processes. Understanding the mechanisms whereby proteins localize to and function in these structures is of special interest; however, methods allowing for reconstitution of these contact sites are few and only based on synthetic membranes and recombinant proteins. Here, we devised a strategy to create in situ artificial contact sites between synthetic and endogenous organelle membranes. Liposomes functionalized with a peptide containing a two phenylalanines in an acidic tract (FFAT) motif were added to adherent cells whose plasma membrane was perforated. Confocal and super-resolution microscopy revealed that these liposomes associated with the endoplasmic reticulum via the specific interaction of the FFAT motif with endoplasmic reticulum-resident vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated proteins. This approach allowed for quantification of the attachment properties of peptides corresponding to FFAT motifs derived from distinct proteins and of a protein construct derived from steroidogenic acute regulatory protein-related lipid transfer domain-3. Collectively, these data indicate that the creation of in situ artificial contact sites represents an efficient approach for studying the membrane-tethering activity of proteins and for designing membrane contact site reconstitution assays in cellular contexts."
https://openalex.org/W4214711625,"Cistanche deserticola Ma (cistanche) is a traditional herb with a wide range of therapeutic properties. However, no evidence of cistanche’s effect on adipogenesis has been found. The effect of cistanche that promotes the adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes was proved by using MTT spectrophotometry, Nile Red staining, Oil Red O staining and transcriptome sequencing technology. The mRNA level of key transcription factors for adipogenesis such as PPAR, AP2 and LPL were examined by RT-PCR. The results showed that the intracellular lipid content in cistanche treated cells were notably increased when compared with the non-treated cells. Between the differentiation and cistanche treated groups, the expression of adipogenesis related genes such as grow hormone releasing hormone (Ghrp), BCL2/adenovirus E1B interacting protein 3 (Bnip3) and Gastric inhibitory polypeptide receptor (Gipr) were significantly increased. Our findings also verified that cistanche promoted adipogenesis, which was accompanied by up-regulated level of Bnip3 and PPAR. This study could uncover new signaling pathways involved in adipogenesis regulation."
https://openalex.org/W4214848992,"Tasmanian devil ( tde ) mice are deaf and exhibit circling behaviour. Sensory hair cells of mutants show disorganised hair bundles with abnormally thin stereocilia. The origin of this mutation is the insertion of a transgene which disrupts expression of the Grxcr1 (glutaredoxin cysteine rich 1) gene. We report here that Grxcr1 exons and transcript sequences are not affected by the transgene insertion in tde homozygous ( tde/tde ) mice. Furthermore, 5’RACE PCR experiments showed the presence of two different transcripts of the Grxcr1 gene, expressed in both tde/tde and in wild-type controls. However, quantitative analysis of Grxcr1 transcripts revealed a significantly decreased mRNA level in tde/tde mice. The key stereociliary proteins ESPN, MYO7A, EPS8 and PTPRQ were distributed in hair bundles of homozygous tde mutants in a similar pattern compared with control mice. We found that the abnormal morphology of the stereociliary bundle was associated with a reduction in the size and Ca 2+ -sensitivity of the mechanoelectrical transducer (MET) current. We propose that GRXCR1 is key for the normal growth of the stereociliary bundle prior to the onset of hearing, and in its absence hair cells are unable to mature into fully functional sensory receptors."

Methods This retrospective cohort study included all students admitted to nursing school at the School of Health Sciences (ESCS), Brazil, between 2009 and 2014, who were followed until May 2020. The first phase involved document analysis from the ESCS academic management system and Brazilian government agencies. In the second phase, a survey was conducted among the alumni. The social quota system criterion was public school attendance across all primary and secondary education levels. Results Of the 448 students included in the study, 178 (39.7%) were from the affirmative action and 270 (60.3%) from the regular path systems. Affirmative action students were older at the time of nursing school admission (p &lt; 0.001) and took longer to be admitted to the nursing school (p &lt; 0.001) after completing high school. There were no significant differences in the dropout rates and years to complete nursing school. In the second phase, 108 alumni answered the survey. No significant differences were found in their participation in the undergraduate scientific research program and university extension projects, attending residency programs, getting a master’s degree and doctoral degree, monthly income, teaching activity, joining public service through a government job competition process, participation in management activities in the private and public health sector, and degree of job satisfaction. Conclusion Our results revealed that affirmative action is a policy that contributes to the reduction of inequalities and guarantees the training of nursing professionals with a similar professional qualification received through affirmative action and regular path systems."
https://openalex.org/W4214925794,"This study examines journalists' language in their reporting and what their word choices reveal about their cognitive mindsets. Reporters on the campaign trail often cannot afford to engage in systematic information processing as they distill complex political situations under deadline pressures. Twitter's emphasis on speed and informal cultural milieu can further lead journalists to rely on heuristics and emotions. Drawing upon insights from theories of the mind, memory, and language, this study explores how cognitive biases are embodied in journalistic work across different media. We built a large-scale dataset of text corpora that consisted of more than 220,000 news articles, broadcast transcripts, and tweets generated over a year by 73 campaign reporters in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Leveraging this unique dataset of journalistic outputs from a campaign season, we conducted automated text analyses. Results suggest that heuristics and intuitive thinking played a significant role in the generation of content on Twitter. Journalists infused their tweets with more emotion, compared to when they appeared in traditional media such as newspapers and broadcasts. Journalists' tweets contained fewer words related to analytical and long-term thinking than their writing. Journalists also used informal language in their tweets to connect with their audiences in more personal and casual manners. Across all media examined in the study, journalists described the current race by drawing upon their experience of covering prior presidential elections, a form of anchoring heuristic. This study extends the use of cognitive biases in politics to a new realm, reporting, and shows how journalists' use of language on the campaign trail reflects cognitive biases that arise when individuals make decisions under time pressure and uncertainty."
https://openalex.org/W4226083861,"Cellular reprogramming through targeting microRNAs (miRNAs) holds promise for regenerative therapy due to their profound regulatory effects in proliferation, differentiation, and function. We hypothesized that transdifferentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) into endothelial cells (ECs) using a miRNA cassette may provide a novel approach for use in vascular disease states associated with endothelial injury or dysfunction. miRNA profiling of SMCs and ECs and iterative combinatorial miRNA transfections of human coronary SMCs revealed a 4-miRNA cassette consisting of miR-143-3p and miR-145-5p inhibitors and miR-146a-5p and miR-181b-5p mimics that efficiently produced induced endothelial cells (iECs). Transcriptome profiling, protein expression, and functional studies demonstrated that iECs exhibit high similarity to ECs. Injected iECs restored blood flow recovery even faster than conventional ECs in a murine hindlimb ischemia model. This study demonstrates that a 4-miRNA cassette is sufficient to reprogram SMCs into ECs and shows promise as a novel regenerative strategy for endothelial repair."
https://openalex.org/W4214529438,"The earth anchor method is used to prevent landslides, and repair and reinforce cut or steep slopes due to its benefits of ease of construction and economic feasibility. However, the loss of anchor force has become a problem, which may cause failure and collapse of slopes when the anchor force drops below the design anchor force. While numerous studies have been conducted to solve this problem, measuring the residual tensile force of existing earth anchors remains a challenge, as prior studies required sensors to be installed inside structural members at the time of construction. Therefore, to address this limitation, an experiment was performed in this study to develop an elasto-magnetic (EM) sensor for measuring tensile force based on the EM effect, which could be installed on externally exposed anchor heads. The commercial software ANSYS Maxwell was used to analyze the optimal sensor design for the experiment. Additionally, a series of tests to measure the tensile force was conducted by fabricating the sensor based on the numerical analysis results. The area of B-H curves measured by developed EM sensor was increased according to the decrease of tensile force. Also, The tensile force estimation equation was derived and verified using measured data. According to the results, the proposed method can be one of the solution for measuring residual tensile force of earth anchor."
https://openalex.org/W4214555917,"Replication stress impedes DNA polymerase progression causing activation of the ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related signaling pathway, which promotes the intra-S phase checkpoint activity through phosphorylation of checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1). Chk1 suppresses replication origin firing, in part, by disrupting the interaction between the preinitiation complex components Treslin and TopBP1, an interaction that is mediated by TopBP1 BRCT domain-binding to two cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) phosphorylation sites, T968 and S1000, in Treslin. Two nonexclusive models for how Chk1 regulates the Treslin-TopBP1 interaction have been proposed in the literature: in one model, these proteins dissociate due to a Chk1-induced decrease in CDK activity that reduces phosphorylation of the Treslin sites that bind TopBP1 and in the second model, Chk1 directly phosphorylates Treslin, resulting in dissociation of TopBP1. However, these models have not been formally examined. We show here that Treslin T968 phosphorylation was decreased in a Chk1-dependent manner, while Treslin S1000 phosphorylation was unchanged, demonstrating that T968 and S1000 are differentially regulated. However, CDK2-mediated phosphorylation alone did not fully account for Chk1 regulation of the Treslin-TopBP1 interaction. We also identified additional Chk1 phosphorylation sites on Treslin that contributed to disruption of the Treslin-TopBP1 interaction, including S1114. Finally, we showed that both of the proposed mechanisms regulate origin firing in cancer cell line models undergoing replication stress, with the relative roles of each mechanism varying among cell lines. This study demonstrates that Chk1 regulates Treslin through multiple mechanisms to promote efficient dissociation of Treslin and TopBP1 and furthers our understanding of Treslin regulation during the intra-S phase checkpoint."
https://openalex.org/W4214582143,"The aim of this study was to describe the morphology of the cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) in detail and introduce a comprehensive scheme to describe the topology of this region based on functional considerations. This may lead to a better understanding of isthmus-dependent flutter and fibrillation and to improved intervention strategies. We used images of the cavotricuspid isthmus from 52 rabbits of both sexes with a median weight of 3.40 ± 0.93 kg. The area of the CTI was 124.25 ± 42.14 mm 2 with 53.28 ± 21.13 mm 2 covered by pectinate muscles connecting the terminal crest and the vestibule. Isthmus length decreased from inferolateral (13.09 ±2.14 mm) to central (9.85 ± 2.14 mm) to paraseptal (4.88 ± 1.96 mm) resembling the overall human geometry. Ramification sites of pectinate muscles were identified and six levels dividing the CTI from posterior to anterior were introduced. This allowed the classification of pectinate muscle segments based on the connected ramification level. To account for the high inter-individual variations in size and shape, the CTI was projected onto a normalized reference frame using bilinear transformation. Furthermore, two measures of complexity were introduced: (i) the ramification index, which reflects the total number of muscle segments connected to a ramification site and (ii) the complexity index, which reflects the type of ramification (branching or merging site). Topological analysis showed that the complexity of the pectinate muscle network decreases from inferolateral to paraseptal and that the number of electrically uncoupled parallel pathways increases in the central section between the terminal crest and the vestibule which introduces potential reentry pathways."
https://openalex.org/W4214774026,"Brief Contact Interventions (BCIs) after a suicide attempt (SA) are an important element of prevention against SA and suicide. VigilanS generalizes to a whole French region a BCI combining resource cards, telephone calls and sending postcards, according to a predefined algorithm. However, a major obstacle to such real-life intervention is the loss of contact during follow-up. Here, we analyze the occurrence of loss of follow-up (LFU) and compare characteristics of patients LFU with follow-up completers.The study concerned patients included in VigilanS over the period from 1st January 2015 to 31 December 2018, with an end of follow-up on 1st July 2019. We performed a series of descriptive analysis and logistic regressions. The outcome was the loss to follow-up, relative to the 6th month call marking the end of the follow-up; the predictive variables were the characteristics of the patient at entry and during follow-up. Age and sex were considered as adjustment variables.11879 inclusions occurred during the study period, corresponding to 10666 different patients. The mean age was 40.6 ± 15 years. More than a third were non-first suicide attempters (46.6%) and the most frequent means of suicide was by voluntary drug intoxication (83.2%). 8335 patients were LFU. After simple and multiple regression, a significant relationship with loss to follow-up was identified among non-first suicide attempters, alcohol consumers, patients having no companion on arrival at the emergency room, patients who didn't make or receive any calls. An increased stay in hospital after a SA was a protective factor against loss of follow-up.A majority of patients were lost to follow-up by the expected surveillance time of 6 months. Characteristics of lost patients will help focusing efforts to improve retention in the VigilanS program and might give insights for BCI implemented elsewhere."
https://openalex.org/W4214915857,"The loss of functional cells through immunological rejection after transplantation reduces the efficacy of regenerative therapies for cardiac failure that use allogeneic induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs). Recently, mixed-chimera mice with donor-specific immunotolerance have been established using the RGI-2001 (liposomal formulation of α-galactosyl ceramide) ligand, which activates invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells. The present study aimed to investigate whether mixed chimerism, established using RGI-2001, prolongs graft survival in allogeneic iPSC-CM transplantation. Mixed-chimera mice were established via combinatorial treatment with RGI-2001 and anti-CD154 antibodies in an irradiated murine bone marrow transplant model. Luciferase-expressing allogeneic iPSC-CMs were transplanted into mixed-chimera and untreated mice, followed by in vivo imaging. RGI-2001 enhanced iNKT cell activation in mice, and mixed chimerism was successfully established. In vivo imaging revealed that while the allografts were completely obliterated within 2 weeks when transplanted to untreated mice, their survivals were not affected in the mixed-chimera mice. Furthermore, numerous CD3+ cells infiltrated allografts in untreated mice, but fewer CD3+ cells were present in mixed-chimera mice. We conclude that mixed-chimera mice established using RGI-2001 showed prolonged graft survival after allogeneic iPSC-CM transplantation. This donor-specific immunotolerance might increase the efficacy of regenerative therapies for heart failure with allogeneic iPSC-CMs."
