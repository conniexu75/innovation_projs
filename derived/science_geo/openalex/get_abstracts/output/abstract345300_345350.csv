This information is now being augmented by satellite data. Clouds permitting, satellite scanner systems can locate major ocean frontal boundaries if they are associated with even quite weak horizontal sea-surface temperature gradients. The satellite data are most usefully interpreted in a region such as that encompassing the California Current, where the surface and main thermocline temperature distributions bear some relation to each other. In such a region, it is possible to make interpretations of circulation based on satellite-derived sea-surface temperature patterns. The correctness of these interpretations depends heavily on the availability of historical and present-day subsurface data, collected by conventional methods from ships and aircraft. Satellite infrared scanners, in addition to providing information on circulation with vastly increased spatial resolution, have the potential (with cooperative weather) for providing increased time resolution. These improvements in resolution have permitted us to see that much of the spatial variation in the California Current takes place along welldefined fronts and to observe the evolution of one particular meander."

https://openalex.org/W1998024480,"It-is possible to use radioiron as an indicator of altered hematopoiesis, as shown in Fig. 2. Suspensions of marrow from patients with untreated pernicious anemia have repeatedly shown an acceleration of the rate of iron uptake after the addition of liver or folic acid as compared with control studies. This has not occurred in conditions other than those characterized by specific deficiencies of the substances used. These observations on the marrow cells in untreated pernicious anemia indicate that these effective therapeutic agents act directly on the immature erythrocytes."

Buchanan, International Minerals & Chemical Corporation, Chicago, informs me that the monosodium glutamate upon which this study was made is the l-form and should be designated as sodium-l-glutamate, being the monohydrate with the following empirical formula: C(5)H(8)O(4)NNa .
