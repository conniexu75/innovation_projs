https://openalex.org/W4283689033,"Abstract Thermal insulation under extreme conditions requires materials that can withstand complex thermomechanical stress and retain excellent thermal insulation properties at temperatures exceeding 1,000 degrees Celsius 1–3 . Ceramic aerogels are attractive thermal insulating materials; however, at very high temperatures, they often show considerably increased thermal conductivity and limited thermomechanical stability that can lead to catastrophic failure 4–6 . Here we report a multiscale design of hypocrystalline zircon nanofibrous aerogels with a zig-zag architecture that leads to exceptional thermomechanical stability and ultralow thermal conductivity at high temperatures. The aerogels show a near-zero Poisson’s ratio (3.3 × 10 −4 ) and a near-zero thermal expansion coefficient (1.2 × 10 −7 per degree Celsius), which ensures excellent structural flexibility and thermomechanical properties. They show high thermal stability with ultralow strength degradation (less than 1 per cent) after sharp thermal shocks, and a high working temperature (up to 1,300 degrees Celsius). By deliberately entrapping residue carbon species in the constituent hypocrystalline zircon fibres, we substantially reduce the thermal radiation heat transfer and achieve one of the lowest high-temperature thermal conductivities among ceramic aerogels so far—104 milliwatts per metre per kelvin at 1,000 degrees Celsius. The combined thermomechanical and thermal insulating properties offer an attractive material system for robust thermal insulation under extreme conditions."
https://openalex.org/W4283744632,"Abstract Aggressive and metastatic cancers show enhanced metabolic plasticity 1 , but the precise underlying mechanisms of this remain unclear. Here we show how two NOP2/Sun RNA methyltransferase 3 (NSUN3)-dependent RNA modifications—5-methylcytosine (m 5 C) and its derivative 5-formylcytosine (f 5 C) (refs. 2–4 )—drive the translation of mitochondrial mRNA to power metastasis. Translation of mitochondrially encoded subunits of the oxidative phosphorylation complex depends on the formation of m 5 C at position 34 in mitochondrial tRNA Met . m 5 C-deficient human oral cancer cells exhibit increased levels of glycolysis and changes in their mitochondrial function that do not affect cell viability or primary tumour growth in vivo; however, metabolic plasticity is severely impaired as mitochondrial m 5 C-deficient tumours do not metastasize efficiently. We discovered that CD36-dependent non-dividing, metastasis-initiating tumour cells require mitochondrial m 5 C to activate invasion and dissemination. Moreover, a mitochondria-driven gene signature in patients with head and neck cancer is predictive for metastasis and disease progression. Finally, we confirm that this metabolic switch that allows the metastasis of tumour cells can be pharmacologically targeted through the inhibition of mitochondrial mRNA translation in vivo. Together, our results reveal that site-specific mitochondrial RNA modifications could be therapeutic targets to combat metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W4283691610,"Extreme weather conditions associated with climate change affect many aspects of plant and animal life, including the response to infectious diseases. Production of salicylic acid (SA), a central plant defence hormone1-3, is particularly vulnerable to suppression by short periods of hot weather above the normal plant growth temperature range via an unknown mechanism4-7. Here we show that suppression of SA production in Arabidopsis thaliana at 28 °C is independent of PHYTOCHROME B8,9 (phyB) and EARLY FLOWERING 310 (ELF3), which regulate thermo-responsive plant growth and development. Instead, we found that formation of GUANYLATE BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE 3 (GBPL3) defence-activated biomolecular condensates11 (GDACs) was reduced at the higher growth temperature. The altered GDAC formation in vivo is linked to impaired recruitment of GBPL3 and SA-associated Mediator subunits to the promoters of CBP60g and SARD1, which encode master immune transcription factors. Unlike many other SA signalling components, including the SA receptor and biosynthetic genes, optimized CBP60g expression was sufficient to broadly restore SA production, basal immunity and effector-triggered immunity at the elevated growth temperature without significant growth trade-offs. CBP60g family transcription factors are widely conserved in plants12. These results have implications for safeguarding the plant immune system as well as understanding the concept of the plant-pathogen-environment disease triangle and the emergence of new disease epidemics in a warming climate."

https://openalex.org/W4283707560,"Enteric viruses like norovirus, rotavirus and astrovirus have long been accepted as spreading in the population through fecal-oral transmission: viruses are shed into feces from one host and enter the oral cavity of another, bypassing salivary glands (SGs) and reaching the intestines to replicate, be shed in feces and repeat the transmission cycle1. Yet there are viruses (for example, rabies) that infect the SGs2,3, making the oral cavity one site of replication and saliva one conduit of transmission. Here we report that enteric viruses productively and persistently infect SGs, reaching titres comparable to those in the intestines. We demonstrate that enteric viruses get released into the saliva, identifying a second route of viral transmission. This is particularly significant for infected infants, whose saliva directly transmits enteric viruses to their mothers' mammary glands through backflow during suckling. This sidesteps the conventional gut-mammary axis route4 and leads to a rapid surge in maternal milk secretory IgA antibodies5,6. Lastly, we show that SG-derived spheroids7 and cell lines8 can replicate and propagate enteric viruses, generating a scalable and manageable system of production. Collectively, our research uncovers a new transmission route for enteric viruses with implications for therapeutics, diagnostics and importantly sanitation measures to prevent spread through saliva."

https://openalex.org/W4283746104,"Abstract Peroxisomes are ubiquitous organelles that house various metabolic reactions and are essential for human health 1–4 . Luminal peroxisomal proteins are imported from the cytosol by mobile receptors, which then recycle back to the cytosol by a poorly understood process 1–4 . Recycling requires receptor modification by a membrane-embedded ubiquitin ligase complex comprising three RING finger domain-containing proteins (Pex2, Pex10 and Pex12) 5,6 . Here we report a cryo-electron microscopy structure of the ligase complex, which together with biochemical and in vivo experiments reveals its function as a retrotranslocation channel for peroxisomal import receptors. Each subunit of the complex contributes five transmembrane segments that co-assemble into an open channel. The three ring finger domains form a cytosolic tower, with ring finger 2 (RF2) positioned above the channel pore. We propose that the N terminus of a recycling receptor is inserted from the peroxisomal lumen into the pore and monoubiquitylated by RF2 to enable extraction into the cytosol. If recycling is compromised, receptors are polyubiquitylated by the concerted action of RF10 and RF12 and degraded. This polyubiquitylation pathway also maintains the homeostasis of other peroxisomal import factors. Our results clarify a crucial step during peroxisomal protein import and reveal why mutations in the ligase complex cause human disease."
https://openalex.org/W4283741730,"Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are the key components for RNA interference (RNAi), a conserved RNA-silencing mechanism in many eukaryotes1,2. In Drosophila, an RNase III enzyme Dicer-2 (Dcr-2), aided by its cofactor Loquacious-PD (Loqs-PD), has an important role in generating 21 bp siRNA duplexes from long double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs)3,4. ATP hydrolysis by the helicase domain of Dcr-2 is critical to the successful processing of a long dsRNA into consecutive siRNA duplexes5,6. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structures of Dcr-2-Loqs-PD in the apo state and in multiple states in which it is processing a 50 bp dsRNA substrate. The structures elucidated interactions between Dcr-2 and Loqs-PD, and substantial conformational changes of Dcr-2 during a dsRNA-processing cycle. The N-terminal helicase and domain of unknown function 283 (DUF283) domains undergo conformational changes after initial dsRNA binding, forming an ATP-binding pocket and a 5'-phosphate-binding pocket. The overall conformation of Dcr-2-Loqs-PD is relatively rigid during translocating along the dsRNA in the presence of ATP, whereas the interactions between the DUF283 and RIIIDb domains prevent non-specific cleavage during translocation by blocking the access of dsRNA to the RNase active centre. Additional ATP-dependent conformational changes are required to form an active dicing state and precisely cleave the dsRNA into a 21 bp siRNA duplex as confirmed by the structure in the post-dicing state. Collectively, this study revealed the molecular mechanism for the full cycle of ATP-dependent dsRNA processing by Dcr-2-Loqs-PD."
https://openalex.org/W4283738543,"Abstract Perching at speed is among the most demanding flight behaviours that birds perform 1,2 and is beyond the capability of most autonomous vehicles. Smaller birds may touch down by hovering 3–8 , but larger birds typically swoop up to perch 1,2 —presumably because the adverse scaling of their power margin prohibits hovering 9 and because swooping upwards transfers kinetic to potential energy before collision 1,2,10 . Perching demands precise control of velocity and pose 11–14 , particularly in larger birds for which scale effects make collisions especially hazardous 6,15 . However, whereas cruising behaviours such as migration and commuting typically minimize the cost of transport or time of flight 16 , the optimization of such unsteady flight manoeuvres remains largely unexplored 7,17 . Here we show that the swooping trajectories of perching Harris’ hawks ( Parabuteo unicinctus ) minimize neither time nor energy alone, but rather minimize the distance flown after stalling. By combining motion capture data from 1,576 flights with flight dynamics modelling, we find that the birds’ choice of where to transition from powered dive to unpowered climb minimizes the distance over which high lift coefficients are required. Time and energy are therefore invested to provide the control authority needed to glide safely to the perch, rather than being minimized directly as in technical implementations of autonomous perching under nonlinear feedback control 12 and deep reinforcement learning 18,19 . Naive birds learn this behaviour on the fly, so our findings suggest a heuristic principle that could guide reinforcement learning of autonomous perching."
https://openalex.org/W4283725000,"Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) developed for point of care detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigen are recommended by WHO to use trained health care workers to collect samples. We hypothesised that self-taken samples are non-inferior for use with RDTs to diagnose COVID-19. We designed a prospective diagnostic evaluation comparing self-taken and healthcare worker (HCW)-taken throat/nasal swabs to perform RDTs for SARS-CoV-2, and how these compare to RT-PCR.Eligible participants 18 years or older with symptoms of COVID-19. 250 participants recruited at the NHS Test and Trace drive-through community PCR testing site (Liverpool, UK); one withdrew before analysis. Self-administered throat/nasal swab for the Covios® RDT, a trained HCW taken throat/nasal sample for PCR and HCW comparison throat/nasal swab for RDT were collected. RDT results were compared to RT-PCR, as the reference standard, to calculate sensitivity and specificity.Seventy-five participants (75/249, 30.1%) were positive by RT-PCR. RDTs with self-taken swabs had a sensitivity of 90.5% (67/74, 95% CI: 83.9-97.2), compared to 78.4% (58/74, 95% CI: 69.0-87.8) for HCW-taken swabs (absolute difference 12.2%, 95% CI: 4.7-19.6, p = 0.003). Specificity for self-taken swabs was 99.4% (173/174, 95% CI: 98.3-100.0), versus 98.9% (172/174, 95% CI: 97.3-100.0) for HCW-taken swabs (absolute difference 0.6%, 95% CI: 0.5-1.7, p = 0.317). The PPV of self-taken RDTs (98.5%, 67/68, 95% CI: 95.7-100.0) and HCW-taken RDTs (96.7%, 58/60, 95% CI 92.1-100.0) were not significantly different (p = 0.262). However, the NPV of self-taken swab RDTs was significantly higher (96.1%, 173/180, 95% CI: 93.2-98.9) than HCW-taken RDTs (91.5%, 172/188, 95% CI 87.5-95.5, p = 0.003).In conclusion, self-taken swabs for COVID-19 testing offer an accurate alternative to healthcare worker taken swabs for use with RDTs. Our results demonstrate that, with no training, self-taken throat/nasal samples can be used by lay individuals as part of rapid testing programmes for symptomatic adults. This is especially important where the lack of trained healthcare workers restricts access to testing."
https://openalex.org/W4283720826,"SARS-CoV-2 causes the current global pandemic coronavirus disease 2019. Widely-available effective drugs could be a critical factor in halting the pandemic. The main protease (3CL pro ) plays a vital role in viral replication; therefore, it is of great interest to find inhibitors for this enzyme. We applied the combination of virtual screening based on molecular docking derived from the crystal structure of the peptidomimetic inhibitors (N3, 13b, and 11a), and experimental verification revealed FDA-approved drugs that could inhibit the 3CL pro of SARS-CoV-2. Three drugs were selected using the binding energy criteria and subsequently performed the 3CL pro inhibition by enzyme-based assay. In addition, six common drugs were also chosen to study the 3CL pro inhibition. Among these compounds, lapatinib showed high efficiency of 3CL pro inhibition (IC 50 value of 35 ± 1 μM and K i of 23 ± 1 μM). The binding behavior of lapatinib against 3CL pro was elucidated by molecular dynamics simulations. This drug could well bind with 3CL pro residues in the five subsites S1’, S1, S2, S3, and S4. Moreover, lapatinib’s key chemical pharmacophore features toward SAR-CoV-2 3CL pro shared important HBD and HBA with potent peptidomimetic inhibitors. The rational design of lapatinib was subsequently carried out using the obtained results. Our discovery provides an effective repurposed drug and its newly designed analogs to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro ."
https://openalex.org/W4283729014,"Introduction Neonates with serious bacterial infections should be treated with injectable antibiotics after hospitalization, which may not be feasible in many low resource settings. In 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched a guideline for the management of young infants (0–59 days old) with possible serious bacterial infection (PSBI) when referral for hospital treatment is not feasible. We evaluated the feasibility of the WHO guideline implementation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to achieve high coverage of PSBI treatment. Methods From April 2016 to March 2017, in a longitudinal, descriptive, mixed methods implementation research study, we implemented WHO PSBI guideline for sick young infants (0–59 dyas of age) in the public health programme setting in five health areas of North and South Ubangi Provinces with an overall population of about 60,000. We conducted policy dialogue with national and sub-national level government planners, decision-makers, academics and other stakeholders. We established a Technical Support Unit to provide implementation support. We built the capacity of health workers and managers and ensured the availability of necessary medicines and commodities. We followed infants with PSBI signs up to 14 days. The research team systematically collected data on adherence to treatment and outcomes. Results We identified 3050 live births and 285 (9.3%) young infants with signs of PSBI in the study area, of whom 256 were treated. Published data have reported 10% PSBI incidence rate in young infants. Therefore, the estimated coverage of treatment was 83.9% (256/305). Another 426 from outside the study catchment area were also identified with PSBI signs by the nurses of a health centre within the study area. Thus, a total of 711 young infants with PSBI were identified, 285 (40%) 7–59 days old infants had fast breathing (pneumonia), 141 (20%) 0–6 days old had fast breathing (severe pneumonia), 233 (33%) had signs of clinical severe infection (CSI), and 52 (7%) had signs of critical illness. Referral to a hospital was advised to 426 (60%) infants with CSI, critical illness or severe pneumonia. The referral was refused by 282 families who accepted simplified antibiotic treatment on an outpatient basis at the health centres. Treatment failure among those who received outpatient treatment occurred in 10/128 (8%) with severe pneumonia, 25/147 (17%) with CSI, including one death, and 2/7 (29%) young infants with a critical illness. Among 285 infants with pneumonia, 257 (90%) received oral amoxicillin treatment, and 8 (3%) failed treatment. Adherence to outpatient treatment was 98% to 100% for various PSBI sub-categories. Among 144 infants treated in a hospital, 8% (1/13) with severe pneumonia, 23% (20/86) with CSI and 40% (18/45) with critical illness died. Conclusion Implementation of the WHO PSBI guideline when a referral was not possible was feasible in our context with high coverage. Without financial and technical input to strengthen the health system at all levels, including the community and the referral level, it may not be possible to achieve and sustain the same high treatment coverage."

https://openalex.org/W4283714272,"Online social networks have been used to enhance human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) prevention, diagnosis, and treatment programs worldwide. This study aimed to develop a conceptual model of using online social networks in improving health literacy and medication adherence among people living with HIV/AIDS in Iran. This mixed-method sequential exploratory study was conducted in three phases. Firstly, a series of semi-structured interviews with a purposive sample of 29 HIV-positive patients were conducted to investigate the perceptions and experiences of HIV-positive patients about using online social networks to support health literacy and medication adherence. Thematic analysis was used to analyse qualitative interviews, extract potential components, and design a conceptual model. Then, a Delphi study with 27 HIV-positive patients was subsequently conducted to examine the consensus of patients on the proposed model. Finally, the trustworthiness and credibility of the proposed model were reviewed and evaluated by expert panel members from epidemiology and public health. Seven themes and 24 sub-themes emerged from the qualitative interviews. Five themes encompassed components of online social networks that supported communication and information-seeking behaviour of people living with HIV/AIDS. The two other themes encompassed social support and health-related outcomes including medication adherence. The credibility of the proposed conceptual model was confirmed methodologically using the expert panel and Delphi technique. Our findings highlighted that using online social networks has empowered Iranian people living with HIV/AIDS, making them more connected, safe, and able to access HIV/AIDS-related information and services. The role of online social networks in improving health literacy and medication adherence was also demonstrated in a conceptual model to understand the supportive components of online social networks in the HIV care continuum as well as customized interventions to improve the success of antiretroviral therapies."
https://openalex.org/W4283716100,"Avian haemosporidian parasites can cause malaria-like symptoms in their hosts and have been implicated in the demise of some bird species. The newly described Matryoshka RNA viruses (MaRNAV1 and MaRNAV2) infect haemosporidian parasites that in turn infect their vertebrate hosts. MaRNAV2 was the first RNA virus discovered associated with parasites of the genus Leucocytozoon. By analyzing metatranscriptomes from the NCBI SRA database with local sequence alignment tools, we detected two novel RNA viruses; we describe them as MaRNAV3 associated with Leucocytozoon and MaRNAV4 associated with Parahaemoproteus. MaRNAV3 had ~59% amino acid identity to the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) of MaRNAV1 and ~63% amino acid identity to MaRNAV2. MaRNAV4 had ~44% amino acid identity to MaRNAV1 and ~47% amino acid identity to MaRNAV2. These findings lead us to hypothesize that MaRNAV_like viruses are widespread and tightly associated with the order Haemosporida since they have been described in human Plasmodium vivax, and now two genera of avian haemosporidians."
https://openalex.org/W4283716645,"Brassaiopsis angustifolia K.M. Feng belongs to the family Araliaceae, and is an endangered shrub species in southwest China. Despite the importance of this species, the plastid genome has not been sequenced and analyzed. In this study, the complete plastid genome of B. angustifolia was sequenced, analyzed, and compared to the eight species in the Araliaceae family. Our study reveals that the complete plastid genome of B. angustifolia is 156,534 bp long, with an overall GC content of 37.9%. The chloroplast genome (cp) encodes 133 genes, including 88 protein-coding genes, 37 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes, and eight ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes. All protein-coding genes consisted of 21,582 codons. Among the nine species of Araliaceae, simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and five large repeat sequences were identified with total numbers ranging from 37 to 46 and 66 to 78, respectively. Five highly divergent regions were successfully identified that could be used as potential genetic markers of Brassaiopsis and Asian Palmate group. Phylogenetic analysis of 47 plastomes, representing 19 genera of Araliaceae and two related families, was performed to reconstruct highly supported relationships for the Araliaceae, which highlight four well-supported clades of the Hydrocotyle group, Greater Raukaua group, Aralia-Panax group, and Asian Palmate group. The genus Brassaiopsis can be divided into four groups using internal transcribed spacer (ITS) data. The results indicate that plastome and ITS data can contribute to investigations of the taxonomy, and phylogeny of B. angustifolia. This study provides a theoretical basis for species identification and future biological research on resources of the genus Brassaiopsis."
https://openalex.org/W4283727556,"Telemedicine is a vital component of the healthcare system's response to COVID-19. In March of 2020, Providence health system rapidly implemented a telemedicine home monitoring program (HMP) for COVID-19 patients that included use of at-home pulse oximeters and thermometers and text-based surveys to monitor symptoms. By June 2020, Providence updated the HMP to be offered in Spanish. This program was implemented before COVID-19 testing was readily available and therefore was offered to all patients suspected of having COVID-19. This study examines engagement, experience, and utilization patterns for English and Spanish-speaking patients engaged in the COVID-19 HMP.A retrospective review of program data was used to understand HMP patient engagement (responsiveness to three daily text to monitor symptoms), satisfaction with the program (likelihood to recommend the program) as well as comfort using home monitoring devices and comfort recovering from home. To understand impact on care for COVID-19 confirmed cases, we used electronic health records to measure patterns in healthcare use for COVID-19 positive HMP participants and non-HMP propensity weighted controls. All patients enrolled in the COVID-19 HMP from March-October 2020 were included in the study. Patients tested for COVID-19 during the time window and not enrolled in HMP were included in the propensity-weighted comparison group. Descriptive and regression analyses were performed overall and stratified by English and Spanish speakers.Of the 4,358 HMP participants, 75.5% identified as English speakers and 18.2% identified as Spanish speakers. There was high level of responsiveness to three daily text-based surveys monitoring symptoms engagement (>80%) and a high level of comfort using the home monitoring devices (thermometers and pulse oximeters) for English- and Spanish-speaking participants (97.3% and 99.6%, respectively). The majority of English (95.7%) and Spanish-speaking (100%) patients felt safe monitoring their condition from home and had high satisfaction with the HMP (76.5% and 83.6%, respectively). English and Spanish-speaking COVID-19 positive HMP participants had more outpatient and emergency departments (ED) encounters than non-participants 7 and 30 days after their positive test.This widely implemented HMP provided participants with a sense of safety and satisfaction and its use was associated with more outpatient care and ED encounters. These outcomes were comparable across English and Spanish-speakers, highlighting the importance and potential impact of language-concordant telemedicine."
https://openalex.org/W4283737610,"Is the pursuit of interdisciplinary or innovative research beneficial or detrimental for the impact of early career researchers? We focus on young scholars as they represent an understudied population who have yet to secure a place within academia. Which effects promise higher scientific recognition (i.e., citations) is therefore crucial for the high-stakes decisions young researchers face. To capture these effects, we introduce measurements for interdisciplinarity and novelty that can be applied to a researcher's career. In contrast to previous studies investigating research impact on the paper level, hence, our paper focuses on a career perspective (i.e., the level of authors). To consider different disciplinary cultures, we utilize a comprehensive dataset on U.S. physicists (n = 4003) and psychologists (n = 4097), who graduated between 2008 and 2012, and traced their publication records. Our results indicate that conducting interdisciplinary research as an early career researcher in physics is beneficial, while it is negatively associated with research impact in psychology. In both fields, physics and psychology, early career researchers focusing on novel combinations of existing knowledge are associated with higher future impact. Taking some risks by deviating to a certain degree from mainstream paradigms seems therefore like a rewarding strategy for young scholars."
https://openalex.org/W4283744120,"Throughout 2020, national and subnational governments worldwide implemented nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to contain the spread of COVID-19. These included community quarantines, also known as lockdowns, of varying length, scope, and stringency that restricted mobility. To assess the effect of community quarantines on urban mobility in the Philippines, we analyze a new source of data: cellphone-based origin-destination flows made available by a major telecommunication company. First, we demonstrate that mobility dropped to 26% of the pre-lockdown level in the first month of lockdown and recovered and stabilized at 70% in August and September of 2020. Then we quantify the heterogeneous effects of lockdowns by city's employment composition. A city with 10 percentage points more employment share in work-from-home friendly sectors is found to have experienced an additional 2.8% decrease in mobility under the most stringent lockdown policy. Similarly, an increase of 10 percentage points in employment share in large and medium-sized firms was associated with a1.9% decrease in mobility on top of the benchmark reduction. We compare our findings with cross-country evidence on lockdowns and mobility, discuss the economic implications for containment policies in the Philippines, and suggest additional research that can be based on this novel dataset."
https://openalex.org/W4283754490,"Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, much research has been conducted globally, but relatively few studies have been carried out in complex emergency settings that pose numerous operational challenges. We conducted a qualitative study to explore the barriers and enablers of a COVID-19 cohort study conducted in South Sudan and Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, to inform future research on COVID-19 and infectious diseases in humanitarian settings. We used a case study design embedded within the original prospective cohort study. Qualitative data was collected through four health facility assessments, 28 key informant interviews, and a focus group discussion. Data were analyzed using a manual thematic analysis approach and summarized against four primary themes: testing challenges and enablers, perceptions and attitudes towards COVID-19, national health system considerations, and study management considerations. Findings suggest most of the challenges affecting the cohort study were not specific to COVID-19 research but have been a feature of previous infectious disease research carried out in complex emergencies. However, the pandemic has exacerbated certain problems. The high proportion of travellers enrolled due to testing mandates, stigmatization of infected individuals linked to the heavy global focus on COVID-19, strained resources during waves of increasing infections, and remote management requirements all negatively impacted the cohort study. Factors that facilitated the research included proactive management, data quality oversight procedures, and strong collaboration with national health stakeholders. The global impact of COVID-19, its high public profile, and specific pandemic policies pose further operational challenges for research in already complex humanitarian settings. Future studies could plan mitigation measures that include flexibility in staffing and budgets, strategies to expand testing, and early partnerships with local organizations and health authorities."
https://openalex.org/W4283709329,"HORMAD1 expression is usually restricted to germline cells, but it becomes mis-expressed in epithelial cells in ~60% of triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs), where it is associated with elevated genomic instability (1). HORMAD1 expression in TNBC is bimodal with HORMAD1-positive TNBC representing a biologically distinct disease group. Identification of HORMAD1-driven genetic dependencies may uncover novel therapies for this disease group. To study HORMAD1-driven genetic dependencies, we generated a SUM159 cell line model with doxycycline-inducible HORMAD1 that replicated genomic instability phenotypes seen in HORMAD1-positive TNBC (1). Using small interfering RNA screens, we identified candidate genes whose depletion selectively inhibited the cellular growth of HORMAD1-expressing cells. We validated five genes (ATR, BRIP1, POLH, TDP1 and XRCC1), depletion of which led to reduced cellular growth or clonogenic survival in cells expressing HORMAD1. In addition to the translesion synthesis (TLS) polymerase POLH, we identified a HORMAD1-driven dependency upon additional TLS polymerases, namely POLK, REV1, REV3L and REV7. Our data confirms that out-of-context somatic expression of HORMAD1 can lead to genomic instability and reveals that HORMAD1 expression induces dependencies upon replication stress tolerance pathways, such as translesion synthesis. Our data also suggest that HORMAD1 expression could be a patient selection biomarker for agents targeting replication stress."
https://openalex.org/W4283717425,"During the first wave of infections, neurological symptoms in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients raised particular concern, suggesting that, in a subset of patients, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) could invade and damage cells of the central nervous system (CNS). Indeed, up to date several in vitro and in vivo studies have shown the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to reach the CNS. Both viral and/or host related features could explain why this occurs only in certain individuals and not in all the infected population. The aim of the present study was to evaluate if onset of neurological manifestations in COVID-19 patients was related to specific viral genomic signatures. To this end, viral genome was extracted directly from nasopharyngeal swabs of selected SARS-CoV-2 positive patients presenting a spectrum of neurological symptoms related to COVID-19, ranging from anosmia/ageusia to more severe symptoms. By adopting a whole genome sequences approach, here we describe a panel of known as well as unknown mutations detected in the analyzed SARS-CoV-2 genomes. While some of the found mutations were already associated with an improved viral fitness, no common signatures were detected when comparing viral sequences belonging to specific groups of patients. In conclusion, our data support the notion that COVID-19 neurological manifestations are mainly linked to patient-specific features more than to virus genomic peculiarities."

Fuchs' endothelial dystrophy (37.5%) and bullous keratopathy (62.5%) cases were included. The main clinical outcome measures were graft survival, best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), endothelial cell density (ECD), corneal thickness (CT), and complications. Correlation of the anterior curvature changes with refractive error was analyzed in the DMEK with cataract surgery group.The overall survival rate was 71.9%. Final graft failures were caused by rejection, glaucoma, and infection. Visual acuities improved by 89.3%. BCVA better than 20/40 and 20/20 was found in 75% and 28.6% of patients, respectively. The ECDs at 3 months and 1 year were 1400 and 1083 cells/mm2, respectively. The mean survival time, ECD, BCVA, CT, and complication rates were not different between the endothelium-in and endothelium-out methods. A hyperopic shift by +0.42 D was not related to the anterior curvature changes.Imported pre-cut tissues with a ≤ 3-day pre-cut-to-use time are feasible for DMEK in the treatment of corneal endothelial edema in eyes of Asian patients, and both endothelium-in and endothelium-out methods appear to be comparatively effective. Edema-induced anterior curvature change may not affect the refractive shift."
https://openalex.org/W4283732900,"Cystinuria is one of various disorders that cause biomineralization in the urinary system, including bladder stone formation in humans. It is most prevalent in children and adolescents and more aggressive in males. There is no cure, and only limited disease management techniques help to solubilize the stones. Recurrence, even after treatment, occurs frequently. Other than a buildup of cystine, little is known about factors involved in the formation, expansion, and recurrence of these stones. This study sought to define the growth of bladder stones, guided by micro-computed tomography imaging, and to profile dynamic stone proteome changes in a cystinuria mouse model. After bladder stones developed in vivo, they were harvested and separated into four developmental stages (sand, small, medium and large stone), based on their size. Data-dependent and data-independent acquisitions allowed deep profiling of stone proteomics. The proteomic signatures and pathways illustrated major changes as the stones grew. Stones initiate from a small nidus, grow outward, and show major enrichment in ribosomal proteins and factors related to coagulation and platelet degranulation, suggesting a major dysregulation in specific pathways that can be targeted for new therapeutic options."
https://openalex.org/W4283738206,"The influence of thinking flexibility on design is often underestimated by researchers in the field of design education. In this study, morphological analysis was used as a tool to develop design proposals and eye tracking technology was applied to track the attention. The feature of thinking activities in problem-solving between two groups (novice and expert) was analyzed by Heat map and Gaze plot in qualitative, and measured by indicators such as fixation and saccade in quantitative. Findings suggested that, i) Experts showed more fixation duration and fixation numbers in thinking activities, and the attention containing more AOIs was positively related to the rationality of the scheme. ii) Saccades with greater amplitude were more beneficial to the novelty of scheme. iii) Experts considered the information of each block in a balanced way, while novices tended to ignore unimportant blocks. These results will have a far-reaching impact on the development of designers' thinking and help novices to exercise creative thinking and produce high-quality designs."
https://openalex.org/W4283748211,"Proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) progression is associated with TGF-β2-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. In cancer cells, miR-4516 downregulates orthodenticle homeobox 1 (OTX1)-mediated cell invasion. Moreover, OTX1 is shown to be involved in invasion and EMT. The purpose of this study was to assess whether microRNA (miR-4516) suppresses EMT in RPE cells. EMT features were assessed using Western blotting, immunocytochemical staining, scratch-wound healing, modified Boyden chamber assay, and collagen gel contraction assay. For in vivo testing, a rabbit model was used, which involved induction of PVR by injection of transfected spontaneously arising RPE (ARPE) cells into the vitreous chamber. The putative target of miR-4516 was identified by luciferase reporter assay. Results showed that TGF-β2-induced transdifferentiation and migration of RPE cells was inhibited by miR-4516 delivery. Overexpression of miR-4516 led to upregulation of zonula occludens-1, downregulation of α-smooth muscle actin and vimentin, and cell contractility-all EMT features-in the TGF-β2-treated ARPE-19 cells. MiR-4516 regulated OTX1 expression negatively by binding to its 3'-UTR. TGF-β2-induced phosphorylated ERK was inhibited in miR-4516-overexpressing ARPE-19 cells. MiR-4516 suppressed experimental PVR in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, the overexpression of miR-4516 suppresses TGF-β2-induced EMT in a PVR model, and its role in PVR depends on OTX1/ERK. Further research is needed to develop a feasible treatment method to prevent and treat PVR."

Evaluating accuracy of novel MCPM technologies is critical for their appropriate use and adoption. Methods We prospectively compared the accuracy of Sibel’s Advanced Neonatal Epidermal (ANNE) technology with Masimo’s Rad-97 pulse CO-oximeter with capnography and Spengler’s Tempo Easy reference technologies during four evaluation rounds. We compared accuracy of heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ), and skin temperature using Bland-Altman plots and root-mean-square deviation analyses (RMSD). Sibel’s ANNE algorithms were optimized between each round. We created Clarke error grids with zones of 20% to aid with clinical interpretation of HR and RR results. Results Between November 2019 and August 2020 we collected 320 hours of data from 84 neonates. In the final round, Sibel’s ANNE technology demonstrated a normalized bias of 0% for HR and 3.1% for RR, and a non-normalized bias of -0.3% for SpO 2 and 0.2°C for temperature. The normalized spread between 95% upper and lower limits-of-agreement (LOA) was 4.7% for HR and 29.3% for RR. RMSD for SpO 2 was 1.9% and 1.5°C for temperature. Agreement between Sibel’s ANNE technology and the reference technologies met the a priori -defined thresholds for 95% spread of LOA and RMSD. Clarke error grids showed that all HR and RR observations were within a 20% difference. Conclusion Our findings suggest acceptable agreement between Sibel’s ANNE and reference technologies. Clinical effectiveness, feasibility, usability, acceptability, and cost-effectiveness investigations are necessary for large-scale implementation."

https://openalex.org/W4283718392,"Time-series data offer a way of investigating the causes driving ecological processes as phenomena. To test for possible differences in water relations between species of different forest structural guilds at Danum (Sabah, NE Borneo), daily stem girth increments ( gthi ), of 18 trees across six species were regressed individually on soil moisture potential (SMP) and temperature (TEMP), accounting for temporal autocorrelation (in GLS-arima models), and compared between a wet and a dry period. The best-fitting significant variables were SMP the day before and TEMP the same day. The first resulted in a mix of positive and negative coefficients, the second largely positive ones. An adjustment for dry-period showers was applied. Interactions were stronger in dry than wet period. Negative relationships for overstorey trees can be interpreted in a reversed causal sense: fast transporting stems depleted soil water and lowered SMP. Positive relationships for understorey trees meant they took up most water at high SMP. The unexpected negative relationships for these small trees may have been due to their roots accessing deeper water supplies (if SMP was inversely related to that of the surface layer), and this was influenced by competition with larger neighbour trees. A tree-soil flux dynamics manifold may have been operating. Patterns of mean diurnal girth variation were more consistent among species, and time-series coefficients were negatively related to their maxima. Expected differences in response to SMP in the wet and dry periods did not clearly support a previous hypothesis differentiating drought and non-drought tolerant understorey guilds. Trees within species showed highly individual responses when tree size was standardized. Data on individual root systems and SMP at several depths are needed to get closer to the mechanisms that underlie the tree-soil water phenomena in these tropical forests. Neighborhood stochasticity importantly creates varying local environments experienced by individual trees."
https://openalex.org/W4283725861,"We propose a framework to analyse partisan debates that involves extracting, classifying and exploring the latent argumentation structure and dynamics of online societal controversies. In this paper, the focus is placed on causal arguments, and the proposed framework is applied to the Twitter debate on the consequences of a hard Brexit scenario. Regular expressions based on causative verbs, structural topic modelling, and dynamic time warping techniques were used to identify partisan faction arguments, as well as their relations, and to infer agenda-setting dynamics. The results highlight that the arguments employed by partisan factions are mostly constructed around constellations of effect-classes based on polarised verb groups. These constellations show that the no-deal debate hinges on structurally balanced building blocks. Brexiteers focus more on arguments related to greenfield trading opportunities and increased autonomy, whereas Remainers argue more about what a no-deal Brexit could destroy, focusing on hard border issues, social tensions in Ireland and Scotland and other economy- and healthcare-related problems. More notably, inferred debate leadership dynamics show that, despite their different usage of terms and arguments, the two factions’ argumentation dynamics are strongly intertwined. Moreover, the identified periods in which agenda-setting roles change are linked to major events, such as extensions, elections and the Yellowhammer plan leak, and to new issues that emerged in relation to these events."
https://openalex.org/W4283728560,"Spontaneous preterm birth (SPTB) is a major cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality worldwide and defining its risk factors is necessary to reduce its prevalence. Recent studies have pointed out that bacterial vaginosis, a disturbance in the vaginal microbiome, is associated with SPTB. It is hypothesized that vaginal hygiene practices can alter the vaginal microbiome and are therefore associated with SPTB, but there are no studies investigating this matter.A case-control study was conducted between August 2018 and July 2021 in two affiliated university medical centers in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. We included a total of 79 women with a SPTB and compared them with 156 women with a term birth. Women with uterine anomalies, a history of cervical surgery or major congenital anomalies of the fetus were excluded. All participants filled in a questionnaire about vaginal washing with water, soap or gel, the use of intravaginal douches and vaginal steaming, both before and during pregnancy. Most women washed vaginally with water, 144 (61.3%) women before pregnancy and 135 (57.4%) women during pregnancy. A total of 43 (18.3%) washed with soap before and 36 (15.3%) during pregnancy. Before pregnancy, 40 (17.0%) women washed with vaginal gel and 27 (11.5%) during pregnancy. We found that the use of vaginal gel before pregnancy (aOR 2.29, 95% CI: 1.08-4.84) and even more during pregnancy, was associated with SPTB (aOR 3.45, 95% CI: 1.37-8.67). No association was found between washing with water or soap, intravaginal douching, or vaginal steaming and SPTB.Our findings suggest that the use of vaginal gel is associated with SPTB. Women should be informed that vaginal use of gels might not be safe."
https://openalex.org/W4283731128,"In Tennessee, populations of the state endangered Streamside Salamander (Ambystoma barbouri) are in decline as their distribution lies mostly within rapidly developing areas in the Nashville Basin. Information regarding the partitioning of genetic variation among populations of A. barbouri and the taxonomic status of these populations relative to northern populations and their congener, the Small-mouthed Salamander (A. texanum), have important implications for management and conservation of this species. Here we combined mitochondrial sequencing and genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data generated using Genotyping-by-Sequencing (GBS) to investigate patterns of genetic variation within Tennessee populations of A. barbouri, to assess their relationship to populations in Kentucky, and to examine their phylogenetic relationship to the closely related A. texanum. Results from phylogenetic reconstructions reveal a complex history of Tennessee A. barbouri populations with regards to northern populations, unisexual A. barbouri, and A. texanum. Patterns of mitochondrial sequence variation suggest that A. barbouri may have originated within Tennessee and expanded north multiple times into Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, and West Virginia. Phylogenetic reconstructions based on genome-wide SNP data contradict results based on mitochondrial DNA and correspond to geographic and taxonomic boundaries. Variation in allele frequencies at SNP genotypes, as identified by multivariate analyses and Bayesian assignment tests, identified three evolutionary significant units (ESUs) for A. barbouri within Tennessee. Collectively, these results emphasize the need for prioritizing conservation needs for Tennessee populations of A. barbouri to ensure the long-term persistence of this species."
https://openalex.org/W4283731396,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI), a leading cause of both death and disability worldwide, is highly prevalent among individuals who intersect with the criminal justice system. TBI is associated with increased behavioural, psychological, or negative outcomes, such as higher rates of mental health problems, aggression, and violent offending that may lead to negative interactions with the criminal justice system, reincarceration, and recidivism. Although rehabilitation is often recommended and holds promise in addressing TBI-related impairments, there is currently a paucity of reviews on rehabilitation for individuals with TBI who intersect with the criminal justice system (CJS). Concurrently, to the best of our knowledge, there is currently no review that considers rehabilitation among individuals with TBI who intersect with all parts of the CJS (i.e., policing, courts, corrections, and parole). This protocol is for a scoping review to address the above gaps, specifically, to identify the types of rehabilitation interventions and/or programs available to, or used by, individuals with TBI who intersect with all parts of the CJS. Primary research articles that meet pre-defined inclusion criteria will be identified from electronic databases (MEDLINE® ALL, Embase and Embase Classic, Cochrane CENTRAL Register of Clinical Trials, CINAHL, APA PsycINFO, Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts, Criminal Justice Abstracts, Nursing and Allied Health, and Dissertation and These Global), reference lists of included articles, and scoping or systematic reviews. Grey literature will also be searched to identify non-peer-reviewed reports. Retrieved articles will be screened by two reviewers and any disagreements will be resolved by a third reviewer. Data will be summarized quantitatively and analyzed using content analytic techniques. Intersecting identities will be charted and considered in the analysis. Stakeholders will be engaged to obtain feedback on preliminary results and the implications of findings. The scoping review will summarize the current state of rehabilitation available to, or used by, individuals with TBI who intersect with all parts of the CJS to (a) inform opportunities to integrate rehabilitation in the criminal justice system for diverse individuals and (b) identify opportunities for future research."
https://openalex.org/W4283733236,"Photosynthetic light response curve parameters help us understand the interspecific variation in photosynthetic traits, leaf acclimation status, carbon uptake, and plant productivity in specific environments. These parameters are also influenced by leaf traits which rely on species and growth environment. In accessions of four amaranth species ( Amaranthus . hybridus , A . dubius , A . hypochondriacus , and A . cruentus ), we determined variations in the net photosynthetic light response curves and leaf traits, and analysed the relationships between maximum gross photosynthetic rate, leaf traits, and whole-plant productivity. Non-rectangular hyperbolae were used for the net photosynthesis light response curves. Maximum gross photosynthetic rate ( P gmax ) was the only variant parameter among the species, ranging from 22.29 to 34.21 μmol m –2 s –1 . Interspecific variation existed for all the leaf traits except leaf mass per area and leaf inclination angle. Stomatal conductance, nitrogen, chlorophyll, and carotenoid contents, as well as leaf area correlated with P gmax . Stomatal conductance and leaf nitrogen explained much of the variation in P gmax at the leaf level. At the plant level, the slope between absolute growth rate and leaf area showed a strong linear relationship with P gmax . Overall, A . hybridus and A . cruentus exhibited higher P gmax at the leaf level and light use efficiency at the whole-plant level than A . dubius , and A . hypochondriacus . Thus, A . hybridus and A . cruentus tended to be more efficient with respect to carbon assimilation. These findings highlight the correlation between leaf photosynthetic characteristics, other leaf traits, and whole plant productivity in amaranths. Future studies may explore more species and accessions of Amaranthus at different locations or light environments."

Its correlation with some other cancers has been explored, but breast cancer (BC) not yet.The mRNA and protein expression of CCBL2 in BC cell lines and patient samples were detected by RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC). BC patients' clinical information and RNA-Seq expression were acquired via The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Patients were categorized into high/low CCBL2 expression groups based on the optimal cutoff value (8.973) determined by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. We investigated CCBL2 and clinicopathological characteristics' relationship using Chi-square tests, estimated diagnostic capacity using ROC curves and drew survival curves using Kaplan-Meier estimate. We compared survival differences using Cox regression and externally validated using Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. We evaluated enriched signaling pathways using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), explored CCBL2 and relevant genes' relationship using tumor immunoassay resource (TIMER) databases and used the human protein atlas (HPA) for pan-cancer analysis and IHC.CCBL2 was overexpressed in normal human cell lines and tissues. CCBL2 expression was lower in BC tissues (n = 1104) than in normal tissues (n = 114), validated by GEO database. Several clinicopathologic features were related to CCBL2, especially estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and clinical stages. The low expression group exhibited poor survival. CCBL2's area under curve (AUC) analysis showed finite diagnostic capacity. Multivariate cox-regression analysis indicated CCBL2 independently predicted BC survival. GSEA showed enriched pathways: early estrogen response, MYC and so on. CCBL2 positively correlated with estrogen, progesterone and androgen receptors. CCBL2 was downregulated in most cancers and was associated with their survival, including renal and ovarian cancers.Low CCBL2 expression is a promising poor BC survival independent prognostic marker."
https://openalex.org/W4283715900,"Terrorism is a major problem worldwide, causing thousands of fatalities and billions of dollars in damage every year. To address this threat, we propose a novel feature representation method and evaluate machine learning models that learn from localized news data in order to predict whether a terrorist attack will occur on a given calendar date and in a given state. The best model (a Random Forest aided by a novel variable-length moving average method) achieved area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of ≥ 0.667 (statistically significant w.r.t. random guessing with p ≤ .0001) on four of the five states that were impacted most by terrorism between 2015 and 2018. These results demonstrate that treating terrorism as a set of independent events, rather than as a continuous process, is a fruitful approach-especially when historical events are sparse and dissimilar-and that large-scale news data contains information that is useful for terrorism prediction. Our analysis also suggests that predictive models should be localized (i.e., state models should be independently designed, trained, and evaluated) and that the characteristics of individual attacks (e.g., responsible group or weapon type) were not correlated with prediction success. These contributions provide a foundation for the use of machine learning in efforts against terrorism in the United States and beyond."
https://openalex.org/W4283716304,"Symptom profiles have previously been identified for infectious intestinal disease (IID) which distinguish bacterial from viral organisms. However, there is evidence that the seasonality, severity, and duration of IID may differ between children, adults and elderly. A secondary data analysis was undertaken to explore whether symptom profiles for bacterial and viral IID vary across different age groups. Data from 844 cases of IID were divided into three age categories: <16 years, 16-65 years and >65 years. Multivariable logistic regression modelling was used to compare the significance of different symptoms across the three age groups. The odds of bacterial IID in children were increased by onset in the summer, diarrhoea in the absence of vomiting and fever. These symptoms were also associated with lower odds of a viral pathogen. In adults, diarrhoea but no vomiting, bloody diarrhoea and diarrhoea lasting more than 3 days were associated with increased odds of a bacterial organism, whilst onset in the winter or spring and a loss of appetite were associated with viral IID. In the elderly, diarrhoea in the absence of vomiting and diarrhoea lasting more than 3 days were associated with higher odds of bacterial IID and lower odds of a viral cause. Only diarrhoea in the absence of vomiting emerged as a key symptom across all three age groups. Variation in symptom profiles by age has implications for clinicians, public health specialists and epidemiologists who use symptoms to guide presumptive diagnoses in the absence of microbiological confirmation."
https://openalex.org/W4283718663,"Sexual dimorphism is seen in many dioecious plant and animal species, which may influence their trophic interactions. The differences in trophic interactions derived from sexual dimorphism in plants may influence herbivorous performance and population dynamics. Both silkworm (Bombyx mori L.) and mulberry (Morus alba L.) usually exhibit sexual dimorphism. However, few studies have been conducted on the effect of sex-related silkworm and mulberry pairings on cocoon and silk qualities, which are crucial in sericulture. Here, we compared the differences in cocoon and silk qualities under four feeding combinations (FS-FL: female silkworm fed with leaves from female mulberry trees; MS-FL: male silkworm fed with leaves from female mulberry trees; FS-ML: female silkworm fed with leaves from male mulberry trees; MS-ML: male silkworm fed with leaves from male mulberry trees). The results showed that silkworms exhibited male-biased herbivory with more male mulberry leaves digested. The FS-ML group had higher silk weight and silk ratio of fresh cocoons than the FS-FL group, and the MS-ML group had lower coarse points than the MS-FL group. Compared with groups FS-ML and FS-FL, both MS-FL and MS-ML had smaller cocoons with longer silk lengths and a higher silk ratio of the fresh cocoons. In addition, the Entropy Weight-TOPSIS method showed the cocoon quality rank as FS-ML > FS-FL > MS-FL > MS-ML, whereas silk quality rank was MS-ML > FS-FL > FS-ML > MS-FL. These results indicate that the quality of cocoon and silk is related to the interaction of silkworm and mulberry at the sex level. Furthermore, female silkworms fed with female and male tree leaves have a higher total yield in cocoon production, while male silkworms fed with male tree leaves produced higher silk quality."

Recognizing that participants' activity adherence is crucial for successful lifestyle modification, our team developed a smartphone application to enhance motivation toward brain health behavior based on gamification theory, which influences behaviors by enhancing motivation. The developed smartphone application has two main functions: delivering supporting videos from family, friends, and medical staff, and self-evaluation. We assessed the effectiveness of this smartphone application with regard to brain health behavior. In this eight-week randomized controlled trial, 40 participants were randomly assigned to the smartphone application intervention group or control group. The primary outcome reflected participants' brain health behavior in three categories: physical activity, cognitive activity, and healthy diet. Each brain health behavior was measured by the Korean version of the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire, Cognitive Activity Score, and Mediterranean DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay Diet Score. Furthermore, we investigated the change in motivation, measured by the Situational Motivation Scale. Additionally, we reviewed participants' self-record diary during the first, fourth, and eighth week of intervention for evaluation of adherence. The intervention group was found to have a positive association with moderate metabolic equivalent activities (P = 0.01) and intrinsic motivation change (P = 0.01). There was a significant difference between the intervention and control groups regarding average physical activity at week 8 (P = 0.037). An eight-week intervention with the smartphone application induced physical activity of moderate intensity through intrinsic motivation enhancement. We suggest that the motivation enhancement application could be an efficient option for maintaining and promoting psychosocial health behavior. This smartphone application can be applied to any other disease that needs behavioral change. Through the application, a broader spectrum of the population, regardless of time, space, and human resources, can benefit from community health services.

The directors were questioned by telephone at the end of a 3-week pilot phase. 445 nursing homes took part in the evaluation questionnaire, of which 36(8%) answered that they chose not to participate in the testing programme. The average participation rate of nursing staff was 49(±25)%. Perception of the justification of the efforts required for testing and perception of practicability of the procedure were significantly associated with the adoption of the system by the nursing homes directors (OR(95%CI): 5.96(1.97-18.0), p = 0.0016); OR(95%CI): 5.64(1.94-16.4), p = 0.0015 respectively). Staff support, incentives and meetings increased the level of engagement in testing (p<0.05). While the adoption of the programme confirmed the acceptability of salivary testing as a means of screening, the participation rate confirmed the need for studies to understand the factors that encourage health care staff to take part. The results suggested rethinking strategies to consider staff engagement from a health promotion perspective."

Yet, interpretation of the mostly pre-or protosymbolic, distinctive, and idiosyncratic movements of children with intellectual disabilities (IDs) or profound intellectual and multiple disabilities (PIMD) using computer-based assistive technology (AT), machine learning (ML), and environment data (ED: location, weather indices and time) remain insufficiently unexplored. We introduce a novel behavior inference computer-based communication-aid AT system structured on machine learning (ML) framework to interpret the movements of children with PIMD/IDs using ED. To establish a stable system, our study aimed to train, cross-validate (10-fold), test and compare the classification accuracy performance of ML classifiers (eXtreme gradient boosting [XGB], support vector machine [SVM], random forest [RF], and neural network [NN]) on classifying the 676 movements to 2, 3, or 7 behavior outcome classes using our proposed dataset recalibration (adding ED to movement datasets) with or without Boruta feature selection (53 child characteristics and movements, and ED-related features). Natural-child-caregiver-dyadic interactions observed in 105 single-dyad video-recorded (30-hour) sessions targeted caregiver-interpreted facial, body, and limb movements of 20 8-to 16-year-old children with PIMD/IDs and simultaneously app-and-sensor-collected ED. Classification accuracy variances and the influences of and the interaction among recalibrated dataset, feature selection, classifiers, and classes on the pooled classification accuracy rates were evaluated using three-way ANOVA. Results revealed that Boruta and NN-trained dataset in class 2 and the non-Boruta SVM-trained dataset in class 3 had &gt;76% accuracy rates. Statistically significant effects indicating high classification rates (&gt;60%) were found among movement datasets: with ED, non-Boruta, class 3, SVM, RF, and NN. Similar trends (&gt;69%) were found in class 2, NN, Boruta-trained movement dataset with ED, and SVM and RF, and non-Boruta-trained movement dataset with ED in class 3. These results support our hypotheses that adding environment data to movement datasets, selecting important features using Boruta, using NN, SVM and RF classifiers, and classifying movements to 2 and 3 behavior outcomes can provide &gt;73.3% accuracy rates, a promising performance for a stable ML-based behavior inference communication-aid AT system for children with PIMD/IDs."
https://openalex.org/W4283729654,"Background Publications may be a modifiable factor toward research project grant (RPG) funding decisions, the objective was to determine the association of publication record with later RPG receipt. Methods This was a retrospective cohort study of recipients of K01, K08, or K23 US career development awards (CDAs) starting from 2000–2015. Exposures were CDA awardees’ first-, middle-, and last-author publication counts, and the quartile of awardees’ highest and mean publication impact factors. The independent association of each exposure with time to RPG (R01 or equivalent) was determined using a Cox model, after adjustment for CDA type, awardee change in institution, and institutional CDA count. The proportion of CDA recipients with later independent funding was also determined by publication count. Results Among 6744 CDA awardees, 3943 obtained an RPG. The median time to RPG was 5.6 years (interquartile range 4.2–7.5). The number of first-authorships was associated with a shorter time to RPG (1–4 versus 0: hazard ratio [HR] 1.22, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.10–1.36; 5–9: 1.59, 95% CI 1.40–1.79; 10–24: 1.78, 95% CI 1.54–2.07; 25+: 2.40, 95% CI 1.61–3.56).

https://openalex.org/W4283729663,"Potatoes are the most consumed vegetable worldwide and play an important role in the U.S. economy. Growers make critical decisions each year in choosing which cultivar to grow, based on factors such as yield, resilience to the growing environment, and utility in the food industry. Current research supports the finding that less-common specialty cultivars (SCs) have benefits for human health. However, growers have been slow to adopt SCs into mainstream operations. Here, we identify major factors in the decision-making process that determine whether a population of growers in the San Luis Valley, Colorado, a major potato-growing region, adopt SC potatoes. We used a combination of ethnographic techniques and quantitative methods to examine drivers of adoption. The data demonstrate grower perceptions within potato farming and the complexity of interacting factors in decision-making. An integration of the Theory of Planned Behavior, Rational Expectation Hypothesis, and Diffusion of Innovation models identifies economic and social factors that influence grower decision-making. Growers that were more aware of specialty cultivar innovation and associated consumer demand were more open to SCs adoption. Other influencing factors include a grower’s experience selling a SC in the previous year and access to diverse markets. Based on these data, we developed a new model to explain grower decision-making processes in adopting SCs. The model demonstrates that one current barrier to adoption is access to buyers, including warehouses, retailers, and households. Taken together, this research demonstrates how rational expectations stem from economic outcomes, knowledge, and experience in the potato industry. These results are important in helping to consider opportunities for growers to access new, higher value markets, while also improving consumer access to nutritious cultivars."
https://openalex.org/W4283730269,"Female genital cutting (FGC) is still among the most common harmful traditional practices, especially in Africa and Asia. Despite the existence of rich evidence on the prevalence of FGC, information about the primary target audiences' (girls') intention toward FGC is limited. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the predictors of primary school girls' behavioral intention toward female genital cutting.An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted from May 08 to 28, 2019 in Dunna district, South Ethiopia. A two-stage sampling technique was used to select 354 uncircumcised female students. A self-administered pre-tested structured questionnaire was used for data collection. Data were entered into Epi data manager version 4.0.2 and exported to STATA version 16.0. Descriptive analyses such as frequency, percentage, mean and standard deviation were performed as necessary. Univariable and multivariable linear regression analyses were conducted to identify predictors of primary school girls' intention to experience FGC.The mean age of the respondents was 13.09±1.69 years with an age range of 10 to 18 years. Of the 354 respondents, 156 (44.1%) intended to experience FGC. The model accounted for 76.58% of the variance in primary school girls' intention to experience FGC. Among socio-demographic characteristics, mothers' educational level of ≤8 grade (β = 1.95, p<0.001) and the age of the respondents (β = -0.23, p = 0.036) predicted primary school girls' intention toward FGC. Among the constructs of the theory of planned behavior (TPB), direct perceived behavioral control (β = 0.47, p = 0.015), indirect perceived behavioral controls (β = 0.05, p = 0.002), and direct subjective norms (β = 0.18, p = 0.039) predicted primary school girls' intention to experience FGC.In this study, we found that primary school girls' intention toward FGC was high. The educational level of mothers and the age of the respondents had a great influence on primary school girls' intention to experience FGC. Perceived lack of power and social pressure also predicted primary school girls' intention to engage in genital cutting. The findings suggest that FGC is mainly performed by the decision of the parents irrespective of the girls' preferences. Therefore, behavioral change communication interventions such as media campaigns, peer education and community dialogue guided by the TPB for empowering girls to confront FGC and reducing the influence of referents need to be focused."
https://openalex.org/W4283731386,"Quasi-experimental research designs, such as regression discontinuity and interrupted time series, allow for causal inference in the absence of a randomized controlled trial, at the cost of additional assumptions. In this paper, we provide a framework for discontinuity-based designs using Bayesian model averaging and Gaussian process regression, which we refer to as 'Bayesian nonparametric discontinuity design', or BNDD for short. BNDD addresses the two major shortcomings in most implementations of such designs: overconfidence due to implicit conditioning on the alleged effect, and model misspecification due to reliance on overly simplistic regression models. With the appropriate Gaussian process covariance function, our approach can detect discontinuities of any order, and in spectral features. We demonstrate the usage of BNDD in simulations, and apply the framework to determine the effect of running for political positions on longevity, of the effect of an alleged historical phantom border in the Netherlands on Dutch voting behaviour, and of Kundalini Yoga meditation on heart rate."
https://openalex.org/W4283735995,"There remains a limited understanding of the HIV prevention and treatment needs among female sex workers in many parts of the world. Systematic reviews of existing literature can help fill this gap; however, well-done systematic reviews are time-demanding and labor-intensive. Here, we propose an automatic document classification approach to a systematic review to significantly reduce the effort in reviewing documents and optimizing empiric decision making. We first describe a manual document classification procedure that is used to curate a pertinent training dataset and then propose three classifiers: a keyword-guided method, a cluster analysis-based method, and a random forest approach that utilizes a large set of feature tokens. This approach is used to identify documents studying female sex workers that contain content relevant to either HIV or experienced violence. We compare the performance of the three classifiers by cross-validation in terms of area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic and precision and recall plot, and found random forest approach reduces the amount of manual reading for our example by 80%; in sensitivity analysis, we found that even trained with only 10% of data, the classifier can still avoid reading 75% of future documents (68% of total) while retaining 80% of relevant documents. In sum, the automated procedure of document classification presented here could improve both the precision and efficiency of systematic reviews and facilitate live reviews, where reviews are updated regularly. We expect to obtain a reasonable classifier by taking 20% of retrieved documents as training samples. The proposed classifier could also be used for more meaningfully assembling literature in other research areas and for rapid documents screening with a tight schedule, such as COVID-related work during the crisis."
https://openalex.org/W4283740924,"Background Worldwide, more than 95 million children are sexually abused each year with children in sub-Saharan Africa experiencing sexual assault at higher rates than those in more developed areas. In Uganda, 20% of young people indicated that their sexual debut was non-consensual. The risk for transmission of HIV to children through Child Sexual Abuse is high because of greater mucosal tissue damage and the often repetitive nature of abuse. This contributes significantly to the burden of HIV in Uganda. Despite these risks, studies have shown gaps in active parental involvement in child sexual abuse prevention despite their being the primary protectors of children. Against this background we sought to explore parental understanding of childhood sexual abuse and prevention as a measure for HIV prevention in Rwampara District, South Western Uganda. Methods A phenomenological study was carried out in four health centers that serve the communities of Rwampara district. A total of 25 (n = 25) parents or guardians of children aged 9–14 years were purposively selected to participate in the study. The participants were subjected to in-depth semi-structured interviews which were recorded, transcribed, and translated for thematic analysis. Results Parents’ understanding of child sexual abuse was limited to penetrative sex between a man and a child. Three of the parents interviewed reported to have had children who had been sexually abused while one of the parents had been abused when she was young. The children reported to have been abused were female and were between 3-14years. We also identified gaps in the sensitization of parents regarding home-based prevention of child sexual abuse and psychological support for the victims of abuse. Conclusion Our study shows that child sexual abuse exists in rural western Uganda. There remains a significant gap in the awareness of parents regarding the extent of sexual abuse, signs of sexual abuse, case handling, and psychological support for victims of sexual abuse. This significantly affects the capacity of parents as the primary protectors of children to identify and protect the children against the multiple forms of child sexual abuse."
https://openalex.org/W4283741687,"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is an established independent risk factor for peripheral neuropathy. Macro and microvascular changes have been documented in OSA, including high levels of potent vasoconstrictors. In diabetes, vasoconstriction has been identified as an underlying risk factor for corneal neuropathy. This study sought to establish a potential relationship between OSA and corneal nerve morphology and sensitivity, and to determine whether changes in corneal nerves may be reflective of OSA severity.Single center cross-sectional study.Sixty-seven patients were stratified into two groups: those with OSA and healthy controls. Groups were matched for age, sex, race, smoking, and dry eye status. Outcome measures included serologies, a dilated fundus exam, dry eye testing, anthropometric parameters, corneal sensitivity, subbasal nerve plexus morphology, retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness, and the use of questionnaires to assess symptoms of dry eye disease, risk of OSA, and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) compliance.No significant differences were observed in corneal nerve morphology, sensitivity, or the number of dendritic cells. In the OSA test group, RNFL thinning was noted in the superior and inferior regions of the optic disc and peripapillary region. A greater proportion of participants in the OSA group required a subsequent evaluation for glaucoma than in the control. In those with OSA, an increase in the apnea hypopnea index was associated with an increase in optic nerve cupping.OSA does not exert a robust effect on corneal nerves. OSA is however, associated with thinning of the RNFL. Participants with glaucomatous optic nerve changes and risk factors for OSA should be examined as uncontrolled OSA may exacerbate glaucoma progression."

https://openalex.org/W4283758152,"The COVID-19 data analysis is essential for policymakers to analyze the outbreak and manage the containment. Many approaches based on traditional time series clustering and forecasting methods, such as hierarchical clustering and exponential smoothing, have been proposed to cluster and forecast the COVID-19 data. However, most of these methods do not scale up with the high volume of cases. Moreover, the interactive nature of the application demands further critically complex yet compelling clustering and forecasting techniques. In this paper, we propose a web-based interactive tool to cluster and forecast the available data of Taiwan COVID-19 confirmed infection cases. We apply the Model-based (MOB) tree and domain-relevant attributes to cluster the dataset and display forecasting results using the Ordinary Least Square (OLS) method. In this OLS model, we apply a model produced by the MOB tree to forecast all series in each cluster. Our user-friendly parametric forecasting method is computationally cheap. A web app based on R's Shiny App makes it easier for practitioners to find clustering and forecasting results while choosing different parameters such as domain-relevant attributes. These results could help in determining the spread pattern and be utilized by medical researchers."
