https://openalex.org/W2068118161,"Neurotrophin-3-deficient (NT-3-deficient) mice were generated by gene targeting. Mutant mice displayed severe movement defects of the limbs, and most died shortly after birth. Substantial portions of peripheral sensory and sympathetic neurons were lost while motor neurons were not affected. Significantly, spinal proprioceptive afferents and their peripheral sense organs (muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs) were completely absent in homozygous mutant mice. This correlated with a loss of parvalbumin and carbonic anhydrase-positive neurons in the dorsal root ganglion. No gross abnormalities were seen in Pacinian corpuscles, cutaneous afferents containing substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide, and deep nerve fibers in the joint capsule and tendon. Importantly, the number of muscle spindles in heterozygous mutant mice was half of that in control mice, indicating that NT-3 is present at limiting concentrations in the embryo."
https://openalex.org/W2141385342,"FK506-binding protein (FKBP12) was originally identified as the cytosolic receptor for the immunosuppressant drugs FK506 and rapamycin. The cellular function of FKBP12, a ubiquitously expressed 12,000-dalton proline isomerase, has been unknown. FKBP12 copurifies with the 565,000-dalton ryanodine receptor (RyR), four of which form intracellular Ca2+ release channels of the sarcoplasmic and endoplasmic reticula. By coexpressing the RyR and FKBP12 in insect cells, we have demonstrated that FKBP12 modulates channel gating by increasing channels with full conductance levels (by > 400%), decreasing open probability after caffeine activation (from 0.63 +/- 0.09 to 0.04 +/- 0.02), and increasing mean open time (from 4.4 +/- 0.6 ms to 75 +/- 41 ms). FK506 or rapamycin, inhibitors of FKBP12 isomerase activity, reverse these stabilizing effects. These results provide the first natural cellular function for FKBP12, and establish that the functional Ca2+ release channel complex includes FKBP12."

https://openalex.org/W2025561101,"The heregulin/neu differentiation factor gene products were purified and cloned based on their ability to stimulate the phosphorylation of a 185-kDa protein in human breast carcinoma cell lines known to express erbB2. However, not all cells that express erbB2 respond to heregulin, indicating that other components besides erbB2 may be required for heregulin binding. Cells that are transfected with the closely related receptor, erbB3, display a single class of lower affinity heregulin binding sites than has been previously observed on breast carcinoma cell lines. Little or no stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation in response to heregulin occurs in cells that are transfected with erbB3 alone. Transfection of cells with erbB3 and erbB2 reconstitutes a higher affinity binding receptor, which is also capable of generating a tyrosine phosphorylation signal in response to heregulin. A monoclonal antibody to erbB2 will inhibit heregulin activation of tyrosine phosphorylation and binding in cells transfected with both receptors but not with erbB3 alone. In cells expressing erbB2 and erbB3, both proteins become tyrosine-phosphorylated upon interaction with heregulin. Direct interaction between heregulin and the two proteins was demonstrated by chemical cross-linking experiments using 125I-heregulin followed by immunoprecipitation with antibodies specific for erbB2 or erbB3."
https://openalex.org/W2027818105,"To determine whether neurotrophins act on functionally distinct populations of adult sensory neurons, the distributions of mRNAs for TrkA and tyrosine kinase-containing isoforms of TrkB and TrkC were determined in rat DRG neurons projecting to different peripheral targets. Whereas trkA was expressed by a very high percentage of visceral afferents, trkC was expressed frequently only in muscle afferents. Among cutaneous afferents, the size distributions for trkA- and trkC-positive cells showed little overlap. The percentages and size distributions of cells labeled for the trks argue strongly that almost all trkB-expressing cells must also express trkA or trkC. These results indicate that NGF and NT-3 act on functionally distinct populations of adult sensory neurons and suggest that a sizeable number of small DRG neurons may not respond to neurotrophins via a known Trk in the adult rat."

https://openalex.org/W1525551129,"Abstract Deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 (delta F508) in the first nucleotide-binding fold of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is the most common mutation in patients with cystic fibrosis. Although retaining functional Cl- channel activity, this mutant is recognized as abnormal by the cellular quality control machinery and is retained within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We have used human epithelial cells and recombinant Chinese hamster ovary cells to identify molecular interactions that may contribute to this intracellular retention. Based upon coimmunoprecipitation and cosedimentation through glycerol density gradients, newly synthesized wild-type and delta F508 mutant CFTRs associated specifically with calnexin, the calcium-binding transmembrane chaperone of the ER. This association was restricted to the immature (or ER-associated) forms of the CFTR proteins. Although the bulk of wild-type and delta F508 CFTRs were present initially in complexes containing calnexin, only wild-type CFTR was able to escape from this association and exit the ER. Calnexin retains misfolded or incompletely assembled proteins in the ER and thus is likely to contribute to the mislocalization of mutant CFTR."

https://openalex.org/W1556766638,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene, VPH1 (Vacuolar pH 1), encodes a 95-kDa integral membrane subunit of the vacuolar-type H(+)-ATPase (V-ATPase) that is required for enzyme assembly; disruption of the VPH1 gene impairs vacuolar acidification (Manolson, M.F., Proteau, D., Preston, R. A., Stenbit, A., Roberts, B. T., Hoyt, M. A., Preuss, D., Mulholland, J., Botstein, D., and Jones, E. W. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 14294-14303). Here we show that STV1 (Similar To VPH1) encodes an integral membrane polypeptide of 102 kDa with 54% identity with the peptide sequence of Vph1p. High copy expression of STV1 partially restores vacuolar acidification in a delta vph1 mutant strain; solubilization and fractionation of membrane proteins from these vacuoles show that Stv1p co-purifies with bafilomycin A1-sensitive ATPase activity and with the 60- and 69-kDa V-ATPase subunits. Immunofluorescence microscopy of strains bearing a single copy of epitope-tagged STV1 reveals punctate staining of the cytoplasm; overexpression of epitope-tagged Stv1p reveals both punctate cytoplasmic staining and vacuolar membrane staining. Northern analysis shows that disruption of STV1 does not affect the level of transcription of VPH1 and that disruption of VPH1 does not affect the level of transcription of STV1. Strains bearing disruption of genes encoding other V-ATPase subunits (VMA1, VMA2, VMA3, and VMA4) fail to grow on media supplemented with 100 mM CaCl2 or 4 mM ZnCl2, media buffered to pH 7.5, or media with a glycerol carbon source. On the same types of media only a delta vph1 delta stv1 double disruption mutant has growth phenotypes equivalent to strains bearing a single disruption of the VMA1, VMA2, VMA3, and VMA4 genes; a delta vph1 strain has only moderate growth inhibition while a delta stv1 strain has wild type growth on the conditions listed above. We conclude that Stv1p is a functional homologue of Vph1p and suggest that Stv1p and Vph1p may be equivalent subunits for V-ATPases located on different organelles. The function of these 100-kDa homologues may be to target or regulate other common V-ATPase subunits for two distinct cellular locations."

https://openalex.org/W1494495256,"The enzyme glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) has been implicated in the control of several metabolic enzymes and transcription factors in response to extracellular signals. In the past, the enzyme has been considered to be a protein Ser/Thr kinase although it was recently reported to contain Tyr(P) (Hughes, K., Nikolakaki, E., Plyte, S. E., Totty, N. F., and Woodgett, J. R. (1993) EMBO J. 12, 803-808). A cDNA encoding rabbit skeletal muscle GSK-3 beta was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli as an active protein kinase, with apparent M(r) 46,000, capable of phosphorylating several known GSK-3 substrates. Recombinant GSK-3 beta autophosphorylated on Ser, Thr, and Tyr residues although the enzyme already contained Tyr(P) as judged by its recognition by anti-Tyr(P) antibodies. The net result of the autophosphorylation was a 3-5-fold reduction in enzyme activity. GSK-3 alpha, purified from rabbit muscle, also underwent autophosphorylation but only on Ser and Thr residues. In this case, the autophosphorylation stabilized the enzyme activity compared with the control lacking ATP/Mg2+. Of several phosphatases tested, the lambda-phage phosphatase was the most effective in dephosphorylating at Ser and Thr residues but did not dephosphorylate at Tyr residues. The action of the lambda-phosphatase caused a reactivation of GSK-3 beta to approximately 80% of the starting activity. The protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B was able to dephosphorylate at Tyr residues leading to a reduction in enzyme activity. A truncated form of GSK-3 beta, apparent M(r) 40,000, had a significantly higher specific activity, was defective in autophosphorylation, and was not inactivated in the autophosphorylation reaction. We conclude that GSK-3 beta is a dual specificity protein kinase in the same sense as the mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK family of enzymes. Phosphorylation at different residues differentially controls enzyme activity, Ser/Thr phosphorylation causing inactivation and Tyr phosphorylation resulting in increased activity."
https://openalex.org/W1564546569,"Shc proteins contain a single SH2 domain, lack catalytic activity, and are substrates for activated receptors for insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and epidermal growth factor (EGF). Treatment with these growth factors induced rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc. We investigated the potential role of Shc in mitogenic signaling. Affinity-purified antibodies were microinjected into living Rat1 fibroblasts overexpressing human insulin receptors. Bromodeoxyuridine incorporation into newly synthesized DNA was subsequently studied to assess the importance of Shc. Cellular microinjection of anti-Shc antibody inhibited BrdU incorporation induced by insulin, IGF-1, and EGF, but did not affect cells stimulated by fetal calf serum. Microinjection of an oncogenic p21ras protein (T24) into quiescent cells produced constitutively active mitogenic signaling, and comicroinjection of T24 with the anti-Shc antibody restored insulin and EGF stimulation of DNA synthesis. Immunoprecipitates of Shc from lysates of insulin-stimulated cells removed 70-80% of guanine nucleotide-releasing factor activity. These results indicate that Shc is an important component in a mitogenic signal transduction pathway that is shared by insulin, IGF-1, and EGF. The functional locus of Shc is either upstream of p21ras or lies on a distinct branch of the pathway leading to cell cycle progression."
https://openalex.org/W2081413793,"Sulfhydryl redox agents affect NMDA receptor activity. We investigated a putative redox site in four recombinant NMDA receptors. In 293 cells expressing NR1-NR2A channels dithiothreitol (DTT) rapidly potentiated L-glutamate-activated whole-cell currents and decreased the time course of desensitization and deactivation. Part of the current potentiation (reversible component) and all kinetic changes reversed upon washout. The remaining potentiation (persistent component) was abolished by an oxidizing agent. The N-terminal 370 residues of NR2A mediate the reversible component in chimeric NR2 subunits. In cells expressing the NR1-NR2B, -NR2C, and -NR2D channels DTT elicited only a slowly developing, persistent potentiation and increased the deactivation time course. In these, but not in NR1-NR2A, the DTT effect was rendered insensitive to reoxidation by alkylation. Reduced glutathione mimicked the DTT effects only in the NR1-NR2A receptor. Hence, molecularly distinct NMDA receptors differ profoundly in their responses to sulfhydryl redox agents."
https://openalex.org/W1499782463,"The physiological role of insulin-like growth factor (IGF) II (IGF-II) in adult humans is poorly understood. Rather high levels of IGF-II persist in adult human serum, whereas, in rodents, IGF-II levels are very low. To investigate the physiological and carcinogenic effects of persistently elevated IGF-II in adults, we have produced two lines of transgenic mice in which high levels of IGF-II (20- or 30-fold increase above normal) are persistently maintained in the blood. The transgene is driven by the major urinary protein promoter, and it is highly expressed in the liver and perputial glands in both lines. The adult transgenic mice are smaller than controls, and their body composition is altered. Their lean body mass is reduced by 5-8%, whereas fat mass is reduced between 44 and 77%. The mice expressing the highest level of IGF-II (30x) develop hypoglycemia and hypoinsulinemia and IGF-I levels are normal. Mice in the lower expression line (20-fold elevated IGF-II) develop hypoglycemia progressively over their lifetime. Mice from both lines also develop a diverse spectrum of tumors at a higher frequency than controls after 18 months of age, and the most frequent types of tumors are hepatocellular carcinomas and lymphomas. Squamous cell carcinoma, sarcoma, and thyroid carcinomas also occurred in our test group. The long latent period before tumors arise and the wide spectrum of tumor types suggest that IGF-II may function primarily as a tumor progression factor in mice via autocrine and endocrine mechanisms of action."
https://openalex.org/W1535696878,"Abstract FAK is a focal adhesion kinase that is phosphorylated on tyrosine in activated platelets. Induction of FAK phosphorylation requires both fibrinogen binding to integrin alpha IIb beta 3 and post-occupancy events during agonist-induced platelet aggregation or platelet spreading on a fibrinogen matrix. To identify the signaling pathways necessary for tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK, we have examined the conditions that stimulate or inhibit this phosphorylation in platelets in which fibrinogen binding to alpha IIb beta 3 and platelet aggregation were induced directly with an anti-beta 3 Fab fragment (anti-LIBS6). Apyrase was added to prevent effects of the endogenous platelet agonist, ADP. Under these conditions, neither fibrinogen binding nor primary platelet aggregation was sufficient to induce FAK phosphorylation, suggesting that a second costimulatory event was required. Indeed, when epinephrine was added with fibrinogen and anti-LIBS6, large platelet aggregates formed and FAK phosphorylation occurred. This response was prevented by blockade of cyclooxygenase with indomethacin or thromboxane A2 receptors with SQ 30,741. A stable thromboxane A2 analogue (U46619) could substitute for epinephrine as the costimulus. Epinephrine costimulation of FAK phosphorylation was also prevented by chelation of intracellular Ca2+ with BAPTA or selective inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC) with bisindolylmaleimide, indicating that Ca2+ and PKC are necessary for FAK phosphorylation under these conditions. Epinephrine also promoted FAK phosphorylation and adhesive spreading of apyrase-treated platelets on a fibrinogen matrix. Cytochalasin D, an inhibitor of actin polymerization, blocked FAK phosphorylation under all these conditions. Thus, tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK in platelets requires coordinated signaling through occupied integrin and agonist receptors. These separate pathways may converge to increase free Ca2+ and activate PKC and thus promote the cytoskeletal reorganization required for activation of FAK."
https://openalex.org/W1485657773,"Protein kinase C (PKC)-related cDNA clones isolated from cDNA libraries of mouse P19 embryonal carcinoma cells and mouse brain encoded a 67-kDa protein, PKC lambda. PKC lambda shows the highest amino acid sequence identity with PKC zeta (72%), the third class of the PKC family. Northern blot analysis showed that the mRNA for PKC lambda is expressed in a wide variety of cells and tissues, including P19 and NIH 3T3 cells, as well as brain, kidney, testis, and ovary. In undifferentiated P19 cells, the mRNA for PKC lambda is the most abundant among all the PKC family members. The differentiation of P19 cells results in an increase in PKC alpha and epsilon, and a decrease in PKC lambda. Antiserum raised against a peptide of PKC lambda identified a 74-kDa protein in P19 cell extracts as well as in extracts from COS cells transfected with the PKC lambda expression plasmid. Autophosphorylation of the PKC lambda that immunoprecipitated with the specific antiserum was observed, indicating that PKC lambda possesses protein kinase activity. A phorbol ester binding assay using intact COS cells expressing PKC lambda failed to detect binding activity specific to PKC lambda at phorbol dibutylate concentrations up to 300 nM, suggesting that PKC lambda does not possess phorbol ester binding activity. These results, in conjunction with the results obtained in parallel experiments with PKC zeta and other PKC members, suggest a biochemical similarity between PKC lambda and zeta and their clear difference from other PKC members."
https://openalex.org/W1546825042,"Two unique nucleotide probes for human tracheobronchial mucin glycoprotein (TBM) were generated via polymerase chain reaction with degenerate primers deduced from the TBM:TR-3A tryptic peptide sequence and were used to isolate a 3.6 kilobase cDNA, clone NP3a, from a human nasal polyp cDNA library. Clone NP3a was localized to chromosome 11 and contained a 3168 nucleotide open reading frame which encoded three TBM peptide fragments, thus confirming that clone NP3a partially encodes TBM. TBM also contains five tandem repeats of TTVGP/S and an octapeptide GQCGTCTN, which is conserved in human intestinal mucin MUC2 and rat intestinal mucin-like protein (MLP) suggesting that this sequence has a functional significance for secreted mucins. TBM has amino acid similarity to the cysteine-rich domains at the carboxyl termini of MUC2, rat MLP, bovine and porcine submaxillary mucins, and human von Willebrand factor. Strikingly, a large percentage of the cysteine residues in the overlaps are highly conserved: 90% in MUC2 and von Willebrand factor, 80% of bovine submaxillary mucin, 70% in porcine submaxillary mucin, and 64% in rat MLP, suggesting that conserved cysteines may be important for the tertiary structure of secreted glycoproteins. These studies demonstrate that clone NP3a is a candidate for MUC5, making it the only human mucin gene reported to date whose gene product has been isolated from airway secretions."
https://openalex.org/W1568438452,"Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) induces the expression of a set of early response genes by tyrosine phosphorylation of latent transcription factors such as p91. Although the tyrosine kinases, Jak1 and Jak2, have recently been shown to be critical for signal transduction by IFN-gamma, evidence is lacking for both tyrosine phosphorylation of the IFN-gamma receptor (IFN-gamma R) and the interaction between Jak1, Jak2, and the IFN-gamma R. In this report, we show that binding of IFN-gamma to HeLa cells initiated a series of events that resulted in the extremely rapid (15 s) tyrosine phosphorylation of not only Jak1, Jak2, and p91 but also the IFN-gamma R. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed that Jak1 was associated with the IFN-gamma R prior to ligand binding, whereas Jak2 became part of the IFN-gamma R-Jak1 complex immediately after ligand binding. H2O2/vanadate treatment of cells for 15 min resulted in only the tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak1 and IFN-gamma R. Only after 60 min of this treatment did we observe tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 and p91 and assembly of the transcription factor complex FcRF gamma that binds to the promoter of the fcgr1 gene. These data suggest that JAK1 associates with the IFN-gamma R prior to ligand binding. IFN-gamma treatment of cells results in recruitment of JAK2 into the IFN-gamma R-Jak1 complex followed by assembly of the transcription factor FcRF gamma complex."
https://openalex.org/W1545489296,"Urokinase receptors are distributed on surfaces of many cell types where they are thought to focus plasminogen-dependent proteolysis important to migration and tissue remodeling to the immediate pericellular space. In addition to its well characterized role in proteolysis, urokinase receptor binding per se promotes the adhesiveness of leukemic cell lines exposed to differentiating cytokines in vitro. We sought to determine if a serum or matrix component is involved in urokinase-dependent adhesion. We now report that cytokine-stimulated human myelomonocytic cells express a divalent cation- and Arg-Gly-Asp-independent high affinity receptor for urea-purified vitronectin (Kd < 10 nM). Soluble native vitronectin does not effectively bind to the receptor, while cellular adhesion was noted to both urea-purified and native vitronectin when adsorbed to plastic. The activity of this receptor is tightly coupled to urokinase receptor occupancy. Urokinase receptor binding thus induces selective and reversible cellular adhesion to the matrix form of vitronectin. Because transfer of vitronectin-bound plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 to urokinase promotes rapid turnover of receptor-bound enzyme, these results illuminate a novel binding cycle by which urokinase receptor occupancy coordinately regulates cellular adhesiveness and pericellular proteolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1499812702,"Nitric oxide (NO) synthases contain FAD, FMN, heme, and (6R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-L-biopterin as prosthetic groups. We have characterized the pteridine-binding site of purified brain NO synthase, using 3H-labeled (6R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-L-biopterin as radioligand. Association of [3H]tetrahydrobiopterin followed second-order kinetics (kon = 1.3 x 10(6) M-1 min-1), the dissociation reaction was reversible and first-order (koff = 3.2 x 10(-1) min-1), yielding a kinetic KD of 0.25 microM. Binding of the radioligand was competitively antagonized by several pteridine derivatives with the following order of potency (KI): 7,8-dihydro-L-biopterin (2.2 microM), (6S)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-L-biopterin (19 microM), (6R,S)-6-methyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterin (240 microM), and 6,7-dimethyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterin (> 1 mM). The affinity of NO synthase for tetrahydrobiopterin was increased 6-fold in the presence of 0.1 mM L-arginine (KD = 37 nM), and, conversely, tetrahydrobiopterin enhanced the affinity of the enzyme for 3H-labeled NG-nitro-L-arginine about 2-fold. 7-Nitroindazole, which presumably binds to the heme group of NO synthase, competitively inhibited binding of [3H]tetrahydrobiopterin and [3H]NG-nitro-L-arginine with similar Ki values (0.1 microM). Functional as well as binding studies revealed that 7-nitroindazole was competitive with both L-arginine and tetrahydrobiopterin. Our data indicate that brain NO synthase exhibits a highly specific binding site for (6R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-L-biopterin, which allosterically interacts with the substrate domain and may be located proximal to the prosthetic heme group of NO synthase."
https://openalex.org/W1536598892,"The cytoplasmic insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), which is multiply phosphorylated in vivo on tyrosine residues, is a known binding protein for the tandem src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase, SH-PTP2. Eleven phosphotyrosyl (pY) peptides from IRS-1 were screened for allosteric activation of SH-PTP2 phosphatase activity toward phosphorylated, reduced, carboxyamidomethylated, and maleylated-lysozyme. Peptides IRS-1pY895, IRS-1pY1172, and IRS-1pY1222 showed up to 50-fold acceleration of dephosphorylation. Analyses of Arg to Lys mutants in either or both SH2 domains indicate that both the N-terminal (N-SH2) and C-terminal (C-SH2) domains function in allosteric activation. Direct determination by surface plasmon resonance of the dissociation constants between pY peptides and glutathione S-transferase fusions to N-SH2 and C-SH2 domains reveals a 240-fold preference of the N-SH2 domain (compared with the C-SH2 domain) for IRS-1pY1172. The N-SH2 domain prefers IRS-1pY1172 > IRS-1pY895 > IRS-1pY1222, whereas C-SH2 domain prefers IRS-1pY1222 > IRS-1pY895 > IRS-1pY1172. These data suggest that each SH2 domain can bind to a distinct pY sequence of multiply phosphorylated protein substrates such as IRS-1, while activating hydrolysis at a third pY sequence bound in the SH-PTP2 active site. In addition, proteolysis and truncation studies reveal an autoregulatory function for the C-terminal region of SH-PTP2. Limited tryptic cleavage within the C-terminus results in 27-fold activation of protein tyrosine phosphatase activity. The activated tryptic fragment cannot be further activated by pY peptide binding to the SH2 domains indicating that autoregulatory functions of the SH2 domains are dependent on the C-terminal region. These data suggest that multiple levels for control of SH-PTP2 enzymatic activity may exist in vitro and in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1518552940,"Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and nitric oxide synthase are part of the anti-tumor and antimicrobial activities of mononuclear phagocytes induced by interferon-gamma (IFN gamma). As IDO is a heme-containing enzyme and NO, the product of nitric oxide synthase-initiated arginine degradation, is a regulator of heme enzymes, we investigated whether NO is capable of modulating IDO activity in IFN gamma-primed mononuclear phagocytes. Authentic NO gas or the NO-generating compound, diethylamine dinitric oxide adduct, dose-dependently inhibited IDO activity in cell lysates prepared from IFN gamma-primed human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, as assessed by the ascorbate/methylene blue assay for IDO. In contrast, neither nitrite nor nitrate affected IDO activity. Exposure of intact IFN gamma-primed human peripheral blood mononuclear cells or monocyte-derived macrophages to any of the NO-generating compounds, sodium nitroprusside, glyceryl trinitrate, S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine, or diethylamine dinitric oxide adduct, resulted in inhibition of both the consumption of tryptophan from and formation of its metabolite, kynurenine, in the culture medium. The observed inhibition of IDO activity was not due to toxicity of the NO generators and was abrogated by the co-addition of oxyhemoglobin, an antagonist of NO function. Comparable concentrations of nitrite or nitrate did not inhibit IDO activity in intact cells. In contrast to human cells, addition of IFN gamma to murine macrophages, cultured in complete RPMI 1640 medium, readily induced nitric oxide synthase. Others have reported that such treatment does not induce IDO activity in these cells. However, induction of IDO activity was observed in murine macrophages when the synthesis of reactive nitrogen species was inhibited, by using arginine-free medium and/or the nitric oxide synthesis inhibitor, NG-monomethyl-L-arginine. Together, these results demonstrate that both exogenous and endogenous NO inhibit IDO activity and that oxidative arginine and tryptophan metabolism in IFN gamma-primed mononuclear phagocytes are functionally related. Our study thereby provides an insight into how these cells may regulate some of their antimicrobial and anti-tumor activities."
https://openalex.org/W1606651604,"The extracellular domain of receptor type protein tyrosine phosphatase beta (RPTP beta) exhibits striking sequence similarity with a soluble, rat brain chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (3F8 PG). Immunoprecipitation experiments of cells transfected with RPTP beta expression vector and metabolically labeled with [35S]sulfate and [35S]methionine indicate that the transmembrane form of RPTP beta is indeed a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan. The 3F8 PG is therefore a variant form composed of the entire extracellular domain of RPTP beta probably generated by alternative RNA splicing. Previous immunohistochemical studies indicated that both RPTP beta and the extracellular matrix protein tenascin are localized in similar regions of the central nervous system. We have performed co-aggregation assays with red and green Co-vaspheres coated with tenascin and 3F8 PG, respectively, showing that the extracellular domain of RPTP beta (3F8 PG) binds specifically to tenascin. The interaction between a receptor tyrosine phosphatase and an extracellular matrix protein may have a role in development of the mammalian central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W1608870321,"In macrophages and certain other cell types, extracellular ATP4- can increase plasma membrane permeability through activation of the P2z purinergic receptor. This permeability change involves the induction of non-selective pores which are permeable to molecules with M(r) < or = 900. Electrophysiological studies indicate that agonist occupation of P2z purinergic receptors can additionally activate cation channels which may be distinct from the non-selective pores. We have observed that mammalian P2z purinergic receptors can be expressed in Xenopus oocytes injected with mRNA from the BAC1.2F5 murine macrophage cell line. Under voltage-clamp analysis, these oocytes exhibit a multiphasic inward current in response to ATP or 3'-O-(4-benzoyl)-benzoyl-ATP (BzATP), a selective agonist for the P2z purinergic receptor. This ATP/BzATP-induced current is characterized by a rapidly activated phase which is followed by a delayed, but steady, increase in conductance. We have used two-electrode voltage-clamp analysis and ion substitution to further characterize these P2z purinergic receptor-induced currents as expressed in mRNA-injected oocytes. N,N-Hexamethylene amiloride (HMA), a potent inhibitor of various exchangers and channels, selectively and reversibly inhibited the delayed component of the BzATP-induced inward current. This delayed HMA-sensitive current can be carried by large organic cations, such as N-methyl-D-glucamine (NMG+) and Tris+, in addition to small inorganic cations including Na+, Li+, and K+. In contrast, the rapidly activated HMA-insensitive current is readily carried by Na+, Li+, and K+, but is poorly carried by NMG+ and Tris+. Additional studies characterized P2z receptor regulation of Ca2+ influx, depolarization, ethidium uptake, and fura-2 loss in native BAC1.2F5 macrophages. Reduced temperature permitted discrimination of two distinct permeability pathways which could be activated by BzATP. At 20 degrees C, BzATP did not significantly increase membrane permeability to NMG+ (M(r) 195), ethidium+ (M(r) 314), or fura-2 (M(r) 831) but did stimulate an ion conducting pathway which could be competitively permeated by Na+ or Ca2+. At 37 degrees C, BzATP treatment increased membrane permeability to NMG+, ethidium+, and fura-2, in addition to Na+ and Ca2+. These data indicate that macrophage P2z purinergic receptors can be differentially coupled to: 1) a rapidly gated cation channel, and 2) a time- and temperature-dependent formation of non-selective pores. These two permeability pathways can be distinguished by their rates of activation, ion selectivities, sensitivities to amiloride analogs, and temperature dependence."
https://openalex.org/W2041071830,"The first retinal ganglion cell axons arriving at the embryonic mouse ventral diencephalon encounter an inverted V-shaped neuronal array defining the midline and posterior boundaries of the future optic chiasm. These neurons express L1, an immunoglobulin superfamily molecule known to promote retinal axon outgrowth, and CD44, a cell surface molecule that we find inhibits embryonic retinal axon growth in vitro. Incoming retinal axons do not penetrate this L1/CD44 neuron array, but turn to establish the characteristic X-shaped optic chiasm along the anterior border of this array. These results suggest that L1/CD44 neurons may serve as an anatomical template for retinal axon pathways at the embryonic mouse ventral diencephalon."
https://openalex.org/W1519427152,"2-5A-dependent RNase (RNase L), a unique endoribonuclease that requires 5'-phosphorylated 2',5'-linked oligoadenylates (2-5A), functions in the molecular mechanism of interferon action. Because this enzyme is present at very low levels in nature, characterization and analysis have been limited. The molecular cloning of human, 2-5A-dependent RNase cDNA has facilitated its expression to high levels in insect cells by infecting with recombinant baculovirus. To determine the properties of the enzyme in the absence of other proteins, the recombinant 2-5A-dependent RNase was purified to homogeneity. The purified enzyme migrated as a monomer upon gel filtration in the absence of activator and showed highly specific, 2-5A-dependent RNase activity. The precise activator requirements were determined by stimulating the purified enzyme with a variety of 2',5'-linked oligonucleotides. The activated enzyme was capable of cleaving poly(rU) and, to a lesser extent, poly(rA), to sets of discrete products ranging from between 4 and 22 nucleotides in length. Reduced rates of 2-5A-dependent RNA cleavage were observed even after removal of ATP and chelation of divalent cations. However, optimal RNA cleavage rates required the presence of either manganese or magnesium and ATP."
https://openalex.org/W2027650800,"We have identified a novel pair rule gene in Drosophila, odd Oz (odz). Every odd-numbered body segment is deleted in odz mutant embryos. The odz gene product is strongly expressed in the embryonic central nervous system and heart, and both of these tissues are malformed in mutant embryos. Odz represents the only known pair rule gene that does not encode a transcription factor. Instead, it encodes a protein with EGF-like repeats homologous to those of the extracellular matrix protein tenascin. The protein is also a putative transmembrane tyrosine kinase substrate. On the basis of its structure, odz must act in a cellularized embryo. This is consistent with odz expression, whose temporal appearance is indicative of a very late-acting pair rule gene."
https://openalex.org/W1479710013,"The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator forms a chloride channel that is regulated by phosphorylation and intracellular ATP levels. The structure of the channel-forming domains is undetermined. To identify the residues lining this channel we substituted cysteine, one at a time, for 9 consecutive residues (91-99) in the M1 membrane-spanning segment. The cysteine substitution mutants were expressed in Xenopus oocytes. We determined the accessibility of the engineered cysteine to charged, sulfhydryl-specific methanethiosulfonate reagents added extracellularly. We assume that, among residues in membrane-spanning segments, only those lining the channel will be accessible to react with these hydrophilic reagents and that such a reaction would irreversibly alter conduction through the channel. Only the cysteines substituted for Gly-91, Lys-95, and Gln-98 were accessible to the reagents. We conclude that these residues are in the channel lining. The periodicity of these residues is consistent with an alpha-helical secondary structure."
https://openalex.org/W1557877216,"Nitric oxide (NO) is a messenger molecule of vascular endothelial cells, macrophages, and neurons. Here, we demonstrate that the activity of NO synthase increases transiently but dramatically in chick embryonic myoblasts that are competent for fusion. This activity requires Ca2+, calmodulin, and NADPH. In addition, the increase in NO synthase activity coincides with an increase in cellular cGMP level. Furthermore, NO generated by treatment with sodium nitroprusside induces precocious myoblast fusion, while treatment with NG-monomethyl-L-arginine, a competitive inhibitor of NO synthase, or methylene blue, an inhibitor of guanylate cyclase, delays fusion. These results provide the first evidence for a strong association of NO with myoblast fusion."
https://openalex.org/W1565265443,"In prion diseases, the cellular prion protein (PrPc), abundant in neurons, is converted posttranslationally into an amyloid-forming scrapie prion protein (PrPSc), which accumulates in white matter tracts and nerve terminals. The trafficking of PrPc in neurons was investigated in vivo by injecting [35S]methionine into the L4 and L5 dorsal root ganglia and the entorhinal cortices of adult rats and by tracing the movement of radiolabeled PrPc. In both paradigms, labeled 33-35-kDa PrPc was transported, within 4 h, to distal axons and nerve terminals cofractionating with proteins in the fast component. Future studies using these methods may allow us to determine whether PrPc is converted into PrpSc during axonal transport and whether PrPSc is transported in animals with prion diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1484532115,"The RNA polymerase IIO and IIA differ by the extent of phosphorylation in the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit. It has been proposed that the IIA form of RNA polymerase II interacts with the promoter to form a stable preinitiation complex whereas the IIO form would be generated upon entry into initiation of transcription. Phosphorylation of the CTD might be required to release the interaction between the polymerase and the promoter binding factors. In this paper, we show that in the presence of actinomycin D, the phosphorylated IIO form accumulates. In contrast, the dephosphorylated IIA form accumulates while the amount of phosphorylated IIo form decreases in cells treated with CTD-kinase inhibitors such as the nucleoside analog, 5,6-dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole or the isoquinoline sulfonamide derivatives H-7* or H-8. These changes are fast and suggest a very rapid phosphate turnover on the CTD. Transcription is inhibited in intact cells by drug concentrations that are effective in altering CTD phosphorylation, although no causal relationship is established yet. These effects do not concern other cellular functions such as protein synthesis. Thus isoquinoline sulfonamide derivatives might be helpful to further dissect the role of CTD phosphorylation in transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2061305204,"The biological role of RNA is delimited by its possible reactions, which can be explored by selection. A comparison of selected RNAs that bind one ligand with those that bind two related ligands suggests that a single nucleotide substitution can expand binding specificity. An RNA site with dual (joint) specificity has adenine and cytosine bases whose pKa's appear shifted upward, thereby mimicking an efficient general acid-base catalyst. The joint site also contains two conserved, looped arginine-coding triplets implicated in arginine site formation. Two selected joint RNAs are identical in some regions and distinct in others. The distinct regions, like some peptides, seem to function similarly without being similar in primary structure."
https://openalex.org/W1494220200,"Abstract The role of endogenous tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interferon-beta (IFN-beta) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced activation of the inducible nitric-oxide synthase (i-NOS) gene was investigated. By Northern analysis or reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, the mouse macrophage cell line (J774) was found to respond to LPS treatment by increased expression of mRNAs specific for TNF-alpha, IFN-beta, and i-NOS with the kinetics unique for each gene. Bioassay of the culture supernatants showed that TNF-alpha and IFN-beta secreted by J774 cells increased from an undetectable level to about 300 and 340 units/ml, respectively, 3-6 h after LPS stimulation. Nitrite concentration was found to increase from 0 to 7.8 and 28.5 microM by 12 and 24 h, respectively, in the culture supernatant of LPS-treated J774 cells. The presence of a neutralizing dose of antibodies against IFN-beta, but not against TNF-alpha, during treatment with either 10 ng or 1 microgram of LPS/ml significantly, but not completely decreased the level of i-NOS-specific mRNA expression and NO production. The incubation of J774 cells with mouse natural IFN-beta itself (up to the level of 1,200 units/ml) did not induce i-NOS-specific mRNA and therefore did not stimulate J774 cells to produce NO. However, natural IFN-beta synergistically augmented the expression of i-NOS mRNA and the production of NO by J774 cells triggered by suboptimal concentrations of LPS (1 to 5 ng/ml). These data thus suggest that endogenous IFN-beta, but not TNF-alpha, produced by LPS-stimulated J774 cells specifically contributes, probably in an auto/paracrine fashion, to the activation of the i-NOS gene expression by LPS."
https://openalex.org/W5755221,"Recent studies have shown that the synthetic peptides SFL LRN and SFL LRN PND KYEPF (thrombin receptor-activating peptides (TRAP)) derived from the deduced sequence of the new amino terminus of the cleaved thrombin receptor can mimic thrombin receptor activation, act as full agonists for platelet activation, and induce prostaglandin I2 production as well as cytosolic Ca2+ increase in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Here, we have compared the ability of these synthetic peptide ligands and thrombin to stimulate platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) production by, and monocyte adhesion to, HUVEC. Thrombin (50 units/ml) and TRAP (25 microM) maximally stimulated monocyte adhesion. Furthermore, the stimulation of E-selectin cell surface expression and the steady-state E-selectin mRNA levels by thrombin and TRAP were comparable. Thrombin (50 units/ml) stimulated PDGF production 400% above the basal level in 24 h, whereas the 6-mer and 14-mer TRAP, even at 200 microM, did not significantly stimulate PDGF production. Northern analysis, however, revealed that TRAP at 100 microM stimulated PDGF-A and -B chain mRNA expression to a level similar to that induced by thrombin. These results suggest that activation of cell signaling by TRAP can mimic thrombin and is sufficient for the stimulation of monocyte adhesion to HUVEC; however, thrombin-stimulated PDGF production by HUVEC may require mechanisms in addition to the signaling events initiated by TRAP or may require the participation of a novel thrombin receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1585747919,"Human serum macrophage-stimulating protein (MSP) is a disulfide-linked heterodimer that induces motile and phagocytic activity of mouse resident peritoneal macrophages. In this work, we found that MSP blocked the increase in macrophage nitric oxide synthase mRNA, as well as the associated increase in nitric oxide production, that occurred in response to several stimuli. These included bacterial products and mammalian cytokines: endotoxin, and interferon-gamma plus endotoxin, interleukin-2, or tumor necrosis factor-alpha. The inhibition by MSP of induction of nitric oxide synthase mRNA and nitric oxide secretion was concentration-dependent. The concentration of MSP that caused maximal inhibition of nitric oxide production was comparable with the optimum for stimulation of macrophage motile and phagocytic activity. Time course studies showed that nitrite was first detected in culture fluid about 8 h after endotoxin stimulation, and it accumulated at a linear rate during the ensuing 16 h. Inhibition by MSP occurred during the 8-h lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induction period; inhibition was maximal when MSP and LPS were added together and decreased progressively to no inhibition as the interval between LPS and MSP addition increased to 11 h."
https://openalex.org/W1563769786,"Fibroblast growth factors (FGF) stimulate growth arrest and differentiation in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells. We examined the role of phosphatidylinositol (PI) hydrolysis in FGF-induced differentiation of PC12 cells by exploring the biological and biochemical activity of a mutant FGF receptor 1 (flg) defective in stimulation of PI hydrolysis. We show that point mutation at Tyr-766 (Y766F) of the FGF receptor prevents tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C gamma and eliminates acidic FGF (aFGF)-induced stimulation of PI hydrolysis in PC12 cells. Treatment of PC12 cells expressing either wild-type or the Y766F mutant with aFGF led to tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc, the association of Shc with GRB2, a shift in the electrophoretic mobility of the Ras guanine nucleotide-releasing factor, Sos (son of sevenless), and enhancement in mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation. Moreover, stimulation with aFGF led to a typical neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells expressing either wild-type or the Y766F FGF receptor mutant. These experiments indicate that PI hydrolysis is not essential for FGF-induced neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells. Moreover, the aFGF-induced Ras signaling pathway, which is essential for PC12 cell differentiation, is not affected by elimination of PI hydrolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1507986200,"Based on presently available information on the structure of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase, peptides have been synthesized which correspond to the sequence of a particular region of the protein involved in formation of the active heterodimeric form of the enzyme. Several peptides that are 15-19 amino acids long and that are derived from the so-called connection domain of the reverse transcriptase are able to inhibit dimerization of the enzyme and thus inhibit development of its enzymatic activities. In particular, a tryptophan-rich 19-mer corresponding to residues 389-407 was relatively efficient, showing an apparent dissociation constant in the micromolar range for one or both of the subunits. The sequence of this region is identical for both subunits, since one (molecular mass of 51 kDa) is the proteolytic product of the other (molecular mass of 66 kDa). Dissociation of the preformed heterodimer could not be induced by the peptides, but increasing concentrations reduced the rate of dimerization in a concentration-dependent manner until it became immeasurable at high concentrations. The results suggest that inhibition of dimerization of reverse transcriptase is an attractive approach to chemotherapeutic intervention in HIV infection and that further development of peptide-based inhibition strategies is worth pursuing."
https://openalex.org/W1521056506,"The low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related protein, which serves as the cell surface receptor for several proteins including alpha 2-macroglobulin-protease complexes, has been proposed to be a candidate hepatocytic receptor for chylomicron remnants through its recognition of apolipoprotein E. We have studied the effect of two ligands for this receptor, activated alpha 2-macroglobulin and the recently described 39-kDa protein that copurifies with the LDL receptor-related protein (receptor-associated protein), on the uptake and endocytosis of chylomicrons in intact rats and in isolated, perfused rat livers. Both of these ligands were rapidly taken up and endocytosed into the liver of rats. Chylomicrons from normal rats were injected in vivo and chylomicrons from estradiol-treated rats that were enriched in apolipoprotein E were added to liver perfusates. Prior administration of amounts of activated alpha 2-macroglobulin that saturated hepatic uptake mechanisms did not inhibit hepatic uptake or endocytosis of endogenously labeled cholesteryl esters of chylomicron particles in vivo or in perfused livers over a period of 15 min. By contrast, prior administration of saturating amounts of the receptor-associated protein (expressed in bacteria as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase) reduced hepatic uptake by about 30% and virtually abolished endocytosis. The receptor-associated protein inhibited hepatic uptake of human LDL in vivo by 70% and endocytosis by 81%. Our results show that receptor-associated protein-sensitive processes predominate in the overall pathways by which chylomicron remnants are endocytosed by rat liver. Furthermore, they show that the receptor-associated protein binds to and inhibits the function of the LDL receptor as well as the LDL receptor-related protein."
https://openalex.org/W1819133532,"Increased cerebral levels of the endogenous excitotoxin quinolinic acid (QUIN) have been speculatively linked to neuronal damage following neurological and inflammatory disorders. 3-Hydroxyanthranilic-acid dioxygenase (3-HAO; 3-hydroxyanthranilate 3,4-dioxygenase, EC 1.13.11.6) is the enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of QUIN from 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid, and evidence suggests that it could play a role in disorders associated with altered tissue levels of QUIN. In this report, we describe the isolation of a full-length cDNA clone encoding human 3-HAO (h3-HAO). Degenerate oligonucleotides were designed from the amino acid sequences of tryptic peptides of rat liver 3-HAO, and they were used as primers for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction of rat liver RNA. The resulting rat cDNA product was used to screen a human hepatoma cell line (HepG2) cDNA library and to isolate a human 3-HAO cDNA clone. This clone was found to have an insert of 1276 nucleotides. The deduced primary structure of h3-HAO is composed of 286 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of approximately 32.6 kDa. The human sequence exhibits high similarity (94%) to the rat partial amino acid sequence deduced from the rat reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction fragment. Insertion of the h3-HAO coding sequence into a eukaryotic expression vector yielded relatively high amounts of the active enzyme in human embryonic kidney HEK-293 cells. The Km value of 3-HANA for recombinant h3-HAO (approximately 2 microM) was in good agreement with that reported for the native enzyme. Immunoblot analysis of recombinant h3-HAO revealed a polypeptide with an apparent molecular mass of 32 kDa, as predicted from the deduced amino acid sequence. RNA blot analysis of human liver and HepG2 cells revealed one major species of h3-HAO mRNA of approximately 1.3 kilobases."
https://openalex.org/W2148606192,"Cross-regulation from the stimulatory phospholipase C to the adenylyl cyclase pathways was explored in neuroblastoma-glioma NG-108-15 cells in culture. Activation of protein kinase C by phorbol myristic acid resulted in a markedly attenuated activation of the inhibitory adenylyl cyclase response to delta-opiate agonists and epinephrine but not to the muscarinic agonist carbachol. The ability of okadaic acid to mimic the effects of phorbol myristic acid on the inhibitory response suggested a role for protein phosphorylation. Adenylyl cyclase activity from cells in which protein kinase C had been activated demonstrated a loss in the inhibitory adenylyl cyclase response at the level of the G-protein. Activation of protein kinase C prompted a 2-4-fold increase in phosphorylation of G1 alpha 2 in cells metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate. The phosphate content of Gi alpha 2 was determined to be approximately 0.5 mol/mol subunit in the unstimulated cells and approximately 1.5 mol/mol subunit for cells in which protein kinase C was activated. The effects of okadaic acid, 4-alpha-phorbol, and calphostin C on inhibition of adenylyl cyclase in cells treated with phorbol myristic acid correlate with the effects of these agents on phosphorylation of Gi alpha 2. The time courses for attenuation of inhibitory adenylyl cyclase and that for phosphorylation of Gi alpha 2 were similar in cells challenged with phorbol myristic acid. These data argue for cross-regulation from the stimulatory protein kinase C to inhibitory adenylyl cyclase pathways at the level of Gi alpha 2 via protein phosphorylation."

In the present study, we describe the inhibition of L- and P-selectin function by inositol polyanions, simple 6-carbon ring structures that have multiple ester-linked phosphate or sulfate groups. In a purified component competition assay, binding of L- and P-selectin-Ig fusion proteins to immobilized bovine serum albumin-sialyl Lewisx neoglycoprotein was inhibited by inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP6, IC50 = 2.1 +/- 1.4 microM and 160 +/- 40 microM), by inositol pentakisphosphate (InsP5, IC50 = 1.4 +/- 0.2 and 260 +/- 40 microM), and by inositol hexakissulfate (InsS6, IC50 = 210 +/- 80 microM and 2.8 +/- 0.9 mM); E-selectin-Ig binding was unaffected. Inositol polyanions diminished the adhesion of LS180 colon carcinoma cells to plates coated with L- and P-selectin-Ig but not with E-selectin-Ig. Inositol polyanions blocked polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) adhesion to COS cells expressing recombinant transmembrane P-selectin but not to those expressing E-selectin. In addition, inositol polyanions diminished PMN adhesion to activated endothelial cells under rotation-induced shear stress, a process known to require L-selectin function. In vivo, the effects of inositol polyanions were studied in two murine models of acute inflammation. Intravenously administered InsP6 (two doses of 40 mumol/kg) inhibited PMN accumulation in thioglycolate-induced inflammation (55 +/- 10% inhibition) and in zymosan-induced inflammation (61 +/- 4% inhibition). InsP5 and InsS6 also inhibited inflammation in these models, although higher doses were required for InsS6. In conclusion, inositol polyanions are noncarbohydrate small molecules that inhibit L- and P-selectin function in vitro and inflammation in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1536788913,"The epithelium of the pulmonary alveolus is a major target for oxidant injury, and its proper repair following injury is dependent on the proliferative response of its stem cells, the type 2 cells. We have recently shown that hyperoxia arrests proliferation of an immortalized type 2 cell line (SV40T-T2) and that expression of several growth-related genes, normally induced near the G1/S and boundary was altered with a block of translation of their mRNA. In the present study we examined the possible role of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system and of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) in the arrest of proliferation induced by hyperoxia. We show that IGF-binding protein 2 (IGFBP-2) accumulates to higher levels in culture medium of SV40T-T2 cells whose proliferation has been arrested by hyperoxia. This proliferation arrest is associated with increased expression of IGFBP-2 mRNA and with induction of type 2 IGF receptor and IGF-II mRNAs. When O2-arrested cells were allowed to resume proliferation in normoxia, the level of expression of these genes rapidly decreased to control levels. We also, found that TGF-beta 1 was induced by O2 exposure, that TGF-beta 1 inhibited SV40T-T2 proliferation, and that TGF-beta 1 itself was a potent stimulator of IGFBP-2 expression. These studies suggest a regulatory link between components of the IGF system and TGF-beta 1 in hyperoxic control of cell proliferation of alveolar epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1590119505,"The role of transforming growth factor beta as a mediator of the fibrogenic effect of bleomycin in lung has been investigated at the transcriptional level. Several constructs containing the rat pro-alpha 1 (I) collagen promoter fused to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene were transfected into rat lung fibroblasts. Both bleomycin and transforming growth factor beta 1 increased promoter activity in fibroblasts transfected with constructs containing the transforming growth factor beta response element. Fibroblasts transfected with a deletion construct that lacks this response element did not respond to either bleomycin or transforming growth factor beta 1. Anti-transforming growth factor beta 1-neutralizing antibodies did not block the increase in promoter activity induced by bleomycin, suggesting intracellular signaling. Mutation of the transforming growth factor beta response element greatly reduced the bleomycin effect, which also infers intracellular signaling. In addition, plasmin added to the media greatly enhanced bleomycin stimulation of promoter activity demonstrating that transforming growth factor beta mediates the bleomycin effect through extracellular signaling."

Photolabeling of purified bovine brain calcineurin with the affinity label [O-[4-[4-(1-diazo-2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)benzoyl]aminobutanoyl]-D- serine8]cyclosporin in the presence of cyclophilin A results, in addition to the labeling of cyclophilin itself, in the transfer of some of the chemical probe to both the catalytic subunit A and the regulatory subunit B of calcineurin. Chemical cross-linking studies with disuccinimidyl suberate in the presence of either cyclophilin A, B, or C in complex with cyclosporin A or FK506 binding protein-FK506 result on the other hand in the apparently exclusive and strictly immunosuppressant-dependent formation of covalent immunophilin-calcineurin B subunit products. Cross-linking of immunophilins to calcineurin B subunit requires the presence of subunit A. In the present study, using a set of recombinant maltose-binding protein fusion products representing different stretches of the catalytic subunit A, we were able to map the minimal calcineurin A sequence necessary for immunophilin-ligand-calcineurin B interaction to occur."
https://openalex.org/W1592901199,"The signal transduction mechanism of protein kinase FA/GSK-3 alpha by tyrosine phosphorylation in A431 cells was investigated. Kinase FA/GSK-3 alpha was found to exist in a highly tyrosine-phosphorylated/activated state in resting cells but could be tyrosine-dephosphorylated and inactivated down to less than 15% of control values in a concentration-dependent manner by 50-400 nM okadaic acid (a specific inhibitor of protein phosphatase types 1 and 2A), as demonstrated by metabolic 32P labeling the cells, followed by immunoprecipitation and two-dimensional phosphoamino acid analysis and by immunodetection in an anti-kinase FA/GSK-3 alpha immunoprecipitate kinase assay. Taken together, the results provide initial evidence that serine/threonine phosphatase(s) may play a role involved in the modulation of kinase FA/GSK-3 alpha activity in cells, suggesting an involvement of serine/threonine dephosphorylation in the modulation of tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of protein kinase FA/GSK-3 alpha, representing a new mode of signal transduction pathway for the regulation of this multisubstrate protein kinase in cells."
https://openalex.org/W1567981493,"The interaction of several basic peptides with yeast mitochondria has been analyzed. The peptides were selected for their ability to block a cationic channel of the outer membrane, the peptide-sensitive channel. These peptides possess common characteristics, such as a net positive charge superior to 2 and the capacity to form amphiphilic structures. They can be divided into two classes as follows: peptides of class I derived from mitochondrial signal peptides, such as the presequence of cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV, e.g. pCyt OX IV (1-12) Y; and peptides of class II unrelated to the mitochondria, such as dynorphin B (1-13). Class I peptides inhibited the translocation of a chimeric protein, cytochrome b2-DHFR, into the mitochondrial matrix, whereas peptides of class II failed to inhibit this import. Experiments with iodinated pCyt OX IV (1-12) Y and dynorphin B (1-13) showed, however, that both types of peptides were imported into yeast mitochondria in vitro and subsequently degraded. At 30 degrees C, two import mechanisms could be distinguished; the mitochondrial presequences (class I) were translocated into the matrix in a temperature- and potential-sensitive manner, probably along the general import pathway, while class II dynorphin B (1-13) was imported into the intermembrane space by a process that was neither temperature- nor potential-sensitive. At 0 degree C, both peptides were imported in a class II manner. The class II characteristics suggested the existence of a direct pathway into the intermembrane space, which may be associated with the peptide-sensitive channel. This hypothesis is substantiated by the competition for the import into the mitochondria between peptides of the two classes. The import of pCyt OX (1-12) Y was inhibited at 30 degrees C only by peptides of class I, IV whereas, at 0 degree C, this import was also inhibited by peptides of class II. Import of peptides of the latter class was inhibited by peptides of the two classes both at 0 degree C and 30 degrees C."
https://openalex.org/W1509766317,"Bacteriophage T4 DNA polymerase, product of phage gene 43 (gp43), is a multifunctional DNA-binding protein and a key component of the phage DNA replicase. It is also an RNA-binding protein that selectively recognizes a site on its mRNA (the translational operator) and represses its own translation. We examined the ability of the protein to discriminate between DNA and RNA by using a gel mobility shift assay with defined RNA and DNA substrates. A higher affinity to RNA as compared with DNA (about 100-fold) was observed in assays that utilized synthetic DNA and in vitro transcribed RNA substrates bearing the T4 gene 43 translational operator sequence. The replacement of thymine with uracil in the synthetic DNA did not improve binding. The results suggest that the protein's selectivity for RNA is based in structure (intramolecular interactions) specific to the ribonucleotide sequence of the operator. Competition studies suggest that the protein determinants for RNA and DNA recognition are only partially overlapping."

It consists of single-stranded DNA that is linked to an internal G residue of an RNA molecule by a 2‘,5‘-phosphodiester linkage. It has been demonstrated that specific primary sequences, as well as the secondary structures immediately downstream of the G residue, are essential for the cDNA priming reaction (Shimamoto, T., Hsu, M.-Y., Inouye, S., and Inouye, M. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 2684-2692). We have now examined the requirement of the structures in the region corresponding to DNA for msDNA synthesis. The upper stem region consisting of 71 bases of msDNA-Ec107 was found not to be essential, and this region could be deleted to efficiently produce a truncated msDNA containing only a 36-base single-stranded DNA. Various mutations including base replacements, deletions, and insertions were constructed in the lower stem region. It was found that any mutations resulting in more stable secondary structures caused reduction in msDNA synthesis. The results indicated that reverse transcriptase requires a loose secondary structure in the template RNA near the cDNA priming site for cDNA elongation."
