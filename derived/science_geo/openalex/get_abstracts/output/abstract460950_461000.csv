https://openalex.org/W2017986009,"A Twist on the Capacity Crunch The rate at which data can be transmitted down optic fibers is approaching a limit because of nonlinear optical effects. Multiplexing allows data to be encoded in different modes of light such as polarization, wavelength, amplitude, and phase and to be sent down the fibers in parallel. Optical angular momentum (OAM) can provide another degree of freedom whereby the photons are given a well-defined twist or helicity. Bozinovic et al. (p. 1545 ) were able to transmit high-bandwidth data using OAM modes in long lengths of optical fibers, thus providing a possible route to get yet more capacity through optic fiber networks."

We used multiple genetically engineered mice to track, fate map and ablate cells to determine the source and function of myofibroblasts in kidney fibrosis. Through this comprehensive analysis, we identified that the total pool of myofibroblasts is split, with 50% arising from local resident fibroblasts through proliferation. The nonproliferating myofibroblasts derive through differentiation from bone marrow (35%), the endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition program (10%) and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition program (5%). Specific deletion of Tgfbr2 in α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA)(+) cells revealed the importance of this pathway in the recruitment of myofibroblasts through differentiation. Using genetic mouse models and a fate-mapping strategy, we determined that vascular pericytes probably do not contribute to the emergence of myofibroblasts or fibrosis. Our data suggest that targeting diverse pathways is required to substantially inhibit the composite accumulation of myofibroblasts in kidney fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2016923091,"Vitamin C is a direct regulator of Tet enzyme activity and DNA methylation fidelity in mouse ES cells; addition of vitamin C promotes Tet activity, increases 5-hydroxymethlycytosine (5hmC) and DNA demethylation of many gene promoters, upregulates demethylated germline genes, and induces a state that more closely approximates that of the inner cell mass of the blastocyst. The Tet enzymes regulate DNA methylation by converting 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and other oxidized variants. Here vitamin C, a cofactor of enzymes of the same family as the Tets, is shown to be a direct regulator of Tet activity in mouse embryonic stem cells, which are typically cultured in the absence of vitamin C. Addition of vitamin C to the culture medium leads to increased 5hmC content and the demethylation of numerous gene promoters. The remodelled DNA methylation and gene expression patterns resemble the DNA demethylation that occurs in the inner cell mass of the early embryo. DNA methylation is a heritable epigenetic modification involved in gene silencing, imprinting, and the suppression of retrotransposons1. Global DNA demethylation occurs in the early embryo and the germ line2,3, and may be mediated by Tet (ten eleven translocation) enzymes4,5,6, which convert 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC)7. Tet enzymes have been studied extensively in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells8,9,10,11,12, which are generally cultured in the absence of vitamin C, a potential cofactor for Fe(ii) 2-oxoglutarate dioxygenase enzymes such as Tet enzymes. Here we report that addition of vitamin C to mouse ES cells promotes Tet activity, leading to a rapid and global increase in 5hmC. This is followed by DNA demethylation of many gene promoters and upregulation of demethylated germline genes. Tet1 binding is enriched near the transcription start site of genes affected by vitamin C treatment. Importantly, vitamin C, but not other antioxidants, enhances the activity of recombinant Tet1 in a biochemical assay, and the vitamin-C-induced changes in 5hmC and 5mC are entirely suppressed in Tet1 and Tet2 double knockout ES cells. Vitamin C has a stronger effect on regions that gain methylation in cultured ES cells compared to blastocysts, and in vivo are methylated only after implantation. In contrast, imprinted regions and intracisternal A particle retroelements, which are resistant to demethylation in the early embryo2,13, are resistant to vitamin-C-induced DNA demethylation. Collectively, the results of this study establish vitamin C as a direct regulator of Tet activity and DNA methylation fidelity in ES cells."

The enzymes can form large complexes, known as supercomplexes, whose function has been controversial. Lapuente-Brun et al. (p. 1567 ) discovered that a mouse protein, supercomplex assembly factor I (SCAFI), specifically modulates assembly of respiratory complexes into supercomplexes. Formation of the supercomplexes appears to cause electrons to be processed differently, depending on the substrate from which they are derived."
https://openalex.org/W2073025161,"The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway integrates diverse environmental inputs, including immune signals and metabolic cues, to direct T-cell fate decisions. The activation of mTOR, which is the catalytic subunit of the mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes, delivers an obligatory signal for the proper activation and differentiation of effector CD4(+) T cells, whereas in the regulatory T-cell (T(reg)) compartment, the Akt-mTOR axis is widely acknowledged as a crucial negative regulator of T(reg)-cell de novo differentiation and population expansion. However, whether mTOR signalling affects the homeostasis and function of T(reg) cells remains largely unexplored. Here we show that mTORC1 signalling is a pivotal positive determinant of T(reg)-cell function in mice. T(reg) cells have elevated steady-state mTORC1 activity compared to naive T cells. Signals through the T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) provide major inputs for mTORC1 activation, which in turn programs the suppressive function of T(reg) cells. Disruption of mTORC1 through Treg-specific deletion of the essential component raptor leads to a profound loss of T(reg)-cell suppressive activity in vivo and the development of a fatal early onset inflammatory disorder. Mechanistically, raptor/mTORC1 signalling in T(reg) cells promotes cholesterol and lipid metabolism, with the mevalonate pathway particularly important for coordinating T(reg)-cell proliferation and upregulation of the suppressive molecules CTLA4 and ICOS to establish Treg-cell functional competency. By contrast, mTORC1 does not directly affect the expression of Foxp3 or anti- and pro-inflammatory cytokines in T(reg) cells, suggesting a non-conventional mechanism for T(reg)-cell functional regulation. Finally, we provide evidence that mTORC1 maintains T(reg)-cell function partly through inhibiting the mTORC2 pathway. Our results demonstrate that mTORC1 acts as a fundamental 'rheostat' in T(reg) cells to link immunological signals from TCR and IL-2 to lipogenic pathways and functional fitness, and highlight a central role of metabolic programming of T(reg)-cell suppressive activity in immune homeostasis and tolerance."

https://openalex.org/W2041918412,"A Direct Line in the Brain For decades, neuroscientists have assumed that there is a “canonical microcircuit” in the neo cortex, in which information is transformed as excitation spreads serially along connections from thalamus, to cortical layer 4, then to layers 2/3, to layers 5/6, and finally to other brain regions. Each cortical layer is thought to transform sensory signals to extract behaviorally relevant information. Now, Constantinople and Bruno (p. 1591 ) challenge this dogma. In vivo whole-cell recordings revealed that sensory stimuli activate neurons in deep cortical layers simultaneously to those in layer 4 and that a large number of thalamic neurons converge onto deep pyramidal neurons, possibly allowing sensory information to completely bypass upper layers. Temporary blockade of layer 4 revealed that synaptic input to deep cortical layers derived entirely from the thalamus and not at all from upper cortical layers. This thalamically derived synaptic input reliably drove pyramidal neurons in layer 5 to discharge action potentials in the living animal. These deep layer neurons project to numerous higher-order brain regions and could directly mediate behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2015664999,"Both the Haber-Bosch and biological ammonia syntheses are thought to rely on the cooperation of multiple metals in breaking the strong N≡N triple bond and forming an N-H bond. This has spurred investigations of the reactivity of molecular multimetallic hydrides with dinitrogen. We report here the reaction of a trinuclear titanium polyhydride complex with dinitrogen, which induces dinitrogen cleavage and partial hydrogenation at ambient temperature and pressure. By (1)H and (15)N nuclear magnetic resonance, x-ray crystallographic, and computational studies of some key reaction steps and products, we have determined that the dinitrogen (N2) reduction proceeds sequentially through scission of a N2 molecule bonded to three Ti atoms in a μ-η(1):η(2):η(2)-end-on-side-on fashion to give a μ2-N/μ3-N dinitrido species, followed by intramolecular hydrogen migration from Ti to the μ2-N nitrido unit."

https://openalex.org/W1965232467,"The authors show that optogenetic inhibition of inputs from medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) or insula to the nucleus accumbens core (NAcore) inhibits aversion-resistant alcohol intake. Alcohol-drinking rats showed increased hyperpolarization-active NMDARs at mPFC and insula inputs to NAcore medium spiny neurons. Knocking down these receptors in the NAcore inhibited aversion-resistant alcohol intake. Compulsive drinking despite serious adverse medical, social and economic consequences is a characteristic of alcohol use disorders in humans. Although frontal cortical areas have been implicated in alcohol use disorders, little is known about the molecular mechanisms and pathways that sustain aversion-resistant intake. Here, we show that nucleus accumbens core (NAcore) NMDA-type glutamate receptors and medial prefrontal (mPFC) and insula glutamatergic inputs to the NAcore are necessary for aversion-resistant alcohol consumption in rats. Aversion-resistant intake was associated with a new type of NMDA receptor adaptation, in which hyperpolarization-active NMDA receptors were present at mPFC and insula but not amygdalar inputs in the NAcore. Accordingly, inhibition of Grin2c NMDA receptor subunits in the NAcore reduced aversion-resistant alcohol intake. None of these manipulations altered intake when alcohol was not paired with an aversive consequence. Our results identify a mechanism by which hyperpolarization-active NMDA receptors under mPFC- and insula-to-NAcore inputs sustain aversion-resistant alcohol intake."
https://openalex.org/W2093777918,"Keeping Transcription Going In cells, the DNA double-stranded helix (dsDNA) is mostly supercoiled—either under- or overwound. RNA polymerase (RNAP) must transcribe though this supercoiled DNA. Furthermore, the act of transcription, which involves opening the double helix and threading the separated strands through the enzyme, generates supercoiling ahead and behind the polymerase. Ma et al. (p. 1580 ) used single-molecule methods to measure the upstream and downstream torque forces of Escherichia coli RNAP. The upstream torque was sufficient to disrupt dsDNA structure, and the stalled RNAP could also backtrack along the DNA. Release of the torsional stress allowed RNAP to resume transcription in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1986799557,"Studies of ETS-mediated prostate oncogenesis have been hampered by a lack of suitable experimental systems. Here we describe a new conditional mouse model that shows robust, homogenous ERG expression throughout the prostate. When combined with homozygous Pten loss, the mice developed accelerated, highly penetrant invasive prostate cancer. In mouse prostate tissue, ERG markedly increased androgen receptor (AR) binding. Robust ERG-mediated transcriptional changes, observed only in the setting of Pten loss, included the restoration of AR transcriptional output and upregulation of genes involved in cell death, migration, inflammation and angiogenesis. Similarly, ETS variant 1 (ETV1) positively regulated the AR cistrome and transcriptional output in ETV1-translocated, PTEN-deficient human prostate cancer cells. In two large clinical cohorts, expression of ERG and ETV1 correlated with higher AR transcriptional output in PTEN-deficient prostate cancer specimens. We propose that ETS factors cause prostate-specific transformation by altering the AR cistrome, priming the prostate epithelium to respond to aberrant upstream signals such as PTEN loss."
https://openalex.org/W2034836118,"Desert Soil Shuffle Soil microorganisms make up a substantial fraction of global biomass, turning over carbon and other key nutrients on a massive scale. Although the soil protects them somewhat from daily temperature fluxes, the distribution of these communities will likely respond to gradual climate change. Garcia-Pichel et al. (p. 1574 , see the cover; see the Perspective by Belnap ) surveyed bacterial diversity across a range of North American desert soils, or biocrusts—ecosystems in which photosynthetic bacteria determine soil fertility and control physical soil properties such as erodability and water retention. Most of the sites were dominated by one of two cyanobacterial species, but their relative proportions were controlled largely by factors related to temperature. Laboratory enrichment cultures of the two species at different temperatures also showed temperature as a primary determining factor of bacterial diversity. It is unknown if temperature will affect the distribution of other soil microorganisms, but the marked shifts of these two keystone bacterial species suggest further change is in store for these delicate ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W2009185547,"Translocation of messenger and transfer RNA (mRNA and tRNA) through the ribosome is a crucial step in protein synthesis, whose mechanism is not yet understood. The crystal structures of three Thermus ribosome-tRNA-mRNA-EF-G complexes trapped with β,γ-imidoguanosine 5'-triphosphate (GDPNP) or fusidic acid reveal conformational changes occurring during intermediate states of translocation, including large-scale rotation of the 30S subunit head and body. In all complexes, the tRNA acceptor ends occupy the 50S subunit E site, while their anticodon stem loops move with the head of the 30S subunit to positions between the P and E sites, forming chimeric intermediate states. Two universally conserved bases of 16S ribosomal RNA that intercalate between bases of the mRNA may act as ""pawls"" of a translocational ratchet. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of ribosomal translocation."
https://openalex.org/W2007061166,"Water at the Bottom of a Well Earthquakes generate numerous fractures as they propagate through an underground fault zone. These fractures strongly influence the way in which fluids flow in the subsurface, and the permeability of fault zones is often used as a proxy for the extent of fracturing. Following the 2008 M w 7.9 Wenchuan earthquake in central China, several wells were drilled in and around the fault zone to understand the mechanics of the earthquake. Because the bottoms of these deep boreholes were open, the water levels in the wells were sensitive to tidal forces acting on the surrounding rock. Through continuous measurements of water levels over 1.5 years, Xue et al. (p. 1555 ) found that the rate at which water was pumped in and out of the borehole was proportional to the permeability of the fault zone, providing a direct way to measure the evolution of the hydrologic properties of a fault zone following a major earthquake. Permeability decreased ∼25% during that time, suggesting that fractures generated in fault zones heal relatively rapidly."

https://openalex.org/W1966863706,"Unreactive Death A controversial proposal that all bactericidal antibiotics kill by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and not by their primary cell target has recently attracted high-profile refutations. The ROS-death pathway implicated overstimulation of the electron transport in respiratory chains; a malfunction that leads to ROS releasing Fe from Fe-S clusters and causing cell death via Fenton chemistry. Ezraty et al. (p. 1583 ) show that electron transport chains and Fe-S clusters are key to killing by aminoglycoside antibiotics but not for the reasons envisioned in the ROS theory. Fe-S clusters are essential for killing because they mature the respiratory chains that produce the necessary proton motive force for the energized uptake of aminoglycosides. Consequently, iron chelators protect against aminoglycosides, not because they scavenge the iron from Fenton chemistry, but because they block aminoglycoside uptake."
https://openalex.org/W2077144885,"The construction of cerebral cortex begins with the formation of radial glia. Once formed, polarized radial glial cells divide either symmetrically or asymmetrically to balance appropriate production of progenitor cells and neurons. Following birth, neurons use the processes of radial glia as scaffolding for oriented migration. Radial glia therefore provide an instructive structural matrix to coordinate the generation and placement of distinct groups of cortical neurons in the developing cerebral cortex. We found that Arl13b, a cilia-enriched small GTPase that is mutated in Joubert syndrome, was critical for the initial formation of the polarized radial progenitor scaffold. Using developmental stage-specific deletion of Arl13b in mouse cortical progenitors, we found that early neuroepithelial deletion of ciliary Arl13b led to a reversal of the apical-basal polarity of radial progenitors and aberrant neuronal placement. Arl13b modulated ciliary signaling necessary for radial glial polarity. Our findings indicate that Arl13b signaling in primary cilia is crucial for the initial formation of a polarized radial glial scaffold and suggest that disruption of this process may contribute to aberrant neurodevelopment and brain abnormalities in Joubert syndrome-related ciliopathies."

https://openalex.org/W2020055579,"Stopping Transcription It is as important to terminate any biological process as it is to start it. Transcription, copying information encoded in genes into RNA, requires accurate and timely termination. Nielsen et al. (p. 1577 ) present a mechanism for transcription termination by RNA polymerase III, the enzyme that synthesizes the majority of RNA molecules in eukaryotes. In this scenario, the folding of the RNA as it is transcribed by polymerase into a highly structured transcript causes termination at the end of its synthesis. This mechanism may serve as a control of proper folding of structural or catalytic RNAs synthesized by RNA polymerase III. Comparison with other organisms suggests that this mechanism emerged before divergence of bacteria and eukaryotes."

https://openalex.org/W2004939067,"Using a retrovirus-mediated cDNA expression cloning approach, we identified the grainyhead-like 2 (GRHL2) transcription factor as novel protooncogene. Overexpression of GRHL2 in NIH3T3 cells induced striking morphological changes, an increase in cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, and tumor growth in vivo. By combining a microarray analysis and a phylogenetic footprinting analysis with various biochemical assays, we identified the epidermal growth factor receptor family member Erbb3 as a novel GRHL2 target gene. In breast cancer cell lines, shRNA-mediated knockdown of GRHL2 expression or functional inactivation of GRHL2 using dominant negative GRHL2 proteins induces down-regulation of ERBB3 gene expression, a striking reduction in cell proliferation, and morphological and phenotypical alterations characteristic of an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), thus implying contradictory roles of GRHL2 in breast carcinogenesis. Interestingly, we could further demonstrate that expression of GRHL2 is directly suppressed by the transcription factor zinc finger enhancer-binding protein 1 (ZEB1), which in turn is a direct target for repression by GRHL2, suggesting that the EMT transcription factors GRHL2 and ZEB1 form a double negative regulatory feedback loop in breast cancer cells. Finally, a comprehensive immunohistochemical analysis of GRHL2 expression in primary breast cancers showed loss of GRHL2 expression at the invasive front of primary tumors. A pathophysiological relevance of GRHL2 in breast cancer metastasis is further demonstrated by our finding of a statistically significant association between loss of GRHL2 expression in primary breast cancers and lymph node metastasis. We thus demonstrate a crucial role of GRHL2 in breast carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2111626297,"The role of glucocorticoids in the inhibition of estrogen (17-β-estradiol (E2))-regulated estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer cell proliferation is well established. We and others have seen that synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone (Dex) antagonizes E2-stimulated endogenous ERα target gene expression. However, how glucocorticoids negatively regulate the ERα signaling pathway is still poorly understood. ChIP studies using ERα- and glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-positive MCF-7 cells revealed that GR occupies several ERα-binding regions (EBRs) in cells treated with E2 and Dex simultaneously. Interestingly, there was little or no GR loading to these regions when cells were treated with E2 or Dex alone. The E2+Dex-dependent GR recruitment is associated with the displacement of ERα and steroid receptor coactivator-3 from the target EBRs leading to the repression of ERα-mediated transcriptional activation. The recruitment of GR to EBRs requires assistance from ERα and FOXA1 and is facilitated by AP1 binding within the EBRs. The GR binding to EBRs is mediated via direct protein-protein interaction between the GR DNA-binding domain and ERα. Limited mutational analyses indicate that arginine 488 located within the C-terminal zinc finger domain of the GR DNA-binding domain plays a critical role in stabilizing this interaction. Together, the results of this study unravel a novel mechanism involved in glucocorticoid inhibition of ERα transcriptional activity and E2-mediated cell proliferation and thus establish a foundation for future exploitation of the GR signaling pathway in the treatment of ER-positive breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2035434033,"Liver receptor homolog-1 is an orphan nuclear receptor. Murphy and colleagues now show that this protein is crucial for different phases of pregnancy, including implantation and maintenance of the developing fetus, in mice, as well as for the proper function of human endometrial cells in culture. Successful pregnancy requires coordination of an array of signals and factors from multiple tissues. One such element, liver receptor homolog-1 (Lrh-1), is an orphan nuclear receptor that regulates metabolism and hormone synthesis1. It is strongly expressed in granulosa cells of ovarian follicles and in the corpus luteum of rodents2 and humans. Germline ablation of Nr5a2 (also called Lrh-1), the gene coding for Lrh-1, in mice is embryonically lethal at gastrulation3. Depletion of Lrh-1 in the ovarian follicle shows that it regulates genes required for both steroid synthesis and ovulation4. To study the effects of Lrh-1 on mouse gestation, we genetically disrupted its expression in the corpus luteum, resulting in luteal insufficiency. Hormone replacement permitted embryo implantation but was followed by gestational failure with impaired endometrial decidualization, compromised placental formation, fetal growth retardation and fetal death. Lrh-1 is also expressed in the mouse and human endometrium, and in a primary culture of human endometrial stromal cells, reduction of NR5A2 transcript abundance by RNA interference abrogated decidualization. These findings show that Lrh-1 is necessary for maintenance of the corpus luteum, for promotion of decidualization and for formation of the placenta. It therefore has multiple, indispensible roles in establishing and sustaining pregnancy."

Identification and characterization of a novel collectin CL-K1.Microbiol. Immunol. 2006; 50: 1001-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). CL-P1 is a membrane protein resembling scavenger receptors (9.Ohtani K. Suzuki Y. Wakamiya N. Biological function of the novel collectins CL-L1, CL-K1, and CL-P1.J. Biomed. Biotechnol. 2012; 2012: 493945-493953Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). CL-K1 is a soluble protein found in serum at a median concentration of 284 ng/ml (9.Ohtani K. Suzuki Y. Wakamiya N.

It was shown that CL-K1 associates with MASPs and might therefore be an activator of the lectin pathway (11.Hansen S. Selman L. Palaniyar N. Ziegler K. Brandt J. Kliem A. Jonasson M. Skjoedt M.O. Nielsen O. Hartshorn K. Jørgensen T.J. Skjødt K. Holmskov U. Collectin 11 (CL-11, CL-K1) is a MASP-1/3-associated plasma collectin with microbial binding activity.J. Immunol. 2010; 185: 6096-6106Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The same study also showed that CL-K1 was able to bind to some microorganisms as well as to apoptotic cells. It was later confirmed that recombinant CL-K1 and recombinant MASP-2 were able to form stable complexes in vitro and activate the lectin pathway upon binding to Candida albicans (12.Ma Y.J. Skjoedt M.O. Garred P. Collectin 11/MASP complex formation triggers activation of the lectin complement pathway–the fifth lectin pathway initiation complex.J. Innate Immun. 2013; 5: 242-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). CL-L1 was discovered through the screening of expressed sequence tag databases, revealing a cDNA fragment with C-terminal sequence homology with collectins (6.Ohtani K. Suzuki Y. Eda S. Kawai T. Kase T. Yamazaki H. Shimada T. Keshi H. Sakai Y. Fukuoh A. Sakamoto T. Wakamiya N. Molecular cloning of a novel human collectin from liver (CL-L1).J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13681-13689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The gene encoding CL-L1, now designated COLEC10, is located on chromosome 8 (q23-24.1) and spans 39,784 bp. The primary transcript includes six exons and a total of 1706 nucleotides. The first exon encodes the leader peptide, the N-terminal CLR, and the start of the collagen-like region. The next three exons encode the remaining collagen-like region, and the fifth and sixth exons encode the neck region and the CRD, respectively. The mRNA encodes an ORF of 277 amino acids, including a predicted leader peptide of 27 amino acids, resulting in a mature polypeptide chain of 250 amino acid residues comprising a CLR of 19 amino acids, a collagenous region of 72 amino acids, a neck region of 37 amino acids, and a CRD of 122 amino acids. Only one paper has presented original data on characteristics of CL-L1 (6.Ohtani K. Suzuki Y. Eda S. Kawai T. Kase T. Yamazaki H. Shimada T. Keshi H. Sakai Y. Fukuoh A. Sakamoto T. Wakamiya N. Molecular cloning of a novel human collectin from liver (CL-L1).J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13681-13689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). CL-L1 was described as a cytoplasmic protein, and an initial description of a lectin activity of recombinant CRDs of CL-L1 was presented (6.Ohtani K. Suzuki Y. Eda S. Kawai T. Kase T. Yamazaki H. Shimada T. Keshi H. Sakai Y. Fukuoh A. Sakamoto T. Wakamiya N. Molecular cloning of a novel human collectin from liver (CL-L1).J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13681-13689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Extending the studies of CL-L1 in cytoplasm, we have analyzed for the presence of the protein in serum and plasma. In this study, we present an assay for the measurement of CL-L1, and we use this assay to establish the levels of the protein in serum, size, and composition of the complexes, ontogeny, and acute phase reaction, and we analyze the lectin activity of CL-L1. Serum and plasma samples were obtained from Danish blood donors after informed consent according to the Declaration of Helsinki. Fresh blood samples were also collected from some individuals and kept at room temperature (RT), 4 °C, and 37 °C for varying time periods. To further evaluate the stability of CL-L1, fresh serum and plasma samples were exposed to repeated freezing and thawing cycles (n = 10). Ontogeny samples (0–12 months) were obtained from the umbilical cord of 12 infants and subsequently after 6, 9, and 12 months (13.Thiel S. Bjerke T. Hansen D. Poulsen L.K. Schiøtz P.O. Jensenius J.C. Ontogeny of human mannan-binding protein, a lectin of the innate immune system.Pediatr. Allergy Immunol. 1995; 6: 20-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Samples collected from patients undergoing colorectal surgery were obtained just prior to operation and sequentially up to 5 days after surgery, with a 35-day follow-up (14.Ytting H. Christensen I.J. Basse L. Lykke J. Thiel S. Jensenius J.C. Nielsen H.J. Influence of major surgery on the mannan-binding lectin pathway of innate immunity.Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2006; 144: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A cDNA clone (DNA Technology A/S, Denmark) encoding the full-length cDNA of human CL-L1 was introduced into the pCMV6XL4 transcription vector (OriGene, Technologies, Rockville, MD). The vector was transformed into One Shot® TOP10 Chemically Competent Escherichia coli (C4040-10, Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The DNA plasmid was purified with HiSpeed plasmid Maxi-Kit (12663, Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. FreestyleTM HEK293F cells (R79007, Invitrogen) were used for transient expression of recombinant CL-L1. The cell line has been adapted to grow in suspension in a serum-free medium (Freestyle Expression Medium, Invitrogen). The pCMV6XL4 CL-L1 expression construct was introduced into the cells using LipofectamineTM 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After growth of the cells for 72 h, the culture supernatants were harvested after centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min and stored at 4 °C in the presence of 15 mm sodium azide. A total of 100 μl of recombinant CL-L1 culture supernatant was lyophilized and re-dissolved in 40 μl of 0.2 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, containing 8 m urea, reduced, and alkylated by adding 1.2 μl of 0.5 m dithiothreitol (DTT, to 15 mm) followed by the addition of 2.6 μl of 0.5 m iodoacetamide (to 30 mm). Both reactions were allowed to continue for 1 h. The protein concentration of the sample was estimated by SDS-PAGE (data not shown) to be about 0.5 μg/μl. The sample was subsequently diluted 5-fold with 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, and digested using 1:50 w/w (i.e. ∼1 μg) sequencing grade modified trypsin (Sigma, T6567-1MG) at 37 °C for 16 h in a final volume of 225–229 μl. A total of 360 fmol of three stable isotope-labeled standard peptides (see below) were added to 24 μl of trypsin-digested sample, before desalting on C18 StageTips (Thermo Scientific, Hvidovre, Denmark). The sample was lyophilized and dissolved in 36 μl of 0.1% formic acid, and 5 μl was analyzed by LC-SRM-MS. This corresponds to loading 50 fmol of the stable isotope-labeled standard peptides on the column. All samples were handled in Protein LoBind Tubes (Eppendorf) to reduce protein loss. LC-SRM-MS analyses were performed on an EASY-nLC II system (Thermo Scientific) connected to a Qtrap 5500 mass spectrometer (AB Sciex) equipped with a NanoSpray III source (AB Sciex) and operated under Analyst 1.6.1 control. The samples were injected, trapped, and desalted isocratically on a ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ column (5-μm beads, 2 cm × 100 μm inner diameter; Thermo Scientific) after which the peptides were eluted from the trap column and separated on a ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ capillary column (3-μm beads, 16 cm × 75 μm inner diameter) packed in-house in acetonitrile, connected directly to the mass spectrometer. The peptides were eluted using a 12-min gradient from 5 to 35% buffer B (0.1% formic acid and 90% acetonitrile) at 250 nl/min, followed by re-equilibration for 10 min back to the starting conditions. The Qtrap was in positive ion mode with 2500 V ion spray voltage, curtain gas setting of 30, ion source gas setting of 5, and an interface heater temperature of 150 °C. The eluted peptides were measured with a selected reaction monitoring assay using a 20-ms dwell time for all transitions (24 in total) and a target scan time of 0.6 s. The resolution in Q1 and Q3 was set to unit (0.7 atomic mass units full width of half-maximum). The recombinant CL-L1 amount in the culture supernatant was determined by selected reaction monitoring mass spectrometry. The assay was developed using Skyline 1.4.0.4421 (15.MacLean B. Tomazela D.M. Shulman N. Chambers M. Finney G.L. Frewen B. Kern R. Tabb D.L. Liebler D.C. MacCoss M.J. Skyline: an open source document editor for creating and analyzing targeted proteomics experiments.Bioinformatics. 2010; 26: 966-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (2963) Google Scholar) based on the analysis of recombinant CL-L1. Briefly, an MS discovery analysis of the digested culture CL-L1 containing supernatant was performed, and four peptides were selected. The peptides and their associated fragment ions were processed in Skyline. After data acquisition on the QTrap 5500, the three peptides with the highest intensities were selected as follows: GLLGIPGEK, DEAANTLIADYVAK, and VFIGVNDLER. Finally, collision energy optimization was performed on fragment ions using seven steps of 1 V on each side of the calculated collision energy values, and the four most intense transitions were kept for each of the three peptides (supplemental Fig. 1). The three stable isotope-labeled standard peptides, SpikeTides_TQL, were produced for us by JPT Peptide Technologies GmbH, Germany. Two different pAb to CL-L1 were produced by contract by GenScript Inc. The general production protocol can be viewed on line. In brief, 5 mg of either synthetic peptides representing the 14 N-terminal (LDIDSRPTAEVCAT) or a 14-amino acid long stretch in the CRD (NEGEPSDPYGHEDC) was conjugated with keyhole limpet hemocyanin. The conjugates were emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvants and used as immunogen on two separate rabbits. The rabbits received a boost with the conjugate emulsified with incomplete Freund's adjuvant 14, 35, and 56 days after the primary immunization. Each dose contained 500 μg of conjugate. The sera were tested by ELISA for reactivity against the respective peptide coated onto microtiter wells. The anti-peptide antibodies were affinity-purified on peptide-derivatized high affinity iodoacetyl resin as described by the supplier, GenScript, and lyophilized. Twenty to 30 mg were supplied. Monoclonal antibodies were produced by GenScript. The general protocol for production can be viewed on line. In brief, BALB/c mice were immunized subcutaneously with 100 μg per animal of either of the above described two peptide-keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugates emulsified first in Freund's complete adjuvants, followed by two injections with incomplete Freund's adjuvants and a final i.v. boost, each with 50 μg per animal. Four mice received the synthetic peptide representing 14 N-terminal amino acids, and six mice received the synthetic peptide representing CRD. Sera from all mice were tested for reactivity against the respective peptide coated directly onto microtiter wells. Mice exhibiting high titers were selected. Spleen cells from these mice were fused with myeloma cells (SP2/0), and selection was carried out on wells coated with the peptide used for immunization. After expansion, cloning, etc., the antibodies were purified by affinity chromatography on protein G beads and lyophilized. The reactivities of the mAbs and the pAb were tested by Western blotting. Recombinant CL-L1 supernatant (0.5 ml) was mixed with 125 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 8 m urea, 3% (w/v) SDS, 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue, pH 8.9) and separated by electrophoresis on XT-Criterion pre-cast 4–12% gradient BisTris polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad). DTT was added to disrupt disulfide bonds followed by iodoacetamide, and the samples were applied to a 10-cm broad trough. Separated proteins were blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond ECN, GE Healthcare) in transfer buffer (25 mm Tris, 0.192 m glycine, 20% v/v ethanol, 0.1% w/v SDS, pH 8.3) for 500 V-h. The membrane was blocked for 30 min in TBS, 0.1% Tw (10 mm Tris-HCl, 140 mm NaCl, 15 mm sodium azide, pH 7.4 (TBS), with 0.1% v/v Tween 20) and washed three times in TBS, 0.05% Tw (TBS/Tw) before it was cut into 3-mm wide strips. The strips were incubated in wells of Octatray (Octa 110, Pateof, Odense, Denmark) overnight on a rocking table with either 1 μg of pAb 187-7 and 187-110 or mAb 4F4 (from the antibody production described above) per ml of primary buffer (TBS/Tw, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mg of human serum albumin (HSA, Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark), and 100 μg of normal human IgG (hIgG, Beriglobin, CSL Bering, Marburg, Germany) per ml. As control for antibody, specificity strips were also incubated with normal rabbit (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) or normal mouse IgG (Lampire® Biological Laboratories) in primary buffer. After washing three times in TBS/Tw, the strips were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled rabbit anti-mouse antibody (Dako) or goat anti-rabbit antibody (Dako) diluted 4000-fold in secondary buffer (TBS/Tw without sodium azide, 1 mm EDTA, 100 μg of hIgG per ml) for 2 h on a rocking table followed by washing three times in TBS/Tw and developing with SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Scientific). Images were analyzed with a CCD camera (Fuji, Vedbaek, Denmark, LAS-4000). Background reactivity from the secondary HRP-conjugated antibody was evaluated with the buffer control strips. Antibodies were biotinylated with 166 μg of biotinyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide (Sigma) per mg of antibody according to the method described by the supplier followed by dialysis against TBS. FluoroNunc MaxiSorp (Thermo Scientific, 437958) microtiter wells were each coated with 0.5 μg of 187-10 anti-CL-L1 or with 0.5 μg of normal rabbit IgG (Dako) in 100 μl of PBS, overnight at room temperature (RT). Wells were blocked by incubation with TBS/Tw for 1 h, and subsequently washed with TBS/Tw. Twelve anti-CL-L1 wells and 12 control wells each received 100 μl of EDTA plasma diluted with an equal volume of “binding buffer” (TBS/Tw with 10 mm EDTA, 100 μg of heat-aggregated hIgG, and 10 μg of normal rabbit IgG (Dako) per ml). The heat-aggregated hIgG was prepared by incubation of hIgG (Beriglobin) at 1 mg/ml PBS at 60 °C for 30 min followed by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 10 min to remove large aggregates. Similarly, 12 antibody and 12 control IgG-coated wells received recombinant CL-L1 supernatant diluted with an equal volume of binding buffer. After incubation overnight, the microtiter wells were washed with TBS/Tw, and bound protein was eluted successively from 12 wells with 120 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The four eluates were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting (as above) using 1 μg of mAb anti-CL-L1 antibody 4F4 per ml in primary buffer. The concentration of CL-L1 in serum was determined by TRIFMA involving capture with pAb 187-10 anti-CL-L1 and detection of bound CL-L1 with biotinylated pAb 187-7 anti-CL-L1, followed by incubation with Eu3+-labeled streptavidin (1244-360 PerkinElmer Life Sciences). FluoroNunc MaxiSorp microtiter plates were incubated with 0.5 μg of 187-10 in 100 μl of PBS overnight. Residual binding sites were blocked with 1 mg of HSA per ml of TBS, and the wells were washed with TBS/Tw, and samples diluted in sample buffer were added. The sample buffer was identical to the binding buffer described above. Heat-aggregated hIgG was included to prevent false-positive signals due to rheumatic factor, and normal rabbit IgG was added to prevent cross-linking between coating and developing antibodies by human anti-rabbit antibodies in the serum samples (16.Degn S.E. Thiel S. Nielsen O. Hansen A.G. Steffensen R. Jensenius J.C. MAp19, the alternative splice product of the MASP-2 gene.J. Immunol. Methods. 2011; 373: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A standard curve was constructed from a dilution of a standard plasma pool. This was initially diluted 10-fold followed by serial 2-fold dilutions. Test samples were diluted 40-fold. After incubation overnight at 4 °C, the wells were washed with TBS/Tw and incubated with 100 ng of biotin-conjugated 187-7 anti-CL-L1 antibody in 100 μl of TBS/Tw, 10 mm EDTA for 2 h at RT. After washing with TBS/Tw, the wells were incubated with 10 ng of Eu3+-labeled streptavidin in 100 μl of TBS/Tw, 25 μm EDTA for 1 h at RT. Following washing, the bound europium was quantified by adding 200 μl of enhancement solution (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) per well, and the fluorescence was read on a fluorometer (Victor3, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Data were assessed using the WorkOut 2 software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). In addition to the dilutions of plasma for the construction of a standard curve, three internal control plasma and a buffer control were also included. All samples were added in duplicate. Serum (500 μl) diluted with an equal volume TBS/Tw, 5 mm CaCl2 was incubated in the presence of increasing concentrations of potential inhibitors (0–100 mm) overnight on rotation at 4 °C with 100 μl of mannose-coupled TSK HW 75 beads. The TSK beads were activated with divinyl sulfone (17.Fornstedt N. Porath J. Characterization studies on a new lectin found in seeds of Vicia ervilia.FEBS Lett. 1975; 57: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and coupled to mannose as described previously (18.Hansen S. Thiel S. Willis A. Holmskov U. Jensenius J.C. Purification and characterization of two mannan-binding lectins from mouse serum.J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 2610-2618Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). After centrifugation (100 × g for 5 min), the supernatants were collected; the beads were washed with TBS/Tw, 5 mm CaCl2, and bound CL-L1 was eluted with 250 μl of TBS/Tw, 5 mm CaCl2 containing 100 mm d-mannose. CL-L1 and MBL were subsequently measured in the eluates collected after centrifugation as above. Serum (500 μl) diluted with an equal volume of TBS/Tw + 5 mm CaCl or + 10 mm EDTA was incubated overnight on rotation at 4 °C with 100 μl of mannose-coupled TSK beads. d-Mannose (100 mm) was added to some samples to inhibit binding. The samples were centrifuged (100 × g, 5 min), and the supernatants were discharged. The beads were washed twice in TBS/Tw, 5 mm CaCl2, and bound material was eluted with 250 μl of TBS/Tw, 5 mm CaCl2 containing 100 mm d-mannose for 10 min on rotation at RT. The samples were centrifuged (100 × g, 5 min), and CL-L1 content of the supernatants was measured by TRIFMA. Samples incubated with unconjugated TSK beads were used as a negative control. Normal human serum and recombinant CL-L1 culture supernatants were subjected to gel-permeation chromatography on a Superose 6 HR 10/300 column (GE Healthcare). The column buffer was TBS, 5 mm CaCl2, or TBS, 10 mm EDTA. The column was run at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, and 250-μl fractions were collected in Tween 20-treated 96-well FluoroNunc MaxiSorp microtiter plates. Fractions were assayed for CL-L1 by the above described sandwich TRIFMA. The elution volume of IgM, MBL, H- and L-ficolin, purified IgG, and HSA on this column has previously been established (19.Wittenborn T. Thiel S. Jensen L. Nielsen H.J. Jensenius J.C. Characteristics and biological variations of M-ficolin, a pattern recognition molecule, in plasma.J. Innate Immun. 2010; 2: 167-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Possible complexes between CL-L1 and MASPs in serum were analyzed by coating FluoroNunc microtiter wells with capture antibody for one component and then develop with biotinylated antibody against the other component. FluoroNunc microtiter plates were coated with 500 ng of pAb 187-10 anti-CL-L1 antibody or 200 ng mAb 5F5 in 100 μl of PBS. mAb 5F5 is directed against the CCP-1 domain common for MASP-1, MASP-3, and MAp44 (20.Degn S.E.

After blocking in TBS/HSA and washing with TBS/Tw were added dilutions of serum in either TBS/Tw, 10 mm EDTA, or TBS/Tw, 10 mm EDTA with 1 m NaCl. In addition, the buffer contained 10 μg of normal mouse IgG (Lampire), 10 μg of normal rat IgG (Lampire), and 10 μg of cow IgG (Lampire) per ml (16.Degn S.E. Thiel S. Nielsen O. Hansen A.G. Steffensen R. Jensenius J.C. MAp19, the alternative splice product of the MASP-2 gene.J. Immunol. Methods. 2011; 373: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The plates were incubated overnight at 4 °C, washed with TBS/Tw, and incubated with either 100 ng of biotinylated pAb anti-CL-L1 187-7 or 100 ng of biotinylated mAb anti-CCP1 antibody per 100 μl of TBS/Tw, 10 mm EDTA for 2 h at RT. After washing with TBS/Tw, the wells were developed with europium-labeled streptavidin as described above. Fresh EDTA plasma and serum from the same individual were left at RT, 4 °C, and 37 °C, and aliquots (200 μl) were taken at 1 and 5 h and 2, 5, 14, 41, and 54 days and stored at −80 °C until CL-L1 content was m"

For example, the short day lengths of early autumn accurately foretell the advent of winter, but little is known about the molecular mechanisms that preside over the hormonal events dictating whether the insect proceeds with development or enters diapause. In Helicoverpa armigera we show that day length affects H3K27me3 by affecting polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) protein extra sex comb (ESC) and regulates the prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) gene, thus directly influencing developmental timing. ESC expression in brains of developing (nondiapause) pupae is higher than in brains from diapausing pupae. High ESC expression is localized in two pairs of PTTH neurosecretory cells, and H3K27me3 recruits on the PTTH promoter. Double strand ESC and PRC2 inhibitor (DzNep) treatment in vitro show that ESC triggers PTTH promoter activity, which in turn depends on PRC2 methyltransferase activity. Injection of DzNep into pupae programmed for development reduces the H3K27me3 mark and PTTH gene expression, thereby delaying development. Although ESC is best known as a transcriptional repressor, our results show that ESC prompts development and metamorphosis. We believe this is the first report showing that the PRC2 complex functions as an activator and that a low level of H3K27me3 can prolong lifespan (i.e. induce diapause) by controlling PTTH gene expression in insects.Background: PTTH, a key insect neurohormone, regulates development by stimulating ecdysone synthesis and release.Results: PRC2 protein ESC activates PTTH expression by meditating H3K27me3, which depends on methyltransferase activity of PRC2 complex.Conclusion: PRC2 complex regulates insect developmental timing by controlling PTTH expression in the brain.Significance: This is the first report suggesting PRC2 complex as an activator meditating developmental timing in insects.

Environmental conditions are not always suitable to sustain insect development; many species enter a developmental arrest (diapause) in a specific stage during an unfavorable season and restart development when favorable environmental conditions return. Diapause is a “non-aging” state, similar to dauer in Caenorhabditis elegans, because it persists for months and results in extreme lifespan extension (1.Denlinger D.L. Yocum G.D. Rinehart J.P.

The insect brain perceives seasonal environmental signals such as day length and temperature and through processes that remain poorly understood, ultimately translates this information into neurohormonal signals that dictate either continuous development or diapause. One of the key neurohormones regulating insect development and longevity is prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) 3The abbreviations used are: PTTH, prothoracicotropic hormone; ESC, extra sex combs; PRC2, polycomb repressive complex 2; H3K27me3, trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3; Har-ESC, Helicoverpa armigera ESC; E(z), enhancer of zeste; Su(z)12, suppressor of zeste 12; DzNep, 3-deazaneplanocin A; qPCR, quantitative real-time PCR; TSS, transcriptional start site.

High ecdysone promotes insect development, whereas a low titer of the hormone results in diapause, a dramatic extension of lifespan due to developmental arrest (1.Denlinger D.L. Yocum G.D.

The polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) proteins are conserved chromatin modification factors best known for silencing gene expression by regulating chromatin through tri-methylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me3) (7.Ringrose L.

Histones. Annotating chromatin.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2009; 43: 559-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar).

Although the repressor function of PRC2 complex proteins has been well documented, several recent reports also suggest an opposite effect; that is, the PRC2 protein Su(z)12 occupies actively transcribed regions in embryonic stem cells (14.Pasini D.

These reports imply that the PRC2 protein can also function as an activator in the regulation of gene expression. PRC2 proteins are involved in a variety of physiological processes, including embryogenesis, stem cell pluripotency, and differentiation (17.Sparmann A. van Lohuizen M.

We speculate that the regulation of diapause by environmental signals may have an epigenetic basis and thus tested this idea by examining members of the polycomb family. The cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera, is a species that overwinters in pupal diapause. This developmental arrest can be initiated in the laboratory by exposing 5th-6th instar larvae to short day lengths (10 h light:14 h dark) and 20 °C, and their lifespan is 3 times longer than in their nondiapause counterparts reared at long day lengths (14 h light:10 h dark) and 20 °C without diapause. Thus, this species is an excellent model for lifespan research. It is well known that short day length causes a reduction of PTTH gene expression and subsequently low ecdysone levels early in the pupal stage, resulting in diapause (22.Wei Z.J. Zhang Q.R. Kang L. Xu W.H. Denlinger D.L. Molecular characterization and expression of prothoracicotropic hormone during development and pupal diapause in the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera.J.

Bull. 2007; 52: 2095-2099Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). How environmental signals exert their control over PTTH gene expression and hence the decision to develop or enter diapause is not known (24.Wei Z.J. Yu M. Tang S.M. Yi Y.Z. Hong G.Y. Jiang S.T.

Biol. 2011; 41: 356-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). In this study we observed that a core component of the PRC2 complex, ESC, is differentially expressed in pupal brains of nondiapause- and diapause-destined individuals in H. armigera. Experiments from immunostaining, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis, RNAi, and inhibitor treatment showed that the PTTH gene may be an ESC target. A high level of H3K27me3 in nondiapause pupal brain by PRC2 can promote insect development and metamorphosis by activating PTTH expression, whereas a low level of H3K27me3 can induce diapause by reduction of PTTH expression. Our results suggest that PRC2 functions as an activator of development, and the low level of H3K27me3 observed in diapausing individuals results in developmental arrest. H. armigera larvae were kindly provided by Dr. Jian-Ya Su, Nanjing Agriculture University (Nanjing, China), and reared on an artificial diet at 20 °C. When reared under a light-dark cycle of 14 h light:10 h dark all pupae developed into adults without entering diapause, whereas >95% entered pupal diapause when reared at 20 °C under a 10 h light:14 h dark photoperiod. Pupal brains were dissected in ice-cold 0.75% NaCl and stored at −80 °C until used. Total RNA was extracted from H. armigera pupal brains as reported (26.Lu Y.X. Xu W.H.

For histone extraction, brains were homogenized in nuclear extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 25 mm KCl, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm NaF, 10 mm Na3VO4, and 33 mm sodium butyrate) using a Dounce homogenizer. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation for 1 min at 8000 × g at 4 °C. Pellets were thoroughly suspended in 500 μl of 0.2 m H2SO4, incubated on ice for 30 min, and centrifuged for 30 min at 16,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred to a 1.5-ml tube, and 132 μl of 100% trichloroacetic acid was added slowly followed by incubation on ice for 30 min. Then the solution was centrifuged for 30 min at 16,000 × g at 4 °C. Finally, the pellets were washed twice in cold acetone and redissolved in 40 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Equal amounts of protein (30 μg) were separated on an SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to a PVDF membrane. The membrane was probed with an ESC antibody produced by injecting rabbits with purified recombinant Har-ESC protein. Antibody against full-length human EZH2 (SAB1405776, Sigma) was used against E(z) protein; H3 (ab1791), H3K27Ac (ab4729), H3K4me3 (ab8580) were purchased from Abcam, and H3K27me3 (17-622) was from Millipore. Recombinant Har-actin protein, which consists of 370 amino acids (GenBankTM number HM629442.1), was used to generate polyclonal antibodies in rabbits. The phosphatase assay was performed as described with a slight modification (28.Tie F. Siebold A.P. Harte P.J. The N terminus of Drosophila ESC mediates its phosphorylation and dimerization.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 332: 622-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Total protein from nondiapausing pupal brains was extracted and homogenized in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm PMSF). Samples (30 μg) were treated with or without 30 units of calf alkaline phosphatase (Takara, Japan) for 45 min at 37 °C. Full-length ESC (1–413 amino acids), N-terminal ESC (1–67 amino acids), and C-terminal ESC (67–413 amino acids) were amplified with primers (Table 1) containing BamHI and XhoI restriction sites. PCR products were digested and subcloned into the pIZ/V5-GFP vector. HzAm1 cells from Helicoverpa zea and Sf9 cells from Spodoptera frugiperda were maintained at 27 °C in Grace's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone). Transfection of pIZ/V5 vector was performed with the Cellfectin II reagent (Invitrogen) as described in Bao et al. (29.Bao B. Hong B. Feng Q.L. Xu W.H. Transcription factor fork head regulates the promoter of diapause hormone gene in the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera, and the modification of SUMOylation.Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2011; 41: 670-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). For the cellular location assay, nuclei of cells were stained with Hoechst 33,342 (1 mm) for 10 min, and fluorescence of GFP and nuclei were visualized with a fluorescence microscope (Olympus IX71). HzAm1 cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and 400 μg of protein extract was used for coimmunoprecipitation. The lysate was immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C with 20 μl of Protein G Plus/Protein A-agarose suspension (Merck) and 1 μg of ESC antibody. The same amount of normal rabbit serum was used instead of the ESC antibody as a negative control. Immunoblotting was carried out with human EZH2 antibody followed by incubation of Clean-blot IP (HRP) (Thermo) 1:1000 and visualized by chemiluminescence detection on film. Pupal brains were dissected from day 4 nondiapause- and diapause-destined pupae, fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde, PBT (PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100) for 1–2 h at room temperature, and washed 6–8 times in PBT. After washing with PBT, brains were blocked in 10% normal goat serum, PBT for 30 min at room temperature. A Zenon tricolor rabbit IgG labeling kit #1 (Invitrogen) was used for dual-labeling experiments. Har-PTTH antibody (22.Wei Z.J. Zhang Q.R. Kang L. Xu W.H. Denlinger D.L.

IgG labeling was performed according to the Zenon IgG labeling kit protocol. After labeling, the primary antibody/Alexa Fluor complex was diluted in PBT and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Then the samples were washed 3 times in PBT and fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde, PBT for 15 min at room temperature. Finally, the sample was washed, mounted, and examined with a fluorescence microscope (ImagerZ1, Carl Zeiss). The negative-control sample was processed with the same protocol except normal rabbit serum was substituted for the primary antibody. ChIP assays were performed as described (29.Bao B. Hong B.

Briefly, 60 pupal brains from day 4 nondiapause- or diapause-destined pupae were manually homogenized in 1 ml of nuclei extraction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 3 mm CaCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm PMSF, and 1 mm DTT). Then 37% formaldehyde was added to a 1% final concentration, and the tube was rotated for 15 min at room temperature. After sonication, the DNA fragments were immunoprecipitated with anti-ESC, anti-H3K27me3, anti-H3K27Ac, and anti-H3 antibodies. Immunoprecipitated DNA and input DNA were subjected to quantitative real-time PCR analysis. The gene-specific primers are listed in Table 1. dsRNAs of Har-ESC (519 bp of coding region) and GFP (700 bp of coding region) were synthesized using the T7 RiboMAX express RNAi system (Promega) and inserted into HzAm1 cells. Gene-specific primers are listed in Table 1. Transfection of dsRNA was performed with the Cellfectin II reagent (Invitrogen) as described in the Cellfectin II protocol. Cells were collected 24–72 h after RNAi. At least three independent dsRNA treatments were carried out to confirm the RNAi effects, and dsGFP served as a negative control. Reporter gene assays were performed as described (29.Bao B. Hong B. Feng Q.L. Xu W.H. Transcription factor fork head regulates the promoter of diapause hormone gene in the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera, and the modification of SUMOylation.Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2011; 41: 670-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In brief, Har-PTTH gene promoter was amplified with specific primers (Table 1), digested with XhoI and Hind III, and subcloned into the digested pGL3-Basic vector (Promega). The recombinant pGL3-PTTH promoter vector was transfected or co-transfected with dsRNA. The pRL-TK vector (Promega) was used as an internal control for variations in transfection efficiency. An orthologous gene of ESC was found in H. armigera EST libraries (LIBEST_027843, LIBEST_027842), and a full-length ESC cDNA was obtained by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (GenBankTM number JQ744271). The cDNA encodes 413 amino acids with two conserved structural domains, the nuclear location signal and WD40 domain (a short structural motif of ∼40 amino acids, often terminating in a tryptophan-aspartic acid dipeptide). The amino acid sequence has high identity with ESCs of other species: Danaus plexippus (95%), Bombyx mori (93%), Drosophila melanogaster (56%), Mus musculus (60%), and Homo sapiens (63%) (Fig. 1). Hence, we refer to the cDNA as Har-ESC cDNA. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and Western blots demonstrate that both Har-ESC mRNA (Fig. 2A) and protein (Fig. 2B) are more abundant in nondiapause-destined pupal brains than in brains from diapause-destined pupae. Western blots show two distinct bands for ESC; evidence from Drosophila indicates that the upper band is phosphorylated and the lower is non-phosphorylated ESC (28.Tie F. Siebold A.P. Harte P.J. The N terminus of Drosophila ESC mediates its phosphorylation and dimerization.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 332: 622-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 31.Ng J. Hart C.M. Morgan K. Simon J.A. A Drosophila ESC-E(Z) protein complex is distinct from other polycomb group complexes and contains covalently modified ESC.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3069-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). To further test this possibility, we used a phosphatase assay to determine if the upper band was phosphorylated ESC. Treatment of total protein with calf alkaline phosphatase eliminated the upper band (Fig. 2C), a result consistent with the observation that the N-terminal of ESC possesses a phosphorylation site (28.Tie F. Siebold A.P. Harte P.J. The N terminus of Drosophila ESC mediates its phosphorylation and dimerization.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 332: 622-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The lower band thus appears to be unphosphorylated ESC, as in Drosophila. This result implies that high expression of Har-ESC correlates with continuous development rather than diapause. Har-ESC possesses the nuclear location signal and WD40 domains found in the N-terminal region (35–42 amino acids) and C-terminal region of ESC (132–406 amino acids), respectively. In preliminary experiments we found low efficiency of vector transfection in HzAm1 cells but higher efficiency in Sf9 cells. To determine the location of these key domains on ESC, full-length ESC (1–413 amino acids), N-terminal ESC (1–67 amino acids), and C-terminal ESC (67–413 amino acids) were constructed, fused with a pIZ/V5-GFP plasmid, and expressed in Sf9 cells. Full-length ESC and N-terminal ESC were mainly localized in the nucleus, but C-terminal ESC was only present in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3, A and B). These results imply that Har-ESC can enter the nucleus to exert its biological function. Previous reports indicate that ESC directly interacts with E(z) to form the PRC2 complex (32.Müller J.

To confirm this in our system, a co-immunoprecipitation analysis was used to detect the ESC-E(z) complex; the result showed that ESC interacts with E(z), suggesting that Har-ESC and E(z) form the expected complex within the pupal brain of H. armigera (Fig. 3C). Because ESC is a core component of the PRC2 complex and regulates trimethylation of H3K27 (32.Müller J. Hart C.M. Francis N.J. Vargas M.L. Sengupta A. Wild B. Miller E.L. O'Connor M.B. Kingston R.E.

https://openalex.org/W2072440152,"Ovarian cancer, which is the leading cause of death from gynecological malignancies, is a heterogeneous disease known to be associated with disruption of multiple signaling pathways. Nevertheless, little is known regarding the role of protein phosphatases in the signaling events that underlie the disease; such knowledge will be essential to gain a complete understanding of the etiology of the disease and how to treat it. We have demonstrated that protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) was underexpressed in a panel of ovarian carcinoma-derived cell lines, compared with immortalized human ovarian surface epithelial cell lines. Stable restoration of PTP1B in those cancer cell lines substantially decreased cell migration and invasion, as well as proliferation and anchorage-independent survival. Mechanistically, the pro-survival IGF-1R signaling pathway was attenuated upon ectopic expression of PTP1B. This was due to dephosphorylation by PTP1B of IGF-1R β-subunit and BRK/PTK6, an SRC-like protein-tyrosine kinase that physically and functionally interacts with the IGF-1R β-subunit. Restoration of PTP1B expression led to enhanced activation of BAD, one of the major pro-death members of the BCL-2 family, which triggered cell death through apoptosis. Conversely, inhibition of PTP1B with a small molecular inhibitor, MSI-1436, increased proliferation and migration of immortalized HOSE cell lines. These data reveal an important role for PTP1B as a negative regulator of BRK and IGF-1Rβ signaling in ovarian cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2132004871,"Loss of function mutation in Krev interaction trapped 1 (KRIT1) causes autosomal dominant familial cerebral cavernous malformations and disrupts cardiovascular development. The biological function of KRIT1 requires that its FERM (band 4.1, ezrin, radixin, moesin) domain physically interact with both the small GTPase Rap1 and the cytoplasmic tail of the Heart of glass (HEG1) membrane anchor. In this study, we show that the KRIT1 FERM domain can bind both Rap1 and HEG1 simultaneously, and we solved the crystal structure of the KRIT1-Rap1-HEG1 ternary complex. Rap1 binds on the surface of the F1 and F2 subdomains, in an interaction that leaves its Switch II region accessible to other potential effectors. HEG1 binds in a hydrophobic pocket at the KRIT1 F1 and F3 interface, and there is no overlap with the Rap1-binding site. Indeed, the affinity of KRIT1 or the KRIT1-Rap1 complex for HEG1 is comparable (Kd = 1.2 and 0.96 μm, respectively) showing that there is no competition between the two sites. Furthermore, analysis of this structure revealed a specific ionic interaction between the F2 lobe of KRIT1 and Rap1 that could explain the remarkable Rap1 specificity of KRIT1. This structural insight enabled design of KRIT1(K570I), a mutant that binds Rap1 with 8-fold lower affinity and exhibits increased binding to HRas. These data show that HEG1 can recruit the Rap1-KRIT complex to the plasma membrane where Rap1's Switch II region remains accessible and reveals an important determinant of KRIT1's specificity for Rap1."
https://openalex.org/W2064227749,"Vascular injury that results in proliferation and dedifferentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) is an important contributor to restenosis following percutaneous coronary interventions or plaque rupture. Protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR1) has been shown to play a role in vascular repair processes; however, little is known regarding its function or the relative roles of the upstream proteases thrombin and matrix metalloprotease-1 (MMP-1) in triggering PAR1-mediated arterial restenosis. The goal of this study was to determine whether noncanonical MMP-1 signaling through PAR1 would contribute to aberrant vascular repair processes in models of arterial injury. A mouse carotid arterial wire injury model was used for studies of neointima hyperplasia and arterial stenosis. The mice were treated post-injury for 21 days with a small molecule inhibitor of MMP-1 or a direct thrombin inhibitor and compared with vehicle control. Intimal and medial hyperplasia was significantly inhibited by 2.8-fold after daily treatment with the small molecule MMP-1 inhibitor, an effect that was lost in PAR1-deficient mice. Conversely, chronic inhibition of thrombin showed no benefit in suppressing the development of arterial stenosis. Thrombin-PAR1 signaling resulted in a supercontractile, differentiated phenotype in SMCs. Noncanonical MMP-1-PAR1 signaling resulted in the opposite effect and led to a dedifferentiated phenotype via a different G protein pathway. MMP-1-PAR1 significantly stimulated hyperplasia and migration of SMCs, and resulted in down-regulation of SMC contractile genes. These studies provide a new mechanism for the development of vascular intimal hyperplasia and suggest a novel therapeutic strategy to suppress restenosis by targeting noncanonical MMP-1-PAR1 signaling in vascular SMCs."
https://openalex.org/W1988771152,"Resveratrol is growth-suppressive and pro-apoptotic in liver cancer cells. Methionine adenosyltransferase 2B (MAT2B) encodes for two dominant variants V1 and V2 that positively regulate growth, and V1 is anti-apoptotic when overexpressed. Interestingly, crystal structure analysis of MAT2B protein (MATβ) protomer revealed two resveratrol binding pockets, which raises the question of the role of MAT2B in resveratrol biological activities. We found that resveratrol induced the expression of MAT2BV1 and V2 in a time- and dose-dependent manner by increasing transcription, mRNA, and protein stabilization. Following resveratrol treatment, HuR expression increased first, followed by SIRT1 and MAT2B. SIRT1 induction contributes to increased MAT2B transcription whereas HuR induction increased MAT2B mRNA stability. MATβ interacts with HuR and SIRT1, and resveratrol treatment enhanced these interactions while reducing the interaction between MATβ and MATα2. Because MATβ lowers the Ki of MATα2 for S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), this allowed steady-state AdoMet level to rise. Interaction among MATβ, SIRT1, and HuR increased stability of these proteins. Induction of MAT2B is a compensatory response to resveratrol as knocking down MAT2BV1 potentiated the resveratrol pro-apoptotic and growth-suppressive effects, whereas the opposite occurred with V1 overexpression. The same effect on growth occurred with MAT2BV2. In conclusion, resveratrol induces HuR, SIRT1, and MAT2B expression; the last may represent a compensatory response against apoptosis and growth inhibition. However, MATβ induction also facilitates SIRT1 activation, as the interaction stabilizes SIRT1. This complex interplay among MATβ, HuR, and SIRT1 has not been previously reported and suggests that these proteins may regulate each other's signaling."

This assumption has remained largely unchallenged due to a paucity of methods to distinguish individual phagosomes. We devised an assay that extends the utility of nitro blue tetrazolium for detection and quantification of NAPDH oxidase (NOX) activity in individual phagosomes. Implementation of this assay revealed that in murine macrophages there is heterogeneity in the ability of individual phagosomes to generate superoxide, both between and within cells. To elucidate the molecular basis of the variability in NOX activation, we employed genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors to evaluate the uniformity in the distribution of phospholipid mediators of the oxidative response. Despite variability in superoxide generation, the distribution of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate, and phosphatidic acid was nearly identical in all phagosomes. In contrast, diacylglycerol (DAG) was not generated uniformly across the phagosomal population, varying in a manner that directly mirrored superoxide production. Modulation of DAG levels suggested that NOX activation is precluded when phagosomes fail to reach a critical DAG concentration. In particular, forced expression of diacylglycerol kinase β abrogated DAG accumulation at the phagosome, leading to impaired respiratory burst. Conversely, pharmacological inhibition of DAG kinases or expression of an inactive diacylglycerol kinase β mutant increased the proportion of DAG-positive phagosomes, concomitantly potentiating phagosomal NOX activity.

https://openalex.org/W2004400037,"The L-α-lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI)-sensitive receptor GPR55 is coupled to Ca(2+) signaling. Low levels of GPR55 expression in the heart have been reported. Similar to other G protein-coupled receptors involved in cardiac function, GPR55 may be expressed both at the sarcolemma and intracellularly. Thus, to explore the role of GPR55 in cardiomyocytes, we used calcium and voltage imaging and extracellular administration or intracellular microinjection of GPR55 ligands. We provide the first evidence that, in cultured neonatal ventricular myocytes, LPI triggers distinct signaling pathways via GPR55, depending on receptor localization. GPR55 activation at the sarcolemma elicits, on one hand, Ca(2+) entry via L-type Ca(2+) channels and, on the other, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-dependent Ca(2+) release. The latter signal is further amplified by Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release via ryanodine receptors. Conversely, activation of GPR55 at the membrane of intracellular organelles promotes Ca(2+) release from acidic-like Ca(2+) stores via the endolysosomal NAADP-sensitive two-pore channels. This response is similarly enhanced by Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release via ryanodine receptors. Extracellularly applied LPI produces Ca(2+)-independent membrane depolarization, whereas the Ca(2+) signal induced by intracellular microinjection of LPI converges to hyperpolarization of the sarcolemma. Collectively, our findings point to GPR55 as a novel G protein-coupled receptor regulating cardiac function at two cellular sites. This work may serve as a platform for future studies exploring the potential of GPR55 as a therapeutic target in cardiac disorders."
https://openalex.org/W1964965071,"Protein translation initiation is a tightly controlled process responding to nutrient availability and mitogen stimulation. Serving as one of the most important negative regulators of protein translation, 4E binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) binds to translation initiation factor 4E and inhibits cap-dependent translation in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Although it has been demonstrated previously that the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 is controlled by mammalian target of rapamycin in the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1, the mechanism underlying the dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1 remains elusive. Here, we report the identification of PPM1G as the phosphatase of 4E-BP1. A coimmunoprecipitation experiment reveals that PPM1G binds to 4E-BP1 in cells and that purified PPM1G dephosphorylates 4E-BP1 in vitro. Knockdown of PPM1G in 293E and colon cancer HCT116 cells results in an increase in the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 at both the Thr-37/46 and Ser-65 sites. Furthermore, the time course of 4E-BP1 dephosphorylation induced by amino acid starvation or mammalian target of rapamycin inhibition is slowed down significantly in PPM1G knockdown cells. Functionally, the amount of 4E-BP1 bound to the cap-dependent translation initiation complex is decreased when the expression of PPM1G is depleted. As a result, the rate of cap-dependent translation, cell size, and protein content are increased in PPM1G knockdown cells. Taken together, our study has identified protein phosphatase PPM1G as a novel regulator of cap-dependent protein translation by negatively controlling the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1."
https://openalex.org/W2114451783,"Genes with G/C-rich promoters were up-regulated in the duodenal epithelium of iron-deficient rats including those encoding iron (e.g. Dmt1 and Dcytb) and copper (e.g. Atp7a and Mt1) metabolism-related proteins. It was shown previously that an intestinal copper transporter (Atp7a) was co-regulated with iron transport-related genes by a hypoxia-inducible transcription factor, Hif2α. In the current study, we sought to test the role of Sp1 in transcriptional regulation of Atp7a expression during iron deprivation/hypoxia. Initial studies in IEC-6 cells showed that mithramycin, an Sp1 inhibitor, reduced expression of Atp7a and iron transport-related genes (Dmt1, Dcytb, and Fpn1) and blocked their induction by CoCl2, a hypoxia mimetic. Consistent with this, overexpression of Sp1 increased endogenous Atp7a mRNA and protein expression and stimulated Atp7a, Dmt1, and Dcytb promoter activity. Site-directed mutagenesis and functional analysis of a basal Atp7a promoter construct revealed four functional Sp1 binding sites that were necessary for Hif2α-mediated induction of promoter activity. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays confirmed that Sp1 specifically interacts with the Atp7a promoter in IEC-6 cells and in rat duodenal enterocytes. This investigation has thus revealed a novel aspect of Atp7a gene regulation in which Sp1 may be necessary for the HIF-mediated induction of gene transcription during iron deficiency/hypoxia.

https://openalex.org/W1985418614,"Chymotrypsin C (CTRC) is a proteolytic regulator of trypsinogen autoactivation in humans. CTRC cleavage of the trypsinogen activation peptide stimulates autoactivation, whereas cleavage of the calcium binding loop promotes trypsinogen degradation. Trypsinogen mutations that alter these regulatory cleavages lead to increased intrapancreatic trypsinogen activation and cause hereditary pancreatitis. The aim of this study was to characterize the regulation of autoactivation of mouse trypsinogens by mouse Ctrc. We found that the mouse pancreas expresses four trypsinogen isoforms to high levels, T7, T8, T9, and T20. Only the T7 activation peptide was cleaved by mouse Ctrc, causing negligible stimulation of autoactivation. Surprisingly, mouse Ctrc poorly cleaved the calcium binding loop in all mouse trypsinogens. In contrast, mouse Ctrc readily cleaved the Phe-150-Gly-151 peptide bond in the autolysis loop of T8 and T9 and inhibited autoactivation. Mouse chymotrypsin B also cleaved the same peptide bond but was 7-fold slower. T7 was less sensitive to chymotryptic regulation, which involved slow cleavage of the Leu-149-Ser-150 peptide bond in the autolysis loop. Modeling indicated steric proximity of the autolysis loop and the activation peptide in trypsinogen, suggesting the cleaved autolysis loop may directly interfere with activation. We conclude that autoactivation of mouse trypsinogens is under the control of mouse Ctrc with some notable differences from the human situation. Thus, cleavage of the trypsinogen activation peptide or the calcium binding loop by Ctrc is unimportant. Instead, inhibition of autoactivation via cleavage of the autolysis loop is the dominant mechanism that can mitigate intrapancreatic trypsinogen activation."
https://openalex.org/W2119911439,"We demonstrated previously that ppGalNAc-T13 (T13), identified as an up-regulated gene with increased metastasis in a DNA microarray, generated trimeric Tn (tTn) antigen (GalNAcα1-Ser/Thr)3 on Syndecan 1 in highly metastatic sublines of Lewis lung cancer. However, it is not known how tTn antigen regulates cancer metastasis. Here, we analyzed the roles of tTn antigen in cancer properties. tTn antigen on Syndecan 1 increased cell adhesion to fibronectin in an integrin-dependent manner. Furthermore, cell adhesion to fibronectin induced phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase and paxillin in T13-transfectant cells. In the search of Syndecan 1-interacting molecules, it was demonstrated that tTn antigen-carrying Syndecan 1 interacted with integrin α5β1 and matrix metalloproteinase 9 and that these molecules shifted to a glycolipid-enriched microdomain/rafts along with increased metastatic potential in T13-transfectant cells. We also identified a tTn substitution site on Syndecan 1, demonstrating that tTn on Syndecan 1 is essential for the interaction with integrin α5β1 as well as for the reaction with mAb MLS128. These data suggest that high expression of the ppGalNAc-T13 gene generates tTn antigen on Syndecan 1 under reduced expression of GM1, leading to enhanced invasion and metastasis via the formation of a molecular complex consisting of integrin α5β1, Syndecan 1, and MMP-9 in the glycolipid-enriched microdomain/rafts."

Here we present a thorough kinetic analysis of Trypanosoma brucei TryS in a newly developed phosphate buffer system at pH 7.0 and 37 °C, mimicking the physiological environment of the enzyme in the cytosol of bloodstream parasites. Under these conditions, TryS displays Km values for GSH, ATP, spermidine, and Gsp of 34, 18, 687, and 32 μm, respectively, as well as Ki values for GSH and T(SH)2 of 1 mm and 360 μm, respectively. As Gsp hydrolysis has a Km value of 5.6 mm, the in vivo amidase activity is probably negligible. To obtain deeper insight in the molecular mechanism of TryS, we have formulated alternative kinetic models, with elementary reaction steps represented by linear kinetic equations. The model parameters were fitted to the extensive matrix of steady-state data obtained for different substrate/product combinations under the in vivo-like conditions. The best model describes the full kinetic profile and is able to predict time course data that were not used for fitting. This system's biology approach to enzyme kinetics led us to conclude that (i) TryS follows a ter-reactant mechanism, (ii) the intermediate Gsp dissociates from the enzyme between the two catalytic steps, and (iii) T(SH)2 inhibits the enzyme by remaining bound at its product site and, as does the inhibitory GSH, by binding to the activated enzyme complex. The newly detected concerted substrate and product inhibition suggests that TryS activity is tightly regulated."

https://openalex.org/W2112895187,"The mechanisms of generation of the antineoplastic effects of interferons (IFNs) in malignant hematopoietic cells remain to be precisely defined. We examined the activation of type I IFN-dependent signaling pathways in malignant cells transformed by Jak2V617F, a critical pathogenic mutation in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). Our studies demonstrate that during engagement of the type I IFN receptor (IFNAR), there is activation of Jak-Stat pathways and also engagement of Mnk kinases. Activation of Mnk kinases is regulated by the Mek/Erk pathway and is required for the generation of IFN-induced growth inhibitory responses, but Mnk kinase activation does not modulate IFN-regulated Jak-Stat signals. We demonstrate that for type I IFNs to exert suppressive effects in malignant hematopoietic progenitors from patients with polycythemia vera, induction of Mnk kinase activity is required, as evidenced by studies involving pharmacological inhibition of Mnk or siRNA-mediated Mnk knockdown. Altogether, these findings provide evidence for key and essential roles of the Mnk kinase pathway in the generation of the antineoplastic effects of type I IFNs in Jak2V617F-dependent MPNs."

https://openalex.org/W1972667760,"Receptor-like protein-tyrosine phosphatases (RPTPs) are involved in various aspects of cellular functions, such as proliferation, differentiation, survival, migration, and metabolism. A small number of RPTPs have been reported to regulate activities of some cellular proteins including receptor protein-tyrosine kinases (RPTKs). However, our understanding about the roles of individual RPTPs in the regulation of RPTKs is still limited. The R3 RPTP subfamily reportedly plays pivotal roles in the development of several tissues including the vascular and nervous systems. Here, we examined enzyme-substrate relationships between the four R3 RPTP subfamily members and 21 RPTK members selected from 14 RPTK subfamilies by using a mammalian two-hybrid system with substrate-trapping RPTP mutants. Among the 84 RPTP-RPTK combinations conceivable, we detected 30 positive interactions: 25 of the enzyme-substrate relationships were novel. We randomly chose several RPTKs assumed to be substrates for R3 RPTPs, and validated the results of this screen by in vitro dephosphorylation assays, and by cell-based assays involving overexpression and knock-down experiments. Because their functional relationships were verified without exception, it is probable that the RPTKs identified as potential substrates are actually physiological substrates for the R3 RPTPs. Interestingly, some RPTKs were recognized as substrates by all R3 members, but others were recognized by only one or a few members. The enzyme-substrate relationships identified in the present study will shed light on physiological roles of the R3 RPTP subfamily."

These data indicate a previously unknown yet critical role for yeast TFIIA in the integration of activator-TFIID contacts with promoter conformation and downstream preinitiation complex formation and/or function. Here we describe the use of systematic mutagenesis to define how specific TFIIA contacts contribute to these processes. We have verified that TFIIA is required for RPG transcription in vivo and in vitro, consistent with the existence of a critical Rap1-TFIIA-TFIID interaction network. We also identified essential points of contact for TFIIA and Rap1 within the Rap1 binding domain of the Taf4 subunit of TFIID. These data suggest a mechanism for how interactions between TFIID, TFIIA, and Rap1 contribute to the high rate of transcription initiation seen on RPGs in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2013318719,"The cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB) initiates transcriptional responses to a wide variety of stimuli. CREB activation involves its phosphorylation on Ser-133, which promotes interaction between the CREB kinase-inducible domain (KID) and the KID-interacting domain of the transcriptional coactivator, CREB-binding protein (CBP). The KID also contains a highly conserved phosphorylation cluster, termed the ATM/CK cluster, which is processively phosphorylated in response to DNA damage by the coordinated actions of ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) and casein kinases (CKs) 1 and 2. The ATM/CK cluster phosphorylation attenuates CBP binding and CREB transcriptional activity. Paradoxically, it was recently reported that DNA damage activates CREB through homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2-dependent phosphorylation of Ser-271 near the CREB bZIP DNA binding domain. In this study we sought to further clarify DNA damage-dependent CREB phosphorylation as well as to explore the possibility that the ATM/CK cluster and Ser-271 synergistically or antagonistically modulate CREB activity. We show that, rather than being induced by DNA damage, Ser-270 and Ser-271 of CREB cophosphorylated in a CDK1-dependent manner during G2/M phase. Functionally, we show that phosphorylation of CREB on Ser-270/Ser-271 during mitosis correlated with reduced CREB chromatin occupancy. Furthermore, CDK1-dependent phosphorylation of CREB in vitro inhibited its DNA binding activity. The combined results suggest that CDK1-dependent phosphorylation of CREB on Ser-270/Ser-271 facilitates its dissociation from chromatin during mitosis by reducing its intrinsic DNA binding potential."
https://openalex.org/W2014869206,"Once per cell cycle replication is crucial for maintaining genome integrity. Geminin interacts with the licensing factor Cdt1 to prevent untimely replication and is controlled by APC/C-dependent cell cycle specific proteolysis during mitosis and in G1. We show here that human geminin, when expressed in human cells in culture under a constitutive promoter, is excluded from the nucleus during part of the G1 phase and at the transition from G0 to G1. The N-terminal 30 amino acids of geminin, which contain its destruction box, are essential for nuclear exclusion. In addition, 30 amino acids within the central domain of geminin are required for both nuclear exclusion and nuclear accumulation. Cdt1 overexpression targets geminin to the nucleus, while reducing Cdt1 levels by RNAi leads to the appearance of endogenous geminin in the cytoplasm. Our data propose a novel means of regulating the balance of Cdt1/geminin in human cells, at the level of the subcellular localization of geminin."
https://openalex.org/W2007501535,"The chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) is a key regulator of mitosis in eukaryotes. It comprises four essential and conserved proteins known in mammals/yeasts as Aurora B/Ipl1, INCENP/Sli15, Survivin/Bir1, and Borealin/Nbl1.

Mitosis is an essential process required to faithfully segregate replicated chromosomes during eukaryotic cell division. Errors in segregation give rise to chromosome aneuploidy, a condition that can promote the development of various cancers. The fidelity of mitosis is ensured by multiple checkpoints, highlighting the critical physiologic importance of accurately segregating chromosomes (1.Meraldi P. Honda R. Nigg E.A.

The chromosomal passenger complex (CPC), 2The abbreviations used are: CPC, chromosomal passenger complex; CIP, calf intestine phosphatase; KD, kinase-dead; MT, microtubule; MTB, microtubule binding; S-MT, subtilisin-treated microtubule; THB, three-helix bundle. also called the Aurora B complex, has been shown to play a key role in orchestrating spindle activities, checkpoint signaling, establishing chromosome bi-orientation, and in controlling cytokinesis (3.Ruchaud S.

The chromosomal passenger complex and the spindle assembly checkpoint: kinetochore-microtubule error correction and beyond.Cell Div. 2008; 3: 10Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The CPC is composed of four proteins in mammals: Aurora B, INCENP, Survivin, and Borealin. The Aurora B kinase subunit is critical for all known functions of this complex, and inhibition of its catalytic activity by specific drugs has shown promise for cancer chemotherapy (6.Kitzen J.J. de Jonge M.J. Verweij J. Aurora kinase inhibitors.Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 2010; 73: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). During progression through mitosis, the CPC undergoes a very dynamic and precise sequence of changes in localization that involve moving from centromeres during metaphase to the spindle midzone during anaphase (for review, see Ref. 7.Carmena M. Earnshaw W.C. The cellular geography of Aurora kinases.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 842-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar). Among eukaryotes, the CPC is highly conserved. The CPC in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, also called the Ipl1 complex, is composed of four subunits: Ipl1, Bir1, Sli15, and Nbl1, which are the orthologs of the mammalian Aurora B, Survivin, INCENP, and Borealin, respectively (8.Cheeseman I.M.

INCENP/Sli15 has a modular organization (Fig. 1A). Its domains include (i) an IN-box domain that binds Aurora B/Ipl1, this domain is also phosphorylated by Aurora B/Ipl1 and activates the kinase activity of Aurora B/Ipl1 (14.Adams R.R. Wheatley S.P. Gouldsworthy A.M. Kandels-Lewis S.E. Carmena M. Smythe C. Gerloff D.L. Earnshaw W.C.

INCENP/Sli15 serves as a linker between the Aurora B/Ipl1 kinase subunit and the Survivin/Bir1 and Borealin/Nbl1 subunits (Fig. 1A). These other CPC subunits (Survivin/Bir1 and Borealin/Nbl1) are thought to direct the CPC to its different locations during mitosis (for review, see Ref. 17.van der Waal M.S. Hengeveld R.C. van der Horst A. Lens S.M. Cell division control by the chromosomal passenger complex.Exp. Cell Res. 2012; 318: 1407-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Despite all that is known about its subunits, little is known about the biological and biochemical activities of the complete four-subunit CPC itself: the interactions of the individual subunits, geometry of the complex, and autoregulation. Here we describe the purification of the intact yeast CPC expressed in bacteria and the biochemical characterization of the complete four-subunit complex. We show that kinase activation requires phosphorylation of INCENP/Sli15 at Aurora B/Ipl1 sites, that this phosphorylation regulates CPC kinase activity and CPC affinity for MTs, and that this phosphorylation can occur in trans. We also determined the affinity of the CPC for MTs and demonstrated that the binding of CPC to MTs is primarily electrostatic, depending critically on the acidic C-terminal (E-hook) tail of tubulin. Finally, we found that the MTB domain of INCENP/Sli15 is not only dispensable for the stability of the CPC, but also for the ability of CPC to bind MTs. A polycistronic vector was constructed using the pET3aTr/pST39 plasmid system (18.Tan S. A modular polycistronic expression system for overexpressing protein complexes in Escherichia coli.Protein Expression Purification. 2001; 21: 224-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). BIR1, SLI15, IPL1, and NBL1 genes were amplified from S. cerevisiae genomic DNA by PCR and inserted individually into the pET3aTr plasmid using the NdeI/BamHI restriction sites. Six histidines were added C-terminally to NBL1 together with a three-glycine linker, and silent mutations were introduced to eliminate restriction sites that would interfere with the cloning process. The coding sequences for the four individual genes along with their translation cassette (translation enhancer/Shine-Delgarno sequence/TATA box for expression in Escherichia coli) were cloned from pET3aTr and inserted into pST39C backbone in the following order: SLI15, IPL1, BIR1, and NBL1-His6 using the XbaI/BamHI, EcoRI/MfeI/HindIII, SacI/KpnI, and BspEI/MluI/BssHII restriction enzymes, respectively, to make the pDD2396 plasmid. The CPC mutant with all 17 Aurora B/Ipl1 consensus sites in INCENP/Sli15 mutated to alanines (17A-Sli15)-CPC (pDD2397) was constructed following the same procedure. 17A-Sli15 was amplified by PCR from plasmid pDD2222 described in Ref. 19.Nakajima Y. Cormier A. Tyers R.G. Pigula A. Peng Y. Drubin D.G. Barnes G. Ipl1/Aurora-dependent phosphorylation of Sli15/INCENP regulates CPC-spindle interaction to ensure proper microtubule dynamics.J. Cell Biol. 2011; 194: 137-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar. The Ipl1 kinase-dead mutant complex (KD-CPC), pDD2399, was constructed by mutagenesis of the IPL1 gene in the WT-CPC plasmid (pDD2396) to create the K133R mutation in Ipl1. The CPC mutant containing Ipl1 kinase-dead and Sli15-GFP (KD-GFP-CPC), pDD2400, was constructed by ligation of a GFP tag using the unique restriction site AvrII in pDD2399. The five-subunit CPC mutant (ΔM-Sli15)-CPC lacks the MTB domain of INCENP/Sli15. The N- and C-terminal regions of INCENP/Sli15 are expressed as separate polypeptides. This CPC complex contains Aurora B/Ipl1, Survivin/Bir1, and Borealin/Nbl1 subunits bound to the peptide of the N-terminal portion (amino acids 1–90) and to the peptide of the C-terminal portion (amino acids 632–698) of INCENP/Sli15. (ΔM-Sli15)-CPC (pDD2398) was constructed by mutagenesis of the cassette containing INCENP/Sli15 in pDD2396: a stop codon was introduced by a point mutation at amino acid position 91, and a translation enhancer/Shine-Delgarno sequence/TATA box was inserted together with a start codon at amino acid position 635, creating a fifth open reading frame. NiCo21 (DE3)-competent E. coli (NEB) were transformed with the desired plasmid, precultured in Luria broth with 100 μg/ml ampicillin overnight at 37 °C, diluted to 0.02 A600 in fresh Luria broth with ampicillin, grown to 0.6 A600 at 37 °C, induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and incubated for 12 h at 16 °C. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation, and the cell pellet was washed once with PBS (10 mm Na2HPO4, 2 mm KH2PO4, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl). The cell pellet was then resuspended in lysis buffer (10% glycerol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 300 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, 20 mm imidazole, 1% Triton X-100, and one tablet of Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science) for 50 ml of lysis buffer), sonicated for 3 min at 1-min intervals, and centrifuged at 66,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and injected onto a HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare), and the following buffer was used to wash the column: 10% glycerol; 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 300 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, 20 mm imidazole. The tagged protein was eluted using the same buffer containing 500 mm imidazole. The fractions containing CPC were pooled and incubated with 1 ml Chitin Beads (NEB) for 30 min at 4 °C to remove chaperone proteins (20.Robichon C. Luo J. Causey T.B. Benner J.S. Samuelson J.C.

Microbiol. 2011; 77: 4634-4646Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The supernatant was concentrated to 500 μl using centrifugal concentrators (Ultracel 30K; Amicon). The concentrated sample was injected onto a Superose 6 10/300 GL size-exclusion column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 10% glycerol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm arginine, 50 mm glutamate. Fractions containing the CPC were pooled and concentrated to 500 μl using centrifugal concentrators (Ultracel 30K). Another round of size-exclusion chromatography was done under the same conditions to get a more pure CPC. The fractions containing the CPC were pooled and concentrated to the appropriate volume using centrifugal concentrators (Ultracel 30K) and then flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. The yield was ∼250 μg of CPC/liter of E. coli culture. The MT co-sedimentation assays have been conducted as described previously (19.Nakajima Y. Cormier A. Tyers R.G. Pigula A. Peng Y. Drubin D.G. Barnes G. Ipl1/Aurora-dependent phosphorylation of Sli15/INCENP regulates CPC-spindle interaction to ensure proper microtubule dynamics.J. Cell Biol. 2011; 194: 137-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To summarize, bovine tubulin was assembled into MTs with GTP at 37 ºC and then stabilized with Taxol. Those Taxol-stabilized MTs were used at different concentrations and mixed with a fixed amount of CPC in a buffer containing 20% glycerol, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm arginine, 50 mm glutamate, 1 mm PMSF, and 10 μm Taxol and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Samples were spun down, and supernatant and pellet fractions were collected, run on SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane, and blotted using anti-Sli15 or anti-Bir1 antibodies. The CPC in vitro kinase assays were conducted as described previously (8.Cheeseman I.M. Anderson S. Jwa M. Green E.M. Kang J.S. Yates 3rd, J.R. Chan C.S. Drubin D.G. Barnes G. Phospho-regulation of kinetochore-microtubule attachments by the Aurora kinase Ipl1p.Cell. 2002; 111: 163-172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). In Fig. 2B, CPC was used at a concentration of 10 nm, and Dam1 and histone H1 were used at a concentration of 10 μm. In Fig. 2C, CPC was used at a concentration of 1 μm. In Fig. 2D, WT-CPC or (17A-Sli15)-CPC was used at a concentration of 50 nm and (KD-GFP)-CPC was used at a concentration of 1 μm. In Fig. 2E, CPC was used at a concentration of 1 nm, and Dam1 was used at a concentration of 1 μm. The Dam1 complex for the in vitro kinase assays was purified as described previously (21.Westermann S. Avila-Sakar A. Wang H.W. Niederstrasser H. Wong J. Drubin D.G. Nogales E. Barnes G. Formation of a dynamic kinetochore-microtubule interface through assembly of the Dam1 ring complex.Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 277-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). A mixture of proteins of known molecular mass and Stokes radii (gel filtration standard; Bio-Rad) was loaded on a gel filtration column (Superose 6). The Kav (partition coefficient) was determined for each protein as Kav = (Ve − V0)/(Vt − V0) where Ve is the elution volume of the particular protein, V0 is the void volume of the column, and Vt is the total volume of the column. V0 and Vt were determined using acetone and dextran blue. The Kav of CPC was determined, and the calibration curve found in Fig. 3 was then used to convert its Kav to its apparent molecular mass and Stokes radius. To obtain intact CPC for biochemical characterization, we cloned the four full-length protein subunits of the complex (Survivin/Bir1, INCENP/Sli15, Aurora B/Ipl1, and Borealin/Nbl1; Fig. 1A) into a polycistronic vector for expression in E. coli (18.Tan S. A modular polycistronic expression system for overexpressing protein complexes in Escherichia coli.Protein Expression Purification. 2001; 21: 224-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The smallest subunit, Borealin/Nbl1, was tagged at its C-terminal end with a His6 tag separated by a 3-glycine amino acid linker, and the complex was purified using a nickel affinity column (Fig. 1B) followed by size-exclusion chromatography (Fig. 1C). A second round of size-exclusion chromatography further purified the complex (Fig. 1D). We also assessed the quality of the purified complex final product by Coomassie Blue staining of a SDS-polyacrylamide gel, as well as by immunoblot analysis using antibodies against Survivin/Bir1, INCENP/Sli15, and Aurora B/Ipl1 (Fig. 1E). The full complex, with a calculated molecular mass of 243 kDa, eluted from the size-exclusion column at the same size as a 1.5-MDa globular protein (Stokes radius of 9.7 nm). This value is comparable with the 10.3-nm Stokes radius determined for native yeast CPC 3Y. Nakajima, unpublished data. and indicates that yeast CPC expressed in and purified from bacteria has organization and oligomerization properties similar to those of the native CPC from yeast. The CPC elutes from size-exclusion chromatography as a larger complex than expected based on molecular mass, which is consistent with an elongated shape and/or a multimer of complexes (at most a hexamer). Following CPC purification, we observed that INCENP/Sli15, with a molecular mass of 79 kDa, exhibited anomalously slow migration in SDS-polyacrylamide gels, at slightly more than 100 kDa. INCENP/Sli15 has previously been shown to be phosphorylated by Aurora B/Ipl1 kinase (19.Nakajima Y. Cormier A. Tyers R.G. Pigula A. Peng Y. Drubin D.G. Barnes G. Ipl1/Aurora-dependent phosphorylation of Sli15/INCENP regulates CPC-spindle interaction to ensure proper microtubule dynamics.J. Cell Biol. 2011; 194: 137-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 22.Kang J. Cheeseman I.M. Kallstrom G. Velmurugan S. Barnes G. Chan C.S. Functional cooperation of Dam1, Ipl1, and the inner centromere protein (INCENP)-related protein Sli15 during chromosome segregation.J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 763-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). To test whether the slow migration of INCENP/Sli15 was due to phosphorylation, we subjected the CPC to dephosphorylation using nonspecific calf intestine phosphatase (CIP). Treatment with CIP increased the migration rate of the INCENP/Sli15 protein band, whereas mock treatment resulted in INCENP/Sli15 migrating at the same speed as the original untreated sample (Fig. 2A). This result suggests that INCENP/Sli15 is phosphorylated when expressed in bacteria. To determine whether the Aurora B/Ipl1 subunit of CPC could be responsible for phosphorylation of INCENP/Sli15, we tested whether Aurora B/Ipl1 retains its kinase activity after being purified from bacteria. We first evaluated the activity and specificity of Aurora B/Ipl1 kinase on a known substrate, the Dam1 complex (8.Cheeseman I.M. Anderson S. Jwa M. Green E.M. Kang J.S. Yates 3rd, J.R. Chan C.S. Drubin D.G. Barnes G. Phospho-regulation of kinetochore-microtubule attachments by the Aurora kinase Ipl1p.Cell. 2002; 111: 163-172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar), and on a histone protein known not to be a CPC substrate (histone H1 (23.Biggins S. Severin F.F. Bhalla N. Sassoon I. Hyman A.A. Murray A.W. The conserved protein kinase Ipl1 regulates microtubule binding to kinetochores in budding yeast.Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 532-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar)). Upon addition of radiolabeled ATP, the band corresponding to Dam1 strongly incorporated radiolabeled ATP whereas no signal was detectable for histone H1 (Fig. 2B), showing that CPC retained its kinase activity and specificity toward Dam1 and not histone H1. Because INCENP/Sli15 is a known target of Aurora B/Ipl1, we next incubated the CPC by itself with radiolabeled ATP. After incubation, we observed a strong signal at the level of the INCENP/Sli15 band that was not observed when using a kinase-dead mutant of the complex (KD-CPC, Fig. 2C). Aurora B/Ipl1 is thus capable of phosphorylating the INCENP/Sli15 subunit. Another question we asked is whether phosphorylation of INCENP/Sli15 might occur in trans, with the Aurora B/Ipl1 kinase subunit of one CPC phosphorylating the INCENP/Sli15 subunit of another CPC. If true, we would expect that incubating WT-CPC with a mutant containing Ipl1 kinase-dead and Sli15-GFP (KD-GFP-CPC) would lead to phosphorylation of Sli15-GFP by Ipl1 from the WT complex. This was indeed the result with KD-GFP-CPC not phosphorylating its own INCENPT/Sli15, but with this subunit being phosphorylated by the WT-CPC in the reaction mix (Fig. 2D). We also noticed that a CPC mutant version with the 17 Aurora B/Ipl1 consensus sites in INCENP/Sli15 mutated to alanines (described in Ref. 19.Nakajima Y. Cormier A. Tyers R.G. Pigula A. Peng Y. Drubin D.G. Barnes G. Ipl1/Aurora-dependent phosphorylation of Sli15/INCENP regulates CPC-spindle interaction to ensure proper microtubule dynamics.J.

The fact that (17A-Sli15)-CPC lacks kinase activity suggests that INCENP/Sli15 phosphorylation by AuroraB/Ipl1 kinase might be associated with an active state of the Aurora B/Ipl1 kinase CPC complex (Fig. 2D). To investigate further the requirement of CPC phosphorylation for kinase activity, we asked whether the key residues for CPC kinase activation are contained within the Sli15 subunit of the complex. To test this, we used the Dam1 complex as a substrate and compared the kinase activity of WT-CPC, CPC that had been dephosphorylated by treatment with CIP (CIP-CPC), and (17A-Sli15)-CPC. As expected, WT-CPC is active whereas CIP-treated CPC has a dramatically reduced activity (Fig. 2E, fifth and sixth lanes). Moreover, (17A-Sli15)-CPC does not have activity (Fig. 2E, seventh lane). These results suggest that the specific phosphorylation sites responsible for CPC activation are indeed phosphorylation sites for Aurora B/Ipl1 on INCENP/Sli15. These results are consistent with the conclusion that the kinase activity is dependent upon the CPC phosphorylation state. They also indicate that INCENP/Sli15 phosphorylation by Aurora B/Ipl1 might play a major regulatory role in activating CPC kinase activity in vivo. To explore the MT binding activity of the CPC, we incubated a fixed amount of CPC with varying amounts of Taxol-stabilized MTs and pelleted the mixture by ultracentrifugation. We then measured how the CPC distributes between supernatant (unbound) and pellet (bound). In this experiment, we found that the bacterially expressed CPC binds to MTs (Fig. 4A). Moreover, we noticed that a fraction of the CPC could not be pelleted even at high MT concentrations. Interestingly, this nonbinding fraction of the CPC migrates at a higher apparent molecular mass than the microtubule binding fraction, indicating that it may be a phosphorylated form of the CPC. This would suggest that CPC phosphorylation reduces its MT binding affinity. We further investigated the MT binding ability of phosphatase-treated CPC and (17A-Sli15)-CPC. Both phosphatase-treated and (17A-Sli15)-CPCs bound strongly to MTs (Fig. 4B). We were also able to determine that (17A-Sli15)-CPC has a binding affinity of ∼0.1 μm for MTs (Fig. 4C). These results demonstrate that Aurora B/Ipl1 phosphorylation of INCENP/Sli15 inhibits the ability of CPC to bind to MTs. To investigate the nature of the interaction of the CPC with MTs and to evaluate the contribution of electrostatic and/or hydrophobic components to binding, we performed an assay in which (17A-Sli15)-CPC (containing the mutant Sli15 subunit that cannot be phosphorylated and thus forming a CPC complex that binds strongly to MTs) was incubated with MTs and increasing concentrations of NaCl. Because increasing concentrations of NaCl disrupt electrostatic interactions but stabilize hydrophobic interactions, this approach can be used as a method for evaluating the nature of the interaction. At a high NaCl concentration (200 mm), the interaction between CPC and MTs was completely abolished (Fig. 5A), suggesting that electrostatic interactions provide the main component of the binding energy between CPC and MTs. An electrostatic interaction could result from binding to a specific site on the MT lattice, or it could occur without a specific footprint on the MT but through interactions with the charged α- and β-tubulin C termini. These two interaction possibilities are not mutually exclusive. In an attempt to distinguish between these possibilities, we performed a MT binding assay using subtilisin-treated MTs (S-MTs). Subtilisin is a protease that cleaves the unstructured C-terminal tail of tubulin (E-hook) (24.Serrano L. Avila J. Maccioni R.B. Controlled proteolysis of tubulin by subtilisin: localization of the site for MAP2 interaction.Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4675-4681Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Under our experimental conditions, the C-terminal tails of both α- and β-tubulin were proteolyzed (Fig. 6). Both WT-CPC and (17A-Sli15)-CPC exhibited a decreased affinity for S-MTs compared with untreated MTs (Fig. 5B). We calculated the affinity of (17A-Sli15)-CPC for S-MTs to be 0.6 μm (data not shown) compared with 0.1 μm for MTs. This suggests that a major component of WT-CPC and (17A-Sli15)-CPC binding to MTs is through general electrostatic interactions with the C-terminal tail of tubulin in the absence of a specific CPC footprint on the MT lattice. However, because subtilisin treatment"

At first, the star-formation rate density increased dramatically, reaching a peak 10 billion years ago of more than 10 times the present-day value. Observations of the initial rise in star formation remain difficult, poorly constraining it. Theoretical modeling has trouble predicting this history because of the difficulty in following the feedback of energy from stellar radiation and supernova explosions into the gas from which further stars form. Observations from the ground and space with the next generation of instruments should reveal the full history of star formation in the universe, and simulations appear poised to accurately predict the observed history."
https://openalex.org/W1979686426,"Activated fibroblasts, also known as myofibroblasts, are mediators of several major human pathologies including proliferative fibrotic disorders, invasive tumor growth, rheumatoid arthritis, and atherosclerosis. We previously identified Niemann-Pick type C2 (NPC2) protein as a negative regulator of fibroblast activation (Csepeggi, C., Jiang, M., Kojima, F., Crofford, L. J., and Frolov, A. (2011) J. Biol. Chem. 286, 2078-2087). Here we report that NPC2-deficiency leads to a dramatic up-regulation of the arachidonic acid (AA) metabolic pathway in human fibroblasts. The major enzymes in this pathway, cPLA2 type IVA, COX-2, and mPGES-1, were dramatically up-regulated at both the transcriptional and translational levels. The specific phenotypic changes resulted in a >10-fold increase in the production and secretion of a key modulator of inflammation and immunity, prostaglandin E2. More importantly, AA metabolome profiling by liquid chromatography/tandem mass-spectrometry revealed the very specific nature of prostaglandin E2 up-regulation as the other analyzed AA metabolites derived from the COX-2, cytochrome P450, 5/15-lipoxygenase, and non-enzymatic oxidative pathways were mostly down-regulated. Blocking activity of cPLA2 efficiently suppressed expression of inflammatory cytokines, IL-1β and IL-6, thereby identifying cPLA2 as an important regulator of the inflammatory program in NPC2-null cells. Altogether, these studies highlight NPC2 as a specific regulator of AA metabolism and inflammation that suggests potential for NPC2 protein or its related signaling in the treatment of inflammatory diseases characterized by the presence of activated fibroblasts."
