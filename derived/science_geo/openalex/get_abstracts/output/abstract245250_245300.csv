When expressed in vitro, the human sweet receptor (a heterodimer of two taste receptor subunits: hT1R2 + hT1R3) responds to cyclamate, but the mouse receptor (mT1R2 + mT1R3) does not. Using mixed-species pairings of human and mouse sweet receptor subunits, we determined that responsiveness to cyclamate requires the human form of T1R3. Using chimeras, we determined that it is the transmembrane domain of hT1R3 that is required for the sweet receptor to respond to cyclamate. Using directed mutagenesis, we identified several amino acid residues within the transmembrane domain of T1R3 that determine differential responsiveness to cyclamate of the human versus mouse sweet receptors. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis of residues predicted to line a transmembrane domain binding pocket in hT1R3 identified six residues specifically involved in responsiveness to cyclamate. Using molecular modeling, we docked cyclamate within the transmembrane domain of T1R3. Our model predicts substantial overlap in the hT1R3 binding pockets for the agonist cyclamate and the inverse agonist lactisole. The transmembrane domain of T1R3 is likely to play a critical role in the interconversion of the sweet receptor from the ground state to the active state.

Taste is a primal sense that is essential for humans and other organisms to detect the nutritive quality of a potential food source while avoiding environmental toxins (1Gilbertson T.A. Damak S.

Taste perception can be categorized into five distinct qualities: sweet, bitter, salty, sour, and umami (amino acid taste) (1Gilbertson T.A. Damak S. Margolskee R.F. Curr. Opin.

Sweet, bitter, and umami tastes are mediated in large part by G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 2The abbreviations used are: GPCRs, G-protein-coupled receptors; TMD, transmembrane domain; VFTM, Venus flytrap module; h, human; HEK293E, human embryonic kidney 293E; m, mouse; TM, transmembrane.2The abbreviations used are: GPCRs, G-protein-coupled receptors; TMD, transmembrane domain; VFTM, Venus flytrap module; h, human; HEK293E, human embryonic kidney 293E; m, mouse; TM, transmembrane. and their linked signaling pathways. Sour and salty tastes are thought to be mediated by direct effects on specialized ion channels (1Gilbertson T.A. Damak S. Margolskee R.F. Curr. Opin.

The detection of sweet taste is mediated by two GPCR subunits, T1R2 and T1R3, which are specifically expressed in taste receptor cells (4Hoon M.A. Adler E. Lindemeier J. Battey J.F. Ryba N.J.

When expressed in vitro, T1R2 + T1R3 heterodimer responds to a broad spectrum of chemically diverse sweeteners, ranging from natural sugars (sucrose, fructose, glucose, and maltose), sweet amino acids (d-tryptophan, d-phenylalanine, and d-serine), and artificial sweeteners (acesulfame-K, aspartame, cyclamate, saccharin, and sucralose) to sweet tasting proteins (monellin, thaumatin, and brazzein) (10Nelson G.

In vivo, genetic ablation in mice of T1R2, T1R3, or both either reduces or eliminates responses to sweet compounds (12Damak S. Rong M. Yasumatsu K. Kokrashvili Z. Varadarajan V. Zou S. Jiang P.

Thus, the T1R2 + T1R3 heterodimer is broadly tuned and functions as the principal or sole sweet taste receptor in vivo. T1R2 and T1R3 are class C GPCR subunits (4Hoon M.A. Adler E. Lindemeier J.

Like most other GPCRs, each class C receptor has a heptahelical transmembrane domain (TMD). Unlike other types of GPCRs, each class C GPCR has a characteristic extracellular domain composed of two parts: a “Venus flytrap module” (VFTM), which is involved in ligand binding, and a cysteine-rich domain, which contains nine highly conserved cysteines and which links the VFTM to the TMD (17Pin J.P. Galvez T. Prezeau L. Pharmacol. Ther. 2003; 98: 325-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). A variable length intracellular C-terminal tail completes the class C receptor. Although the “canonical” ligand-binding site lies within the VFTM, additional ligand-binding sites are present elsewhere on T1R proteins and other class C receptors (14Jiang P. Ji Q. Liu Z.

We have shown previously that the cysteine-rich domain of human (h) T1R3 is essential for sweet receptor responses to sweet proteins, suggesting that these proteins bind here on the receptor (14Jiang P. Ji Q. Liu Z. Snyder L.A. Benard L.M. Margolskee R.F. Max M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45068-45075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that responses to aspartame depend on the canonical VFTM binding site within T1R2 and that lactisole (an inverse agonist) interacts with the TMD of hT1R3 (15Jiang P. Cui M. Ji Q. Snyder L. Liu Z. Benard L. Margolskee R.F. Osman R. Max M. Chem. Senses. 2005; 30: i17-i18Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 16Jiang P. Cui M. Zhao B. Liu Z. Snyder L.A. Benard L.M.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14258-14263Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). We show here that cyclamate also interacts with the TMD of hT1R3 within a potential binding pocket that overlaps with the proposed binding site of lactisole. Thus, there are at least three broadly defined potential binding domains on the heterodimeric sweet receptor, all of which appear capable of mediating its activation. In this study, we show that activation of the sweet receptor by cyclamate requires the human form of T1R3. Using human/mouse chimeric receptors, we have determined that it is the TMD of hT1R3 that specifies responsiveness to cyclamate. From additional chimeras and mutants, we have identified several residues within the TMD of hT1R3 that account in large part for the species-specific response to cyclamate. From molecular models of the predicted binding pocket within the TMD and systematic alanine-scanning mutagenesis, we have identified additional residues involved in sweet receptor responses to cyclamate. Interestingly, certain of these mutations altered responsiveness to both cyclamate (agonist) and lactisole (inverse agonist). Our experimental results support our computationally derived molecular model of cyclamate docked into the TMD binding pocket of T1R3, suggesting that molecular models of the TMDs of T1R proteins and other family C receptors may be generally useful for probing active state conformations of these receptors. Materials—Cyclamate and d-tryptophan were obtained from Sigma and, unless otherwise noted, used at a concentration of 10 mm in the cell-based assays. Chimeras and Mutants—Most of the T1R3 chimeras and mutants used here have been reported previously (16Jiang P. Cui M. Zhao B. Liu Z. Snyder L.A. Benard L.M. Osman R. Margolskee R.F. Max M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15238-15246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis or overlapping PCR was used to generate additional mutants of hT1R3. All mutants were confirmed by sequence analysis. Expression of wild-type hT1R3 and the alanine substitution mutants was examined by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy using an antibody generated against the N-terminal region of hT1R3 (6Max M. Shanker Y.G. Huang L. Rong M. Liu Z. Campagne F. Weinstein H. Damak S. Margolskee R.F. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 58-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 14Jiang P. Ji Q. Liu Z. Snyder L.A.

All mutants examined reached the cell surface; no significant differences in cell-surface expression were observed between these mutants and wild-type hT1R3 (supplemental Fig. 1). Cell Culture and Calcium Imaging—Human embryonic kidney 293E (HEK293E) cells were cultured, maintained, and transfected as described previously (16Jiang P. Cui M. Zhao B. Liu Z. Snyder L.A. Benard L.M. Osman R. Margolskee R.F. Max M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15238-15246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). All transfections were done in triplicate, and all experiments were repeated at least twice. Cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 8 × 105 cells/well. After 24 h, the cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding T1R proteins and Gα16-gust44 (a chimeric G protein and subunit containing the last 44 amino acids of gustducin). After an additional 24 h, the cells were trypsinized and reseeded onto polylysine-coated 96-well assay plates (Corning Inc.) at a density of 40,000 cells/plate in low glucose medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 1× GlutaMAX-I (Invitrogen). After another 24 h, the cells were washed once with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline and then loaded with 75 μl of 3 μm Fluo-4 (calcium-sensing dye; Molecular Probes, Inc.) in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline for 2 h. The cells were washed twice with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline and assayed using a FlexStation II (Molecular Devices Corp.). Fluorescence changes (excitation at 488 nm, emission at 525 nm, and cutoff at 515 nm) were monitored after addition of Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 2× tastants. For each response trace, the data were acquired at 2-s intervals; samples were added at 30 s; and scanning was continued for an additional 150 s. Data Analysis—Calcium mobilization was quantified as the change of peak fluorescence (ΔF) over the base-line level (F). As described previously (16Jiang P. Cui M. Zhao B. Liu Z. Snyder L.A. Benard L.M. Osman R. Margolskee R.F. Max M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15238-15246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. of the ΔF/F value from three independent samples. The analysis was done automatically using an in-house written SAS program. The data are presented as ΔF/F of three independent measurements. Curve-fitting and generation of bar graphs was done with the GraphPad Prism 3 program. Homology Modeling and Molecular Docking—Homology modeling of hT1R3 based on sequence alignment to rhodopsin was as described (16Jiang P. Cui M. Zhao B. Liu Z. Snyder L.A. Benard L.M. Osman R. Margolskee R.F. Max M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15238-15246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). To dock cyclamate into the T1R3 TMD, the geometry of cyclamate (cyclohexyl sulfamate) was fully optimized by the ab initio quantum chemistry method at the HF/6-31G* level, followed by a single point calculation with the polarized continuum model solvation method to obtain the electrostatic potentials using the Gaussian 98 package (25Frisch M.J. Trucks G.W. Schlegel H.B. Scuseria G.E. Robb M.A. Cheeseman J.R. Zakrzewski V.G. Montgomery J.A. Stratmann R.E. Burant J.C. Dapprich S. Millam J.M. Daniels A.D. Kudin K.N. Strain M.C. Farkas O.

The CHELPG charge-fitting scheme (26Breneman C.M. Wiberg K.B. J. Comput. Chem. 1990; 11: 361-373Crossref Scopus (3920) Google Scholar) was then used to calculate partial charges for cyclamate. The missing force field parameters for cyclamate were obtained from similar parameters taken from charmm27 or QUANTA (Accelrys Software Inc., San Diego, CA). Cyclamate was docked into the pocket of the TMD of hT1R3 using the automatic docking program AutoDock Version 3.0.5 (27Morris G.M. Goodsell D.S. Halliday R.S. Huey R. Hart W.E. Belew R.K. Olson A.J. J. Comput. Chem. 1998; 19: 1639-1662Crossref Scopus (8853) Google Scholar). This program uses a powerful Lamarckian genetic algorithm method for conformational sampling and docking. The docked conformations of cyclamate were analyzed by the cluster analysis of AutoDock. The final docked conformation was selected from the total conformations based upon compatibility with results from mutagenesis, followed by some manual adjustments of the positions of cyclamate and the side chains of the hT1R3 TMD before employing model refinement by molecular dynamics simulations. The same protocol of molecular dynamics simulations was used as described previously (16Jiang P. Cui M. Zhao B. Liu Z. Snyder L.A. Benard L.M. Osman R. Margolskee R.F. Max M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15238-15246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The α-carbon atoms of the helices were restricted by 1.0 kcal/mol/Å2 harmonic restraint force. The Sweet Taste of Cyclamate Requires the TMD of hT1R3—Although cyclamate tastes sweet to humans, mice do not detect it as sweet or show preference for it (28Richards R.K. Taylor J.D. O'Brien J.L. Duescher H.O. J. Am. Pharm. Assoc. 1951; 40: 1-6Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 29Bachmanov A.A. Tordoff M.G. Beauchamp G.K. Chem. Senses. 2001; 26: 905-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). To determine whether this differential responsiveness to cyclamate's sweetness is mediated by the human versus mouse forms of the sweet receptor, we expressed the human and mouse sweet receptors by transient transfection in HEK293E cells along with Gα16-gust44 and then monitored activation (calcium mobilization) by indicator dye using d-tryptophan as a positive control (Fig. 1). As expected, the human receptor (hT1R2 + hT1R3) responded to cyclamate, whereas the mouse (m) receptor (mT1R2+ mT1R3) did not; both receptors responded to the d-tryptophan control. To determine whether one or both human T1R subunits are required for responses to cyclamate, we expressed mismatched pairs of human and mouse T1R2 and T1R3 subunits and then tested for responses to cyclamate. One mismatched pair (hT1R2 + mT1R3) did not respond to cyclamate, but did respond to d-tryptophan (Fig. 1), indicating that hT1R3 is required for receptor sensitivity to cyclamate. The other mismatched pair (mT1R2 + hT1R3) is nonfunctional in this assay (14Jiang P. Ji Q. Liu Z. Snyder L.A. Benard L.M. Margolskee R.F. Max M. J. Biol.

Using human/mouse chimeras, we show below that hT1R2 is not required for receptor sensitivity to cyclamate (Fig. 2C).FIGURE 2The hT1R3 TMD determines responsiveness to cyclamate. A, the schematic diagram shows chimeras between hT1R3 and mT1R3 (swapped at the extracellular domain-TMD boundary of the receptors). Mouse portions are colored gray. C-Rich, cysteine-rich domain. B, hT1R2 and T1R3 chimeras were expressed by transient transfection in HEK293E cells along with Gα16-gust44. The receptor-expressing cells were then assayed by calcium mobilization for their responses to cyclamate (10 mm) and d-tryptophan (10 mm). Receptors with their TMD from mT1R3 (h.1-547.mT1R3 and h.1-567.mT1R3) did not respond to cyclamate, whereas receptors with their TMD from hT1R3 (mT1R3.h.548-852 and mT1R3.h.568-852) were fully responsive to cyclamate. All transfections were done in triplicate; each experiment was repeated two to three times. C, transfection and assays of responses to cyclamate and d-tryptophan were as described for B. Responses to cyclamate did not require the human form of T1R2: receptors containing the TMD from hT1R3 (mT1R3.h.568-852) responded to cyclamate equally well whether paired with mT1R2 or hT1R2 (see B). The responses of the human sweet receptor are shown for comparison.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To identify the portion of hT1R3 required for sensitivity to cyclamate, we tested the responses to cyclamate of heterodimeric receptors composed of hT1R2 plus human/mouse chimeras of T1R3 in which varying portions of hT1R3 were substituted with the complementary portions of mT1R3 (Fig. 2A). As described above, receptor responses to d-tryptophan were used as a positive control for receptor activity. Heterodimers of hT1R2 plus T1R3 chimeras containing most or all of the extracellular region of hT1R3 coupled to the TMD and C-terminal tail of mT1R3 (i.e. h.1-547.mT1R3 and h.1-567.mT1R3) responded to d-tryptophan, but not to cyclamate. In contrast, heterodimers of hT1R2 plus T1R3 chimeras containing most or all of the extracellular domain of mT1R3 coupled to the TMD and C-terminal tail of hT1R3 (i.e. mT1R3.h.548-852 and mT1R3.h.568-852) responded to both d-tryptophan and cyclamate (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that sweet receptor responses to cyclamate require the TMD and/or C-terminal tail of hT1R3. To determine whether the human form of T1R2 is required for sweet receptor responsiveness to cyclamate, we examined the responses of the heterodimeric receptor formed by mT1R2 and mT1R3.h.568-852 (Fig. 2C). Unlike the nonfunctional pairing of mT1R2 and hT1R3 (Fig. 1), mT1R2 can function in combination with the mT1R3.h.568-852 chimera (16Jiang P. Cui M. Zhao B. Liu Z. Snyder L.A. Benard L.M. Osman R. Margolskee R.F. Max M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15238-15246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The heterodimer of mT1R2 and mT1R3.h.568-852 responded to d-tryptophan and cyclamate (as well as to several other sweeteners (16Jiang P. Cui M. Zhao B. Liu Z. Snyder L.A. Benard L.M. Osman R. Margolskee R.F. Max M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15238-15246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar)). Thus, hT1R2 is not required for responsiveness to cyclamate, indicating that the hT1R3 component of the heterodimeric receptor is necessary and sufficient for responsiveness to cyclamate. The combined results of Fig. 2 (B and C) demonstrate that only the TMD and C-terminal tail portion of T1R3 need to be from human for the sweet receptor to respond to cyclamate. Extracellular Loop 3 and Transmembrane (TM) Helix 7 of hT1R3 Are Required for Responsiveness to Cyclamate—To identify the portion(s) of the TMD and/or C-terminal tail of hT1R3 required for responses to cyclamate, we examined several additional human/mouse chimeras of T1R3 in combination with hT1R2. This set of chimeras contain the VFTM of hT1R3 along with varying portions of the TMD and C-terminal tail of hT1R3 coupled to the complementary portion of mT1R3 (Fig. 3A). All heterodimers formed by coexpressing hT1R2 plus these chimeras responded to d-tryptophan (Fig. 3B). However, only one heterodimer responded to cyclamate (i.e. hT1R2/h.1-812.mT1R3): this chimera contains the VFTM and entire TMD of hT1R3, but with the C-terminal tail of mT1R3. Heterodimers of hT1R2 with T1R3 chimeras in which mouse sequences replaced any portion of the TMD failed to respond to cyclamate. Thus, one or more differences between the human and mouse sequences within the TMD affect responsiveness to cyclamate. That hT1R2/h.1-812.mT1R3 responded to cyclamate but hT1R2/h.1-787.mT1R3 did not indicates that responsiveness to cyclamate requires human-specific residues between amino acids 787 and 812 of hT1R3, corresponding to extracellular loop 3 and TM helix 7. As noted below, additional residues within the TMD also contribute to sweet receptor responsiveness to cyclamate. Substitutions of Phe-7305.43 in TM Helix 5 and Arg-790ex3 in Extracellular Loop 3 Selectively Affect hT1R3 Responses to Cyclamate—We had previously observed the importance of TM helices 5 and 7 and extracellular loop 3 of hT1R3 in determining human-specific sensitivity of the sweet receptor to the inverse agonist lactisole (16Jiang P. Cui M. Zhao B. Liu Z. Snyder L.A. Benard L.M. Osman R. Margolskee R.F. Max M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15238-15246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). For our study of the interaction of lactisole with the sweet receptor, we had generated a series of hT1R3 mutants in which the human-specific residues in these regions had been replaced with their mouse counterparts (16Jiang P. Cui M. Zhao B. Liu Z. Snyder L.A. Benard L.M. Osman R. Margolskee R.F. Max M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15238-15246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). We tested the responses to cyclamate and d-tryptophan of heterodimers of hT1R2 with these T1R3 mutants (Fig. 4). All mutant-containing heterodimers responded to d-tryptophan. Of the four human-to-mouse replacement mutants in TM helix 5, only the F7305.43L mutant showed diminished responsiveness to cyclamate (Fig. 4A). Of the eight replacement mutants in extracellular loop 3 and TM helix 7, only R790ex3Q showed an altered response to cyclamate: the response to cyclamate was completely absent in this mutan"

A number of different kinases have been implicated in ERα regulation. In this report we show by mutational analysis and in vitro kinase assays that ERα is a substrate for glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) in vitro and is phosphorylated on two sites, the Ser-102, -104, and -106 motif and Ser-118, both located in the N-terminal transcription activation function (AF-1) domain. GSK-3 forms a complex with ERα in vivo as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation from cell lysates. The GSK-3 inhibitor lithium chloride was used to determine the role of GSK-3 in phosphorylation of Ser-102, -104, and -106 and Ser-118 in vivo and to explore the role of these serines in the regulation of ERα function. Treatment of cells with lithium chloride resulted in dephosphorylation of Ser-104 and -106 and Ser-118, which suggests these serine residues as targets for GSK-3 in vivo. Our results further suggest that ERα phosphorylation by GSK-3 stabilizes ERα under resting conditions and modulates ERα transcriptional activity upon ligand binding. Inhibition and constitutive activation of GSK-3, both, resulted in inhibition of ERα transcriptional activity, indicating a function of active as well as inactive GSK-3 in ERα regulation. These findings uncover a novel mechanism for the regulation of ERα-mediated estrogen signaling controlled by a dual action of GSK-3.

Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schütz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 835-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6062) Google Scholar). Nuclear receptors are characterized by a conserved structural and functional organization and play essential roles in development, differentiation, and metabolism by controlling the expression of specific networks of genes (2Dilworth F.J.

Based on sequence homology and other approaches, the estrogen receptor protein can be divided into six functionally and physically independent domains, nominated A to F (1Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C.

Ligand binding results in conformational change of ERα, formation of homodimers, translocation into the nucleus, and subsequent binding to estrogen response elements (EREs) located within regulatory regions of target genes (4Tora L.

The ERα has two well characterized transcriptional activation functions: AF-1, which is located in the N-terminal A/B region and may be activated in a ligand-independent manner, and AF-2, which is located in region E and whose activity is ligand-dependent. AF-1 and AF-2 can activate transcription independently and synergistically act in a promoter- and cell type-specific manner (4Tora L. White J.H. Brou C. Tasset D.M. Webster N.J.G. Scheer E.

The ERα, like other members of the steroid hormone receptor superfamily, is phosphorylated on multiple serine residues (6Castano E. Chen C.W. Vorojeikina D.P. Notides A.C. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol.

Serine phosphorylation is essential for transcriptional activation in response to estradiol binding and occurs on Ser-167 and Ser-118, the latter being the major phosphorylation site required for full activation of ERα and to a lesser extent on Ser-104 and Ser-106, all located in the AF-1 domain of the receptor (7Lannigan D.A.

Neurosci. 2004; 25: 363-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and, therefore, may be related to estrogen signaling is glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3). GSK-3 is a proline-directed serine/threonine kinase (15Woodgett J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 564-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) that is widely expressed in mammalian tissues. Unlike most kinases, GSK-3 is catalytically active in resting cells (16Jope R.S. Johnson G.V.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 95-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar, 17Frame S. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1274) Google Scholar). GSK-3 is a crucial regulator of embryonic development as well as of numerous cellular functions in adult tissues such as glycogen metabolism, lipid synthesis, cytoskeletal arrangement, apoptosis, gene expression, and proliferative response, and is implicated in human diseases including cancer, Alzheimer disease, and diabetes (16Jope R.S. Johnson G.V.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 95-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar). The two mammalian GSK-3 isoforms (GSK-3α and GSK-3β) are stringently controlled in response to growth factor or hormonal stimulation by phosphorylation, protein complex formation, and subcellular distribution (16Jope R.S. Johnson G.V.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 95-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar, 17Frame S. Cohen P. Biochem.

Both GSK-3 isoforms have a similar substrate specificity; however, the disruption of the GSK-3β gene in mice results in embryonic lethality, indicating that GSK-3α cannot completely compensate the loss of GSK-3β (19Hoeflich K.P. Luo J. Rubie E.A. Tsao M.-S. Jin O. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 2000; 406: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1219) Google Scholar). GSK-3 activity is significantly reduced by phosphorylation on Ser-21 in GSK-3α and Ser-9 in GSK-3β. Studies in different cells suggest that the protein kinases p70S6 kinase, p90Rsk, Akt/protein kinase B, protein kinase A, and certain protein kinase C isoforms phosphorylate Ser-9 in GSK-3β and Ser-21 in GSK-3α (17Frame S.

We show here that ERα is a substrate of GSK-3, being phosphorylated at two different sites in the AF-1 domain in response to estradiol (E2). This suggests an important function of GSK-3 in the regulation of ERα transcriptional activity. Cell Culture and Transfections—MELN and COS-1 cells were grown in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (4.5 g/liter glucose) (Invitrogen) containing 10% dextran-coated charcoal-treated serum (22Migliaccio A. Pagano M. Auricchio F. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2183-2191PubMed Google Scholar) for 48 h before treatment with E2 or inhibitors. Transfections of MELN cells were performed by electroporation using Gene-Pulser II (Bio-Rad) at 975 microfarads, 250 V. COS-1 cells were transfected by the DEAE-dextran method (23Keown W.A. Campbell C.R. Kucherlapati R.S. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 527-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Briefly, COS-1 cells were grown to ∼60% confluence. Plasmid DNA (3 μg) and DEAE-dextran (0.2 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline) were added to the COS-1 cells for 30 min at 37 °C followed by the addition of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 μm chloroquine and an additional incubation for 3 h. Then the solution was aspired, and 10% Me2SO in phosphate-buffered saline was added for 2 min followed by rinsing and incubation at normal growing conditions. MDA-MB231 cells were grown in phenol red-free RPMI 1640 (PAA, Cölbe, Germany) and transfected using jetPEI (Polyplus-Transfection, Illkirch, France) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Non-immune IgGs were from Upstate Biotechnology (Charlottesville, VA). Microscopy—MELN cells were grown on poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips to 50% confluence, kept in medium with dextran-coated charcoal-treated serum for 48 h, and treated with E2 (100 nm) for 20 min. Cells were fixed in methanol for 5 min and acetone for 1 min at -20 °C and then processed for double immunofluorescence staining of GSK-3 and ERα. ERα was detected using a rabbit antibody directed against the C terminus of human ERα, and GSK-3α/β was detected with a mouse antibody. All antibody incubations were performed in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature. Alexa-green conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:300) was used as secondary antibody to detect GSK-3, and Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:200) was used to detect ERα. The fluorescence signals were visualized at wavelengths of 490 nm (Alexa-green) and 550 nm (Cy3) using a XF2043 dichroic mirror (Omega, Brattleboro, VT) and photographed using a Zeiss Axiovert S100 microscope. Further analysis was performed using the Openlab software (Improvision, Coventry, UK). Co-localization was acquired from thin (0.25-0.5 μm) z-sections through the cells. Immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE—Cells lysates (50 mm Hepes at pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm NaF, complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) were cleared by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 10 min). Lysates containing equal amounts of proteins were precleared with IgG bound to protein A-agarose beads (Sigma) for 2h at 4 °C and immunoprecipitated with the specific primary antibody and protein A-agarose overnight with gentle agitation. The precipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using phosphospecific primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies. Immunoreactive bands were detected by the ECL-plus reagent (Amersham Biosciences). After stripping, the membranes (Immobilon P, Millipore, Eschwege, Germany) were probed with antibodies to the respective proteins. Cellular Fractionation—Cells were homogenized in Nuclear Buffer I (10 mm Hepes at pH 7.8, 10 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.6% Triton X-100) containing the complete protease inhibitors mixture (Roche Applied Science) using a glass homogenizer. After centrifugation (1000 × g at 4 °C), the supernatant (cytoplasmic fraction) was collected. The pellet was washed twice in Nuclear Buffer I, resuspended in Nuclear Buffer II (50 mm Hepes at pH 7.8, 50 mm KCl, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10% glycerol), incubated on ice for 30 min, and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant (nuclear proteins) and the cytoplasmic fraction were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Plasmids—The GSK-3β cDNA (a gift from Dr. P. Angel) was sub-cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The GSK-3βS9A mutant was generated by PCR using the wild type construct as a template (forward primer, 5′-GCTAGCATGTCAGGGCGGCCCAGAACCACCGCCTT-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TATAAGATCTGGAGGAGTTGGAAGCTGATGCAGA-3′), and the PCR reaction product was cloned into pcDNA3. The full-length cDNA of human ERα was cloned into pcDNA3 2× FLAG (pcDNA3 ERα2×FLAG). Site-directed mutagenesis of the ERα (serine to alanine) was performed using the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Mutations were verified by DNA sequence analysis using the ABI PRISM® BigDye™ Terminator Ready reaction cycle sequencing kit and ABI PRISM® 377 DNA Sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Expression of Recombinant Proteins— cDNA fragments coding for amino acids 76-176 of the B domain of wild type and mutant ERα were amplified by PCR from the respective pcDNA3 ERα2×FLAG constructs. The PCR fragments (GST-ERα-(76-176) wild type and GST-ERα-(76-176) mutants) were inserted into the pGEX-4T vector (Amersham Biosciences). Overnight cultures of Escherichia coli BL21 transformed with the GST constructs or the GST control plasmid were diluted 100-fold, cultured for 5-6 h, and then induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h. GST-ERα fusion proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose as described by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). In Vitro Phosphorylation Assay—Recombinant human ERα (Panvera, Madison, WI) or purified GST-ERα-(76-176) fusion proteins (wild type and mutants) were incubated with rabbit GSK-3β (New England Biolabs) for 10 min at 30 °C in a total volume of 30 μl of protein kinase assay buffer (200 μm ATP, 25 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol) containing 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol). Phosphoprotein products were detected by PAGE (12% gel), Coomassie Blue staining, and autoradiography. Luciferase Assays—MELN cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (Mg2+- and Ca2+-free) and lysed in 150 μl/well luciferase cell culture lysis reagent (Promega, Mannheim, Germany). Luciferase assays were performed using the firefly luciferase assay system from Promega according to the manufacturer's instructions and a luminometer (Biolumat LB6505, Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany). GSK-3 Is Involved in ERα Activation—Based on findings that estradiol treatment of cells resulted in activation of Akt/protein kinase B in estrogen-dependent MCF-7 cells (12Castoria G. Migliaccio A.

Boussioux A.M. Demirpence E. Nicolas J.C. Luminescence. 2001; 16: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar)) were treated with E2 and with the GSK-3 inhibitor LiCl (25Stambolic V. Ruel L. Woodgett J.R. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1664-1668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and luciferase activity was measured. E2 treatment resulted in a ∼4-fold induction of luciferase activity. This effect was inhibited by the specific ER-antagonist ICI 182,780 studied for control and by LiCl (Fig. 1A). The reduction of estrogen-dependent ERα transcriptional activation by LiCl indicated a function of active (unphosphorylated) GSK-3 in ERα activation. E2 treatment of cells resulted, however, in GSK-3 phosphorylation (inactivation) in a dose (Fig. 1B)- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 1C) that agrees with findings on inactivation of GSK-3 by E2 in rat hippocampus (14Cardona-Gomez P. Perez M. Avila J. Garcia-Segura L.M. Wandosell F. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2004; 25: 363-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). These observations on GSK-3 inactivation by E2 treatment and the decrease in E2-induced ERα transcriptional activation by the GSK-3 inhibitor were, at first glance, surprising and contradictory. However, the results implied the possibility of multiple functions of GSK-3 regarding ligand-dependent ERα activation. GSK-3 Associates with Human ERα—GSK-3 has been reported as a docking kinase (26Biondi R.M. Nebreda A.R. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), able to form complexes with substrates in different pathways. To clarify if ERα is a physiological substrate for GSK-3, we investigated whether ERα and GSK-3 can physically associate in vivo. The interaction between GSK-3 and ERα was assessed by immunoprecipitation of endogenous GSK-3α/β or ERα and analyzing the immune complexes for the presence of ERα or GSK-3β, respectively. We observed an association of GSK-3 and ERα in untreated cells that increased after E2 treatment, showing a maximum at 20 min (Figs. 2, A and B). This association was confirmed by immunofluorescence and co-localization assays, two different antibody sets yielding similar results (Fig. 2C). Co-localization of ERα and GSK-3 was observed mainly in the cytoplasm of untreated cells and in the nuclei in E2-treated cells. GSK-3β that co-precipitated with ERα (Fig. 2B) was not phosphorylated at Ser-9, meaning that ERα interacted with the active form of GSK-3β. We, therefore, were interested in the implications of GSK-3 phosphorylation/inactivation observed after E2 treatment on ERα activity. Previous reports suggest that only a small and specific pool of GSK-3 present in the cell is phosphorylated after a specific stimulus depending on the subcellular distribution of GSK-3 (16Jope R.S. Johnson G.V.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 95-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar). To localize the cellular site of GSK-3 phosphorylation under E2 influence, we fractionated cells at various time periods after E2 treatment. E2 stimulation resulted in a rapid phosphorylation of cytoplasmic GSK-3, whereas GSK-3 located in the nucleus remained unphosphorylated (Fig. 2D). At 20 min of E2 treatment, when maximum interaction of GSK-3β and ERα was observed (Fig. 2B), ERα had translocated into the nucleus where it interacted with nuclear GSK-3β (Fig. 2C), which was in the unphosphorylated (active) state. It is concluded that ERα forms complexes with active GSK-3β in both unstimulated and E2-stimulated cells. The ERα domain mediating the interaction between GSK-3 and ERα was mapped by generating truncated mutants lacking the A, AB, and F domains of the receptor (Fig. 3A). After co-expression of the mutants with GSK-3β in ER-negative COS-1 cells, all ERα mutants were co-immunoprecipitated with GSK-3β except that lacking the AB domain, revealing the B domain of ERα as the domain interacting with GSK-3 (Fig. 3B). GSK-3 Phosphorylates ERα at Two Motifs in Vitro—The interaction of active endogenous GSK-3 with ERα in unstimulated MELN cells and of ERα and GSK-3β expressed in COS-1 cells suggested ERα to represent a substrate for GSK-3 acting as a docking kinase. This was confirmed by a radioactive in vitro kinase assay using recombinant human ERα and rabbit GSK-3β, in which a strong phosphorylation of ERα was obtained (Fig. 4A). Next, we identified the serine residues of ERα that are phosphorylated by GSK-3. It has been reported that GSK-3 recognizes two different substrate motifs characterized by either primed or non-primed phosphorylation sites (17Frame S. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1274) Google Scholar). Primed substrates of GSK-3 are phosphorylated by another kinase at a Ser/Thr site that is located four amino acids C-terminal to the target site, which primes the substrate for phosphorylation by GSK-3. This primed motif (S/T)XXX(pS/pT; pS and pT are phosphorylated Ser and Thr) is found in proline-rich regions of substrates such as glycogen synthase (27Fiol C.J. Mahrenholz A.M. Wang Y. Roeske R.W. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14042-14048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), CREB (28Fiol C.J. Williams J.S. Chou C.H. Wang Q.M. Roach P.J. Andrisani O.M. J. Biol.

Cell. 2002; 108: 837-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1658) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4B). Although the majority of GSK-3 substrates seem to be primed, GSK-3 also phosphorylates non-primed sites at (Ser/Thr)-Pro motifs. Examples of non-primed substrates are cyclin D1 (30Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1857) Google Scholar), Tau (31Agarwal-Mawal A. Qureshi H.Y. Cafferty P.W. Yuan Z. Han D. Lin R. Paudel H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12722-12728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4C), axin, and the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene product. Amino acid sequence comparison of the ERα B domain and known GSK-3 substrates (Figs. 4, B and C) revealed two putative GSK-3 phosphorylation sites in the ERα B domain, namely the motif Ser-102, -104, and -106 and Ser-118. To identify the sites phosphorylated by GSK-3, we generated a series of phosphorylation site-specific ERα mutants in which the serine residues 102, 104, and 118 were mutated to alanine individually (S102A, S104A, S118A) and a triple mutant in which the serines 102, 104, and 106 were all replaced by alanine (S102A,S104A,S106A). We further generated GST-ERα fusion proteins containing the amino acid residues 76-176 (GST-ERα-(76-176)) of the wild type ERα and the different ERα mutants described. By means of in vitro kinase assays we tested GSK-3β for its ability to phosphorylate these fusion proteins (Fig. 4D). Phosphorylation of the S118A mutant was only slightly weaker compared with the wild type (GST-ERαWT-(76-176)), whereas phosphorylation of the S102A, S104A, and S102A,S104A,S106A mutants was markedly weaker compared with the wild type. Comparison of S102A and S104A phosphorylation revealed a weaker signal in the S104A mutant, indicating that Ser-102 is not phosphorylated if Ser-104 is mutated. This phosphorylation pattern reflects a sequential phosphorylation from the C to the N terminus of the protein that is characteristic for GSK-3. The findings are in agreement with a study that described the disappearance of four phosphorylation sites with mutations of Ser-104 and Ser-106 in the ERα (32Le Goff P. Montano M.M. Schodin D.J. Katzenellenbogen B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4458-4466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, the phosphorylated S102A mutant and to a higher degree the S104A and S102A,S104A,S106A mutants showed an upshift in migration compared with the wild type and the S118A mutant (Fig. 4D). This upshift is characteristic for Ser-118 phosphorylation (33Joel P.B. Traish A.M. Lannigan D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13317-13323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), indicating that Ser-118 can be phosphorylated in these mutants by GSK-3β. The weak signal in 32P incorporation observed with the S102A,S104A,S106A mutant agrees with the slightly lower phosphorylation of the S118A mutant observed in comparison with the wild type and can only be explained by Ser-118 phosphorylation as other serines or threonines that could be phosphorylated were not present in this mutant. This was confirmed using another mutant in which Ser-102, Ser-104, Ser-106, and Ser-118 were all replaced by alanine and which was not phosphorylated, suggesting that other amino acid residues of the ERα B domain are not phosphorylated by GSK-3β. Next we studied the impact of the four putative GSK-3 phosphorylation sites on ERα transcriptional activity in vivo. Expression of full-length ERα carrying the different mutations described in ERα-negative MDA-MB231 cells resulted in reduction of E2-induced luciferase activity (Fig. 4E). Similar results were obtained after supertransfection of MELN cells with the ERα mutants (Supplemental Fig. 1). Mutation of any of the serine residues resulted in reduction of ERα activity, which indicates that all serine residues determined as GSK-3 phosphorylation sites in vitro were required for full transcriptional activation of ERα in vivo. This agrees with the findings of other groups using different cell systems (6Castano E. Chen C.W. Vorojeikina D.P. Notides A.C. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 65: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 9Kato S. Endoh H. Masuhiro Y. Kitamoto T. Uchiyama S. Sasaki H. Masushige S. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Kawashima H. Metzger D. Chambon P.

HtpX underwent self-degradation upon cell disruption or membrane solubilization. Consequently, we purified HtpX under denaturing conditions and then refolded it in the presence of a zinc chelator. When supplemented with Zn2+, the purified enzyme exhibited self-cleavage activity. In the presence of zinc, it also degraded casein and cleaved a solubilized membrane protein, SecY.

It is vital for cells that membranes and membrane proteins retain their integrity. Malfolded and misassembled membrane proteins, produced under stressful conditions and in non-physiological situations, should receive proteolytic quality control. In Escherichia coli, FtsH, a membrane-bound and ATP-dependent zinc metalloprotease, is known to play a central role in the degradation of unstable membrane proteins (1Akiyama Y. Ogura T. Ito K. Barret A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Second Ed., Academic Press, London2004: 794-798Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 2Ito K. Akiyama Y. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 59: 211-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Thus, it degrades SecY, a subunit of protein translocase (3Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4532-4536Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), and Fo subunit a of proton ATPase (4Akiyama Y. Kihara A. Ito K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 26-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) when they have failed to assemble. It also degrades YccA, the function of which is unknown (5Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 175-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and some unstable cytosolic proteins (1Akiyama Y. Ogura T. Ito K. Barret A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F.

Microbiol. 2005; 59: 211-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). A characteristic feature of FtsH is that it processively degrades membrane-protein substrates by recognizing their ends when they protrude sufficiently into the cytosol (6Chiba S. Akiyama Y. Mori H. Matsuo E. Ito K. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 7Chiba S. Akiyama Y. Ito K. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4775-4782Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This degradation appears to be accompanied by dislocation of the substrate from the membrane, a process presumably mediated by the ATPase function of FtsH (8Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2970-2981Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 9Akiyama Y. Ito K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3888-3895Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 10Akiyama Y. Ito K. J. Biol.

In E. coli, only a few other membrane-integrated proteases are known: DegS and RseP (YaeL), which introduce regulated cleavage into a membrane-bound substrate (11Ades S.E. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2004; 7: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 12Akiyama Y. Kanehara K. Ito K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4434-4442Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 13Grigorova I.L.

Dalbey R.E. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4549-4580Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). HtpX was first described by Kornitzer et al. (15Kornitzer D. Teff D. Altuvia S. Oppenheim A.B. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2944-2953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as a heat-inducible protein from E. coli with sequence features of a membrane protein and a metalloprotease. They showed that its expression, in a form truncated at the C-terminal, enhanced degradation of cellular proteins in puromycin-treated cells (15Kornitzer D. Teff D. Altuvia S. Oppenheim A.B. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2944-2953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, it was also shown that the htpX gene in Xylella fastidiosa was induced by an increase in temperature (16Coltri P.P. Rosato Y.B. Curr. Microbiol. 2004; 48: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), whereas the Streptococcus gordonii htpX was not heat-inducible (17Vickerman M.M. Mather N.M. Minick P.E. Edwards C.A. Oral Microbiol. Immunol. 2002; 17: 22-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Disruption of S. gordonii htpX caused changes in several properties of the cell surface, although the relationship of these changes with any protease activity of HtpX was unclear (17Vickerman M.M. Mather N.M. Minick P.E. Edwards C.A. Oral Microbiol. Immunol. 2002; 17: 22-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We rediscovered HtpX during the course of study of cellular responses to “membrane protein stress.” Our results showed that ftsH disruption led to the induction of the Cpx stress response, which was exaggerated further by overexpression of SecY or Fo subunit a in the absence of FtsH (18Shimohata N. Chiba S. Saikawa N. Ito K. Akiyama Y. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 653-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). It was suggested that an unknown Cpx-controlled factor might function to alleviate the membrane stress (18Shimohata N. Chiba S. Saikawa N. Ito K. Akiyama Y. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 653-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Our screening for genes up-regulated by constitutively active Cpx mutation (cpxA24) resulted in the identification of htpX as a Cpx-controlled gene (18Shimohata N. Chiba S. Saikawa N. Ito K. Akiyama Y. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 653-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We determined the cellular localization and topology of HtpX and showed that it has two transmembrane segments located at the N terminus and a large cytoplasmic domain, which includes two hydrophobic regions that probably interact with the membrane (18Shimohata N. Chiba S. Saikawa N. Ito K. Akiyama Y. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 653-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Although disruption of htpX alone was silent, its combination with an ftsH disruption resulted in a synthetic growth defect (18Shimohata N. Chiba S. Saikawa N. Ito K. Akiyama Y. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 653-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Complementation tests using the ΔftsH ΔhtpX strain indicated that the zinc metalloprotease active site motif in HtpX is essential for its functionality in vivo (18Shimohata N. Chiba S. Saikawa N. Ito K. Akiyama Y. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 653-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These findings suggested that HtpX functions as a protease, having cellular roles that complement or overlap those of FtsH. In this study, we have described some biochemical properties of HtpX and confirmed its proteolytic activity. Purified HtpX has the unusual ability to cleave itself autocatalytically in the presence of Zn2+. We have also described its ability to introduce endoproteolytic cleavages into SecY, in vivo and in vitro. Bacterial Strains and Media—E. coli K12 strains AD16 (F′lacIq) (19Akiyama Y. Ito K.

The htpX::tet marker was then P1-transduced into SC1060 and AD1691, respectively. L (22Davis R.W. Botstein D. Roth J.R. Advanced Bacterial Genetics: A Manual for Genetic Engineering.

Ampicillin (50 μg/ml), chloramphenicol (20 μg/ml), and/or tetracycline (25 μg/ml) were added for selecting transformants and transductants as well as for growing plasmid-bearing strains. Plasmids—pSTD343 was a derivative of pSTV29 (Takara) carrying the lacIq gene. pSTD576, a derivative of pSTD568 (18Shimohata N. Chiba S. Saikawa N. Ito K. Akiyama Y.

Plasmids encoding truncated variants of SecY were constructed by PCR amplification of the corresponding DNA regions using appropriate primers and template plasmids and cloning into pBAD33, pTWV228, and pUC118. The N-terminally truncated SecY variants had an extra initiation methionine residue at their N terminus. Cell Disruption Conditions—Cells were grown in L medium containing 1 mm IPTG 3The abbreviations used are: IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. and 1 mm cAMP at 37 °C for 2 h, washed with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, collected by centrifugation, and suspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 10 mm 2-mecaptoethanol. When specified, samples were further supplemented with 5% protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Pefablock SC (Merck), 1 mm tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, and 100 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor. For sonic disruption, cells were treated with three cycles of brief (20 s) sonication with cooling in an ice-water bath. For mild cell lysis, AD16-derived cells were grown as above, washed with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, and suspended in 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 20% sucrose. Samples were mixed with 1/10 volume of 1 mg/ml lysozyme dissolved in 0.1 m EDTA (pH 7.0) and incubated at 0 °C for 30 min. Membranes were then solubilized by the addition of Nonidet P-40 to a final concentration of 1%, subsequent repeated pipettings, and incubation at 0 °C for 1 h. Purification of HtpX-His6-Myc—Cells of AD16/pSTD650 and AD16/pSTD588 were grown in 8 liters of L medium containing 1 mm IPTG and 1 mm cAMP at 37 °C for 2 h, collected by centrifugation, washed three times with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, and suspended in 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 20% sucrose. Cells were treated with lysozyme as described above. Membranous materials were then collected by centrifugation, suspended in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, and incubated at 0 °C for 1 h and then collected again by ultracentrifugation. The “denatured” pellets were suspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 100 mm NaCl, 6 m urea, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) and incubated with 1% Nonidet P-40 at 0 °C for 1 h. Samples were clarified by ultracentrifugation, and supernatants were mixed with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose pre-equilibrated with buffer B (buffer A + 1% Nonidet P-40) and stirred gently at 4 °C for 1 h. Then, the suspensions were poured into a plastic column, which was washed successively with 12.5 column volumes of buffer C1 (buffer B + 10% glycerol) and buffer C2 (buffer C1 + 10 mm imidazole) and eluted with 10 column volumes of buffer D (buffer C1 + 200 mm imidazole). The eluates were dialyzed against buffer E (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 3 m urea, 1 mm mercaptoethanol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5% glycerol) and applied to a HiTrap Q HP column, which was developed with 20 column volumes of 0–300 mm NaCl linear gradient in buffer E. Peak fractions of HtpX, as detected by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining, were combined, concentrated 5-fold by centrifugation in Ultrafree-0.5 (Millipore), and subjected to Superose 6 gel filtration with elution with buffer F (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 200 mm NaCl, 3 m urea, 10 mm mercaptoethanol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5% glycerol). Finally, HtpX peak fractions were pooled and dialyzed extensively against buffer G (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm mercaptoethanol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5% glycerol, 1,10-phenanthroline). In Vitro Assays for HtpX-His6-Myc Protease Activity—Purified HtpX and a substrate protein were incubated at 37 °C in reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5% glycerol) in the presence of either 5 mm zinc acetate or 10 mm 1,10-phenanthroline. Samples were withdrawn at intervals, mixed with a quarter volume of 5× SDS sample buffer, incubated at 37 °C for 5 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Preparations of purified SecY and YccA were gifts from N. Shimokawa and S. Chiba, respectively. Pulse-Chase, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting Experiments—Cells were grown in M9 medium supplemented with 18 amino acids (20 μg/ml) other than Met and Cys, 2 μg/ml thiamine, 0.4% glucose, and 1 mm IPTG, and pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine for 1 min followed by chase with 200 μg/ml unlabeled methionine for the indicated periods. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were carried out essentially as described previously (27Shimoike T. Taura T. Kihara A. Yoshihisa T. Akiyama Y. Cannon K. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5519-5526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-HtpX serum was prepared using a synthetic peptide (NH2-SVGGEVIEQPRNERERW) corresponding to amino acids 61–77 of HtpX, after conjugation with keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Rabbit antisera against the N- and C-terminal regions of SecY have been described previously (27Shimoike T. Taura T. Kihara A. Yoshihisa T. Akiyama Y. Cannon K. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5519-5526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-Myc (A14) and anti-His (H15) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Cell Disruption and Membrane Solubilization Result in Self-degradation of HtpX—To characterize HtpX, we attempted to overproduce and purify it. An HtpX derivative carrying a His6-Myc bipartite tag attached to the C terminus (HtpX-His6-Myc) was expressed from a high copy number plasmid. Its cellular accumulation was examined by directly precipitating the whole-cell proteins with trichloroacetic acid. Immunoblotting analysis using anti-HtpX (Fig. 1) and anti-Myc (data not shown) antibodies showed that a protein of the expected size, about 35 kDa, accumulated after induction (Fig. 1A, lane 1). However, we consistently observed a marked reduction in the amount of HtpX present when cells were disrupted by sonication (Fig. 1, lane 2). When protease inhibitors were included in the sonication buffer, an additional, smaller fragment was detected (Fig. 1, lane 3, F1). For more gentle cell disruption, we used strain AD16, which is known to undergo lysis on simple treatment with lysozyme. HtpX-His6-Myc was expressed in this strain and examined for its accumulation before and after lysozyme treatment (Fig. 1B). Although lysozyme treatment of the HtpX-His6-Myc-expressing cells released substantial amounts of cytoplasmic proteins, indicative of lysis (data not shown), HtpX-His6-Myc remained intact without appreciable decrease in its accumulation level (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 2). We then proceeded to the solubilization of HtpX, a step required for purification. When the crude membranes obtained above were treated with Nonidet P-40, a non-ionic detergent, HtpX was almost totally converted to the smaller fragment that remained stable even in the absence of protease inhibitors (Fig. 1B, lane 3). These observations suggested that HtpX-His6-Myc is degraded by cellular proteases after sonication or detergent solubilization of the membranes. This proteolysis also occurred in protease-deficient strains such as ΔftsH and ΔompT (data not shown). We next expressed a derivative of HtpX-His6-Myc with a mutation (H139F) in its metalloprotease active site motif (18Shimohata N. Chiba S. Saikawa N. Ito K. Akiyama Y. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 653-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). It was detected in its full-length form even after sonication (Fig. 1A, lanes 4–6) or Nonidet P-40 solubilization of membranes (Fig. 1B, lanes 4–6). Also, other HtpX mutants with abolished complementation activity (18Shimohata N. Chiba S. Saikawa N. Ito K. Akiyama Y. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 653-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) were found to remain stable after membrane solubilization (data not shown). This stability of the inactive variants suggested that the degradation is self-catalyzed. HtpX seems to undergo self-cleavage upon membrane disruption by sonication or detergents. Purification of HtpX-His6-Myc under Denaturing Conditions—We searched for conditions that allowed solubilization of HtpX without self-cleavage. Inclusion of metal chelators during solubilization did not prevent the cleavage (data not shown), suggesting that the zinc ion in HtpX was inaccessible under such conditions. Thus, it was essential to use protein denaturants to inactivate the enzyme. Lysozyme-treated cells were treated with 8 m urea before solubilization of the membranes with 1% Nonidet P-40, and HtpX was solubilized as the full-length form, which was expected to have been denatured by the urea (Fig. 1C). The use of 6 m guanidine hydrochloride instead of 8 m urea resulted in essentially the same result (data not shown). To purify HtpX in sufficient quantity for biochemical studies, cells of AD16 overexpressing the wild-type HtpX-His6-Myc protein or its active site variant HtpX(H139F)-His6-Myc were cultured on a large scale (8 liters), lysozyme-treated, and suspended in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride. Membranes were solubilized with 1% Nonidet P-40, and HtpX was purified by chromatography on a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column, an anion exchange column, and a gel filtration column, successively. The buffers used in the chromatographic procedures all contained 3 or 6 m urea to keep the proteins denatured and thereby to prevent self-degradation of HtpX, although a small amount of the self-degradation products was nevertheless generated during purification processes (see below). Finally, the urea was removed by extensive dialysis against buffer containing the metal-chelator 1,10-phenanthroline, allowing the proteins to refold. The addition of the chelator was essential to prevent self-degradation of HtpX during dialysis (data not shown). Analysis of the purified proteins by 12.5% Tricine SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2) showed that the wild-type preparation contained two degradation products (F1 and F2) with estimated molecular masses of about 21.6 and 6.6 kDa (Fig. 2, lane 1), but the mutant preparation was free of these fragments (Fig. 2, lane 9). HtpX Has Self-cleavage Activity—Purified and renatured preparations of the wild-type and mutant forms of HtpX were incubated at 37 °C in the presence of either 5 mm zinc acetate or 10 mm 1,10-phenanthroline (Fig. 2). In the presence of Zn2+ (Fig. 2, lanes 3–8), levels of the full-length HtpX-His6-Myc decreased over time with concomitant increase in the degradation products F1 and F2. In contrast, the levels of intact protein and the already present degradation products remained almost constant in the presence of 1,10-phenanthroline even after 8 h of incubation at 37 °C (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 2). The mutant enzyme HtpX(H139F)-His6-Myc did not exhibit any degradation/cleavage even in the presence of Zn2+ (Fig. 2, lanes 9 and 10). Similar results were obtained at 42 °C (data not shown). These results showed that HtpX has zinc-dependent self-cleavage activity. HtpX Degrades Casein—We next examined whether HtpX can proteolyze a commonly used proteolytic substrate, β-casein (Fig. 3). When β-casein was incubated with HtpX in the presence of Zn2+ for 8 h at 37 °C, its concentration decreased by more than 70% (Fig. 3, lanes 1–5). Self-degradation of HtpX also proceeded during this incubation (Fig. 3, lanes 1–5). Degradation of β-casein was negligible when it was incubated with HtpX-His6-Myc in the presence of 1,10-phenanthroline (Fig. 3, lanes 8 and 9) or with HtpX(H139F)-His6-Myc in the presence of Zn2+ (Fig. 3, lanes 6 and 7). Thus, HtpX not only shows self-cleavage activity but is also able to degrade other substrate proteins. HtpX Degrades SecY—We have previously suggested a role for HtpX, like FtsH, in eliminating abnormal membrane proteins (18Shimohata N. Chiba S. Saikawa N. Ito K. Akiyama Y. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 653-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether it can proteolyze membrane proteins. We chose two E. coli membrane proteins as possible substrates, YccA and SecY, both of which are known FtsH substrates in vivo and in vitro (1Akiyama Y. Ogura T. Ito K. Barret A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Second Ed., Academic Press, London2004: 794-798Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). We observed virtually no degradation of YccA-His6-Myc when its purified preparation was incubated with HtpX-His6-Myc in the presence of Zn2+ at 37 °C for 4 h (data not shown). In contrast, HtpX-His6-Myc was able to significantly degrade SecY (Fig. 4). When a mixture of detergent-solubilized and purified SecY preparation and HtpX-His6-Myc was incubated in the presence of Zn2+, the amount of intact SecY decreased, and SecY-derived degradation products accumulated in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 4A, lanes 1–3). This decrease in the amount of intact SecY was partly a result of the formation of SDS-resistant aggregates (28Akiyama Y. Ehrmann M. Kihara A. Ito K. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 803-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), which we observed generally after the purification of SecY (Fig. 4, A and B). However, generation of the degradation products required both wild-type HtpX and Zn2+ (Fig. 4A, lanes 4–7), indicating that HtpX can cleave SecY endoproteolytically under the detergent-solubilized conditions. The SecY sample incubated for 8 h with HtpX-His6-Myc in the presence of Zn2+ contained at least four SecY-derived fragments that were reactive with a mixture of antisera against SecY N-terminal and C-terminal regions (Fig. 4B, lane 1, circles). Immunoblotting experiments using each antiserum separately identified two of the fragments (n(I) and n(II)) as having the N terminus and the other two (c(I) and c(II)) as having the C terminus of SecY (Fig. 4B, lanes 2 and 3). It should be noted that additional SecY fragments must have been produced that were not detected by the antibodies used in these experiments. HtpX-dependent Cleavage of Overproduced SecY in Vivo—The previous results showed that HtpX degrades solubilized SecY in vitro. We next examined whether similar degradation of SecY could be observed in vivo. Overexpressed SecY is degraded rapidly in ftsH+ cells, whereas it is stable in ftsH-disrupted cells (3Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4532-4536Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 9Akiyama Y. Ito K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3888-3895Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We found that disruption of htpX did not appreciably affect this degradation (data not shown), suggesting that HtpX at its chromosomally encoded level played, if any, only a minor role in the degradation of overexpressed SecY. We then co-overexpressed HtpX and SecY in an ftsH htpX double-deleted strain and followed the degradation of the latter by pulse-chase experiments (Fig. 5). Cells were grown in the presence of IPTG to accumulate HtpX-His6-Myc; the expression of SecY was induced with arabinose 10 min before pulse-labeling. In the HtpX co-overproduced cells, at least seven SecY-derived degradation products immunoprecipitatable with a mixture of anti-SecY N and anti-SecY C antibodies were generated during the chase periods (Fig. 5, lanes 6–10). No such fragments were observed in control cells carrying the empty vector plasmid (i.e. lacking the htpX-his6-myc gene) (Fig. 5, lanes 1–5). Immunoprecipitation experiments with the 120-min chase sample of the HtpX-His6-Myc-overproduced cells using anti-SecY C or anti-SecY N antibodies showed that three of the degradation products (N(I)–(III)) retained the N terminus, whereas the other four (C(I)–(IV)) retained the C terminus of SecY (Fig. 5, lanes 11 and 12). These results showed that HtpX is capable of cleaving a membrane protein, SecY, in vivo. The approximate SecY positions that received the HtpX-mediated cleavage were assessed by comparing the SDS-PAGE mobilities of the degradation products with those of genetically constructed SecY variants with N-terminal or C-terminal truncations (Fig. 6A). SecY shows aberrant SDS-PAGE mobility (29Ito K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 197: 204-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), so it was essential to use these SecY fragments as “size markers.” These comparisons indicated that N(I) had its C-terminal end within the fifth cytoplasmic loop (C5) of SecY, whereas N(II) and N(III) ended within C4 (Fig. 6, B and C). Similarly, C(I) and C(IV) had their N-terminal ends within C2 and C5, respectively, whereas C(II) and C(III) ended within C4 (Fig. 6, B and C). Thus, it was suggested that HtpX cleaves specific cytoplasmic regions of SecY in vivo. Several lines of in vivo evidence as well as its sequence homology with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ste24 protease suggested that E. coli HtpX is a protease. However, no direct evidence of its proteolytic activity was available. In this work, we purified and characterized HtpX to address this issue. HtpX self-cleaved when cells were broken by sonication or when the membrane was solubilized with a detergent, so we were forced to purify it under denaturing conditions. Fortunately, the denaturation appeared to be reversible, and we were able to refold the protein; the addition of the essential ligand, Zn2+, restored protease activity to the preparation. The purified and reactivated HtpX exhibited self-cleavage activity and was capable of degrading a soluble protein, β-casein, and a membrane protein, SecY. These reactions were dependent on the presence of zinc and not observed for an HtpX variant that had an altered zinc-metalloprotease active site motif. These results established that HtpX is a protease, the substrates of which include membrane proteins. Indeed, we have shown that HtpX is able to proteolyze overproduced SecY in vivo in the absence of FtsH. Both in vivo and in vitro, HtpX introduced cleavages into SecY to produce discrete fragments. Also, it is likely that internal cuts were introduced into HtpX itself in the self-cleavage reaction. These observations indicated that HtpX is an endopeptidase. Both FtsH (1Akiyama Y. Ogura T. Ito K. Barret A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Second Ed., Academic Press, London2004: 794-798Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 2Ito K. Akiyama Y. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 59: 211-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) and HtpX are capable of degrading membrane proteins. A combination of htpX and ftsH disruptions causes synthetic cell growth defects (18Shimohata N. Chiba S. Saikawa N. Ito K. Akiyama Y. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 653-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The loss of FtsH or HtpX activates the Cpx extracytoplasmic stress response, which is also induced by overexpression of membrane proteins (18Shimohata N. Chiba S. Saikawa N. Ito K. Akiyama Y. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 653-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These results and observations strongly suggest that HtpX collaborates with FtsH to eliminate abnormal membrane proteins. Since the Cpx stress response is believed to be a cellular reaction to extracytoplasmic stresses (30Duguay A.R. Silhavy T.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1694: 121-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), HtpX may be unique among the Cpx-controlled gene products in that its active site is located on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane (18Shimohata N. Chiba S. Saikawa N. Ito K. Akiyama Y. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 653-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Our results suggested that HtpX cleaves the cytoplasmic regions of SecY in vivo, although it is apparently able to cleave both periplasmic and cytoplasmic regions of SecY in detergent extracts in vitro (data not shown for the cleavage points). These observations suggested that HtpX is involved in membrane-protein degradation as a component of the cellular machinery that acts from the cytosolic side. This was consistent with the notion of membrane stress responses; abnormal membrane proteins are expected to be attacked from both sides of the membrane. Kaser et al. (31Kaser M. Kambacheld M. Kisters-Woike B. Langer T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46414-46423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) reported recently that a membrane-bound metalloprotease called Oma1 functions in the degradation of a mitochondrial membrane protein in conjunction with Yta10/12, a mitochondrial homolog of the FtsH protease. Unlike HtpX, Oma1 was reported to cleave a substrate membrane protein on both sides of the membrane. Kaser et al. (31Kaser M. Kambacheld M. Kisters-Woike B. Langer T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46414-46423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) noted that the product of the E. coli gene, yfgC, has significant sequence homology to Oma1, and we noticed that HtpX also shows significant homology with Oma1 (see supplemental Fig. S1). Our Blast search results showed that E. coli has two other yfgC/htpX-related genes, ycaL and yggG.2 However, the intracellular localization and topology are unknown for the yfgC, ycaL, and yggG gene products, and disruption of these genes alone or in combination with disruption of ftsH or htpX did not cause a growth phenotype.2 Thus, the cellular role of the HtpX paralogs in E. coli remains unknown. In any case, the HtpX/Oma1 class of proteases may play similar roles in membrane protein quality control along with the energy-utilizing AAA proteases. Although HtpX and FtsH might have similar physiological roles, their mechanisms of action are expected to differ. Although the FtsH action is energy-dependent and processive (1Akiyama Y. Ogura T. Ito K. Barret A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Second Ed., Academic Press, London2004: 794-798Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 2Ito K. Akiyama Y. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 59: 211-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), HtpX is an energy-independent endopeptidase. Degradation of at least some membrane proteins by FtsH requires an N- or C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of sufficient length (6Chiba S. Akiyama Y. Mori H. Matsuo E. Ito K. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 7Chiba S. Akiyama Y. Ito K. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4775-4782Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar); it is unknown to what extent FtsH can initiate degradation internally. Cleavages within the cytoplasmic loop of a membrane protein by HtpX will generate new cytoplasmic tails that could serve as an initiation point for FtsH to eliminate the entire polypeptide. It should be noted that HtpX might also be involved in the degradation or cleavage of some cytoplasmic proteins, like another S. cerevisiae homolog of HtpX, Ste24, which catalyzes proteolytic maturation of a mating pheromone a-factor (32Tam A. Fujimura-Kamada K. Michaelis S. Barret A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, London1998: 1094-1096Google Scholar). We found that HtpX undergoes rapid self-cleavage upon disruption or solubilization of membranes and that the purified HtpX protein has intrinsic self-cleavage activity. Mass spectrometry analysis of in vitro-generated self-cleavage fragments of HtpX suggested that the cleavages occur between Leu-260 and Cys-261 and between Cys-261 and Ile-262 4 in the cytoplasmic domain. A C-terminally truncated variant of HtpX (residues 1–261), which mimics the self-cleaved product, did not complement the ΔftsH ΔhtpX defect4, suggesting that the self-cleaved form is inactive. Moreover, we have no evidence that this reaction takes place in vivo, except for some unusual situations of partial cell lysis and extreme overproduction.4 Therefore, it seems likely that the observed self-cleavage of HtpX is non-physiological and caused by artificial stresses during experimental manipulations, i.e. HtpX as a solubilized enzyme has intrinsic self-cleavage activity that is suppressed in the membrane-integrated in vivo state. Further genetic, biochemical, and structural studies will uncover the physiological function and regulation of this interesting membrane-bound protease. We thank N. Shimokawa and S.

https://openalex.org/W2078951917,"Cytotoxic T cells lyse only those virus infected target cells in vitro which express, in addition to the viral antigen(s), those K or D region products of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) which were present during anti-viral sensitisation in vivo. This 'associative recognition' by cytotoxic T cells could reflect the interaction of two T-cell receptors with specificity for target K or D gene products and independently for the viral antigen, or one receptor with specificity for virally altered K or D region products (see ref. 1 and refs therein). There are various ways that the MHC antigens could be altered, including 'modification from within', where the virus modifies host protein synthesis by interfering with transcription, translation or post-translational glycosylation; or 'modification from without' where enzymic or chemical alteration of cell membrane proteins are induced by virus activity at the cell surface. In this report we show that inactivated Sendai virus or isolated Sendai virus envelopes can serve to modify a cell and make it a specific target for Sendai-immune T-cell killing, thus excluding the possibility of 'modification from within' in this system."
https://openalex.org/W2013906146,"Bacterial heat-shock proteins, ClpB and DnaK form a bichaperone system that efficiently reactivates aggregated proteins. ClpB undergoes nucleotide-dependent self-association and forms ring-shaped oligomers. The ClpB-assisted dissociation of protein aggregates is linked to translocation of substrates through the central channel in the oligomeric ClpB. Events preceding the translocation step, such as recognition of aggregates by ClpB, have not yet been explored, and the location of the aggregate-binding site in ClpB has been under discussion. We investigated the reactivation of aggregated glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) by ClpB and its N-terminally truncated variant ClpBΔN in the presence of DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE. We found that the chaperone activity of ClpBΔN becomes significantly lower than that of the full-length ClpB as the size of G6PDH aggregates increases. Using a “substrate trap” variant of ClpB with mutations of Walker B motifs in both ATP-binding modules (E279Q/E678Q), we demonstrated that ClpBΔN binds to G6PDH aggregates with a significantly lower affinity than the full-length ClpB. Moreover, we identified two conserved acidic residues at the surface of the N-terminal domain of ClpB that support binding to G6PDH aggregates. Those N-terminal residues (Asp-103, Glu-109) contribute as much substrate-binding capability to ClpB as the conserved Tyr located at the entrance to the ClpB channel. In summary, we provided evidence for an essential role of the N-terminal domain of ClpB in recognition and binding strongly aggregated proteins."

Cupples L.A. Haines J.L. Hyman B. Kukull W.A. Mayeux R. Myers R.H. Pericak-Vance M.A. Risch N. Van Duijn C.M. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1997; 278: 1349-1356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The three common apoE isoforms differ at only two amino acid positions: apoE2 (Cys-112, Cys-158), apoE3 (Cys-112, Arg-158), and apoE4 (Arg-112, Arg-158) (10Weisgraber K.H. Rall Jr., S.C. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9077-9083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These sequence differences dictate different structural and biophysical properties that result in functional differences that are predicted to affect disease. One such property is the concept of domain interaction, originally proposed based on the differential binding of apoE4 to large triglyceride-rich very low density lipoproteins and apoE3 to smaller high density lipoproteins associated with the influence of positive charge at position 112 on binding (11Weisgraber K.H. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 1503-1511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on x-ray crystallographic analysis of the amino-terminal domains of apoE3 and apoE4 and mutagenesis analysis of the carboxyl-terminal domain, domain interaction was later defined to include the formation of a putative salt bridge between Arg-61 and Glu-255 that was suggested to bring the two domains into close proximity (12Dong L.-M. Wilson C. Wardell M.R. Simmons T. Mahley R.W. Weisgraber K.H. Agard D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22358-22365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Dong L.-M. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19053-19057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). It was predicted that the presence of arginine at position 112 in apoE4 promotes the interaction of Arg-61 with Glu-255, whereas the cysteine in apoE3 and apoE2 results in an alternate packing of the Arg-61 side chain that was predicted to interact less with Glu-255 (12Dong L.-M. Wilson C. Wardell M.R. Simmons T. Mahley R.W. Weisgraber K.H. Agard D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22358-22365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of Arg-61 and Glu-255 for domain interaction was demonstrated by site-directed mutagenesis in which replacement of either Arg-61 with threonine or Glu-255 with alanine alters the binding preference of apoE4 from very low density lipoprotein to high density lipoprotein (13Dong L.-M. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19053-19057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). An in vivo mouse model of domain interaction has been generated by gene targeting replacing the threonine codon in the wild-type Apoe gene with an arginine codon at the position corresponding to 61 in human apoE (14Raffaï R.L. Dong L.-M. Farese Jr., R.V. Weisgraber K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11587-11591Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Recently, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between yellow and cyan fluorescent proteins fused to the amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains of apoE, respectively, was used to assess the distance between the two domains in living neuronal cells (15Xu Q. Brecht W.J. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Huang Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25511-25516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These data show greater FRET efficiency in an apoE4 construct than that of an apoE3 construct, consistent with closer contact between the two domains in apoE4 (15Xu Q. Brecht W.J. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Huang Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25511-25516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, to date, direct structural proof for the domain interaction concept is lacking, and how it modulates protein conformation and lipid binding is unknown. In this study, the distances between the amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains of apoE4 and apoE3 derivatives were probed using FRET and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. Based on the EPR data, a model of the spatial proximity of the amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains is proposed. Materials included (1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-3-pyrroline-3-methyl) methanethiosulfonate (MTE) from Toronto Research Chemicals (catalogue number O875000); QuikChange multisite XL mutagenesis kit from Stratagene; 5-((((2-iodoacetyl)amino)ethyl)amino) naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid (AEDANS) from Molecular Probes (catalogue number I14); egg yolk phosphatidylcholine, triolein, tris(carboxylethyl)phosphine, and N-ethyl-maleimide (NEM) from Sigma; dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) from Avanti Polar Lipids; YM-10 centriprep filtration devices from Amicon; bovine α-thrombin from Hematologic Technologies; and Slide-A-Lyzer dialysis cassettes (MWCO 10,000) from Pierce. ApoE Mutant Construct Setup, Expression, and Purification—Mutations were introduced into the cDNA encoding apoE4 with the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and a modified pET32a construct as a template (16Morrow J.A. Arnold K.S. Weisgraber K.H. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 16: 224-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). All sequences were verified by DNA sequencing. ApoE was expressed in Escherichia coli. The cells were harvested and lysed, and cellular debris was pelleted as described (16Morrow J.A. Arnold K.S. Weisgraber K.H. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 16: 224-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). ApoE was purified as described (17Hatters D.M. Peters-Libeu C.A. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26477-26482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). After the final gel filtration chromatography step in 4 m guanidine hydrochloride, the apoE-containing eluent from the column was collected and concentrated using a YM-10 centriprep and stored at -20 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by the extinction coefficient calculated from amino acid composition with a formula for denatured proteins (18Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (3003) Google Scholar). The calculated molar extinction coefficient at 280 nm was 4.495 × 104 m-1 cm-1 for all constructs except 2.788 × 104 m-1 cm-1 for clones FC1 and FC2 and 3.936 × 104 m-1 cm-1 for mutants with the 264C mutation. Refolding of Cysteine Containing apoE and Labeling with MTE, AEDANS, or NEM—Denatured stock protein (2.5 ml of 3 mg/ml in 4 m guanidine hydrochloride, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4) was dialyzed into ice-cold refolding buffer (100 mm ammonium bicarbonate, 1.5 m guanidine hydrochloride, 1 mm EDTA) with 5 mm dithiothreitol for 2 h at 4 °C using a Slide-A-Lyzer. The buffer was changed to ice-cold refolding buffer with 1 mm dithiothreitol and dialyzed a further hour at 4 °C. Samples were buffer exchanged into ice-cold refolding buffer using a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences). For spin labeling, 19 μl of 37.8 mm MTE (prepared in acetonitrile) was added to the sample with rapid mixing immediately after elution of apoE from the PD-10 column. For AEDANS or NEM labeling, 95 μl of 46 mm AEDANS or NEM (freshly prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide) was added instead of MTE. Samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C (in the dark for AEDANS labeling), and the free label and high molecular mass proteins were removed by gel filtration chromatography on a 2.5 × 120-cm column packed with Superdex 200 resin (Amersham Biosciences), pre-equilibrated in 150 mm NaCl, 0.25 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4 (TBS). Two peaks that typically eluted early in the fractionation range were collected; the first represented high molecular mass protein, and the second contained tetrameric apoE. The tetrameric apoE fraction was concentrated using a centriprep YM-10 at 4 °C. For unlabeled samples, protein was refolded by directly loading stock protein in 4 m guanidine hydrochloride, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, onto the Superdex 200 column. After elution and collection of the second peak, 0.1 mm tris(carboxylethyl)phosphine was added to maintain the cysteines in a reduced state. After concentration, protein was kept at a concentration of 1 mg/ml up to several days at 4 °C. The aggregation state of the protein was monitored using analytical gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (Amersham Biosciences) at various time points during the course of the experiments. FRET—The apoE constructs for FRET, FC1 and FC2, were prepared both unlabeled and labeled with AEDANS. Labeling was determined to be ∼1:1 stoichiometric as determined from the absorbance spectra of the labeled proteins and the extinction coefficients of AEDANS (6,100 m-1 cm-1 at 337 nm) (19Hudson E.N. Weber G. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 4154-4161Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) and the protein. This was confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry of the labeled constructs, which indicated an increase in the deconvoluted masses of both FC1 and FC2 by 309 mass units, and the lack of detectable masses corresponding to unlabeled protein (unlabeled calculated masses of 34,272.1 and 34,217.63 for FC1 and FC2, respectively). Tris(carboxylethyl)phosphine (0.1 mm) prevented disulfide formation in the unlabeled samples for at least 1 week under these conditions as assessed by non-reducing SDS-PAGE. Fluorescence spectra were collected using protein concentrations of 50 μg/ml in TBS with a PerkinElmer LS-5B fluorescence spectrometer and emission and excitation bandwidths set at 3 nm. For the samples complexed to DMPC, samples were prepared as follows. DMPC (5 mg/ml) in TBS was sonicated for 10 min with a small probe and added to apoE tetramer (1 mg/ml) at a mass ratio of 3.75:1, and the mixture was incubated overnight at 24 °C. The complex was separated from residual free DMPC and unbound apoE by density gradient centrifugation: the apoE·DMPC solution (1.65 ml) was added on top of d = 1.21 g/ml (1.65 ml) and d = 1.12 g/ml (1.65 ml) potassium bromide solutions in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, in a 13 × 51-mm polyallomer tube. Samples were spun overnight at 55,000 rpm in a SW41 rotor (Beckman/Coulter) at 15 °C. Tubes were fractionated into 0.5-ml fractions using a FC-80K microfractionator (Gilson). Samples encompassing the highest concentrations of apoE were collected and dialyzed into TBS. Samples were complexed to dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) as described (20Matz C.E. Jonas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4535-4540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and separated from free DPPC and apoE by centrifugation as described above for the DMPC complexes. FRET efficiencies were calculated as shown in Equation I E=1-QDAQD(Eq. 1) where QDA is the quantum yield of the donor in the presence of AEDANS and QD is the quantum yield of the donor lacking AEDANS. Quantum yields were determined using tryptophan in TBS as a reference assuming Q = 0.14 (21Kirby E.P. Steiner R.F. J. Phys. Chem. 1970; 74: 4480-4490Crossref Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The spectral overlap integral (J) was determined as shown in Equation 2 by J=∫FD(λ)ϵ(λ)λ4∂λ(Eq. 2) where ϵ(λ) is the molar extinction coefficient of the acceptor at wave-length λ and FD(λ) is the fluorescence of the donor normalized against the total fluorescence on the wavelength scale. EPR Spectroscopy—Refolded and labeled samples were concentrated to 1.5-3 mg/ml with a centriprep YM-10. Samples were prepared in TBS at final concentrations of 1 mg/ml for apoE alone and bound to DMPC and 0.9 mg/ml for apoE with emulsions. After preparation, all samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C before EPR spectroscopy. For the DMPC samples, a DMPC solution (50 mg/ml solubilized in TBS by incubation at 42 °C for 30 min) was added to apoE at a final concentration of 5 mg/ml and equilibrated at 24 °C for 30 min. For the emulsion-bound apoE, unfractionated emulsions of egg yolk phosphatidylcholine and triolein were prepared in TBS as described (22Perugini M.A. Schuck P. Howlett G.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5939-5949Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Emulsions were concentrated by centrifugation at 40,000 rpm in 11 × 34-mm polycarbonate tubes in a TLA100.2 rotor (Beckman/Coulter) and were mostly between 20 and 40 nm in radius as assessed by sucrose gradient fractionation and dynamic light scattering as described (22Perugini M.A. Schuck P. Howlett G.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5939-5949Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Concentration of phospholipid was established using an enzymatic assay kit (Waco). Emulsions were added to apoE at a final phospholipid concentration of 14.5 mm. Based on previous binding data (Kd = 0.5-1.2 μm and a binding capacity of 0.8-3.0 amino acids/phospholipid), this phospholipid concentration is predicted to result in ∼90% of apoE bound to the emulsions (22Perugini M.A. Schuck P. Howlett G.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5939-5949Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 23Yokoyama S. Kawai Y. Tajima S. Yamamoto A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 16375-16382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the labeling efficiency, the number of spins/mg protein was determined from the integrated intensity of the sample in 5.2 m guanidine hydrochloride solution, prepared by adding guanidine hydrochloride (97 mg) to 125 μl of stock protein. All sites were spin labeled at 96% or greater efficiency. For comparison of the distances between position 76 and 241, the labeling efficiency of protein containing the R61T mutation was 99.4% of the protein containing the native arginine. EPR spectra were collected on a JEOL X-band spectrometer equipped with a loop gap resonator. Approximately 4 μl of sample was placed in a sealed quartz capillary tube. Spectra were acquired at 20-22 °C with a single 60-s scan over 100 G at a microwave power of 2 milliwatts and a modulation amplitude optimized to the natural line width of the attached nitroxide. Interspin Distance Calculations—Distances within the range of 10-22 Å were determined from the spectral broadening of the double-labeled sample, compared with the composite spectrum from the two corresponding single-labeled samples. Distances were calculated by Fourier deconvolution of the spectrum for the dipolar broadening as represented by a Pake pattern (24Altenbach C. Oh K.-J. Trabanino R.J. Hideg K. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15471-15482Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 25Rabenstein M.D. Shin Y.-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8239-8243Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). The interspin distance was calculated using a computer program (24Altenbach C. Oh K.-J. Trabanino R.J. Hideg K. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15471-15482Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) kindly provided by C. Altenbach that determines the splitting that best reconstructs the broadened spectrum for discrete populations of interacting spins. Before analysis, spectra were examined for labeling efficiency (efficiency for all samples was within 2% of a standard reference) and normalized to the same number of spins. Molecular Modeling—Modeling and visualization were carried out using Insight II (Accelrys, Inc.) and PyMol (DeLano Scientific LLC; www.pymol.org) software. Molecular models were constructed using the crystal structure of the amino-terminal domain of apoE4 (3Wilson C. Wardell M.R. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Agard D.A. Science. 1991; 252: 1817-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar) and residues 238-265 of the carboxyl-terminal domain fixed as a rigid helix. Distances obtained from double spin-labeled samples were used to model the placement of the carboxyl-terminal fragment relative to the amino-terminal four-helix bundle. The calculated distances represent the distance between the ring nitrogens of the dipolar-coupled pair. The spin-labeled side chains were placed in a conformation relative to a backbone of fixed secondary structure that is found to predominate for single component spectra (26Langen R. Oh K.J. Cascio D. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8396-8405Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Whereas positions 76, 241, and 263 appear dominated by a single component, position 77 shows two components. Thus the spin-labeled side chain at position 77 is likely to adopt more than one conformation, though the model employs only the most likely conformation. Domain Interaction as Monitored by FRET—The structural proximity of the two domains of apoE was investigated using FRET based on the construct in Fig. 1A. These derivatives of apoE utilize the native four amino-terminal tryptophans as FRET donors. The carboxyl-terminal tryptophans at positions 210 and 276 were replaced with phenylalanine, and the tryptophan at position 264 was replaced with a cysteine, which was used to covalently attach AEDANS as a FRET acceptor. Two variants of the FRET construct, FC1 and FC2, were prepared to assess the influence of domain interaction on the conformation. FC1 is a mimic for apoE4. FC2 is a derivative of FC1 containing a threonine substitution at position 61, which abolishes domain interaction (12Dong L.-M. Wilson C. Wardell M.R. Simmons T. Mahley R.W. Weisgraber K.H. Agard D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22358-22365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, FC2 is a mimic for apoE3. After AEDANS labeling, both proteins remained tetrameric over the time frame of the experiment as determined by a single peak eluting from a gel filtration column (Fig. 2). Fluorescence spectra of FC1 and FC2 were first collected in a lipid-free tetrameric state with selective excitation of the tryptophans at a wavelength of 292 nm (Fig. 3A). AEDANS fluorescence occurred concurrently with the tryptophan fluorescence, indicating FRET. Differences in the emission intensities suggest that FRET is greater in FC1 than FC2 (Fig. 3A). Unlabeled FC1 and FC2 gave identical spectra, indicating that the tryptophans are collectively in identical microenvironments for both constructs and that the differences observed in the labeled samples are attributed solely to different FRET efficiencies (TABLE ONE). Independent protein preparations and labeling gave the same result, with an average difference in the emission intensity ratio 470 nm/350 nm of 21.7% (±3.7% S.D., p = 0.002, paired Student's t test) between FC1 and FC2. These data are consistent with the amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains of apoE4 being closer together than those of apoE3 in the lipid-free state, as predicted by domain interaction.FIGURE 3Fluorescence spectra of unlabeled and AEDANS-labeled FC1 and FC2 apoE.

Upon binding, apoE remodels the phospholipid into small particles, resembling high density lipoprotein particles found in cerebrospinal fluid (27Innerarity T.L. Pitas R.E. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4186-4190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As observed with the lipid-free protein, FC1 and FC2 retained differential FRET efficiencies in both lipid complexes, demonstrating that conformational differences in apoE4 and apoE3 are sustained in a phospholipid-bound state (Fig. 3, B and C; TABLE ONE). As a control, fluorescence spectra were measured for FC1 and FC2 in 1% SDS to disrupt tertiary structure (Fig. 3D). The FC1 and FC2 spectra were identical, and the AEDANS fluorescence was substantially reduced, indicating a loss of FRET in both FC1 and FC2. Similarly, addition of 7 m guanidine hydrochloride resulted in diminished AEDANS fluorescence and a shift in the tryptophan emission intensities to longer wavelengths, consistent with conformational denaturation and its associated reduction in FRET (data not shown). Domain Interaction as Probed by EPR Spectroscopy—Because all four tryptophans in the amino-terminal domain were used as donors in the FRET studies, only relative distances can be compared between the domains in apoE4 and apoE3. To determine the actual spatial relationship of the amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains, EPR spectroscopy was employed. Five positions, two in the amino-terminal domain and three in the carboxyl-terminal domain, were chosen for placement of cysteine residues (Fig. 1B). The five single cysteine mutants were produced. In addition, six double mutants were produced with one cysteine in each of the domains (Fig. 1B). All spin-labeled single and double mutants were evaluated for aggregation and tetramer formation by gel filtration. Only those mutants that existed primarily as tetramers and remained soluble for the time frame of the measurements were used in the analysis. EPR Line Shapes of Single-labeled Proteins—The EPR spectra of apoE4 containing a single site-directed spin label are shown in Fig. 4, red and black traces. The amino-terminal spin labels at positions 76 and 77 showed moderately high mobility. This is consistent with their expected orientation on the exterior surface of the four-helix bundle along a fixed α-helical backbone, based on the crystal structure of the amino-terminal domain (3Wilson C. Wardell M.R. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Agard D.A. Science. 1991; 252: 1817-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Position 77 showed a slight broad component in the low field region of the spectrum, which likely arises from transient contact with Tyr-74. The EPR spectrum of the carboxyl-terminal spin label at position 263 is consistent with a surface-exposed side chain attached to a backbone of fixed secondary structure (28Hess J.F. Budamagunta M.S. Voss J.C. Fitzgerald P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44841-44846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, the spin label at position 264, which falls along the same face of a projected α-helix, showed substantial self interaction. This was attributed to a dipolar interaction between the same sites (in the tetramer) and immobilization of the spin-labeled side chains due to the quaternary contact. Distances between Labels in the Amino- and Carboxyl-terminal Domains of apoE4—To model both the alignment and orientation of the two domains, analysis was performed on the tetrameric, double cysteine mutants of apoE. Spin labels were attached to a cysteine substituted at either position 76 or 77 and a cysteine substituted at positions 241, 263, or 264 (Fig. 1B). Evidence of dipolar broadening (or lack thereof) can be used to model the proximity between the amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains in apoE4 in these double cysteine-labeled samples. Fig. 4 shows spectra normalized to the same number of spins for each double-labeled spectrum (blue trace) overlaid with their two corresponding single-labeled samples (black or red traces), and the sum of the single-labeled samples (green trace). Thus, the spectrum of the double-labeled protein should approximate the spectral sum of the two corresponding single-labeled proteins where no intramolecular spin-spin interaction occurs. Interspin distances in the range of 8-25 Å influence the strength of the dipolar interactions and can be calculated from Fourier deconvolution of Pake patterns in the broadened spectrum (24Altenbach C. Oh K.-J. Trabanino R.J. Hideg K. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15471-15482Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 25Rabenstein M.D. Shin Y.-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8239-8243Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Three of the double cysteine samples, with spin labels at 76-241, 76-263, or 77-241, showed significant broadening and were analyzed by deconvolution, which gave interspin distances of 14.1, 21.2, and 18.7 Å, respectively. Uncertainty in these measurements is on the order of 3-5 Å, considering error inherent in the theoretical treatment (25Rabenstein M.D. Shin Y.-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8239-8243Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) of the broadened spectra and"

https://openalex.org/W2027629652,"Prostaglandins (PGs) have been implicated in the regulation of intraocular pressure (IOP) by facilitating the remodeling of tissues involved in aqueous humor outflow. A contribution of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)-dependent PGs to this process was emphasized by a recent study showing an impaired COX-2 expression in the nonpigmented ciliary epithelium (NPE) of patients with primary open-angle glaucoma. With the use of human NPE cells (ODM-2), the present study therefore investigated the effect of the antiglaucomatous drug latanoprost (PGF2alpha analog) on the expression of COX-2 and its association with the induction of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). In NPE cells, latanoprost led to a concentration- and time-dependent increase of COX-2 mRNA levels. Up-regulation of COX-2 expression was accompanied by phosphorylations of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and p42/44 MAPK and was abrogated by specific inhibitors of both pathways. PGE2 formation by latanoprost was abolished by the selective COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 and by the F-prostaglandin receptor antagonist AL-8810. Moreover, latanoprost led to a delayed up-regulation of MMP-1 mRNA, whereas the expression of MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-1, and TIMP-2 remained unchanged. Latanoprost-induced MMP-1 mRNA and protein expression was abolished by NS-398 and by COX-2-silencing small-interfering RNA. In line with this finding, MMP-1 expression was also induced by PGE2, a major COX-2 product. As a whole, our results show that MMP-1 expression by latanoprost requires prior up-regulation of COX-2. Induction of COX-2- and subsequent MMP-1 expression in the NPE may represent a potential mechanism underlying the IOP-lowering and antiglaucomatous action of latanoprost."
https://openalex.org/W1994092096,"Alternative splicing of the type II procollagen gene (COL2A1) is developmentally regulated during chondrogenesis. Chondroprogenitor cells produce the type IIA procollagen isoform by splicing (including) exon 2 during pre-mRNA processing, whereas differentiated chondrocytes synthesize the type IIB procollagen isoform by exon 2 skipping (exclusion). Using a COL2A1 mini-gene and chondrocytes at various stages of differentiation, we identified a non-classical consensus splicing sequence in intron 2 adjacent to the 5′ splice site, which is essential in regulating exon 2 splicing. RNA mapping confirmed this region contains secondary structure in the form of a stem-loop. Mutational analysis identified three cis elements within the conserved double-stranded stem region that are functional only in the context of the natural weak 5′ splice site of exon 2; they are 1) a uridine-rich enhancer element in all cell types tested except differentiated chondrocytes; 2) an adenine-rich silencer element, and 3) an enhancer cis element functional in the context of secondary structure. This is the first report identifying key cis elements in the COL2A1 gene that modulate the cell type-specific alternative splicing switch of exon 2 during cartilage development. Alternative splicing of the type II procollagen gene (COL2A1) is developmentally regulated during chondrogenesis. Chondroprogenitor cells produce the type IIA procollagen isoform by splicing (including) exon 2 during pre-mRNA processing, whereas differentiated chondrocytes synthesize the type IIB procollagen isoform by exon 2 skipping (exclusion). Using a COL2A1 mini-gene and chondrocytes at various stages of differentiation, we identified a non-classical consensus splicing sequence in intron 2 adjacent to the 5′ splice site, which is essential in regulating exon 2 splicing. RNA mapping confirmed this region contains secondary structure in the form of a stem-loop. Mutational analysis identified three cis elements within the conserved double-stranded stem region that are functional only in the context of the natural weak 5′ splice site of exon 2; they are 1) a uridine-rich enhancer element in all cell types tested except differentiated chondrocytes; 2) an adenine-rich silencer element, and 3) an enhancer cis element functional in the context of secondary structure. This is the first report identifying key cis elements in the COL2A1 gene that modulate the cell type-specific alternative splicing switch of exon 2 during cartilage development.

Through this process two or more mRNA molecules are generated from a single gene, leading to the synthesis of proteins that differ in structure and/or biological function (1Black D.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 291-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (1997) Google Scholar). Numerous reports have shown that some alternative splicing events are cell type-specific or developmentally regulated (2Roesser J.R. Liittschwager K. Leff S.E. J. Biol.

Constitutive removal of non-coding introns from pre-mRNA in the nucleus occurs via a complex set of reactions at exon-intron junctions called splice sites. These splice site sequences are recognized by specific small nuclear ribonucleoproteins and accessory protein factors that make up the spliceosome complex (8Burge C.B. Tuschl T. Sharp P.A. Gesteland R. Cech T. Atkins J. The RNA World. 2nd. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999: 525-560Google Scholar). Two bona fide intronic sequences are also required for constitutive splicing to occur in addition to the 5′ and 3′ splice sites; they are the branch point sequence and the polypyrimidine tract sequence, both present upstream of the 3′ splice site (8Burge C.B. Tuschl T. Sharp P.A. Gesteland R. Cech T. Atkins J. The RNA World. 2nd. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999: 525-560Google Scholar, 9Staley J.P. Guthrie C.

The information content present in these canonical splicing signals is generally not sufficient to ensure correct assembly of the spliceosome, especially in the case of regulated exons. Therefore, additional signals exist in the form of auxiliary cis elements (11Hertel K.J. Lynch K.W. Maniatis T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 350-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 12Schaal T.D. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 261-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 13Blencowe B.J.

Science. 2002; 297: 1007-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar), which can be present either within the exon or in the flanking introns. Subsequently, splicing can be affected in a positive or negative manner by trans-acting enhancer or silencer splicing factor proteins that bind to these cis elements (15Smith C.W. Valcarcel J.

In addition, other regulatory cis elements exist that are functional in the context of RNA secondary structure conformations (21Coleman T.P. Roesser J.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15941-15950Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 22Muro A.F. Caputi M. Pariyarath R. Pagani F. Buratti E. Baralle F.E. Mol. Cell.

Although it has been recently estimated that more than half of all human genes generate more than one mRNA due to alternative splicing, information on the molecular processes governing cell-type or developmentally regulated alternative splicing is limited. In this respect, the process of chondrogenesis is an attractive model to study alternative splicing since a number of important cartilage molecules are spliced during chondrocyte differentiation (24McAlinden A. Havlioglu N. Sandell L.J. Birth Defects Res. C Embryo Today. 2004; 72: 51-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In particular, the cartilage extracellular matrix proteins type II collagen (25Ryan M.C. Sandell L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10334-10339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), type XI collagen (26Chen Y. Sumiyoshi H. Oxford J.T. Yoshioka H. Ramirez F. Morris N.P. Matrix Biol. 2001; 20: 589-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), fibronectin (27Uporova T.M. Norton P.A. Tuan R.S. Bennett V.D. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 76: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and tenascin C (28Mackie E.J. Murphy L.I. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1998; 43: 102-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) are all alternatively spliced during cartilage development where a specific exon(s) encoding potential binding domains are spliced (included) in mRNAs expressed by chondroprogenitor cells but are skipped (excluded) from mRNAs expressed by differentiated chondrocytes. Of these molecules, type II collagen represents the simplest model and the best described alternative splicing event that occurs during chondrogenesis. Type II collagen is the major collagen component of cartilage extracellular matrix and is synthesized as a procollagen molecule of three identical α chains, α1(II), containing an amino and carboxyl propeptide (29Ala-Kokko L. Kvist A.P. Metsaranta M. Kivirikko K.I. de Crombrugghe B. Prockop D.J. Vuorio E. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 923-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The amino and carboxyl propeptides are subject to cleavage resulting in mature, homotrimeric collagen fibers that form stable fibrils in the extracellular matrix. Only one of the 54 exons encoding COL2A1 is alternatively spliced, producing two mRNA isoforms, type IIA and type IIB procollagen (25Ryan M.C. Sandell L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10334-10339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The type IIA procollagen mRNA isoform contains the regulated, cassette exon (exon 2) and is synthesized by chondroprogenitor cells, whereas type IIB procollagen mRNA, devoid of exon 2, is synthesized by differentiated chondrocytes. Transcription of type IIA procollagen occurs in other cell types during embryonic development (30Sandell L.J. Nalin A.M. Reife R.A. Dev. Dyn. 1994; 199: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 31Lui V.C. Ng L.J. Nicholls J. Tam P.P. Cheah K.S. Dev.

Sandell L.J. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1997; 45: 1469-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), but the developmentally regulated splicing switch from type IIA to type IIB procollagen apparently only occurs during chondrogenesis. In addition, the phenotype of a differentiated chondrocyte is defined by its expression of the type IIB procollagen isoform. Thus, the COL2A1 alternative splicing event essentially defines the process of chondrocyte differentiation and, as such, is an excellent model to study key mechanisms that control cartilage development. Exon 2 encodes a cysteine-rich (CR) von Willebrand factor C-like domain within the amino propeptide of type II procollagen. Homologues of this CR domain are present in other fibrillar collagen amino propeptides as well as in extracellular matrix proteins including thrombospondins, connective tissue growth factor, and chordin (34Garcia Abreu J. Coffinier C. Larrain J. Oelgeschlager M. De Robertis E.M. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 287: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 35Larrain J. Bachiller D. Lu B. Agius E. Piccolo S. De Robertis E.M. Development. 2000; 127: 821-830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that the CR exon 2-encoded domain of type II procollagen may have an important biological function during development by binding to growth factors such as bone morphogenetic proteins, similar to the function of chordin (35Larrain J. Bachiller D. Lu B. Agius E. Piccolo S. De Robertis E.M. Development. 2000; 127: 821-830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Zhu Y. Oganesian A. Keene D.R. Sandell L.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1069-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The presence of the type IIA procollagen isoform in other non-cartilaginous embryonic tissues such as heart, lung, kidney, and eye (30Sandell L.J. Nalin A.M. Reife R.A. Dev. Dyn. 1994; 199: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 32Ng L.J. Tam P.P. Cheah K.S. Dev. Biol. 1993; 159: 403-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 37Reardon A. Sandell L.

Eye Res. 2002; 24: 439-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) also suggests an important function for the CR domain during developmental processes. Furthermore, it has been reported that the immature IIA procollagen isoform is re-expressed during cartilage degradation, as seen in osteoarthritis (39Aigner T. Zhu Y. Chansky H.H. Matsen III, F.A. Maloney W.J. Sandell L.J. Arthritis Rheum. 1999; 42: 1443-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), suggesting an additional function for the exon 2-encoded CR domain during tissue repair. Two studies have been published on COL2A1 alternative splicing at the pre-mRNA level. One report (40Hatano H. Sarkar G. Bolander M.E. J. Orthop. Res. 2002; 20: 516-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) showed that a murine Col2a1 mini-gene was correctly spliced during insulin-dependent chondrocyte differentiation of murine ATDC-5 cells. The same group subsequently showed that deleting large portions of introns 1 and 2 still resulted in correct splicing of the Col2a1 mini-gene in ATDC-5 cells (41Nishiyama T. Hatano H. Kurosaka M. Bolander M. Sarkar G. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2003; 18: 1716-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). However, to date, there are no reports of specific cis elements or trans-acting splicing factor proteins that are important in regulating human COL2A1 exon 2 alternative splicing. Using a human COL2A1 mini-gene as a model system, the present study is the first to identify functional cis elements in intron 2 of COL2A1 pre-mRNA that modulate splicing of exon 2. RNA mapping analysis showed that a non-classical consensus splicing region adjacent to the 5′ splice site of exon 2 contains RNA secondary structure in the form of a stem-loop. This is the first study to experimentally show the existence of a stem-loop directly adjacent to a weak 5′ splice site of an exon that is regulated in a tissue-specific manner during development. We report that the double-stranded stem sequence, which is 100% conserved between species, contains both enhancer and silencer cis elements that are functional in regulating type II procollagen isoform expression during chondrocyte differentiation. From the data reported in the present study, we have proposed a model whereby the secondary structure of the stem-loop functions to mask the weak 5′ splice site. Functionally, it is the interaction of enhancer and/or silencer transacting splicing factor proteins with cis elements in the stem-loop region that determines the pattern of exon 2 splicing at a specific phase of cartilage development. Construction of a Human COL2A1 Mini-gene—A human COL2A1 mini-gene was constructed spanning exons 1–3, including full-length intron 1 and intron 2 sequences (Fig. 1). Three separate fragments of the mini-gene were synthesized by PCR from human genomic DNA (Clontech) using the elongase amplification system (Invitrogen). Each fragment was amplified using the primer pairs listed in TABLE ONE containing specific restriction enzyme sites for sequential cloning into pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). The cloned mini-gene (∼5.9 kb) is under transcriptional control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. The DNA construct was sequenced to confirm correct orientation and the absence of mutations.TABLE ONEPrimer pairs for amplification of the human COL2A1 mini-geneFragmentPrimer pairsSizekb1.

Schmid T.M. Harkey M.A. Eyre D.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and HEK-293 human embryonic kidney cells. COL2A1 mini-gene in pcDNA3 vector was transfected into each of the cell lines using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 1–3 μg of the mini-gene construct was transfected into each cell line at a ratio of 1:4 (μg/μl) DNA:FuGENE for 5 h in serum-free medium. Serum-containing medium was then added (final concentration, 10% fetal bovine serum), and the cells were cultured for a further 48 h until RNA isolation. Analysis of Spliced mRNA Isoforms Derived from the COL2A1 Mini-gene—Total RNA was harvested from each cell line 48 h after transfection using the Qiagen RNeasy kit. Approximately 1 μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed using random primers in a final volume of 20 μl, and the resulting cDNA was diluted to 80 μl with sterile water. 10 μl of cDNA was used for quantitative PCR in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP (10 mCi/ml, 3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences). The primers, pcDNA3-COL2A1-Exon1 (5′-CAAGCTTACATGATTCGC-3′) and sp6, were used to amplify cDNA derived only from the exogenously transfected COL2A1 mini-gene (Fig. 1). The linear range for these primers was established, and PCR was carried out for 20 cycles: 95 °C for 30 s; 55 °C for 30 s; 72 °C for 30 s. 10 μl of 6× loading dye (30% glycerol, 0.025% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 0.025% (w/v) cyanol blue) was added to each reaction, and 7 μl was electrophoresed at 200 V through 6% polyacrylamide gels. pBR322 DNA digested with MsbI was used as a size marker. Gels were dried and exposed to PhosphorImager screens (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h and then scanned on the STORM™ 840 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Bands corresponding to the type IIA (∼390 bp) and IIB (∼180 bp) mRNA isoforms were quantified using ImageQuant™ software. From these values, ratios of IIA:IIB mRNA spliced products were calculated for each cell type. Detection of Aggrecan and Type I Collagen mRNA—Primers were designed (TABLE TWO) to amplify aggrecan or type I collagen from total RNA extracted from each of the five cell lines (HEK-293, C3H 10T1/2, MC615, T/C28I2, and RCS). RT-PCR was carried out in the linear range as determined for each primer pair. Briefly, 2 μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed using random primers in a total reaction volume of 20 μl. An equal volume of water was added to the RT reaction, and 3 μl was used for PCR in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP (10 mCi/ml, 3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) in a total volume of 50 μl. PCR products (6 μl) were electrophoresed through 6% polyacrylamide gels. Gels were dried and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen (Amersham Biosciences) and scanned on a STORM™ 840 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Bands corresponding to aggrecan, type I collagen, or β-actin were quantified using ImageQuant™ software. Levels of aggrecan and type I collagen mRNA in each cell type were expressed relative to β-actin.TABLE TWOPrimers pairs for amplification of aggrecan and type I collagen mRNAmRNAPrimer pairsHuman aggrecanF, AGTGTCCATTCCCTCAGCCAGCCAR, GTCGATGAAATAGCAGGGGATMouse aggrecanF, AGGAATCCCTAGCTGCTTCGCAGGGATR, ACACCTTGTCTTGGTAGATGCTGTTGARat aggrecanF, ATCGCTGCAGTGATCTCAGAAR, CTCAATGCCATGCATCACTTCAHuman type I collagenF, AAGAGTCTACATGTCTAGGGTCTAR, TCCAGGCTGTCCAGGGATGCCATMouse type I collagenF, AGCACCACGGCAGCAGGAGGTTTR, CATTGGTCCAGGGCCAAGTCCAACARat type I collagenF, CAGATGTCCTATGGCTATGATGAR, ACCTCTCTCACCAGGCAGACCT Open table in a new tab Conservation Analysis of COL2A1 Genomic Sequence—The May 2004 genomic assembly of the human COL2A1 gene (chr12: 46, 679, 680, 700–746,778) was accessed on the UCSC Genome Browser (genome.ucsc.edu). The species conservation tracks showing the pairwise alignments were obtained through the conservation link. Twelve pairwise-aligned sequence blocks derived from Blastz alignments (43Schwartz S. Kent W.J. Smit A. Zhang Z. Baertsch R. Hardison R.C. Haussler D. Miller W. Genome Res. 2003; 13: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar) were scored by phastCons (44Siepel A. Haussler D.

Baertsch R. Rosenbloom K. Clawson H. Green E.D. Haussler D. Miller W. Genome Res. 2004; 14: 708-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar) was done using the following assemblies: human (May 2004), chimp (Nov 2003), mouse (May 2004), rat (June 2003), dog (July 2004), zebrafish (Nov 2003), and fugu (Aug 2002). Genomic sequence spanning the 5′ and 3′ splice site junctions of exon 2 was taken from blocks 3–9 and reverse-complemented to generate the final alignment (Fig. 4). Prediction of RNA Secondary Structure in Intron 2 of COL2A1—A stretch of nucleotides in intron 2 of COL2A1, directly adjacent to the 5′ splice site of exon 2, was predicted to contain RNA secondary structure in the form of a stem-loop (29Ala-Kokko L. Kvist A.P. Metsaranta M. Kivirikko K.I. de Crombrugghe B. Prockop D.J. Vuorio E. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 923-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The Zuker Mfold program (46Zuker M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3406-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (10412) Google Scholar, 47Mathews D.H. Sabina J. Zuker M. Turner D.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 911-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (3232) Google Scholar) was used to locate the potential site of interest in intron 2. The mRNA sequence corresponding to nucleotides 4191–4455 of COL2A1 (accession number L10347) was entered into the Mfold program accessed via the Macfarlane Burnet Centre Mfold server (mfold.burnet.edu.au). This mRNA fragment corresponds to the entire 207 bp of human exon 2 and the first 58 nucleotides of intron 2. The predicted stem-loop site is between nucleotides +4 and +41 of intron 2. RNA Mapping—RNase digestions were carried out to map the site of RNA secondary structure within intron 2 of COL2A1. A 265-bp fragment spanning exon 2 and the first 58 nucleotides of intron 2 were amplified by PCR using the wild-type COL2A1 mini-gene construct as the substrate. This fragment was subcloned into pcDNA3 using BamHI and EcoRI sites. RNA, corresponding to the antisense strand of the 265-bp exon 2-intron 2 fragment was synthesized by in vitro transcription (MAXIscript SP6™; Ambion) in the presence of [α-32P]UTP (10 mCi/ml, 3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences). The resulting, radiolabeled RNA probe was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation in the presence of 3 m sodium acetate (pH 5.2). Before enzymic probing, RNA was heated for 1 min at 65 °C and renatured by slowly cooling to 37 °C. 1 μl of either RNase T1 at 0.4 or 4 units/μl (Invitrogen), S1 nuclease at 2 or 20 units/μl (Invitrogen), or RNase V1 at 0.002 or 0.02 units/μl (Ambion) was added to 1 μg of radiolabeled RNA fragment in a total volume of 20 μl and digested for 15 min at 30 °C. A control aliquot of RNA without the addition of RNases was processed simultaneously with the digested samples. After digestion, RNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction, and 1 pmol was reverse-transcribed for 1 h at 37°C using Superscript™ II RNase H– reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) with a sense primer that hybridized to a region in exon 2 (5′-GTGAAGACGTGAAAGACTGCCTCA-3′) (Fig. 6). Samples were then treated with RNase H (0.5 units) for 20 min at 37 °C. After a final phenol/chloroform extraction, RNA was resuspended in gel loading buffer (95% formamide, 18 mm EDTA, 0.025% SDS, 0.025% (w/v) xylene cyanol, 0.025% (w/v) bromphenol blue), and 3 μl was electrophoresed through 6% urea, polyacrylamide denaturing gel. The gels were dried and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen (Amersham Biosciences) overnight and scanned on a STORM™ 840 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). To localize the sites of RNA digestion, the dideoxy chain termination reaction was carried out on the original pcDNA3 construct containing the 265-bp cDNA sequence encoding exon 2 and the first 58 nucleotides of intron 2 using a commercially available kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Reactions were carried out in the presence of 0.5 μl [α-32P]dATP (10 mCi/ml, 3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences), and samples were electrophoresed in parallel with reverse-transcribed RNA digests. Synthesis of Mutant COL2A1 Mini-genes—A series of mutant minigenes was synthesized devoid of large regions (300–500 bp) of intronic sequence. PCR was carried out to amplify two separate fragments of the mini-gene using specific primers containing ClaI restriction sites. The resulting fragments were gel-purified and ligated and a third PCR was done to amplify the ligated fragment devoid of the intronic sequence of interest. We named the mutant mini-gene with a 370-nucleotide deletion in intron 2 (adjacent to the 5′ splice site of exon 2) deletion mutant 1 (Del 1). Primers used to synthesize Del 1 were PCR 1 (forward primer +2542 BamHI, 5′-CTAGGGGATCCGGTTACGGC-3′, and reverse primer, –4406 ClaI, 5′-CCATCGATAATTACAACCAC-3′), PCR 2 (+4778 ClaI, 5′-CCATCGATCGATACCTTGTCTTA-3′, and reverse primer, –5140 EcoRV, 5′-GATAGGATATCTTGTATTGAATGCTGGGGAAG-3′), and PCR 3 (forward primer +2542 BamHI and reverse primer –5140 EcoRV). The deletion mutant cDNA fragment was confirmed by DNA sequencing and ligated into the COL2A1 mini-gene construct using BamHI and EcoRV restriction sites to replace the wild-type 2.6-kb fragment. Other mutant mini-gene constructs were synthesized by either substituting or deleting nucleotides near or within the apparent stem-loop sequence in intron 2. TABLE THREE lists all of the COL2A1 mutant mini-genes analyzed in the present study. Mutations were introduced using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Briefly, a complementary primer pair (purified by SDS-PAGE; Invitrogen) containing the desired nucleotide substitution or devoid of the nucleotide sequence of interest was added to ∼20 ng of substrate DNA. Substrate DNA was prepared by sub-cloning the wild-type 2.6-kb fragment of the COL2A1 mini-gene into pSP73 vector (Promega) using BamHI and EcoRV restriction sites. This 2.6-kb fragment contains the specific region of intron 2 that was to be mutated. By doing this, the construct size was reduced from ∼11.3 kb (size of COL2A1 mini-gene in pcDNA3) to ∼ 5 kb (the COL2A1 mini-gene 2.6-kb fragment in pSP73) to increase the efficiency of the in vitro mutagenesis procedure. PCR mutagenesis was carried out over 18 cycles (95 °C for 30 s; 55 °C for 1 min; 68 °C for 5.30 min), and the resulting PCR products were digested with DpnI (1 μl) for 1 h at 37 °Cto digest parental, methylated DNA. An aliquot (1 μl) of digested DNA was transformed into XL-1 Blue Super-competent Cells (Stratagene), and resulting colonies were screened for the presence of the correct mutation. Mutant colonies were selected, and the 2.6-kb fragment was re-ligated back into the COL2A1-pcDNA3 construct to create the mutant COL2A1 mini-gene. Transfections of these mutant mini-genes were done as described previously.TABLE THREECOL2A1 mutant mini-genesMutant mini-geneType and site of mutationDel 1Deletion in intron 2 (+11 to +380)+5′SSNucleotide substitutions, TGTA→AAGT (+3 to +6)SL-Del-1Deletion of stem loop (+7 to +43)+5′SS/SL-Del-1Combination of nucleotide substitution and stem loop deletionSL-Del 2Partial deletion of stem loop (+7 to +18)SL-Del 3Partial deletion of stem loop (+29 to +41)CCC-1Nucleotide substitutions, TTT→CCC (+ 8 to +10)CCC-2Nucleotide substitutions, TTT→CCC (+8 to +10) and TTT→CCC (+12 to +14)CCC-3Nucleotide substitutions: TTT→CCC (+8 to +10), TTT→CCC (+12 to +14), and TTT→CCC (+16 to +18)GGG-1Nucleotide substitutions, AAA→GGG (+35 to +37)GGG-2Nucleotide substitutions, AAA→GGG (+35 to +37) and AAA→GGG (+31 to +33)CCC-1/GGG-1Nucleotide substitutions, TTT→CCC (+8 to +10) and AAA→GGG (+35 to +37) Open table in a new tab Fig. 1 shows the human COL2A1 mini-gene containing exon 1, the regulated cassette exon (exon 2), exon 3, and full-length intervening intron 1 and intron 2. This genomic DNA fragment (∼5.9 kb) was cloned into pcDNA3 vector between T7 and sp6 RNA polymerase transcription initiation sites. Cloning of the mini-gene into pcDNA3 was done using the restriction enzyme sites shown. This human mini-gene contains the necessary bona fide sequences to ensure splicing (i.e. removal of introns 1 and 2) in vivo by any cell type. Transfection of this mini-gene construct and subsequent pre-mRNA splicing by cells used in the present study resulted in production of IIA and/or IIB mRNA isoforms that were distinguished by size difference based on the inclusion (IIA) or exclusion (IIB) of exon 2.

We cloned and overexpressed the absB gene product and purified a decahistidine-tagged version of the protein. We show here that AbsB is active against double-stranded RNA transcripts derived from synthetic DNAs but is inactive with single-stranded homopolymers. We thus designate the absB product RNase IIIS. Using T7 RNA polymerase and a cloned template containing the rpsO-pnp intergenic region, we synthesized an RNA substrate representing a portion of the read-through transcript normally produced in S. coelicolor. This transcript contains the sequences that form the putative rpsO terminator and those that form an intergenic stem-loop structure thought to be the site for RNase IIIS processing of the read-through transcript. We show that RNase IIIS does cleave that model transcript, with primary and secondary cleavage sites in an internal loop in the stem-loop structure. We have identified the primary and secondary cleavage sites by primer extension and demonstrate the further processing of the initial cleavage products. Thus, as is the case in Escherichia coli, the read-through transcript from rpsO-pnp is cleaved by RNase IIIS in S. coelicolor. However, the cleavage sites are different in the two systems. The positions of the cleavage sites in the stem-loop of the S. coelicolor transcript are more akin to those identified in the processing of bacteriophage T7 mRNAs. A kinetic assay for RNase IIIS was developed, and kinetic parameters for the reaction utilizing the model transcript from rpsO-pnp were determined.

A kinetic assay for RNase IIIS was developed, and kinetic parameters for the reaction utilizing the model transcript from rpsO-pnp were determined. Ribonuclease III is a double strand-specific endoribonuclease found in bacteria and eukaryotes. In Escherichia coli, RNase III is involved in the processing and maturation of viral, ribosomal, and messenger RNAs. Studies of the processing of bacteriophage T7 RNAs demonstrated an important role for RNase III and identified sequence features that determine the specificity of cleavage (1Li H.-L. Bhadrani S.C. Zhang K. Nicholson A.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1919-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 2Zhang K. Nicholson A.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

RNase III is involved in the processing of the 30 S ribosomal RNA precursor to pre-16 S and pre-23 S intermediates in E. coli, and the 30 S precursor only accumulates in RNase III-deficient mutants (4Dunn J.J. Studier F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 3296-3300Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 5Babitzke P. Granger L. Olszewski J. Kushner S.R. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 229-239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Of particular relevance to the present study, RNase III is involved in the processing of transcripts from the rpsO-pnp operon in E. coli. The operon is transcribed from two promoters, PrpsO, situated upstream of rpsO, the gene for ribosomal protein S15, and Ppnp, a promoter located in the intergenic region between rpsO and pnp, the gene for polynucleotide phosphorylase (6Régnier P. Portier C. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Transcription initiating at PrpsO produces a read-through transcript containing both rpsO and pnp, whereas initiation at Ppnp produces a pnp transcript only (6Régnier P. Portier C. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Secondary structure models and biochemical studies have confirmed the presence of a stem-loop structure in the rpsO-pnp intergenic region, upstream of the pnp translation start site (6Régnier P. Portier C. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 7Portier C. Dondon L. Grunberg-Manago M. Régnier P. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2165-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). This stem loop is present in both the read-through transcript and the transcript from Ppnp and is cleaved at identical sites in the two transcripts by RNase III (6Régnier P. Portier C. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 7Portier C. Dondon L. Grunberg-Manago M. Régnier P. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2165-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). RNase III cleavage of the pnp transcripts induces PNPase 2The abbreviation used is: PNPase, polynucleotide phosphorylase. autoregulation of pnp expression by an as yet unknown mechanism that may involve PNPase binding to the processed mRNAs to prevent their translation (7Portier C.

We have recently begun a study of pnp expression in Streptomyces. As in E. coli, pnp is transcribed from two promoters to produce an rpsO-pnp read-through transcript and a transcript initiating at an intergenic promoter, Ppnp (10Bralley P. Jones G.H. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 3160-3172Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The organization of the operon is conserved in Streptomyces antibioticus, Streptomyces coelicolor, and Streptomyces avermitilis (10Bralley P. Jones G.H. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 3160-3172Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Computer modeling predicted the formation of two stem loops or hairpins in the S. antibioticus and S. coelicolor rpsO-pnp read-through transcripts. We argued that the leftmost hairpin is the rpsO terminator, whereas the rightmost is the locus for ribonuclease processing of the read-through transcript (10Bralley P. Jones G.H. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 3160-3172Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In E. coli, Ppnp is situated between the rpsO terminator and the processed hairpin, allowing that hairpin to form in both the read-through transcript and the transcript from Ppnp (6Régnier P. Portier C. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In S. antibioticus, the –10 region of Ppnp is situated in the stem of the rightmost hairpin, thought to be the processing site. Thus, transcription from Ppnp does not produce a structure that is an obvious substrate for RNase III. Rather, computer modeling predicted a cloverleaf structure with several single-stranded regions (10Bralley P. Jones G.H. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 3160-3172Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Using primer extension and RNA ligase mediated reverse transcription-PCR, we identified a number of putative processing sites in the rpsO-pnp intergenic region of S. antibioticus. Our data suggest that, unlike the situation in E. coli, only the read-through transcript in Streptomyces is processed by RNase III cleavage, whereas the transcript from Ppnp may be processed by a single strand-specific endonuclease like RNase E (10Bralley P. Jones G.H. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 3160-3172Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To examine further the processing of the Streptomyces rpsO-pnp transcripts, we have overexpressed and purified the product of the absB locus of S. coelicolor (11Adamis T. Champness W. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4622-4628Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and show here that it is a double strand-specific endoribonuclease. We have synthesized a template corresponding to the rpsO-pnp intergenic region from S. coelicolor and have identified RNase III cleavage sites in that transcript. Those cleavage sites occur in a different position in the stem-loop as compared with the sites in the rpsO-pnp transcripts in E. coli, and these results coupled with our earlier observations (10Bralley P. Jones G.H. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 3160-3172Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) suggest that the processing of rpsO-pnp transcripts in Streptomyces differs in important respects from the corresponding process in E. coli. Our in vitro data are consistent with those obtained in vivo (10Bralley P. Jones G.H. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 3160-3172Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and summarized above for the processing of the rpsO-pnp intergenic region in S. antibioticus. Plasmid Construction and Bacterial Strains—To express the AbsB protein, an 819-bp fragment corresponding to the absB open reading frame from S. coelicolor (12Price B. Adamis T. Champness W. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6142-6151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was amplified by the PCR using primers SCABSBF2 and SCABSBR1 (TABLE ONE) with S. coelicolor chromosomal DNA as the template. The forward primer changed the absB start codon from GTG to ATG and introduced an NdeI site at the 5′-end of the PCR product and the reverse primer introduced a BamHI site just downstream of the absB stop codon. The fragment was cloned into pET11A (Novagen) and the resulting construct was designated pJSE1801. This plasmid was digested with NdeI and BamHI and the insert ligated to pET19b (Novagen) to create pJSE1811.TABLE ONEPrimers used in this studyPrimerSequenceSCABSBF25′-AGG TCT GAG CGG CAT ATG AGA GCC-3′SCABSBR15′-GAC GGG TCA GGC GGA TCC GGA CGC-3′rps15′-CAC AAG CAC GAC CAC CAC TCC-3′+ 16 R5′-TCG GCG TAG TGG GTC TCG TTC-3′TOPO R15′-CCA CTA GTA ACG GCC GCC-3′TOPO R25′-AGT GTG CTG GAA TTC GCC-3′Sc Px 45′-GAT GCC GAG GCG CTC GAC CAG-3′ Open table in a new tab To construct the plasmid used to synthesize the rpsO-pnp transcript, a 459-bp fragment of the rpsO-pnp intergenic region of S. coelicolor was amplified by the PCR from the plasmid pJSE600 using primers rps1 and +16R (TABLE ONE). pJSE600 contains a ∼3.1-kb fragment representing the entire rpsO-pnp operon of S. coelicolor. The PCR fragment was cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol and the construct was designated pJSE5600. Plasmids were verified for correct orientation relative to the T7 promoter by restriction digestion and sequencing. Expression and Purification of His-tagged AbsB—A 500-ml culture of BL21 (DE3) pLysS/pJSE1811 was grown at 37 °C with shaking in Luria-Bertani medium, supplemented with 50 μg/ml carbenicillin and 34 μg/ml of chloramphenicol to an A600 of 0.5–0.7, and induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside for 3 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the pellet was stored at –20 °C for at least 45 min. Cells were thawed by resuspending in 20 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.75 mg/ml lysozyme), incubated on ice for 60 min, sonicated briefly, and then centrifuged twice at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Purification was performed using the batch/gravity flow column method as described in the Talon immobilized metal affinity chromatography protocol (BD Biosciences Clontech), except that all washes were conducted at 4 °C and buffers were used at pH 8.0. Fractions from the Talon column were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, tested for activity using an RNase III cleavage assay (see below), pooled, and sequentially dialyzed against Buffer 1 (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 m NaCl, 150 mm imidazole, 5 mm MgCl2), Buffer 2 (same as Buffer 1, except without imidazole), and finally overnight against Buffer 3 (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 50% glycerol). Buffers were supplemented with 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and one Roche Complete protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Applied Science) per 250 ml. Enzyme was stored in Buffer 3 at –20 °C. Synthesis of Double-stranded Poly(G)-Poly(C) and Poly(A)-Poly(U) Substrates—Synthetic double-stranded substrates were prepared in 600-μl reactions containing 400 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5); 100 mm MgCl2; 1mm EDTA; 1.5 m KCl; 150 μm each ATP, UTP, CTP, and GTP; 0.1 mm dithiothreitol; 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin; 90 μg of either poly(dG)-poly(dC) or poly(dA)-poly(dT) (Amersham Biosciences); 100 μCi of either [α-32P]CTP or [α-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences); and 37.5 units of E. coli RNA polymerase (Sigma). Reactions were incubated for 3 h at 37°C. After incubation, an equal volume of TSE buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) was added. This mixture was extracted with an equal volume of phenol, and then an equal volume of ethanol was added to the aqueous layer. The solution was purified over a 2.0-ml column of Whatman CF11 cellulose as described (13Franklin R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1966; 55: 1504-1511Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 14Robertson H.D. Webster R.E. Zinder N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 82-91Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fractions containing double-stranded RNA were identified by liquid scintillation counting and pooled. Single-stranded substrates were prepared using only a single NTP in the transcription reactions and were collected by phenol extraction of reaction mixtures and ethanol precipitation. Synthesis of in Vitro Transcripts of the rpsO-pnp Intergenic Region—His-tagged T7 RNA polymerase was expressed from pBH161 as described (15He B. Rong M. Lyakhov D. Gartenstein H. Diaz G. Castagna R. McAllister W.T. Durbin R.K. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 9: 142-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) but purified using the Talon IMAC resin (BD Biosciences Clontech) as described above. pJSE5600 was linearized with BamHI and purified using the Qiagen PCR purification kit. Transcription reactions (20 μl) contained 30 mm Hepes (pH 7.8); 100 mm potassium glutamate; 15 mm magnesium acetate; 0.25 mm EDTA; 1 mm dithiothreitol; 0.05% Tween 20; 2 mm each ATP, CTP, GTP, and UTP; 1 μg of linearized plasmid DNA; 500 ng of His-tagged T7 RNA polymerase; and 40 units of RNasin (Promega) (15He B. Rong M. Lyakhov D. Gartenstein H. Diaz G. Castagna R. McAllister W.T. Durbin R.K. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 9: 142-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 16Milligan J.F. Uhlenbeck O.C. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar). Reactions were preheated for 2 min at 37 °C before adding RNA polymerase and then incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. Large scale transcription reactions were scaled proportionately up to 1 ml in order to produce 1-mg amounts of transcribed RNA. After transcription, the reaction was supplemented with CaCl2 to a concentration of 1.5 mm and digested twice with 1 unit of DNase I (Promega) per μgof DNA for 30 min at 37 °C. Mixtures were then extracted twice with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol, followed by extraction with chloroform and precipitation with one-third volume of 10 m ammonium acetate and 2 volumes of ethanol. The RNA was resuspended in water and stored at –20 °C. For internally labeled transcripts, 1 μCi of [α-32P]CTP was added per 20 μl of transcription reaction. In some experiments, transcripts were 3′-end-labeled using [32P]pCp and T4 RNA ligase (Ambion). Unlabeled RNA that had been dephosphorylated with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (Promega) was 5′-end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega). All radioisotopes had a specific activity of 3,000 Ci/mmol and were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. The full-length in vitro transcription product from linearized pJSE5600 is 573 bases in length and includes 72 bases of pCR2.1-TOPO vector sequence at its 5′-end and 42 bases of vector sequence at the 3′-end, downstream of the 459-base rpsO-pnp insert (See Fig. 3). RNase III Cleavage Assays—Cleavage assays were performed in 60-μl reactions containing 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, and 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. 32P-Labeled double- or single-stranded RNAs (3,000–6,000 cpm) were digested with increasing concentrations of purified AbsB (see Fig. 2; 100 ng of AbsB in a 60-μl reaction mixture is 52.7 nm). After a 10-min incubation at 37 °C, 50 μl of each sample was spotted onto Whatman GF/C glass fiber filter papers, which were washed twice with 10% trichloroacetic acid, 0.6% casamino acids, 0.4% sodium pyrophosphate and once with 70% ethanol. Papers were dried and counted by liquid scintillation. Activity was expressed as a percentage of the original amount of acid-insoluble radioactivity released in the incubation. Cleavage assays of the rpsO-pnp in vitro transcripts were performed in 10-μl reactions containing the same cleavage buffer described above and 0–200 ng of enzyme. Mixtures typically contained 3 μg of transcript (∼1.6 μm, 10,000–40,000 cpm). Reactions were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C and terminated by the addition of 10 μl of stop solution (U.S. Biochemical Corp.). The cleavage products from internally labeled and 3′- and 5′-end-labeled transcripts were separated on a 7 m urea, 5% polyacrylamide gel alongside Ambion RNA Century Plus size markers and visualized by autoradiography. Kinetic assays were performed as described above except that duplicate reaction mixtures containing 25 ng (79.1 nm) of AbsB and a 0.27–2.7 μm concentration of the 32P-labeled rpsO-pnp transcript were incubated for 2.5 min. Reaction mixtures were applied to 7 m urea, 5% polyacrylamide gels to separate the digestion products. Autoradiograms were scanned, and the densities of bands were quantified using the Scion Image for Windows software. The amounts of RNA in the fragment 1 band (see Fig. 4) produced by AbsB digestion were determined from standard curves generated using the intact 32P-labeled rpsO-pnp transcript and were converted to nmol of product using the calculated molecular weight of fragment 1. Initial velocities were calculated from these data and Lineweaver-Burk plots were used to determine kinetic parameters. Primer Extension Mapping of Cleavage Site—For each primer extension reaction, 3 μg of internally labeled in vitro transcript were incubated with 0–200 ng of purified AbsB as described above. The reaction mixtures were extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol and chloroform and precipitated with one-tenth volume of 3 m sodium acetate and 2 volumes of ethanol with the addition of 5 μgof E. coli tRNA as carrier. Primer extension reactions were performed as described previously (10Bralley P. Jones G.H. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 3160-3172Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), using primers +16R, Px4, TOPO R1, and TOPO R2. After primer extension, the reactions were treated with 2 units of RNase H (Invitrogen) and separated on a 5.2% sequencing gel. The primers were used with DNA from pJSE5600 to generate the sequencing ladder. Miscellaneous Methods—Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (17Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216391) Google Scholar) using the Bio-Rad Protein Reagent and bovine serum albumin as a standard. SDS-PAGE was performed as described by Laemmli (18Laemmli U. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207211) Google Scholar). All PCRs were performed as follows: 95 °C for 5 min and then 35 cycles at 95 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 2 min, 72 °C for 1 min, with a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The RNA folding program, mfold, version 3.1 was used to predict the secondary structure of the rpsO-pnp in vitro transcripts. Overexpression, Purification, and Activity Assay of the absB Gene Product—The absB locus of S. coelicolor was identified by Champness and co-workers (11Adamis T. Champness W. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4622-4628Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Aceti D.J. Champness W. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3100-3106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by mutational analysis and was shown to encode a global regulator of antibiotic production. Complementation of the absB mutation followed by DNA sequencing identified an open reading frame with significant homology to bacterial RNase III (12Price B. Adamis T. Champness W. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6142-6151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Champness and co-workers (12Price B. Adamis T. Champness W. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6142-6151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that the 30 S rRNA precursor accumulated in the absB mutants but did not characterize the AbsB activity further. We overexpressed the AbsB protein as a decahistidine-tagged derivative by cloning a PCR fragment in pET19B and purified the enzyme by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 1, an essentially homogeneous protein of the expected size, 31,600, was obtained. We examined the activity of the enzyme using double- and single-stranded RNA substrates prepared using E. coli RNA polymerase with synthetic DNA polymers as templates. Results of AbsB enzyme assays with radiolabeled poly(G)-poly(C) and poly(A)-poly(U) double-stranded templates, purified by cellulose chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures,” are shown in Fig. 2. The enzyme was quite active with poly(G)-poly(C), releasing nearly 50% of the label in the added substrate as acid-soluble material. In contrast, the enzyme was much less active with poly(A)-poly(U) as substrate and was completely inactive with the single-stranded RNAs, poly(A) and poly(C) (data not shown). It is not surprising that the enzyme did not completely solubilize the poly(G)-poly(C), since such substrates are known to contain single-stranded regions although they elute in the double-stranded RNA fraction from cellulose columns (14Robertson H.D. Webster R.E. Zinder N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 82-91Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We conclude that the absB locus encodes a double strand-specific endoribonuclease, an RNase III, and we thus refer to the absB gene product hereafter as RNase IIIS (S for Streptomyces). Organization of the rpsO-pnp Intergenic Region of S. coelicolor and Synthesis of the Read-through Transcript Substrate—A PCR fragment containing the S. coelicolor rpsO-pnp intergenic region was synthesized using primers rps1 and +16R (TABLE ONE) and cloned in pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen), downstream of the T7 promoter borne by the vector. The sequence of the PCR fragment and associated vector sequences is shown in Fig. 3. The fragment includes 153 bases from the 3′-end of rpsO, the rpsO-pnp intergenic region, and 26 bases from the pnp open reading frame. The sequences thought to form the rpsO terminator are shown in the figure as are the sequences that we believe form the stem-loop structure upstream of pnp. The –10 and –35 regions of S. antibioticus Ppnp are identical to sequences found in the S. coelicolor intergenic region (Fig. 3) (9Robert-Le Meur M. Portier C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and we posit that those sequences represent the intergenic promoter in S. coelicolor. The transcription start point specified by that promoter would be the T marked by an asterisk in Fig. 3. To synthesize a substrate for RNase IIIS, the pCR2.1-TOPO derivative described above, designated pJSE5600, was linearized with BamHI (site shown in Fig. 3) and transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase. For the experiments shown below, the transcript was collected by phenol extraction of reaction mixtures and ethanol precipitation. Essentially identical results were obtained with transcripts prepared by this method and with transcripts purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and elution prior to RNase IIIS digestion. It should be noted that the rpsO-pnp transcript studied here contains 72 and 42 bases at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively, derived from the pCR2.1-TOPO vector sequence (sequence in lowercase in Fig. 3). Secondary structure modeling studies indicated that these additional bases did not interfere with the formation of the rpsO terminator or the stem-loop structure, which we expected to be the target for RNase IIIS cleavage. Cleavage of the rpsO-pnp Transcript by RNase IIIS—Transcripts of the rpsO-pnp intergenic region, labeled internally with [32P]CTP, were utilized as substrates for RNase IIIS as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Reaction mixtures contained 3 μg of transcript and varying amounts of purified RNase IIIS. Reaction products were separated by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels in the presence of 7 m urea. As shown in Fig. 4, cleavage of the rpsO-pnp transcript produced two major and two minor fragments, at low ratios of enzyme to substrate (Fig. 4, lane 4). The measured sizes of the two major fragments, utilizing the RNA size standards shown in Fig. 4 as references, are ∼300 bases (fragment 1) and 170 bases (fragment 2). We believe that fragments 1 and 2 are the products of a single cleavage event (see below) and that their actual sizes are 373 and 200 bases, respectively. We argue that these two fragments migrate anomalously, even in the presence of 7 m urea, because of the persistence of secondary structure after RNase IIIS cleavage (20Sasaki N. Izawa M. Sugahara Y. Tanaka T. Watahiki M. Ozawa K. Ohara E. Funaki H. Yoneda Y. Matsuura S. Muramatsu M. Okazaki Y. Hayashizaki Y. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 222: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). At higher ratios of enzyme to substrate the intensities of fragments 1 and 2 decrease, whereas those of fragments 3 and 4 increase (Fig. 4, lanes 5 and 6). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that after the initial RNase IIIS cleavage that produces fragments 1 and 2, fragment 1 is cleaved further to produce fragment 3, and fragment 2 is cleaved further to produce fragment 4. To test this hypothesis, the rpsO-pnp transcript was labeled at either its 3′-or5′-end as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the resulting products were used as substrates for RNase IIIS. As shown in Fig. 4, lanes 8–10, treatment of the 3′-end-labeled transcript with increasing amounts of RNase IIIS converted fragment 2 to fragment 4, as predicted. Treatment of the 5′-end-labeled transcript with increasing amounts RNase IIIS led to the initial appearance of fragment 1 followed by the disappearance of label from that migration position (Fig. 4, lanes 11–14). No labeled fragment 3 was observed with 5′-end-labeled transcript as the substrate. We postulate that, following the initial cleavage, fragment 1 is further processed at its 5′-end, resulting in the loss of the 5′-end label as demonstrated in Fig. 4. Additional evidence supporting this conclusion will be presented below. Primer Extension Identifies the RNase IIIS Cleavage Sites in the rpsO-pnp Transcript—In order to identify the RNase III cleavage sites in the rpsO-pnp transcript, we performed primer extension analyses of intact and cleaved transcripts, using primer +16R. Results of this analysis are shown in Fig. 5. The figure shows the DNA sequencing ladder generated by +16R and the extension products derived from transcripts treated with 0–200 ng of RNase IIIS. No extension product corresponding to a cleavage site was observed in the absence of RNase IIIS, as expected, although we did observe a higher molecular weight product, not shown in Fig. 5, that may represent the full-length transcript. Digestion of the rpsO-pnp transcript with RNase IIIS, followed by primer extension revealed two bands. The major band, band 1, identifies a cleavage site at the T residue (a U residue in the transcript) putatively identified as the start site for transcription from Ppnp (see Fig. 3). The intensity of the major band and the fact that it appears at relatively low ratios of RNase IIIS to substrate suggest that this band results from the primary cleavage event in the processing of the rpsO-pnp read-through transcript by RNase IIIS. The minor band shown in Fig. 5, band 2, is of lower intensity, and the amount of that band increases at higher ratios of enzyme to substrate. This band identifies a cleavage site 32 bases 3′ of the primary cleavage site. The secondary structure model for the intergenic stem loop in S. coelicolor is shown in Fig. 6, and the primary and secondary cleavage sites are indicated. It is apparent that the primary cleavage occurs on the 5′-side of the stem-loop in one strand of a symmetric internal loop. The secondary cleavage occurs on the 3′-side of the stem-loop one base downstream of the 3′-end of the internal loop. These results are consistent with a model in which the in"

A CTD-less RNA Pol II is unable to support transcription in yeast extracts, but basal transcription reactions reconstituted from highly purified general transcription factors are CTD-independent. To reconcile these two findings, we have taken a biochemical approach using yeast extracts and asked whether there is a factor in the cell that confers CTD-dependence upon transcription. By placing a cleavage site for the tobacco etch virus protease prior to the CTD, we have created a highly specific method for removing the CTD from RNA Pol II in yeast whole cell extracts. Using derivatives of this strain, we have analyzed the role of the Srb8-11 complex, Mediator, and TFIIH, in CTD-dependent basal transcription by either mutation or immunodepletion of their function. We have found that Mediator is a direct intermediary of CTD-dependent basal transcription in extracts and that the requirement for Mediator and the CTD in basal transcription originates from their ability to compensate for a limiting amount of TFIIH activity in extracts.

II, Rpb1, shares many common features with the catalytic subunits of other eukaryotic and prokaryotic RNA polymerases. A defining feature of the large subunit of RNA Pol II in eukaryotes is a unique C-terminal domain (CTD) that endows the enzyme with many capabilities critical to virtually every aspect of gene expression. The yeast CTD contains 26 repeats of a heptapeptide sequence that is highly conserved in all eukaryotes. The CTD is largely unstructured in the absence of binding partners (1Cramer P. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2001; 292: 1863-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar) and is subject to a cycle of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation by multiple kinases and phosphatases (2Prelich G. Eukaryot. Cell. 2002; 1: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The CTD and its phosphorylation state are critical for the coordination and regulation of transcriptional initiation, elongation and termination, DNA repair, mRNA processing, and mRNA export, through interactions with individual factors directly involved in these processes (3Shilatifard A. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 693-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Complete removal of the CTD from RNA Pol II leads to a lethal phenotype in yeast (4Nonet M. Sweetser D. Young R.A. Cell. 1987; 50: 909-915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), and the truncation of the CTD (to 10–12 repeats) leads to distinct phenotypes, such as cold sensitivity and the inability to grow on a variety of carbon sources (4Nonet M. Sweetser D. Young R.A. Cell. 1987; 50: 909-915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 5Nonet M.L. Young R.A. Genetics. 1989; 123: 715-724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cellular basis for these truncated CTD phenotypes is directly linked to the inability to express certain subsets of genes, which correlates with particular upstream activating sequences in their promoters (6Allison L.A. Ingles J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2794-2798Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 7Scafe C. Chao D. Lopes J. Hirsch J.P. Henry S. Young R.A.

Despite extensive biochemical and genetic analysis of CTD function, there is still much that is not understood about its fundamental role in transcription initiation.Studies in yeast extracts have shown that both activated transcription reactions (9Liao S.-M. Taylor I.C.A. Kingston R.E. Young R.A. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2431-2440Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 10Ranish J.A. Yudkovsky N. Hahn S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 49-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) and basal (in the absence of a site-specific DNA-bound activator) transcription reactions (9Liao S.-M. Taylor I.C.A. Kingston R.E. Young R.A. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2431-2440Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 11Li Y. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2362-2366Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) are highly sensitive to either the truncation or complete removal of the CTD. Transcription systems derived from metazoan cells also exhibit a CTD dependence in vitro, but the observed CTD requirement appears to be promoter-specific (for a review, see Ref. 12Dahmus M.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1261: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and largely dependent on certain sequences in the core promoter (13Buermeyer A.B. Strasheim L.A. McMahon S.L. Farnham P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6798-6807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Truncation or removal of the CTD does not compromise the nonspecific polymerase activity of RNA Pol II (11Li Y. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2362-2366Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 12Dahmus M.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1261: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), indicating that the CTD does not impact the catalytic ability of the polymerase. In both yeast- and metazoa-based transcription systems in vitro, CTD-dependent transcription seems to correlate with the inability of RNA Pol II, with an absent or truncated CTD, to form a stable preinitiation complex (PIC) (10Ranish J.A. Yudkovsky N. Hahn S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 49-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 14Kang M.E. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25033-25040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to reactions using a yeast extract-based system, basal transcription reconstituted from a minimal set of purified yeast general transcription factors is CTD-independent (11Li Y. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2362-2366Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This finding has led to the proposal that the CTD is opposing a negative effector in extracts (11Li Y. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2362-2366Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Unlike basal transcription, activated transcription in vitro is CTD-dependent in assays both in extracts (9Liao S.-M. Taylor I.C.A. Kingston R.E. Young R.A. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2431-2440Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) or reconstituted from the minimal set of purified yeast factors required for activated transcription (15Myers L.C. Gustafsson C.M. Bushnell D.A. Lui M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Kornberg R.D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Both the CTD independence of basal transcription and the CTD dependence of activated transcription in the purified yeast system appear to be linked to the action of the global co-activator complex Mediator.The Mediator complex is a conserved interface between gene-specific regulatory proteins and the general transcription apparatus of eukaryotes at transcription initiation (16Myers L.C. Kornberg R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 729-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 17Lewis B.A. Reinberg D.J.

The roles of Mediator and the CTD in transcription have been shown to be intimately associated, through both genetic and biochemical studies. Selection for genomic suppressor mutations that reverse CTD truncation phenotypes identified the SRB genes (5Nonet M.L. Young R.A. Genetics. 1989; 123: 715-724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Thompson C.M. Koleske A.J. Chao D.M. Young R.A. Cell. 1993; 73: 1361-1375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Mutations in several SRB genes, which encode members of a minimal functional Mediator complex (16Myers L.C. Kornberg R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 729-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), resulted in dominant suppressors of CTD truncation (19Thompson C.M. Koleske A.J. Chao D.M. Young R.A. Cell. 1993; 73: 1361-1375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Loss of function mutations in the genes SRB8, SRB9, SRB10, and SRB11, which encode a subcomplex sometimes found associated with Mediator (20Liao S.M. Zhang J. Jeffery D.A. Koleske A.J. Thompson C.M.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6422-6427Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), resulted in recessive suppressors of CTD truncation. These studies suggested a role for the Srb8-11 complex as a negative effector of transcription (23Hengartner C.J. Thompson C.M. Zhang J. Chao D.M. Liao S.M. Koleske A.J. Okamura S. Young R.A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 897-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 24Carlson M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Srb10 and -11 are a cyclin/kinase pair whose ability to phosphorylate various transcription factor substrates, including TFIIH (25Akoulitchev S. Chuikov S. Reinberg D. Nature. 2000; 407: 102-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) and the CTD (26Hengartner C.J. Myer V.E. Liao S.M. Wilson C.J. Koh S.S. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 43-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), has been suggested to play role in repression. Purified yeast Mediator was shown to associate with RNA Pol II, at least in part, via the CTD (15Myers L.C. Gustafsson C.M. Bushnell D.A. Lui M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Kornberg R.D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 23Hengartner C.J. Thompson C.M. Zhang J. Chao D.M. Liao S.M. Koleske A.J. Okamura S. Young R.A.

Cell. 1994; 77: 599-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). Mediator and the CTD are also mutually required for activated transcription in a purified system (15Myers L.C. Gustafsson C.M. Bushnell D.A. Lui M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Kornberg R.D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Akin to its role in vitro, specific Mediator subunits are required for certain genespecific regulatory factors to activate transcription in vivo (16Myers L.C. Kornberg R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 729-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), and although, like the CTD, Mediator is not required for basal transcription in a purified system, mutations in individual Mediator subunits can lead to defects in the expression of virtually all genes in vivo (28Holstege F.C. Jennings E.G. Wyrick J.J. Lee T.I. Hengartner C.J. Green M.R. Golub T.R. Lander E.S. Young R.A. Cell. 1998; 95: 717-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1591) Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, mutant Mediators in yeast nuclear extracts also lead to defects in basal transcription (10Ranish J.A. Yudkovsky N. Hahn S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 49-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 29Koleske A.J. Buratowski S. Nonet M. Young R.A. Cell. 1992; 69: 883-894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) in vitro. Interestingly, the kinase activity of the general transcription factor TFIIH is also required for transcription in extract-based systems but not in systems reconstituted from purified factors (11Li Y. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2362-2366Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 30Serizawa H. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C.

Biol. 2004; 24: 1721-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). TFIIH, Mediator, and the CTD are functionally associated by virtue of the ability of Mediator to specifically enhance CTD phosphorylation by the TFIIH kinase (15Myers L.C. Gustafsson C.M. Bushnell D.A. Lui M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Kornberg R.D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 27Kim Y.J. Bjorklund S. Li Y. Sayre M.H. Kornberg R.D.

Chem. 2004; 279: 29114-29120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and are thought to be physically associated through an interaction of the Gal11 subunit of Mediator with TFIIH (33Sakurai H. Fukasawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37251-37256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Biochemical (11Li Y. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2362-2366Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and genetic studies (34Gadbois E.L. Chao D.M. Reese J.C. Green M.R. Young R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3145-3150Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) have proposed that a negative effector causes Mediator and the CTD to function as general transcription factors in the cell or in extracts but not in purified systems. Although genetic studies have suggested candidates for this effector, such as the Srb8,9,10,11 complex and NC2 complex (34Gadbois E.L. Chao D.M. Reese J.C. Green M.R. Young R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3145-3150Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), none of these have been biochemically verified as relieving Mediator- or CTD-dependent basal transcription in vitro.Previous studies of CTD-dependent transcription have lacked the methodology to directly and specifically remove the CTD of RNA Pol II in extracts. We have addressed this problem by placing a cleavage site for the tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease (35Parks T.D. Leuther K.K. Howard E.D. Johnston S.A. Dougherty W.G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 216: 413-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) prior to the CTD of Rpb1 in yeast. This strain can be used for the direct removal of the CTD in extracts as well as for the preparation of purified CTD-less RNA Pol II. We have used these reagents to elucidate the molecular requirements for CTD-dependent transcription in extracts. These studies have revealed that deletion of Srb10, a loss of function suppressor of CTD-truncation in vivo, does not relieve CTD-dependent transcription in extracts. We have found, however, that the Mediator complex is a positive acting factor required for CTD-dependent transcription in extracts. Furthermore, we have found that limiting TFIIH activity leads to a requirement for both Mediator and the CTD in basal transcription both in extracts and in a system reconstituted entirely from purified factors.MATERIALS AND METHODSConstruction of Strains—Two sets of primers were designed in order to introduce the TEV protease cleavage site into the RPB1 gene by PCR. A segment of the S. cerevisiae RPB1 gene from the naturally occurring KpnI site to the beginning of the CTD was amplified with 5′-CAATCGGTACCGGTGCATTT-3′ and 5′-CGGACTGCAGTGCTTCACCATAAGCACCAA-3′ to introduce a PstI site into the coding sequence. A PstI site and the coding sequence for the TEV protease cleavage site were introduced 5′ to the coding sequence for the CTD using the primers 5′-GGAACTGCAGGAGAATCTTTATTTTCAGGGCCCTACATCTCCCGGATTTGGA-3′ and 5′-CTTGAAGCTTAGAAGTTGGACGGAC-3′ to amplify the CTD from RPB1. The first PCR product was digested with KpnI and PstI, and the second was digested with PstI and HindIII. A three-part ligation with the cut PCR products and KpnI/HindIII-cut pSPL1 (36Bushnell D.A. Bamdad C. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20170-20174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), which contains the full-length RPB1 gene under the control of its own promoter, yielded full-length RPB1 with the TEV protease site inserted. The EcoRI/HindIII fragment from this plasmid was then ligated into EcoRI/HindIII cut Yplac111 (37Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2506) Google Scholar) to give the pRTV plasmid. A plasmid shuffle was carried out by transforming the strain Z-26 (a ura3–52 leu2–3 leu2–112 his3-Δ300 rpb1-187::HIS3/pRP1121 (URA3 CEN4 RPB1)) with the RPB1-TEV plasmid followed by a 5-fluoroorotic acid selection for the loss of the plasmid bearing wild-type RPB1.To construct the RPB1-TEV-Δsrb10 strain, the kanMX4 cassette was amplified from pRS400 (38Brachmann C.B. Davies A. Cost G.J. Caputo E. Li J. Hieter P. Boeke J.D. Yeast. 1998; 14: 115-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (2572) Google Scholar) using the following primers: 5′-TTTGCTTCCCAATTGAATTAAGGCCGCCTAGTTTTGACGGGAGGAGAGAG-3′ and 5′-CTATCTTCTGTTTTTCTTTCGAGATGGCTCATCTGATGCATTGTTTCCTG-3′. The PCR product was then used to transform the RPB1-TEV strain and selected for G418 resistance. The srb10 deletion was confirmed by PCR. To construct the RPB1-TEV TFB4-FLAG strain, a triple FLAG epitope tag was placed at the C terminus of TFB4 by amplifying the 3′-end of a previously FLAG-tagged copy of TFB4 from the genomic DNA of the SHY365 strain (39Ranish J.A. Hahn S. Lu Y. Yi E.C. Li X.-J. Eng J. Aebersold R. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 707-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) using the following primers: 5′-CAGGGAGAGTTGTTGCCGTT-3′ and 5′-GACGAAGGTTACCTGCTTG-3′. The PCR product was then used to transform the RPB1-TEV strain and selected for G418 resistance. The correct integration of the FLAG tag was confirmed by PCR and also by immunoblotting for FLAG-tagged Tfb4. To construct the RPB1-TEV SRB5-FLAG strain, a triple FLAG epitope tag was placed at the C terminus of SRB5 by amplifying the 3′-end of a previously FLAG-tagged copy of SRB5 from the genomic DNA of the SHY349 strain (40Rani P.G. Ranish J.A. Hahn S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1709-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) using the following primers: 5′-GGAGGGTTCCTTTTAAAAGCA-3′ and 5′-GAAGCAAATTGCCAAACA-3′. The PCR product was then used to transform the RPB1-TEV strain and selected for G418 resistance. The correct integration of the FLAG tag was confirmed by PCR and also by immunoblotting for FLAG-tagged Srb5. Both the SHY349 and the SH-Y365 strains were kindly provided by Steve Hahn.Preparation of Purified CTD-less RNA Pol II Using the RPB1-TEV Strain—RNA Pol II was purified as described (41Myers L.C. Leuther K. Bushnell D.A. Gustafsson C.M. Kornberg R.D. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1997; 12: 212-216Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar) from the RPB1-TEV strain. Tris chloride (pH 7.5) and zinc chloride were replaced by Tris acetate (pH 7.5) and zinc acetate, respectively. An aliquot of the purified polymerase (34.5 μg) was then treated with 1000 units of TEV protease (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocols. The reaction was carried out for 17 h at 4 °C. The digest was further incubated with 8WG16 beads (41Myers L.C. Leuther K. Bushnell D.A. Gustafsson C.M. Kornberg R.D. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1997; 12: 212-216Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar) to deplete the solution of free and uncleaved CTD. The glycerol concentration of the supernatant was readjusted to 10%, the dithiothreitol concentration was readjusted to 2 mm, and the solution was concentrated in a YM-50 centricon (Millipore Corp.).Yeast Extract Preparation—Transcription-competent whole cell extracts (WCE) were prepared from the wild type and modified yeast strains using the method of Kong and Svejstrup (42Kong S.E. Svejstrup J.Q. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2002; 1: 731-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The procedure was modified such that a special protease inhibitor mixture (40 μm pefabloc SC (Roche Applied Science), 2 μm pepstatin A) was used in the final dialysis buffer in order not to interfere with TEV protease cleavage. The whole cell extract was diluted to a concentration of 22 mg/ml, and 1.32 mg of whole cell extract was treated with 100 units of TEV protease (Invitrogen). The reaction was carried out at 4 °C. Aliquots were removed at 0, 3, and 21 h, respectively, and directly used for immunoblots and transcription assays.The RY260 (43Nonet M. Scafe C. Sexton J. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1602-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) strain carrying the rpb1-1 mutation was used to prepare an extract specifically depleted of RNA Pol II activity. Cells were grown at 25 °C to an A600 of 1.5, after which they were rapidly shifted to 37 °C and allowed to grow at 37 °C for another 1.5 h. DE400 extracts were prepared from a whole cell extract by a single-step gradient fractionation of the WCE on DEAE-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) as previously described (44Myers L.C. Lacomis L. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 883-894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).For preparation of extracts from the RPB1-TEV SRB5-FLAG and RPB1-TEV TFB4-FLAG strains, cells were grown at 30 °C to an A600 of 1.5, and a whole cell extract and DE400 extract were prepared as above and with the special protease inhibitor mixture (40 μm pefabloc SC (Roche Applied Science), 2 μm pepstatin A) in the final dialysis buffer.Immunodepletion from Extracts—Anti-FLAG M2-agarose beads (Sigma) were washed in WCE dialysis buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.6), 10 mm MgSO4,1mm EGTA, 20% glycerol, 100 mm (NH4)2SO4, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and special protease inhibitors) and added to DE400 fractions at a ratio of 20 μl of beads to 80 μl of FLAG-tagged DE400 fraction adjusted to 100 mm (NH4)2SO4. After incubation for 2 h with gentle inversion at 4 °C, beads were removed by microcentrifugation, and an amount of beads equal to that used initially was added to the supernatant. The extracts were incubated for an additional2hat4°C. Beads were removed by centrifugation, and the doubly depleted DE400 fraction was used in immunoblots and transcription assays. Undepleted control DE400 fractions were made by following the same procedure as above but using unmodified agarose beads.Immunoblot Analyses—Immunoblot analyses with the α-CTD (8WG16), α-Rpb3 α-Med7, α-Tfb1, and α-Rgr1 antibodies were performed as previously described (15Myers L.C. Gustafsson C.M. Bushnell D.A. Lui M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Kornberg R.D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 27Kim Y.J. Bjorklund S. Li Y. Sayre M.H.

The α-Kar3 antibodies were a gift from Charles Barlowe (Dartmouth Medical School).Transcription Assays—Basal transcription reconstituted from purified yeast general transcription factors (41Myers L.C. Leuther K. Bushnell D.A. Gustafsson C.M. Kornberg R.D. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1997; 12: 212-216Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar) was measured using the G-less cassette assay as previously described (15Myers L.C. Gustafsson C.M. Bushnell D.A. Lui M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Kornberg R.D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The final salt concentration in the reaction buffer was 150 mm KOAc, and the reactions were preincubated for 10 min in the absence of nucleotides followed by a 10-min reaction time after the addition of the nucleotides. The general transcription factors used for all reactions in this study came from identical aliquots of a single preparation. The basal transcription reactions based on the transcription-competent whole cell extract or the DE400 extract were performed as previously described (44Myers L.C. Lacomis L. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 883-894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The final salt concentration in the reaction buffer was 100 mm KOAc, and the reactions were preincubated for 10 min in the absence of nucleotides followed by a 10-min reaction time after the addition of the nucleotides. Purified wild type or CTD-less RNA Pol II was added to the DE400-based reactions in amounts normalized for their nonspecific activity. RNA Pol II nonspecific initiation/chain elongation assays were performed as described (11Li Y. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2362-2366Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). When the nonspecific assay was performed in extracts, the contribution of RNA Pol II to the total polymerase activity was determined by subtracting the signal in the presence of 5.5 mm α-amanatin from the signal in the absence of α-amanatin.RESULTSA TEV Protease Site in Rpb1 Allows for the Specific Removal of the CTD from RNA Pol II in Its Purified Form and in Extracts—To create a RNA Pol II with a CTD that could be readily removed by a site-specific protease, the seven-amino acid TEV protease consensus cutting sequence was inserted into the coding sequence of the gene RPB1 by replacing 10 amino acids just prior to the CTD (Fig. 1A). The plasmid coding for the modified RPB1 (pRTV) was exchanged into a yeast strain by plasmid shuffle, such that the growth of the new strain (RPB1-TEV) was dependent on the RPB1-TEV gene. The growth characteristics of the modified strain were essentially identical to the parental strain supported by wild type RPB1. To test the ability of the TEV protease to cleave the CTD, we purified RNA Pol II from the RPB1-TEV strain using standard purification protocols (41Myers L.C. Leuther K. Bushnell D.A. Gustafsson C.M. Kornberg R.D. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1997; 12: 212-216Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The purified RNA Pol II was subjected to cleavage with TEV protease, and the results were monitored by SDS-PAGE using silver staining. Prior to all subsequent assays, we incubated the CTD-less RNA Pol II from the cleavage reaction with 8WG16 (α-CTD) beads to ensure that free CTD and remaining CTD-bearing RNA Pol II were cleared from the sample. The mobility shift in the Rpb1 subunit caused by the TEV protease treatment corresponded to the change in molecular mass (∼21 kDa) expected for loss of the CTD (Fig. 1B). At this point, the TEV protease itself could be removed by size exclusion or by virtue of a His6 tag on its N terminus in conjunction with Ni2+-agarose. We found, however, that the TEV protease did not interfere with any subsequent assays of the CTD-less RNA Pol II. Basal transcription assays in a purified transcription system (Fig. 1C) confirmed that the CTD-less RNA Pol II generated from the RPB1-TEV strain had activity equivalent to that of wild type RNA Pol II when normalized for nonspecific polymerase activity.To confirm that the TEV protease could cleave the CTD from RNA Pol II in a crude yeast extract, we prepared transcription-competent whole cell extracts from the RPB1-TEV strain as described (42Kong S.E. Svejstrup J.Q. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2002; 1: 731-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). TEV protease was added to one reaction, whereas a second identical control reaction was incubated in parallel in the absence of the protease. Cleavage of the CTD was followed by immunoblotting using the 8WG16 (α-CTD) antibody and monitoring the band at ∼200 kDa. Over time, the intensity of the Rpb1 band in the control reaction remained constant, whereas the Rpb1 band in the TEV protease reaction decreased, markedly reflecting CTD cleavage (Fig. 2). Other antibodies directed against a RNA Pol II subunit (Rpb3), a Mediator subunit (Med7), and a nontranscription protein (Kar3) were used as loading controls and did not vary during the course of the digest. The detached CTD peptide appeared to be degraded, since we were unable to detect a new ba"

https://openalex.org/W1995790060,"Selective and regulatable expansion of transduced cells could augment gene therapy for many disorders. The activation of modified growth factor receptors via synthetic chemical inducers of dimerization allows for the coordinated growth of transduced cells. This system can also provide information on specific receptor-mediated signaling without interference from other family members. Although several receptor subunits have been investigated in this context, little is known about the precise molecular events associated with dimerizer-initiated signaling. We have constructed and expressed an AP20187-regulated KDR chimeric receptor in human TF1 cells and analyzed activation of this gene switch using functional, biochemical, and microarray analyses. When deprived of natural ligands, GM-CSF, interleukin-3, or erythropoietin, AP20187 prevented apoptosis of transduced TF1 cells, induced dose-dependent proliferation, and supported long-term growth. In addition, AP20187 stimulation activated the signaling molecules associated with mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphatidyl-inositol 3-kinase/Akt pathways. Microarray analysis determined that a number of transcripts involved in a variety of cellular processes were differentially expressed. Notably, mRNAs affiliated with heat stress, including Hsp70 and Hsp105, were up-regulated. Functional assays showed that Hsp70 and Hsp105 protected transduced TF1 cells from apoptosis and premature senescence, in part through regulation of Akt. These observations delineate specific roles for kinase insert domain-containing receptor, or KDR, signaling and suggest strategies to endow genetically modified cells with a survival advantage enabling the generation of adequate cell numbers for therapeutic outcomes."
