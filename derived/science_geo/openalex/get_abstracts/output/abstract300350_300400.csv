https://openalex.org/W2042884233,"Analysis of the freeze-drying procedure shows that the passage of water vapor from the drying boundary through the dried shell is facilitated primarily by the vapor pressure gradient rather than by the absolute pressure of the system. This is experimentally confirmed, and a device for freeze-drying at atmospheric pressure is described."

https://openalex.org/W1984314085,"Many migratory water birds killed in Texas and Oklahoma contained viable fresh-water algae in the lower digestive tracts. Such birds are thought to play a significant role in the long-range dispersal of certain algae, particularly those species easily killed by desiccation."

https://openalex.org/W2149021981,"There is ample justification for concern about adequate food supplies for future generations of mankind, but this concern should be broadened to include the immediate problem of an adequate standard of living for the world's present population. The successful solution of the immediate problems would furnish the best background of experience for meeting those that will arise in the future. First steps include the acceptance by society of responsibilities for the extension of the benefits of education throughout the world and provision for the type of scientific, economic, social, political, and religious leadership necessary to assure food for all on a continuing basis. Striking improvements in the food supply can be readily made through the application of present knowledge, if the foregoing conditions are met. The rapid pace of modern science, both pure and applied, gives promise that future benefits may be much greater than those thus far experienced. Current advances do not signal the end of a technical road but rather that the great scientific developments still lie ahead. If we have the intelligence and wisdom to recognize human responsibilities and to make constructive use of our natural and human resources, we can look forward to a better world in the future and improved standards of living for all."

https://openalex.org/W2107357707,The Western type of equine encephalomyelitis virus has been isolated from chicken mites (Dermanyssus gallinae) in nature during an outbreak of the equine disease in the Southwest.

https://openalex.org/W2084532205,"Subtilisin, as well as trypsin and chymotrypsin, splits myosin into meromyosin-like components. Examination of the N- and C-terminal residues of the L-meromyosin-like products suggests that all three proteases produce identical L-meromyosins. It is proposed that the role of the enzymes is to break secondary bonds."

https://openalex.org/W2044988202,"The proposed sterility test for penicillin, which employs cysteine (in the form of its hydrochloride) rather than Clarase, has proven to be satisfactory in our laboratories. The use of cysteine is advantageous because it is a compound of known structure and is readily available at relatively small cost. Suitable samples of Clarase or bacterial penicillinases are not as reproducible and the latter require much time and effort in their preparation. Furthermore, cysteine solutions do not require filtration but may be sterilized by heat in the autoclave."
