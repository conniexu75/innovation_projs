https://openalex.org/W2093377166,"The complete sequence of the human Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) cDNA has been determined. The 3685 encoded amino acids of the protein product, dystrophin, can be separated into four domains. The 240 amino acid N-terminal domain has been shown to be conserved with the actin-binding domain of alpha-actinin. A large second domain is predicted to be rod-shaped and formed by the succession of 25 triple-helical segments similar to the repeat domains of spectrin. The repeat segment is followed by a cysteine-rich segment that is similar in part to the entire COOH domain of the Dictyostelium alpha-actinin, while the 420 amino acid C-terminal domain of dystrophin does not show any similarity to previously reported proteins. The functional significance of some of the domains is addressed relative to the phenotypic characteristics of some Becker muscular dystrophy patients. Dystrophin shares many features with the cytoskeletal protein spectrin and alpha-actinin and is a large structural protein that is likely to adopt a rod shape about 150 nm in length."

https://openalex.org/W2084918744,"Insulin appears in the developing mouse pancreas at embryonic day 12 (e12). Transgenic mice harboring three distinct hybrid genes utilizing insulin gene regulatory information first express the transgene product two days earlier, at e10, in a few cells of the pancreatic bud. Throughout development and postnatal life, all of the insulin-producing (beta) cells coexpress the hybrid insulin gene. In addition, islet cells containing glucagon, somatostatin, pancreatic polypeptide, and the neuronal enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase coexpress the transgene when they first arise. Similarly, coexpression of these normally distinct islet cell markers occurs during differentiation of the four endocrine cell types. The transgene product also appears transiently during embryogenesis in cells of the neural tube and in neural crest. The results suggest a common precursor for the endocrine cells of the pancreas. Moreover, they imply a relationship between neural and pancreatic endocrine tissue."

https://openalex.org/W2093008678,"Malaria vaccines are being developed against different stages in the parasite's life cycle1, each increasing the opportunity to control malaria in its diverse settings. Sporozoite vaccines are designed to prevent mosquito-induced infection2; first generation recombinant or synthetic peptide vaccines have been tested in humans3,4. Asexual erythrocytic stage vaccines, developed to prevent or reduce the severity of disease, have been tested in animals1,5 and in humans6. A third strategy is to produce sexual stage vaccines that would induce antibodies which would prevent infection of mosquitoes when ingested in a bloodmeal containing sexual stage parasites1. Although not directly protective, the sexual stage vaccine combined with a sporozoite or asexual stage vaccine (protective component) could prolong the useful life of the protective component by reducing transmission of resistant vaccine-induced mutants. In areas of low endemnicity, the sexual stage vaccine could reduce transmission below the critical threshold required to maintain the infected population, thereby assisting in the control or eradication of malaria. Transmission of Plasmodium falciparum, the major human malaria, can be blocked by monoclonal antibodies against three sexual stage-specific antigens7–9. We have cloned the gene encoding the surface protein of relative molecular mass Mr 25,000 (25K; Pfs25), expressed on zygotes and ookinetes of P. falciparum. The deduced amino-acid sequence consists of a signal sequence, a hydrophobic C-terminus, and four tandem epidermal growth factor EGF-like domains10–12."
https://openalex.org/W2058455674,"When beta-lactamase was fused with the signal peptide plus the amino-terminal 9 amino acid residues of the major outer membrane lipoprotein, the resultant lipo-beta-lactamase (LL-1) was shown to be localized to the outer membrane. However, when the 9 residue sequence was replaced with the amino-terminal 12 residue sequence of lipoprotein-28, an inner membrane protein, the resultant lipo-beta-lactamase (LL-2) was found exclusively in the inner membrane. The localization of LL-2 was shifted to the outer membrane simply by substituting the second amino acid residue (Asp) of LL-2 with Ser. Conversely, the alteration of the second residue (Ser) of LL-1 to Asp resulted in the localization of LL-1 to the inner membrane. These results suggest that the second amino acid residue of the lipoproteins plays a crucial role in determining their final locations in the E. coli envelope."

https://openalex.org/W1555540695,"A previous 13C NMR technique (Malloy, C. R., Sherry, A.D., and Jeffrey, F.M.H. (1987) FEBS Lett. 212, 58-62) for measuring the relative flux of molecules through the oxidative versus anaplerotic pathways involving the citric acid cycle of the rat heart has been extended to include a complete analysis of the entire glutamate 13C spectrum. Although still simple in practice, this more sophisticated model allows an evaluation of 13C fractional enrichment of molecules entering both the oxidative and anaplerotic pathways under steady-state conditions. The method was used to analyze 13C NMR spectra of intact hearts or their acid extracts during utilization of 13C-enriched pyruvate, propionate, acetate, or various combinations thereof. [2-13C]Pyruvate was used to prove that steady-state flux of pyruvate through pyruvate carboxylase is significant during co-perfusion of pyruvate and acetate, and we demonstrate for the first time that a nine-line 13C multiplet may be detected in an intact, beating heart. Acetate or pyruvate alone provided about 86% of the acetyl-CoA; in combination, about 65% of the acetyl-CoA was derived from acetate, about 30% was derived from pyruvate, and the remainder from endogenous sources. Propionate reduced the contribution of exogenous acetate to acetyl-CoA to 77% and also reduced the oxidation of endogenous substrates. Equations are presented which allow this same analysis on multiply labeled substrates, making this technique extremely powerful for the evaluation of substrate selection and relative metabolic flux through anaplerotic and oxidative pathways in the intact heart."
https://openalex.org/W1564406238,"Previous work from this laboratory has shown that a derivative of mevalonic acid is post-translationally incorporated into a number of specific proteins in Swiss 3T3 cells. Neither the nature of the modification nor the identities of the modified proteins have been determined to date. Here we describe results concerning modified proteins of approximately 67 kDa from HeLa cells and Chinese hamster ovary cells. We show that these proteins are specific to the nucleus and remain associated with a Triton/salt-insoluble nuclear fraction. Furthermore, immunological studies demonstrate that one of the modified proteins comigrates on two-dimensional gels with lamin B, a structural protein associated with the nuclear envelope. Using antibodies directed against lamin B in an immunoprecipitation experiment, we further show that this mevalonic acid-modified protein specifically coprecipitates with lamin B. These results support the hypothesis that lamin B is modified by a derivative of mevalonic acid."

The use of specific blocking agents shows, however, that alkaline phosphatase release and dimyristoylglycerol production are independent processes and that the blockade of either event inhibits the production of insulin mediator. These experiments suggest a new model of insulin action."
https://openalex.org/W2090081894,"Autonomously replicating sequences (ARSs) of the yeast S. cerevisiae function as replication origins on plasmids and probably also on chromosomes. ARS function requires a copy of the ARS core consensus (5′-[A/T]TTTAT[A/G]TTT[A/T]-3′) and additional sequences 3′ to the T-rich strand of the consensus. Our analysis of an ARS from chromosome III, the C2G1 ARS, suggests that ARS function depends on the presence of an exact match to the core consensus and the presence of additional near matches in the 3′ flanking region. We have demonstrated that ARS function can be mediated by multiple matches to the core consensus by constructing synthetic ARS elements from oligonucleotides containing copies of the consensus sequence. We find that two copies of the core consensus are sufficient for ARS activity and that an artificial ARS as efficient as a natural chromosomal ARS can be constructed from multiple core consensus elements in a specific orientation."
https://openalex.org/W1519774345,"Pol III, a subassembly of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase III holoenzyme lacking only the auxiliary beta subunit, was purified to homogeneity by an improved procedure. This assembly consists of nine different polypeptides, likely in a 1:1 stoichiometry: a catalytic core (pol III) of alpha (132 kDa), epsilon (27 kDa), and theta (10 kDa), and six auxiliary subunits: tau (71 kDa), gamma (52 kDa), delta (35 kDa), delta' (33 kDa), chi (15 kDa), and psi (12 kDa). The assembly behaves on gel filtration as a particle of about 800 kDa, indicating a content of two each of the subunits. A new procedure for purifying the core yielded a novel dimeric form which may provide the foundation for the dimeric nature of the more complex pol III and holoenzyme forms. Pol III readily dissociates into several subassemblies including pol III', likely a dimeric core with two tau subunits. The holoenzyme, purified by a similar procedure with ATP and Mg2+ present throughout, retained the beta subunit (37 kDa) as well as all the subunits present in pol III; the mass of the holoenzyme was estimated to be 900 kDa. The isolated initiation complex of holoenzyme with a primed template DNA and the elongation complex (formed in the presence of three deoxynucleoside triphosphates) had the same composition and stoichiometry as observed for pol III with two beta dimers in addition. An initiation complex assembled from a mixture of monomeric pol III core, gamma 2 delta delta' chi psi complex (gamma complex), beta, and tau retained the core, one beta dimer, and two tau subunits but was deficient in the gamma complex. When tau was omitted from the assembly mixture, the initiation complex contained one or two gamma complexes instead of the tau subunit. Based on these data, pol III holoenzyme is judged to be an asymmetric dimeric particle with twin pol III core active sites and two different sets of auxiliary units designed to achieve essentially concurrent replication of both leading and lagging strand templates."
https://openalex.org/W2159427833,"The capsulation locus cap in H. influenzae type b contains directly repeated segments of DNA flanking a bridge region. Here we show that this bridge region contains a gene, bexA, encoding a 24.7 kd protein essential for export of capsular polysaccharide. bexA is disrupted, with loss of part of its coding sequence, in the spontaneous reduction of the duplicated cap locus to single-copy that accompanies loss of capsule expression. The predicted amino acid sequence of BexA aligns significantly with that of MalK from E. coli and with HisP and OppD of S. typhimurium. Thus, polysaccharide export might occur via an energy-dependent transporter with similarities to those identified for the import of various substrates into Gramnegative bacteria, BexA being the “energizer” of the transporter."
https://openalex.org/W1677389743,"We have studied in vitro transcription of the human epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor proto-oncogene using nuclear extracts of A431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells, which overproduce the EGF receptor. With the in vitro system we found that Sp1 and other trans-acting factors bound to the EGF receptor promoter regions and are required for maximal expression. Fractionation showed that a DEAE-Sepharose fraction (BA) contained a novel factor, which specifically stimulated EGF receptor transcription 5- to 10-fold. The molecular mass of the native form of the factor is about 270-kDa based on its migration on Sephacryl S-300. This factor may activate transcription of the proto-oncogene through a weak or indirect interaction with the DNA template."

https://openalex.org/W1553177492,"Escherichia coli endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide) was shown to increase glycogenolysis in the perfused liver 2-3-fold. In isolated parenchymal liver cells, however, endotoxin did not influence glycogenolysis, whereas stimulation by endotoxin of glycogenolysis in the perfused liver could be blocked by aspirin. This suggests that the effect of endotoxin on liver glycogenolysis is mediated by eicosanoids. The amount of prostaglandin D2 (which is the major prostanoid formed by Kupffer cells) in the liver perfusates was increased 5-fold upon endotoxin addition, with a time course which preceded the increase in glucose output. It is concluded that endotoxin stimulates glycogenolysis in the liver by stimulating prostaglandin D2 release from Kupffer cells, with a subsequent activation of glycogenolysis in parenchymal liver cells. This mechanism of intercellular communication may be designed to provide the carbohydrate source of energy necessary for the effective destruction of invaded microorganisms, by phagocytic cells, including the Kupffer cells."
https://openalex.org/W1579564253,"Processive DNA synthesis, a property of DNA polymerase III holoenzyme of Escherichia coli, was not achieved by combining the pol III core (alpha, epsilon, and theta subunits) and the beta and gamma subunits. An activity that restored processivity to these subunits was found in crude extracts and was overproduced 4-fold in cells with plasmids amplifying the tau and gamma subunits. Purified to homogeneity, the activity, assayed by reconstitution of processivity, was represented by five polypeptides which were copurified. Judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, these correspond to the known subunits gamma (52 kDa) and delta (35 kDa) and to three new polypeptides: delta' (33 kDa), chi (15 kDa), and psi (12 kDa). The five polypeptides form a tight complex with a native molecular weight of about 200 kDa and a subunit stoichiometry of two gamma subunits to one each of the others. Processive DNA synthesis, now achieved with only three components (pol III core, beta, and the auxiliary complex), provides the opportunity to assess the functions of each and the contribution that the remaining auxiliary tau subunit makes to reconstitute a holoenzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1503815289,"The effects of pertussis toxin (PT) treatment on insulin-stimulated myristoyl-diacylglycerol (DAG) generation, hexose transport, and thymidine incorporation were studied in differentiated BC3H-1 myocytes. Insulin treatment caused a biphasic increase in myristoyl-DAG production which was abolished in myocytes treated with PT. There was no effect of PT treatment on basal (nonstimulated) myristoyl-DAG production. Insulin-stimulated hydrolysis of a membrane phosphatidylinositol glycan was blocked by PT treatment. ADP-ribosylation of BC3H-1 plasma membranes with [32P]NAD revealed a 40-kDa protein as the major PT substrate in vivo and in vitro. The time course and dose dependence of the effects of PT on diacylglycerol generation correlated with the in vivo ADP-ribosylation of the 40-kDa substrate. Pertussis toxin treatment resulted in a 71% attenuation of insulin-stimulated hexose uptake without effect on either basal or phorbol ester-stimulated uptake. The stimulatory effects of insulin and fetal calf serum on [3H]thymidine incorporation into quiescent myocytes were attenuated by 61 and 59%, respectively, when PT was added coincidently with the growth factors. Nonstimulated and EGF-stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation was unaffected by PT treatment. These data suggest that a PT-sensitive G protein is involved in the cellular signaling mechanisms of insulin."
https://openalex.org/W1582244872,"The 10 distinctive polypeptides of DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, purified as individual subunits or complexes, could be reconstituted to generate a polymerase with the high catalytic rate of the isolated intact holoenzyme. Functions and interactions of the subunits can be inferred from partial assemblies of the pol III core (alpha, epsilon, and theta subunits) with auxiliary subunits. The core possesses the polymerase and proofreading activities; the auxiliary subunits provide the core with processivity, the capacity to replicate long stretches of DNA without dissociating from the template. In a sequence of reconstruction steps, the beta subunit binds the primed template in an ATP-dependent manner through the catalytic action of a complex made up of the gamma, delta, delta', chi, and psi polypeptides. With the beta subunit in place, a processive polymerase is produced upon addition of the core. When the tau subunit is lacking, binding of polymerase to the primed template is less efficient and stable. The tau-less reconstituted polymerase is more prone to dissociation upon encountering secondary structures in the template in its path, such as a hairpin region in the single strand or a duplex region formed by a strand annealed to the template. With the tau subunit present, the interaction of the core.beta complex (the basic unit of a processive polymerase) with the primed template is strengthened. The tau-containing reconstituted polymerase can replicate DNA continuously through secondary structures in the template. The two distinctive kinds of processivity demonstrated by the tau-less and tau-containing reconstituted polymerases fit nicely into a scheme in which, organized as an asymmetric dimeric holoenzyme, the tau half is responsible for continuous synthesis of one strand, and the less stable half for discontinuous synthesis of the other."
https://openalex.org/W1589725141,"MAT alpha Saccharomyces cerevisiae secrete a small peptide mating pheromone termed alpha-factor. Its precursor, prepro-alpha-factor, is translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum and glycosylated at three sites. The glycosylated form is the major product in a yeast in vitro translation/translocation system. However, there is another translocated, nonglycosylated product that contains a previously unidentified modification. Contrary to previous results suggesting that the signal sequence of prepro-alpha-factor is not cleaved, amino-terminal radiosequencing has identified this product as prepro-alpha-factor without its signal sequence, that is, pro-alpha-factor. The translocated, glycosylated proteins are also processed by signal peptidase. Moreover, we have found that both purified eukaryotic and prokaryotic signal peptidase can process prepro-alpha-factor. Experiments using a yeast secretory mutant (sec 18) blocked in transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi indicate that the protein is also cleaved in vivo. Finally, characterization of the Asn-linked oligosaccharide present on pro-alpha-factor in the yeast in vitro system by use of specific glucosidase and mannosidase inhibitors indicates that they have had the three terminal glucoses and probably one mannose removed. Therefore they most likely consist of Man8GlcNAc2 structures, identical to those found in the endoplasmic reticulum in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1523022702,"External invertase is the product of the SUC2 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The deduced sequence of this enzyme (Taussig, R., and Carlson, M. (1983) Nucleic Acid Res. 11, 1943-1954) reveals it to contain 14 potential N-linked glycosylation sites, or sequons, although only 9-10 appear to be glycosylated (Trimble, R. B., and Maley, F. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 4409-4412). To determine the location of the glycosylated sequons, external invertase was deglycosylated with endo-beta-acetylglucosaminidase H and its component peptides analyzed by both fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry (FABMS) and classical peptide isolation procedures. By use of the former technique most of the glucosamine-containing sequons could be located and by the latter sufficient amounts of small glucosamine-containing peptides were isolated to enable their quantitation. From the combined FABMS and glucosamine analyses, it was established that eight of the sequons in a subunit of invertase are either completely or almost completely glycosylated, while five others are glycosylated to the extent of about 50% or less. In the case of two overlapping sequons (4 and 5), which include Asn92-Asn93-Thr-Ser, only the first Asn was glycosylated. Thus, all but one of the sequons of external invertase are glycosylated to some extent, giving an appearance of only 9-10 N-linked oligosaccharides/subunit. The sequence identity of both external and internal invertase was verified by FABMS and by peptide sequence analysis. In only one site was an amino acid found to differ from that deduced from the DNA sequence of the SUC2 gene. This occurred at position 390 where a proline was found in place of alanine, which could result from a single base change in the triplet specifying the latter amino acid."
https://openalex.org/W1488062553,"Rats were injected with [125I]iodoinsulin labeled at either the A14 or B26 tyrosine, and the animals were killed and livers subcellularly fractionated to yield light (early or neutral) endosomes and heavy (late or acidic) endosomes. 125I-Labeled material was extracted from endosomes and analyzed by Sephadex G-50 filtration and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Radiolabeled material in both types of endosomes is comprised of high molecular weight, insulin-sized, and low molecular weight components, with B chain-labeled small molecular weight material in two peaks, one corresponding to iodotyrosine and one to small peptides (Mr less than 1500). As compared with A chain label, however, less of the B chain material appears in the degradation components (both high and low molecular weight fractions) suggesting that a fragment of B chain containing the B26 residue is lost from the endosomes. Analysis on HPLC shows that significant amounts of the insulin-sized and high molecular weight material have proteolytic cleavage(s) in the B chain with an intact A chain. The B chain-derived labeled peptides elute from HPLC identically with products generated by insulin protease. These results therefore show substantial insulin degradation occurring in light endosomes prior to endosomal acidification and to receptor dissociation, suggesting receptor-bound insulin is a substrate for insulin protease."
https://openalex.org/W1545562888,"Cu-metallothionein was purified from Saccharomyces cerevisiae harboring plasmids containing mutated CUP1 metallothionein genes resulting in deletions at the carboxy-terminal end of the polypeptide. The truncated polypeptides are recovered as polypeptides of 35 and 48 residues in length. The Cu-S cluster in the wild-type metallothionein and the two truncates were characterized. The truncated proteins, designated T35 and T48, contain 4 and 2 fewer cysteinyl residues, respectively, compared to the 12 cysteines in wild-type metallothionein; yet the mutant molecules bind Cu(I) ions in a stoichiometry comparable to the wild-type protein, i.e. 7-8 mol eq. The Cu(I) ions bound to T48 are as tenaciously bound as those bound to the wild-type molecule. The electronic transitions in the ultraviolet are similar for Cu-T48 and the wild-type protein. Both mutants and wild-type Cu-protein exhibit luminescence. The corrected emission maxima occurs at 609 nm with a corrected excitation peak near 277 nm. The luminescence quantum yield and lifetime of fluorescence decay of Cu-T48 and wild-type Cu-metallothionein are similar. The absolute quantum yield of the wild-type Cu-protein luminescence is 0.0058 and has a 440-ns lifetime. The similar fluorescence rate constant in the two molecules suggests they possess a similar chromophore. The Cu-T35 protein is more labile than Cu-T48 or the wild-type protein in the association of Cu(I) ions and the air sensitivity of the electronic transitions and luminescence. Although T48 lacks 2 of the 12 cysteines in the wild-type protein, we are unable to detect any differences in the properties of the native metal clusters in the two molecules; T35 lacking 4 cysteinyl residues forms a Cu(I) cluster with properties significantly different from the wild-type molecule. Properties of the Cu-thiolate cluster were also studied in Cu(I)-reconstituted samples. The cluster in wild-type metallothionein forms in all-or-nothing fashion. This conclusion is based on copper binding stoichiometry and luminescence studies. The relative quantum yield of samples with intermediate Cu(I) levels was constant, consistent with all-or-none cluster formation."
https://openalex.org/W2042398627,"These studies were set up to determine whether those oncogenes participating in the initiation of mammary carcinogenesis (for example, ras oncogenes) play a direct role in the outcome of events associated with the late stages of tumor development such as loss of hormone dependency. Mammary carcinomas induced by a single carcinogenic insult in pubescent rats was selected as an in vivo model system with direct relevance to human breast cancer. Acquisition of hormone-independent growth in these carcinogen-induced tumors was found to be independent of the activation of ras oncogenes during the early stages of carcinogenesis. In agreement with these observations, introduction of a human ras oncogene into human MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells did not abrogate their hormonal dependency for growth in vivo. These findings suggest that those events responsible for the critical stages of breast cancer development occur independently and in an uncoordinated manner."
https://openalex.org/W1598075072,"The importance of carboxyl groups near the active site zinc for the catalytic function of alcohol dehydrogenase I from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was examined by directed mutagenesis and steady state kinetics. Asp-49 was changed to asparagine and Glu-68 to glutamine (residue numbering as for horse liver enzyme). The catalytic efficiencies (V/Km) for ethanol oxidation and acetaldehyde reduction were decreased by factors of 1000 with the Asn-49 mutant and 100 with the Gln-68 enzyme. For the Asn-49 mutant, dissociation constants for coenzymes increased 7-fold, and Michaelis and inhibition constants for substrates and substrate analogs increased by factors of 20-50. The turnover numbers were reduced 50-fold for ethanol oxidation and 15-fold for acetaldehyde reduction. Product and dead-end inhibition studies and kinetic isotope effects showed that the mechanism with NAD+ and ethanol was rapid equilibrium random, in contrast to the ordered mechanism of wild-type enzyme. Alcohol dehydrogenase I and the Asn-49 mutant had similar CD spectra and 2 zinc atoms/subunit, but slightly different UV absorption and fluorescence spectra. The Gln-68 mutant resembled the wild-type enzyme in most kinetic constants, but the turnover number for ethanol oxidation decreased 35-fold, and Kd for NAD+ and Km for acetaldehyde increased by factors of 4 and 50, respectively. The pK values for V1 and V1/Km for ethanol oxidation were shifted from 7.7 (wild-type) to 6.8 in the Gln-68 and 6.2 in the Asn-49 mutant. The altered electrostatic environment near the active site zinc apparently decreases activities by hindering isomerizations of enzyme-substrate complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1595163219,"To evaluate anion exchange as the mechanistic basis of sugar phosphate transport, natural and artificial membranes were used in studies of glucose 6-phosphate (Glc-6-P) and inorganic phosphate (Pi) accumulation by the uhpT-encoded protein (UhpT) of Escherichia coli. Experiments with intact cells demonstrated that UhpT catalyzed the neutral exchange of internal and external Pi, and work with everted as well as right-side-out membrane vesicles showed further that UhpT mediated the heterologous exchange of Pi and Glc-6-P. When loaded with Pi, but not when loaded with morpholinopropanesulfonate (MOPS), everted vesicles took up Glc-6-P to levels 100-fold above medium concentration in a reaction unaffected by the ionophores valinomycin, valinomycin plus nigericin, and carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone. Similarly, right-side-out vesicles were capable of Glc-6-P transport, but only if a suitable internal countersubstrate was available. Thus, in MOPS-loaded vesicles, oxidative metabolism established a proton-motive force that supported proline or Pi accumulation, but transport of Glc-6-P was found only if vesicles could accumulate Pi during a preincubation. After reconstitution of UhpT into proteoliposomes it was possible to show as well that the level of accumulation of Glc-6-P (17 to 560 nmol/mg of protein) was related directly to the internal concentration of Pi. These results are most easily understood if the transport of glucose 6-phosphate in E. coli occurs by anion exchange rather than by nH+/anion support."
https://openalex.org/W1567867640,"Angiotensin II (AII) interacts with specific receptors in the adrenal glomerulosa cell and stimulates the hydrolysis of plasma membrane phosphoinositides by phospholipase C, with production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins-1,4,5-P3) and subsequent mobilization of intracellular Ca2+. In electrically permeabilized, [3H]inositol-labeled glomerulosa cells, AII stimulated Ins-1,4,5-P3 production within 15 s with half-maximal potency of 10(-9) M. The nonhydrolyzable GTP analog, guanosine 5'-O-thiotriphosphate (GTP gamma S), stimulated Ins-1,4,5-P3 formation in a dose-dependent manner with half-maximal effect at 10(-7) M. AII-activated Ins-1,4,5-P3 production was further increased by guanine nucleotides. The rate at which GTP gamma S-stimulated inositol polyphosphate production was consistently slower than that of AII. In adrenal membrane preparations, GTP gamma S-stimulated polyphosphoinositide hydrolysis was enhanced by Ca2+, with half-maximal activity at 300 nM free Ca2+. Ins-1,4,5-P3 formation was also increased by NaF, further indicating the involvement of a guanine nucleotide regulatory protein. In addition to Ins-1,4,5-P3 and its metabolites formed during degradation via the 4-monophosphate pathway, AII and GTP gamma S stimulated the formation of the phosphorylated metabolite inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate and inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate in permeabilized cells. The absence of a significant rise in inositol 1-monophosphate indicated that phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis was not stimulated by AII or GTP gamma S. Pretreatment of glomerulosa cells with pertussis toxin for 12 h before permeabilization did not inhibit AII- or GTP gamma S-stimulated inositol polyphosphate formation. However, treatment with cholera toxin, forskolin, or 8-Br-cAMP for 12 h enhanced both basal and ligand-stimulated Ins-1,4,5-P3 production. These observations suggest that agonist binding to the AII receptor activates a polyphosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C in the adrenal glomerulosa cell, and that a distinctive guanine regulatory protein is involved in this mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1532366340,"By using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting, we have analyzed the expression of beta-tubulin isotypes in the higher plant, carrot. We report a complex expression of beta-tubulins that is dependent on the developmental stage of the tissues analyzed. Consequently, each tissue examined can be identified by its unique composition of beta-tubulins. In total, there are six electrophoretically separable beta-tubulins. In no tissue, however, is there less than two or more than five beta-tubulins. Within this framework we have detected a beta-tubulin specific to seedling tissue beta 6, and a beta-tubulin, beta 5, that is found only in the vegetative tissues of the mature plant. Traced from stem to midrib to leaf lamina, the beta 5 isotype becomes progressively dominant relative to beta 1. Another beta-tubulin isotype, beta 4, appears in marked abundance in immature and mature stamens. In isolated mature pollen the beta 4-tubulin overwhelmingly predominates the ubiquitously expressed beta 2-tubulin isotype. The remaining beta-tubulin isotypes also have specific expression programs with beta 1 present in all tissues except pollen and beta 3 absent only from pollen and leafy tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1604134420,"Site-directed antipeptide antibodies generated against the predicted cytoplasmic sequences of rhodopsin were used to map the binding domains for transducin, the retinal G-protein, on the photoreceptor. Antibodies against synthetic peptides corresponding to loop 3-4, loop 5-6, and the serine/threonine-rich region of the COOH terminus recognize rhodopsin by immunoblot analysis and also recognize the native protein within the membrane, allowing these probes to be used for functional studies. Rhodopsin reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles binds transducin in the light which significantly reduces the binding of antipeptide antibodies corresponding to loop 3-4 and the COOH terminus of rhodopsin. However, the binding of the antibody raised against a 14-amino-acid peptide corresponding to a sequence within loop 5-6 of rhodopsin was unaffected by the presence of transducin. These results suggest a preferential involvement of regions in or near loop 3-4 and the COOH terminus in the binding of transducin to rhodopsin. In contrast, a significant portion of loop 5-6 does not form a binding domain for the G-protein."
https://openalex.org/W1567442633,"Escherichia coli dnaZX, the gene which when mutant blocks DNA chain elongation, was cloned into a lambda PL promoter-mediated expression vector. In cells carrying this plasmid, the activity that complements a mutant dnaZ extract in replicating a primed single-stranded DNA circle was increased about 20-fold. Two polypeptides of 71 and 52 kDa were overproduced. Upon fractionation, two complementing activities were purified to homogeneity and proved to be the 71- and 52-kDa polypeptides. Immunoassays revealed their respective identities with the tau and gamma subunits of DNA polymerase III holoenzyme. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of the first 12 residues were identical in both subunits, as were their molar specific activities in dnaZ complementation. Thus, the tau subunit complements the defect in the mutant holoenzyme from the dnaZts strain as efficiently as does the gamma subunit. Inasmuch as the 71-kDa subunit (tau) can also overcome the enzymatic defect in a dnaX mutant strain, this polypeptide has dual replication functions, only one of which can be performed by the gamma subunit. Availability of pure tau and gamma subunits for study has provided the basis for proposing an asymmetry in the structure and function of a dimeric DNA polymerase III holoenzyme."

https://openalex.org/W2087552287,"The three-dimensional structure of most enzymes is unknown; however, many enzymes may have structural motifs similar to those in the known structures of functionally related enzymes. Evidence is presented that an enzyme of unknown structure [Ile-transfer RNA (tRNA) synthetase] may share a functionally important structural motif with an enzyme of related function (Tyr-tRNA synthetase). This approach involves (i) identifying segments of Ile-tRNA synthetase that have been unusually conserved during evolution, (ii) predicting the function of one such segment by assuming a structural relation between Ile-tRNA synthetase and Tyr-tRNA synthetase, and (iii) testing the predicted function by mutagenesis and subsequent biochemical analysis. Random mutations were introduced by cassette mutagenesis into a ten-amino-acid segment of Ile-tRNA synthetase that was predicted to be involved in the formation of the binding site for isoleucine. Few amino acid substitutions appear to be tolerated in this region. However, one substitution (independently isolated twice) increased the Michaelis constant Km for isoleucine in the adenylate synthesis reaction by greater than 6000-fold, but had little effect on the Km for adenosine triphosphate, the apparent Km for tRNA, or the rate constant kcat."
https://openalex.org/W1485389302,"A cDNA clone for the chicken liver receptor which mediates endocytosis of glycoproteins containing terminal N-acetylglucosamine has been isolated and sequenced, confirming the previously obtained amino acid sequence of this protein (which is also known as the chicken hepatic lectin). This cDNA was introduced into Rat-1 fibroblasts and expressed using the promotor in the long terminal repeat of Moloney murine leukemia virus. Cells expressing chicken receptor were identified by screening with antireceptor antibodies followed by fluorescein-conjugated second antibodies. Receptor expressed in these cells was indistinguishable on gel electrophoresis from receptor isolated from liver. Three clonally isolated lines were examined for their ability to bind agalacto-alpha 1-acid glycoproteins at 0 degrees C and to take up and degrade this ligand at 37 degrees C. The receptor number (50,000/cell), affinity for ligand (35 nM), and uptake rate (5 molecules ligand/surface receptor/h) are similar to those previously observed for chicken hepatocytes, and for the uptake of asialoglycoproteins by rat hepatocytes and hepatoma cells. These findings indicate that the chicken receptor correctly traverses the endocytic pathway in a rat cell even though the cytoplasmic domain of this protein shows no primary structural homology with the corresponding portion of the rat liver receptor or with receptors found in fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W1650124075,"Preincubation of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I (pol I) with 5'-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine (5'-FSBA) results in an irreversible inactivation of DNA polymerase activity with concomitant covalent binding of 5'-FSBA to enzyme. pol I-associated 3'-5' exonuclease activity, however, remains unaffected. Kinetic studies of inactivation indicate that the degree of inactivation is directly proportional to the concentration of 5'-FSBA and increases linearly with time. The presence of the metal chelate form of dNTP substrates or template primer, but not the template or primer alone, protects the enzyme from inactivation by 5'-FSBA. A complete inactivation of polymerase activity occurs when 2 mol of 5'-FSBA are covalently linked to 1 mol of enzyme, suggesting two sites of modification. Tryptic peptide mapping of 5'-FSBA-treated enzyme revealed the presence of two distinct peptides containing the affinity label, confirming the presence of two reactive sites in the enzyme. However, we find that only one of the two sites is essential for the polymerase activity since, in the presence of substrate dNTP or template primer during preincubation of enzyme with 5'-FSBA, incorporation of the affinity label is reduced by only 1 mol. Peptide analysis of dNTP or template primer-protected enzyme further revealed that a peptide eluting at 35 min from the C-18 matrix was protected from the 5'-FSBA reaction. It is therefore concluded that this peptide contains the domain essential for polymerase activity. Staphylococcus aureus V-8 protease digestion, amino acid composition, and sequence analysis of this peptide revealed this domain to span residues 669 to 687 in the primary amino acid sequence of pol I, and arginine 682 was found to be the site of 5'-FSBA reactivity."
https://openalex.org/W1493674896,"The components of the renin-angiotensin system have been colocalized in many tissues suggesting that local generation of angiotensin II can regulate blood flow in specific organs or tissues. This in combination with the fact that proliferating tissues require angiogenesis and increased blood flow to develop have led us to study the relationship of angiotensinogen mRNA production to cell cycle regulation. Reuber H35 (H4IIE) cells were growth-arrested by serum deprivation. Cells were then treated with 10% fetal calf serum, depleted serum, or insulin. Insulin and serum were equally potent at increasing beta-actin mRNA levels, depressing angiotensinogen mRNA levels, and in increasing [3H]methyl thymidine incorporation. The half-maximal insulin effect occurred at 5 x 10(-9) M. Insulin-like growth factor I and II had no effect on any of the parameters measured. 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate (TPA) also induced beta-actin mRNA, decreased angiotensinogen mRNA, and caused an increase in [3H]methyl thymidine incorporation. The TPA effects were of shorter duration and of lower magnitude than those caused by insulin or serum. Inactivation of protein kinase C by preincubation with TPA did not block the insulin response. TPA has been shown to induce angiogenesis in vitro. Thus, these studies suggest that inhibition of angiotensinogen gene activity may be part of the proliferative or angiogenic process. Our experimental data may provide a model for further experimental dissection of the biochemical steps involved in angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1485254294,"The amino acid residue Tyr-165C of aspartate transcarbamoylase (EC 2.1.3.2) of Escherichia coli has been proposed to be involved in the transition from the T-state to the R-state upon binding of the bisubstrate analogue N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartate. Site-specific mutagenesis has been used to substitute phenylalanine for tyrosine, thus maintaining the aromatic R-group but removing the charged hydroxyl moiety. This mutation dramatically altered the aspartate requirements for the holoenzyme but did not substantially affect the homotropic or heterotropic characteristics of the oligomer. The aspartate requirements for half-maximal saturation increased from 5.5 mM at pH 7.0 for the native holoenzyme to approximately 90 mM in the mutant enzyme. Nonetheless, estimates of the kinetic cooperativity index remained similar (Hill coefficients: Tyr-165C, n = 2.1; Phe-165C, n = 2.5). CTP inhibited both enzymes approximately 70% and ATP activated approximately 40% at the aspartate concentrations required for half-maximal saturation (5 and 90 mM, respectively). The maximal velocity of the mutant holoenzyme is almost identical to that of the wild-type enzyme. The phenylalanine substitution does not affect the stability of the holoenzyme to heat or mercurials, and the Vmax of the catalytic trimer was 444% greater than that of the holoenzyme. Upon dissociation of the wild-type native enzyme into catalytic trimers, the Vmax increased 450%. The Km for aspartate in the separated catalytic trimer is approximately 2-fold higher than for the native catalytic trimer (16.5 versus 8 mM at pH 7.0). It is clear from the data that although Tyr-165C is not directly involved in the active site of the enzyme, it does play a pivotal role in catalytic transitions of the holoenzyme. In addition, the homotropic and heterotropic characteristics of the enzyme do not seem to be altered by the substitution of phenylalanine for Tyr-165C in the E. coli aspartate transcarbamoylase, although other substitutions have been reported (Robey, E. H., and Schachman, H. K. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 11180-11183) which show more complex effects."
https://openalex.org/W2023918550,"Insulin receptors on the surface of isolated rat adipocytes were photoaffinity labeled at 12 degrees C with the iodinated photoreactive insulin analogue, 125I-B2 (2-nitro-4-azidophenylacetyl)-des-PheB1-insulin, and the pathways in the intracellular processing of the labeled receptors were studied at 37 degrees C. During 37 degrees C incubations, the labeled 440-kDa insulin receptors were continuously internalized (as assessed by trypsin inaccessibility) and degraded such that up to 50% of the initially labeled receptors were lost by 120 min. Metabolic poisons (0.125-0.75 mM 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) and 1-10 mM NaF), which led to dose-dependent depletion of adipocyte ATP pools, inhibited receptor loss, and caused up to 3-fold increase in intracellular receptor accumulation. This effect was due to inhibition of intracellular receptor degradation, and there was no apparent effect of the metabolic poisons on initial internalization of the receptors. Following maximal intracellular accumulation of labeled insulin receptors in the presence of NaF or DNP, removal of these agents resulted in a subsequent, time-dependent degradation of the accumulated receptors. However, when the lysosomotropic agent, chloroquine (0.2 mM), was added immediately following removal of the metabolic poisons, further degradation of the intracellularly accumulated receptors was prevented, suggesting that the chloroquine-sensitive degradation of insulin receptors occurs distal to the site of inhibition by NaF or DNP. To confirm this, maximal intracellular accumulation of labeled receptors was first allowed to occur in the presence of chloroquine and the cells were then washed and reincubated in chloroquine-free media in the absence or presence of NaF or DNP. Under these conditions, degradation of the intracellularly accumulated receptors continued to occur, and NaF or DNP failed to block the degradation. In summary, these results indicate that the loss of cell surface insulin receptors in adipocytes involves: 1) initial internalization of the receptors to a nondegradative intracellular compartment by a process that is relatively insensitive to ATP depletion, followed by 2) a highly energy-dependent unidirectional translocation of the receptors from this compartment to chloroquine-sensitive site(s) of degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1527385799,"The cellular processing of insulin and insulin receptors was studied using a rat fibroblast cell line that had been transfected with a normal human insulin receptor gene, expressing approximately 500 times the normal number of native fibroblast insulin receptors. These cells bind and internalize insulin normally. Biochemical assays based on the selective precipitation by polyethylene glycol of intact insulin-receptor complexes but not of free intracellular insulin were developed to study the time course of intracellular insulin-receptor dissociation. Fibroblasts were incubated with radiolabeled insulin at 4 degrees C, and internalization of insulin-receptor complexes was initiated by warming the cells to 37 degrees C. Within 2 min, 90% of the internalized radioactivity was composed of intact insulin-receptor complexes. The total number of complexes reached a maximum by 5 min and decreased rapidly thereafter with a t 1/2 of approximately 10 min. There was a distinct delay in the appearance, rate of rise, and peak of intracellular free and degraded insulin. The dissociation of insulin from internalized insulin-receptor complexes was markedly inhibited by monensin and chloroquine. Furthermore, chloroquine markedly increased the number of cross-linkable intracellular insulin-receptor complexes, as analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis autoradiography. These findings suggest that acidification of intracellular vesicles is responsible for insulin-receptor dissociation. Physical segregation of dissociated intracellular insulin from its receptor was monitored, based on the ability of dissociated insulin to rebind to receptor upon neutralization of acidic intracellular vesicles with monensin. The results are consistent with the view that segregation of insulin and receptor occurs 5-10 min after initiation of dissociation. These studies demonstrate the intracellular itinerary of insulin-receptor complexes, including internalization, dissociation of insulin from the internalized receptor within an acidified compartment, segregation of insulin from the receptor, and subsequent ligand degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1547265955,"Metallothioneins have been isolated from Saccharomyces cerevisiae CUP1 mutants generated by Wright et al. (Wright, C. F., Hamer, D. H., and McKenney, K. (1986) Nucleic Acids Res. 14, 8489-8499). In the mutant metallothioneins, pairs of cysteinyl residues have been converted to seryl residues. The mutant proteins differ only in the positions of the double substitutions; each mutant molecule contains 10 cysteinyl residues. Each mutant protein lacks the first 8 residues at the amino terminus from the decoded gene sequence of the CUP1 locus. Mutant molecules consist of 53 residues analogous to the wild-type metallothionein and are designated 9/11, 24/26, 36/38, and 49/50 (in reference to the sequence positions of the Cys----Ser conversions). The properties of the mutant metallothioneins are vastly different, and host cells harboring the different plasmid-encoded mutant molecules show marked differences in sensitivity to CuSO4. Growth inhibition was observed at CuSO4 concentrations up to mM in cells containing the 9/11, 24/26, and 36/38 molecules, but not for cells containing protein 49/50. A CuSO4 concentration of 5 mM was required to inhibit the growth of yeast containing either 49/50 or the wild-type metallothionein. In the purified proteins the copper binding stoichiometry of each molecule, except protein 24/26, was nearly 8 mol eq. Protein 24/26 bound 5.5 copper ions/molecule. The Cu(I) chelator bathocuproine disulfonate reacted with over 50% of the copper ions in proteins 9/11, 24/26, and 36/38, but less than 10% of the copper ions in proteins 49/50 and wild-type metallothionein were reactive. The thiolates in 9/11, 24/26, and 36/38 were also more reactive in a disulfide exchange reaction with dithiodipyridine compared with the sulfhydryls in 49/50 and the wild-type molecules. The four mutant copper proteins are luminescent and exhibit a similar quantum yield. The cluster structures contributing to the particular electronic transitions are markedly more sensitive to oxygen in proteins 9/11, 24/26, and 36/38 compared with 49/50 and the wild-type molecules. The air-sensitive proteins exhibit a tertiary fold not recognized by polyclonal antibodies directed to a conformational epitope on yeast Cu-metallothionein. Protein 49/50 cross-reacts with the antibody in a concentration-dependent fashion similar to the wild-type protein. Mutation of 2 cysteinyl residues in the carboxyl portion of metallothionein does not significantly alter properties of the molecule, whereas mutation of several cysteines in the amino-terminal portion of the molecule yields a different conformation."
https://openalex.org/W2030404137,"Direct payment by patients for treatment with drugs still in development is the subject of controversy. The matter goes deeper than it might first appear.Oldham is the director of the Biological Therapy Institute, which has been criticized for accepting patients' money for laboratory research leading to experimental drug treatments. He raises the question of who pays the bills for the development of new drugs elsewhere in the clinical research system. Oldham argues that many fees and laboratory costs for university hospital- and clinic-based research are billed to patients and their insurance companies. Research grants and contracts to universities from the government and pharmaceutical companies are funded by taxpayers (former, current, and future patients) and by purchasers (patients) of already-approved drugs. Oldham asks why indirect funding of research by patients is acceptable while direct funding is not."

Marcellomycin inhibits preferentially the last phase of transcription initiation. During this phase a stabilized ternary complex is formed consisting of RNA polymerase, DNA template, and a nascent RNA oligonucleotide about 11 nucleotides long, resulting from the extension of the RNA dinucleotide component of the corresponding early ternary complex. Marcellomycin is also responsible for minor inhibition of the formation of the open binary RNA polymerase-template complex, which serves as the precursor of the ternary complex. These findings suggest that marcellomycin may be a potentially useful tool in the study of the late stages of transcription initiation. The present findings may also contribute to a better overall understanding of the mode of drug action at the level of individual genes."
