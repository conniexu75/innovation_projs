https://openalex.org/W2159946869,"Using next-generation sequencing technology alone, we have successfully generated and assembled a draft sequence of the giant panda genome. The assembled contigs (2.25 gigabases (Gb)) cover approximately 94% of the whole genome, and the remaining gaps (0.05 Gb) seem to contain carnivore-specific repeats and tandem repeats. Comparisons with the dog and human showed that the panda genome has a lower divergence rate. The assessment of panda genes potentially underlying some of its unique traits indicated that its bamboo diet might be more dependent on its gut microbiome than its own genetic composition. We also identified more than 2.7 million heterozygous single nucleotide polymorphisms in the diploid genome. Our data and analyses provide a foundation for promoting mammalian genetic research, and demonstrate the feasibility for using next-generation sequencing technologies for accurate, cost-effective and rapid de novo assembly of large eukaryotic genomes."
https://openalex.org/W2100172973,"Recent research on changing fears has examined targeting reconsolidation. During reconsolidation, stored information is rendered labile after being retrieved. Pharmacological manipulations at this stage result in an inability to retrieve the memories at later times, suggesting that they are erased or persistently inhibited. Unfortunately, the use of these pharmacological manipulations in humans can be problematic. Here we introduce a non-invasive technique to target the reconsolidation of fear memories in humans. We provide evidence that old fear memories can be updated with non-fearful information provided during the reconsolidation window. As a consequence, fear responses are no longer expressed, an effect that lasted at least a year and was selective only to reactivated memories without affecting others. These findings demonstrate the adaptive role of reconsolidation as a window of opportunity to rewrite emotional memories, and suggest a non-invasive technique that can be used safely in humans to prevent the return of fear. Reconsolidation is a natural mechanism in human memory: the reconsolidation phase allows new information available at the time of retrieval to be incorporated into an old memory. Although pharmacological blockade of reconsolidation has been used to prevent the return of fear in animal models, many of these manipulations involve compounds that are toxic to humans. Elizabeth Phelps and co-workers now report a non-invasive technique of rewriting fear memories that avoids the use of drugs. The procedure is based on an established technique in which memories of traumatic events are 'extinguished' by repeated exposure to traumatic reminders in a safe environment. This works up to a point, but memories are masked rather than eliminated and can return, for example with the passage of time or due to stress. The new advance lies in timing: if the 'safe' information is introduced during the reconsolidation window of old fear memories, the fear does not return. This work suggests that post-traumatic stress disorder and other anxiety conditions might be responsive to new types of non-invasive therapy. During reconsolidation of memories, stored information is rendered labile after being retrieved and can be manipulated. Previous studies have used pharmacological intervention to disrupt retrieved memories; here, however, a non-invasive, behavioural technique is used to target the reconsolidation of fear memories in humans. Non-fearful information provided during the reconsolidation window appears to update old fear memories, causing a lack of expression of fear responses."
https://openalex.org/W2048255587,"When oxygen is abundant, quiescent cells efficiently extract energy from glucose primarily by oxidative phosphorylation, whereas under the same conditions tumour cells consume glucose more avidly, converting it to lactate. This long-observed phenomenon is known as aerobic glycolysis, and is important for cell growth. Because aerobic glycolysis is only useful to growing cells, it is tightly regulated in a proliferation-linked manner. In mammals, this is partly achieved through control of pyruvate kinase isoform expression. The embryonic pyruvate kinase isoform, PKM2, is almost universally re-expressed in cancer, and promotes aerobic glycolysis, whereas the adult isoform, PKM1, promotes oxidative phosphorylation. These two isoforms result from mutually exclusive alternative splicing of the PKM pre-mRNA, reflecting inclusion of either exon 9 (PKM1) or exon 10 (PKM2). Here we show that three heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) proteins, polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB, also known as hnRNPI), hnRNPA1 and hnRNPA2, bind repressively to sequences flanking exon 9, resulting in exon 10 inclusion. We also demonstrate that the oncogenic transcription factor c-Myc upregulates transcription of PTB, hnRNPA1 and hnRNPA2, ensuring a high PKM2/PKM1 ratio. Establishing a relevance to cancer, we show that human gliomas overexpress c-Myc, PTB, hnRNPA1 and hnRNPA2 in a manner that correlates with PKM2 expression. Our results thus define a pathway that regulates an alternative splicing event required for tumour cell proliferation."

https://openalex.org/W2152531901,"Peter Fraser and colleagues report a genome-wide analysis of transcription interactions involving the globin genes in mouse erythroid cells. They demonstrate that the transcription factor Klf1 mediates preferential co-associations between genes it regulates. The discovery of interchromosomal interactions in higher eukaryotes points to a functional interplay between genome architecture and gene expression, challenging the view of transcription as a one-dimensional process. However, the extent of interchromosomal interactions and the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Here we present the first genome-wide analysis of transcriptional interactions using the mouse globin genes in erythroid tissues. Our results show that the active globin genes associate with hundreds of other transcribed genes, revealing extensive and preferential intra- and interchromosomal transcription interactomes. We show that the transcription factor Klf1 mediates preferential co-associations of Klf1-regulated genes at a limited number of specialized transcription factories. Our results establish a new gene expression paradigm, implying that active co-regulated genes and their regulatory factors cooperate to create specialized nuclear hot spots optimized for efficient and coordinated transcriptional control."

Spirometric measures of lung function are heritable traits that reflect respiratory health and predict morbidity and mortality. We meta-analyzed genome-wide association studies for two clinically important lung-function measures: forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) and its ratio to forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC), an indicator of airflow obstruction. This meta-analysis included 20,890 participants of European ancestry from four CHARGE Consortium studies: Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities, Cardiovascular Health Study, Framingham Heart Study and Rotterdam Study. We identified eight loci associated with FEV1/FVC (HHIP, GPR126, ADAM19, AGER-PPT2, FAM13A, PTCH1, PID1 and HTR4) and one locus associated with FEV1 (INTS12-GSTCD-NPNT) at or near genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10−8) in the CHARGE Consortium dataset. Our findings may offer insights into pulmonary function and pathogenesis of chronic lung disease."

https://openalex.org/W2107766358,"Pulmonary function measures are heritable traits that predict morbidity and mortality and define chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We tested genome-wide association with forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) and the ratio of FEV(1) to forced vital capacity (FVC) in the SpiroMeta consortium (n = 20,288 individuals of European ancestry). We conducted a meta-analysis of top signals with data from direct genotyping (n < or = 32,184 additional individuals) and in silico summary association data from the CHARGE Consortium (n = 21,209) and the Health 2000 survey (n < or = 883). We confirmed the reported locus at 4q31 and identified associations with FEV(1) or FEV(1)/FVC and common variants at five additional loci: 2q35 in TNS1 (P = 1.11 x 10(-12)), 4q24 in GSTCD (2.18 x 10(-23)), 5q33 in HTR4 (P = 4.29 x 10(-9)), 6p21 in AGER (P = 3.07 x 10(-15)) and 15q23 in THSD4 (P = 7.24 x 10(-15)). mRNA analyses showed expression of TNS1, GSTCD, AGER, HTR4 and THSD4 in human lung tissue. These associations offer mechanistic insight into pulmonary function regulation and indicate potential targets for interventions to alleviate respiratory disease."
https://openalex.org/W2004098727,"Placing a macroscopic object in its quantum-mechanical ground state of motion is an exciting experimental prospect. If achieved, it should reveal counter-intuitive physical behaviour — such as the existence of the system in two locations simultaneously. Rocheleau et al. come tantalizingly close to this goal. They have cooled a nanomechanical resonator to a point where the probability of it residing in its motional ground state is 0.21 (which in itself should be sufficient to enable direct measurement of some anticipated quantum phenomena), and have identified the experimental hurdles that need to be overcome to push the system more fully into this exotic quantum regime. Placing a macroscopic object in its quantum-mechanical ground state of motion is an exciting experimental target that should reveal counterintuitive physical behaviour — such as the existence of states in which the mechanical system is located in two places simultaneously. A nanomechanical resonator is now cooled to a point where the probability of its residing in the quantum ground state of motion is 0.21; this level of cooling should allow a series of fundamental quantum mechanical observations. Cold, macroscopic mechanical systems are expected to behave contrary to our usual classical understanding of reality; the most striking and counterintuitive predictions involve the existence of states in which the mechanical system is located in two places simultaneously. Various schemes have been proposed to generate and detect such states1,2, and all require starting from mechanical states that are close to the lowest energy eigenstate, the mechanical ground state. Here we report the cooling of the motion of a radio-frequency nanomechanical resonator by parametric coupling to a driven, microwave-frequency superconducting resonator. Starting from a thermal occupation of 480 quanta, we have observed occupation factors as low as 3.8 ± 1.3 and expect the mechanical resonator to be found with probability 0.21 in the quantum ground state of motion. Further cooling is limited by random excitation of the microwave resonator and heating of the dissipative mechanical bath. This level of cooling is expected to make possible a series of fundamental quantum mechanical observations including direct measurement of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle and quantum entanglement with qubits."
https://openalex.org/W1994442402,"All hard, convex shapes are conjectured by Ulam to pack more densely than spheres, which have a maximum packing fraction of {\phi} = {\pi}/\sqrt18 ~ 0.7405. For many shapes, simple lattice packings easily surpass this packing fraction. For regular tetrahedra, this conjecture was shown to be true only very recently; an ordered arrangement was obtained via geometric construction with {\phi} = 0.7786, which was subsequently compressed numerically to {\phi} = 0.7820. Here we show that tetrahedra pack much better than this, and in a completely unexpected way. Following a conceptually different approach, using thermodynamic computer simulations that allow the system to evolve naturally towards high-density states, we observe that a fluid of hard tetrahedra undergoes a first-order phase transition to a dodecagonal quasicrystal, which can be compressed to a packing fraction of {\phi} = 0.8324. By compressing a crystalline approximant of the quasicrystal, the highest packing fraction we obtain is {\phi} = 0.8503. If quasicrystal formation is suppressed, the system remains disordered, jams, and compresses to {\phi} = 0.7858. Jamming and crystallization are both preceded by an entropy-driven transition from a simple fluid of independent tetrahedra to a complex fluid characterized by tetrahedra arranged in densely packed local motifs that form a percolating network at the transition. The quasicrystal that we report represents the first example of a quasicrystal formed from hard or non-spherical particles. Our results demonstrate that particle shape and entropy can produce highly complex, ordered structures."
https://openalex.org/W2163662566,"Stomata in the epidermal tissues of leaves are valves through which passes CO2, and as such they influence the global carbon cycle1. The two-dimensional pattern and density of stomata in the leaf epidermis are genetically and environmentally regulated to optimize gas exchange2. Two putative intercellular signalling factors, EPF1 and EPF2, function as negative regulators of stomatal development in Arabidopsis, possibly by interacting with the receptor-like protein TMM3,4,5,6. One or more positive intercellular signalling factors are assumed to be involved in stomatal development, but their identities are unknown7. Here we show that a novel secretory peptide, which we designate as stomagen, is a positive intercellular signalling factor that is conserved among vascular plants. Stomagen is a 45-amino--rich peptide that is generated from a 102-amino-acid precursor protein designated as STOMAGEN. Both an in planta analysis and a semi-in-vitro analysis with recombinant and chemically synthesized stomagen peptides showed that stomagen has stomata-inducing activity in a dose-dependent manner. A genetic analysis showed that TMM is epistatic to STOMAGEN (At4g12970), suggesting that stomatal development is finely regulated by competitive binding of positive and negative regulators to the same receptor. Notably, STOMAGEN is expressed in inner tissues (the mesophyll) of immature leaves but not in the epidermal tissues where stomata develop. This study provides evidence of a mesophyll-derived positive regulator of stomatal density. Our findings provide a conceptual advancement in understanding stomatal development: inner photosynthetic tissues optimize their function by regulating stomatal density in the epidermis for efficient uptake of CO2."

https://openalex.org/W2039380477,"The intrinsic variation between mass spectrometry data collected from replicate samples is a major hurdle to realizing the full potential of shotgun proteomics. Griffin et al. present a simple method to compare label-free quantifications between technical and biological replicates. Replicate mass spectrometry (MS) measurements and the use of multiple analytical methods can greatly expand the comprehensiveness of shotgun proteomic profiling of biological samples1,2,3,4,5. However, the inherent biases and variations in such data create computational and statistical challenges for quantitative comparative analysis6. We developed and tested a normalized, label-free quantitative method termed the normalized spectral index (SIN), which combines three MS abundance features: peptide count, spectral count and fragment-ion (tandem MS or MS/MS) intensity. SIN largely eliminated variances between replicate MS measurements, permitting quantitative reproducibility and highly significant quantification of thousands of proteins detected in replicate MS measurements of the same and distinct samples. It accurately predicts protein abundance more often than the five other methods we tested. Comparative immunoblotting and densitometry further validate our method. Comparative quantification of complex data sets from multiple shotgun proteomics measurements is relevant for systems biology and biomarker discovery."
https://openalex.org/W2089238244,"The continuing rise in atmospheric CO2 causes stomatal pores in leaves to close and thus globally affects CO2 influx into plants, water use efficiency and leaf heat stress. However, the CO2-binding proteins that control this response remain unknown. Moreover, which cell type responds to CO2, mesophyll or guard cells, and whether photosynthesis mediates this response are matters of debate. We demonstrate that Arabidopsis thaliana double-mutant plants in the beta-carbonic anhydrases betaCA1 and betaCA4 show impaired CO2-regulation of stomatal movements and increased stomatal density, but retain functional abscisic-acid and blue-light responses. betaCA-mediated CO2-triggered stomatal movements are not, in first-order, linked to whole leaf photosynthesis and can function in guard cells. Furthermore, guard cell betaca-overexpressing plants exhibit instantaneous enhanced water use efficiency. Guard cell expression of mammalian alphaCAII complements the reduced sensitivity of ca1 ca4 plants, showing that carbonic anhydrase-mediated catalysis is an important mechanism for betaCA-mediated CO2-induced stomatal closure and patch clamp analyses indicate that CO2/HCO3- transfers the signal to anion channel regulation. These findings, together with ht1-2 (ref. 9) epistasis analysis demonstrate that carbonic anhydrases function early in the CO2 signalling pathway, which controls gas-exchange between plants and the atmosphere."

These circuits have been used to construct proof-of-principle systems with promising results in industrial and medical applications. However, advances in synthetic biology have been limited by a lack of interoperable parts, techniques for dynamically probing biological systems and frameworks for the reliable construction and operation of complex, higher-order networks.

https://openalex.org/W2030722162,"The nuclear receptor TLX (also known as NR2E1) is essential for adult neural stem cell self-renewal; however, the molecular mechanisms involved remain elusive. Here we show that TLX activates the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in adult mouse neural stem cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Wnt/beta-catenin signalling is important in the proliferation and self-renewal of adult neural stem cells in the presence of epidermal growth factor and fibroblast growth factor. Wnt7a and active beta-catenin promote neural stem cell self-renewal, whereas the deletion of Wnt7a or the lentiviral transduction of axin, a beta-catenin inhibitor, led to decreased cell proliferation in adult neurogenic areas. Lentiviral transduction of active beta-catenin led to increased numbers of type B neural stem cells in the subventricular zone of adult brains, whereas deletion of Wnt7a or TLX resulted in decreased numbers of neural stem cells retaining bromodeoxyuridine label in the adult brain. Both Wnt7a and active beta-catenin significantly rescued a TLX (also known as Nr2e1) short interfering RNA-induced deficiency in neural stem cell proliferation. Lentiviral transduction of an active beta-catenin increased cell proliferation in neurogenic areas of TLX-null adult brains markedly. These results strongly support the hypothesis that TLX acts through the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway to regulate neural stem cell proliferation and self-renewal. Moreover, this study suggests that neural stem cells can promote their own self-renewal by secreting signalling molecules that act in an autocrine/paracrine mode."
https://openalex.org/W2042984003,"The majority of excitatory synapses in the mammalian CNS (central nervous system) are formed on dendritic spines, and spine morphology and distribution are critical for synaptic transmission, synaptic integration and plasticity. Here, we show that a secreted semaphorin, Sema3F, is a negative regulator of spine development and synaptic structure. Mice with null mutations in genes encoding Sema3F, and its holoreceptor components neuropilin-2 (Npn-2, also known as Nrp2) and plexin A3 (PlexA3, also known as Plxna3), exhibit increased dentate gyrus (DG) granule cell (GC) and cortical layer V pyramidal neuron spine number and size, and also aberrant spine distribution. Moreover, Sema3F promotes loss of spines and excitatory synapses in dissociated neurons in vitro, and in Npn-2(-/-) brain slices cortical layer V and DG GCs exhibit increased mEPSC (miniature excitatory postsynaptic current) frequency. In contrast, a distinct Sema3A-Npn-1/PlexA4 signalling cascade controls basal dendritic arborization in layer V cortical neurons, but does not influence spine morphogenesis or distribution. These disparate effects of secreted semaphorins are reflected in the restricted dendritic localization of Npn-2 to apical dendrites and of Npn-1 (also known as Nrp1) to all dendrites of cortical pyramidal neurons. Therefore, Sema3F signalling controls spine distribution along select dendritic processes, and distinct secreted semaphorin signalling events orchestrate CNS connectivity through the differential control of spine morphogenesis, synapse formation, and the elaboration of dendritic morphology."

https://openalex.org/W1970953122,"Shigella infection can lead to stimulation of the NF-κB pathway. IpaH9.8, a Shigella effector with ubiquitin ligase activity polyubiquitylates NEMO, a key regulator of NF-κB activation, leading to its degradation and subsequent impairment of NF-κB activation. NF-κB (nuclear factor κB) has a pivotal role in many cellular processes, including the inflammatory and immune responses and, therefore, its activation is tightly regulated by the IKK (IκB kinase) complex and by IκBα degradation. When Shigella bacteria multiply within epithelial cells they release peptidoglycans, which are recognized by Nod1 and stimulate the NF-κB pathway, thus leading to a severe inflammatory response. Here, we show that IpaH9.8, a Shigella effector possessing E3 ligase activity, dampens the NF-κB-mediated inflammatory response to the bacterial infection in a unique way. IpaH9.8 interacts with NEMO/IKKγ and ABIN-1, a ubiquitin-binding adaptor protein, promoting ABIN-1-dependent polyubiquitylation of NEMO. Consequently, polyubiquitylated NEMO undergoes proteasome-dependent degradation, which perturbs NF-κB activation. As NEMO is essential for NF-κB activation, we propose that the polyubiquitylation and degradation of NEMO during Shigella infection is a new bacterial strategy to modulate host inflammatory responses."

https://openalex.org/W1977866604,"Techniques to detect and quantify DNA and RNA molecules in biological samples have had a central role in genomics research. Over the past decade, several techniques have been developed to improve detection performance and reduce the cost of genetic analysis. In particular, significant advances in label-free methods have been reported. Yet detection of DNA molecules at concentrations below the femtomolar level requires amplified detection schemes. Here we report a unique nanomechanical response of hybridized DNA and RNA molecules that serves as an intrinsic molecular label. Nanomechanical measurements on a microarray surface have sufficient background signal rejection to allow direct detection and counting of hybridized molecules. The digital response of the sensor provides a large dynamic range that is critical for gene expression profiling. We have measured differential expressions of microRNAs in tumour samples; such measurements have been shown to help discriminate between the tissue origins of metastatic tumours. Two hundred picograms of total RNA is found to be sufficient for this analysis. In addition, the limit of detection in pure samples is found to be one attomolar. These results suggest that nanomechanical read-out of microarrays promises attomolar-level sensitivity and large dynamic range for the analysis of gene expression, while eliminating biochemical manipulations, amplification and labelling."
https://openalex.org/W2071216784,"This study shows that continuous synthesis and availability of the phosphoinositide PIP3 at the postsynaptic terminal is necessary for synaptic transmission in rat hippocampal neurons. A slow but constant turnover of PIP3 was required for maintaining postsynaptic AMPA receptor, but not NMDA receptor, clustering. Despite their low abundance, phosphoinositides are critical regulators of intracellular signaling and membrane compartmentalization. However, little is known of phosphoinositide function at the postsynaptic membrane. Here we show that continuous synthesis and availability of phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3) at the postsynaptic terminal is necessary for sustaining synaptic function in rat hippocampal neurons. This requirement was specific for synaptic, but not extrasynaptic, AMPA receptors, nor for NMDA receptors. PIP3 downregulation impaired PSD-95 accumulation in spines. Concomitantly, AMPA receptors became more mobile and migrated from the postsynaptic density toward the perisynaptic membrane within the spine, leading to synaptic depression. Notably, these effects were only revealed after prolonged inhibition of PIP3 synthesis or by direct quenching of this phosphoinositide at the postsynaptic cell. Therefore, we conclude that a slow, but constant, turnover of PIP3 at synapses is required for maintaining AMPA receptor clustering and synaptic strength under basal conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2076271758,"How living systems detect the presence of genotoxic damage embedded in a million-fold excess of undamaged DNA is an unresolved question in biology. Here we have captured and structurally elucidated a base-excision DNA repair enzyme, MutM, at the stage of initial encounter with a damaged nucleobase, 8-oxoguanine (oxoG), nested within a DNA duplex. Three structures of intrahelical oxoG-encounter complexes are compared with sequence-matched structures containing a normal G base in place of an oxoG lesion. Although the protein-DNA interfaces in the matched complexes differ by only two atoms-those that distinguish oxoG from G-their pronounced structural differences indicate that MutM can detect a lesion in DNA even at the earliest stages of encounter. All-atom computer simulations show the pathway by which encounter of the enzyme with the lesion causes extrusion from the DNA duplex, and they elucidate the critical free energy difference between oxoG and G along the extrusion pathway."

In a baryon-dominated jet only weak, tangled fields generated in situ through shocks would be present. In an alternative model, jets are threaded with large scale magnetic fields that originate at the central engine and which accelerate and collimate the jets. The way to distinguish between the models is to measure the degree of polarization in early-time emission, however previous claims of gamma-ray polarization have been controversial. Here we report that the early optical emission from GRB 090102 was polarized at the level of P=10+/-1%, indicating the presence of large-scale fields originating in the expanding fireball. If the degree of polarization and its position angle were variable on timescales shorter than our 60-s exposure, then the peak polarization may have been larger than 10 per cent."
https://openalex.org/W2079686476,"We propose that synapses may be the workhorse of the neuronal computations that underlie probabilistic reasoning. We built a neural circuit model for probabilistic inference in which information provided by different sensory cues must be integrated and the predictive powers of individual cues about an outcome are deduced through experience. We found that bounded synapses naturally compute, through reward-dependent plasticity, the posterior probability that a choice alternative is correct given that a cue is presented. Furthermore, a decision circuit endowed with such synapses makes choices on the basis of the summed log posterior odds and performs near-optimal cue combination. The model was validated by reproducing salient observations of, and provides insights into, a monkey experiment using a categorization task. Our model thus suggests a biophysical instantiation of the Bayesian decision rule, while predicting important deviations from it similar to the 'base-rate neglect' observed in human studies when alternatives have unequal prior probabilities."
https://openalex.org/W2154496264,"The authors describe cell-based neurotransmitter fluorescent engineered reporters (CNiFERs), a new biosensor for monitoring neurotransmitter receptor activation. CNiFERs are cells engineered to express both a metabotropic receptor that triggers the Gq protein–coupled receptor cascade to increase calcium concentrations and a genetically encoded fluorescent calcium sensor for visualization. Tools from molecular biology, combined with in vivo optical imaging techniques, provide new mechanisms for noninvasively observing brain processes. Current approaches primarily probe cell-based variables, such as cytosolic calcium or membrane potential, but not cell-to-cell signaling. We devised cell-based neurotransmitter fluorescent engineered reporters (CNiFERs) to address this challenge and monitor in situ neurotransmitter receptor activation. CNiFERs are cultured cells that are engineered to express a chosen metabotropic receptor, use the Gq protein–coupled receptor cascade to transform receptor activity into a rise in cytosolic [Ca2+] and report [Ca2+] with a genetically encoded fluorescent Ca2+ sensor. The initial realization of CNiFERs detected acetylcholine release via activation of M1 muscarinic receptors. We used chronic implantation of M1-CNiFERs in frontal cortex of the adult rat to elucidate the muscarinic action of the atypical neuroleptics clozapine and olanzapine. We found that these drugs potently inhibited in situ muscarinic receptor activity."

https://openalex.org/W2146723580,"Mammalian cochlea inner hair cells (IHCs) can code a continuous grading of sound intensities. This is because neurotransmitter release at mature sensory ribbon synapses is linearly dependent on calcium influx, which has the effect of broadening the cells' dynamic range. Immature IHC neurotransmitter release is quite different. Here, the authors show that a switch from syanptogamin I and II to synaptogamin IV underlies this developmental change. Mammalian cochlear inner hair cells (IHCs) are specialized for the dynamic coding of continuous and finely graded sound signals. This ability is largely conferred by the linear Ca2+ dependence of neurotransmitter release at their synapses, which is also a feature of visual and olfactory systems. The prevailing hypothesis is that linearity in IHCs occurs through a developmental change in the Ca2+ sensitivity of synaptic vesicle fusion from the nonlinear (high order) Ca2+ dependence of immature spiking cells. However, the nature of the Ca2+ sensor(s) of vesicle fusion at hair cell synapses is unknown. We found that synaptotagmin IV was essential for establishing the linear exocytotic Ca2+ dependence in adult rodent IHCs and immature outer hair cells. Moreover, the expression of the hitherto undetected synaptotagmins I and II correlated with a high-order Ca2+ dependence in IHCs. We propose that the differential expression of synaptotagmins determines the characteristic Ca2+ sensitivity of vesicle fusion at hair cell synapses."
https://openalex.org/W2169265654,"Drosophila mutants that have defective Shaker K+ channel or SLEEPLESS, a GPI-anchored protein of Ly-6/neurotoxin family, have very short sleep cycles. Here the authors show that SLEEPLESS binds to Shaker to regulate its localization, membrane excitability and homeostatic sleep drive. Sleep is a whole-organism phenomenon accompanied by global changes in neural activity. We previously identified SLEEPLESS (SSS) as a glycosylphosphatidyl inositol–anchored protein required for sleep in Drosophila. Here we found that SSS is critical for regulating the sleep-modulating potassium channel Shaker. SSS and Shaker shared similar expression patterns in the brain and specifically affected each other's expression levels. sleepless (sss) loss-of-function mutants exhibited altered Shaker localization, reduced Shaker current density and slower Shaker current kinetics. Transgenic expression of sss in sss mutants rescued defects in Shaker expression and activity cell-autonomously and suggested that SSS functions in wake-promoting, cholinergic neurons. In heterologous cells, SSS accelerated the kinetics of Shaker currents and was co-immunoprecipitated with Shaker, suggesting that SSS modulates Shaker activity via a direct interaction. SSS is predicted to belong to the Ly-6/neurotoxin superfamily, suggesting a mechanism for regulation of neuronal excitability by endogenous toxin-like molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2013165826,"Alanyl tRNA synthetases can sometimes bind a glycine or a serine, instead of alanine. This would cause mistranslation if a 'wrong' amino acid were then transferred from the synthetase active site onto a growing polypeptide chain. Guo et al. use crystal structures, mutant enzymes and kinetic analyses to discover why the enzyme has such a promiscuous specificity, and how this problem is overcome through the evolution of the editing protein, AlaXps. Alanyl-tRNA synthetases (AlaRSs) may confuse glycine or serine with alanine, potentially causing mistranslation and thus profound functional consequences, with serine posing a bigger challenge than glycine. AlaXps — free-standing, genome-encoded editing proteins — represent one editing checkpoint to prevent this from occurring. Nine crystal structures, together with kinetic and mutational analysis, now show how AlaXps solve the serine misactivation problem. Mistranslation arising from confusion of serine for alanine by alanyl-tRNA synthetases (AlaRSs) has profound functional consequences1,2,3. Throughout evolution, two editing checkpoints prevent disease-causing mistranslation from confusing glycine or serine for alanine at the active site of AlaRS. In both bacteria and mice, Ser poses a bigger challenge than Gly1,2. One checkpoint is the AlaRS editing centre, and the other is from widely distributed AlaXps—free-standing, genome-encoded editing proteins that clear Ser-tRNAAla. The paradox of misincorporating both a smaller (glycine) and a larger (serine) amino acid suggests a deep conflict for nature-designed AlaRS. Here we show the chemical basis for this conflict. Nine crystal structures, together with kinetic and mutational analysis, provided snapshots of adenylate formation for each amino acid. An inherent dilemma is posed by constraints of a structural design that pins down the α-amino group of the bound amino acid by using an acidic residue. This design, dating back more than 3 billion years, creates a serendipitous interaction with the serine OH that is difficult to avoid. Apparently because no better architecture for the recognition of alanine could be found, the serine misactivation problem was solved through free-standing AlaXps, which appeared contemporaneously with early AlaRSs. The results reveal unconventional problems and solutions arising from the historical design of the protein synthesis machinery."

Translocations within Igh involve DNA double-strand breaks initiated either by the RAG1/2 endonuclease during variable, diversity and joining gene segment (V(D)J) recombination, or by activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID, also known as AICDA) during class switch recombination (CSR). V(D)J recombination in progenitor B (pro-B) cells assembles Igh variable region exons upstream of mu constant region (Cmu) exons, which are the first of several sets of C(H) exons ('C(H) genes') within a C(H) locus that span several hundred kilobases (kb). In mature B cells, CSR deletes Cmu and replaces it with a downstream C(H) gene. An intronic enhancer (iEmu) between the variable region exons and Cmu promotes V(D)J recombination in developing B cells. Furthermore, the Igh 3' regulatory region (Igh3'RR) lies downstream of the C(H) locus and modulates CSR by long-range transcriptional enhancement of C(H) genes. Transgenic mice bearing iEmu or Igh3'RR sequences fused to c-myc are predisposed to B lymphomas, demonstrating that such elements can confer oncogenic c-myc expression. However, in many B-cell lymphomas, Igh-c-myc translocations delete iEmu and place c-myc up to 200 kb upstream of the Igh3'RR. Here we address the oncogenic role of the Igh3'RR by inactivating it in two distinct mouse models for B-cell lymphoma with Igh-c-myc translocations. We show that the Igh3'RR is dispensable for pro-B-cell lymphomas with V(D)J recombination-initiated translocations, but is required for peripheral B-cell lymphomas with CSR-associated translocations. As the Igh3'RR is not required for CSR-associated Igh breaks or Igh-c-myc translocations in peripheral B-cell lymphoma progenitors, we conclude that this regulatory region confers oncogenic activity by long-range and developmental stage-specific activation of translocated c-myc genes."
https://openalex.org/W2124248646,"The adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene product is mutated in the vast majority of human colorectal cancers. APC negatively regulates the WNT pathway by aiding in the degradation of beta-catenin, which is the transcription factor activated downstream of WNT signaling. APC mutations result in beta-catenin stabilization and constitutive WNT pathway activation, leading to aberrant cellular proliferation. APC mutations associated with colorectal cancer commonly fall in a region of the gene termed the mutation cluster region and result in expression of an N-terminal fragment of the APC protein. Biochemical and molecular studies have revealed localization of APC/Apc to different sub-cellular compartments and various proteins outside of the WNT pathway that associate with truncated APC/Apc. These observations and genotype-phenotype correlations have led to the suggestion that truncated APC bears neomorphic and/or dominant-negative function that support tumor development. To analyze this possibility, we have generated a novel allele of Apc in the mouse that yields complete loss of Apc protein. Our studies reveal that whole-gene deletion of Apc results in more rapid tumor development than the APC multiple intestinal neoplasia (Apc(Min)) truncation. Furthermore, we found that adenomas bearing truncated Apc had increased beta-catenin activity when compared with tumors lacking Apc protein, which could lead to context-dependent inhibition of tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2112841929,"In all eukaryotes, the ligation of newly synthesized DNA, also known as Okazaki fragments, is catalysed by DNA ligase I (ref. 1). An individual with a DNA ligase I deficiency exhibits growth retardation, sunlight sensitivity and severe immunosuppression, probably due to accumulation of DNA damage. Surprisingly, not much is known about the DNA damage response (DDR) in DNA ligase I-deficient cells. As DNA replication and DDR pathways are highly conserved in eukaryotes, we used Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model system to address this issue. We uncovered a new pathway, which facilitates ubiquitylation at Lys 107 of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Unlike ubiquitylation at Lys 164 of PCNA in response to UV irradiation, which triggers translesion synthesis, modification of Lys 107 is not dependent on the ubiquitin conjugating enzyme (E2) Rad6 (ref. 4) nor the ubiquitin ligase (E3) Rad18 (ref. 5), but requires the E2 variant Mms2 (ref. 6) in conjunction with Ubc4 (ref. 7) and the E3 Rad5 (Refs 8, 9). Surprisingly, DNA ligase I-deficient S. cerevisiae cdc9-1 cells that carry a PCNAK107R mutation are inviable, because they cannot activate a robust DDR. Furthermore, we show that ubiquitylation of PCNA in response to DNA ligase I deficiency is conserved in humans, yet the lysine residue that is modified remains to be determined. We propose that PCNA ubiquitylation provides a 'DNA damage code' that allows cells to categorize different types of defects that arise during DNA replication."
https://openalex.org/W2020031759,"The nonreceptor tyrosine kinases of the Src family (SFK) are frequently deregulated in human colorectal cancer (CRC), and they have been implicated in tumour growth and metastasis. How SFK are activated in this cancer has not been clearly established. Here, we show that the SFK-dependent invasion is induced by inactivation of the negative regulator C-terminal Src kinase, Csk. While the level of Csk was inconsistent with SFK activity in colon cancer cells, its membrane translocation, needed for efficient regulation of membrane-localized SFK activity, was impaired. Accordingly, Csk downregulation did not affect SFK oncogenic activity in these cells, whereas expression of a membrane-localized form of this kinase affected their invasive activity. Downregulation of the transmembrane and rafts-localized Csk-binding protein/phosphoprotein associated with glycosphingolipid-enriched microdomain (PAG), was instrumental for the cytoplasmic accumulation of Csk. Re-expression of PAG in cells from late-stage CRC inhibited SFK invasive activity in a Csk-dependent manner. Conversely, inactivation of its residual expression in early-stage CRC cells promoted SFK invasive activity. Finally, this mechanism was specific to CRC as Csk coupling to SFK was readily detected in breast cancer cells. Therefore, Csk mis-localization defines a novel mechanism for SFK oncogenic activation in CRC cells."

https://openalex.org/W2054980646,"The 16 kilobase (kb) heterochromatin domain between the chicken beta-globin locus and the folate receptor gene is used here to study the roles of RNA-dependent mechanisms and histone modifications in the maintenance of a constitutive heterochromatic structure. Inhibition of histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity is shown to both increase intergenic transcription and render the heterochromatin more accessible to MspI digestion. We show that short interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated downregulation of the enzyme Dicer has similar effects: histone acetylation is increased, transcript levels rise and the compact chromatin structure becomes more accessible to restriction endonucleases. We also show that the chicken Argonaute 2 homologue binds the 16 kb region in a Dicer-dependent manner and is necessary for a condensed chromatin structure. Heterochromatic domains of this kind, which are widely distributed in vertebrate genomes, thus seem to be maintained in their condensed form by highly conserved mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2026558676,"DNA copy number analysis was performed, using single-nucleotide polymorphism mapping arrays, to fine map genomic imbalances in human malignant mesothelioma (MM) cell lines derived from primary tumors. Chromosomal losses accounted for the majority of genomic imbalances. All 22 cell lines examined showed homozygous deletions of 9p21.3, centering at the CDKN2A/ARF and CDKN2B loci. Other commonly underrepresented segments included 1p36, 1p22, 3p21-22, 4q13, 4q34, 11q23, 13q12-13, 14q32, 15q15, 18q12, and 22q12, each observed in 55-90% of cell lines. Focal deletions of 11q23 encompassed the transcriptional repressor gene promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF), which was validated by analysis of genomic DNA using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Semi-quantitative RT-PCR and immunoblot analysis revealed that PLZF is greatly downregulated in MM cell lines compared with non-malignant mesothelial cells. Ectopic expression of PLZF in PLZF-deficient MM cells resulted in decreased cell viability, reduced colony formation, as well as increased apoptosis, the latter based on results of various cell death assays and the observation of increased cleavage of caspase 3, PARP, and Mcl-1. These data indicate that deletions of PLZF are a common occurrence in MM and that downregulation of PLZF may contribute to MM pathogenesis by promoting cell survival."
https://openalex.org/W2035984881,"Activation of Crtc1 (also known as Mect1/Torc1) by a t(11;19) chromosomal rearrangement underlies the etiology of malignant salivary gland tumors. As LKB1 is a target for mutational inactivation in lung cancer and was recently shown to regulate hepatic Crtc2/CREB transcriptional activity in mice, we now present evidence suggesting disruption of an LKB1/Crtc pathway in cancer. Although Crtc1 is preferentially expressed in adult brain tissues, we observed elevated levels of steady-state Crtc1 in thoracic tumors. In addition, we show that somatic loss of LKB1 is associated with underphosphorylation of endogenous Crtc1, enhanced Crtc1 nuclear localization and enhanced expression of the Crtc prototypic target gene, NR4A2/Nurr1. Inhibition of NR4A2 was associated with growth suppression of LKB1 null tumors, but showed little effect on LKB1-wildtype cells. These data strengthen the role of dysregulated Crtc as a bona fide cancer gene, present a new element to the complex LKB1 tumorigenic axis, and suggest that Crtc genes may be aberrantly activated in a wider range of common adult malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W1991620635,"ErbB2 amplification and overexpression in breast cancer correlates with aggressive disease and poor prognosis. To find novel ErbB2-interacting proteins, we used stable isotope labeling of amino acids in cell culture followed by peptide affinity pull-downs and identified specific binders using relative quantification by mass spectrometry. Copine-III, a member of a Ca2+-dependent phospholipid-binding protein family, was identified as binding to phosphorylated Tyr1248 of ErbB2. In breast cancer cells, Copine-III requires Ca2+ for binding to the plasma membrane, where it interacts with ErbB2 upon receptor stimulation, an interaction that is dependent on receptor activity. Copine-III also binds receptor of activated C kinase 1 and colocalizes with phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase at the leading edge of migrating cells. Importantly, knockdown of Copine-III in T47D breast cancer cells causes a decrease in Src kinase activation and ErbB2-dependent wound healing. Our data suggest that Copine-III is a novel player in the regulation of ErbB2-dependent cancer cell motility. In primary breast tumors, high CPNE3 RNA levels significantly correlate with ERBB2 amplification. Moreover, in an in situ tissue microarray analysis, we detected differential protein expression of Copine-III in normal versus breast, prostate and ovarian tumors, suggesting a more general role for Copine-III in carcinogenesis."
