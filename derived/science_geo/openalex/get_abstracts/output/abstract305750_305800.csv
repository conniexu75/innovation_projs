https://openalex.org/W1995986570,"The global temperature rose by 0.2 degrees C between the middle 1960's and 1980, yielding a warming of 0.4 degrees C in the past century. This temperature increase is consistent with the calculated greenhouse effect due to measured increases of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Variations of volcanic aerosols and possibly solar luminosity appear to be primary causes of observed fluctuations about the mean trend of increasing temperature. It is shown that the anthropogenic carbon dioxide warming should emerge from the noise level of natural climate variability by the end of the century, and there is a high probability of warming in the 1980's. Potential effects on climate in the 21st century include the creation of drought-prone regions in North America and central Asia as part of a shifting of climatic zones, erosion of the West Antarctic ice sheet with a consequent worldwide rise in sea level, and opening of the fabled Northwest Passage."
https://openalex.org/W2000146957,"A circumstellar disk has been observed optically around the fourth-magnitude star beta Pictoris. First detected in the infrared by the Infrared Astronomy Satellite last year, the disk is seen to extend to more than 400 astronomical units from the star, or more than twice the distance measured in the infrared by the Infrared Astronomy Satellite. The beta Pictoris disk is presented to Earth almost edgeon and is composed of solid particles in nearly coplanar orbits. The observed change in surface brightness with distance from the star implies that the mass density of the disk falls off with approximately the third power of the radius. Because the circumstellar material is in the form of a highly flattened disk rather than a spherical shell, it is presumed to be associated with planet formation. It seems likely that the system is relatively young and that planet formation either is occurring now around beta Pictoris or has recently been completed."
https://openalex.org/W2006028711,"Observed long-term changes in glacier volume and hydrometeorological mass balance models yield data on the transfer of water from glaciers, excluding those in Greenland and Antarctica, to the oceans. The average observed volume change for the period 1900 to 1961 is scaled to a global average by use of the seasonal amplitude of the mass balance. These data are used to calibrate the models to estimate the changing contribution of glaciers to sea level for the period 1884 to 1975. Although the error band is large, these glaciers appear to account for a third to half of observed rise in sea level, approximately that fraction not explained by thermal expansion of the ocean."
https://openalex.org/W2151322148,"The current (synthetic) theory of evolution has been criticized on the grounds that it implies that macroevolutionary processes (speciation and morphological diversification) are gradual. The extent to which macroevolution is gradual or punctuational remains to be ascertained. Macroevolutionary processes are underlain by microevolutionary phenomena and are compatible with the synthetic theory of evolution. But microevolutionary principles are compatible with both gradualism and punctualism; therefore, logically they entail neither. Thus, macroevolution and microevolution are decoupled in the important sense that macroevolutionary patterns cannot be deduced from microevolutionary principles."
https://openalex.org/W1970816217,"For several species of plants the abundance of those transcripts encoding the chlorophyll a/b binding protein (cab RNA) and the small subunit of ribulose-1,5-biphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (rbcS RNA) has been established as being under the control of phytochrome. However, this conclusion does not take into account the various types of phytochrome control based on both the fluence of red light necessary to induce the response and the ability of far red light either to induce or to reverse the response. The fluence of red light necessary to induce the accumulation of rbcS RNA was found to be 10,000 times greater than that necessary to induce the accumulation of cab RNA. Furthermore, far red light alone was capable of inducing the accumulation of cab RNA. It is possible, therefore, that developing pea buds accumulate cab RNA before rbcS and that cab RNA is not subject to the normal end-of-day signals affecting many phytochrome responses."
https://openalex.org/W2038889610,"Nuclear tracks have been identified in interplanetary dust particles (IDP's) collected from the stratosphere. The presence of tracks unambiguously confirms the extraterrestrial nature of IDP's, and the high track densities (10(10) to 10(11) per square centimeter) suggest an exposure age of approximately 10(4) years within the inner solar system. Tracks also provide an upper temperature limit for the heating of IDP's during atmospheric entry, thereby making it possible to distinguish between pristine and thermally modified micrometeorites."
https://openalex.org/W2080716693,"Time-series analysis reveals two dominant, stable long-term periodicities approximately equal to 33 +/- 3 and 260 +/- 25 million years in the known series of geological and biological upheavals during the Phanerozoic Eon. Because the cycles of these episodes agree in period and phase with the cycles of impact cratering on Earth, these results suggest that periodic comet impacts strongly influence global tectonism and biological evolution. These two periodicities could arise from interactions of the solar system with interstellar clouds as the solar system moves cyclically through the Galaxy."
https://openalex.org/W1974437252,"Deep-sea hydrothermal vent communities exhibit an array of reproductive strategies. Although a few vent species undergo planktotrophic, high-dispersal modes of development, most exhibit relatively low dispersal, but probably free-swimming nonplanktotrophic development. This predominance of nonplanktotrophy may be largely a reflection of phylogenetic constraints on the vent colonizing taxa; intervent dispersal among these forms may be facilitated by reduced developmental rates in the cold abyssal waters away from the vents. It is proposed that for those vent species with nonplanktotrophic development, larval dispersal is a stepwise process with oceanic ridge axes serving as discrete dispersal corridors."

https://openalex.org/W1990895635,"Labeling studies of the eastern spruce budworm in vivo indicate that trans-11-tetradecenyl acetate is synthesized specifically in the pheromone-producing gland and is degraded in concert with pheromone release; hence it may be a precursor to the trans-11-tetradecenal pheromone. Radioactivity from exogenously added labeled fatty acids did not appear to be directly incorporated into the ester, suggesting that de novo biosynthesis from acetate is the major route of ester biosynthesis. Conversion of the acetate ester to alcohol and aldehyde functional groups may be the principal method of regulating pheromone specificity between species of Choristoneura."

https://openalex.org/W2008140816,"Interaction mean free paths are calculated for projectile fragments from relativistic heavy-ion interactions in emulsions and plastic. There are important discrepancies between emulsion results and those from other techniques. ""Anomalous"" secondaries (anomalons) may prove to be interpretable by conventional nuclear physics: short mean free paths may be due to convoys of collinear light fragments from peripheral interactions (for example, with neutrons) or from low-excitation particle-unbound fragments that decay in flight."

Ways in which the nation's space science program may evolve in response to these developments are described."

https://openalex.org/W2081740003,"In reassessing the role of government, many Americans have agreed that public expenditures should be curtailed. Although our universities must bear their full share of the sacrifices, some of the Administration's recent proposals would be to the detriment of the country. Drastic cuts in student aid, for example, will not encourage young people to seek the best possible education and training; reductions in federal funds for scientific instruments and facilities will mean that our laboratories will deteriorate, our accomplishments will be fewer. The success of American science has depended heavily on the talent that came from Europe at the time of World War II. Today that source has largely disappeared, and if we cannot replace it with exceptional young investigators of our own, the quality of our universities and the vitality of our science will diminish."
