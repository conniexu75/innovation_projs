https://openalex.org/W2109567227,"Dental enamel is the hardest tissue in the body and cannot be replaced or repaired, because the enamel secreting cells are lost at tooth eruption. X-linked amelogenesis imperfecta (MIM 301200), a phenotypically diverse hereditary disorder affecting enamel development, is caused by deletions or point mutations in the human X-chromosomal amelogenin gene. Although the precise functions of the amelogenin proteins in enamel formation are not well defined, these proteins constitute 90% of the enamel organic matrix. We have disrupted the amelogenin locus to generate amelogenin null mice, which display distinctly abnormal teeth as early as 2 weeks of age with chalky-white discoloration. Microradiography revealed broken tips of incisors and molars and scanning electron microscopy analysis indicated disorganized hypoplastic enamel. The amelogenin null phenotype reveals that the amelogenins are apparently not required for initiation of mineral crystal formation but rather for the organization of crystal pattern and regulation of enamel thickness. These null mice will be useful for understanding the functions of amelogenin proteins during enamel formation and for developing therapeutic approaches for treating this developmental defect that affects the enamel."

Isolated perfused adult rabbit hearts subjected to global ischemia and reperfusion were studied. Calpain or a calpain-like activity was activated within 15 min after reperfusion, and preconditioning suppressed calpain activation. In contrast, caspase activation was not detected although cytochromec was released after ischemia and reperfusion. The pro-apoptotic BH3-only Bcl-2 family member, Bid, was cleaved during ischemia/reperfusion in the adult rabbit heart. Recombinant Bid was cleaved by calpain to a fragment that was able to mediate cytochromec release. The calpain cleavage site was mapped to a region within Bid that is extremely susceptible to proteolysis. These findings suggest that there is cross-talk between apoptotic and necrotic pathways in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury.

Prevention of calcium influx is widely recognized in order to protect the myocardium. Preconditioning, in which a brief period of ischemia and reperfusion confers protection against a longer episode of ischemia, preserves tissue viability through attenuation of ionic fluxes (notably protons and calcium), preservation of energy charge (less consumption of ATP), and a variety of less well characterized enzymatic alterations (1Finegan B.A. Lopaschuk G.D.

Calpain has been implicated as a mediator of contractile dysfunction during ischemic injury, in part because of proteolysis of structural proteins (7Gao W.D. Liu Y. Mellgren R. Marban E. Circ.

In addition, calpain has been reported to cleave Bax to an 18-kDa fragment that mediates cytochrome crelease (9Gao G. Dou Q.P. J. Cell.

Caspase activation in ischemic and reperfused rat heart has been reported using an antibody that recognizes a neoepitope in activated caspase-3 (18Black S.C. Huang J.Q. Rezaiefar P. Radinovic S.

In this study we report that calpain is activated shortly after ischemia/reperfusion and that preconditioning attenuates calpain activation. In addition, we demonstrate a connection between calpain and mitochondrial dysfunction mediated by Bid. Male New Zealand White rabbits (2.0–2.5 kg) were anesthetized and a midsternal thoracotomy was performed. The heart was rapidly excised and mounted onto a Langendorff heart perfusion apparatus using a protocol adapted from Tsuchida et al. (21Tsuchida A. Liu Y. Liu G.S. Cohen M.V. Downey J.M. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 576-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The heart was perfused at a constant pressure of 60 mm Hg with Krebs-Ringer buffer consisting of (in mmol/liter) NaCl (118), KCl (4.75), KH2PO4(1.18), MgSO4·7H2O (1.18), CaCl2·2H2O (2.5), NaHCO3 (25Di Lisa F. Bernardi P. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 184: 379-391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and glucose (11Nakagawa T. Yuan J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 887-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). The perfusate was bubbled with a mixture of 95% O2 and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Perfused hearts were stabilized for 15 min and then subjected to global ischemia for 30 min by turning off the perfusion system. After 30 min of ischemia, the perfusion system was restarted, and the hearts were reperfused for up to 90 min. Ischemic preconditioning was induced by three 5-min cycles of no-flow ischemia and reperfusion immediately preceding the regular ischemia and reperfusion. The efficacy of these interventions was verified by measurement of creatine kinase release (Sigma Chemicals) and infarct size measurement using triphenyl tetrazolium staining. 2J. M. Downey, www.usouthal.edu/ishr/help/ttc/2000. All animal procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of The Scripps Research Institute. At the end of perfusion, the ventricles were minced in 20 ml per heart of ice-cold MSE buffer (225 mm mannitol, 75 mmsucrose, 1.0 mm EGTA, 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4). The heart was further homogenized for 5 s at maximal power output by PowerGen 125 (Fisher Scientific) equipped with a 10-mm diameter rotor knife. The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 600 ×g to remove unbroken tissue and nuclei. The supernatant was centrifuged twice for 10 min at 10,000 × g. The postmitochondrial supernatant generally contains about 15 mg protein/ml. The 10,000 × g mitochondrial pellet was washed twice and resuspended in MSE buffer. The supernatant (crude cytosol) was further centrifuged for 30 min at 100,000 ×g to obtain particulate-free cytosol (S100) used for all further experiments. The 10,000 × g pellet from the previous centrifugation was resuspended in 10 ml of MSE buffer and centrifuged for 10 min at 8,000 × g. This wash step was repeated once. The final pellet of mitochondria was resuspended in 3 ml of MSE buffer, and the aliquots were stored at −80 °C. All operations were carried out on ice or at 4 °C. Jurkat cell cells were disrupted by nitrogen cavitation and cytosol and mitochondria were prepared as previously described (23Gottlieb R.A. Adachi S. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 322: 213-221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Calpain activity was measured using 50 µm Suc-Leu-Tyr-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (Suc-Leu-Tyr-AMC) as the substrate (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA). Cytosol (20 µl = 100 µg of protein) was added to a 100-µl reaction buffer (145 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3). AMC release was measured over 1 h at room temperature by fluorimetry (Molecular Devices) using 360-nm excitation and 430-nm emission filters. Standard curves were generated for each experiment using known concentrations of AMC. Calpain activity was expressed as nmol AMC released/min/mg protein. All measurements were made in triplicate and repeated with extracts from hearts in two independent experiments. Recombinant GST-Bid (1 µg) was added to cytosol containing cardiac lysate (200 µg), recombinant caspase-8 (Pharmingen), or calpain I (Calbiochem) (1 µg) as specified and incubated for 1 h at 30 °C. The reaction mixtures were boiled in sample buffer, resolved by electrophoresis on 16% polyacrylamide gels (Novex), and detected by immunoblotting. GST-Bid (50 ng) and calpain I (1 µg) were added to a 10-µl reaction buffer consisting of 300 mm sucrose, 20 mm MOPS, 1 mmEGTA, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4 in the presence of 2 mm Ca2+. After 1 h incubation at 30 °C, 4 mm EDTA was added to chelate Ca2+. Mitochondria (100 µg of protein) prepared from Jurkat cells by nitrogen cavitation were added to the reaction mixture and further incubated for 10 min at 30 °C. Mitochondria were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant and pellet were assessed by immunoblotting for cytochromec. The concentration of GST-Bid used in these assays was determined by titration to be insufficient to induce cytochromec release without proteolytic activation. Samples containing equal amounts of protein were subjected to electrophoresis on 4–20% gradient polyacrylamide gels (Novex) and then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore Corp). After blocking in 5% nonfat milk and 0.05% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline, blots were incubated with antibodies to cytochrome c (Pharmingen) and Bid and a signal amplification system (Vector Labs). Polyclonal anti-Bid antiserum was generated in rabbits using as immunogen NH2-CSDNSFRRELDALGHELPVLAPQ-amide peptide corresponding to residues 28–50 of huBid and coupled via the N-terminal cysteine residue to maleimide-activated ovalbumin (OVA) (Pierce, Inc.). New Zealand White female rabbits were injected subcutaneously with a mixture of 0.25 ml of OVA-peptide (1 mg/ml) and 0.5 ml of Freund's complete adjuvant (dose divided over 10 injections sites) and then boosted 3 times at weekly intervals followed by another 3–20 boosts at monthly intervals with 0.25 mg of OVA-peptide in Freund's incomplete adjuvant, before collecting blood and obtaining immune serum. The Bid antibody was used at a dilution of 1:1000. We utilized a model of global ischemia in the isolated buffer-perfused rabbit hearts to evaluate biochemical events of cell death. We established that ischemic preconditioning, consisting of 3 cycles of 5 min of no-flow ischemia and 5 min of recovery, was able to protect the heart against a 30-min ischemic episode followed by reperfusion, as measured by creatine kinase release and reduction of infarct size (Fig. 1). We used this model to determine early events in the cell death pathway initiated by ischemia and to examine whether preconditioning would modulate those events. At the time of reperfusion, intracellular calcium levels rise steeply (24Ferrari R. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1996; 28 Suppl. 1: S1-10PubMed Google Scholar, 25Di Lisa F. Bernardi P. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 184: 379-391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Preconditioning has been shown to attenuate calcium elevations (5Steenbergen C. Perlman M.E. London R.E. Murphy E. Circ. Res. 1993; 72: 112-125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and measures that prevent calcium influx have also been shown to be cardioprotective (5Steenbergen C. Perlman M.E. London R.E. Murphy E. Circ. Res. 1993; 72: 112-125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Calpain is a cysteine protease that undergoes autocatalytic processing in the presence of calcium, which thus renders it independent of calcium. Calpains are also negatively regulated by calpastatin. In the heart, a calpastatin homolog high-molecular-weight calmodulin-binding protein (HMWCaMBP) has been shown to undergo proteolysis by calpains during ischemia/reperfusion, resulting in diminished calpain inhibitory activity (26Kakkar R. Wang X. Radhi J.M. Rajala R.V. Wang R. Sharma R.K. Cell Calcium. 2001; 29: 59-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 27Kakkar R. Radhi J.M. Rajala R.V. Sharma R.K. J. Pathol. 2000; 191: 208-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Consistent with many earlier reports, we found that calcium-independent calpain or calpain-like activity could be detected in lysates from ischemic but not control hearts after 15 min of reperfusion (Fig.2). Preconditioning attenuated calpain activity, suggesting that calpain may be an important determinant of myocardial injury. Additional evidence that calpain is active at this early time point is reflected in the cleavage of α-spectrin in ischemic lysates (Fig. 2, inset). In contrast to the strong activation of calpain at this early time point, we could not detect any evidence of caspase activation. DEVD-AMC cleavage revealed no caspase activity, although latent caspase-3-like activity could be revealed by the addition of catalytic amounts of Granzyme B (Fig. 3). Immunoblotting for caspase-9 and caspase-3 also failed to demonstrate proteolytic processing after 15 and 90 min reperfusion (data not shown). However, the amount of cytochrome c was increased in cytosol of hearts subjected to 30 min of ischemia and 15 min of reperfusion (Fig.4).Figure 4Cytochrome c release from mitochondria. Cytochrome c is released into the cytosol after ischemia and 15 min of reperfusion (I/R). Some cytochrome c is released even in control hearts (C), presumably a reflection of unavoidable mitochondrial disruption during Polytron homogenization.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We considered that calpain might interact with apoptotic pathways in ischemia. Bid, a BH3-only member of the Bcl-2 family, is capable of mediating cytochrome c release and is expressed in heart. Bid is cleaved by caspase-8 to generate a truncated fragment, tBid, which is capable of translocating to the mitochondria and mediating cytochrome c release. Accordingly, we examined whether calpain could cleave Bid. As shown in Fig.5, recombinant GST-Bid was cleaved by caspase-8 or calpain I. GST-Bid cleavage by calpain gave rise to fragments that were similar in size but not identical to those generated by caspase-8 (Fig. 5). Sequencing of the amino terminus of the fragment that differed in size from the caspase-8 fragments yielded the sequence RIEA, which lies within the “bait loop” that has been shown to be the region of cleavage by caspase-8, lysosomal proteases, and granzyme B (Table I) (28Stoka V. Turk B. Schendel S.L. Kim T.H. Cirman T. Snipas S.J. Ellerby L.M. Bredesen D. Freeze H. Abrahamson M. Bromme D. Krajewski S. Reed J.C. Yin X.M. Turk V. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol.

Cleavage sites by caspase-8, Granzyme B, and lysosomal proteases are underlined. However, it was necessary to establish whether the calpain-cleaved Bid fragments were capable of mediating cytochrome c release. We determined the concentration of recombinant GST-Bid that was unable to cause cytochrome c release without prior proteolytic cleavage (data not shown). This concentration of GST-Bid was then incubated with buffer, caspase-8, or calpain I in the presence of mitochondria. After 10 min at 37 °C, the supernatant and pellet were assessed for cytochrome c release. We found that recombinant calpain was able to cleave GST-Bid to fragments that were capable of mediating cytochrome c release (Fig.6). This effect could be blocked by the early addition of ALLN (Fig. 6, lane 4). Calpain alone did not cause cytochrome c release (not shown). Consistent with the observation that calpain-like activity is increased with ischemia/reperfusion and with the demonstration that calpain could cleave Bid in vitro to an active fragment, we were able to detect proteolytic processing of Bid in cytosol from hearts subjected to global ischemia and reperfusion (Fig.7). The size of the processed fragments corresponded closely to that observed in vitro for calpain-mediated cleavage. Thus, calpain-mediated processing of Bid may be responsible for cytochrome c release and subsequent mitochondrial dysfunction. Ischemia and reperfusion are associated with calpain activation, a finding that has been reported by many other groups. Recent interest has focused on biochemical pathways of apoptosis, and caspase activation has been reported to occur in ischemic and reperfused rat hearts (18Black S.C. Huang J.Q. Rezaiefar P. Radinovic S. Eberhart A. Nicholson D.W. Rodger I.W. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1998; 30: 733-742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In these studies, we focused on early time points, because the commitment to cell death is made quite early. We were unable to detect caspase activation at these early time points. However, calpain activity was apparent as early as 15 min of reperfusion, and calcium-independent calpain activity was attenuated in preconditioned hearts. This observation underscores the importance of calpain in ischemic injury. Calpain exists as an inactive proenzyme consisting of 80-kDa and 29-kDa subunits, which undergo autolytic processing in the presence of calcium to 78-kDa and 18-kDa fragments, thereby greatly diminishing their requirement for calcium (reviewed in Ref. 29Wang K.K. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 59Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Calpain is further regulated by association with an inhibitor, calpastatin, which can be degraded by calpain. Recently it was reported that calpastatin immunoreactivity and inhibitory activity was diminished in ischemic heart tissue (26Kakkar R. Wang X. Radhi J.M. Rajala R.V. Wang R. Sharma R.K. Cell Calcium. 2001; 29: 59-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 27Kakkar R. Radhi J.M. Rajala R.V. Sharma R.K. J. Pathol. 2000; 191: 208-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). It has already been shown that reperfusion is associated with a brisk drop in intracellular pH and an associated rise in calcium. Preconditioning suppresses these ionic alterations and would therefore be expected to attenuate calpain activation, as we have observed (3Gottlieb R.A. Gruol D.L. Zhu J.Y. Engler R.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2391-2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 6Karwatowska-Prokopczuk E. Nordberg J. Li H.L. Engler R.L. Gottlieb R.A. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 1139-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that in vitro, calpain could cleave recombinant human Bid at a site that is consistent with the consensus site for calpain, which is characterized by Leu, Val, or Ile in the P2 position. However, the Leu is not conserved between mouse and human Bid, and it remains to be established whether Bid is generally a calpain substrate. The sequence of Bid in rabbits is not known. The site of cleavage lies within the “bait loop” between helix 2 and helix 3, which by virtue of its low-order structure is readily accessible to proteases. As suggested by Salvesen (28Stoka V. Turk B. Schendel S.L. Kim T.H. Cirman T. Snipas S.J. Ellerby L.M. Bredesen D. Freeze H. Abrahamson M. Bromme D. Krajewski S. Reed J.C. Yin X.M. Turk V. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 3149-3157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar), Bid may serve as a general sensor of intracellular protease activation. Calpain has also been shown to cleave Bax to an 18-kDa fragment that is better able to bind to mitochondria and cause cytochrome c release (9Gao G. Dou Q.P. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 80: 53-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 10Wood D.E. Newcomb E.W Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) and can also cleave Bcl-xL to a pro-apoptotic fragment (11Nakagawa T. Yuan J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 887-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). Cross-talk between necrotic (calpain) and apoptotic (caspase) pathways is complex. Calpain cleaves caspase-9 and -3, rendering them inactive. In contrast, calpain has been suggested to cleave and activate caspase-12 (11Nakagawa T. Yuan J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 887-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar, 30Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N. Li E. Xu J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2952) Google Scholar). We show that calpain is able to cleave Bid to its active form, leading to cytochrome c release from mitochondria. Regardless of whether cytochrome c serves to activate downstream caspases in the heart, the loss of cytochrome c from mitochondria is likely to impair respiration. Release of additional resident proteins of the intermembrane space, including AIF, SMAC, and CIDE-B may contribute to apoptosis (31Susin S.A. Lorenzo H.K. Zamzami N. Marzo I. Snow B.E. Brothers G.M.

Loss of mitochondrial metabolites such as NADH and enzymes such as creatine kinase will additionally impair ATP production by both mitochondria and glycolysis (35Di Lisa F. Menabo R. Canton M. Barile M. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 2571-2575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, cytochrome c-dependent respiration has been shown to be impaired in mitochondria from ischemic and reperfused hearts (36Borutaite V. Mildaziene V. Brown G.C. Brand M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1272: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 37Duan J.M. Karmazyn M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1989; 90: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Moreover, cytochrome crelease has been recognized to be a feature of ischemic injury for over two decades (38Kahles H. Goring G.G. Nordbeck H. Preusse C.J. Spieckermann P.G. Basic Res. Cardiol. 1977; 72: 563-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 39Toleikis A. Adv. Myocardiol. 1983; 4: 409-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Whereas Bid, a death-promoting member of the Bcl-2 family, has been recognized to be an important signal intermediate in some forms of apoptosis, its role in myocardial cell death (necrosis or apoptosis) has not been examined. Bcl-2 overexpression has been shown to protect against some necrotic insults (40Tsujimoto Y. Shimizu S. Eguchi Y. Kamiike W. Matsuda H. Leukemia. 1997; 11 Suppl. 3: 380-382PubMed Google Scholar), perhaps through its ability to antagonize the action of Bid. However, it remains to be shown whether Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL is able to bind and antagonize Bid generated by calpain proteolysis. These findings link calcium influx and calpain activation to the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. The proposed pathway to cell death in ischemic heart is shown in Fig. 8. Taken together, these findings implicate calpain cleavage of Bid as a point of cross-talk between ionic disturbances and apoptosis in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury.

https://openalex.org/W2064057102,"A role for aquaporins (AQPs) in hearing has been suggested from the specific expression of aquaporins in inner ear and the need for precise volume regulation in epithelial cells involved in acoustic signal transduction. Using mice deficient in selected aquaporins as controls, we localized AQP1 in fibrocytes in the spiral ligament and AQP4 in supporting epithelial cells (Hensen's, Claudius, and inner sulcus cells) in the organ of Corti. To determine whether aquaporins play a role in hearing, auditory brain stem response (ABR) thresholds were compared in wild-type mice and transgenic null mice lacking (individually) AQP1, AQP3, AQP4, and AQP5. In 4–5-week-old mice in a CD1 genetic background, ABR thresholds in response to a click stimulus were remarkably increased by >12 db in AQP4 null mice compared with wild-type mice (p < 0.001), whereas ABR thresholds were not affected by AQP1, AQP3, or AQP5 deletion. In a C57/bl6 background, nearly all AQP4 null mice were deaf, whereas ABRs could be elicited in wild-type controls. ABRs in AQP4 null CD1 mice measured in response to tone bursts (4–20 kHz) indicated a frequency-independent hearing deficit. Light microscopy showed no differences in cochlear morphology of wild-type versus AQP4 null mice. These results provide the first direct evidence that an aquaporin water channel plays a role in hearing. AQP4 may facilitate rapid osmotic equilibration in epithelial cells in the organ of Corti, which are subject to large K+ fluxes during mechano-electric signal transduction.

Phenotype analysis of mice lacking aquaporins has indicated that they play a physiological role in the kidney, central nervous system, gastrointestinal system, and exocrine glands (reviewed in Ref. 1Verkman A.S. Yang B. Song Y. Manley G.T. Ma T. Exp. Physiol. 2000; 85 (suppl.): 233S-241SCrossref Google Scholar). Mice lacking AQP1, AQP2, or AQP3 manifest nephrogenic diabetes insipidus with defective urinary concentrating ability (2Ma T. Yang B. Gillespie A. Carlson E.J. Epstein C.J. Verkman A.S. J. Biol.

Ma T. Noshita N. Filiz F. Bollen A. Chan P. Verkman A.S. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar), and mice lacking AQP5 have defective saliva secretion (6Ma T. Song Y. Gillespie A. Carlson E.J. Epstein C.J. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20071-20074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). In humans, mutations in AQP2 cause the autosomal form of hereditary nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (7Deen P.M. Verkijk M.A. Knoers N.V. Wieringa B. Monnens L.A. Van Os C.H. Van Oost B.A. Science. 1994; 264: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). Phenotype studies have also shown the tissue-specific expression of an aquaporin does not prove its physiological importance. For example, mice lacking AQP4 in gastric parietal cells and skeletal muscle have unimpaired stomach acid secretion (8Wang K.S. Komar A.R. Ma T. Filiz F. McLeroy J. Hoda K. Verkman A.S. Bastidas J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G448-G453PubMed Google Scholar) and skeletal muscle function (9Yang B. Verbavatz J.M. Song Y. Manley G.T. Vetrivel L. Kao W.M. Ma T. Verkman A.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C1008-C1115Crossref Google Scholar). The data from aquaporin null mice suggest that aquaporins are functionally important in tissues carrying out rapid near isosmolar fluid transport or passive water transport driven by osmotic gradients (1Verkman A.S. Yang B. Song Y. Manley G.T. Ma T. Exp. Physiol. 2000; 85 (suppl.): 233S-241SCrossref Google Scholar). Several aquaporins have been localized in the mammalian inner ear and have been proposed to play a role in hearing. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis of dissected rat inner ear showed diffuse AQP1 transcript expression, specific expression of AQP2, AQP3, and AQP4 in the endolymphatic sac, and expression of AQP5 in the organ of Corti and Reissner's membrane (10Beitz E. Kumagame H. Krippeit-Drews P. Ruppersberg J.P. Schultz J.E. Hear. Res. 1999; 132: 76-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). AQP1 was immunolocalized in guinea pig inner ear in fibrocytes near the bone and lining the endolymphatic duct and sac (11Stankovic K.M. Adams J.C. Brown D. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1450-C1456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Takumi et al. (12Takumi Y. Nagelhus E.A. Eidet J. Matsubara A. Usami S. Shinkawa H. Nielsen S. Ottersen O.P. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 3584-3595Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) found only AQP1 and AQP4 in rat inner ear by immunostaining, with AQP4 localized to the basolateral membrane of Hensen's cells and basal plasma membranes of Claudius cells and inner sulcus cells. Similar findings were reported by Minami et al. (13Minami, Y., Shimada, S., Miyahara, H., Matsunaga, T., and Tohyama, M.Acta Otolaryngol. Suppl. (Stockh.)533, 19–21.Google Scholar). In one study AQP5 was immunolocalized in cells lining the lateral wall of rat cochlear duct, including the external sulcus and spiral prominence (14Mhatre A.N. Steinbach S. Hribar K. Hoque A.T. Lalwani A.K. Biochim. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Although there is some disagreement among these expression studies, it appears that several aquaporins are expressed in the inner ear and thus might participate directly or indirectly in hearing. Recently, Belyantseva et al. (15Belyantseva I.A. Frolenkov G.I. Wade J.B. Mammano F. Kachar B. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8996-9003Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that water permeability in isolated rat cochlear outer hair cells increased at 8–12 days after birth, corresponding in time to the onset of hearing. Taken together with evidence that precise cochlear cell volume regulation is critical to mechano-electric signal transduction (16Patuzzi R. Dallas P. Popper A.N. Fay R.R. The Cochlea. Springer-Verlag, New York1996: 186-257Google Scholar), it has been suggested without direct evidence that aquaporins play an important role in hearing. However, hearing impairment in humans is not associated with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus caused by mutations in AQP2 or in reportedly asymptomatic humans lacking AQP1 (17Preston G.M. Smith B.L. Zeidel M.L. Moulds J.J. Agre P. Science. 1994; 265: 1585-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The purpose of this study was to investigate the functional role of aquaporins in hearing. The strategy was to compare auditory brain stem response (ABR) signals in mice lacking each of the inner ear aquaporins. We found remarkable hearing impairment in mice lacking AQP4 without anatomical abnormalities. The data provide the first direct evidence for a role of an aquaporin in hearing, raising the possibility that AQP4 may be involved in some forms of hearing impairment and that modulation of AQP4 function in inner ear may be of therapeutic value. Transgenic knockout mice deficient in AQP1, AQP3, AQP4, and AQP5 (individually) in a CD1 genetic background were generated by targeted gene disruption as described previously (2Ma T. Yang B.

Invest. 1997; 100: 957-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Measurements were done in litter-matched wild-type and knockout mice produced by intercrossing of heterozygous mice. For experiments in an inbred strain, the AQP4 null genotype was transferred to the C57/bl6 background by >8 back-crosses. For ABR measurements the investigators were blinded to genotype information until completion of the analysis. Protocols were approved by the University of California, San Francisco Committee on Animal Research. ABR measurements were performed using a Biopac MP100 work station equipped with differential amplifier (ERS100B) and stimulator (STM100A) modules. Mice were anesthetized with ketamine (80 mg/kg) and xylazine (14 mg/kg) by intraperitoneal injection. Rectal temperature was monitored continuously using a digital thermistor and maintained at 36–38 °C using a heating block. Mice were placed in a grounded Faraday cage contained in a light-proof sound isolation box. The three recording electrodes and speaker input cables entered a small hole in the box. Biaural sound stimuli were produced by a broad band speaker (Realistic, Model 40-1310B) positioned 30 cm from the mice. Click stimuli were generated by a square pulse of 0.1-ms duration and specified amplitude. Tone stimuli were generated using a frequency synthesizer and home-built waveform modulator to give a trapezoidal waveform with 1-ms rise/fall times and 2-ms flat segment. Sound intensity calibrations were done using a model C550H measurement microphone (Josephon Engineering) positioned at the location of the mouse head. For recording, subdermal stainless steel needle electrodes were placed at the vertex and ventrolateral to the left and right ears. ABR waveforms were recorded for 10 ms at a sampling rate of 45,000 Hz using 100–3000 Hz bandpass filter settings. Generally, waveforms from 200 stimuli at a frequency of 12 Hz were averaged. ABR waveforms were recorded in 10-db intervals down from a maximum amplitude of 90 db (for click stimuli) until no waveform could be visualized. Waveforms were stored for off-line analysis. Samples were fixed by intracardiac perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4). The temporal bone was removed, and the cochlea was post-fixed overnight in the same fixative solution. After decalcification, the cochlea was dehydrated and embedded in Tissue-Tek OCT compound for cryostat sections and in glycol methacrylate for plastic sections. For histological examination, the cochlea was infiltrated with JB-4 monomer (Polyscience Inc.), embedded under vacuum at room temperature, sectioned on a microtome (Sorvall), and stained with toluidine blue. For immunocytochemistry, 3–4-µm thick cryostat sections were incubated for 30 min with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and then with affinity-purified aquaporin antibodies (dilution 1:400–1500) for 2 h at 23 °C in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Slides were rinsed with 2.7% NaC1 and then with PBS and incubated with a secondary Cy3-conjugated sheep anti-rabbit F(ab)2fragment (1:200) for visualization by fluorescence microscopy. Data are reported as the mean ± S.E. with p values determined by analysis of variance. Aquaporin localization in the organ of Corti in the inner ears of four sets of mice was done by immunostaining using specific antibodies (Fig. 1). The AQP1 antibody strongly labeled non-epithelial cells (fibrocytes) in the spiral ligament of wild-type mice (top left) with no labeling in AQP1 null mice (top right). The AQP4 antibody labeled supporting Hensen's cells, inner sulcus cells, and Claudius cells in wild-type mice (middle left) but not in AQP4 null mice (middle right). No immunostaining with AQP5 antibody was found (bottom left and right), despite strong label of other tissues known to express AQP5 such as salivary gland (inset). Immunostaining of AQP2 and AQP3 was negative, with strongly positive controls (mouse kidney, not shown). Hearing was evaluated functionally in wild-type and aquaporin null mice of age 4–5 weeks by ABR analysis. Fig. 2shows representative ABR waveforms in response to click stimuli of different intensities. As reported in other ABR studies in mice (19Zheng Q.Y. Johnson K.R. Erway L.C. Hear. Res. 1999; 130: 94-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar), at least four distinct peaks were identified corresponding to cochlear nerve activity (wave I) and downstream neural activity (waves II–IV). Decreasing click intensities resulted in a decrease in wave amplitudes. As generally defined, the ABR threshold was identified in each series of ABR waveforms as the lowest click intensity that produced at least two clearly visible waves. ABR thresholds for the data in Fig. 2 were 40 db (wild-type mouse) and 50 db (AQP4 null mouse). Control studies indicated that ABR thresholds were very reproducible in the same mice measured on different days, with identical ABR thresholds in ∼80% of mice and 5 db changes in most remaining mice. Fig. 3 summarizes ABR thresholds measured in a large series of wild-type and aquaporin null mice. Although typical variability was found in different mice in the outbred CD1 genetic background, there was a significantly increased ABR threshold in AQP4 null mice by >12 db (p < 0.001). ABR thresholds in mice lacking AQP1, AQP3, or AQP5 did not differ significantly from that in wild-type mice. Further studies were done in C57/bl6 inbred mice into which the AQP4 null genotype was transferred. Fig. 3 (right) shows that most AQP4 null mice were deaf, whereas ABR waveforms could be elicited in matched wild-type mice. The results indicated remarkably impaired hearing in AQP4 null mice. ABR waveforms from wild-type and AQP4 null mice in the CD1 background were further analyzed. Fig. 4 Ashows wave I amplitudes measured at 70, 60, and 50 db click intensities. At each click intensity, the amplitudes of wave I were significantly greater for wild-type than for AQP4 null mice. Fig.4 B summarizes amplitude ratios of wave I/wave II and wave I/wave III for each mouse. There was no significant different in amplitude ratios in wild-type versus AQP4 null mice. Together, these results indicate that the hearing impairment arises from defective cochlear rather than downstream neural function. Tone ABR analysis was done to determine whether the hearing impairment in AQP4 null mice was frequency-dependent. Modulated tone bursts were created using a custom-built frequency synthesizer-modulator. Fig. 5 Ashows time-domain waveforms along with frequency spectra deduced by Fourier analysis of single clicks and tone bursts. Fig.5 B shows representative ABR waveforms in response to tone bursts. Qualitatively, ABR thresholds were increased in AQP4 null mice at all frequencies. Fig. 6 summarizes click and tone ABR thresholds for a series of wild-type and AQP4 null mice, indicating that the hearing impairment in AQP4 null mice is not frequency-specific.Figure 6Summary of ABR thresholds for click and tone stimuli in wild-type (closed circles) and AQP4 null (open circles) CD1 mice of age 4–5 weeks.Averaged data (mean ± S.E.) are shown for click and tone stimuli. *, indicates significant difference compared with wild-type mice: *, p < 0.001; ** p < 0.05.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Morphological examination of plastic sections of inner ear was done to determine whether anatomical differences could account for the impaired hearing in AQP4 null mice. Fig. 7(top) shows representative sections from two wild-type and two AQP4 null mice. The thin (2 µm) plastic sections clearly show an intact organ of Corti with well demarcated hair cells and supportive cells. No morphological differences were apparent in sections of inner ear evaluated blindly from four wild-type and four AQP4 null mice. Fig.7 (bottom) shows a schematic of the mouse cochlea based on the immunocytochemistry and histology studies (see “Discussion”). The principal goal of this study was to determine whether aquaporins play a functional role in hearing. Because there was disagreement in the literature about aquaporin expression patterns in mammalian inner ear, and no information was available to our knowledge on mouse inner ear, we determined by immunocytochemistry the expression pattern of aquaporins in mouse inner ear. Knockout mice lacking individual aquaporins served as controls. We found AQP1 protein in non-epithelial cells in spiral ligament and AQP4 in the basolateral plasma membranes of Hensen's cells and inner sulcus cells and the basal plasma membrane of Claudius cells in agreement with previous reports in guinea pig and/or rat. We did not find specific immunostaining of AQP2, AQP3, or AQP5, despite appropriate positive controls using mouse tissues known to express these aquaporins. Nevertheless, recognizing the limitations of antibody detection of aquaporins, ABR analysis was done on wild-type mice and knockout mice lacking AQP1, AQP3, AQP4, and AQP5. Although an AQP2 knock-in mouse model of autosomal recessive nephrogenic diabetes insipidus was recently created (4Yang B. Gillespie A. Carlson E.J. Epstein C.J. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2775-2779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), these mice were not suitable for ABR analysis because they generally did not survive beyond the first week of life. We found remarkable hearing impairment in AQP4 null mice, with no significant effect of deletion of AQP1, AQP3, or AQP5. The hearing-impaired AQP4 null mice did not show abnormalities in cochlear morphology at the light microscopic level. These results suggest that AQP4-mediated water transport in supportive epithelial cells in the organ of Corti is required for normal hearing. ABR analysis in mice is an established approach to detect hearing impairment resulting from a variety of genetic and acquired diseases (20Erway L.C. Shiau Y.W. Davis R.R. Krieg E.F. Hear. Res. 1996; 93: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 21Henry K.R. McGinn M.D. Carter L.A. Savoska E.A.

The measurements here were done in young adult mice to avoid the age-dependent hearing impairment that occurs in many mouse strains (19Zheng Q.Y. Johnson K.R. Erway L.C. Hear. Res. 1999; 130: 94-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar, 43Erway L.C. Willott J.F. Archer J.R. Harrison D.E. Hear. Res. 1993; 65: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), which could confound the interpretation of results. Hearing impairment in AQP4 null mice was found both in an outbred (CD1) and inbred (C57/bl6) genetic background. The ABR includes several waves; the first waves represent cochlear and auditory nerve activity, and the late waves arise from electrical activity in central auditory pathways (24Markland O.N. J. Clin. Neurophysiol. 1994; 11: 319-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 25Muller A.R. J. Clin. Neurophysiol. 1994; 11: 284-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The AQP4 null mice with elevated ABR thresholds did not have aberrant ABR wave patterns, as quantified by the amplitude ratios of wave I/wave II and wave I/wave III, suggesting that the hearing impairment in AQP4 null mice is caused by defects in the proximal rather than central part of the hearing system. Tone pulse ABR measurements indicated the hearing impairment was not frequency-dependent. Based on the biology of AQP4, we speculated about its role in hearing. AQP4 is an efficient water-selective transporting protein that does not carry protons, ions, or other small solutes (26Yang B. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16140-16146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). AQP4 was originally cloned from rat lung (27Hasegawa H. Ma T. Skach W. Matthay M. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5497-5500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and subsequently various isoforms in brain (28Jung J.S. Bhat R.V. Preston G.M. Guggino W.B. Baraban J.M. Agre P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 13052-13056Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar), stomach (29Misaka T. Abe K. Iwabuchi K. Kusakabe Y. Ichinose M. Miki K. Emori Y. Armis S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 208-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and other mammals have been sequenced. Knockout mice lacking AQP4 manifest a mild urinary concentrating defect (18Ma T. Yang B. Gillespie A. Carlson E.J. Epstein C.J. Verkman A.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 957-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar) because of impaired water transport in the inner medullary collecting duct (30Chou C.L. Ma T. Yang B. Knepper M.A. Verkman A.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C549-C554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, AQP4 is most strongly expressed in the nervous system, in astroglia throughout the brain and spinal cord, and in retinal Muller cells (31Frigeri A. Gropper M. Turck C.W. Verkman A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4328-4331Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 32Nagelhus E.A. Veruki M.L. Torp R. Haug F.M. Laake J.H. Nielsen S. Agre P. Ottersen O.P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2506-2519Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). AQP4 null mice showed remarkably altered cerebral water balance with protection from brain edema in a hyponatremia model of vasogenic edema and an ischemic stroke model of cytotoxic edema (5Manley G.T. Fujimura M. Ma T. Noshita N. Filiz F. Bollen A. Chan P. Verkman A.S. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar). A unique feature of AQP4 is its assembly in membranes in regular square arrays, called orthogonal arrays of particles; these are seen by freeze-fracture electron microscopy in AQP4-transfected cells (33Yang B. Brown D. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4577-4580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) and are found in the brain, kidney, and muscle of wild-type but not AQP4 null mice (34Verbavatz J.M. Ma T. Gobin R. Verkman A.S. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2855-2860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cochlea contains sensory hair cells that are responsible for transducing sound waves into electrical impulses. Hair-like stereocilica on the upper surface of sensory hair cells project into a cavity filled with endolymph fluid (Fig. 7, bottom). Acoustic stimuli reaching the inner ear deflect the stereocilia, resulting in K+ channel activation, K+ flooding from the endolymph into hair cells, hair cell membrane depolarization, and the generation of an electrical signal carried by the auditory nerve to the brain. The K+ concentration in endolymph is high and the Na+ concentration is low, resulting in a high resting endocochlear potential. The maintenance of high K+concentration in endolymph after acoustic signal transduction requires rapid recycling of K+ into the endolymph (35Sakaguchi N. Crouch J.J. Lytle C. Schulte B.A. Hear. Res. 1998; 118: 114-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 36Kubisch C. Schroedr B.C. Friedrich T. Lutjohann B. El-Amraoui A. Marlin S. Petit C. Jentsch T. Cell. 1999; 96: 437-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). Indeed, at least six of the many proteins associated with deafness in humans and mice are probably involved in K+ recycling (37Steel K.P. Science. 1999; 285: 1363-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), including the KCNQ4 K+ channel, which is mutated in one type of dominant progressive hearing loss (36Kubisch C. Schroedr B.C. Friedrich T. Lutjohann B. El-Amraoui A. Marlin S. Petit C. Jentsch T. Cell. 1999; 96: 437-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). The K+ ions are then taken up by the supporting hair cells, pass through a network of gap junctions that extends from the epithelial supporting cells to the mesenchymal fibrocytes that form the spiral ligament, and are secreted by epithelial marginal cells of the stria vascularis. AQP4 may be involved in maintaining osmotic balance during K+ recycling, because AQP4 is expressed selectively in supporting hair cells in the basolateral plasma membranes of Hensen's cells and in the basal plasma membrane of Claudius cells. We propose that the uptake of K+ by Hensen's cells drives AQP4-mediated water influx and that water exits the supporting cell syncytium through AQP4-expressing basal membranes of Claudius cells that face the root of the spiral ligament. The hearing deficit in AQP4 null mice may thus result from altered basal ionic composition of endolymph and/or outer hair cell volume. The involvement of AQP4 in facilitating K+ flux in supporting cells may be a general paradigm in the physiology of neuroexcitable tissues. In the central nervous system, AQP4 in astroglia is proposed to facilitate K+ fluxes associated with adjacent neurons (38Traynelis S.F. Dingledine R. J. Neurophysiol. 1989; 61: 927-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 39Random B.R. Orkand R.K.

Neurosci. 1997; 17: 171-180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and in the eye AQP4 in retinal Muller cells is proposed to facilitate K+ fluxes associated with adjacent bipolar cells (41Nagelhus E.A. Horio Y. Inanobe A. Fujita A. Haug F.M. Nielsen S. Kurachi Y. Ottersen O.P. Glia. 1999; 26: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). A close molecular association of AQP4 in orthogonal arrays of particles with K+ channels has been proposed (42Rash J.E. Tasumura T. Hudson C.S. Agre P. Nielsen S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11981-11986Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar).

Several FGFs, including the prototype factors FGF-1 and FGF-2, depend on interactions with heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans for activity. We have assessed tissue-derived HS fragments for binding to FGF-1 and FGF-2 to identify the authentic saccharide motifs required for interactions. Sequence information on a range of N-sulfated HS octasaccharides spanning from low to high affinity for FGF-1 was obtained. All octasaccharides with high affinity for FGF-1 (≥0.5 m NaCl required for elution) contained an internal IdoUA(2-OSO3)-GlcNSO3(6-OSO3)-IdoUA(2-OSO3)-trisaccharide motif. Octasaccharides with a higher overall degree of sulfation but lacking the specific trisaccharide motif showed lower affinity for FGF-1. FGF-2 was shown to bind to a mono-O-sulfated HS 6-mer carrying a single internal IdoUA(2-OSO3)-unit. However, a di-O-sulfated -IdoUA(2-OSO3)-GlcNSO3-IdoUA(2-OSO3)-trisaccharide sequence within a HS 8-mer gave stronger binding. These findings show that not only the number but also the positions of individual sulfate groups determine affinity of HS for FGFs. Our findings support the notion that FGF-dependent processes can be modulatedin vivo by regulated expression of distinct HS sequences.

More than 100 proteins have been reported to interact with the HS moiety of HS proteoglycan or with heparin, a more highly sulfated related polysaccharide. The best studied example of such binding is that of antithrombin, which interacts with a specific pentasaccharide sequence that carries several sulfate groups in critical positions (5Bourin M.-C. Lindahl U. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 313-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). A question of current interest is whether other proteins also bind specifically to distinct saccharide epitopes. Although many proteins bind the highly sulfated heparin structure, it has been proposed that the same ligands may selectively interact with cognate HS species containing more sparsely distributed sulfate groups (2Salmivirta M. Lidholt K. Lindahl U. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1270-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Research of the last decade has indeed identified a multitude of physiologically and pathophysiologically important processes that depend on HS/protein interactions (1Bernfield M. Götte M. Park P.W.

A polymer of alternatingd-glucuronic acid (GlcUA) and GlcNAc units, joined in [GlcUAβ1,4GlcNAcα1,4]n structure, is modified through N-deacetylation/N-sulfation of GlcNAc units, C-5 epimerization of GlcUA tol-iduronic acid (IdoUA), and O-sulfation at various locations (C-2 of IdoUA and GlcUA and C-3 and C-6 of GlcN units). The modification reactions are generally incomplete, thus generating the diverse distribution ofN-substituents, GlcUA/IdoUA units, and sulfate groups typical for HS. Although the mechanisms in control of polymer modification are not fully understood, it is clear that the number of distinct saccharide epitopes actually expressed will be restricted because of the substrate specificities of the enzymes involved. Much of the structural variability within HS chains resides in the contiguousN-sulfated (NS) regions, which are interspersed by essentially unmodified N-acetylated sequences and by alternating N-acetylated and NS disaccharide units (7Maccarana M.

It is believed that subtle changes in HS structure may result in altered interaction with proteins, and such effects have recently been demonstrated (15Feyzi E. Saldeen T. Larsson E. Lindahl U.

Although we thus assume that many proteins recognize distinct HS epitopes, the minimal requirements, in terms of HS structure, for interaction with a given protein have still been defined only for antithrombin. Moreover, we note that whereas the antithrombin-binding sequence features a “rare” component, the 3-O-sulfated GlcN unit (5Bourin M.-C. Lindahl U. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 313-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), it seems likely that most other proteins interact with structures made up of the commonly occurring disaccharide units (19Casu, B., and Lindahl, U. (2001) Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem., in press.Google Scholar).More than 20 members of the FGF family have been identified, and most of these growth factors bind heparin/HS. Experiments with the prototype species, acidic FGF (FGF-1) and basic FGF (FGF-2), using target cells deficient in HS biosynthesis have shown that the growth factors depend on cell surface HS for their mitogenic activity (20Rapraeger A.C.

The HS-deficient cells turn responsive to growth factor upon addition of exogenous heparin (that is normally contained in intracellular granules of the mast cell, thus unable to interact with extracellular growth factors). Experiments using selectively desulfated heparin preparations pointed to distinct O-sulfate requirements for interactions with FGF-1 (both IdoUA 2-O-sulfate and GlcN 6-O-sulfate groups) and FGF-2 (2-O-sulfate only) (22Guimond S.

Moreover, selected preparations of native HS were found to differ in their ability to promote FGF-1- and FGF-2-induced biological responses (17Nurcombe V. Smart C.E. Chipperfield H. Cool S.M. Boilly B. Hondermarck H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30009-30018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, most information so far available regarding the molecular aspects of FGF/polysaccharide interactions derives from crystallographic analysis of growth factors complexed with fully sulfated heparin oligosaccharides, with or without FGF receptor (FGFR) ectodomains (29Faham S. Hileman R.E. Fromm J.R. Linhardt R.J. Rees D.C. Science. 1996; 271: 1116-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar, 30DiGabriele A.D. Lax I. Chen D.I. Svahn C.M. Jaye M. Schlessinger J.

Intriguingly, the patterns revealed by these studies were highly diverse with respect to orientation, contact sites, and even stoichiometry of the interacting species. Nevertheless, binding of FGF to saccharide sequences spanning six monosaccharide units or less was a common feature of all models, presumably essential to receptor activation and intracellular signaling. The HS proteoglycan thus is ascribed a co-receptor function in which the HS chain interacts with the growth factor and, in most models postulated, also with the FGF tyrosine kinase receptor. The HS domain required to span growth factor and receptor extends beyond the sequence committed to growth factor binding alone (22Guimond S. Maccarana M. Olwin B.B. Lindahl U. Rapraeger A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23906-23914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Pellegrini L. Burke D.F. von Delft F. Mulloy B. Blundell T.L.

Cell. 2000; 6: 743-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). A recent study from our laboratory identifies HS sequences interacting with one of the FGFR species (33Loo B.-M. Kreuger J. Jalkanen M. Lindahl U. Salmivirta M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16868-16876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).Contrary to heparin oligosaccharides, abundantly available, an oligosaccharide derived from authentic HS and selected for ability to interact with a given protein will usually be obtained in minute, often subnanomol, quantities. The methods for sequence analysis of such samples have only recently been developed (34Turnbull J.E. Hopwood J.J. Gallagher J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2698-2703Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 35Venkataraman G. Shriver Z. Raman R. Sasisekharan R.

J. 1999; 339: 767-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have applied one of these procedures to a series of HS oligosaccharides isolated from pig mucosal HS and fractionated with regard to affinity for FGF-1. A minimal “binding motif” is identified, with three O-sulfate groups in fixed positions, although additional O-sulfation may increase the affinity depending on position. Using similar experimental protocol and scope we also reassess the interaction between HS and FGF-2.DISCUSSIONCompelling evidence from many research groups implicate HS proteoglycans with a “co-receptor” function in FGF signaling (see the Introduction). The precise role of the HS chain is still somewhat unclear, because it appears to interact not only with the growth factor but also with the receptor protein. Nevertheless, recent findings suggest that subtle modulation of HS structure may alter cellular responsiveness to FGFs (17Nurcombe V. Smart C.E. Chipperfield H. Cool S.M. Boilly B. Hondermarck H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30009-30018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 24Pye D.A. Vivès R.R. Turnbull J.E. Hyde P. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 7303-7310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Analysis of such modulation has so far been hampered by lack of methodology, in particular the inability to determine the fine structure, i.e. sequence of sulfated HS domains involved in protein binding. A recently developed method for sequence analysis has been applied to the characterization of HS domains interacting with FGF-1 and FGF-2. These applications show that heparin/HS-derived oligosaccharides in the low pmol range are amenable to sequence analysis. The novel sequencing technology, including the recent mass spectrometry-based approaches (35Venkataraman G. Shriver Z. Raman R. Sasisekharan R. Science. 1999; 286: 537-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), will greatly reinforce studies of the structure/function relations of HS.The structural requirements for interaction of HS with FGF-2 are relatively simple, a single IdoUA 2-O-sulfate group appropriately located in an NS domain being sufficient for appreciable affinity and an additional 2-O-sulfate group being sufficient for strong binding (Fig.10 C). Accordingly, most of the octamers tested, even from the low sulfated aortic HS, bound the FGF-2 column (Fig. 8). The ability to bind FGF-2 thus would seem to be constitutively expressed by most HS species. By contrast, the more complex sequences required for high affinity (≥0.5 m NaCl) interaction with FGF-1 occur in only ∼5% of all isolatedN-sulfated octamers from (the more highly sulfated) intestinal mucosa HS (Fig. 2). Such binding was found to require a characteristic tri-O-sulfated trisaccharide motif, minimally expressed in octasaccharide 8f, that could not be substituted for by other structures containing a larger number of sulfate groups within the same octamer framework (Fig. 10 A) (the relative importance of individual N-sulfate groups is not assessed in the present study). The subtle specificity of the interaction is illustrated by comparison of structures 8b(low affinity, 0.2 m NaCl) and 8f (high affinity, 0.5 m NaCl), which differ by the location of a single 6-O-sulfate group. Binding strength could be further increased by additional 6-O-sulfation, but only given the presence of the basic binding trisaccharide motif. By contrast, this motif contributed less to FGFR-4 binding than a larger number of more sparsely distributed O-sulfate groups (Fig. 10 B) (33Loo B.-M. Kreuger J. Jalkanen M. Lindahl U. Salmivirta M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16868-16876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). These findings point to the importance of regulation in HS biosynthesis, particularly regarding the distribution of 6-O-sulfate groups and add to the significance of recent studies of biosynthetic 6-O-sulfation patterning in HS domains (8Merry C.L. Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Hopwood J.J. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18455-18462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 9Safaiyan F. Lindahl U. Salmivirta M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10823-10830Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).Our results relating oligosaccharide structure to affinity for, in particular, FGF-1 suggest that HS sequences may be tailored to bind protein ligands with graded strength. At present we can only speculate over the functional meaning of such an arrangement. It should be emphasized that the HS chains serving as starting material for the preparation of labeled oligosaccharides were derived from complex tissues (intestinal mucosa and vascular wall), presumably from a variety of proteoglycan species variously located at cell surfaces and in the extracellular matrix. We have no information regarding the distribution of differentially sulfated NS domains between these proteoglycans, nor do we know whether all of these domains, only selected subpopulations, or yet other domains with mixed acetyl and sulfate N-substituents (not evaluated in the present study) are accessible to functional interactions with different FGFs in the intact tissues. Moreover, the HS/FGF-1 interaction may fulfill various biological purposes. Importantly, modulation of the binding of FGF to HS may regulate FGF-FGFR complex formation, receptor dimerization, and activation. However, the interaction may also serve to protect FGF against proteolysis (40Yoneda A. Asada M. Oda Y. Suzuki M. Imamura T. Nat. Biotech. 2000; 18: 641-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), control growth factor distribution in tissues (41Chang Z. Meyer K. Rapraeger A.C. Friedl A. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and capture growth factors for HS-mediated “facilitated diffusion” toward molecular encounters at the cell surface (42Lander A.D. Matrix Biol. 1998; 17: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar).The first attempt at defining the minimal structural requirements for HS interacting with FGF-2 (25Maccarana M. Casu B. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23898-23905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) implicated a pentasaccharide sequence with three hexuronic acid units and two N-sulfated GlcN residues, the reducing-terminal IdoUA unit being 2-O-sulfated (Fig. 10 C). Lacking methods at the time for direct sequencing, the binding structure was deduced from the compositional analysis of oligosaccharides from different sources, including partially O-desulfated heparin. This structure was recovered within one of the FGF-2-binding HS octamers (8l) identified in the present work. The IdoUA 2-O-sulfate group on unit 5 was found also in octasaccharide 8m, which bound FGF-2 with higher affinity. The increase in affinity was likely due to the additional 2-O-sulfate residue on unit 3. These structures may be compared with the binding motif deduced from crystallographic analysis, by Faham et al. (29Faham S. Hileman R.E. Fromm J.R. Linhardt R.J. Rees D.C. Science. 1996; 271: 1116-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar) of a complex between FGF-2 and a fully sulfated heparin hexasaccharide. This motif included the 2-O-sulfate group on unit 3 but not the one on unit 5. Yet another FGF-2-binding motif was put forth by Schlessingeret al. (32Schlessinger J. Plotnikov A.N. Ibrahimi O.A. Eliseenkova A.V. Yeh B.K. Yayon A. Linhardt R.J. Mohammadi M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 743-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar) in their study of a FGF-2/FGFR-1/heparin 10-mer complex (Fig. 10 C). Notably, although this motif again differed from that deduced by Faham et al. (29Faham S. Hileman R.E. Fromm J.R. Linhardt R.J. Rees D.C. Science. 1996; 271: 1116-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar), both structures are covered by HS octasaccharide8m. 7According to Schlessinger et al. (32Schlessinger J. Plotnikov A.N. Ibrahimi O.A. Eliseenkova A.V. Yeh B.K. Yayon A. Linhardt R.J. Mohammadi M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 743-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar) 6-O-sulfate groups on units 2 and 6 contribute weakly to the interaction. Also, variable sets of sulfate groups in a heparin 10-mer could contribute to FGF-1 binding, as shown by DiGabriele et al. (30DiGabriele A.D. Lax I. Chen D.I. Svahn C.M. Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1998; 393: 812-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the interaction potential of HS sequences may not be readily deduced from crystal data involving heparin (used as a substitute for the authentic HS provided at the cell surface). Similar concern potentially applies also to the recent crystallographic analyses of more complex interaction systems, involving growth factors, extracellular receptor domains, and heparin oligomers (31Pellegrini L. Burke D.F. von Delft F. Mulloy B. Blundell T.L. Nature. 2000; 407: 1029-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 32Schlessinger J. Plotnikov A.N. Ibrahimi O.A. Eliseenkova A.V. Yeh B.K. Yayon A. Linhardt R.J. Mohammadi M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 743-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). We anticipate that interaction studies, by crystallography as well as other methods, will be refined through the future availability of synthetic homogeneous oligosaccharides that express the minimal structural features required for interactions with growth factors and receptors. Heparan sulfate (HS)1proteoglycans are present on the surface of all adherent mammalian cells as well as in the extracellular matrix. The biological functions of the structurally diverse HS chains are mediated through binding to a variety of proteins, including enzymes, enzyme inhibitors, cytokines/growth factors, and extracellular matrix molecules (1Bernfield M.

More than 100 proteins have been reported to interact with the HS moiety of HS proteoglycan or with heparin, a more highly sulfated related polysaccharide. The best studied example of such binding is that of antithrombin, which interacts with a specific pentasaccharide sequence that carries several sulfate groups in critical positions (5Bourin M.-C. Lindahl U. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 313-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). A question of current interest is whether other proteins also bind specifically to distinct saccharide epitopes. Although many proteins bind the highly sulfated heparin structure, it has been proposed that the same ligands may selectively interact with cognate HS species containing more sparsely distributed sulfate groups (2Salmivirta M. Lidholt K. Lindahl U. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1270-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Research of the last decade has indeed identified a multitude of physiologically and pathophysiologically important processes that depend on HS/protein interactions (1Bernfield M. Götte M. Park P.W.

A polymer of alternatingd-glucuronic acid (GlcUA) and GlcNAc units, joined in [GlcUAβ1,4GlcNAcα1,4]n structure, is modified through N-deacetylation/N-sulfation of GlcNAc units, C-5 epimerization of GlcUA tol-iduronic acid (IdoUA), and O-sulfation at various locations (C-2 of IdoUA and GlcUA and C-3 and C-6 of GlcN units). The modification reactions are generally incomplete, thus generating the diverse distribution ofN-substituents, GlcUA/IdoUA units, and sulfate groups typical for HS. Although the mechanisms in control of polymer modification are not fully understood, it is clear that the number of distinct saccharide epitopes actually expressed will be restricted because of the substrate specificities of the enzymes involved. Much of the structural variability within HS chains resides in the contiguousN-sulfated (NS) regions, which are interspersed by essentially unmodified N-acetylated sequences and by alternating N-acetylated and NS disaccharide units (7Maccarana M.

Nitrosation of amine, thiol, and hydroxyl residues can modulate critical cell functions. The biological mechanisms that control reactivity of nitrogen oxide species formed during autoxidation of nano- to micromolar levels of NO were examined using the synthetic donor NaEt2NN(O)NO (DEA/NO), human tumor cells, and 4,5-diaminofluorescein (DAF). Both the disappearance of NO and formation of nitrosated product from DAF in aerobic aqueous buffer followed second order processes; however, consumption of NO and nitrosation within intact cells were exponential. An optimal ratio of DEA/NO and 2-phenyl-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazole-1-oxyl 3-oxide (PTIO) was used to form N2O3 through the intermediacy of NO2. This route was found to be most reflective of the nitrosative mechanism within intact cells and was distinct from the process that occurred during autoxidation of NO in aqueous media. Manipulation of the endogenous scavengers ascorbate and glutathione indicated that the location, affinity, and concentration of these substances were key determinants in dictating nitrosative susceptibility of molecular targets. Taken together, these findings suggest that the functional effects of nitrosation may be organized to occur within discrete domains or compartments.

Although NO directly reacts primarily with metalloproteins, reactive nitrogen oxide species (RNOS)1 formed during the autoxidation of NO can engage an alternate and broader range of molecular targets (2Griffith O.W.

Several mechanisms have been proposed for autoxidation of NO (17–30). However, few studies have examined this process in the context of the intracellular milieu (29Liu X. Miller M.J.S. Joshi M.S.

Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). We tested the hypothesis that the autoxidation process within the architecture of intact cells is distinct from that which occurs in the aqueous extracellular medium. The results suggest that NO2 is not an intermediate species during NO autoxidation in aqueous phase. Cellular hydrophobic domains in conjunction with scavenger composition and location may serve to focus nitrosation chemistry to discrete sites during NO autoxidation in biological systems. NaEt2NN(O)NO (DEA/NO) was a generous gift from Dr. Joseph Saavedra (NCI, National Institutes of Health, Frederick, MD). DEA/NO decomposes to release free NO into solution with a half-life of 2.5 min at neutral pH and 37 °C (Refs. 31Hrabie J.A. Klose J.R. Wink D.A. Keefer L.K. J. Org. Chem. 1993; 58: 1472-1476Crossref Scopus (573) Google Scholar and 32Keefer L.K. Nims R.W. Davies K.M. Wink D.A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 268: 281-293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; see also Fig. 2 A). Stock solutions (∼1 mm) were prepared in 10 mm NaOH and were stored at −20 °C, and concentrations were determined from the absorbance values at 250 nm in 10 mm NaOH (ε = 8000m−1 cm−1; Ref. 31Hrabie J.A. Klose J.R. Wink D.A. Keefer L.K. J. Org. Chem. 1993; 58: 1472-1476Crossref Scopus (573) Google Scholar) directly prior to use. The rate of DEA/NO decomposition was unaltered by the presence of either DAF or 2-phenyl-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazole-1-oxyl 3-oxide (PTIO). Ascorbic acid, 2,2′-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA), and glutathione (GSH) were purchased from Sigma. PTIO, 4,5-diaminofluorescein-2 (DAF), and DAF-diacetate were purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Initial experiments indicated that, during aerobic decomposition of 0.5 µm DEA/NO in a PBS-buffered solution, the fluorescence signal from the DAF reaction product triazolofluorescein was linearly dependent on DAF, with concentrations ranging from 1 nm to 1 µm. At higher DAF concentrations, nonlinearity in fluorescence response was observed indicative of an interference effect; therefore, solution data were accumulated in PBS solutions containing 1 µm DAF and the metal chelator DTPA (50 µm) unless otherwise indicated. The level of ambient light was kept to a minimum during all steps involving DAF. For anaerobic analysis, the assay buffer was deaerated by bubbling with argon through a septum-sealed cuvette. The human cancer cell lines MCF-7 (breast), A-549 (lung), and HT-29 (colon) were obtained from American Type Tissue Collection (Manassas, VA) and were cultured as attached cells to 80% confluence in either T-75 flasks (Falcon) or 96-well, black-walled plates (Corning) containing RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT), 4.5 g/liter glucose, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 and 95% air. As indicated, cells were treated with either 50 µm BSO or 200 µm ascorbate for 16 h prior to testing. Cells subsequently were gently rinsed with PBS and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with a PBS solution containing 5 µm DAF-diacetate and DTPA (50 µm). After replacement of the DAF solution with fresh PBS, the cells were dislodged and were either washed three times by a cycle of suspension and centrifugation or, in the case of the 96-well plate format, were rinsed by cycles of aspiration and PBS addition. Differences in uptake efficiency of DAF between tumor cell lines were determined by reacting lysates (two pulses of 10 s with an ultrasonicator; Cole-Palmer, Vernon Hills, IL) of each sample preparation with a large excess of DEA/NO (500 µm) to give maximal fluorescent signal. The total DAF uptake by MCF-7 and A-549 cells was equivalent, whereas that by HT-29 cells was ∼65–75% lower. This approach also confirmed that the total level of intracellular DAF for each cell line was in excess relative to the concentration of introduced nitrogen oxides in subsequent experiments. Ultrasonication of intact cells following complete decomposition of DEA/NO did not affect the intensity of fluorescence, indicating that interference quenching within the enclosure of the cell did not occur. Treatment with BSO augmented the absolute level of intracellular DAF roughly 3–4-fold in MCF-7 and A-549 cells, but had little effect on DAF uptake in HT-29 cells. Pre-incubation of MCF-7, A-549, and HT-29 cells with ascorbate did not significantly alter DAF uptake. The diacetate derivative of DAF was designed to aid in retention of DAF within intact cells. The level of DAF leakage from cells 30 min after suspension in fresh PBS-buffered solution was determined from the signals obtained in supernatant relative to the lysed cell pellet following exposure to DEA/NO (500 µm). Leakage of the dye back into solution or incidental cellular lysis resulted in a signal that was 2–3% of the total amount of fluorophore present in 1 × 106 cells. To avoid misinterpretation of this solution artifact as intracellular signal, DAF-loaded cells were washed and suspended into fresh buffer immediately prior to testing. Trypan blue dye exclusion indicated that viability of intact cells at the end of all treatment conditions was in the range of 92–100%. UV-visible spectroscopy was performed with a Hewlett-Packard 8452A diode array spectrophotometer. Fluorescence measurements were obtained on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50B fluorometer with excitation at 495 and emission at 515 nm with either 2.5- or 5.0-mm slit widths as indicated. The reaction solution (2 ml) was stirred and maintained at 37 °C with a water-jacketed cuvette holder. Additional fluorescence measurements were obtained on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences HTS 7100 fluorescent plate reader (200-µl volume, 37 °C). Kinetic analyses (KaleidaGraph software; Synergy, Reading, PA) of fluorescence signal increases were performed on data sets excluding the first 2 min to ignore the contribution from DEA/NO decay prior to the NO maximum. Kinetic simulations were obtained using Stella II software (High Performance Systems). NO measurements were made using a NO-specific electrochemical probe (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) suspended into a fluorometer cuvette controlled by a DUO18 amplifier and software. Signals were calibrated using argon-purged PBS solutions of saturated NO gas (Matheson, Montgomeryville, PA) following determination of concentration with ABTS (660 nm, ε = 12,000m−1 cm−1; Ref. 33Christodoulou D. Kudo S. Cook J.A. Krishna M.C. Miles A. Grisham M.B. Murugesan M. Ford P.C. Wink D.A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 268: 69-83Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The background signals were assessed using nitrite or DEA/NO pre-incubated for 4 h in buffer. The microscopic characteristics of DAF-loaded cells were viewed using a Zeiss LSM 210 microscope equipped with a mercury lamp and a fluorescein filter set. N-Nitrosation of the aromatic vicinal amines of DAF results in formation of a triazolofluorescein product that exhibits fluorescence with a high extinction coefficient and quantum yield (34Kojima H. Nakatsubo N. Kikuchi K. Kawahara S. Kirino Y. Nagoshi H. Hirata Y. Nagano T. Anal. Chem. 1998; 70: 2446-2453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar). Decomposition of DEA/NO in a PBS-buffered solution containing DAF generated fluorescent product (Fig.1 A). Since NO was introduced by decay of DEA/NO (k = 4.6 × 103s−1; Ref. 30Thomas D.D. Liu X. Kantrow S.P. Lancaster Jr., J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar) as opposed to bolus addition, the temporal increase in signal intensity is reflective initially of NO release from this donor compound (Reaction 1).DEA/NO+H+→2NO+NH2Et2REACTION1As NO levels decreased with decay of DEA/NO, the rate-limiting step for fluorescent product formation becomes autoxidation, which is second order in NO (Reaction 2; k = 8 × 106m−2 s−1; Refs. 18Wink D.A. Darbyshire J.F. Nims R.W. Saavedra J.E. Ford P.C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholarand 19Wink D.A. Nims R.W. Darbyshire J.F. Christodoulou D. Hanbauer I.

Electrochemical detection of the NO concentration in solution corroborated this interpretation as the free NO level rose to a maximum, indicative of production exceeding the rate of consumption, then declined by a second order process (Fig.2 A, k = 1.6 ± 0.1 × 10−3m−1s−1, buffer). At the detection limits of the fluorometer, the process by which low nanomolar levels of NO elicited increases in fluorescent product remained second order (data not shown). Inclusion of the metal chelator DTPA did not affect the reaction. Addition of nitrite, diethylamine, or previously decomposed DEA/NO did not generate fluorescent product when DAF was present in either solution or within cells. DAF nitrosation during decomposition of DEA/NO was dependent on O2 and did not develop upon re-oxygenation of solutions previously reacted in the absence of O2. These results indicated that NO does not nitrosate DAF directly and were consistent with formation of N2O3 consequent to autoxidation of NO. To test the hypothesis that the intracellular milieu alters nitrosation, tumor cells were loaded with DAF and remained either intact or were ruptured by ultrasonication immediately prior to exposure to equal concentrations of DEA/NO. The fluorescent signal generated from N2O3 reaction with DAF inside intact MCF-7 cells was 54 ± 12% lower than the signal observed with corresponding lysate (Fig. 1 B). Comparable results were obtained with A-549 cells (data not shown). Similar to cell-free solution, the rate of fluorescence increase following cellular disruption was second order (Fig. 1 B, lysed,k = 5.2 ± 0.8 × 10−3m−1 s−1). In contrast, the appearance of fluorescent product from DAF localized within intact cells was exponential with an apparent first order rate constant of 4.0 ± 0.3 × 10−3 s−1. Given the similarity between this value and the rate for DEA/NO decomposition (4.6 × 10−3 s−1; Ref. 32Keefer L.K. Nims R.W. Davies K.M. Wink D.A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 268: 281-293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we tested the hypothesis that the enhanced solubility of NO and O2within the hydrophobic phase of cellular membranes may accelerate the rate of N2O3 formation (29Liu X. Miller M.J.S. Joshi M.S. Thomas D.D. Lancaster Jr., J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2175-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar) beyond the rate of DEA/NO decomposition at all time points. Simulations predicted that the maximum NO concentration would decrease 4-fold under these conditions (Fig. 2 B); however, this model was incongruous with experimental data. The presence of MCF-7 tumor cells (1 × 106, 2-ml volume, stirring, 37 °C) resulted in only a small reduction (∼20%) in the electrochemical signal peak height during decomposition of 1 µm DEA/NO (Fig. 2 A). If cells consume NO (30Thomas D.D. Liu X. Kantrow S.P. Lancaster Jr., J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar), then nitrosation during autoxidation would be decreased. An increased first order rate of NO disappearance (k = 2.5 ± 0.4 × 10−3s−1) was evident from solution containing cells exemplified by a faster return of the electrochemical signal to base line (Fig. 2 A). Consistent with this, inhibition of fluorescence generated with DEA/NO and free DAF in aerobic solution was observed upon addition of intact tumor cells (Fig.3 A). Notably, a reciprocal plot of these data revealed that inhibition occurred by two distinct processes (Fig. 3 B). PTIO is an imidazolineoxyl N-oxide spin-trap that converts NO directly to NO2 in an oxygen transfer reaction (k = 1 × 104m−1 s−1; Refs. 35Akaike T. Yoshida M. Miyamoto Y. Sato K. Kohno M. Sasamoto K. Miyazaki K. Ueda S. Maeda H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 827-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar and 36Akaike T. Maeda H. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 268: 211-221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Reaction 3).NO+PTIO→NO2+PTIREACTION3We used PTIO as a tool to investigate the relationship between cells and NO2 formation during NO autoxidation. Electrochemical measurements verified that the level of free NO present in solution during DEA/NO decomposition was decreased by PTIO in a dose-dependent fashion (data not shown). PTIO at 500-fold or greater excess relative to DEA/NO resulted in nearly complete inhibition of fluorescent product formation from DAF (Fig.4 A). Under these conditions, conversion of NO to NO2 by PTIO approached 100%, indicating that NO2 alone cannot nitrosate DAF. In contrast, the rate and yield of product formation in both cells (Fig.1 C) and solution (Fig. 4 A) were markedly augmented with lower concentrations of PTIO, where some portions of NO remained available to react with NO2, forming N2O3 (Reaction 4; k = 1.1 × 109 s−1, Refs. 22Goldstein S. Czapski G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 12078-12084Crossref Scopus (215) Google Scholar and 26Bonner F.T. Stedman G. Methods in Nitric Oxide Research. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1996: 1-18Google Scholar).NO+NO2→N2O3REACTION4The optimal ratio to achieve maximal nitrosation of DAF was ∼10–15-fold excess PTIO to DEA/NO (Fig. 4 A). The fluorescent product yield under these conditions was 10-fold higher relative to the signal observed with autoxidation alone (Fig.1 C). The absence of a headspace in the reaction vessel had a negligible effect (±5%; data not shown) on fluorescent product formation during DEA/NO decomposition in aerobic solution. Therefore, the marked increase in nitrosated product yield observed with NO/PTIO was not the result of NO capture prior to escape into room air. A double-reciprocal plot of fluorescence as function of DAF concentration indicated there was a vast difference between the affinities of the nitrosating species produced during DEA/NO decomposition in either the presence (−1/X int = 0.44 ± 0.04 µm) or absence (−1/X int = 5.5 ± 0.6 µm) of PTIO (Fig. 4 B). At infinite concentrations of DAF, the maximal fluorescence values were similar (1/Y int = 2900, DEA/NO; 4000, DEA/NO + PTIO), indicating that the absolute levels of nitrosating species formed were comparable. Although PTIO is cell-impermeable, the NO/PTIO combination resulted in an augmented level of intracellular DAF nitrosation relative to that achieved solely with NO autoxidation (Fig. 1 D). Fluorescent production formation was further enhanced in lysate relative to the signal obtained with DAF inside intact cells. Experiments with PTIO, DEA/NO, and free DAF in solution showed that addition of intact cells progressively inhibited formation of nitrosated product (Fig.3 C). A reciprocal plot of these data indicated a single inhibitory process (Fig. 3 D). The slope (m = 0.0031) of this line was similar to the slower process (m = 0.0018) observed with DEA/NO in the absence of PTIO (Fig. 3 B). The role of endogenous quenchers of nitrosation was evaluated. Nitrosation of DAF (1 µm) in aqueous buffer was more susceptible to ascorbate (IC50 = 2 µm,r 2 = 0.996) than GSH (IC50 = 90 µm,r 2 = 0.990) during DEA/NO decomposition (1 µm). Extracellular GSH at a ratio of ≥200:1 completely inhibited intracellular nitrosation of DAF during DEA/NO decomposition. In contrast, much lower levels of GSH (∼6:1) quenched DAF product formation within cells when nitrosation was elicited in the presence of PTIO (Fig. 5). Cells were incubated with either ascorbate or BSO, the competitive inhibitor of γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (37Griffith O.W. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 922-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar, 38Liebmann J.E. Hahn S.M. Cook J.A. Lipschultz C. Mitchell J.B. Kaufman D.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2066-2070PubMed Google Scholar), to determine the degree to which ascorbate or GSH may protect intracellular constituents from nitrosation. The level of fluorescence generated by exposure to DEA/NO was increased roughly 2-fold in MCF-7 and A-549 cells depleted of GSH with BSO (Fig. 6). Nitrosation in GSH-depleted HT-29 cells was relatively unchanged (data not shown). The rate constants for fluorescent product formation in MCF-7 cells treated with BSO were first order (4.0 ± 0.8 × 10−3s−1), similar to those observed in non-BSO-treated cells (data not shown). Fluorescence maxima produced by DEA/NO were reduced ∼30–60% in each tumor cell type previously supplemented with ascorbate (Fig. 5).Figure 6Influence of intracellular ascorbate and GSH levels on nitrogen oxide-induced fluorescence in tumor cells. The human tumor cell lines MCF-7 or A-549 were plated into a 96-well culture plate at a density of 50 × 105 and were treated for 16 h with either ascorbate (Asc, 200 µm) or BSO (5 mm). Following a 1-h incubation period in PBS-buffered solution containing 5 µmDAF-diacetate, cells were gently rinsed twice and reacted with DEA/NO (20 µm) in buffer for 1 h at 37 °C. Representative data are shown as the mean ± S.E. of quadruplicate wells (n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A heterogeneous pattern of intracellular fluorescence was evident when tumor cells loaded with DAF were viewed under a microscopic following exposure to DEA/NO (data not shown). Qualitatively, fluorescence was often organized into discrete regions resulting in punctate appearance. A diffuse pattern that filled the entire cell, however, was evident in many cases. The fluorescence per individual cell ranged from none (background) to greater than 95%. We tested the hypothesis that the chemistry of NO autoxidation in aqueous solution was not synonymous with the reaction within intact cells. Nitrosation of free DAF in aerobic solution occurred by an apparent second order process consistent with disappearance of NO as the rate-limiting step (18Wink D.A. Darbyshire J.F. Nims R.W. Saavedra J.E. Ford P.C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 19Wink D.A. Nims R.W. Darbyshire J.F. Christodoulou D. Hanbauer I. Cox G.W. Laval F. Laval J.

The temporal increase in fluorescent signal elicited by DEA/NO decomposition appeared to be first order when DAF was intracellular (Fig. 1 B). The higher solubility of both NO and O2 within cellular membranes accelerates the rate of NO autoxidation, but does not significantly alter the second order rate constant for N2O3 formation (29Liu X. Miller M.J.S. Joshi M.S. Thomas D.D. Lancaster Jr., J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2175-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Simulations of NO disappearance by hydrophobic solubility affects alone were inconsistent with experimental results (Fig. 2, A andB). In agreement with our findings (Fig. 2 A), cellular consumption of NO by a non-nitrosating pathway with a modeled rate constant of 2 × 10−3 s−1 predicted a lower yield of nitrosated product and accelerated NO depletion. Autoxidation may predominate at high concentrations of NO (second order in NO) until levels fall to a point where cellular consumption becomes competitive. This threshold phenomenon cloaks the overall appearance of fluorescent product within cells as an apparent first order process.

NO levels generated from constitutive NOS isoforms are generally limited by feedback inhibition from nitrosyl complex formation at the catalytic heme site (39Abu-Soud H.M. Wang J. Rousseau D.L.

Physiol. 2001; 280: L465-L473Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), while we observed second order dependence for fluorescent product formation in solution at submicromolar concentrations of NO from synthetic donors (e.g. Fig. 1 C). These data are consistent with the viewpoint that physiologic NO formation can lead to subtle levels of nitrosation, which may function to modulate residues critical for channel gating, subunit dimerization, and enzyme activity. Measurements in the current in vitro studies were conducted in the absence of glucose. We have observed that manipulation of mitochondrial status in MCF-7 cells (± glucose, rotenone, actinomycin D) had little effect on both NO consumption and extracellular DAF nitrosation. However, intracellular DAF nitrosation levels were influenced by respiration, albeit only modestly (10–15%; data not shown). Localization of DAF within mitochondria has been examined (44Lopez-Figueroa M.O. Caamano C. Morano M.I. Ronn L.C. Akil H. Watson S.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 129-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and intraorganelle nitrosation mechanisms remain an active area of inquiry. Although cells can affect the rate of nitrosation, nucleophilic substances such as GSH and ascorbate can limit the yields of nitrosation by competitive scavenging of N2O3(16Espey M.G. Miranda K.M.

Mitchell J.B. Kaufman D.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2066-2070PubMed Google Scholar), a concentration that completely quenches autoxidation-elicited nitrosation in solution by even supraphysiologic NO levels. Despite this, intracellular nitrosation of DAF was elicited with submicromolar NO. Moreover, the approximate 2-fold increases in DAF nitrosation in BSO-treated cells were similar to the increases in fluorescence intensity observed by diluting the intracellular contents upon lysis (Fig. 1 B). Conversely, enrichment of intracellular ascorbate levels inhibited intracellular nitrosation from NO autoxidation (Fig. 6). The results show that the scope of protection by GSH and ascorbate are dependent on both their differential affinity and concentration. Although chronic nitrosative stress globally depletes these defenses, salubrious nitrosative reactions that function as redox switches may be specifically sheltered from quenching in compartments that exclude these agents (e.g. channels, vacuoles). Caution must be taken when examining modulation of intracellular protein function by nitrosative mechanisms outside the context of the intact cells in tissue or biological fluids (e.g. purified recombinant protein in simple buffer), which may result in a misinterpretation of the actual susceptibility to nitrosative stress in vivo (49Zhou X. Espey M.G. Chen J.X. Hofseth L.J. Miranda K.M. Hussain S.P. Wink D.A. Harris C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21241-21246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar,50Ogawa R.

To test whether the intermediates of the NO autoxidation reaction in water produces intermediates different from those formed in the gas phase/hydrophobic media (18Wink D.A. Darbyshire J.F. Nims R.W.

Perkin Trans. 1978; 1: 1296-1302Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar), we formed NO2from the reaction between NO and PTIO (Reactions 3 and 4; Refs. 35Akaike T. Yoshida M. Miyamoto Y. Sato K. Kohno M.

Methods Enzymol. 1996; 268: 211-221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to circumventing the rate-limiting step in autoxidation, the optimal balance of PTIO and DEA/NO dramatically augmented the rate of DAF nitrosation and markedly increased product yield (Figs. 1 C and 4 A). A double-reciprocal plot of fluorescence versus DAF concentration demonstrated that the nitrosating species formed by the NO/PTIO route has a much higher affinity for DAF than that formed during NO autoxidation in aqueous media (Fig. 4 B). For both DEA/NO and DEA/NO + PTIO paradigms, the end point product yield at saturating concentrations of DAF (1/Y int) were similar. These data indicate that the absolute concentrations of nitrosating species formed by either pathway are comparable. Thus, the striking difference in the affinity of these species was likely due to their selectivity toward DAF. Differences in affinity were not restricted to DAF, but were also observed with biological substrates such as GSH (Fig. 5) as well as ABTS and ferrocyanide (data not shown). Consistent with these data, the reactivity of gaseous N2O3 dissolved in water was observed to be remarkably different than N2O3 formed from acidic nitrite (28Challis B.C. Kyrtopoulos S.A. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1978; 1: 1296-1302Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results raise the possibility that distinct nitrosating intermediates may exist in biological systems (18Wink D.A. Darbyshire J.F. Nims R.W. Saavedra J.E. Ford P.C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 19Wink D.A. Nims R.W. Darbyshire J.F. Christodoulou D. Hanbauer I. Cox G.W. Laval F. Laval J. Cook J.A. Krishna M.C. Ford P.C.

A. 1999; 122: 1-5Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The low affinity profile observed during NO autoxidation in buffer calls into question the proposed mechanism involving NO2intermediacy. Analysis of fluorescence from DAF free in aqueous solution as a function of intact cell number during DEA/NO decomposition revealed two processes for inhibition of nitrosation (Fig. 3, A andB). The initial process was consistent with NO consumption by intact cells. The slope of the second process was similar to the inhibition profile observed with NO + NO2 generated artificially with DEA/NO and PTIO (Fig. 3, C andD). Based on this similarity, we propose that cells provide an environment, possibly the hydrophobic portion of membranes, which leads to formation of a high affinity nitrosating species. High levels of extracellular GSH were able to inhibit nitrosation of intracellular DAF (Fig. 5). These data suggest the existence of a species with sufficient lifetime to diffuse from the cellular membranes into the medium. Based on rates of hydrolysis, the most likely candidate is NO2, which could combine with NO resulting in formation of N2O3 (Reaction 4). These findings raise the possibility that distinct profiles of NO autoxidation may exist within cells versus the aqueous interstitium. This dichotomy would be of consequence due to the differential reactivity of N2O3 formed by each pathway and may serve to focus chemical modifications during NO diffusion into discrete subcellular domains at both the tissue and molecular levels. Critical to this balance is the fate of NO2, which may lead to nitrosative, oxidative, or nitrative reactions depending on the levels of appropriate substrates and the concentration of NO. An imbalance in the levels of key endogenous scavenger substances for RNOS can lead to either nitrosative or oxidative stress. These results provide a novel framework for the mechanisms of nitrosation at physiological NO concentrations in biological systems."

Matsui H. Hatase O. Takahashi H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6746-6753Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Thus, from the amino terminus, Picchu-X consists of YFP (amino acids 1–239), spacer (Leu-Asp), CrkII (amino acids 1–236), spacer (Gly-Arg), CFP (amino acids 1–237), spacer (Gly-Arg-Ser-Arg), and CAAX box of Ki-Ras (amino acids 169–188). The nucleotide sequences of the coding regions of pPicchu and pPicchu-X were deposited in the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank. pEBG-cAbl was provided by B. J. Mayer (University of Connecticut). COS-1, A431, NIH3T3, and HT1080 were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection or the Japan Cell Resource Bank. An abl-deficient cell line, P13, was obtained from B. J. Mayer (University of Connecticut). Anti-Crk monoclonal antibody was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Anti-GFP rabbit serum and anti-phospho-CrkII antibody were developed in our laboratory (15Hashimoto Y. Katayama H. Kiyokawa E. Ota S. Kurata T. Gotoh N. Shibata M. Otsuka N. Matsuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17186-17191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). 293T cells were transfected with pPicchu with or without pEBG-c-Abl. Thirty-six hours after transfection, the cells were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100) and clarified by centrifugation. A fluorescence spectrum was obtained by use of an excitation wavelength of 433 nm with an FP-750 spectrofluorometer (JASCO Co, Tokyo). In another experiment, pPicchu, pPichu-Y221F, and pPicchu-R38V with or without pEBG-cAbl were transfected into 293T cells grown on a pair of culture dishes. The cells on the first dish were used for in vitro spectroscopy analysis, and the cells grown on the second dish were used for immunoblotting. The cells were lysed in SDS sample buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.1m dithiothreitol, 1% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 0.05% bromphenol blue), boiled for 4 min, and clarified by centrifugation. The lysates from equal amounts of cells were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The filters were probed with the antibodies as described (15Hashimoto Y. Katayama H. Kiyokawa E. Ota S. Kurata T. Gotoh N. Shibata M. Otsuka N. Matsuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17186-17191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The cells were plated on a collagen-coated 35-mm-diameter glass base dish (Asahi Techno Glass Co., Tokyo, Japan) and transfected with plasmids by use of either Superfect (Qiagen) or LipofectAMINE 2000 (Life Technologies, Inc.). In some experiments, the cells were serum-starved for 6 h and stimulated with 20 ng/ml EGF. In another set of experiments, the cells were pretreated with 10 nm AG1478 (Calbiochem), an inhibitor of EGF receptor tyrosine kinase, or 5 nm PP2 (Calbiochem), an inhibitor of Src tyrosine kinase, for 30 min. The cells were imaged on a Zeiss Axiovert microscope with a 75-W xenon arc lamp, two filter changers, a temperature-controlled CO2chamber, and a cooled CCD camera, CoolSNAP-FX, controlled by MetaMorph software (Roper Scientific, Trenton, NJ) as described previously (27Miyawaki A. Llopis J. Heim R. McCaffery J.M. Adams J.A. Ikura M. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1997; 388: 882-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (2650) Google Scholar). For dual emission ratio imaging of Picchu, we used a 12% neutral density filter, an 86436 excitation filter (Chroma), a 455DRLP dichroic mirror (Omega), and two emission filters (Chroma), 86470 for CFP and 86535 for YFP, alternated by a filter changer. The cell images were analyzed with MetaMorph software. For the photobleaching of YFP, we illuminated a single cell by narrowing the field diaphragm, removed the neutral density filter, and photobleached with an 86500 excitation filter (Chroma) for 2 min. The cells were also imaged on an Olympus confocal laser microscope FV500ZX5 equipped with an Omnichrome HeCd laser. We designed a protein that consisted of CrkII and a pair of YFP and CFP, so that intramolecular binding of the SH2 domain of CrkII to phosphorylated Tyr221brought CFP close to YFP and increased FRET from CFP to YFP (Fig.1 A). This recombinant protein was designated as a phosphorylation indicator of CrkII chimeric unit (Picchu). The prototype Picchu, however, showed only a marginal difference in the FRET efficiency between the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms. Therefore, we truncated CrkII from the carboxyl terminus, expecting an increase in the FRET efficiency of the phosphorylated form. These truncated mutants of Picchu were co-expressed in 293T cells with or without c-Abl, and their emission profiles were examined at an excitation wavelength of 433 nm. FRET was most typically observed as an increase in an emission peak of 527 nm and a decrease in an emission peak of 475 nm. The emission ratio of 527/475 nm, which reflected the FRET efficiency, was increased in the presence of c-Abl (Fig. 1 B). Among several mutants, Picchu-225, -230, and -236 yielded high FRET efficiency. We called Picchu-236 simply Picchu, and we used it in the following experiments. To confirm that the increase in the emission ratio of 527/475 nm was caused by FRET, we digested Picchu with proteinase K. Because GFP and its mutants are resistant to proteinase K, this treatment will generate monomeric YFP and CFP (23Miyawaki A. Tsien R.Y. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 327: 472-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 C, proteinase K treatment completely obliterated the emission peak at 527 nm, proving that the emission peak of 527 nm was caused by FRET (Fig.1 C). Next, we confirmed by the use of two mutants, Picchu-R38V and Picchu-Y221F, that the increase in FRET was due to the intramolecular binding of the SH2 domain to the phosphorylated Tyr221. In Picchu-R38V, we replaced Arg38 with Val, which is an amino acid residue in the SH2 domain and is critical for the recognition of the phosphotyrosine. In Picchu-Y221F, Tyr221 was replaced with Phe. Picchu, Picchu-Y221F, and Picchu-R38V were expressed in 293T cells with or without c-Abl. We examined the FRET efficiency and the phosphorylation of these proteins (Fig. 1, D andE). c-Abl did not phosphorylate Picchu-Y221F or increase its FRET efficiency, which is expressed as the emission-intensity ratio of YFP to CFP. In contrast, c-Abl phosphorylated Picchu-R38V on tyrosine but did not increase its FRET efficiency. Thus, the intramolecular binding of the SH2 domain to the phosphorylated Tyr221caused an increase in the FRET efficiency of Picchu. Next, we examined the emission ratio of 530 ± 10 nm versus 475 ± 10 nm in living HT1080 cells expressing Picchu, Picchu-Y221F, or Picchu-R38V, with or without c-Abl. In the following figures, the cell images are presented in an intensity-modulated display mode, which associates color hue with emission ratio value and the intensity of each hue with the source image brightness. We found that Picchu was distributed evenly in the cells, including the nucleus. The distribution was very similar among Picchu, Picchu-Y221F, and Picchu-R38V (Fig. 2 A). As we observed in vitro, the FRET efficiency of Picchu, but not of Picchu-Y221F or Picchu-R38V, was increased in the presence of c-Abl. To confirm that the increase in the emission ratio was due to FRET, we photo-bleached YFP, which was expected to inactivate the photo-acceptor and to increase the emission from CFP. The result was exactly as we expected, confirming FRET from CFP to YFP (Fig. 2 B). We next stimulated Picchu-expressing COS-1 cells with EGF, because its cognate receptor (EGFR) is known to phosphorylate CrkII on Tyr221 (15Hashimoto Y. Katayama H. Kiyokawa E. Ota S. Kurata T. Gotoh N. Shibata M. Otsuka N. Matsuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17186-17191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Upon EGF stimulation, Picchu, but not Picchu-Y221F, was phosphorylated on tyrosine, concomitant with an increase in the FRET efficiency (Fig.3 A). Of note, the emission ratio of Picchu was increased only in the cytoplasm, but not in the nucleus, indicating that localization of phosphorylated Picchu was limited to the cytoplasm. To confirm that the increase in the emission ratio of Picchu was caused by FRET, we photo-bleached the acceptor, YFP, before EGF stimulation. As expected, only the nonphotobleached cells showed an increase in the emission ratio upon EGF stimulation (Fig. 3 B). We next examined whether the phosphorylation and FRET efficiency of Picchu correlated with the phosphorylation of the endogenous CrkII. Phosphorylation of both the endogenous CrkII and Picchu peaked at 10 min after EGF stimulation and returned to the basal level within 30 min in Picchu-expressing COS-1 cells. (Fig.4 A). Then, in a similar condition, we monitored FRET efficiency by dual emission fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 4, B and C, and supplementary material). The emission ratio of YFP to CFP started increasing within 1 min, reached to a plateau at 10 min, and returned to the basal level within 30 min. Thus, the emission ratio of YFP to CFP in Picchu-expressing cells faithfully reflected the phosphorylation status of the endogenous CrkII. We then confirmed the requirement of tyrosine kinase activity of EGFR by the use of a specific inhibitor, AG1478. As shown in Fig. 5 A, AG1478, but not PP2, an inhibitor specific for Src family tyrosine kinases, inhibited the EGF-induced increase in FRET. We further examined EGF-induced CrkII phosphorylation in various cell types (Fig. 5 B). Phosphorylation of CrkII, as judged by the increased emission ratio of Picchu, was observed in NIH3T3 cells, A431 epidermal carcinoma cells, and P13 cells upon EGF stimulation. P13 cells were mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from a c-abl-deficient mouse; therefore, this observation showed that c-Abl was dispensable for EGF-dependent phosphorylation. Under the conditions described above, we did not see any localized increase or decrease in the FRET efficiency within the cytoplasm. This appeared to be caused by rapid diffusion of Picchu, which was confirmed by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. 2K. Kurokawa and M. Matsuda, unpublished results. Therefore, to restrict the movement of the probe, we prepared Picchu-X, which contained the CAAX box of Ki-Ras at the carboxyl terminus of CFP. As shown in Fig. 6 A, Picchu-X was localized mostly at the plasma membrane, whereas the prototype Picchu was localized diffusely in the cytoplasm. Owing to the reduction of the large pool of the nonphosphorylated form in the cytoplasm, Picchu-X showed significant improvement in sensitivity and time resolution. For the detection of EGF-induced phosphorylation of CrkII, Picchu required 10 ng/ml EGF, whereas less than 5 ng/ml was sufficient for Picchu-X (Fig. 6 B). The EGF-induced increase in FRET efficiency reached a maximum within 2 min in Picchu-X-expressing cells, whereas it took about 10 min for Picchu-expressing cells to reach a plateau (Fig. 6 C). Furthermore, this improvement in sensitivity and time resolution enabled us to observe where the CrkII phosphorylation was initiated. Within 40 s after the addition of EGF, the increase in the emission ratio started at the periphery and then moved toward the perinuclear region (Fig. 7 and supplementary material).Figure 7Improved space resolution by the use of CAAX-box fused probe. COS-1 cells expressing Picchu-X were serum-starved and analyzed by dual emission fluorescence microscopy as in Fig. 2. The cell was stimulated with 10 ng/ml EGF, and IMD images were obtained every 20 s. Representative IMD images and a phase contract image of the pre-EGF stimulation are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) For delineating the signal transduction cascades in cells, it is essential to develop probes for spacio-temporal information on the activity of each signaling molecule. Antibodies specific to the phosphorylated form of signaling molecules such as anti-phospho-CrkII antibody are successfully used for such a purpose (15Hashimoto Y. Katayama H. Kiyokawa E. Ota S.

FRET-based monitors are also used for detecting the activation of the signaling molecules. For example, CrkII labeled with fluorophore in vitro has been developed for detecting the conformational change in CrkII by phosphorylation (21Cotton G.J. Muir T.W. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 253-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, use of these probes in vivo is very limited because of the difficulty in their delivery into the cells. The development of a pair of GFP mutants that served as donor and acceptor overcame this problem and generated in vivo sensors for calcium (27Miyawaki A. Llopis J. Heim R. McCaffery J.M. Adams J.A. Ikura M. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1997; 388: 882-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (2650) Google Scholar), cAMP (28Zaccolo M. De Giorgi F. Cho C.Y. Feng L. Knapp T. Negulescu P.A. Taylor S.S. Tsien R.Y. Pozzan T.

Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 313-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), Rac (31Kraynov V.S. Chamberlain C. Bokoch G.M. Schwartz M.A. Slabaugh S. Hahn K.M. Science. 2000; 290: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar), and Ras (32Mochizuki N. Yamashita S. Kurokawa K. Ohba Y. Nagai T. Miyawaki A. Matsuda M. Nature. 2001; 411: 1065-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). After these successes, the development of Picchu showed that GFP-based FRET technology can be applied to the detection of the conformational change induced by tyrosine phosphorylation. Previously, we reported that tyrosine-phosphorylated CrkII accumulated at the membrane ruffles upon EGF stimulation (15Hashimoto Y. Katayama H. Kiyokawa E. Ota S. Kurata T. Gotoh N. Shibata M. Otsuka N. Matsuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17186-17191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, in this study, we found that an increase in the FRET efficiency of Picchu occurs not only at the membrane ruffles but also in the cytoplasm. This apparent discrepancy may be explained as follows. Staining with anti-phospho-CrkII antibody reflects the net amount of phosphorylated CrkII, whereas the FRET efficiency of Picchu reflects the ratio of phosphorylated versus nonphosphorylated CrkII proteins. Thus, although CrkII is accumulated at the membrane ruffling sites, the ratio of phosphorylated versus nonphosphorylated CrkII may not differ significantly between the cytoplasm and the membrane ruffles. This interpretation agrees with our previous proposal that CrkII translocates to the plasma membrane upon EGF stimulation and passes from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm upon phosphorylation by the EGF receptor (15Hashimoto Y. Katayama H. Kiyokawa E. Ota S. Kurata T. Gotoh N. Shibata M. Otsuka N. Matsuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17186-17191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A problem with probes using CFP and YFP as the FRET pair is the large leakage of donor emission in the acceptor channel at 535 nm (23Miyawaki A. Tsien R.Y. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 327: 472-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Hence, the excess of probes causes significant deterioration in detecting a signal-induced increase in FRET efficiency. Many SH2-containing signaling proteins, including CrkII, are localized mostly in the cytoplasm and translocate to the plasma membrane upon stimulation by growth factors (33Pawson T. Gish G.D. Cell. 1992; 71: 359-362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). On these backgrounds, we could successfully improve Picchu in its sensitivity to EGF-induced phosphorylation by restricting its distribution to the plasma membrane. It should be kept in mind, however, that the CAAX-fused Picchu reflects the phosphorylation status of CrkII at the plasma membrane. Therefore, authentic Picchu can be used for monitoring the level of net phosphorylation of CrkII, whereas CAAX-fused Picchu should be used for examining the ongoing phosphorylation status of CrkII. Use of this pair of Picchu probes will shed light on the role of the CrkII adaptor protein in the physiologic signaling. We thank J. Miyazaki and B. J. Mayer for plasmids and K. Nagai, F. Ohba, N.

The two isoforms, RalA and RalB, are widely distributed in different tissues, with RalA being enriched in brain. The best characterized RalA signaling pathways involve RalBP1 and phospholipase D. To investigate RalA signaling in neuronal cells we searched for RalA-binding proteins in brain. We found at least eight proteins that bound RalA in a GTP-dependent manner. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) identified these as the components of the exocyst complex. The yeast exocyst is a regulator of polarized secretion, docking vesicles to regions of the plasma membrane involved in active exocytosis. We identified the human FLJ10893 protein as the mammalian homologue of the yeast exocyst protein Sec3p. The exocyst complex did not contain the previously identified exocyst component rSec15, but a new homologue of both yeast Sec15p and rSec15, called KIAA0919.

In the GTP-bound state they interact with target proteins (effectors) to initiate downstream responses. Their signal transduction is terminated by an intrinsic GTPase activity, returning them to the GDP-bound state. Two Ral genes exist in vertebrates, RalA and RalB, sharing 85% amino acid identity (1Chardin P. Tavitian A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4380Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Both proteins have a wide, partly overlapping, tissue distribution, with highest expression of RalA in brain and platelets and of RalB in platelets, kidney, and adrenal medulla (2Bhullar R.P. Yang S. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 179: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Both isoforms are found predominantly on the plasma membrane (3Jilkina O. Bhullar R.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1314: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and on the membranes of secretory vesicles, and RalA is found particularly on the membranes of synaptic vesicles in brain (4Bielinski D.F. Pyun H.Y. Linko-Stentz K. Macara I.G. Fine R.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1151: 246-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The enrichment of RalA in brain and its localization to synaptic vesicles suggests a role in vesicle trafficking events in the nerve terminal. Ral activation has mainly been characterized in the downstream signaling pathways from activated receptor-linked tyrosine kinases and seven-transmembrane domain receptors, which lead to the activation of Ras (5Reuther G.W. Der C.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Activation of small GTPases is achieved via guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs)1 that facilitate exchange of GDP for GTP. The best known Ral activating pathway is via Ras activating the RalGEF and Ras effector protein Ral guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator (RalGDS), but Ras-independent mechanisms for Ral activation are likely (5Reuther G.W.

Biol. 1998; 8: 839-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ca2+ activates calmodulin, and the complex directly binds to a polybasic region near the C terminus of RalA (8Wang K.L. Khan M.T. Roufogalis B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16002-16009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Ca2+-calmodulin binding stimulates GTP binding to RalA, suggesting that it is a RalA activator (9Wang K.L. Roufogalis B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14525-14528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In vitro studies suggest that Ca2+-calmodulin controls RalA subcellular localization, since binding dissociates RalA from synaptic vesicles (10Park J.B. Lee J.Y. Kim J.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 765-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). RalA downstream signaling is mediated by two additional protein-protein interaction sites. The first binds phospholipase D1 (PLD1) via an N-terminal 11 amino acid sequence. Ral weakly stimulates PLD1 activity but operates synergistically with another small GTPase, Arf (11Luo J.Q. Liu X. Frankel P. Rotunda T. Ramos M. Flom J. Jiang H. Feig L.A. Morris A.J. Kahn R.A. Foster D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3632-3637Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). PLD1 binding to RalA is independent of the nucleotide binding status of RalA, but signaling pathways that lead to RalA activation also lead to phosphatidic acid production by PLD (12Shen Y. Xu L. Foster D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The second is an effector binding loop, which mediates interaction of proteins with RalA in a GTP-dependent manner. Two proteins are known to interact with RalA in this fashion, leading to RalA-dependent cellular effects. Ral-binding protein 1 or RalBP1 (13Cantor S.B. Urano T. Feig L.A. Mol. Cell.

The second is filamin, an actin filament cross-linking protein that mediates filopodia formation in neurites (16Ohta Y. Suzuki N. Nakamura S. Hartwig J.H. Stossel T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2122-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Other small GTPases like Rho, Rac, or Cdc42 have about 30 identified potential GTP-dependent binding proteins (17Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1655) Google Scholar); however, only two are presently known for RalA. To better understand RalA-mediated signaling pathways in neuronal cells our aim was to identify new RalA-binding proteins in brain. We report on the identification of eight specific GTP-dependent RalA-binding proteins, which are proteins that comprise the mammalian exocyst complex. The exocyst was first described in yeast as a complex of eight proteins (Sec3p, Sec5p, Sec6p, Sec8p, Sec10p, Sec15p, Exo70p, and Exo84p) required for targeted exocytosis (18TerBush D.R. Maurice T.

At least three of these proteins are able to associate directly with three different small GTPases in yeast (20Harsay E. Bretscher A. J.

The bacterial expression vector containing the wild-type RalA sequence fused to glutathioneS-transferase (GST), pGEX-2T-RalA, was provided by Yoshito Kaziro (Yokohama, Japan). This vector was transformed intoEscherichia coli by heat shock. GST-RalA bound to GSH beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions with the inclusion of 2.5 mmMgCl2 in all buffers. Crude synaptosomes (P2) were isolated from three rats as described previously (27Robinson P.J. Dunkley P.R. J. Neurochem. 1983; 41: 909-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and lysed with Triton X-100 by resuspension in ice-cold lysis buffer (1% v/v Triton X-100, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 20 µg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Whole rat tissue lysates were prepared by mincing 2 g of tissue, washing in phosphate-buffered saline, and homogenizing equal tissue weights in lysis buffer. All homogenates were centrifuged at 75,600 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Protein-balanced aliquots of the supernatant were precleared by the addition of GSH-Sepharose for 30 min, pelleted at 50 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected. GST-RalA beads were loaded with guanine nucleotides using established methods (13Cantor S.B. Urano T. Feig L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4578-4584Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). A volume of GSH beads containing ∼10 µg of GST-RalA was incubated with an equal volume of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA, 25 mm NaCl, and 1 mm GDP or GTP at 37 °C for 20 min. The buffer was adjusted to 10 mm MgCl2, then the tissue lysates were added and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were isolated by centrifugation at 50 × g for 5 min, transferred to small empty spin columns (ProbeQuant G-50 Micro-columns, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and washed three times with ice-cold lysis buffer followed by three washes with 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 2.5 mm MgCl2. The samples were heated to 85 °C in SDS sample buffer for 5 min and collected into fresh tubes by centrifugation at 17,000 × g for 1 min. Samples were run on SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. For some experiments a cytosolic extract was prepared from 70 g of sheep brain. Diced brain was washed with 20 mm Tris, pH 7.7, and homogenized in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.7, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride using an Ultra Turrax T25 homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 18,500 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The extract was adjusted to 3 mm EGTA (to chelate the Ca2+). Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 12% acrylamide minigels (Bio-Rad) and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (28Towbin H. Staehlin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44642) Google Scholar). Proteins were detected by chemiluminescence (LumiLight from Roche). Protein bands were excised from Coomassie Blue-stained gels, rinsed with water, and destained with several washes of 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate in 50% acetonitrile. The gel pieces were dehydrated with 100% acetonitrile and dried in a centrifugal evaporator. Sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega; 12.5 ng/µl in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0) was added for 1 h at 4 °C and then incubated overnight at 37 °C. The resulting peptide mixture was collected and concentrated to a minimal volume in the centrifugal evaporator. An aliquot of the peptide mixture (1 µl) was spotted onto the MALDI target plate and overlaid with 1 µl of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid solution (20 mg/ml in 100% acetonitrile). A Voyager-DE STR MALDI mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) equipped with delayed extraction was employed for peptide mass mapping in positive reflector mode. Peptide mass maps were searched against theoretically derived maps from proteins in the nonredundant protein data base (NCBI) using the ProFound online program (www.proteometrics.com). Theoretical digests were obtained through the online MS-Digest program (prospector.ucsf.edu). Similarity searches against the nonredundant protein data base were performed using BLAST from NCBI. Proteins were aligned using AntheProt version 5.0 software (pbil.ibcp.fr/∼deleage/) or ClustalW at EBI (www2.ebi.ac.uk). To identify possible new RalA effector proteins, recombinant GST-RalA, coupled to GSH-Sepharose, was loaded with either GDP or GTP and used as an affinity matrix to isolate RalA-binding proteins from various rat tissue Triton X-100 lysates (Fig. 1). This approach isolates GDP- or GTP-dependent RalA-binding proteins, as well as proteins that might associate with these binding proteins. Recombinant GST coupled to GSH-Sepharose was used as controls in parallel experiments to provide a further degree of specificity (data not shown). Four main proteins interacted specifically with GTP-bound GST-RalA, compared with GDP-bound RalA in a preparation of rat brain nerve terminals (synaptosomes, Fig. 1 A, lanes 1and 2). These were also abundant in whole brain lysates (lanes 3 and 4), but were much less evident in testis, lung, liver, and kidney (lanes 5–12). Protein 4, however, was present in testis and lung (lanes 6 and8). While at least three proteins appeared to specifically associate with GDP-bound RalA compared with GTP-RalA in synaptosomes or brain (lanes 1 and 3) and in kidney (lane 11), the GDP dependence of this association was not reproducible in other experiments. Further pull-down experiments using larger amounts of whole brain lysate yielded a number of additional proteins that bound in a GTP-dependent manner and which were previously undetectable by Coomassie Blue (Fig. 1 B). Apart from the four major bands six minor GTP-dependent bands were detectable (marked with smaller arrows). Note that bands 1 and 2 were not fully resolved on this gel, but their identities were later confirmed by mass spectrometry to be the same as bands 1 and 2 of panel A (data not shown). This results in a total of 10 GTP-dependent RalA-binding proteins in whole rat brain. MALDI-TOF MS was utilized to identify the proteins that associated with GTP-bound RalA. Unambiguous identification was achieved with all of the four major RalA-binding proteins from synaptosomes and rat brain (Fig.1 A); however, none of the minor bands yielded unambiguous identification at this stage. Proteins 1–4 were identified as rat Sec8 (rSec8), human hypothetical protein FLJ10893, rSec5, and rSec6, respectively. Three of these were previously found to be components of the mammalian exocyst complex (23Ting A.E. Hazuka C.D. Hsu S.C. Kirk M.D. Bean A.J. Scheller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

First, to obtain a much larger quantity of extract from brain, we changed species to sheep. Second, we used only a cytosolic extract rather than whole brain, as preliminary experiments suggested the GTP-dependent binding proteins were predominantly cytosolic (data not shown). Note that the migration of some of these proteins in SDS-PAGE did not exactly match that found in rat brain. Eight distinct GTP-dependent bands were detected. MALDI-TOF MS identified all eight proteins as components of the exocyst complex (Fig.2 A). A representative MALDI-TOF MS peptide mass map obtained for one of the mammalian exocyst proteins, rSec8, is shown in Fig.2 B. A large proportion of the peptide signals were contributed by rSec8, yielding a statistically significant match with a probability of greater than 99% (TableI). A number of the other signals in the spectrum were attributed to tryptic peptides from FLJ10893 (the adjacent protein to rSec8 on the gel), GST-RalA, trypsin autolytic peptides, and keratin. Similar high quality spectra were achieved for all eight gel bands (data not shown), and probability scores for the identities of the protein bands are shown in Table I. The purified exocyst complex is known to contain at least eight proteins (23Ting A.E. Hazuka C.D. Hsu S.C. Kirk M.D. Bean A.J. Scheller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, the identification of Sec3 and Sec15 required further analysis (see below). A number of the proteins that bound RalA in a nucleotide-independent manner were identified as polymers of GST-RalA (94 and 112 kDa, Fig. 2 A, and four additional proteins migrating as high as 150 kDa (data not shown)). The basis for the appearance of the polymers is unknown, but polymers have been reported by others (29Doucet A. Beauregard M. Anal.

Open table in a new tab Molecular mass of the proteins from sheep is shown on the left. The preceding letters r, h, and m refer to rat, mouse, and human species, respectively. Statistical significance is determined at a probability of ≥95%. The identification of the exocyst as a GTP-dependent RalA binding complex by MALDI-TOF MS was confirmed by Western blotting with specific antibodies to exocyst complex proteins (Fig.3). Western blots of proteins from pull-down experiments using rat synaptosome lysates revealed that rSec8 and rSec6 bound to GST-RalA in a GTP-dependent manner (lanes 2 and 3). Neither was detectable in the control pull-down using only GST coupled to GSH-beads (lane 1). rSec6 was also detected in samples of whole brain or testis lysate. To validate our method for the detection of RalA-binding proteins, we used immunoblots to detect two previously reported major RalA-binding proteins. RalBP1 is a known GTP-dependent RalA-binding protein (13Cantor S.B. Urano T. Feig L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4578-4584Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), and PLD is known to associate with RalA independently of its nucleotide-bound state (30Luo J.Q. Liu X. Hammond S.M. Colley W.C. Feig L.A. Frohman M.A. Morris A.J. Foster D.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 854-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Both proteins were appropriately detected in the pull-down experiments using rat brain synaptosomes (Fig. 3). The sequence of the mammalian exocyst protein that is homologous to yeast sec3p has not previously been reported. However it was proposed to represent the rat brain exocyst p106 protein, and limited amino acid sequence for p106 was previously published (24Hsu S.C. Ting A.E. Hazuka C.D. Davanger S. Kenny J.W. Kee Y. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1996; 17: 1209-1219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). In our study the hypothetical human protein FLJ10893 (GenBankTM accession number NP_060731) was identified as part of the complex binding to RalA in a GTP-dependent manner. FLJ10893 is the only protein in the complex we identified that was not recognized as a homologue of one of the yeast exocyst proteins, but has a predicted mass corresponding to p106. Therefore, we used bioinformatic tools to determine whether FLJ10893 could be the mammalian homologue of yeast sec3p. Alignment of amino acid sequences of FLJ10893 and yeast sec3p (which is 442 amino acids longer (144 kDa (18TerBush D.R. Maurice T. Roth D. Novick P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6483-6494Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar)) yielded significant identity (14% identical residues using the PAM250 matrix, Fig.4). Other yeast-mammalian exocyst proteins exhibit about 12–21% overall identity. FLJ10893 is the only human protein in the nonredundant data base with significant identity to yeast Sec3p. BLAST searches were used to establish an evolutionary relationship between FLJ10893 and yeast Sec3p. Significant matches were obtained to uncharacterized gene products from several species:Mus musculus AK013041 (E value = e−129, 97% identity and 98% similarity),Drosophila melanogaster CG3885 (E value = e−180, 40% identity and 60% similarity),Caenorhabditis elegans F52E4.7 (E value = e−125 33% identity and 52% similarity), andArabidopsis thaliana A007519 (E value = e−53, 23% identity and 42% similarity). In each case, no other gene products were related. We conclude that each of these proteins represents a FLJ10893 homologue in each of these species. We next investigated the relationship between these genes and the entire yeast genome. Only one significant match was found for each of these genes, yeast Sec3p (for D. melanogaster CG3885: Evalue = 6e−7, 19% identity and 38% similarity, Fig.4). Finally, we searched for amino acid sequences of tryptic peptides obtained previously for the rat brain exocyst protein p106 to determine whether they were found in FLJ10893 (24Hsu S.C. Ting A.E. Hazuka C.D. Davanger S. Kenny J.W. Kee Y. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1996; 17: 1209-1219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Two of the six peptides from p106 closely match FLJ10893: ELPEFNLHFF (FLJ1089386ENPEFDLHFE94) and xLQDVDLASxR (FLJ10893289ALQEGDLASSR299) (overlined in Fig. 4). Thus, the hypothetical human protein FLJ10893 likely represents the first description of a mammalian homologue of the yeast Sec3p protein. The GTP-dependent RalA-binding protein that corresponds to the yeast exocyst complex protein Sec15p was identified as KIAA0919 protein with a >99% probability by MALDI-TOF MS. A rat Sec15p homologue has previously been cloned (25Kee Y. Yoo J.S. Hazuka C.D. Peterson K.E. Hsu S.C. Scheller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14438-14443Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), but surprisingly only a nonsignificant match (>80% probability) was obtained by MALDI-TOF MS for this protein in our study. With the view that KIAA0919 may be a new human variant of rSec15, we searched the human nonredundant data base using the sequence of rSec15 for similar proteins. One human entry (GenBankTM accession number CAB70736) was 93% identical to rSec15 (although it is truncated by 250 amino acids at the N terminus). Therefore CAB70736 represents the human form of rSec15, and we called it hSec15A. KIAA0919 was only 67% identical and 79% similar torSec15, indicating that it is a second Sec15gene, which we named hSec15B. hSec15A and hSec15B share 66% identity and 75% similarity. The hSec15B/KIAA0919 nucleotide sequence lacks a defined start codon, suggesting that it is an incomplete sequence. Therefore, the existence of a rat protein product for hSec15B/KIAA0919 is possible, but so far uncharacterized. When we compared the peptides from rat brain exocyst complex protein p96 from Hsu et al. (24Hsu S.C. Ting A.E. Hazuka C.D. Davanger S. Kenny J.W. Kee Y. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1996; 17: 1209-1219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) with hSec15B/KIAA0919, three out of five peptides matched better to the hSec15B/KIAA0919 sequence than to the sequence of rSec15. We conclude that there are two human orthologues of yeast Sec15p and that we have identified hSec15B/KIAA0919 as the Sec15 component of the exocyst complex that interacts with RalA. The main finding of this study is that the GTPase RalA interacts with at least eight proteins in brain in a GTP-dependent manner. Eight of these were identified either as known components of the mammalian exocyst complex or as homologues of known exocyst proteins. Therefore the exocyst is a novel effector for RalA. We also report the first identification of the mammalian Sec3 protein and show that mammalian Sec15 exists as at least two gene products,hSec15Aand hSec15B. Sec3p and Sec15p are two of the three yeast exocyst proteins known to bind small GTPases, these being Rho1p and Sec4p, respectively (20Harsay E. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 297-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 22Guo W. Tamanoi F. Novick P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The exocyst complex was initially characterized in yeast as a multiprotein complex thought to be involved in polarized secretion and which localizes to sites of active exocytosis in bud tips (18TerBush D.R. Maurice T. Roth D. Novick P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6483-6494Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). The yeast exocyst complex consists of eight characterized proteins, named Sec3p, Sec8p, Sec15p, Sec5p, Sec10p, Sec6p, Exo84p, and Exo70p, of molecular masses 144, 131, 113, 107, 100, 88, 84, and 70 kDa, respectively (18TerBush D.R. Maurice T. Roth D. Novick P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6483-6494Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar, 19Guo W. Grant A. Novick P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23558-23564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Specific mutations in these proteins lead to a phenotypic temperature-sensitive deficiency in invertase secretion and an accumulation of secretory vesicles in the cytoplasm (31Novick P. Field C. Schekman R. Cell. 1980; 21: 205-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar). The mammalian exocyst complex was later characterized from rat brain and also found to be composed of a corresponding set of eight proteins (24Hsu S.C. Ting A.E. Hazuka C.D. Davanger S. Kenny J.W. Kee Y. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1996; 17: 1209-1219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Seven of the exocyst genes have been cloned from rat brain, and these were named rSec8, rSec5, rSec15, rSec6, rExo84, rExo70, and rSec10, with molecular masses 110, 102, 96, 86, 84, 79, and 71 kDa, respectively (23Ting A.E. Hazuka C.D. Hsu S.C. Kirk M.D. Bean A.J. Scheller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9613-9617Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 25Kee Y. Yoo J.S. Hazuka C.D. Peterson K.E. Hsu S.C. Scheller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14438-14443Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). An eighth protein of 106 kDa has also been found in the purified exocyst and is likely to be a mammalian homologue of the yeast Sec3p, but it is yet to be cloned (24Hsu S.C. Ting A.E. Hazuka C.D. Davanger S. Kenny J.W. Kee Y. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1996; 17: 1209-1219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The finding that the exocyst complex associates with RalA in a GTP-dependent manner was confirmed in three independent approaches in our study. Initially, four major and six minor proteins were detected in whole rat brain lysates. The four major proteins were readily identified by MALDI-TOF MS tryptic peptide mass mapping as rSec8, FLJ10893, rSec5, and rSec6. The six minor proteins have yet to be identified from rat, but likely candidates are RalBP1 and the remaining four exocyst proteins. Second, scaled up experiments with sheep brain cytosol resulted in clear tryptic peptide mass maps from all eight sheep proteins. Six were known exocyst proteins and two were novel genes, which we established as related to exocyst proteins. Identification of proteins by peptide mass mapping uses data drawn from the entire nonredundant data base. Thus, rSec8, hSec5, hExo84, rSec6, mExo70, and hSec10 were identified from either rat and sheep brain as statistically significant matches, despite that some of these are human (h) or mouse (m) sequences. This method is readily able to identify proteins from different species if the sequences are sufficiently identical (such as between different mammalian species for example) (32Larsen M.R. Roepstorff P. Fresenius' J. Anal. Chem. 2000; 366: 677-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Third, rSec8 and rSec6 were confirmed by Western blotting to bind to RalA in a GTP-dependent manner. Apart from the known exocyst proteins, two additional proteins were also identified by mass spectrometry: both are hypothetical sequences from the human genome that have not been otherwise characterized. One identifies a candidate human Sec3 protein as FLJ10893 and the other is a second humanSec15gene, hSec15B/KIAA0919. A mammalian homologue of yeast Sec3p is the only exocyst protein not previously cloned from vertebrates. Sec3p in yeast may anchor the exocyst to the plasma membrane, and has been termed a “spatial landmark” for polarized secretion (33Finger F.P. Novick P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 647-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 34Finger F.P. Hughes T.E. Novick P. Cell. 1998; 92: 559-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). We matched the peptide mass maps of a sheep brain 100-kDa protein to human FLJ10893, which has sequence similarity to yeast sec3p. The identification of FLJ10893 as a candidate mammalian Sec3 was supported by its similar molecular mass, sequence homology, and that amino acid sequences from the rat exocyst protein p106 (24Hsu S.C. Ting A.E. Hazuka C.D. Davanger S. Kenny J.W. Kee Y. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1996; 17: 1209-1219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) also closely match FLJ10893. However, this identification needs to be confirmed by cloning the equivalent gene from rat or sheep. Two Sec15genes were identified in this study. Sec15from rat was previously cloned (25Kee Y. Yoo J.S. Hazuka C.D. Peterson K.E. Hsu S.C. Scheller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14438-14443Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), and we found a human homologue from GenBankTM, which we named hSec15A/CAB70736. However, the MS data did not identify the 92-kDa component of the RalA-binding exocyst complex as Sec15A. The statistically significant match was to KIAA0919, a novel homologue of Sec15, which we named hSec15B/KIAA0919. The proteins are 72% identical in their core region, but have distinct N- or C-terminal extensions. Furthermore, aligning the rat tryptic peptide sequences obtained by Hsu et al.(24Hsu S.C. Ting A.E. Hazuka C.D. Davanger S. Kenny J.W. Kee Y. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1996; 17: 1209-1219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) with hSec15B/KIAA0919 produces a much better match than to hSec15A/CAB70736 or to rSec15. This raises the possibility that the mammalian Sec15 exists in two forms and that the B form is a component of the exocyst complex that interacts with RalA. Other mammalian exocyst proteins may arise from multiple genes, for example Sec6 and B94 (25Kee Y. Yoo J.S. Hazuka C.D. Peterson K.E. Hsu S.C. Scheller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14438-14443Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). RalA is the first mammalian protein shown to interact with the exocyst in a GTP-dependent manner. It is unlikely that RalA interacts with all eight proteins, but the specific exocyst protein target for RalA has not been determined. Specific components of the yeast exocyst are known to associate with at least three small GTPases. Sec4p (the yeast equivalent of Rab3A) anchors the complex to secretory vesicles via Sec15p (20Harsay E. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 297-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), Rho1p anchors it to the plasma membrane via Sec3p (22Guo W. Tamanoi F. Novick P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), and Rho3p binds Exo70p (21Robinson N.G. Guo L. Imai J. Toh E. Matsui Y. Tamanoi F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3580-3587Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As there is no yeast equivalent of Ral (the closest related proteins being the Ras proteins) it is difficult to speculate on a function for the RalA-exocyst interaction based on the known small GTPase-exocyst interactions in yeast. RalA is localized both on secretory vesicles and on the plasma membrane (3Jilkina O. Bhullar R.P. Biochim. Biophys.

Commun. 1999; 263: 765-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Therefore, it will be important to determine whether the mammalian RalA-exocyst interaction might mimic the yeast Sec15p-Sec4p interaction in tethering the complex to synaptic vesicles, the Sec3p-Rho1p interaction in tethering the complex to the plasma membrane, or whether there is a novel function. Our results localize the exocyst and most of the known Ral signaling pathway to nerve terminals, which are regions of neuronal cells highly adapted for secretory roles. RalA regulates receptor-mediated endocytosis in nonneuronal cells via its effector RalBP1 (14Nakashima S. Morinaka K. Koyama S. Ikeda M. Kishida M. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kishida S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3629-3642Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Another protein directly activated by RalA is PLD1, which is also required for endocytosis (12Shen Y. Xu L. Foster D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Our results localize these two signaling pathways to nerve terminals, sites of extremely active synaptic vesicle endocytosis, but it remains to be demonstrated whether RalA has an endocytic role in the nerve terminal. Our finding that the exocyst is another effector for RalA localizes this complex to the mature nerve terminal. The complex was previously localized to growth cones of axons and dendrites in developing neurons, in discrete domains along the axon, and in most newly formed nerve terminals (36Hazuka C.D. Foletti D.L. Hsu S.C. Kee Y. Hopf F.W. Scheller R.H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1324-1334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The likely role for the mammalian exocyst in the development of nerve terminal exocytosis and the established role for RalA in endocytosis places RalA in a unique situation where it potentially regulates both, although not necessarily during the same stage of development. Exocytosis and endocytosis in nerve terminals is Ca2+-dependent, and RalA is also activated by Ca2+-calmodulin (8Wang K.L. Khan M.T. Roufogalis B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16002-16009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 9Wang K.L. Roufogalis B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14525-14528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Thus, the possible role of RalA in synaptic vesicle recycling in neurons now needs to be more clearly established. A dynamic interaction of the exocyst with synaptic vesicle and plasma membrane-bound small GTPases is compatible with current views of the cellular function of the exocyst. RalA also recruits filamin in a GTP-dependent manner to specific sites on the plasma membrane and has been proposed to thereby induce filopodia formation (16Ohta Y. Suzuki N. Nakamura S. Hartwig J.H. Stossel T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2122-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). The exocyst complex is required for exocytosis and neurite outgrowth, and it localizes to filopodia and neurite growth cones. Therefore, RalA might be acting as a control point for the integration of receptor and calcium signaling with neurite outgrowth, endocytosis, and directing sites of exocytosis.

We have isolated a cDNA clone that corresponds to the internal amino acid sequences of the native enzyme purified from a cell suspension culture of opium poppy Papaver somniferum. The recombinant enzyme acetylated the 7-hydroxyl moiety of salutaridinol in the presence of acetyl-CoA. The apparent K m value for salutaridinol was determined to be 9 µm and 54 µm for acetyl-CoA. The gene transcript was detected in extracts from Papaver orientale and Papaver bracteatum in addition to P. somniferum. Genomic DNA gel blot analysis indicated that there is likely a single copy of this gene in the P. somniferum genome. The amino acid sequence of salutaridinol 7-O-acetyltransferase is most similar (37% identity) to that of deacetylvindoline acetyltransferase ofCatharanthus roseus. Salutaridinol 7-O-acetyltransferase is the second enzyme specific to morphine biosynthesis for which we have isolated a cDNA. Taken together with the other cDNAs cloned encoding norcoclaurine 6-O-methyltransferase, (S)-N-methylcoclaurine 3′-hydroxylase, the cytochrome P-450 reductase, and codeinone reductase, significant progress has been made toward accumulating genes of this pathway to enable the end goal of a biotechnological production of morphinan alkaloids.

The narcotic analgesic morphine and the antitussive and narcotic analgesic codeine are the most important physiologically active alkaloids from this plant. Nineteen total syntheses of morphine have been reported through 1999 (1Novak B.H. Hudlicky T. Reed J.W. Mulzer J. Trauner D. Curr. Org. Chem. 2000; 4: 343-362Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The most efficient synthesis of morphine proceeded on medium scale with an overall yield of 29% (2Rice K.C. J. Org. Chem. 1980; 45: 3135-3137Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Despite many years of excellent synthetic organic chemistry concentrated on morphinans, a commercially feasible total chemical synthesis has not yet been achieved for morphine or codeine. The enzymatic synthesis of morphine in P. somniferum has been almost completely elucidated by M. H. Zenk and co-workers and is summarized by Kutchan (3Kutchan T.M. Cordell G. The Alkaloids. Academic Press, San Diego1998: 257-316Google Scholar). Morphine is derived from two molecules of the amino acid l-tyrosine in a series of at least 17 enzymatic steps. The latter steps in the pathway that lead specifically from (S)-reticuline, a central intermediate of isoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis, to morphine involve three NADPH-dependent oxidoreductases (4De-Eknamkul W. Zenk M.H. Phytochemistry. 1992; 31: 813-821Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 5Gerardy R. Zenk M.H. Phytochemistry. 1993; 34: 125-132Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 6Lenz R. Zenk M.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 132-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), most probably three cytochromes P-450 (7Gerardy R. Zenk M.H. Phytochemistry. 1993; 32: 79-86Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and an acetyl-CoA-dependent acetyltransferase (8Lenz R. Zenk M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31091-31096Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Acetyl-CoA-dependent acetyltransferases have an important role in plant alkaloid metabolism. They are involved in the synthesis of monoterpenoid indole alkaloids in medicinal plant species such asRauwolfia serpentina. In this plant the enzyme vinorine synthase transfers an acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to 16-epi-vellosimine to form vinorine. This acetyl transfer is accompanied by a concomitant skeletal rearrangement from the sarpagan to the ajmalan type (9Pfitzner A. Stöckigt J. Tetrahedron Lett. 1983; 24: 5197-5200Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). An acetyl-CoA-dependent acetyltransferase also participates in vindoline biosynthesis inCatharanthus roseus, the source of the chemotherapeutic dimeric indole alkaloid vinblastine (10Fahn W. Gundlach H. Deus-Neumann B. Stöckigt J. Plant Cell Rep. 1985; 4: 333-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 11De Luca V. Balsevich J. Kurz W.G.W. J. Plant Physiol. 1985; 121: 417-428Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Acetyl-CoA:deacetylvindoline 4-O-acetyltransferase catalyzes the last step in vindoline biosynthesis. Central to morphine biosynthesis in P. somniferum is acetyl-CoA:salutaridinol 7-O-acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.150) (Fig.1). Acetylation of the phenanthrene salutaridinol is followed by allylic syn-displacement of the acetylated (activated) hydroxyl by the phenolic hydroxyl, which follows stereocontrol for SN2′ substitution of cyclohexene rings, thereby producing the pentacyclic morphinan ring system (8Lenz R. Zenk M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31091-31096Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Each of the known enzymes of morphine biosynthesis has been detected in both P. somniferum plants and cell suspension culture, yet plant cell cultures have never been shown to accumulate morphine or codeine (3Kutchan T.M. Cordell G. The Alkaloids. Academic Press, San Diego1998: 257-316Google Scholar). Morphine accumulation in the plant appears to be related to differentiation of a latex system (12Huang F.-C. Kutchan T.M. Phytochemistry. 2000; 53: 555-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In efforts aimed at the metabolic engineering of the P. somniferum alkaloid profile as well as at developing alternate biotechnological sources of morphinans, we searched first to identify suitable genetic targets. We report herein the molecular characterization of salutaridinol 7-O-acetyltransferase of morphine biosynthesis in P. somniferum. The native enzyme was purified to apparent homogeneity, amino acid sequences were determined for internal peptides, and a cDNA clone was generated by RT-PCR1 using P. somniferum mRNA as template. Heterologous expression in a baculovirus vector in insect cells yielded functional enzyme, and enzymic properties were determined for the recombinant protein. This is the second gene specific to morphine biosynthesis that has been isolated and characterized (13Unterlinner B. Lenz R. Kutchan T.M. Plant J. 1999; 18: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Cultured suspension cells of opium poppyP. somniferum were provided by the cell culture laboratories of the Lehrstuhl für Pharmazeutische Biologie and the Leibniz-Institut für Pflanzenbiochemie. Cultures were routinely grown in 1-liter conical flasks containing 400 ml of Linsmaier-Skoog medium (14Linsmaier E.M. Skoog F. Physiol. Plant. 1965; 18: 100-127Crossref Scopus (2855) Google Scholar) over 7 days at 23 °C on a gyratory shaker (100 rpm) in diffuse light (750 lux). Differentiated P. somniferum,Papaver bracteatum, Papaver orientale,Papaver nudicaule, Papaver atlanticum,Papaver rhoeas, and Chelidonium majus plants were grown outdoors in Upper Bavaria or in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. P. somniferum ssp. setigerum plants were grown in a greenhouse at 24 °C with 18 h of light and 50% humidity. Salutaridinol acetyltransferase was purified fromP. somniferum cell suspension cultures exactly according to Lenz and Zenk (8Lenz R. Zenk M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31091-31096Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The purified enzyme preparation was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to remove traces of impurities, and the Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250-visualized band representing the acetyltransferase was digested in situ with endoproteinase Lys-C as reported previously (15Dittrich H. Kutchan T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9969-9973Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 16Eckerskorn C. Lottspeich F. Chromatographia. 1989; 28: 92-94Crossref Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The peptide mixture was resolved by reversed phase HPLC (column, Merck Lichrospher RP18; 5 µm (4 × 125 mm); solvent system, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (A) and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 60% acetonitrile (B); gradient, 1% per min; flow rate, 1 ml min−1) with detection at 206 nm. Microsequencing of 10 of the peptides was accomplished on an Applied Biosystems model 470 gas-phase sequencer. Partial cDNAs encoding salutaridinol acetyltransferase from P. somniferum were produced by PCR using cDNA generated by reverse transcription of mRNA isolated from 7-day-old suspension-cultured cells. DNA amplification using eitherTaq or Pfu polymerase was performed under the following conditions: 3 min at 94 °C, 35 cycles of 94 °C, 30 s; 50 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 1 min. At the end of 35 cycles, the reaction mixtures were incubated for an additional 7 min at 72 °C prior to cooling to 4 °C. The amplified DNA was resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis, and the bands of approximately the correct size (537 bp) were isolated and subcloned into pGEM-T Easy (Promega) prior to nucleotide sequence determination. The specific sequences of the oligodeoxynucleotide primers used are given under “Results.” The sequence information requisite to the generation of a full-length cDNA was derived from the nucleotide sequence of the partial cDNA produced as described under “Results.” The complete nucleotide sequence was generated in two steps using one salutaridinol acetyltransferase-specific PCR primer (5′-GCC GCA GGC CAA CAA GGG TTG AGG TGG-3′ for 5′-RACE and 5′-CCC ATC CTG CAC CAG CTA CTT ATC C-3′ for 3′-RACE) and one RACE-specific primer as specified by the manufacturer. The 5′- and 3′-RACE-PCR experiments were carried out using a Marathon cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH). RACE-PCR was performed using the following PCR cycle: 3 min at 94 °C, 35 cycles of 94 °C, 30 s; 60 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 2 min. At the end of 35 cycles, the reaction mixtures were incubated for an additional 7 min at 72 °C prior to cooling to 4 °C. The amplified DNA was resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis, and the bands of the expected size (1265 bp for 5′-RACE and 917 bp for 3′-RACE) were isolated and subcloned into pGEM-T Easy prior to sequencing. The full-length clone was generated in one piece using the primers 5′-CCA TGG CAA CAA TGT ATA GTG CTG CT-3′ and 5′-AGA TCG AAT TCA ATA TCA AAT CAA TTC AAG G-3′ for PCR with P. somniferum cell suspension culture cDNA as template. The final primers used for cDNA amplification contained recognition sites for the restriction endonucleases NcoI and EcoRI appropriate for subcloning into pFastBac HTa (Life Technologies, Inc.) for functional expression. DNA amplification was performed under the following conditions: 3 min at 94 °C, 35 cycles of 94 °C, 30 s; 60 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 2 min. At the end of 35 cycles, the reaction mixtures were incubated for an additional 7 min at 72 °C prior to cooling to 4 °C. The amplified DNA was resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis, and the band of the approximately correct size (1440 bp) was isolated and subcloned into pCR4-TOPO (Invitrogen) prior to nucleotide sequence determination. The full-length cDNA generated by RT-PCR was ligated into pFastBac HTa that had been digested with restriction endonucleases NcoI and EcoRI. The recombinant plasmid was transposed into baculovirus DNA in the Escherichia coli strain DH10BAC (Life Technologies, Inc.) and then transfected into Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 cells according to the manufacturer's instructions. The insect cells were propagated, and the recombinant virus was amplified according to Kutchan et al. (17Kutchan T.M. Bock A. Dittrich H. Phytochemistry. 1994; 35: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and Pauli and Kutchan (18Pauli H. Kutchan T.M. Plant J. 1998; 13: 793-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). INSECT-XPRESS serum-free medium (Bio Whittaker) was used in the enzyme expression experiments. After infection of 150 ml of suspension grown insect cells had proceeded for 3–4 days at 28 °C and 130 rpm, the cells were removed by centrifugation under sterile conditions at 1000 × gfor 10 min at 4 °C. All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. The pellet was discarded, and the medium was slowly brought to 80% saturation with ammonium sulfate under constant slow stirring. The precipitated proteins were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellet was dissolved in a minimal volume of 0.5 m NaCl, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 2.5 mm imidazole, 20 mmTris-HCl adjusted finally to pH 7.0 and was dialyzed for 12–16 h against this same buffer. The His-tagged salutaridinol acetyltransferase was purified by affinity chromatography using a cobalt resin (Talon, CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The acetylation catalyzed by salutaridinol acetyltransferase was assayed according to Lenz and Zenk (8Lenz R. Zenk M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31091-31096Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture was extracted once with 1 volume of CHCl3 and was resolved by TLC (plates, silica gel 60 F254, Merck; solvent system, chloroform:acetone:diethylamine (5:4:1)). The radioactivity present on the TLC plates was localized and quantitated with a Rita Star TLC scanner (Raytest). The identity of the enzymic reaction product as thebaine was ascertained by HPLC-MS using a Finnigan MAT TSQ 7000 (electrospray voltage, 4.5 kV; capillary temperature, 220 °C; carrier gas, N2) coupled to a Micro-Tech Ultra-Plus Micro-LC equipped with an Ultrasep RP18 column (5 µm, 1 × 10 mm). The solvent system was 99.8% (v/v) H2O, 0.2% HOAc (A) and 99.8% CH3CN (v/v), 0.2% HOAc (B) with a gradient of 0–15 min 10–90% B, 15–25 min 90% B and a flow rate of 70 µl min−1). The positive ion electrospray mass spectrum for thebaine (retention time, 17.4 ± 0.1 min;m/z = 312) was characteristic of the standard reference compound. Latex was collected and resolved as described previously (19Roberts M.F. McCarthy D. Kutchan T.M. Coscia C.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 222: 599-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 20Decker G. Wanner G. Zenk M.H. Lottspeich F. Electrophoresis. 2000; 16: 3500-3516Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Low molecular weight compounds were removed from the supernatant of the resolved latex by passage through a PD 10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) into 20 mmTris, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.5. Total RNA was isolated, and RNA gels were run and blotted as described previously (18Pauli H. Kutchan T.M. Plant J. 1998; 13: 793-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA was isolated, and DNA gels were run and blotted according to Decker et al. (21Bracher D. Kutchan T.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 294: 717-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). cDNA clones were labeled by PCR labeling with [α-32P]dATP. Hybridized RNA on RNA gel blots and DNA on DNA gel blots were visualized with a STORM PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The entire nucleotide sequence on both DNA strands of the full-length clone was determined by dideoxy cycle sequencing using internal DNA sequences for the design of deoxyoligonucleotides as sequencing primers. Saturation curves and double reciprocal plots were constructed with the Fig. P program (Version 2.7, Biosoft, Cambridge, United Kingdom). The influence of pH on enzyme activity was monitored in sodium citrate- (pH 4–6), sodium phosphate- (pH 6–7.5), Tris-HCl- (pH 7.5–9), glycine/NaOH- (pH 9–10.5), and CAPS-buffered (pH 10–12) solutions. Salutaridinol 7-O-acetyltransferase was purified to apparent electrophoretic homogeneity from opium poppy cell suspension cultures, and the amino acid sequence of 10 endoproteinase Lys-C-generated peptides was determined. The sequences and relative positions of these internal peptides are indicated by unshaded boxes in Fig.2. A comparison of these amino acid sequences with those available in the GenBankTM/EMBL sequence data bases indicated no relevant similarity to known proteins. PCR primer pairs based on a series of salutaridinol 7-O-acetyltransferase peptide combinations also yielded only DNA fragments of irrelevant sequence. During the course of the initial RT-PCR experiments, sequence comparison information appeared in the literature for another acetyltransferase of plant alkaloid biosynthesis (22St-Pierre B. Laflamme P. Alarco A.-M. De Luca V. Plant J. 1998; 14: 703-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The translation of the sequence of the cDNA encoding deacetylvindoline 4-O-acetyltransferase was homologous to a series of other putative plant acetyltransferases. A conserved region near the carboxyl terminus of the proteins was used to design a degenerate antisense oligodeoxynucleotide primer for PCR. The sense primer was based upon an internal peptide sequence of salutaridinol 7-O-acetyltransferase. The primer sequences were as follows: sense primer (FVFDFAK), 5′-TT(T/C) GT(G/A/T) TT(T/C) GA(C/T) TT(T/C) GC(A/T) AA-3′; antisense primer (DFGWG motif), 5′-(A/C/G/T)GG (C/T)TT (A/C/G/T)CC CCA (A/C/G/T)CC(G/A)AA (A/G)TC-3′. The positions of these peptides are indicated by arrows in Fig. 2. RT-PCR performed with this primer pair yielded a DNA product of the correct size and sequence for the opium poppy acetyltransferase. RACE-PCR was then used to generate the 5′- and 3′-portions of the cDNA using nondegenerate nucleotide sequence information provided from the original PCR product. Translation of the complete nucleotide sequence of salAT yielded a polypeptide of 474 amino acids containing no apparent signal peptide. This is consistent with the cytosolic localization of the enzyme activity (6Lenz R. Zenk M.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 132-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The enzyme activity is also operationally found to be associated with the cytosolic fraction of exuded latex. The salAT amino acid sequence contains residues conserved in other plant acetyltransferases as indicated by the black boxes in Fig. 2. The longest contiguous region of conserved amino acids are the five residues DFGWG near the carboxyl terminus that were used for primer design and are indicated by an arrow. Conserved histidine and aspartate residues (HXXXD, denoted by # in Fig. 2) thought to be involved in catalysis as characterized by x-ray crystallography for the bacterial enzymes chloramphenicol acetyltransferase and dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase are also present in salutaridinol 7-O-acetyltransferase (23Shaw W.V. Leslie A.G.W. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1991; 20: 363-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 24Hendle J. Mattevi A. Westphal A.H. Spee J. de Kok A. Teplyakov A. Hol W.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4287-4298Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Covalent modification of salutaridinol 7-O-acetyltransferase by treatment with diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC) resulted in the inhibition of enzyme activity (50% inhibition at 3 mm DEPC and 92% inhibition at 5 mm DEPC) (25Miles E.W. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). The inactivation by 5 mmDEPC was reduced from 92% to 46% by preincubation of the enzyme with 30 mm acetyl-CoA. The amino acid sequence of salutaridinol 7-O-acetyltransferase is most similar (37% identity) to that of deacetylvindoline acetyltransferase of C. roseus(22St-Pierre B. Laflamme P. Alarco A.-M. De Luca V. Plant J. 1998; 14: 703-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Other similar plant acyltransferases involved in secondary metabolism are benzylalcohol acetyltransferase from Clarkia breweri (34%) (26Dudareva N. D'Auria J.C. Nam K.H. Raguso R.A. Pichersky E. Plant J. 1998; 14: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), anthranilateN-hydroxycinnamoyl/benzoyltransferase from Dianthus caryophyllus (25%) (27Yang Q. Reinhard K. Schiltz E. Matern U. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 35: 777-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), taxadienol acetyltransferase (24%), and 10-deacetylbaccatin III-10-O-acetyltransferase (22%) both from Taxus cuspidata (28Walker K. Schoendorf A. Croteau R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 374: 371-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 29Walker K. Croteau R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 583-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). A genomic DNA gel blot analysis of salAT in P. somniferum is presented in Fig. 3. The restriction endonucleases ApoI, SalI,SpeI, and HincII each recognized one hydrolysis site within the salAT open reading frame yielding two hybridizing bands on the Southern blot. There were no recognition sites for HindIII in the open reading frame. Correspondingly, only a single band hybridized, but it was of approximately one-half the predicted length. This indicates the possible presence of a small intron in the gene. Three recognition sites were present forMspI, theoretically resulting in four hybridizing DNA fragments. Two hybridizing bands of predictable length should have been present, one at 180 bp and one at 511 bp. The absence of these two bands also indicates that intron(s) may be present in the gene. No recognition site was present for EcoRI in the open reading frame, but two hybridizing bands were present on the gel blot also suggesting an intron, which contains an EcoRI restriction site. A more thorough analysis of this point awaits isolation of a genomic clone. These results, taken together, support a single gene hypothesis but do not exclude two very similar, clustered alleles. This is in stark contrast to the other known morphine-specific biosynthetic gene cor1 encoding codeinone reductase for which at least six alleles are expressed (13Unterlinner B. Lenz R. Kutchan T.M. Plant J. 1999; 18: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). RNA gel blot analysis suggests that, as for cor1, salAT is expressed in root, stem, leaf, and capsule of the mature poppy plant (Fig.4 A) (12Huang F.-C. Kutchan T.M.

There appears to be no organ-specific expression of either of these morphine biosynthetic genes. Analysis of RNA from several members of the genusPapaver demonstrated salAT transcript accumulation in 3-week-old seedlings of P. orientale andP. bracteatum although not in P. atlanticum orP. nudicaule (Fig. 4 B). P. orientaleaccumulated the alternate biosynthetic precursor oripavine, andP. bracteatum accumulated the morphine biosynthetic precursor thebaine; both structures contain the oxide bridge formed by the action of salutaridinol 7-O-acetyltransferase. It was, therefore, expected that these two species should contain hybridizingsalAT transcript. Neither P. atlanticum norP. nudicaule contained an alkaloid with the morphinan skeleton, consistent with the absence of transcript in these two species. The salAT cDNA was constructed to express the recombinant protein with six histidine residues elongating the amino terminus. The protein was then purified from S. frugiperda Sf9 cell culture medium in two steps (ammonium sulfate precipitation/dialysis and cobalt affinity chromatography) to yield electrophoretically homogeneous enzyme with an overall yield of 25% and 22-fold purification (Fig. 5). Per liter, the insect cell culture typically produced 2.0 mg (150 nmol s−1) of recombinant enzyme. Radioassay of pure, recombinant enzyme using [7-3H]salutaridinol as substrate resulted in 100% conversion into a product that co-migrated during TLC with authentic thebaine standard (Fig.6 A–C). The positive ion electrospray mass spectrum of the enzymic product produced when salutaridinol was used as substrate correlated well with that of thebaine standard (Fig. 6, D and E). The apparentK m value for salutaridinol was determined to be 9 µm at a fixed concentration of acetyl-CoA of 30 mm. The apparent K m value for acetyl-CoA was determined to be 54 µm at a fixed concentration of salutaridinol of 10 mm. The V max for the acetylation of salutaridinol was 25 pmol s−1 with a temperature optimum of 47 °C and a pH optimal range of 7–9 under standard assay conditions. The recombinant enzyme acetylated 7(S)-salutaridinol and nudaurine (apparentK m for nudaurine, 23 µm at 30 mm acetyl-CoA; apparent K m for acetyl-CoA, 106 µm at 10 mm nudaurine;V max, 19 pmol s−1) at C-7 but not 7(R)-salutaridinol, salutaridine, codeine, morphine, or deacetylvindoline. The kinetic values and chemical structures for the alkaloidal substrates salutaridinol and nudaurine are summarized in Table I. As designated by the ratiok cat /K m(salutaridinol):k cat /K m(nudaurine), the enzyme acetylated salutaridinol preferentially to nudaurine by a factor of 3.3.Table IDetermination of kcat/Km for the two alkaloidal 7-O-acetyltransferase substratesTable IDetermination of kcat/Km for the two alkaloidal 7-O-acetyltransferase substrates We have isolated a full-length cDNA clone that encodes salutaridinol 7-O-acetyltransferase from cell suspension culture of opium poppy P. somniferum. An identical match was observed between the deduced and directly determined amino acid sequences of ten internal peptides distributed throughout the open reading frame. The identity of the clone was ascertained by catalytic activity of the functionally expressed recombinant enzyme. The results obtained by RACE-PCR indicated that the reading frame is 1425 nucleotides long corresponding to 474 amino acids. These values correlate well to the transcript size obtained by RNA gel blot analysis. The calculated molecular mass of the enzyme is 52.6 kDa, which is consistent with the apparent molecular mass of 50 kDa determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (8Lenz R. Zenk M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31091-31096Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Acyltransferases of related amino acid sequence develop into a family of genes with integral roles in plant secondary metabolism. This has been suggested previously by De Luca (22St-Pierre B. Laflamme P. Alarco A.-M. De Luca V. Plant J. 1998; 14: 703-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of salutaridinol 7-O-acetyltransferase is similar to acyltransferases involved in monoterpenoid indole alkaloid, phenylpropanoid conjugate, and diterpenoid formation (22St-Pierre B. Laflamme P. Alarco A.-M. De Luca V. Plant J. 1998; 14: 703-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar,26Dudareva N. D'Auria J.C. Nam K.H. Raguso R.A. Pichersky E.

Histidine and aspartate residues (163HXXXD167) are highly conserved as is a DFGWG motif near the carboxyl terminus of the proteins. The equivalent histidine residue has been shown through site-directed mutagenesis or chemical modification to be essential for catalytic activity in other acyltransferases (30Brown N.F. Anderson R.C. Caplan S.L. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19157-19162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Carbethoxylation of histidine residues in salutaridinol 7-O-acetyltransferase with DEPC resulted in a loss of enzyme activity. Preincubation of the enzyme with acetyl-CoA partially protected a putative active site histidine residue from chemical modification and resultant inactivation. A catalytic triad (Ser-His-Asp) as found in serine proteases and lipases has been postulated for other acyltransferases (30Brown N.F. Anderson R.C. Caplan S.L. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19157-19162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The crystal structure of arylamine N-acetyltransferase from Salmonella typhimurium indicates that a cysteine residue may be a component of the catalytic triad (Cys69, His107, Asp122) (31Sinclair J.C. Sandy J. Delgoda R. Sim E. Noble M.E.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of salutaridinol 7-O-acetyltransferase contains both a conserved serine (Ser33) and a conserved cysteine (Cys152) suggesting that a catalytic triad could also be essential to enzyme activity in this family of plant acyltransferases. This consensus information should certainly also aid in the identification and isolation of additional members of this family that may be involved in other plant secondary pathways. The site of morphine biosynthesis in P. somniferum is a long-standing question. We examined herein the expression pattern ofsalAT in P. somniferum. salAT was expressed in each major plant part analyzed—root, stem, leaf, and capsule. This corresponds to the detection of transcript of another morphine biosynthesis-specific gene, cor1, in each plant organ analyzed (12Huang F.-C. Kutchan T.M. Phytochemistry. 2000; 53: 555-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Additionally, salutaridinol 7-O-acetyltransferase and codeinone reductase enzyme activity have each been detected in the cytosolic fraction of isolated latex (12Huang F.-C. Kutchan T.M. Phytochemistry. 2000; 53: 555-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 13Unterlinner B. Lenz R. Kutchan T.M. Plant J. 1999; 18: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The gene cyp80b1 participates in (S)-reticuline biosynthesis occurring before a bifurcation in the biosynthetic pathway that leads to more than 80 isoquinoline alkaloids. cyp80b1 is, therefore, common to several biosynthetic pathways including morphine, sanguinarine, and noscapine. Transcript of cyp80b1 was also detected in all plant organs analyzed (12Huang F.-C. Kutchan T.M. Phytochemistry. 2000; 53: 555-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Accumulation of morphinan alkaloids is thought to correlate with the appearance of laticifer cells in the developing plant and in differentiating plant cell culture (32Rush M.D. Kutchan T.M. Coscia C.J. Plant Cell Rep. 1985; 4: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 33Kutchan T.M. Ayabe S. Coscia C.J. Phillipson J.D. Roberts M.F. Zenk M.H. The Chemistry and Biology of Isoquinoline Alkaloids. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1985: 281-294Crossref Google Scholar). A reticulated laticifer system associated with the vascular tissue is present through the aerial parts of the poppy plant. In roots, nonreticulated laticifers are present (34Nessler C.L. Mahlberg P.G. Am. J. Bot. 1977; 64: 541-551Crossref Google Scholar, 35Nessler C.L. Mahlberg P.G. Am. J. Bot. 1978; 65: 978-983Crossref Google Scholar). The localization of three genes of morphine biosynthesis, cyp80b1, salAT, andcor1, is thus far consistent with the assumption this biosynthesis is, at least in part, associated with laticifer cells. Interestingly, deacetylvindoline acetyltransferase has been localized to laticifer cells in aerial parts of C. roseus (36St-Pierre B. Vázquez-Flota F.A. De Luca V. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 887-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). With even more morphine biosynthetic genes now in hand, we can begin to address the question of why only P. somniferum produces morphine, whereas other Papaver species such as P. rhoeas, P. orientale, P. bracteatum,P. nudicaule, and P. atlanticum do not.salAT transcript was detected in RNA isolated from P. somniferum, P. orientale, and P. bracteatumbut not in RNA from P. nudicaule and P. atlanticum. This is consistent with the expected distribution based upon accumulation of alkaloids having the morphinan nucleus in these species (i.e. morphine in P. somniferum, thebaine in P. bracteatum, and oripavine in P. orientale). This is in sharp contrast to those results obtained for cor1 transcript, which was detected also inPapaver species that are not known to accumulate codeine (12Huang F.-C. Kutchan T.M. Phytochemistry. 2000; 53: 555-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The genes of alkaloid biosynthesis in P. somniferumwill certainly continue to provide useful information on the molecular evolution of plant secondary metabolism in latex systems. An important aspect of our molecular genetics experiments with P. somniferum is an eventual biotechnological production of thebaine, codeine, and morphine. We have isolated cDNAs encoding several enzymes of morphine biosynthesis. The first enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway for which we have isolated a cDNA is norcoclaurine 6-O-methyltransferase (37Frick S. Kutchan T.M. Plant J. 1999; 17: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The second enzyme is the cytochrome P-450-dependent monooxygenase (S)-N-methylcoclaurine 3′-hydroxylase (12Huang F.-C. Kutchan T.M. Phytochemistry. 2000; 53: 555-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 18Pauli H. Kutchan T.M. Plant J. 1998; 13: 793-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). These enzymes are common to the morphine, noscapine, and sanguinarine biosynthetic pathways. Specific to morphine biosynthesis are salutaridinol 7-O-acetyltransferase (reported herein) and codeinone reductase, the penultimate enzyme of the morphine pathway that reduces codeinone to codeine (13Unterlinner B. Lenz R. Kutchan T.M. Plant J. 1999; 18: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). A cDNA encoding an enzyme involved generally in metabolism but essential to the activity of the cytochrome P-450-dependent monooxygenase, the cytochrome P-450 reductase has also been isolated (38Rosco A. Pauli H.H. Priesner W. Kutchan T.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 348: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Each of the cDNAs has been functionally expressed in insect cell culture (S. frugiperda Sf9 cells) or in E. coli. An immediate application of these cDNAs is in the metabolic engineering of P. somniferum to obtain altered alkaloid profiles in the plant. A more long term goal is a biomimetic synthesis of morphinan alkaloids combining chemically and enzymatically catalyzed steps. For this latter application, additional cDNAs encoding enzymes that mediate transformations occurring between (R)-reticuline and morphine still need to be isolated. We are grateful, as ever, to Dr. Friedrich Lottspeich (Martinsried) for the amino acid sequence determination. We thank Dr. Jürgen Schmidt (Halle) for the LC-MS analysis of thebaine, Professor Joachim Stöckigt (Mainz) for the gift of deacetylvindoline, and Professor Meinhart H. Zenk (Halle) for the synthesis of [7-3H]salutaridinol."
https://openalex.org/W2318290010,"This issue attempts to give a 'state of the art' overview of the AP-1 transcription factor family, a fundamental class of transcriptional regulators. The AP-1 family consists of several bZIP (basic region leucine zipper) domain proteins, the Jun, the Fos, and the ATF subfamilies, which all have to dimerize before they can bind to their DNA target sites. AP-1 has been a paradigm for transcription factors that regulate many aspects of cell physiology in response to environmental changes such as stress, radiation, or to growth factor signals thereby acting like an environmental biosensor. Although we have come a long way from discovering its major components, the heterodimer between c-Fos and c-Jun, it is daunting to realize that we still lack a detailed molecular knowledge of how these factors interact with DNA to activate or repress genes in the nucleus. It is also not clear how the response of AP-1 to growth factor signaling from the cell surface to the nucleus is interpreted at the molecular level and whether AP-1 is relevant for human disease."

We previously demonstrated that, upon ligand engagement, TRANCE-R forms a complex with c-Src and TRAF6 (6Wong B.R. Besser D. Kim N. Arron J.R. Vologodskaia M. Hanafusa H. Choi Y. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1041-1049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). We now show that PI3-K and Cbl proteins are also components of this signaling complex. Examination of the mechanism of the interaction of c-Cbl and Cbl-b with TRANCE-R shows a requirement for c-Src kinase activity, which may be regulated by TRAF6. Furthermore, a stable complex of TRANCE-R and Cbl-b is observable only in the presence of a proteasome inhibitor, suggesting that Cbl-b may negatively regulate TRANCE signaling by down-regulating one or more components of the TRANCE-R-signaling complex. Finally, using cells derived from Cbl-b −/− and c-Cbl −/− mice, we show that Akt activation by TRANCE and CD40L in dendritic cells is dependent on Cbl-b, whereas Akt activation in B cells by CD40L is dependent on c-Cbl, suggesting a novel positive regulatory role for Cbl proteins in signaling.

The domain structure of Cbl proteins consists of several functional domains, including an SH2-like phosphotyrosine binding domain, a RING finger, a proline-rich domain, and a leucine zipper.

In this report, we identify a mechanism by which the TNF family members TRANCE and CD40L activate Akt through their cognate receptors TRANCE-R and CD40. We previously demonstrated that, upon ligand engagement, TRANCE-R forms a complex with c-Src and TRAF6 (6Wong B.R. Besser D. Kim N. Arron J.R. Vologodskaia M. Hanafusa H. Choi Y. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1041-1049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). We now show that PI3-K and Cbl proteins are also components of this signaling complex. Examination of the mechanism of the interaction of c-Cbl and Cbl-b with TRANCE-R shows a requirement for c-Src kinase activity, which may be regulated by TRAF6. Furthermore, a stable complex of TRANCE-R and Cbl-b is observable only in the presence of a proteasome inhibitor, suggesting that Cbl-b may negatively regulate TRANCE signaling by down-regulating one or more components of the TRANCE-R-signaling complex. Finally, using cells derived from Cbl-b −/− and c-Cbl −/− mice, we show that Akt activation by TRANCE and CD40L in dendritic cells is dependent on Cbl-b, whereas Akt activation in B cells by CD40L is dependent on c-Cbl, suggesting a novel positive regulatory role for Cbl proteins in signaling.

https://openalex.org/W1980362465,"We developed a new variant of coral-derived red fluorescent protein, DsRed S197Y, which is brighter and essentially free from secondary fluorescence peak. This makes it an ideal reporter for double labeling with green fluorescent protein (GFP). Though purified protein shows only 20% stronger fluorescence emission, culture cells that express DsRed S197Y exhibit a 3–3.5 times higher level of fluorescence than the cells that express wild-type DsRed. The much slower fluorescence maturation of DsRed than that of GFP is a beneficial feature for a fluorescent developmental timer application. When GFP and DsRed S197Y are expressed simultaneously, emissions start at different latency. This provides information about the time after the onset of expression. It reflects the order of cell differentiation if the expression is activated upon differentiation of certain types of cells. We applied this system to the developing brain of Drosophila and visualized, for the first time, the formation order of neural fibers within a large bundle. Our results showed that newly extending fibers of the mushroom body neurons mainly run into the core rather than to the periphery of the existing bundle.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 509-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (4843) Google Scholar). DsRed, however, has a relatively low emission level and a parasitic green fluorescence peak that cross-talks with GFP emission (4Fradkov A.F. Chen Y. Ding L. Barsova E.V. Matz M.V. Lukyanov S.A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 479: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In GFP, a mutation at the 203rd amino acid residue (corresponding to position 197 in DsRed), which is in close contact with chromophore (5Wachter R.M. Elsliger M.A. Kallio K. Hanson G.T. Remington S.J. Structure. 1998; 6: 1267-1277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), to aromatic amino acid is mainly responsible for the enhancement of extinction coefficient and fluorescence shift to a longer wavelength (5Wachter R.M.

Methods Cell Biol. 1999; 58: 19-30Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following this idea, we performed a round of DsRed mutagenesis and obtained an enhanced variant, DsRed S197Y, in that Ser-197 is converted to Tyr. We analyzed its expression and maturation in heterologous systems of bacteria, insect, and mammalian cells, and further demonstrated its usage in Drosophila to monitor activation of target promoters and cell differentiation on the whole organism scale. The 0.71-kb NdeI-BamHI fragment of wild-type DsRed and 0.75-kb NcoI-BamHI fragment of EGFP were amplified by PCR from pDsRed1-N1 and pEGFP-N1 plasmids (CLONTECH) and subcloned into pET-11c and pET-11d vectors (Invitrogen). Polyhistidine tags were added to C termini during PCR amplification. Resulted pET-11c-DsRed-Hisx6 and pET-11d-EGFP-Hisx6 plasmids were transfected into Escherichia coliBL21(DE3) host (Invitrogen). Mutation Ser-197 to Tyr (S197Y) was introduced into pET-11c-DsRed-Hisx6 using a transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH). The PCR-amplified cDNAs of DsRed and DsRed S197Y were inserted intoKpnI-XbaI sites of pUASp vector (7Rorth P. Mech. Dev. 1998; 78: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar), resulting in pUASp-DsRed and pUASp-DsRed S197Y. The latter plasmid was microinjected into the eggs of Drosophila strainw1118; PΔ2–3 TM3 Sb/Dr (8Robertson H.M. Preston C.R. Phillis R.W. Johnson-Schlitz D.M. Benz W.K. Engels W.R. Genetics. 1988; 118: 461-470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to produce transgenic flies. The expression of recombinant proteins was induced by adding 1 mm IPTG to the LB medium at 37 °C. Proteins were affinity-purified with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen). The samples were at least 95% pure according to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The concentration was adjusted to 0.01 mg/ml with PBS for spectroscopic measurements (see Fig. 1, A andB). Affinity purification of proteins from inclusion bodies was performed after three cycles of sonication-precipitation of lysate and further denaturation in 8 m urea. Protein concentrations were determined by a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. A Hitachi U-3400 spectrophotometer and a Hitachi 650–60 spectrofluorimeter were used for the absorbance and fluorescence measurements, respectively. All measurements were done at 25 ± 1 °C. For the green channel of DsRed and GFP, samples were excited at 470 and 480 nm, and emission was detected at 500 and 510 nm, respectively. For the red channel of DsRed, excitation and detection were performed at 555 and 585 nm. For time course analysis (see Fig. 1 C), E. coli carrying EGFP, wild-type DsRed (wtDsRed), or DsRed S197Y in the pET-11 plasmids were grown until OD = 1.0 (at 650 nm) in the presence of 1% glucose as suppressor of recombinant protein production. Transgene expression was induced by the resuspension into fresh LB medium containing 1 mm IPTG. Incubation was performed at 28 °C to make the experiment comparable with Drosophila culture cells. To prepare lysate, cells were collected by centrifugation at 0 °C, resuspended in ice-cold PBS, intensively sonicated on ice, cleared by centrifugation at 12000 × g, 0 °C, and adjusted to OD = 1.0 at 280 nm with PBS. The total delay from the beginning of lysate preparation to fluorescence measurements was within 30 min. To analyze temperature dependences of fluorescence maturation (see Fig. 1, E and F), E. coli cells expressing EGFP or DsRed S197Y were grown in anaerobic conditions for 3 days to disturb autoxidation of chromophore. For fluorescence development, air was admitted while lysing cells by intensive sonication on ice, followed by incubation at 4, 16, 25, 37, 53, 65, and 80 °C. Culture and transfection of Drosophila S2 cells (see Fig.1 D) were carried out as described (9Oda H. Uemura T. Harada Y. Iwai Y. Takeichi M. Dev. Biol. 1994; 165: 716-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). To activate gene expression using the GAL4-UAS system (10Brand A.H. Perrimon N. Development. 1993; 118: 401-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), cells in 10-cm dishes were co-transfected with pWAGAL4 plasmid (a gift from Y. Hiromi, carrying GAL4 gene under cytoplasmic actin Act5C promoter) and pUAST-GFP S65T::actin (11; carrying GFP reporter gene fused with cytoplasmic actin gene), pUASp-DsRed, or pUASp-DsRed S197Y, in ratio 1:1, and incubated for defined hours at 25 °C. Cleared lysate (OD = 1.0 at 280 nm) was prepared and measured as above. Murine L cells (ATCC) were cultured in RPMI medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma) at 37 °C and co-transfected with pWAGAL4 and either pUASp-DsRed or pUASp-DsRed S197Y, in ratio 1:1, using DMIRE-C reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). The Drosophila larval eye discs and brains were dissected in PBS, fixed with 4% formaldehyde/PIPES (100 mm)- EGTA (2 mm)-MgSO4 (1 mm) buffer for 50 min, and mounted in 80% glycerol/PBS. 60–100 serial optical sections at 0.5 to 1-µm intervals were taken with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope and three-dimensionally reconstructed using BitPlane Imaris software. To minimize the cross-talk between GFP and DsRed signals and avoid reabsorption of GFP emission by DsRed, scanning is done separately using a 488-nm laser line and BP505–550 emission filter for GFP and 568-nm line and LP585 filter for DsRed. DsRed S197Y showed 20% higher fluorescence intensity than the wtDsRed; Fig.1 A), although the wavelength of the peak shifted only by 2 nm (i.e. 585 nm). The level of excitation peak (558 nm) was also slightly enhanced. When excited within the 440–490-nm range, wtDsRed shows a significant secondary emission peak around 500 nm (Fig. 1 B,arrow), which becomes a source of cross-talk with GFP imaging. DsRed S197Y almost completely suppresses this peak. The peak is not detected when wtDsRed is excited at the 310–350-nm range;e.g. see Fig. 1 A. The wtDsRed can take two energetically distinct states of chromophores, green (500 nm) and red (583 nm) (12Gross L.A. Baird G.S. Hoffman R.C. Baldridge K.K. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11990-11995Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Because DsRed form tight tetramers (1Baird G.S. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11984-11989Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar, 13Vrzheshch P.V. Akovbian N.A. Varfolomeyev S.D. Verkhusha V.V. FEBS Lett. 2000; 487: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), a single tetramer may contain monomers with both green and red chromophores. Thus, the suppression of the 500-nm emission peak in DsRed S197Y might mean either a higher percentage of monomers that are matured to red state or a higher rate of intermolecular fluorescence resonance energy transfer from green monomers to red ones within the same tetramer or both. When expressed in culture cells, DsRed S197Y exhibited a 3–3.5 times higher level of fluorescence than wtDsRed in both E. coliand Drosophila S2 cells (Fig. 1, C andD). Mammalian L cells also showed the relative fluorescence ratio of 3.4 ± 0.3 times. Because the differences are much bigger than the 20% fluorescence increase (Fig. 1 A) per molecule, it is likely that more fluorescent protein exists in S197Y-expressing cells. In fact, a Bio-Rad assay of affinity-purified proteins showed that E. coli expressing DsRed S197Y produce 2.7 ± 0.2 more fluorescent protein than the cells that express wtDsRed. Because the expression-driving system is identical between wt and S197Y for each experiment, and the ratio of fluorescence intensity was rather consistent across culture systems, this increase may not primarily be because of the differences in transcription or translation levels. Compared with E. coli that express DsRed S197Y, wtDsRed-expressing cells contained more than a 2 times higher amount of DsRed molecule in their inclusion bodies, which represents the active degradation process of intracellular proteins. It is thus likely that, similar to the GFP cycle 3 mutant (GFPuv) (14Crameri A. Whitehorn E.A. Tate E. Stemmer W.P. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar, 15Fukuda H. Arai M. Kuwajima K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12025-12032Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), DsRed S197Y attained its stronger fluorescence mainly, because higher proportions of translated molecules are folded properly and escape from the degradation process. Because the mutated 197th amino acid is oriented inside of the β-can structure of the DsRed protein, the difference is more likely to be because of the improved folding efficiency (3Tsien R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 509-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (4843) Google Scholar, 6Cubitt A.B. Woollenweber L.A. Heim R. Methods Cell Biol. 1999; 58: 19-30Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) than because of the change in hydrophobisity or aggregation properties (15Fukuda H. Arai M. Kuwajima K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12025-12032Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The development of DsRed fluorescence is much slower than EGFP (GFP F64L/S65T) or GFP S65T (Fig.1, C and D). The S197Y mutation did not change the maturation speed. The green fluorescence component of immature DsRed S197Y (Fig. 1, C and D, yellow-green bars) develops as rapid as GFP and then decreases. Its intensity is less than 6% of the GFP fluorescence even at its peak and less than 1% in the mature state, making the cross-talk with GFP signal practically negligible. The fluorescence maturation curve in E. coli lysate was qualitatively distinct between EGFP and DsRed S197Y in a wide range of temperatures. In logarithmic plot of time, EGFP fluorescence increased linearly (Fig. 1 E), which agrees with previously reported first-order kinetics (16Reid B.G. Flynn G.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6786-6791Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). In contrast, DsRed S197Y showed remarkably sigmoid time dependences. This indicates that the red chromophore exhibits multi-stage maturation, which conforms to its suggested chromophore structure (12Gross L.A. Baird G.S. Hoffman R.C. Baldridge K.K. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11990-11995Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). The time for the half-maximum fluorescence development (t 50%) decreases exponentially with temperature (Fig. 1 F). The delay oft 50% between EGFP and DsRed S197Y is longer at lower temperature (empirical equation, t 50% = 238 × exp(4 − t °C)/8.75). At 18, 21, 25, 28, and 37 °C, the delays are 48.1, 34.1, 21.6, 15.3, and 5.5 h, respectively. The maximal level of DsRed S197Y fluorescence acquisition shows bell-shaped temperature dependence with its peak at around 35 °C (Fig. 1 F). The final yield of fluorescence is irreversibly decreased at lower and higher temperatures. No further fluorescence growth was observed when samples kept at low or high temperatures were later transferred to 35 °C. The fluorescence did not decrease when the samples matured at 35 °C were transferred later to low or high temperatures either. These indicate that at least two processes affect the degree of DsRed S197Y maturation; one increases, and the other decreases the yield of maturated chromophore with temperature. For a practical use of DsRed S197Y, we made a Drosophila transformant strain carrying the transgene under GAL4-responsive sequence UAS. Various fly strains are widely available that carry fused GFP reporters under control of UAS, e.g. GAP::GFP (17Ritzenthaler S. Suzuki E. Chiba A. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 1012-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), GFP::actin (11Verkhusha V.V. Tsukita S. Oda H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and neuronal-synaptobrevin (vamp)::GFP (18Ito K. Suzuki K. Estes P. Ramaswami M. Yamamoto D. Strausfeld N.J. Learn. Mem. 1998; 5: 52-77PubMed Google Scholar, 19Estes P.S. Ho G.L. Narayanan R. Ramaswami M. J. Neurogenet. 2000; 13: 233-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The UAS-DsRed S197Y strain would be useful for counter staining the cells that are labeled with such GFP reporters. The slow speed of DsRed fluorescence maturation has often been regarded as a drawback. We found that it is actually a beneficial feature for a fluorescent developmental timer. The red fluorescence of DsRed S197Y becomes visible much later than the green signal of GFP S65T (or EGFP) when they are expressed by the same promoter. If co-expression is activated shortly after the generation, or final differentiation, of certain types of cells, the fluorescence hue would reflect the order of their generation/differentiation. To test whether this works practically, we expressed both GFP S65T and DsRed S197Y in the developing eye disc of Drosophila larvae (Fig. 2). Retinal cells are differentiated row by row immediately posterior to the morphogenic furrow, which moves from posterior edge of the disc to the anterior at the speed of ∼1.5 h per row (at 25 °C) (20Wolff T. Ready D.F. Bate M. Martinez-Arias A. The Development of Drosophila melanogaster. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 1277-1325Google Scholar). When reporters were co-expressed by the driver strain GMR (glassmultimer reporter)-GAL4, which drives expression in the differentiated cells posterior to the morphogenic furrow (21Freeman M. Cell. 1996; 87: 651-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar), the GFP signal appears a few columns behind the furrow. DsRed becomes visible about 12 rows behind (roughly corresponding to 18 h of delay). Because cells throughout retina emit both DsRed and GFP signals in later stages (not shown), the lack of DsRed signal in the green cells of the larval eye disc is not because of the failure of DsRed expression. Thus, the fluorescence hue reflected the order of cell differentiation in this system. A significant part of the brain consists of bundles, tracts, and meshwork of neural fibers. Investigating how such structures are composed is an important step for understanding the mechanism of brain development. How do neural fibers form bundles during neurogenesis? In the case where neurons start extending their fibers at a relatively fixed period after their generation, the order of fiber formation should correspond to the age of the cells. It was impossible to analyze the order even in such cases, because traditional birth-date analysis, labeling DNA-replicating cells with [3H]thymidine or bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd), can visualize only nuclei. On the other hand, GFP and DsRed spread into cytoplasm of even fine cellular processes that are far from nuclei. Using this approach, we analyzed the formation process of the fiber bundle of mushroom bodies (MBs). In Drosophila, four stem cells (neuroblasts) sequentially generate three major subtypes of MB neurons (Kenyon cells), which are in the adult innervate γ, α′/β′, and α/β lobes, respectively (22Ito K. Awano W. Suzuki K. Hiromi Y. Yamamoto D. Development. 1997; 124: 761-771PubMed Google Scholar, 23Lee T. Lee A. Luo L. Development. 1999; 126: 4065-4076PubMed Google Scholar). The pedunculus of the adult MB has a concentric structure with the oldest γ lobe fibers running at the periphery and the youngest α/β lobe fibers occupying the core (18Ito K. Suzuki K. Estes P. Ramaswami M. Yamamoto D. Strausfeld N.J. Learn. Mem. 1998; 5: 52-77PubMed Google Scholar, 24Crittenden J.R. Skoulakis E.M. Han K.A. Kalderon D. Davis R.L. Learn. Mem. 1998; 5: 38-51PubMed Google Scholar). The formation order of fibers within each subtype, however, could not directly be investigated. To visualize this process, we expressed GFP and DsRed in the larval MB using GAL4 enhancer-trap strain 201y (25Yang M.Y. Armstrong J.D. Vilinsky I. Strausfeld N.J. Kaiser K. Neuron. 1995; 15: 45-54Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). This strain labels a large subset of Kenyon cells of the first subtype that form a γ lobe in the adult but innervate both vertical and medial lobes in larvae. In the cluster of cell bodies, neuroblasts, surrounding ganglion mother cells and newly generated neurons, are left unlabeled (Fig. 3, A and B). Neurons surrounding them emit only GFP signal, suggesting that they are shortly after the onset of reporter expression. Cells far from the neuroblasts emit both GFP and DsRed signals and are thus older. This age-dependent distribution agrees with the previous birth-date analysis using BrdUrd (26Ito K. Hotta Y. Dev. Biol. 1992; 149: 134-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). In the cross-section at the posterior root of the pedunculus, many fibers show only green GFP signal (Fig. 3 C), indicating that201y-labeled cells extend their fibers well before DsRed signals become visible. DsRed-positive fibers, which should be older, are observed only in the periphery. Thus, it is likely that the larval pedunculus is ordered in a concentric manner according to their age, with younger fibers in the inner area (Fig. 3, diagram 2). A thin green layer appears in the fringe of the bundle, suggesting that a small subset of fibers extend along the outer surface of the bundle. The center of the bundle is unlabeled with both GFP and DsRed. They would correspond to the fibers of the unlabeled young neurons near the neuroblast (Fig. 3 B), or certain cells that are not labeled with 201y might form a specific structure at the core. Near the anterior end of the pedunculus, DsRed-positive old fibers show crescent-like distribution but still remain in the periphery (Fig.3 D). During larval period, the number of Kenyon cells increase from 250 ± 50 to 1670 ± 176 (27Hinke W. Z. Morphol. Tiere. 1961; 50: 81-118Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the cross-section of the pedunculus is much smaller in younger larvae. The concentric distribution of old and new fibers was identical even at these stages (Fig. 3, E and F). In the vertical and medial lobes, DsRed-positive fibers are observed only in the periphery (Fig. 3, G and H). Thus, throughout larval development, most of the newly projecting Kenyon cell fibers extend into inner part of the fiber bundles of pedunculus and lobes to shift older fibers outwards. Another recently reported DsRed mutant, E5, which emits a strong green signal when immature (28Terskikh A. Fradkov A. Ermakova G. Zaraisky A. Tan P. Kajava A.V. Zhao X. Lukyanov S. Matz M. Kim S. Weissman I. Siebert P. Science. 2000; 290: 1585-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), is also useful for such formation-order analysis. Unlike DsRed S197Y, E5 presents a different fluorescence hue without the help of co-expressed GFP. Its strong green signal at the constitutive expression state, on the other hand, makes it less suitable for double labeling with GFP-based reporters. DsRed S197Y can be used for dual purpose, fluorescent timer during development and counter stainer of GFP in the mature state. This is especially useful in systems like Drosophila, where introducing multiple reporters into one animal is an easy task by crossing various transformant lines. We thank B. Dickson, M. Nakamura, D.

https://openalex.org/W2097244308,"Caspase-associated recruitment domains (CARDs) are protein interaction domains that participate in activation or suppression of CARD-carrying members of the caspase family of apoptosis-inducing proteases. A novel CARD-containing protein was identified that is overexpressed in some types of cancer and that binds and suppresses activation of procaspase-9, which we term TUCAN (tumor-up-regulated CARD-containing antagonist of caspase nine). The CARD domain of TUCAN selectively binds itself and procaspase-9. TUCAN interferes with binding of Apaf1 to procaspase-9 and suppresses caspase activation induced by the Apaf1 activator, cytochrome c. Overexpression of TUCAN in cells by stable or transient transfection inhibits apoptosis and caspase activation induced by Apaf1/caspase-9-dependent stimuli, including Bax, VP16, and staurosporine, but not by Apaf1/caspase-9-independent stimuli, Fas and granzyme B. High levels of endogenous TUCAN protein were detected in several tumor cell lines and in colon cancer specimens, correlating with shorter patient survival. Thus, TUCAN represents a new member of the CARD family that selectively suppresses apoptosis induced via the mitochondrial pathway for caspase activation."
https://openalex.org/W2070412082,"The Arabidopsis chy1 mutant is resistant to indole-3-butyric acid, a naturally occurring form of the plant hormone auxin. Because the mutant also has defects in peroxisomal beta-oxidation, this resistance presumably results from a reduced conversion of indole-3-butyric acid to indole-3-acetic acid. We have cloned CHY1, which appears to encode a peroxisomal protein 43% identical to a mammalian valine catabolic enzyme that hydrolyzes beta-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA. We demonstrated that a human beta-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA hydrolase functionally complements chy1 when redirected from the mitochondria to the peroxisomes. We expressed CHY1 as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein and demonstrated that purified GST-CHY1 hydrolyzes beta-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA. Mutagenesis studies showed that a glutamate that is catalytically essential in homologous enoyl-CoA hydratases was also essential in CHY1. Mutating a residue that is differentially conserved between hydrolases and hydratases established that this position is relevant to the catalytic distinction between the enzyme classes. It is likely that CHY1 acts in peroxisomal valine catabolism and that accumulation of a toxic intermediate, methacrylyl-CoA, causes the altered beta-oxidation phenotypes of the chy1 mutant. Our results support the hypothesis that the energy-intensive sequence unique to valine catabolism, where an intermediate CoA ester is hydrolyzed and a new CoA ester is formed two steps later, avoids methacrylyl-CoA accumulation."

Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT, EC2.7.7.31) is a DNA polymerase, which contributes to the diversification of antigen receptors by adding nucleotides, called N-regions, to gene segment junctions during V(D)J recombination (8Komori T.

Science. 1993; 261: 1175-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). In vitro, TdT most efficiently polymerizes deoxynucleotides on 3′-hydroxyl ends of DNA strands in a template-independent manner (10Bollum F.J. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 3rd Ed. Academic Press, New York1974: 145-171Google Scholar, 11Deibel Jr., M.R. Coleman M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4206-4212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, shortly after the isolation of TdT, it was shown that TdT could add a few ribonucleotides to oligodeoxynucleotide initiators and incorporate ribonucleotides into growing DNA chains (12Kato K.I. Goncalves J.M. Houts G.E. Bollum F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 2780-2789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Roychoudhury R. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3910-3917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The methodology at that time allowed neither accurate determination of the reaction kinetic parameters nor calculation of the TdT selectivity factor for deoxyribonucleotides over ribonucleotides. Having recently developed a new method for producing large quantities of pure and unproteolyzed recombinant TdT in bacteria (14Boulé J.B. Johnson E. Rougeon F. Papanicolaou C. Mol. Biotechnol. 1998; 10: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), we have been able to compare the activity of the two TdT isoforms found in the mouse (15Boulé J.B. Rougeon F. Papanicolaou C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28984-28988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), to undertake three-dimensional structural analyses (16Sukumar N. Boulé J.B. Expert-Bezancon N. Jourdan N. Lescar J. Rougeon F. Papanicolaou C. Delarue M. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 1662-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), and to further improve the enzymatic characterization of the protein. Here, we present our analysis of the sugar selectivity of TdT, and our investigation of its enzymatic behavior in vitro in the presence of both ribo- and deoxyribonucleotides. We report that the short murine TdT, which is the isoform conserved across the vertebrate phylum (17Bentolila L.A. Fanton d'Andon M. Nguyen Q.T. Martinez O. Rougeon F. Doyen N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4221-4229Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), has only minor preference for the incorporation of deoxyribo- over ribonucleotides on DNA strands in vitro and that under conditions that reproduce the in vivoribo/deoxyribonucleotide pool imbalance (18Meuth M. Mutat. Res. 1984; 126: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), incorporation of ribonucleotides by TdT leads to premature termination of chain elongation. As a first step toward analyzing the mechanisms underlying the apparent lack of sugar discrimination by TdT, unique among nucleic acid polymerases, we identified by directed mutagenesis the position of the third carboxylate residue of the conserved catalytic triad. The detailed protocol used for expression and purification of recombinant TdT has been described (14Boulé J.B. Johnson E. Rougeon F. Papanicolaou C. Mol. Biotechnol. 1998; 10: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The same protocol was used to obtain Asp170Ala, Asp170Glu, and Asp434Ala histidine-tagged protein variants. Purified proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using an 8% acrylamide gel. Densitometric analysis of the Coomassie Blue-stained gels led to an estimation of the purity of the proteins as greater than 80%. (dA)10 and (dA)10rA oligonucleotides were purchased from Genset (Paris, France). Ultrapure ribo-, deoxy-, and dideoxyribonucleotide solutions were purchased fromAmersham Pharmacia Biotech. Standard kinetic assays were carried out at 35 °C by incubating recombinant proteins in 200 mmpotassium cacodylate, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.6, 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 4 mm MgCl2, 4 µm ZnSO4, and various concentrations of the reaction substrates (oligonucleotide initiator and nucleotides). Measurements of incorporation of α-32P-labeled nucleotides into acid insoluble material, and chain extension assays used to visualize elongation products were done as described previously for the polymerization of dATP (14Boulé J.B. Johnson E. Rougeon F. Papanicolaou C. Mol. Biotechnol. 1998; 10: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Specific conditions are given in the legends of the figures. Michaelis-Menten kinetic parameters ( K mdATP, K mATP, K m(dA)10rA, K m(dA)10, andk cat) were obtained by titrating each substrate (nucleotide or initiator) in the presence of saturating concentrations of a second substrate, as previously described (14Boulé J.B. Johnson E. Rougeon F. Papanicolaou C. Mol. Biotechnol. 1998; 10: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). 40 nmTdT were incubated with 10 µm 5′ 32P-labeled (dA)10 and 0.5 mm of each pair of nucleotides (dATP+rATP, dTTP+rUTP, dGTP+rGTP, or dCTP+rCTP). Aliquots were taken after 15, 30, 45, and 60 s of incubation, and the reaction was stopped with the addition of a formamide dye mix (10 mmNaOH, 95% formamide, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 0.05% xylene cyanole). The samples were loaded onto a 16% polyacrylamide denaturing gel in order to separate the products of the reaction. Under these conditions, the (dA)10 initiator was only extended by one nucleotide, either dNTP or rNTP. (dA)10dN migrating faster than (dA)10rN, the two products were easily separated by electrophoresis. The gel was scanned on a 445 SI PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics), and band intensities within each lane of migration were quantified with Bio-Rad Quantity One software. The quantification of each band, in arbitrary units, was plotted against the incubation time, allowing the determination of initial velocity (vi) for single incorporation of either ribo- or deoxyribonucleotide. To minimize the effect of local background heterogeneity caused by contaminating bands in the (dA)10preparation, the selectivity factor was obtained by dividing the initial velocity of deoxynucleotide incorporation (vidNTP) by the initial velocity of ribonucleotide incorporation (virNTP). Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out according to the method described by Kunkel (19Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4897) Google Scholar) using the Muta-Gene kit from Bio-Rad. Oligonucleotides were purchased from Genset (Paris, France). Mutagenesis of amino acid Asp170 was performed in plasmid pET22(b)-TdTS (14Boulé J.B. Johnson E. Rougeon F. Papanicolaou C. Mol. Biotechnol. 1998; 10: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The presence of the mutations was verified by double-stranded DNA sequencing using the primer 5′-ATATgCTTgCCAgCgAAgAACC located 30 base pairs upstream from the mutagenesis site. Mutated cDNA was subcloned into plasmid pET28(b) at the NdeI/EcoRI sites and sequenced again before transformation into our expression strain (14Boulé J.B. Johnson E. Rougeon F. Papanicolaou C. Mol. Biotechnol. 1998; 10: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of amino acid Asp434 was performed directly in plasmid pET28(b)-TdTS (14Boulé J.B. Johnson E. Rougeon F. Papanicolaou C. Mol. Biotechnol. 1998; 10: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Verification of the change of the codon was done by double-stranded DNA sequencing using the primer 5′-CCAgAAATgCTTCCTgATTC located 79 base pairs upstream from the mutagenesis site. Sequences of mutagenic primers were as follows: 5′-ATATCAAgggCAgCCgTgAATAgTT (Asp170Ala), 5′-gATATCAAgggCTTCCgTgAATAgT (Asp170Glu) and 5′-gACCAgAgCTACACg (Asp434Ala). The kinetic parameters of the reaction of addition of ribonucleotides to single-stranded DNA have as yet not been determined. We first measured TdT catalytic activity using a standard kinetic assay with a (dA)10 oligonucleotide substrate at saturating concentration (150 µm) and dATP or rATP nucleotide substrates at varying concentrations (between 8 and 1000 µm). Initial velocities were measured using linear regression on appropriate time courses (every 30 s for 3.5 min) and were normalized to the concentration of TdT. Michaelis-Menten kinetic parameters are presented in TableI. TdT exhibits the same apparent affinity (K m) for both ribo- and deoxyriboadenosine triphosphate and shows only an R that equals a 3-fold lower polymerization efficiency for rATP than for dATP (R =k cat/ K mdATP/k cat/ K mrATP= 3) indicating that TdT does not discriminate strongly against rATP. The ratio R of thek cat/K m values determined independently for two substrates is commonly taken as a good indicator of the selectivity S of the enzyme when the two substrates are simultaneously present (20Fersht A. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. Freeman, San Francisco1977Google Scholar, 21Huang Y. Beaudry A. McSwiggen J. Sousa R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13718-13728Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A strict R= S equality holds when the enzyme follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics and, more generally for kinetic mechanisms in which the substrate binds to a single conformational state of the enzyme (Fig.1 A in Ref. 22Ninio J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 663-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The value of the TdT selectivity factor S for each ribo/deoxyribonucleotide pair (rATP/dATP, rUTP/dTTP, rGTP/dGTP, and rCTP/dCTP) was experimentally determined in a chain elongation assay, under conditions where both types of nucleotides are present and where there is a single nucleotide addition to the nucleic acid initiator. Because the initiator terminated by a deoxyribonucleotide migrates faster than the initiator terminated by a ribonucleotide, the products are easily separated by gel electrophoresis and quantified. The selectivity factor is given by the ratio of the efficiencies for dNTP and rNTP addition (vidNTP/virNTP). A representative experiment and the selectivity factors calculated from several quantifications of single incorporation chain extension assays (see “Experimental Procedures” for details) are presented in Fig.1. The S values range between 2.0 ± 0.3 for dCTP over rCTP and 4.9 ± 1.0 for dTTP over rUTP. They are several orders of magnitude smaller than the sugar selectivity factor values reported for other nucleic acid polymerases (3Sousa R. Padilla R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4609-4621Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 4Gao G. Orlova M. Georgiadis M.M. Hendrickson W.A. Goff S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The S value for dATP over rATP differs from the R value by a factor of only 1.5 indicating that under our experimental conditions the enzyme follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics.Table IKinetic parameters of TdT for dATP and rATP incorporation on (dA)10 initiatorNucleotideK m1-aK m andk cat mean values ± S.D. were obtained from a nonlinear least-squares fit of the kinetic data to the Michaelis-Menten equation.k catk cat/K mµmmin−1µm−1min−1dATP300 ± 6180 ± 50.6 ± 0.02rATP368 ± 6476 ± 60.2 ± 0.08Kinetic parameters were determined using standard TdT assays as described under “Experimental Procedures.”1-a K m andk cat mean values ± S.D. were obtained from a nonlinear least-squares fit of the kinetic data to the Michaelis-Menten equation. Open table in a new tab Kinetic parameters were determined using standard TdT assays as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The analysis of the behavior of TdT (250 nm) over a 60-min time course, at 5 µm (dA)10 with a large excess of rATP (1 mm), shows that the incorporation of rATP reaches a plateau after about 20 min (Fig.2 A). Only 8% (2 nmols) of the total rATP present in the reaction are polymerized. The chain length distribution pattern is presented in Fig. 2 B. TdT elongates all of the (dA)10 primer within 5 min but stops after the incorporation of only a limited number of ribonucleotides. After an hour, the major products are elongated by one and two ribonucleotides. Under the same reaction conditions, with dATP as the nucleotide substrate, TdT synthesizes very long polymers (15Boulé J.B. Rougeon F. Papanicolaou C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28984-28988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and polymerization of 1 mm dATP is completed within an hour (data not shown). The ribonucleotide-terminated products are only weakly elongated with the addition of 1 mm dATP after a 15-min incubation (Fig.2 C, lanes 1–2). Addition of 1 µm(dA)10 and 1 mm dATP after 15 min leads to the extension of the newly added nucleic acid substrate (Fig.2 C, lanes 3–4), indicating that the enzyme is still active. When the enzyme/substrate ratio is raised from 0.05 to 0.8, with rATP as a unique nucleotide substrate, TdT is able to synthesize long polymers of rATP, with more than 20 rATP added (Fig.2 D). We compared TdT utilization of (dA)10 and (dA)10rA initiators and found that TdT extends within 5 min 95% of the (dA)10 in the presence of dATP and 80% of the (dA)10 in the presence of rATP. In the presence of dATP or rATP, only 55 and 30% of the (dA)10rA initiator, respectively, are extended (Fig. 3). Michaelis-Menten parameters for (dA)10rA were determined by measuring the rate of dATP polymerization at varying concentrations of (dA)10rA initiator. In TableII, the K m(dA)10rA and k cat(dA)10rA values can be compared with the K m(dA)10 and k cat(dA)10 values previously determined (14Boulé J.B. Johnson E. Rougeon F. Papanicolaou C. Mol. Biotechnol. 1998; 10: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The apparent affinity for the (dA)10rA is slightly higher (2.5-fold) than for the (dA)10, and the rate of dATP polymerization to (dA)10rA is decreased (10-fold). Our results demonstrate that the enzyme cannot efficiently elongate nucleic acids terminated by riboadenosine residues.Figure 3TdT elongation of (dA)10 and (dA)10rA. 250 nm TdT were incubated with 5 µm 5′ 32P-labeled (dA)10 or (dA)10rA and nucleotide substrates as indicated. Aliquots of the reaction were withdrawn at 0, 2.5, 5, and 10 min, and the products were analyzed on a 16% polyacrylamide denaturing gel. Quantification of unelongated (dA)10 and (dA)10rA was achieved by scanning the gel on a PhosphorImager. Quantifications of unelongated (dA)10(circles) and (dA)10rA (squares) in the presence of dATP (filled symbol) and rATP (open symbol) are displayed in the inset.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Table IIKinetic parameters of TdT for (dA)10 and (dA)10rA elongation with dATPInitiatorK m2-aK m andk cat mean values ± S.D. were obtained from a nonlinear least-squares fit of the kinetic data to the Michaelis-Menten equation.k catk cat/K mµmmin−1µm−1min−1(dA)1015.9 ± 2.8147 ± 7.59.4 ± 1.5(dA)10rA5.9 ± 0.911.3 ± 0.41.9 ± 0.3Kinetic parameters were determined using standard TdT assays as described under “Experimental Procedures.”2-a K m andk cat mean values ± S.D. were obtained from a nonlinear least-squares fit of the kinetic data to the Michaelis-Menten equation. Open table in a new tab Kinetic parameters were determined using standard TdT assays as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The indiscriminate incorporation of ribo- and deoxyribonucleotides and the effect of ribonucleotide incorporation on oligomer extension rate by TdT led us to analyze polymer synthesis and growth in the presence of the two types of nucleotides. We compared the extension by TdT of a (dA)10 initiator with dATP (at 10 and 100 µm) or dATP and rATP at equimolar ratio or with rATP in excess (10- and 100-fold) (Fig. 4 A). Under all conditions, addition of rATP modifies the pattern of chain length distribution. When rATP is added at equimolar ratios, all the (dA)10 initiators are elongated, but there is a slight reduction in the size of the products. The population of polymers becomes heterogeneous for each length, reflecting the mixed incorporation of dATP and rATP. As the rATP/dATP ratio is raised, the polymers are enriched in rATP leading to a dramatic reduction in the size of the polymers and to an increase in the heterogeneity of the population. The lengths of the products obtained with 100 µm dATP and 1 mm rATP are similar to those obtained with dATP and ddATP at equimolar concentration (100 µm). However, in the presence of dideoxynucleotides, which act as chain terminators, the polymer population is more homogeneous because there is only one ddATP incorporated per chain. We verified the generality of the profile of mixed polymerization described for dATP/rATP. As shown in Fig. 4 B, TdT is unable to add more than 3 rUTP, 3 rCTP, and 4 rGTP residues to the (dA)10 initiator. When we compared the polymerization of individual deoxyribonucleotide to the corresponding ribo/deoxyribonucleotide mixed polymerization (dTTP/rUTP, dGTP/rGTP, and dCTP/rCTP), in the presence of a 10-fold excess of ribonucleotides over deoxyribonucleotides mimicking the cellular pool imbalance (18Meuth M. Mutat. Res. 1984; 126: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), we observed again that all the (dA)10 initiators are elongated, and the polymerization products are shorter than at equimolar concentrations (Fig. 4 C). Interestingly, the elongation of all the (dA)10 is also observed when TdT polymerizes dCTP alone (Fig. 4 C), reflecting the preference of the enzyme for (dA) oligomers over dCMP-terminated oligomers (12Kato K.I. Goncalves J.M. Houts G.E. Bollum F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 2780-2789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rapid elongation of all the (dA)10 in the presence of both ribo- and deoxyribonucleotides is a consequence of the poor ability of TdT to elongate initiators containing ribonucleotides at the 3′-hydroxyl end. This suggests that the enzyme dissociates from the DNA initiator after the incorporation of one nucleotide, whether a ribo- or a deoxyribonucleotide, and uses deoxynucleotide-terminated initiators preferentially. This hypothesis was tested with the following experiments. Early investigations of polymerization of deoxyribonucleotides showing that the length of TdT products could be predicted by the nucleotide/initiator concentration ratio suggested a non-processive mode of synthesis (23Chang L.M.S. Bollum F.J. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 536-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The mode of polymerization of ribonucleotides was not addressed at the time. We compared the degree of processivity of TdT when polymerizing dATP or rATP by analysis of chain length distributions at various enzyme/initiator ratios. As shown in Fig. 5, the sizes of the polymers synthesized by TdT at high (dA)10 initiator concentrations (100 µm), in the presence of an excess of nucleotides (1 mm dATP or rATP), decrease with TdT concentration. At the lowest enzyme concentration (4 nm), most of the initiators have not been elongated. The major product is an 11-mer. Only traces of a 12-mer product are visible. This pattern of chain length distribution, which was also observed for all other ribo- and deoxyribonucleotides (data not shown), is only expected if the probability is very high that the enzyme leaves the nucleic acid substrate after the incorporation of just one nucleotide (24Bambara R.A. Fay P.J. Mallaber L.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 270-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus, the mode of polymerization of both ribo- and deoxyribonucleotides by TdT is distributive. TdT belongs to the family X polymerases (25Ito J. Braithwaite D.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4045-4057Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), a subclass of an ancient nucleotidyltransferase superfamily (26Holm L. Sander C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 345-347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Replicative polymerases and nucleotidyltransferases share a catalytic carboxylic residue triad. The single aspartate motif A in nucleotidyl transferases is located downstream from the double aspartate motif C and not upstream as in replicative polymerases (27Delarue M. Poch O. Tordo N. Moras D. Argos P. Protein Eng. 1990; 3: 461-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 28Joyce C.M. Steitz T.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6321-6329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Martin G. Keller W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2593-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 30Yue D. Maizels N. Weiner A.M. RNA. 1996; 2: 895-908PubMed Google Scholar, 31Kirk B.W. Kuchta R.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7727-7736Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 32Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1609-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The double aspartate motif C in human TdT, identified by mutagenesis, is around Asp343 and Asp345 (33Yang B. Gathy K.N. Coleman M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11859-11868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The position of the third catalytic aspartate was not experimentally determined. Based on amino acid sequence comparison to replicative polymerases from other classes, the single aspartate motif A of DNA polymerase β (pol β), another family X polymerase, had been initially mislocated around Asp17 (27Delarue M. Poch O. Tordo N. Moras D. Argos P. Protein Eng. 1990; 3: 461-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Elucidation of the pol β structure suggested instead that Asp256 was the third catalytic aspartate (34Sawaya M.R. Pelletier H. Kumar A. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Science. 1994; 264: 1930-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), and this was later confirmed by mutagenesis experiments (35Menge K.L. Hostomsky Z. Nodes B.R. Hudson G.O. Rahmati S. Moomaw E.W. Almassy R.J. Hostomska Z. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15934-15942Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Sequence comparisons of pol β and TdT would suggest that Asp434 in TdT is functionally equivalent to pol β Asp256. Because TdT Asp170 is homologous to pol β Asp17, we compared the activity of TdT variants, mutated at position 170 and position 256, to the activity of wild-type TdT. As shown in Fig.6, the Asp170Ala and Asp170Glu mutants both retain significant TdT activity, but the Asp434Ala mutant is totally inactivated. This confirms the involvement of the TdT Asp434 amino acid in catalysis. TdT is defined as a DNA-dependent, non-replicative DNA polymerase despite its known ability to add ribonucleotides to single-stranded deoxyribonucleic acids under standard experimental conditions (12Kato K.I. Goncalves J.M. Houts G.E. Bollum F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 2780-2789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Roychoudhury R. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3910-3917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This natural nucleotide substrate ambivalence had not been characterized. We have analyzed TdT discrimination between ribo- and deoxyribonucleotide substrates by determining the influence of the sugar moiety of the nucleotide on the kinetic parameters of the reaction and by measuring TdT selectivity in single nucleotide addition assays in the presence of both ribo- and deoxyribonucleotides. The selectivity factors obtained in single nucleotide addition assays with the four ribo/deoxyribonucleotide pairs are in the 2–5 range indicating that TdT incorporates almost indifferently the ribose or the deoxyribose version of a nucleotide, regardless of the base. This property of TdT, unique among all known polymerases (3Sousa R. Padilla R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4609-4621Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 4Gao G. Orlova M. Georgiadis M.M.

Chem. 2000; 275: 19759-19767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), led us to test the effect of ribonucleotide incorporation on polymer growth. We demonstrate that TdT extends a ribonucleotide-terminated initiator with a lower catalytic rate than a deoxyribonucleotide-terminated initiator. TdT polymerization efficiency under standard conditions decreased dramatically after the incorporation of only a limited number of ribonucleotides. However, at high enzyme/initiator ratio, TdT was able to synthesize long polymers of ribonucleotides. In the presence of the two types of nucleotides, TdT makes mixed polymers of ribo- and deoxyribonucleotides. The products are shorter than the all-DNA products, reflecting the lack of sugar discrimination of TdT, its preference for deoxyribonucleotide initiators and its distributive mode of synthesis. The sugar specificity of nucleic acid polymerases can be relaxed under particular conditions, by using Mn2+ in place of Mg2+ as a catalytic divalent cation (7Cases-Gonzalez C.E. Gutierrez-Rivas M.

Lazaro J.M. Blanco L. Salas M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 38Joyce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1619-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Incorporation of the “wrong” sugar into the growing chain promptly induces a change of conformation of the nucleic acid substrate, and the reaction stops (21Huang Y. Beaudry A. McSwiggen J. Sousa R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13718-13728Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This scenario has been documented for several RNA and DNA polymerases (3Sousa R. Padilla R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4609-4621Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 4Gao G. Orlova M. Georgiadis M.M. Hendrickson W.A. Goff S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 19759-19767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We have shown that the inability of TdT to use RNA substrate efficiently is due to its poor accommodation of single-stranded RNA. Crystallographic studies and construction of mutants should allow an understanding of the structural basis of nucleic acid specificity in TdT and enable the design of a terminal ribonucleotidyl transferase. For several replicative DNA polymerases sugar discrimination has been shown to depend on a single residue in motif A acting as a steric barrier blocking the 2′-hydroxyl of an incoming ribonucleotide (6Bonnin A. Lazaro J.M. Blanco L. Salas M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 38Joyce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1619-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Crystallographic analyses of pol β suggest a different mechanism in which exclusion of the ribose moiety is caused by a three residue peptide backbone in the flexible hinge region following the single aspartate motif A (39Pelletier H. Sawaya M.R. Kumar A. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Science. 1994; 264: 1891-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar, 40Pelletier H. Sawaya M.R. Wolfle W. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12762-12777Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The topology of the catalytic domain of pol β differs from that of all other replicative polymerases in several aspects (34Sawaya M.R. Pelletier H. Kumar A. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Science. 1994; 264: 1930-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 41Steitz T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17395-17398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar), and pol β belongs with TdT to an ancient nucleotidyltransferase superfamily (26Holm L. Sander C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 345-347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) in which the single carboxylate motif A is located downstream from the double aspartate motif C (29Martin G. Keller W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2593-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 30Yue D. Maizels N. Weiner A.M. RNA. 1996; 2: 895-908PubMed Google Scholar, 31Kirk B.W. Kuchta R.D.

As a first step toward understanding the mechanisms underlying TdT sugar ambivalence, we confirmed that the third catalytic aspartate is located downstream of motif C. TdT catalyzes the addition of non-templated nucleotides to junctions of rearranging V, D, and J gene segments. Despite high concentrations of TdT in lymphocytes, N-regions made by TdT are only 3–4 nucleotides long on average (42Kepler T.B. Borrero M. Rugerio B. McCray S.K. Clarke S.H. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4451-4457PubMed Google Scholar), much shorter than those made in a V(D)J recombination cell-free assay (43Ramsden D.A. Paull T.T. Gellert M. Nature. 1997; 388: 488-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). A recent study on adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency, an inherited lymphoid-specific metabolic disease associated with abnormal purine metabolism (44Blackburn M.R. Datta S.K. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5093-5100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), showed that alterations in intracellular deoxynucleotide pools can modify the composition of N-regions (45Gangi-Peterson L. Sorscher D.H. Reynolds J.W. Kepler T.B. Mitchell B.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 833-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).

Cytol. 2000; 192: 223-253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the lack of sugar discrimination of TdT, in light of the ribonucleotide excess in cells (18Meuth M. Mutat. Res. 1984; 126: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), could affect N-region synthesis.

https://openalex.org/W2055698225,"Most mammalian cells have in their plasma membrane at least two types of lipid microdomains, non-invaginated lipid rafts and caveolae. Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins constitute a class of proteins that are enriched in rafts but not caveolae at steady state. We have analyzed the effects of abolishing GPI biosynthesis on rafts, caveolae, and cholesterol levels. GPI-deficient cells were obtained by screening for resistance to the pore-forming toxin aerolysin, which uses this class of proteins as receptors. Despite the absence of GPI-anchored proteins, mutant cells still contained lipid rafts, indicating that GPI-anchored proteins are not crucial structural elements of these domains. Interestingly, the caveolae-specific membrane proteins, caveolin-1 and 2, were up-regulated in GPI-deficient cells, in contrast to flotillin-1 and GM1, which were expressed at normal levels. Additionally, the number of surface caveolae was increased. This effect was specific since recovery of GPI biosynthesis by gene recomplementation restored caveolin expression and the number of surface caveolae to wild type levels. The inverse correlation between the expression of GPI-anchored proteins and caveolin-1 was confirmed by the observation that overexpression of caveolin-1 in wild type cells led to a decrease in the expression of GPI-anchored proteins. In cells lacking caveolae, the absence of GPI-anchored proteins caused an increase in cholesterol levels, suggesting a possible role of GPI-anchored proteins in cholesterol homeostasis, which in some cells, such as Chinese hamster ovary cells, can be compensated by caveolin up-regulation.

In particular, increasing evidence supports the existence of cholesterol and glycosphingolipid rich domains, which have been termed lipid rafts (1Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8157) Google Scholar, 2Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2557) Google Scholar). Rafts are physiologically important since they have been implicated in signaling (3Janes P.W. Ley S.C. Magee A.I. Kabouridis P.S. Semin.

Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 212-213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Lipid rafts are small (50–350 nm in diameter depending on the study, cell type, and analysis method) and highly dynamic entities (11van der Goot F.G. Harder T. Semin. Immunol. 2001; 13: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Due to the high abundance of cholesterol and lipids with long saturated acyl chains, the lipid bilayer within these domains is in the tightly packed liquid ordered state Lo (12London E. Brown D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1508: 182-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Some proteins preferentially partition into Lo phases, leading to a specific protein composition (2Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2557) Google Scholar). More than 100 proteins have been suggested to be associated with lipid rafts. Even though this might be an overestimation, considering the small size of elementary raft units, a given raft can only contain a limited number of these proteins. It is not clear at present whether each raft contains a random sample of raft components or whether some rafts contain a specific set of proteins or lipids, i.e.whether there are different types of rafts. A clear subclass of rafts is, however, composed by caveolae (13Parton R.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 542-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). These can easily be distinguished by their shape (they are flask-like invaginations) and by the presence of membrane proteins of the caveolin family (4Schlegel A. Pestell R.G. Lisanti M.P. Front. Biosci. 2000; 5: D929-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 7Ikonen E. Parton R.G. Traffic. 2000; 1: 212-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 13Parton R.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 542-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). The proposed functions of caveolae are similar to those attributed to rafts. They are believed to be implicated in signal transduction, based on the observation that caveolin-1 interacts with a number of signaling molecules (14Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar), and in cholesterol regulation (4Schlegel A. Pestell R.G. Lisanti M.P. Front. Biosci. 2000; 5: D929-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar,7Ikonen E. Parton R.G. Traffic. 2000; 1: 212-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In the present paper, for the sake of clarity, the term raft will only be used to identify all non-caveolar rafts, as opposed to caveolae themselves. In contrast to rafts, caveolae are not ubiquitous since they are not found in cells lacking caveolins such as lymphocytes (15Fra A.M. Williamson E. Simons K. Parton R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30745-30748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, heterologous expression of caveolin-1 will induce de novo formation of caveolae (16Fra A.M. Williamson E. Simons K. Parton R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8655-8659Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 17Lipardi C. Mora R. Colomer V. Paladino S. Nitsch L. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Zurzolo C. J.

A class of raft proteins that has attracted much attention over the last decade is that of GPI1-anchored proteins (GPI-APs). These lipid-anchored polypeptides are mainly present at the plasma membrane where they are found in rafts, i.e. outside of caveolae, at steady state (19Schnitzer J.E. McIntosh D.P. Dvorak A.M. Liu J. Oh P. Science. 1995; 269: 1435-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar), even though they may enter caveolar pits upon cross-linking with antibodies (20Maxfield F.R. Mayor S. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 419: 355-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). GPI-anchored proteins, however, also undergo endocytosis. In CHO cells, they were shown to be internalized and then recycled back to the plasma membrane via the recycling endosome (21Mayor S. Sabharanjak S. Maxfield F.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4626-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) 2M. Fivaz, F. Vilbois, S. Thurnheer, C. Pasquali, L. Abrami, P. E. Bickel, and F. G. van der Goot, submitted for publication. in a cholesterol-dependent (21Mayor S. Sabharanjak S. Maxfield F.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4626-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) and sphingolipid-dependent (22Chatterjee S. Smith E.R. Hanada K. Stevens V.L. Mayor S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1583-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) process. In COS-7 cells, although GPI-anchored proteins were found to cycle between the plasma membrane and the Golgi apparatus, trafficking was again found to be cholesterol-dependent (23Nichols B.J. Kenworthy A.K. Polishchuk R.S. Lodge R. Roberts T.H. Hirschberg K. Phair R.D. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 529-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar), further highlighting the functional interactions between GPI-APs and cholesterol. We here investigated whether the absence of GPI-anchored proteins would affect lipid rafts and/or caveolae. We have used GPI-deficient lymphocytes and CHO cells. The GPI-deficient CHO cells were obtained by screening for resistance toward the bacterial pore-forming toxin aerolysin, which binds specifically to GPI-APs (24Nelson K.L. Raja S.M. Buckley J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12170-12174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 25Abrami L. Fivaz M. Glauser P.-E. Parton R.G. van der Goot F.G. J.

Trends Microbiol. 2000; 8: 168-172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we found that GPI-deficient CHO cells express higher levels of caveolin-1 than wild type cells, due to increased transcription, and concomitantly have an increased number of caveolae at their surface. Restoration of GPI biosynthesis by gene recomplementation subsequently reduced caveolin-1 expression to wild type levels. These experiments indicate that cells that lack GPI-anchored proteins somehow compensate for this loss by overexpressing caveolins. Comparison of GPI-deficient cells, which naturally express caveolins (CHO) or lack caveolins (lymphocytes), suggests that caveolin overexpression might compensate for cholesterol defects. Monoclonal anti-caveolin-1 and anti-caveolin-2 antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY), polyclonal anti-caveolin-1 N20 antibodies from Santa Cruz, monoclonal anti-transferrin receptor antibodies from Zymed Laboratories Inc., polyclonal anti-LAT from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY), and monoclonal mouse anti-FLAG antibodies from Sigma and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies fromAmersham Pharmacia Biotech. Anti-Rab 5, anti-β-COP, anti-p23, anti-β1-β2 adaptins, anti-calnexin, and anti-flotillin antibodies were gifts from R. Jahn (MPI, Tübingen), the late T. Kreis, J. Gruenberg (University of Geneva, Geneva), A. Dautry-Varsat (Pasteur Institute, Paris), A. Helenius (ETH, Zürich), and P. Bickel (Harvard, Cambridge, MA), respectively. Fluorescent secondary antibodies were from Jackson Immunoresearch. Peroxidase-coupled cholera toxin B-subunit was purchased from Sigma. cDNAs of PIG-L and PIG-A were those previously generated (27Nakamura N. Inoue N. Watanabe R. Takahashi M. Takeda J. Stevens V.L.

Takeda J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7400-7405Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The caveolin-1 cDNA was a gift from P. Dupree (University of Cambridge, Cambridge) (29Kurzchalia T.V. Dupree P. Parton R.G. Kellner R. Virta H. Lehnert M. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1003-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Proaerolysin was purified as described previously (30Buckley J.T. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1990; 68: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Concentrations were determined by measuring the optical density at 280 nm, considering that a 1 mg/ml sample has an optical density of 2.5 (31van der Goot F.G. Hardie K.R. Parker M.W. Buckley J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 269: 30496-30501Google Scholar). Proaerolysin was labeled with 125I using IODOGEN reagent (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The radiolabeled toxin was separated from the free iodine by gel filtration on a PD10-G25 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. We consistently obtained a specific activity of about 2 × 106cpm/µg of proaerolysin. Radiolabeled proaerolysin ran as a single band on a SDS gel. CHO-K1 cells were routinely maintained in 100-mm diameter Nunc dishes containing 10 ml of F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mml-glutamine under standard tissue culture conditions in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 100% humidity at 37 °C. CHO-K1 cells were mutagenized with ethyl methanesulfonate (400 µg/ml) at 37 °C for 24 h, as described (32Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1926-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). After growing in the complete culture medium for 4 days, the mutagenized cells were harvested, re-seeded at 400 colonies/dish, and grown in the presence of 1 nm proaerolysin for another 2 days. After incubation in toxin-free culture medium for 7 days, surviving colonies were trypsinized with a filter paper and transferred to 24-well plates. The cells were cultured in normal medium for several days, re-seeded, and then subjected to two other cycles of proaerolysin selection as above. A total of 314 separated colonies of surviving cells were formed and purified by limited dilution. After confirming toxin resistance, clones were frozen for further analysis. Confluent monolayers of CHO cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS containing 1 mmCaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2(PBS2+). Cells were then incubated at 4 °C with 0.4 or 0.96 nm125I-proaerolysin in incubation medium containing Glasgow minimal essential medium buffered with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, for 1 h. Cells were washed three times for 5 min with PBS2+ at 4 °C. Monolayers were then further incubated at 37 °C in incubation medium for various times. Cells were subsequently washed with ice-cold PBS2+, scraped from the dish, and collected by centrifugation at 300 ×g for 5 min. The presence of cell-bound125I-proaerolysin was analyzed either by counting or by autoradiography of 10% SDS gels. Proaerolysin overlays, to detect proaerolysin receptors, were performed as described previously (25Abrami L. Fivaz M. Glauser P.-E. Parton R.G. van der Goot F.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 525-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Briefly, membrane fractions were run on a 10% SDS gel (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). The gel was incubated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 20% glycerol for 10 min. Proteins were then blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane for 16 h at 100 mA in the cold using a Bio-Rad wet transfer chamber with a transfer buffer containing 10 mmNaHCO3 and 3 mm Na2CO3(pH 9.8). The nitrocellulose membrane was incubated in a binding buffer containing 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.5, and 0.3% Tween 20 for 20 min, followed by a 2-h incubation in the presence of 2.8 nm proaerolysin (labeled or not with125I) diluted in the same buffer. The membrane was then washed six times for 5 min with toxin free binding buffer. Binding of proaerolysin was revealed by autoradiography using BioMax films (Eastman Kodak Co.) or using anti-aerolysin antibodies. PIG-L and PIG-A genes were expressed in a pMEori expression vector (pME-EBO-FLAG) driven by Sr-α promoter composed of human T-cell lymphotrophic virus-1 enhancer and simian virus 40 early promoter (27Nakamura N.

Caveolin-1 gene was introduced in the pcDNA3 vector driven by the human cytomegalovirus promoter. Plasmids were purified using columns (Quiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfection experiments in CHO cells were performed by the CaPO4-DNA precipitation procedure described by Graham and van der Eb (34Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 54: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), using caveolin-1, PIG-L, or PIG-A expression constructs. CHO cells from a confluent 60-cm2 tissue culture dish were diluted 1:15 and seeded on glass coverslips in a six-well tissue culture plate in view of immunofluorescence experiments. Per well, 3 µg of plasmid DNA were used. The expressing cells were analyzed by immunofluorescence after 48 h of incubation at 37 °C. To establish stable cell lines expressing FLAG-PIGL or FLAG-PIGA, transfectants were selected with culture medium containing 200 µg/ml hygromicin. Stable cell lines expressing caveolin-1 were selected for resistance toward 600 µg/ml G418. After three cycles of trypsinization and antibiotic treatment, colonies were isolated by limited dilution. Approximately 2 × 107 cells were resuspended in 0.5 ml of cold buffer (TNE) containing 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100 (Ultrapure, Pierce) with a tablet of Complete (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), a mixture of protease inhibitors. Membranes were solubilized by rotary shaking at 4 °C for 30 min. The DRMs were purified on either a step sucrose gradient (25Abrami L. Fivaz M. Glauser P.-E. Parton R.G. van der Goot F.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 525-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) or using an Optiprep gradients (35Harder T. Scheiffele P. Verkade P. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 929-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). For purification on sucrose gradients, the cell lysate was adjusted to 40.7% sucrose (in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4), loaded at the bottom of a SW 40 Beckman tube, overlaid with 8 ml of 35% sucrose, topped up with 15% sucrose, and centrifuged for 18 h at 35,000 rpm at 4 °C. After centrifugation, 12 fractions of 1 ml were collected. For each fraction the protein content was determined. The same protein amount of each fraction was precipitated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by toxin overlay and/or Western blot analysis. For purification on Optiprep gradients, the cell lysate was adjusted to 40% Optiprep, loaded at the bottom of a TLS.55 Beckman tube, overlaid with 600 µl of 30% Optiprep and 600 µl of TNE, and centrifuged for 1.5 h at 55,000 rpm at 4 °C. Six fractions of 250 µl were collected from top to bottom. DRMs were found in fraction 3, which were subsequently precipitated with chloroform methanol and analyzed as above. DRMs were prepared from wild type and mutant CHO cells as described (36Fivaz M. Vilbois F. Pasquali C. van der Goot F.G. Electrophoresis. 2000; 21: 3351-3356Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and precipitated with 6% trichloroacetic acid in the presence of 375 µg of sodium deoxycholate as a carrier. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was performed with non-linear immobilized pH gradient strips, pH range 3–10 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) as described (36Fivaz M. Vilbois F. Pasquali C. van der Goot F.G. Electrophoresis. 2000; 21: 3351-3356Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 37Pasquali C. Fialka I. Huber L.A. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2573-2581Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Total RNA was purified from CHO wild type or LA1 cell monolayers with Nucleospin RNA II kits (Macherey-Nagel). Confluent cells in one 10-cm dish yielded ∼10 µg of total RNA. For Northern blot analysis, 1.25 µg of RNA were separated on 1% agarose/formaldehyde denaturing gel and transferred on to a nylon membrane. The membrane was stained with methylene blue (presence of 28 and 18 S ribosomal RNA bands indicating intact RNA) and was hybridized to full-length random-primed32P-labeled (random-primed DNA labeling kit, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) caveolin cDNA (EcoRI-XhoI insert of 890 base pairs). The caveolin blot was prehybridized for 24 h at 65 °C and then hybridized overnight at 65 °C to the probe at 1 × 10.6 cpm/ml hybridization buffer. Washed blots were visualized on Kodak X-Omat film, exposed to a phosphorimager plate, and analyzed using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad) under conditions where the signals were linear with respect to the amount of sample applied. Fixation and permeabilization of CHO cells were performed by incubation 4 min at −20 °C in methanol. After three washes in PBS plus 0.05% bovine serum albumin, fixed cells were reacted for 30 min at room temperature with polyclonal anti-caveolin 1 antibodies (1:100). Cells were then washed three times with PBS, 0.5% bovine serum albumin and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:50). Cells were analyzed with a Zeiss Axiophot fluorescence microscope. Lipids were chloroform/methanol-extracted from cell extract (equivalent of 40 µg of protein). Lipids were separated on Kiesel gel 60 (Merck, Germany) with a solvent system of heptane:ethyl ether:acetic acid (18:6:2). Cholesterol was visualized after incubating the sheet in a solution of 3% copper acetate with 8% H3PO4 and drying 5 min at 160 °C. TLC plates were then analyzed by densitometry and cholesterol amount quantified using Scan-Analysis software. To quantify cell growth, wild type and mutant CHO cells were seeded in complete medium at the density of 4.105 cells/ml at day 0 and counted every 24 h. Cell surface caveolae were quantitated by electron microscopy exactly as described previously (38Hailstones D. Sleer L.S. Parton R.G. Stanley K.K. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 369-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was performed as described by Laemmli (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis was carried out using peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG as a secondary antibody, which was detected by chemiluminescence using Super Signal reagents (Pierce). Protein concentrations of cellular fractions were determined with bicinchoninic acid (BCA, Pierce). In order to generate cell deficient in GPI biosynthesis, we have made use of the bacterial pore-forming toxin aerolysin (26Abrami L. Fivaz M. van Der Goot F.G. Trends Microbiol. 2000; 8: 168-172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This toxin specifically binds to GPI-anchored proteins on mammalian cells, and the binding capacity is retained after SDS-PAGE of cellular extracts and blotting onto a nitrocellulose membrane (toxin overlay assay) (24Nelson K.L. Raja S.M. Buckley J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12170-12174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 25Abrami L. Fivaz M. Glauser P.-E. Parton R.G. van der Goot F.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 525-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The main determinant for aerolysin binding is not the protein moiety but the glycan core common to all GPI-anchored proteins (39Diep D.B. Nelson K.L. Raja S.M. McMaster R.W. Buckley J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 273: 2355-2360Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Therefore, aerolysin does not generally discriminate between different GPI-anchored proteins, although some exceptions exist (40Gordon V.M. Nelson K.L. Buckley J.T. Stevens V.L. Tweten R.K. Elwood P.C. Leppla S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27274-27280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Thus, all cells expressing GPI-anchored proteins are likely to be sensitive to aerolysin and will ultimately dye when exposed to the toxin (25Abrami L. Fivaz M. Glauser P.-E. Parton R.G. van der Goot F.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 525-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Conversely, cells lacking GPI-anchored proteins should be insensitive to aerolysin, as suggested by several examples (40Gordon V.M. Nelson K.L. Buckley J.T. Stevens V.L. Tweten R.K. Elwood P.C. Leppla S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27274-27280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 41Brodsky R.A. Mukhina G.L. Nelson K.L. Lawrence T.S. Jones R.J. Buckley J.T. Blood. 1999; 93: 1749-1756Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and should therefore multiply even in the presence of the toxin. Aerolysin therefore potentially constitutes a very powerful tool to generate GPI-deficient cells. We found that this is indeed the case by screening for aerolysin-resistant CHO cells. We have recently identified and characterized the GPI-anchored protein composition of CHO cells by two-dimensional gel analysis2 and shown that a protein with apparent molecular mass of 130 kDa is by far the most abundant GPI-anchored protein in this cell type. This protein, called here GPI-130, can readily be detected by performing an aerolysin overlay assay on a postnuclear supernatant after one-dimensional SDS-PAGE (can be seen in Fig. 1 B). Cells were submitted to chemical mutagenesis with EMS and then selected for the ability to grow in the presence of 1 nmproaerolysin, the aerolysin precursor (for review see Ref. 26Abrami L. Fivaz M. van Der Goot F.G. Trends Microbiol. 2000; 8: 168-172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Among 314 mutants, most were unable to bind aerolysin (Fig. 1 A) and 9 were selected for further analysis. In agreement with the lack of proaerolysin binding, we could not detect GPI-130 by toxin overlay in any of the mutants (identified by numbers in Fig.1 B). The absence of GPI-130 suggested that the cells might indeed be deficient in the biosynthesis of GPI-anchored proteins in general. This was confirmed by the observation that none of the mutants were able to heterologously express the GPI-anchored protein human alkaline phosphatase (data not shown). CHO mutants deficient in GPI biosynthesis have previously been generated by EMS mutagenesis (for reviews see Refs. 42Kinoshita T. Ohishi K. Takeda J. J Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar and 43Stevens V.L. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 361-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Most of the obtained mutants were deficient in the enzyme responsible for theN-deacetylation of N-acetylglucosamine phosphatidylinositol, which is encoded by the PIG-L gene (27Nakamura N. Inoue N. Watanabe R. Takahashi M. Takeda J. Stevens V.L. Kinoshita T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15834-15840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 44Stevens V.L. Zhang H. Harreman M. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether our mutants were also PIG-L-deficient, by transfecting cells with a PIG-L construct. Expression of alkaline phosphatase and sensitivity toward proaerolysin were assayed. Among the nine selected mutants, only the CHO-LA1 mutant cell line (labeled1 in Fig. 1 B) was sensitive toward proaerolysin after PIG-L transfection, as witnessed by a recovery of ER vacuolation, a characteristic effect of aerolysin on fibroblast-like cells (25Abrami L.

A second frequent target gene of EMS mutagenesis is the DMP2 gene, encoding an ER protein implicated in the synthesis of dolichol-phosphate mannose, a mannose donor for GPI as well as for N-glycans and C-mannosylation (46Maeda Y. Tomita S. Watanabe R. Ohishi K. Kinoshita T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4920-4929Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). By gene recomplementation, we found that mutant CHO-LA49 (labeled49 in Fig. 1 B) was affected in the DMP2 gene. It remains to be determined what step of GPI biosynthesis is affected in t"

The role of the β2 subunit has remained elusive. Here we isolate a novel variant of this subunit and show that the β2 subunit does not need to form heterodimers for catalytic activity because enzyme activity can be measured when it is expressed alone in Sf9 cells.

The EC50 values for the NO-donor diethylamine/NO were shifted to the left by 1 order of magnitude as compared with the α1/β1 heterodimeric form. In the presence of the detergent Tween, NO sensitivity of β2 was abolished, but the enzyme could be activated by protoporphyrin IX, indicating removal of a prosthetic heme group and exchange for the heme precursor.

The prototypical α1/β1 isoform has been purified from native tissue and characterized extensively by several groups. This enzyme contains a prosthetic heme group that mediates activation by nitric oxide (NO) leading up to a 400-fold increase in formation of cGMP from GTP. In addition to the cloning of the classical α1 and β1 subunits in a number of species, two other soluble guanylyl cyclase subunits have been cloned, the β2 subunit from rat kidney and the α2subunit from human fetal brain (4Yuen P.S. Potter L.R. Garbers D.L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10872-10878Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 5Harteneck C. Wedel B. Koesling D. Malkewitz J. Böhme E. Schultz G. FEBS Lett. 1991; 292: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Co-expression of the α1/β1 and α2/β1cDNAs yielded NO-sensitive enzymes in expression systems, whereas there were initially no reports on enzyme activity after co-expressing the β2 cDNA with any of the other subunits (4Yuen P.S. Potter L.R. Garbers D.L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10872-10878Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 5Harteneck C. Wedel B. Koesling D. Malkewitz J. Böhme E. Schultz G.

Invest. 1997; 100: 1488-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) later presented evidence for enzyme activity after co-expression of a β2-GFP1fusion construct with the α1 cDNA in COS cells. However, experiments performed in other laboratories have so far failed to produce similar results (for review, see Refs. 2Denninger J.W. Marletta M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 334-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar and 3Koesling D. Friebe A. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 135: 41-65Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with results from co-expression studies, the α2/β1 heterodimeric enzyme has been demonstrated on the protein level in human placenta by co-precipitation experiments (9Russwurm M. Behrends S. Harteneck C. Koesling D. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). This α2/β1 heterodimeric enzyme also contains a prosthetic heme group and displays similar pharmacological properties as the α1/β1 isoform (9Russwurm M. Behrends S. Harteneck C. Koesling D. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Thus, whereas the role of the subunits building up the α1/β1and α2/β1 isoforms of soluble guanylyl cyclase are fairly well described, the role of the β2subunit has remained elusive. Also in contrast to the other subunits, the β2 subunit shows a much more restricted tissue distribution with predominant expression in rat kidney (4Yuen P.S. Potter L.R. Garbers D.L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10872-10878Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Recently, a β3 subunit could be identified in the insect Manduca sexta that is active in the absence of a second subunit and shows enzyme activity only in the presence of manganese as divalent cation (Mn2+) (10Nighorn A. Byrnes K.A. Morton D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2525-2531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Here we isolate a novel variant of the rat β2 subunit that is active in the absence of a second subunit and shows enzyme activity only in the presence of manganese as divalent cation (Mn2+). Mutation of a residue in the catalytic domain that has been shown to lead to a constitutively active homomeric guanylyl cyclase A results in an enzyme that shows increased basal enzyme activity and stimulation by nitric oxide. We suggest that the β2 subunit is the first mammalian NO-sensitive guanylyl cyclase lacking a heterodimeric structure. YC-1 and ODQ were from Alexis Biochemicals, and equine myoglobin from skeletal muscle was from Serva. All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma in the highest grade of purity. Products for Sf9 and HEK-293 cell culture were from Life Technologies and Biochrom, respectively. The ProSTARTMfirst strand reverse transcription-PCR kit (Stratagene) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol using random oligomers with 5 µg of total RNA from rat kidney prepared using RNAzolTM(Biotecx Laboratories). The specific primers for PCR corresponded to nucleotides 111–135 and 2224–2200 of the GenBankTMsequence entry M57507 (Ref. 4Yuen P.S. Potter L.R. Garbers D.L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10872-10878Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar; 5′-CTC ATC CAA GAA GCC TGC AAG GTT C-3′ and 5′-GGA TCC CAT AGG ATC ACT TTT TCT C-3′). PCR was performed usingPfu polymerase (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol with the following PCR profile: 94 °C for 1 min, 35 cycles at 94 °C for 20 s, 60 °C for 15 s, and 72 °C for 2 min, with a final extension of 10 min at 72 °C. The resulting PCR product of 2114 base pairs was incubated with regular Taqpolymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 10 min at 72 °C to introduce TA overhangs and was subcloned into the pcDNA3.1/V5/His-TOPO vector and sequenced. For 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends we used Marathon-ReadyTMkidney cDNA (CLONTECH) with the AdvantageTM cDNA PCR kit (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Two nested gene-specific primers were used for 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends corresponding to nucleotides 184–159 and 135–111 of GenBankTM sequence entry M57507 (Ref. 4Yuen P.S. Potter L.R. Garbers D.L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10872-10878Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar; 5′-TCC TCC AAG TGT CCG CAG CAT CCT-3′ and 5′-AAG AAG TAT TCG CCA AAG AGC TTC AG-3′). Reactions were run in a thermal cycler with the following parameters in a 25-µl reaction volume: 94 °C for 1 min, 35 cycles at 94 °C for 15 s, 65 °C for 15 s, and 68 °C for 30 s, and a final extension of 4 min at 68 °C. A 338-base pair 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends product was cloned into the vector pcDNA3.1/V5/His-TOPO using the eukaryotic TOPO TA-Cloning® kits (Invitrogen) and sequenced by ABI Prism™ dye terminator cycle sequencing (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). ANcoI/BamHI insert from the β2 clone in pcDNA3.1/V5/His-TOPO vector (see above) was ligated together with a HindIII/NcoI fragment from the 338-base pair rapid amplification of cDNA ends product into theHindIII/BamHI cut pcDNA3.1Zeo+vector. This clone was checked by DNA sequencing, and sequence information was submitted to GenBankTM (accession numberAY004153). From the pcDNA3.1Zeo+ vector, the cDNA was cloned as an NheI/XbaI fragment (both restriction sites in vector) into the compatible SpeI site of pFASTBAC (Life Technologies). The α1 subunit was cutEcoRI/ScaI out of pGEM7ZF(+) vector (a kind gift of Dr. Georges Guellaën, Créteil, France (11Giuili G. Scholl U. Bulle F. Guellaën G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 304: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar)), cloned EcoRI/StuI into pFASTBAC, and shortened in the 5′-noncoding region byAscI/BssHII digestion and religation. Cloning of the β1 subunit into pFASTBAC has been described earlier (12Koglin M. Behrends S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1494: 286-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Recombinant baculoviruses of the respective subunits were generated according to the BAC-TO-BACTM System (Life Technologies). Mutagenesis of β2 was done in the pFASTBAC construct with the QuickChangeTM kit (Stratagene) using the following primer pairs: 5′-GCC TCT AGG ATG GCA AGT CAC GGG CTT CCC-3′ and 5′-GGG AAG CCC GTG ACT TGC CAT CCT AGA GGC-3′ for Glu-596 and 5′-GGC CCT GTG CTG TCT GCT TTC TCT GTT GTG CTG TGA TCA CG-3′ and 5′-CGT GAT CAC AGC ACA ACA GAG AAA GCA GAC AGC ACA GGG CC 3′ for Cys-739. The modified nucleotides are underlined. Both products were controlled by sequencing. All constructions were done in parallel for β2 and β2 E596A. The pFASTBAC plasmids were cut with SalI/PshAI and ligated withSalI/SmaI into the multiple cloning site of the pEGFP-N1 vector to attach a GFP protein to the C terminus of the β2 subunit. For replacement of part of the N terminus by GFP we cut the pFASTBAC constructs XmnI/BamHI and ligated the fragments SmaI/BamHI into the pEGFP-C1 vector (analogous to the procedure described in Ref. 8Gupta G. Azam M. Yang L. Danziger R.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1488-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Cloning of α1 and β1 subunit into pcDNA3.1/V5/His-TOPO vector was done by cutting both pFASTBAC constructs (see above) BamHI/XhoI andBamHI/XhoI ligation into pcDNA3.1/V5/His-TOPO. All constructs were checked by sequencing. Sf9 cells were cultured in Sf-900 II serum-free medium supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 10% fetal calf serum. Spinner cultures were grown to a cell density of 3.0 × 106 cells/ml and then diluted to 1.2 × 106 cells/ml for infection. 30 ml of cell solution were infected with multiplicities of infection of 1. After 74 h, cells were harvested and collected by centrifugation (1.500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C). All the following steps were performed at 4 °C or on ice. The cell pellet was resuspended in 4 ml of homogenization buffer containing 50 mm triethylammonium/HCl, pH 7.6, 0.2 µm benzamidin, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and freshly dissolved dithiothreitol with a final concentration of 10 mm. The cells were passed through a Sterican®needle (0.45 × 25 mm, B. Braun) several times for lysis. To remove complete cells and nuclei, the solution was centrifuged for 2 min at 800 × g. Cytosolic fractions were obtained by a second centrifugation step for 30 min at 40,000 × g. The resulting membrane pellet was washed twice with 4 ml of homogenization buffer with centrifugation for 10 min at 40,000 ×g. The washed membranes were then resuspended in 1 ml of homogenization buffer. HEK-293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% l-glutamate, 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin, and 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum as the monolayer culture. Plasmid DNA was transfected using the CaCl2 precipitation protocol. 1.5 µg of plasmid DNA was dissolved in 90 µl, adjusted to 100 µl with 2.5 mCaCl2, and mixed by vortexing. An equal volume of BBS buffer (50 mm BES, pH 6.96, 280 mm NaCl, and 1.5 mm Na2HPO4) was added and incubated for 17 min at room temperature. Before preparing the CaCl2 precipitation, the HEK-293 cells were diluted as 2-ml cultures in MULTIWELLTM 6 wells (FALCON®) with a cell density of 0.1 × 106 cells/ml, and the transfection mixture was added. After 18 h cells were washed once with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated for another 48 h. HEK-293 cells were harvested using a disposable cell scraper and centrifuged at 1500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Cytosol preparation was performed as described above for Sf9 cells. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford using bovine plasma γ globulin (Bio-Rad protein assay standard I) as standard. Guanylyl cyclase activity was measured as described previously (13Behrends S. Harteneck C. Schultz G. Koesling D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21109-21113Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). YC-1 and ODQ were dissolved in 25% (v/v) Me2SO so that the final Me2SO concentration in the enzyme assay did not exceed 2.5% (v/v). At this concentration no effects of Me2SO on enzyme activity were observed. Laemmli sample buffer was added to 60 µg of cytosolic fractions (for β2 and β2 E596A) of HEK-293 cells transfected with the respective plasmids, and proteins were electrophoretically separated on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels. After electrophoretic transfer of proteins to nitrocellulose, nonspecific protein-binding sites of the membranes were blocked by incubation with TBST (Tris-buffered saline/Tween, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat dry milk at room temperature for 1 h. Membranes were washed with TBST buffer and incubated for 1.5 h at room temperature in a 1:4000 dilution of a monoclonal antibody against the GFP protein (Living Colors, CLONTECH). Membranes were washed three times with TBST buffer and then incubated with a 1:4000 dilution of a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody in TBST buffer. After washing the membranes three times with TBST buffer, protein bands were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection method. All results were controlled for their statistical significance by one-way analysis of variance followed a Newman-Keuls post test. A value of p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Using PCR, a variant cDNA of the rat β2 subunit was isolated from rat kidney (submitted to GenBankTM under the accession number AY004153). The deduced amino acid sequence of this transcript shared the start motif MYG (Fig.1), which is highly conserved between all other β subunits of soluble guanylyl cyclase including the β3 subunit from Manduca sexta (10Nighorn A. Byrnes K.A. Morton D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2525-2531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Although co-expression of the human β1 subunit with the human α1 or rat α2 subunit in Sf9 cells yielded NO and YC-1-sensitive guanylyl cyclase activity in the presence of 3 mm Mg2+ (12Koglin M. Behrends S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1494: 286-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), analogous co-expression experiments performed with the novel variant β2 subunit together with either of the α-subunits did not result in detectable guanylyl cyclase activity (Fig.2 A). The lack of catalytic activity of the β2 subunit prompted our interest in the catalytic domain of the β2 subunit in comparison with other members of the nucleotide cyclase family. Comparison of the region of the catalytic domain of the β2 subunit (position 454–596 of the rat β2 sequence in Fig. 1) showed the highest amino acid similarity (56%) with the β3 subunit from Manduca sexta (10Nighorn A. Byrnes K.A. Morton D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2525-2531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This subunit is active in the absence of a second subunit in the presence of 4 mm Mn2+. To test whether the sequence homology of the catalytic domain between the β2 and the β3 subunit also results in biochemical similarities, guanylyl cyclase activity was measured in the absence of a second subunit in the presence of 4 mm Mn2+ (Fig.2 B). Expression of the β1 subunit was used to control for endogenous guanylyl cyclase activity in Sf9 cell cytosol. Under basal conditions, significantly higher guanylyl cyclase activity was detected in cytosol from β2-versus β1-infected Sf9 cells. The addition of the NO donor DEA/NO led to a 4-fold increase in guanylyl cyclase activity in cytosol from β2- but not β1-infected Sf9 cells. YC-1 did not further stimulate guanylyl cyclase activity, as expected from its effect on α/β forms but, rather, had a slightly inhibitory effect. Mutagenesis of a glutamate within the catalytic domain of the homodimeric membrane-bound guanylyl cyclase A resulted in a constitutively active enzyme that is no longer regulated by its ligand atrial natriuretic peptide (14Wedel B.J. Foster D.C. Miller D.E. Garbers D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 459-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The analogous point mutant in the β2 subunit (β2 E596A) resulted in increased stimulation by the NO donor DEA/NO with only a slight apparent increase in basal activity (Fig. 2 B). Measurement of guanylyl cyclase activity as a function of substrate concentration for the β2 subunit and the β2 E596A mutant revealed linear Michaelis-Menten-type kinetics for both forms (Fig.3). The K m value of the E596A mutant was increased significantly in comparison with the wild type β2 subunit (TableI). The V maxvalues show that enzyme activity of the β2 E596A mutantversus wild type under basal conditions is increased to a higher extent than expected from the values in Fig. 2 Adetermined at a GTP concentration of 500 µm, which was not saturating for the β2 E596A mutant given the highK m value. Under NO-stimulated conditions, substrate affinity increased as evidenced by a decrease in K mvalues by factor 3 (β2) or 5 (β2 E596A). The V max values were increased 4-fold (β2) and 9-fold (β2 E596A) under NO-stimulated conditions.Figure 2Guanylyl cyclase activity in cytosolic fractions from Sf9 cells after infection with the indicated recombinant baculoviruses.

Open table in a new tab Data represent the means (±S.E.) of three independent experiments performed in duplicate using different cytosol preparations in the presence of 4 mm free Mn2+. Concentration response experiments using DEA/NO were performed in parallel using cytosol from Sf9-cells infected with recombinant baculoviruses for β2, β2 E596A, and α1/β1 (Fig.4). Maximal guanylyl cyclase activity was set to 100% for direct comparison of EC50 values and was 158 ± 21 pmol of cGMP/mg/min (β2), 2442 ± 233 pmol of cGMP/mg/min (β2 E596A), and 21843 ± 2432 pmol of cGMP/mg/min (α1/β1). Concentration response curves for β2 and β2 E596A were very similar and yielded indistinguishable EC50 values of 34 ± 9 and 43 ± 5 nm, respectively. Both β2 curves were shifted to the left by 1 order of magnitude in comparison to α1/β1, where a EC50 value of 414 ± 68 nm was determined in experiments performed in parallel. The high NO affinity but low maximal activity of the β2subunit raises the possibility that this subunit quenches NO, thus limiting NO availability for the more responsive heterodimeric form. EC50 values for the concentration-dependent effect of DEA/NO on α1/β1 heterodimeric guanylyl cyclase activity were tested in the presence β2subunit cytosol (0.2 mg/ml cytosolic protein) or the known NO scavenger myoglobin (0.01 mm) (Fig. 5). The EC50 values in the presence of β2 subunit (open circles, 533 ± 114 nm) or Sf9 cytosol (closed circles, 515 ± 122 nm) were not significantly different from the EC50 value in the absence of additional cytosol (compare Fig. 4). The addition of the known NO scavenger myoglobin (open squares) yielded a significantly different EC50 value of 15.0 ± 0.9 µm (p < 0.001). Maximal guanylyl cyclase activity was 73716 ± 4979 pmol of cGMP/mg/min for β1 addition, 76261 ± 5325 pmol of cGMP/mg/min for β2 addition, and 93654 ± 4912 pmol of cGMP/mg/min for myoglobin addition. The higher maximal enzyme activity with myoglobin addition did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.06). The influence of the well characterized soluble guanylyl cyclase inhibitor ODQ was tested in parallel under NO-stimulated conditions (1 µm DEA/NO) using cytosol from Sf9 cells infected with recombinant baculoviruses for β2, β2E596A, and α1/β1 (Fig.6). Maximal guanylyl cyclase activity was set to 100% for direct comparison of IC50 values and was 139 ± 32 pmol of cGMP/mg/min (β2), 2710 ± 361 pmol of cGMP/mg/min (β2 E596A), and 50838 ± 2663 pmol of cGMP/mg/min (α1/β1). The IC50 values were not significantly different with 2.4 ± 1 µm (β2), 2.5 ± 0.4 µm (β2 E596A), and 5.3 ± 1.2 µm (α1/β1). It has been shown that incubation of α/β forms of NO-sensitive guanylyl cyclase with the detergent Tween induces a loss of the prosthetic heme group and abolishes NO sensitivity (15Foerster J. Harteneck C. Malkewitz J. Schultz G. Koesling D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 380-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Experiments performed with β2 (Fig.7 A) and β2 E596A (Fig. 7 B) demonstrate that the detergent Tween prevents activation by the NO donor DEA/NO but does not abolish activation by the heme precursor protoporphyrin IX. This likely indicates that Tween leads to a loss of heme and an exchange of this prosthetic group by protoporphyrin IX. N-terminal and C-terminal GFP fusion proteins of the β2subunit were constructed in eukaryotic expression vectors and expressed in HEK-293 cells. N-terminal GFP fusion was done according to Guptaet al. (8Gupta G. Azam M. Yang L. Danziger R.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1488-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), which leads to replacement of the likely N-terminal heme binding region of the β2 subunit by the GFP protein. In the C-terminal fusion, the GFP protein replaced the potential isoprenylation site of the β2 subunit, which has been hypothesized to be important in subcellular targeting. Due to the overall lower expression in HEK-293 as opposed to Sf9 cells, enzyme activity could only be measured for β2 E596A under NO-stimulated conditions (Fig. 8). This NO-stimulated activity could be detected for the C-terminal but not the N-terminal construct, indicating the importance of the N-terminal region that likely binds a prosthetic heme group. Using confocal laser microscopy, both β2-GFP constructs were localized to the cytoplasm irrespective of the presence or absence of the isoprenylation consensus site (Fig. 8, inset). This apparent cytoplasmic localization does not exclude the possibility that the β2subunit is at least in part associated with the plasma membrane, depending on the presence of the isoprenylation consensus site. To address this point, the critical cysteine residue within the isoprenylation site of the β2 subunit was mutated to a serine, and enzyme activity of the β2 subunit and β2 C739S mutant were compared in cytosol and membrane preparations after overexpression in Sf9 cells. In the presence of 4 mm Mn2+, comparable basal and NO-stimulated enzyme activities were detected in the cytosol and membrane fractions (Fig. 9 A). Mutagenesis of C739S led to a marked increase of NO-stimulated activity in the cytosolic fraction. This increase cannot be explained solely by a shift of the mutant β2 from the membrane fraction to the cytosolic fraction because enzyme activity in the membrane fraction was also increased (Fig. 9 A). Analogous enzyme activity measurements in the presence of 3 mm Mg2+ show no significant activity for the β2 subunit but a striking increase in NO-sensitive enzyme activity of the cytosolic β2 C739S mutant (Fig. 9 B).Figure 9Guanylyl cyclase activity in cytosol and membranes from Sf9 cells after infection with β2 or β2 C739S. Fractions were measured in the presence of 4 mm Mn2+ (A) or 3 mm Mg2+ (B). Black columns represent basal conditions, and white columns NO-stimulated (100 µm DEA/NO) conditions. Data represent the means (± S.E.) of at least three independent experiments performed in duplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) A novel variant of the β2 subunit of soluble guanylyl cyclase was obtained by PCR from rat kidney. Expression of this subunit in Sf9 cells in the absence of a second subunit led to NO-sensitive guanylyl cyclase activity. Similar to the β3 subunit described in the insect Manduca sexta, enzyme activity was dependent on the presence of 4 mmMn2+. Mutagenesis of a glutamate residue to alanine, which has been shown to lead to a constitutively active homomeric guanylyl cyclase A, resulted in increased basal and NO-stimulated guanylyl cyclase activity for the β2 subunit. Abolishment of NO sensitivity in the presence of the detergent Tween and activation of the β2 subunit by the heme precursor protoporphyrin IX indicates the presence of a prosthetic heme group. After crystallization of the catalytic domain of adenylyl cyclase (16Zhang G. Liu Y. Ruoho A.E. Hurley J.H. Nature. 1997; 386: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), other nucleotide cyclases have been analyzed by homology modeling, and five important residues characteristic of heterodimeric and homodimeric forms have been identified (17Liu Y. Ruoho A.E. Rao V.D. Hurley J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13414-13419Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Whereas these residues are on one polypeptide chain in the homodimeric forms and the β2subunit, they are distributed on two different polypeptide chains in the heterodimeric forms. According to this theoretical analysis, the β2 subunit as well as the β3 subunit from Manduca sexta belong to the group of homodimeric nucleotide cyclases. The experimental data that the mammalian β2 subunit (present study) and the β3 subunit from the insect Manduca sexta (10Nighorn A. Byrnes K.A. Morton D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2525-2531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) are active in the absence of a second subunit corroborate the hypothesis that these subunits belong to the family of homodimeric or homomeric nucleotide cyclases. Overall the β3 subunit from Manduca sexta has more amino acid identity with vertebrate β1 subunits than with the β2 subunit, arguing against the hypothesis that the β2 subunit represents the mammalian ortholog of the β3 subunit (10Nighorn A. Byrnes K.A. Morton D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2525-2531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Comparison of only the region of the catalytic domain of the β2 subunit (position 454–596 of the rat β2 sequence in Fig. 1) showed highest amino acid similarity (56%) with the β3 subunit from Manduca sexta when compared with all known nucleotide cyclases. The sequence homology of the catalytic domain also results in biochemical similarities between the β2 and the β3 subunit in that guanylyl cyclase activity can only be detected in the presence of 4 mm Mn2+. Stimulation by NO donors is more pronounced for β2 versus β3. This can be explained by the presence of two cysteines in the β2 but not the β3 subunit corresponding to cysteines 78 and 214 in the rat β1 subunit (see Fig. 1) that have been shown to be critical for binding of a prosthetic heme group and activation by NO (18Friebe A. Wedel B. Harteneck C. Foerster J. Schultz G. Koesling D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1194-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Both the β2 and the β3 subunit contain a C-terminal isoprenylation consensus site. While the β3 subunit seems to be primarily associated with the plasma membrane (10Nighorn A. Byrnes K.A. Morton D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2525-2531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), enzyme activity for the β2 subunit was detectable in equal amounts in the cytosol and membrane fractions of Sf9 cells. Mutation of the isoprenylation consensus site leads to a β2 subunit that is active in the presence of 3 mm Mg2+. A possible hypothesis is that, depending on the presence or absence of a posttranslational fatty acid modification, the requirement of the enzyme for 4 mm Mn2+ is changed to physiologically occurring concentrations of Mg2+ (3 mm). It will be most interesting to test whether an analogous mutation in the β3 subunit also results in an enzyme that is active in the presence of Mg2+. Co-expression experiments of a N-terminal β2-GFP fusion construct with the α1 cDNA yielded NO-sensitive guanylyl cyclase activity in COS cells (8Gupta G. Azam M. Yang L. Danziger R.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1488-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Using an analogous β2-GFP fusion construct guanylyl cyclase activity after co-expression with the α1 cDNA was not significantly different from non-transfected HEK-293 cells, whereas co-expression of the α1 and β1 cDNAs yielded activities of 184 ± 13 pmol of cGMP/mg/min (basal) and 1574 ± 201 pmol of cGMP/mg/min (100 µm DEA/NO). Using the β2 E596A mutant expressed alone in HEK-293 cells, we could show that a C-terminal GFP fusion yields NO-sensitive guanylyl cyclase activity, whereas the N-terminal GFP fusion analogous to (8Gupta G. Azam M. Yang L. Danziger R.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1488-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) does not lead to catalytic activity. This underlines the importance of the N terminus including the amino acid start motif MYG present in the β2 variant isolated in this study that is conserved in all other known β subunits. Consistent with our findings of the importance of an intact N-terminal sequence, it has been shown for the β1 subunit that either N-terminal deletion of 64 amino acids (Ref. 19Wedel B. Harteneck C. Foerster J. Friebe A. Schultz G. Koesling D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24871-24875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, see Fig. 1) or N-terminal addition of 36 residues (20Lee Y.C. Martin E. Murad F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10763-10768Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) abolishes responsiveness of the α1/β1enzyme to NO. The lack of the N-terminal sequence including the MYG motif also explains the lack of activity of the human β2subunit recently cloned by our group (21Behrends S. Vehse K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 64-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In agreement with our data using GFP fusion proteins, a cytosolic localization of the β2 subunit was demonstrated in rat kidney by immunohistochemistry in principal cells of the collecting duct (22Mundel P. Gambaryan S. Bachmann S. Koesling D. Kriz W. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 103: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The failure to detect co-expression of an α-subunit with the β2 subunit at the same cellular location (22Mundel P. Gambaryan S. Bachmann S. Koesling D. Kriz W. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 103: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) supports our concept of a homomeric rather than heteromeric β2 guanylyl cyclase that mediates the inhibitory effect of NO on sodium reabsorption in the principal cells of the collecting duct in the absence of α subunits. This article is based in part on a doctoral study by Markus Koglin in the faculty of biology, University of Hamburg."
https://openalex.org/W2169174986,"Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 has been shown to induce ectopic expression of cardiac transcription factors and beating cardiomyocytes in non-precardiac mesodermal cells, suggesting that BMP-2 is an inductive signaling molecule that participates in cardiac development. However, direct evidence of the effects of BMP-2 on cardiac myocytes has not been reported. To examine the role of BMP-2 and its receptors, we studied the ability of BMP-2 to promote survival of isolated neonatal rat cardiac myocytes. BMP receptors IA, IB, and II and activin receptor I were found to be expressed in myocytes, and BMP-2 phosphorylated Smad1 and p38 MAPK. Interestingly, BMP-2 promoted survival and inhibited apoptosis of serum-deprived myocytes, although it did not strongly induce hypertrophic growth. To explore the mechanisms for this protective effect, an adenovirus-based vector system was used. Similar to BMP-2, Smad1 promoted survival that was repressed by Smad6. Moreover, BMP-2 and Smad1 enhanced the expression of the anti-apoptotic molecule Bcl-xL. Antisense oligonucleotides to bcl-xLattenuated the survival effected by BMP-2. Overall, our findings suggest that BMP-2 prevents apoptosis of myocytes by induction of Bcl-xLvia a Smad1 pathway and might be a novel survival factor without any hypertrophic effect on myocytes. Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 has been shown to induce ectopic expression of cardiac transcription factors and beating cardiomyocytes in non-precardiac mesodermal cells, suggesting that BMP-2 is an inductive signaling molecule that participates in cardiac development. However, direct evidence of the effects of BMP-2 on cardiac myocytes has not been reported. To examine the role of BMP-2 and its receptors, we studied the ability of BMP-2 to promote survival of isolated neonatal rat cardiac myocytes. BMP receptors IA, IB, and II and activin receptor I were found to be expressed in myocytes, and BMP-2 phosphorylated Smad1 and p38 MAPK. Interestingly, BMP-2 promoted survival and inhibited apoptosis of serum-deprived myocytes, although it did not strongly induce hypertrophic growth. To explore the mechanisms for this protective effect, an adenovirus-based vector system was used. Similar to BMP-2, Smad1 promoted survival that was repressed by Smad6. Moreover, BMP-2 and Smad1 enhanced the expression of the anti-apoptotic molecule Bcl-xL. Antisense oligonucleotides to bcl-xLattenuated the survival effected by BMP-2. Overall, our findings suggest that BMP-2 prevents apoptosis of myocytes by induction of Bcl-xLvia a Smad1 pathway and might be a novel survival factor without any hypertrophic effect on myocytes. bone morphogenetic protein BMP receptor mitogen-activated protein kinase transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase-1 MAP kinase kinase c-Jun N-terminal kinase leukemia inhibitory factor extracellular signal-regulated kinase polymerase chain reaction fetal calf serum brain natriuretic peptide phosphate-buffered saline 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5- (3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay activin receptor I signal transducer and activator of transcription Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)1-2, a member of the transforming growth factor-β superfamily, signals through the heterotetrameric complex of type I and II serine/threonine kinase receptors (1Massague J.

Downstream of this receptor complex, at least two distinct intracellular pathways have been suggested to mediate inductive signals from the cell membrane to the nucleus. One pathway involves a family of transcription factors collectively known as Smad proteins. Thus far, eight mammalian Smad proteins, specified as Smad1–8, have been isolated. They can be classified into three subgroups by their structures and functions: pathway-restricted, common mediator, and inhibitory Smad proteins. Smad1, Smad5, and probably Smad8/MADH6 are pathway-restricted Smad proteins, which are activated by BMP receptors. Smad4 is a common mediator Smad, whereas Smad6 and Smad7 are classified in the inhibitory Smad subgroup. Following binding of BMPs to their receptors, Smad1 and Smad5 are phosphorylated by BMP receptors, form hetero-oligomeric complexes with Smad4, translocate into the nucleus, and modulate transcription of a variety of target genes (3Heldin C.H.

Another pathway is the MAPK cascade initiated by TAK-1 (6Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Oishi I. Ueno N. Taniguchi T. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1995; 270: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar). TAK-1 was originally identified as a member of the MAPK kinase kinase family activated in response to transforming growth factor-β and BMP-4 (6Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Oishi I. Ueno N. Taniguchi T. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1995; 270: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been reported that TAK-1 functions as a mediator of the MKK6/p38 MAPK and MKK7/JNK pathways (7Moriguchi T. Kuroyanagi N. Yamaguchi K. Gotoh Y. Irie K. Kano T. Shirakabe K.

After initial activation of receptors, BMP-2 elicits multiple effects ranging from cell differentiation to regulation of early embryogenesis. BMP-2 was originally identified as a molecule that induces bone and cartilage formation and is now considered a multifunctional cytokine (10Wozney J.M. Rosen V. Celeste A.J. Mitsock L.M. Whitters M.J. Kriz R.W. Hewick R.M. Wang E.A. Science. 1988; 242: 1528-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (3334) Google Scholar, 11Hogan B.L. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1580-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1718) Google Scholar). Interestingly, BMP-2 induces ectopic expression of cardiac transcription factors and beating cardiomyocytes in non-precardiac mesodermal chick cells, and BMP-2-deficient mouse embryos exhibit a defect in cardiac development manifested by abnormal development of the heart (12Rosen V. Thies R.S. Trends Genet. 1992; 8: 97-102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 13Reddi A.H. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). These data suggest that BMPs are inductive signaling molecules that participate in development of the heart. In addition to cardiac development, BMP-2 has been reported to exert both pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic effects, depending on cell types and circumstances (14Yokouchi Y. Sakiyama J. Kameda T. Iba H. Suzuki A. Ueno N. Kuroiwa A. Development. 1996; 122: 3725-3734Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Iwasaki S. Iguchi M. Watanabe K. Hoshino R. Tsujimoto M. Kohno M. J. Biol.

Med. 1999; 189: 1139-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is of interest to examine whether BMP-2 might also regulate survival of cardiac myocytes. Recent evidence that apoptosis of cardiac myocytes is a feature in several myocardial disease states, including ischemic heart disease and congestive heart failure, has raised hopes that inhibition of myocyte apoptosis can prevent the loss of contractile cells and thus provide a new target in a multimodal therapeutic approach to cardiac disease (17Haunstetter A. Izumo S. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 1111-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). Several groups have reported that insulin-like growth factor-1, cardiotrophin-1, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and neuregulin reduce myocyte apoptosis after ischemia, serum withdrawal, myocyte stretch, and treatment with the cardiotoxic hemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin (18Buerke M.

Although cardioprotective factors can thus be considered clinically suitable for treating heart failure, the hypertrophic effect accompanying their cardioprotective function may promote structural and geometric changes in the left ventricle that are commonly referred to as remodeling. Progressive, adverse remodeling of the myocardium may lead to ventricular dilatation and congestive heart failure (23Zannad F. Alla F. Dousset B. Peres A. Pitt B. Circulation. 2000; 102: 2700-2706Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). Our study demonstrates that human BMP-2 promotes survival of neonatal rat cardiac myocytes in vitro without any significant change in cell size. This survival effect is accompanied by a marked reduction in the proportion of apoptotic cells in BMP-2-treated cultures. We also describe the survival effect of BMP-2 involving an increase in Bcl-xL via a Smad1 signaling pathway. These data support the concept that the BMP-2/Smad1 signaling system plays an important role in regulation of the myocardium and suggest that BMP-2 as an attenuator of apoptosis in cardiac myocytes has therapeutic and prognostic potential. Recombinant human BMP-2 (80 mg/ml; Yamanouchi Co., Ltd., Tokyo), recombinant human LIF (106 units/ml; PeproTech EC, Ltd., London), and norepinephrine (1 mg/ml; Sankyo Co., Ltd., Tokyo) were used this study. Anti-Smad1, anti-Smad6, anti-p38 MAPK, anti-ERK1/2, anti-JNK, anti-Bcl-xL, and anti-Bcl-2 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-α-tubulin monoclonal antibody was from Calbiochem, and phospho-Smad1, p38 MAPK, and ERK1/2 were from New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, MA). All other chemicals were reagents of molecular biology grade obtained from standard commercial sources. Primary cultures of neonatal cardiac myocytes were prepared from the ventricles of 1–2-day-old Wistar rats obtained from Kiwa Dobutsu (Wakayama, Japan) as described previously (24Kunisada K. Hirota H. Fujio Y. Matsui H. Tani Y. Yamauchi-Takihara K. Kishimoto T. Circulation. 1996; 94: 2626-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). 10 µg of total RNA was prepared by the acid guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform method (25Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63088) Google Scholar). Total RNA (0.1 µg) was subjected to first-strand synthesis using oligo(dT) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala) and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C for 2 h, and the reaction was stopped by incubation at 70 °C for 10 min. The primers used for gene amplification of BMP-2, BMP receptors (BMPRs), and β-tubulin by PCR were synthesized according to the sequence previously reported (26Roelen B.A. Goumans M.J. van Rooijen M.A. Mummery C.L.

After being cultured with Medium 199 with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) for 24 h, the medium was changed to Medium 199 with 1% FCS and incubated for 24 h. Thereafter, cardiac myocytes were cultured without serum for another 12 h. The cells were then stimulated with BMP-2. Western blotting was performed as previously described (24Kunisada K. Hirota H. Fujio Y. Matsui H. Tani Y. Yamauchi-Takihara K. Kishimoto T. Circulation. 1996; 94: 2626-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Northern blotting was performed as previously described (29Boise L.H. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Postema C.E. Ding L. Lindsten T. Turka L.A. Mao X. Nunez G. Thompson C.B. Cell. 1993; 74: 597-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2917) Google Scholar). RNAs from cardiac myocytes were prepared as described above. Mouse bcl-x cDNA, kindly donated by Dr. Y. Tsujimoto (Osaka University Medical School), was used as a probe. Mouse brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) cDNA, kindly donated by Dr. K. R. Chien (University of California, San Diego, CA), was used as a probe. Mouse junB cDNA was purchased from American Type Culture Collection. For examination of changes in myocyte phenotypes produced by BMP-2, LIF, and norepinephrine, cardiac myocytes were grown on slides and fixed in 2% (w/v) formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100/phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Following three PBS washes, the chamber slides were incubated in 1% bovine serum albumin/PBS for 1 h to block nonspecific sites. Subsequently, the cells were stained for 1 h in 0.05% Tween 20 and 1% bovine serum albumin/PBS with a mouse anti-rabbit α-actinin monoclonal antibody. Following another three PBS washes, the slides were incubated for 30 min in 0.05% Tween 20 and 1% bovine serum albumin/PBS with rhodamine B isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG as a secondary antibody and finally mounted on glass coverslips. To measure the cell-surface areas, light photomicrographs of beating cells (100 cells from six visual fields) were obtained with an Olympus IMT-2 microscope, and cell surfaces were traced with the Macscope program (Mitani Co., Tokyo). To examine the effect of BMP-2 on protein synthesis, the incorporation of [3H]leucine was measured. Cultured myocytes were treated with BMP-2 (80 ng/ml), LIF (1 × 103 units/ml), or norepinephrine (2 µg/ml) and co-incubated with [3H]leucine (1 µCi/ml) for 24 h. The cells were washed three times with PBS and then treated with 5% trichloroacetic at 4 °C for 10 min to precipitate the protein. The precipitates were dissolved in 0.1 n NaOH, and aliquots were counted with a scintillation counter. Cell viability was quantitated with the MTS (inner salt) cell respiratory assay (Promega, Madison, WI) (30Berridge M.V. Tan A.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 303: 474-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar,31Cory A.H. Owen T.C. Barltrop J.A. Cory J.G. Cancer Commun. 1991; 3: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). Neonatal rat cardiac myocytes were cultured at a density of 2 × 104/100 µl in 96-well dishes. After culturing in Medium 199 with 10% FCS for 24 h, the medium was changed to Medium 199 with 1% FCS, and the cells were incubated for 24 h. Next, the cardiac myocytes were cultured without serum for another 12 h and stimulated with BMP-2 or LIF. 48 h later, MTS was incubated with the cells for 1 h at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. The absorbance was then recorded at 490 nm with a 96-well plate reader. Each experiment was carried out in triplicate and repeated in three independent experiments. Apoptosis was evaluated with the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay and cell death detection ELISA. The TUNEL assay was performed as previously described (32Negoro S. Oh H. Tone E. Kunisada K. Fujio Y. Kenneth W. Kishimoto T. Yamauchi-Takihara K. Circulation. 2001; 103: 555-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), and the cells were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. For quantitative analysis, 600 α-actinin-positive cardiac myocytes were counted, and the number of TUNEL-positive cells among them was expressed as a percentage. The cell death detection assay (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) measures the presence of the soluble histone·DNA complex as a result of DNA fragmentation (33Thome M. Schneider P. Hofmann K. Fickenscher H. Meinl E. Neipel F. Mattmann C. Burns K. Bodmer J.L. Schroter M. Scaffidi C. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Tschopp J. Nature. 1997; 386: 517-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). For this assay, neonatal rat cardiac myocytes were cultured at a density of 5 × 105/1 ml in 6-cm dishes. After culturing in Medium 199 with 10% FCS for 24 h, the medium was changed to Medium 199 with 1% FCS, and the cells were incubated for 24 h. Next, the cardiac myocytes were cultured without serum for another 12 h and stimulated with BMP-2. 48 h later, all cells were collected in lysis buffer and subjected to capture ELISA according to the manufacturer's protocol. Each experiment was carried out in triplicate and repeated in three independent experiments. The antisense and sense phosphorothioate oligonucleotides were designed as described by Wang et al.(34Wang Z. Karras J.G. Howard R.G. Rothstein T.L. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 3722-3725PubMed Google Scholar): antisense, CTGAGACATTTTTAT and sense, ATAAAAATGTCTCAG. This region of murine bcl-x L is completely identical to that of rat bcl-x L (35Shiraiwa N.

Antisense oligonucleotide assays were performed according to previously described methods (36Ackermann E.J. Taylor J.K. Narayana R. Bennett C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11245-11252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The recombinant adenoviruses expressing Smad proteins were kindly donated by Dr. K. Miyazono (Tokyo University Medical School) (37Fujii M. Takeda K. Imamura T. Aoki H. Sampath T.K. Enomoto S. Kawabata M. Kato M. Ichijo H. Miyazono K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3801-3813Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The recombinant viruses were purified and concentrated as described previously (38Becker T.C. Noel R.J. Coats W.S. Gomez-Foix A.M. Alam T. Gerard R.D. Newgard C.B. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 161-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). They were prepared for experiments at high multiplicity of infections. 36 h after plating, cardiac myocytes were transfected with adenoviral vectors in Medium 199 with 10% FCS at a multiplicity of infection of 20 and incubated for 12 h. After removal of the viral suspension, cardiac myocytes were serum-starved for 6 h and stimulated with reagents. The adenoviral vector expressing β-galactosidase (referred to as Ad-β-gal) was used as a control. Data are presented as means ± S.E. Statistical analysis was carried out using unpaired Student'st tests. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. mRNA expression of BMP receptors was analyzed in cardiac myocytes grown in the absence or presence of BMP-2 (80 ng/ml). Cultures were assayed for the expression of BMP-2, BMPR-IA, BMPR-IB, BMPR-II, and activin receptor I (ActR-I) mRNAs by reverse transcription-PCR after 3 h in culture. As shown in Fig.1, mRNAs for BMPR-IB, ActR-I, and BMPR-II were readily apparent in control cultures, whereas mRNAs for BMP-2 and BMPR-IA were less abundant. Cultures grown in the presence of BMP-2 expressed BMP-2, BMPR-IA, BMPR-II, and ActR-I mRNAs. Although this PCR method is not quantitative, the induction of BMP-2 and BMPR-IA mRNAs following exposure to BMP-2 was striking. These observations indicate that treatment with BMP-2 can activate heart cells through its receptors. To determine whether BMP-2 transduces signals in neonatal cardiac myocytes, we examined the phosphorylation of Smad1, p38 MAPK, ERK1/2, and JNK after BMP-2 stimulation by Western blot analysis. After 8 h of culture in serum-deprived medium, cardiac myocytes were stimulated with BMP-2 (80 ng/ml) for the times indicated (Fig. 2 A). Smad1 was rapidly phosphorylated within 15 min in cardiac myocytes, followed by a decrease within 2 h. As shown in Fig. 2 B, BMP-2 also activated Smad1 in a dose-dependent manner. The amounts of Smad1 protein were the same for each period (Fig. 2, A andB, lower panels). In the MAPK family, p38 MAPK was rapidly phosphorylated within 5 min, whereas ERK1/2 and JNK were not activated (Fig. 2 C). The induction of immediate-early genes precedes the late phenotypic changes in cardiomyocytes following stimulation of G-protein-coupled receptorsin vitro (39Shubeita H.E. McDonough P.M. Harris A.N.

A. 1988; 85: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). We therefore determined whether stimulation of cardiomyocytes with BMP-2 would induce junB gene expression. Stimulation with BMP-2 resulted in the rapid and transient induction ofjunB mRNA (Fig.3 A). BMP-2 also inducedjunB mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3 B). Since the reactivation of an embryonic pattern of gene expression is a hallmark of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, we therefore determined whether stimulation of cardiomyocytes with BMP-2 would induce BNP gene expression. As shown in Fig. 3 C, enhancement of BNP mRNA expression was detected within 6 h, with a maximum level at 12 h, followed by a decrease within 24 h. Neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes respond to various hypertrophic stimuli by an increase in individual cell size, assembly of myofibrils, and induction of the BNP gene. To assess the effects of BMP-2 on these morphological features of a hypertrophic response, cardiomyocytes were treated with BMP-2 (80 ng/ml) and stained with an anti-α-actinin antibody. Unstimulated cells and LIF/norepinephrine-treated cells served as negative and positive controls, respectively. Interestingly, BMP-2 did not induce a strong hypertrophic response in cardiac myocytes in comparison with LIF and norepinephrine, but did induce BNP gene expression (Fig.4 A). To quantify hypertrophic effects, we measured the cell-surface area and the incorporation of [3H]leucine as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 4 (B and C), the increase in cell size and [3H]leucine incorporation induced by BMP-2 was significantly less than those induced by LIF or norepinephrine. These findings suggest that the hypertrophic effects of BMP-2 are significantly less than those of LIF and norepinephrine. Primary cultures of neonatal rat ventricular myocytes maintained in serum-free medium exhibited a gradual reduction in cell numbers. We performed an MTS cell respiration assay to measure cell viability in primary cultures of neonatal rat cardiac myocytes. The myocytes were cultured in the presence or absence of BMP-2 for 48 h. As shown in Fig.5 A, BMP-2 promoted myocardial cell survival in a dose-dependent manner. LIF-treated cells served as positive controls. On the other hand, BMP-2 could not promote survival of cardiac non-myocytes (data not shown). We examined next whether the survival effect of BMP-2 was mediated by inhibition of programmed cell death (apoptosis). We performed the TUNEL assay and cell death detection ELISA on primary cultures of neonatal rat cardiac myocytes. About 18% of the cardiac myocytes maintained in serum-deprived medium for 48 h showed positive TUNEL staining (Fig. 5 B). As shown in Fig. 5 C, BMP-2 (80 ng/ml) significantly reduced TUNEL-positive cells. Cell death detection ELISA also demonstrated that BMP-2 significantly suppressed serum deprivation-induced nuclear fragmentation (Fig. 5 D). These results indicate that BMP-2 acts as a survival factor at least in part by preventing programmed cell death in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes. To investigate the molecular mechanism that relates to the anti-apoptotic effect of BMP-2, we examined the expression ofbcl-x L and bcl-2, which are anti-apoptotic members of bcl-2 families. Neonatal rat cardiac myocytes were treated with BMP-2 (80 ng/ml) for the indicated periods of time. Upon examination by Northern blot analysis, expression of bcl-x L and bcl-2 mRNAs showed enhancement of bcl-x L gene expression in cardiac myocytes, with the maximum level attained at 24 h, whereas no enhancement of bcl-2 gene expression was detected (Fig.6, A and B). We also examined the expression of Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 proteins by Western blot analysis in cardiac myocytes treated with BMP-2 (80 ng/ml) for 24 h. A high level of Bcl-xL was also detected in BMP-2-treated cells, but no up-regulation of Bcl-2 (Fig. 6,C and D). These results indicate that BMP-2 may promote cardiac myocyte survival through the induction of Bcl-xL. To demonstrate the specificity of bcl-x L antisense oligonucleotides, cardiac myocytes were treated with bcl-x L antisense or sense oligonucleotides in the presence or absence of BMP-2 for 48 h. The myocytes were subsequently examined with the MTS cell respiratory assay. In the presence of antisense oligonucleotides, the increase in Bcl-xL induced by BMP-2 was inhibited, but not in the presence of sense oligonucleotides (Fig.7 A). Antisense oligonucleotides against bcl-x L mRNA canceled the BMP-2-mediated protective effect on cell survival (Fig.7 B). Although the sense nucleotides also inhibited BMP-2-mediated cell protection, their inhibitory effect was significantly less than that of antisense oligonucleotides (Fig.7 B). We investigated the molecular mechanisms that regulate bcl-x L gene expression upon BMP-2 stimulation in cardiac myocytes using an adenovirus-based vector system that allows for highly efficient transfection of DNAs into many cell types. In our study, we demonstrated that activation of BMP receptors resulted in the activation of downstream signaling pathways, including Smad1 and p38 MAPK. To identify the downstream effector for BMP-2-mediated protection of cell survival through the induction ofbcl-x L, the effects of Smad1 on cell survival andbcl-x L induction were examined. We performed an MTS respiratory cell assay, a TUNEL assay, and cell death detection ELISA in cultured cardiac myocytes transfected with adenoviral vectors expressing Smad1 (referred to as Ad-Smad1) in the presence or absence of BMP-2 for 48 h. Interestingly, the phosphorylation of Smad1 was detected in cultured cardiac myocytes transfected with Ad-Smad1 (Fig.8 A). As shown in Fig.8 B, Smad1 promoted cell survival, which was enhanced by the presence of BMP-2. TUNEL-positive cells were significantly reduced in cardiac myocytes transfected with Ad-Smad1 compared with those in untransfected cardiac myocytes (Fig. 8 C). Cell death detection ELISA also showed that fragmented DNA was significantly reduced in cardiac myocytes transfected with Ad-Smad1 (Fig.8 D). Altogether, these results indicate that the survival effect of Smad1 is mediated by inhibition of apoptosis. Moreover, the expression of the bcl-x L gene and protein was increased in cultured cardiac myocytes transfected with Ad-Smad1 (Fig.9, A–D). These findings suggest that BMP-2 promotes cardiac muscle survival through the induction of bcl-x L via the Smad signaling pathway.Figure 9Smad1 induces bcl-x Lin neonatal rat cardiac myocyte primary cultures.

https://openalex.org/W2055345465,"Rabbit reticulocyte lysate contains a multiprotein chaperone system that assembles the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) into a complex with hsp90 and converts the hormone binding domain of the receptor to its high affinity steroid binding state. This system has been resolved into five proteins, with hsp90 and hsp70 being essential and Hop, hsp40, and p23 acting as co-chaperones that optimize assembly. Hop binds independently to hsp70 and hsp90 to form an hsp90·Hop·hsp70 complex that acts as a machinery to open up the GR steroid binding site. Because purified hsp90 and hsp70 are sufficient for some activation of GR steroid binding activity, some investigators have rejected any role for Hop in GR·hsp90 heterocomplex assembly. Here, we counter that impression by showing that all of the Hop in reticulocyte lysate is present in an hsp90·Hop·hsp70 complex with a stoichiometry of 2:1:1. The complex accounts for ∼30% of the hsp90 and ∼9% of the hsp70 in lysate, and upon Sephacryl S-300 chromatography the GR·hsp90 assembly activity resides in the peak containing Hop-bound hsp90. Consistent with the notion that the two essential chaperones cooperate with each other to open up the steroid binding site, we also show that purified hsp90 and hsp70 interact directly with each other to form weak hsp90·hsp70 complexes with a stoichiometry of 2:1.

In addition to bringing hsp70 and hsp90 together into the machinery for opening the steroid binding cleft in the GR LBD (14Dittmar K.D. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13047-13054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), studies of purified Hop·hsp90 interaction show that Hop inhibits hsp90 ATPase activity (27Prodromou C.

Inasmuch as hsp90 ATPase activity is required to generate steroid binding activity (29Grenert J.P. Johnson B.D. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17525-17533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) and the presence of Hop in the purified five-protein system accelerates the rate at which GR steroid binding activity is generated (12Morishima Y.

Hutchison K.A. Sanchez E.R. Randall S.K. Pratt W.B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7325-7329Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A factor that was separated from the complex during the ammonium sulfate step was required for efficient heterocomplex reconstitution (30Scherrer L.C. Hutchison K.A. Sanchez E.R. Randall S.K. Pratt W.B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7325-7329Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and this factor was identified as p23 (31Hutchison K.A. Stancato L.F. Owens-Grillo J.K. Johnson J.L. Krishna P. Toft D.O. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18841-18847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Subsequently, heterocomplexes containing hsp90, Hop, and hsp70 were immunoadsorbed from reticulocyte lysate with monoclonal antibodies against hsp90 (32Hutchison K.A. Dittmar K.D. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27894-27899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or Hop (14Dittmar K.D. Pratt W.B. J. Biol.

This multiprotein chaperone complex, originally called a “foldosome” (32Hutchison K.A. Dittmar K.D. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27894-27899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is now known as the hsp90/hsp70-based chaperone machinery. Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) contains similar hsp90(hsp82)·Hop(Sti1)·hsp70(Ssa) complexes (33Chang H.C.J. Lindquist S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24983-24988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and mutation ofsti1 results in decreased GR activation of a reporter genein vivo (34Chang H.C.J. Nathan D.F. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar).These observations suggest that the hsp90·Hop·hsp70 chaperone machinery plays a role in GR·hsp90 heterocomplex assembly under cell-free conditions by reticulocyte lysate and by yeast in vivo, but Hop is not essential in either case. Immune depletion of Hop from reticulocyte lysate, for example, reduces its ability to generate GR steroid binding activity by 50% (12Morishima Y. Kanelakis K.C. Silverstein A.M. Dittmar K.D.

Chem. 2000; 275: 6894-6900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and Sti1mutant yeast still have one-third the GR activity of wild-type yeast at high hormone concentration (34Chang H.C.J. Nathan D.F. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Recently, studies utilizing purified proteins for GR·hsp90 assembly have caused some investigators to totally repudiate the notion of the hsp90/hsp70-based chaperone machinery (35Rajapandi T. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22597-22604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In a purified protein assembly system, GR steroid binding activity can be generated with a combination of the core chaperones hsp90 and hsp70 without Hop or hsp40 (12Morishima Y. Kanelakis K.C. Silverstein A.M. Dittmar K.D. Estrada L. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6894-6900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 35Rajapandi T. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22597-22604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Also, GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes can be assembled by purified proteins in a two-step procedure that does not involve prior formation of the hsp90·Hop·hsp70 assembly machinery (36Morishima Y. Murphy P.J.M. Li D.P. Sanchez E.R. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18054-18060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 37Morishima Y. Kanelakis K.C. Murphy P.J.M. Shewach D.S. Pratt W.B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1109-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, we have shown that the rate of GR·hsp90 heterocomplex assembly is accelerated markedly when Hop is added to a mixture of purified hsp90, hsp70, YDJ-1, and p23 (12Morishima Y. Kanelakis K.C. Silverstein A.M. Dittmar K.D. Estrada L. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6894-6900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Because Hop binds to hsp70 and hsp90, it co-purifies with both, and fastidious purification procedures are required to assure Hop-free preparations of these chaperones (12Morishima Y. Kanelakis K.C. Silverstein A.M. Dittmar K.D. Estrada L. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6894-6900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). It is likely that Hop contamination of the purified chaperones accounts for the difference between those who have concluded that Hop has no effect (35Rajapandi T. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 32973-32979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) who have shown that the presence of Hop in a purified five-protein system optimizes receptor·hsp90 heterocomplex assembly.Although assembly with the purified chaperones is useful for studying the mechanism by which GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes are formed and how steroid binding sites are created, the purified system does not replicate the conditions of reticulocyte lysate. The concentrations of hsp90 and hsp70 in the purified system, for example, are several times those of reticulocyte lysate. Here, we revisit the reticulocyte lysate system to determine the relative abundance of hsp90, hsp70, and Hop and the amount of each protein that is present in the chaperone machinery. We find that all of the Hop, ∼30% of the hsp90, and ∼9% of the hsp70 in rabbit reticulocyte lysate exist in hsp90·Hop·hsp70 heterocomplexes. When the reticulocyte lysate is separated into two pooled fractions by molecular sieve chromatography, 92% of the ability to activate GR steroid binding activity resides in the largeM r peak of hsp90, which contains 92% of the Hop. A second pool of fractions containing the unbound hsp90 (38%) and hsp70 (53%) and 8% of the Hop has a low GR activating activity. This suggests that in reticulocyte lysate the Hop-containing chaperone machinery plays the major role in GR·hsp90 heterocomplex assembly, with free hsp90 and hsp70 playing a considerably lesser role. We have determined by both native gel electrophoresis and cross-linking that the chaperone machinery in reticulocyte lysate possesses an hsp90:Hop:hsp70 stoichiometry of 2:1:1. We also show by cross-linking that purified hsp90 and hsp70 bind weakly to each other in the absence of Hop, producing an hsp90·hsp70 complex with a stoichiometry of 2:1. This is consistent with the notion (37Morishima Y. Kanelakis K.C. Murphy P.J.M. Shewach D.S. Pratt W.B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1109-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) that hsp90 and hsp70 interact directly with each other while the steroid binding cleft is being opened by either the chaperone machinery or by the purified chaperones without Hop.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsUntreated rabbit reticulocyte lysate was purchased from Green Hectares (Oregon, WI).

At the end of the incubation, the pellets were washed twice with 1 ml of ice-cold TEGM buffer (TEG with 20 mm sodium molybdate) and assayed for steroid binding capacity.Assay of Steroid Binding CapacityImmune pellets to be assayed for steroid binding were incubated overnight at 4 °C in 50 µl of HEM buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.35, 1 mmEDTA, 20 mm molybdate) plus 50 nm[3H]triamcinolone acetonide. Samples were then washed three times with 1 ml of TEGM and counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The steroid binding is expressed as counts per minute of [3H]triamcinolone acetonide bound/FiGR immunopellet prepared from 50 µl of Sf9 cytosol.Gel Electrophoresis and Western BlottingImmune pellets were resolved on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes. The membranes were probed with 0.25 µg/ml BuGR for GR or 1 µg/ml AC88 for hsp90. The immunoblots were then incubated a second time with the appropriate125I-conjugated or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated counterantibody to visualize the immunoreactive bands. For electrophoresis under non-denaturing conditions, 10 µl of reticulocyte lysate was mixed with 50 µl of detergent-free buffer (312 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 50% glycerol, 0.05% bromphenol blue), and proteins were resolved on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel, followed by Western blotting. The immunoblots were probed with AC88 for hsp90, 1 µg/ml N27F3-4 for hsp70, or 0.1% DS14F5 mouse ascites for Hop. Molecular weight markers for non-denaturing gels were bovine serum albumin, monomer (66,000) and dimer (132,000), and Jack bean urease, trimer (272,000) and hexamer (545,000).Glutaraldehyde Cross-linking of Purified ProteinsFor cross-linking of purified hsp90 or hsp70, 15 µg of purified protein was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 0.8 mmglutaraldehyde in a final volume of 50 µl adjusted with HKD buffer. The cross-linking was terminated by adding 12 µl of 0.5 mTris, pH 8.0, and continuing incubation for 30 min at room temperature. Proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 6% gels followed by Western blotting.Relative Abundance of Proteins in Heterocomplexes and Reticulocyte LysateFor determining stoichiometry of hsp90·Hop·hsp70 heterocomplexes, 50-µl aliquots of reticulocyte lysate were immunoadsorbed to 18 µl of protein A-Sepharose prebound with 0.5 µl (∼7 µg) of DS14F5 antibody against Hop or non-immune mouse IgG. The samples were rotated at 4 °C for 2 h, and immunopellets were washed three times with 1 ml of TEG buffer. Relative amounts of hsp90 and hsp70 in immunoadsorbed Hop complexes were estimated by resolving the immune pellet proteins on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and staining with Coomassie Blue. Ratios of hsp90 to hsp70 were determined by scanning multiple stained bands. For cross-linking, Hop immune pellets were suspended in 50 µl of HKD buffer and incubated with 0.4 mm glutaraldehyde as described above.To determine the concentration of Hop, hsp90 and hsp70 in reticulocyte lysate, aliquots of lysate were electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels that also contained various amounts of purified hsp90, hsp70, and Hop to provide a standard curve for each protein. Immunoblots were prepared and probed with monoclonal IgGs against each protein, followed by incubation with 125I-labeled anti-IgG counterantibody. Samples and purified standards were then excised and counted to permit calculation of the concentration of each protein.Protein Purificationhsp90 and hsp70 were purified from rabbit reticulocyte lysate by sequential chromatography on DE52, hydroxyapatite, and ATP-agarose as described previously (38Hutchison K.A.

Purification of human Hop was carried out in a similar manner by sequential chromatography on DE52 and hydroxyapatite. In all cases the protein-containing fractions were identified by immunoblotting, and fractions from the final purification step were pooled, concentrated by Amicon filtration, dialyzed against HKD buffer, flash frozen and stored at −70 °C.Fractionation of Reticulocyte LysateReticulocyte lysate (500 µl) was applied to a column (1.5 × 113 cm) of Sephacryl S-300, and the column was eluted with HKD buffer. Aliquots (100 µl) of each 2.5-ml fraction were assayed for hsp90, hsp70, and Hop by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting, and total protein was assayed by the Bradford method. The indicated fractions were pooled and contracted to a volume of 300 µl by Amicon filtration. Aliquots (40 µl) of each contracted pool were assayed for GR·hsp90 heterocomplex reconstitution as described above. Unliganded steroid receptors exist in cytosols in a heterocomplex with the ubiquitous protein chaperone hsp901 (for review, see Ref.1Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr.

https://openalex.org/W2000576582,"The reproductive capacity of the mammary epithelial stem cell is reduced coincident with the number of symmetric divisions it must perform. In a study of FVB/N mice with the transgene, WAP-TGFbeta1, we discovered that mammary epithelial stem cells were prematurely aged due to ectopic expression of TGF-beta1. To test whether premature aging of mammary epithelial stem cells would have an impact on susceptibility or resistance to mammary cancer, female littermates from FVB/N x WAP-TGF-beta1 mating were injected with mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) at 8-10 weeks of age. A total of 44 females were inoculated, maintained as breeders and observed for tumor development for up to 18 months. Only one mammary tumor appeared in 17 TGF-beta1 females while 15 were collected from 29 wild type sisters. Premalignant mammary epithelial cells in infected glands were identified by transplantation of single cell (1 x 10(5)) suspensions into nulliparous hosts and testing for hyperplastic outgrowth. Although the number of positive takes was significantly reduced with TGF-beta1 cells, both MMTV-infected TGF-beta1 and wild type cells produced hyperplastic outgrowths suggesting that premalignant transformation was achieved in each group. The results suggest a positive correlation between the procreative life-span of mammary epithelial stem cells and mammary cancer risk."

Conversion of biologically inactive forms of Cbl, such as CNCbl (vitamin B12) to AdoCbl must occur before it can function as a coenzyme. This conversion requires reduction of the cobalt atom in the corrin ring to its Co(I) state before it can be covalently attached to the 5′-deoxyadenosyl moiety from ATP to yield AdoCbl. The process was thought to require three enzymic activities (7Walker G.A. Murphy S. Huennekens F.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1969; 134: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar): a cob(III)alamin reductase (EC 1.6.99.8), a cob(II)alamin reductase (EC 1.6.99.9), and an ATP:co(I)rrinoid adenosyltransferase (EC 2.5.1.17) (CobA in Salmonella enterica).

The corrinoid reducing activities described to date in procaryotes were reported to require pyridine nucleotides and free flavin nucleotides for activity (7Walker G.A. Murphy S. Huennekens F.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1969; 134: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 8Brady R.O. Castanera E.G. Barker H.A. J. Biol.

Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7452-7454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and thus activity has been attributed to easily dissociable flavoproteins. However, it was recently shown that co(III)rrinoid reduction can be chemically achieved by dihydroflavin nucleotides in the absence of any enzymes (20Fonseca M.V. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4304-4309Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The identity of the enzyme catalyzing the reduction of Co(II) to Co(I) remained unknown. Although a cob(II)yrinic acida,c-diamide reductase was isolated fromPseudomonas denitrificans, neither the enzyme nor the gene responsible for this activity was identified (19Blanche F. Maton L. Debussche L. Thibaut D. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7452-7454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).At present, the only well documented cob(II)alamin reduction reaction is the one required for reductive activation of the E. colimethionine synthase enzyme (MetH). The MetH enzyme becomes inactive once every 2,000 turnovers when cob(I)alamin oxidizes to cob(II)alamin (21Hoover D.M. Jarrett J.T. Sands R.H. Dunham W.R. Ludwig M.L. Matthews R.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The electrons for the reduction of cob(II)alamin to cob(I)alamin in MetH are provided by reduced flavodoxin (FldA) (22Fujii K. Huennekens F.M. J. Biol.

The data presented herein show that the NADP+:ferredoxin (flavodoxin) reductase (Fpr) and FldA proteins can reduce co(III)rrinoids to co(I)rrinoids, the substrates of the CobA. The results from spectroscopic analyses and enzymic and biological activity assays are reported to show that the product of the in vitroadenosylation reaction was the adenosylated derivative of the corrinoid substrate used. It is proposed that the Fpr and FldA proteins are part of the corrinoid adenosylation pathway in S. enterica.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagentsUnless otherwise stated, all reagents including (CN)2Cbi, HOCbl, CNCbl, and AdoCbl were obtained from Sigma.Protein PurificationPurification of E. coli FprStep 1: Mass Culturing of the Overexpressing Strain and Generation of Cell-free ExtractsFpr protein was overproduced from strain JE4937 (E. coli C-1a/pEE1010, a gift from Elisabeth Haggård-Ljungquist, Stockholm University, Stockholm, Sweden) grown overnight at 37 °C on Luria Bertani broth containing 100 µg/ml of ampicillin and 30 mm glucose. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min using a Sorvall GSA rotor (DuPont Instruments, Wilmington, DE). Approximately 20 g of cells were resuspended in 50 mmTris-Cl buffer pH 7.5 at 4 °C (buffer A) containing 16 µg/ml of protein inhibitor phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. The cell suspension was broken by sonication using a Sonic Dismembrator (model 550; Fisher) for 13 min (large tip, setting of 6, 50% duty). Cell-free extracts were generated by centrifugation at 40,000 × g using a KOMP Spin rotor (model KA-21.50; Composite RotorTM, Mountain View, CA) for 1.5 h.Step 2: Anion Exchange ChromatographyCell-free extract (0.84 g of protein) was applied to a column containing DEAE 650M TSK TOYOPEARL® anion exchange resin (2.5 × 20 cm, 41.7-ml bed volume; equilibrated with buffer A; Tosohaas, Montgomeryville, PA). Twenty mg of protein was applied per ml of resin. The column was developed at a flow rate of 60 ml h−1. After the sample was applied, the column was washed with 170 ml of the buffer A, followed by a 65-ml wash with buffer A containing 1 m NaCl. Purification of the Fpr protein was monitored by SDS-PAGE.Step 3: Dye Ligand ChromatographyFractions from the previous step containing Fpr (254 mg of total protein) were applied to a Reactive Red 120 column (2.5 × 20 cm, 76-ml bed volume; Sigma) equilibrated with buffer A. Approximately 4 mg of protein was loaded per ml of resin. The column was developed at a flow rate of 79 ml h−1. After washing the column with 120 ml of buffer A, bound proteins were eluted with a 310-ml linear gradient of NaCl (0–1.0 m) in buffer A. Following the gradient, the column was washed with 240 ml of buffer A containing 1.3 m NaCl to elute tightly bound proteins. Fractions containing Fpr protein, as judged by SDS-PAGE and UV-visible spectrum of the enzyme-bound flavin, were pooled and concentrated using a Centriprep 10TMconcentrator (Millipore, Bedford, MA).Step 4: Anion Exchange FPLCPurified Fpr protein was applied to a Resource Q FPLC column (Amersha Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with buffer A at 41 mg/ml of resin. Proteins bound to this resin were eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (0–1.0 m) in buffer A. After this purification step, the Fpr protein was assessed by SDS-PAGE to be ≥98% homogeneous. Eighteen mg of homogeneous Fpr protein was obtained from the starting 20 g of cell material.Purification of E. coli FldAStep 1: Overproduction of FldA Protein and Generation of Cell-free ExtractsThe flavodoxin protein was overproduced from four 2-liter cultures of E. coli strain DH1/pDHO2 (R. G. Matthews, University of Michigan) grown on LB broth containing 100 µg/ml of ampicillin. The cells were grown at 37 °C to anA 650 of about 0.7. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside was added to a final concentration of 400 µm, and the incubation was continued overnight. After incubation, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min using a Sorvall GSA rotor (DuPont), the cells (∼25 g) were resuspended in 150 ml of 50 mm Tris-Cl buffer, pH 7.5, at 4 °C containing 16 µg of phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride/ml of extract. The cells were broken by sonication using a sonic dismembrator for 7.5 min (large tip, setting of 6, 50% duty). The cell-free extracts were generated by centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 1.5 h using a KOMP Spin rotor.Step 2: Anion Exchange Chromatography on DEAE-650MCell-free extract (∼1.5 g of protein) was applied to a column containing DEAE 650M resin (2.5 × 20 cm, 70-ml bed volume) equilibrated with buffer A. Approximately 22 mg of protein was applied per ml of resin. The column was washed with 70 ml of loading buffer followed by 140 ml of 100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0. Bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient 100–500 mm NaCl in 100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0. The pH of the fractions containing the FldA protein was brought up to 7.0 with 2 m Tris-Cl buffer, pH 8.0, at 4 °C. Fractions containing the FldA protein were pooled and dialyzed against buffer A.Step 3: Anion Exchange FPLCFractions containing dialyzed FldA protein (∼315 mg of total protein) were applied to a POROS HQ (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) anion exchange FPLC column (1.0 × 10 cm, 7-ml bed volume) equilibrated with buffer A. Forty-five mg of protein was applied per ml of resin. The column was washed with 14 ml of buffer A followed by a linear gradient of 0–1.5m NaCl in buffer A. Fractions containing FldA were pooled, dialyzed against buffer A, and stored at −90 °C in buffer A + 20% (v/v) glycerol. After this purification step, the FldA protein was assessed to be >95% homogeneous by SDS-PAGE. A total of 85 mg of FldA was obtained from 25 g of starting material.Purification of the CobA Enzyme of S. entericaPurification of the CobA enzyme was performed as described in Bauer et al.

Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2525-2537Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).In Vitro Activity AssaysCorrinoid Adenosylation AssaysPotassium borohydride-dependent CobA assays were performed as described (13Suh S.-J. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 921-925Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The assay that demanded enzymic reduction of cob(III)alamin to cob(I)alamin was a modification of the corrinoid adenosylation assay previously reported (13Suh S.-J. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 921-925Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Conversion of (HOCbl) to AdoCbl was monitored spectrophotometrically using a PerkinElmer Lambda 6 Spectrophotometer equipped with a temperature-regulated cuvette holder. The assay mixtures (final volume, 1 ml) contained HOCbl (50 nmol), NADPH (500 nmol), ATP (400 nmol), MnCl2 or MgCl2 (800 nmol), FMN (50 nmol), Tris-Cl buffer, pH 8.0, at 37 °C (200 µmol) homogeneous NAD(P)H:FMN oxidoreductase (Fre) enzyme (50 units, where 1 unit of flavin reductase activity was defined as the amount of enzyme required to reduce 1 nmol of FMN (ε450 = 12,200 m−1cm−1)/min) (20Fonseca M.V. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4304-4309Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and Fpr, FldA, and CobA proteins at various concentrations. Diacyanocob(III)inamide (CN)2Cbi) alone and (CN)2Cbi) with hydroxocob(III)inamide were used at a concentration of 20 µm when used as corrinoid substrates in place of HOCbl. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C in the spectrophotometer. In subsequent assays, the Fpr protein was used to reduce cob(III)alamin to cob(II)alamin, and thus FMN and Fre were omitted from these assays.AdoCbl formation was monitored by the increase in the absorbance of the solution at 525 nm as a function of time. The amount of product generated was calculated using the difference in molar extinction coefficient between the substrate, cob(II)alamin, and the product, AdoCbl, at 525 nm (ε525 = 4.8 × 10−3m−1 cm−1). One unit of CobA activity was defined as the amount of enzyme required to generate 1 nmol of AdoCbl/min (13Suh S.-J. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 921-925Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Cytochrome c Reductase AssaysActivity of the Fpr protein was monitored using the cytochromec reductase assay as reported by Fujii et al.(22Fujii K. Huennekens F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6745-6753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Fujii K. Galivan J.H. Huennekens F.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 178: 662-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), except the assays were performed under anoxic conditions to mimic the conditions used in the corrinoid adenosylation assays.1,2-Propanediol Dehydratase AssaysIn vitro assays for AdoCbl-dependent 1,2-propanediol dehydratase (a gift from Perry A. Frey) were performed as described (30Toraya T. Ushio K. Fukui S. Hogenkamp P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 963-970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The conversion of 1,2-propanediol to propionaldehyde was measured by derivatization of the product with 3-methyl-2-benzothiazoline hydrazone yielding an azine product that can be measured spectrophotometrically at 305 nm (ε305 = 13,300 m−1 cm−1). This assay was used as a measure of coenzymic activity of enzymically generated AdoCbl. One unit of 1,2-propanediol dehydratase is defined as the amount of enzyme required to generate 1 µmol of propionaldehyde/min under the conditions of the assay.Synthesis of Aquocobinamide (H2OCbi)H2OCbi was synthesized in vitro from (CN)2Cbi. First, AdoCbi was synthesized from (CN)2Cbi using the potassium borohydride-dependent corrinoid adenosylation assays. The assays were performed as described (13Suh S.-J. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 921-925Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), except (CN)2Cbi (50 µm) was substituted for HOCbl. After substrate conversion was complete, the reaction mixture was exposed to air and filtered through a 45-µm (25-mm diameter) syringe filter (Nalgene, Rochester, NY). The corrinoid product was isolated using a C18 SepPak cartridge (Waters, Milford, MA) and dried using a SpeedVac concentrator (Savant Instruments, Farmingdale, NY). Concentrated AdoCbi was resuspended in 400 µl of water and photolyzed aerobically using a tungsten/halogen lamp placed ∼20 cm away from the tube containing the sample. Using this procedure, AdoCbi was converted by heterolysis to H2OCbi. The sample was passed through a C18 cartridge as described above. H2OCbi was converted to (CN)2Cbi by photolysis in 0.1 mKCN, pH 10.0, using a tungsten/halogen lamp and quantitated using the molar extinction coefficient for (CN)2Cbi at 367 nm (ε367 = 30,800 m−1cm−1) (31Hogenkamp H.P.C. Babior B.M. Cobalamin: Biochemistry and Pathophysiology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1975: 21-74Google Scholar).Reverse Phase HPLC (RP-HPLC) Analysis of Reaction ProductsThe products of the corrinoid adenosylation assays were isolated and analyzed by RP-HPLC on a Prodigy ODS (8Brady R.O. Castanera E.G. Barker H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 223: 2325-2332Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) attached to an HPLC system as described (32O'Toole G.A. Rondon M.R. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3317-3326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A photodiode array detector (Waters) was used to identify corrinoids by their UV-visible spectra. Authentic HOCbl and AdoCbl were used as standards. The isolated corrinoids were desalted using a C18 SepPak cartridge and dried in a SpeedVac concentrator.Mass SpectrometryMass spectrometry of purified reaction products was performed at the Mass Spectrometry Facility at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Biotechnology Center.In Vivo Assessment of Adenosylcorrinoid SynthesisIn vitro synthesis of adenosylcorrinoids was assessedin vivo by using strain JE1096 (metE205 ara-9 cobA343::MudJ) as an indicator strain in a biological activity assays. The cells of the indicator strain grown overnight in 2 ml of nutrient broth were concentrated by centrifugation and washed with 14.5 mm sterile saline; 0.1 ml of the cell suspension (∼108 cells) was added to 3 ml of molten soft agar (0.7% w/v) and used to overlay a plate of Vogel-Bonner minimal medium (33Vogel H.J. Bonner D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 218: 97-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) containing glucose (11 mm) as carbon and energy source. The corrinoid standards AdoCbi, (CN)2Cbi, and Cbl (∼50 pmol each) and reaction products were spotted onto the overlay and incubated overnight at 37 °C.DISCUSSIONThe data reported herein show that the reducing system comprised of the Fpr and FldA proteins is sufficient for the generation of the co(I)rrinoid substrate of the ATP:co(I)rrinoid adenosyltransferase CobA enzyme of S. enterica. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a reducing system that can be coupled to the CobA enzyme for the generation of adenosylated corrinoids.The involvement of the FldA protein in the corrinoid adenosylation reaction is consistent with the ability of this protein to work at low redox potentials as a one-electron carrier (21Hoover D.M.

The validity of the conclusions drawn from this work is not affected by the use of E. coli FldA and Fpr proteins given the high degree of identity shared by the proteins in these bacteria (Fig.8), strongly suggesting that these proteins perform equivalent functions in these procaryotes. Thus it is reasonable to think that reduced FldA might represent a natural reducing system for corrinoid adenosylation in enterobacteria (e.g. E. coli and S. enterica).Figure 8Amino acid sequence alignments of theE. coli and S. enterica Fpr and FldA proteins. Sequence alignments were performed using the CLUSTAL W program (43Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55150) Google Scholar).

Preliminary sequence information for S. enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2 was obtained from the Genome Sequencing Center (Washington University, St. Louis, MO) data base (Genome Sequencing Center, http://genome.wustl.edu/gsc/Blast/client.pl).

Harder S.R. Ragsdale S.W. Matthews R.G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1129-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and the extreme reactivity of the cob(I)alamin nucleophile (39Schrauzer G.N. Deutsch E. Windgassen R.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1968; 90: 2441-2442Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) strongly suggest that reduction of cob(II)alamin occurs on the CobA enzyme. It is unlikely that cob(II)alamin reduction occurs in solution because the midpoint redox potentials for the semiquinone and hydroquinone forms of free FldA (−260 and −440 mV, respectively) (21Hoover D.M. Jarrett J.T. Sands R.H. Dunham W.R. Ludwig M.L. Matthews R.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) are too high to account for the generation of the cob(I)alamin nucleophile via a second order reaction. The redox potential for this reaction is expected to be close to the redox potential for free cob(II)alamin and thus considerably lower than that of the cob(II)alamin form of free methionine synthase (21Hoover D.M. Jarrett J.T. Sands R.H. Dunham W.R. Ludwig M.L. Matthews R.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 38Banerjee R.V. Harder S.R. Ragsdale S.W. Matthews R.G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1129-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In addition, the lower axial ligand of HOCbl has been shown to be coordinated to the cobalt in the CobA crystal structure (Fig. 8) (14Bauer C.B. Fonseca M.V. Holden H.M. Thoden J.B. Thompson T.B. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 361-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Generation of the cob(I)alamin substrate for CobA ligand would require lower ligand dissociation from the cobalt ion. This reaction is known to raise the redox potential of the cob(II)alamin/cob(I)alamin couple (21Hoover D.M. Jarrett J.T. Sands R.H. Dunham W.R. Ludwig M.L. Matthews R.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 40Lexa D. Saveant J.-M. Acc. Chem. Res. 1983; 16: 235-243Crossref Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Interactions between FldA and CobA coupled to product formation are therefore expected to raise the redox potential to facilitate the reaction. The documented mechanisms for MetH reactivation as well as the FldA-dependent anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase activation reaction support this hypothesis (24Jarrett J.T. Hoover D.M. Ludwig M.L. Matthews R.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12649-12658Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 41Mulliez E. Padovani D. Atta M. Alcouffe C. Fontecave M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3730-3736Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Interactions between the FldA and CobA proteins are an attractive possibility, when one also considers the location of the corrinoid-binding site in CobA (14Bauer C.B. Fonseca M.V. Holden H.M. Thoden J.B. Thompson T.B. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 361-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The ternary complex structure between HOCbl, ATP, and CobA show that the corrinoid binding site is located near the surface of the enzyme (Fig. 9). The interactions between FldA and CobA and/or the reduction of the corrinoid may be responsible for the hypothesized conformational changes CobA must undergo to bring the target C5′ of the ribose close"
https://openalex.org/W2064261433,"E-selectin is an endothelial adhesion molecule, which mediates the tethering and rolling of leukocytes on vascular endothelium. It recognizes the glycoprotein E-selectin ligand-1 (ESL-1) as a major binding partner on mouse myeloid cells. Using surface plasmon resonance, we measured the kinetics and affinity of binding of monomeric E-selectin to ESL-1 isolated from mouse bone marrow cells. E-selectin bound to ESL-1 with a fast dissociation rate constant of 4.6 s(-1) and a calculated association rate constant of 7.4 x 10(4) m(-1) s(-1). We determined a dissociation constant (K(d)) of 62 microm, which resembles the affinity of L-selectin binding to glycosylation-dependent cell adhesion molecule-1. The affinity of the E-selectin-ESL-1 interaction did not change significantly when the temperature was varied from 5 degrees C to 37 degrees C, indicating that the enthalpic contribution to the binding is small at physiological temperatures, and that, in contrast to typical protein-carbohydrate interactions, binding is driven primarily by favorable entropic changes. Interestingly, surface plasmon resonance experiments with recombinant ESL-1 from alpha 1,3-fucosyltransferase IV-expressing Chinese hamster ovary cells showed a very similar K(d) of 66 microm, suggesting that this fucosyltransferase is sufficient to produce fully functional recombinant ESL-1. Following the recent description of the affinity and kinetics of the selectin-ligand pairs L-selectin-glycosylation-dependent cell adhesion molecule-1 and P-selectin-P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1, this is the first determination of the parameters of E-selectin binding to one of its naturally occurring ligands."
https://openalex.org/W2040524950,"The host response to infection is associated with several alterations in lipid metabolism that promote lipoprotein production. These changes can be reproduced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration. LPS stimulates hepatic cholesterol synthesis and suppresses the conversion of cholesterol to bile acids. LPS down-regulates hepatic cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the classic pathway of bile acid synthesis. We now demonstrate that LPS markedly decreases the activity of sterol 27-hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the alternate pathway of bile acid synthesis, in the liver of Syrian hamsters. Moreover, LPS progressively decreases hepatic sterol 27-hydroxylase mRNA levels by 75% compared with controls over a 24-h treatment period. LPS also decreases oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase mRNA levels in mouse liver.In vitro studies in HepG2 cells demonstrate that tumor necrosis factor and interleukin (IL)-1 decrease sterol 27-hydroxylase mRNA levels by 48 and 80%, respectively, whereas IL-6 has no such effect. The IL-1-induced decrease in sterol 27-hydroxylase mRNA expression occurs early, is sustained for 48 h, and requires very low doses. In vivo IL-1 treatment also lowers hepatic sterol 27-hydroxylase mRNA levels in Syrian hamsters. Studies investigating the molecular mechanisms of LPS-induced decrease in sterol 27-hydroxylase show that LPS markedly decreases mRNA and protein levels of hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 (HNF-1), a transcription factor that regulates sterol 27-hydroxylase, in the liver. Moreover, LPS decreases the binding activity of HNF-1 by 70% in nuclear extracts in hamster liver, suggesting that LPS may down-regulate sterol 27-hydroxylase by decreasing the binding of HNF-1 to its promoter. Coupled with our earlier studies on cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase, these data indicate that LPS suppresses both the classic and alternate pathways of bile acid synthesis. A decrease in bile acid synthesis in liver would reduce cholesterol catabolism and thereby contribute to the increase in hepatic lipoprotein production that is induced by LPS and cytokines.

Lipidol. 1994; 5: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Low doses of LPS rapidly increase hepatic triglyceride synthesis and VLDL production, whereas high doses of LPS inhibit triglyceride clearance by decreasing lipoprotein lipase activity in heart, muscle, and adipose tissue and in post-heparin plasma (5Feingold K.R. Staprans I. Memon R.A. Moser A.H. Shigenaga J.K. Doerrler W. Dinarello C.A. Grunfeld C. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1765-1776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In rodents, LPS treatment increases serum cholesterol levels; however, this effect is delayed in onset and is primarily accounted for by an increase in LDL cholesterol (6Feingold K.R. Hardardottir I.

An increase in hepatic cholesterol synthesis and VLDL production could contribute to an increase in serum LDL levels in rodents. Bile acids are formed in the liver from cholesterol, and their synthesis represents the major pathway for the elimination of cholesterol from the body (10Javitt N.B. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1308-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). An increase in bile acid synthesis can lead to a decrease in plasma cholesterol levels. Recent studies have shown that there are two distinct pathways of bile acid synthesis in mammalian liver (reviewed in Ref. 11Vlahcevic Z.R. Pandak W.M. Stravitz R.T. Gastroenterol. Clin. North. Am. 1999; 28: 1-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The classic or neutral pathway is initiated by microsomal cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (also known as CYP7A) that converts cholesterol into 7α-hydroxycholesterol, which is subsequently converted into primary bile acids (12Jelinek D.F. Andersson S. Slaughter C.A. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8190-8197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The alternate or acidic pathway is initiated by mitochondrial sterol 27-hydroxylase (also known as CYP27A) that converts cholesterol into 27-hydroxycholesterol (13Cali J.J. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7774-7778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is then converted into 7α,27-dihydroxycholesterol by oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase (also known as CYP7B) and subsequently metabolized into primary bile acids. Although the regulation of microsomal cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase has been extensively studied under physiological and pathological conditions (11Vlahcevic Z.R. Pandak W.M. Stravitz R.T.

Diets supplemented with 5% cholestyramine increase and hydrophobic bile acids decrease the activity, mRNA levels, and transcription of sterol 27-hydroxylase (15Vlahcevic Z.R. Jairath S.K. Heuman D.M.

Recent in vivo and in vitro studies suggest that alternate pathway may contribute as much as 50% to the total bile acid synthesis (16Vlahcevic Z.R. Stravitz R.T. Heuman D.M. Hylemon P.B. Pandak W.M.

Because bile acid synthesis is the major pathway for elimination of cholesterol from the body, a decrease in bile acid synthesis would increase the availability of cholesterol for lipoprotein production. We have previously shown that LPS and cytokines decrease the activity and mRNA expression of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase in the liver of Syrian hamsters (18Feingold K.R. Spady D.K. Pollock A.S. Moser A.H. Grunfeld C. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 223-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This study was designed to determine the effect of LPS and cytokine treatment on the activity and mRNA expression of sterol 27-hydroxylase in the liver of Syrian hamsters and in HepG2 cells, a human hepatoma cell line. We also studied the effect of LPS on oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase mRNA levels in the liver. Finally, we have examined the effect of LPS on the mRNA expression, protein levels, and binding activity of HNF-1, a transcription factor that has been shown to regulate sterol 27-hydroxylase, in the liver of Syrian hamsters. [α-32P]dCTP (3,000 Ci/mmol) and [4-14C]cholesterol (51 mCi/mol) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. LPS (Escherichia coli 55:B5) was purchased from Difco Laboratories (Detroit, MI).

Male Syrian hamsters (∼140–160 g) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). The animals were maintained in a reverse light cycle room (3 a.m. to 3 p.m. dark, 3 p.m. to 3 a.m. light) and were provided with rodent chow and water ad libitum. Anesthesia was induced with halothane, and the animals were injected intraperitoneally with either LPS (at the indicated doses in 0.5 ml of 0.9% saline) or saline alone. Subsequently food was withdrawn from both control and treated animals because LPS induces anorexia (21Grunfeld C. Zhao C. Fuller J. Pollock A.S. Moser A.H. Friedman J. Feingold K.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2152-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). The animals were killed between 4 and 24 h after LPS administration as indicated in the text. The doses of LPS used (1–100 µg/100 g of body weight (BW)) have significant effects on triglyceride and cholesterol metabolism in Syrian hamsters (5Feingold K.R. Staprans I. Memon R.A. Moser A.H.

In a separate experiment, animals were injected with IL-1 (1 µg/100 g of BW) or saline, and 16 h later the livers were obtained for RNA isolation. Female C57Bl/6 mice (20 g) were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). The animals were maintained on a normal 12-h light cycle and were fed mouse chow (Ralston-Purina, St. Louis, MO) and waterad libitum. The animals were injected with LPS (0.1–100 µg/kg of BW, intraperitoneally) or saline, and the food was withdrawn from both groups. Sixteen hours after the treatment, the animals were sacrificed, and the livers were obtained for measuring sterol 27-hydroxylase and oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase mRNA levels. The activity of mitochondrial sterol 27-hydroxylase in the liver was measured as described by Souidi et al. (22Souidi M. Parquet M. Ferezou J. Lutton C. Life Sci. 1999; 64: 1585-1593Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Briefly, the livers were homogenized, and the mitochondria were isolated by differential centrifugation. The reaction mixture for the sterol 27-hydroxylase assay contained 75 mm KH2PO4 buffer (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm NADPH, [14C]cholesterol (1.1 × 106 dpm, 26,000 pmol, 52 µm), 4.5 mg of hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin, 5 mm sodium isocitrate, 0.2 unit of isocitrate dehydrogenase, and 250–300 µg of mitochondrial protein. The reaction was started with the addition of NADPH and terminated 6 min later by adding 40 µl of 5 n NaOH. After neutralization, the sterols were extracted with 4.3 ml of dichloromethane:ethanol (5:1 v/v) plus 1.2 ml of H2O. Unlabeled 27-hydroxycholesterol (75 µg) was added and separated from cholesterol by TLC on Silica gel G plates using ethyl acetate:hexane (1:1, v/v) as a solvent. The bands were identified and counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Control reactions containing no protein were run in parallel to correct for the background. Sterol 27-hydroxylase activity is expressed as picomoles of 27-hydroxycholesterol formed per mg protein per min. The protein was assayed by the method of Bradford (Bio-Rad). Total RNA was isolated by a variation of the guanidinium thiocyanate method (23Chomezynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar) as described earlier (6Feingold K.R. Hardardottir I. Memon R.A. Krul E.J.T. Moser A.H. Taylor J.M. Grunfeld C. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 2147-2158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA from liver was isolated using oligo(dT) cellulose and quantified by measuring absorption at 260 nm. Gel electrophoresis, transfer, and Northern blotting were performed as described earlier (6Feingold K.R. Hardardottir I. Memon R.A. Krul E.J.T. Moser A.H. Taylor J.M. Grunfeld C. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 2147-2158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The uniformity of sample applications was checked by ultraviolet visualization of the acridine orange-stained gels before transfer to Nytran membranes. The cDNA probe hybridization was performed as described previously (6Feingold K.R. Hardardottir I. Memon R.A. Krul E.J.T. Moser A.H. Taylor J.M. Grunfeld C. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 2147-2158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The blots were exposed to x-ray films for various durations to ensure that measurements were done on the linear portion of the curve, and the bands were quantified by densitometry. The blots were also probed with cyclophilin as a housekeeping gene, and the densitometric values were normalized relative to cyclophilin. Nuclear extracts for Western blots and electrophoretic gel mobility shift assays were prepared as described previously (24Beigneux A.P. Moser A.H. Shigenaga J.K. Grunfeld C. Feingold K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16390-16399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Briefly, fresh livers (1.5–2 g), obtained after LPS or saline treatment, were homogenized in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 25 mm KCl, 0.15 mm spermine, 1 mm EDTA, 2 msucrose, 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaF, 2 mm sodium metavanadate, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 1% protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Immediately following homogenization, the nuclear proteins were extracted as described by Neish et al.(25Neish A.S. Khachigian L.M. Park A. Baichwal V.R. Collins T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28903-28909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), except that 1 mm NaF, 0.1 mm sodium metavanadate, and 1% protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) were added to all buffers. The nuclear protein content was determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Denatured nuclear protein (20 µg) was loaded onto 10% polyacrylamide precast gels (Bio-Rad) and subjected to electrophoresis. After electrotransfer onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), the blots were blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.10% Tween and 5% dry milk for 1 h at room temperature and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a polyclonal anti-HNF-1α antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a dilution of 1:10,000. Immune complexes were detected using horseradish peroxidase-linked donkey anti-goat IgG (dilution, 1:10,000) according to the ECL Plus Western blotting kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunoreactive bands obtained by autoradiography were quantified by densitometry. Electrophoretic gel mobility shift assays were performed as described earlier (24Beigneux A.P. Moser A.H. Shigenaga J.K. Grunfeld C. Feingold K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16390-16399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 µg of crude nuclear extract were incubated on ice for 30 min with 6 × 104 cpm of 32P-labeled oligonucleotides in 15 µl of binding buffer and 6 µg of poly(dI-dC). Double-stranded oligonucleotide probes were end-labeled with T4-polynucleotide kinase in the presence of 10 µCi of [γ-32P]dATP and purified on a Sephadex G-25 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). DNA-protein complexes were separated by electrophoresis, and the gel was dried, exposed to x-ray film, and quantified by densitometry (24Beigneux A.P. Moser A.H. Shigenaga J.K. Grunfeld C.

In the competition assay, a 100-fold molar excess of specific or mutated unlabeled oligonucleotide was incubated on ice for 1 h with 10 µg of crude nuclear extract from a control hamster in the binding buffer before adding the labeled oligonucleotide probe. The oligonucleotide sequence used in this study was derived from the rat albumin promoter (26Metz R.P. Auyeung D.J. Kessler F.K. Ritter J.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and was as follows: HNF-1 response element, 5′-GGTAAGTATGGTTAATGATCTACAGTTA-3′; mutant HNF-1 response element, 5′-GGTAAGTATGAGCGATGATCTACAGTTA-3′. In supershift studies, control nuclear extracts were preincubated with 1 µl of one of the following antibodies for 1 h at room temperature prior to the addition of labeled probe: anti-HNF-1α, anti-HNF-1β, and control goat IgG. HepG2 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and maintained in minimum essential medium (Mediatech, Inc., Herdon, VA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum under standard culture conditions (5% CO2, 37 °C). The cells were seeded into 100-mm culture dishes and allowed to grow to 80% confluence. Immediately prior to the experiment, the cells were washed with calcium-magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline, and the experimental medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 0.1% bovine serum albumin) containing TNF, IL-1, or IL-6 (at concentrations indicated in figure legends) was added. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times. RNA isolation and Northern blotting were performed according to methods described previously (6Feingold K.R. Hardardottir I. Memon R.A. Krul E.J.T. Moser A.H. Taylor J.M. Grunfeld C. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 2147-2158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results are expressed as the means ± S.E. Statistical significance between two groups was determined by using the Student's t test. Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that LPS markedly decreases cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase activity and mRNA levels in the liver of Syrian hamsters (18Feingold K.R. Spady D.K. Pollock A.S. Moser A.H. Grunfeld C. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 223-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we first examined the effect of LPS (100 µg/100 g of BW) on sterol 27-hydroxylase activity in the liver of Syrian hamsters. The data presented in Fig.1 demonstrate that 24-h LPS treatment produced a 63% decrease in mitochondrial sterol 27-hydroxylase activity in the liver. To investigate the mechanism for LPS-induced decrease in sterol 27-hydroxylase activity, we next examined the effect of LPS on sterol 27-hydroxylase mRNA levels in the hamster liver. As shown in Fig.2 A, LPS significantly decreased hepatic sterol 27-hydroxylase mRNA levels. A modest decrease (35%) was first observed at 8 h after LPS administration, and a 75% decrease was seen after 24 h of LPS treatment. A dose-response experiment was therefore performed 24 h after LPS administration. Moderate doses of LPS were required to decrease hepatic sterol 27-hydroxylase mRNA levels, with a half-maximal response seen at less than 10 µg/100 g of BW (Fig.2 B). These data suggest that LPS decreases sterol 27-hydroxylase activity by inhibiting its mRNA expression. We also examined the effect of LPS treatment on oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase, an enzyme that is unique to the alternative pathway of bile acid synthesis (11Vlahcevic Z.R. Pandak W.M. Stravitz R.T. Gastroenterol. Clin. North. Am. 1999; 28: 1-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Both mouse (19Schwarz M. Lund E.G. Lathe R. Bjorkhem I. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23995-24001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and human (27Wu Z. Martin K.O. Javitt N.B. Chiang J.Y. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 2195-2203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase have recently been cloned. These studies demonstrate a marked size difference between human and mouse oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase mRNA transcripts (9 kilobases in human and 2.5 kilobases in mouse). Our initial studies showed that the murine cDNA for oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase did not cross-react with oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase mRNA in hamster liver. Hence, we switched species and examined the effect of 16-h LPS treatment on both oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase and sterol 27-hydroxylase in mouse liver. The data presented in Fig. 3 show that, as seen in hamsters, LPS markedly decreased sterol 27-hydroxylase mRNA levels in mouse liver. This effect of LPS was very sensitive, and doses as low as 0.1 µg/mouse produced a 58% decrease in sterol 27-hydroxylase mRNA expression in mouse liver; a maximum decrease of 83% was seen at a dose of 1 µg/mouse. On the other hand, higher doses of LPS (10 µg/mouse) were required to produce a 50% decrease in oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase mRNA expression in mouse liver (Fig.3). Because pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF, IL-1, and IL-6 mediate many of the metabolic alterations that occur during the host response to infection and inflammation (4Hardardottir I. Grunfeld C. Feingold K.R. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1994; 5: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), it is possible that these cytokines could directly regulate sterol 27-hydroxylase. To address this question, we examined the effect of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in HepG2 cells, a human hepatoma cell line. TNF-α and IL-1β decreased sterol 27-hydroxylase mRNA by 48 and 80%, respectively, in HepG2 cells, whereas IL-6 had no such effect (Fig. 4). We were unable to detect oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase mRNA expression in HepG2 cells using the murine oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase cDNA probe. Because IL-1β was most effective in decreasing sterol 27-hydroxylase mRNA levels in HepG2 cells, we performed additional studies on the effect of IL-1β in HepG2 cells. The data presented in Fig. 5 A show that IL-1β induces a marked decrease in sterol 27-hydroxylase mRNA levels by 8 h, and the effect is sustained for at least 48 h. Furthermore, the dose-response studies demonstrate that the maximal decrease in sterol 27-hydroxylase mRNA levels is observed at 1 ng/ml IL-1β, and the half-maximal response occurs at less than 0.1 ng/ml (Fig. 5 B), suggesting that the decrease in sterol 27-hydroxylase mRNA levels in HepG2 cells is a very sensitive response to IL-1β.Figure 5Time course (A) and dose response (B) for the effect of IL-1 on sterol 27-hydroxylase mRNA in HepG2 cells. HepG2 cells were incubated with 100 ng/ml IL-1 at the indicated times (A) or with the indicated concentrations of IL-1 (B) for 24 h. At the end of the incubations, poly(A)+ RNA was isolated, and Northern blots were probed with sterol 27-hydroxylase cDNA as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The data are presented as the percentages of control values as quantified by densitometry (mean ± S.E.), n = 4 for all groups.A, *, p < 0.002; **, p < 0.001. B, *, p < 0.001.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We also examined the in vivo effect of IL-1 on sterol 27-hydroxylase mRNA levels in the liver of Syrian hamsters. The data presented in Fig. 6 show that 16-h IL-1 treatment (1 µg/100 g of BW) produced a 50% decrease in sterol 27-hydroxylase mRNA levels in the liver. Taken together, these data suggest that sterol 27-hydroxylase is down-regulated during the acute phase response, and IL-1 is capable of mediating this metabolic response in vivo. To investigate the molecular mechanism involved in the down-regulation of sterol 27-hydroxylase mRNA levels, we examined the effect of LPS on HNF-1 in vivo. A recent study reported that bile acids suppress sterol 27-hydroxylase transcription by decreasing the binding of HNF-1 to sterol 27-hydroxylase promoter (28Rao Y.P. Vlahcevic Z.R. Stravitz R.T. Mallonee D.H. Mullick J. Avadhani N.G. Hylemon P.B. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 70: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The effect of 16-h LPS treatment on the binding of nuclear proteins to the HNF-1 response element is presented in Fig.7 A. Densitometric analysis of the data shows that LPS decreased the binding to the HNF-1 response element by 70% in nuclear extracts in the hamster liver. Competition with a 100-fold molar excess of specific oligonucleotide, but not of mutated oligonucleotide, demonstrates the specificity of binding. In addition, the band was supershifted after incubation of control nuclear extracts with anti-HNF-1α antibody, but not with anti-HNF-1β or nonspecific IgG (Fig. 7 B), suggesting that the shifted bands in Fig. 7 A are due to HNF-1α in the nuclear extracts. These results indicate that LPS specifically decreases the binding activity to the HNF-1 response element in the hamster"

Similar γ-secretase processing occurs in another transmembrane protein, Notch1, releasing a potent signaling molecule, the Notch C-terminal domain. It has been shown that both events are dependent on a presenilin-dependent protease. We now test the hypothesis that activated Notch1 and APP are competitive substrates for the same proteolytic activity in neurons. Treatment of neurons with the native Notch ligand, Delta, induces endogenous Notch1 intramembraneous cleavage and diminishes Aβ production in a dose-dependent manner. Complementary experiments showed that the converse was also true. Overexpressing human APP (APP695Sw) in neurons leads to a decrease in endogenous Notch1 signal transduction, as assessed by a CBF1 luciferase transcription assay, by Notch C-terminal domain nuclear translocation in vitro and by analysis of Notch C-terminal domain generation and Notch1 staining in vivo.

Cleavage by β-secretase produces a secreted N-terminal APPβ (sAPPβ) protein and a C-terminal C99 fragment, which can be cleaved by γ-secretase to produce the 40–42 amino acid Aβ. It has been suggested that a presenilin1 (PS1)-associated enzymatic activity is responsible for the intramembraneous γ-secretase cleavage of APP (4Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Thekla S.D.

These data suggest that a similar PS1-dependent enzymatic activity is involved in intramembraneous processing of both APP and Notch1. In the present study we explore the possibility that APP and activated Notch1 compete for γ-secretase activity. We hypothesize that if both APP and Notch1 are processed by the same protease, then activated Notch1 may compete with APP for γ-secretase cleavage with a consequent decrease in Aβ production. Conversely, we predict that conditions that lead to elevated Aβ production (such as APP695Sw overexpression) will decrease Notch1 signaling. To test these predictions, we activated endogenous Notch1 by treatment of APP695Sw-overexpressing neurons with the soluble Notch1 ligand Dl-Fc and showed that the level of Aβ in the conditioned medium was substantially decreased in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, we assessed the activity of the Notch1 signaling pathway in APP695Sw-overexpressing neurons by counting neurons with nuclear Notch1 staining and by measuring the transactivation of a Notch1 target gene, a CBF1 luciferase reporter. We found that both measures of Notch1 activation were significantly diminished in comparison to that observed in non-APP-overexpressing neurons prepared from control non-transgenic littermates. Finally, we examined Notch1 cellular localization in the hippocampal formation of adult APP695Sw-overexpressing mice and found a statistically significant decrease in nuclear localization of Notch1, suggesting that Notch1 activation is less efficient in the presence of increased APP expression in vivo. Taken together, these data support the idea that Aβ generation and Notch1 activation are competing biological processes. Primary neuronal cultures from mutant human APP695Sw-overexpressing transgenic mice, Tg 2576, (30Hsiao K. Chapman P. Nilsen S. Eckman C. Harigaya Y. Younkin S. Yang F. Cole G. Science. 1996; 274: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (3695) Google Scholar) were prepared as described previously (31Berezovska O. Frosch M. McLean P. Knowles R. Koo E. Kang D. Shen J. Lu F.M. Lux S.E.

The neurons from individual embryos (E16-18, 106 cells/ml) were cultured separately, and tails of the embryos were dissected for genotyping to identify cultures from Tg (expressing human mutant APP) or non-Tg embryos. At 2–6 days in vitro (DIV), prior to treatment with Dl-Fc or control medium, the growth medium in the neuronal cultures was replaced with fresh medium and Dl-Fc or control medium were applied on a daily basis for 2 days. The CBF1-luciferase assay was performed as described previously (11Berezovska O. Jack C. McLean P. Aster J.C. Hicks C. Xia W. Wolfe M.S. Kimberly W.T. Weinmaster G. Selkoe D.J. Hyman B.T. J.

The assay was performed in triplicate using an LKB 1251 Luminometer. Conditioned medium containing a secreted form of the Notch ligand Delta, Dl-Fc, was collected from cells growing in hygromycin B-free medium for 2 days prior to collection (34Wang S.

Collected CM was concentrated 4–5-fold, incubated with an anti-Fc antibody to precluster Dl-Fc (11Berezovska O. Jack C. McLean P. Aster J.C. Hicks C. Xia W. Wolfe M.S. Kimberly W.T. Weinmaster G. Selkoe D.J. Hyman B.T. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 583-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and applied to primary neurons. CM from 293T cells, which do not secrete Dl-Fc, served as a negative control and was prepared in a similar way as Dl-Fc CM. 20, 40, or 60 µl of CM (Dl-Fc or control) were applied to the primary neurons growing in 200 µl of the growth medium daily. 24 h after the last treatment with Dl-Fc/control CM, the total volume of neuronal conditioned medium was adjusted with fresh growth medium to an equal amount in all treated groups. The CM was collected for ELISA (Aβ) or Western blots (secreted APP, sAPP), and the cells were lysed to measure the total level of APP expression as well as the amounts of C-terminal (C83 and C99) APP fragments. Cell lysates and CM were adjusted to equal protein concentrations for the analyses. For Aβ ELISA we used 25 µl of tissue culture-conditioned medium. The capture antibody was 22C4, (to the C terminus of Aβ), and the detection antibody was biotinylated 6E10 (to Aβ residues 1–17) (35Nitsch R.M. Deng A. Tennis M. Schoenfeld D. Growdon J. Ann. Neurol. 2000; 48: 913-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). For the Western blot analysis, the CM was electrophoresed on 10–20% Tricine gel for Aβ analysis or on 4–20% Tris-Glycine gel for sAPP. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the cell extracts was carried out on 4–20% Tris-glycine gel for total APP expression and for C-terminal fragments of APP (C83 and C99). The cells (brains) were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm TRIS, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 1% Nonidet P-40. The immunoblotting was performed with the following anti-APP antibodies (C-terminal 13G8 and C8 (to residues 676–695), N-terminal 8E5 (to residues 444–592), Aβ-specific 6E10, and β cut-specific 192sw (36Citron M.

An anti-biotin antibody was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Germany. TC was a polyclonal antibody against the C terminus of Notch1 (TC, courtesy of J. Aster, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, Ref. 39Aster J. Robertson E. Hasserjian R. Turner J. Kieff E. Sklar J. J. Biol.

To label cell surface molecules, growing primary neurons (treated with either control or Dl-Fc-containing conditioned medium) were incubated with EZ-Link Biotin (EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin, Pierce) for 45 min at 4 °C. The cells were lysed, biotinylated cell surface proteins were immunoprecipitated with an anti-biotin antibody, electrophoresed on a Tris-glycine gel, probed with 8E5, and developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Quantitative analysis was performed using Molecular Analyst Software on a Bio-Rad Densitometer. Primary neuronal cultures were obtained from individual embryos of heterozygote Tg 2576 mice; genotyping subsequently identified cultures from transgene-positive or transgene-negative embryos. Neurons at 2–6 DIV were treated with control CM or CM containing preclustered Notch1 ligand Dl-Fc for 24 h, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100, and blocked with 1.5% normal goat serum for 1 h. Cells were incubated with Notch1-specific TC antibody and a neuron-specific monoclonal MAP2 antibody (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C. Fluorochrome-linked secondary antibodies (CY3 anti-rabbit and fluorescein anti-mouse (Jackson)) were applied for 1 h at room temperature. Cultures were washed with Tris-buffered saline, counterstained with Hoescht 33342 (Molecular Probes) for 5 min at room temperature to visualize nuclei, and coverslipped using GVA mounting solution (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). The images of all neurons (confirmed by MAP2 staining) immunostained with anti-Notch1 antibody in 5–6 random visual fields per well were collected using × 40 objective (zoom 2) on a confocal microscope (Bio-Rad 1024) mounted on a Nikon Eclipse TE300 inverted microscope. Four wells per condition were examined in each experiment, and data were collected from two independent experiments. The percent of neurons containing nuclear Notch1 staining was recorded by an observer unaware of transgene status of the culture and was then calculated for APP695Sw-overexpressing and non-transgenic littermate control cultures. A total of 500 neurons were quantified. The sections of five-month-old Tg 2576 and control non-Tg mouse brains were immunostained with Notch1 antibody (TC) and counterstained with DAPI to localize the nuclei of the neurons. The location of the nucleus was identified in the DAPI channel, then a “mask” was applied to the Notch1 channel and the intensity of fluorescence within the nucleus was measured using a computerized image analysis system (Bioquant, Nashville, TN). The location of neurons within the CA1 field of the hippocampus to be measured was chosen using a systematic random sampling scheme analogous to those used in stereology; ∼2,000 neurons were examined using a × 100 water immersion objective. The ratio of Notch1 nuclear fluorescence to total Notch1 fluorescence in the CA1 field was compared in three Tg2576 and three non-Tg control littermate mice using Student's t test analysis. To test the hypothesis that APP competes with Notch1 for γ-secretase processing, we activated endogenous Notch1 signaling in primary neurons by treatment with different concentrations of the Notch ligand, Dl-Fc, for 2 days and measured the amount of Aβ in conditioned medium. Treatment with Dl-Fc, but not control CM, appeared to cause a significant dose-dependent decrease in total Aβ, as assessed by Western blot analysis (Fig.1 A). To confirm this observation, we used a sensitive and specific sandwich ELISA to quantitate total Aβ. We found consistent, correlative decreases of total Aβ after treatment with Dl-Fc in a dose-dependent manner, with the highest dose leading to a decrease of about 45% (p < 0.001) in Aβ production (Fig. 1 B). Results are representative of nine independent experiments, each performed at least in duplicate. We next examined whether the decrease in Aβ secretion after Notch1 activation with Dl-Fc was due to any effects of this treatment on APP expression, metabolism or trafficking. We performed Western blot analysis of cell lysates (for APP expression and γ-secretase cleavage) and conditioned medium (for secreted APPα and APPβ). Three different antibodies to APP were used to analyze the level of APP expression: C-terminal 13G8, N-terminal 8E5, and Aβ-specific 6E10 antibodies. There was no change in the level of total APP expression in Dl-Fc treated neurons, in comparison to that in cells treated with control medium. The result was replicated in four independent experiments (Fig. 2 A). We also analyzed whether treatment with Dl-Fc alters trafficking of APP molecules to the cell surface. To label cell surface proteins we biotinylated the surface molecules of the primary neurons with EZ-Link Biotin. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-biotin antibody, and immunoblotted with 8E5 to detect cell surface APP. There was no difference in the amount of biotinylated APP in Dl-Fc-treated neurons in comparison to that in control CM-treated cells (Fig.2 E). We also measured the amount of secreted APP in the conditioned medium. The level of sAPP (total, β-, or α-sAPP) was not different in neurons treated with Dl-Fc or control CM (Fig. 2,B and C). This demonstrates that the activity of α- and β- secretases was not changed due to activation of Notch1 with its ligand Delta. The amount of APP C-terminal fragments (CTF) also was not significantly different between Delta and control medium-treated cells (Fig. 2 D). This observation was reproduced in five independent experiments. The discordance between Aβ production and APP CTF generation in this system is in agreement with observations on APP processing after manipulation of nicastrin (40Yu G. Nishimura M. Arawaka S. Levitan D. Zhang L. Tandon A. Song Y.Q. Rogaeva E. Chen F. Kawarai T. Supala A. Levesque L., Yu, H. Yang D.S. Holmes E. Milman P. Liang Y. Zhang D.M. Xu D.H. Sato C. Rogaev E. Smith M. Janus C.

(2000) Society for Neuroscience Meeting, New Orleans, Abstr. 474.11..Google Scholar). Thus, the major effect of Notch1 activation on APP was reduced Aβ generation. This result suggests that activation of Notch1, which leads to γ-secretase-mediated cleavage of its C terminus, effectively decreases γ-secretase action on APP. We next performed the converse experiment. We reasoned that if γ-secretase activity is a limiting step, overexpression of APP might inhibit the efficiency of ligand-induced Notch1 cleavage/nuclear translocation/signal transduction by competing with Notch1 for the γ-secretase activity. Thus, we compared the amount of endogenous Notch signaling in response to its physiological ligand, Delta, in primary neuronal cultures derived from APP695Sw-overexpressing mice and non-transgenic littermate controls. Neurons in which Notch1 is activated show a predominantly nuclear pattern of staining reflecting translocation of the C-terminal proteolytic product, NICD, to the nucleus ((21); Fig. 3,A and B). The percent of neurons with nuclear-activated Notch1 was reduced by more than 50% (p < 0.001) in neurons from APP695Swtransgenic mice compared with that in neurons from non-transgenic littermates (Fig. 3 C). Interestingly, the total level of Notch1 immunoreactivity in APP695Sw-overexpressing neurons was slightly higher than that in normal control littermates, perhaps reflecting diminished processing (Fig. 3, A andB). To confirm that Notch1 signaling was indeed down-regulated in APP-overexpressing neurons we also measured activation of a Notch1 downstream transcription factor, CBF1, in the neuronal cultures. We co-transfected neurons prepared from control and APP-overexpressing transgenic mice with a CBF1 luciferase reporter construct (33Hsieh J.J. Henkel T. Salmon P. Robey E. Peterson M.G. Hayward S.D. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 952-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) and β-galactosidase, an internal control for transfection efficiency, and measured luminescence caused by Dl-Fc treatment 24 h post-transfection. There was a 50% reduction (p < 0.001) in CBF1 luciferase activity in neurons prepared from transgenic embryos overexpressing APP695Sw in comparison to that in control, non-transgenic neurons (Fig. 3 D). To test the plausibility of the hypothesis that APP and Notch1 compete in the brain, we performed double-immunofluorescent staining of the brain sections with anti-APP (8E5) and anti-Notch1 (TC) antibodies. As expected from studies of each of these proteins individually, there was substantial co-localization of Notch1 and APP in neuronal cells. To test whether evidence for competition between APP and Notch1 for γ-secretase can be detectedin vivo, we analyzed the NICD generation in the brains of APP Tg and non-Tg mice by Western blot analysis. To overcome the potential problem of uneven loading or protein degradation, the ratio of the optical density of the γ-secretase-cleaved NICD band to that of the furin-cleaved band (NICD/furin ratio) was measured. There was a significant decrease in the NICD/furin ratio in the brain of APP-overexpressing mice, compared with that of control, non-Tg littermates (p < 0.02; Fig.4 A) To further test the hypothesis about competition between APP and Notch1 we measured the intensity of nuclear Notch1 immunostaining in the CA1 area of the hippocampus in APP Tg and non-Tg mice. The ratio of Notch1 fluorescence in the nucleus to total Notch1 fluorescence in the CA1 area was significantly lower in APP Tg compared with that in non-Tg mice (p < 0.001), which suggests that there is less Notch1 activation in APP-overexpressing neurons in vivo (Fig.4 B). There is a striking similarity between the proteolytic processing of the AD-related transmembrane protein APP and the Notch1 receptor. The latter is an important protein involved in cell-fate decisions during development (14Weinmaster G. Mol.

Both proteins undergo extracellular proteolytic event(s), which precede an intramembraneous cleavage. The last processing event appears to be carried out by an identical proteolytic activity, because both APP and Notch1 cleavage are highly dependent on PS1 activity, both are blocked by several APP specific γ-secretase inhibitors (5Wolfe M.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11223-11230Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 11Berezovska O. Jack C. McLean P. Aster J.C. Hicks C. Xia W. Wolfe M.S. Kimberly W.T. Weinmaster G. Selkoe D.J. Hyman B.T. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 583-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). We now address the question of whether APP and Notch1 compete for the same protease in a physiologically relevant way. We used two complementary approaches. 1) We compared the amount of γ-secretase processing of APP (by analyzing the secretion of Aβ into the conditioned media) after activation of endogenous Notch1, and 2) we compared the response of the Notch1 signaling pathway to stimulation with a physiological ligand in neurons overexpressing human mutant APP (APP695Sw) and in normal, non-transgenic neurons from littermate controls. Knowing that Notch1 becomes a γ-secretase substrate only when activated with its ligand Delta, we used increasing doses of the ligand to modulate the amount of one γ-secretase substrate (Notch1) leaving the amount of a competitive substrate (APP) constant. We found that stimulation of the endogenous Notch1 receptor results in a significant decrease in the level of total Aβ secretion in a dose-dependent manner. Control experiments showed that the effect was not mediated by any effect on APP levels or trafficking, because our data show no effect of Notch1 activation on the level of expression of total APP, cell surface APP, or α- and β-secretase products. These results are in accord with data in another system showing that APP processing by α-and β-secretases is independent of PS1/γ-secretase activity (6De Strooper B. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Vanderstichele H. Guhde G. Annaert W. Von Figura K. Van Leuven F. Nature. 1998; 391: 387-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (1550) Google Scholar). Moreover, whereas Aβ production was significantly impaired, there was only a subtle difference, not statistically significant, in the amount of C83 and C99 APP CTF(s) in the cell lysates as detected by Western blot analysis 24 h after the last application of Dl-Fc. The discordance between Aβ production and the accumulation of APP C-terminal fragments is similar to that observed for neuroblastoma cell lines stably transfected with PS1 deletion mutants (41Leem, J., Saura, C., Tomita, T., Iwatsubo, T., and Thinakaran, G. (2000) Society for Neuroscience Meeting, New Orleans, Abstr. 474.11..Google Scholar). Recent data on manipulation of nicastrin, a presenilin interactor, showed changes in Aβ production without alteration of C83/C99 levels (40Yu G. Nishimura M. Arawaka S. Levitan D. Zhang L. Tandon A. Song Y.Q. Rogaeva E. Chen F. Kawarai T. Supala A. Levesque L., Yu, H. Yang D.S. Holmes E. Milman P. Liang Y. Zhang D.M. Xu D.H. Sato C. Rogaev E. Smith M. Janus C. Zhang Y. Aebersold R. Farrer L.S. Sorbi S. Bruni A. Fraser P. St George-Hyslop P. Nature. 2000; 407: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar), also suggesting that Aβ production can be dissociated from C83/C99 changes, especially in the circumstances where the effect on Aβ production of the manipulation is more subtle then PS1 ablation or use of γ-secretase inhibitors. We do not rule out the possibility that there may be other substrates for γ-secretase besides APP and Notch1 or that there could be other molecules involved (such as nicastrin, for example) that modulate the γ-secretase cleavage of various substrates. There also could be indirect effects of Notch activation on APP processing or on Aβ clearance. However, our experiments clearly demonstrate that activation of Notch by its native ligand specifically resulted in diminished Aβ, without major changes in APP amount or subcellular distribution. Similarly, overexpression of APP specifically affected Notch cleavage/nuclear translocation/signaling but did not significantly change the level of Notch expression or its subcellular distribution. These observations strongly suggest that Notch and APP are competitive substrates for γ-secretase activity. The complementary experiment is also consistent with the hypothesis that ligand-activated Notch1 competes with APP for γ-secretase activity. Using both morphological (nuclear translocation) and physiological (CBF1 transactivation) quantitative assays we found that endogenous Notch1 signaling was significantly diminished in primary neurons overexpressing APP. In addition, analyzing nuclear (activated) Notch1 staining in the brain of APP overexpressing mice revealed that this effect can be detected in vivo. We suggest that an excess of APP shifts the enzymatic activity “equilibrium” toward APP processing and thus diminishes Notch1 from being cleaved and from activating the Notch signaling pathway; i.e. that activated Notch1 and APP are competitive substrates for γ-secretase processing. The relationships among APP, PS1-related γ-secretase activity, and Notch1 are complex and in some ways have appeared to be contradictory, but may be clarified in the context of our current studies. PS1 familial AD (FAD) mutations are gain-of-function in terms of APP processing resulting in increased production of (especially) Aβ42 peptide (44Borchelt D.R. Thinakaran G. Eckman C.B. Lee M.K.

Bihel F. da Costa C.A. Pourquie O. Checler F. Kraus J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 507-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) have described γ-secretase inhibitors that diminish Aβ without altering Notch cleavage (53Petit A. Bihel F. da Costa C.A. Pourquie O. Checler F. Kraus J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 507-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Based on our current data we propose that Notch1 and APP are competitive substrates for γ-secretase activity. If so, PS1 FAD mutations could be interpreted as altering the relative affinities of γ-secretase for APP and Notch1 to favor APP over Notch1 (Fig.5). This also predicts the possibility that some agents could differentially affect APP and Notch1 processing by γ-secretase, e.g. by inhibiting access of one or the other substrate, providing a possible explanation for the recent results of Petit et al. (53Petit A. Bihel F. da Costa C.A. Pourquie O. Checler F. Kraus J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 507-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). This formulation (Fig. 5) predicts that relative levels of Notch1 and APP expressed in cells, as well as the degree to which Notch1 is activated by ligand, could impact Aβ synthesis. Because Notch1 expression diminishes markedly with age (54Berezovska O. Xia M.Q. Page K. Wasco W. Tanzi R.E. Hyman B.T. J. Neuropath. Exp. Neurol. 1997; 56: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), there may be a subtle increase in Aβ production with age as a result of the release of APP/γ-secretase (PS1) from this substrate competition. However, the present study (using APP-overexpressing mice) and the fact that mice heterozygous for PS1+/− or Notch1+/− have no obvious pathologic phenotype, suggest that 50% of Notch1 activity is enough to maintain a normal phenotype. This might be an important assumption for the use of drugs inhibiting Aβ production, which have inhibition of Notch1 signaling as a side effect. We thank Dr. D.

This results in the manufacture, remodeling, and mineralization of a cartilage template on which bone is laid down. Articular chondrocytes undergo a similar but restricted differentiation program that does not proceed to mineralization, except in pathologic conditions such as osteoarthritis. The pathogenesis of disorders of cartilage development and metabolism, including osteochondrodysplasia, fracture non-union, and osteoarthritis remain poorly defined. We used the CFK2 model to examine the potential roles of phosphate and calcium ions in the regulatory pathways that mediate chondrogenesis and cartilage maturation. Differentiation was monitored over a 4-week period using a combination of morphological, biochemical, and molecular markers that have been characterized in vivo and in vitro. CFK2 cells expressed the type III sodium-dependent phosphate transporters Glvr-1 and Ram-1, as well as a calcium-sensing mechanism. Regulated expression and activity of Glvr-1 by extracellular phosphate and parathyroid hormone-related protein was restricted to an early stage of CFK2 differentiation, as evidenced by expression of type II collagen, proteoglycan, and Ihh. On the other hand, regulated expression and activity of a calcium-sensing receptor by extracellular calcium was most evident after 2 weeks of differentiation, concomitant with an increase in type X collagen expression, alkaline phosphatase activity and parathyroid hormone/parathyroid hormone-related protein receptor expression. On the basis of these temporally restricted changes in the sensing and transport of phosphate and calcium, we predict that extracellular phosphate plays a role in the commitment of chondrogenic cells to differentiation, whereas extracellular calcium plays a role at a later stage in their differentiation program.

Intramembranous bone, exemplified by the frontal and parietal bones of the cranial vault, is formed when mesenchymal stem cells differentiate directly into bone-forming osteoblasts. The bones at the base of the skull, including parts of the temporal and occipital bones, as well as the vertebral column and the appendicular skeleton, are formed by endochondral ossification. These “cartilage bones” are formed when mesenchymal precursors condense and differentiate into chondrogenic cells that deposit and mineralize a cartilage matrix (1Jee W.S.S. Weiss L. Histology Cell and Tissue Biology. Elsevier, New York1983: 200-255Crossref Google Scholar), which is remodeled by catabolic cells (chondroclasts) brought in by the vasculature (2Poole A.R. Laverty S. Mwale F. Henderson J.E. Goltzman D. The Osteoporosis Primer. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom2000: 3-17Google Scholar). The remodeled cartilage then forms the template on which bone is deposited by osteoblastic cells. The same process of endochondral ossification occurs in the adult during fracture healing. Although chondrocytes involved in endochondral ossification and those present in articular cartilage arise from the same lineage and are subject to similar regulatory mechanisms, those in articular cartilage do not proceed to mineralization competence under physiological conditions. The pathologic mineralization that occurs in disorders such as osteoarthritis has been attributed, in part, to dysregulation of pathways that maintain chondrogenic cells in a pre-mineralization state (3Terkeltaub R. Lotz M. Johnson K. Deng D. Hashimoto S. Goldring M.B. Burton D. Deftos L.J. Arthritis Rheum. 1998; 41: 2152-2164Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The pathways that regulate chondrocyte maturation and matrix mineralization are linked to signaling by systemic hormones such as growth hormone, thyroid hormone, and insulin; matrix macromolecules such as collagen and proteoglycan; and locally derived factors such as insulin-like growth factor-1, transforming growth factor β, fibroblast growth factors (FGFs),1 and parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) (4Henderson J.E. Goltzman D. Henderson J.E. Goltzman D. The Osteoporosis Primer. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom2000: 113-128Google Scholar). Defects in the genes encoding components of these signaling pathways, matrix molecules, or enzymes that remodel that matrix can lead to severe skeletal deformities that are collectively known as chondrodysplasia (5Warman M.L.

Cell. 1998; 93: 411-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1489) Google Scholar). In cartilage destined to become bone, cells committed to chondrogenesis undergo a program of differentiation characterized by changing patterns of gene expression, matrix deposition and remodeling. For example, the major synthetic products of immature cells are type II collagen and sulfated proteoglycans, whereas differentiated cells express high levels of alkaline phosphatase and type X collagen prior to depositing mineral in the surrounding matrix. The changes in gene expression are accompanied by phenotypic alterations that include a progressive increase in cell size (hypertrophy) and the appearance of specialized outcroppings of the plasma membrane called matrix vesicles (9Anderson H.C. Clin. Orthoped. Rel. Res. 1995; 314: 266-280PubMed Google Scholar). Because of their central role in physiologic and pathologic mineralization, the biogenesis and release of matrix vesicles from chondrocytes has been a subject of intense investigation for more than 3 decades. Although the signals that initiate their budding and release from the cell remain undefined (10Glaser J.H. Conrad H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12607-12611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), they have been identified on proliferating and hypertrophic chondrocytes in vivo and shown to be released from both non-mineralizing and mineralizing chondrocytes in culture. Although many investigators believe that nucleation occurs exclusively in matrix vesicles (9Anderson H.C. Clin. Orthoped. Rel. Res. 1995; 314: 266-280PubMed Google Scholar), others have identified focal areas of mineralization in cartilage matrix in the absence of a surrounding vesicular membrane (11Gerstenfeld L.C. Landis W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 501-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Thus, the initial site at which mineral crystals are deposited in cartilage and the mechanisms that regulate their deposition remain a question of debate. Despite this uncertainty it is evident that, in vivo, matrix vesicles are concentrated in areas of cartilage that are destined to undergo mineralization and that they contain high levels of alkaline phosphatase, which is considered to be essential to generate inorganic phosphate from organic substrates (12Poole A.R. Hall B. Newman S. Cartilage: Molecular Aspects. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 179-211Google Scholar). Additional studies suggest that proteoglycan can act as a focal nucleator for hydroxyapatite crystal formation, and that type II collagen cleavage by collagenase is a requisite step in the mineralization process, which allows for the release and accumulation of the C-propeptide (chondrocalcin), which binds avidly to hydroxyapatite (13Billinhurst R.C. Dahlberg L. Ionescu M. Reiner A. Bourne R. Rorabeck C. Mitchell P. Hambor J. Diekmann O. Tschesche H. Chen J. vanWart H. Poole A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1534-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). Phosphate has long been recognized to play a central role in cartilage mineralization. In this context, its facilitated transport across the kidney tubule is necessary to maintain adequate circulating levels and its local concentration in cartilage is required for the initial phase of hydroxyapatite crystal formation. The homeostatic maintenance of extracellular phosphate is achieved primarily by re-absorption of phosphate in the proximal kidney tubule through the hormone- and phosphate-sensitive type II transporter (14Tenenhouse H.S. J Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Inefficient re-absorption of phosphate by the kidney is associated with defective mineralization of the skeleton, which manifests as rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. High doses of oral phosphate have been shown to be as effective as vitamin D in healing rachitic lesions in humans (15Glorieux F.H. Scriver C.R. Reade R.M. Goldman H. Rosenborough A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1972; 287: 481-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), as well as in rats (16Simmons D.J. Kunin A.S. Clin. Orth. Rel. Res. 1970; 68: 252-260Google Scholar) and mice (17Marie P.J. Travers R. Glorieux F.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1981; 67: 911-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). By adapting micropuncture techniques to sample cartilage lymph in the growth plates of rachitic rats, it was shown that phosphate is preferentially sequestered relative to calcium in the zone of hypertrophic cells surrounded by unmineralized cartilage (18Howell D. Pita J. Marquez J. Madruga J. J. Clin. Invest. 1968; 47: 1121-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). These observations were supported by the work of Kakuta et al. (19Kakuta S. Golub E.E. Shapiro I.M. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1985; 37: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), who suggested that regulation of the size of the inorganic phosphate pool may be the rate-limiting factor in cartilage mineralization. Furthermore, using a variety of different cell and organ culture systems, investigators have determined that the ideal medium for the culture of chondrogenic and osteogenic cells is high in phosphate and low in calcium, compared with conventional media, in which the opposite is true (20Bingham P.J. Raisz L.G. Calcif. Tissue Res. 1974; 14: 31-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 21Golub E.E. Schattachneider S.C. Berthold P. Burke A. Shapiro I.M. J. Biol.

Acta. 1999; 1449: 284-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). A type III sodium-dependent transport mechanism has been identified in chondrocytes and osteoblasts, as well as in other cells including those of the kidney epithelium. In 1991, the group of Caverzasio and Bonjour (24Montessuit C. Caverzasio J. Bonjour J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17791-17797Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) identified and characterized a phosphate transport mechanism in matrix vesicles isolated from the growth plates of normal and rachitic chicks. The system was sodium-dependent, sensitive to hormone stimulation and phosphate deprivation, and up-regulated in the rachitic animals. The same group subsequently cloned the murine gene for gibbon ape leukemia virus (Glvr-1, now known as Pit-1) and demonstrated high levels of expression in the resting and proliferative zones of murine growth plates (25Palmer G. Manen D. Bonjour J. Caverzasio J. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 244: 35-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 26Palmer G. Zhao J. Bonjour J. Hofstetter W. Caverzasio J. Bone. 1999; 24: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The amphotropic murine retrovirus receptor falls into the same family of type III phosphate transporters, although its regulation in skeletal tissues is less well defined (27Kavanaugh M.P. Miller D.G. Zhang W. Law W. Kozak S.L. Kabat D. Miller A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7071-7075Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Taken together with evidence documenting the central role played by ambient phosphate in cartilage mineralization, these observations suggested that its focal accumulation inside the cell might also be necessary for chondrocyte differentiation and/or matrix mineralization. Phosphate and calcium are the major constituents of the mineral phase of cartilage, bone, and dentin, which predicts that mechanisms for the regulated sensing and uptake of both ions might be present in the cells that are responsible for mineralizing these tissues. A cell surface calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) was isolated and cloned from bovine parathyroid cells by Brown and colleagues in 1993 (28Brown E.M. Gamba G. Riccardi D. Lombardi M. Butters R. Kifor O. Sun A. Hediger M.A. Lytton J. Hebert S.C. Nature. 1993; 366: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2351) Google Scholar). The principal role of this polyvalent cation-sensing receptor lies in calcium homeostasis, to transduce signals elicited by small changes in extracellular calcium into altered secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) by parathyroid cells. A CaSR is also expressed in cells lining the kidney tubule, where it can modulate renal cation handling (29Bapty B.W. Dai L.-J. Ritchie G. Jirik F. Canaff L. Hendy G.N. Quamme G.A. Kidney Int. 1998; 53: 583-592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Naturally occurring inactivating and activating mutations in the CaSR gene cause familial hypercalcemic and hypocalcemic disorders, respectively (30Hendy G.N. D'Souza L. Yang B. Canaff L. Cole D.E.C. Hum. Mutat. 2000; 16: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Calcium-sensing mechanisms have also been detected in cells other than parathyroid and kidney including neurons, pancreatic cells, keratinocytes, ostoeoblasts, and chondrocytes (31Yamaguchi T. Chattopadhyay N. Brown E.M. Advances in Pharmacology. 2000; 47: 209-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The physiological roles that have been proposed for these sensors include promotion of mitogenic activity in osteoblasts (32Pi M. Garner S.C. Flannery P. Sputney R.P. Quarles L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3256-3263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and stimulation of differentiation in keratinocytes (33Bickle D.D. Ratnam A. Mauro T. Harris J. Pillai S. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1085-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that a calcium-sensing mechanism is also expressed in differentiated chondrocytes in rodent growth plates, where it may be involved in matrix mineralization (34Chang W. Tu C. Bajra R. Komuves L. Miller S. Strewler G. Shoback D. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1911-1919Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanisms that regulate chondrocyte function have been examined in primary cultures of growth plate cells by several different investigators (35Kirsch T. Nah H.-D. Shapiro I. Pacifici M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1149-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 36Alini M. Kofsky Y. Wu W. Pidoux I. Poole A.R. J. Bone Miner.

In the present work we have used a well characterized chondrogenic cell line, CFK2, to explore the potential roles of phosphate and calcium ions in regulating chondrocyte differentiation and cartilage maturation. The CFK2 and CFK1 cell lines were developed by limiting dilution and spontaneous transformation of cells released by collagenase digestion of fetal rat cranial bones. On the basis of morphological, histological and biochemical studies, the CFK2 cell line was designated chondrogenic and the CFK1 line osteogenic (38Bernier S.M. Desjardins J. Sullivan A.K. Goltzman D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 145: 274-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In view of their capacity to differentiate into hypertrophic chondrocytes under the appropriate culture conditions, the CFK2 cells have subsequently been used extensively as an in vitro model to investigate various aspects of chondrocyte biology at the cellular and molecular biochemical level (39Bernier S.M.

In the present work, we demonstrate regulated expression and activity of the type III Glvr-1 phosphate transporter during early CFK2 differentiation in vitro, whereas expression and activity of a CaSR, which is responsive to changes in extracellular calcium, is up-regulated in differentiated CFK2 cells. All cell culture reagents were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc., and plasticware from Becton Dickinson Labware (Lincoln Park, NJ). Actinomycin D, cycloheximide, and colchicine, obtained from Sigma, were dissolved in 100% ethanol and diluted in culture medium to concentrations of 2 μg/ml actinomycin D, 50 μm cycloheximide, 0.3 and 0.5 μmcolchicine. [32P]Orthophosphoric acid was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences and 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide from Sigma. All other reagents were of high chemical purity and purchased from standard laboratory suppliers. Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640, which contains 0.4 mm Ca2+ and 5 mm Pi, supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotic/antimycotic. Calcium was increased to the appropriate molar concentrations by addition of Ca2+, and the Pidecreased by diluting with phosphate-free RPMI 1640 medium to the indicated concentrations. Where indicated, CFK2 cultures were treated with PTHrP-(1–34) (Peninsula Laboratories, Belmont, CA) at the indicated concentrations for 24 h. To maintain the de-differentiated phenotype, cells were subcultured on a twice weekly basis using 0.25% trypsin diluted in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Differentiation was accomplished by bringing the cells to confluence and then maintaining them for 1–4 weeks in medium supplemented with 5% FBS. Replicate cultures of CFK2 cells were plated at a density of 5 × 104 in 35-mm dishes and removed at confluence (time 0) and at weekly intervals up to 4 weeks. Cells were rinsed with PBS, fixed with fresh 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min, and stained with Alcian Blue, to identify proteoglycan deposition, or treated with naphthol AS-MX phosphate and Fast Red Violet LB (Sigma) to measure alkaline phosphatase activity as described previously (47Henderson J.E.

Stained dishes were overlaid with 70% glycerol in PBS and photographed on a Nikon Labophot-2 microscope with a UFX-DX photomicrographic attachment. Total RNA was harvested from CFK2 cells at timed intervals and under the indicated culture conditions, and from the rat PT cell line (48Ikeda K. Weir E.C. Sakaguchi K. Burtis W.J. Zimering M.

Single cell organisms such as the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae are able to adapt rapidly to extreme changes in extracellular salinity or nutrient availability and are consequently convenient model systems to study stress tolerances. Salt stress implies both exposures to osmotic stress and to specific cation toxicity (1Serrano R. Mulet J.M. Rios G. Marquez J.A. de Larrinoa I.F. Leube M.P. Mendizabal I. Pascual-Ahuir A. Proft M. Ros R. Montesinos C. J. Exp. Bot. 1999; 50: 1023-1036Crossref Google Scholar). In yeast an increased extracellular osmolarity causes the induction of a number of stress-protective genes of which the major outcome is the accumulation of glycerol and the restoration of turgor pressure (2Hohmann S. Hohmann S. Mager W.H. Yeast Stress Responses. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1997: 101-145Google Scholar). The high osmolarity glycerol mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway plays a dominant role in the signal transduction contributing to the adaptive response of yeast to high osmolarity or salinity (1Serrano R. Mulet J.M. Rios G. Marquez J.A. de Larrinoa I.F. Leube M.P. Mendizabal I. Pascual-Ahuir A. Proft M. Ros R. Montesinos C. J. Exp. Bot. 1999; 50: 1023-1036Crossref Google Scholar, 2Hohmann S.

Science. 1993; 259: 1760-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar). Additionally, the Ras-cAMP-protein kinase A pathway that responds more generally to stresses and nutrient availability also plays an important role in osmotic adaptation (4Thevelein J.M. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1753-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 5Marquez J.A. Serrano R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 6Norbeck J. Blomberg A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 158: 121-126Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Adaptation to salt stress also requires the modification of plasma or vacuolar membrane transport systems to exclude toxic ions from the cytosol. Both the high osmolarity glycerol pathway and the calcium-calcineurin pathway participate in the regulation of ion transporters during salt stress, especially of the Na+-pumping ATPase encoded by the ENA1 gene (1Serrano R. Mulet J.M. Rios G. Marquez J.A. de Larrinoa I.F. Leube M.P. Mendizabal I. Pascual-Ahuir A. Proft M. Ros R. Montesinos C. J. Exp. Bot. 1999; 50: 1023-1036Crossref Google Scholar). Considerably less information exists about cellular targets of salt toxicity. Sodium and lithium inhibit Hal2p, a specific phosphatase acting on 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphate (PAP)1 (7Murguia J.R. Bellés J.M. Serrano R. Science. 1995; 267: 232-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 8Murguia J.R. Bellés J.M. Serrano R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29029-29033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). PAP accumulation during salt stress inhibits sulfate assimilation and RNA processing, and this accounts for part of the salt toxicity. In addition lithium inhibits the essential ribonuclease MRP (9Dichtl B. Stevens A. Tollervey D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7184-7195Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Other targets of salt toxicity must exist, although previous mutational analyses have failed to identify them. In the present work a genetic analysis has led to the identification of Gcn2p as a negative determinant of yeast salt tolerance. This protein kinase participates in one of the best characterized mechanisms of translational regulation in eukaryotes, which involves the phosphorylation of the α-subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2α) at serine 51 (10Hershey J.W.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 717-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar, 11de Haro C. Mendéz R. Santoyo J. FASEB J. 1997; 10: 1378-1387Crossref Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In yeast this regulatory pathway is activated when cells are subjected to amino acid or purine starvation and is called the general amino acid control (12Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21661-21664Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Yeast Gcn2 protein kinase regulates the translation of a single mRNA species, encoding Gcn4p, a transcriptional activator of genes involved in the synthesis of amino acids. This regulation is mediated by four short open reading frames (uORFs) in the leader of the GCN4 mRNA, which renders GCN4expression hypersensitive to the levels of active eIF2 in the cell. In cells not limiting for amino acids and thus with abundant active eIF2, the uORFs block GCN4 translation. In cells deprived of an amino acid or purine, Gcn2p phosphorylation of eIF2α leads to reduced active eIF2 levels, which alleviates the inhibitory effects of the uORFs and allows increased GCN4 translation. Here we present a link between this regulatory pathway and the response to salinity stress. We demonstrate that salt stress induces the general amino acid control response and postulate that (over)activation of this pathway results in some toxic effect that inhibits growth under NaCl stress. The conserved nature of the Gcn2p pathway suggests that this mechanism of sodium toxicity may be of general significance in eukaryotes. All plasmids used in this study are derived from YCp50 (p16), a low copy number plasmid marked with URA3 and containing either the GCN4 wild type allele (p164) (13Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 2349-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), aGCN4 mutant allele that contains only the first uORF (p235), or a GCN4-lacZ fusion including the GCN45′-noncoding region with all four short uORFs (p180) (14Mueller P.P.

Schiestl R.H. Willems A.R. Woods R.A. Yeast. 1995; 11: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1667) Google Scholar). Yeast strains H1725 (gcd7-201) and H1794 (gcd7-201 gcn2) were derived from the H1727 (Mat α leu2-3,112 ura3-52) background and have been described previously (16Bushman J.L. Asuru A.I. Matts R.L. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1920-1932Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). All other strains were derived from the W303-1A (Mat a ade 2-1 can1-100 his3-11,15 leu2-3,112 trp1-1 ura3-1) or W303-1B (Mat α) background. Strains SKY697 and AG86 have been obtained by disrupting the ENA1–4 open reading frames and have been described elsewhere (17Goossens A. de la Fuente N. Forment J. Serrano R. Portillo F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7654-7661Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Ahal2::URA3 disruption cassette (18Gläser H.U. Thomas D. Gaxiola R. Montrichard F. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Serrano R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3105-3110Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) was used to generate the hal2 mutants, whereas cpc2,gcn1, gcn2, and gcn3 mutants were generated by replacing the respective open reading frames with aloxP-kanMX-loxp disruption cassette following the method described by Güldener et al. (19Güldener U. Heck S. Fiedler T. Beinhauer J. Hegemann J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2519-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar). Standard methods for yeast culture and manipulation were used (20Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, Inc., New York1991Google Scholar). In order to test for salt tolerance, the different strains were grown to saturation (48 h) in liquid-rich medium. Cultures were diluted 10-, 100-, and 1,000-fold, and volumes of about 3 µl were dropped with a stainless steel replicator (Sigma) on plates containing 2% Bacto-Agar (Difco) and rich medium with NaCl, KCl, or sorbitol as indicated. Rich medium (YPD) contained 1% yeast extract (Difco), 2% Bacto-peptone (Difco), and 2% glucose. Strain AG86 (W303-1B ena1–4::HIS3) was transformed with a mTn-lacZ/LEU2 mutagenized insertion library (21Burns N. Grimwade B. Ross-Macdonald P.B. Choi E.Y. Finberg K. Roeder G.S. Snyder M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1087-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Disruption mutants that suppressed the salt sensitivity of this strain were isolated as colonies growing after 9 days in synthetic minimal medium plates (SD) supplemented with methionine (100 µg/ml) and 0.6 m NaCl. SD plates contain 2% Bacto-Agar (Difco), 2% glucose, 0.7% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Difco), 50 mm succinic acid adjusted to pH 5.5 with Tris base, and adenine (30 µg/ml), tryptophan (80 µg/ml), and uracil (30 µg/ml) as required. Mutants with the strongest salt tolerance phenotype were isolated and designated sed mutants (for suppression ofena1–4 by disruption). By crossing with the SKY697 strain (W303-1A ena-4::HIS3), sporulation, and tetrad dissection the linkage between the salt tolerance phenotype and the transposon insertion was verified. To identify the genomic site of transposon insertion in the most relevant mutants, a plasmid rescue method was followed (21Burns N. Grimwade B. Ross-Macdonald P.B. Choi E.Y. Finberg K. Roeder G.S. Snyder M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1087-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Strains were grown in liquid YPD medium to mid-logarithmic phase and then shifted to fresh minimal SD medium without any amino acid supplements or YPD medium with NaCl (1.25m) or KCl (1.25 m) as indicated. Protein extraction, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, Western blotting with the ECL Plus detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), using either a polyclonal antibody that specifically recognizes eIF2α phosphorylated at serine 51 or a polyclonal antibody that recognizes both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms of eIF2α, were executed as described (22Yang R. Wek S.A. Wek R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2706-2717Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The MacBas version 2.5 software was used to quantify the optical density of the eIF2α bands on scanned autoradiographs. Yeast strains were grown to mid-logarithmic phase in liquid YPD medium or YPD medium with KCl (1.25m) or NaCl (1.25 m). Protein extraction, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, blotting, and immunoassay with a polyclonal antibody against Hal2p were performed as described (18Gläser H.U. Thomas D. Gaxiola R. Montrichard F. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Serrano R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3105-3110Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were grown in liquid SD medium with all amino acids supplemented to mid-logarithmic phase and then shifted to fresh SD medium without any amino acid supplements or SD medium with all amino acid supplements and either KCl (1.25 m) or NaCl (1.25m). In all cultures uracil was omitted to keep selection for the p180 plasmid. Preparation of cells and determination of the β-galactosidase activity was performed as described (23Gaxiola R. de Larrinoa I.F. Villalba J.M. Serrano R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3157-3164Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase activity was measured during a period of 10 h following shift of medium. Yeast cells were grown in liquid SD medium to mid-logarithmic phase, shifted to fresh SD medium or SD medium with either KCl (1.25m) or NaCl (1.25 m), and incubated for an additional 2 h, corresponding to steady-state levels of intracellular cations (24Mulet J.M. Leube M.P. Kron S.J. Rios G. Fink G.R. Serrano R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3328-3337Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Subsequently amino acid uptake and incorporation assays were performed. In case of SD medium without salts the 2-h extra incubation period was omitted. Cells were washed and incubated in 50 mm succinate/Tris buffer (pH 5.5), 2% glucose with 10 µm [14C]phenylalanine or [14C]leucine and with either KCl (1.25 m), NaCl (1.25 m), or no extra salts added. Amino acid uptake was measured during 2 min of incubation by liquid scintillation counting as described (25Vallejo C.G. Serrano R. Yeast. 1989; 5: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). [14C]Phenylalanine (10 µm) was added to the cultures after the 2-h incubation period, and cells were further incubated. Samples were taken after 0, 15, 30, 45, and 60 min, mixed with trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 10%, incubated on ice, and passed through 4.5-µm nitrocellulose filters. Filters were washed with 10% trichloroacetic acid and H2O and were then assayed for [14C]phenylalanine activity by liquid scintillation counting as above. Cells grown in YPD medium to mid-logarithmic phase were supplemented with NaCl and incubated for an additional 120 min. The steady-state intracellular sodium and potassium concentrations were measured by atomic absorption spectrometry after centrifugation, washing, and extraction of the cells as described (24Mulet J.M. Leube M.P. Kron S.J. Rios G. Fink G.R. Serrano R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3328-3337Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In order to identify novel determinants of salt tolerance in S. cerevisiae, we have designed a screening based on the isolation of recessive, loss-of-function mutations suppressing the salt sensitivity of ena1–4 disruptants in medium supplemented with methionine. To this end we used a transposon-tagging strategy in which the ena1–4 strain was transformed with a mTn-lacZ/LEU2 mutagenized insertion library (21Burns N. Grimwade B. Ross-Macdonald P.B. Choi E.Y. Finberg K. Roeder G.S. Snyder M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1087-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). The ena1–4 strain was used to avoid the complex regulatory system of this major determinant of salt tolerance (1Serrano R. Mulet J.M. Rios G. Marquez J.A. de Larrinoa I.F. Leube M.P. Mendizabal I. Pascual-Ahuir A. Proft M. Ros R. Montesinos C. J. Exp. Bot. 1999; 50: 1023-1036Crossref Google Scholar), whereas methionine supplementation bypasses the salt-sensitive Hal2p phosphatase (18Gläser H.U. Thomas D. Gaxiola R. Montrichard F. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Serrano R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3105-3110Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Disruption mutants, which suppressed the salt sensitivity of this strain, were isolated and designated sedmutants, for suppression of ena bydisruption. In five out of seven tested sedmutants so far, the phenotype was linked to the transposon insertion. Identification of the insertion locus in the genome showed that these five sed mutants were allelic and that the insertion occurred 12 nucleotides upstream of the GCN2 open reading frame (sed1 mutant, Fig.1 A) on chromosome IV. To verify that this event resulted in a loss of GCN2 function, we constructed a gcn2 mutant by removing the completeGCN2 open reading frame. The sed1 and thegcn2 mutations suppress the Na+ sensitivity of the ena1–4 strain to the same extent, indicating that the transposon insertion in the proximal promoter region of GCN2completely abolishes its activity (Fig. 1 B). GCN2 encodes a protein kinase involved in translational regulation during amino acid starvation, a regulatory pathway called the “general amino acid control response” (12Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21661-21664Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). The connection of this pathway with salt tolerance could be mediated by the translation of some protein related to either osmotic regulation or ion homeostasis. Further analysis of the behavior of gcn2 mutants subjected to salinity or osmotic stress revealed that the salt tolerance phenotype was specific for Na+ ions (Fig. 2). No increased tolerance to toxic concentrations of KCl or sorbitol was observed. On the contrary, gcn2 mutants grew somewhat slower in the presence of high concentrations of K+ ions. The same phenotypes of the gcn2 mutation were observed in anENA1–4 strain (Fig. 2). Sodium tolerance may be due to reduced intracellular Na+accumulation, and therefore we measured steady-state levels of intracellular sodium and potassium after a NaCl shock. As mentioned above, the enhanced salt tolerance by loss of GCN2 function is independent of the presence of ENA1, encoding the cation extrusion pump that acts as the major determinant of salt tolerance inS. cerevisiae. Although the efflux of Na+ from yeast cells is mostly dependent on the Ena1p ATPase (26Haro R. Garciadeblas B. Rodriguez-Navarro A. FEBS Lett. 1991; 291: 189-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), activities of other transporters like the H+-antiporter Nha1p (27Prior C. Potier S. Souciet J.L. Sychrova H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 387: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), the vacuolar H+-antiporter Nhx1p (28Nass R. Cunningham K.W. Rao R. J. Biol.

Biol. 2000; 20: 7654-7661Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) might affect intracellular cation accumulation. However, as indicated in Table I, steady-state levels of intracellular sodium and potassium after the NaCl shock were not significantly altered by loss of function of GCN2. Accordingly the effects of loss of GCN2 function on yeast salt tolerance could still be observed in nha1,nhx1, or trk1,2 mutant strains (data not shown), indicating that the known systems mediating sodium homeostasis are not involved.Table ILack of effect of loss of GCN2 function on cation accumulation by yeast cells1-aResults are the average (±S.D.) of two uptake experiments with three determinations each and are represented as nmol/mg of cells.

Open table in a new tab It has been proposed that during amino acid starvation, activation of the general amino acid control response due to eIF2α phosphorylation by Gcn2p is induced by uncharged tRNA (29Wek R.C.

Cell. 2000; 6: 269-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar).GCN2 function in vivo also requiresGCN1 and GCN20, encoding two proteins that form a complex that associates with ribosomes, physically interacts with Gcn2p, and is proposed to mediate activation of Gcn2p protein kinase in response to elevated levels of uncharged tRNA (32Vazquez de Aldana C.R. Marton M.J. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1399-3184Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 33Garcia-Barrio M. Dong J. Ufano S. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1887-1899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether this complex is also responsible for the negative effect ofGCN2 on salt tolerance, we constructed gcn1mutant strains. Loss of function of GCN1 increased sodium tolerance in both ena1–4 and ENA1–4 cells to the same extent as loss of GCN2 function (Fig.3). A similar genetic analysis was carried out using cells disrupted for the GCN3 locus. During translation initiation eIF2 delivers the initiator methionyl-tRNA (tRNA iMet) to 40 S ribosomal subunits in an eIF2·GTP·Met-tRNA iMet ternary complex and, upon AUG recognition, is released as an inactive eIF2·GDP binary complex. eIF2 is recycled to the GTP-bound state by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B. Phosphorylation of eIF2α by Gcn2p converts eIF2 from a substrate to an inhibitor of eIF2B, thereby blocking or lowering ternary complex formation.GCN3 encodes the α-subunit of eIF2B and as such forms part of the regulatory subcomplex in eIF2B that mediates inhibition of the guanine nucleotide exchange function by phosphorylated eIF2α (34Yang W. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6603-6616Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 35Pavitt G.D. Yang W. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1298-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 36Pavitt G.D. Ramaiah K.V. Kimball S.R. Hinnebusch A.G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 514-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). As in the case of GCN1 and GCN2, loss of GCN3 function also increased sodium tolerance (Fig. 3). These results suggest that the initial participants of the general amino acid control response somehow negatively affect yeast salt tolerance. It has been described that constitutive activation of the Gcn2p kinase in the GCN2c-517 dominant mutant allele results in growth inhibition (37Dever T.E. Feng L. Wek R.C. Cigan A.M. Donahue T.F. Hinnebusch A.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 585-596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Therefore, it seemed plausible that the negative effect of Gcn2p during Na+stress could be due to (over)activation of the kinase. This possibility was explored by determining whether saline stress enhances phosphorylation of eIF2α, a known physiological substrate of the Gcn2p kinase. Experiments were carried out by immunoblot analysis following the method described by Yang et al. (22Yang R. Wek S.A. Wek R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2706-2717Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), using polyclonal antibodies that either specifically recognize eIF2α phosphorylated at serine 51 or that recognize both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated eIF2α (Fig. 4). As expected, high extracellular NaCl concentrations increased eIF2α phosphorylation. This phosphorylation was entirely Gcn2p dependent since in gcn2 cells there was no detectable phosphorylation of eIF2α. The increase in phosphorylation was detectable 15 min after mid-logarithmic phase cells were shifted to medium containing NaCl and was visible for at least 24 h (data not shown). The highest ratio of phosphorylated to non-phosphorylated eIF2α was observed after 1 h following the shift to medium containing NaCl. This phenomenon is apparently due to the toxicity of the Na+ ions and not to an osmotic effect since equivalent concentrations (with respect to osmolarity) of KCl (and sorbitol, data not shown) did not evoke increased phosphorylation of eIF2α (Fig. 4). Although in yeast cells this is not very apparent, in mammalian cells eIF2α phosphorylation can lead to a severe down-regulation of the translation initiation rate and consequently of total protein synthesis (11de Haro C. Mendéz R. Santoyo J. FASEB J. 1997; 10: 1378-1387Crossref Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Therefore, we wanted to determine whether translation efficiency under salt stress is improved in gcn2cells and whether this could explain the salt tolerance phenotype. To this end, we measured incorporation of radioactive labeled phenylalanine into proteins in GCN2 and gcn2strains in the presence of high Na+ concentrations (Fig.5 A). As a control we performed the same measurements in medium with an equivalent concentration of K+ instead of normal medium since under these conditions the rate of amino acid uptake is similar to that in Na+-supplemented medium (Fig. 5 B). Also, during the period of the assay in both conditions cells suffer a similar temporary growth arrest (data not shown). Incorporation of phenylalanine was scored following a 2-h preincubation period in the presence of the salts to allow the cells to reach steady-state levels of intracellular cation concentrations. Under these conditions Na+ ions were found to inhibit translation substantially more than K+ ions. However, and most importantly, no significant differences in translation efficiency under salt stress conditions were observed between GCN2 and gcn2cells (Fig. 5 A), suggesting that the salt tolerance phenotype of gcn2 mutants cannot be attributed to a general improvement of translation initiation. In contrast with mammalian cells, in yeast the Gcn2 response, rather than regulating total protein synthesis, leads to enhanced translation of a specific mRNA encoding Gcn4p, a transcriptional activator of genes encoding amino acid biosynthetic enzymes (12Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21661-21664Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). To determine whether the enhanced eIF2α phosphorylation induced by toxic Na+ levels leads to translational stimulation ofGCN4 expression, we measured β-galactosidase activity in W303-1A cells, transformed with a plasmid expressing aGCN4-lacZ fusion containing all four uORFs, under different stress conditions (Fig. 6). As a positive control we used cells grown to mid-logarithmic phase in SD medium supplemented with all amino acids, which then were shifted to SD medium without any amino acid supplement. This strategy to induce amino acid starvation was used instead of the more common method of using toxic amino acid analogues due to the incompatibility with the amino acid auxotrophies of the W303-1A strain. Nevertheless, in this wayGCN4 expression could also be induced with similar kinetics as reported previously (38Albrecht G. Mösch H.U. Hoffman B. Reusser U. Braus G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12696-12702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) for 3-aminotriazole-induced starvation. Accordingly, Gcn2p-dependent eIF2α phosphorylation was also enhanced using this strategy (Fig. 4). As expected, when cells were shifted to medium with NaCl, GCN4 expression was induced, whereas a shift to medium with an equivalent concentration of KCl did not induce GCN4 expression. Comparison of β-galactosidase activities in NaCl-stressed GCN2 orgcn2 cells showed that the GCN4 expression was largely Gcn2p-dependent, as is also the case for amino acid-starved cells. GCN4 induction was detected ∼4 h after the shift to medium with NaCl and increased to higher levels than those obtained by amino acid starvation. In order to test the hypothesis that the negative effect of GCN2 on salt tolerance could be attributed to GCN4 activation, we used three different genetic approaches. In the first approach, we checked the salt tolerance of the gcd7-201 mutant (16Bushman J.L. Asuru A.I. Matts R.L. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1920-1932Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).GCD7 encodes the β-subunit of eIF2B that with Gcn3p and Gcd2p forms a regulatory subcomplex that mediates inhibition of eIF2B exchange function by phosphorylated eIF2α (34Yang W. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6603-6616Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Thegcd7-201 mutation elevates GCN4 expression levels (16Bushman J.L. Asuru A.I. Matts R.L. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1920-1932Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and, as indicated in Fig.7 A, this results in decreased salt tolerance. Deletion of GCN2 in this mutant background improved salt tolerance. In the second approach, we investigated the effect of loss ofCPC2 function in the W303-1A background.

SmRK1, a divergent type I transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) receptor of unknown ligand specificity, was previously identified as a candidate for a receptor that allows schistosomes to respond to host-derived growth factors. The TGF-β family includes activin, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), and TGF-β, all of which can play crucial roles in metazoan development. The downstream signaling protein of receptors that respond to TGF-β and activin is Smad2, whereas the receptors that respond to BMPs signal via Smad1. When a constitutively active mutant of SmRK1 was overexpressed with either schistosome Smad1 (SmSmad1) or SmSmad2, a receptor-dependent modulation of SmSmad phosphorylation and luciferase reporter activity occurred only with SmSmad2. To evaluate potential ligand activators of SmRK1, a chimeric receptor containing the extracellular domain of SmRK1 joined to the intracellular domain of the human type I TGF-β receptor was used. The chimeric receptor bound radiolabeled TGF-β and could activate a luciferase reporter gene in response to both TGF-β1 and TGF-β3 but not BMP7. Confirmatory results were obtained using full-length SmRK1. These experiments implicate TGF-β as a ligand for SmRK1 and as a potential host-derived regulator of parasite growth and development.

S. mansoni receptor kinase 1 transforming growth factor-β receptor-regulated Smad schistosome Smad type I TGF-β receptor type II TGF-β receptor activin receptor-like kinase bone morphogenetic protein activin type I receptor B. Schistosomiasis is a chronic parasitic disease that affects more than 200 million people worldwide with the majority of cases occurring in sub-Saharan Africa. Despite treatment programs, the number of individuals infected with schistosomes has not declined, and the rate of transmission is increasing, especially for Schistosoma mansoni (1Chitsulo L. Engels D. Montresor A. Savioli L. Acta Trop. 2000; 77: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). The morbidity associated with S. mansoniinfection results from hepatic damage induced by parasite eggs, which are released from mature worms residing in the mesenteric veins of the host (2Pearce E. Simpson A. Kierszenbaum F. Parasitic Infection and the Immune Response. Academic Press, San Diego1994: 203-223Google Scholar). During the prepatent period, the immature parasite must undergo a complex migration and developmental process within the host, and host factors have been implicated as regulators of these events (3Basch P.F. Schistosomes: Development, Reproduction, and Host Relations. Oxford University Press, New York1991Google Scholar, 4Amiri P. Locksley R.M. Parslow T.G. Sadick M. Rector E. Ritter D. McKerrow J.H.

However, the mechanisms used by the parasite to recognize and respond to host-derived factors are unknown. While investigating host-parasite interactions, our laboratory identified S. mansoni receptor kinase 1 (SmRK1)1, a receptor serine/threonine kinase from the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily, and showed it to be present on the surface of the parasite (6Davies S.J. Shoemaker C.B. Pearce E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11234-11240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). SmRK1 contains a conserved glycine-serine motif and shares up to 58% identity with kinase domains of other type I receptors in the TGF-β superfamily (6Davies S.J. Shoemaker C.B. Pearce E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11234-11240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, unusual features of its sequence such as an insert in the cytoplasmic juxtamembrane region and a large COOH-terminal extension make it a divergent member of the type I receptor subfamily. The TGF-β superfamily has been shown to participate in a wide variety of growth and developmental processes (7Massague J. Blain S.W. Lo R.S. Cell. 2000; 103: 295-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2060) Google Scholar), and the signaling pathways for many of the receptors in this family have been studied in great detail (8Massague J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar, 9Kawabata M. Miyazono K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 125: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 10Derynck R. Feng X.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F105-F150Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). In general, the type II receptor is responsible for binding ligand and recruiting the type I receptor into a heteromeric complex. The constitutively active kinase domain of the type II receptor phosphorylates the type I receptor, thereby activating its kinase domain. The activated type I receptor phosphorylates receptor-regulated Smad proteins (R-Smad), which can then translocate to the nucleus to modulate gene transcription. Typically, the receptors responding to TGF-β and activin signal through Smads 2 and 3, whereas the receptors responding to bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP) use Smads 1 and 5 (11Wrana J.L. Cell. 2000; 100: 189-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). We have recently identified two schistosome R-Smads (SmSmad1 and SmSmad2) and have shown that both can interact with SmRK1in vitro as well as signal downstream of vertebrate TGF-β receptors expressed in mammalian cells (12Beall M.J. McGonigle S. Pearce E.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). SmSmad2 was recently shown to be phosphorylated by a constitutively active SmRK1 in vitro (13Osman A. Niles E.G. LoVerde P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10072-10082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), but the physiological significance of the SmRK1-SmSmad1 interaction and, most importantly, the ligand specificity of SmRK1 are unknown. Receptor serine/threonine kinases from the TGF-β superfamily show a high degree of functional conservation across very different species. Because schistosomes, as parasites, live in physiological contact with their mammalian host, we wanted to address the possibility that TGF-β-related ligands from the host might activate SmRK1 during the course of infection. In this paper, we present evidence demonstrating that SmRK1 is capable of signaling via SmSmad2 in response to human TGF-β. The construction of pCMV2 FLAG-SmSmad1 and FLAG-SmSmad2 for NH2-terminal tagged SmSmads has been described previously (12Beall M.J. McGonigle S. Pearce E.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The pCMV5 TβRI-hemagglutinin vector (human type I TGF-β receptor), pCMV5 TβRII-His (human type II TGF-β receptor), and the 3TP-Lux luciferase reporter construct (14Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.F. Massague J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar) were provided by J. Massague (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY). The 12xGCCG-Lux luciferase reporter construct (15Kusanagi K. Inoue H. Ishidou Y. Mishima H.K. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) was provided by M. Kawabata (The Cancer Institute, Tokyo, Japan). Full-length SmRK1, which included an additional 188 amino acids at the COOH terminus relative to that originally published due to a recently discovered sequencing error (AF031557), was subcloned into pCMV5b FLAG (Sigma) in frame with a COOH-terminal FLAG epitope or pSecTag2 vector (Invitrogen) without a tag. The mutant forms of SmRK1 (Q303D,K331R) were generated using a polymerase chain reaction-based site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), and mutations were confirmed by sequencing. All chimeric receptors were generated using a sequential polymerase chain reaction-based approach adapted from previously published protocols (16Feng X.H. Derynck R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3912-3923Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) using a high fidelity Taq polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and the TOPO-TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). The resulting chimeric receptors were fully sequenced before subcloning into their final vectors. The TβRI/SmRK1 chimera was expressed in the pSecTag2 vector and included amino acid residues 34–186 from TβRI and residues 286–780 from SmRK1. The SmRK1/TβRI chimera was also expressed in this vector and contained amino acid residues 1–132 from SmRK1 and residues 126–503 from TβRI. The activin receptor-like kinase (ALK2)/TβRI chimera was expressed in pCMV5b FLAG and included amino acid residues 1–123 from ALK2, generated by polymerase chain reaction from murine cDNA, and included residues 126–503 from TβRI. Transcriptional response assays were performed as described previously (12Beall M.J. McGonigle S. Pearce E.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). R1B cells (provided by J. Massague) were plated at a density of 1 × 105cells/well of a 6-well plate and allowed to grow for 18–24 h. Cells were transiently transfected with the indicated constructs as well as pSVβ-galactosidase (Promega) using FuGENE6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After 24 h, cells were pre-incubated in reduced serum media (0.2% fetal bovine serum) for 4 h and either left untreated or stimulated for 20 h with 5 µl of vehicle (40% ethanol and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid), BMP7, or recombinant human TGF-β (R&D Systems). Both luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured from the same sample using a Berthold luminometer (Lumat LB9501). The results of the luciferase assay were normalized on the basis of β-galactosidase expression. The measurements were performed on triplicate samples/experiment, and the values reported represent pooled results from at least two independent experiments. The Student's t test was used to assess the statistical significance of these results. COS7 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) as directed. Approximately 48 h post-transfection, cells were washed and lysed, and the expressed proteins were immunoprecipitated according to protocols published previously (17Mehra A. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Methods Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 142: 67-78Google Scholar). SmRK1 receptors were immunoprecipitated with the anti-M2 FLAG antibody (Sigma), and the SmSmads were immunoprecipitated with the anti-M5 FLAG antibody (Sigma). Total cell lysates and immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to Immobilon P (Millipore) for immunoblotting and, in some cases, autoradiography. In vitro kinase assays of SmRK1 immunoprecipitated from COS7 cells were performed using 50 µm ATP and 30 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP/reaction (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in a total volume of 40 µl (18Carcamo J. Weis F.M. Ventura F. Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Massague J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3810-3821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After several washes in lysis buffer, proteins were eluted by boiling in sample buffer, separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and visualized by autoradiography. For 32P-phosphate labeling, cells were incubated for 2–3 h in phosphate-free minimum Eagle's medium containing 1 mCi/ml 32P-orthophosphate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The labeled cells were washed and lysed, and the epitope-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated (17Mehra A. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Methods Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 142: 67-78Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of proteins was assessed both by autoradiography and phosphorimaging analysis (PhosphorImager, Molecular Dynamics). The ligand binding of [125I]TGF-β (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) to transfected COS7 cells was performed according to previously published protocols (17Mehra A. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Methods Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 142: 67-78Google Scholar). Specifically, cells were treated with 250 pm [125I]TGF-β for either 30 min at 37 °C or 3 h at 4 °C, washed extensively, and then treated with 0.5 mg/ml of disuccinimidyl suberate (Pierce) for 30 min at 4 °C to cross-link the ligand to the receptors. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with either anti-MYC (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-hemagglutinin (Roche) antibody. For coimmunoprecipitation, the ligand binding was performed as above for 30 min at 37 °C, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with the anti-FLAG (M2) antisera. Phosphorimaging analysis of all dried gels was performed using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). SmRK1 interacts with both SmSmad1 and SmSmad2 in vitro (12Beall M.J. McGonigle S. Pearce E.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 13Osman A. Niles E.G. LoVerde P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10072-10082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The specificity of interaction between R-Smads and type I receptors is facilitated by specific structural motifs in each protein. The predominant domain in the R-Smad is a region of 17 amino acids referred to as the L3 loop (19Lo R.S. Chen Y.G. Shi Y. Pavletich N.P. Massague J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 996-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), and both SmSmads are highly conserved in this region relative to their mammalian counterparts (12Beall M.J. McGonigle S. Pearce E.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 13Osman A. Niles E.G. LoVerde P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10072-10082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). A 9-amino acid segment in the kinase domain of type I receptors referred to as the L45 loop has been reported to define the signaling specificity of type I receptors for intracellular responses (16Feng X.H. Derynck R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3912-3923Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). A cluster of four amino acids in this domain is important for receptor-Smad interactions and has been used to divide type I receptors into three categories based on the L45 loop sequence and Smad interactions (20Chen Y.G. Hata A. Lo R.S. Wotton D. Shi Y. Pavletich N. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2144-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). A comparison of the L45 loop sequence from SmRK1 with those of the three categories of type I receptors revealed that SmRK1 does not completely conform to any of these categories. Of the four critical amino acids, SmRK1 shares the first two with the TGF-β group, the third with the BMP group, and has a non-conserved substitution in the fourth position (Fig.1A). Hence, the signaling specificity of SmRK1 could not be predicted based upon this analysis nor could its in vitro interactions with SmSmads 1 and 2. To begin to address the signaling specificity of SmRK1 in the absence of a known ligand, a TβRI/SmRK1 chimera was generated. The chimera was constructed by joining the extracellular, transmembrane, and juxtamembrane domains of TβRI with the intracellular domain of SmRK1 beginning at the glycine-serine box (Fig. 1 B). Although the TβRI/SmRK1 chimera does not include the modified juxtamembrane domain of SmRK1, it does incorporate the COOH-terminal extension, which includes 175 amino acids beyond the conserved kinase domain of other type I receptors. The TβRI/SmRK1 chimera would permit ligand-dependent activation of the intracellular domain of SmRK1 to identify the downstream SmSmad pathway in a luciferase reporter assay. We have previously shown that SmSmad2 can signal downstream of TβRI and drive the expression of luciferase from the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 promoter region of the 3TP-Lux plasmid (12Beall M.J. McGonigle S. Pearce E.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). SmSmad1 activation was assessed using the 12xGCCG-Lux reporter plasmid in R1B cells, which are a derivative of mink lung epithelial cells lacking a functional type I TGF-β receptor. It has been shown previously that mammalian Smad1 can drive luciferase expression from the GCCG-Lux reporter construct in this cell type in response to BMP signaling (15Kusanagi K. Inoue H. Ishidou Y. Mishima H.K. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Likewise, when SmSmad1 was transfected into R1B cells with the GCCG-Lux reporter, it was able to enhance luciferase expression after treatment of the cells with BMP7 (Fig.2A). To test the ability of the TβRI/SmRK1 chimera to interact with the SmSmads, R1B cells were transiently transfected with either empty vector (pCMV5), each SmSmad alone, the TβRI/SmRK1 chimera alone, or a combination of the chimera with each SmSmad. Whereas very little change was observed in response to TGF-β in cells expressing only the chimera, coexpression with either SmSmad produced an increase in luciferase activity under both the basal and ligand-stimulated conditions (Fig. 2 B). However, only in the case in which TβRI/SmRK1 was coexpressed with SmSmad2 was the ligand-induced increase in luciferase activity significantly greater than that observed under basal conditions (p < 0.01). Because both of the SmSmads were able to increase luciferase activity in the presence of the stimulated TβRI/SmRK1 chimera, we decided to evaluate the signaling specificity of the full-length schistosome receptor containing kinase domain mutations, which would permit the modulation of receptor activity independent of the ligand. Based on the studies of other type I receptors (18Carcamo J. Weis F.M. Ventura F. Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Massague J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3810-3821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Massague J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2199-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar), mutations in the schistosome receptor were generated that were predicted to either constitutively activate (SmRK1(Q303D)) or inactivate (SmRK1(K331R)), the kinase domain of SmRK1 (Fig. 3A). Because SmRK1 is a divergent type I receptor, we initially tested the ability of these mutations to alter the kinase activity of the receptor in anin vitro kinase assay. Other type I receptors have been shown to undergo autophosphorylation in this reaction, providing an indication of the status of the receptor kinase. Whereas SmRK1 failed to autophosphorylate, it did phosphorylate an unknown substrate in the reaction mixture in a receptor-dependent fashion, and the level of phosphorylation was modulated according to the mutations in the kinase domain (Fig. 3 B). Having confirmed that the mutations did alter SmRK1 kinase activity, the mutant receptors were tested in an in vivo phosphorylation assay using each of the SmSmads as a substrate. COS7 cells expressing either FLAG-tagged SmSmad1 or SmSmad2 alone or in combination with SmRK1(QD) or SmRK1(KR) were labeled with 32P-orthophosphate, and the SmSmads were immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG(M5) antibody. Whereas the level of expression of SmSmad1 was less than that observed for SmSmad2, SmSmad1 was clearly detectable in total cell lysates, and no receptor-dependent differences in SmSmad1 phosphorylation were observed (data not shown). In contrast, the phosphorylation of SmSmad2 was increased by 60% in the presence of SmRK1(QD) and decreased by 20% in the presence of SmRK1(KR) relative to SmSmad2 expressed alone (Fig. 3 C). To obtain additional functional evidence regarding the SmSmad specificity of SmRK1, the mutant forms of the schistosome receptor were evaluated in the luciferase reporter assay. R1B cells were transfected with either empty vector, each SmSmad alone or in combination with either wild type SmRK1, SmRK1(QD), or SmRK1(KR), in the presence of the appropriate reporter construct for each SmSmad. The coexpression of SmRK1(QD) with SmSmad2 resulted in a 12-fold increase in luciferase activity, 6 times greater than that observed with SmSmad2 alone, and the response was completely reduced to background levels in the presence of SmRK1(KR) (Fig. 3 D). Although a 10-fold increase in luciferase activity was observed when SmSmad1 was coexpressed with SmRK1(QD), this response was only 2-fold greater than that for SmSmad1 expressed alone and was not significantly reduced in the presence of the kinase dead form of SmRK1 (Fig. 5A). These data, obtained in the absence of ligand, are consistent with the results from the luciferase assay using the TβRI/SmRK1 chimera and demonstrate that SmRK1 has greater signaling specificity through SmSmad2, similar to that of TGF-β and activin receptors. Having investigated the signaling specificity of the intracellular domain of SmRK1, we next directed our attention to the extracellular domain of the receptor and its ability to interact with ligands from the TGF-β superfamily. Using a chimeric receptor approach similar to that employed for ALK1 (22Lux A. Attisano L. Marchuk D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9984-9992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), two chimeric receptors were constructed: 1) the extracellular domain of either SmRK1 or 2) the type I receptor for BMP7, ALK2, was fused to the transmembrane and intracellular domain of TβRI, resulting in a SmRK1/TβRI chimera and an ALK2/TβRI chimera, respectively (Fig. 1 B). Each of these chimeras could be expressed at high levels in COS7 cells (data not shown). In R1B cells, the ALK2/TβRI chimera served as both a positive and negative control in the luciferase reporter assays. A similar chimera when expressed in R1B cells has been shown previously to be unresponsive to TGF-β in luciferase reporter assays using a plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 reporter construct (16Feng X.H. Derynck R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3912-3923Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). However, we expected this chimera to activate the 3TP-Lux reporter when the R1B cells were treated with BMP7, as BMP7 has been shown to activate ALK2 receptors (23Macias-Silva M. Hoodless P.A. Tang S.J. Buchwald M. Wrana J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25628-25636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). To confirm the activity of the chimeric signaling system, R1B cells expressing either empty vector or the ALK2/TβRI receptor were stimulated overnight with TGF-β1 or BMP7. Although minor fluctuations were observed with the empty vector control, the ALK2/TβRI chimera showed no response when treated with TGF-β1 but demonstrated a 2.5-fold increase in luciferase activity in response to BMP7. When the SmRK1/TβRI chimera was expressed in R1B cells under these same conditions, a 2.5-fold increase in luciferase activity was observed after treatment with TGF-β1, and no change in activity occurred after stimulation with BMP7 (Fig.4A). In an attempt to improve the magnitude of the luciferase response, the chimeric receptors were coexpressed with SmSmad2. The coexpression of SmSmad2 with TβRI was previously shown to enhance luciferase reporter activity in R1B cells treated with TGF-β compared with TβRI expressed alone (12Beall M.J. McGonigle S. Pearce E.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In the presence of SmSmad2, the SmRK1/TβRI chimera showed a 4-fold increase in luciferase activity in response to both TGF-β1 and TGF-β3 but showed no change after stimulation with BMP7 (Fig. 4 B). Similarly, R1B cells coexpressing the ALK2/TβRI chimera and SmSmad2 demonstrated a 4-fold increase in luciferase activity in response to BMP7, whereas the treatment with either isoform of TGF-β produced levels of luciferase activity similar to those for the pCMV5 control (data not shown). The results of these ligand interaction studies suggest that the extracellular domain of SmRK1 can specifically interact with TGF-β and lead to the activation of the SmRK1/TβRI chimera. However, the studies of mammalian TGF-β signaling have shown that type I TGF-β receptors like TβRI are unable to bind ligand in the absence of the type II TGF-β receptor (24Vivien D. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7134-7141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), suggesting that productive signaling for SmRK1/TβRI in R1B cells requires endogenous TβRII. To directly assess the ability of SmRK1 to interact with TGF-β independent of TβRII, [125I]TGF-β labeling of COS7 cells expressing either the SmRK1/TβRI chimera alone or in combination with TβRII was performed. As a positive control for TGF-β binding, TβRI and TβRII were coexpressed in COS7 cells. Type I receptors were immunoprecipitated with either anti-MYC or anti-hemagglutinin antibody directed against the COOH-terminal tagged epitope, and the presence of ligand-bound types I and II receptors was evaluated. Similar to other type I TGF-β receptors, the chimeric receptor containing the extracellular domain of SmRK1 was unable to bind ligand in the absence of the type II TGF-β receptor. However, when the SmRK1/TβRI chimeric receptor was coexpressed with TβRII, both receptors were present in the immunoprecipitate labeled with the radioactive TGF-β (Fig. 4 C). Control samples transfected with empty vector (pCMV5) or TβRII alone and immunoprecipitated with the MYC antisera were negative for ligand binding. Having evaluated the function of the intracellular and extracellular domains of SmRK1 independently, we wanted to test the ability of the full-length receptor to signal through the schistosome Smads in response to ligand stimulation in the luciferase reporter assay. R1B cells were transfected with either empty vector, each SmSmad alone, wild type SmRK1 alone, or in combination with each SmSmad, all in the presence of the appropriate reporter construct for the SmSmad. We first evaluated SmRK1-SmSmad1 interactions in response to both TGF-β and BMP7. When R1B cells expressing both SmRK1 and SmSmad1 were treated with TGF-β1, a ligand-dependent increase in luciferase activity resulted, but the increase was not significantly different from untreated cells coexpressing SmRK1 and SmSmad1 (p = 0.12) (Fig.5 B). Likewise, BMP7 treatment of cells coexpressing SmRK1 and SmSmad1 did not produce an increase in luciferase activity above that observed for untreated cells coexpressing these two proteins (Fig. 5 A and data not shown). We next examined whether the full-length receptor could signal through SmSmad2 in response to human TGF-β. When SmRK1 was coexpressed with SmSmad2, the luciferase activity increased 3-fold relative to SmSmad2 alone, and this level of activity doubled after the treatment of cells with TGF-β1 (p < 0.01) (Fig.6A). Thus, the results obtained with the full-length receptor confirm the findings that the activated intracellular domain of SmRK1 interacts with SmSmad2 (Figs.2 B and 3 C), and that the extracellular domain of SmRK1 functionally interacts with TGF-β (Fig. 4). Because the ligand binding and type II receptor interaction studies were performed with the SmRK1/TβRI chimera, full-length SmRK1 was tested for its ability to bind TGF-β and form a complex with TβRII and SmSmad2 in vivo. Previous studies have shown that the phosphorylation of Smad2 promotes its release from the type I receptor, but Smad2 can be immunoprecipitated with the receptor complex in the absence of phosphorylation (25Macias-Silva M. Abdollah S. Hoodless P.A. Pirone R. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1996; 87: 1215-1224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Hence, we tested the ability of the kinase dead form of SmRK1 along with TβRII to be coimmunoprecipitated by SmSmad2 in transfected COS7 cells. COS7 cells expressing SmSmad2 and TβRII either alone or in the presence of the untagged SmRK1(KR) were labeled with [125I]TGF-β for 30 min at 37 °C. After cross-linking and cell lysis, SmSmad2 was immunoprecipitated from the lysates with the anti-FLAG antibody. Although similar quantities of SmSmad2 were present in the total cell lysates, only those cells expressing the kinase dead form of SmRK1 demonstrated labeled receptor complexes after the SmSmad2 immunoprecipitation (Fig. 6 B). Taken together, the data obtained from the studies of the full-length receptor support the hypothesis that human TGF-β is capable of stimulating SmRK1 and activating a signal transduction pathway, which uses SmSmad2. Invertebrate BMP-like signaling pathways are well characterized with BMP receptors and ligands present in both nematodes and insects. However, evidence for TGF-β/activin type pathways in this group has emerged only recently from studies of Drosophila melanogaster (26Brummel T. Abdollah S. Haerry T.E. Shimell M.J. Merriam J. Raftery L. Wrana J.L. O'Connor M.B. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 98-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 27Das P. Inoue H. Baker J.C. Beppu H. Kawabata M. Harland R.M. Miyazono K. Padgett R.W. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 123-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Here we show that schistosomes which are members of the Platyhelminthes, a phylum that in the course of metazoan evolution diverged before the Nematoda, possess a type I receptor serine/threonine kinase that can be activated by human TGF-β and signal via schistosome Smad2. Because schistosomes are intravascular parasites of human beings, the activation of SmRK1 by a host-derived factor may have physiological relevance to the development of the parasite as well as the clinical course of the disease in humans. In the in vitro culture systems we have used to study SmRK1 signaling, the type II TGF-β receptor appears to facilitate TGF-β binding to SmRK1 and may promote the activation of SmRK1 in response to ligand. Nevertheless, the chimeric receptors used to evaluate functional receptor-ligand interactions, SmRK1/TβRI and ALK2/TβRI, demonstrated the affinity of SmRK1 for TGF-β. If a nonspecific interaction were occurring between TβRII and the chimeric receptors, increased luciferase activity in response to TGF-β would have been observed for the ALK2/TβRI chimera. Functional ligand interactions were not limited to the chimeric receptor as full-length SmRK1 was activated by TGF-β in the luciferase assay, and the parasite receptor could be found in a complex with TβRII, SmSmad2, and radiolabeled TGF-β immunoprecipitated from COS7 cells. The specificity of the interaction between SmRK1 and TβRII may also extend to the intracellular domain of the receptors. Previous studies using chimeric receptors have shown that only certain type I receptor intracellular domains can be activated by TβRII. For example, the chimeric receptor containing the extracellular domain of TβRI and the intracellular domain of the type I activin receptor, ActR-IB, was not activated by three different isoforms of TGF-β as measured by a luciferase reporter assay in R1B cells (22Lux A. Attisano L. Marchuk D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9984-9992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Whereas similar results have been obtained with TβRI/BMP receptors in R1B cells (28Persson U. Souchelnytskyi S. Franzen P. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Heldin C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21187-21194Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), the TβRI/ActR-IB findings are particularly interesting given that the kinase domains of TβRI and ActR-IB are 89% identical (TβRI and SmRK1 share only 57% identity). Taken together, these results imply that SmRK1 has both an affinity for TGF-β as well as a high degree of compatibility with TβRII. Further studies will be necessary to determine the means of TGF-β binding to the parasite receptorin vivo. An alternative hypothesis to explain the mechanism of activation of SmRK1 is that the receptor exhibits kinase activity independent of a type II receptor. It has recently been shown in Caenorhabditis elegans that the type I receptor DAF-1 maintains signaling activity in the absence of DAF-4, the only type II receptor present in the C. elegans genome (29Gunther C.V. Georgi L.L. Riddle D.L. Development. 2000; 127: 3337-3347PubMed Google Scholar). Gunther and colleagues suggest that the activity associated with DAF-1 may represent an evolutionary remnant owing to the origin of the receptor near the divergence of type I and type II receptors. We have previously shown in a phylogenetic analysis of SmRK1 that the schistosome receptor probably diverged before DAF-1 (6Davies S.J. Shoemaker C.B. Pearce E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11234-11240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), implying that SmRK1 may also be able to signal independently of a type II receptor. Additionally, the sequence differences present in the juxtamembrane and COOH terminus of SmRK1 are reminiscent of alternatively spliced isoforms of the mammalian type II receptors ActR-IIB (activin type II receptor B) and BRK-3 (BMP receptor kinase 3), respectively (30Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cheifetz S. Massague J. Cell. 1992; 68: 97-108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 31Nohno T. Ishikawa T. Saito T. Hosokawa K. Noji S. Wolsing D.H. Rosenbaum J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22522-22526Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Although type I receptor serine/threonine kinases have been described in other parasitic helminths (32Gomez-Escobar N. van den Biggelaar A. Maizels R. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 199: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), there have been no reports thus far of type II receptors. Although we have performed yeast two-hybrid screens to identify an interacting type II receptor for SmRK1 and other interacting proteins have been cloned and characterized, no type II receptor has been identified to date (33McGonigle S. Beall M.J. Feeney E.L. Pearce E.J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 65-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 34McGonigle S. Feeney E.L. Beall M.J. Pearce E.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 114: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The completion of the genome sequencing project for S. mansoni will provide valuable information regarding the presence or absence of additional TGF-β-signaling components in schistosomes. Whereas our studies and those of others (13Osman A. Niles E.G. LoVerde P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10072-10082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) suggest that SmRK1 signals through SmSmad2, there is also an interaction between SmRK1 and SmSmad1. When the two proteins were coexpressed in R1B cells, moderate increases in luciferase expression from the GCCG-Lux reporter plasmid were observed relative to SmSmad1 expressed alone. These findings may be an artifact resulting from the overexpression of proteins in mammalian cells, as similar observations have been made for TβRI and Smad1 coexpressed in COS cells (35Nakao A. Roijer E. Imamura T. Souchelnytskyi S. Stenman G. Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2896-2900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The observed enhancement in luciferase activity appeared to be independent of the activation state of the receptor as indicated by the experiments using the mutant forms of SmRK1. Likewise, the ligand-dependent activation of SmRK1 as either the TβRI/SmRK1 chimera or the wild type receptor was unable to significantly alter the activation state of SmSmad1 as measured by the luciferase reporter assay. Our inability to detect significant -fold increases in the presence of SmRK1 and ligand may be because of the participation and perhaps sequestration of SmSmad1 in the endogenous BMP pathway in R1B cells. Whether or not there is a physiologically relevant interaction between SmRK1 and SmSmad1 remains to be elucidated as does the possibility of another schistosome receptor for BMP-type ligands and SmSmad1 signaling. In these experiments, we have used a heterologous system to study the signaling specificity of a divergent type I TGF-β receptor from the trematode parasite, S. mansoni. Although there are several caveats to using these types of systems to interpret the function of a signal transduction pathway, we are limited to these methods, because schistosomes are not amenable to transfection or other means of genetic manipulation at this time. Although these experiments have been a useful means to initiate investigations of signaling in schistosomes, the predictive value of these systems can only be confirmed by studies of signal transduction within the parasite itself. We now have a hypothesis which can be tested in the parasite as well as the mouse model of schistosomiasis to determine the effects of TGF-β signaling through the SmRK1-SmSmad2 pathway on the development of the parasite and the clinical course of infection.

Kinetic evidence for a two-step acylation of PBP2x by penicillin-G has been demonstrated, and the dissociation constant, K d of 0.9 mm, and the acylation rate constant, k 2 of 180 s−1, have been determined for the first time. The millimolar range K d implies that the β-lactam fits to the active site pocket of the penicillin-sensitive PBP rather poorly, whereas the extremely fast k 2 value indicates that this step contributes most of the binding affinity of the β-lactam. The values of K d (4 mm) and k 2 (0.56 s−1) were also determined for PBP2xR. The combined value ofk 2/K d, known as overall binding efficiency, for PBP2xR (137m−1 s−1) was over 1000-fold slower than that for PBP2x (200,000 m−1s−1), indicating that a major part is played by the acylation steps in penicillin resistance. Most of the decreased binding efficiency of PBP2xR comes from the decreased (∼300-fold)k 2. Kinetic studies of cefotaxime acylation of the two PBP2x proteins confirmed all of the above findings. Deacylation rate constants (k 3) for the third step of the interactions were determined to be 8 × 10−6s−1 for penicilloyl-PBP2x and 5.7 × 10−4 s−1 for penicilloyl-PBP2xR, corresponding to over 70-fold increase of the deacylation rate for the resistant PBP2xR. Similarly, over 80-fold enhancement of the deacylation rate was found for cefotaxime-PBP2xRcomplex (k 3 = 3 × 10−4s−1) as compared with that of cefotaxime-PBP2x complex (3.5 × 10−6 s−1). This is the first time that such a significant increase ofk 3 values was found for a β-lactam-resistant penicillin-binding protein. These data indicate that the deacylation step also plays a role, which is much more important than previously thought, in PBP2xR resistance to β-lactams.

It is generally accepted that the interaction of a β-lactam (I) with a PBP follows a three-step reaction mechanism (13Frère J.M. Ghuysen J.-M. Iwatsubo M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 57: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) as shown in Scheme FS1, whereK d is the dissociation constant for the formation of the reversible Michaelis complex (PBP/I), k 2 is the first-order rate constant for acylation of PBP or the formation of an ester bond between an active site serine of PBP and the carbonyl carbon of the β-lactam, and k 3 is the rate constant for deacylation of PBP-I to generate free PBP and the hydrolyzed β-lactam (I*). Such interaction is essentially a single turnover process because the step of deacylation is extremely slow (k 3 ≪ k 2), andk -2 is virtually zero because of the covalent bond formation and the resultant irreversible β-lactam ring opening. Kinetic evidence for this mechanism and kinetic constants for the individual steps have been obtained for low molecular mass, nonessential PBPs such as Streptomyces R61 DD-carboxypeptidase (13Frère J.M. Ghuysen J.-M. Iwatsubo M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 57: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The first HMM PBP studied in such detail was β-lactam-resistant PBP2a from methicillin-resistantStaphylococcus aureus (16Lu W.-P. Sun Y. Bauer M. Paule S. Koenigs P. Kraft W.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 20: 6537-6546Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In that study, an electrospray mass spectrometry (ESMS) method was developed to quantitatively determine acyl-PBP adducts formed (16Lu W.-P. Sun Y. Bauer M. Paule S. Koenigs P. Kraft W.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 20: 6537-6546Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Combined with a fast reaction technique (quench flow), this method allowed us to determine the mechanism and the individual kinetic constants. Early on kinetic studies were carried out with HMM PBP2x and PBP2x variants fromS. pneumoniae by following β-lactam quenching of the intrinsic fluorescence of the PBPs (17Jamin M. Damblon C. Millier S. Hakenbeck R. Frère J.M. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 18Mouz N. Gordon E. Di Guilmi A.M. Petit I. Petillot Y. Dupont Y. Hakenbeck R. Vernet T.

Chem. 1999; 274: 19175-19180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The combined values ofk 2/K d were derived, but the individual parameters were not resolved. In the work presented here, we characterized interactions of the normal or penicillin-sensitive PBP2x with pen-G and cefotaxime and determined the individual kinetic constants for the PBP. We also studied a penicillin-resistant PBP2x (PBP2xR) from S. pneumoniae strain CS109, a clinical isolate showing high level resistance not only to penicillins but also to almost all cephalosporin antibiotics including the extended-spectrum cephalosporins such as cefotaxime (20Asahi Y. Takeuchi Y. Ubukata K. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 1252-1255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Coffey T.J. Daniels M. McDougal L.K. Dowson C.G. Tenover F.C. Spratt B.G. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 1306-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In these comparative studies, we wanted to understand not only the extent of the reduction of overall β-lactam affinity to the resistant PBP2x but also the degree to which each one of the three reaction steps was affected. The implications of these findings in terms of the mechanisms of β-lactam action and resistance and the role of each step in resistance development are discussed. Chromosomal DNA ofS. pneumoniae strain CS109 (Serotype 23) obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was prepared as described previously (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed., Unit 2.4.1–2.4.2. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) except that the cells were grown on a tryptic soy agar plate with 5% blood under 5% CO2. This DNA was used as the template for PCR. Based on the published PBP2xRsequence (21Coffey T.J. Daniels M. McDougal L.K. Dowson C.G. Tenover F.C. Spratt B.G. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 1306-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), a forward primer (5′-CATGCCATGGGGACAGGCACTCGCTTTGGA-3′) with anNcoI restriction site (underlined) and a backward primer (5′-TGGGAAGCTTGTCACAATTCCAGCACTG-3′) corresponding to the C terminus of PBP2x with a HindIII restriction site (underlined) added were used to amplify the gene by PCR. In the forward primer, the NcoI restriction site was introduced before codon Gly49, resulting in the PBP2x coding for a truncated PBP2xR of which the first 48 amino acids at the N terminus, including a 19-amino acid region coding for the membrane-spanning segment, were deleted. The PCR reaction mixture contained 0.8 µm each of the primers, 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 0.2 mm of each dNTP, 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 0.15 mm MgCl2, and the template (2 µl) in a final volume of 100 µl and was subjected to 30 cycles of PCR amplification (95 °C, 2 min; 60 °C, 1 min; 72 °C, 1 min) using a Hot Start technique (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The resultant PCR fragment was ligated into the pCR2.1 vector using T4 DNA ligase (TA Cloning Kit, Invitrogen). This construct was transformed into TOP10F′ competent cells (Invitrogen), and colonies were selected for analysis based on their appearance on X-Gal plates. Plasmid DNA was isolated from the cell using the Qiagen miniprep procedure. The pCR2.1 vector hasBamHI and EcoRV restriction sites contained within the multiple cloning region that flank the insert. The plasmid DNA was digested with these enzymes and fractionated on a 1% agarose gel. A 2-kilobase band was excised and gel-purified. This DNA was then digested with NcoI and HindIII. T4 ligase was used to ligate the product into PET24-d, an expression vector (Novagen) that had been digested with the same restriction enzymes. The PBP2xR in the resultant vector (pPB52-10 (30Chambers H.F. Sachdeva M.J. Hackbarth C.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar)) was sequenced in-house. The plasmid pPB52-10 (30Chambers H.F. Sachdeva M.J. Hackbarth C.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) was transformed into E. coliexpression strain BL21/DE3 (Novagen) following the manufacturer's protocol. The conditions for culture growth and induction were basically according to the instruction of Novagen. LB medium containing 30 µg/ml kanamycin was inoculated with an inoculum culture, and the cells were grown in a shaker at 37 °C until theA 600 reached ∼1. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at a final concentration of 1 mm was added into the culture to induce expression. Three hours later the culture was harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The cells were then washed once and suspended in 50 mmTris/HCl buffer, pH 8. For large scale culture, six 4-liter flasks each containing 2 liters of medium were used. A three-step purification protocol, different from the published procedures (17Jamin M. Damblon C. Millier S. Hakenbeck R. Frère J.M. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 23Zhao G. Yeh W.K. Carnahan R.H. Flokowitsch J. Meier T.I. Alborn Jr., W.E. Becker G.W. Jaskunas S.R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4901-4908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was developed that offered the advantages of large scale, high yield, and efficiency. All operations were performed on a fast protein liquid chromatography purification system (Pharmacia) at 4 °C. Cell-free extract was prepared by sonication of the cells for ∼10 min at maximum output using a 550 Sonic Dismembrator (Fisher) followed by centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 45 min. The resultant cell-free extract (∼3 g of protein) was loaded onto a Q-Sepharose HP (Pharmacia) column (5 × 10 cm) at 10 ml/min that had been equilibrated with Buffer A (10 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8). The column was then washed with ∼200 ml of Buffer A followed by elution with a linear gradient of 0–1 m NaCl in Buffer A at ∼10 ml/min. PBP2xR eluted at ∼0.5 m NaCl as judged by SDS-PAGE. The fractions (0.4–0.6 m NaCl) containing PBP2xR were combined. The combined solution was brought into 1 m (NH4)2SO4 and loaded onto a phenyl-Sepharose column (5 × 7 cm), which had been equilibrated with 1 m(NH4)2SO4 in Buffer A. The column was then eluted with a linear gradient of 1-0 m(NH4)2SO4 in Buffer A. PBP2xR eluted around 0.5 m(NH4)2SO4. The protein was pooled and concentrated to ∼50 mg/ml with Amicon Centriprep (cut-off 30 kDa) tubes or an Amicon centrifiltration cell. The resultant protein preparation was loaded on a Superdex 75 column (5 × 75 cm, Pharmacia), which had been equilibrated with Buffer A containing 0.2m NaCl, and then eluted with the same buffer at 1.0 ml/min. The fractions at ∼450–520 ml containing purified PBP2xRwere pooled and concentrated. Occasionally some portion (up to 20%) of the protein was purified as a dimer, which eluted earlier on the Superdex column than the major protein peak. The dimer form of the protein showed the same molecular weight as did the monomer determined by mass spectrometry or by SDS-PAGE. However, its acylation rate by pen-G decreased ∼80%, although it still could be fully acylated. This indicates that denaturation can occur with the recombinant PBP protein during the expression or the purification, and one should always check the kinetic activity of a preparation to ensure that it is fully active. E. colistrain Sure DH5α harboring plasmid pCG31 encoding PBP2x from S. pneumoniae R6 (24Laible G. Keck W. Lurz R. Mottl H. Frere J.M. Jamin M. Hakenbeck R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 943-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) (kindly supplied by Professor R. Hakenbeck) was used to express the protein according to the published method (24Laible G. Keck W. Lurz R. Mottl H. Frere J.M. Jamin M. Hakenbeck R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 943-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The protein was purified by a newly developed four-step procedure similar to that above for PBP2xR except that PBP2x was eluted out at around 0.8 m(NH4)2SO4 in the step of phenyl-Sepharose chromatography. In addition, another step of cation exchange chromatography on a SP-Sepharose column (5 × 10 cm) was inserted between the step of phenyl-Sepharose chromatography and the last step of gel filtration. The protein solution collected from the (NH4)2SO4 gradient was diluted ∼15-fold with Buffer A before loading on the SP-Sepharose column, which had been equilibrated with Buffer A. The column was then eluted with a linear gradient of 0–1 m NaCl in ∼900 ml of Buffer A at 7 ml/min. The protein fractions were pooled and concentrated to ∼50 mg/ml before loading on the Superdex 75 gel filtration column. For kinetic studies of the binding of a β-lactam to PBP2xR, a typical reaction mixture contained the β-lactam and ∼10–15 µg of PBP in a final volume of 20 µl of 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 50 mm NaCl (Buffer B). The reaction was carried out at 37 °C and terminated at various time intervals by adding 5 µl of 5% HCOOH before the sample was analyzed by ESMS as described below. When high concentrations (>0.5 mm) of a β-lactam were used, a larger volume (∼100 µl) of 1% HCOOH was used to stop the reaction and to dilute the β-lactam. The mixture was then transferred to an Amicon Microcon 30 tube and centrifuged at ∼10,000 ×g for ∼5 min at room temperature to concentrate the protein sample and to remove the excess β-lactam, which interfered with the subsequent ESMS measurement. After the recovery centrifugation, the protein solution was collected, and its volume was adjusted to ∼25 µl with 1% HCOOH before analysis by ESMS. All samples of PBP2x acylation were prepared by a quench flow method using a KinTek quench flow apparatus as described previously (16Lu W.-P. Sun Y. Bauer M. Paule S. Koenigs P. Kraft W.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 20: 6537-6546Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar) because of the extremely fast acylation reaction of the PBP. This method was performed to prepare PBP2xR samples when pen-G or cefotaxime concentrations were 0.2 mm or above for which the rates (k a) of the acylation reached ∼0.02 s−1 or higher (under these conditions, the reactions of initial data points had to be terminated within 15 s). Typically PBP (25 µg in 20 µl of Buffer B) and a β-lactam (various concentrations in 20 µl of Buffer B) were loaded in the two tubing loops. The reactions were started by rapidly mixing the two reactants from the two tubing loops for time intervals ranging from 5 ms to 15 s followed by quenching with 3% HCOOH (final concentration), which brought the pH of the mixture to below 2. The collected reaction mixtures (∼150 µl) were then concentrated in Amicon Microcon 30 tubes as described above. Acyl-PBP2x complexes were prepared by first incubating PBP2x (∼10 mg/ml) with 50 µm pen-G or cefotaxime for ∼5 min or PBP2xR (∼10–20 mg/ml) with 0.5 mm pen-G or cefotaxime for ∼30 min at room temperature to completely acylate the PBPs. All the reactions were performed in Buffer B (50 mm phosphate, pH 7.2, with 50 mm NaCl) in a final reaction volume of 50–200 µl. The next step was to remove the unbound β-lactam from the reaction mixtures by one of the following two separation methods. In the first method, this was done by centrifugation/washing three times with 3 × 1 ml of Buffer B in an Amicon Microcon 30 filtration tube. Each centrifugation was performed at ∼11,000 × g for ∼15 min at 4 °C. This procedure lasted a total of ∼40 min. The second method was the so-called “spun column” method essentially as described previously (25Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2891-2899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Lu W-P. Harder S.R. Ragsdale S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3124-3133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this method, a predried spun column was made by adding ∼600 µl of Sephadex-G50 equilibrated in Buffer B into a column made using a 1-ml syringe followed by centrifugation in a swinging bucket benchtop IEC clinical centrifuge at ∼800 × g for 1 min. The above reaction mixture (∼100 µl) of a PBP incubated with a β-lactam was loaded onto the column immediately after the acylation reaction was complete followed by centrifugation at the same speed for 1 min. The effluent containing the PBP with bound β-lactam was collected, and small molecules including the free β-lactam remained bound on the Sephadex-G50 gel. The obtained acyl-PBP preparations (∼10–20 mg/ml) were stored at −20 °C before using. For the deacylation reaction, the acyl-PBP2xR or -PBP2x preparations, diluted in Buffer B to ∼1 mg/ml, were incubated at 37 °C. At various time intervals an aliquot (20 µl) of the sample was removed and mixed with 5 µl of 5% HCOOH to stop the reaction. The percentage of PBP remaining acylated for each sample was then determined by ESMS analysis. The ESMS analysis was essentially as detailed previously (16Lu W.-P. Sun Y. Bauer M. Paule S. Koenigs P. Kraft W.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 20: 6537-6546Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). An on line HPLC-ESMS system consisting of a perfusion capillary column (0.3 × 50 mm, poros RII/H, LC Packings, San Francisco, CA) and an electrospray mass spectrometer (Sciex API-III LC/MS/MS triple quadrupole instrument, PE Sciex, Ontario, Canada) was used to determine the ratio of acyl-PBP and free PBP. The mass spectrometer scanned over a mass range of 700–1700 atomic mass units using a 1.0-ms dwell time and 0.4-atomic mass unit step size. The system offers the advantages of sensitivity (using 5–20 µg of protein), speed (∼8 min of total running time), and accuracy (a typical mass precision of better than 0.01%). The quantitative calculation of percentage of PBP acylated from the data determined by ESMS was as described previously (16Lu W.-P. Sun Y. Bauer M. Paule S. Koenigs P. Kraft W.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 20: 6537-6546Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The equations used for resolving the mechanism and the kinetic parameters of Scheme FS1 were essentially as described previously (13Frère J.M. Ghuysen J.-M. Iwatsubo M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 57: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 14Ghuysen J.-M. Frère J.M. Leyh-Bouille M. Nguyen-Distèche M. Coyette J. Biochem. J. 1986; 235: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 16Lu W.-P. Sun Y. Bauer M. Paule S. Koenigs P. Kraft W.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 20: 6537-6546Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The kinetics of the formation of acyl-PBP at a given β-lactam (I) concentration is given by Equation 1 of exponential rise: [PBP-I]t/[PBP]total = 1 − exp(−k a t). Herek a is the apparent first-order rate constant and [PBP-I]t/[PBP]total is the ratio of acyl-PBP to total PBP or the percentage of PBP acylated, derived from the ESMS determination, at time t. In practice,k a was obtained by computer fitting (SigmaPlot) experimental data to Equation 1 using nonlinear least squares analysis. Based on Scheme FS1 and k 2 ≫k 3, k a is related toK d and k 2 according to Equation 2: k a =k 2[I]/(K d + [I]). Thus, if a plot of k a versus [I] follows a hyperbolic curve, the reaction can be best described by the mechanism represented by Scheme FS1, and the related constantsk a and K d can then be derived by computer fitting of the data of k a versus[I] to Equation 2. Under the condition of [I] ≪K d, Equation 2 simplifies to Equation 2-1:k a =k 2[I]/K d from which the combined value k 2/K d can also be calculated. Because thisk 2/K d value was generated from a single determined point, it would be an approximate value not as accurate as that obtained with Equation 2. The first-order deacylation rate constant k 3 for the third step of Scheme FS1is described by Equation 3: [PBP-I]t/[PBP]total = exp(−k 3 t), where [PBP-I]t/[PBP]total is the ratio of acyl-PBP to total PBP after incubation of acyl-PBP for timet. Protein concentration was measured by the Bradford method using a Bio-Rad kit with bovine serum albumin (Sigma) as the standard. SDS-PAGE ready gels from Bio-Rad were used to detect the PBPs and to monitor their purity during the purification. Penicillin-G (>99%) and cefotaxime (>99%) were purchased from Fluka. A truncated, soluble form of PBP2xRprotein was cloned, expressed, and purified to homogeneity as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” The protein was expressed inE. coli in soluble form and in large quantity. A purification protocol was developed consisting of three steps: anion exchange chromatography (Q-Sepharose), hydrophobic interaction chromatography (phenyl-Sepharose), and gel filtration (Superdex 75). With this protocol we routinely obtained over 200 mg of PBP2xR with more than 95% purity from ∼3000 mg ofE. coli protein extract. The molecular mass of the purified protein was determined to be 77,080 (±5) Da by ESMS, which is in good agreement with a calculated mass of 77,077 Da for the truncated protein (Gly49–Asp750). This indicates that the cloned gene has the same sequence as that reported (21Coffey T.J. Daniels M. McDougal L.K. Dowson C.G. Tenover F.C. Spratt B.G. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 1306-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Occasionally PBP2xR protein dimer was obtained that could still be 100% acylated by pen-G, but its acylation rate decreased substantially. PBP2xR monomer protein was used throughout this work. PBP2x from S. pneumoniae strain 6R was expressed and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures” to ∼95% purity based on SDS-PAGE. Three protein species with molecular weights of 78,312 Da (75%), 78,426 Da (15%), and 78,154 Da (10%) were determined for the purified protein preparations by ESMS. These values were quite different from the value of 78,981 Da of the truncated PBP2x (Met1–Asp720) according to the sequence of pCG31 (21Coffey T.J. Daniels M. McDougal L.K. Dowson C.G. Tenover F.C. Spratt B.G. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 1306-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). N-terminal amino acid analysis of the PBP2x preparations showed that the protein had been partly digested from the N terminus. Instead of Met1, the major protein species actually started from Arg6 with a calculated molecular mass of 78,306 Da, which is close to the major species determined by ESMS. The values of molecular mass of the two minor species are consistent with the proteins starting from Lys5 and Val7, respectively. Such digestion may have occurred during the E. coli expression of the recombinant protein or during the purification. Similar heterogeneous behavior of molecular mass has been reported for the same PBP2x protein (23Zhao G. Yeh W.K. Carnahan R.H. Flokowitsch J. Meier T.I. Alborn Jr., W.E. Becker G.W. Jaskunas S.R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4901-4908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Upon incubation of the protein with pen-G, all three species increased their molecular mass by 335 Da as determined by ESMS, indicating that all of them were active in binding the β-lactam. The purified PBP2x hydrolyzed thiolester substrates (S2d and S2c) with the same specific activity as that previously reported (17Jamin M. Damblon C. Millier S. Hakenbeck R. Frère J.M. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). A much slower (∼1000-fold) activity for hydrolyzing the two substrates was found for PBP2xR. Upon incubation with pen-G, PBP2xR was acylated as indicated by an increase in molecular mass from 77,078 to 77,412 Da as determined by ESMS (Fig.1A). At a given penicillin concentration (200 µm), the amount or percentage of the PBP2xR-pen-G adduct formed increased with the incubation time (Fig. 1). The data points were fit to Equation 1 from which the apparent rate constant k a was generated (Fig.1 B). With this approach, the time-dependent acylation of PBP2xR was determined at various concentrations of pen-G from 50 µ"

All anticancer drugs tested including VP-16 (a TOP2-directed drug), camptothecin (a topoisomerase I-directed drug), 5-fluorouracil and methotrexate (antimetabolites), and vinblastine (a microtubule inhibitor) induced the same site-specific cleavage within the MLL bcr.

Mapping of the chromosomal breakpoints has revealed that almost all of the breakpoints cluster within an 8.3-kb region known as the breakpoint cluster region (bcr) (1Broeker P.L. Super H.G.

Surprisingly, even the de novo AML have their breakpoints mapped within the same bcr.

However, more recent studies have suggested the involvement of TOP2 in mediating MLL gene translocation based on the following obervations: 1) t-AML with the characteristic MLL gene rearrangement is repeatedly associated with the prior use of TOP2-directed drugs (poisons) (2Felix C.A.

Leukemia. 1995; 9: 1305-1312PubMed Google Scholar), and furthermore, in vitro cleavage using purified TOP2 has mapped TOP2-mediated cleavage sites close to some of the known breakpoints (20Felix C.A. Lange B.J. Hosler M.R. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.A. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4287-4292PubMed Google Scholar); and 3) Strick et al. (21Strick R. Strissel P.L. Borgers S. Smith S.L. Rowley J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4790-4795Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) have shown that, upon treatment with TOP2-directed drugs, the MLL gene is reversibly cleaved within the bcr. Although cleavage of the MLL bcr is suggested to be mediated by TOP2 (21Strick R. Strissel P.L. Borgers S. Smith S.L. Rowley J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4790-4795Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), it has also been suggested to be a generalized cellular response to apoptotic stimuli (22Stanulla M. Wang J. Chervinsky D.S. Thandla S. Aplan P.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4070-4079Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). To determine the enzyme(s) responsible for DNA cleavage, we have characterized site-specific cleavage of the MLL bcr in cell lines treated with different anticancer drugs. We showed that all anticancer drugs induced prominent DNA cleavage within the MLL bcr. However, the slow onset of the double-stranded break within the MLL bcr coincided kinetically with the appearance of the apoptotic nucleosomal DNA ladder rather than the formation of TOP2 cleavable complexes. These DNA double-stranded breaks are not protein-linked, suggesting that a nuclease rather than a topoisomerase is involved. Furthermore, this drug-induced DNA cleavage within the MLL bcr was abolished by co-treatment with the caspase inhibitor, Z-DEVD-FMK. In the aggregate, our results support the notion that the slow onset of the site-specific cleavage within the MLL bcr is probably due to the activation of an apoptotic nuclease. Cell lines CEM, U937, HL-60, HL-60/MX2, and BV173 (a gift from Dr. Francesco Dazzi, Imperial College School of Medicine at Hammjersmith Hospital, London, UK) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine. Camptothecin (CPT) was obtained from Drug Synthesis & Chemistry Branch, NCI. Etoposide (VP-16) was a generous gift from Bristol-Myers Squibb. The caspase inhibitor Z-DEVD-FMK was purchased from Calbiochem. MG132 was purchased from Boston Biochem. 5-Fluorouracil, vinblastine, and methotrexate were purchased from Sigma. [α-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. PROTRAN nitrocellulose membrane was purchased from VWR. Rabbit antisera against hTOP2α and hTOP2β were generous gifts from Dr. Jaulang Hwang (Taiwan). A two-round PCR of 25 cycles each was performed to amplify the last 338 nucleotides of the MLL bcr to be used as the probe in Southern hybridization. Primers MLL7254 5′-AGGTGTGGTGGTGGGCACCTGTAGT-3′ and MLL8342 5′-GGATCCACAGCTCTTACAGCGAACACAC-3′ were used in the first 25 cycles of amplification in a total volume of 50 µl. Two µl of the PCR product was then used as template for the second 25 cycles of amplification using primers MLL8005 5′-CCCTGAGTGCCTGGGACCAAACTAC-3′ and MLL8342. The PCR product was then ligated with the SmaI-linearized vector, pBluescript KS. The resulting plasmid, pKS-MLLp, harboring the 3′-most 338 nucleotides of the bcr, corresponding to nucleotides 8005–8342 of the MLL bcr (GenbankTM accession numberU04737). The cells growing in log phase were treated with various drugs as described in the figure legends. At each time point, the cells were lysed with lysis buffer containing 1% SDS, 20 mm EDTA, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8. The samples were incubated at 50 °C overnight in the presence or the absence of 400 µg/ml proteinase K. Upon extraction with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol, DNA was treated with RNase A at 37 °C for 1 h, and extraction was repeated. Upon ethanol precipitation, the DNA samples were digested withBamHI to produce the 8.3-kb bcr fragment and then analyzed on 1% agarose gel. Southern transfer was performed using the alkaline transfer method (23Reed K.C. Mann D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 7207-7221Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). The MLL probe for Southern hybridization was generated by PCR amplification using primers MLL8005 and MLL8342 and the pKS-MLLp template. This probe hybridizes to the 3′-most 338 nucleotides of the bcr. Overnight hybridization was performed at 65 °C in 1 mm EDTA, 7% SDS, and 0.25 mNa2HPO4, pH 7.2. The filter was washed once in 1 mm EDTA, 5% SDS, and 20 mmNa2HPO4, pH 7.2, and twice in 1 mmEDTA, 1% SDS, and 20 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.2, prior to autoradiography. The cells treated with 100 µm of VP-16 for various time were lysed in 2× SDS sample loading buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 30% sucrose, 4 mm EDTA, 6% SDS, 0.02% bromphenol blue, and 10% β-mercaptoethanol). After boiling for 10 min, the samples were analyzed on 5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to PROTRAN nitrocellulose membrane. Immunoblotting was performed with anti-hTOP2α and anti-hTOP2β antibodies as described before (24Desai S.D. Liu L.F. Vazquez-Abad D. D'Arpa P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24159-24164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Cleavage within the MLL bcr in cells treated with various anticancer drugs was determined by using an indirect end labeling method (see Fig. 1Afor the probe used in Southern hybridization). As shown in Fig. 1 (Fig.1, see the right panels in B–D), a number of anticancer drugs including VP-16, CPT, vinblastine, 5-fluorouracil, and methotrexate induced DNA cleavage within the MLL bcr (the 8.3-kb bcr fragment is indicated by arrow a, and the 1.5-kb DNA fragment is indicated by arrow b). The appearance of the 1.5-kb DNA fragment is indicative of DNA cleavage within the MLL bcr (Fig. 1 A). The cells treated with various anticancer drugs were also monitored for the formation of apoptotic nucleosomal DNA ladder (Fig. 1, left panels in B–D). In each case, the appearance of the 1.5-kb DNA fragment is paralleled by the formation of nucleosomal DNA ladders (Fig. 1). The time course of the formation of the 1.5-kb DNA fragment was monitored in various cells treated with the TOP2-directed anticancer drug, VP-16. As shown in Fig.2, the formation of the 1.5-kb DNA fragment was kinetically slow. No visible cleavage was observed within 1 h of VP-16 treatment. The formation of the 1.5-kb DNA fragment was observed only after 2–3 h of VP-16 treatment (Fig. 2,A–C). The slow formation of the 1.5-kb DNA fragment contrasted with the rapid formation of TOP2-DNA covalent complexes, which was monitored by a band depletion assay (Fig. 2 D). Within 10 min of VP-16 treatment, the band intensities of TOP2α and TOP2β were reduced more than 50%. Prolonged treatment up to 120 min did not result in further change of the band intensities, consistent with the previous results that the formation of TOP2-DNA covalent complexes is rapid (25Yang L. Rowe T.C. Liu L.F. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 5872-5876PubMed Google Scholar, 26Chen G.L. Yang L. Rowe T.C. Halligan B.D. Tewey K.M. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13560-13566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that the formation of the 1.5-kb DNA fragment may not be the direct result of the formation of TOP2-DNA covalent complexes. TOP2-DNA covalent (cleavable) complexes are characterized by both reversibility at higher temperatures such as 65 °C (27Hsiang Y.H. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9713-9715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and protein-DNA cross-links (25Yang L. Rowe T.C. Liu L.F. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 5872-5876PubMed Google Scholar, 26Chen G.L. Yang L. Rowe T.C. Halligan B.D. Tewey K.M. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13560-13566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether this drug-induced slow DNA cleavage within the MLL bcr is mediated by TOP2, we have examined these two unique properties associated with the formation of TOP2-DNA covalent complexes. To test the reversibility of DNA cleavage within the MLL bcr, BV173 cells were treated with 100 µmof VP-16 for various times. At each time point, the cells were either lysed immediately or incubated at 65 °C for 10 min prior to lysis. As shown in Fig. 3A, site-specific DNA cleavage within the MLL bcr, as evidenced by the formation of the 1.5-kb cleavage product (see bandsindicated by arrow b), was induced at 3 and 6 h of VP-16 treatment. Brief heating to 65 °C for 10 min prior to lysis had no detectable effect on the formation of the 1.5-kb DNA fragment (compare lanes 3 and 4 with lanes 10and 11, respectively), suggesting that DNA cleavage within the MLL bcr is not mediated by TOP2. Another characteristic of TOP2-mediated DNA cleavage is the formation of covalent TOP2-DNA cross-links (25Yang L. Rowe T.C. Liu L.F. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 5872-5876PubMed Google Scholar, 26Chen G.L. Yang L. Rowe T.C. Halligan B.D. Tewey K.M. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13560-13566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have performed the following experiment to test the possible covalent association of protein with the cleaved DNA fragments. BV173 cells treated with VP-16 were lysed at various times. The cell lysates were incubated at 50 °C overnight in the presence or the absence of proteinase K. Extraction with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol was then performed, and genomic DNA was extracted. Without proteinase K digestion, TOP2-mediated DNA cleavage products, which are protein-associated, are expected to be lost (in the interphase) during extraction. With proteinase K digestion, TOP2-mediated DNA products are expected to be recovered in the aqueous phase during extraction. As shown in Fig.3 A, DNA cleavage within the MLL bcr, as evidenced by the formation of the 1.5-kb DNA fragment, was induced at 3 and 6 h of VP-16 treatment (lanes 3 and 4). The formation of this DNA cleavage product was not affected by proteinase K digestion (Fig. 3 A, lanes 7 and 8), suggesting that the fragment was not protein-linked. The absence of protein-DNA cross-links in the DNA cleavage products cannot completely rule out the possibility of TOP2-mediated DNA cleavage within the MLL bcr. TOP2 can be degraded by the ubiquitin/26 S proteasome pathway in cells treated with TOP2-directed drugs such as VP-16. 2M. Yong, S. D. Desai, J. Hwang, C.-Y. Ting, and L. F. Liu, unpublished results. To test whether TOP2 had been degraded by the ubiquitin/26 S proteasome pathway, the proteasome inhibitor, MG132, was used to block this degradative pathway. The cells were pretreated with 1 µm of MG132 for 1 h followed by co-treatment with 100 µm of VP-16. DNA was extracted in the presence and the absence of proteinase K as described above and analyzed by Southern blotting and indirect end labeling. As shown in Fig. 3 B, the formation of the 1.5-kb DNA fragment was not affected by MG132 with or without proteinase K treatment (compare lanes 2 and 3 with lanes 5 and 6, respectively). Again, this result is consistent with the notion that DNA cleavage within the MLL bcr is mediated by a nuclease but not TOP2. Another stringent test for the possible involvement of TOP2 in DNA cleavage within the MLL bcr is the use of TOP2-deficient cell lines. HL-60/MX2 is a cell line derived from HL-60 after selection for resistance to mitoxantrone (28Harker W.G. Slade D.L. Dalton W.S. Meltzer P.S. Trent J.M. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4542-4549PubMed Google Scholar, 29Tewey K.M. Rowe T.C. Yang L. Halligan B.D. Liu L.F. Science. 1984; 226: 466-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar). It has undetectable TOP2β and a reduced level of nuclear TOP2α (30Harker W.G. Slade D.L. Parr R.L. Feldhoff P.W. Sullivan D.M. Holguin M.H. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1707-1716PubMed Google Scholar). 3S.-P. Sim and L. F. Liu, unpublished data. As shown in Fig. 4, the time course of the formation of the 1.5-kb cleavage product was about the same in HL-60 and HL-60/MX2 cells treated with CPT, suggesting that TOP2 is unlikely to be responsible for the formation of the 1.5-kb cleavage product. As a control, the formation of the 1.5-kb cleavage product was shown to be significantly delayed in HL-60/MX2 cells as compared with HL-60 cells treated with TOP2-directed drug, VP-16 (Fig.4), reflecting the reduction of TOP2-mediated DNA damage in HL-60/MX2 cells. These results suggest that TOP2-mediated DNA damage can lead to the formation of the 1.5-kb cleavage product but that TOP2 is not directly responsible for this slow cleavage event. K562 cells have been reported to exhibit delayed induction of apoptosis by various agents including VP-16 as compared with HL-60 cells (31Martins L.M. Mesner P.W. Kottke T.J. Basi G.S. Sinha S. Tung J.S. Svingen P.A. Madden B.J. Takahashi A. McCormick D.J. Earnshaw W.C. Kaufmann S.H. Blood. 1997; 90: 4283-4296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.5A, the nucleosomal DNA ladders, which are characteristics of apoptotic cell death, were prominently induced in HL-60 but not K562 cells after 4 h of treatment with either VP-16 or CPT. The formation of these nucleosomal DNA ladders has been attributed to the activation of the apoptotic nuclease CAD (32Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1424) Google Scholar, 33Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2807) Google Scholar). Our studies have suggested that DNA cleavage within the MLL bcr is not TOP2-mediated but correlated with the appearance of the nucleosomal DNA ladders. Consequently, we have tested whether the formation of the 1.5-kb DNA cleavage product is correlated with the appearance of the nucleosomal DNA ladders in K562 and HL-60 cells. As shown in Fig. 5 B, the 1.5-kb DNA cleavage product was prominently induced in HL-60 but not K562 cells after 4 h of treatment with either VP-16 or CPT (compare lanes 2 and3 with lanes 5 and 6, respectively), suggesting that the DNA cleavage within the MLL bcr may be mediated by an apoptotic nuclease. It should be noted that the cellular TOP2 levels in both HL-60 and K562 cells have been shown to be similar (31Martins L.M. Mesner P.W. Kottke T.J. Basi G.S. Sinha S. Tung J.S. Svingen P.A. Madden B.J. Takahashi A. McCormick D.J. Earnshaw W.C. Kaufmann S.H. Blood. 1997; 90: 4283-4296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the amounts of VP-16-induced TOP2-linked DNA breaks in both HL60 and K562 cells are comparable (31Martins L.M. Mesner P.W. Kottke T.J. Basi G.S. Sinha S. Tung J.S. Svingen P.A. Madden B.J. Takahashi A. McCormick D.J. Earnshaw W.C. Kaufmann S.H. Blood. 1997; 90: 4283-4296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The most likely candidate nuclease is the CAD that has been shown to be responsible for the nucleosomal DNA ladder formation (32Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1424) Google Scholar, 33Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2807) Google Scholar). To test this possibility, Z-DEVD-FMK, a known cell-permeable and irreversible caspase 3 inhibitor, which also inhibits caspases 6, 7, 8, and 10 (34Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6159) Google Scholar, 35Masuda Y. Nakaya M. Nakajo S. Nakaya K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 641-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) was used. BV173 cells were pretreated for 1 h with 50 µm of Z-DEVD-FMK, followed by co-treatment with VP-16 for 3 h. As shown in Fig. 6, the formation of the nucleosomal DNA ladder induced by VP-16 was completely abolished by Z-DEVD-FMK (Fig. 6 A, compare lanes 2and 4). The formation of the 1.5-kb cleavage product, which is indicative of DNA breakage within the MLL bcr, was concomitantly abolished upon Z-DEVD-FMK treatment (Fig. 6 B, comparelanes 2 and 4). Previous studies have suggested that TOP2 may be responsible for the MLL gene rearrangement in patients with t-AML. This is primarily based on the observation of Strick et al. (21Strick R. Strissel P.L. Borgers S. Smith S.L. Rowley J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4790-4795Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) that TOP2 is responsible for DNA cleavage within the MLL bcr in cells treated with TOP2-directed drugs. Our current studies, on the other hand, have indicated that an apoptotic nuclease is involved in DNA cleavage within the MLL bcr despite that both studies are conducted using the same cell line (BV173) and the same TOP2 poison, VP-16. Our results, which argue against TOP2 being the major “nuclease” for site-specific cleavage within the MLL bcr, are summarized as follows: 1) DNA cleavage within the MLL bcr is observed in cells treated with not only the TOP2 inhibitor VP-16 but also other anticancer drugs including a topoisomerase I inhibitor CPT, antimetabolites such as 5-fluorouracil and methotrexate, and a microtubule inhibitor vinblastine; 2) site-specific DNA cleavage within the MLL bcr is kinetically slower than the formation of TOP2 cleavable complexes; 3) unlike TOP2-mediated DNA cleavage, site-specific cleavage within the MLL bcr is not associated with covalently bound protein, and the possibility that the covalently bound protein is removed by the ubiquitin/26 S proteasome pathway is also ruled out by the use of the 26 S proteasome inhibitor, MG132; 4) unlike TOP2-mediated DNA cleavage, which is highly reversible, site-specific cleavage within the MLL bcr cannot be reversed by incubation at 65 °C (27Hsiang Y.H. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9713-9715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and 5) site-specific DNA cleavage within the MLL bcr is unaffected by nuclear TOP2 levels. We have shown that this cleavage occurs with about the same efficiency in both HL-60 and its TOP2-deficient variant HL-60/MX2 (28Harker W.G. Slade D.L. Dalton W.S. Meltzer P.S. Trent J.M. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4542-4549PubMed Google Scholar). Similar results have been obtained previously in another TOP2 mutant cell line, CEM/VM-1–5 treated with cytosine arabinoside (22Stanulla M.

Although our results argue against TOP2 being responsible for site-specific cleavage within the MLL bcr in transformed cells, we cannot rule out the possibility that TOP2 is the nuclease responsible for site-specific DNA cleavage within the MLL bcr during transformation of hematopoietic stem cells giving rise to t-AML. Our results have also provided evidence supporting the involvement of an apoptotic nuclease in the direct cleavage of the MLL bcr: 1) the appearance of the nucleosomal DNA ladder, which is characteristic of apoptotic cell death, is correlated with the appearance of the 1.5-kb cleavage product, which is indicative of site-specific DNA cleavage within the MLL bcr, and the co-appearance of the apoptotic nucleosomal DNA ladder and the 1.5-kb cleavage product is demonstrated in a variety of conditions including the use of different anticancer drugs and different cell lines; and 2) the caspase inhibitor, Z-DEVD-FMK, was shown to inhibit the formation of the 1.5-kb DNA cleavage product. In the apoptosis process, a family of cysteine proteases, the caspases, are activated to cleave a group of cellular proteins (reviewed in Ref. 36Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4132) Google Scholar) including ICAD. Cleavage of ICAD allows the activation of the nuclease CAD (32Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1424) Google Scholar). CAD has been well established as the enzyme responsible for cleaving the chromatin leading to the formation of high molecular weight and nucleosomal DNA fragments (32Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1424) Google Scholar,33Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2807) Google Scholar). It seems possible that CAD may be responsible for site-specific DNA cleavage within the MLL bcr during high molecular weight DNA fragmentation and more prominently during nucleosomal DNA fragmentation. It is difficult to reconcile the differences between our results and those obtained by Strick et al. (21Strick R. Strissel P.L. Borgers S. Smith S.L. Rowley J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4790-4795Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it is possible that VP-16 may induce a low level of reversible TOP2 cleavable complexes within the MLL bcr. This low level of TOP2 cleavable complexes may have been detected by Strick et al. (21Strick R. Strissel P.L. Borgers S. Smith S.L. Rowley J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4790-4795Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) but missed in our current studies. This initial signal may be followed by activation of the apoptotic nuclease CAD, which leads to more extensive and irreversible cleavage within the MLL bcr, which was detected in the current studies but somehow missed by Strick et al. (21Strick R. Strissel P.L. Borgers S. Smith S.L. Rowley J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4790-4795Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Indeed, previous studies have demonstrated that VP-16 induces TOP2-mediated DNA cleavage at an early time followed by nucleolytic degradation of chromosomal DNA into both high molecular weight and nucleosomal DNA fragments (37Li T.K. Chen A.Y., Yu, C. Mao Y. Wang H. Liu L.F. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1553-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The relevance of the site-specific DNA cleavage within the MLL bcr to MLL gene rearrangement is unclear. However, the location of the cleavage site lies within the telomeric half of the bcr, which is known to be the region undergoing MLL gene rearrangement in t-AML patients (1Broeker P.L. Super H.G. Thirman M.J. Pomykala H. Yonebayashi Y. Tanabe S. Zeleznik-Le N. Rowley J.D. Blood. 1996; 87: 1912-1922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It seems possible that a specific region within the telomeric half of the bcr is highly sensitive to nucleases/topoisomerases such as CAD and TOP2. Depending on the specific conditions, either CAD or TOP2 may be primarily responsible for site-specific cleavage within this region of the bcr. Previous studies have demonstrated that TOP2 can be activated to cleave DNA in the presence of TOP2-directed anticancer drugs as well as under certain cellular stresses such as oxidative stress, thiol stress, and acidic pH (37Li T.K. Chen A.Y., Yu, C. Mao Y. Wang H. Liu L.F. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1553-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar,38Wang H. Mao Y. Chen A.Y. Zhou N. LaVoie E.J. Liu L.F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3316-3323Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). 4H. Xiao, T.-K. Li, and L. F. Liu, unpublished data. A low level of TOP2-mediated DNA cleavage may be sufficient to induce apoptotic cell death resulting in extensive CAD-mediated DNA cleavage within the same region of the bcr. Other apoptotic stimuli (e.g. CPT and other anticancer drugs) may activate CAD to cleave the bcr by mechanisms not involving TOP2. Whether CAD- and TOP2-mediated cleavage within the MLL bcr may result in DNA rearrangements is unknown. However, it has been demonstrated that TOP2-mediated DNA cleavage is highly efficient in mediating DNA sequence rearrangements (39Lim M. Liu L.F. Jacobson-Kram D. Williams J.R. Cell Biol. Toxicol. 1986; 2: 485-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 40Bodley A.L. Huang H.C., Yu, C. Liu L.F. Mol. Cell.

DNA double-stranded breaks resulting from CAD-mediated DNA cleavage are also expected to lead to DNA sequence rearrangements via either homologous recombination or nonhomologous end joining (44Labhart P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 45Sathees C.R. Raman M.J. Mutat. Res. 1999; 433: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 46Jeggo P.A. Radiat.

Ikeda H. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Although the majority of patients with the MLL gene translocation have previously been treated with TOP2-directed drugs, there are cases where MLL gene translocations were observed without prior treatment with TOP2-targeting drugs (20Felix C.A. Lange B.J. Hosler M.R. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.A. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4287-4292PubMed Google Scholar, 50Kubota M. Hoshino Y. Doi H. Ueno H. Nishida Y. Hirota H. Akiyama Y. Acta Haematol. 1994; 92: 33-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Thus, nuclease-mediated cleavage of the MLL bcr could be relevant in MLL gene rearrangement. Clearly, further studies are necessary to establish the roles of the enzymes involved in site-specific DNA cleavage within the MLL bcr and MLL gene rearrangements. We are grateful to Dr. Jaulang Hwang and Dr. Francesco Dazzi for providing us with antibodies against TOP2 isozymes and the cell line BV173, respectively."

In primates, this function is served by complement receptor 1 (CR1) on erythrocytes. In contrast, rodent platelets bear IAR distinct from CR1, the identity of which was studied here. A 150-kDa C3b-binding protein was isolated from rat platelets, which had immunochemical and biochemical identity to plasma factor H. Immunofluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry demonstrated that factor H was present on the surface of rat and mouse platelets, which could be removed by treatment with neuraminidase. Sheep erythrocytes bearing C3b underwent immune adherence with rat and mouse platelets, which was blocked with anti-factor H F(ab′)2 antibodies, but not with antibodies binding to the complement regulator, Crry, on the platelet surface. By reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using rat platelet RNA and primers designed from mouse factor H, a 472-base pair product was generated that was identical in sequence to that produced from rat liver RNA. The translated protein product was 85% similar to mouse liver factor H. The 3′-nucleotide sequence from platelets predicted a soluble factor H protein. By Northern analysis, liver and platelets had identically sized factor H mRNA.

Rich R. Principles and Practices of Clinical Immunology. Mosby, St. Louis, MO1995: 363-391Google Scholar). These proteins cause the rapid destruction of invading microorganisms and mediate the solubilization and clearance of immune complexes. Immune complexes bearing the activated complement component C3b bind to cells with specific membrane receptors, which transport them to the mononuclear phagocyte system in the liver and spleen. This phenomenon is called immune adherence (IA)1 (2Nelson Jr., R.N. Science. 1953; 118: 733-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 3Nelson D.S. Adv. Immunol. 1963; 3: 131-180Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and is responsible for the disposal of immune complexes from the body (4Schifferli J.A. Taylor R.P. Kidney Int. 1989; 35: 993-1003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 5Hebert L.A. Am. J. Kidney Dis. 1991; 27: 352-361Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The in vitro correlate of this is rosetting of IAR-bearing cells with C3b-containing particles (3Nelson D.S. Adv. Immunol. 1963; 3: 131-180Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 6Okuda T. Takahashi K. Tachibana T. Dev. Comp. Immunol. 1984; 8: 461-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The IAR of primates is CR1, which is present on erythrocytes (7Fearon D.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 5867-5871Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). In addition to erythrocytes, CR1 is also present on blood cells, including monocytes, lymphocytes, neutrophils, and eosinophils and resident cells such as podocytes in the renal glomerulus, follicular dendritic cells in lymphoid organs and astrocytes in the brain (8Ahearn J.M. Fearon D.T. Adv. Immunol. 1989; 46: 183-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 9Kazatchkine M.D. Fearon D.T. Appay M.D. Mandet C. Bariety J. J. Clin.

CR1 is a member of the regulators of complement activation gene cluster located on chromosome 1q32, all of which have ligand specificity for activation products of C3 and/or C4 and contain repetitive units known as short consensus repeats (SCRs) (11Campbell R.D. Law S.K.A. Reid K.B.M. Sim R.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1988; 6: 161-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 12Hourcade D. Holers V.M. Atkinson J.P. Adv. Immunol. 1989; 45: 381-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). In contrast, IA function in non-primates, including rodents, is not served by erythrocytes, but rather by platelets bearing an undefined IAR (13Henson P.M. Immunology. 1969; 16: 107-121PubMed Google Scholar,14Taylor R.P. Kujala G. Wilson K. Wright E. Harbin A. J. Immunol. 1985; 134: 2550-2558PubMed Google Scholar). Several attempts have been made to identify this non-primate IAR. Mouse platelets form rosettes with C3b-containing erythrocytes, which can be disrupted by incubating cells with factor I (15Kinoshita T. Lavoie S. Nussenzweig V. J. Immunol. 1985; 134: 2564-2570PubMed Google Scholar), implying that the IAR provides factor I cofactor activity. The obvious candidate for this is mouse CR1; yet, CR1 is clearly absent from mouse platelets, as well as erythrocytes and unstimulated neutrophils (16Kinoshita T. Takeda J. Hong K. Kozono H. Sakai H. Inoue K. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 3066-3072PubMed Google Scholar). A 150-kDa C3b/iC3-binding protein isolated from rabbit platelets was absent on rabbit erythrocytes, but was not characterized further (17Manthei U. Nickells M.W. Barnes S.H. Ballard L.L. Cui W.Y. Atkinson J.P. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 1228-1235PubMed Google Scholar). In our previous studies (18Quigg R.J. Holers V.M. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1481-1488PubMed Google Scholar, 19Quigg R.J. Alexander J.J. Lo C.F. Lim A. He C. Holers V.M. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 2438-2444PubMed Google Scholar), we identified rodent platelet proteins that bound C3 fragments and hence were candidates similar to the IAR. However, at that time, we could only characterize them on the basis of their size and reactivities with available antibodies to mouse CR1 and CR2. The purpose of this study was to identify the rodent platelet IAR. By functional, biochemical, immunochemical, and molecular biological approaches, we conclusively show rodent platelets can produce and bear a protein with characteristics of factor H, a member of the regulators of complement activation family. This platelet-associated factor H functions as the IAR. Goat anti-human factor H was purchased from Quidel (San Diego, CA), and cross-reacts with mouse and rat factor H (see below), which is not surprising given that factor H is highly conserved among species (20Kristensen T. Tack B.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3963-3967Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Sheep Abs were raised to rat rCrry (21He C. Alexander J.J. Lim A. Quigg R.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 341: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and rDAF (22Hinchliffe S.J. Spiller O.B. Rushmere N.K. Morgan B.P. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5695-5703PubMed Google Scholar) (a gift of Dr. B. Paul Morgan, University of Wales College of Medicine, Cardiff). Rabbit anti-mouse rCrry was supplied by Dr. V. Michael Holers (23Li B. Sallee C. Dehoff M. Foley S. Molina H. Holers V.M. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 4295-4305PubMed Google Scholar) (University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver). A goat anti-rat thrombocyte Ab was purchased from Accurate Scientific (Westfield, NY). Although rodent platelets are known to not bear Fc receptors (24McKenzie S.E. Taylor S.M. Malladi P. Yuhan H. Cassel D.L. Chien P. Schwartz E. Schreiber A.D. Surrey S. Reilly M.P. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 4311-4318PubMed Google Scholar), all experiments were performed with F(ab′)2 Ab fragments, which were prepared by standard techniques (25Schiller B. He C. Salant D.J. Lim A. Alexander J.J. Quigg R.J. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1353-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The purification of rat and mouse C3 from plasma have been described previously (19Quigg R.J. Alexander J.J. Lo C.F. Lim A. He C. Holers V.M. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 2438-2444PubMed Google Scholar, 26Quigg R.J. Galishoff M.L. Sneed A.E. Kim D. Kidney Int. 1993; 43: 730-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In brief, rat C3 was purified by a 5–11% polyethylene glycol precipitation followed by Mono Q anion-exchange chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A similar technique was used to purify mouse C3, except that a 5–10% polyethylene precipitation was used, and following Mono Q chromatography, size exclusion chromatography on Sephacryl S-300 HR was performed. The preparations were noted as pure with SDS-PAGE. Outbred Harlan Sprague Dawley rats and CD1 mice used for the isolation of blood and tissue were obtained from Harlan Bioproducts for Science (Indianapolis, IN). Mice with targeted deletion of CR1 have been generated previously, which have been backcrossed over 7 generations onto the C57BL/6 strain (27Molina H. Kinoshita T. Inoue K. Carel J.C. Holers V.M. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 2974-2983PubMed Google Scholar). Normal C57BL/6 mice were used as wild-type controls for CR1−/− mice. The animals were maintained and experiments performed in accordance with the guidelines set by the University of Chicago Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Platelets were isolated as described earlier (18Quigg R.J. Holers V.M. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1481-1488PubMed Google Scholar, 19Quigg R.J. Alexander J.J. Lo C.F. Lim A. He C. Holers V.M. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 2438-2444PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, blood was drawn by cardiac puncture from rats or mice into plastic syringes containing phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.02 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2) with 0.086 m EDTA. The blood was centrifuged at 300 × g for 20 min at room temperature. The top two-thirds of the supernatant was transferred into fresh tubes and further centrifuged at 2000 × g for 10 min at room temperature. The pellet was washed and suspended in PBS. By light microscopy, the preparation was >99% pure and viable by virtue of trypan blue exclusion. C3b was generated by trypsinization of C3 and bound via its free sulfhydryl group to thiopropyl-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Platelet membranes were solubilized with PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm iodoacetamide, and 5 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate (Sigma Aldrich). Solubilized platelet proteins were diluted to 0.05 m NaCl and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and subsequently loaded on the C3b-Sepharose column. The column was washed with 10-column volumes of 0.05 m NaCl, 0.01 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and the specifically bound proteins were eluted with 0.5 mNaCl, 0.01 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Collected fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE. 40 mg of anti-factor H IgG was completely bound to 5 ml of CNBr-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by standard techniques (28Quigg R.J. He C. Alexander J.J. Morgan B.P. Immunology. 2000; 99: 46-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Rat plasma was brought to 0.5 m NaCl and loaded onto the column. After washing with 10-column volumes of 0.5 m NaCl, 0.02 msodium phosphate, pH 7.2, factor H was eluted from the column with 0.1m glycine-HCl, pH 2.5. 1-ml fractions were collected into tubes containing 50 µl of 1 m Tris base to immediately neutralize the pH. Proteins recovered by C3b affinity chromatography were separated by SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred overnight to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membrane was blocked with 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in 0.1 m NaCl, 0.02 m Tris, pH 7.2, 0.5% Tween 20 (TBST) for 2 h. The membrane was incubated overnight with goat anti-factor H, washed three times with TBST and then incubated with peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA). Subsequently, the membrane was washed in TBST and developed with the ECL detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. Relevant bands were excised, destained thoroughly, and subjected to amino acid sequencing. Sequence analysis was performed at the Harvard Microchemistry Facility (Cambridge, MA) by trypsin digestion followed by microcapillary reverse-phase HPLC nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry (µLC/MS/MS) on a Finnigan LCQ Quadrupole Ion Trap mass spectrometer (ThermoQuest, San Jose, CA) (29Chittum H.S. Lane W.S. Carlson B.A. Roller P.P. Lung F.D. Lee B.J. Hatfield D.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10866-10870Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Rat and mouse platelets were processed for standard indirect IF. Platelets were fixed in buffered formalin and then incubated for 1 h with goat anti-factor H followed by FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG (Cappel, Durham, NC) and viewed with a BX-60 IF microscope (Olympus Optical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). In parallel, platelets were stained with anti-rat or -mouse Crry or anti-rat thrombocyte F(ab′)2 as positive controls or with nonimmune F(ab′)2 as a negative control. Purified platelets were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with anti-factor H, anti-Crry, or anti-DAF as positive controls, or nonimmune F(ab′)2 as a negative control. After washing with PBS, the platelets were incubated with FITC-conjugated anti-goat or anti-sheep IgG (Cappel Laboratories, West Chester, PA). Thereafter, the platelets were washed and analyzed by flow cytometry (FACScan, BD PharMingen). Additional experiments were designed to determine whether factor H was adsorbed on the platelet membrane or whether it was bound via glycosylphosphatidyl inositol (GPI) or sialic acid residues. Aliquots of platelets were washed with high salt (PBS + 0.4 m NaCl) or pretreated with neuraminidase (5 units in 100 µl of 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm sodium acetate, 5 mmCaCl2, pH 6.5, Ref. 30Ram S. Sharma A.K. Simpson S.D. Gulati S. McQuillen D.P. Pangburn M.K. Rice P.A. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 743-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) or phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PIPLC, 1 unit in 100 µl of PBS) for 30 min at 37 °C. After washing, platelets were then stained with anti-factor H Abs and analyzed by flow cytometry. Control assays using anti-Crry and anti-DAF Abs were run in parallel. Purified rat or mouse C3 was incubated with sheep E bearing human C4b and oxidized C2b (EC42, National Jewish Laboratories, Denver, CO) to form EC423b (21He C. Alexander J.J. Lim A. Quigg R.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 341: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). A total of 2 × 107 EC423b cells were mixed with ∼1 × 108 rat or mouse platelets in 200 µl of 0.14m NaCl, 0.02 m sodium barbital, 0.015 mm CaCl2, 0.05 mmMgCl2, pH 7.4, and rotated at 37 °C for 20 min. As viewed by light microscopy, clumps of 3 or more EC423b cells were considered to be positive. In all instances, the source of C3b and platelets were from the same species. Platelets mixed with EC42 cells and incubated at 37 °C were used as negative controls. To determine the effect of Abs on rosette formation, platelets were preincubated with anti-factor H or anti-Crry F(ab′)2 Abs at 10 µg/ml for 15 min at room temperature before the addition of EC423b. Total RNA was isolated from rat platelets, kidney, and liver using TriZol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc., Manassas, VA). cDNA was produced from 5 µg of total RNA by RT using oligo-dT primers (Life Technologies, Inc.). Subsequent PCR was performed with 20 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 100 µm of each deoxynucleotide triphosphate, 0.1 µm of each primer, and 2.5 units of Taqpolymerase. The primers were designed from the known sequence of mouse factor H, spanning bases 2556–3028 (GenBankTM accession number M12660) (20Kristensen T. Tack B.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3963-3967Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar): sense, 5′-TGATTGAAACCACCGTGAAA-3′ and antisense 5′-AATAAATGCTGGTTCCATC-3′. Thirty cycles of 1 min denaturation at 94 °C, 1 min annealing at 56 °C and 1 min extension at 72 °C were performed. PCR products formed were electrophoresed through a 2% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. The nucleotide sequence at the 3′-end of factor H mRNA from rat platelets was analyzed using a 3′ RACE kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). The first strand of cDNA synthesis was initiated at the poly(A)+ tail of rat platelet mRNA using an oligo-dT adapter primer. Amplification was done using a factor H specific primer: 5′-CCACCAACATGCTTACATGC-3′ spanning bases 3641–3660 of mouse factor H sequence and an antisense abridged universal amplification primer that had a complementary region to the adapter primer used in the first strand cDNA synthesis. PCR products obtained by RT-PCR and 3′-RACE were extracted from the gels with a commercially obtained kit (Qiagen, San Diego, CA). The purified PCR products were inserted into the TA vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Positive clones were sequenced on an ABI 373A DNA Sequencer using the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and M13 reverse primers. Sequence comparisons were made with Genetics Computer Group software (Madison, WI). 20 µg of total RNA was electrophoresed through a 1% agarose gel containing 2.2 m formaldehyde, transferred by capillary action to a nylon membrane, and cross-linked by ultraviolet irradiation. Membranes were prehybridized and hybridized at 42 °C in buffer containing 5× SSPE, 5× Denhardt's solution, 200 µg/ml of denatured salmon sperm DNA, 0.1% SDS, and 50% formamide. The PCR product obtained from platelets, used as probe, was random prime-labeled with [α-32P]dCTP to activities of ∼109 cpm/µg (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) (31Quigg R.J. Sneed A.E. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1994; 4: 1900-1908Google Scholar). After hybridization with the probe, the membranes were washed with 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS and then at 65 °C with 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS. Autoradiography was subsequently performed at −80 °C with an intensifying screen. The blots were stripped and complete probe removal verified by autoradiography. The blots were then probed for GAPDH as a housekeeping gene (32Alexander J.J. Lim A. He C. MacDonald R.L. Holers V.M. Quigg R.J. Immunopharmacology. 1999; 42: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and subjected to autoradiography. To confirm that CR1 is not the IAR in mice, platelets were isolated from CR1−/− mice. Platelets from both CR1−/− and wild-type mice formed rosettes with EC423b clearly evident by light microscopy (Fig.1). Rosettes were not formed with platelets from either strain and EC42 cells (not shown). Thus, CR1 does not function as the IAR of mouse platelets To isolate C3b-binding proteins from platelets, solubilized platelet membranes were subjected to C3b affinity chromatography. As shown in Fig.2, a predominant 150-kDa band was recovered. Under reducing conditions, this protein migrated at 175-kDa, consistent with the presence of intrachain disulfide bonds. In addition, a 115-kDa band was also recovered by C3b affinity chromatography. Tryptic peptides from the 150-kDa C3b-binding protein were analyzed by µLC/MS/MS and found to be identical to the sequence of mouse factor H (20Kristensen T. Tack B.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3963-3967Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Direct comparisons were made between the platelet 150-kDa C3b-binding protein and factor H purified from rat plasma. The amino acid sequences of peptides from both platelet and plasma proteins were identical (Table I). The peptides corresponded to residues 39–200 and 719–842 of the known 1216 amino acid mouse factor H sequence, and encompassed SCRs 1–4 and 12–14 of this 20 SCR-containing protein (20Kristensen T. Tack B.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3963-3967Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Identical peptides were obtained from the 115-kDa platelet C3b-binding protein, consistent with its identity to factor H through residue 842.Table IAmino acid sequences obtained from tryptic peptides derived from the platelet 150-kDa C3b-binding protein and rat plasma factor HPlateletsPlasmaCLPVTELENGRCLPVTELENGRLAVGSQFEFGAKLAVGSQFEFGAKWQSLPRWQSLPRTLGTIVKTLGTIVKWTQLPKCVATDQWTQLPKCVATDQ Open table in a new tab As an independent verification that the platelet C3b-binding proteins were comparable to factor H, immunoblotting was performed. The 150-kDa and 115-kDa C3b-binding proteins isolated from rat platelets were recognized by goat anti-human factor H by Western blotting (Fig.3, lane 1). As a positive control, plasma factor H was run in parallel (lane 2). Therefore, rat platelets have a 150-kDa C3b-binding protein with biochemical and immunochemical relatedness to factor H. By IF microscopy, platelets from rats (Fig.4A) and mice (not shown) were positively stained with anti-factor H Abs. Staining for the complement inhibitory protein, Crry, present on the surface of platelets (Fig.4 B) (18Quigg R.J. Holers V.M. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1481-1488PubMed Google Scholar), and with polyclonal anti-platelet Abs (Fig.4 C) were used as positive controls. The surface expression of factor H on rat platelets was further substantiated by flow cytometry (Fig. 5B), with Crry again serving as the positive control (Fig. 5 C). Rat factor E subjected to flow cytometry were not stained with anti-factor H Abs (not shown), indicating factor H was not passively adsorbed to circulating blood cells. As these studies were performed without plasma membrane solubilization, this indicates factor H is a membrane-bound protein on the rat and mouse platelet surface.Figure 5Flow cytometric analysis of factor H on rat platelets. Rat platelets were incubated with nonimmune (A), anti-factor H (B), or anti-Crry F(ab′)2 (C) Abs. In further studies, platelets were pretreated prior to analysis. The black line represents the results from platelets exposed to PIPLC (D andE), or neuraminidase (F), whereas thecolor-filled areas indicate platelets exposed to appropriate buffer control alone. Platelets were incubated in PIPLC followed by anti-factor H (D) or anti-DAF (E), or treated with neuraminidase and then anti-factor H Abs (F). In all instances, bound primary Abs were detected with FITC-labeled secondary Abs and analyzed by FACScan. The increased fluorescence of platelets in neuraminidase buffer alone stained with anti-factor H (F, filled red area) was a consistent finding in all experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine the mechanism by which factor H is bound to the platelet surface, platelets were subjected to flow cytometry after the following treatments: 1) high salt washing; 2) pretreatment with PIPLC, and 3) pretreatment with neuraminidase. High salt washing did not remove factor H from the surface of platelets, nor, as predicted, did it remove the type I membrane protein, Crry (not shown). PIPLC treatment did not eliminate Crry (not shown) or factor H (Fig. 5 D) from the platelet surface, whereas DAF, attached to the platelet surface by a GPI anchor (33Spicer A.P. Seldin M.F. Gendler S.J. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 3079-3091PubMed Google Scholar, 34Spiller O.B. Hanna S.M. Morgan B.P. Immunology. 1999; 97: 374-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) was removed (Fig. 5 E). In contrast, neuraminidase treatment reduced the binding of anti-factor H (Fig. 5 F) but not anti-Crry (not shown) to the platelet surface demonstrating that factor H is bound to platelets through sialic acid residues. To determine whether rat platelets express factor H mRNA transcripts, RT-PCR analysis was performed with primers designed from the known sequence of mouse factor H. As shown in Fig. 6, a PCR product of the predicted size of 472 base pairs was amplified from rat platelets (lane 1) and liver (lane 2). By sequence analysis, the rat platelet and liver sequences were identical, and 90% similar to the known sequence of mouse factor H encompassing amino acids 802–958 (20Kristensen T. Tack B.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3963-3967Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar); the predicted translated protein product was 85% identical to mouse factor H as shown in TableII. Using this PCR product as probe in Northern analyses, RNA from platelets, kidney, and liver had identically sized RNA transcripts of 5.5, 3.4, and 1.8 kilobases (Fig.7).Table IIPredicted amino acid sequence of rat platelet factor H compared to that of mouse liver factor HSCR#14IETTVKYLDGEKVSVLCQDGYLTQGPEEMVCKHGRWQSLPR CTLNDSDISCR#15EKIPCSQPPKIEHGSIKSPRSSEER-DLIESSSYEHGTTFSYVCDDGFRISEENRVTCNMGKWSSLPRCVTNLRSHPIYTPSCR#16GIPCGPPPSIPLGIVSHELESYQYGEEVTYNCSEGFGIDGPAFILTLHHTShown is the amino acid sequence of rat platelet factor H predicted from the nucleotide sequence obtained from RT-PCR.

The conserved cysteine residues are underlined. In bold type is a peptide sequence obtained from rat platelet C3b-binding proteins by µLC/MS/MS. By 3′-RACE of RNA isolated from rat platelets, a product of the predicted size of 699 base pairs was amplified. The nucleotide sequence of this product was identical to the known sequence of mouse liver factor H, except for one base at residue 4169 in the 3′-untranslated region. These results indicate rat platelets have the inherent capacity to produce factor H protein, which is predicted to be a soluble protein. Thus, any alterations accounting for its capacity to bind to the platelet membrane are likely to occur after protein translation. Platelets from normal rats and mice formed rosettes with EC423b cells (Fig.8, A and C). Preincubation with anti-factor H F(ab′)2 Abs inhibited rosette formation in platelets of both species (Fig. 8, Band E). As a negative control, antibodies to Crry, a complement regulator on the rodent platelet surface, were used. Platelets pretreated with anti-Crry F(ab′)2 clearly rosetted with EC423b (Fig. 8 D). Rosette formation was eliminated when platelets were preincubated with neuraminidase (Fig.8 F). Thus, factor H on the rodent platelet surface is the functional IAR. The IA reaction was defined by Nelson (2Nelson Jr., R.N. Science. 1953; 118: 733-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 3Nelson D.S. Adv. Immunol. 1963; 3: 131-180Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar) as the interaction between cells and complement-coated particles. Immune complexes bearing the activated complement component, C3b, bind to cells containing IAR, which then transport them to the mononuclear phagocyte system for their disposal. In primates, IA function clearly is served by CR1 on erythrocytes. In contrast, the immune complex clearance mechanism in non-primates, including rodents, is carried out by platelets rather than erythrocytes (13Henson P.M.

A number of cytokines are currently employed in the treatment of blood deficiencies and cancers. For example, erythropoietin is administered to stimulate red blood cell production in patients suffering from anemia. 1wwwext.amgen.com/product/epogenHome.html (2001). Human growth hormone is used to stimulate growth in children and adults exhibiting extremely slow or subnormal growth due to hormonal deficiencies, 2www.genentech.com/products/nutropin/(2001). and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)3 is employed to treat cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy in order to alleviate the depression of white blood cell levels produced by cytotoxic therapeutic agents. 4www.neupogen.com/(2001). Although the activity and specificity of function make the cytokines potentially powerful therapeutic agents, they are not ideal drugs. Thus, there is keen interest in developing alternative or improved molecules that demonstrate cytokine function but have superior pharmacological properties (4Chaiken I.M. Williams W.V.

Protein reengineering offers a means of improving the physical and biological properties of these peptides and proteins to enhance their efficacy as therapeutics. Here, we describe the results of reengineering the cytokine G-CSF to increase thermodynamic stability while retaining biological activity. G-CSF plays a critical role in the process of hematopoiesis (11Demetri G.D. Griffin J.D. Blood. 1991; 78: 2791-2808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), regulating the proliferation, differentiation, and survival of neutrophils and neutrophilic progenitor cells (Fig.1). As a therapeutic agent, G-CSF is used to reduce the risks of serious infection in immunocompromised individuals undergoing chemotherapy and thus facilitates recovery. G-CSF cannot be administered orally, and frequent (daily) injections of significant quantities of the cytokine (5–10 μg/kg) are necessary throughout the course of treatment (3Baldwin E. Xu J. Hajiseyedjavadi O. Baase W.A. Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 542-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In addition, G-CSF requires stringent formulation and storage conditions such as constant refrigeration; supplies must be discarded if left at room temperature. G-CSF is a member of the long chain family of cytokines, characterized by an antiparallel 4-helix bundle fold, with long overhand connecting loops (Fig. 2) (14Zink T. Ross A. Luers K. Cieslar C. Rudolph R. Holak T.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8453-8463Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 15Mott H.R. Campbell I.D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 114-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 16Wells J.A. de Vos A.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 609-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The redesign of G-CSF was facilitated by studies that identified by alanine-scanning mutagenesis the primary binding determinants of the protein for its receptor (17Reidhaar-Olson J.F. De Souza-Hart J.A. Selick H.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9034-9041Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 18Young D.C. Zhan H. Cheng Q.L. Hou J. Matthews D.J. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1228-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Key residues that must be conserved in any reengineering study lie on the surfaces of helices A and C (Fig. 2), with additional potentially important contacts in the loop regions. The recently reported crystal structure of G-CSF complexed with the cytokine receptor homologous region of the G-CSF receptor reinforces the importance of these helices and suggests additional contacts by residues in the N-terminal region of G-CSF, which is unstructured in the unbound protein (19Aritomi M. Kunishima N. Okamoto T. Kuroki R. Ota Y. Morikawa K. Nature. 1999; 401: 713-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In reengineering cytokines such as G-CSF, it is far less likely that receptor binding will be disrupted or that mutants will raise an immune response, if the changes to protein sequence and topology are kept to a minimum. Two aspects of G-CSF appear to lend themselves most readily to reengineering; the unusual abundance of glycine residues in the helices and the long overhand loops connecting the helices in the bundle. The focus of the studies reported here is the helical glycine residues. An abundance of glycine residues in the helical regions of a soluble protein is unusual. It has one of the lowest intrinsic α-helical propensities of all the amino acids (second only to proline). This is manifested in both statistical and thermodynamic studies (20Chakrabartty A. Baldwin R.L. Adv. Protein Chem. 1995; 46: 141-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 21Chakrabartty A. Schellman J.A. Baldwin R.L. Nature. 1991; 351: 586-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 22Munoz V. Serrano L. Proteins. 1994; 20: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 23Pace C.N. Scholtz J.M. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 422-427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In thermodynamic studies, alanine stabilizes a peptide or protein helix by up to 2 kcal/mol relative to glycine (20Chakrabartty A. Baldwin R.L. Adv. Protein Chem. 1995; 46: 141-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Therefore, glycine to alanine substitutions in the helical regions of proteins would be expected to enhance protein stability. This premise has been investigated in a number of systems (24Hecht M.H. Sturtevant J.M. Sauer R.T. Proteins. 1986; 1: 43-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 25Ganter C. Pluckthun A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9395-9402Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 26Marqusee S. Regan L. Curr. Biol. 1991; 1: 207-209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar, 27Margarit I.

We have therefore systematically replaced the helical glycine residues of G-CSF individually and in combination and evaluated both the stability and the biological activity of each mutant. After successive reengineering cycles, we produced three mutants that demonstrated significantly improved stabilities relative to G-CSF and retained the ability to induce cellular proliferation comparable with that of wild-type G-CSF. Escherichia coli strain DH10B (30Grant S.G. Jessee J. Bloom F.R. Hanahan D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4645-4649Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar) was used for both cloning and expression purposes. The plasmid pBAD-G4 (17Reidhaar-Olson J.F. De Souza-Hart J.A. Selick H.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9034-9041Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) with an insert for the gene containing the G-CSF wild-type construct (with a C17S substitution to reduce aggregation and the DNA sequence engineered to contain 13 unique restriction sites without changing the amino acid sequence) was derived from the vector pBAD18, Ref. 31Guzman L.M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3960) Google Scholar; provided by Dr. John Reidhaar-Olson, Affymax Corporation. This vector provides ampicillin resistance and protein expression is under control of the inducible promoter araBAD. To aid in purification, a hexahistidine metal affinity tag and a 14-amino acid spacer were incorporated at the N terminus of G-CSF by inserting a DNA cassette defined by the NdeI andCsp1 restriction sites in the original construct. A sequence coding for the tobacco-etch-virus protease (rTEV-p) cleavage site was included in the spacer sequence N-terminal to the threonine (numbered T1) of wt-G-CSF (32Lucast L.J. Batey R.T. Doudna J.A. BioTechniques. 2001; 30: 544-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Proteolysis by rTEV-p generates an N-terminal glycine residue (numbered G-1) preceding this threonine residue and removes the His6 tag and linker sequence. Cassettes encoding the desired mutations were prepared via polymerase chain reaction using synthetic primers incorporating the proscribed change in sequence. The new sequences were then incorporated into the plasmid by cassette mutagenesis utilizing the appropriate restriction sites. Competent DH10B cells were transformed with DNA following ligation and screened for ampicillin resistance. The plasmid DNA of each clone was then sequenced to confirm its identity (HHMI Biopolymer/Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory, Yale University). Starter cultures in 75 ml of Luria broth with 100 μg/ml ampicillin were prepared from DH10B cells transformed with the appropriate plasmid and allowed to grow at 37 °C for 4–5 h with agitation (33Ausubel F.M. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology: A Compendium of Methods from Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Pub. Associates and Wiley-Interscience, New York1989: 3-4Google Scholar). Superbroth (1 liter) was then inoculated with 15 ml of the starter culture and allowed to grow at 37 °C with agitation (33Ausubel F.M. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology: A Compendium of Methods from Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Pub. Associates and Wiley-Interscience, New York1989: 3-4Google Scholar). Protein expression was induced by the addition of arabinose to a final concentration of 0.2% once the cell culture had reached anA600 of 1–2 absorbance units. Cells were harvested by centrifugation after ∼12 h of further growth, and the cell pellets were stored frozen. The G-CSF variants were purified using a two-step protocol that we devised. This process provided a generic method that could be applied to the purification of G-CSF and all of the mutants. The frozen cell pellets were suspended in 30 ml of lysis buffer (7 mGdnHCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 100 mmNaCl) per liter of original growth medium. The resuspended cells were lysed by short bursts of sonication. Solubilized protein was then separated from the solids by centrifugation at 13,560 ×g for 30 min. The supernatant was collected and loaded onto 2 ml TALON resin (CLONTECH) per liter of original growth medium equilibrated in lysis buffer. The resin was washed with ∼10-column volumes of lysis buffer and then washed twice with 2-column volumes of renaturing buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl). The resin was then re-suspended in 5 ml of renaturing buffer and agitated for 30 min before drawing off the aqueous solution. The loaded resin thus washed was suspended in 5 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 500 mm imidazole and agitated at room temperature for 10 min to release the protein from the resin. The eluent, containing the His-tagged G-CSF, was then loaded onto a Superdex G75 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted with renaturing buffer. By this method, it was possible to isolate ∼0.5–2 mg of refolded pure G-CSF per liter of growth medium. Approximately 10 μm protein in 100 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7, and 200 mm NaCl in a 1-mm path length cell was used to collect spectra from 200–260 nm at 25 °C. Data were collected using an Aviv 62DS Circular Dichroism Spectrometer (Aviv Instruments). Chemical denaturation of wild-type and mutant proteins was followed by monitoring the ellipticity at 222 nm as a function of GdnHCl concentration. Two stock solutions, one renaturing and the other denaturing, were prepared for G-CSF and each mutant. The native solution consisted of ∼10 μm protein in 100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7) and 200 mm NaCl. The denaturing solution consisted of ∼10 μm protein in 100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7), 200 mm NaCl with 4.5–6 m GdnHCl. The exact concentration of GdnHCl in the denaturing solution was varied for different proteins, reflecting different stabilities. Each point on the denaturation titration was prepared by the serial exchange of equal volumes of buffer between the native and denaturing solutions, followed by thorough mixing. The signal at 222 nm was collected and averaged over a 1-min period following equilibration at 25 °C for 10 min. Guanidine concentrations of the initial and final samples were established within approximately ±1% by refractometry using an Atago R5000 refractometer (Atago, Japan), allowing the calculation of the intermediate concentrations (34Kita Y. Arakawa T. Lin T.Y. Timasheff S.N. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15178-15189Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Because the GdnHCl-induced unfolding transition is reversible, this titration method afforded reliable data consuming a minimal amount of protein in the process. The fraction of folded protein as a function of the concentration of GdnHCl was determined for G-CSF and each mutant protein. The pre- and post-transition regions of the titration curves were fit to Equations 1 and 2, respectively. These describe the signal attributable to the folded and denatured states (Θnat and Θden, respectively) as functions of denaturant concentration. Θnat=Θnato+mN[GdnHCl]Equation 1 Θden=Θdeno+mD[GdnHCl]Equation 2 In Equations 2 and 3, Θ°nat and Θ°den are the ellipticities of the native and denatured states in the absence of denaturant and mN and mD, their respective dependence on GdnHCl concentration. Equation 3 corrects for these baselines and provides the fraction of total protein that is folded.Fraction folded=(Θobs−Θnat)/(Θden−Θnat)Equation 3 Here, Θobs corresponds to the observed ellipticity. The fraction of folded protein was plotted as a function of GdnHCl concentration (Fig. 3), and the concentration of GdnHCl corresponding to the midpoint of the transition (Cm) was determined. Thus, Cm provides a measure of stability. The free energy (ΔG) of folding was determined using the method of Santoro and Bolen (35Santoro M.M. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8063-8068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1607) Google Scholar). The relationship between the fraction folded and the folding equilibrium (Kobs) allows the determination of the ΔG of folding by fitting the chemical denaturation curves of G-CSF and the designed mutants to Equation4.Θobs=[(Θnato+mN[GdnHCl])+(Θdeno+mD[GdnHCl])×exp−(ΔGN−D/RT+m[GdnHCl]/RT)]/[1+exp−(ΔGN−D/RT+m[GdnHCl]/RT)]Equation 4 Here ΔGN-D is defined as the free energy of unfolding in the absence of denaturant; m, the dependence of ΔGN-D on the concentration of GdnHCl; R, the universal gas constant; and T, the temperature at which denaturation was performed. In this fashion, the ΔGN-D for the wild-type protein and the mutants were determined. The free energy of folding, ΔG (ΔG = -ΔGN-D), the corresponding m-value for folding and the degree of stabilization/destabilization relative to wild-type, ΔΔG, reported in Table I.

Measurement of cell proliferation in response to G-CSF employed exponentially growing LGM-1 cells transfected with the full-length G-CSFR (37Koay D.C. Sartorelli A.C. Blood. 1999; 93: 3774-3784Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Li J. Koay D.C. Xiao H. Sartorelli A.C. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1481-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To measure the growth of the transfected LGM-1 cells in response to wild-type or various G-CSF mutants, cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and all of the transfected cells were seeded into fresh culture medium at a density of 5 × 104 cells/ml in the presence of 45 units/ml of rmIL-3, 10 pg/ml of wild-type G-CSF, or the various G-CSF mutants. Cell numbers were determined daily for 3 days after exposure to rmIL-3, wild-type G-CSF, or various mutant G-CSFs using a Coulter model ZM particle counter (Coulter Electronics) connected to a Coulter model 256 Channelyzer (Coulter Electronics). Wild-type G-CSF contains 14 glycine residues, 7 of which lie in central positions within the helices of the 4-helix bundle (Fig. 2). Two of these glycine residues are located in helix A (Gly-26 and Gly-28), three in helix B (Gly-73, Gly-81, and Gly-87), and two in helix D (Gly-149 and Gly-150). To thoroughly explore alanine replacement as a means of improving stability, we chose to consider all of the helical glycine residues as target replacement sites. Each helical glycine residue was individually replaced by alanine to generate 7 point mutants, identified by the position of the replaced glycine residue; G-CSF(G26A), G-CSF(G28A), G-CSF(G73A), G-CSF(G81A), G-CSF(G87A), G-CSF(G149A), and G-CSF(G150A). G-CSF and the designed mutants were each overexpressed and purified. The biological effects of G-CSF are mediated through its interaction with the G-CSF receptor (G-CSFR), a member of the cytokine receptor superfamily. Upon binding of G-CSF to its receptor, the G-CSFR dimerizes and signaling events are initiated from the cytoplasmic domain. To evaluate the biological activity of G-CSF and the reengineered mutants, we have introduced the G-CSF receptor into IL-3-dependent myeloid LGM-1 cells (LGM GR95 cells). LGM-1 cells do not naturally express endogenous G-CSFR (39Dong F. van Buitenen C. Pouwels K. Hoefsloot L.H. Lowenberg B. Touw I.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7774-7781Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Exogenous expression of the full-length G-CSFR makes LGM-1 cells responsive to G-CSF resulting in cellular proliferation upon exposure to G-CSF in the absence of IL-3. Cell proliferation assays using these cells thus provided a measure of the biological activity of the designed mutants. We stimulated the LGM-1 cells expressing G-CSFR with wild-type G-CSF and the designed mutants (10 pg/ml in each case). Treatment with less than 10 pg/ml wild-type G-CSF results in no discernable proliferation of LGM GR95 cells. The LGM GR95 cells treated with the G-CSF mutants exhibited increases in cellular numbers over a 3-day period in a manner analogous to those treated with the wild-type G-CSF (Fig.3). Therefore, we conclude that the point mutants retained the ability to induce proliferation comparable with the wild-type protein (Fig. 3). Chemical denaturation was used to evaluate the stabilities of G-CSF and the designed mutants. G-CSF and the variants undergo reversible denaturation transitions induced by GdnHCl, and it is therefore possible to use this method to derive thermodynamic parameters and assess stability (Fig. 4). By this method, we determined the ΔG and Cm of unfolding (Table I). The thermal denaturation of G-CSF is irreversible at pH 7 (40Kolvenbach C.G. Narhi L.O. Philo J.S. Li T. Zhang M. Arakawa T. J. Peptide Res. 1997; 50: 310-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Thus, it is not an appropriate method to use to establish the thermodynamic parameters for G-CSF in a context that is relevant to stability at 25–37 °C. In ranking the mutants, it is necessary to consider both Cmand ΔG. They provide complementary measures of stability relative to the wild-type protein (ΔΔG and ΔCm) and both can be derived from the same denaturation data (Table I). The ΔG of folding was determined by fitting the denaturation curves to Equation 4. The m value (corresponding to the slope of the transition) reflects the dependence of ΔG on the concentration of GdnHCl is also provided by these fits. The majority of the mutants have m values within ± 15% of the mean value. This similarity in the m values suggests that the slopes of the transitions and therefore cooperativity are similar for the mutants. Therefore, the Cm values, which are determined by plotting the fraction of folded protein as a function of GdnHCl concentration, are also indicative of relative stability. The point mutants G-CSF(G26A), G-CSF(G28A), G-CSF (G149A), and G-CSF(G150A) resulted in the greatest increases in protein stability (ΔΔG −2 to −3 ± ∼0.7 kcal and ΔCm 0.1–0.6m); the mutation at position 73 resulted in a more modest increase in stability (ΔΔG −1.44 ± 0.45 kcal and ΔCm 0.1 m); and the mutations at 81 and 87 were destabilizing (ΔΔG 1.68 ± 0.51 and 1.86 ± 0.38 kcal, respectively, and ΔCm values nearly identical to wild-type G-CSF). The mutations at positions 26, 28, 149, and 150 clearly provided the best basis for the following generations of mutants, because they resulted in the most substantial gains in stability. We combined the most stabilizing point mutations that were in close proximity to each other to create the second generation of mutants, G-CSF(G26A/G28A) and G-CSF(G149A/G150A). Both G-CSF(G26A/G28A) and G-CSF(G149A/G150A) retained the ability to induce proliferation in myeloid LGM-1 cells transfected with the G-CSFR. The double mutant G-CSF(G26A/G28A) exhibited an increase in stability (ΔΔG −2.74 ± 0.99 kcal and ΔCm 0.9m) relative to the single individual point mutants G-CSF(G26A) and G-CSF(G28A). G-CSF(G149A/G150A) realized a greater cumulative improvement in relative stability (ΔΔG −4.20 ± 1.13 kcal and ΔCm 0.6 m). The third generation of mutants incorporated the stabilizing double substitution G149A and G150A in combination with either G26A or G28A to generate the pair of triple mutants G-CSF(G26A/G149A/G150A) and G-CSF(G28A/G149A/G150A), both of which retained biological activity comparable with G-CSF. By combining the G149A/G150A double mutation and a third stabilizing single mutation, the triple mutants were expected to be more stable than wild-type protein. Chemical denaturation indicated that G-CSF(G26A/G149A/G150A) and G-CSF(G28A/G149A/G150A) demonstrated significantly elevated stability (ΔΔG −3.46 ± 0.54 kcal, ΔCm 0.8 m and ΔΔG −6.2 ± 2.01 kcal, ΔCm 1.2 m, respectively). However, the stability gains attained in G-CSF(G26A/G149A/G150A) were comparable with those of the double mutants G-CSF(G149A/G150A) and G-CSF(G26A/G28A). Therefore, incorporation of the substitution at position 26 did not appear to improve upon G-CSF(G149A/G150A). This was not the case for G-CSF(G28A/G149A/G150A), which was notably more stable than G-CSF(G149A/G150A). The objectives of this work were 2-fold. The first was to reengineer a protein of therapeutic interest to enhance its thermodynamic stability. The second was to achieve this goal through minimal changes in protein sequence. The biological function of G-CSF is linked inextricably with the protein fold. Thus, it is critical that alterations in the protein sequence not result in a large perturbation in structure, which would compromise the potential therapeutic utility of the mutant. Therefore, it was essential to assess the ability of each mutant protein to promote cell proliferation, as well as their respective stabilities. Currently, not all of the factors that contribute to the pharmacokinetic properties of proteins are known, but stability likely contributes significantly, and it represents a tractable target for protein engineering. Some of the basic principles regarding the relationship between protein sequence, structure, and stability have been established (21Chakrabartty A. Schellman J.A. Baldwin R.L.

Increased stability could translate into enhanced resistance to enzymatic proteolysis or reduce the requirement of refrigeration for storage by improving protein stability at ambient temperatures. Replacement of helical glycine residues with alanine, an amino acid with a much higher α-helical propensity, potentially provides a relatively simple means of increasing protein stability. The stabilization associated with such glycine to alanine substitutions can be attributed, in part, to the unfavorable entropic cost of constraining the glycine backbone into a helical conformation, relative to alanine. The net effect on protein stability of any amino acid change represents a balance between energetically favorable contributions, for example intrinsic α-helical propensity, and energetically unfavorable interactions, such as steric conflicts. The small increase in sidechain bulk involved in substituting the methyl group of alanine for the hydrogen of glycine helps to minimize the potential for introducing steric conflicts. We sought to improve the helical propensity of residues within the 4-helix bundle region of G-CSF by systematically replacing the 7 helical glycine residues with alanines. By generating and evaluating single point mutants, we were able to establish the effects of each change and then group them based on whether they were stabilizing or destabilizing relative to wild-type G-CSF. Alanine replacements at positions 73, 81, and 87 resulted in either a smaller increase or even a decrease in stability and for this reason were not utilized in later redesigns. The smaller increase in stability associated with G-CSF(G73A) can be explained in part by its localization at the N terminus of helix-B, adjacent to the disulfide bridging Cys-64 and Cys-74. The destabilizing effects of Gly/Ala replacements at positions 81 and 87 may be attributable to the close proximity of the AB and CD loops along much of helix-B. They could partially occlude residues on the surface of helix-B, and thus the methyl sidechain of alanine may introduce steric clashes. Additionally, the helix unwinds slightly in the turn containing position 81 allowing Leu-82 to pack into the core of the 4-helix bundle. Alanine replacement could interfere with this unwinding. Replacing glycine residues with alanine at positions 26, 28, 149, and 150 were found to result in the greatest increases in stability, and therefore, were used as the basis for future generations of mutants. Presumably this increased stabilization results from fewer deleterious interactions associated with the substituted alanine residue. Two successive reengineering cycles, combining favorable mutations, resulted in four versions of G-CSF with significant stability enhancements over the wild-type protein, G-CSF(G26A/G28A), G-CSF(G149A/G150A), G-CSF(G26A/G149A/G150A) and G-CSF(G28A/G149A/G150A). These mutants provide an opportunity to explore the correlation between the factors contributing to thermodynamic stability and those influencing pharmacokinetic properties. They also allow us to begin considering how protein stability may directly affect receptor-binding kinetics and thus biological activity. Variants of G-CSF and other cytokines with substantially enhanced stabilities have additional practical application potential. Many cell lines that are used in the laboratory and maintained in tissue culture are dependent on exogenously added cytokines for their survival and proliferation. The increased stability of the reengineered G-CSF variants described here could translate into extended effective lifetimes in tissue culture, thus reducing the amount and frequency of the cytokine supplement that is required. In addition, reengineered variants of G-CSF may also have potential therapeutic applications with immunosuppressed patients, where G-CSF is used to expedite the recovery of neutrophil counts that have been depleted as a result of chemotherapy. The dramatic improvements in the stability of G-CSF arising from double and triple Gly/Ala substitutions demonstrate the importance of intrinsic α-helix propensities to overall protein stability. These gains in stability were achieved without compromising the biological activity of G-CSF. Similar approaches can be used to rationally manipulate the physicochemical properties of other long chain cytokines, to optimize their preparation, efficacy, and storage properties.

https://openalex.org/W2019511369,"Abstract Serpin family protein proteinase inhibitors trap proteinases at the acyl-intermediate stage of cleavage of the serpin as a proteinase substrate by undergoing a dramatic conformational change, which is thought to distort the proteinase active site and slow deacylation. To investigate the extent to which proteinase catalytic function is defective in the serpin-proteinase complex, we compared the pH dependence of dissociation of several serpin-proteinase acyl-complexes with that of normal guanidinobenzoyl-proteinase acyl-intermediate complexes. Whereas the apparent rate constant for dissociation of guanidinobenzoyl-proteinase complexes (k diss, app) showed a pH dependence characteristic of His-57 catalysis of complex deacylation, the pH dependence of k diss, app for the serpin-proteinase complexes showed no evidence for His-57 involvement in complex deacylation and was instead characteristic of a hydroxide-mediated deacylation similar to that observed for the hydrolysis of tosylarginine methyl ester. Hydroxylamine enhanced the rate of serpin-proteinase complex dissociation but with a rate constant for nucleophilic attack on the acyl bond several orders of magnitude slower than that of hydroxide, implying limited accessibility of the acyl bond in the complex. The addition of 10–100 mmCa2+ ions stimulated up to 80-fold the dissociation rate constant of several serpin-trypsin complexes in a saturable manner at neutral pH and altered the pH dependence to a pattern characteristic of His-57-catalyzed complex deacylation. These results support a mechanism of kinetic stabilization of serpin-proteinase complexes wherein the complex is trapped as an acyl-intermediate by a serpin conformational change-induced inactivation of the proteinase catalytic function, but suggest that the inactive proteinase conformation in the complex is in equilibrium with an active proteinase conformation that can be stabilized by the preferential binding of an allosteric ligand such as Ca2+."

One way to get information in this field is to identify the enzyme(s) responsible for their synthesis. The corresponding gene(s) can then be deleted and the resulting phenotype tested. Pseudouridine residues in RNAs are formed post-transcriptionally by a group of enzymes called RNA:Ψ-synthases (26Kammen H.O. Marvel C.C. Hardy L. Penhoet E.E. J. Biol.

For a long time, the E. coli RNA:Ψ-synthases were the only ones to be identified. A thorough search in DNA data banks for homologs ofE. coli RNA:Ψ-synthases led to the identification of four families (TruA, TruB, RluA, and RsuA; Refs. 27Koonin E.V.

The E. coliprotein RluAp acts both at position 32 in tRNAs and position 746 in 23S rRNA (30Wrzesinski J. Nurse K. Bakin A. Lane B.G. Ofengand J. RNA (N.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). A comparison of the amino acid sequence of the E. coli RNA:Ψ-synthases and orthologs in other organisms reveals the presence of an invariant aspartate residue within a relatively well conserved motif (27Koonin E.V.

The situation for rRNAs is understood. Formation of the numerous Ψ residues in yeast cytoplasmic rRNA is guided by H/ACA small nucleolar RNAs and catalyzed by a unique enzyme of the TruB family, Cbf5p (40Lafontaine D.L.J.

Fabrizio P. Mann M. Lührmann R. RNA (N.

Massenet S. Grosjean H. Motorin Y. Branlant C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1941-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, the situation is more complex for yeast tRNAs. The enzymes responsible for U-to-Ψ conversions at 11 of the 15 sites in cytoplasmic tRNAs and three (possibly five) of the eight sites in mitochondrial tRNAs (Fig. 1; see Ref. 42Sprinzl S. Horn C. Brown M. Ioudovitch A. Steinberg S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 148-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar) have been identified. Two of these enzymes, Pus1p and Pus3p are TruAp-related proteins (43Simos G. Tekotte H. Grosjean H. Segref A. Sharma K. Tollervey D. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2270-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 44Lecointe F. Simos G. Sauer A. Hurt E.C. Motorin Y. Grosjean H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1316-1323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Pus1p is a multisite-specific RNA:Ψ-synthase acting at eight different positions in various cytoplasmic tRNAs (positions 26, 27, 28, 34, 35, 36, 65, and 67) as well as at position 44 in U2 snRNA (11Massenet S.

Hurt E. Grosjean H. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 856-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Pus1p was also proposed to catalyze Ψ formation at positions 27 and 28 in mitochondrial tRNAs, but this is still not demonstrated (45Motorin Y. Keith G. Simon C. Foiret D. Simos G. Hurt E. Grosjean H. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 856-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Pus3p catalyzes Ψ formation of at positions 38 and 39 in the anticodon loops of several cytoplasmic and mitochondrial tRNAs (44Lecointe F. Simos G. Sauer A. Hurt E.C. Motorin Y. Grosjean H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1316-1323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Pus4p, similar to TruB in E. coli, is responsible for the formation of the highly conserved Ψ residue in tRNA at position 55 in both cytoplasm and mitochondria (46Becker H.F. Motorin Y. Planta R.J. Grosjean H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4493-4499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The enzymes catalyzing the formation of Ψ residues at positions 1, 13, 31, and 32 in cytoplasmic tRNAs and at positions 31, 32, and 72 in mitochondrial tRNAs remained to be identified (Fig. 1).Six Ψ residues were identified in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae UsnRNAs (11Massenet S. Motorin Y. Lafontaine D.L.J. Hurt E.C. Grosjean H. Branlant C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2142-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Thus far, only the enzyme responsible for the formation of residue Ψ44 in U2 snRNA was identified (Pus1p) (11Massenet S. Motorin Y. Lafontaine D.L.J. Hurt E.C. Grosjean H. Branlant C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2142-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Enzymes responsible for Ψ formation at positions 5 and 6 in U1 snRNA, 35 and 42 in U2 snRNA, and 99 in U5 snRNA remained to be characterized.Using the sequence homology approach, nine genes encoding putative RNA:Ψ-synthases were identified in the S. cerevisiaegenome. Five of them correspond to the already characterized RNA:Ψ-synthases (Pus1p, Pus3p, Pus4p, Pus5p, and Cbf5p; see above). Despite its partial characterization, Pus2p has not been assigned to an RNA substrate yet, and the substrate specificity of the three other putative RNA:Ψ-synthases, which are encoded by the YGR169c, YDL036c, and YOL066c (RIB2) ORFs that are related to theE. coli RluA family, have not been studied.To complete RNA:Ψ-synthase identification in S. cerevisiae, we replaced the YGR169c ORF, which shows strong sequence homology with E. colitRNA:Ψ32-synthase RluAp, by the kanamycin-resistant gene. We tested the effect of this gene deletion on cytoplasmic and mitochondrial tRNA pseudouridylation. Taking into account the existence of a dual substrate specificity for yeast Pus1p (11Massenet S. Motorin Y. Lafontaine D.L.J. Hurt E.C. Grosjean H. Branlant C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2142-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), we also tested whether the YGR169c ORF protein product may be involved in UsnRNA pseudouridylation. The results demonstrate that despite a pronounced sequence homology with E. colitRNA:Ψ32-synthase RluAp, the yeast YGR169c-encoded protein acts at position 31 in both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial tRNAs.AcknowlegmentsWe thank V.

Pus1p is a multisite-specific RNA:Ψ-synthase acting at eight different positions in various cytoplasmic tRNAs (positions 26, 27, 28, 34, 35, 36, 65, and 67) as well as at position 44 in U2 snRNA (11Massenet S.

Pus1p was also proposed to catalyze Ψ formation at positions 27 and 28 in mitochondrial tRNAs, but this is still not demonstrated (45Motorin Y. Keith G. Simon C. Foiret D. Simos G. Hurt E. Grosjean H. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 856-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Pus3p catalyzes Ψ formation of at positions 38 and 39 in the anticodon loops of several cytoplasmic and mitochondrial tRNAs (44Lecointe F. Simos G. Sauer A. Hurt E.C. Motorin Y. Grosjean H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1316-1323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Pus4p, similar to TruB in E. coli, is responsible for the formation of the highly conserved Ψ residue in tRNA at position 55 in both cytoplasm and mitochondria (46Becker H.F. Motorin Y. Planta R.J. Grosjean H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4493-4499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The enzymes catalyzing the formation of Ψ residues at positions 1, 13, 31, and 32 in cytoplasmic tRNAs and at positions 31, 32, and 72 in mitochondrial tRNAs remained to be identified (Fig. 1). Six Ψ residues were identified in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae UsnRNAs (11Massenet S. Motorin Y. Lafontaine D.L.J. Hurt E.C. Grosjean H. Branlant C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2142-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Thus far, only the enzyme responsible for the formation of residue Ψ44 in U2 snRNA was identified (Pus1p) (11Massenet S. Motorin Y. Lafontaine D.L.J. Hurt E.C. Grosjean H. Branlant C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2142-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Enzymes responsible for Ψ formation at positions 5 and 6 in U1 snRNA, 35 and 42 in U2 snRNA, and 99 in U5 snRNA remained to be characterized. Using the sequence homology approach, nine genes encoding putative RNA:Ψ-synthases were identified in the S. cerevisiaegenome. Five of them correspond to the already characterized RNA:Ψ-synthases (Pus1p, Pus3p, Pus4p, Pus5p, and Cbf5p; see above). Despite its partial characterization, Pus2p has not been assigned to an RNA substrate yet, and the substrate specificity of the three other putative RNA:Ψ-synthases, which are encoded by the YGR169c, YDL036c, and YOL066c (RIB2) ORFs that are related to theE. coli RluA family, have not been studied. To complete RNA:Ψ-synthase identification in S. cerevisiae, we replaced the YGR169c ORF, which shows strong sequence homology with E. colitRNA:Ψ32-synthase RluAp, by the kanamycin-resistant gene. We tested the effect of this gene deletion on cytoplasmic and mitochondrial tRNA pseudouridylation. Taking into account the existence of a dual substrate specificity for yeast Pus1p (11Massenet S. Motorin Y. Lafontaine D.L.J. Hurt E.C. Grosjean H. Branlant C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2142-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), we also tested whether the YGR169c ORF protein product may be involved in UsnRNA pseudouridylation. The results demonstrate that despite a pronounced sequence homology with E. colitRNA:Ψ32-synthase RluAp, the yeast YGR169c-encoded protein acts at position 31 in both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial tRNAs.

For example, extensive membrane nanotubules, typically 50–70 nm in diameter and up to several µm in length, have been observed to form the Golgi complex, the trans Golgi network, and the connections between the Golgi stacks. The morphological engineering of these membranes involve complex interactions between proteins and lipids that are not yet understood (3Weidman P. Roth R. Heuser J.

Cell. 1998; 9: 1617-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, there must be some fundamental machinery required to form such structures. We recently described the properties of a de novo-designed 18-mer peptide, Hel 13-5 (5Kiyota T. Lee S. Sugihara G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13196-13204Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 6Kitamura A. Kiyota T. Tomohiro M. Umeda A. Lee S. Inoue T. Sugihara G. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 1457-1468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This peptide can adopt an ideal α-helix having a 240° hydrophobic sector region (Fig.1A). It forms a self-association state in buffer solution by adopting this amphipathic structure (70% α-helical structure by CD), and it binds to model- and biomembranes with high affinity. In the present study, we show that Hel 13-5 induces nanotubular structures, not only for PC liposomes, but also for various naturally occurring phospholipids. Most importantly, we demonstrate that Hel 13-5 transforms spherical liposomes made from a Golgi-specific phospholipid mixture into nanotubules on the scale of, and resembling the shape of, the nanotubules of the Golgi apparatus. Peptide was synthesized by the Fmoc1 strategy based on the solid phase technique starting from Fmoc-PAL-PEG resin using a PerSeptive 9050 automatic peptide synthesizer described previously (5Kiyota T. Lee S. Sugihara G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13196-13204Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The stock solutions of Hel peptides were prepared as follows: the powders were damped with a small amount of 30% acidic acid and then diluted in buffer (5 mm Tes/100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4). The peptide concentrations in the buffer solution were determined from the UV absorbance of Trp at 280 nm (ε = 5500). A lipid solution in chloroform was filmed in a round bottom flask by drying in a stream of N2gas. The lipid film was hydrated with the Tes buffer by vortexing. The turbid liposome solution obtained was then diluted to a concentration of about 100 µm with the same buffer. The peptide solutions were then added to the solution to attain a given molar ratio of the peptide to lipid and then incubated at 25 °C. The absorbance of the sample solution was recorded at 400 nm using a JASCO spectrometer (Tokyo, Japan) after vigorous vortexing. The viscosities of Hel 13-5 and egg PC liposome solutions were obtained by a rotary type viscosity meter DV-II with a spindle type s40 (Brookfield EnG Labs Inc.). The sample solution was placed between the sample cup and the spindle after incubation at 25 °C for 24 h. The rotation velocity of the spindle was 50 rpm. The relative viscosity (η) was calculated using the following equation η = ηΘ / η0where ηI and η0 are the viscosities of liposome solutions in the presence and absence of peptide, respectively. Unilamellar liposomes with a controlled size distribution of about 80∼90 nm in diameter were prepared by the extrusion method (7Mayer L.D. Hope M.J. Cullis P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 856: 161-168Crossref Scopus (1565) Google Scholar). The liposomes formed by ultrasonic irradiation in the cuphorn of a Branson model 185 sonifier at room temperature were extruded through two stacked polycarbonate filters with a 100- and 200-nm pore size by applying nitrogen pressure and collected and re-extruded into an Extruder (Lipex Biomembranes Inc., Vancouver, Canada). The liposome solution (0.2 mm, 1 ml) was then added to the peptide solution (1 ml) at the appropriate concentrations at 25 °C. A NICOMP Submicron Particle Sizer, Model 370, with an argon ion laser (λ = 488 nm) of 75 milliwatt maximum power was used to measure liposome size (6Kitamura A. Kiyota T. Tomohiro M. Umeda A. Lee S. Inoue T. Sugihara G. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 1457-1468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). CD spectra were obtained using a JASCO J-600 spectrometer using a quartz cell with 1-mm path length. The peptide solutions were prepared at concentrations of 40∼50 µm in the presence and absence of egg PC liposomes. Lipids were stored at 1 mm concentration. For whole-amount observation, liposomes prepared in 5 mm Tes buffer (pH 7.4) containing 100 mm NaCl and 1 mm EDTA. The peptide concentration was 100 µm (lipid/peptide = 5). All the peptides were incubated for about 24 h with liposomes before the negative staining. The sample solutions were placed on carbon-coated grids and stained with 0.5% phosphotungstic acid adjusted to pH 7.4. For thin sectioning, the incubation mixture was fixed in a suspension of 2% glutaraldehyde in Tes buffer, pelleted in an Eppendorf centrifuge, and postfixed in OsO4. The precipitate was mixed with 3% agar solution, cut in 1 cm3 cubes, dehydrated by ethanol and propylene oxide, embedded in Epon 815, and sectioned. When Hel 13-5 was added to PC liposomes, the liposomes were transformed from spherical structures into twisted ribbon-like fibrils ∼25–50 nm in diameter and more than a few µm in length as determined by TEM (Fig.1, B and C). We confirmed that Hel 13-5 induces twisted helical-shaped fibrils in egg PC liposomes using atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. 1, Dand E). Under low magnification, TEM revealed a great many circular- and sheath-like nanotubular structures (Fig. 1F). Under high magnification, there were many unilamellar shapes including double-lamellar structures. The tubules were about 40–50 nm in diameter and 5 nm in thickness for unilamellar, and 10 nm in thickness for double-lamellar layers (Fig. 1G). Relative viscosity (η) measurements of the peptide-lipid solution demonstrated that the fibrils begin to form at a ratio of peptide to lipid (P/L) of about 1:10 as measured by the onset of a change in viscosity (Fig.1H). Because Hel 13-5 reshaped membranes in a simple system composed only of egg PC liposomes, it is logical to ask whether or not Hel 13-5 could also demonstrate this ability in a more complex and realistic biomembrane system, such as the liposomes formed from an organelle-specific mixture of phospholipids. We considered the effect of Hel 13-5 on the spherical liposomes formed from a Golgi-specific phospholipid mixture (PC/PE/PS/PI/SM/Ch = 50:16:5:6:7:17). We found that Hel 13-5 did indeed alter the morphology of the spherical liposomes made from a Golgi-specific phospholipid mixture. However, it was a surprise to find that Hel 13-5 induced the formation of nanotubules on the scale of, and with the shapes characteristic of, the nanotubules forming the Golgi apparatus (Fig.2A). These nanotubules (large arrow) had diameters of ∼40–50 nm and lengths of ∼400 nm. They were formed from larger tubules with lengths of ∼600 nm that had both ends pinched off into twisted tubules with extremely small diameters of ∼2–3 nm (small arrows). These 400 nm nanotubules bore a remarkable morphological resemblance to the nanotubules of the Golgi apparatus (8Alberts B. Bray B. Lewis J. Raff M. Roberts K. Watson J.D. Molecular Biology of The Cell. 3rd Ed. Garland Publishing, New York and London1994: 601-602Google Scholar) and were absolutely distinct from the fibrils formed by the interaction of Hel 13-5 and the egg PC phospholipid liposomes (Fig. 1, B–E). Although Hel 13-5 formed fibrils with neutral (PC) bilayers, we previously found that it formed fused vesicles in acidic liposomes (PC/PG = 3:1) (6Kitamura A. Kiyota T. Tomohiro M. Umeda A. Lee S. Inoue T. Sugihara G. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 1457-1468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Thus, fibril formation depends on the lipid species. To investigate in greater detail the dependence of nanotubule formation on lipid composition, we studied the interaction between Hel 13-5 and various neutral and acidic lipid species by means of electron microscopy, turbidity, and dynamic light scattering (TableI). Electron micrographs taken 24 h after the addition of Hel 13-5 to several liposome systems are shown in Fig. 2, B–F. We found that the resulting morphology was indeed dependent on the lipid mixture. Hel 13-5 incubated with the PC/PE/SM (5:3:2) mixture induced fibril formation containing resinoid, branched tree structures (Fig. 2B). Hel 13-5 incubated with pure SM liposomes induced a mixture of ring-like structures and fibrils with diameters of ∼25 nm and lengths of ∼500 nm (Fig.2C). These fibrils were much shorter than those created by Hel 13-5 with pure neutral (PC) liposomes. Hel 13-5 incubated with a neutral/acidic liposome mixture PC/PG (3/1) at a high peptide/lipid ratio (3:1), also induced the formation of twisted tubular fibers with lengths greater than a few µm and with diameters of ∼25 nm (Fig.2D). With the mixture PC/PE/Ch (5:3:2), Hel 13-5 created curved fibril structures that exhibited surface bumps, mixed with large ring structures (Fig. 2E). The interaction of Hel 13-5 with a lipid mixture based on lung surfactant lipids, DPPC/PC/PG/PE (4:4:1:1) lead to the creation of a mixture of tubular and doughnut-type structures (Fig. 2F). Taken as a whole, the above data imply that Hel 13-5 induces a diverse array of lipid-specific nanotubular structures. Interestingly, a system composed of Hel 13-5 and a lipid mixture based on myelin lipids, Ch/PC/PE/PS/SM/cerebroside (43:9:12:5:10:21), did not form any fibril structures, thus demonstrating that tubule formation was not a universal phenomenon for Hel 13-5 (data not shown).Table IList of the lipid systems studiedLipid typeLipid componentsNeutral lipidsEgg PC, SM, Egg PC/egg PE (1:1)1-aThe numbers in parentheses are molar ratio of lipids., PC/PE/SM (5:3:2)PC/PE/Ch (5:3:2)Acidic lipidsPC/PG (3:1), PC/PS (3:1)Lung surfactant lipidsDPPC/PC/PG/PE (4/4/1/1)Golgi lipidsPC/PE/PS/PI/SM/Ch (50/10/5/6/7/17)Myelin lipidsCh/PE/SM/PS/SM/cerebroside (43/9/12/5/10/21)1-a The numbers in parentheses are molar ratio of lipids. Open table in a new tab Electron microscopy requires the use of an adsorbed or fixed sample. Thus, structures found this way cannot completely reflect the actual structures in solution, and these structures are the ones of interest. We previously reported that the formation of fibril structures by lipid-peptide complexes in solution can often be detected by the combination of a decrease in turbidity of neutral lipid (egg-PC) suspensions and an increase in mean diameter of the peptide-lipid complex, as measured by dynamic light scattering (6Kitamura A. Kiyota T. Tomohiro M. Umeda A. Lee S. Inoue T. Sugihara G. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 1457-1468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Based on this concept, mixed systems of Hel 13-5 with other lipids such as PE, SM, PS, PG, and Ch were examined in solution for the formation of nanotubular/fibril structures (Fig.3). The addition of Hel 13-5 to the PC/PE-mixed liposomes at ratio of 1:1 led to a decrease in turbidity of lipid suspension rapidly within 1 h at the low peptide concentrations (Fig. 3A). The solution-clearing ability of Hel 13-5 on this phospholipid mixture was much stronger than that of the Hel 13-5/PC pure liposome mixture. Addition of other neutral lipids such as SM or Ch to PC/PE liposomes (PC/PE/SM or PC/PE/Ch = 5:3:2) exhibited no significant difference in clearing ability as compared with those of PC/PE liposomes. In the case of SM alone, the turbidity of lipid suspension was slightly decreased with increasing concentration of Hel 13-5 (Fig.3A). A mixture PC/PE/Ch (5:3:2) and a mixture based on the lung surfactant lipids, DPPC/PC/PG/PE (4:4:1:1), did not show much of a decrease in liposome-turbidity with increasing concentration of Hel 13-5 (Fig. 3A). In general, solution turbidities either decreased or remained constant. The time-dependent changes in liposome size after the addition of the Hel 13-5 (20 µm) to several liposome solutions (100 µm) were then considered (Fig.3B). The sizes of PC liposomes and PC/PE-, PC/PE/SM-, and PC/PE/Ch-mixed liposomes increased with time in similar ways. On the other hand, the size of pure SM liposomes treated with Hel 13-5 increased more gradually than the other systems. These results are in agreement with the electron microscopy that showed that SM formed smaller size fibers. Overall, the turbidity and liposome size data were consistent with the electron microscopy data in the determination of fibril/nanotubule formation. We investigated the relationship between the peptide sequence and the fibril structure formation. In this regard, we designed and synthesized a set of Hel 13-5-related peptides as shown in Table II. All the peptides we designed adopted an amphipathic α-helix structure with a 240° hydrophobic sector. The peptides Hel 17-7 and Hel 8-4 were made to study the effect of chain length. Hel 13-5V, Hel 13-5Nle, and L9GHel 13-5 were created to look at the role of hydrophobicity. Hel 13-5R and E3Hel 13-5 were synthesized to consider the role of hydrophilicity. In addition, we considered KL4W, a transmembrane helical peptide evaluated as a therapeutic surfactant for respiratory distress syndrome (9Cochrane C.G. Revax S.D. Science. 1991; 254: 566-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). For simplicity, we began our evaluation of the peptides in an egg PC system. CD studies showed that Hels 13-5, 17-7, L9GHel 13-5, 13-5R and KL4W adopted α-helical structure, whereas Hels 8-4 and 13-5V took on β-strand structures in PC liposomes. Hel 13-5Nle and E3Hel 13-5, which have broad negative bands at 205–225 adopted a mixture of α-helix and β-structure in PC liposomes (Fig.4A).Table IIList of the Hel 3–5-related peptides studiedPeptideSequenceHel 13–5H-KLLKLLLKLWLKLLKLLL-OHHel 8–4H-KLLKL WLKLLLK-OHHel 17–7H-KLLKLLLKLWLKLLKLLLKLLKLL-OHL9GHel 13–5H-KLLKLLLKGWLKLLKLLL-OHHel 13–5NleH-KnnKnnnKnWnKnnKnnn-OH2-an, norleucine.Hel 13–5RH-RLLRLLLRLWLRLLRLLL-OHHel 13–5VH-KVVKVVVKVWVKVVKVVV-OHE3Hel 13–5H-ELLKLLLELWLKLLELLL-OHKL4WH-KLLLLKLLLLWLLLLKLLLLK-OHPeptides were synthesized by the Fmoc strategy based on the solid phase technique starting from Fmoc-PAL-PEG resin using the PerSeptive 9050 automatic peptide synthesizer.2-a n, norleucine. Open table in a new tab Peptides were synthesized by the Fmoc strategy based on the solid phase technique starting from Fmoc-PAL-PEG resin using the PerSeptive 9050 automatic peptide synthesizer. To determine the resulting structure of the lipid-peptide interaction, the mean diameter and change of turbidity of liposomes after the incubation of peptides with the liposomes at 25 °C were measured. The mean diameter increased drastically for Hels 13-5R and L9GHel 13-5, and gradually for Hel 13-5 Nle as shown in Fig. 4B. These results were consistent with electron micrographs that showed the former peptides formed long fibers and the latter one formed short ones (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 4C, the absorbances of L9Hel 13-5, Hel 13-5R, Hel 13-5Nle, and E3Hel 13-5 decreased drastically within 1 h and then reached a plateau at the peptide concentration of 20 µm (lipid/peptide = 5:1). This suggests that the size of vesicles became smaller than that of liposomes in the absence of peptides. Little change or a slight increase in turbidity, on the other hand, was observed for other peptides, suggesting a weaker or no interaction of the peptides with neutral liposomes. For Hel 13-5Nle, “immature” fibril-like structures formed (Fig. 4D), which were about 0.5–1 µm in length and 40 nm in diameter, much shorter than the structure formed by Hel 13-5. Interestingly, E3Hel 13-5 also created short fibril structures of about 300 nm in length and 50 nm in diameter, similar to Hel 13-5Nle (Fig. 4E). Both peptides created a mixture of α-helix and β-structures, indicating that the shape of the fibril may also depend on their secondary structure. No fibril structure was observed for the other peptides. Taken together, our results indicate that the chain length and the hydrophobic Leu residues of Hel 13-5 are critical to nanotubule formation, but the charged Lys residues in the hydrophilic region are replaceable by Arg or Glu residues. Experiments differing from the above only in the replacement of the egg PC liposomes with Golgi-specific phospholipid liposomes demonstrate similar trends (data not shown). We previously showed that Hel 13-5 adopts an α-helix structure when forming fibrils with egg-PC liposomes after 24 h incubation (6Kitamura A. Kiyota T. Tomohiro M. Umeda A. Lee S. Inoue T. Sugihara G. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 1457-1468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The structure of Hel 13-5 remained α-helical as it formed fibrils with mixed liposome systems such as PC/PE (1:1), PC/PE/SM (5:3:2), PC/PE/Ch (5:3:2), and PC/PG, indicating that the fiber structure does not result from a conformational change of the peptide itself to β-structure. In our systems, the formation of nanotubules depends on peptide properties, the lipid composition, and lipid/peptide ratio. This is also seen in nature, with generation of lipid nanodomains in intracellular organelles, and with the structural changes in membranes triggered by relevant protein/lipid components. For example, the characteristic features obtained by using SM liposomes (Fig.2C) and Ch-contained liposomes (Fig. 2E) might reflect the dynamic movement of specialized nanodomains, lipid rafts, which are enriched in sphingolipids and Ch, and have been implicated in several cellular functions (10Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8048) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the pulmonary surfactant system consisting of several lipid and protein components is packed together in dense lamellar bodies that, in the alveoli, are converted to a lattice of tubular myelin bilayers (11Perez-Gil J. Keough K.M.W. Biochim. Biophys,. Acta. 1999; 1408: 203-217Crossref Scopus (195) Google Scholar). We found that when the liposomes were prepared from the composition of the lung surfactant lipids, Hel 13-5 converted them into a mixture of fiber and doughnut-type structures (Fig. 2F). This result suggests that peptides like Hel 13-5 could be used to assist in the transformation of lung surfactant between the lung surface film and the tubular myelin. The conversion of spherical liposomes into tubules has been demonstrated in a complex cell-free system composed of brain lipid extract and the proteins dynamin and amphyphisin, which have been proposed to participate in the endocytosis of synaptic vesicles. The addition of these proteins to a brain lipid extract transformed spherical protein-free liposomes into narrow tubules (12Sweitzer S.M. Hinshaw J.E. Cell. 1998; 93: 1021-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar, 13Takei K. Slepnev V.L. Haucke V. De Camilli P. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Although brain extract is not a simple phospholipid model system, the narrow tubules obtained from that system are very similar to ours. The most striking result of our studies is that the short de novo-designed peptide Hel 13-5 interacts with a Golgi-specific lipid mixture to create Golgi apparatus-like nanotubules. Both the nanotubule length (600 nm) and diameter (∼40–50 nm) were on the order of Golgi apparatus tubules. Furthermore, the ends of the nanotubules were pinched off to narrow diameters of ∼2–3 nm, giving the tubules a remarkable morphological resemblance to the nanotubules of the Golgi apparatus. It suggests that the membrane-bound proteins of such an organelle must at some level have properties embodied in Hel 13-5,e.g. the formation of hydrophobic helixes. In various morphological studies, it has been shown that such membrane tubules are generated from the Golgi complex and trans Golgi network, and serve as bridging between cisternal stacks (3Weidman P. Roth R. Heuser J. Cell. 1993; 75: 123-133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 4Presley J.F. Smith C. Hirschberg K. Miller C. Cole N.B. Zaal K.J. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1617-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In addition to the precise role of these tubules in membrane trafficking events, the molecular mechanisms forming membrane tubules are not known. Our work provides a novel model system for the study of tubule formation in various intracellular events. Using this system, we have shown that lipid composition and peptide structure control nanotubule morphology. A thorough understanding of tubulation mechanisms will be critical to the creation of nanovesicular structures designed for example, to entrap and deliver drugs. Finally, although the question of precisely how nature engineers organellar membranes remains unknown, our approach provides a basic set of tools to begin addressing such questions."
https://openalex.org/W1975839922,"Development of skeletal cartilage is characterized with coupling growth arrest and cell differentiation. Here, to understand the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors involved in the progression of chondrogenic differentiation, we examined changes in the expression levels of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor members using mouse ATDC5 prechondrocytes as a widely used in vitro model of cartilage differentiation. Up-regulation of p21 andp27 mRNA was observed following a decrease in growth rate of prechondrocytes, and both transcripts subsequently accumulated during chondrogenic differentiation; p15, p18, and p19 mRNA, in contrast, did not change during differentiation. Only the up-regulation of p21 mRNA during differentiation was prevented by the continuous treatment of early chondrogenic inhibitor, parathyroid hormone, indicating a close correlation between differentiation and p21 induction in ATDC5 cells. Therefore, to examine the role of p21 during chondrogenesis, we established stable cell lines overexpressing full-length p21 antisense RNA in ATDC5. The reduction of endogenous p21 in these cell lines caused inhibition of early chondrogenic differentiation in ATDC5, indicating thatp21 gene plays an important role in this process of the cells in vitro. Furthermore, the level of p21 protein and p21·CDK2 complexes transiently increased during differentiation, but not in undifferentiated cells, leading to a decrease in CDK2-associated kinase. However, differentiation-dependent expressed p21 protein was degraded by a proteasome-dependent pathway. Thus, the progression of chondrogenic differentiation requires down-regulation of CDK2-associated kinase with an increase in p21 protein and subsequent degradation of this protein by a proteasomal pathway.

Their kinase activity is further modulated by cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs), which are classified into two families based on sequence homology and targets of CKI members (1Sherr C.J.

Recent reports have stated that some members of CKIs may function during the exit from the cell cycle and differentiation processes (12Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Overexpression of p21 and p27 has, in fact, promoted myogenesis, neurogenesis, and hematopoiesis (14Liu M. Lee M.H. Cohen M. Bommakanti M. Freedman L.P.

Biol. 1997; 17: 2933-2943Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), suggesting that some CKIs may have cell type-specific functions during differentiation. During chondrogenic differentiation, prechondrocytes differentiate to proliferating chondrocytes. As the rate of cell proliferation decreases, the chondrocytes begin to produce many extracellular matrix molecules, including type II and IX collagen, and aggrecan, and then finally cease to proliferate. The postmitotic chondrocytes terminally differentiate into hypertrophic chondrocytes, which produce type X collagen (19Howlett C.R. J. Anat. 1979; 128: 377-399PubMed Google Scholar, 20Stocum D.L. Davis R.M. Leger M. Conrad H.E. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1979; 54: 155-170PubMed Google Scholar). The progress of these differentiation processes requires crucial regulation by cytokines and hormones (21Hiraki Y. Inoue H. Hirai R. Kato Y. Suzuki F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 969: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 22Hiraki Y. Inoue H. Kato Y. Fukuya M. Suzuki F. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1987; 76: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, the intracellular mechanisms that regulate proliferation and differentiation programs are poorly understood. In this report, we examined the involvement of CKIs during chondrogenic differentiation, revealing that p21 gene expression was closely associated with early chondrogenic differentiation. To clarify whether the expression of p21 is required for differentiation, we established a cell line expressing antisense RNA of the p21 gene. It was shown that the cell line prevented the progression of chondrogenesis, indicating that p21 gene was directly involved in chondrogenic differentiation. Furthermore, down-regulation of CDK2-associated kinase during differentiation was accompanied by an increase in p21·CDK2 complexes in accordance with the amount of p21 protein, suggesting that p21 protein contributes to the inhibition of kinase activity during early chondrogenic differentiation. In addition, following a reduction in DNA synthesis, the expressed p21 protein is degraded via a proteasome-dependent pathway. Taken together, chondrogenesis may be promoted by p21 protein impairment of the CDK2-associated kinase and by post-translational modification of itself. Mouse ATDC5 prechondrocytes as a widely usedin vitro model of cartilage differentiation, were maintained in the absence of insulin, and were induced to chondrogenic cells by addition of differentiation medium containing insulin as described previously (23Atsumi T. Miwa Y. Kimata K. Ikawa Y. Cell Diff. Dev. 1990; 30: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 24Shukunami C. Shigeno C. Atsumi T. Ishizeki K. Suzuki F. Hiraki Y. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Briefly, ATDC5 cells at 6.4 × 103cells/cm2 were spread into tissue culture plates and cultured in maintenance medium, a medium consisting of a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum, 10 µg/ml human transferrin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 3 × 10−8msodium selenite (Sigma), at 37 °C, 5% CO2 (24Shukunami C. Shigeno C. Atsumi T. Ishizeki K. Suzuki F. Hiraki Y. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). To differentiate into chondrogenic cells, confluent cells were cultured long term period in differentiation medium, composed of maintenance medium containing 10 µg/ml bovine insulin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After 3 days, to inhibit chondrogenic differentiation, cells were continuously treated with 10−8mparathyroid hormone (PTH)-(1–34) (Peptide Institute, Inc.). Every fifth day, the degree of chondrogenesis was evaluated by alcian blue staining and examined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. Cells were cultured in maintenance medium or in differentiation medium containing 1 µCi/ml [methyl-3H]thymidine. After 4 h of incubation, they were fixed. Cells were then harvested, transferred onto a glass filter, and measured by liquid scintillation counter. Extraction and measurement of DNA contents were performed as described previously (25Schneider W.C. Methods Enzymol. 1957; 3: 680Crossref Scopus (1739) Google Scholar). Accumulation of sulfated glycosaminoglycan (GAG) by alcian blue staining was examined as reported elsewhere (26Asahina I. Sampath T.K. Hauschka P.V. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 222: 38-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The degree of chondrogenic differentiation was evaluated by measuring the amount of extractable dye. The value was normalized against 1 µg of DNA from each culture. Anti-p21 polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and Oncogene Research (Cambridge, MA). Anti-p27 monoclonal antibody was purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Anti-CDK2 polyclonal antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Mouse p21 cDNA was provided by B. Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, Baltimore, MD). pcDNA3 vector was purchased from Invitrogen (Invitrogen, CA). pcDNA3/ASp21 plasmid DNA was constructed as follows; the mouse p21 cDNA (both ends are EcoRI sites) was introduced in the antisense orientation, downstream (EcoRI site) of the CMV promoter of pcDNA3. This constructed pcDNA3/ASp21 was able to express complemental antisense RNA versus mouse p21 cDNA in mammalian cells. Total RNA was extracted from the long term cultured cells using the acid guanidinium isothiocyanate method (27Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63230) Google Scholar). The RT reactions were performed as previously reported (28Negishi Y. Kudo A. Obinata A. Kawashima K. Hirano H. Yanai N. Obinata M. Endo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 450-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The PCR conditions for type II collagen gene were 94 °C for 1 min, 56 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 3 min for 20–24 cycles (29Abe N. Yoshioka H. Inoue H. Ninomiya Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1204: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The other PCRs were performed at 94 °C for 1 min, 56 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 3 min for 20–35 cycles in the linear range of the amplification cycle number, which was determined empirically in each case. Subsequently, the PCR products were loaded on 1–2% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide. p15, p16,p19, type II collagen, type X collagen, and β-actingene primers were used as reported previously (28Negishi Y.

The sequences of other primers are listed as follows: p18 (forward: 5′-GGACACTGTACAGGCTTTGC; reverse: 5′-TTCCATAGAACCTGGCCAAG), p21 (forward: 5′-AATCCTGGTGATGTCCGACC; reverse: 5′-TTGCAGAAGACCAATCTGCG), andp27 (forward: 5′-TATGGAAGAAGCGAGTCAGC; reverse: 5′-GCGAAGAAGAATCTTCTGCAG). To establish stable cell lines expressing antisense RNA versus mouse p21 gene, transfections with pcDNA3/ASp21 or pcDNA3 by lipofection methods 2K. Maruyama, manuscript in preparation. were performed. Liposome solutions (16 nmol of TMAG liposome (Daiichi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.), 256 µg of transferrin (Wako), 16 µg of salmon protamine sulfate (Sigma) were mixed with 8 µg of plasmid DNA (pcDNA3/ASp21 or pcDNA3), added to a 10-cm dish of 80% confluent culture ATDC5 cells in maintenance medium, incubated for 5 h, then washed with maintenance medium, and cultured for an additional 48 h. Following the additional incubation, cells were replated at 4.1 × 103 cells/cm2 and further cultured in medium containing 100 µg/ml G418 (Geneticin; Wako) for 10 days. The expression of antisense RNA derived from p21 cDNA in each clone was confirmed using specific primers to RT-PCR. The primers used were as follows: forward, 5′- TTGCAGAAGACCAATCTGCG (derived from mousep21 gene); reverse, 5′-CGAGCTCTAGCATTTAGGTG (partially derived from bovine growth hormone poly(A)+ sequence (bases 1008–1027) in pcDNA3). To examine stable integration of transfected DNA in each clone, genomic DNA was extracted from cell lines using DNAzol reagents (Life Technologies, Inc.). Using specific primers forβ-lactamasegene in pcDNA3 vector, and 100 ng of genomic DNA from each clone, PCR analysis was performed for 35 cycles as shown under “RT-PCR.” The primers used were as follows: forward, 5′-CCGTCGTGTAGATAACTACG; reverse, 5′-TCTTACGGATGGCATGACAG. Both primers were derived from β-lactamasegene in pcDNA3 vector. Cultured cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Whole cell lysate was prepared with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmNa3VO4, 10 µg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 45 µg/ml aprotinin). The protein concentration of cell lysates was determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), and equal amounts of protein from each time point were used for Western blots, immunoprecipitation-Western blots, or kinase assay. Fifty micrograms of whole cell lysate was separated by 13.5% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). Blots were blocked overnight at 4 °C in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% skim milk. After blocking, blots were incubated overnight in a 1:1000 dilution of primary antibody, followed by a 1:5000 dilution of anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibody. Blots were developed with an ECL detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and exposed. Used blots were stripped according to the ECL protocol. This was followed by reprobing with a subsequent primary antibody. For immunoprecipitation, 500 µg of whole cell lysate was incubated with 10 µl of anti-CDK2 rabbit polyclonal antibody for 1.5 h at 4 °C. Protein G-Sepharose beads were added for 1.5 h, and complexes were washed four times with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. Immune complexes were run on 13.5% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). Blots were managed according to Western blot methods as described under “Western Blots.” To measure CDK2-associated kinase activity, immunoprecipitates by anti-CDK2 polyclonal antibody were washed four times, resuspended in 7 µl of assay dilution buffer (20 mm MOPS (pH 7.2), 25 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 7 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP). Seven microliters of inhibitor mixture (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) and 1.5 µg of recombinant GST-RB (Santa Cruz) or histone H1 (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) were then added to the immunoprecipitates, and subsequently the mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction mixtures were analyzed on SDS-PAGE gels and exposed to x-ray film. The CDK2-associated kinase activities were measured by phosphorimaging analysis. Lactacystin and carbobenzoxy-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-l-leucinal (MG-132) were purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA).trans-Epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido(4-guanidino)-butane (E64) was purchased from Sigma Japan. Cells were treated for 24 h with lactacystin (3 µm final), MG132 (3 µmfinal), or E64 (10 µm final). All compounds were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), which did not exceed 1% of the assay medium concentration. First, to examine the relationship between cell growth and differentiation in ATDC5 cells, undifferentiated ATDC5 cells were cultured in maintenance medium until confluent (culture day 0 as shown in Fig.1) and were then further cultivated in maintenance or differentiation medium. [3H]Thymidine incorporation of induced and uninduced ATDC5 cells were compared (Fig.1 A). At day 1, thymidine incorporation increased under differentiation medium, and then decreased by day 13, where DNA synthesis reached a low and was maintained for 2 weeks. On the other hand, DNA synthesis of uninduced cells directly decreased. Therefore, the temporal elevation and subsequent decrease of DNA synthesis may be necessary to promote chondrogenic differentiation or to maintain differentiated chondrocytes. Indeed, the decrease of thymidine incorporation by day 8 in differentiation medium accompanied the increase in expression of type II collagengene as a gene marker of early chondrogenic differentiation (Fig. 1 B). Around day 12, cell growth completely ceased, and expression oftype X collagengene as a gene marker of late chondrogenic differentiation, was observed (Fig. 1 B). It has been reported that cell cycle progression is controlled by cyclin·CDK protein kinase where phosphorylating activity can be modulated by functionally and structurally distinct CKIs (1Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar). To identify the CKIs involved in the progression of chondrogenic differentiation, we compared changes in CKI gene expression levels in ATDC5 prechondrocytes cultured in maintenance and differentiation medium, by RT-PCR analysis using specific primers.p15, p18, and p19 mRNA showed no remarkable change after chondrogenic induction (Fig. 1 B). Expression of p16 gene was not observed by RT-PCR analysis (data not shown). An increase in p21 and p27mRNA was observed at day 5, and both transcripts subsequently accumulated during chondrogenic differentiation (Fig. 1 B). The onset of the increase coincided with the abrupt decrease in the growth rate of prechondrocytes (Fig. 1 A). Expression ofp21 and p27 genes was seen prior to the up-regulation of gene marker, type II collagen(8–12 days), in early chondrogenic differentiation (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, expression of p21 and p27 genes changed little in ATDC5 prechondrocytes cultured for a long period in maintenance medium, and no expression of chondrogenic gene markers was observed. To examine whether the up-regulation of CKIgenes was associated with the progress of chondrogenic differentiation, we investigated the effect of PTH, which inhibits the progression of early chondrogenesis (24Shukunami C. Shigeno C. Atsumi T. Ishizeki K. Suzuki F. Hiraki Y. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 33Shukunami C. Ohta Y. Sakuda M. Hiraki Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 241: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), upon the up-regulation of these genes during differentiation. Fig.2A shows PTH completely inhibited synthesis of glycosaminoglycan, a marker of chondrogenic differentiation, as estimated by alcian blue staining. In addition totype II collagenmRNA, the increase of p21mRNA, detected in days 8, 13, and 18, was prevented by continuous treatment with PTH. Unlike p21 gene, expression ofp15, p18, p19, and p27mRNA changed little after chondrogenic inhibition (Fig.2 B). These results suggest that the expression ofp21 gene is closely associated with chondrogenic differentiation. To clarify whether the expression of p21 is required for progression of chondrogenic differentiation in ATDC5 cells, we established a cell line expressing antisense RNA of thep21 gene. An expression vector (pcDNA3/ASp21) was constructed, and was transfected into mouse ATDC5 cells by lipofection as shown under “Materials and Methods.” Genomic-PCR analysis showed that established cell lines (empty clones 1 and 2 or ASp21 clones 1 and 2) contained the pcDNA3/ASp21 expression vector or the pcDNA3 vector as amplicons derived from β-lactamasegene were detected (Fig. 3A). Semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that p21 antisense RNA repressed the up-regulation of p21 mRNA during chondrogenic differentiation, and resulted in inhibited progression of early differentiation in chondrocytes because the increase oftype II collagengene expression and the synthesis of GAG during chondrogenesis were repressed (Fig. 3, B andC). These results indicate that endogenousp21 gene expression is required for the progression of early chondrocyte differentiation. The CIP/KIP family, including p21, controls various cell growth by inhibiting CDK2-associated kinase (1Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar). Therefore, to understand the mechanism by which p21 regulates the differentiation, protein analysis was performed. Similar top21 mRNA, the amount of protein increased up to day 9 after chondrogenic induction, and thereafter the amount of expressed protein immediately decreased (Fig.4A). Increase of p21 protein, however, was not observed when ATDC5 cells were cultured in maintenance medium, whereas protein levels of CDK2, which is a target of p21 and/or p27 protein, changed little during long term culture in maintenance or differentiation medium. By immunoprecipitation using anti-CDK2 polyclonal antibody, we also assessed whether CDK2·p21 protein complexes were formed during the differentiation process (Fig. 4 B). These complexes increased up to day 9 and then decreased abruptly. The formation of the complexes may depend upon the amount of p21 protein, because this change coincided with that of p21 protein by Western blot analysis. Furthermore, to confirm whether CDK2-associated kinase activities were regulated by p21 protein during chondrogenic differentiation, we performed a CDK2-associated kinase assay using recombinant RB or H1 protein as a substrate for CDK2. The kinase activities of CDK2 protein decreased up to day 13 of culture (Fig. 4 C). This down-regulation of the kinase correlated with a reduction in DNA synthesis during differentiation as shown in Fig. 1. Unlike the p21 protein, p27 protein and CDK2·p27 complexes accumulated following a gradual increase up to culture days 9–13 in differentiation medium, but not in maintenance medium (Fig. 4, A andB). To further examine whether p21 protein is repressed by p21antisense RNA expression under differentiation medium, Western blot analysis was performed. Similar to the inhibition of endogenousp21 mRNA expression as shown in Fig. 3, protein production in ASp21 clone was repressed throughout long term culture in differentiation medium (Fig.5A). By immunoprecipitation using anti-CDK2 polyclonal antibody, we also assessed whether CDK2·p21 protein complexes were formed during long term culture in differentiation medium (Fig. 5 B). CDK2·p21 complexes were formed at very low level dependent on the amount of p21 protein. Furthermore, to confirm whether CDK2-associated kinase activities were affected by the repression of p21 protein in ASp21 clone under differentiation medium, we performed a CDK2-associated kinase assay as shown in Fig. 5 C. The kinase activities of CDK2 protein in ASp21 clone decreased up to day 3 of culture (Fig. 5 C). However, 3 days later, the kinase activities of CDK2 were maintained throughout long term culture (Fig. 5 C), whereas in empty clone, the kinase activities of CDK2 protein were completely inhibited at day 13 of culture. Unlike the p21 protein, p27 protein and CDK2·p27 complexes accumulated in differentiation medium. The protein level, however, changed little during long term culture. Post-transcribed p21 mRNA accumulated during chondrogenic differentiation, but its protein level transiently increased, suggesting possible post-translational modification of this protein. p21 protein is a substrate for proteasome-dependent degradation (34Blagosklonny M.V.

Biol. 1997; 17: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Therefore, to examine whether the proteasome-dependent pathway is involved in the decrease of p21 during chondrogenic differentiation, Western blot analysis was performed. Addition of MG 132 and lactacystin, proteasome inhibitors (36Traenckner E.B. Wilk S. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5433-5441Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 37Jensen T.J.

Kembhavi A.A. Brown M.A. Kirschke H. Knight C.G. Tamai M. Hanada K. Biochem. J. 1982; 201: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar), had no effect on the amount of p21. Although p27 protein has been known to be regulated by a proteasome pathway (41Pagano M. Tam S.W. Theodoras A.M. Beer-Romero P. Del Sal G. Chau V. Yew P.R. Draetta G.F. Rolfe M. Science. 1995; 269: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1735) Google Scholar), protein expression was not affected by both proteasome inhibitors. Treatment with proteasome inhibitors did not lead to an increase in expression of p21 and p27 mRNA (Fig. 6 B). These results suggest that a specific proteasome-mediated pathway contributes to decreased expression of p21 protein during chondrogenesis. First, to understand the CKIs associated with the progression of chondrogenic differentiation, here, we examined changes in the expression levels of CKI members using mouse ATDC5 prechondrocytes. After induction of differentiation, the growth of prechondrocytes decreased and, at the same time, the expression of p21 andp27 mRNA increased. The expression of p21 andp27 mRNA preceded the up-regulation of early-chondrogenic marker, type II collagengene. To confirm whether the up-regulation of both p21 and p27genes was associated with the progression of chondrogenic differentiation, we investigated the effect of PTH, which inhibits the progression of early chondrogenesis (24Shukunami C. Shigeno C. Atsumi T. Ishizeki K. Suzuki F. Hiraki Y. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 33Shukunami C. Ohta Y. Sakuda M. Hiraki Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 241: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). PTH caused a decrease inp21 but not p27 gene expression elevated by the differentiation condition. It thus indicated a close correlation between differentiation and p21 induction. To clarify whether the expression of p21 is required for progression of chondrogenic differentiation in ATDC5 cells, we established stable cell lines, which constitutively overexpressed full-length p21 antisense RNA in ATDC5. The established cell lines showed that abrogation of endogenous p21 gene in ATDC5 prevented the progression of chondrogenesis, as seen by repressed type II collagenexpression and GAG synthesis during chondrogenesis. These results indicate that the expression of p21 gene is required for the progression of chondrogenesis in ATDC5 cells. To understand the mechanism by which p21 is involved in chondrogenic differentiation, we further performed protein analysis in relation to p21 protein. From the immunoprecipitation analysis using anti-CDK2 polyclonal antibody, we found that CDK2·p21 complexes increase by day 9 and that the amount of p21 protein increases and subsequently decreases during chondrogenic differentiation. Moreover, by CDK2-associated kinase assay, we found that the kinase activities of CDK2 protein greatly diminished up to culture day 13. The down-regulation of CDK2-associated kinase activities correlated with the reduction of DNA synthesis during chondrogenic differentiation. These results demonstrated that p21 forms a complex with CDK2 and contributes to the reduction of CDK2-associated kinase activity, resulting in the reduction of the growth rate of prechondrocytes before the expression of chondrogenic differentiation markers. In addition, p21 protein expression at early stages of differentiation was very high, but its expression during long term culture in maintenance condition was still low, suggesting that p21 protein induction is specific in manner and important for the early stage of the differentiation process. These notions were also supported by protein analysis using ASp21 clone, because induction of p21 protein was completely inhibited and the CDK2-associated kinase activity after 3 days of culture in differentiation medium was maintained, leading to inhibited progression of chondrogenesis. On the other hand, the amount of p27 is consistent with that of CDK2·p27 complexes, gradually increasing up to cultured days 9–13 of the differentiation process. This suggests that p27 protein also contributes to the impaired kinase activities during chondrogenesis. In contrast to the transient increase of p21 protein, the stable accumulation of p27 protein following the reduction of DNA synthesis suggests that p27 protein may contribute to growth arrest and differentiation. If so, how is the p27 protein engaged in chondrogenesis? It is possible that (a) p27 protein may co-operate with p21 in growth control in early stages of chondrogenesis, or (b) p27 protein may contribute to maintain permanent growth arrest over the later stages of differentiation because of reduced p21 protein levels at that time. The former may be unlikely because an early chondrogenic inhibitor did not inhibit p27 mRNA expression. Therefore, after growth arrest by p21 protein in early stages of differentiation, p27 protein may maintain growth arrest and may not allow re-proliferation through permanent inhibition of CDK2-associated kinase over the later stages of differentiation, leading to the progression of chondrogenesis. This notion may be supported by reports that p27 protein accumulates in the quiescent state of terminally differentiated cells, which showed an impaired CDK-associated kinase (14Liu M. Lee M.H. Cohen M. Bommakanti M. Freedman L.P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 142-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar, 42Halevy O. Novitch B.G. Spicer D.B. Skapek S.X. Rhee J. Hannon G.J. Beach D Lassar A.B.

Farmer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17088-17097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Thus, the regulation of CDK2 kinase by both p21 and p27 protein may be required for the growth arrest and the maintenance of post-mitotic cells during chondrogenic differentiation. The amount of p21 protein increased transiently during differentiation and thereafter markedly decreased, whereas post-transcribed p21 mRNA accumulated during chondrogenic differentiation. p21 protein is a substrate for proteasome-dependent degradation (34Blagosklonny M.V.

Biol. 1997; 17: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether the proteasome-dependent pathway is involved in the decrease of p21 during chondrogenic differentiation. Proteasome inhibitors such as MG132 and lactacystin (36Traenckner E.B. Wilk S. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5433-5441Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 37Jensen T.J. Loo M.A. Pind S.

Transient expression of p21 was also observed during adipocyte and myocyte differentiation (43Franklin D.S. Xiong Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1587-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar,44Morrison R.F. Farmer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17088-17097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In addition, p21 is decreased by a proteasomal pathway in terminal differentiated keratinocytes, and forced expression of p21 in these cells inhibited terminal differentiation (45Di Cunto F. Topley G. Calautti E. Hsiao J. Ong L. Seth P.K. Dotto G.P. Science. 1998; 280: 1069-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Thus, the degradation of p21 protein by proteasome in early chondrogenic differentiation may be required to permit progression toward the later stages of differentiation. It is likely that p21 plays important roles in chondrogenic differentiation; however, there is a discrepancy since mice lacking p21 appear to develop normally (46Deng C. Zhang P. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Leder P. Cell. 1995; 82: 675-684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1949) Google Scholar). However, there is a marked tendency to use multiple pathways for important processes in nature, a redundancy that may confuse simple interpretations of a null-mutation analysis (47Weintraub H. Cell. 1993; 75: 1241-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). Therefore, in p21 knock-out mice, cell-cell interactions or other unknown factor(s) derived from other tissue may provide compensating processes for the normal development of cartilage even with the lack of p21 action. Our results suggest that the increase of p21 protein and the resulting depression of CDK2-associated kinase are essential for early stages of chondrogenesis and the degradation of p21 protein by a proteasome pathway in the later stages of differentiation is also prerequisite for the differentiation of chondrocytes.

These include eIF4G, a modular scaffolding protein, and eIF4A, an RNA helicase, of which two closely related forms are known in mammals, eIF4AI and eIF4AII. In mammals, eIF4G possesses two independent sites for binding eIF4A, whereas in other eukaryotes (e.g. yeast) only one site appears to be present, thus raising the issue of the stoichiometry of eIF4G·eIF4A complexes in different eukaryotes. We show that in human embryonic kidney cells eIF4G is associated with eIF4AI or eIF4AII but not with both simultaneously, suggesting a stoichiometry of 1:1 rather than 1:2. To confirm this, eIF4AI or eIF4AII was expressed in a tagged form in these cells, and complexes with eIF4G were again isolated. Complexes containing tagged eIF4AI or eIF4AIIcontained no endogenous eIF4A, supporting the notion that eIF4G binds only one molecule of eIF4A. Each binding site in eIF4G can bind either eIF4AI or eIF4AII. The data imply that the second binding site in mammalian eIF4A does not bind an additional eIF4A molecule and that initiation factor complexes in different eukaryotes contain one eIF4A per eIF4G. mRNA translation in eukaryotic cells involves a set of proteins termed translation initiation factors (eIFs), several of which are involved in the binding of ribosomes to mRNA.

Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid polymerase chain reaction polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Translation of mRNA in mammalian cells involves a set of proteins termed “translation factors.” A number of the proteins are involved in the initiation phase of translation, the main control point in this process, and are accordingly termed “initiation factors” (eIFs).1 Several of the eIFs play a role in the recruitment of mRNAs to ribosomes and in the events leading to the recognition of the initiation codon. One such protein is eIF4A, an ATP-dependent RNA helicase of the “DEAD-box” family (1Gingras A.-C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Annu. Rev.

It is thought to act to remove regions of secondary structure within the 5′-untranslated region of the mRNA to facilitate ribosome binding and scanning (1Gingras A.-C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Annu.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1205-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), eIF4A appears to be essential for cap-dependent and also for cap-independent initiation directed by picornavirus internal ribosome entry sites. eIF4A interacts with a scaffold protein, eIF4G, to form complexes that also contain the cap-binding protein eIF4E, which binds the cap structure (m7GpppN … ) at the 5′-end of the mRNA (for reviews see Refs. 1Gingras A.-C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 913-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1761) Google Scholar and 5Pain V.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 747-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar)). These complexes are termed “eIF4F.” eIF4A shows much higher helicase activity as part of such complexes than as free eIF4A (6Rozen F. Edery I. Meerovitch K. Dever T.E. Merrick W.C. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1134-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Three related proteins have been designated as distinct forms of eIF4A. eIF4AI and eIF4AII are closely related and are both known to be cytoplasmic and to interact with eIF4G (7Conroy S.C. Dever T.E. Owens C.L. Merrick W.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 282: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Some evidence for a preferential association of eIF4G with eIF4AII as compared with eIF4AI was presented (7Conroy S.C. Dever T.E. Owens C.L. Merrick W.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 282: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). More recently, a further protein termed eIF4AIII has been identified and reported to inhibit translation (8Li Q. Imataka H. Morino S. Rogers G.W. Richter-Cook N.J. Merrick W.C. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7336-7346Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). However, this protein is more distantly related and appears to be primarily nuclear (9Holzmann K. Gerner C. Pöltl A. Schäfer R. Obrist P. Ensinger C. Grimm R. Sauermann G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 339-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Its involvement in translation initiation has therefore been questioned (8Li Q. Imataka H. Morino S. Rogers G.W.

Recently, two independent binding sites were identified within mammalian eIF4G for eIF4A (10Imataka H. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6940-6947Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). One lies in the central region of eIF4G whereas the other lies toward its C terminus (10Imataka H. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6940-6947Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 11Lamphear B.J. Kirchweger R. Skern T. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol.

Biol. 2000; 20: 468-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In contrast, both species of yeast eIF4G lack the C-terminal domain that interacts with eIF4A and thus appear to contain only one site for interaction with this factor within the central region of the yeast eIF4G polypeptide (13Neff C.L. Sachs A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5557-5564Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 14Dominguez D. Altmann M. Benz J. Baumann U. Trachsel H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26720-26726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Mammalian eIF4A can interact with the remaining site in the central region of eIF4G (15Dominguez D. Kislig E. Altmann M. Trachsel H. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 223-230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but cannot functionally replace the yeast eIF4A gene (16Prat A. Schmid S.R. Buser P. Blum S. Trachsel H. Nielsen P.J. Linder P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1050: 140-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Recent data from Morino et al. (12Morino S. Imataka H. Svitkin Y.V. Pestova T.V. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 468-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) suggest that the C-terminal region of mammalian eIF4G may function as a modulatory domain. The existence of two eIF4A binding sites in eIF4G suggested that mammalian eIF4F may contain two copies of eIF4A, and a recent report from Korneeva et al. (17Korneeva N.L. Lamphear B.J. Hennigan F.L.C. Merrick W.C. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2872-2879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) using surface plasmon resonance to explore eIF4G/eIF4A interactions in vitrooffered support to this idea. If true in vivo, this could reflect a fundamental difference in the composition and function of eIF4F complexes in mammals compared to eukaryotes, given that yeast eIF4G only possesses one site for binding eIF4A (13Neff C.L. Sachs A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5557-5564Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 14Dominguez D. Altmann M. Benz J. Baumann U. Trachsel H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26720-26726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We therefore considered it important to study the interactions between mammalian eIF4G and eIF4A in vivo, and our data indicate that in fact eIF4G can only bind one molecule of eIF4A at a time underin vivo conditions. Thus, eIF4F complexes in yeast and mammals do not appear to differ in their eIF4A content, despite the presence in mammalian eIF4G of the second eIF4A binding site. General laboratory chemicals were from Sigma-Aldrich (Gillingham, United Kingdom) or BDH Merck (Dorset, UK). Materials for cell culture were from Life Technologies, Inc. m7GTP-Sepharose was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.Oligonucleotides were synthesized from MWG Biotech (Milton Keynes, UK). Restriction enzymes were purchased from either Promega (Southampton, UK) or New England Biolabs (Hitchin, UK). Polyclonal antibodies were generated by immunizing sheep (Diagnostics Scotland) with the appropriate peptide immunogen coupled (via the C-terminal cysteinyl residue) to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Antibodies were purified over columns consisting of the relevant peptide coupled to Affi-Gel (Bio-Rad). Peptides used were as follows, the C-terminal Cys being used for coupling: ASQDSRSRDNGPDAC (residues 3–16 of human eIF4AI); GGSADYNREHGGPEC (residues 3–16 of human eIF4AII) and NRENYIHRIGRGGRFGRKC (sequence common to eIF4AI (residues 352–369) and eIF4AII (residues 354–371)). The anti-eIF4GI antisera were raised in a similar manner using the following peptides as immunogens: for the middle domain of eIF4GI, LKEELEEARDIARRC (corresponding to residues 841–854), and for the C-terminal domain of eIF4GI, RARTPATKRSFSKEVEC (residues 1137–1152). pETHM-eIF4AI and pETHM-eIF4AII are vectors encoding His- and Myc-tagged eIF4AI and eIF4AII, respectively. pETHM-eIF4AI was made by ligating anNheI-KpnI-digested PCR fragment encoding the N terminus of eIF4AI and a KpnI-SalI fragment from pGem3Z-4A into the NheI-SalI sites of pET28b (Novagen). The PCR primers used to generate the N terminus of eIF4AI were 5′-ATGGCTAGCGAACAAAAACTCATCTCAGAAGAGGATCTGGGATCCATGTCTGCGAGTCAG GATTC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGCCAGGGGTACCCACGATGAT-3′ (reverse). The upstream primer provides a BamHI site (underlined) between the Myc-tag and the start codon of eIF4A to facilitate further cloning. pETHM-eIF4AII was made by ligating aBamHI-SpeI-digested PCR fragment of N-terminal eIF4AII and a SpeI-SacI fragment from p4AIIms (a kind gift from P. Nielsen (18Nielsen P.J. Trachsel H. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2097-2105Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar)) into theBamHI-SacI sites of pETHM. pETHM is a modified version of the expression vector pET28, containing a Myc-tag instead of the T7-tag found in pET28. It was made by replacing theSphI-BamHI region of pET28 with theSphI-BamHI fragment from pETHM-eIF4AI. The primers used for amplification of the N terminus of eIF4AII were 5′-ACGGATTCATGTCTGGTGGCTCCGCG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTGAGCCAGTTCTCTGGTGGG-3′ (reverse). For expression in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, the vector pcDNA3.1(+) was used. pETHM-eIF4AI was cut with XbaI for insertion into the NheI site of pcDNA3.1(+), and pETHM-eIF4AII was cut with XbaI/NotI for insertion into the corresponding sites of pcDNA3.1(+). Similarly, expression plasmids for fragments of eIF4GI were created by cutting pET-eIF4GI-M (kindly provided by Dr. C. U. T. Hellen, SUNY, Brooklyn, NY) withXbaI/XhoI (insertion into pcDNA3.1(+) between the NheI-XhoI sites) and by cutting pET-eIF4GI-C (also from Dr. Hellen) withXbaI/HindIII for insertion into the same sites of pcDNA3.1(+). To prepare recombinant eIF4A proteins, Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)LysS cells were transformed separately with pETHM-eIF4AI or -eIF4AII, and expression was induced by 1 mmisopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside. After induction (4 h, 25 °C) and cell lysis (by sonication), the tagged proteins were purified in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mmNaCl, 20 mm imidazole on Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA)-agarose (Qiagen). Proteins were eluted with 250 mmimidazole in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl and then dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline containing 20% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), and 1 mmdithiothreitol. HEK 293 cells were maintained and transfected (20–30 µg of DNA/10-cm dish) as described earlier (19Scheper G.C. Morrice N.A. Proud C.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 743-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The extractions were performed using our standard buffer (19Scheper G.C. Morrice N.A. Proud C.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 743-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), except that for Ni-NTA-agarose pulldown experiments the EDTA concentration was decreased from 1 to 0.2 mm. For immunoprecipitations, 3 µl of antisera for eIF4AI or eIF4AII were mixed with 10 µl (packed volume) of protein G-agarose in extraction buffer for 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were then washed with extraction buffer and mixed with cell lysates (about 500 µg of protein). Gel electrophoresis and Western blotting were performed as described earlier (20Price N.T. Nakielny S.F. Clark S.J. Proud C.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1008: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) using gels containing 12.5% (w/v) acrylamide and Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). The main aim of this study was to investigate the composition of eIF4F complexes in vivo in mammalian cells. To determine whether HEK 293 cells express both eIF4AI and eIF4AII, we made use of antisera that specifically recognize these proteins. The antisera were raised against peptides corresponding to residues within the N termini of eIF4AIand eIF4AII, which are completely different between the two polypeptides (see “Materials and Methods”). To verify that the antisera were indeed specific for each protein and to compare their potencies, we studied their abilities to recognize recombinant eIF4AI and eIF4AII in Western blots. The anti-eIF4AI antibody recognized eIF4AI but showed no reaction with eIF4AII, whereas the converse was true for the anti-eIF4AII antibody (Fig.1 A). Both proteins were recognized by a third antibody raised against a peptide sequence common to the C termini of both proteins. The antisera were calibrated using differing amounts of recombinant eIF4AI and eIF4AII (Fig. 1 B). The anti-eIF4ACantibody should detect each form equally, and this was borne out by the data in the upper part of Fig. 1 B, where a signal of similar strength was seen for the same amounts of the two proteins. In the lower part of Fig. 1 B it can be seen that similar signals were seen for 150 ng of eIF4AI and 75 ng of eIF4AII (and so on for the three amounts of protein tested) indicating that the anti-eIF4AII antibody is roughly twice as sensitive as the antibody to eIF4AI. Western blot analysis using the specific antibodies revealed that both eIF4AI and eIF4AII are present in HEK 293 cells (Fig. 1 C). In the cell extracts, the strengths of the signals for eIF4AI and eIF4AII were similar suggesting (given the data in Fig. 1 B) that the level of eIF4AI is probably slightly (about 2-fold) higher than that of eIF4AII. Cells were treated with insulin for 20 min prior to extraction to enhance the formation of eIF4F complexes (21Herbert T.P. Kilhams G.R. Batty I.H. Proud C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11249-11256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Samples of cell extract were also subjected to chromatography on m7GTP-Sepharose. This resin binds eIF4E, and thus eIF4A that is part of eIF4F complexes is also retained on the resin through the interaction of eIF4A with eIF4G. Western blotting with the above antibodies revealed that both eIF4AI and eIF4AII were found in the material retained on this resin, showing that both eIF4AI and eIF4AII become incorporated into eIF4F. The signals for eIF4AI and eIF4AII were again similar, suggesting that a similar proportion of each is incorporated into eIF4F complexes (Fig.1 C). Because eIF4G possesses two independent binding sites for eIF4A (10Imataka H. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6940-6947Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), it was possible that eIF4F complexes could contain a mixture of these species of eIF4A. To address this possibility, material retained on m7GTP-Sepharose was eluted (with m7GDP) and then subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-eIF4AI or anti-eIF4AII. The analysis clearly revealed that the resulting immunoprecipitates contained only the isoform of eIF4A against which the antibody was raised and that the other species of eIF4A was absent (Fig. 1 C). Immunoprecipitates contained full-length eIF4G, thus ruling out the possibility that the eIF4G had been degraded to produce fragments that contained only one eIF4A binding site (Fig. 1 C, top section). This finding indicates that individual eIF4F complexes do not contain a mixture of eIF4AI and eIF4AII. Two possible explanations can be advanced to explain this observation: (i) eIF4F complexes each contain only one molecule of eIF4A or (ii) each complex may contain two molecules of eIF4A but these must both be either eIF4AI or eIF4AII. To distinguish between these possibilities, HEK 293 cells were transfected with vectors encoding eIF4AI or eIF4AII, each possessing Myc and hexahistidine (His6) tags. Transfection experiments using a vector encoding the green fluorescent protein revealed that the transfection efficiencies were routinely about 95% (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2, these tagged forms of eIF4A are expressed efficiently in HEK 293 cells, as assessed using the antiserum that recognizes both forms of eIF4A and at levels rather above those of the endogenous factors. eIF4F complexes were isolated from cells transfected with eIF4AI-Myc/His6 or eIF4AII-Myc/His6. Western blotting showed that this material contained both endogenous eIF4A and the recombinant tagged polypeptide, which migrates more slowly because of the tags. The eluted material was subjected to chromatography on Ni-NTA agarose, and the bound material was analyzed by immunoblotting using the anti-eIF4AC antibody. Only the recombinant tagged eIF4A was detected, and none of the endogenous eIF4A was seen. This finding strongly suggests that the eIF4F complexes contain only one molecule of eIF4A. If complexes had contained two molecules of eIF4A, the endogenous protein would also have been seen in the Ni-NTA agarose-bound fraction. The above data support the idea that eIF4G just binds a single eIF4A molecule, either eIF4AI or eIF4AII. They therefore imply that each of the two binding sites for eIF4A on eIF4G can bind either to eIF4AI or eIF4AII and that a single eIF4A molecule might bind simultaneously to both sites. It has, however, not previously been shown that eIF4AIIbinds both sites in eIF4G. To test this, HEK 293 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding the middle (“eIF4GM”) and C-terminal (“eIF4GC”) fragments of eIF4G. These polypeptides include His6 and Myc tags and were efficiently expressed in HEK 293 cells (Fig.3 A). Samples of extract from these cells were subjected to chromatography on Ni-NTA-agarose, and the bound material was analyzed by SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting. The tagged eIF4G fragments were clearly retained on the resin (Fig.3 A), whereas full-length, untagged eIF4G was not (data not shown). Analysis of the Ni-NTA-agarose-bound material showed that eIF4A was retained on this resin when either of the tagged eIF4G fragments was expressed but not in the absence of these fragments. eIF4A does not therefore bind nonspecifically to the resin (Fig. 3 B). To determine whether both forms of eIF4A were bound by the eIF4G fragments, we made use of the isoform-specific anti-eIF4A antisera. Western analysis revealed that endogenous eIF4AI and eIF4AII were each retained on the resin when samples from cells transfected with either the middle or C-terminal fragment of eIF4G were analyzed, implying that each protein can bind to both sites in eIF4G (Fig. 3 C). This experiment also demonstrates that the interactions between eIF4A and eIF4G are relatively stable, thus ruling out the possibility that our observation that only the eIF4A molecule is found in each eIF4F complex is an artifact because of dissociation of eIF4A from one of the binding sites in eIF4G. If eIF4A can bind simultaneously to both sites in eIF4G, it might be able to act as a bridge between two different eIF4G molecules effectively bringing about the dimerization of eIF4G. To test this, we transfected HEK 293 cells with plasmids encoding the His6-tagged eIF4GM or eIF4GCpolypeptides. These fragments of eIF4G do not contain the binding site for eIF4E that is present in native eIF4G and should therefore only be isolated on the cap resin if bridging to native eIF4G occurred. m7GTP-Sepharose pull-down assays were therefore performed using extracts of transfected cells, and blots were carried out to examine whether eIF4GM or eIF4GC could interact indirectly, e.g. via eIF4A and eIF4G/4E, with the cap resin. Western blot analysis revealed that both fragments of eIF4G were expressed at similar levels (Fig.4 A). As expected, the endogenous full-length eIF4G was retained on m7GTP-Sepharose (Fig. 4 A) by virtue of its binding site for eIF4E. In contrast, no signal was detected for either eIF4GM or eIF4GC in these experiments (Fig.4 A), implying that there is no bridging, e.g. via eIF4A, from these fragments to complexes containing endogenous eIF4G. The converse experiment was also performed, i.e. pulling out the His6-tagged eIF4G fragments on Ni-NTA agarose and analyzing the bound material for full-length eIF4G. Both fragments were bound by the nickel resin, but full-length eIF4G was not observed (Fig.4 A) again suggesting that no bridging occurs, although both eIF4G domains can bind to eIF4A. As a further test of both “bridging” and the stoichiometry of eIF4G/eIF4A interaction, cells were transfected with plasmids encoding the tagged forms of eIF4AI or eIF4AII. These proteins were expressed at similar levels to the endogenous eIF4A proteins as judged by Western blotting using the anti-eIF4Ac antibody (Fig. 4 B). Cell extracts were applied to Ni-NTA-agarose, and the bound material was analyzed by SDS-PAGE/Western blotting using anti-eIF4Ac. The tagged eIF4A molecules were clearly retained on the resin, but no endogenous eIF4A was observed, ruling out dimerization of eIF4F complexes containing multiple copies of eIF4A and again demonstrating that eIF4F complexes contain only one molecule of eIF4A (had they contained two, then endogenous eIF4A would also have been observed here). These data suggest that no such bridging between eIF4G molecules (mediated, e.g. by eIF4A) occurs. This could reflect either (i) a strong “preference” for eIF4A to interact in ciswith the two binding sites on a single eIF4G molecule rather than intrans with sites on two different eIF4G molecules or (ii) that only a single eIF4A binding site can actually be occupied at one time on a given eIF4G molecule. Our experiments do not allow us to distinguish between these two possibilities. The present study provides strong evidence that the mammalian eIF4F complex contains only one molecule of eIF4A, despite the finding that mammalian eIF4G actually possesses two independent sites for interaction with eIF4A (10Imataka H. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6940-6947Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Two possible explanations for the 1:1 stoichiometry are (i) that eIF4A cannot bind simultaneously to the two sites, so that it is associated with one or the other, giving rise to the 1:1 stoichiometry indicated by our results or (ii) that eIF4A does bind to both sites on eIF4G at the same time, through different binding sites in the eIF4A protein, so that it is “sandwiched” between these sites as originally proposed by Imataka and Sonenberg (10Imataka H. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6940-6947Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Earlier data (10Imataka H. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6940-6947Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 12Morino S. Imataka H. Svitkin Y.V. Pestova T.V. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 468-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) indicate that the C-terminal binding site enhances cap-dependent translation and the binding of ribosomes to mRNA in vitro. However, these studies and those of de Gregorio et al. (22de Gregorio E. Preiss T. Hentze M.W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4865-4874Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) (who showed that the central “core” of eIF4G could support translation, albeit rather inefficiently) indicate that this site is not essential for mRNA translation. In contrast, binding of eIF4A to the central region is both essential and sufficient for translation (10Imataka H. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6940-6947Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Based on these considerations, Morino et al. (12Morino S. Imataka H. Svitkin Y.V. Pestova T.V. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 468-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) have suggested that the C-terminal domain of eIF4G plays a modulatory role. Our data lend support to the ideas initially put forward by Sonenberg and coworkers (10Imataka H. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6940-6947Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 12Morino S. Imataka H. Svitkin Y.V. Pestova T.V. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 468-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) that eIF4G binds only one molecule of eIF4A. Thus, the eIF4F complex of mammals does not appear to differ in overall composition from the likely situation in yeast, where both isoforms of eIF4G each contain only one binding site for eIF4A (23Goyer C. Altmann M. Lee H.S. Blanc A. Deshmukh M. Woolford J.L. Trachsel H. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4860-4874Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The residues within the C terminus of eIF4G identified as being required for eIF4A binding (Phe-Val-Arg (10Imataka H. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6940-6947Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar)) are not conserved in the orthologs from wheat (24Allen M.L. Metz A.M. Timmer R.T. Rhoads R.E. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23232-23236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or Drosophila melanogaster (25Hernandez G. del mar Castellano M. Agudo M. Sierra J.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). As noted before (17Korneeva N.L. Lamphear B.J. Hennigan F.L.C. Merrick W.C. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2872-2879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), the existence of two binding sites in mammalian eIF4G may result in more stable binding of eIF4A than for the forms of eIF4G that only have one such site. This could explain why eIF4A does not co-purify with eIF4G from yeast (26Goyer C. Altmann M. Trachsel H. Sonenberg N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7603-7610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or Drosophila (27Zapata J.M. Martinez M.A. Sierra J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18047-18052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), even though an interaction between eIF4G and eIF4A can be demonstrated in vitro for these species (8Li Q. Imataka H. Morino S. Rogers G.W. Richter-Cook N.J. Merrick W.C. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7336-7346Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 14Dominguez D. Altmann M. Benz J. Baumann U.

J. 2001; 355: 223-230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutation of just one of the sites in mammalian eIF4G was enough to reduce by about 10-fold the association of eIF4A with eIF4G in toe-printing experiments (12Morino S. Imataka H. Svitkin Y.V. Pestova T.V. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 468-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) although there is ample data showing that eIF4A can interact stably with fragments of eIF4G containing only one binding site (see, for example, Refs. 10Imataka H. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6940-6947Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 12Morino S. Imataka H. Svitkin Y.V. Pestova T.V. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 2001; 276: 2872-2879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar and this study). Recent studies from Korneeva et al. (17Korneeva N.L. Lamphear B.J. Hennigan F.L.C. Merrick W.C. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2872-2879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) used surface plasmon resonance techniques, with purified proteins, to determine the binding affinities of the middle and C-terminal domains of eIF4G for eIF4A and the association and dissociation constants for these interactions. It was found that the middle domain of eIF4G binds eIF4A with a 20-fold higher affinity than the C-terminal fragment. Each domain of eIF4G could bind one molecule of eIF4A, and they reported that the region of eIF4G containing residues 642–1560 (with both binding sites) could bind two molecules of eIF4A. This last conclusion is in disagreement with our own data showing a 1:1 interaction of eIF4A with endogenous full-length eIF4G in vivo. It could be argued that the our approach involving immunoprecipitation may miss weak protein/protein interactions, which dissociate during the work-up of the samples, and that this could account for the difference between our studies. However, it should be noted that in our studies (see Fig.3) both domains of eIF4GM and eIF4GC did appear to interact with similar efficiencies with eIF4AIand eIF4AII. Thus, we do not appear to be “losing” eIF4A that is bound to one of the sites during the isolation of complexes from the cell extracts. This would be consistent with the finding of Korneeva et al. (17Korneeva N.L. Lamphear B.J. Hennigan F.L.C. Merrick W.C. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2872-2879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) that although theK d values for the two interactions do markedly differ, this is due to differences in the association rate constants rather than in the dissociation constants. The lack of bridging between two fragments of eIF4G by eIF4A observed by Korneeva et al.(17Korneeva N.L. Lamphear B.J. Hennigan F.L.C. Merrick W.C. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2872-2879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) in solution is also entirely consistent with our own findings. The implication of our study that eIF4G only binds one eIF4A molecule at a time is also in agreement with the data of Li et al. (8Li Q. Imataka H. Morino S. Rogers G.W. Richter-Cook N.J. Merrick W.C. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7336-7346Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) who showed that, when endogenous eIF4G is bound to eIF4AIII(which binds only to the middle domain of eIF4G), eIF4AIcannot bind to this eIF4G molecule. If eIF4G could simultaneously bind to two eIF4A molecules, both species of eIF4A should be found. Our data show further that both eIF4AI and eIF4AII can each bind to both domains of mammalian eIF4G independently. Early data (7Conroy S.C. Dever T.E. Owens C.L. Merrick W.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 282: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) suggested that eIF4AII might be preferentially incorporated into eIF4F complexes; our data reveal no gross difference between the binding of eIF4AI and eIF4AII to the two domains of eIF4G. The possibility that eIF4A is sandwiched between the two binding sites in eIF4G requires that eIF4A possesses two different sites for interaction with eIF4G rather than binding through a single site to both regions of eIF4G. To date, the two binding sites in eIF4G have been partially defined. The FVR motif in the C-terminal domain has been noted above, and the key residues in the central region of eIF4G that are required for the binding of eIF4A are hydrophobic ones (10Imataka H. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6940-6947Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). An important goal of further studies will be to define the binding sites within eIF4A for the two domains of eIF4G. This may be aided by the recent determinations of the three-dimensional structure of yeast eIF4A (28Caruthers J.M. Johnson E.R. McKay D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Although the functions of saposins such as Sap B and C are well known (Sap B promotes the hydrolysis of sulfatides and Sap C that of glucosylceramide), neither the physiological function nor the mechanism of action of Sap D are yet fully understood. We previously found that a dramatic increase of Sap D superficial hydrophobicity, occurring at the low pH values characteristic of the late endosomal/lysosomal environment, triggers the interaction of the saposin with anionic phospholipid-containing vesicles. We have presently found that, upon lipid binding, Sap D solubilizes the membranes, as shown by the clearance of the vesicles turbidity. The results of gel filtration, density gradient centrifugation, and negative staining electron microscopy demonstrate that this effect is due to the transformation of large vesicles to smaller particles. The solubilizing effect of Sap D is highly dependent on pH, the lipid/saposin ratio, and the presence of anionic phospholipids; small variations in each of these conditions markedly influences the activity of Sap D. The present study documents the interaction of Sap D with membranes as a complex process. Anionic phospholipids attract Sap D from the medium; when the concentration of the saposin on the lipid surface reaches a critical value, the membrane breaks down into recombinant small particles enriched in anionic phospholipids. Our results suggest that the role played by Sap D is more general than promoting sphingolipid degradation, e.g. the saposin might also be a key mediator of the solubilization of intralysosomal/late endosomal anionic phospholipid-containing membranes.

Moreover, the description of a variant form of Gaucher's disease due to a deficit of Sap C and of a variant form of metachromatic leukodystrophy due to a deficit of Sap B indicates that the two saposins are specifically involved in the degradation of glucosylceramides and sulfatides, respectively (10Wenger D.A.

In fact, the four saposins as well as prosaposin have been described as serving as ganglioside binding and transport proteins (13Hiraiwa M. Soeda S. Kishimoto Y. O'Brien J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11254-11258Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Moreover, prosaposin is a neurotrophic factor with neurotrophic activity localized within its Sap C domain (14O'Brien J.S Carson G.S. Seo H.C. Hiraiwa M. Weiler S. Tomich J.M. Barranger J.A. Kahn M.

For a long time the current hypothesis on the mechanism of action of saposins involved the concept that the activation of sphingolipid degradation was due to the interaction of saposins either with sphingolipids (e.g. Sap B with sulfatides) or with sphingolipid hydrolases (e.g. Sap C with glucosylceramidase) (1O'Brien J.

With a series of papers we have demonstrated that this was not the case at least for Sap C, whose main target is neither glucosylceramidase nor glucosylceramide but, instead, phospholipid membranes (15Vaccaro A.M.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Sap C, on interaction with anionic phospholipid-containing membranes, causes a dramatic destabilization of the lipid surface, that in turn favors the association of glucosylceramidase and the enzymatic degradation of glucosylceramide (15Vaccaro A.M. Tatti M. Ciaffoni F. Salvioli R. Maras B. Barca A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 16Vaccaro A.M. Ciaffoni F. Tatti M. Salvioli R. Barca A. Tognozzi D.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Beside modulating the glucosylceramidase interaction with membranes, Sap C has also the capacity to aggregate and fuse anionic phospholipid vesicles at low pH values (19Vaccaro A.M. Tatti M. Ciaffoni F. Salvioli R. Serafino L. Barca A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated that Sap D, like Sap C, strongly binds to membranes and that anionic phospholipids promote and modulate its interaction with lipid surfaces (6Tatti M. Salvioli R. Ciaffoni F. Pucci P. Andolfo A. Amoresano A. Vaccaro A.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 486-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 16Vaccaro A.M. Ciaffoni F. Tatti M. Salvioli R. Barca A. Tognozzi D. Scerch C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30576-30580Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These similarities contrast with the different physiological role played by the two saposins, namely, Sap C is involved in glucosylceramide degradation (12Christomanou H. Chabas A. Pampols T. Guardiola A. Klin. Wochenschr. 1989; 67: 999-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), whereas Sap D has been proposed as an activator of ceramide or sphingomyelin degradation (20Morimoto S. Martin B.M. Kishimoto Y. O'Brien J.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 156: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 21Azuma N. O'Brien J.S. Moser H.W. Kishimoto Y. Arch. Biochem.

Commun. 1994; 200: 1440-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). A direct interaction of Sap D with these sphingolipids seems unlikely since neither the presence of ceramide nor that of sphingomyelin increases the affinity of Sap D for lipid surfaces (6Tatti M. Salvioli R. Ciaffoni F. Pucci P. Andolfo A. Amoresano A. Vaccaro A.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 486-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it is reasonable to suppose that the high affinity of Sap D for anionic phospholipids, as reflected in its behavior in vitro (6Tatti M. Salvioli R. Ciaffoni F. Pucci P. Andolfo A. Amoresano A. Vaccaro A.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 486-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), will in large measure dictate its behavior in vivo. The present study was originally conceived to search for differences between the membrane binding properties of Sap C and D, which might account for their different physiological roles. By comparing the interaction of the two saposins with vesicles, we met an unexpected property of Sap D not yet reported for any saposin, namely, the ability to disrupt anionic phospholipid-containing membranes with formation of small particles. This finding prompted us to characterize the phospholipid recombinant particles and to define the conditions that favor their formation. Our results indicate that Sap D has the potential to be a phospholipid membrane-solubilizing protein under physiological conditions. Phosphatidylcholine (PC)1 from egg yolk and phosphatidylserine (PS) from bovine brain were from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL). Phosphatidylinositol (PI) from bovine liver and cholesterol (Chol) were from Sigma.l-α-Dipalmitoyl [2-palmitoyl-9,10-3H(N)]PC (82 Ci/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and 1, 2-dioleoyl-l-3-phosphatidyl-l-[3-14C]serine (56 mCi/mmol) was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All other chemicals were of the purest available grade. Sap C and Sap D were purified from the spleens of patients with Type 1 Gaucher's disease after a previously reported procedure (5Vaccaro A.M. Salvioli R. Barca A. Tatti M. Ciaffoni F. Maras B. Siciliano R. Zappacosta F. Amoresano A. Pucci P. J. Biol.

The purity of the final preparations of Sap C and Sap D was verified by N-terminal sequence analysis, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and electrospray mass spectrometry (5Vaccaro A.M. Salvioli R. Barca A. Tatti M. Ciaffoni F. Maras B. Siciliano R. Zappacosta F. Amoresano A. Pucci P. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1999; 263: 486-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Multilamellar vesicles (MLVs) were prepared by mixing appropriate amounts of lipids dissolved in chloroform and evaporating the solvent under N2. PC was supplemented with [3H]PC and, in some experiments, PS with [14C]PS. The specific activities of both phospholipids were in the range of 2 × 106 dpm/mg. The dry lipids were dispersed by Vortex mixing in 2 mml-histidine, 2 mm TES, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4. The suspension was submitted to 10 cycles of freezing and thawing and then blended by a Vortex mixer for 3–5 min. The vesicle concentration was determined by radioactivity measurements. The changes of vesicle turbidity were monitored by 90° light scattering. A FluoroMax-2 spectrofluorimeter equipped with a constant temperature cell holder and stirrer (Spex Industries Inc., Edison, NJ) was used with excitation and emission wavelengths set at 600 nm (slit widths of 3 nm). The temperature of the cuvette holder was maintained at 37 °C. All solutions were preincubated at this temperature. Lipid vesicles were added to 1 ml of buffer A (10 mm acetate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA), pH 4.5, and monitored for 5 min. Saposin solutions were then added, and the change in light scattering was monitored as function of time. Different mixtures of Sap D and labeled MLVs (see above) in buffer A, pH 4.5, were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C and then applied to a Sepharose CL-4B column (1 × 22 cm) pre-equilibrated and eluted at room temperature with the same buffer. In specified experiments, buffer A was adjusted to different pH values. The flow rate was 0.25 ml/min. Fractions of 0.4 ml were collected. The lipid distribution was determined by measuring the radioactivity of the fractions. When two labeled phospholipids were present, double isotope counting conditions were adopted. Samples for density gradient centrifugation were prepared as for the gel permeation experiments. A discontinuous KBr density gradient was formed in 13 × 51-mm Ultra-Clear centrifuge tubes. The KBr solutions were prepared in buffer A, pH 4.5. Each gradient contained, from the bottom, 0.3 ml of KBr solution (density 1.39 g/ml), 0.3 ml of sample solution adjusted to a density of 1.30 g/ml with KBr, 1.8 ml of KBr solution (density 1.21 g/ml), 1.8 ml of KBr solution (density 1.06 g/ml), and 0.6 ml of KBr solution (density 1.02 g/ml). Samples were centrifuged in a Beckman SW 55 Ti rotor at 46,000 rpm (250,000 × g), 25 °C, for 4 h. After centrifugation, each sample was separated into 16 fractions (0.3 ml each). The lipid distribution was determined by measuring the fraction radioactivity. To compare the binding of Sap D to large and small vesicles, the fractions from the Sepharose CL-4B columns (see above) were concentrated by transferring them to Microcon-YM-3 centrifugal filter devices (molecular mass cut-off 3 kDa) and centrifuging at 13,000 × g until all the liquid except 20 µl was passed through the filter. The presence of Sap D in each retentate was tested by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (see the next paragraph). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed with 15% acrylamide-separating gels and 4.5% stacking gels (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, Sap D was visualized with the silver-staining kit Protein (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Different mixtures of Sap D and 20% PS containing MLVs in buffer A, pH 4.5, were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C and then adjusted to pH 7.0 with 0.1 m imidazole. The samples were applied to carbon-coated copper grids (400 mesh). After 30 s on the grid, the samples were dried, negatively stained with 2% sodium phosphotungstate, and observed by transmission electron microscopy. Micrographs were taken using a Philips 208S electron microscope operating at 80 kV. We have previously shown that, within the four saposins, Sap C and Sap D have the strongest capacity to destabilize anionic phospholipid-containing vesicles at acidic pH values (16Vaccaro A.M. Ciaffoni F. Tatti M. Salvioli R. Barca A. Tognozzi D. Scerch C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30576-30580Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 24Vaccaro A.M. Salvioli R. Tatti M. Ciaffoni F. Neurochem. Res. 1999; 24: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Moreover, Sap C, under appropriate conditions, is able to aggregate and fuse PS vesicles (19Vaccaro A.M. Tatti M. Ciaffoni F. Salvioli R. Serafino L. Barca A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To address the question whether Sap C and D exert different actions on membranes, the two saposins were separately added to phospholipid MLVs, and the turbidity of the vesicles was followed by light-scattering measurements. Representative curves of the changes in scattered light intensity are shown in Fig.1. The addition of Sap C to MLVs containing 20% PS caused a time-dependent increase in light-scattering intensity, confirming the Sap C capacity to promote aggregation of anionic phospholipid-containing membranes (19Vaccaro A.M. Tatti M. Ciaffoni F. Salvioli R. Serafino L. Barca A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In contrast, the addition of Sap D to the same MLV preparation induced clearance of the suspension. The rate of turbidity clarification decreased on lowering the membrane content of PS and was dramatically reduced when MLVs were devoid of anionic phospholipids. These results strongly suggest that Sap D is able to disrupt membranes and that anionic phospholipids play a critical role in this process. To look for further proof of a Sap D-induced breakdown of membranes, mixtures of vesicles and Sap D were analyzed by gel filtration on a Sepharose 4-B column. To characterize the role of anionic phospholipids, the experiments were performed with MLVs prepared with or without PS or PI. As shown in Fig.2A, Sap D poorly affected the elution of MLVs composed of PC and Chol. Most of the vesicles eluted in a peak (maximum at fraction 18) in the void volume of the column, either in the presence or in the absence of the saposin. On contrast, Sap D induced the formation of a second broad peak centered at fractions 29–30, when MLVs contained 10% PS (Fig. 2 B). Also, in the presence of another anionic phospholipid such as PI, the addition of Sap D shifted about 40% of vesicles to a second peak (maximum at fraction 34) (Fig. 2 C). The comparison of Fig.2, B and C, suggests that the recombinant particles formed in the presence of PI are smaller than those formed in the presence of PS. To confirm that Sap C was unable to dissolve phospholipid membranes, a mixture of 10% PS-containing MLVs and Sap C was analyzed by gel permeation at pH 4.5. The elution pattern of MLVs was not affected by the presence of Sap C (data not shown). When the PS percentage in the vesicles was increased from 10 to 20%, the peak of the recombinant particles formed after the addition of Sap D sharpened and shifted toward lower molecular masses (compare Fig. 2 B and Fig. 3,upper left panel). This result is consistent with the light-scattering experiments showing that the addition of Sap D to 20%PS-containing MLVs induces a more rapid turbidity clarification than the addition to 10%PS-containing MLVs (see Fig. 1). Thus, the gel permeation experiments confirm that Sap D, but not Sap C, induces breakdown of anionic phospholipid-containing membranes, giving rise to smaller particles whose size and extent of formation depend on the type and percentage of the anionic phospholipid. Since we previously found that the interaction of Sap D with membranes is favored by an acidic environment (16Vaccaro A.M. Ciaffoni F. Tatti M. Salvioli R. Barca A. Tognozzi D. Scerch C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30576-30580Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), the pH dependence of the formation of recombinant particles was evaluated (Fig. 3). When the gel filtration analysis of the SapD-vesicles mixtures was performed at pH 6.0, essentially all the 20% PS-containing vesicles eluted in one peak, with a maximum at fraction 18, corresponding to the MLVs. At lower pH values, progressively larger proportions of the vesicles appeared as a second peak (maximum at fraction 32–33), indicating that low pH values are required for the formation of the small particles. To check whether the recombinant particles had the same phospholipid composition as the original MLVs, the vesicles were doubly labeled in PC and PS. Fig. 3 (upper left panel) shows that the small particles have a significantly lower PC/PS ratio (r = 2.4) than the parent vesicles (r = 2.7). The remaining MLVs eluting in the void volume, on the other hand, were enriched in PC (r = 3.0). Apparently Sap D selects PS over PC during the reaction with MLVs vesicles, promoting the pH-dependent formation of recombinant small particles richer in PS than the original membranes. To ascertain at which lipid/saposin molar ratio the Sap D-induced breakdown of membranes becomes evident, a gel permeation analysis of Sap D mixed with different amounts of PS-containing MLVs was performed (Fig.4). At a lipid/saposin molar ratio of 100:1, the presence of the saposin poorly affected the elution profile of the MLVs (Fig. 4 A). At a molar ratio of 50:1, about 35% PC and 40% PS eluted as a broad shoulder after the MLVs peak (Fig.4 B). When the molar ratio was further decreased to 12.5:1, most of the MLVs was transformed into particles eluting in the second peak (a maximum at fraction 33) (Fig. 4 C). Judging from the elution profiles, the small particles were generated when the lipid/saposin molar ratio was lower than 100:1. To further characterize the recombinant particles and to determine their density, the Sap D-induced transformation of MLVs was analyzed by density gradient centrifugation. When the 20% PS-containing vesicles were subjected to centrifugation in a KBr gradient at pH 4.5, the lipids floated at the top, whereas after incubation with Sap D at a lipid/saposin molar ratio of 25:1, a major portion of the vesicles was shifted to a peak centered at fraction 13, corresponding to a density of about 1.23 (Fig.5A). At a lipid/Sap D molar ratio of 12.5:1, an almost complete transformation of the original MLVs was observed (Fig. 5 B). Vice versa, the Sap C addition to the PS-containing MLVs did not cause a significant transformation of the vesicles (Fig. 5 C). The density gradient banding profiles of the recombinant particles were consistent with the elution patterns previously observed for the corresponding gel filtration samples, the peak at higher density (d = 1.23) corresponding to the peak eluting at lower molecular masses (a maximum at fractions 32- 33) (compare Fig. 5 A with Fig. 3,upper left panel, and Fig. 5 B with Fig.4 C). To check whether Sap D forms stable complexes with the vesicles and/or with the recombinant particles, the peaks obtained after gel permeation analysis of 20% PS-containing MLV-Sap D mixtures were analyzed by electrophoresis for the presence of the saposin. As shown in Fig. 6, upper panel, when the lipid/Sap D molar ratio of the mixture was 100:1, Sap D was found under the single MLV peak (maximum at fraction 18) eluting from the gel permeation column under this condition (see Fig.4 A). At a lipid/saposin molar ratio of 25:1, when a first MLV peak and a second peak of small recombinant particles elute from the column (see Fig. 3, upper left panel), most of the Sap D was found in the second rather than in the first peak (Fig. 6,middle panel). The same situation was observed when the lipid/saposin molar ratio was further decreased to 12.5:1, and most of the MLVs was transformed into small particles (Fig. 6, lower panel). These results indicate that Sap D remains preferentially associated with the small particles obtained after the conversion of the large vesicles. The ultrastructure of the recombinant particles formed on incubation of PS-containing MLVs with Sap D was examined by negative staining electron microscopy (Fig. 7). Control MLVs are spherical in shape, with a variable diameter ranging from 400 to 1000 nm (Fig. 7 A). The incubation of MLVs with Sap D at a lipid/saposin molar ratio of 25:1 gave mixtures of small spherical vesicular structures of varying sizes. The majority of the vesicles had diameters ranging from 20 to 50 nm (Fig. 7 B), but vesicles with diameter larger than 200 nm were also observed (data not shown). At a lower lipid/Sap D molar ratio (12.5:1), the diameter of the vesicles further decreased (15–20 nm), and discoidal structures forming rouleaux were clearly discerned (Fig. 7 C). It is thus evident that the size and morphology of the recombinant particles depend on the Sap D concentration on the membrane. Saposins are involved in the lysosomal degradation of several sphingolipids in late endosomes/lysosomes. Most likely a crucial step in the cascade of events during the hydrolysis of these lipids is the interaction of saposins with the membranes where sphingolipids are located. We have previously demonstrated that at low pH values similar to those present in the endosomal/lysosomal environment, at least two saposins (Sap C and D) have a high affinity for phospholipid membranes, particularly in the presence of anionic phospholipids (16Vaccaro A.M. Ciaffoni F. Tatti M. Salvioli R. Barca A. Tognozzi D. Scerch C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30576-30580Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 24Vaccaro A.M. Salvioli R. Tatti M. Ciaffoni F. Neurochem. Res. 1999; 24: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In the present study several independent experimental approaches have provided the first demonstration that Sap D has the capacity to break down anionic phospholipid-containing membranes, giving rise to small recombinant particles. The criteria for this conclusion include (a) the ability of Sap D to transform MLVs into structures that scatter less light, (b) the isolation by gel filtration or by density gradient centrifugation of stable complexes of saposin and lipid particles having a different size and density than the starting membranes, and (c) the detection by electron microscopy of small spherical and discoidal structures after incubation of MLVs with Sap D. The membrane-disrupting activity of Sap D is expressed only when the pH of the medium is below 5.5. This observation is consistent with our previous studies showing that Sap D undergoes a hydrophobic transition at low pH values, leading to interaction with membranes (16Vaccaro A.M. Ciaffoni F. Tatti M. Salvioli R. Barca A. Tognozzi D. Scerch C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30576-30580Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The change of hydrophobicity of Sap D most likely has a physiological significance because the low pH values found in late endosomes/lysosomes correspond to those required by the saposin for binding, perturbing, and solubilizing anionic phospholipid-containing membranes. Even a small pH change in the acidic organelles might markedly affect the properties of Sap D. The formation of recombinant lipid particles induced by Sap D is dependent on the presence of negatively charged phospholipids. We observed in the past that variation of the percentage of anionic phospholipids modulates the strength of the saposin-membrane interaction (6Tatti M. Salvioli R. Ciaffoni F. Pucci P. Andolfo A. Amoresano A. Vaccaro A.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 486-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 24Vaccaro A.M. Salvioli R. Tatti M. Ciaffoni F. Neurochem. Res. 1999; 24: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The association of Sap D with membranes and the depth of its insertion are most likely governed by electrostatic interactions between the head groups of anionic phospholipids and the cationic sites of the saposin. Both the anionic phospholipids used in the present work, namely PS and PI, favored the SapD-induced disruption of the membrane. Apparently, the action of Sap D on the lipid surface occurs in the presence of anionic phospholipids independently of their structure. Another critical factor for the solubilization of the membranes is the concentration of Sap D on the lipid surface. In fact, our results show that large anionic phospholipid-containing vesicles bind the saposin up to a lipid/saposin molar ratio of about 100:1 before they break down into small recombinant complexes. It can be envisaged that electrostatic interactions provided by the anionic phospholipids attract Sap D from the medium and concentrate it on the lipid surface. When the local concentration of Sap D reaches a critical value the membrane breaks down, giving rise to small particles enriched in anionic phospholipids as compared with the original membrane. This last observation suggests that Sap D, upon association with vesicles, favors the formation of domains enriched in anionic phospholipids. Our past investigation on the structural and membrane binding properties of saposins showed that Sap D and Sap C share several important features as follows. They have the ability to exist in both water-soluble and membrane-bound forms (16Vaccaro A.M. Ciaffoni F. Tatti M. Salvioli R. Barca A. Tognozzi D. Scerch C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30576-30580Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar); they undergo a dramatic increase of hydrophobicity at pH 5.0–5.5, as indicated by phase partitioning experiments in Triton X-114 and fluorescence measurements (6Tatti M. Salvioli R. Ciaffoni F. Pucci P. Andolfo A. Amoresano A. Vaccaro A.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 486-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 16Vaccaro A.M. Ciaffoni F. Tatti M. Salvioli R.

Res. 1999; 24: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar); they bind and perturb anionic phospholipid-containing large vesicles in a pH-dependent manner (6Tatti M. Salvioli R. Ciaffoni F.

Res. 1999; 24: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar); and they have the same disulfide structure (5Vaccaro A.M. Salvioli R. Barca A. Tatti M. Ciaffoni F. Maras B. Siciliano R. Zappacosta F. Amoresano A. Pucci P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9953-9960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 6Tatti M. Salvioli R. Ciaffoni F. Pucci P. Andolfo A. Amoresano A. Vaccaro A.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 486-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the two saposins also exhibit profound differences. In fact, Sap C, but not Sap D, is able to promote the association of glucosylceramidase with large anionic phospholipid-containing vesicles reconstituting the enzyme activity (16Vaccaro A.M. Ciaffoni F. Tatti M. Salvioli R. Barca A. Tognozzi D. Scerch C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30576-30580Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), a finding consistent with the notion that only Sap C is the physiological activator of glucosylceramidase. Conversely, the present work demonstrates that Sap D can break down anionic phospholipid-containing membranes, an activity not exhibited by Sap C. Thus, our findings indicate that, although both saposins have a high affinity for phospholipid vesicles, the mode of Sap D interaction with membranes is remarkably different from that of Sap C. Sap D has been proposed to have a role in ceramide degradation, since its addition to the culture medium of fibroblasts from a patient suffering from prosaposin deficiency resulted in the reduction of ceramide storage (22Klein A. Henseler M. Klein C. Suzuki K. Harzer K. Sandhoff K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 1440-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Recently it has been reported that not only Sap D, but also Sap A and C, reduce the ceramide storage (25Linke T. Wilkening G. Sadeghlar F. Mozcall H. Bernardo K. Schuchman E. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5760-5768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Thus, a specific physiological function of Sap D in ceramide hydrolysis is still uncertain. We have previously shown that ceramide does not increase the affinity of Sap D for the membranes (6Tatti M. Salvioli R. Ciaffoni F. Pucci P. Andolfo A. Amoresano A. Vaccaro A.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 486-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), the real target of the saposin being anionic phospholipids. The key role played by these lipids in governing the behavior of Sap D suggests that the saposin interacts with anionic phospholipids to elicit its biological effect(s). In the late endosomes/lysosomes, where saposins are located, the presence of internal vesicles and structures has often been observed (26van Deurs B. Holm P.K. Kayser L. Sandvig K. Hansen S.H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 61: 208-224PubMed Google Scholar, 27Kobayashi T. Stang E. Fang K.S. de Moerloose P. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Nature. 1998; 392: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Recently it has been found that the network of internal vesicles in the lumen of late endosomes contains large amounts of anionic phospholipids, especially lysobisphosphatidic acid and PI, forming specialized domains where specific proteins such as the multifunctional receptor for mannose 6-phosphate-bearing ligands preferentially segregate (27Kobayashi T. Stang E. Fang K.S. de Moerloose P. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Nature. 1998; 392: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). In view of our past and present results on the role of anionic phospholipids in the interaction between Sap D and membranes, it is tempting to envisage that also Sap D segregates and concentrates onto the intraendosomal/lysosomal vesicles, where it might participate to their degradation by converting them into small recombinant particles. In cells of patients affected with prosaposin deficiency, where all saposins are missing, the accumulation of intraendosomal/lysosomal multivesicular structures has been observed (9Bradová V. Smı́d F. Ulrich-Bott B. Roggendorf W. Paton B.C. Harzer K. Hum. Genet. 1993; 92: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 28Harzer K. Paton B.C. Poulos A. Kustermann-Kuhn B. Roggendorf W. Grisar T. Popp M. Eur. J. Pediatr. 1989; 149: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). A putative role of Sap D in the degradation of anionic phospholipid-containing membranes inside acidic organelles would be consistent with this observation. Interestingly, some of the Sap D properties characterized in the present paper are similar to those shown by exchangeable apolipoproteins, such as apoA-I, except that the Sap D properties are exhibited at low pH and the apolipoproteins properties are exhibited at neutral pH. In fact, apoA-I, under appropriate conditions, also has a marked ability to solubilize membranes, causing liposome structure to be disrupted so as to loose turbidity, especially in the presence of anionic phospholipids (29Surewicz W. Epand R.M. Pownall H.J. Hui S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16191-16197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the Sap D-induced formation of small lipid particles resembles the recruitment of phospholipids by apoliprotein A-I to form apolipoprotein lipid spherical and discoidal recombinant particles that can be separated from the original vesicles by gel permeation or density gradient centrifugation (30Swaney J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 877-881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Jonas A. Drengler S.M. Patterson W. J. Biol.

Drengler S.M. Kaplan J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2420-2426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Exchangeable apolipoproteins have a functional role in the remodeling of lipoproteins. The apolipoprotein-like properties exhibited by Sap D at low pH values suggest that this saposin might have a role in the remodeling of phospholipid membranes inside acidic organelles. In conclusion, the present work has highlighted for the first time the ability of Sap D to convert membranes of appropriate composition into small recombinant particles. This finding might give critical clues to the function of this saposin, whose precise physiological and pathogenic role is still relatively unknown. Our results suggest that Sap D might have more general functions than promoting the sphingolipid degradation, e.g. Sap D might be also involved in the processes of phospholipid membrane transformation in late endosomes/lysosomes.

https://openalex.org/W2008917635,"The function of p53 correlates with its 'wildtype' conformation, specifically recognized by antibodies PAb1620 and PAb246, and many cancer-associated mutations cause loss of this conformation. The epitopes of these antibodies were identified using hybrid p53 proteins created by a new method. Plasmids carrying homologous genes cut at appropriate sites recombined efficiently when transformed into RecE(+) E. coli. PAb1620 and PAb246 recognize mouse but not chicken p53; we created mouse-chicken hybrids of the p53 core domain and tested antibody reactivity. PAb246 binding mapped to residues 201-212, while PAb1620 required both residues 145-157 and 201-212 (human p53 numbering used throughout). An alanine-scan showed that the key residues for PAb246 and PAb1620 are completely distinct: PAb246 recognizes residues 202-204 (Tyr-Pro-Glu) while PAb1620 recognizes residues Arg156, Leu206, Arg209, and Gln/Asn210, the last two residues being essential. Both antibody epitopes are far from the p53 interface with DNA, but near the epitope of the 'mutant' conformation antibody PAb240. These epitope locations may help in dissecting the interactions of p53, including those with E6/E6-AP and in its DNA-bound state."

To isolate and identify the CEA receptor gene we used two approaches: screening of a KC cDNA library with a specific antibody and the yeast two-hybrid system for protein interaction using as a bait the N-terminal part of the CEA encoding the binding site. Both techniques resulted in the identification of the rat heterogeneous RNA-binding protein(hnRNP) M4 gene. The rat ortholog cDNA sequence has not been previously described.

Both experimental and clinical results reveal that the presence of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)1 enhances liver metastasis from colorectal carcinoma cells (1Kim J.C. Gong G. Roh S.A. Park K.C. Mol. Cells. 1999; 9: 133-137PubMed Google Scholar, 2Jessup J.M. Thomas P. Stanners C.P. Cell Adhesion and Communication Mediated by the CEA Family: Basic and Clinical Perspectives. Harwood Academic Publishers, Amsterdam, Netherlands1998: 195-222Google Scholar). CEA is a highly characterized, cell surface glycoprotein overexpressed by various tumor cells and provides a tool for tumor tissue-specific targeting. Increasing amounts of CEA in the serum correlates with the development of metastatic recurrence after surgical removal of the primary tumor (3Keesee S.K. Briggman J.V. Thill G. Wu Y.-J. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Exp. 1996; 6: 189-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Earlier we have shown that CEA production of human colorectal cancer cell lines directly correlates with the metastatic potential (4Wagner H.E. Toth C.A. Steele G.D. Thomas P. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1992; 10: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Poorly metastatic colon cancer cell lines become highly metastatic when transfected with the cDNA coding for CEA (5Hashino J. Fukada Y. Oikawa S. Nakazato H. Nakanishi T. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1994; 12: 324-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 6Thomas P. Gangopadhyay A. Steele Jr., G. Andrews C. Nakazato H. Oikawa S. Jessup J.M. Cancer Lett. 1995; 25: 59-66Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar). As a member of the immunoglobulin supergene family, CEA is involved in intercellular recognition and may facilitate attachment of colorectal carcinoma cells to sites of metastasis. In an experimental metastasis model of colorectal carcinoma in athymic nude mice, systemic injection of CEA enhanced experimental liver metastasis and implantation in liver by weakly metastatic tumor cells (7Leconte A. Garambois V. Ychou M. Robert B. Pourquier D. Terskikh A. Mach J.P. Pelegrin A. Br. J. Cancer. 1999; 9: 1373-1379Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 8Hostetter R.B. Augustus L.B. Mankarious R. Chi K. Fan D. Toth C.A. Thomas P. Jessup J.M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1990; 82: 380-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). To successfully treat cancers, it is necessary to prevent the development of metastasis after the treatment or removal of the primary malignancy. Therefore, it is important to elucidate the mechanism by which CEA enhances metastatic potential. The molecular basis by which CEA can influence metastasis is only partly understood. We have shown that CEA is rapidly cleared from the circulation of experimental animals, accumulates in the liver, and is endocytosed in vitro by Kupffer cells. This initiates a series of signaling events that leads to tyrosine phosphorylation on at least two intracellular proteins (9Gangopadhyay A. Lazure D.A. Thomas P. Cancer Lett. 1997; 118: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and is followed by induction of IL-1α, IL-6, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor-α cytokines (10Gangopadhyay A. Bajenova O. Kelly T.M. Thomas P. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4805-4810PubMed Google Scholar). CEA uptake by Kupffer cells is independent of its carbohydrate composition and is mediated by an 80-kDa binding protein (11Toth C.A. Thomas P. Broitman S.A. Zamcheck N. Biochem. J. 1982; 204: 377-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). CEA is recognized by this binding protein through a 5-amino acid sequence, Pro-Glu-Leu-Pro-Lys (PELPK), located at the hinge region (amino acids 108–112) between the N-terminal and the first immunoglobulin loop domain (12Gangopadhyay A. Thomas P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 334: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Molecular modeling studies have suggested that this region is exposed on the surface of the molecule. 2P. A. Bates, personal communication. We have recently shown in a subset of colorectal cancer patients that mutations in the PELPK region of CEA results in the accumulation of large amounts of CEA in the serum (13Zimmer R. Thomas P. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2822-2826PubMed Google Scholar). To further study the interaction between the peptide sequence, PELPK, and rat Kupffer cells, the CEA-binding protein was purified using a combination of gel filtration, preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and affinity chromatography on CEA-Sepharose (14Gangopadhyay A. Lazure D.A. Kelly T.M. Thomas P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 328: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). A polyclonal antibody to the rat 80-kDa protein was produced in mice that blocks uptake by isolated rat Kupffer cells of both CEA and PELPK peptide conjugated to albumin. This antibody shows a high degree of specificity for the rat 80-kDa protein by both fluorescein isothiocyanate analysis and Western blotting (14Gangopadhyay A. Lazure D.A. Kelly T.M. Thomas P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 328: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In this study we used this antibody to clone the rat CEA-binding protein. We have isolated the rat ortholog of the human hnRNP M4 protein and present the data on the analysis and tissue distribution of this protein. It was also shown that transfection of rat hnRNP M4cDNA into a mouse P388D1 macrophages resulted in CEA binding. Kupffer cells were isolated according to our standard laboratory protocol (15Toth C.A. Thomas P. Broitman S.A. Zamcheck N. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 392-397PubMed Google Scholar) from the livers of male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats. The rodents were starved overnight and the livers perfused through the portal vein with collagenase. Suspended cells were separated into parenchymal and non-parenchymal fractions by differential centrifugation. Kupffer cells were purified from the non-parenchymal cell fraction using a gradient of 17.5% metrizamide in Gey's balanced salt solution. The interface layer containing Kupffer cells was isolated and washed in phosphate-buffered saline. Further purification of the cells is achieved by attachment to plastic plates for 2 h. Generally 3–5 × 108 cells are routinely isolated from one liver. 1 × 108 Kupffer cells remain after the adhesion step. Kupffer cells are identified by their ability to phagocytose 1-µm latex particles, and by staining for endogenous peroxidase activity. The cells were >90% viable by trypan blue staining and 85% phagocytic. Rat KC library was constructed on the basis of the λZAP Express vector system according to the manufacturers instructions (Stratagene). Total RNA from various tissues, KC, and cell lines was isolated using the RNAzol method (Biotex Laboratories, Inc.) and mRNA using the mRNA isolation kit (Qiagen Inc.). To screen the cDNA library bacterial strain XL1 was incubated with recombinant phages. Approximately 1 × 106 plaque forming units of the library were plated on 150-mm Luria-Bertini agar plates containing 10 mm MgSO4 and maintained at 42 °C for 2–3 h. Polyvinylidene difluoride filters were pretreated in 10 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, overlaid in the plates, and incubated at 37 °C for 12 h. The filters were dried and blocked in 3% milk prior to exposure to the anti-80-kDa antibody (1:100 dilution) (14Gangopadhyay A. Lazure D.A. Kelly T.M. Thomas P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 328: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The enhanced chemiluminescence technique was used to detect positive cDNA clones (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). By screening 1011 phages one positive clone was identified, and after plaque purification, the insert was subcloned in pBK-CMV vector for DNA sequencing. We also used the HybriZAP 2.1 Two-hybrid Vector system (Stratagene) to identify CEA-binding proteins. cDNA from rat Kupffer cells were synthesized using the ZAP Express cDNA synthesis kit (Stratagene), according to the manufacturers recommendations, using ∼5 µg of mRNA which was purified as described before. For preparing the target (i.e. activation domain) vector we cloned rat cDNA into the pAD-GAL4vector. The DNA-binding domain vector construction was performed as follows: a 438-bp EcoRI-PstI fragment surrounding the PELPK-binding region was isolated from a CEA plasmid,pdKCR-dhfr/dN-CEA (a gift from Dr. T. Kurihara, Suntory Institute for Biomedical Research, Japan), and subcloned in-frame intopBD-GAL4Cam to be used as bait. Correct insertion of the fragment was confirmed by EcoRI-PstI digestion and DNA sequencing. This bait did not contain any motifs forN-linked glycosylation in order to avoid nonspecific binding of CEA with carbohydrate-binding proteins. Competent YRG-2 yeast strain cells were co-transformed by heat shock with the target and bait plasmids at 42 °C for 20 min, in a solution containing 1 × TE, 100 mm LiAc, pH 7.5, 50% PEG 3350. Putative interaction clones were selected in SD agar plates without leucine, tryptophan, and histidine. Specific interaction between target and bait plasmids was confirmed by a filter-lift assay, where colonies are transferred to filter paper, permeabilized in liquid nitrogen, and assayed for β-galactosidase activity to detectLacZ expression. Verification of interaction was performed by isolating plasmid DNA from selected yeast cells. Plasmid DNA was purified by the alkaline method and digested withEcoRI-XhoI enzymes to verify the insert size. The sequencing was carried out using dideoxy terminator fluorescent DNA sequencing method with the Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems). Reactions were purified by ethanol precipitation and separated on the ABI 377-96 slab gel automated DNA sequencer. The contingency sequence was assembled and analyzed using the Vector NTI Suite program (Informax). The sequences were verified by sequencing of the opposite strand. For production of CEA-binding protein in a bacterial system, theEcoRI/XhoI fragment corresponding to hnRNP M4 cDNA from the recombinant phage was cloned into theEcoRI-XhoI sites of pGEX-4T-3 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The pGEX-4T-3 backbone was chosen from the variety of pGEX-GST vectors to maintain the original reading frame. The plasmid was introduced into B21Escherichia coli host bacteria. To express the protein, transformed cells were cultured in LB to a densityA 600 = 0.5 after which isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.3 mm) was added and cultures were maintained at 37 °C for 2 h. Total bacterial proteins were prepared and fusion proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B affinity chromatography, according to the manufacturers instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Kupffer cells (1 × 107) were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed in RIPA buffer (Santa Cruz) with protease inhibitors (1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm sodium fluoride, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Bacterial cells were lysed by sonication with protease inhibitors. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were collected and protein concentrations were measured using the BCA method (Pierce). Equal amounts of protein were loaded on SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis samples were transferred into Sequi-Blot polyvinylidene difluoride nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). To detect CEA binding the membrane was incubated with CEA (1 µg/ml) in TBS buffer containing 10 mm CaCl2, washed, and exposed to a monoclonal anti-CEA antibody (clone C6G9) (Sigma). Detection of bound CEA was carried out using the ECL technique (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). One-step RT-PCR was performed using the Titan One Tube RT-PCR System (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) to detect CEA-binding protein mRNA. Briefly, a 50-µl reaction was prepared containing 500 ng of template mRNA, and final concentrations of 200 mm of each dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 400 nm of each primer (forward, 5′-GGAAGGCCACTGAAAGTCAA-3′; reverse, 5′-TCCACGACTTTTCCCATCTT-3′), 1 × RT-PCR buffer, and 1 µl of enzyme mixture containing avian myeloblastosis reverse transcriptase, Taq, and Pwo DNA polymerases. The following PCR cycling was used: 1 cycle of 94 °C for 2 min; 10 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, 68 °C for 45 s; 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, 68 °C for 45 s, with cycle elongation of 5 s for each cycle; and a final extension cycle of 68 °C for 5 min. The primers were designed surrounding the deletion region encoding amino acids 187 and 226 of the rat hnRNP M4 protein. This generated two expected PCR products of 321 and 204 bp representing the wild type hnRNP M4 and hnRNP M4 with the deletion mutation. As control for genomic DNA contamination PCR reactions that included each cDNA synthesis reagent except reverse transcriptase were set up in parallel. Two independent experiments were performed for each amplification. Transient transfection of hnRNP M4 plasmid was carried out in P388D1 mouse lymphoid macrophage, IC21 mouse peritoneal, and CRL2192 rat alveolar macrophage cell lines (ATCC). None of these cells lines were able to take up CEA under standard conditions. We used rat Kupffer cells as a positive control. The P388D1 cells were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% horse serum. The CRL 2192 cells were grown in F-12K medium (Kaighn's modification) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (ATCC). The IC21 cells were grown in RPM1 1640 ATCC-modified medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. All cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 atmosphere. All tissue culture products were obtained from Life Technologies. Cells for transfection were plated at 2–2.5 × 105 cells per well in six-well tissue culture clusters (Nunc products). Cells were allowed to grow for 24 h and the plasmid construct was transfected in serum-free medium using the Gene Pulser II Electroporation system (250 microfarads, 300 V) (Bio-Rad). The cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended at a density of 107 cells/ml in RPM1 media without fetal bovine serum. 10 µg of pBK-CMV/hnRNP M4 expression vector DNA was transfected per sample. 0.4 ml of the cell suspension was used per electroporation in 0.4-cm cuvettes. The cells were maintained at room temperature prior to and after electroporation. At 10 min post-electroporation, the cells were seeded into growth media at a concentration of 106 cells/ml. 48 h post-electroporation, the cells were harvested and resuspended in a volume of 200 µl for measuring of CEA binding activity. These procedures were performed as described previously (15Toth C.A. Thomas P. Broitman S.A. Zamcheck N. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 392-397PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly CEA (5 µg/ml) labeled with125I was incubated in triplicate with the cells at 37 °C. Samples were taken at 0, 15-, 30-, 45-, and 60-min intervals. These were immediately centrifuged through an oil phase (3:1 ratio of bibutylphthalate:dioctylphthalate) at 14,000 rpm using an Eppendorf Microfuge. The cells spin through the oil and can be separated from the supernatant for γ-counting, by cutting the bottom of the plastic centrifuge tubes. The rat Kupffer cell cDNA library was screened with the mouse polyclonal anti-80-kDa antibody (14Gangopadhyay A. Lazure D.A. Kelly T.M. Thomas P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 328: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Screening of 1011 plaques from the λZAP library resulted in the identification of one positive cDNA clone with an insert size of 2.4 kilobases. Sequencing and a Blast search of human genome data bases for close related family members revealed that this cDNA was a novel rodent gene with 91% of cDNA homology to the humanhnRNP M4 gene (GeneBankTM accession number NM 005968). The sequence differences are mostly single substitutions of nucleotides and a deletion of 117 nucleotides in a spacer region between two putative N-terminal RNA-binding domains (RBD-I and RBD-2). A similar deletion is also characteristic to Homo sapienshnRNP M4 protein deletion mutant cDNA (GeneBankTMaccession number AF 061832). The cDNA sequence of the rat gene was submitted to the GeneBankTM with accession numberU32577. Since the anti-80-kDa antiserum used to probe the rat KC library is polyclonal (14Gangopadhyay A. Lazure D.A. Kelly T.M. Thomas P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 328: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), there is potential to recognize nonspecific protein epitopes. To confirm that hnRNP M4 was a CEA-binding protein we independently screened for CEA-binding proteins using the yeast two-hybrid system (HybriZAP-2.1 Two-Hybrid Predigested Vector System, Stratagene). The bait was an engineered fragment of the full-length CEA containing a 146-amino acid surrounding the PELPK-binding site. DNA sequencing showed that all clones had identical sequences to the humanhnRNP M4 gene. Both screening techniques, antibody probing and the yeast two-hybrid system, resulted in the identification of the same gene sequence suggesting a new functional role for the hnRNP M4 gene encoding the 80-kDa CEA-binding protein in Kupffer cells. Analysis of the rat cDNA showed an open reading frame (ORF) starting from the initiation sequence AAAATGG and containing a 5′-end nontranslated region of 21 bp followed by 2351 nucleotides with the polyadenylation signal AATAAA and a termination poly(A) tail. Fig.1 shows this sequence. The cDNA has 3 putative RNA-binding domains (RBD) that are evolutionarily conserved domains present in pre-mRNA-, mRNA-, pre-rRNA-, and snRNA-binding proteins, including hnRNP proteins, splicing factors, and polyadenylation factors (16Kenan D.J. Query C.C. Keene J.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 214-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). The first and second domains (RBD-1 and RBD-2) are arranged in tandem close to the N terminus and RBD-3 is located near the C terminus (Fig. 1). The N-terminal RBD-1 (nucleotides 297–376) and RBD-2 (nucleotides 634–740) regions have 82 and 87% homology with the H. sapiens myelin gene expression factor 2(MyEF-2) cDNA (17Haas S. Steplewski A. Siracusa L.D. Amini S. Khalili K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12503-12510Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These sequences are underlined on Fig. 1. The MyEF-2 protein contains two RNA-binding domains (RBD-1 and RBD-2), previously shown to be responsible for sequence specific binding to both RNA and single stranded DNA (17Haas S. Steplewski A. Siracusa L.D. Amini S. Khalili K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12503-12510Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). MyEF-2 is a transcription factor that was isolated from the mouse brain, maps to mouse chromosome 2, and represses transcription of the myelin basic protein gene. The hnRNP M4 RBD-1 and RBD-2 regions show a lesser degree of homology to RBDs found in a wide variety of RNA and single strand DNA-binding proteins (18Gorlach M. Burd C.G. Portman D.S. Greyfuss G. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1993; 18: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis demonstrated thathnRNP M4 contains no other commonly recognized DNA binding motifs, such as zinc finger, homeobox, POU, or helix-loop-helix domains. Presumably, similar to MyEF-2, the RNA binding motifs can be responsible for single strand DNA binding and RNA binding activity of hnRNP M4. No significant homology with other proteins, including other hnRNPs was found by Blast search. The rat M4 cDNA sequence has 90–92% identity to a H. sapiens chromosome 19 clone CTD-3182G2, complete sequence. The human gene was previously assigned to sub-bands p13.3-p13.2 of chromosome 19 (19). The localization of the hnRNP M4 in the rat genome is not known. Protein sequence analysis based on the cDNA ORF predicts that rat hnRNP M4 encodes a novel protein of 775 amino acids. It is consistent with its apparent molecular mass of 78–80 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and is consistent with the molecular mass previously reported for the Kupffer cell-binding protein (14Gangopadhyay A. Lazure D.A. Kelly T.M. Thomas P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 328: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Based on cDNA translation hnRNP M4 is a multifunctional signaling protein that has the potential to be modified by variety of enzymes. Structural analysis of the protein using Swiss-Prot data base revealed that in addition to 3 putative RNA-binding domains (aa 77–155, 171–248, and 620–696) this protein has 3 potential membrane spanning regions (aa 263–282, 290–311, and 597–616) (Fig. 2 A). It also possesses 7 potential protein kinase C phosphorylation sites, 11 casein kinase II phosphorylation sites, and 15 N-myristoylation motifs (Fig. 2 B). The intracellular domain contains what appears to be a tyrosine phosphorylation motif (aa 100–106) and two glucosaminoglycan attachment sites (aa 36–39 and 379–382). The C terminus of hnRNP M4 is unique to this molecule and contains 17 repeats of glycine, arginine, methionine, and glutamine. Arginine is the only known methylated amino acid residue in hnRNPs, indicating that the methylation of these proteins is likely to have an important effect on their functions (20Liu Q. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2800-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Arginine methylation modification is part of the mechanism by which protein-RNA complexes are recognized for nuclear export (21Shen E.C. Henry M.F. Weiss V.H. Valentini S.R. Silver P.A. Lee M.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 679-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The partial amino acid sequence of rat hnRNP M4 has been recently published (22Kafasla P. Patrinou-Georgoula M. Guialis A. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 495-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and it is in support of our protein prediction. This sequence is missing the N-terminal part of the protein and has several gaps throughout the sequence (Fig. 3). It also represents the splicing form without the aa 187–226 deletion in the spacer region between RBD-1 and RBD-2. The ability of the hnRNP M4 protein to interact with CEA was examined by preparing membrane lifts from λZAP Express-hnRNP M4 phage plates and incubating them with125I-labeled CEA or PELPK albumin conjugate (11Toth C.A. Thomas P. Broitman S.A. Zamcheck N. Biochem. J. 1982; 204: 377-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) in the presence of 10 mm Ca2+ or 10 mmEDTA. Both CEA and PELPK albumin bound strongly to the phages in the presence of Ca2+ but there was no binding when EDTA was present. These data confirm previous observations on the Ca2+ requirements of the CEA-binding protein using isolated Kupffer cells (13Zimmer R. Thomas P. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2822-2826PubMed Google Scholar) and adds further evidence that hnRNP M4 is the Kupffer cell CEA-binding protein. To further substantiate this finding and to estimate the molecular mass of the encoded protein, the cDNA corresponding to rat hnRNP M4 ORF was placed into a prokaryotic expression pGEXsystem allowing production of a GST-hnRNP M4 fusion protein. A series of pGEX vectors were designed for inducible, high level intracellular expression of the cDNA as a fusion protein withSchistosoma japonicum GST protein (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The hnRNP M4 cDNA was cloned into pGEX-4T-3 vector to maintain the proper reading frame. The fusion protein was obtained as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The Kupffer cell lysate and pGEX-4T-3/hnRNP M4 fusion proteins (2 clones) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was exposed to 1 µg/ml CEA followed by an anti-CEA antibody. KC lysate was used as a positive control (lane 1) and the empty vector as a negative control (lane 4). A single 80-kDa band was shown in Kupffer cells Fig.4, lane 1, and in the fusion proteins (lanes 2 and 3). The band was absent for the vector alone (lane 4). This data indicated that rat hnRNP M4 protein encoded by the cDNA is able to bind soluble CEA similar to the 80-kDa KC receptor. The molecular weights of the hnRNP M4 protein and an 80-kDa receptor from KC were indistinguishable. Both rat and human tissues were examined for the presence of the binding protein mRNA using Northern blots. A nick translated probe with [32P] corresponding to hnRNP M4 cDNA was used. The results from rat and human tissues were similar. Northern blot analysis revealed that the mRNA encoding the hnRNP M4 is abundantly expressed as a single transcript of 2.4 kilobases in the liver, heart, lung, skeletal muscle, kidney, stomach, and thyroid. The RNA seems to have a ubiquitous distribution but the Northern blot analysis (not shown) was unable to distinguish between the full-length and deletion mutant. To determine whether the form with the deletion in a spacer region between the RBD-1 and RBD-2 is expressed in Kupffer cells we synthesized PCR primers that incorporated the deleted region as part of their product. Amplification results in a larger PCR product for the full-length form (321 bp) and a shorter product (204 bp) for the deletion mutant. The results show that the deletion form encoding aa 187–226 is distributed throughout all rat tissues examined. The larger form is generally also present but in what seems to be lower copy numbers. Both mRNA forms (with and without the deletion) were characteristic of the rat KC. Only the form with the deletion was detected in human KC (Fig.5). These data indicate that there are multiple subclasses of hnRNP M4 mRNA that may arise by alternative pre-mRNA splicing and may carry different functions in vivo. To elucidate whether macrophage cell lines can take up soluble CEA,in vitro experiments with 125I-labeled CEA were performed. We tested 3 macrophage cell lines: CRL2192, P388D, and IC21. CEA uptake by isolated rat KC was used as a positive control. Cells were incubated with 125I-CEA (5 µg/ml) for 15, 30, 45, and 60 min. Fig. 6 shows that none of the macrophage cell lines was able to take up the labeled CEA in vitro. Earlier it was also determined that freshly isolated lung alveolar macrophages express the 80-kDa protein and rapidly endocytose CEA in a similar manner to Kupffer cells (23Toth C.A. Rapoza A. Zamcheck N. Steele G. Thomas P. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1989; 45: 370-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the ability of CEA uptake is cell specific and perhaps is tissue restricted to Kupffer cells and alveolar macrophages. To further confirm the role of hnRNP M4 as a CEA-binding protein and to begin to elucidate the mechanism underlying the intracellular signaling associated with Kupffer cell activation, the hnRNP M4cDNA in the pBK-CMV expression vector was transfected into macrophage cell lines. The mouse alveolar-derived P388D1 and mouse peritoneal-derived IC21 macrophages were transfected with thehnRNP M4/PBK-CMV (10 g of hnRNP M4/pBK-CMVplasmid"

This interaction subsequently leads to extravasation of leukocytes into the surrounding infected or inflamed tissue (1Springer T.A. Cell. 1994; 76: 301-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6408) Google Scholar). E- and P-selectins, which are expressed on activated endothelial cells, are involved in this interaction (2Lasky L.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 113-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Kansas G.S.

The third member of the selectin family, L-selectin, is involved when lymphocytes extravasate into secondary peripheral lymphoid organs, where it interacts with counter-receptors on the post-capillary high endothelial venules (HEV)1 (5Swarte V.V.

All three selectins recognize glycoprotein counter-receptors that must be properly glycosylated for binding to occur. All glycans that have been described for efficient recognition by selectins are modified by α2,3-sialylation and α1,3-fucosylation, and the minimal common epitope for all selectins is the sialyl Lewis x (SLex, NeuAcα2–3Galβ1–4[Fucα1–3]GlcNAcβ1–3-) epitope (6Foxall C.

In addition, Fuc-TVII expression in peripheral lymph HEV has been correlated with expression of l-selectin ligands (5Swarte V.V. Joziasse D.H. Van den Eijnden D.H. Petryniak B. Lowe J.B. Kraal G.

Furthermore, mice made deficient in the Fuc-TVII enzyme showed blood leukocytosis, deficiency in expression of selectin ligand activity, impaired neutrophil trafficking in inflammation, and defects in lymphocyte recirculation, strongly establishing a role for Fuc-TVII in selectin ligand synthesis (20Maly P.

However, there have been no reports on genetic polymorphism in the genes encoding for the α1,3-fucosyltransferases expressed in human leukocytes. In this paper we describe for the first time a missense mutation of theFUT7 gene associated with an altered expression of SLex and CD65s (VIM-2) epitopes on human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Fifteen patients with ulcerative colitis (n = 13) or proctitis (n = 2) were examined. Twelve healthy controls were also studied. Restriction endonuclease analysis was performed on DNA samples from 106 plasma donors in Göteborg (Sweden) (29Larson G. Svensson L. Hynsjö L. Elmgren A. Rydberg L. Vox Sang. 1999; 77: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and 258 unselected adult individuals from the Linköping area (Sweden). A pedigree study ofFUT7 genetics was performed in one Swedish family. The study was approved by local ethical committees in Göteborg and Linköping. Human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) were isolated from 10 ml of freshly drawn EDTA-anticoagulated blood using density gradient centrifugation (PolymorphprepTM, Nycomed, Torshev, Norway). The cell preparations had a purity of >90% as determined by analyses on an automatic cell counter (H3 instrument, Bayer Diagnostics, Fernwald, Germany). Primary antibodies used were KM93 and CSLEX-1 directed against sialyl Lewis x (SLex), (Serotech Ltd., Oxford, United Kingdom; and Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA); VIM-2 directed against CD65s (kindly provided by Prof. W. Knapp, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria); and 911-F11 directed against Lewis x (Lex) and 9001/1H10 directed against sialyl Lewis a (SLea) (BioCarb AB, Lund, Sweden). For flow cytometry FITC-conjugated primary mouse antibody against CD15 (Le x, Leu-M1, Becton-Dickinson no. 347423) and control FITC-conjugated mouse IgG1 antibody (X0927, Dako A/S, Glostrup, Denmark) were used. FITC-conjugated F(ab′)2 fragment of rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulins (F0313, Dako A/S) were used as secondary antibody. For immunofluorescence analyses, the secondary antibody used was fluorescein-conjugated rat anti mouse Ig F261, and for Western blot analyses secondary peroxidase-conjugated rat anti-mouse Ig P161 and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit Ig P448 (Dako A/S, Glostrup, Denmark) antibodies were used. Antigen purified rabbit anti-mouse Fuc-TVII antiserum was kindly provided by Prof. J. B. Lowe (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI). Cell lysates were prepared by solubilizing the purified PMN in 400 µl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% IGEPAL CA-630 (Sigma) containing 0.12 µm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2.3 µmleupeptin, and 1.5 µm pepstatin. Protein concentration in the supernatant was determined by the 4,4′-dicarboxy-2,2′biquinoline, bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method (30Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H.

An aliquot of the supernatant corresponding to 20 µg of protein was separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207461) Google Scholar) and transferred to an Immobilon-P polyvinylidene fluoride microporous membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) (32Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44931) Google Scholar). The membrane was blocked with Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) containing 5% Tween 20 and 5% defatted milk powder (Semper, Stockholm, Sweden) at room temperature for 1 h. The membrane was then washed twice with TBS, incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody in TBS, 1% BSA, washed three times with TBS containing 0.3% Tween 20, and incubated with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody in TBS containing 1% milk powder and 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was rinsed three times with TBS containing 0.3% Tween 20, and positive bands were visualized using ECL Western blotting reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For Western blot analysis of COS-7 cells, the membranes were blocked in 10% BSA in PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20 (PBS-T) over night at 4 °C. PBS-T was used for washing, and PBS-T containing 3% BSA was used for incubations with primary and secondary antibodies. For calculation of molecular size, prestained molecular mass standards (Bio-Rad) were used. Digital images of the blots were analyzed using a CCD camera (512 × 512 pixels) in combination with a computerized imaging 8-bit system (Visage 4.6; BioImage, Ann Arbor, MI). The quantitative expression of each epitope in a lane was assessed as background-corrected optical density, integrated over all pixels in the lane and expressed as integrated optical density. Buffy coat was isolated from freshly drawn EDTA-anticoagulated blood from one heterozygously mutated patient (M. N.). Total RNA was isolated using an SV Total RNA isolation system (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) and cDNA was prepared using oligo(dT)15 primers and a Reverse Transcription System A3500 according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega Corp.). PCR was used to amplify the coding regions and immediately adjacent 5′- and 3′-flanking regions of FUT7using 0.25 µg of cDNA as template. The PCR program used an initial temperature of 8 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 amplification cycles run for 15 s at 95 °C, 15 s at 59 °C, and 3 min at 68 °C. The last extension step was kept for 10 min at 68 °C. The sense primer (25 pmol), VII-3s (5′-gctagcgaattcCTGATCCTGGGAGACTGTGG-3′), is complementary to nucleotides −20 to −1 and contains additional nucleotides (lowercase) at its 5′ end, including an EcoRI (underlined) restriction site. The antisense primer (25 pmol), VII-4as (5′- gtcgactctagaGTAAGGGCCGGATGCCTGGT-3′), anneals to nucleotides 1107–1088, and contains additional nucleotides (lowercase) at its 5′ end, including an XbaI (underlined) restriction site. The 1151-bp PCR product was ligated into the pCR2.1 TA-cloning vector (Invitrogen Corp., San Diego, CA). Transformation of InVαF bacteria was performed according to the manufacturers protocol (Invitrogen Corp.). Positive clones were identified by blue-white screening, preparation of plasmids, and cleavage with XbaI and EcoRI (Life Technologies, Paisley, United Kingdom.). Twenty-four clones were analyzed with PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism to identify TA clones with wild type or mutated alleles. Primer VII-15s (5′-CATCGCCCGCTGCCACCTGAGT-3′), corresponding to nucleotides 216–237, and VII-5as (5′-GCTGCCGCTCCTGGAAGTTGCTGAC-3′), corresponding to nucleotides 529–554, were used to amplify a 338-bp fragment of FUT7 cDNA. The G329A mutation abolishes the restriction site GC↓GGCCGC for NotI (Life Technologies, Inc.). When the 338-bp PCR product was treated with NotI and analyzed by gel electrophoresis, the wild type allele was digested into two products of 247 and 91 bp, whereas the mutant allele remained intact. Complete sequencing of nine TA clones was done on an Alf II-express using the Cy5-dye terminator kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). One wild type clone and one clone containing the G329A point mutation without PCR-induced errors were chosen for subcloning of the FUT7 insert into the pSI mammalian expression vector (Promega Corp.). The resulting plasmid containing theFUT7 wild type was called pSI-wt, and the plasmid containing the mutated construct was called pSI-329. PCR was used to amplify the two coding regions and the 253-bp intron (33Winder A. Smithers N. Witham S. Symons A. Edbrooke M. Biochem. Soc.

The PCR program used an initial temperature of 85 °C for 10 min, followed by 30 amplification cycles run for 15 s at 60 °C, 15 s at 59 °C, and 3 min at 68 °C. The last extension step was kept for 10 min at 68 °C. The VII-3s sense primer (30 pmol), and the VII-4as antisense primer (30 pmol) were used. The 1404-bp PCR product was ligated into the pCR2.1 TA-cloning vector as above and sequenced with the AmpliTaq DNA polymerase FS kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Foster City, CA) on an Applied Biosystems 373A DNA sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). COS-7 cells (∼106 cells) cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum were transfected with 10 µg of expression vector constructs using the DEAE-dextran method (34Davis L.G. Dibner M.D. Battey J.F. Basic Methods in Molecular Biology. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., New York1986: 290-292Crossref Google Scholar). The cells were transfected with pSI without insert as a negative control or with the two pSI-FUT7 constructs (pSI-wt and pSI-329). The medium was changed 24 h after transfection. Transfected cells were harvested after a 96-h growth period after transfection. Transfection efficiency was controlled using quantitative PCR analysis. Total RNA was isolated from transfected cells according to the manufacturer's instructions using a Total RNA kit (Promega Corp.) including treatment with DNase. A reverse transcription kit (Promega Corp.) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions to transcribe 1 µg of total RNA. Quantitative PCR analysis was performed using the TaqMan PCR Core Reagent kit (PE Biosystems). Reactions for FUT7quantification were performed in 30 µl with 0.2 µg of cDNA; 3 µl of 10× TaqMan Buffer A (500 mm KCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3); 5 mm MgCl2; 200 µm each of dATP, dCTP, and dGTP; 400 µmdUTP; 0.3 units of uracil-N-glucosidase; 0.75 units of AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase; 50 nm FUT7 probe; and 100 nm FUT7 sense and antisense primers. The following FUT7 consensus primers and probe were used: r1s, 5′-CTTGGCTGACTGACTCTGG-3′ (nucleotides −29 to −11); r2as, 5′-CCTCGCAGCCTCCG-3′ (nucleotides 28 to 41); and FUT7 probe, 5′-CCGTGCCCAAGCATTATTCATCCA-3′ (nucleotides −3 to 20). TheFUT7 probe was designed to cover the sequence over the splice site in FUT7 cDNA to avoid amplification of contaminating genomic DNA sequences. As an additional control for contaminating DNA, quantitative PCR was also performed leaving out the first reverse transcription-PCR step. This did not generate any product. The PCR-program used an initial temperature of at 50 °C for 2 min and then 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 amplification cycles run for 15 s at 95 °C and 1 min at 60 °C. The amplifications were performed on an ABI Prism 7700 sequence detector equipped with a 96-well thermal cycler. Data were collected and analyzed with Sequence Detector version 1.6.3 software (PE Biosystems). Reactions for quantifying β-actin were performed exactly as described above except for using 3.5 mm MgCl2 and 300 nmsense primer (5′-TCACCCACACTGTGCCCATCTACGA-3′), 300 nmantisense primer (5′-CAGCGGAACCGCTCATTGCCAATGG-3′), and 200 nm β-actin probe (5′-ATGCCCCCCCCATGCCATCCTGCGT-3′) (PE Biosystems). All analyses were performed in triplicate and with probes labeled with 6-carboxyfluorescein and 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine. The transfected cells were trypsinized, washed, and incubated with primary antibodies against CD65s, SLea, SLex, and Lex. After 30 min of incubation with the primary antibody, the cells were washed with PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+ and incubated another 30 min with fluorescein-conjugated rat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody. After incubation with the secondary antibody, the cells were washed with PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+. The cell pellets were then fixed with Mowiol (Hoechst, Frankfurt am Main, Germany) and paraformaldehyde (4%, pH 7.3) at a ratio of 1/3 (v/v) and mounted on glass. The cells were observed under a Leitz SM-LUX epifluorescence microscope. Immunofluorescence studies were also conducted on adherent cells in eight-well tissue culture chamber slides (Nunc Inc., Naperville, IL) without using trypsin treatment. Enzyme activity was analyzed by measuring the incorporation of GDP-[14C]fucose, 300 mCi/mmol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), to a sialylated type 2 acceptor substrate, NeuAcα2–3Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1-sp-biotin or a sialylated type 1 acceptor substrate, NeuAcα2–3Galβ1–3GlcNAcβ1-sp-biotin (Syntesome, Munich, Germany). COS-7 cells transfected with pSI, pSI-wt, or pSI-329 were lysed in 50 mm MOPS buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1% Triton X-100. Apparent K m for GDP-Fuc was determined using Lineweaver-Burk plots with GDP-Fuc concentrations between 2 and 10 µm and an acceptor concentration of 10 mm. Apparent K m for the sialylated type 2 acceptor was determined with acceptor concentrations between 0.25 and 10 mm and a GDP-Fuc concentration of 100 µm. The assay was initiated with the addition of cell lysate (45 µg of protein) to a reaction mixture containing GDP-Fuc, acceptor, 10 mm α-l-fucose, and 10 mmMnCl2 in 50 mm MOPS buffer (pH 7.5). The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The product was purified by the Sep-Pak C18 isolation procedure (35Mollicone R. Gibaud A. Francois A. Ratcliffe M. Oriol R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and analyzed by liquid scintillation counting. Product formation was also measured at 0.5, 1, and 2 h and found to be linear in this time range. Genomic DNA, isolated from 5 ml of EDTA anticoagulated blood according to Ref. 36Miller S.A. Dykes D.D. Polesky H.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (17953) Google Scholar, was amplified by primers VII-15s and VII-5as. The 338-bp product was used without prior purification for restriction enzyme analysis by NotI and electrophoresis on a 1.75% SeaKem-agarose gel (FMC), followed by ethidium bromide staining. For NotI restriction endonuclease analysis of selected family members, the primer pair VII-3s/VII-4as was used for amplification (generating a 1404-bp product) with 791- and 613-bp cleavage products. Flow cytometric analyses were performed on a FACScan instrument (Becton Dickinson) operating with CELLQuest software and calibrated with 6-µm CaliBRITE beads with the AutoCOMP program (Becton Dickinson). One ml of EDTA-anticoagulated peripheral blood was diluted into 50 ml of lysis buffer (150 mmNH4Cl, 10 mm KHCO3, 90 mm Titriplex III (Merck p.a.), pH 7.3), allowed to stand in room temperature for 7 min, centrifuged, and washed once with 50 ml of PBS, pH 7.2. Leukocytes were resuspended in PBS with 0.1% BSA (Sigma) to a final concentration of 5–10 × 106 cells/ml. Fifty µl of cell suspensions were incubated with 5 µl of primary antibody (Leu-M1 diluted 1:5; VIM-2 diluted 1:100; KM93 diluted 1:40, CSLEX-1 diluted 1:50) and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed with 2 ml of PBS, resuspended in 55 µl of FITC-conjugated F(ab′)2 fragment of rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulins diluted 1:10 in PBS, and incubated for another 15 min at room temperature. The cells were washed in PBS and fixed in 200 µl of 1% paraformaldehyde. Mouse FITC-conjugated IgG1 antibodies were used as negative controls. Of 5000 cells counted, only data on the gated granulocyte population are presented. PMN lysates were analyzed by Western blot analysis to detect differences in expression of SLex and CD65s. All PMN samples analyzed from healthy volunteers expressed a similar set of SLex-carrying glycoproteins with most intensely stained bands in the molecular mass region at ∼90–115 kDa. A representative sample is shown in Fig.1(lane B). VIM-2 antibody directed against the CD65s epitope weakly stained glycoproteins with molecular masses of ∼60–70 kDa (Fig. 1,lane D). Western blot analyses of PMN lysates from patients with ulcerative colitis showed staining patterns comparable to the healthy population. However, one of the patients (M. N.) exhibited a different staining pattern. The Western blot analysis of PMN lysate from this individual showed a significant reduction in the staining of SLex-bearing glycoproteins. The staining intensity was about 60% compared with control samples for identical amounts of total protein (TableIand Fig. 1 (lane A)). In addition, staining of one band in the 100-kDa region was selectively lost. This pattern was seen using two different antibodies (KM-93, CSLEX-1) both known to react with SLex, albeit with somewhat different binding properties (Ref. 37Dohi T. Nemoto T. Ohta S. Shitara K. Hanai N. Nudelman E. Hakomori S. Oshima M. Anticancer Res. 1993; 13: 1277-1282PubMed Google Scholar and data not shown). Western blot analysis of PMN lysates from this patient (M. N.) using the VIM-2 antibody directed against the CD65s epitope, showed an increased staining (480%) compared with control samples (Fig. 1, Table I). This patient was analyzed both at the time of active disease and in clinical remission at several occasions during a 2-year period. The reduced expression of SLex and elevated expression of CD65s remained constant during this time.Table IDensitometry analysis of Western blots (integrated optical density)PMN lysatesSLeX(KM-93)CD65s (VIM-2)M.

Open table in a new tab The lowered SLex expression in PMN of patient M. N. indicated a potential defect in the Fuc-TVII enzyme. The gene coding for Fuc-TVII, FUT7, was amplified from genomic DNA by PCR and TA cloning. Plasmids were isolated from 13 bacterial clones and sequenced over the FUT7 insert. The two exons and the 253-bp intron present in the FUT7 gene were sequenced in both directions. There were no differences in the intron sequences between the two alleles from this individual. However, a G329A missense mutation was found in 7 out of the 13 bacterial clones, indicating that M. N. carried this mutation heterozygously in one allele. The G329A nucleotide change leads to an amino acid shift from arginine to glutamine at position 110. Sequence alignment (38Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55958) Google Scholar) showed thatFUT7-Arg110 is conserved in all 16 of the α1,3-fucosyltransferases cloned so far from vertebrate species (13Kaneko M.

We previously demonstrated that TGF-β decreased decorin mRNA steady state levels in articular chondrocytes (Demoor, M., Rédini, F., Boittin, M., and Pujol, J.-P. (1998)Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1398, 179–191). Here, we investigated the effect of TGF-β on decorin gene expression in both primary cultures of articular chondrocytes and chondrocytes dedifferentiated by serial passages. Transient transfection of cells with plasmid constructs of the decorin promoter linked to the luciferase reporter gene revealed transcriptional repression by TGF-β, in fully differentiated as well as dedifferentiated chondrocytes. Experiments with 5′-deleted constructs allowed characterization of a TGF-β-responsive element in the shortest construct (base pairs (bp) −155/+269). DNase I footprinting analysis delineated a negative TGF-β-responsive region between −140 and −111 bp in the decorin proximal promoter. Gel retardation assays demonstrated that TGF-β modulates decorin gene expression through transcription factors, the nature and mode of action of which depend on the differentiation state of the chondrocytes; two DNA-protein complexes were formed in the region −144/−127 bp with nuclear extracts from primary chondrocytes, whereas a higher mobility complex was observed in the −127/−111 bp region for dedifferentiated cells. Antibodies against vitamin D and retinoic acid receptors used in supershift experiments showed that these nuclear receptors are involved in the regulation of decorin gene expression in articular chondrocytes.

Tensile strength is provided by a framework of collagen fibers, whereas visco-elasticity of the tissue relies on a hydrated gel of high molecular weight proteoglycans (PGs),1 the aggrecans. In cartilage fibrils, collagens II, IX, and XI form a heterotypic aggregate that is essential for the control of fibril dimensions and surface properties (1Eikenberry E.F. Mendler M. Burgin R. Winterhalter K.H. Bruckner P. Kuettner K.E. Schleyerbach R. Peyron J.G. Hascall V.C. Articular Cartilage and Osteoarthritis.

Other participants in the fibril assemblages are collagen-binding glycoproteins, such as decorin and fibromodulin (3Iozzo R.V. Murdoch A.D. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 598-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar), but their functions are not completely understood.Decorin belongs to the small leucine-rich proteoglycan gene family that also includes biglycan and epiphycan and the keratan sulfate proteoglycans fibromodulin, lumican, and keratocan (reviewed in Ref.4Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18843-18846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). The core proteins of these molecules are composed of repeated motifs with conserved leucine residues (3Iozzo R.V. Murdoch A.D. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 598-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). As an ubiquitous component of extracellular matrices, decorin is synthesized by the majority of mesenchymal cells (3Iozzo R.V. Murdoch A.D. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 598-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar, 5Kresse H. Hausser H. Schonherr E. Experientia (Basel). 1993; 49: 403-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and is found preferentially in association with collagen fibrils (6Scott J.E. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2639-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 7Hagg R. Bruckner P. Hedbom E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). However, it also interacts with a variety of other components such as fibronectin (8Schmidt G. Robenek H. Harrach B. Glossl J. Nolte V. Hormann H. Richter H. Kresse H. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 1683-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), thrombospondin (9Winnemoller M. Schon P. Vischer P. Kresse H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 59: 47-55PubMed Google Scholar), transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) (10Yamaguchi Y. Mann D.M. Ruoslahti E. Nature. 1990; 346: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1285) Google Scholar), and a receptor required for its endocytosis (11Glossl J. Schubert-Prinz R. Gregory J.D. Damle S.P. Von Figura K. Kresse H. Biochem. J. 1983; 215: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These binding properties, mainly mediated by the core protein, imply an important role in the structural organization of the extracellular matrix (5Kresse H. Hausser H. Schonherr E. Experientia (Basel). 1993; 49: 403-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 12Gallagher J.T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1989; 1: 1201-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Because of its high affinity for TGF-β1, -β2, and -β3 isoforms (13Hildebrand A. Romaris M. Rasmussen L.M. Heinegard D. Twardzik D.R. Border W.A. Ruoslahti E. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar), decorin functions as a matrix reservoir for these growth factors. However, controversial data have reported an inhibitory (14Yamaguchi Y. Ruoslahti E. Nature. 1988; 336: 244-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) or enhancing (15Takeuchi Y. Kodama Y.

Its levels are greatly increased in quiescent cells, whereas its expression is generally absent in transformed cells and in most tumorigenic cell lines. De novo expression of decorin induces cell cycle arrest by activating the cyclin-kinase inhibitor p21 (16Santra M. Shorski T. Calabretta B. Lattime E.C. Iozzo R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Invest. 1997; 100: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that decorin interacts with the epidermal growth factor receptor, inducing activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, mobilizes intracellular calcium, up-regulates p21, causes growth arrest (18Iozzo R.V. Moscatello D.K. McQuillan D.J. Eichstetter I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4489-4492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), and blocks the growth of tumor xenografts (19Csordas G. Santra M. Reed C.C. Eichstetter I.

It has also been shown that decorin causes a functional inactivation of the oncogenic ErbB2 protein in breast carcinoma cells (20Santra M. Eichstetter I. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol.

In cartilage, differentially glycanated forms of decorin have been described during life and under pathological conditions (21Roughley P.J. White R.J. Magny M. Liu J. Pearce R.H. Mort J.S. Biochem.

Similarly, the osteoarthritic process is associated with a progressive phenotypic modulation of the chondrocytes as a response to inflammatory cytokines, growth factors, and fragments of matrix molecules, not normally present in their microenvironment (32Nimni M.

Fazzio A. Cohen I. Cannizzaro L.A. Eichstetter I. Iozzo R.V. Genomics. 1993; 15: 146-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, no functional activity for the region flanking exon Ia was found (37Santra M. Danielson K.G. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol.

Cannizzaro L.A. Eichstetter I. Iozzo R.V. Genomics. 1993; 15: 146-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This promoter can be divided into two main regions: a proximal promoter of ∼188 bp and a distal promoter of ∼800 bp (Fig. 1). The proximal promoter contains two functional TATA boxes and a CAAT box (38Iozzo R.V. Danielson K.G. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; 62: 19-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Moreover, it contains two tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-responsive elements that mediate the transcriptional repression of the decorin gene by this cytokine (39Mauviel A. Santra M. Chen Y.K. Uitto J. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11692-11700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The proximal promoter region also contains a canonical and a functional activator protein 1 (AP1)-binding site, a bimodal regulator of decorin gene expression, which allows both repression by TNF-α and induction by interleukin-1 (40Mauviel A.

In this regard, TGF-β has been shown to stimulate the biosynthesis of matrix components (collagens and PGs) in several tissues and cell types, including chondrocytes (44Rédini F. Galéra P. Mauviel A. Loyau G. Pujol J.-P. FEBS Lett. 1988; 234: 172-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 45Malemud C.J. Stevenson S. Mehraban F. Papay R.S. Purchio A.F. Goldberg V.M. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 1994; 2: 29-42Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It also inhibits the production of metalloproteases and enhances the expression of their tissue inhibitors, the TIMPs (46Edwards D.R. Murphy G. Reynolds J.J. Whitman S.E. Docherty A.J.P. Angel P. Health J.K. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1899-1904Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). Therefore, it appears as a good candidate for cartilage repair, particularly in joint diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.We previously showed that TGF-β inhibited decorin mRNA expression in both primary and passaged cultures of rabbit articular chondrocytes (47Demoor M. Rédini F. Boittin M. Pujol J.-P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1398: 179-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Using the same culture model, we demonstrate here that a 30-bp region of the decorin promoter (−111/−140 bp), harboring a vitamin D receptor (VDR)-retinoid X receptor (RXR) motif, is responsible for the TGF-β down-regulation of the decorin gene expression in both differentiated and dedifferentiated chondrocytes. Our results raise the possibility that the VDR-RXR motif could be implicated as a regulator of decorin expression in articular chondrocytes.DISCUSSIONStudies on the regulation of decorin gene expression are motivated by the role played by this gene product in the regulation of TGF-β bioactivity and matrix assembly. Since TGF-β is an important mediator of extracellular matrix remodeling, it could play a pivotal role in the attempt of cartilage repair in the early stages of OA. We have previously shown that decorin expression was related to the quiescent state of rabbit articular chondrocytes and that TGF-β decreased decorin messenger RNA expression in this cell system (47Demoor M. Rédini F. Boittin M. Pujol J.-P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1398: 179-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Down-regulation of decorin expression by TGF-β at the protein and RNA levels had been well documented in a variety of cell types including fibroblasts (55Kähäri V.M. Larjava H. Uitto J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10608-10615Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, studies performed at the transcriptional level are quite few. Therefore, we have extended our study and demonstrated here that TGF-β is also a potent down-regulator of decorin gene expression in articular chondrocytes.Among potential binding sites present in the promoter of decorin gene exon Ib, a TGF-β-negative element was found at position −685 (35Danielson K.G. Fazzio A. Cohen I. Cannizzaro L.A. Eichstetter I. Iozzo R.V. Genomics. 1993; 15: 146-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This motif conforms to the consensus sequence GnnTTGGtGa that has been found in the promoter region of the proteinase stromelysin (56Iozzo R.V. Cohen I. Experientia. 1993; 49: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This putative TGF-β-negative element could function as a transcriptional silencer and could suppress decorin activity in TGF-β-sensitive cells. In our experimental model, 5′-end progressive deletions of the promoter used in transient transfection assays showed that a strong basal activity of the promoter was detected with the longest construct (−1004/+269), and then the activity diminished with thePvuII construct (−805/+150) and increased with theEcoRV construct (−679/+269). These results suggest that a silencer could be present in the promoter of exon Ib between positions −805 and −679, corresponding to the position of the TGF-β-negative element (−685). Similar results were obtained with fibroblasts, where a decrease in functional activity of the promoter was observed when the construct including the TGF-β-negative element was used (56Iozzo R.V. Cohen I. Experientia. 1993; 49: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar).To our knowledge, only one study described the direct effect of TGF-β on decorin gene expression (39Mauviel A. Santra M. Chen Y.K. Uitto J. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11692-11700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). This work reported that TGF-β, together with TNF-α, exerted an inhibitory effect on decorin gene expression in fibroblasts. However, whereas TNF-α effect required promoter sequences between positions −188 and −140 bp relative to the transcription start site, 1 kb of decorin promoter sequences were not sufficient to mediate TGF-β response.In the present study, we demonstrated for the first time that a region of the first 155 bp upstream of the initiation site in the promoter of exon Ib is responsible for the inhibitory effect exerted by TGF-β on decorin gene expression in rabbit articular chondrocytes. The region involved in TGF-β effect was more precisely defined with DNase I protection assays, which revealed a 30-bp region between residues −140 and −111 relative to the transcriptional start site. The sequential analysis of this region revealed the presence of several potential binding sites for transcription factors; among them three DNA elements were very homologous to Tst-1/Oct-6, Myc-max, and VDRE. However, Myc-max can be excluded, since one essential base is mismatched in the decorin gene as compared with the consensus sequence. The activation of VDR enables its specific interaction with the recognition sequence VDRE, present in the promoter regions of different target genes, which regulate their expression. Gel retardation experiments using antibodies against VDR and RXR confirmed that both receptors are involved in the regulation of decorin gene expression by TGF-β in articular chondrocytes. It can therefore be hypothesized that in primary cultures two factors trans bind to the 5′-end of the sequence DEC (−140/−111 bp), forming the two complexes C1 and C2 observed in EMSAs (Fig. 4). Since the complex formation is abolished by antibodies against VDR and RXR (Fig. 10), it can be suggested that these nuclear receptors are involved in the formation of both complexes. Recent data from the literature reported the requirement of other transcription factors, such as AP-1 or DRIP (vitamin D-interacting protein) acting as co-activators in VDR-mediated transactivation (57Adam F. McCabe L. Frenkel B. van Wijen A.J. Stein G.S. Lian J.B. Stein J.L. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 58Rachez C. Lemon B.D. Suldan Z. Bromleigh V. Gamble M. Naar A.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Freedman L.P. Nature. 1999; 398: 824-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar).When chondrocytes were dedifferentiated, a higher migrating complex (C3) appeared, also involving RXR and VDR, as revealed by supershift experiments (Figs. 4 and 10). Therefore, the nature of the transcription factors involved in the formation of these three complexes seems to be identical, whatever the differentiation state of the cells. Complementary experiments revealed that the relative amounts of nuclear extracts from primary chondrocytes is determinant for the formation of C1, C2, or even C3. As revealed by supershift experiments, it can be hypothesized that the same factors are involved in the formation of the three complexes, forming homodimers, heterodimers, or monomers depending on the relative rates of VDR and RXR present in the nuclear extracts.Other experiments using the DEC probe mutated either in its 3′- or 5′-end demonstrated that the two parts of the probe are cooperative for the binding of VDR/RXR (Fig. 9). The conformation of the DNA strand in that region may implicate the 3′-end even for the binding of VDR/RXR in the region −140/−127 bp. A hairpin-like conformation of DNA can be therefore suggested in this region, where transcription factors of the VDR/RXR family bind at the same time to the VDRE sequence (−123/−111 bp) and to the 5′-end of the probe (−140/−127 bp) (Fig.13). Surprisingly, no VDRE motif is described in the latter, but a sequence sharing high homology (93.3%) with the factor Tst-1/Oct-6 is present. However, Oct-6 can be induced by retinoic acid, and the nuclear receptor RXR has been reported to bind to Tst-1 (59Meijer D. Grauss A. Kraay R. Langeveld A. Mulder M.P. Grosveld G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 1: 7357-7365Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In the presence of TGF-β, the formation of both complexes C1 and C2 is decreased, in parallel with a diminution of decorin expression. Therefore, the factors involved in regulation of decorin expression can be described as transactivating ones.Figure 13Hypothetical DNA conformation of the sequence −144/−111 bp of the decorin gene promoter.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)When the chondrocytes are dedifferentiated, the factor involved binds to the 3′-end of the DEC sequence, more precisely to the −123/−111 bp region. This time, a typical VDRE motif is present, consisting of two hexameric repeats separated by a 3-bp spacer named DR3. VDR is shown to bind to the 3′-end of the sequence, whereas RXR binds to the 5′-end (60Haussler M.R. Whitfield G.K. Haussler C.A. Jui-Cheng H. Thompson P.D. Selznick S.H. Dominguez C.E. Jurutka P.W.

Sequence comparison between the cis-binding element present in the −125/−108 bp region of decorin promoter andconsVDRE revealed 13 identical bases out of 15 nucleotides (Fig. 14). When compared with other identified VDREs, hdecVDRE shows high homology with VDRE present in the human and rat osteocalcin genes (61DeMay M.B. Gerardi J.M. DeLuca H.F. Kronenberg H.M. Proc. Natl.

Genet. 1997; 16: 391-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it has been recently reported that Smad 3, one of the Smad proteins downstream in the TGF-β signaling pathway, was found to act as a coactivator specific for ligand-induced transactivation of VDR (64Yanagisawa J. Yanagi Y. Masuhiro Y. Suzawa M. Watanabe M. Kashiwagi K. Toriyabe T. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Kato S. Science. 1999; 283: 1317-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Looking at the role of Smad 6 and Smad 7, which are negative regulators of the TGF-β/BMP signaling pathway, the same group showed that Smad 7, but not Smad 6, inhibited the formation of the VDR-Smad 3 complex, whereas Smad 6 had no effect (65Yanagi Y. Suzawa M. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Yanagisawa J. Kato S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12971-12974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Taken together, the results from the literature revealed that the interplay between TGF-β and the vitamin D signaling pathway is, in part, mediated by both classes of Smad proteins, which modulate VDR transactivation positively and negatively. We may therefore suggest that in our experimental model, regulation of decorin expression by TGF-β is mediated by the formation of VDR-Smad 3 or VDR-Smad 7 complex, leading to the inhibition of the gene expression. Therefore, a regulatory loop can be suggested, involving decorin, TGF-β, and vitamin D. These interplays are even more complex when considering the presence of a VDRE motif in the promoters of TGF-β2 and p21 (66Del Rio-Tsonis K. Tsonis P.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 975-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 67Liu M. Lee M.H. Bommakanti M. Freedman L.P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 142-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). Furthermore, decorin has been widely described as the product of a quiescent gene (39Mauviel A. Santra M. Chen Y.K. Uitto J. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol.

This first phase of the pathology is characterized by the activation of chondrocytes, in response to the deleterious effect of cytokines (interleukin-1β, TNF-α, etc.). The cells reenter the proliferative phase under the effects of growth factors such as TGF-β and actively synthesize matrix components as an attempt of cartilage repair. Unfortunately, catabolic events promoted by inflammatory cytokines usually predominate and cartilage e"

Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 913-949Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), XerC/XerD of Escherichia coli (2Sherratt D.J. Arciszewska L.K. Blakely G. Colloms S. Grant K. Leslie N. McCulloch R. Philos.

Biol. 1995; 51: 53-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Cre assists in the efficient segregation of the low copy P1 plasmid during bacterial cell division by resolving dimeric lysogenic P1 plasmids into monomeric units (4Austin S. Ziese M. Sternberg N. Cell. 1981; 25: 729-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Cre breaks and rejoins DNA at specific sequences called theloxP sites (Fig.1 a). The 34-bp1 loxP site is composed of two 13-bp symmetry elements surrounding an 8-bp asymmetric AT-rich region (5Hoess R.H. Ziese M. Sternberg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3398-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Since the symmetry elements inloxP have identical sequences, the orientation of theloxP site is dictated by the asymmetric central region. A 6-bp overlap region separates the two cleavage sites. This organization of the recombination site is common to the integrase family members, although the interval of the overlap region varies (1Landy A. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 913-949Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Sherratt D.J. Arciszewska L.K. Blakely G. Colloms S. Grant K. Leslie N. McCulloch R. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B Biol.

The integrase family members share a common mechanism of catalysis that involves the formation of a four-way branched DNA intermediate known as a Holliday junction (7Holliday R. Genet.

Formation and resolution of the Holliday intermediate occur via two sequential sets of single-strand DNA cleavages and exchanges (Fig. 1 b). DNA cleavage is mediated by a tyrosine residue that is absolutely conserved among the integrase family members, and hence, members of this family are also known as tyrosine recombinases (14Argos P.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 391-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). The catalytic tyrosine makes a nucleophilic attack upon the scissile phosphodiester bond, resulting in the covalent attachment of the protein via a 3′-phosphotyrosine linkage and the release of a free 5′-hydroxyl DNA end. The phosphotyrosine bond is thought to conserve the energy of the scissile phosphodiester bond. The cleaved strands from two loxP sites involved in the recombination are exchanged and ligated, resulting in the formation of a Holliday junction. The Holliday intermediate is then resolved by a second set of strand cleavages and exchanges. Depending on which pair of strands is cleaved, the Holliday intermediate may be resolved to either the parental or the recombinant configuration. Several tyrosine recombinases such as the λ-integrase, XerC/XerD, and Cre proteins catalyze recombination with a defined order of strand exchange in which one pair of strands is preferentially cleaved and exchanged first (6Colloms S.D.

The bottom strands 2The bottom strand is defined here as the strand with the cleavage site between the GC dinucleotide step at positions 4 and 3. 2The bottom strand is defined here as the strand with the cleavage site between the GC dinucleotide step at positions 4 and 3. of theloxP sites had been exchanged in these Holliday intermediates, suggesting that Cre initiated recombination on the bottom strands. The α structure was preferentially resolved on the top strands to yield recombinant products (8Hoess R. Wierzbicki A. Abremski K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6840-6844Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The order of strand exchange was further confirmed by studies on the effect of heterologies in the loxP overlap region on recombination. Lee and Saito (20Lee G. Saito I. Gene. 1998; 216: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) found that homology near the bottom strand cleavage site (positions 2 and 3) (Fig. 1 a) was required for the formation of the Holliday intermediate, whereas homology near the top cleavage site (positions 3′ to 1) was required for resolution. Therefore, Cre appears to initiate strand cleavage and exchange on the bottom strands to generate a Holliday junction, and the Holliday intermediate is subsequently resolved on the top strands to yield recombinant products. A key question regarding the tyrosine recombinase family is what are the factors that regulate the order of strand exchange and the directionality of resolution of the Holliday intermediate. Because the central 8 bp are the only asymmetric feature of the loxPsite, we investigated the influence of this asymmetric sequence on the directionality of resolution of synthetic Holliday (χ) structures. We designed synthetic χ structures containing either wild-type or mutantlox sites. We found that Cre preferentially resolved the wild-type χ structures on the top strands. This bias was dictated by the asymmetric loxP sequence, in particular by the bases immediately 5′ to the scissile phosphodiester bonds (positions 4′ and 4). We found that Lys86, which contacts the O-6 group of guanine at position 4 (21Guo F. Gopaul D.N. Van Duyne G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Each χ structure was constructed from four complementary oligonucleotides (see Fig. 2 a and Tables I andII). The deprotected oligonucleotides were synthesized by Life Technologies, Inc. and were purified by electrophoresis on a denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel.

The wild-type His-tagged Cre protein exhibited the same resolution bias as the wild-type untagged Cre protein, indicating that the His tag did not influence the direction of resolution (Fig. 5, compare lanes 2 and 3). Open table in a new tab Strand 1 of each χ structure was 5′-radioactively labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs Inc.) to detect the R1 and R2resolution products (see Fig. 2 a). In certain cases, strand 3 was 5′-radioactively labeled instead of strand 1 to detect the R3 and R4 resolution products. The four complementary oligonucleotides that constituted a particular χ structure were annealed by heating to 80 °C and slow cooling in 100 mm NaCl and 5 mm MgCl2. The three unlabeled oligonucleotides were added in 5-fold molar excess (5 pmol) over the radioactively labeled oligonucleotide (1 pmol) in a total volume of 50 µl. 2 nm χ structure was incubated with 250 nm Cre in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 30 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 3% glycerol, and 0.05 mg/ml denatured calf thymus DNA at 30 °C for 1 h, by which time the reaction had reached equilibrium (data not shown). Reactions were stopped by treatment with 0.1% (w/v) SDS and 0.05 mg/ml proteinase K (final concentrations) at 50 °C for 30 min. The resolution products were analyzed on a nondenaturing 5% polyacrylamide gel. An aliquot of the resolution reaction was analyzed on a denaturing 8% polyacrylamide gel to verify the sizes of the products. The radioactivity in the bands on the nondenaturing gels was quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. The amount of each resolution product was calculated as the counts in the product band divided by the total counts in the product and substrate bands. A background correction was applied from the lane without Cre added. The resolution bias is calculated as the ratio of the amounts of R1 product to R2 product (R1:R2). The Cre K86A mutant protein was constructed with a His tag at the N terminus for ease of purification using the His-Cre expression vector, pShe6. pShe6 contains the wild-type cre gene fused to a 10-histidine N-terminal tag in a pET19b vector (23Shaikh A.C. Sadowski P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5695-5702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Lys86 of His-Cre was mutated to alanine by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis using the following primers: T7 pro, 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGG-3′ (hybridizes to the T7 promoter of vector pShe6); CA86-Top, 5′-GGG CTAGCAGTAGCAACTATCCAGCAAC-3′ (mutated nucleotides are in boldface, the mutated codon 86 is underlined, and the silent NheI site is in italics); CA86-Bot, 5′-AGTTGCTACTGCTAGCCCGCGCGCCTGAAG-3′ (mutated nucleotides are in boldface, the mutated codon 86 is underlined, and the silent NheI site is in italics); and 115LD, 5′-GTAGTTATTCGGATCATCAGC-3′ (hybridizes to sequences encoding amino acids 231–237). The mutagenesis was done in three polymerase chain reaction steps as described by Higuchi (24Higuchi R. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1990: 177-183Google Scholar). The final polymerase chain reaction product was digested with NcoI andBstBI and cloned into theNcoI/BstBI-digested pShe6 vector to form the His-Cre K86A variant expression vector, pLC86A. Mutagenesis and the accuracy of cloning were further verified by DNA sequencing. T7 pro and 115LD were synthesized by the Hospital for Sick Children Biotechnology Service Center at the University of Toronto. CA86-Top and CA86-Bot were synthesized by Life Technologies, Inc. The Taq DNA polymerase (PCR SuperMix high fidelity) used in the polymerase chain reactions was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. The restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were from New England Biolabs Inc. The shrimp alkaline phosphatase used to dephosphorylate the vector was from U. S. Biochemical Corp. Wild-type Cre and His-Cre were expressed from pShe11 and pShe6, respectively, constructed by Shaikh and Sadowski (23Shaikh A.C. Sadowski P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5695-5702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), whereas His-Cre K86A was expressed from pLC86A. Each construct was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS as described by Shaikh and Sadowski (23Shaikh A.C. Sadowski P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5695-5702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The wild-type Cre, wild-type His-Cre, and His-Cre K86A proteins were purified essentially as described by Shaikh and Sadowski (23Shaikh A.C. Sadowski P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5695-5702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Analysis on SDS-polyacrylamide gel showed that the proteins were >90% pure. Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) with IgG (Bio-Rad) as the protein standard. The purified proteins were stored at −70 °C. To investigate the resolution of the Holliday structure by the Cre recombinase, we constructed synthetic Holliday (χ) structures containing two loxP sites (Fig.2 a). The four complementary DNA oligonucleotides used to construct the wild-type χpstructure are listed in Table I, and a diagram of the central 8-bp region of the loxP sites at the Holliday junction is shown in Fig. 2 b. In the case of χp, strands 1 and 3 correspond to the top strands of theloxP site, whereas strands 2 and 4 correspond to the bottom strands. The loxP sites in the synthetic χ structure are flanked by 12–32 bp of non-homologous sequences in the arms to prevent branch migration beyond the loxP sites. The arms are of variable lengths so that the direction of resolution can be deduced from the size of the resolution products. For example, resolution by cleavage of strands 1 and 3 would generate the 87-bp R1 and 70-bp R3 products. Resolution on strands 2 and 4 would generate the 75-bp R2 and 82-bp R4 products. Upon incubation of the χ substrate with Cre, two rapidly migrating bands appeared that comigrated with linear R1 and R2 DNA markers (Fig. 2 c). Only the 87-bp R1 and 75-bp R2 resolution products are detectable on the autoradiogram because only strand 1 of the χ substrate was radioactively labeled at its 5′-end. The other resolution products (R3 and R4) could be detected when strand 3 was 5′-radioactively labeled (data not shown). The sizes of the resolution products and the cleaved intermediates were further verified by analysis on denaturing polyacrylamide gels (data not shown). We found that Cre preferentially resolved the wild-type χp substrate on the top strands of loxP. At equilibrium, ∼4-fold more of the top strand resolution product (R1) was formed than the bottom strand resolution product (R2). The bias toward resolution on the top strands was accentuated early in the reaction (data not shown). When strand 3 was 5′-radioactively labeled to detect the reciprocal resolution products, the other top strand resolution product (R3) predominated over R4 by ∼4-fold also (data not shown). The biased resolution that we observed for our synthetic χpstructure was unexpected considering previous studies by Hoess et al. (8Hoess R. Wierzbicki A. Abremski K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6840-6844Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). They isolated a closed Holliday intermediate (α structure) that was accumulated by certain Cre mutant proteins during an in vitro excisive recombination reaction with a 4.3-kilobase pair linear substrate. As with our synthetic χp structure, they observed an ∼4-fold preference for resolution of the α structure on the top strands of theloxP sites over the bottom strands. However, when the closed loop of the α structure was cleaved to generate an open χ structure, Hoess et al. observed unbiased resolution of the χ structure. This result differs from our findings with the synthetic χp structure. A possible explanation for the discrepancy is that the sequences flanking the loxP sites may have influenced the direction of resolution. Our synthetic χpstructure is smaller and has different flanking arm sequences compared with the α-derived χ structure characterized by Hoess et al. To determine whether the flanking sequences in the arms of our synthetic χ structure were responsible for the biased resolution, we constructed the χrev structure, in which the orientation of the loxP sites is reversed relative to χp, but the flanking arm sequences remain the same as in χp(Table II). The χrevstructure still contains wild-type loxP sites, but strands 1 and 3 now correspond to the bottom strands, whereas strands 2 and 4 are the top strands. If the resolution bias was determined by theloxP sequence, we expected that reversing the orientation of the loxP sites would reverse the R1:R2 bias. On the other hand, if the flanking non-loxP sequences were primarily responsible for the observed resolution bias, reversing the loxP orientation should not affect the R1:R2 ratio. We found that Cre preferentially resolved the χrev substrate on the top strands, giving predominantly the R2 product and thus reversing the R1:R2 ratio (Fig.3, lane 4). Therefore, we concluded that for our synthetic χ structures, the bias in the direction of resolution was not dictated by the flanking non-homologous sequences in the arms. Nonetheless, we cannot rule out the possibility that the flanking sequences in the arms of the α-derived χ substrate or some other factors could be responsible for the unbiased resolution observed by Hoess et al. (8Hoess R. Wierzbicki A. Abremski K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6840-6844Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) (see “Discussion”). Because the central 8-bp sequence is the only asymmetric feature of the loxP site, we investigated how this asymmetric sequence influences the direction of resolution. We constructed synthetic χ structures containing altered sequences in the central 8-bp region, but the same flanking sequences in the arms as χp (Table II). The results for the resolution of these altered χ structures are shown in Fig. 3, and the resolution biases (expressed as the R1:R2ratios) are summarized in Table II. The χsa and χsb structures contain symmetric lox sites corresponding to either the left or right half of the wild-type loxP site, respectively. Cre resolved both these symmetric substrates without bias, giving a R1:R2 ratio of close to 1 (Fig. 3, lanes 6 and 8). This indicates that the asymmetricloxP spacer sequence is responsible for the observed bias in the direction of resolution. To narrow down the sequences within the loxP central region responsible for the bias in the direction of resolution, we first focused on positions 4′/3′ and 4/3 surrounding the scissile phosphates. In the wild-type loxP site, an AT dinucleotide step surrounds the top cleavage site (positions 4′ and 3′), whereas a GC dinucleotide step surrounds the bottom cleavage site (positions 4 and 3). When the dinucleotide steps at these positions were interchanged in the χ34 structure, the direction of resolution was changed (Fig. 3, lane 10). Most of the resolution bias was abolished when we placed either a GC step (χGC) (Fig. 3,lane 12) or an AT step (χAT) (lane 14) at both cleavage sites, although χGC still exhibited a small bottom strand bias. The Cre-lox co-crystal structures show that the protein-DNA contacts within the 6-bp overlap region are not base-specific (21Guo F. Gopaul D.N. Van Duyne G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7143-7148Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 26Guo F. Gopaul D.N. Van Duyne G.D. Nature. 1997; 389: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar,27Gopaul D.N. Guo F. Van Duyne G.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4175-4187Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the nucleotides immediately 5′ to the scissile phosphates (positions 4′ and 4) appear to be involved in an asymmetric contact with Lys86 (21Guo F. Gopaul D.N. Van Duyne G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7143-7148Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Lee and Saito (20Lee G. Saito I. Gene. 1998; 216: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) found that these outermost base pairs of the asymmetric region are important for recombination. We therefore examined in more detail how the sequences at these two positions affect the direction of resolution. Interchanging the AT base pair at position 4′ and the GC base pair at position 4 in the χ4 substrate reversed the resolution bias (Fig. 3, lane 16). The resolution bias was essentially eliminated when there was either a guanine (χ4′G) (Fig. 3, lane 18) or an adenine (χ4A) (lane 20) at positions 4′ and 4, although χ4A still retained a slight top strand bias. Thus far, we studied only transition substitutions at positions 4′ and 4 and found that Cre preferentially resolved adjacent to an A over a G at these positions. We wondered how a pyrimidine at the corresponding positions would affect the directionality of resolution. To answer this question, we made transversion substitutions at these positions. The χ structures are named χ#N, where the number (#) refers to the mutated position and the base N refers to the mutated base 5′ to the scissile phosphate (Table II). For example, χ4C contains a 4G → C substitution adjacent to the bottom cleavage site. This χ4C substrate was resolved equally in either direction (Fig. 3, lane 22). Comparison between the minor top strand bias of χ4A and the unbiased resolution of χ4C suggests that resolution at 4C is preferred slightly over 4A. This was further evident for χ4′C, in which a 4′A → C substitution enhanced the top strand bias to a small extent (Fig. 3, lane 26) compared with χp. A 4G → T substitution (χ4T) also resulted in a stronger top strand bias (Fig. 3, lane 24) than χp, suggesting that resolution at 4T is less favored than at 4G. This was indeed the case for χ4′T, which displayed 2.5-fold bias toward the bottom strand (Fig. 3, lane 28; and Table II). These results indicate that Cre appears to possess the following hierarchical resolution preference for the base that is immediately 5′ to the scissile phosphate: C ≥ A > G > T. The mutations in the lox spacer region not only affect the resolution bias, but can also affect the total amount of resolution products. Fig. 4 is a graphic representation of the total amounts of R1 and R2 products that accumulated at equilibrium. Most of the mutant χ structures s"

One notable exception is CtpA, a carboxyl-terminal processing protease found in cyanobacteria and chloroplasts (2Pakrasi H.B. Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes.

In these photosynthetic organisms, photosystem II (PSII),1 a large membrane-bound pigment-protein complex (4Nanba O. Satoh K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Saenger W. Orth P. Nature. 2001; 409: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1776) Google Scholar), catalyzes light-induced oxidation of water to molecular oxygen, a critically important process in the biosphere. The life history of PSII is extremely interesting. As a direct consequence of its normal function, D1, one of the catalytic component proteins of PSII, is damaged and subsequently removed. A newly synthesized D1 protein with a carboxyl-terminal extension is then integrated into the PSII complex (7Zhang L. Paakkarinen V. van Wijk K.J. Aro E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16062-16067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The processing of the extension peptide on the precursor form of the D1 protein (pD1) is a prerequisite step for the formation of a tetramanganese cluster that is essential for the catalysis of the water oxidation reaction (8Diner B.A. Ries D.F. Cohen B.N. Metz J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8972-8980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Bowyer J.R. Packer J.C.L. McCormack B.A. Whitelegge J.P. Robinson C. Taylor M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5424-5433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (hereafterSynechocystis 6803), the carboxyl-terminal extension in pD1 is 16 amino acids long (10Nixon P.J. Trost J.T. Diner B.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10859-10871Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that the presence of this extension is required for optimal photosynthetic performance ofSynechocystis 6803 cells (11Ivleva N.B. Shestakov S.V. Pakrasi H.B. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 1403-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Mutants that lack catalytically active CtpA are unable to remove the carboxyl-terminal extension of the pD1 protein. As a consequence, they lack the ability to evolve oxygen, presumably because the carboxyl terminus of the mature D1 protein functions as a ligand for the formation of the manganese cluster in PSII (10Nixon P.J. Trost J.T. Diner B.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10859-10871Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The ctpA gene was initially identified by genetic complementation analysis of specific photosynthetic mutant strains of Synechocystis 6803 (12Shestakov S.V. Anbudurai P.R. Stanbekova G.E. Gadzhiev A.

Inagaki N. Yamamoto Y. Taguchi F. Matsumoto A. Satoh K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1995; 36: 1169-1177Google Scholar) followed by cloning and characterization of the plant nuclear gene encoding this enzyme (15Inagaki N. Yamamoto Y. Mori H. Satoh K. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 30: 39-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Our initial studies showed that the CtpA proteins from cyanobacteria and green plants share significant sequence similarities (15Inagaki N. Yamamoto Y. Mori H. Satoh K. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 30: 39-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 16Oelmüller R. Herrmann R.G. Pakrasi H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21848-21856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, none of them exhibits sequence homology with other proteases with well defined reaction mechanisms. In addition, in vitro inhibitor studies have demonstrated that the CtpA enzyme cannot be classified as an aspartic, cysteine, serine, or metalloprotease (17Yamamoto Y. Inagaki N. Satoh K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7518-7525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Based on sequence homologies, the CtpA protease was assigned to a newly emerging class of carboxyl-terminal processing proteases that also included the tail-specific protease Tsp from Escherichia coli (18Silber K.R. Keiler K.C. Sauer R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 19Keiler K.C. Waller P.R.H. Sauer R.T. Science. 1996; 271: 990-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). The members of this family of proteases exhibit significant degrees of sequence homology in certain discrete regions of the proteins. These regions of conserved sequences can be classified broadly as two domains, namely 1 and 2 (domains A and B in Ref. 15Inagaki N. Yamamoto Y. Mori H. Satoh K. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 30: 39-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), respectively. To understand the functional roles of various conserved amino acid residues and domains of the CtpA protein in its biological activity, we have, in this study, generated 23 targeted mutant strains by site-directed mutagenesis of Synechocystis 6803. Alanine scanning mutations were first introduced at each of 14 residues that are completely conserved among members of this protease family (15Inagaki N. Yamamoto Y. Mori H. Satoh K. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 30: 39-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Residues that were thus found to be critical for photoautotrophic growth were subsequently altered by conservative substitutions to gain an in-depth understanding of the catalytic activity of this protease. The mutants thus generated were analyzed for their ability of photoautotrophic growth. We also measured PSII-mediated oxygen evolution activity and the cellular CtpA protease content in these mutant strains. Finally, the half-lives of the pD1 protein in these mutants were determined by in vivo pulse-chase experiments. Our data indicated that replacements of 9 of the 14 selected residues did not affect the catalytic activity of CtpA but significantly decreased the cellular content of this protein. On the other hand, five residues were critically important for the in vivoprocessing of the pD1 protein in Synechocystis 6803 cells. All chemicals used were of reagent grade. Enzymes for recombinant DNA work were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Synechocystis 6803 wild type and mutant cells were grown at 30 °C under 50 µmol of photons m−2 s−1 of white light in BG11 medium (20Allen M.M. J. Phycol. 1968; 4: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). Liquid cultures were grown with vigorous bubbling with air. The medium used for the heterotrophic mutants was supplemented with 5 mm glucose. Solid medium was supplemented with 1.5% (w/v) agar, 0.3% (w/v) sodium thiosulfate, and 10 mm TES-KOH, pH 8.2. A ΔctpA mutant was used as the background strain to generate various site-specific mutations in the ctpA gene. The ΔctpA mutant strain was generated by transforming wild type Synechocystis 6803 cells with the recombinant plasmid pSL795. To construct the pSL795 plasmid, we used the pSL794 plasmid that has the ctpA gene along with its flanking regions as a 6-kb HindIII-BamHI fragment (12Shestakov S.V. Anbudurai P.R. Stanbekova G.E. Gadzhiev A. Lind L.K. Pakrasi H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19354-19359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) cloned in the pUC119 vector. A 1.5-kb EcoRI fragment containing an erythromycin-resistance cassette was inserted into pSL794 after the plasmid was digested with EcoRI, which replaced a 1.4-kb fragment containing the complete coding sequence of the ctpAgene by the cassette. The ΔctpA mutant was grown in the BG11 medium supplemented with 5 mm glucose and 3 µg ml−1 erythromycin. The CtpAk strain was used as a positive control in the current study. It was generated by transforming the ΔctpA mutant with the pSL958 plasmid (Fig. 1). The pSL958 plasmid has thectpA gene along with an upstream hypothetical open reading frame and downstream rbcL sequences cloned in pUC119. Furthermore, a 1.1-kb kanamycin-resistance cassette was inserted at anEcoRI site immediately downstream of the ctpAcoding sequence. Complete segregation was followed after transformation and confirmed by PCR. The growth of various cyanobacterial strains was monitored by measurements of light scattering at 730 nm on a DW 2000 spectrophotometer (SLM-Aminco Instruments, Urbana, IL). E. coli strain TG1 (supE hsdΔ5 thiΔ(lac-proAB) F′ (traD36proAB + laci q lacZΔM15)) used for the preparation of various plasmids was grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York1989Google Scholar). Site-specific mutations were generated using a PCR-based method described elsewhere (22Picard V. Ersdal-Badju E. Lu A. Bock S.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2587-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Sequences of upstream and downstream primers are 5′-ATCCCTCGGTACGTTGAACC-3′ and 5′-TCACGAGGCAGACCTCAGCG-3′, respectively, and were used to amplify the entire coding sequence of the ctpA gene. Mutagenic primers are listed in Table I. After PCR mutagenesis, the products were digested with SfiI andMscI (Fig. 2). The resultant fragments were purified and ligated into pSL958 digested with the same pair of restriction enzymes. The presence of the desired mutations in the ctpA gene was confirmed by sequencing of the resultant plasmids on an automated sequencer, model 373S (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using an ABI PRISM dye-primer cycle sequencing kit. The generation of the desired mutants was achieved by transforming ΔctpA cells with individual plasmids using a previously described procedure (23Dzelzkalns V.A. Bogorad L.

The rates of PSII-mediated oxygen evolution from intact Synechocystis 6803 cells were measured on a Clark-type oxygen electrode in the presence of 0.5 mm 2,6-dichloro-p-benzoquinone and 1 mm K3Fe(CN)6 as described previously (25Mannan R.M. Pakrasi H.B. Plant Physiol. 1993; 103: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Samples in BG11 medium were adjusted to a final chlorophyll concentration of 5 µg ml−1 (26Lichtenthaler H.K. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 148: 350-382Crossref Scopus (9424) Google Scholar). For the expression of the mature form of the CtpA protein in E. coli, a translation initiation codon incorporated into an NdeI recognition site was introduced into the ctpA gene by PCR. The PCR products were digested with NdeI and EcoRI and cloned into the pET21a vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) digested with the same pair of restriction enzymes. The resultant plasmid (pSL962) was transformed into the E. coli strain BL21(DE3). After induction, the recombinant overexpressed protein was purified by SDS-PAGE (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and used to raise anti-CtpA antisera in a rabbit. Anti-D1 antisera used during this study were kind gift from Prof. M. Ikeuchi (University of Tokyo). Proteins obtained from sonicated Synechocystis 6803 cells were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Detection of the CtpA and D1 proteins by Western blotting analysis was carried out using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Ltd., Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, UK). The relative amounts of CtpA was estimated using the Intelligent Quantifier software (BioImage, Ann Arbor, MI). Cyanobacterial cells (5 × 108) were collected by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 5 min. The resultant pellet was washed twice with BG11 and resuspended in 100 µl of BG11. Five µl ofl-[35S]methionine (37 TBq/mmol, 370 MBq/ml,Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were added into the suspension, and the cells were incubated for 5 min at 30 °C under 90 µE m−2 s−1 of heat-absorbed incandescent light. After this pulse period, chloramphenicol (200 µg ml−1) was added to the cells, which were then incubated for various chase periods. Twenty µl of sample were collected after each chase period, and cells were washed once with a lysis buffer containing 20 mm HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm p-4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (p-ABSF) and resuspended into 20 µl of the same buffer. The cells were then disrupted in a small glass homogenizer with glass beads (≤106 µm, Sigma). Two hundred µl of sample buffer for SDS-PAGE were added to the homogenate. The resultant mixture was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 25 °C, the supernatant was fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and the labeled D1 protein was visualized by fluorography. The half-life of the precursor form of the D1 protein in each mutant was estimated by analyzing the resultant fluorographs using the Intelligent Quantifier software (BioImage). The protein encoded by the ctpA gene inSynechocystis 6803 has 427 amino acids. To evaluate the contributions of different residues to the in vivo activity of CtpA, we chose 14 amino acid residues that are absolutely conserved among different members of this protease family and are, hence, expected to be important for their catalytic activities (Fig.3 b) (15Inagaki N. Yamamoto Y. Mori H. Satoh K. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 30: 39-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Among these residues, 10 are localized in two highly conserved domains, named 1 and 2 (domains A and B in Ref. 15Inagaki N. Yamamoto Y. Mori H. Satoh K. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 30: 39-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), respectively. The extent of conservation of these domains among different members of the family are shown in Fig. 3 b. Site-directed mutagenesis was employed to introduce specific substitutions at each of these 14 residues in the CtpA protein of Synechocystis 6803. Initially, we introduced alanine at each of these positions. Sites thus determined to be important for the in vivo enzymatic activity of CtpA were further subjected to semiconservative substitutions. We have previously determined that in the absence of CtpA activity, Synechocystis 6803 cells can not grow photoautotrophically (13Anbudurai P.R. Mor T.S. Ohad I. Shestakov S.V. Pakrasi H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8082-8086Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The photoautotrophic capabilities of the 14 different alanine substitution mutants are shown in TableII. Using anti-CtpA antisera in Western blot analysis, we determined that the amount of CtpA in wild typeSynechocystis 6803 cells is 0.0026% of its total cellular protein content (data not shown). Thus, CtpA is a relatively minor protein in these cells, consistent with its regulatory role in the biogenesis of PSII. We determined the cellular CtpA content (Fig.4 and Table II) and the status of the D1 protein (Table II) in the alanine substitution mutants. First, the CtpA content of the CtpAk control strain was 53% of that of the wild type strain. In the CtpAk strain, a kanamycin-resistance cassette was introduced at an EcoRI site immediately downstream of the ctpA coding sequence, which might have decreased the stability of the corresponding transcript and/or efficiency of its translation. However, this control strain had normal PSII-mediated oxygen evolution activity as well as a pD1 half-life that was comparable with that in the wild type cells (Table III).Table IIGrowth property, CtpA protease content, and the status of the D1 protein in mutant strains with alanine substitutions at fourteen selected residues of the CtpA proteinStrainPhotoautotrophic growthCtpA ContentStatus of D1 protein2-aM, mature form of D1; P, precursor form of D1.

Results shown are those from a representative experiment. As shown in Fig. 4 and Table II, alanine substitution of each of nine residues, namely Asp-149, Arg-198, Asn-257, Ser-315, Asp-324, Arg-327, Gln-342, Thr-356, and Asp-376 reduced the cellular content of CtpA significantly. However, all of these mutant strains could grow photoautotrophically, and they accumulated the D1 protein in its mature form. It is noteworthy that the CtpA contents of both the A149A and the R198A mutants were less than 5% of the normal amount. Evidently, the presence of very small amounts of functional CtpA enzyme was sufficient to process the pD1 protein in Synechocystis 6803 cells. Clearly, none of these nine residues is essential for the catalytic activity of the CtpA protease. In contrast, alanine substitution of each of the remaining five residues resulted in the loss of photoautotrophic growth of the corresponding mutant strains. All of these five mutants accumulated the D1 protein in its precursor form, although a significant amount of the CtpA protease was present in each of them. These five residues are localized in the highly conserved domains 1 and 2 of the CtpA protein (Fig. 3 a). Among these residues, Ser-313 and Lys-338 correspond to two active site residues (Ser-430 and Lys-455, respectively) of the Tsp protease from E. coli, previously identified by Keiler and Sauer (28Keiler K.C. Sauer R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28864-28869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Our data indicated that the amino acid residues Asp-253, Arg-255, Ser-313, Glu-316, and Lys-338 are critically important for the in vivo pD1 processing function of the CtpA protease. The above five critical residues were further subjected to conservative replacement mutagenesis. The acidic residue Asp-253 was changed to Glu, another acidic residue, or to Asn, the corresponding amido group-bearing residue. Similarly, Glu-316 was replaced by either Asp or Gln. The two basic residues Arg-255 and Lys-338 were each replaced by two other (potentially) basic residues. Finally, Ser-313 was substituted by cysteine, because in some proteases cysteine can replace the active site serine with retention of proteolytic activity (28Keiler K.C. Sauer R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28864-28869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that wild type Synechocystis 6803 CtpA does not have any cysteine residue. We determined the photoautotrophic growth competence, doubling time, CtpA content, status of the D1 protein (mature or the precursor form), and the rates of PSII-mediated oxygen evolution from the resultant 9 mutant strains (Table III and Fig. 5). Both D253E and D253N mutations allowed photoautotrophic growth, although at reduced rates. In contrast, the E316D mutant could grow photoautotrophically, whereas the E316Q mutant could not. In addition, the latter mutant strain did not exhibit any PSII activity and accumulated only the precursor form of D1 (Fig. 5). These results indicated that the presence of a negatively charged residue at position 316 is essential for the catalytic activity of CtpA. Similarly, the R255K mutant, but not the R255H mutant, could grow photoautotrophically. It is possible that the His residue at this position may remain in its uncharged form, suggesting that the presence of a positively charged residue at position 255 is necessary for CtpA activity. In contrast, both K338R and K338H mutants had no PSII activity and could not grow photoautotrophically. Thus, Lys-338 is an essential residue for CtpA activity. Finally, the S313C mutant exhibited photoautotrophic growth properties and significant PSII-mediated O2 evolution activity, indicating that a Cys can functionally replace the Ser at the 313 position. Radioactive pulse-chase analysis was performed to determine the half-life of the pD1 protein as an estimate of the in vivo activity of CtpA in various mutants (Fig. 6 and TableIII). All of the non-photoautotrophic alanine substitution mutants had stable pD1 protein. We could not detect any CtpA-dependent processing activity in any of these mutants (data not shown). In the wild type and the ctpAk control strains, the pD1 protein was rapidly converted to its mature form. As described above, five of the nine mutants with conservative replacements could grow autotrophically (Table III). The in vivo half-life of pD1 ranged between 10 and nearly 90 min in these mutant strains. In particular, the E316D and the R255K mutants had unusually slow D1 processing activities. It is noteworthy that the oxygen evolution activities and the rates of photoautotrophic growth of these five mutants correlated well with the activities of their CtpA protease, indicating that the processing of D1 is a rate-limiting step during photosynthetic growth of these mutants. In contrast, the other four mutants in this group did not have any CtpA activity, and in these cells, the pD1 protein was stably accumulated (Fig. 5). In the family of carboxyl-terminal processing proteases, CtpA is the only member with a defined and essential physiological activity. The high specific activity of this endoprotease is a critical determinant during the assembly of functionally competent PSII complexes. In this study, we employed site-directed mutagenesis to generate a series of targeted replacement mutants to identify critical residues for in vivo catalysis by the CtpA enzyme. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis of 14 selected conserved residues revealed that nine mutants, D149A, R198A, N257A, S315A, D324A, R327A, Q342A, T356A, and D376A, could grow photoautotrophically (Table II). In addition, the D1 protein in these mutants was present in its processed form, indicating that these residues do not significantly contribute to the catalytic activity of CtpA. It is noteworthy that with a single exception (S315A), these mutants had significantly reduced cellular content of CtpA (varying between 2 and 36%). We speculate that a plausible role of these eight conserved residues is maintaining the stable structure of the protease in vivo. In contrast, the remaining five residues, namely Asp-253, Arg-255, Ser-313, Glu-316, and Lys-338, are critical determinants for the catalytic activity of CtpA. Alanine substitution of these residues severely disrupted the activity of the CtpA protease. As a consequence, these mutants had unprocessed pD1 protein, lost their oxygen evolution activity, and could not grow photoautotrophically (Table II). All of these five residues are localized in either of the two conserved domains, 1 and 2, of the CtpA protein (Fig. 3 a). Another well studied carboxyl-terminal processing protease is the Tsp enzyme from E. coli. In particular, Keiler and Sauer (28Keiler K.C. Sauer R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28864-28869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) have conducted a detailed in vitro study on a series of Tsp allelic replacement mutants to identify the amino acid residues in the active site of this enzyme. They have concluded that catalysis of the Tsp protease is based on a Ser-Lys dyad mechanism, first described for bacterial signal peptidase, an amino-terminal processing enzyme (29Paetzel M. Dalbey R.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 28-31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar,30Paetzel M. Dalbey R.E. Strynadka N.C. Nature. 1998; 396: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Clearly, Ser-313 and Lys-338, two critical residues in CtpA inSynechocystis 6803 (Fig. 3 a), are functionally homologous with the two active site residues, Ser-430 and Lys-455, of the Tsp protease (28Keiler K.C. Sauer R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28864-28869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In addition, both Tsp (28Keiler K.C. Sauer R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28864-28869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and CtpA (Table III) proteases can function when their respective active site Ser residues are replaced by Cys. Our studies also indicated that Lys-338 is an essential residue in CtpA, because all three of the K338A, K338R, and K338H mutants had no CtpA activity. Based only on these data, one may conclude that the catalytic activity of the CtpA protease is based on the Ser-Lys dyad mechanism and hence is similar to that of the Tsp protease as well as the signal peptidase. In this scenario, Ser-313 and Lys-338 in CtpA might act as a nucleophile and a general base, respectively. Our data also demonstrate that the Asp-253 and Arg-255 residues in the conserved domain 1 were important for the in vivo activity of CtpA. A possible explanation for the absence of D1 processing activity in the D253A mutant is its reduced CtpA content (36% of control, Table II). However, mutants such as D149A and R198A, with 5% or less of control CtpA content (Table II), have processed D1 protein. A more reasonable conclusion is that the Asp-253 residue contributes directly to the catalytic activity of CtpA. A similar reasoning is also applicable to the Arg-255 residue. Recent x-ray structural data of the CtpA protein from the eukaryotic alga Scenedesmus obliquus(31Liao D.-I. Qian J. Chisholm D.A. Jordan D.B. Diner B.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 749-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) indicate that both the Asp-253 and Arg-255 residues are distant from the catalytic center of CtpA. Interestingly, Liao et al. (31Liao D.-I. Qian J. Chisholm D.A. Jordan D.B. Diner B.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 749-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) have suggested that the main chain amide of Gly-318 inScenedesmus (the equivalent of Gly-260 ofSynechocystis 6803 CtpA, Fig. 3 b) contributes to the stabilization of a tetrahedral intermediate. We suggest that Asp-253 and Arg-255, two nearby charged residues, indirectly influence such a stabilization process, presumably an important step during the processing reaction catalyzed by CtpA. An unexpected and exciting finding in the current study is that Glu-316 is also critically important for CtpA activity. In particular, the replacement of Glu-316 with Gln, an uncharged residue with a similar size, abolishes the enzyme activity, whereas replacement of the same residue with Asp still maintains activity although at a reduced level (Fig. 5 and Table III). These data strongly suggest that the negative charge on Glu-316 is directly involved in the catalytic function of CtpA and stand in sharp contrast with the accepted Ser-Lys dyad mechanism of the related enzyme Tsp (28Keiler K.C. Sauer R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28864-28869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In this context, it is noteworthy that in the reported structure of ScenedesmusCtpA, the carboxyl group of Glu-375 (the equivalent of Glu-316 inSynechocystis CtpA) is in close proximity to both of the catalytic residues, Ser and Lys. As pointed out by Liao et al. (31Liao D.-I. Qian J. Chisholm D.A. Jordan D.B. Diner B.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 749-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), in the resting state of the Scenedesmusenzyme, the carboxylate side chain of the Glu-375 residue forms hydrogen bonds with the main chain nitrogens of Gly-396 and Lys-397 and cannot directly interact with the ε-amino group of Lys-397. Although it is possible that the negative charge on this glutamate residue indirectly influences the proposed Ser-Lys dyad activity of the CtpA enzyme, our data also raise the possibility of a Ser-Lys-Glu triad mechanism that may be revealed when the structure of the CtpA enzyme with bound substrate (or substrate analog) is examined at a future time. In any case, further studies are needed to clarify the role of this glutamate residue in CtpA and its close relatives. In summary, we have developed a simple method to identify amino acid residues that are important for the in vivo activity of the CtpA protease in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis 6803. Current ongoing studies in our laboratories are focused on exploiting this system for a more detailed understanding of the catalytic mechanism of the CtpA enzyme. We thank Dr. V. V. Bartsevich for generating the ΔctpA Synechocystis 6803 mutant strain T795 and Prof. M. Ikeuchi for the antisera against the D1 protein."
https://openalex.org/W2046269600,"Trypanosomes use antigenic variation of their variant-specific surface glycoprotein (VSG) coat as defense against the host immune system. However, in order to sustain their growth, they need to expose conserved epitopes, allowing host macromolecule binding and receptor-mediated endocytosis. Here we show that Trypanosoma brucei uses the conserved chitobiose-oligomannose (GlcNAc2-Man5–9) moieties of its VSG as a binding ligand for tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a host cytokine with lectin-like properties. As endocytosis in trypanosomes is restricted to the flagellar pocket, we show that soluble flagellar pocket extracts, and in particular soluble VSG, inhibit the binding of 125I-TNF to trypanosomes. The interaction between TNF and VSG is confirmed by affinity chromatography, biosensor, and dot-blot affinity measurements, and soluble VSG inhibition of TNF-mediated trypanolysis. In all approaches, removal of N-linked carbohydrates abrogates the TNF-VSG interaction. In addition, synthetic high mannose oligosaccharides can block TNF-VSG interactions, and a VSG glycopeptide carrying the GlcNAc2-Man5–9 moiety is shown to inhibit TNF-mediated trypanosome killing in mixed parasite/macrophage cell cultures. Together, these results support the observation that TNF plays a role in growth control of trypanosomes and, moreover, suggest that, by the use of conserved VSG carbohydrates as lectin-binding epitopes, trypanosomes can limit the necessity to express large numbers of invariant surface exposed receptors.

Microbiol. 1994; 48: 25-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), until now the information available on the mechanisms by which parasites can selectively take up host macromolecules has been limited (3Borst P. Fairlamb A.H. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1998; 52: 745-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Indeed, the only trypanosome receptor identified so far is theESAG 6/7-encoded transferrin-binding protein (4Salmon D. Geuskens M. Hanocq F. Hanocq J. Nolan D. Ruben L. Pays E. Cell. 1994; 78: 75-86Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 5Steverding D. Stierhof Y.-D. Fuchs H. Tauber R. Overath P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1173-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 6Bitter W. Gerrits H. Borst P. Nature. 1998; 391: 499-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In contrast, the pathway of endocytosis of host macromolecules itself has been analyzed and documented extensively in case of trypanosomes. Endocytosis was shown only to occur inside the flagellar pocket of the parasite (7Langreth S. Balber B. J. Protozool. 1975; 22: 40-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). This membrane region is unique in the sense that it lacks the structure of closely arranged microtubules that supports the parasite shape over the rest of the cell surface (8Woods A. Sherwin T. Sasse R. McRae T.H. Baines A.J. Gull K. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 93: 491-500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Webster P. Russell D.G. Parasitol. Today. 1993; 9: 201-206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In bloodstream form trypanosomes, uptake of macromolecules through the flagellar pocket seems to occur via the classic pathway of coated pit formation and transport by coated vesicles to lysozyme-like organelles. This has been described for the uptake of ferritin (7Langreth S. Balber B. J. Protozool. 1975; 22: 40-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and transferrin (4Salmon D. Geuskens M. Hanocq F. Hanocq J. Nolan D. Ruben L. Pays E. Cell. 1994; 78: 75-86Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), for the trypanolytic factor associated with high density lipoprotein (10Hager K.M. Pierce M.A. Moore D.R. Tytler E.M. Esko J.D. Hajduk S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 155-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and for the inflammatory host cytokine TNF (11Magez S. Geuskens M. Beschin A. Del Favero H. Verscheuren R. Lucas R. Pays E. De Baetselier P. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 715-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this pathway is also involved in recycling of VSG (12Seyfang A. Mecke D. Duszenko M. J. Protozool. 1990; 37: 546-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). As the speed of endocytosis in trypanosomes is extremely high, estimates suggest that the parasite may internalize and recycle as much as 5% of its VSG surface molecules every minute (13Overath P. Stierhof Y.-D. Wiese M. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 27-33Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Here it should be mentioned that, during the passage of VSG through the flagellar pocket, epitopes that are shielded on the coat, due to the tight VSG packing, become surface-exposed. For instance, specific lectin labeling of VSG carbohydrate epitopes occurs only in the flagellar pocket (14Brickman M.J. Balber A.E. J. Protozool. 1990; 37: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In this context, we now show that flagellar pocket-exposed VSG can serve as a receptor for the host cytokine TNF and that binding occurs via a lectin-like interaction involving the chitobiose-oligomannose (GlcNAc2-Man5–9) moiety of theN-linked VSG carbohydrate side chain. Together, the results presented in this work suggest that, although trypanosomes must be able to complete their life cycle in different host species, they can circumvent the necessity to express a wide range of specific receptors by utilizing conserved VSG carbohydrate moieties as lectin-ligands. Furthermore, the results corroborate the direct role of TNF in the control of African trypanosomosis, through parasite lysis described forTrypanosoma brucei (15Lucas R.S. Magez S. De Leys R. Fransen L. Scheerlinck J.P. Rampelberg M. Sablon E. De Baetselier P. Science. 1994; 263: 814-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and most recently forTrypanosoma gambiense (16Daulouéde S. Bouteille B. Moynet D. De Baetselier P. Courtous P. Lemesre J.-L. Buguet A. Cespuglio R. Vincendeau P. J. Infect. Dis. 2001; 183: 988-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Bloodstream form parasites (T. bruceiAnTat 1.1) were isolated at day 6 (peak) of infection, from C3H/HeN mice injected intraperitoneally on day 0 with 1000 trypanosomes/mouse. Trypanosomes were purified on a DEAE 52 column as described (17Lanham S.N. Nature. 1968; 218: 1273-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) and incubated with different concentrations of 125I-TNF (2–80 nm) (Innogenetics) in sterile polystyrene round-bottom tubes (Falcon) at a concentration of 108 trypanosomes/ml in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 8.0) supplemented with 0.1% glucose and 5% fetal calf serum. After a 5-h incubation on ice, cells were washed six times with ice-cold PBS by mild centrifugation (1800 rpm/10 min). The amount of labeled material bound to the cells was measured with a Wizard™ 1470 automatic γ-counter (Wallac). Inhibition of binding was tested by pre-incubating the parasites during 1 h at 4 °C with a 100-fold molar excess of cold TNF (Innogenetics). In parallel, inhibition of binding was tested by pre-incubation of the125I-TNF with flagellar pocket (Fp) extract from T. brucei AnTat 1.1 parasites (18Nolan D.P. Geuskens M. Pays E. Curr. Biol. 1999; 20: 1169-1172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (90) Google Scholar) (100 μg/ml), VSG (50 μg/ml), or N-glycosidase F-treated (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) VSG (50 μg/ml). For the comparative inhibitory capacity of VSG, enzyme-digested VSG molecules, VSG carbohydrate moieties, and irrelevant oligosaccharides, parasites were incubated with 40 nm125I-TNF. Inhibition experiments were performed using VSG (50 μg/ml) or different oligosaccharides (5 μm) obtained from GlycoScience or Sigma (GlcNAc2). Mini-Leak Sepharose resin (Kem-En-Tec, Biozym) was used to covalently bind VSG or transferrin. The resin (0.5 ml) was washed with distilled water on a suction filter, and 0.5 mg of protein dialyzed against saline was bound overnight at 4 °C in the presence of 7% polyethylene glycol solution. The coupling yield was determined by measurement of optical density at 280 nm before and after coupling. To block excess of activated groups, 2 column volumes of 0.2 m ethanolamine were used and incubated for 5 h at room temperature. Finally, the resin was washed extensively with 0.1 mK2HPO4/NaOH (pH 11), followed by 0.1m glycine/HCl (pH 2.8). Binding of 125I-TNF to the different columns was analyzed by incubating 1 μg of the labeled cytokine overnight at 4 °C. After washing with 10 column volumes of PBS and 10 volumes of 1 m NaCl to remove weakly or non-covalently bound protein, the columns were washed with 0.1m glycine/HCl (pH 2.8). Fractions were collected as 100-μl aliquots and analyzed with a Wizard™ 1470 automatic γ-counter (Wallac). Affinity measurements between TNF and VSG from T. brucei AnTat 1.1 parasites were performed using the Iasys instrument with aminosilane cuvettes (Affinity Sensors) as an optical biosensor (11Magez S. Geuskens M. Beschin A. Del Favero H. Verscheuren R. Lucas R. Pays E. De Baetselier P. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 715-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 19Edwards P.R. Gill A. Pollard-Knight D.V. Hoare M. Lowe P.E. Leatherbarrow R. J. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 321: 210-217Crossref Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The immobilization of cytokines to aminosilane was performed as follows. After pre-incubation of the aminosilane cuvettes with 10 mmphosphate buffer (pH 7.7), the homobifunctional cross-linker bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) substrate (Pierce) was added for 10 min to activate the surface. Following re-equilibration with phosphate buffer, TNF was immobilized for 10 min at 100 μg/ml in phosphate buffer. Remaining active sites were blocked with 1 m ethanolamine (pH 9.0). Unbound cytokine was removed by a single wash with 50 mm HCl. Specific binding resulted in a 300–500-arcsecond laser reflection shift. All binding reactions were performed at 27 °C in PBS. Different concentrations of VSG were injected into the cytokine-loaded cuvettes (1–200 nm). Association and dissociation (after removal of the excess of unbound ligand) were measured (Iasys software, Affinity Sensors). Regeneration of the cuvette was obtained by washing with 0.2% SDS in PBS. The obtained data were analyzed by non-linear regression, using the FASTfit software (Affinity Sensors). The association constant ka was determined using the slope of the kon versus the VSG concentration. The dissociation constantkd was directly measured from dissociation experiments. KD values equalkd /ka. In parallel with soluble VSG, the binding of N-glycosidase-treated VSG, α-mannosidase-treated VSG, and transferrin were tested using the same protocol. Affinity measurements between TNF and purified soluble VSG were performed using a dot blot technique. VSG or VSG-derived peptides were blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane at a concentration of 25 μg/spot. The membrane was incubated for 2 h in 3% casein/PBS (pH 7.2), washed two times with PBS supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma), and subsequently incubated overnight with different dilutions of 125I-TNF (2–80 nm) in PBS (pH 7.2) supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin. Unbound cytokine was removed by extensive washings in PBS supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20. Specific binding was measured by Molecular Imager (Bio-Rad). Inhibition of specific binding was assayed by pre-incubation of the membranes with a 100-fold excess of cold TNF. The binding data were analyzed using the Prism program (GraphPad Software Inc.). The estimation of KD was obtained via a one-site binding fit (hyperbola). For preparation of VSG, the following trypanosome strains were used: AnTat 1.1, MITat 1.1, MITat 1.4, MITat 1.5, and MITat 1.6. Soluble VSG was obtained through osmotic lysis of trypanosomes by 30-min incubation at 4 °C in 125 mmNaH2PO4 (pH 5.5; 109 cells/ml), followed by a 5-min incubation at 37 °C in 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8.0). The supernatant was passed through a column of DEAE52 equilibrated in 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8.0). Following a buffer exchange to 10 mm Tris (pH 8.1) on a G25 desalting column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), sVSG was further purified by high performance liquid chromatography (Akta, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a Resource Q anion exchange column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 10 mm Tris (pH 8.1). A linear NaCl gradient reaching 100 mm was used to elute VSG. Protein concentrations of the VSG were estimated by a detergent-compatible protein assay kit (Bio-Rad), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. N-Glycosidase F from Flavobacterium meningosepticum (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol to remove N-linked carbohydrates from VSG using 5 units/ml enzyme (24 h at 30 °C). As a control, VSG was processed in parallel in the absence of the enzyme. Deglycoslyated proteins were isolated with a concanavalin A column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using PBS for equilibration and elution. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected and tested for carbohydrate content using the silica gel TLC (Filterservice) and orcinol (Sigma) spray technique. Further confirmation of carbohydrate removal was obtained by 8% SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. For VSG size determination, 1 μg of VSG was loaded per lane, and a polyclonal rabbit anti-VSG antiserum (1/10,000) was used for detection, in combination with a horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit polyclonal antibody (1/500) (Sigma). As a control, purified transferrin was used at the same concentration (Sigma). For α-mannosidase digestion, the jack bean enzyme (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used according to the same protocol as the one used for N-glycosidase F treatment. Purification of the enzyme treated fraction was performed with a concanavalin A column, as described above. For HF treatment, VSG was dissolved in 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0) by dialysis, and lyophilized. Next, VSG was resuspended in 50% ice-cold HF, incubated on ice for 48 h, and lyophilized twice, resuspending the VSG each time in 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0). A purified VSG fraction, lacking the GIP/GPI core was obtained through a final gel filtration on a S75 (3.2/30) column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0). For Pronase digestion, VSG was dissolved in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate at 20 mg/ml supplemented with Pronase (2% w/w) and 10 μl of toluene. After an overnight incubation (37 °C), fresh Pronase was added (0.2% w/w) and another 24-h incubation was performed (37 °C). 1 m acetic acid was added to completely neutralize the ammonium bicarbonate. The digested material was centrifuged to remove insoluble material, and the supernatant was passed through a Dowex AG50X12 cation-exchange column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with 10 mm acetic acid. The column was eluted with 4 column volumes of 10 mm acetic acid. A 0.1 volume of 100 mmammonium hydroxide was added to the eluate in order to neutralize the acetic acid. The collected fraction was applied to an anion-exchange column (QAE-A25 Sephadex; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 10 mm ammonium acetate. The column was washed with 10 ml of 10 mm ammonium acetate, followed by a linear gradient to 400 mm ammonium acetate. Fractions of 1 ml were collected and lyophilized. Fractions were resuspended in 20 μl of PBS and checked for carbohydrate contents on a silica gel TLC plate (Filterservice) and sprayed with orcinol reagent (Sigma). The flow-through, containing N-linked glycopeptides, was diluted in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and loaded onto an analytic microRPC-C2/C18 (ST 4.6/100) reverse phase column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated against the same buffer. A linear gradient to 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 90% acetonitrile was then used to elute bound peptides in 100-μl fractions. Each fraction was lyophilized and resuspended in PBS. The carbohydrate fraction was identified using the TLC plate and orcinol technique. The same protocol was used to isolate the glycopeptide fraction from ribonuclease B (Sigma) and transferrin (Sigma). The in vitro trypanolytic assay was performed as described previously (11Magez S. Geuskens M. Beschin A. Del Favero H. Verscheuren R. Lucas R. Pays E. De Baetselier P. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 715-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), using a TNF concentration of 52 ng/ml (1 nm) in order to obtain maximal lysis within 5 h. Inhibition of lysis was analyzed by pre-incubating TNF with (i) VSG, N-glycosidase F-treated VSG, or α-mannosidase-treated VSG (50 μg/ml); (ii) several glycopeptides or non-glycosylated peptides (50 μg/ml); or (iii) different de novo synthesized carbohydrates (5 μm) (Oxford GlycoSciences). Peritoneal exudate cells (PECs) were harvested from T. brucei AnTat 1.1-infected C57Bl/6 WT or C57Bl/6 TNF−/− mice by a peritoneal wash with 10 ml of ice-cold sucrose/H2O solution (116 g/l). The collected cells were washed in RPMI 1640 complemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.3 mg/ml l-glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.) and put into culture at 37 °C on 96-well culture plates at a concentration of 2 × 106 cells/ml, 100 μl/well. As the PECs were isolated at the first peak of the parasite infection, harvested cells were contaminated with ∼106parasites/ml. The parasite concentration in a 10-μl culture aliquot was followed over a period of 24 h. TNF binding to the surface of African trypanosomes involves a lectin-like event (15Lucas R.S. Magez S. De Leys R. Fransen L. Scheerlinck J.P. Rampelberg M. Sablon E. De Baetselier P. Science. 1994; 263: 814-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and has previously been demonstrated to occur in the Fp, the only membrane region allowing endocytosis (7Langreth S. Balber B. J. Protozool. 1975; 22: 40-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 11Magez S. Geuskens M. Beschin A. Del Favero H. Verscheuren R. Lucas R. Pays E. De Baetselier P. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 715-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). As such we have investigated the involvement of Fp glycoproteins in binding of the cytokine, using a purified Fp fraction that was obtained by a grinding/ultracentrifugation method. Fig.1 A shows that, when125I-labeled mouse TNF and living T. b. bruceiAnTat 1.1 were incubated together at 4 °C in the presence of 5% fetal calf serum, the cytokine bound to the parasites in a receptor-mediated fashion. Preincubation of the cytokine with the Fp fraction (100 μg/ml) blocked the binding of 125I-TNF to a similar extent as the inhibition obtained by preincubating parasites with a 100-fold molar excess of cold TNF. Next, as VSG is a major component of the Fp fraction, the inhibitory capacity of purified soluble VSG was tested, as well as the role of the VSGN-linked carbohydrate moiety. Here, it must be emphasized that the AnTat 1.1 VSG is a type I VSG, carrying one single glycosylated site (20Zamze S.E. Wooten E.W. Ashford D.A. Ferguson M.A. Dwek R.A. Rademacher T.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 657-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 B shows that, when added in excess, purified VSG was equally potent in inhibition of125I-TNF binding to living trypanosomes as the total Fp fraction, whereas removal of the N-linked GlcNAc2-Man5–9 carbohydrate moiety, a VSG epitope that is only exposed inside the Fp (14Brickman M.J. Balber A.E. J. Protozool. 1990; 37: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), abrogated this inhibition. The complete removal of the carbohydrate chain from the VSG after N-glycosidase F enzyme digestion was guaranteed by using only a non-ConA binding VSG fraction. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 2, the purity of the soluble VSG preparations and the removal of the N-linked carbohydrate chain were checked by SDS-PAGE in combination with a VSG-specific Western blot revelation, an orcinol-carbohydrate staining on dot blot, and a Coomassie Blue protein staining. As shown in lane A1, VSG appeared as one single band in Western blot, and stained positive in orcinol staining for carbohydrate presence even at 0.5 μg/dot. N-Glycosidase F-digested VSG (lane A2) appeared with a slightly reduced molecular weight, and stained positive in orcinol staining only at a concentration of 5 μg/dot. In addition, a HF treatment of VSG was performed to remove the GIP/GPI carbohydrate core of the soluble molecule. Lane A3 shows that this treatment has only a limited influence on the migration of VSG in SDS-PAGE and the orcinol dot blot staining. Finally, a HF treatment of the N-glycosidase F-digested VSG was performed, in order to obtain completely carbohydrate-free VSG that was used as a negative control for the orcinol staining. The result inlane 4 confirms the removal of all VSG carbohydrates, and furthermore indicates that the minimal orcinol staining of the N-glycosidase F-digested VSG inlane 2 is only due to the presence of the GIP/GPI carbohydrate core. Purity of the VSG preparation is confirmed by the Coomassie Blue protein staining of Fig. 2 B.Figure 2A, VSG preparations and efficiency of VSG carbohydrate removal were analyzed on Western blot and a combination of dot blot and orcinol staining.

Here, 1 μg of the labeled cytokine was allowed to bind overnight at 4 °C to a column containing 0.5 mg of VSG coupled on 500-μl matrix. Next, the column was washed with 10 volumes of PBS and 10 volumes of NaCl (1m) in order to remove non-bound and nonspecific bound material. The remaining binding fraction was eluted with glycine/HCl (0.1 m; pH 2.8), collected in 100-μl fractions, quantified in a Wizard™ 1470 automatic γ-counter, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3, panel A). In parallel, two other columns were used with, respectively, Sepharose-N-glycosidase F-treated VSG and a Sepharose-α-mannosidase-treated VSG. Virtually no labeled TNF was found to bind to these columns (Fig. 3, panel B). A fourth column, used as an extra negative control column, made with Sepharose-transferrin, also failed to bind 125I-TNF (results not shown). In order to further confirm the direct interaction between TNF and VSG and to determine the affinity of the interaction, the binding between the two molecules was studied with the aid of an optical biosensor, using a methodology previously implemented to demonstrate TNF-α binding on total trypanosome-soluble extracts (11Magez S. Geuskens M. Beschin A. Del Favero H. Verscheuren R. Lucas R. Pays E. De Baetselier P. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 715-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). First, using immobilized TNF-aminosilane, the association and dissociation was measured for soluble VSG and both N-glycosidase F-treated and α-mannosidase-treated VSG. Fig. 4(A–F) gives the experimental readouts of conditions in which different concentrations of VSG (from 200 down to 10 nm) were allowed to interact with the immobilized TNF during the binding and dissociation phase of the experiment. Monitoring for each condition both binding and dissociation rates allowed the determination of the kon andkd, yielding a KD value of 73.2 ± 32.3 nm for the interaction between TNF and AnTat 1.1 VSG (Table I), a value in the same range as the previously recorded affinity of TNF for total trypanosome lysate (11Magez S. Geuskens M. Beschin A. Del Favero H. Verscheuren R. Lucas R. Pays E. De Baetselier P. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 715-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). As a negative control, the interaction between TNF and N-glycosidase F-treated VSG (Fig. 4 G) and TNF and α-mannosidase-treated VSG (Fig. 4 H) was recorded at a ligand concentration of 200 nm. As a negative binding control transferrin was added to the TNF-coated cuvettes at a concentration of 200 nm. No binding was observed here (results not shown).Table IAffinity measurements of TNF/VSG interactions (KD in nm)VSGLysateBiosensor AnTat 1.173.2 ± 32.337.2 ± 14.41-cSee Ref. 11.

Open table in a new tab ND, no binding detectable; NA, not applicable. Although by definition VSG molecules are very heterogeneous in terms of their amino acid sequence and both their glycosylation pattern and number of glycosylation sites, they all share one conservedN-linked GlcNAc2-Man5–9 moiety (21Mehlert A. Zitzmann N. Richardson J. Treumann A. Ferguson M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 91: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Therefore, the KD value for the interaction between TNF and VSGs belonging to different classes (I, AnTat 1.1, MITat 1.4, MITat 1.6; II, MITat 1.1; III: MITat 1.5) was tested. For this purpose a dot blot technique was adopted. VSGs or total trypanosome extracts were blotted on a nitrocellulose filter (25 μg/spot) and incubated in a 125I-TNF solution (2–80 nm), preventing nonspecific binding interactions by an overnight membrane blocking step using casein. The presence of 1% bovine serum albumin during the binding assay further ensured specificity of the results. The results were analyzed by spot densitometry on a PhosphorImager (Bio-Rad), and theKD values were calculated using a one-site binding hyperbola (GraphPad Software Inc.). Compiled results (Table I) show that all VSGs tested were capable of binding TNF. TheKD values were all found to be in the same range, independent of the VSG class. Moreover, the range ofKD values for the TNF/VSG interaction corresponded to the KD values calculated for the cytokine interaction with total extracts from the different parasite clones. The fact that different class-specific VSGs bind 125I-TNF with similar affinities suggests that most, if not all, VSGs bind TNF via their conserved N-linked high mannose moiety. The question as to whether the presence of a surface exposed GlcNAc2-Man5–9 moiety of theN-linked VSG carbohydrate side chain inside the Fp of trypanosomes contributes to the biological activities of TNF on the parasite was addressed using the previously reported TNF-mediated trypanolysis assay as a readout system. In this bioassay, performed at 30 °C, a concentration of 1 nm recombinant mouse TNF was used for an incubation period of 5 h. In this assay it was shown that preincubation of TNF with sol"

https://openalex.org/W1977401710,"The CEF-4/9E3 chemokine gene is expressed constitutively in chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) transformed by the Rous sarcoma virus (RSV). This aberrant induction is controlled at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Transcriptional activation depends on multiple elements of the CEF-4 promoter composing a Src-responsive-Unit or SRU. The SRU includes a TPA responsive element, a PRDII/kappaB domain and a CAAT box. In this report, we identify C/EBPbeta as a component of the trans-acting factor interacting with the CAAT box of the CEF-4 promoter. In addition, we show that C/EBPbeta binds to a second element located in proximity of the TRE. A mutation of this distal CAAT box impaired the activation of the CEF-4 promoter by pp60(v-src) indicating that this element is also part of the SRU. Using the RCASBP retroviral vector, we expressed a dominant negative mutant of C/EBPbeta (designated Delta184-C/EBPbeta) in RSV-transformed CEF. Delta184-C/EBPbeta decreased the accumulation of the CEF-4 mRNA and activation of the CEF-4 promoter by pp60(v-src). The induction of the Cox-2 gene (CEF-147) was also reduced by Delta184-C/EBPbeta. The effect of the dominant negative mutant was observed within 1 h of the activation of a thermolabile pp60(v-src) suggesting that C/EBPbeta is an early target of v-src transformation. The dominant negative mutant did not inhibit the transformation of CEF by RSV and in fact accentuated the transformed cell phenotype. Therefore, the activation of C/EBPbeta is important for the expression of v-src regulated genes but is not required for the in vitro transformation of CEF by pp60(v-src)."
