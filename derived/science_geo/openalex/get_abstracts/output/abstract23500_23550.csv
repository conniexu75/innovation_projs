https://openalex.org/W2097186487,"The mammalian olfactory system can recognize and discriminate a large number of different odorant molecules. The detection of chemically distinct odorants presumably results from the association of odorous ligands with specific receptors on olfactory sensory neurons. To address the problem of olfactory perception at a molecular level, we have cloned and characterized 18 different members of an extremely large multigene family that encodes seven transmembrane domain proteins whose expression is restricted to the olfactory epithelium. The members of this novel gene family are likely to encode a diverse family of odorant receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2006987944,"Many human melanoma tumors express antigens that are recognized in vitro by cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTLs) derived from the tumor-bearing patient. A gene was identified that directed the expression of antigen MZ2-E on a human melanoma cell line. This gene shows no similarity to known sequences and belongs to a family of at least three genes. It is expressed by the original melanoma cells, other melanoma cell lines, and by some tumor cells of other histological types. No expression was observed in a panel of normal tissues. Antigen MZ2-E appears to be presented by HLA-A1; anti-MZ2-E CTLs of the original patient recognized two melanoma cell lines of other HLA-A1 patients that expressed the gene. Thus, precisely targeted immunotherapy directed against antigen MZ2-E could be provided to individuals identified by HLA typing and analysis of the RNA of a small tumor sample."
https://openalex.org/W2072889251,"The proposal that all mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) types in contemporary humans stem from a common ancestor present in an African population some 200,000 years ago has attracted much attention. To study this proposal further, two hypervariable segments of mtDNA were sequenced from 189 people of diverse geographic origin, including 121 native Africans. Geographic specificity was observed in that identical mtDNA types are shared within but not between populations. A tree relating these mtDNA sequences to one another and to a chimpanzee sequence has many deep branches leading exclusively to African mtDNAs. An African origin for human mtDNA is supported by two statistical tests. With the use of the chimpanzee and human sequences to calibrate the rate of mtDNA evolution, the age of the common human mtDNA ancestor is placed between 166,000 and 249,000 years. These results thus support and extend the African origin hypothesis of human mtDNA evolution."

The amino acid sequence predicted from complementary DNA clones indicates that the mitogen is a new member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family. This heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) binds to EGF receptors on A-431 epidermoid carcinoma cells and smooth muscle cells, but is a far more potent mitogen for smooth muscle cells than is EGF. HB-EGF is also expressed in cultured human macrophages and may be involved in macrophage-mediated cellular proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W1981136283,"After limited sensory deafferentations in adult primates, somatosensory cortical maps reorganize over a distance of 1 to 2 millimeters mediolaterally, that is, in the dimension along which different body parts are represented. This amount of reorganization was considered to be an upper limit imposed by the size of the projection zones of individual thalamocortical axons, which typically also extend a mediolateral distance of 1 to 2 millimeters. However, after extensive long-term deafferentations in adult primates, changes in cortical maps were found to be an order of magnitude greater than those previously described. These results show the need for a reevaluation of both the upper limit of cortical reorganization in adult primates and the mechanisms responsible for it."

https://openalex.org/W2049114614,"Myn, a novel murine approximately 18 kd basic/helix-loop-helix/""leucine zipper"" (B/HLH/LZ) protein, forms a specific DNA-binding complex with the c-Myc oncoprotein through the HLH/LZ motif in both proteins. c-Myc/Myn recognizes a c-Myc-binding site (GACCACGTGGTC) with higher affinity than either protein by itself. CpG methylation of the recognition site greatly inhibits DNA binding, suggesting that DNA methylation may regulate the c-Myc/Myn complex in vivo. In 3T3 fibroblasts, Myn mRNA levels are induced several-fold by serum with delayed early kinetics, suggesting regulation by immediate-early gene products. Coexpression of Myn in a myc/ras rat embryo fibroblast focus formation assay specifically augmented c-myc transforming activity. We suggest that interaction of Myn with c-Myc stabilizes sequence-specific DNA binding in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W1544430323,"The promyelocytic leukemia (HL60) cell line differentiates into monocyte-like cells after treatment with phorbol dibutyrate (PBt2). In contrast, bryostatin 1 (bryo), a structurally distinct protein kinase C (PKC) activator, does not induce differentiation and blocks the cytostatic effect of PBt2. The divergent responses to these agents correlate with activation of a PKC-like activity at the nucleus in response to bryo but not PBt2 (Fields, A. P., Pettit, G. R., and May, W.S. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 8253-8260). In the present study, this nuclear PKC-like activity (termed PKCn) was isolated from HL60 cells and shown to phosphorylate its known nuclear substrate, lamin B. PKCn-mediated phosphorylation of nuclear envelope-associated lamin B in vitro is calcium-dependent and is stimulated by bryo and 1,2-dioctanoylglycerol (DiC8), but not PBt2. In contrast, PKCn-mediated phosphorylation of histone IIIS is stimulated equally by all three activators. PKCn mediates calcium- and phosphatidylserine-dependent phosphorylation of both histone IIIS and partially purified lamin B. PKCn activity can be inhibited by an anti-PKC monoclonal antibody which specifically inhibits PKC. Isotype-specific PKC antibodies identify PKCn as beta II-PKC. Immunoblot analysis indicates that HL60 cells express both alpha- and beta II-PKC but no beta I- or gamma-PKC. Treatment of intact cells with bryo for 30 min leads to complete translocation of both alpha- and beta II-PKC from the cytosol to the membrane fractions. Approximately 8-10% of the total beta II-PKC (and less than 0.3% of the alpha-PKC) is found associated with the nuclear membrane of bryo-treated cells. In contrast, PBt2 treatment leads to complete translocation of alpha-PKC, but only partial translocation of beta II-PKC to the plasma membrane fraction. Neither PKC isotype is found associated with the nuclear membrane of PBt2-treated cells. These data demonstrate that alpha- and beta II-PKC differ with respect to activator responsiveness, intracellular distribution, and substrate specificity and indicate that their selective activation at distinct intracellular sites, including the nucleus, can have a dramatic effect on resulting cellular responses."
https://openalex.org/W2053875211,"The RNA moiety of the ribonucleoprotein enzyme telomerase contains the template for telomeric DNA synthesis. We present a secondary structure model for telomerase RNA, derived by a phylogenetic comparative analysis of telomerase RNAs from seven tetrahymenine ciliates. The telomerase RNA genes from Tetrahymena malaccensis, T. pyriformis, T. hyperangularis, T. pigmentosa, T. hegewishii, and Glaucoma chattoni were cloned, sequenced, and compared with the previously cloned RNA gene from T. thermophila and with each other. To define secondary structures of these RNAs, homologous complementary sequences were identified by the occurrence of covariation among putative base pairs. Although their primary sequences have diverged rapidly overall, a strikingly conserved secondary structure was identified for all these telomerase RNAs. Short regions of nucleotide conservation include a block of 22 totally conserved nucleotides that contains the telomeric templating region."
https://openalex.org/W2045882841,"A cDNA clone encoding a K+ channel polypeptide with 72% amino acid sequence identity to Drosophila Shal was isolated from rat hippocampus. Functional expression of the cDNA in Xenopus oocytes generated 4-amino-pyridine-sensitive K+ channels displaying rapid inactivation kinetics. The fastest component of inactivation was slowed by the deletion of 3 basic residues in the amino-terminal region. Northern blots revealed that the mRNA encoding this K+ channel polypeptide was expressed at a similar level in the brain and in the heart. In situ hybridization revealed that the mRNA encoding this K+ channel appeared concentrated in the hippocampus, dentate gyrus, and habenular nucleus in the brain. Thus, this K+ channel polypeptide is likely to form some of the A-type K+ channels expressed in the mammalian nervous system and heart."

https://openalex.org/W1558386025,"An adrenal cGMP-stimulated phosphodiesterase (cGS-PDE) has been shown to mediate atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP)-induced reductions in aldosterone secretion and cAMP levels in primary bovine glomerulosa cells. High concentrations of cGS-PDE have been localized to the zona glomerulosa cell layer of the adrenal cortex using biochemical and immunological techniques. Immunoblot analysis using an affinity-purified, isozyme-specific antiserum revealed a single band that comigrated with a purified cGS-PDE (105 kDa) (1) and that was most highly concentrated in the outermost 1-2 mm of the cortex, representing the capsule and zona glomerulosa regions. Greater than 90% of the overall phosphodiesterase activity present in tissue extracts prepared from these regions was immunoprecipitated using a solid-phase monoclonal antibody reagent, indicating the cGS-PDE as the predominant phosphodiesterase isozyme. Immunohistochemical staining experiments of frozen thin sections of intact adrenal tissue revealed that the cGS-PDE present in this region was localized in the glomerulosa cells themselves. The role of this isozyme as a mediator of ANP-induced decreases in intracellular cAMP concentrations and aldosterone production was tested in primary cultures of bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells. In cells stimulated by ACTH, ANP treatment produced dose-dependent reductions in aldosterone secretion and cellular cAMP content over the same concentration range. Increases in aldosterone production elicited by three cell-permeable cAMP derivatives (8-bromo-cAMP, 8-p-chlorophenylthio-cAMP, and N6-2'-O-dibutyryl-cAMP) were antagonized by ANP, indicating a site of action distal to adenylate cyclase for this hormone. Because the relative magnitude of the ANP effect differed depending upon the derivative used, the three derivatives were compared with respect to their relative rates of in vitro hydrolysis by adrenal cGS-PDE. A positive correlation between their rates of hydrolysis and the degree to which the steroidogenic response produced by these derivatives was antagonized by ANP was demonstrated, further suggesting an ANP-induced activation of the cGS-PDE as being responsible for this effect. The possible contribution of an additional pathway mediated by an inhibitory guanine nucleotide binding regulatory protein (Gi) acting on adenylate cyclase was tested by pretreatment of primary glomerulosa cells with pertussis toxin. Levels of pertussis toxin sufficient to inhibit subsequent in vitro ribosylation did not significantly alter the ANP effect on aldosterone production, although a partial reduction in the ANP effect on cAMP levels was observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

Recombinant human GM-CSF has proven useful in the treatment of blood disorders. The structure of GM-CSF, which was determined at 2.4 angstrom resolution by x-ray crystallography, has a novel fold combining a two-stranded antiparallel β sheet with an open bundle of four α helices. Residues implicated in receptor recognition, which are distant in the primary sequence, are on adjacent α helices in the folded protein. A working model for the receptor binding site is presented."
https://openalex.org/W1550942324,"Two types of partial cDNAs encoding human acid sphingomyelinase (EC 3.1.4.12; ASM) were recently isolated from fibroblast and placental cDNA libraries (Quintern, L. E., Schuchman, E.H., Levran, O., Suchi. M., Ferlinz, K., Reinke, H., Sandhoff, K., and Desnick, R. J. (1989) EMBO J. 8, 2469-2473). The cDNA inserts had identical sequences with the exception of an internal region; type 1 cDNAs (representing approximately 90% of the ASM cDNAs isolated) had 172 in-frame base pairs (bp), which were replaced in the type 2 cDNAs by a 40-bp in-frame sequence. Northern hybridization and RNase protection studies indicated that both type 1 and 2 transcripts were approximately 2.5 kilobases; therefore, efforts were directed to isolate full-length type 1 and 2 cDNAs by screening human placental, testis, hepatoma, and retinal cDNA libraries. In addition to type 1 and 2 cDNAs, a new type of ASM cDNA (type 3), which did not contain the type 1- or 2-specific regions, was isolated and sequenced. The full-length type 1 and the reconstructed full-length type 2 and 3 cDNAs were transiently expressed in COS-1 cells. Only the full-length type 1 transcript encoded catalytically active human ASM, demonstrating its functional integrity. The 2347-bp full-length type 1 placental cDNA (pASM-1FL) had an 87-bp 5'-untranslated region, an 1890-bp open reading frame encoding 629 amino acids, and a 370-bp 3'-untranslated sequence. The predicted location of the signal peptide cleavage site was after alanine 46. Two base differences were identified in codons 322 and 506 and shown to be polymorphisms with the common alleles having frequencies of 0.6 and 0.7, respectively. To determine the genomic organization of the type 1, 2, and 3 sequences, a 1665-bp genomic region containing both the unique type 1 (172 bp) and type 2 (40 bp) sequences was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and sequenced. The 172-bp sequence was exonic, flanked by 5'- and 3'-intronic sequences of 1052 and 229 bp, respectively. The 40-bp type 2 sequence was intronic, occurring at the 5' end of the 1052-bp intron due to the use of a cryptic 5' donor splice site, which deleted the entire 172-bp exon and both flanking intronic sequences. The type 3 cDNA resulted from an alternative splicing event, which excised the 172-bp exon. These studies demonstrate the occurrence of alternatively splicing of the ASM transcript, but the existence of only one functional mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W2105239484,"Previous studies have suggested that the differentiated state of meiosis in yeast is regulated primarily at the transcriptional level. This study reports a case of posttranscriptional regulation of a gene whose product is essential for meiosis. The MER2 gene is transcribed in mitosis as well as meiosis; however, the transcript is spliced efficiently to generate a functional gene product only in meiosis. Meiotic levels of splicing depend on the MER1 gene product, which is also essential for meiosis and which is produced only in meiotic cells. Therefore, at least one of the functions of the MER1 protein is to mediate splicing of the MER2 transcript. Genetic data suggest that the MER1 gene may also be responsible for splicing the transcript of at least one other gene."
https://openalex.org/W1481018570,"The subcellular localization of SecA, a protein essential for the catalysis of general protein export, was studied to better understand its state(s) and function(s) within Escherichia coli cells. In a wild-type strain approximately half of the cellular SecA content was found to be associated with the inner membrane, while the remainder was soluble. Association of SecA protein with the inner membrane required the presence of anionic phospholipids and was modulated by ATP. A fraction of the membrane-bound SecA was found to be integrally associated with the membrane. In the secA51(Ts) mutant 75-95% of SecA protein was found to be membrane associated, independent of the protein export status of the cell, implying that the partitioning of this protein between the cell membrane and cytoplasm may play an important role in its function. secA-lacZ fusions were used to map a membrane association determinant to the amino-terminal quarter of SecA protein sequence. When this portion of SecA protein was expressed within cells, it was found solely in membrane fractions and complemented the growth and protein secretion defect of the secA51(Ts) mutant. This indicates that the membrane is the site of the limiting defect in this mutant and suggests that either SecA functions can be divided into at least two separable activities or that productive interaction between SecA and the amino-terminal fragment can occur in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2080846435,"Transient activation of the interleukin-2 (IL-2) gene after antigen recognition by T lymphocytes is crucial for subsequent T cell proliferation and differentiation. Several IL-2 gene regulatory elements and binding factors necessary for activation of the IL-2 gene have been defined. However, little is known about negative regulation of IL-2 expression, which is likely to be important in the rapid shut-off of IL-2 transcription. A nucleotide sequence element (NRE-A) that negatively regulates IL-2 expression has been identified within the IL-2 gene. T cell nuclear extracts contained an NRE-A binding activity. A complementary DNA was isolated that encodes a zinc finger-containing protein that suppressed IL-2 gene expression. The observation of negative regulation of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene enhancer by an element similar to NRE-A suggests that related proteins may regulate multiple immune response genes."
https://openalex.org/W1550755354,"The gene encoding D-lactate dehydrogenase (D-lactate: NAD+ oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.28) of Lactobacillus plantarum has been sequenced, and expressed in Escherichia coli cells with an inducible expression plasmid, in which the 5'-noncoding region of the gene was replaced with the tac promoter. Comparison of the sequence of D-lactate dehydrogenase with L-lactate dehydrogenases, including the L. plantarum L-lactate dehydrogenase, showed no significant homology. In contrast, the D-lactate dehydrogenase is homologous to E. coli D-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase and Lactobacillus casei D-2-hydroxyisocaproate dehydrogenase. This indicates that D-lactate dehydrogenase is a member of a new family of 2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenases recently proposed, being distinct from L-lactate dehydrogenase and L-malate dehydrogenase, and strongly suggests that the new family consists of D-isomer-stereospecific enzymes. In the reductive reaction, the enzyme showed a broad substrate specificity, although pyruvate was the most favorable of all 2-ketocarboxylic acids tested. In particular, hydroxypyruvate is effectively reduced by the enzyme, the reaction rate, and Km value being comparable to those in the case of pyruvate, indicating that the enzyme has not only D-lactate dehydrogenase activity but also D-glycerate dehydrogenase activity. The conserved residues in this family appear to be the residues involved in the substrate binding and the catalytic reaction, and thus to be targets for site-directed mutagenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1547548853,"Imidazoline-guanidinium-receptive site (IGRS) is a membrane protein that, even if recognized by a series of imidazoline and guanidinium alpha 2-adrenergic compounds, is insensitive to catecholamine and physically distinct from alpha 2 receptors (Parini, A., Coupry, I., Graham, R. M., Uzielli, I., Atlas, D., and Lanier, S. M. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 11874-11878). In the present report, we defined the subcellular localization of IGRS by performing binding studies with the imidazoline radioligand [3H]idazoxan. Binding studies on subcellular fractions of homogenates from human and rabbit liver showed a significant increase in [3H]idazoxan binding in a membrane fraction enriched in cytochrome oxidase activity, a specific marker for mitochondria. The enrichment in [3H]idazoxan binding sites correlates closely with cytochrome oxidase activity in the nuclear, mitochondrial, plasma membrane, microsomal, and soluble fractions (r = 0.966, p less than 0.002) but not with the specific markers for other cell compartments, suggesting a major localization of IGRS in mitochondria. Separation of inner and outer mitochondrial membranes by digitonin treatment showed that [3H]idazoxan binding correlates positively with monoamine oxidase (r = 0.960) and negatively with cytochrome oxidase (r = -0.950) activities. In addition, in highly purified preparations of outer mitochondrial membranes obtained by hypotonic shock, [3H]idazoxan binding activity was 12.5-fold enriched with respect to intact mitochondria. Taken together, these data show, for the first time, that IGRS in human and rabbit liver are mainly associated with the outer mitochondrial membranes. This demonstration of the major mitochondrial localization of IGRS will facilitate the characterization of its functional activity in liver."

https://openalex.org/W1480251791,"Translocation of preproteins across the Escherichia coli inner membrane requires acidic phospholipids. We have studied the translocation of the precursor protein proOmpA across inverted inner membrane vesicles prepared from cells depleted of phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin. These membranes support neither translocation nor the translocation ATPase activity of the SecA subunit of preprotein translocase. We now report that inner membrane vesicles which are depleted of acidic phospholipids are unable to bind SecA protein with high affinity. These membranes can be restored to translocation competence by fusion with liposomes containing phosphatidylglycerol, suggesting that the defect in SecA binding is a direct effect of phospholipid depletion rather than a general derangement of inner membrane structure. Reconstitution of SecY/E, the membrane-embedded domain of translocase, into proteoliposomes containing predominantly a single synthetic acidic lipid, dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol, allows efficient catalysis of preprotein translocation."
https://openalex.org/W2010975156,"Telomeres of Oxytricha nova macronuclear chromosomes consist of a repeated T4G4 sequence, single-stranded at the 3′ terminus, bound by a heterodimeric protein. The cloning of genes for the two polypeptides and their separate expression in E. coli have enabled evaluation of their individual contributions to DNA binding. The 56 kd α subunit binds single-stranded DNA by itself, one polypeptide per T4G4 block; multiple subunits can coat a (T4G4)n multimer. The derived amino acid sequence of α does not reveal any known DNA-binding motif, so it appears to represent a novel type of DNA-binding protein. The previously cloned 41 kd β subunit does not by itself protect DNA from methylation, but is required along with α to recreate the pattern of methylation protection indicative of telomeres in vivo. The unusual ability of the protein to engage in two different interactions with the same telomeric DNA sequence might provide the versatility necessary for diverse telomere functions."

https://openalex.org/W1553073688,"We studied the factors that determine the intraphagosomal pH (pHp) in elicited murine peritoneal macrophages. pHp was measured in situ by recording the fluorescence of covalently fluoresceinated Staphylococcus aureus ingested by the macrophages. Following spontaneous acidification of the phagosomes, passive (leak) H+ permeability was determined measuring the rate of change of pHp upon complete inhibition of the H+ pump with bafilomycin A1. A significant, but comparatively low passive H+ permeability was detected. The existence of a passive H+ leak implies that continuous energy expenditure is required for the maintenance of an acidic pHp. In combination with ionophores, bafilomycin was also used to estimate the counterion permeability. The counterion conductance was found to be severalfold higher than the H+ leak. Ion substitution experiments in electropermeabilized cells and the inhibitory effects of quinine and 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid suggest that both monovalent anions and cations permeate the phagosomal membrane. The activity of the H+ pump was measured at various pHp levels. In the steady state, the rate of H+ pumping was considerably lower than counterion permeation. These findings suggest that the phagosomal membrane potential is insignificant. Consistent with this notion, increasing phagosomal conductance with ionophores failed to accelerate the rate of H+ pumping. Thus, the transmembrane delta pH is the predominant component of the proton-motive force across the phagosomal membrane in the steady state. The rate of H+ pumping was found to decrease steeply as the phagosomal lumen became acidified. Therefore, the pH sensitivity of the H+ pump, which possibly reflects a kinetic or allosteric effect, is the primary determinant of pHp."
https://openalex.org/W1994738496,Transcription factor E3 (mTFE3) is a murine transcription activator that binds to the intronic enhancer of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene. A naturally occurring splice product of mTFE3 messenger RNA (mRNA) lacked 105 nucleotides that encode an activation domain; both absolute and relative amounts of long and truncated mRNAs varied in different tissues. Cells were cotransfected with complementary DNAs that encoded the two mRNA forms in amounts that corresponded to the amounts of each mRNA found in different cells. Small changes in substoichiometric amounts of the truncated form of mRNA effected trans-dominant negative modulation of mTFE3 activity. These findings identify a function for differential splicing in the regulation of transcription factor activity.

https://openalex.org/W1537958640,"The platelet-derived growth factor beta-receptor (PDGFr) is a 180-kDa transmembrane glycoprotein which binds BB-PDGF with high affinity. We have expressed the extracellular region of the receptor in Chinese hamster ovary cells using an expression vector that carries a dihydrofolate reductase gene as an amplifiable marker. Upon amplification of the receptor cDNA sequences by methotrexate a 110-kDa soluble form of the receptor extracellular region (XR) was secreted at 12 mg/liter. The soluble XR protein fully retained the high affinity specific binding of the intact PDGFr for BB-PDGF (apparent dissociation constant, 0.4 nM). In the presence of ligand the soluble XR protein formed complexes that migrated on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels at the size expected for dimers of the protein. When added to fibroblast cultures the soluble XR protein blocked the ability of BB-PDGF to stimulate DNA synthesis but did not alter the mitogenic effect of AA-PDGF. The XR fragment also inhibited the binding of BB-PDGF to PDGFr and the activation of PDGFr tyrosine kinase by BB-PDGF. Thus, the soluble extracellular region protein of the PDGFr binds BB-PDGF with high affinity and functions as a specific antagonist of BB-PDGF actions."
https://openalex.org/W1556478672,"Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChR) are G protein-coupled receptors which are highly conserved across mammalian species. Chick cardiac mAChR, however, have been shown to be pharmacologically, immunologically, and biochemically distinct from m2 mAChR expressed in mammalian heart. We previously reported the isolation and characterization of a novel chicken mAChR, cm4, which is expressed in chick heart and brain. We report here the isolation of an additional chicken mAChR gene whose deduced amino acid sequence is most homologous to the mammalian m2 receptor. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that this chicken m2 gene is also expressed in chick heart and brain. When stably transfected into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and Y1 adrenal carcinoma cells, the chicken m2 gene expresses a receptor protein which exhibits high affinity binding for the muscarinic antagonist quinuclidinyl benzilate and atropine, as well as the M1-selective antagonist pirenzepine and the M2-selective antagonist AF-DX 116. Therefore, when expressed in two heterologous cell lines, the chick m2 receptor has pharmacological properties that are similar to the chick m4 receptor as well as those reported for endogenous mAChR in chick cardiac cells. Consistent with the properties of the chick m4, as well as mammalian m2 and m4 receptors, the chick m2 receptor was able to functionally couple to both the inhibition of adenylate cyclase and the stimulation of phosphoinositide metabolism when expressed in CHO cells, but only the inhibition of adenylate cyclase when expressed in Y1 cells. We conclude from this study that the embryonic chick heart expresses multiple subtypes of mAChR which are highly conserved with their mammalian counterparts. Furthermore, the high degree of conservation between the mammalian m2 and the chick m2 muscarinic receptors suggests that the pharmacological differences that exist between these receptors are due to a relatively small number of specific amino acid changes rather than larger changes in receptor sequence or structure."

Histamine (i) stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis (EC50 = 8.6 +/- 4.1 microM), (ii) activated protein kinase C (2.4-fold increase in activity), and (iii) increased phosphate uptake (EC50 = 3.2 +/- 1.8 microM) by increasing maximal transport (Vmax(basal) = 6.2 +/- 0.3 versus Vmax(histamine) = 9.1 +/- 0.4) without changing the affinity of the transport process for phosphate. Prolonged treatment with 16 microM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate completely blocked protein kinase C activation and markedly attenuated the stimulation of phosphate uptake induced by histamine, establishing that 5-HT and histamine stimulate phosphate uptake through the common pathway of protein kinase C activation. The linkages of the histamine H1 and 5-HT1A receptors to G protein pools were assessed in two ways. (i) The stimulation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis, protein kinase C activity, and phosphate uptake associated with histamine were insensitive to pertussis toxin, whereas those associated with 5-HT were very sensitive to pertussis toxin. (ii) The stimulation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis, protein kinase C activity, and phosphate uptake induced by histamine and 5-HT were additive. These findings suggest that distinct receptor types can stimulate phosphoinositide hydrolysis, protein kinase C, and phosphate uptake in an additive fashion through distinct pools of G proteins in a single cell type."
https://openalex.org/W1506261885,"A number of isoprenoids (e.g. pristanic acid and the side chains of fat soluble-vitamins) is degraded or shortened via beta oxidation. We synthesized 2-methyl-palmitate and 2-methyl[1-14C] palmitate as a model substrate for the study of the beta oxidation of branched (isoprenoid) fatty acids in rat liver. 2-Methylpalmitate was well oxidized by isolated hepatocytes and its oxidation was stimulated after treatment of the animals with a peroxisome proliferator. Subcellular fractionation of rat liver demonstrated that 2-methylpalmitate is activated to its CoA ester in endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and peroxisomes and that mitochondria and peroxisomes are capable of beta-oxidizing 2-methylpalmitate. At low unbound 2-methylpalmitate concentrations and in the presence of competing straight chain fatty acids, a condition encountered in vivo, peroxisomal 2-methyl-palmitate oxidation was 2- to 4-fold more active than mitochondrial oxidation. Treatment of rats with a peroxisome proliferator markedly stimulated mitochondrial but only slightly peroxisomal 2-methylpalmitate oxidation. The same treatment dramatically induced palmitoyl-CoA oxidase but did not change 2-methyl-palmitoyl-CoA oxidase activity. Our results indicate 1) that in untreated rats peroxisomes contribute for an important part to the oxidation of 2-methylpalmitate; 2) that treatment with a peroxisome proliferator stimulates mainly the mitochondrial component of 2-methylpalmitate oxidation; and 3) that palmitoyl-CoA and 2-methylpalmitoyl-CoA are oxidized by different peroxisomal oxidases."
https://openalex.org/W1538027735,"A genetic approach was used to identify interacting portions of the plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The cellular sensitivity of the pma1-105 strain (S368F) to low external pH and to NH4+ was used to select intragenic revertants of two classes: phenotypically wild-type full revertants and partial revertants that were low pH-resistant but retained resistance to hygromycin B. All 10 full revertants had S368 restored. Among five partial revertants mapping to the original site within the phosphorylation domain, S368L and S368V were each found twice. One revertant contained an E367V substitution adjacent to the original S368F alteration. Four of 13 independently isolated second-site revertants mapped to one site, V289F, in the proposed phosphatase domain. Mutations within the proposed phosphatase and phosphorylation domains resulted in enzymes with increased vanadate sensitivity relative to the vanadate-insensitive S368F enzyme. These results suggest that sites S368, E367, and V289 contribute to a vanadate (Pi) binding domain or are able to interact with such a site within the catalytic domain. The remaining nine partial second-site revertants mapped to six sites within the putative transmembrane regions. Mutations within the transmembrane region had less of an effect on vanadate sensitivity. Most revertant enzymes showed small but significant increases in the rate of ATP hydrolysis relative to the S368F enzyme. Several enzymes no longer displayed the acid-sensitive pH-dependence seen in the S368F enzyme. These data provide novel evidence for an interaction between putative transmembrane helices 1-3 and 7 and the ATP hydrolytic portion of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1535195487,"The present report shows that thyrotropin (TSH) regulates all three steps involved in prostaglandin synthesis in FRTL-5 rat thyroid cells, i.e. arachidonic acid release from membrane phospholipids, cyclooxygenase (prostaglandin H synthase) action, and individual prostaglandin formation; however, its action at specific steps may require the presence of, or can be duplicated by, insulin, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), and/or a serum factor. Thus, TSH releases free arachidonic acid from rat FRTL-5 thyroid cells whose phospholipid fraction is radiolabeled with [3H]arachidonic acid; this action involves a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein, is not cAMP mediated, and does not require insulin or 5% serum. To quantitate TSH effects on cyclooxygenase activity and on individual prostaglandin formation, a homogenate system and a rapid reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography procedure have been developed to measure cyclooxygenase metabolites. TSH increased cyclooxygenase activity in homogenates only if the cells were also exposed to insulin, IGF-I, and/or 5% calf serum; TSH alone had no apparent effect on the activity. Maximal activation, 4-fold over basal/micrograms of DNA, took 36 h to achieve and reflected, at least in part, an increase in cyclooxygenase gene expression. Like cyclooxygenase activity, induction of prostaglandin E2 production required 2 or more factors, i.e. TSH plus insulin/IGF-I or TSH plus insulin/IGF-I plus serum. Increased production of prostaglandin D2, could, however, be detected if cells were treated with TSH alone and the TSH activity could be duplicated by insulin, IGF-I, or calf serum alone."
https://openalex.org/W1645132064,"Mutations of the insulin receptor gene have been shown to cause insulin-resistant diabetes in patients with genetic forms of insulin resistance. We have previously reported that a mutation substituting valine for Phe382 in the alpha-subunit of the insulin receptor is associated with impaired transport of the mutant receptor to the plasma membrane (Accili, D., Frapier, C., Mosthaf, L., McKeon, C., Elbein, S. C., Permutt, M. A., Ramos, E., Lander, E. S., Ullrich, A., and Taylor, S. I. (1989) EMBO J. 8, 2509-2517). In this study, we demonstrate that the Val382 mutation impairs the ability of insulin to activate receptor autophosphorylation. Furthermore, the Val382 receptor has reduced activity to phosphorylate other peptide substrates in the presence of insulin. Nevertheless, when the Val382 mutant and wild-type receptors are mixed together, the wild-type human insulin receptor is able to phosphorylate the Val382 mutant receptor, thereby activating the tyrosine kinase activity of the mutant receptor. Thus, the conformational change caused by the Val382 mutation compromises the ability of the receptor to transmit a signal across the plasma membrane. Furthermore, our observations suggest that receptor phosphorylation by an intermolecular mechanism (i.e. transphosphorylation) may play a role in mediating the action of insulin upon the target cell."
https://openalex.org/W1561921832,"Abstract Proteinase inhibitors of the alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M) type, although well characterized in vitro, still evade a precise description of their actual role in vivo. The main reason for this is the absence of any clinical evidence for the malfunctioning of alpha 2M in humans. Moreover, despite their ubiquitous presence in animals of very different taxa, animal models are notoriously absent in this field. With the advent of transgenic animals an important tool became available in this respect. As a first step in this direction we are analyzing at the molecular level all the members of this proteinase inhibitor family in the mouse. To retrieve related sequences we screened a mouse liver cDNA library with human alpha 2M cDNA. The sequences from two isolated clones partially coded for a protein with a high degree of sequence identity with human alpha 2M, rat alpha 2M, and rat alpha 1I3. Protein sequence data from the large and small subunits of mouse alpha 2M and of the protein isolated from mouse plasma allowed us to designate the clones as coding for murinoglobulin (MUG), an alpha 2M-related single-chain proteinase inhibitor. Rescreening resulted in the isolation of 24 clones, of which 21 were related or identical to the original MUG clones. Restriction analysis led to three groups of clones of which representative members were sequenced. Two highly homologous cDNA sequences were derived, coding for proteins that displayed the typical features of alpha 2M-type proteinase inhibitors: the overall size, the positions of a putative bait region and of the internal thiol ester, and the positional conservation of cysteine residues and putative asparagine-glycosylation sites. A third related member for which only one incomplete cDNA clone was obtained and sequenced, proved to be aberrant: the bait region contained what appeared to be an intron which escaped proper splicing. A second apparent intron was present at the 5' end of the cDNA while a frameshift mutation near the 3' end (insertion of a G) caused premature termination of the reading frame when compared to the other MUG sequences. These features were confirmed from an isolated genomic clone and extended at the genomic level: the corresponding gene, a transcriptionally weakly active pseudogene, contained the small intron but as part of a larger intron. The presence of suitable intron/exon splice sites show that a relatively small part of the intron is being introduced as an exon in the mRNA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

https://openalex.org/W1653164798,"The hepatitis B virus S (major surface gene) promoter is embedded in two overlapping open reading frames and specifies several transcripts with heterogeneous 5' termini. We have identified the cis-elements necessary for S promoter function. A single upstream CCAAT element is essential for high level expression in both liver and non-liver cells. No TATA box is present, but two regions surrounding the initiation sites can function separately as initiating elements. These results show that the S promoter has a simple requirement for upstream activating sequences, but a complex initiation region. Therefore, it may provide a suitable model system for studying transcription initiation in non-TATA type promoters."
https://openalex.org/W1540226223,"Abstract 9-(2-Phosphonylmethoxyethyl)adenine (PMEA) is a new antiviral compound with activity against herpes simplex virus (HSV) and retroviruses including human immunodeficiency virus. Although it has been suggested that the anti-HSV action of PMEA is through inhibition of the viral DNA polymerase via the diphosphorylated metabolite of PMEA (PMEApp), no conclusive evidence for this has been presented. We report that in cross-resistance studies, a PMEA-resistant HSV variant (PMEAr-1) was resistant to phosphonoformic acid, a compound which directly inhibits the HSV DNA polymerase. In addition, phosphonoformic acid-resistant HSV variants with defined drug resistance mutations within the HSV DNA polymerase gene were resistant to PMEA. Furthermore, the HSV DNA polymerase purified from PMEAr-1 was resistant to PMEApp in comparison with the enzyme from the parental virus. Moreover, PMEA inhibited HSV DNA synthesis in cell culture. These results provide strong evidence that HSV DNA polymerase is the major target for the anti-viral action of PMEA. Further studies showed that HSV DNA polymerase incorporated PMEApp into DNA in vitro, while the HSV polymerase-associated 3'-5' exonuclease was able to remove the incorporated PMEA. Thus, the inhibition of HSV DNA polymerase by PMEApp appears to involve chain termination after its incorporation into DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1485733560,"We studied a French kindred with hereditary elliptocytosis associated with a spectrin variant (spectrin LePuy) containing a beta-spectrin chain that is truncated at its C terminus (Dhermy, D., Lecomte, M., Garbarz, M., Bournier, O., Galand, C., Gautero, H., Feo, C., Alloisio, N., Delaunay, J., and Boivin, P. (1982) J. Clin. Invest. 70, 707-715). The structure of the 3‘ end of the beta-spectrin gene, the region encoding the C terminus of beta-spectrin, was determined. Nucleotide sequencing of amplified genomic DNA revealed a mutation at position +4 (A—-G) of the 5‘ donor consensus splice site of the intron following the third-to-last exon (exon X) in one beta-spectrin allele of a heterozygous patient. Agarose gel electrophoresis of polymerase chain reaction-amplified cDNA revealed an extra band of lower molecular weight, suggesting that the shortened beta-spectrin chain of spectrin LePuy arises from aberrant mRNA splicing. Nucleotide sequencing of the shorter cDNA amplification product revealed that the sequences encoding exon X were absent. Southern blotting of cDNA amplification products confirmed this result. The skipping of exon X causes a shift in the normal reading frame resulting in the encoding of a new amino acid sequence at the C terminus of the mutant beta-spectrin chain. A new in-frame stop codon is encountered following a single residue of this novel sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1531879599,"Abstract In the eubacterium Escherichia coli the genes for the ribosomal proteins L13 and S9 form an operon consisting of two genes. The corresponding operon of the archaebacterium Haloarcula marismortui (Halobacterium marismortui was recently reassigned to the genus Haloarcula [Oren, A., Ginzburg, M., Ginzburg, B. Z., Hochstein, L. I., and Volcani, B. E. (1990) Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 40, 209-210] and is now called Haloarcula marismortui) which is presented here, is much larger encoding three ribosomal proteins (HL29, HmaL13, HmaS9), a tRNA(Leu), the glycolytic enzyme enolase (HmaEno), a putative membrane protein (OrfMSG), and two not yet identified open reading frames (OrfMMV, OrfMNA). The nucleotide sequence of 3931 base pairs has been established. Northern analysis revealed the existence of a polycistronic mRNA (3.7 kilobases) demonstrating that the transcription of a gene of the glycolytic pathway is coupled to the transcription of ribosomal protein genes. Upstream of the first gene of the operon (tRNA(Leu)) a promoter structure typical for the extreme halophilic archaebacteria was detected and downstream of the last gene (OrfMSG) a terminator structure was present. As shown by S1-nuclease mapping, a tRNA-mRNA transcript as well as the mRNA alone was present in vivo. The transcriptional start point and the tRNA-mRNA cleavage point are shown to be almost identical to the 5' and 3' ends, respectively, of the putative mature tRNA. The C-terminal part of the OrfMSG protein shows a significant similarity to the vertebrate laminin receptor protein."
https://openalex.org/W1580636945,"We have isolated non-globin cDNA clones specific for erythroid differentiation from K562 human erythroleukemia cells and have identified those that may regulate globin gene transcription. A cDNA library was constructed from K562 cells induced by hemin for production of embryonic and fetal hemoglobins and screened against cDNA from uninduced K562 cells. Full-length clones specific for induced K562 cells were ligated into a eukaryotic expression vector and transfected into HeLa cells to allow for production of the corresponding coded polypeptide. The ability to increase epsilon- or gamma-globin promoter activity was identified using cotransfection with a second vector containing a globin gene promoter fused to a reporter gene. Six of the induced K562-specific clones exhibited the ability to increase the levels of the reporter genes, bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase and human growth hormone. Sequencing analyses of these clones indicated that five were homologous to ferritin heavy and light chains and one had no homology with known DNA or protein sequences. The ferritin light chain cDNA had the greatest effect on globin gene promoter activation, increasing the gamma-globin promoter activity by 6-8-fold. The activation of the globin gene promoter in the absence of globin gene translation suggests that ferritin (or iron) may have a direct role in globin gene transcription. The subtractive library cloning strategy has enabled us to isolate cDNA clones that activate specific gene promoter without the requirement of direct DNA binding. This approach may allow further identification of the genes encoding proteins that are involved in the control of erythropoiesis."
https://openalex.org/W1532914822,"We have transfected mouse L cells with a recombinant membrane-anchored insulin receptor kinase (called MARK), under the transcriptional control of a glucocorticoid-responsive element. The transfected construct includes only 15 extracellular residues, with the transmembrane and intracellular kinase domains of the human insulin receptor cDNA (amino acid residues -27 to 12 and 915 to 1343 (see Ullrich, A., Bell, J.

Transfected cells which are exposed to dexamethasone express two proteins of approximate Mr = 54,000 which (a) react with anti-peptide antisera raised to human insulin receptor sequences, (b) localize to the membrane fraction, and (c) possess ligand (insulin)-independent tyrosine kinase activity. In extracts of steroid-treated MARK cells, a phosphotyrosine-containing protein of Mr = 185,000 is detected, which corresponds in size to a known endogenous substrate for the insulin receptor. Control studies were performed with the nontransfected parent line, and with L cells transfected with an inactive human insulin receptor protein tyrosine kinase. Dexamethasone induced no change in the proteins detected by an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody in the two control lines. In studies of deoxyglucose uptake, dexamethasone stimulated increase in deoxyglucose uptake 2-fold in the MARK cells compared to the same cells studied in the absence of dexamethasone. Dexamethasone had no effect in the control cell lines. These studies demonstrate that a membrane-anchored insulin receptor kinase, devoid of virtually the entire extracellular domain of the insulin receptor, is sufficient to induce enhanced deoxyglucose uptake."
