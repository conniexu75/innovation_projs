https://openalex.org/W2110247921,"A neuroimaging study examined the neural correlates of social exclusion and tested the hypothesis that the brain bases of social pain are similar to those of physical pain. Participants were scanned while playing a virtual ball-tossing game in which they were ultimately excluded. Paralleling results from physical pain studies, the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) was more active during exclusion than during inclusion and correlated positively with self-reported distress. Right ventral prefrontal cortex (RVPFC) was active during exclusion and correlated negatively with self-reported distress. ACC changes mediated the RVPFC-distress correlation, suggesting that RVPFC regulates the distress of social exclusion by disrupting ACC activity."

The recent drying trend in the semiarid Sahel is attributed to warmer-than-average low-latitude waters around Africa, which, by favoring the establishment of deep convection over the ocean, weaken the continental convergence associated with the monsoon and engender widespread drought from Senegal to Ethiopia."
https://openalex.org/W2031573489,"Electron transfer is used as a probe for angstrom-scale structural changes in single protein molecules. In a flavin reductase, the fluorescence of flavin is quenched by a nearby tyrosine residue by means of photo-induced electron transfer. By probing the fluorescence lifetime of the single flavin on a photon-by-photon basis, we were able to observe the variation of flavin-tyrosine distance over time. We could then determine the potential of mean force between the flavin and the tyrosine, and a correlation analysis revealed conformational fluctuation at multiple time scales spanning from hundreds of microseconds to seconds. This phenomenon suggests the existence of multiple interconverting conformers related to the fluctuating catalytic reactivity."

This result, discovered using a highly replicated experimental design involving 72 microarrays, demonstrates more extensive genomic plasticity in the adult brain than has yet been shown. Experimental manipulations that uncouple behavior and age revealed that messenger RNA changes were primarily associated with behavior. Individual brain messenger RNA profiles correctly predicted the behavior of 57 out of 60 bees, indicating a robust association between brain gene expression in the individual and naturally occurring behavioral plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2000999944,"Recent observations indicate that climate change over the high latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere is dominated by a strengthening of the circumpolar westerly flow that extends from the surface to the stratosphere. Here we demonstrate that the seasonality, structure, and amplitude of the observed climate trends are simulated in a state-of-the-art atmospheric model run with high vertical resolution that is forced solely by prescribed stratospheric ozone depletion. The results provide evidence that anthropogenic emissions of ozonedepleting gases have had a distinct impact on climate not only at stratospheric levels but at Earth's surface as well."
https://openalex.org/W4256258598,"A genetic screen was designed in Drosophila to interrogate its genome for mutations sufficient to cause noninvasive tumors of the eye disc to invade neighboring or distant tissues. We found that cooperation between oncogenic RasV12 expression and inactivation of any one of a number of genes affecting cell polarity leads to metastatic behavior, including basement membrane degradation, loss of E-cadherin expression, migration, invasion, and secondary tumor formation. Inactivation of these cell polarity genes cannot drive metastatic behavior alone or in combination with other tumor-initiating alterations. These findings suggest that the oncogenic background of tissues makes a distinct contribution toward metastatic development."

https://openalex.org/W1985405662,"The stone-like otoliths from the ears of teleost fishes are involved in balance and hearing and consist of calcium carbonate crystallites embedded in a protein framework. We report that a previously unknown gene, starmaker, is required in zebrafish for otolith morphogenesis. Reduction of starmaker activity by injection of modified antisense oligonucleotides causes a change in the crystal lattice structure and thus a change in otolith morphology. The expression pattern of starmaker, along with the presence of the protein on the growing otolith, suggest that the expression levels of starmaker control the shape of the otoliths."
https://openalex.org/W1978641537,"FLICE-inhibitory protein (FLIP) is a homolog of caspase-8 that lacks catalytic activity and has been shown to be important in protecting endothelial cells from apoptosis. The serine/threonine kinase Akt/PKB was recently reported to promote FLIP expression in endothelial and tumor cells. Here we examined the role of the forkhead transcription factor FOXO3a, a downstream target of Akt, in controlling FLIP regulation in endothelial cells. FOXO3a nuclear translocation was regulated by Akt in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Transduction of a nonphosphorylatable, constitutively active mutant of FOXO3a (TM-FOXO3a) led to the down-regulation of FLIP levels. Transduction with TM-FOXO3a also increased caspase-8 activity and promoted apoptosis in endothelial cells. Conversely, transduction of a dominant-negative mutant of FOXO3a up-regulated FLIP levels and protected endothelial cells from apoptosis under serum deprivation conditions. Restoration of intracellular FLIP blocked caspase-8 activation and inhibited apoptosis in TM-FOXO3a-transduced cells. These data suggest that FOXO3a is a downstream target of Akt in endothelial cells that can promote apoptosis via FLIP down-regulation and activation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.

Apoptotic cell death of vascular cells is a prominent feature of blood vessel remodeling in normal development and fibroproliferative disorders (1.Walsh K. Smith R.C. Kim H.S. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar).

Golstein P. Science. 1995; 267: 1449-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (3980) Google Scholar). The Fas receptor is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family that is ubiquitously expressed by most cell types. In contrast, FasL is much more tissue-restricted in its expression, and it is found on the cell surface of inflammatory and vascular cells (2.Nagata S. Golstein P. Science. 1995; 267: 1449-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (3980) Google Scholar, 3.Sata M. Suhara T. Walsh K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Binding of the trimeric Fas ligand induces Fas receptor clustering leading to the oligomerization of caspase-8. Caspase-8 oligomerization promotes proteolytic self-activation and triggers the activation of additional caspase family members. The susceptibility of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) to Fas-mediated cell death in vitro and in vivo has been documented (3.Sata M. Suhara T. Walsh K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 6.Sata M. Perlman H. Muruve D.A. Silver M. Ikebe M. Libermann T.A. Oettgen P. Walsh K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1213-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In contrast to VSMC, vascular endothelial cells are normally resistant to Fas-mediated apoptosis and remain resistant even when Fas expression is up-regulated by exposure to interferon (3.Sata M. Suhara T. Walsh K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 5.Sata M. Walsh K. Nat.

Immunol. 1994; 24: 2640-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The marked differences in the sensitivity of vascular cells to Fas-induced apoptosis is mediated, at least in part, by the expression of cellular FLIP (FLICE-like inhibitory protein) that functions as a dominant-negative inhibitor of caspase-8 function (8.Irmler M. Thome M. Hahne M. Schneider P. Hofmann K. Steiner V. Bodmer J.-L. Schroter M. Burns K. Mattmann C. Rimoldi D. French L. Tschopp J. Nature. 1997; 388: 190-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (2231) Google Scholar). FLIP isoforms are abundantly expressed in endothelial cells where they may function to regulate Fas-mediated cell suicide (or fratricide). For example, oxidized LDL can sensitize endothelial cells to Fas-mediated apoptosis by down-regulating FLIP expression (9.Sata M. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33103-33106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 10.Sata M. Walsh K. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 102: 1682-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 11.Suhara T. Mano T. Oliveira B.E. Walsh K. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). It is also reported that FLIP expression is down-regulated following balloon injury in rat carotid VSMC (12.Imanishi T. McBride J. Ho Q. O'Brien K.D. Schwartz S.M. Han D.K.M. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 125-137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Plaque-derived VSMC express relatively low levels of FLIP, suggesting that FLIP may also participate in the regulation of VSMC turnover in these lesions (12.Imanishi T. McBride J. Ho Q. O'Brien K.D. Schwartz S.M. Han D.K.M. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 125-137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling axis functions downstream of growth factor and matrix attachment signals to promote endothelial cell viability and other pro-angiogenic cellular responses (13.Fujio Y. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16349-16354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 14.Shiojima I. Walsh K. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 1243-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling is an important determinant of endothelial sensitivity to Fas-mediated death signals through its ability to modulate the expression of FLIP (11.Suhara T. Mano T. Oliveira B.E. Walsh K. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). FLIP is down-regulated under conditions that lead to diminished PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling, whereas activation of PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling promotes FLIP expression in endothelial cells. It has also been shown that Akt signaling promotes FLIP expression in tumor cells (15.Panka D.J. Mano T. Suhara T. Walsh K. Mier J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6893-6896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Presumably, FLIP expression in tumors is required for protection from apoptosis, since they constitutively express FasL to evade attack from immune cells (16.Hahne M. Rimoldi D. Schröter M. Romero P. Schreier M. French L.E. Schneider P. Bornand T. Fontana A. Lienard D. Cerottini J.-C. Tschopp J. Science. 1996; 274: 1363-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar). Despite the potential importance of FLIP regulation by Akt signaling in angiogenesis and tumorigenesis, nothing is known about the downstream effectors of Akt signaling that control FLIP expression. FOXO3a, also referred to as FKHRL-1, is a recently discovered member of the family of forkhead transcription factors that are phosphorylated by Akt (17.Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5454) Google Scholar, 18.Anderson M.J. Viars C.S. Czekay S. Cavenee W.K. Arden K.C. Genomics. 1998; 47: 187-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation leads to cytoplasmic retention and impairment of FOXO3a nuclear transcriptional activity. FOXO3a has been shown to induce apoptosis in neuronal cell lines and fibroblasts by up-regulation of Fas ligand expression and activation of the death receptor pathway (17.Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5454) Google Scholar). However, Dijkers et al. (19.Dijkers P.F. Medemadagger R.H. Lammers J.J. Koenderman L. Coffer P.J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1201-1204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar) recently showed that the “intrinsic” mitochondrial pathway, rather than the “extrinsic” Fas-mediated pathway, can promote apoptotic cell death in hematopoietic cells following activation of FOXO3a signaling. The role of forkhead transcription factors in endothelial cell biology has not been described previously. Thus, an understanding of how this pathway regulates endothelial cell viability may provide novel insights into the maintenance of endothelial cell integrity during vascular disease. In this study, we investigated the role of FOXO3a in Akt/PKB-mediated FLIP regulation and apoptosis in endothelial cells. Cell Culture and Reagents—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC, Cambrex) passage 3-6 were used in this study and were cultured in endothelial growth medium (EGM, Cambrex) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin for experiments using serum stimulation or EBM + 1% penicillin/streptomycin with 0% FBS for serum starvation. Typically, HUVEC were grown to subconfluence in 1.5% gelatin-coated 10-cm dishes, 6-well plates, or slide chambers. Infection with the adenoviral vectors was carried out overnight. For Western blot analysis cells were harvested at 16 h post-infection. To examine the role of FOXO3a signaling on apoptosis, cells were infected with the indicated vectors overnight; medium was changed, and HUVEC were harvested 48 h post-infection. For anoikis studies, cell culture plates were coated with 30 mg/ml Poly-HEMA® (poly-2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate, Sigma), dried overnight, and rinsed twice with PBS before use. Cells were grown to subconfluency, detached with 0.05% trypsin, and incubated on Poly-HEMA-coated dishes for the times indicated. Adenoviral Constructs—The hemagglutinin-tagged human FOXO3a triple mutant and wild-type sequence cDNA (from Michael E. Greenberg, Harvard Medical School) was subcloned into a shuttle vector pAdTrack-CMV, which contains green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of a separate cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter (from Bert Vogelstein, The Johns Hopkins Oncology Center) (Fig. 3A). The FOXO3a-AAA triple mutant (TM-FOXO3a) is not phosphorylatable because three phosphorylation sites, Thr-32, Ser-253, and Ser-315, were replaced by alanine residues (17.Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5454) Google Scholar). The dominant-negative form (dn-FOXO3a) was constructed by deletion of the transactivation domain from the C terminus. The shuttle vector containing the FOXO3a cDNA was linearized and co-transformed into Escherichia coli with the adenoviral backbone plasmid pAdEasy-1. The resultant recombinant adenoviral DNA with FOXO3a cDNA was transfected into a packaging cell line (293 cells) to produce the recombinant adenoviral vectors. For experiments with these reagents, control cultures were infected with an adenoviral vector expressing only the GFP transgene (Ad-GFP) prepared by the same system (20.He T.C. Zhou S. Da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar). The Ad-Tet-FLIP, Ad-Tet-LacZ encoding β-galactosidase, and Ad-rtTA vectors have been described previously (4.Suhara T. Kim H.-S. Kirshenbaum L.A. Walsh K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 680-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The adenoviral vector Ad-CMV-rtTA encodes a chimeric transcription factor composed of a mutant tetracycline repressor fused to a VP16 trans-activator under control of the CMV promoter/enhancer. Ad-TET-FLIP encodes for a FLAG-tagged protein of FLIPL downstream of seven consecutive tetracycline-responsive elements. Replication-defective adenovirus vectors expressing dominant-negative and constitutively active forms of murine Akt tagged with the hemagglutinin epitope were constructed as described previously (21.Fujio Y. Guo K. Mano T. Mitsuuchi Y. Testa J.R. Walsh K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5073-5082Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The dominant-negative Akt mutant (Ad-dnAkt) has alanine residues substituted for threonine at position 308 and serine at position 473. The constitutively active Akt (Ad-myrAkt) has the c-Src myristoylation sequence fused in-frame to the N terminus of the wild-type Akt coding sequence that targets the fusion protein to the membrane. Like the Akt vectors, adeno-β-galactosidase expresses the lacZ gene from the CMV promoter (22.Smith R.C. Branellec D. Gorski D.H. Guo K. Perlman H. Dedieu J.-F. Pastore C. Mahfoudi A. Denèfle P. Isner J.M. Walsh K. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1674-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The adenovirus expressing CrmA (Ad-CrmA) was generated by homologous recombination in human embryonic 293 kidney cells from the 1.4-kbp CrmA cDNA. The resulting shuttle plasmid was rescued into recombinant adenovirus as described previously (22.Smith R.C. Branellec D. Gorski D.H. Guo K. Perlman H. Dedieu J.-F. Pastore C. Mahfoudi A. Denèfle P. Isner J.M. Walsh K. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1674-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). All viral constructs were purified by CsCl ultracentrifugation. Titration was performed by means of the plaque assay. Immunofluorescence Staining—HUVEC were cultured in Lab-Tek® cover glass chambers (Nalge Nunc International) using endothelial basal medium (EBM) for serum starvation or EGM + 10% FBS for serum stimulation and transduced with the adenoviral vectors as indicated. Following a 12-16-h incubation period, cells were washed three times with warm PBS and fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. After another washing step with PBS, cells were permeabilized using 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. Blocking was carried out using PBS solution containing 10% fetal calf serum, 0.1 n NaN3, and 0.1% Triton X-100. First antibody incubation was carried out with anti-FKHRL-1 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) for 1 h at room temperature at a dilution of 1:100, followed by second antibody incubation with Alexa®-Fluor antibodies (Eugene, OR) at a dilution of 1:1000 for 30 min. All antibodies were diluted in PBS + 5% FBS. The slides were washed three times in PBS; the cover glasses were removed, and the cells were mounted using Vectashield® mounting medium containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories). Cells were observed under a fluorescence microscope (Nikon Diaphot) with light shielded at a wavelength of 565 nm (red), 400 nm (DAPI) and 505 nm (green), respectively. Transduction efficiency was determined using the expression of GFP. Control experiments were performed in the absence of primary or secondary antibody, respectively. Quantification of the cytoplasmic and nuclear location of FOXO3a was performed by counting four times 100 cells by systematically surveying the slides at a magnification of ×20, and results were expressed as percent positive cells. Western Immunoblot Analysis—Immunoblot analysis was performed by modification of the procedures described previously (23.Kim H.S. Skurk C. Thomas S.R. Bialik A. Suhara T. Kureishi Y. Birnbaum M. Keaney Jr., J.F. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41888-41896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Cells were washed with PBS twice before incubating in lysis buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.05% SDS, and 250 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm vanadate. One tablet of protease inhibitor mixture (Complete Mini, Roche Applied Science) was added just prior to use. After scraping, whole cell lysates were put on ice for 30 min, and the protein concentration was determined by using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). 20-50 μg of protein was fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidine difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore). The membrane was blocked using 0.05% T-PBS (1× PBS and 0.05% Tween 20) containing 3% dry milk for 30 min and incubated with the primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. Following a wash step in 0.3% T-PBS containing 1.5% dry milk, the membrane was blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin. The second antibody was applied for 1 h at room temperature. After washing the membrane in 0.05% T-PBS for 1 h, the immune complexes were detected by chemiluminescent detection reagents ECL or ECL-Plus (Amersham Biosciences). To reprobe the membrane, Restore Western blot Stripping Buffer (Pierce) was used. Primary antibodies used in this study are as follows: anti-FKHRL-1 (rabbit polyclonal IgG, Upstate) 1:1000; anti-phospho-FKHRL-1 (Ser-253) (rabbit polyclonal IgG, Upstate) 1:500; anti-phospho-FKHRL-1 (Thr-32) (rabbit polyclonal IgG, Upstate) 1:500; anti-human-FLIP (NF6, M. Peter, Chicago) 1:20; and anti-HA (Roche Applied Science) 1:4000. As secondary antibodies, anti-mouse IgG HRP (horseradish peroxidase) (Promega) or anti-rabbit IgG HRP (Promega) was used at a dilution of 1:2000. Immunoblots were quantified using NIH-Image® software. RNase Protection Assay—Changes in RNA expression of FLIP were determined using the RiboQuant™ MultiProbe RNase Protection Assay System according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Pharmingen). HUVEC were grown in 10-cm dishes to subconfluency and infected with the viral vectors at m.o.i. 40. After infection for 16 h, RNA was extracted using the Ultraspec™ RNA isolation system (Biotecx). Cells were homogenized with 1 ml of Ultraspec RNA reagent, and RNA was extracted by adding 0.2 ml of chloroform. Following centrifugation at 4 °C and 12,000 × g for 15 min, the aqueous phase was transferred to another tube, and precipitation was carried out with isopropanol (1:1, v/v). After centrifugation for 10 min at 12,000 × g at 4 °C isolated RNA was washed with 75% ethanol. Total RNA was then quantified, and equal amounts were further processed in the protection assay. The probe synthesis was carried out at 37 °C for 1 h by using the RNase protection assay template set (hAPO-3b) and [α-32P]UTP for labeling the product. The reaction was terminated with 2 μl of DNase, and the radioactive RNA probes were isolated. Hybridization was carried out for 12-16 h at 56 °C by mixing 20 μg of target RNA dissolved in 8 μl of hybridization buffer with 2 μl of RNA probes. Following RNA and protein digestion, hybridized target RNA was isolated, run by electrophoresis on a 5% acrylamide gel, and visualized with autoradiography films. Cell Viability Assays—Cell viability was determined by the MTT assay (Roche Applied Science) as suggested by the manufacturer. HUVEC were then seeded in 96-well plates and infected with the indicated adenoviral vectors. At 24 and 48 h post-infection, MTT solution (tetrazolium salt, final concentration 0.5 mg/ml) was added for 4 h at 37 °C. Formazan salt crystals were then solubilized by adding the solubilization solution and incubated overnight in a humidified atmosphere (e.g. 37 °C, 5% CO2). The solubilized formazan product was spectrophotometrically quantified at a wavelength of 550 nm on a microplate reader. In Vitro Caspase-8 Activity Assay—Caspase-8 activity was measured by using the caspase-8 activity calorimetric assay kit (R & D Systems) according to the directions of the manufacturer. HUVEC were grown in 10-cm dishes and at the time of subconfluency infected with the adenoviral vectors overnight. 24 h after infection cells were collected by trypsinization and centrifuged by 200 × g for 10 min. 50 μl of lysis buffer was added to the cell pellet. Protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Roche Applied Science). Whole cell lysates of ∼106 cells were incubated with 5 mmol/liter dithiothreitol and the caspase-8 substrate IETD-p-nitroanilide in reaction buffer for 2 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cleavage of the substrate was determined by an increase in absorbance at 405 nm using a spectrophotometer. At least five independent experiments were performed in each group. Controls consisted of non-induced cells, i.e. adenoviral infection with GFP as well as omitting either substrate or cell lysate. Results were expressed as fold increase in caspase activity compared with the GFP group. FACS Analysis by Flow Cytometry—DNA fragmentation was assessed by measuring the hypodiploid DNA content. After various treatments, attached and floating HUVEC were harvested and fixed in cold 70% ethanol for 20 min and then resuspended in staining buffer consisting of 1 mg of RNase A per ml, 20 μg of propidium iodide per ml, and 0.01% Nonidet P-40. DNA content was analyzed by flow cytometry on the FL-2 channel, and gating was set to exclude debris and cellular aggregates. Ten thousand events were counted for each analysis, and four independent experiments were conducted in each group. Statistical Analysis—All data were compared by Student's t test using Stat View 4.5 (Abacus software). Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. for the number of independent experiments indicated. A p < 0.05 was considered to be significant. FOXO3 Expression and Regulation in HUVEC—FOXO3a expression was detected in HUVEC cultures by immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 1). Under conditions of serum-stimulation, FOXO3a was predominantly detected in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1A). In contrast, serum starvation for 24 h led to a predominantly nuclear staining pattern (Fig. 1B). Quantitative analyses of these cultures revealed that 78.6 ± 2.7% of cells displayed nuclear localization of FOXO3a under serum deprivation conditions, whereas 20.3 ± 3.9% of cells displayed nuclear localization under conditions of serum stimulation (Fig. 1E). These results illustrate that FOXO3a is present in endothelial cells and that this transcription factor is regulated by growth factor signaling. To test whether the regulation of FOXO3a localization by growth factor is mediated by Akt signaling, HUVEC cultures were transduced with adenoviral vectors expressing dominant-negative Akt (Ad-dnAkt) or constitutively active Akt (Ad-myrAkt). Transduction at 40 m.o.i. led to greater than a 99% transduction efficiency (data not shown). Expression of constitutively active Akt promoted the cytoplasmic localization of FOXO3a that appeared more pronounced than in the serum-stimulated cultures (Fig. 1C). In contrast, transduction with dominant-negative Akt strongly promoted FOXO3a localization in the nucleus (Fig. 1D). In quantitative analyses of these cultures, 5.7 ± 1.5% of cells scored for nuclear FOXO3a localization following transduction with Ad-myrAkt, and 99.0 ± 1.0% of cells scored for nuclear localization following transduction with Ad-dnAkt (Fig. 1E). Collectively, these data in HUVEC are consistent with mitogen-mediated FOXO3a regulation that has been reported in neuronal cells and fibroblasts, and they are in accordance with the proposed mechanism of Akt-mediated FOXO3a phosphorylation (17.Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5454) Google Scholar). Anoikis, cell death that results from a lack of proper cell-matrix attachments (24.Frisch S.M. Francis H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (2788) Google Scholar), is an important regulator of endothelial cell viability during an angiogenic response (25.Brooks P.C. Clark R.A.F. Cheresh D.A. Science. 1994; 264: 569-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (2750) Google Scholar). The disruption of adhesive interactions between endothelial cells and the extracellular matrix leads to an inactivation of Akt (13.Fujio Y. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16349-16354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar), down-regulation of FLIP (26.Aoudjit F. Vuori K. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 633-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), and activation of caspase-8 (27.Stupack D.G. Puente X.S. Boutsaboualoy S. Storgard C.M. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 459-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Therefore, FOXO3a translocation was assessed in HUVEC under conditions that promote anoikis. Rapid FOXO3a translocation to the nucleus could be detected in suspension culture (Fig. 2A). Quantitative analyses of these cultures revealed that FOXO3a translocation was time-dependent, with 36.2 ± 3.5% of cells displaying nuclear FOXO3a by 3 h and 80.5% by 12 h (Fig. 2B). To study the function of FOXO3a in HUVEC, replication-defective adenoviral vectors were constructed that express the wild-type human FOXO3a (Ad-WT-FOXO3a) or a mutant form that has alanine residues substituted for serine residues at positions 253 and 315 and the threonine residue at position 32 (Fig. 3A). The vector expressing the triple mutant form is referred to as Ad-TM-FOXO3a, and it is constitutively active because it cannot be inactivated by phosphorylation (4.Suhara T. Kim H.-S. Kirshenbaum L.A. Walsh K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 680-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 17.Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5454) Google Scholar). A third vector expresses the portion of the FOXO3a cDNA that encodes the DNA binding and regulatory phosphorylation domains but lacks the trans-activation domain. The vector expressing the truncated cDNA is referred to as dn-FOXO3a, and it functions in a dominant-negative manner because it can bind to DNA but cannot activate transcription. HUVEC cultures were transduced with Ad-WT-FOXO3a, Ad-TM-FOXO3a, or Ad-dn-FOXO3a and stimulated with serum. All vectors expressed FOXO3a protein, but the phosphorylation of regulatory residues was only detected in cultures transduced with wild-type or the truncated FOXO3a by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3B). Immunofluorescence staining of the transgene products was performed to validate the FOXO3a-expressing adenoviral vectors. HUVEC transduced with Ad-WT-FOXO3a and cultured in the presence of high serum (10% FBS) showed a predominantly cytoplasmic pattern of transgene-encoded FOXO3a expression (Fig. 4A). For these experiments, immunofluorescence conditions were such that only the virally encoded transgene product was detected with little or no signal from endogenous FOXO3a. Co-transduction of Ad-WT-FOXO3a and Ad-myrAkt led to complete exclusion of FOXO3a from the nucleus (Fig. 4, B and E), whereas co-transfection of Ad-WT-FOXO3a and Ad-dnAkt led to a predominantly nuclear staining pattern of FOXO3a (Fig. 4, C and E). In contrast, an almost exclusively nuclear staining pattern was observed with the TM-FOXO3a-expressing adenovirus, which was independent of serum concentration (Fig. 4D and data not shown). Furthermore, the nuclear localization of TM-FOXO3a was not influenced by transduction with Ad-dnAkt nor Ad-myrAkt (Fig. 4E). FOXO3a Regulates FLIP Expression—Akt has been shown to up-regulate FLIP expression, contributing to cellular survival (11.Suhara T. Mano T. Oliveira B.E. Walsh K. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of FOXO3a in FLIP regulation, subconfluent HUVEC were transduced with increasing concentrations of the adenoviral FOXO3a vectors. Following Ad-TM-FOXO3a gene transfer, significant decreases in FLIP protein levels were observed compared with GFP-transduced cells (Fig. 5A). The decrease in FLIP expression was dose-dependent with statistically significant r"

The basis of bcl-2 transcriptional regulation in keratinocytes is unknown. The sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway is frequently altered in BCCs. Mediators of shh signaling include the downstream transactivator, gli-1, and transrepressor, gli-3. Seven candidate gli binding sites were identified in the bcl-2 promoter. Cotransfection of increasing amounts of gli-1 in keratinoycytes resulted in a corresponding dose-dependent increase in bcl-2 promoter luciferase activity. Gli-1 was also able to up-regulate endogenous bcl-2. Gli-3 cotransfection resulted in no significant changes in bcl-2 promoter activity compared with control. Gli-3 has been demonstrated to be proteolytically processed into an N-terminal repressive form that can inhibit downstream transactivation by gli-1. Gli-3 mutants possessing only the N-terminal region or the C-terminal region were made and used in luciferase assays. The N terminus of gli-3 inhibited gli-1 transactivation of the bcl-2 promoter. Gel shift analysis and luciferase assays demonstrated that gli binding site 4 (-428 to -420), is important for gli transcriptional regulation. Skin samples from transgenic mice expressing an RU486 gli-1 transgene exhibited significantly higher levels of endogenous bcl-2 protein in epidermal keratinocytes as assessed by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry. Together, these findings provide consistent evidence that gli proteins can transcriptionally regulate the bcl-2 promoter and that gli-3 can inhibit transactivation by gli-1.

The sonic hedgehog (shh) pathway was first characterized in normal developmental processes, including the formation of the dorsal to ventral axis of the neural tube, the anterior to posterior axis of the limb bud, and the development of the foregut (7.Chiang C.

Alterations in the sonic hedgehog pathway have been implicated in the development of malignancies other than basal cell carcinoma including medulloblastoma and rhabdomyosarcoma (3.Ruiz i Altaba A. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 418-425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The sonic hedgehog receptor, patched (ptc), normally functions to inhibit shh signaling. Binding of shh to ptc relieves the inhibition, allowing for transduction to continue through smoothened (smo) and a large multiprotein complex in the cytosol (10.Ingham P.W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3505-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). The downstream transcription factors, gli-1, -2, and -3 bind to the same DNA sequence (5′-GACCACCCA-3′) (11.Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 634-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 12.Ruppert J.M. Vogelstein B. Arheden K. Kinzler K.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5408-5415Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Gli-2 and Gli-3 have both transactivation and repressive domains, whereas gli-1 has been suggested to function only as a transactivator (13.Dai P. Akimaru H. Tanaka Y. Maekawa T. Nakafuku M. Ishii S.

Development. 1999; 126: 3915-3924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein kinase A is believed to be the common negative regulator of the pathway (10.Ingham P.W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3505-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that PKA activity indirectly induces cleavage of gli-3 into its repressor form, which can be inhibited by shh (13.Dai P. Akimaru H. Tanaka Y. Maekawa T. Nakafuku M. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8143-8152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). The pathway is further complicated by the evidence that gli-3 may be required for transcriptional up-regulation of gli-1 (13.Dai P. Akimaru H. Tanaka Y. Maekawa T. Nakafuku M. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8143-8152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). BCC is associated with mutations in the shh pathway. Loss of heterozygosity is frequently found at the location of patched, 9q22, in patients suffering from nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome who are predisposed to developing BCCs, and in sporadic BCC tumors (2.Gailani M.R. Bale A.E. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1997; 89: 1103-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 15.Gailani M.R. Leffell D.J. Ziegler A. Gross E.G. Brash D.E. Bale A.E. J. Natl.

Premature protein termination and inactivating mutations of patched leads to increased expression of a mutant patched protein (2.Gailani M.R. Bale A.E. J. Natl.

Chenevix-Trench G. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 60: 21-26PubMed Google Scholar). The loss of ptc leads to subsequent increased expression of smoothened, shh, and gli-1, because of the positive feedback loop initiated by gli-1 transactivation (5.Kallassy M. Toftgard R. Ueda M. Nakazawa K. Vorechovsky I. Yamasaki H. Nakazawa H. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4731-4735PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Dahmane N. Lee J. Robins P. Heller P. Ruiz i Altaba A.

Andersen M.M. Lo P. Experientia (Basel). 1996; 52: 1008-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). bcl-2 is composed of three exons, with an untranslated first exon and two introns of 220 bp and a large 370-kb intron (22.Seto M. Jaeger U. Hockett R.D. Graninger W. Bennett S. Goldman P. Korsmeyer S.J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Studies show that bcl-2 has two promoter regions. P2 is located immediately 5′ to the open reading frame in exon II and contains both a TATA and CAAT box (22.Seto M. Jaeger U. Hockett R.D. Graninger W. Bennett S. Goldman P. Korsmeyer S.J.

Graninger W. Bennett S. Goldman P. Korsmeyer S.J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). The second promoter, P1, is located in exon I in a GC-rich region and does not contain a TATA nor a CAAT box (22.Seto M. Jaeger U. Hockett R.D. Graninger W. Bennett S. Goldman P. Korsmeyer S.J.

In addition to these positive regulatory sites, the promoter also contains pie1 binding sites, which serve as negative regulatory regions and are thought to be important in pre-B cell selection (29.Chen H.M.

We have previously demonstrated that the members of the bcl-2 family are expressed in specific regions of the epidermis. Bcl-2 is exclusively expressed in the basal layer of the epidermis and undergoes a 2–3-fold increase in expression in BCCs (31.Rodriguez-Villanueva J. Colome M.I. Brisbay S. McDonnell T.J. Pathol.

Here we demonstrate a link between the shh signaling pathway and bcl-2 expression in keratinocytes. Seven candidate gli binding sites were identified in the bcl-2 promoter. Gli binding site 4 was shown to be important in the transcriptional regulation by gli. Additionally it was demonstrated that a balance between gli-1 transactivation and gli-3 repression controls bcl-2 levels in keratinocytes. These observations suggest that the overexpression of gli-1 in basal cell carcinomas may contribute to the development of BCC by transcriptionally up-regulating bcl-2, thus inhibiting cell death. Plasmid Constructs—The pGL3-2.8 bcl-2 promoter construct is illustrated in Fig. 1. The sequence depicted in Fig. 1 can be found in GenBank™, accession numbers X51898 and M13994. A three-step cloning strategy was used. Briefly, a 308-bp product was PCR amplified with primer generated XhoI and HindIII sites from a 7.8-kb genomic HindIII fragment of the Bcl-2 gene. This 308-bp product covers a region just 5′ to the AccI site to just 5′ of the initiation codon. This product was cloned into the XhoI and HindIII sites of the pGL3 basic luciferase vector (Promega, Madison, WI) to produce pGL3-308 bcl-2. Next, a 486-bp XhoI,AccI restriction fragment was cloned into pGL3-308 bcl-2 producing pGL3-748 bcl-2, which lacks gli binding sites 1 through 6. Finally, a 2100-bp XhoI fragment was cloned into pGL3-748 bcl-2 producing pGL3-2.8 bcl-2. The remaining bcl-2 luciferase deletion constructs were made using unique restriction sites in the promoter as observed in Fig. 6 and blunt-end ligation. pGL3–2.8bcl-2Δ1, BbrPI and BlnI; pGL3-2.8 bcl-2Δ2–5, BlnI and StuI; pGL3-2.8 bcl-2Δ5, StuI; pGL3-2.8 bcl-2Δ1–5-luc, BbrPI and StuI. pGL3-2.8 bcl-2Δ1–5/7 was made by cutting pGL3-2.8 bcl-2 with BssHII and isolating the 831-bp fragment and inserting it into MluI cut pGL3 basic vector. All constructs were sequence verified.Fig. 6Bcl-2 luciferase constructs. The pGL3-2.8 bcl-2 luciferase construct was made as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Unique restriction sites were used to make bcl-2 luciferase construct mutants as described.

PCR was performed using 96 °C for 4 min followed by 35 cycles or 96 °C for 1 min, 62 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min, and a final 5-min 72 °C elongation step. The final 237-bp PCR product was cut with XmaI and inserted into XmaI cut pGL3SV40. The constructs were sequence verified. Gli-1 and gli-3 cDNA constructs were generously provided by Dr. Bert Volgelstein. Gli-1 pcDNA was made by inserting the HindIII/XbaI fragment of gli-1 into the HindIII/XbaI site of the pcDNA 3.1 Zeocin (+) vector from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Gli-3 pcDNA was made by inserting the EcoRI fragment of gli-3 that cuts at bp 105 in the cDNA and on the 3′ side of gli-3 in the pBlueScript vector into the EcoRI site of pcDNA 3.1 His B (Invitrogen) in-frame with a 5′ His tag. Gli-3ΔN pcDNA was made by cutting gli-3 pcDNA with BamHI, which cuts at 1238 in the cDNA upstream of the zinc fingers and with EcoRI. The 3817-bp C-terminal fragment was isolated and ligated to BamHI/EcoRI-cut pcDNA 3.1 His A (Invitrogen) in-frame with the 5′ terminal His tag. Gli-3ΔC pcDNA was cloned by cutting gli-3 pcDNA with ClaI, which cuts at 2285 in the cDNA downstream of the zinc fingers and with EcoRV, which cuts 3′ to the cDNA insertion site. The 10-kb fragment was isolated, klenowed, and ligated. All plasmids were sequence verified. Cell Culture—Primary keratinocytes were obtained from human neonatal foreskin and co-cultured with a feeder layer of 3T3 J2 fibroblasts (∼1 × 106) treated with mitomycin C (4 μg/ml) for 2 h. The tissue samples were washed in sterile, serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Red blood cells and stroma were removed. The tissue was minced with sterile curved iris scissors and transferred to a sterile spinner bottle with 10 ml of 0.1% trypsin for 45 min at room temperature. After 45 min cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 5 min. The trypsin was aspirated and the cells were washed in 10 ml of serum-containing keratinocyte media (3 parts Ham's F-12, 1 part Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 5% fetal bovine serum, 0.4 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 8.4 ng/ml cholera toxin, 5 μg/ml insulin, 24 μg/ml adenine, 1× penicillin/streptomycin) without epidermal growth factor and replated in a 0.5–1.0-ml volume on a feeder layer of 3T3 J2 fibroblasts. The trypsinization step was repeated for an additional 45 min for 4 more rounds. After 24 h the medium was changed and epidermal growth factor (10 ng/ml) was added to the media. After 5–7 days the feeder layer was removed with 0.02% EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.35) and a fresh feeder layer was added. Fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% calf serum and 1× penicillin/streptomycin. Media was changed every other day. SDS-PAGE—The TnT coupled reticulocyte lysate system kit from Promega was used to make in vitro transcribed/translated protein according to the manufacturer's protocol with gli-1 pcDNA and gli-3 pcDNA expression constructs. 5 μl of [35S]methionine-labeled in vitro transcribed/translated protein was boiled for 5 min in 4× sample loading buffer (200 mm Tris, 400 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 8% SDS, 0.4% bromphenol blue, and 40% glycerol) and run on a 7.5% SDS-acrylamide gel, dried, and autoradiographed. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Single stranded oligonucleotides were obtained from Sigma and annealed at a final concentration of 50 ng/μl in 10× annealing buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 60 mm MgCl2, 500 mm NaCl, 60 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 2 mg/ml gelatin) by boiling for 5 min and cooled to room temperature overnight. Oligonucleotides were end labeled using the forward labeling reaction incubating 1 μl of double stranded DNA, 5 μl of 5× forward labeling buffer, 1 μl of T4 kinase, 2.5 μl of [32P]ATP, and 15.5 μl of water at 37 °C for 10 min and heat inactivating for 10 min at 65 °C. 25 μl of water was added to equal 1 ng/μl. The labeled DNA was purified on a G-25 column according to the manufacturers protocol. The binding reaction was performed by incubating 10 μl of binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol and 4% glycerol), 1 μl of poly(DI-DC) (1 μg/μl), 3 μl of unlabeled TnT reaction protein with 1 μl of cold competitor oligonucleotide for 30 min on ice. 1 μl of the hot probe was added and incubated for 30 min on ice. The reactions were run on a 4% acrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE at 100 V that was prerun for 1 h. The gel was dried and autoradiographed. Oligonucleotides used in the analysis include: gli positive control, 5′-GATCTAAGAGCTCCCGAAGACCACCCACAATGATGGTTGTATGT-3′; gli mutant, 5′-GATCTAAGAGCTCCCGAAGACTATTTGCAATGATGGTTGTATGT-3′; bcl-2-1, 5′-TGGAGACCTTTAGGAGCCCACCCACCCCAGCGTTAGGACGGTGG-3′; bcl-2-2, 5′-GTCCAGGCGACACACACACTCCCACATACACGGCCAGAAAAGGT-3′; bcl-2-3, 5′-CGTGCGATTCCCCGGGAGCCCCCACCCCGTCGGACCCCAGCG-3′; bcl-2-4, 5′-GTCGCGGACCCCAGCGACCACCAAGTCGCACCGGCCTCCGCAGG-3′; bcl-2-5, 5′-AGCAGAAGGCCCCGCGCACACCCACGCGCGGGGCCCGCGGGGAG-3′; bcl-2-6, 5′-CCCCACCCCTCGCCGCACCACACACAGCGCGGGCTTCTAGCGCT-3′; bcl-2-7, 5′-GTCCAAGAATGCAAAGCACATCCAATAAAATAGCTGGATTATAA-3′. These were annealed to their corresponding 3′ to 5′ oligonucleotides. Luciferase Assays—The dual luciferase reporter kit from Promega was used for luciferase assays. Primary keratinocytes were plated in 12-well plates on a feeder layer of mitomycin C-treated 3T3 J2 fibroblasts. When the cells reached 60% confluency, the feeder layer was removed with 0.02% EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.35. 1, 3, or 5 μg of gli-1 pcDNA or gli-3 pcDNA were transfected with nonspecific DNA to equal a total of 5 μg with LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 2 μg of the pGL3-2.8 bcl-2 reporter construct and 0.5 μg of the Renilla luciferase construct under control of the cytomegalovirus promoter (Promega) to normalize for transfection efficiency were also transfected. To assess the effect of gli-3 and gli-3 mutants on gli-1 transactivation, the experiment was performed as stated above except, 2 μg of each cDNA construct was used and nonspecific DNA was used to normalize to 4 μg. In addition 2 μg of the pGL3-2.9 bcl-2 and 0.5 μg of Renilla were used. Deletion construct luciferase assays were performed by transfection of 2 μg of gli-1 pcDNA or vector control, 2 μg of the corresponding bcl-2 luciferase construct, and 0.5 μg of Renilla luciferase. In all experiments, protein lysates were taken 24 h after transfection according to the protocol from the dual-luciferase reporter kit and read on a luminometer. Each experiment was repeated at least 3 times, each time in triplicate. Analysis of Skin from gli-1 Transgenic Mice—Skin samples were obtained from K14p65GL control mice and K14p65GL/gli-1 bitransgenic mice (19.Nilsson M. Unden A.B. Krause D. Malmqwist U. Raza K. Zaphiropoulos P.G. Toftgard R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3438-3443Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). The construct used to generate these mice targets a gli-1 transgene specifically to the epidermis using an RU486 inducible keratin 14 promoter. The bigenic mice were exposed to the inducer RU486 for 8 weeks by subcutaneous implantation of a pellet containing 0.55 mg of RU486 with a release time of 60 days (Innovation Research). Tissues used for immunohistochemistry were formalin-fixed and -paraffin embedded. Preceding incubation in 1% H2O2 in methanol for 30 min, sections were dewaxed, rehydrated, and submerged in 10 mm citrate buffer while being heated in a 97 °C water bath for 20 min. Sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with a 1:200 dilution of a mouse monoclonal antibody against bcl-2 from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY) diluted in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The immunoreaction was visualized using an avidin-biotin complex (Dako, Carpinteria, CA) with 0.004% hydrogen peroxidase as substrate and diaminobenzidine as a chromogen. Counterstaining was performed with Mayer's hematoxylin. Consecutive serial sections were used as controls with omission of primary antibody. Additionally, 2-mm mouse ear biopsies were ground in a solution containing SDS buffer (5% SDS, 20% β-mercaptoethanol in Tris, pH 6.8) with a pestle for immunoblot analysis. This was then boiled for 10 min and centrifuged at 4 °C for 30 min. Supernatant was used for SDS-PAGE analysis with loading buffers as described previously and run on a 12.5% SDS-acrylamide gel. Protein expression was assessed using mouse bcl-2 antibody from BD Pharmingen (San Diego, CA) and α-actin, Sigma. RNA was isolated from skin biopsies using the RNeasy Mini kit from Qiagen (Valencia, CA) as per the supplier's protocol. 1 μg was treated with RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega) according to the supplier's protocol. Synthesis of cDNA was done using Superscript RNase H-reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), 50 ng of oligo(dT)15 primer (Promega), PCR nucleotide mixture, and recombinant RNasin ribonuclease inhibitor (Promega). 5 μl of cDNA was used for the PCR using Taq DNA polymerase (Promega) and oligonucleotide primers specific for gli-1 for 40 cycles. Reaction products were electrophoresed on a 2% SeKem LE-agarose gel. Identification of Candidate Gli Binding Sites in the bcl-2 Promoter—The observation that both gli-1 and bcl-2 are overexpressed in basal cell carcinomas prompted us to search the bcl-2 promoter for potential gli binding sites. Gli-1, -2, and -3 bind to the DNA consensus sequence 5′-GACCACCCA-3′ (11.Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 634-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 12.Ruppert J.M. Vogelstein B. Arheden K. Kinzler K.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5408-5415Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). PatSearch version 1.1 from Transfac was used to locate potential regions of gli binding. Data base analysis revealed seven potential sites (Fig. 1). Sites 1 through 5 are located upstream of the P1 transcriptional start site, whereas site 6 is located downstream of P1 in exon 2 and site 7 is located slightly upstream of the P2 transcriptional start site. The homology of each gli binding site to the canonical consensus sequence 5′-GACCACCCA-3′ varied from 55% (site 2) to 89% (sites 1 and 4). Gli-1 Positively Regulates bcl-2 Transcription—Gli-1 has been shown to contain only a transactivation domain and is considered the primary regulator of shh-induced transactivation (13.Dai P. Akimaru H. Tanaka Y. Maekawa T. Nakafuku M. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8143-8152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 14.Sasaki H. Nishizaki Y. Hui C. Nakafuku M. Kondoh H. Development. 1999; 126: 3915-3924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gli-3, however, contains both a transactivation domain and a repression domain (13.Dai P. Akimaru H. Tanaka Y. Maekawa T. Nakafuku M. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8143-8152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 14.Sasaki H. Nishizaki Y. Hui C. Nakafuku M. Kondoh H. Development. 1999; 126: 3915-3924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Luciferase assays were used to determine whether gli-1 and gli-3 are able to regulate bcl-2 transcription. A bcl-2 reporter construct (pGL3–2.8 bcl-2) was made by ligating a 2.8-kb fragment of the bcl-2 promoter to the firefly luciferase gene. Assays were done in primary keratinocyte cultures obtained from neonatal human foreskin. Increasing concentrations of gli-1 pcDNA transfected with the pGL3–2.8 bcl-2 promoter construct resulted in a dose-dependent increase in promoter activity. In contrast, increasing concentrations of gli-3 pcDNA resulted in no apparent change in steady-state promoter activity (Fig. 2). Reporter luciferase values were normalized for transfection efficiency using values obtained with the Renilla luciferase construct. Similar results were obtained using NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (data not shown). The N-terminal Domain of Gli-3 Inhibits Gli-1 Transactivation—To determine whether gli-3 is able to inhibit gli-1 transactivation of the bcl-2 promoter, luciferase assays were done in primary ke"
https://openalex.org/W2063656674,"A periodic mesoporous organosilica composed of interconnected three-ring [Si(CH2)]3 units built of three SiO2(CH2)2 tetrahedral subunits is reported. It represents the archetype of a previously unknown class of nanocomposite materials in which two bridging organic groups are bound to each silicon atom. It can be obtained with powder and oriented film morphologies. The nanocomposite is self-assembled from the cyclic three-ring silsesquioxane [(EtO)2Si(CH2)]3 precursor and a surfactant mesophase to give a well-ordered mesoporous framework. Low dielectric constants and good mechanical stability of the films were measured, making this material interesting for microelectronic applications. Methylene group reactivity of the three-ring precursor provides entry to a family of nanocomposites, exemplified by the synthesis and self-assembly of [(EtO)2Si(CHR)][(EtO)2Si(CH2)]2 (where R indicates iodine, bromine, or an ethyl group)."
https://openalex.org/W1979244145,"Hydrophobins are proteins specific to filamentous fungi. Hydrophobins have several important roles in fungal physiology, for example, adhesion, formation of protective surface coatings, and the reduction of the surface tension of water, which allows growth of aerial structures. Hydrophobins show remarkable biophysical properties, for example, they are the most powerful surface-active proteins known. To this point the molecular basis of the function of this group of proteins has been largely unknown. We have now determined the crystal structure of the hydrophobin HFBII from Trichoderma reesei at 1.0 Å resolution. HFBII has a novel, compact single domain structure containing one α-helix and four antiparallel β-strands that completely envelop two disulfide bridges. The protein surface is mainly hydrophilic, but two β-hairpin loops contain several conserved aliphatic side chains that form a flat hydrophobic patch that makes the molecule amphiphilic. The amphiphilicity of the HFBII molecule is expected to be a source for surface activity, and we suggest that the behavior of this surfactant is greatly enhanced by the self-assembly that is favored by the combination of size and rigidity. This mechanism of function is supported by atomic force micrographs that show highly ordered arrays of HFBII at the air water interface. The data presented show that much of the current views on structure function relations in hydrophobins must be re-evaluated. Hydrophobins are proteins specific to filamentous fungi.

The data presented show that much of the current views on structure function relations in hydrophobins must be re-evaluated. Fungi are found all around us in nature in decaying plant litter, as mushrooms that grow in the forests, or as molds that spoil foods. They have a remarkable ability to adapt to a wide variety of environmental conditions and ecosystems (1.Gow N. Gadd G. The Growing Fungus. Chapman & Hall, London1995Crossref Google Scholar). They grow by spreading their hyphae, which can penetrate substrates upon which they grow, they can grow upwards into the air to spread spores, or they can attach to solid supports. One group of proteins that have been found to have an important role for fungal growth and development are the hydrophobins. They seem to be unique to fungi and have not been found in any other organisms. A common property in hydrophobins is that they seem to have a wide range of functions that are all apparently related to surface activity in one way or the other (2.Wösten H.A. de Vocht M.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1469: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Here, surface activity means the tendency to adsorb at interfaces and surfaces. The term interface means the boundary between, for example, air and liquid, or liquid and solid. Another word for a surface-active compound is “surfactant” (3.Jönsson B. Lindman B. Holmberg K. Kronberg B. Surfactants and Polymers in Aquous Solution. John Wiley & Sons, Chichester, UK1998Google Scholar). When a surfactant compound migrates to the air-water interface, it lowers the surface tension, i.e. the cohesive forces between water molecules at the surface. Hydrophobins are, for example, involved in the formation of aerial structures in fungi (4.Talbot N.J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R78-R81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Talbot N.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 295-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 6.Wösten H.A. van Wetter M.A. Lugones L.G. van der Mei H.C. Busscher H.J. Wessels J.G. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 85-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Here, the hydrophobins seem to serve a dual role by first lowering the water surface tension, which allows the fungus to penetrate this barrier, and then by forming a protective coating on the aerial structures and spores. Fungi also rely on hydrophobins for attachment to surfaces such as plant leaves or insect cuticles. This property has been demonstrated to be essential for the infectivity of some pathogenic fungi, which cause Dutch elm disease, rice blast, and chestnut blight (7.Tucker S.L. Talbot N.J. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 2001; 39: 385-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). It is quite possible that the properties of hydrophobins have played an important role during evolution in enabling filamentous fungi to occupy their ecological niches. Hydrophobins are among the most surface-active biomolecules known (2.Wösten H.A. de Vocht M.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1469: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). They have a size of about 100 amino acids, and are also remarkably stable and can withstand temperatures near the boiling point of water. Consequently, they have potential for several applications. Hydrophobins can be used as adhesion domains for the immobilization of proteins to solid supports (8.Scholtmeijer K. Janssen M.I. Gerssen B. de Vocht M.L. van Leeuwen B.M. van Kooten T.G. Wosten H.A. Wessels J.G. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 1367-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 9.Linder M. Szilvay G.R. Nakari-Setälä T. Söderlund H. Penttilä M. Protein. Sci. 2002; 11: 2257-2266Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and as tags in fusion proteins for affinity purification (10.Collen A. Persson J. Linder M. Nakari-Setälä T. Penttilä M. Tjerneld F. Sivars U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1569: 139-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The latter method relies on the very high partitioning of hydrophobins in surfactant-water two phase systems (11.Linder M. Selber K. Nakari-Setälä T. Qiao M. Kula M.-R. Penttilä M. Biomacromolecules. 2001; 2: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Hydrophobins are also highly efficient foam-forming agents. This property can be illustrated by a practical example. It has been found that microgram amounts of hydrophobin in a bottle of beer causes an explosive gush of foam upon opening the bottle. The contaminating hydrophobins probably originated from fungal growth during the malting or earlier stages (12.Kleemola, T., Nakari-Setälä, T., Linder, M., Penttilä, M., Olkku, J., and Haikara, A. (2002) Proceedings of the European Brewery Convention 2001, pp. 127-138Google Scholar). A large number of genes for hydrophobins have been identified, and they all share a characteristic pattern of Cys residues in their primary sequence (Fig. 1) (13.Wösten H.A.B. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 625-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Hydropathy patterns can be used to divide them into classes I and II (14.Wessels J.G.H. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 1994; 32: 413-437Crossref Scopus (354) Google Scholar). The proteins in the two classes seem to differ in the solubility of the aggregates that they form. The sequence similarity of hydrophobins is in general weak, making it sometimes difficult to define them based on primary sequence. However, the characteristic and unique pattern of Cys residues is conserved in all hydrophobins. An essential feature of hydrophobins is that they form different supramolecular assemblies. It has been shown by atomic force microscopy that the class II hydrophobins HFBI and HFBII from Trichoderma reesei form highly ordered monolayer films (15.Paananen A. Vuorimaa E. Torkkeli M. Penttilä M. Kauranen M. Ikkala O. Lemmetyinen H. Serimaa R. Linder M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5253-5258Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 16.Serimaa R. Torkkeli M. Paananen A. Linder M. Kisko K. Knaapila M. Ikkala O. Vuorimaa E. Lemmetyinen H. J. Appl. Cryst. 2003; 36: 499-502Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The same proteins also form crystalline fibrils (17.Torkkeli M. Serimaa R. Ikkala O. Linder M. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 2240-2247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the class I hydrophobin SC3 from Schizophyllum commune forms a “rodlet coating” where nanometer size rods are formed on interfaces by self-assembly (18.Wösten H.A.B. de Vries O.M.H. Wessels J.G.H. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 1567-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). These and other class I hydrophobin assemblages are remarkable because of their insolubility. They are insoluble even in hot solutions of sodium dodecyl sulfate and can only be dissolved in some strong acids, such as trifluoroacetic acid. After evaporation of the acid, it is possible to again solubilize the protein in water and to make new coatings that are indistinguishable from the original ones. For some insoluble class I members, it has been shown that aggregates formed have similarities to amyloid fibrils based on reactions with the stain Congo Red (19.Mackay J.P. Matthews J.M. Winefield R.D. Mackay L.G. Haverkamp R.G. Templeton M.D. Structure. 2001; 9: 83-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 20.de Vocht M.L. Reviakine I. Wosten H.A. Brisson A. Wessels J.G. Robillard G.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28428-28432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To this point, the properties of hydrophobins such as aggregation, adhesion, and surface activity have hampered structural studies. For example, as is shown in the current work, the widely used data on disulfide pairing (21.Yaguchi M. Puszari-Carey M. Roy C. Surewicz W.K. Carey P.R. Stevenson K.J. Richards W.C. Takai S. Sticklen M.B. Sherald J.L. Dutch Elm Disease Research, Cellular and Molecular Approaches. Springer Verlag, New York1993: 152-170Crossref Google Scholar) were incorrect. An NMR study of the EAS hydrophobin from Neurospora crassa conidia (class I) suggested that the protein is largely unstructured in solution, showing only a small region of β-sheet structure (19.Mackay J.P. Matthews J.M. Winefield R.D. Mackay L.G. Haverkamp R.G. Templeton M.D. Structure. 2001; 9: 83-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Studies on the SC3 hydrophobin have suggested that the protein has different conformational states and different secondary structure contents when in solution or at a hydrophobic-water interface (20.de Vocht M.L.

It has also been proposed that the protein refolds at hydrophobic-hydrophilic interfaces (23.Zangi R. De Vocht M.L. Robillard G.T. Mark A.E. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 112-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In this work, we present the first three-dimensional structure of a hydrophobin. We also present new atomic force microscopy (AFM) 1The abbreviation used is: AFM, atomic force microscopy. data showing that this hydrophobin forms highly ordered self-assembled layers at the air/water interface. Together, these data suggest a mechanism for how this protein functions. Protein Expression and Purification—HFBII was produced using the T. reesei strain (VTT number D-99745) and grown as described in Ref. 24.Bailey M. Askolin S. Hörhammer N. Tenkanen M. Linder M.

To one liter of the centrifuged (4000 × g, 20 min) culture supernatant 2 g Berol 325 (Akzo Nobel) was added. The solution was allowed to settle in a separation funnel after mixing and the Berol phase was collected. The Berol was extracted with a 100 ml acetate buffer (50 mm, pH 5.0) and 15 ml of isobutanol with a subsequent centrifugation (3220 × g, 15 min). The protein was further purified by preparative reversed phase chromatography using a Vydac C4 (1 × 20 cm) column and a gradient elution from 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid to 100% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Peak fractions were pooled and lyophilized. The protein identity was confirmed using mass spectroscopy and antibodies (11.Linder M. Selber K. Nakari-Setälä T. Qiao M. Kula M.-R. Penttilä M.

Crystallization and Structure Determination—The protein crystals grew in hanging drops using 25% polyethylene glycol 2000, 0.2 m lithium sulfate, 10 mm MnCl2 and 0.1 m Na-HEPES (pH 7.5). Crystallization drops were prepared by mixing equal amounts of protein solution (8 mg/ml) and crystallization agent. The data set was collected at 1.5 Å resolution using a copper rotating anode as an x-ray source (wavelength 1.54 Å) and at 1.0 Å resolution at the EMBL X11 beamline at the DORIS storage ring, DESY (wavelength 0.8126 Å) and processed with DENZO (26.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The anomalous difference Patterson map calculated with the data measured at the home laboratory showed a clear single peak at Harker sections, suggesting that one manganese ion would have bound to the protein. The coordinates of this position were used in the program ACORN (27.Foadi J. Woolfson M.M. Dodson E.J. Wilson K.S. Jia-xing Y. Chao-de Z. Acta Cryst. 2000; D56: 1137-1147Google Scholar) as a starting point for the calculation of phases. The refined phases were further used in the program ARP/WARP (28.Perrakis A. Morris R.M. Lamzin V.S. Nature Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2565) Google Scholar), which automatically built the preliminary model for two protein molecules in the asymmetric unit. The structure was refined by iterative cycles of manual refitting with O (29.Jones A.T. Zhou J.Y. Cowan C.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Cryst. 1991; A47: 110-119Crossref Scopus (13014) Google Scholar) and positional refinement with REFMAC. The final model contains two protein molecules in an asymmetric unit.

Images were acquired under ambient conditions in tapping mode using a NanoScopeIIIa Multimode AFM (Digital Instruments) equipped with an “E” scanner. The tapping mode was used with scan rates 0.6–1 Hz and as low a force as possible. Non-contact silicon cantilevers (NCH, NanoSensors) with the nominal resonance frequency of around 300 kHz and tip radius ca. 10 nm were used. A scanning probe image processor (SPIP, Image Metrology, Denmark) was used in image processing, which only included flattening in order to remove possible tilt in the image data, and in image analysis. Imaging of the HFBII surface was reproducible. The topography and phase contrast images were captured simultaneously. The phase contrast image shows the phase difference between the oscillations of the cantilever driving piezo and the detected oscillations. It is thought that image contrast is derived from surface properties such as stiffness and viscoelasticity (hard tapping) or hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity (light tapping), but it also shows enhanced edge structures. Structure of HFBII—We have crystallized a member of the class II hydrophobins, HFBII from T. reesei, and determined its three-dimensional structure at 1.0 Å resolution. HFBII is a single domain protein with the approximate dimensions of 24 × 27 × 30 Å. The structure represents a fold not previously described. It consists of one β-hairpin motif (strands S1 and S2) linked to an α-helix that is linked to the second β-hairpin motif (strands S3 and S4). These two motifs are arranged together in an unusual way (31.Branden C. Tooze J. Introduction to Protein Structure. Garland Publishing, New York1998: 31Google Scholar). They form a barrel consisting of four antiparallel β-strands in the order S4-S2-S1-S3. The two β-hairpins interlock together in much the same way as the two leather pieces of a baseball are sewn together (Fig. 2). Disulfide Bridges—A distinctive feature of hydrophobins is that they contain eight Cys residues that form four disulfide bridges (Fig. 3). The current structure shows that bridge 14–26 connects the strands of the first β-hairpin together and that bridge 53–64 connects the strands of the second β-hairpin. The four sulfur atoms of these two bridges are completely inside the β-barrel. The remaining two bridges are outside the β-barrel. The bridge 3–52 connects the N-terminal loop to β-strand S3, and the bridge 13–43 connects the β-strand S1 and the helix together. The disulfide bridges are symmetrically located in almost the same plane in the structure (Fig. 3). They form a disulfide bridge network that efficiently spans the entire molecule thus creating a very stable and compact structure. Hydrophobic Surface Patch—Hydrophobins are highly surface-active and interact strongly with hydrophobic surfaces. Surface features of the protein are expected to be important for this function. The amino acid sequence comparison of class II hydrophobins revealed a number of conserved and exposed hydrophobic residues (Figs. 1 and 4). Interestingly, these residues are all aliphatic and are located in two β-hairpins. The HFBII residues Val-18, Leu-19, Leu-21, Ile-22, and Val-24 are located in the first hairpin (loop 1). Residues Val-54, Val-57, Ala-58, Ala-61, and Leu-63 are located in the second hairpin (loop 2). A hydrophobic surface patch is thus formed and is completed by Leu-7 in the N-terminal loop. As we examine the overall shape of the protein, we note that the surface at the hydrophobic patch is relatively flat. It also seems that loop 1 has a pronounced role in the formation of this hydrophobic patch. The total surface area of a HFBII monomer is about 3200 Å2, and the estimated area of the conserved hydrophobic patch is about 400 Å2 (12% of the total). Self-assembled Layers—AFM images show polycrystalline structures consisting of two-dimensional single crystalline domains in the surface layers of HFBII. In Fig. 5, an image of 100 × 100 nm2 in size is shown. The crystallinity of the protein layer was confirmed and the lattice constants were determined by Fourier transformation of the image data. An oblique structure with lattice constants a = 67.1 Å, b = 44.8 Å, γ = 139.2 degree was obtained. The lattice constants equal qualitatively to the lattice constants found in Langmuir-Blodgett films of HFBII (15.Paananen A. Vuorimaa E. Torkkeli M. Penttilä M. Kauranen M. Ikkala O. Lemmetyinen H. Serimaa R. Linder M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5253-5258Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The slight distortion observed in the AFM images, and hence in the transformed images also, is due to scanner hysteresis, creep, and drift in the microscope. These problems are important to consider because of the relatively slow scan speeds and because images of the first full scan were captured in order to obtain images of the soft protein surfaces with a non-contaminated tip. The way in which the sample was prepared and the similarity to the previously studied Langmuir-Blodgett films suggest that the image most likely represents the air-water interface that is deposited on the solid support as the water has evaporated. The presented structure of HFBII offers new perspectives for understanding and exploiting the biophysical properties of hydrophobins, such as their strongly amphiphilic nature, self-assembly, and aggregation. HFBII has a globular structure that is stabilized by a network of disulfide bonds. On the protein surface, there is distinct patch of aliphatic side chains that are conserved in homologous proteins. We suggest that this patch makes the hydrophobin molecule amphiphilic and is therefore highly important to the function of the protein. One side of the molecule is thus easily solvated by water, whereas the other tries to escape it. However, the exposed hydrophobic side chains must be prevented from turning to the inside of the protein hydrophobic core to escape water. Therefore, the rigidity of the HFBII molecule may assist in keeping the side chains of the hydrophobic patch exposed to solvent. In addition to the atomic resolution structure of HFBII, we also present here atomic force micrographs of HFBII that show molecular films with highly regular patterns. We previously have shown that ordered films can be made using the Langmuir-Blodgett technique (15.Paananen A. Vuorimaa E. Torkkeli M. Penttilä M. Kauranen M. Ikkala O. Lemmetyinen H. Serimaa R. Linder M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5253-5258Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), but by refining the technique we were now able to show that such ordered interface layers are formed spontaneously at the surface of water droplets. We thus have two views, i.e. the structure of the individual molecule, and the structure of an assembly that they form. Together, these data can be used to understand how this protein functions. As surfactants (surface-active agents), the hydrophobins are undoubtedly interesting molecules. HFBII is able to reduce the surface tension of water from 72 mJ/m2 to 28 mJ/m2 at a concentration of 20 μg/ml. 2S. Askolin, manuscript in preparation. One major difference, compared with most other highly surface-active molecules, is that the relatively large size of HFBII is combined with rigidity in the molecule, i.e. it is a shape-persistent molecule. The question arises how shape persistency affects amphiphilicity compared with more small or flexible surface-active molecules. A possible effect is that by reducing the conformational degrees of freedom, the mixing entropy in solutions can be drastically reduced, which promotes aggregation tendency and reduces solubility (see Ref. 32.Gedde U.W. Polymer Physics. Chapman & Hall, London1995Google Scholar). This may be important in surface attachment in order to guarantee that the hydrophobins adhere well and are not lost due to redissolvation. That is, the highly ordered surface layer is formed because the individual molecules are rigid, amphiphilic, and large enough to make favorable intermolecular contacts. Therefore, favorable lateral contacts can enhance the surface activity of hydrophobins. The role of these factors on the origin of the high surface activity of hydrophobins could be tested by mutating amino acids, such as the charged residues, putatively forming lateral interactions. Previously, it has been shown that hydrophobins can have a complex multimerization behavior in solutions and at interfaces (15.Paananen A. Vuorimaa E. Torkkeli M. Penttilä M. Kauranen M. Ikkala O. Lemmetyinen H. Serimaa R. Linder M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5253-5258Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). HFBII probably forms tetramers at high protein concentrations, but dimers or monomers occur at lower concentrations (17.Torkkeli M. Serimaa R. Ikkala O. Linder M. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 2240-2247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The wild-type HFBI hydrophobin behaved similarly, but formed aggregates approximately the size of decamers when it was genetically fused to a 40-kDa cellulase enzyme (9.Linder M. Szilvay G.R. Nakari-Setälä T. Söderlund H. Penttilä M. Protein. Sci. 2002; 11: 2257-2266Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In the crystal structure of HFBII, the asymmetric unit contains two protein molecules that form a dimer (Fig. 6A). The molecules pack with their hydrophobic patches toward each other, with the contact face being roughly half of the hydrophobic patch, about 230 Å2. Almost all residues on the dimer interface belong to the first hairpin: Val-18, Leu-19, Leu-21, Ile-22, and Val-24. Only Ala-61 from the second hairpin participates in the crystal contact, leaving the majority of the hydrophobic residues from the second hairpin exposed to solvent. Thus, it is evident that by burying hydrophobic surfaces in the oligomer interfaces, hydrophobins become more soluble. The small monomer-monomer contact area in the crystal suggests a connection between multimer formation and surface adhesion. If steric factors in the dimer interactions leave a significant part of the hydrophobic surface to be solvated by water, this dimer state can be considered a high-energy state. Larger hydrophobic interfaces such as the air water interface, could more easily provide a larger water-free environment, and thus produce a low-energy state. HFBII molecules would then preferentially expose their hydrophobic faces to larger interfaces than to each other (Fig. 6B). Class II hydrophobins have structurally critical residues that are highly conserved within the family. For example, Phe-39, which is in the α-helix, is completely conserved and packed against the β-barrel. This kind of conservation would indicate that the structures of other class II hydrophobins would be relatively similar to HFBII and that the fold does not allow larger changes in the amino acid sequence. However, the sequence similarity between classes I and II is much weaker. Because the disulfide pattern and spacing between the hydrophobin families is the most conserved part, it would also suggest that the pairing would be the same in the two families. So far this has not been experimentally verified. However, it may be a very difficult task to demonstrate disulfide connections using biochemical methods because the C and N termini are connected by one of the disulfide bridges, Cys-3-Cys-52. As previously noted in the literature, one main difference between class I and II hydrophobins is the length of the segment between the third and fourth Cys residues (18.Wösten H.A.B. de Vries O.M.H. Wessels J.G.H. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 1567-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 33.Scholtmeijer K. Wessels J.G.H. Wosten H.A.B. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 56: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this segment coincides with the first hairpin, which has an essential role in forming the hydrophobic patch. In class I hydrophobins, this segment also contains several conserved aliphatic residues, which would suggest that the loop has similar roles in both classes. In view of published data on some class I hydrophobins, it is a surprising finding that the structure of HFBII is very compact and has a disulfide pairing that does not allow much flexibility in the chain. The previously suggested (and now proved incorrect) disulfide arrangement allowed for hypothe-sizing on significantly more conformational freedom (18.Wösten H.A.B. de Vries O.M.H. Wessels J.G.H. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 1567-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Structural studies on class I hydrophobins such as SC3 and EAS (18.Wösten H.A.B. de Vries O.M.H. Wessels J.G.H. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 1567-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 19.Mackay J.P. Matthews J.M. Winefield R.D. Mackay L.G. Haverkamp R.G.

J. 1998; 74: 2059-2068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) have suggested that an disorder-order transition is involved in the formation of aggregates and films. It has also been proposed that SC3 goes through several conformational stages with varying contents of α-helix and β-sheet that depend on interface and external conditions when it aggregates. The structure does not provide any clues as to how this could occur, except that for reasons discussed above it is likely that any such conformational changes would be restricted to movements in loops. It is interesting that filamentous fungi have, during evolution, produced a surfactant protein that at least structurally, and most likely also in its mechanism, differs from typical surfactants. One consequence seems to be that hydrophobins show more diverse properties, such as tight adhesion, and formation of protection coatings and can, therefore, perform several diverse functions that are important for growth and adaptation to the environment. It is also interesting that fungi often have several genes for hydrophobins and that these are expressed differentially (13.Wösten H.A.B. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 625-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 25.Nakari-Setälä T. Aro N. Ilmen M. Munoz G. Kalkkinen N. Penttilä M. Eur. J.

Biochem. 1996; 235: 248-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). It is clear that these different hydrophobins differ in their physical properties, but so far little progress has been made toward understanding how the fungi utilize the differences in different stages of their life cycle and in response to changes in external conditions. Additionally, it is exciting that the current structure reveals a highly atypical surfactant that can add new knowledge to our understanding of the physical chemistry of surfactants in general. Currently, self-assembly in materials are receiving great attention because of possible use in nanotechnology (36.Lehn J.M. Science. 2002; 295: 2400-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (2074) Google Scholar). This also motivates further study of this protein, because it can clearly be regarded as a self-assembling nanosystem that has acquired extraordinary properties as a material due to specific interactions and self-organization at the nanoscale.

https://openalex.org/W2018631055,"Recent in vivo evidence suggests that Wnt signaling plays a central role in determining the fate of stem cells in the ectoderm and in the neural crest by modulating bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) levels, which, in turn, influence Msx gene expression. However, the molecular mechanism regulating the expression of the Msx genes as key regulators of cell fate has not been elucidated. Here we show in murine embryonic stem cells that BMP-dependent activation of Msx2 is mediated via the cooperative binding of Smad4 at two Smad binding elements and of lymphoid enhancing factor (Lef1) at two Lef1/TCF binding sites. Lef1 can synergize with Smad4 and Smad1 to activate Msx2 promoter, and this transcriptional complex is assembled on the endogenous promoter in response to BMP2. The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway can activate Msx2 via the binding of Lef1 to its promoter and synergizes with BMP2 to activate Msx2 expression, possibly via enhanced recruitment of the p300/cAMP-response element-binding protein-binding protein co-factor. Interestingly, the Wnt/β-catenin-dependent activation of Msx2 was defective in Smad4-deficient embryonic stem cells or when Smad binding elements were mutated but persisted in the presence of various BMP antagonists, indicating that Smad4 was involved in transducing the Wnt/β-catenin signals in the absence of a BMP autocrine loop. A chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that endogenous Smad4, but not Smad1, was part of the Lef1 transcriptional complex in response to β-catenin activation, dismissing any implication of BMP signaling in this response. We propose that Wnt signaling pathway could dictate cell fate not only by modulating BMP levels but also by directly regulating cooperatively BMP-target genes.

This activated receptor complex recruits and phosphorylates receptor Smads (Smad1, Smad5, or Smad8), which, in turn, associate with Smad4. This complex then translocates to the nucleus where it participates in transcriptional regulation. The N-terminal, Mad homology-1 domain of Smad4 binds DNA via a Smad binding element (SBE) identified as AGAC using a random pool of oligonucleotides (3.Zawel L. Dai J.L. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol.

The Smad complex can act either as a co-repressor or co-activator, depending on the co-factor with which it associates. For example, it can recruit the p300/CBP histone acetyltransferase (5.Pouponnot C. Jayaraman L. Massague J. J. Biol.

The C-terminal Mad homology-2 domain of the Smad protein can transactivate transcription and form functional complexes with members of various classes of transcription factors (9.Derynck R. Zhang Y.

Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Of interest, Smad4 was shown to functionally interact with the high mobility group member, lymphoid enhancing factor (Lef1), to regulate the expression of Xtwn in Xenopus (11.Nishita M.

S. A. 2000; 97: 8358-8363Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Lef1 is a transcriptional mediator of the Wnt signaling pathway activated by the binding of β-catenin (13.Miller J.R. Genome Biol. 2002; 3: 3001.1-300115Google Scholar). In unstimulated cells, β-catenin is constantly degraded by ubiquitination via phosphorylation by glucose synthase kinase-3β. Upon Wnt signaling, the constitutive kinase activity of glucose synthase kinase-3β is inhibited and allows the accumulation of β-catenin in the nucleus (14.Wodarz A. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 59-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar). β-Catenin binds and activates Lef1 by recruiting p300/CBP protein to the complex (15.Takemaru K.I. Moon R.T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 16.Hecht A. Vleminckx K. Stemmler M.P. van Roy F. Kemler R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1839-1850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Some of the genes known to be induced by BMP2/4 include the homeobox containing genes Msx-1 and -2 (17.Davidson D. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 405-411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). In chick embryos, BMP2/4 is secreted from the neuroepithelium along the roof of the neural tube (18.Maden M. Graham A. Gale E. Rollinson C. Zile M. Development. 1997; 124: 2799-2805PubMed Google Scholar). Concomitant to the Bmp expression, Msx genes are expressed in the neural crest cells of the dorsal region of the neural tube to the hindbrain (17.Davidson D. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 405-411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 19.Hogan B.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Recent studies in the avian system indicate that Msx2 expression inhibits chondrogenic differentiation of the migratory cranial neural crest cells (20.Takahashi K. Nuckolls G.H. Takahashi I. Nonaka K. Nagata M. Ikura T. Slavkin H.C. Shum L. Dev. Dyn. 2001; 222: 252-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The role of Msx genes in maintaining undifferentiated cells has also been well established in myoblasts (21.Thompson-Jaeger S. Raghow R. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 208: 63-69Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Woloshin P. Song K. Degnin C. Killary A.M. Goldhamer D.J. Sassoon D. Thayer M.J. Cell. 1995; 82: 611-620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and overexpression of Msx-1 in myotube cells triggers their de-differentiation into multipotent stem cells (23.Odelberg S.J. Kollhoff A. Keating M.T. Cell. 2000; 103: 1099-1109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Consistent with their role in modulating cell fate, BMP2/4 are potent neural inhibitors. In Xenopus, the default fate of the ectodermal cells is to acquire a neural phenotype. Secretion of BMP4 from the dorsal neural tube prevents neural determination and allow the cells to take on an epidermal fate (24.Sasai Y. Lu B. Steinbeisser H. De Robertis E.M. Nature. 1995; 376: 333-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). The Msx genes appear to mediate this response, because overexpression of Msx1 in the ectoderm of Xenopus embryos inhibits neural and promotes epidermal differentiation. Similar default mechanisms for neural differentiation is inhibited by BMP/Smad4 signaling in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells (25.Tropepe V. Hitoshi S. Sirard C. Rossant J. Mak W.T. van der Kooy D. Neuron. 2001; 30: 65-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). An additional role of the Msx genes is to mediate BMP-induced apoptosis. In the avian system, increased expression of BMP2/4 in rhombomeres (r) 3 and 5 leads to increased Msx2 expression and to the apoptotic elimination of their neural crests cells (26.Graham A. Francis-West P. Brickell P. Lumsden A. Nature. 1994; 372: 684-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Consequently, misexpression of Msx2 in r2 and r4 leads to apoptosis of its neural crest cells, which would otherwise migrate and contribute to the formation of craniofacial structures (27.Takahashi K. Nuckolls G.H. Tanaka O. Semba I. Takahashi I. Dashner R. Shum L. Slavkin H.C. Development. 1998; 125: 1627-1635PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these results indicate that graded expression of Msx2 can result in different cell fate, emphasizing the importance of tight regulatory mechanisms.Although the Msx genes are sufficient to induce these biological responses, recent studies in avian embryos suggest that it is the Wnt signaling pathway that dictates these BMP-dependent responses. The Wnt-induced neural inhibition is achieved by interfering with fibroblast growth factor-induced inhibition of Bmp4 expression (28.Wilson S.I. Rydstrom A. Trimborn T. Willert K. Nusse R. Jessell T.M. Edlund T. Nature. 2001; 411: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The ectodermal cells close to the region expressing Wnt (lateral zone) take on an epidermal fate whereas the marginal ectoderm, with low Wnt expression, acquire a neural fate. Similarly, exogenous Wnt, but not BMP4, can provoke induction of neural crest cells from the neural plate (29.Garcia-Castro M.I. Marcelle C. Bronner-Fraser M. Science. 2002; 297: 848-851PubMed Google Scholar), and increased levels of Wnt are required for the apoptotic elimination of neural crest cells in r3 and r5 (30.Ellies D.L. Church V. Francis-West P. Lumsden A. Development. 2000; 127: 5285-5295PubMed Google Scholar). In this latter system, Wnt activity is enhanced by decreasing the levels of the Wnt antagonist, cSFRP2, in r3 and r5 relative to the others. Thus, it can be deduced from these studies that the levels of Wnt signaling determines cell fate, in part, by modulating BMP production, which, in turn, could influence the activation of Msx gene expression. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating the graded expression of Msx2 are unclear, because BMP-induced activation of Msx genes appears insufficient to induce most of these biological responses (29.Garcia-Castro M.I. Marcelle C. Bronner-Fraser M. Science. 2002; 297: 848-851PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Ellies D.L. Church V. Francis-West P. Lumsden A. Development. 2000; 127: 5285-5295PubMed Google Scholar).In this study we show that BMP-induced activation of Msx2 is regulated by two canonical SBEs and two Lef1/TCF binding sites. The Smad4/1 co-activators functionally cooperate with the transcription factor Lef1 and together form a complex on the endogenous Msx2 promoter in response to BMP2. Activation of the Wnt pathway induces Msx2 expression via these same Lef1/TCF binding sites, and this response is partially dependent on the presence of Smad4 protein and its ability to form a complex with Lef1, indicating that Smad4 can act as a transcriptional co-activator for Wnt signaling. Thus, Smad4 integrates signals from the Wnt or the BMP pathways either by respectively interacting with the Lef1/β-catenin complex or by recruiting Smad1 to the DNA-bound Lef1. We proposed that in the presence of both signals, the levels or affinity of p300/CBP is enhanced via its independent interaction with β-catenin or Smad1 (7.Feng X.H. Zhang Y. Wu R.Y. Derynck R.

These findings reveal a molecular mechanism explaining how Wnt signaling can act as a determinant factor influencing cell fate by directly modulating the expression of BMP-target genes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Transfections—The wild-type ES cells and Smad4–/– ES cells (clone F9–2A2) (32.Sirard C. de la Pompa J.L.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 107-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar) were maintained on 0.1% gelatin-treated tissue culture dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 0.1 μg/ml leukemia inhibitory factor, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mm l-glutamine, and β-mercaptoethanol (10–4m). All transfections were performed using wild-type ES cells (unless otherwise specified). They were prepared in triplicates in 96-well dishes containing 5000 to 8000 cells seeded the previous day, and LipofectAMINE plus transfection reagent (Invitrogen) was used as recommended by the manufacturers. Equal amounts of DNA (total of 110 ng/well) were co-transfected for all experimental constructs except for Smad1-expressing construct, which was transfected at110 of the total amount of DNA to reduce background activity. All transfections were normalized to Renilla Luciferase (pRL-CMV) expression vector (10 ng) or to protein content measured at A570. The normalized luciferase values were expressed relative to the specified reporter. BMP2 was added at 25 ng/ml the following day of transfection for 10 to 24 h depending on cell density of seeding. All transfections were performed in triplicate and repeated several times. Luciferase assays were carried out using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega).Plasmid Construction—Msx2-lux was derived by cloning a 1.7-kb BamHI genomic fragment ∼3 kb upstream of the transcriptional start site of Msx2, into pGL3-promoter vector (Promega) (33.Sirard C. Kim S. Mirtsos C. Tadich P. Hoodless P.A. Itié A. Maxson R. Wrana J.L. Mak T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2063-2070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Mutations of the Smad and Lef1/TCF binding elements were done by a multi-step PCR system using Msx2-lux as a template. The first PCR reaction generated Fragment A using a common forward primer, 5′-GGAGCGGCCGCAATAAAATA-3′, in combination with one of the following reverse primers: 5′-ACCTCCAACTGGGCgagtAAATCCGAAGGG-3′, 5′-ATCAGAAGCGGGCgagtAAATGGGCGCCA-3′, 5′-CGGTTCTGAACCTTcaTAGACCTGTTCTCA-3′, or 5′-ACTCAACAGTCCTTcaTTCCTGGGCCTCT-3′ containing mutations (lowercase) in potential Smad and Lef1/TCF consensus binding sites at –766, –600, –1210, and –1060, respectively. In the second PCR, a common reverse primer, 5′-AAAAATTAGTCAGCGATGGGGC-3′, was used in conjunction with the reverse complement of the above mentioned primers containing mutations in the SBEs and Lef1/TCF consensus sites to obtain Fragment B. 100 ng of gel-purified Fragments A and B were mixed together and used as template for a third PCR reaction using a second set of nested forward and reverse primers, 5′-CAAGTGCAGGTGCCCGAACATTT-3′ and 5′-GCGGGATCCTGGTTGCTGACTAATTGAG-3′, to amplify 1.7 kb fragment with a terminal BamHI site (underlined) at the 3′ end. The amplified fragment was then subcloned in the MluI and BglII sites of pGL3 promoter and sequenced. The same approach was used to obtain constructs with double mutations using the specified single mutation constructs as templates. cDNA of full-length Smad4 protein was cloned in BamHI sites of pGex-4T2 (Amersham Biosciences).Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR Analysis—ES cells were plated on 10-cm tissue culture dishes (BD Biosciences) at 5 × 105 cells/dish for 24 h. Cells were then starved in serum-free medium for 3–4 h, and RNA was extracted at different time points after addition of BMP2 (25 ng/ml) and 1% fetal bovine serum. Extracted RNA was reverse-transcribed with the Advantage RT-PCR kit (Clontech) and amplified for 30 cycles at an annealing temperature of 58 °C using the following primers (sense:antisense): Msx-2, 5′-CCGGGCCTCTCGTCAAAG-3′:5′-CGCCGTATATGGATGCTGCTT-3′. To control for the amount of RNA in different samples, expression of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase was analyzed using oligonucleotides described elsewhere (33.Sirard C. Kim S. Mirtsos C.

Chem. 2000; 275: 2063-2070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar).Total Cell Extracts and GST Fusion Proteins—Wild-type and Smad4-deficient ES cells were plated on 15-cm tissue culture dishes (BD Biosciences) at 2.5 × 106 cells/dish for 24 h. Cells were then starved in serum-free medium for 3–4 h, and total protein was extracted after addition of BMP2 (25 ng/ml) for 3 h. The cells were homogenized in a buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 25% glycerol, and supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Expression of GST-Smad4 fusion protein was induced in BL21 strain of Escherichia coli by addition of 0.3 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and incubated at 30 °C for 4 h. GST-Smad4 was purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads and following the Amersham Biosciences Bulk-protein purification protocol.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)—Reactions were performed with 1 μg of purified GST-Smad4 or 5 μg of total protein from ES cell extract in a final volume of 50 μl in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2 or 7.5 mm for total protein, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol. Five micrograms of bovine serum albumin was included in the reaction mixture. Proteins from ES cell extracts were preincubated with 1 μg of poly(dI·dC) for 5 min at room temperature, whereas bacterially expressed proteins were preincubated with 50 ng of poly(dI·dC). Double-stranded SBE-600 and SBE-766 probes were generated by EcoRI/XmaI or SacI digestion of Msx2-lux construct, respectively, and double-stranded probe containing both SBEs was generated by Bsu36I/XmaI digestion. The probes were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (50,000 cpm, ∼1 pmol). Upon addition of probes, samples were further incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. For competition assays, 30-fold molar excess of the unlabeled probes were added 10 min prior to the addition of the radiolabeled probe. Samples were loaded on a 4% polyacrylamide gel (80:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide), and complexes were separated at 75 V for 12 h using 24-cm-long glass plates in Tris-glycine high ionic strength buffer. Supershifting of the complex was performed by adding 1 μl of Smad4 polyclonal antibody (33.Sirard C. Kim S. Mirtsos C. Tadich P. Hoodless P.A. Itié A. Maxson R. Wrana J.L. Mak T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2063-2070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) together with the probe. Gels were dried and scanned using a phosphorimager (Bio-Rad).Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Analysis—The ChIP analysis was performed as described elsewhere (34.Boyd K.E. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8393-8399Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The wild-type ES cells were grown in 6-well plates at 1.0 × 105 cells/ well for 24 h and then transfected with equal amounts of either an empty vector (pCDNA3.0) (Invitrogen) or Msx2-lux and ΔN89-β-catenin constructs to give a total of 1 μg of DNA/well. The next day, the cells were treated with BMP2 (25 ng/ml) for 10 h. The cells were then cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 25 min at room temperature, and glycine (125 mm) was added for 10 min at room temperature to quench the formaldehyde. The cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (5 mm PIPES, pH 8.0, 85 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitors) for 30 min on ice. Nuclei were centrifuged (5000 rpm) for 10 min at 4 °C and resuspended in 0.4 ml of nuclear lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, protease inhibitors). 0.1 g of glass beads (212–300 μm; Sigma) was added, and samples were vortexed for 30 min at 4 °C and sonicated four times for 10 s using a Brason 450 Sonifier (output control 5 and 60% duty cycle). The average DNA fragments ranged between 300 and 1000 bp. The lysates were then clarified by centrifugation (13,000 rpm) for 10 min at 4 °C and diluted 5-fold in ChIP dilution buffer (15 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100, 0.01% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, protease inhibitors). The sonicated samples were precleared using Protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C, and 1% of the lysate was used for Input control. Samples were incubated with 5 μg of anti-Lef1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Smad4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-Smad1 (Upstate Biotechnology) or no antibody at 4 °C for 12 h. Immunoprecipitation was carried out using Protein G-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were washed consecutively for 5 min with each of the following solutions: low salt wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl), high salt wash buffer (same as low salt wash solution but 500 mm NaCl), LiCl wash buffer (0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0) and twice with TE. Complexes were then eluted twice at 65 °C for 10 min in elution buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS). Immunoprecipitated DNA was reverse cross-linked at 65 °C overnight and purified using a PCR purification kit (Qiagen). 2 μl of purified DNA from cells transfected with the reporter construct was used for PCR amplification (30 cycles), and 15 μl of purified DNA from non-transfected cells was used and amplified for 55 cycles. All reactions were done under an annealing temperature of 63 °C. The set of primers for amplifying the Lef1/TCF binding sites (292 bp) are as follows: forward, 5′-GAAACCGAGAAGGCAGCAGTGTC-3′; reverse, 5′-CAGTGGAAGTTGAGGGGCAGAAGA-3′; and for the SBEs (301 bp) they are as follows: forward, 5′-CCGAGTATCTACCTAAATTCCCTGCTG-3′; reverse, 5′-TTCCTTCTAATGGGCCGCTTGTT-3′. A sonication control PCR (734 bp) was done using the forward Lef1/TCF primer and the reverse SBE primer.RESULTSIdentification of SBE on the Msx2 Promoter—The ability of BMP2/4 to induce the expression of Msx genes has been established in several biological systems, including the avian and Xenopus embryos. To determine whether BMP2 can induce endogenous expression of Msx2 in murine ES cells, kinetic analyses were performed by RT-PCR. Total RNA was obtained from wild-type ES cells at various time points after BMP2 stimulation. As early as 15 min after the addition of BMP2, expression of Msx2 was induced and reached maximal activation after 4 h (Fig. 1A). This BMP response was preserved in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor, cyclohexamide (Fig. 1B), indicating that Msx2 activation was an immediate early response following BMP2 stimulation. Our previous study demonstrated that a potential enhancer element present in a 1.7-kb fragment of the Msx2 locus, 3 kb upstream of the initiation start site, required Smad4 and synergistically interacted with Smad1 for its activation (33.Sirard C. Kim S. Mirtsos C. Tadich P. Hoodless P.A. Itié A. Maxson R. Wrana J.L. Mak T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2063-2070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of this region revealed two potential SBEs (GTCTG), at –600 and –766 (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, the homology between these two sites extended to seven additional nucleotides (ATTTgtctgCCC) and was similar to functional SBEs found in the several other promoters (35.Jonk L.J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 26584-26590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), suggesting that they could contribute to the efficient binding of Smad proteins. To determine whether these sites played a functional role in the Smad4-dependent activation of Msx2, we performed a PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis of the –600 and –766 CAGA boxes either separately or in combination (Fig. 1C). When transfected into wild-type ES cells, inactivation of either the –600 or the –766 SBE reduced the BMP-dependent activation by 2-fold relative to the wild-type Msx2-lux reporter construct (Fig. 1D). The simultaneous inactivation of both SBEs resulted in a further 2-fold reduction, bringing the luciferase expression to basal levels. These results indicate that both SBEs were required for the transcriptional activation of Msx2. The activation of the wild-type reporter remained relatively elevated at low levels of BMP2 concentrations (0.25 ng/ml) and was not significantly enhanced over a 50-fold increase in BMP2 (Fig. 1D), suggesting that increasing BMP2 levels might not be sufficient to enhance Msx2 expression.Smad4 Specifically Binds Both SBEs—To confirm Smad4 binding to the SBE, an EMSA was performed with 100 bp end-labeled oligonucleotide probes containing either one of the two SBEs (Fig 2A). The band shift was initially performed with recombinant GST-Smad4 fusion protein. A DNA-protein complex was obtained with the radiolabeled Probe A containing the wild-type –600 SBE, but not with the probe containing nucleotide substitutions at the core sequence of the SBE (Fig. 2B, lanes 1–4), indicating that the SBE was responsible for the binding of Smad4. Binding of Smad4 to the radiolabeled wild-type probe was competed with as little as 30-fold molar excess of unlabeled wild-type probe but not with unlabeled probe mutated at the –600 SBE (Fig. 2B, lanes 5–8). These results indicated that Smad4 binding to this SBE was specific. Similar results were obtained for the –766 SBE, whereby the radiolabeled Probe B containing the wild-type SBE, but not the one containing nucleotide substitutions at the SBE, formed a DNA-protein complex with Smad4 protein (Fig. 2B, lanes 9–12). Moreover, competition assays with the unlabeled –766 SBE revealed that only the fragment containing the wild-type SBE, but not the one containing a mutated SBE, could prevent Smad4 protein from binding to the wild-type radiolabeled probe (Fig. 2B, lanes 13–16). These results indicate that Smad4 binds to both SBEs with similar efficiency.Fig. 2Smad4 specifically binds the SBEs on the Msx2 promoter.A, restriction enzyme map of the 1.7-kb distal region of Msx2 promoter used to generate the end-labeled probes for the EMSA. B, intact SBEs are required for Smad4 binding. The indicated end-labeled probes (*) were incubated with (+) or without (–) purified GST-Smad4. Specific DNA-Smad4 complexes are shown by brackets and arrows. The wild-type (WT) radiolabeled probes were able to bind to GST-Smad4 (lanes 2, 6, 10, and 14), whereas those containing mutations in either –600 or –766 SBE did not (lanes 4 and 12). Adding 30-fold molar excess of unlabeled wild-type probe (competition) prevented the assembly of a DNA-Smad4 complex with the wild-type radiolabeled probe (lanes 7 and 15). In contrast, excess of unlabeled mutant probe"

However, only recently has the availability of CL-lacking yeast strains offered a first glimpse into this role. In the absence of CL, coupling between respiration and protonmotive force is impaired, causing reduction of the mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψ) and inhibition of Δψ-dependent functions, such as oxidative phosphorylation and protein import (5Jiang F.

It is not known how the function of CL is related to its unique structure. CL is not only a dimeric phospholipid, it also has an unusual composition of fatty acids (2Daum G. Biochim. Biophys.

Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R465-R466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the abnormal composition of CL may be a direct result of acyltransferase deficiency, and it may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of Barth syndrome. CL species are thought to emerge from remodeling of acyl groups subsequent to de novo formation (23Schlame M. Rüstow B. Biochem.

Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1837-1845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The remodeling idea was suggested by (i) lack of acyl specificity in the de novo pathway (25Hostetler K.Y.

The classical mechanism of phospholipid remodeling is the Lands cycle in which endogenous fatty acids are removed from phospholipids by phospholipase A2 and new fatty acids are re-attached by acyl-CoA:lysophospholipid acyltransferase. This process requires activation of fatty acids by MgATP and CoA. Acyl-CoA:MLCL acyltransferase activity has been identified in liver and heart, but it failed to show the anticipated linoleoyl specificity (24Ma B.J. Taylor W.A. Dolinsky V.W. Hatch G.M. J.

In this paper we report that acyl groups can be transferred directly from phosphatidylcholine (PC) or phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) to CL. This transacylation is linoleoyl-specific in liver and it is deficient in patients with Barth syndrome. Materials—CL from bovine heart, CoA, linoleoyl-CoA, phospholipase A2 from Naja naja venom, and all nucleotides were purchased from Sigma. Tetralinoleoyl-CL (1,3-di[1′,2′-dilinoleoyl-glycero-3′-phosphoryl]-glycerol) was purified from bovine heart CL as described previously (29Schlame M. Haller I. Sammaritano L.R. Blanck T.J.J. Thromb. Haemost. 2001; 86: 1475-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Tetraoleoyl-CL (1,3-di[1′,2′-dioleoyl-glycero-3′-phosphoryl]-glycerol), tetramyristoyl-CL (1,3-di[1′,2′-dimyristoyl-glycero-3′-phosphoryl]-glycerol), MLCL (1-[1′,2′-diacyl-glycero-3′-phosphoryl]-3-[1′-acyl-glycero-3′-phosphoryl]-glycerol), and DLCL (1,3-di[1′-acyl-glycero-3′-phosphoryl]-glycerol) were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipds (Alabaster, AL). Methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate was supplied by Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI). 1-Palmitoyl-2-[1′-14C]linoleoyl-PC (52 Ci/mol), 1-palmitoyl-2-[1′-14C]oleoyl-PC (56 Ci/mol), 1-palmitoyl-2-[1′-14C]linoleoyl-PE (54 Ci/mol), and 1-acyl-2-[1′-14C]arachidonoyl-PE (56 Ci/mol) were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. [1-14C]Linoleic acid (51 Ci/mol) and 1-palmitoyl-2-[1′-14C]arachidonoyl-PC (48 Ci/mol) were obtained from Perkin Elmer (Boston, MA). The scintillation fluid Ecoscint was purchased from National Diagnostics (Atlanta, GA). Rat Liver Mitochondria—Mitochondria were prepared from liver of Sprague-Dawley rats (100-200 g). Animals were housed in the Central Animal Care Facility of New York University Medical Center. Treatment was approved by the institutional animal care and use committee. Rats were anesthetized by pentobarbital injection, and the liver was placed in ice-cold saline. The liver was minced, washed, and homogenized in isolation buffer (150 mm sucrose, 50 mm KCl, 20 mm Hepes, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, at 4 °C), adjusting a ratio of 10 ml/g wet weight. The homogenate was spun at 750 × g for 5 min and the supernatant was spun again at 8,000 × g for 4 min. The mitochondrial pellet was suspended in 50 ml isolation buffer followed by centrifugation at 17,000 × g for 80 s. Mitochondria were resuspended in isolation buffer and spun at 17,000 × g for 10 min. The final pellet was resuspended at a concentration of 50 mg protein per milliliter isolation buffer and stored at -80 °C. Rat liver microsomes were prepared from the first post-mitochondrial supernatant by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 90 min. Protein concentrations of mitochondria and microsomes were determined by the method of Lowry (30Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human Lymphoblast Mitochondria—Lymphoblastoid cell lines were established by Epstein-Barr virus transformation of leukocytes isolated from whole blood of three patients with Barth syndrome and three control subjects. All patients with Barth syndrome had a mutation in the tafazzin gene (G4.5) that resulted in total deletion of the protein. In addition these patients met clinical criteria of Barth syndrome, i.e. they had cardiomyopathy plus two or more of the following non-cardiac symptoms: skeletal myopathy, neutropenia, growth retardation, and increased urinary excretion of 3-methylglutaconic acid. Patients or their guardians gave written informed consent. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Johns Hopkins University. Lymphoblasts were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. Cultures were expanded and 1-2 × 109 cells were harvested in mid-log growth for isolation of mitochondria (31Trounce I.A. Kim Y.L. Jun A.S. Wallace D.C. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 484-508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To this end cells were suspended in 4 ml isolation buffer, containing 210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5% (w/v) fatty-acid free bovine serum albumin, and 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.2. Cells were treated with digitonin until more than 90% of them became permeable to trypan blue (31Trounce I.A. Kim Y.L. Jun A.S. Wallace D.C. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 484-508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Digitonin-treated cells were disrupted in a teflon/glass Dounce homogenizer and un-broken cells were removed by repeated centrifugation at 625 × g for 5 min. Finally mitochondria were spun at 10,000 × g for 20 min and they were re-suspended in isolation medium (protein: 20-40 mg/ml). Incubation of Mitochondria—Mitochondria (1.0-1.5 mg protein) were incubated in 0.3 ml buffer, containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.3, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 4 mm ADP, 33 μm acyl acceptor (CL, MLCL, or DLCL), and 0.1 μCi (6.0-6.9 μm) radioactive acyl donor ([14C]PC or [14C]PE) at 37 °C (shaking water bath). First, organic stock solutions of phospholipids were added and organic solvents were evaporated. Then, aqueous buffer was added and phospholipids were dispersed by sonication in a Branson 8210 sonicator bath for 45 s. The incubation was started by addition of mitochondria and it was stopped by addition of 2 ml methanol. Incubation time was typically 40 min. In some incubations we used other nucleotides (4 mm) or CoA (0.1 mm) instead of ADP. In other incubations we used 15 nCi [14C]linoleic acid as acyl donor. The concentration of some ingredients was varied to determine their apparent Km values. Apparent Km values and their standard errors were estimated by non-linear regression analysis using SigmaPlot (Jandel Corporation). Lipid Analysis—Lipids were extracted by the procedure of Bligh and Dyer (32Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41848) Google Scholar). The extracts were dried under a stream of nitrogen and resuspended in 0.25 ml chloroform/methanol (2:1). Lipids were applied to silica gel 60 plates (Merck TLC plates supplied by Sigma) and separated by two-dimensional thin layer chromatography with chloroform/methanol/water (65:25:4) in the first direction and chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water (50:20:10:10:5) in the second direction. Lipids were stained with iodine. After evaporation of iodine, spots of silica gel were transferred into scintillation vials. Radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting with Ecoscint. All data were expressed as mean ± S.E. Treatment with Phospholipase A2—After incubation of rat liver mitochondria, [14C]CL and [14C]PE were isolated by two-dimensional thin layer chromatography as described above. They were extracted from silica gel into chloroform/methanol (1:1), dried, and re-dissolved in 1 ml of diethylether/ethanol (95:5). An aliquot of 0.5 ml of buffer was added, containing 30 units/ml of phospholipase A2, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, and 2.5 mm CaCl2. The two-phase mixture was stirred over night at room temperature. Lipids were re-extracted (32Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41848) Google Scholar) and separated by one-dimensional thin layer chromatography on silica gel 60 plates, developed with chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water (9:5:2:2:1). The positions of lysophospholipids were identified with the help of standard compounds. The silica gel plates were divided into multiple zones, and radioactivity was measured in each zone by liquid scintillation counting. HPLC of [14C]CL—[14C]CL was isolated from incubation mixtures by two-dimensional chromatography as described above. [14C]CL was dissolved in 0.2 ml methanol and injected into a C18 nucleosil (5 μm) column (3.2 × 250 mm). Gradient elution was performed at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, changing the solvent composition from 10% solvent B to 90% solvent B in 80 min. Solvent A contained methanol, acetonitrile, and 10 mm aqueous phosphate buffer (pH 7.46) at a volume ratio of 3:6:1. Solvent B contained methanol and acetonitrile at a ratio of 2:3. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected into scintillation vials. The solvent was evaporated and radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Retention times of various CL species were determined in separate runs (29Schlame M. Haller I. Sammaritano L.R. Blanck T.J.J. Thromb. Haemost. 2001; 86: 1475-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Analysis of Molecular Species of CL—Lymphoblasts (2-3 mg protein) were extracted with chloroform/methanol (32Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41848) Google Scholar), and CL was converted to 2-(naphthyl-1′-acetyl)-CL dimethyl ester as described before (33Schlame M. Shanske S. Doty S. Konig T. Sculco T. DiMauro S. Blanck T.J.J. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1585-1592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The CL derivative was purified by solid-phase extraction and analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC with fluorescence detection (33Schlame M. Shanske S. Doty S. Konig T. Sculco T. DiMauro S. Blanck T.J.J. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1585-1592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A Hypersil ODS (5 μm) column (150 × 4.6 mm) was used. The flow rate was 2 ml/min. The column was eluted with acetonitrile/2-propanol (8 + 2) for 10 min. After that the concentration of 2-propanol was increased from 20% to 70% within 60 min. Molecular species of cardiolipin were identified by gas-chromatographic analysis of fatty acids (33Schlame M. Shanske S. Doty S. Konig T. Sculco T. DiMauro S. Blanck T.J.J. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1585-1592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transacylation in Rat Liver Mitochondria—Rat liver mitochondria were incubated with [14C]linoleoyl-PC and MLCL. Within 40 min, radioactivity of PC decreased by 7.5 ± 0.2% (n = 3). Of this portion, 50 ± 3% was recovered as free linoleic acid, 31 ± 4% was recovered in CL, 10 ± 1% was recovered in lyso-PC, 6 ± 1% was recovered in PE, and 3 ± 1% was recovered in other phospholipids (n = 3). Incorporation of [14C]linoleoyl groups into CL and PE occurred at a steady rate that was increased by ADP (Fig. 1). To investigate whether liberated [14C]linoleic acid was the source of radioactivity in CL, we added free [14C]linoleic acid to the incubation instead of [14C]linoleoyl-PC. The amount of added [14C]linoleic acid was identical to the amount of [14C]linoleic acid released during incubation with [14C]PC. In the presence of [14C]linoleic acid, incorporation of radioactivity into CL was negligible. In contrast, [14C]linoleoyl-PE was an effective donor of radioactivity to CL (Fig. 2). Acyl transfer from [14C]linoleoyl-PE showed similar dependence on ADP and incubation time as the transfer from [14C]linoleoyl-PC (data not shown). These results suggest that [14C]linoleoyl groups were transferred from either PC or PE to CL by transacylation.Fig. 2Rate of [14C]linoleoyl incorporation into CL in the presence of different [14C]linoleoyl donors. Rat liver mitochondria were incubated with MLCL, ADP, and the indicated [14C]linoleoyl donor for 40 min. Lipids were extracted and separated by two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography. Radioactivity was measured in CL. Data are means ± S.E. of three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We investigated the possibility that the observed transacylation was a result of phospholipase A2 catalysis. Inhibition of phospholipase A2 by 10 μm methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate had no effect on the reaction (activity in the presence of [14C]linoleoyl-PC, MLCL, ADP, and inhibitor was 110 ± 20% of activity without inhibitor), suggesting that neither cytosolic nor Ca2+-independent phospholipases A2 were involved in transacylation. The specific transacylation activity was 3-4 times higher in the mitochondrial preparation than in the microsomal preparation, suggesting a specific localization on mitochondria or mitochondria-associated membranes. We compared the effect of various nucleotides on [14C]linoleoyl transfer. ADP, ATP, and ATPγS stimulated [14C]linoleoyl transfer from PC to CL and from PC to PE, whereas other nucleotides had little or no effect (Fig. 3). Half-maximal stimulation occurred at a concentration of 1.5 ± 1.1 mm ADP. CoA increased [14C]linoleoyl transfer from PC into CL 2.2 ± 0.2-fold (n = 5), and the CoA concentration required for half-maximal effect was 5.8 ± 2.7 μm. However, the effect of CoA disappeared in the presence of ADP, i.e. [14C]linoleoyl transfer with ADP+CoA was 99 ± 9% of the transfer with ADP alone (n = 4). [14C]Linoleoyl transfer from PC to CL was dependent on exogenous MLCL (Fig. 1). When exogenous CL was added instead of MLCL, the same rate of [14C]linoleoyl transfer was measured. The concentration required for half-maximal stimulation was 1.4 ± 0.6 nmol/mg protein for CL and 1.0 ± 0.5 nmol/mg protein for MLCL. In contrast, DLCL was not a substrate of the transacylation (Fig. 4).Fig. 4Effect of exogenous CL, MLCL, and DLCL on [14C]linoleoyl transfer from [14C]linoleoyl-PC to CL. Rat liver mitochondria were incubated with [14C]linoleoyl-PC, ADP, and different concentrations of CL, MLCL, or DLCL. After 40 min, lipids were extracted and separated by two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography. Radioactivity was measured in CL.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Remodeling of CL in Rat Liver Mitochondria—To measure acyl specificity of the transacylation between PC and CL, we incubated rat liver mitochondria with different species of [14C]acyl-PC and different species of CL. [14C]Linoleoyl-PC was an effective acyl donor in the presence of either tetralinoleoyl-CL, tetraoleoyl-CL, or tetramyristoyl-CL. In contrast, neither [14C]oleoyl-PC nor [14C]arachidonoyl-PC participated in the transacylation regardless of the acyl acceptor (Fig. 5). Acyl transfer from PE to CL also favored linoleoyl groups, albeit the specificity was lower; i.e. transacylation from [14C]linoleoyl-PE to CL was only 4.6 ± 1.3-fold faster than from [14C]arachidonoyl-PE to CL (n = 3). Incubation of liver mitochondria with [14C]linoleoyl-PC and tetraoleoyl-CL (O4) led to complete remodeling, generating the end product tetralinoleoyl-CL (L4) as well as the intermediates LO3, L2O2, and L3O, all of which were identified by high-performance liquid chromatography (Fig. 6). Although ultimately all acyl positions of CL were accessible to transacylation, sn-2 positions turned over faster than sn-1 positions. This was suggested by treatment of isolated [14C]CL with phospholipase A2, releasing 76 ± 4% of radioactivity as linoleic acid (representing sn-2 bound residues), 15 ± 3% as DLCL (representing sn-1 bound residues), and 9 ± 1% as MLCL (n = 3). The data are consistent with the following remodeling pathway: O4 → 2-L-1,1′,2′-O3 → 2,2′-L2-1,1′-O2 → 1,2,2′-L3-1′-O → L4. Likewise, phospholipase A2 released 88 ± 2% of radioactivity as linoleic acid from the sn-2 position of [14C]PE (n = 3). Transacylation in Human Lymphoblast Mitochondria—We measured phospholipid transacylation in mitochondria from human lymphoblast cell lines. Transacylation was measured with [14C]oleoyl-PC because oleic acid was the most abundant residue in PC, CL, and PE of lymphoblasts. Like in liver, transacylase activity was stimulated by ADP and it was independent of CoA in the presence of ADP (data not shown). In lymphoblasts with tafazzin deficiency, derived from patients with Barth syndrome, [14C]oleoyl transfer from PC to CL and to PE was significantly reduced (Fig. 7, lower panel). At the same time there were drastic changes in the molecular composition of CL in tafazzin-deficient lymphoblasts; i.e. the four characteristic CL species of normal lymphoblasts, containing primarily oleic and palmitoleic acid, were replaced by multiple molecular species representing a more diverse fatty acid pattern (Fig. 7, upper panel). We demonstrated formation of tetralinoleoyl-CL by linoleoyl-specific phospholipid transacylation in rat liver mitochondria. Linoleoyl groups were transferred directly from PC or PE, because (i) free linoleic acid was not incorporated into CL under conditions that allowed incorporation of phospholipid-bound linoleoyl residues (Fig. 2), and (ii) linoleoyl transfer did not require MgATP/CoA (Figs. 1 and 3). The notion of a transacylation contradicts our previous conclusion that CL is remodeled with CoA activated fatty acids (23Schlame M. Rüstow B. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). On the one hand the present data confirmed that ATP and CoA stimulated [14C]CL formation, on the other hand we found that neither component was absolutely necessary for [14C]linoleoyl transfer from PC to CL. ATP had no greater effect than ADP or ATPγS, and CoA did not stimulate linoleoyl transfer in the presence of adenine nucleotides. However, ATP may be the physiological effector of the transacylation because it required adenine nucleotide concentrations above 2 mm for full activity. Transacylation also occurred between PC and PE, suggesting that all three major mitochondrial phospholipids can exchange acyl groups by this mechanism. We found a similar transacylase reaction in human lymphoblast mitochondria. The transacylase activity was decreased in lymphoblasts with tafazzin deletion (Fig. 7), suggesting that tafazzin plays a role in the transacylation mechanism. Tafazzin deletion also resulted in altered composition of CL, suggesting that tafazzin is involved in CL remodeling (Fig. 7). Tafazzin was predicted to be an acyltransferase based on its amino acid sequence (22Neuwald A.F. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R465-R466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several splice variants of tafazzin exist and the splicing pattern is characteristic for cell type and tissue (21Bione S. D'Adamo P. Maestrini E. Gedeon A.K. Bolhuis P.A. Toniolo D. Nat. Gen. 1996; 12: 385-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). It was suggested that tafazzin splicing may confer acyl specificity (22Neuwald A.F. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R465-R466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Acyl specificity of the transacylation corresponded to the molecular composition of CL in liver and lymphoblasts, respectively. In liver where CL was rich in linoleic acid, we found strict linoleoyl-specificity of the transacylation. No such specificity was observed in lymphoblasts where CL contained mostly oleic and palmitoleic acid. Overall the present data supported the notion that phospholipid transacylation is the underlying mechanism of CL remodeling. The data also suggested that CL was not released from the transacylase until remodeling was nearly complete. This is because more than 80% of the remodeling products in liver were tetralinoleoyl-CL and trilinoleoyl-oleoyl-CL (Fig. 6), a result that cannot be achieved by single acyl exchange with exogenous tetraoleoyl-CL. CL and MLCL had equal effect on the transacylation (Fig. 4), suggesting that both substrates readily exchanged acyl groups with the putative acyl∼enzyme (acyl∼E) intermediate. Thus we propose the presence of an active complex acyl∼E∼MLCL, that is in equilibrium with E∼CL via intramolecular acyl transfer (Fig. 8). This complex may exchange acyl groups with other lipids by transacylation until the desired molecular species of CL emerge. Inflow of acyl groups into the complex may show tissue-specific acyl selectivity. In contrast, outflow of acyl groups is non-selective because different species of CL are equally good substrates of the acyl exchange (Fig. 5). Specific fatty acids may accumulate in CL by concerted action of acyl-specific inflow and nonspecific outflow. Potentially more than one transacylase is involved in this mechanism. Transacylases have been shown to be acyl-specific in various tissues (34Yamashita A. Sugiura T. Waku K. J. Biochem. 1997; 122: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). In contrast, acyl-CoA-dependent acyltransferases only distinguish between saturated and unsaturated fatty acids (34Yamashita A. Sugiura T. Waku K. J. Biochem. 1997; 122: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 35MacDonald J.I.S. Sprecher H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1084: 105-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). This is also true for purified MLCL:acyl-CoA acyltransferase from liver mitochondria (28Taylor W.A. Hatch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12716-12721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Although this enzyme cannot provide specific incorporation of linoleoyl groups into CL, it may still be involved in the remodeling process. For instance it may transfer acyl groups out of CL to CoA or other acyl acceptors."

However, the way in which PI3K/Akt controls androgen receptor (AR)-mediated prostate cancer cell growth remains unclear and controversial. Here, we demonstrate that the PI3K/Akt pathway regulates AR activity in a cell passage number-dependent manner. Specifically, PI3K/Akt pathway can suppress AR activity in androgen-dependent LNCaP cells with low passage numbers. In contrast, it can also enhance AR activity in LNCaP cells with high passage numbers. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that insulin-like growth factor-1 can activate the PI3K/Akt pathway that results in the phosphorylation of AR at Ser210 and Ser790. The consequence of these events may then change the stability of AR protein. Together, our results demonstrate that the PI3K/Akt pathway may have distinct mechanisms to modulate AR functions in various stages of prostate cancer cells and that a combined therapy of antiandrogens and anti-PI3K/Akt inhibitors may be worth considering as a future therapeutic approach to battle prostate cancer.

Furthermore, activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway protects cells from apoptosis induced by serum starvation and androgen deprivation (2Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C.

Recent rapid progress of the PI3K/Akt signal pathway studies, as well as its influence on the androgen receptor (AR)-mediated prostate cancer growth, has resulted in many exciting yet controversial results. Here we address these controversial results by summarizing Akt-AR-related results and provide new data, as well as possible explanations for the distinct roles of the PI3K/Akt pathway in AR-mediated prostate cancer growth. Particular emphases will be: 1) Akt suppresses versus induces AR activity, 2) Akt phosphorylation sites on AR protein, and 3) promotion of AR degradation by the PI3K/Akt pathway.

The mouse monoclonal PTEN and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) antibodies and the goat polyclonal β-actin antibody were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The mouse monoclonal Akt and phospho-Akt (Ser473) antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling. Cell Culture and Transfections—DU145, PC-3, and COS-1 cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium containing penicillin (25 units/ml), streptomycin (25 μg/ml), and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). LNCaP cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 with 10% FCS. Transfections were performed using SuperFect™ according to standard procedures (Qiagen). Luciferase Reporter Assays—Luciferase reporter assay was as described previously with some modifications (5Hu Y.C. Shyr C.R. Che W. Mu X.M. Kim E. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33571-33579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The cells were transfected with plasmids in 10% charcoal-stripped serum (CSS) medium for 16 h and then treated with ethanol or 10 nm DHT for 16 h.

Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting were performed as previously described (3Lin H.K. Yeh S. Kang H.Y. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The immunocomplexes were subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with the indicated antibody. Cell Growth Assay—LNCaP cells (2 × 104) with different passage numbers were grown in 12-well plates, transfected with parent vector or the constitutively active form of Akt (cAkt), and cultured in 10% CSS medium after 3 h of transfection. Cells were stained by trypan blue on different days, as indicated, and cell numbers were determined by direct counting on hemacytometers. The data represent means ± S.D. from triplicate sets of three independent experiments. Cell-specific and Passage-dependent Effect of PI3K/Akt Signaling on AR Activity—The PI3K/Akt pathway plays an important role in cell growth, survival, adhesion, and migration in a variety of cell types. In prostate cancer LNCaP cells, the PI3K/Akt pathway is a dominant survival signal pathway for cells, and inhibition of this pathway by PI3K inhibitors leads to cell growth arrest and apoptosis (6Lin J. Adam R.M. Santiestevan E. Freeman M.R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2891-2897PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it has been demonstrated that the PI3K/Akt pathway regulates AR activity and phosphorylation (3Lin H.K. Yeh S. Kang H.Y. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7200-7205Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 7Wen Y. Hu M.C. Makino K. Spohn B. Bartholomeusz G. Yan D.H. Hung M.C. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6841-6845PubMed Google Scholar). Although activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway suppresses AR activity in androgen-independent prostate cancer DU145 cells (3Lin H.K. Yeh S. Kang H.Y. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7200-7205Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), other reports also demonstrated that the PI3K/Akt pathway enhances AR activity in androgen-dependent prostate cancer LNCaP cells (7Wen Y. Hu M.C. Makino K. Spohn B. Bartholomeusz G. Yan D.H. Hung M.C. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6841-6845PubMed Google Scholar, 8Li P. Nicosia S.V. Bai W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20444-20450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Although the detailed mechanisms of these differential effects remain unclear, it is possible that different cell types may have differential PI3K/Akt effects on AR activity, which led to our examination of various prostate cancer cells. Interestingly, we found that the PI3K/Akt pathway could regulate AR activity in a passage-dependent manner in LNCaP cells. cAkt suppressed AR activity in low passage number LNCaP cells (passage number 25) (Fig. 1A, P25) but enhanced AR activity in high passage number LNCaP cells (Fig. 1B, P60), in reporter gene assays. It should be noted that the reporter gene activation by androgen was much higher in higher passage LNCaP cells (Fig. 1, compare panel B with A). The reason for this phenomenon is currently unknown. This may suggest that some factors that preferentially exist or are over-expressed in higher passage LNCaP cells may contribute to the enhancement of this androgen response. Blockage of the PI3K/Akt pathway by LY294002 slightly enhanced AR activity in low passage number LNCaP cells but suppressed AR activity in high passage number LNCaP cells (Fig. 1, A and B, 4th lanes on right). Although LY294002 has been widely used as a PI3K inhibitor, we cannot rule out the possibility that at 20 μm this reagent may affect other kinases that influence AR activity. We performed a Western blot assay to examine the role of the PI3K/Akt pathway in regulating AR target gene expression. Even though LY294002 only marginally enhanced AR activity in low passage LNCaP cells in the reporter gene assays (Fig. 1A), it apparently increased androgen-induced PSA expression, an AR target gene, in low passage number LNCaP cells (Fig. 1C). Similar to the reporter gene assay, LY294002 suppressed PSA expression in high passage number LNCaP cells (Fig. 1C). Moreover, cAkt reduced androgen-induced PSA expression in low passage number LNCaP cells but slightly enhanced PSA expression in high passage number LNCaP cells (Fig. 1D). These results suggest that distinct passage numbers of LNCaP cells might influence the effects of the PI3K/Akt effect on AR activity. Using PC-3 cells, Thompson et al. (9Thompson J. Koskinen P.J. Janne O.A. Palvimo J.J. The Endocrine Society's 84th Annual Meeting, San Francisco, June 19-22, 2002. Endocrine Society Press, Bethesda, MD2002: 526Google Scholar) also demonstrated that the PI3K/Akt pathway could suppress AR activity, which is consistent with our data (Fig. 1A) and with early reports using DU145 cells as the cell model (3Lin H.K. Yeh S. Kang H.Y. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7200-7205Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Together, these results demonstrate that the effects of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway on AR activity may change with different prostate cancer cell lines and within the same cell line at different passage numbers. At early stages, prostate cancer cells may need androgen signaling for growth and survival. Androgen ablation or anti-androgen treatment may lead to cell growth arrest and apoptosis of these androgen-sensitive cancer cells (1Carson J.P. Kulik G. Weber M.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1449-1453PubMed Google Scholar). The basal activity of the PI3K/Akt pathway in the early stage prostate tumors is lower and may not be adequate to play a major role in the maintenance of prostate cancer cell growth and survival in the absence of concurrent androgen signaling. However, androgens may become less important factors for tumor cell growth and survival in late stage prostate cancer. In contrast, tumor cells at this later stage have higher basal activity of the PI3K/Akt pathway, which may contribute to the development of prostate cancer progression by preventing cells from apoptosis (10Graff J.R. Konicek B.W. McNulty A.M. Wang Z. Houck K. Allen S. Paul J.D. Hbaiu A. Goode R.G. Sandusky G.E. Vessella R.L. Neubauer B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24500-24505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). To support the above hypothesis, we found that the low passage LNCaP cells possess a low basal level of Akt activity (Fig. 1E). In contrast, high passage LNCaP cells show a strong basal Akt activity (Fig. 1E). Our data show that Akt negatively modulates AR activity in low passage LNCaP cells (Fig. 1A), suggesting that LNCaP cells at this early stage require more androgen to compensate for the suppressive effect of the low basal Akt activity and that the low basal Akt activity may not be sufficient to provide the survival signal necessary for maintenance of cell growth and survival. To determine whether Akt is a determining factor for the androgen reliance of LNCaP cell growth, we cultured LNCaP cells in CSS medium lacking androgen to compare the growth pattern of LNCaP cells at different passage numbers in the presence or absence of cAkt. As expected, early passage LNCaP cells, with low basal activity of Akt, showed little cell growth in the CSS medium (Fig. 1F), suggesting that the androgens are important for cell growth. In contrast, high passage LNCaP cells, with higher basal Akt activity, grew much faster than early passage LNCaP cells (Fig. 1F), suggesting less dependence on the androgens. Elevation of the basal Akt activity by transfection of cAkt significantly increased the LNCaP cell growth at both cell passages, although the effect of cAkt was more profound in the early passage LNCaP cells (Fig. 1F). Thus, the Akt signal may be a key factor in driving LNCaP cell growth and survival at this late stage with weaker androgen reliance. Considering the biphasic effect of PI3K/Akt and androgen signaling on the progression of prostate cancer, we found that androgen ablation therapy, which removes most of the androgens available for prostate tumors, may result in increased activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, promoting tumor cell growth and survival. This hypothesis is further supported by a recent report (11Murillo H. Huang H. Schmidt L.J. Smith D.I. Tindall D.J. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 4795-4805Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) showing that the PI3K/Akt pathway is elevated in LNCaP cells cultured in androgen-depleted medium. It is possible that increased PI3K/Akt signaling upon loss of androgen signaling may contribute to the failure of androgen ablation therapy at later stages of prostate cancer. For this reason, using a combination therapy that includes androgen ablation at early stages and suppression of the PI3K/Akt pathway at later stages may provide a better strategy for battling prostate cancer. The Effect of PI3K/Akt Signaling on AR Phosphorylation—AR is a phosphoprotein, and its activity can be modulated by phosphorylation (12Heinlein C.A. Chang C. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 175-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that activation of PI3K/Akt pathways by IGF-1 in COS-1 cells induces AR phosphorylation in vivo (3Lin H.K. Yeh S. Kang H.Y. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7200-7205Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The in vitro kinase assay further revealed that Akt, but not PI3K, phosphorylates AR at Ser210 and Ser790 residues, which are the Akt consensus phosphorylation sites (3Lin H.K. Yeh S. Kang H.Y. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7200-7205Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Overexpression of cAkt, but not the kinase-dead Akt mutant (dAkt), induced AR phosphorylation in vivo, and mutations at the consensus serine residues reduced Akt-mediated AR phosphorylation (3Lin H.K. Yeh S. Kang H.Y. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7200-7205Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Consistent with our results, Wen et al. (7Wen Y. Hu M.C. Makino K. Spohn B. Bartholomeusz G. Yan D.H. Hung M.C. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6841-6845PubMed Google Scholar) also found that Akt associated with AR and phosphorylated AR at Ser210 and Ser790in vitro. We and others (3Lin H.K. Yeh S. Kang H.Y. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7200-7205Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 7Wen Y. Hu M.C. Makino K. Spohn B. Bartholomeusz G. Yan D.H. Hung M.C. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6841-6845PubMed Google Scholar) and have found that Akt can phosphorylate AR at Ser210 and Ser790. However, Gioeli et al. (13Gioeli D. Ficarro S.B. Kwiek J.J. Aaronson D. Hancock M. Catling A.D. White F.M. Christian R.E. Settlage R.E. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Weber M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29304-29314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) found that Akt fails to phosphorylate AR at Ser210 and Ser790 in LNCaP cells. They also found that PI3K inhibitor LY294002 did not change the levels of AR phosphorylation in a two-dimensional gel electrophoresis assay (13Gioeli D. Ficarro S.B. Kwiek J.J. Aaronson D. Hancock M. Catling A.D. White F.M. Christian R.E. Settlage R.E. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Weber M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29304-29314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). These contrasting results may be because of the use of different cell lines (COS-1 versus LNCaP cells) to test AR phosphorylation under various transfection and treatment conditions. Alternatively, another explanation for the discrepancy may be that the overexpression of Akt via transient transfection may produce protein levels that are far higher than that seen under physiological conditions. To determine whether gene overexpression was a confounding factor in the interpretation of our AR phosphorylation assays, we used IGF-1 to activate endogenous PI3K/Akt and therefore mimic physiological conditions. As shown in Fig. 2A, we demonstrated that IGF-1 treatment induced AR phosphorylation in LNCaP cells (passage number 38), and adding the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 blocked IGF-1-mediated AR phosphorylation, suggesting that the PI3K/Akt pathway is involved in the phosphorylation of AR. Using a site-specific anti-phosphoserine AR antibody, AR phosphorylation at Ser210 was detected when LNCaP cells were treated with IGF-1 (Fig. 2B). Moreover, using the Dox-inducible system we generated the inducible PTEN clone, a tumor suppressor that antagonizes the PI3K/Akt pathway (14Di Cristofano A. Pandolfi P.P. Cell. 2000; 100: 387-390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar), in LNCaP cells at passage number 40. PTEN expression induced by Dox treatment inhibited Akt activation and AR phosphorylation at Ser210 (Fig. 2C). IGF-1 also induced wild-type AR phosphorylation in COS-1 cells (Fig. 2D, wtAR), and LY294002 blocked the IGF-1-mediated phosphorylation. In contrast, IGF-1 did not induce phosphorylation of the mutant AR (S210A/S790A), in which two Akt consensus sites were mutated from Ser to Ala (Fig. 2D, mtAR). These data therefore strongly support our early findings that the PI3K/Akt pathway activated by IGF-1 mediates AR phosphorylation at Ser210 and Ser790 (3Lin H.K. Yeh S. Kang H.Y. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7200-7205Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). In contrast, Gioeli et al. (13Gioeli D. Ficarro S.B. Kwiek J.J. Aaronson D. Hancock M. Catling A.D. White F.M. Christian R.E. Settlage R.E. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Weber M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29304-29314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) did not add growth factors such as IGF-1 to activate the PI3K/Akt pathway. It is therefore possible that the level of the Akt activity in LNCaP cells may not be sufficient to induce AR activity, given that the basal level of Akt activity is low in early passage LNCaP cells (Fig. 1E) in which AR phosphorylation by Akt may not occur and may require the addition of growth factors to amplify the PI3K/Akt signal. Regulation of AR Protein Turnover by the PI3K/Akt Pathway—AR controls several biological functions, including prostate cell growth and apoptosis (12Heinlein C.A. Chang C. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 175-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which AR maintains its stability for proper function remains largely unknown. Growing evidence implies that AR may be degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (15Yeh S. Hu Y.C. Rahman M. Lin H.K. Hsu C.L. Ting H.J. Kang H.Y. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11256-11261Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 16Poukka H. Karvonen U. Yoshikawa N. Tanaka H. Palvimo J.J. Janne O.A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2991-3001Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Sheflin L. Keegan B. Zhang W. Spaulding S.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 144-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In support of this notion, we have recently demonstrated that activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway induces AR ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation by the 26 S proteasome (4Lin H.K. Wang L. Hu Y.C. Altuwaijri S. Chang C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4037-4048Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The effect of Akt on AR ubiquitylation and degradation seems to be dependent on AR phosphorylation, because activation of Akt did not induce ubiquitylation or degradation of mutant AR, which lacks Akt-mediated phosphorylation. Interestingly, the AR mutant was remarkably stable compared with wild-type AR, suggesting that phosphorylation of AR by Akt reduces AR stability (4Lin H.K. Wang L. Hu Y.C. Altuwaijri S. Chang C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4037-4048Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Mdm2, a Ring Finger protein, consists of an E3 ligase and suppresses p53 activity by regulation of ubiquitylation and degradation of p53 (18Honda R. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar, 19Fang S. Jensen J.P. Ludwig R.L. Vousden K.H. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8945-8951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). In addition to regulation of p53 function, Mdm2 can also regulate AR activity via regulation of ubiquitylation and degradation of the AR (4Lin H.K. Wang L. Hu Y.C. Altuwaijri S. Chang C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4037-4048Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). We further identified Mdm2 as an E3 ligase for AR and a mediator for Akt-induced AR ubiquitylation and degradation (4Lin H.K. Wang L. Hu Y.C. Altuwaijri S. Chang C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4037-4048Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). AR protein normally undergoes degradation several hours after its synthesis in cells. However, the signals responsible for AR turnover remain unclear. Based on our data, we propose that the PI3K/Akt/Mdm2 pathway represents an important mechanism to control AR turnover rate. When LNCaP cells are cultured in normal medium, growth factors such as IGF-1 can activate the PI3K/Akt pathway, which may then be responsible for the turnover of AR protein. In support of this hypothesis, blockage of the PI3K/Akt pathway by LY294002 in LNCaP cells leads to increased AR protein levels (4Lin H.K. Wang L. Hu Y.C. Altuwaijri S. Chang C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4037-4048Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Because the PI3K/Akt pathway differentially regulates AR activity in different passage numbers of LNCaP cells (Fig. 1, A-D), we next determined whether the PI3K/Akt pathway has a distinct effect on AR degradation in these cells. cAkt down-regulated AR protein levels in low passage LNCaP but slightly enhanced AR protein levels in high passage LNCaP cells (Fig. 3A). In contrast, LY294002 enhanced AR protein levels in low passage LNCaP cells but slightly reduced AR protein levels in high passage LNCaP cells (Fig. 3B). To prove the role of Akt in regulation of AR degradation directly, we examined the effect of Akt on AR protein stability. Overexpression of cAkt in low passage LNCaP cells led to accelerated AR degradation (Fig. 3C, left panel). cAkt did not promote AR degradation in high passage LNCaP cells but slightly enhanced AR stability (Fig. 3C, right panel), which indeed correlated with the effect of PI3K/Akt on AR transcriptional activity in Fig. 1, A-D, and AR protein levels in Fig. 3, A and B. These results suggest that the PI3K/Akt pathway induces AR degradation in low passage LNCaP cells but not in high passage LNCaP cells. Exactly how the cell passage number affects PI3K/Akt modulation of AR activity remains unclear. However, it is possible that the variant basal Akt activity levels among cells of different passages may be a key factor contributing to this phenomenon. Alternatively, different cell contexts may exist in LNCaP cells of different passage numbers contributing to the modulating effect of the PI3K/Akt pathway on AR activity. Because Mdm2 is a downstream effector of the PI3K/Akt pathway, it would be useful to determine whether the levels of Mdm2 in various passage numbers of LNCaP cells are significantly different. A more global assay, such as proteomics, may be required to elucidate the factors that may contribute to this phenomenon. Summary—On the basis of this study and our previous reports (3Lin H.K. Yeh S. Kang H.Y. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7200-7205Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 4Lin H.K. Wang L. Hu Y.C. Altuwaijri S. Chang C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4037-4048Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) we propose a model for the PI3K/Akt pathway action on the regulation of AR activity in prostate cancer LNCaP cells (Fig. 4). The PI3K/Akt pathway exhibits a cell passage-dependent regulation of AR activity. In low passage LNCaP cells, the basal activity of PI3K/Akt signaling is low and cells are strongly dependent on androgen signaling for growth and survival. However, in high passage LNCaP cells, the basal activity of the PI3K/Akt pathway is high and cells are less dependent on androgen signaling. The PI3K/Akt pathway not only provides the growth and survival signals for prostate cancer cells, but it also enhances AR activity in high passage LNCaP cells via an unknown mechanism. Several important questions have been raised throughout this study. First, what are the factors that determine the differential effects of the PI3K/Akt pathway on AR activity in different passage numbers of LNCaP cells? Second, what is the molecular mechanism by which the PI3K/Akt pathway enhances AR activity in the high passage LNCaP cells? Future studies should focus on these issues, and systematic analysis is required to solve these puzzles. Finally, the PI3K/Akt pathway provides a survival and growth signal for prostate cancer cells and induces AR activation in the presence or absence of androgen. Given its activation during prostate cancer progression, PI3K/Akt signaling may represent a new chemotherapeutic target with the potential to be particularly effective. A therapy that suppresses the PI3K/Akt pathway combined with classic androgen ablation therapy could reach the maximal effect in the battle against prostate cancer. We thank Drs. Charles L.

A growth-defective mutant, in which the gene for this RLP had been disrupted, was rescued by the gene for RuBisCOfrom the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodospirillum rubrum.

https://openalex.org/W2048457947,"ATPase activity associated with P-glycoprotein (Pgp) is characterized by three drug-dependent phases: basal (no drug), drug-activated, and drug-inhibited. To understand the communication between drug-binding sites and ATP hydrolytic sites, we performed steady-state thermodynamic analyses of ATP hydrolysis in the presence and absence of transport substrates. We used purified human Pgp (ABCB1, MDR1) expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Figler, R. A., Omote, H., Nakamoto, R. K., and Al-Shawi, M. K. (2000) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 376, 34–46) as well as Chinese hamster Pgp (PGP1). Between 23 and 35 °C, we obtained linear Arrhenius relationships for the turnover rate of hydrolysis of saturating MgATP in the presence of saturating drug concentrations (kcat), from which we calculated the intrinsic enthalpic, entropic, and free energy terms for the rate-limiting transition states. Linearity of the Arrhenius plots indicated that the same rate-limiting step was being measured over the temperature range employed. Using linear free energy analysis, two distinct transition states were found: one associated with uncoupled basal activity and the other with coupled drug transport activity. We concluded that basal ATPase activity associated with Pgp is not a consequence of transport of an endogenous lipid or other endogenous substrates. Rather, it is an intrinsic mechanistic property of the enzyme. We also found that rapidly transported substrates bound tighter to the transition state and required fewer conformational alterations by the enzyme to achieve the coupling transition state. The overall rate-limiting step of Pgp during transport is a carrier reorientation step. Furthermore, Pgp is optimized to transport drugs out of cells at high rates at the expense of coupling efficiency. The drug inhibition phase was associated with low affinity drug-binding sites. These results are consistent with an expanded version of the alternating catalytic site drug transport model (Senior, A. E., Al-Shawi, M. K., and Urbatsch, I. L. (1995) FEBS Lett. 377, 285–289). A new kinetic model of drug transport is presented. ATPase activity associated with P-glycoprotein (Pgp) is characterized by three drug-dependent phases: basal (no drug), drug-activated, and drug-inhibited. To understand the communication between drug-binding sites and ATP hydrolytic sites, we performed steady-state thermodynamic analyses of ATP hydrolysis in the presence and absence of transport substrates. We used purified human Pgp (ABCB1, MDR1) expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Figler, R. A., Omote, H., Nakamoto, R. K., and Al-Shawi, M. K. (2000) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 376, 34–46) as well as Chinese hamster Pgp (PGP1). Between 23 and 35 °C, we obtained linear Arrhenius relationships for the turnover rate of hydrolysis of saturating MgATP in the presence of saturating drug concentrations (kcat), from which we calculated the intrinsic enthalpic, entropic, and free energy terms for the rate-limiting transition states.

A new kinetic model of drug transport is presented. Human P-glycoprotein (Pgp), 1The abbreviations used are: PgpP-glycoproteinSL-verapamilspin-labeled verapamil. which interacts with a structurally diverse set of cytotoxic agents, is a very broad specificity drug pump, located at the plasma membrane of cells. Due to its central role in compromising cancer chemotherapy and in modulating the bioavailability and distribution of therapeutic agents, Pgp is of great clinical importance (1Ambudkar S.V. Dey S.

Biomembr. 2001; 33: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Pgp is a member of the ATP-binding cassette superfamily of transport proteins (3Hyde S.C. Emsley P. Hartshorn M.J.

It consists of two homologous domains; each domain has six transmembrane helices and an ATP site. Additionally, each domain is thought to have a structure similar to the solved x-ray structure of the homologous Escherichia coli MsbA lipid A transporter monomer (6Chang G. Roth C.B. Science. 2001; 293: 1793-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Photolabeling and genetic studies have indicated that drug-binding sites are located in the transmembrane region (reviewed in Ref 1Ambudkar S.V. Dey S. Hrycyna C.A. Ramachandra M. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 361-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1924) Google Scholar). Binding of drugs stimulates ATP hydrolysis at the two nucleotide sites in an alternating fashion, leading to drug transport (7Senior A.E. Al-Shawi M.K. Urbatsch I.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). One confounding factor in the analysis of drug transport by Pgp is the presence of basal ATPase in the absence of any added transport substrates (8Al-Shawi M.K. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4197-4206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Urbatsch I.L. Al-Shawi M.K. Senior A.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7069-7076Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). This has usually been ascribed to the presence of an unidentified endogenous transport substrate or to lipids being flipped in purified preparations (10Borgnia M.J. Eytan G.D. Assaraf Y.G. J. Biol.

Recently, cholesterol was proposed as the transport substrate leading to basal ATPase (13Garrigues A. Escargueil A.E. Orlowski S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To probe this coupling of drug transport to ATP hydrolysis, we measured the thermodynamics of the overall rate-limiting transition state, which appeared to be related to a conformational change step. This analysis was performed as a function of ATP and transport drugs using purified yeast-expressed human Pgp (21Figler R.A. Omote H. Nakamoto R.K. Al-Shawi M.K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 376: 34-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and Chinese hamster Pgp (22Senior A.E. Al-Shawi M.K. Urbatsch I.L. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 292: 514-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The availability of these transport-competent (23Omote H. Al-Shawi M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45688-45694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), homogeneous, and high specific activity preparations allows this analysis to be performed. Previously, we had developed the thermodynamic methods employed here to study rotational coupling of ATP synthesis/hydrolysis to the movement of protons in the F0F1-ATP synthase (reviewed in Ref. 24Nakamoto R.K. Ketchum C.J. Al-Shawi M.K. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1999; 28: 205-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In this study, we present a detailed thermodynamic description of the coupling transition state and use this information to refine our model of drug transport by Pgp (7Senior A.E. Al-Shawi M.K. Urbatsch I.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Sources of Pgp Used—C-terminal His10-tagged wild-type human Pgp (ABCB1, MDR1 gene product) was expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae plasma membranes in the presence of 10% glycerol as a chemical chaperone from the yeast expression plasmid YEpMDR1HIS. Microsomes were prepared, and Pgp was solubilized and purified to homogeneity as described previously (21Figler R.A. Omote H. Nakamoto R.K. Al-Shawi M.K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 376: 34-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Proteoliposomes were made by dialysis as described previously (9Urbatsch I.L. Al-Shawi M.K. Senior A.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7069-7076Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) and stored frozen at -80 °C in 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EGTA, and 5 mm 6-aminohexanoic acid. Chinese hamster ovary Pgp (pgp1 gene product) was expressed in Chinese hamster ovary CR1R12 cells grown in suspension culture. Plasma membranes were prepared from the harvested cells as described previously (8Al-Shawi M.K. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4197-4206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The membranes were solubilized, and Pgp was purified as described previously (22Senior A.E. Al-Shawi M.K. Urbatsch I.L. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 292: 514-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Proteoliposomes were made as described above. Lipid stocks were prepared as described previously (21Figler R.A. Omote H. Nakamoto R.K. Al-Shawi M.K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 376: 34-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and stored at -80 °C under argon. In this study, two lipid preparations were used: E. coli ether/acetone-precipitated lipids (E. coli lipids) and a mixture of lipids (mixed lipids) composed of 60% (w/w) E. coli lipids, 17.5% egg phosphatidylcholine, 10% bovine brain phosphatidylserine, and 12.5% cholesterol. ATPase Assays—Standard ATPase assays were performed in 40 mm Tris/H2SO4 (pH 7.4), 10 mm NaATP, 15 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mm EGTA, 2 mm NaN3, and 1% (v/v) Me2SO at 37 °C in the presence and absence of transport drugs as indicated. Samples (50 μl) were removed at appropriate times (four time points to ensure linearity) and injected into 1 ml of ice-cold 8 mm EDTA (pH 8) to stop the reaction (25Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15872-15880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Liberated Pi was determined by the method of Van Veldhoven and Mannaerts (26Van Veldhoven P.P. Mannaerts G.P. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 45-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar) as modified by Al-Shawi et al. (27Al-Shawi M.K. Ketchum C.J. Nakamoto R.K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12961-12969Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Drug Titrations—Drug titrations of ATPase activities were fitted to two steady-state kinetic models. The first is a non-partitioning model (Model 1) composed of basal ATPase activity (uncoupled activity in the absence of drugs), drug-activated ATPase activity (at activating drug concentrations), and drug-inhibited ATPase activity (at high inhibitory concentrations of drug). In this model, basal and drug-stimulated activities are independent entities and do not influence each other, but each is inhibited by inhibitory concentrations of drug. The kinetic equation is given by Equation 1,v=(B+(D·[drug]/(Km(D)+[drug])))·(1-([drug]/(Ki+[drug])))(Eq. 1) where v is the ATPase activity, [drug] is the drug concentration, B is the basal ATPase activity, D is the maximal ATPase activity associated with drug activation, Km(D) is the apparent Michaelis constant for drug activation (a virtual apparent dissociation constant of drugs from all drug-bound Pgp species to water), and Ki is the inhibition constant for drug inhibition. Kinetic equations similar to Equation 1 have been used previously to fit the drug-dependent ATPase activity of Pgp (28Litman T. Nielsen D. Skovsgaard T. Zeuthen T. Stein W.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1361: 147-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 29Litman T. Zeuthen T. Skovsgaard T. Stein W.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1361: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Model 1 could conceivably arise in the presence of a tightly bound noncompetitive endogenous substrate or by a permanent activation of basal ATPase of Pgp by a covalent modification such as phosphorylation. The second steady-state kinetic model is an activity-partitioning model (Model 2) (23Omote H. Al-Shawi M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45688-45694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) in which basal and drug-stimulated activities are dependent entities, and Pgp partitions between two forms, an uncoupled form and a coupled form in the presence of activating drug. At maximal activation, all of the Pgp exists in the coupled form. Again, both activities are inhibited by inhibitory concentrations of drug. The kinetic equation is given by Equation 2.v=(B+((D-B)·[drug]/(Km(D)+[drug])))·(1-([drug]/(Ki+[drug])))(Eq. 2) Equation 2 was derived by summation of activities associated with the different enzyme species present (23Omote H. Al-Shawi M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45688-45694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Under “Results,” it will be demonstrated that Equation 2 fully describes the drug-dependent ATPase activity of Pgp. Arrhenius Analysis and Derivation of Transition State Thermodynamic Parameters—The apparent Pgp activation energies of ATP hydrolysis in the presence and absence of drugs were calculated from measurements of ATPase activity as a function of temperature. Assays were performed in Arrhenius mixtures composed of 50 mm NaHEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm NaATP, 17 mm MgSO4, 1% (v/v) Me2SO, 5 mm potassium phosphoenolpyruvate, and 32 μg/ml pyruvate kinase. ATPase assays were performed as described above at 2° increments from 23 to 35 °C. Each ATPase mixture was adjusted to pH 7.5 at each temperature using a pH meter that was accurately calibrated at each temperature. ATPase assays were done in the absence and presence of the following drug concentrations: 10, 30, 40, 50, 90, 130, and 400 μm verapamil; 50 μm spin-labeled verapamil (23Omote H. Al-Shawi M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45688-45694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar); 0.067, 0.15, 0.6, 2, 5, and 15 mm colchicine; 130 μm valinomycin; 400 μm rhodamine 123; 1 and 55 μm Hoechst 33342; and 2, 4, and 40 μm vinblastine. The Me2SO concentration used was increased to 2% for 5 mm colchicine and to 5% for 15 mm colchicine. Specific Pgp ATPase activities of proteoliposomes were corrected to kcat values (turnover numbers) by correcting for the fraction of outward facing (ATP-hydrolyzing) catalytic sites. Orientation of Pgp in each proteoliposome preparation was determined by measuring the latency of catalytic sites as described previously (21Figler R.A. Omote H. Nakamoto R.K. Al-Shawi M.K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 376: 34-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Depending on the amount and type of lipid used in reconstitution, 45–100% of the nucleotide sites were outward facing. In general, the proportion of outward facing Pgp increased with decreasing lipid content, but at the cost of reconstitution efficiency. The apparent activation energies and entropic and enthalpic components at a given temperature were calculated from the slopes and intercepts of plots of ln kcatversus 1/T as described previously (30Al-Shawi M.K. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19640-19648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the following standard equations (Equations 3, 4, 5, 6, 7),δlnkcat/δ(1/T)=-Ea/R(Eq. 3) kcat=Aexp(-Ea/RT)(Eq. 4) Ea=ΔH‡+RT(Eq. 5) ΔS‡=Rln(ANh/RT)-R(Eq. 6) ΔG‡=ΔH‡-TΔS‡(Eq. 7) where T is the absolute temperature; Ea is the Arrhenius activation energy; R is the gas constant; A is a constant of integration, N is Avogadro's number; and ΔG‡, ΔH‡, and ΔS‡ are the changes in Gibbs free energy, enthalpy, and entropy of activation for kcat, respectively. Apparent thermodynamic parameters were converted to absolute thermodynamic parameters as described under “Results” utilizing apparent Michaelis constants for ATP activation (Km(A)) and apparent Km(D) values. Apparent Km(D) values were determined at each temperature for each Pgp preparation type in the Arrhenius mixtures as described above. Apparent Km(A) values were determined at each temperature for each Pgp preparation type and drug used. The Arrhenius mixtures described above were mixed with varying amounts of 50 mm NaHEPES (pH 7.5), 7.1 mm MgSO4, 1% (v/v) Me2SO, 5 mm potassium phosphoenolpyruvate, and 32 μg/ml pyruvate kinase to achieve the following ATP concentrations (at nearly constant free Mg2+): 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, 1, 2, 5, 8, and 10 mm MgATP. The data of the ATPase assays were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation to obtain the apparent Km(A) values. Drug Partitioning into Olive Oil—Highly refined olive oil (Fluka) was used as a mimetic of plasma membrane lipids to establish the lipophilicity of drugs as a function of temperature. Saturated solutions of verapamil and colchicine were prepared in 100 mm Na2HPO4 adjusted to pH 7.5 at the appropriate temperatures. Various volumes of olive oil were mixed with 3 ml of drug saturated in the aqueous phase and incubated for 24 h at the appropriate temperature with occasional vortexing. The following mixture ratios were used: 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, and 1:10. Additionally, the drug stocks were diluted 2-, 10-, and 50-fold in the aqueous phase, and the experiments were repeated to ensure that constant values were obtained at different dilutions and mixture ratios. 1.5 ml of the aqueous phase was removed to a centrifuge tube and spun at 20,000 × g for 5 min to remove any trace of olive oil; then 1.3 ml was removed to a fresh centrifuge tube, and the procedure was repeated. Concentrations of residual drugs were determined in the aqueous phase by UV absorption spectra (200–400 nm). The partition coefficient in olive oil (Po) was calculated as the mole fraction of drug in olive oil divided by the mole fraction of drug in the aqueous phase. The reciprocal value of Po is Pw. The average molecular mass of olive oil was calculated to be 867 Da with an average density of 0.912 g/ml at 25 °C (79Budavari S. Merck Index. 12th Ed. Merck, Whitehouse Station, NJ1996: 1173Google Scholar). 2Data available at www.internationaloliveoil.org. Routine Methods and Materials—SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis were carried out as described previously (8Al-Shawi M.K. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4197-4206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using Amido Black 10B according to the method of Kaplan and Pedersen (31Kaplan R.S. Pedersen P.L. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Concentrations of ionic species of magnesium and ATP were calculated using the algorithm of Fabiato and Fabiato (32Fabiato A. Fabiato F. J. Physiol. (Paris). 1979; 75: 463-505PubMed Google Scholar). General reagents and chemicals were purchased from Aldrich or Sigma. Phosphoenolpyruvate and pyruvate kinase were from Roche Applied Science. Detergents were from Calbiochem and Inalco Pharmaceuticals. Lysophosphatidylcholine and lipids were from Avanti Polar Lipids, except bovine brain phosphatidylserine was from Sigma. Statistics—Statistical analyses were performed using SigmaStat 2.0 (Jandel Scientific). Linear trends were compared by fitting each population of experimental points to be tested to a linear function by leastsquares regression analysis. Using the resultant regressed coefficients (gradient and intercept), apparent gradient and intercept values were calculated for each experimental point. The numerical product of the apparent gradient multiplied by the apparent intercept for each experimental point was then obtained. To calculate the probability of two lines being significantly different, populations of products were then tested against each other by the non-parametric Mann-Whitney rank sum test. Tight Coupling of ATP-binding and Drug Transport Sites— Using drug transport-competent proteoliposomes, Pgp ATPase activities were determined as a function of drug concentration. Fig. 1 clearly shows that there was communication between the nucleotide- and drug-binding sites. The ATPase activity at the two nucleotide sites was strongly controlled by the concentration of drug present. The lines drawn are kinetic fits (Equation 2) to the data generated using our transport model as described previously (23Omote H. Al-Shawi M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45688-45694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 reiterates our previous findings and illustrates that drug control of ATPase activity in transportcompetent proteoliposomes is characterized by three distinct phases: (i) basal ATPase in the absence of drug (transport substrate), (ii) a single Km(D) for activation of ATP hydrolysis at both nucleotide sites associated with inward facing (cellular orientation) high affinity drug-binding sites (see Refs. 23Omote H. Al-Shawi M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45688-45694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar and 33Sharom F.J. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 160: 161-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar), and (iii) a single Ki for inactivation of ATP hydrolysis associated with the saturation of outward facing low affinity drug-binding sites (demonstrated in Ref. 23Omote H. Al-Shawi M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45688-45694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In the case of valinomycin, only the basal ATPase and drug activation phases were seen (Fig. 1). This is thought to be due to the limited solubility, high lipophilicity, and high membrane permeability (34Knoll W. Stark G. J. Membr. Biol. 1975; 25: 249-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) of valinomycin such that an inhibitory concentration to saturate the outward facing low affinity drug-binding sites cannot be technically achieved (see also Ref. 35Eytan G.D. Regev R. Oren G. Assaraf Y.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12897-12902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Resolutions of the Three Phases of Drug-dependent ATPase Activity by Thermodynamic Analyses—To study the interaction of Pgp with drugs during transport, we performed Arrhenius analysis of ATPase activity as a function of drug concentration. Transport drugs analyzed included verapamil, spin-labeled verapamil (SL-verapamil) (23Omote H. Al-Shawi M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45688-45694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), colchicine, valinomycin, rhodamine 123, Hoechst 33342, and vinblastine at the concentrations detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” Drugs were chosen as representative members of the major classes interacting with drug transport sites. Shapiro and Ling (36Shapiro A.B. Ling V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 130-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar) first demonstrated the existence of two cooperative drug-binding transport sites, which they termed the “H-site” and “R-site.” Hoechst 33342, colchicine, and SL-verapamil 3H. Omote and M. K. Al-Shawi, unpublished data. all interact with the H-site. Rhodamine 123 is the archetypal R-site drug. Vinblastine and verapamil have been found to interact with both types of sites (36Shapiro A.B. Ling V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 130-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 37Garrigues A. Loiseau N. Delaforge M. Ferte J. Garrigos M. Andre F. Orlowski S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 1288-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Valinomycin was found to interact with a “circular peptide site,” which also interacted with verapamil (38Sharom F.J. Lu P. Liu R. Yu X. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 621-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Clearly, the circular peptide site also has overlapping specificities with the drug-binding H- and R-sites (36Shapiro A.B. Ling V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 130-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 37Garrigues A. Loiseau N. Delaforge M. Ferte J. Garrigos M. Andre F. Orlowski S. Mol.

Linear Arrhenius relationships were obtained between 23 and 35 °C for ATP turnover and drug transport by both Chinese hamster ovary Pgp and human Pgp. Both E. coli lipid and mixed lipid proteoliposomes were used in this study (examples are shown in Fig. 2A). The linearity of the plots indicated that single overall rate-limiting steps were being observed. In contrast, some plasma membrane preparations and Pgp reconstituted in synthetic lipid mixtures did not produce linear Arrhenius relationships due to lipid phase transitions and other effects (43Buxbaum E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 54-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 44Romsicki Y. Sharom F.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9807-9815Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 45Lu P.H. Liu R.H.

Arrhenius relationships were measured for the drugs listed above as a function of concentration such that all phases of drug-dependent ATPase activities were investigated. It should also be noted that Pgp activity at 37 °C represents a mixed component “optimal activity.” This optimal activity contains the activation component (as measured in this study) and a reversible temperature inactivation component. 4M. K. Al-Shawi, unpublished data. In previous Arrhenius analyses of ATPase activity of Pgp, the turnover numbers were not accurately known. Hence, it was possible to determine only the apparent enthalpic activation energy of the rate-limiting transition state (46Litman T. Zeuthen T. Skovsgaard T. Stein W.D. Biochim. Biophys.

https://openalex.org/W2027793186,"The conventional theory of metals is in crisis. In the past 15 years, there has been an unexpected sprouting of metallic states in low-dimensional systems, directly contradicting conventional wisdom. For example, bosons are thought to exist in one of two ground states: condensed in a superconductor or localized in an insulator. However, several experiments on thin metal-alloy films have observed that a metallic phase disrupts the direct transition between the superconductor and the insulator. We analyze the experiments on the insulator-superconductor transition and argue that the intervening metallic phase is bosonic. All relevant theoretical proposals for the Bose metal are discussed, particularly the recent idea that the metallic phase is glassy. The implications for the putative vortex-glass state in the copper oxide superconductors are examined."

Many Drosophila GPCRs have been de-orphaned through binding or signaling assays tailored to individual receptor subtypes. De-orphaning the remaining ∼20 fly peptide GPCRs would involve the development of several different signaling assays, which are dependent upon the specific G protein signaling pathway that is utilized by each specific receptor. A more general approach of ligand identification would rely on measurement of a universally shared GPCR property. For example, most GPCRs share a common mechanism by which signaling is terminated. In particular, outside the visual system mammalian GPCRs are desensitized by the actions of five GPCR kinases (GRKs) and the two β-arrestins (6Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, GPCRs may be desensitized by a similar GRK/arrestin-mediated mechanism; two GRKs (7Cassill J.A. Whitney M.

Unstimulated receptor-expressing cells display a diffuse GFP fluorescence that fills the cytoplasm. Within minutes of exposure to specific ligands, the majority of the fluorescence translocates to become associated with the membrane. On that basis, we have suggested its use as a generalized method for GPCR de-orphaning (12Barak L.S. Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27497-27500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). In this report we demonstrate the utility of the βarr2-GFP assay to study 11 Drosophila peptide GPCRs that are evolutionarily diverse and that couple to multiple second messengers. We first confirm the specific activities of five peptides for six receptors that were previously de-orphaned: proctolin (PROC, CG6986), neuropeptide F (NPF, CG1147), corazonin (COR, CG10698), dFMRF-amide (CG2114), and allatostatin C (AstC, CG7285 and CG13702). Then we extend the observations to confirm the activity of Drosophila tachykinin peptides for two putative Drosophila tachykinin receptors (DTKs, CG6515 and CG7887). Finally, we employ the assay to deorphan three receptors. These include CG14484, which responds specifically to allatostatin B (AstB) neuropeptide, and a pair of receptor paralogues (CG8985 and CG13803) that are sensitive to the FMRF-amide-related neuropeptide dromyosupressin (DMS). Molecular Cloning—We generated full-length receptors constructs for the following genes using methods described in Johnson et al. (13Johnson E.C. Garczynski S.F. Park D. Crim J.W. Nässel D.R. Taghert P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Rapid amplification of cDNA ends PCR was performed using ESTs or fly head cDNA as templates. Primers flanking the predicted open reading frames incorporated restriction sites to facilitate directional cloning into the pcDNA5/FRT vector (Invitrogen) and a 5′ Kozak sequence to facilitate expression in mammalian cells. The sequences of primers used for all reactions are provided in the Supplemental Material. All receptor constructs were fully sequenced. The Supplemental Material lists sequence information for the following receptor cDNAs: CG7285, CG8985, CG13702, CG13803, and CG14484. Those receptors that had been previously published, and for which we found no differences, are not listed (CG1147, CG2114, CG6515, CG7887, and CG10698). The sequence of CG6986 was published previously (13Johnson E.C. Garczynski S.F. Park D. Crim J.W. Nässel D.R. Taghert P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Transfections and Cell Culture—HEK-293 cells were transiently transfected using electroporation or LipofectAMINE using 10 μg of DNA per 4 × 106 cells. Cells were transfected with a 5:1 ratio of GPCR DNA and β-arrestin2-GFP (βarr2-GFP) DNAs. The dominant negative dynamin mutant (K44A) was included in some transfections, at a ratio of 5:1:1 (GPCR:βarr2-GFP:K44A) (14Zhang J. Barak L.S. Winkler K.E. Caron M.G. Ferguson S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27005-27014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Some experiments included overexpression of a G protein receptor kinase (GRK2). This was achieved using HEK-293 cells that had GRK2 stably integrated into the genome (12Barak L.S. Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27497-27500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), or by including GRK2 in transfections at a ratio of 5:1:1 (GPCR:βarr2-GFP:GRK2). To study calcium responses, stable lines expressing different receptors were generated and selected for resistance to hygromycin B (13Johnson E.C. Garczynski S.F. Park D. Crim J.W. Nässel D.R. Taghert P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6198-6203Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in a humidified incubator under 5% CO2 atmosphere and at 37 °C and split every 3 days 1:5. Growth medium was Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Confocal Microscopy—HEK-293 cells were transfected as described above and plated onto 35-mm dishes with a centered glass coverslip to facilitate imaging. Growth media were removed and replaced with serum-free minimum essential media without phenol red 30 min prior to assays. Peptides were dissolved in the same media and added at room temperature without mixing in 100 μl (equal to 1:10 the volume of culture medium). Images were collected using 488 nm excitation and a 505-nm long-pass filter on a Zeiss laser-scanning microscope or on an Olympus laser scanning microscope. Images were imported into Adobe Photoshop and adjusted for contrast. Peptides—Dromyosuppressin (DMS), adipokinetic hormone, crustacean cardioactive peptide, ecdysis triggering hormone, and pigment dispersing factor (PDF) were purchased from Multiple Peptide Systems, San Diego. The Drosophila tachykinin (DTK1) was purchased from MedProbe, Oslo, Norway. Allatostatin A (AstA-1), allatostatin C (AstC), and DPKQDFMRF-amide were purchased from Bachem. Proctolin and corazonin were purchased from Sigma. Diuretic hormones 31 (DH31) and 44 (DH44) were generously donated by Julian Dow; allatostatin B (AstB-1) and IF-amide were donated by Jan Veenstra; NPF was donated by Joe Crim; and sex peptide was donated by Erik Kubli. Cellular Assays—Intracellular calcium was monitored as described (13Johnson E.C. Garczynski S.F. Park D. Crim J.W. Nässel D.R. Taghert P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6198-6203Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK-293 cells stably expressing receptor DNA were loaded with 5 μm FLUO3-AM dye (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) dissolved in a 20% Pluronic F-127/Me2SO solution in an HBSS solution containing 20 mm HEPES and 2.5 mm probenecid. Cells were measured for changes in fluorescence dependent upon ligand application. To monitor changes in intracellular cAMP levels, HEK-293 cells were transiently transfected with receptor cDNA and a multimerized CRE-luciferase reporter gene (15Hearn M.G. Ren Y. McBride E.W.

Peptides were dissolved in serum-free media and incubated for 4 h; forskolin (Sigma) was added at a 1 μm concentration to test for Gi activity. Luminescence was measured on a Victor Wallac 2 Plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). EC50 values were calculated from concentration-response curves using computerized nonlinear curve fitting (PRISM 3.0, GraphPad, San Diego, CA). [35S]GTPγS Binding Assay—HEK-293 cells were transiently transfected by electroporation using 10 μgof CG13803 per 4 × 106 cells. Cells plated in 10-cm dishes were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and collected by cell scraper in ice-cold homogenization buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μm GDP (Sigma), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 tablet of protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) per 10 ml) and were disrupted by a Dounce homogenizer. Crude membranes were prepared by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Membranes were resuspended in assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μm GDP). Membranes (20 μg of protein per assay tube) were incubated in the presence or absence of DMS and 100 pm [35S]GTPγS (1250 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 1 h at 30 °C as described previously (16Wilbanks A.M. Laporte S.A. Bohn L.M. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11981-11989Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Binding was terminated by rapid filtration over GF/B filters using a Brandel cell harvester (Brandel, Gaithersburg, MD). Filters were washed 3 times with ice-cold distilled H2O and counted by a liquid scintillation counter. The data consist of three separate transfections assayed in quadruplicate. Statistical Analysis—Two-tailed single sample t tests (Microsoft EXCEL) were used to examine basal versus stimulated receptor activity for the measurements of CRE-luciferase activity. p values < 0.05 were considered significant. The translocation of βarr2-GFP chimeras has been used to assess desensitization of a variety of known diverse mammalian GPCRs (9Kim K.M. Valenzano K.J. Robinson S.R. Yao W.D. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J.

To evaluate the efficacy of the translocation assay to study Drosophila GPCRs, we first tested known Drosophila peptide GPCRs that were demonstrated previously to signal through disparate pathways with a panel of synthetic Drosophila peptides. HEK-293 cells transiently expressing the proctolin receptor encoded by CG6986 (13Johnson E.C. Garczynski S.F. Park D. Crim J.W. Nässel D.R. Taghert P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Translocated GFP had the appearance of discrete puncta ranging to a continuous halo. To quantify the robust nature of the response, 100 GFP-positive cells in each of three independent transfections were scored for translocation 20 min after exposure to proctolin. In these cases, we found 89, 91, and 95 cells, respectively, displaying GFP translocation. A typical field of GFP-positive cells is shown in Fig. 1 (bottom panels). In these and subsequent experiments we scored cells within 20 min of exposure to test ligands.Table ISummary of βarr2-GFP translocation following exposure of Drosophila GPCRs to candidate peptide ligands The 11 different Drosophila receptors were transiently expressed in HEK-293 cells, and different peptides were added, all at 1 μm concentrations. Yes indicates translocation, and No indicates translocation was not evident. A dash indicates that this peptide was not tested on the indicated receptor. Every receptor studied was examined following at least two independent transfections. For each transfection at least two dishes were examined, and for each dish at least 25 cells were examined for agonist-stimulated responses.

Cells expressing this receptor displayed βarr2-GFP translocation in response to its cognate ligand, NPF, at micromolar concentrations (Fig. 2). These cells did not respond to any of the other peptides tested (Table I). Cells expressing the corazonin receptor encoded by CG10698 (18Cazzamali G. Saxild N. Grimmelikhuijzen C. Biochem. Biophys.

Two somatostatin-like receptors (CG7285 and CG13702) in Drosophila were demonstrated recently to respond to Ast-C by using Xenopus oocytes (22Kreienkamp H.J. Larusson H.J. Witte I. Roeder T.

Exposure of HEK-293 cells expressing CG7285 or CG13702 receptors to Ast-C peptide at micromolar concentrations did not produce detectable GFP translocation (data not shown). Likewise, these receptors did not display any changes in intracellular calcium levels in response to Ast-C application, with or without a co-expressed promiscuous Gα protein subunit. 2E. Johnson, unpublished data. The C termini of these receptors have multiple clusters of serine/threonine residues that are potential targets for GRK phosphorylation (23Barak L.S. Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Caron M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). We reasoned that this lack of a detectable response to Ast-C might be due to intrinsic phosphorylation by the endogenous complement of GRKs. In mammalian GPCRs, certain receptors are constitutively phosphorylated and associated with β-arrestin which, at steady state, results in their trafficking to endocytic vesicles and a loss of signaling function (16Wilbanks A.M. Laporte S.A. Bohn L.M. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11981-11989Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 23Barak L.S. Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Caron M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). With these receptors, inhibiting clathrin-mediated endocytosis reverses their intracellular localization phenotype. It also re-establishes, at least in part, their signaling function (23Barak L.S. Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Caron M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). To address that possibility, we co-transfected CG7285 and CG13702 each with the dynamin K44A mutant to inhibit internalization, and potentially redistribute the receptors to the plasma membrane (14Zhang J.

As shown in Fig. 3, now in the presence of dynamin K44A, the association of the CG13702 receptor with βarr2-GFP becomes apparent in the unstimulated state and is further enhanced upon addition of Ast-C (Fig. 3). Cells expressing these receptors (with dynamin K44A) did not respond to any of the other peptides tested (Table I). Co-expression of dynamin K44A with the CG6986 receptor did not alter the βarr2-GFP translocation responses of those cells to proctolin or trigger translocation in response to peptide not previously active (data not shown). Thus, blocking endocytosis can interfere with receptor trafficking but does not change the pharmacological specificity of ligand interactions. CG6515 and CG7887 are predicted to encode paralogous receptors that are related to the tachykinin family of receptors. Both receptors have been shown to respond to heterologous tachykinin peptide (24Li X.J. Wolfgang W. Wu Y.N. North R.A. Forte M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3221-3229Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 25Monnier D. Colas J.F. Rosay P. Hen R. Borrelli E. Maroteaux L. J. Biol.

However, neither Drosophila receptor has yet been shown to respond to native Drosophila tachykinins, and thus both remain essentially orphans. Following exposure to a putative Drosophila tachykinin peptide (27Siviter R.J. Coast G.M. Winther A.M. Nachman R.J. Taylor C.A. Shirras A.D. Coates D. Isaac R.E. Nässel D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23273-23280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), we observed translocation of βarr2-GFP in cells expressing either CG6515 or CG7887 (Fig. 4). Cells expressing either receptor did not respond to any of the other peptides tested (Table I). We made several observations that indicated the possible identities of certain orphan GPCRs. CG13803 is predicted to encode a receptor related to the neurotensin/thyrotropin-releasing factor receptor family (3Hewes R. Taghert P.H. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 1126-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Cells expressing CG13803 displayed translocation of βarr2-GFP to the membrane following exposure to the neuropeptide DMS at 1 μm (Fig. 5) and at 100 nm concentrations (data not shown). CG13803 cells did not respond to any other peptide tested (Table I). CG14484 is predicted to encode a receptor related to the bombesin receptor family. We observed translocation of βarr2-GFP by these cells in response to 1 μm Ast-B-1 neuropeptide (Fig. 5) but not to any other peptide tested (Table I). We extended our observations on the CG13803 orphan receptor by considering the potentiating effects of co-expressing GRK. With mammalian GPCRs, co-expression of GRKs can accelerate the kinetics and the extent of βarr2-GFP translocation. It is thought that certain receptors may require more GRK to be effectively phosphorylated. CG8985 encodes a member of the neurotensin/thyrotropin-releasing factor receptor family and is paralogous to CG13803 (3Hewes R. Taghert P.H. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 1126-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Cells expressing CG8985 and overexpressing GRK2 also responded to 1 μm DMS with βarr2-GFP translocation (Fig. 6) but not to 1 μm DPKQDFMRF-amide or any other peptide tested, under any condition (Table I). Although cells expressing CG13803 responded to DMS independently of additional GRK2 expression (Fig. 5), this manipulation did cause a change in the response profile (Fig. 6); CG13803 cells co-expressing GRK2 now also responded to DPKQDFMRF-amide at both 1 μm and 100 nm but not to any other peptide tested (Table I). Co-expression of GRK2 with the CG6986, CG1147, CG10698, CG6515, CG7887, or CG14484 receptors did not alter the profiles of βarr2-GFP translocation responses of those cells to a broad range of test peptides (data not shown). To extend the observations established with the βarr2-GFP translocation assay, we evaluated the sensitivity and selectivity of CG13803 and CG8985 for DMS and DPKQDFMRF-amide by two additional measures of GPCR activation. CG13803 expressing cells displayed significantly higher [35S]GTPγS binding at doses as low as 10 nm of the DMS peptide (Fig. 7A). We also assayed for changes in intracellular calcium and (indirectly) for cAMP levels in response to CG13803 or CG8985 activation. No significant increases in intracellular calcium or cAMP were elicited by exposure of either receptor to DMS or to DPKQDFMRF-amide (data not shown). With cells that were exposed to forskolin, both DMS and DPKQDFMRF-amide produced significant decreases in cAMP levels (Fig. 7B) suggesting that these receptors are coupled to inhibitory G proteins. Estimated EC50 values for CG13803 were 0.17 nm (r2 = 0.95) for DMS and 4.2 nm (r2 = 0.95) for DPKQDFMRF-amide. For CG8985 cells, estimated EC50 values were = 1.8 nm (r2 = 0.89) for DMS and 13 nm (r2 = 0.92) for DPKQDFMRF-amide. Again DMS was significantly more potent than DPKQDFMRF-amide, and that feature recapitulated results obtained with the βarr2-GFP translocation. For mammalian GPCRs, it has been shown that the pattern of βarr2-GFP translocation falls into two categories. Class A receptors maintain translocated βarr2-GFP at the plasma membrane. Class B receptors, which have C-terminal clusters of serine and threonine residues and thus higher affinity for β-arrestins, internalize the translocated βarr2-GFP into endocytic vesicles (28Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19452-19460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). This receptor internalization (14Zhang J. Barak L.S. Winkler K.E. Caron M.G. Ferguson S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27005-27014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) is visible within 10 min post-treatment as the formation of round fluorescent vesicles that often have non-fluorescent centers. The translocation responses of cells expressing the Drosophila peptide GPCRs tended to show a similar categorization (Fig. 8). Specifically, cells expressing CG2114, CG6515, CG6986, CG7285, CG8985, CG13702, CG13803, and CG14484 typically displayed class A type characteristics. Cells expressing CG1147, CG7887, and CG10698 typically displayed class B type characteristics. The βarr2-GFP translocation assay has been used effectively and extensively to study diverse GPCRs that are sensitive to different peptides and amines (9Kim K.M. Valenzano K.J. Robinson S.R. Yao W.D.

https://openalex.org/W2017363944,"Recently, we demonstrated that the control of cytosolic and mitochondrial redox balance and oxidative damage is one of the primary functions of NADP+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH) by supplying NADPH for antioxidant systems. We investigated whether the ICDH would be a vulnerable target of peroxynitrite anion (ONOO-) as a purified enzyme, in intact cells, and in liver mitochondria from ethanol-fed rats. Synthetic peroxynitrite and 3-morpholinosydnomine N-ethylcarbamide (SIN-1), a peroxynitrite-generating compound, inactivated ICDH in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The inactivation of ICDH by peroxynitrite or SIN-1 was reversed by dithiothreitol. Loss of enzyme activity was associated with the depletion of the thiol groups in protein. Immunoblotting analysis of peroxynitrite-modified ICDH indicates that S-nitrosylation of cysteine and nitration of tyrosine residues are the predominant modifications. Using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) with tryptic digestion of protein, we found that peroxynitrite forms S-nitrosothiol adducts on Cys305 and Cys387 of ICDH. Nitration of Tyr280 was also identified, however, this modification did not significantly affect the activity of ICDH. These results indicate that S-nitrosylation of cysteine residues on ICDH is a mechanism involving the inactivation of ICDH by peroxynitrite. The structural alterations of modified enzyme were indicated by the changes in protease susceptibility and binding of the hydrophobic probe 8-anilino-1-napthalene sulfonic acid. When U937 cells were incubated with 100 μm SIN-1 bolus, a significant decrease in both cytosolic and mitochondrial ICDH activities were observed. Using immunoprecipitation and ESI-MS, we were also able to isolate and positively identify S-nitrosylated and nitrated mitochondrial ICDH from SIN-1-treated U937 cells as well as liver from ethanol-fed rats. Inactivation of ICDH resulted in the pro-oxidant state of cells reflected by an increased level of intracellular reactive oxygen species, a decrease in the ratio of [NADPH]/[NADPH + NADP+], and a decrease in the efficiency of reduced glutathione turnover. The peroxynitrite-mediated damage to ICDH may result in the perturbation of the cellular antioxidant defense mechanisms and subsequently lead to a pro-oxidant condition.

Peroxynitrite anion (ONOO-) is a potent oxidant generated from the interaction of nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide (O2.¯) (1Beckman J.S. Beckman T.W. Chen J. Marshall M.A. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl.

Antioxidant enzymes, which provide a substantial defense against damage induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS), could be susceptible to the damaging effect of peroxynitrite. It has been shown that glutathione peroxidase, manganese SOD (Mn-SOD), and glutathione reductase are inactivated by peroxynitrite (22Padmaja S. Squadrito G.L. Pryor W.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 349: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 23MacMillan-Crow L.A. Crow J.P. Kerby J.D. Beckman J.S. Thompson J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It is implied that the inactivation of antioxidant enzymes by peroxynitrite may lead to the perturbation of the cellular antioxidant defense system and subsequently exacerbate the harmful effect of peroxynitrite as well as ROS. The isocitrate dehydrogenases (ICDHs, EC1.1.1.41 and EC1.1.1.42) catalyze oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate and require either NAD+ or NADP+, producing NADH and NADPH, respectively (25Koshland Jr., D.E. Walsh K. LaPorte D.C. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 1985; 27: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). NADPH is an essential reducing equivalent for the regeneration of reduced glutathione (GSH) by glutathione reductase and for the activity of NADPH-dependent thioredoxin system (26Chae H.Z. Chung S.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27670-27678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Kwon S.J. Park J.-W. Choi W.K. Kim I.H. Kim K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), both are important in the protection of cells from oxidative damage. Therefore, ICDH may play an antioxidant role during oxidative stress. We recently reported that ICDH is involved in the supply of NADPH needed for GSH production against cytosolic and mitochondrial oxidative damage (28Lee S.M. Koh H.J. Park D.C. Song B.J. Huh T.L.

Hence, the damage of ICDH may result in the perturbation of the balance between oxidants and antioxidants and subsequently lead to a pro-oxidant condition. Because cysteine residues serve as an essential role in the catalytic function of ICDH (30Smyth G.E. Colman R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14918-14925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Fatania H.R. Al-Nassar K.E. Thomas N. FEBS Lett. 1993; 322: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), the highly reactive sulfhydryl groups in ICDH could be potential targets of peroxynitrite. In this study we show that peroxynitrite modifies tyrosine and thiol groups of ICDH, thus forming nitrotyrosine and S-nitrosothiol adducts with a concomitant loss of its activity in vitro and in vivo. Materials—Isocitrate, β-NADP+, NADPH, mitochondrial ICDH from pig heart, GSH, cysteine, dithiothreitol (DTT), methionine, penicillamine, 2-mercaptoethanol, ebselen, selenomethionine, selenocysteine, human serum albumin, 5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoate) (DTNB), xylenol orange, o-phthaldehyde, lucigenin, bovine erythrocyte SOD, Pronase, trypsin, and 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonic acid (ANSA) were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). 3-Morpholinosydnomine N-ethylcarbamide (SIN-1), anti-nitrotyrosine antibody, anti-nitrosocysteine antibody, and anti-inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) antibody were purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). 2′,7′-Dichlorofluoroscein diacetate (DCFH-DA) and N,N′-dimethyl-N(iodoacetyl)-N′-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)ethyleneamine (IANBD) were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Electrophoreses reagents and Bio-Rad protein assay kit were purchased from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA). Peroxynitrite was synthesized from hydrogen peroxide and isoamyl nitrite as described previously (32Uppu R.M. Pryor W.A. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 236: 242-249Crossref Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Contaminating hydrogen peroxide was eliminated with manganese dioxide, and peroxynitrite concentration was determined at 302 nm (ϵ = 1.67 mm-1 cm-1). To prepare recombinant cytosolic ICDH, Escherichia coli transformed with pGEX-2λT containing an insert of mouse cytosolic ICDH cDNA construct was grown and lysed, and the glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein was purified on glutathione-agarose as described elsewhere (33Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 15: 31-40Crossref Scopus (5028) Google Scholar). Antibody against mitochondrial ICDH was prepared from mitochondrial ICDH-immunized rabbit, and the antibody was purified by Protein A affinity chromatography. Cell Culture—U937, a human histiocytic lymphoma cell line was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained in RPMI 1640 and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, respectively. These cells were incubated in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C. Animals and Treatment—Young adult male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 200-250 g were randomly separated into two groups: (a) rats fed ethanol-containing liquid diets for 30 days (n = 5); (b) rats pair-fed isocaloric liquid diets without ethanol for 30 days (n = 5). They were housed in individual cages under conditions of constant temperature (22 °C) and humidity. The calorie distribution of liquid diets component is as follows: 16% as protein, 36% as fat, 13% as carbohydrate, and 33% as either ethanol or additional carbohydrate in the isocaloric liquid diets. Ethanol was incorporated into the liquid diets containing all required nutrients, and liquid diets were the only source of fluid and food provided, as recommended by the manufacturer. Rats given isocaloric liquid diets without ethanol were pair-fed daily on an isoenergetic basis with the corresponding littermates fed the ethanol-containing diets. Before sacrifice, the rats were fasted overnight but had free access to drinking water for 14-16 h. Preparation of Liver Mitochondrial Fraction—Rats were deeply anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium (1 mg/kg body weight), and the liver was removed and dissected for biochemical analysis. For the preparation of mitochondria sample from liver tissue, the tissue portions were homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer in sucrose buffer (0.32 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4). The mitochondrial fractions from tissue homogenates were prepared as described below. Measurement of ICDH Activity—ICDH (6.5 μg) was added to 1 ml of Tris buffer, pH 7.4, containing NADP+ (2 mm), MgCl2 (2 mm), and isocitrate (5 mm). Activity of ICDH was measured by the production of NADPH at 340 nm at 25 °C (34Loverde A.W. Lehrer G.M. J. Neurochem. 1973; 20: 441-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). One unit of ICDH activity is defined as the amount of enzyme catalyzing the production of 1 μmol of NADPH/min. For the determination of ICDH activities in mammalian cells, cells were collected at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and were washed once with cold PBS. Briefly, cells were homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer in sucrose buffer (0.32 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4). Cell homogenates were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatants further centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting supernatants were used as a cytosolic fraction to measure the activity of cytosolic ICDH. The precipitates were washed twice with sucrose buffer to collect mitochondria pellet. The mitochondrial pellets were resuspended in 1× PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, disrupted by ultrasonication (4710 Series, Cole-Palmer, Chicago, IL) twice at 40% of maximum setting for 10 s, and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatants were used to measure the activity of mitochondrial ICDH. The protein levels were determined by the method of Bradford using reagents purchased from Bio-Rad. Reversibility—ICDH was exposed to peroxynitrite or SIN-1 and then passed through Econo-pac 10 DG gel filtration column (Bio-Rad). The enzyme was incubated with 20 mm DTT at 37 °C. The percentage of ICDH activity recovered after inactivation was calculated. Titration of Sulfhydryl Groups and Competitive Labeling—The thiol groups of ICDH were titrated in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0/0.5, mm EDTA/1 mm DTNB. A molar coefficient of 1.36 × 104m-1cm-1 for the anion thionitrobenzoic acid was used. Peroxynitrite-, SIN-1-treated, and untreated ICDH (50 μg) were labeled with 10-fold molar excess of IANBD (150 μm) in a total volume of 100 μl of buffer (20 mm Tris-buffer, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm NaCl). The reaction was allowed to proceed for 1 h at room temperature in the dark and was quenched by addition of 1 mm cysteine. Cysteine-reacted dye was removed by extensive dialysis against labeling buffer. IANBD-labeled samples were excited at 481 nm, and emission was monitored between 490 and 625 nm. Each recorded spectrum was corrected for background fluorescence of the relevant control. Immunoblot Analysis—Proteins were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and subsequently subjected to immunoblot analysis using appropriate antibodies. Immunoreactive antigen was then recognized by using horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG and an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation—Mitochondrial fractions were cleared with Protein-A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C. Supernatants were then incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-mitochondrial ICDH (5 μg) for 12 h at 4 °C followed by protein-A-Sepharose incubation for 1 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitated proteins were washed, separated by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue. For mass spectrometry, the immunoprecipitated proteins were washed and dissolved in 20 μl of 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v). Determination of Nitrotyrosine—Nitrotyrosine content of ICDH treated with peroxynitrite or SIN-1 was continually monitored from 250 to 500 nm using a Shimadzu UV-visible spectrophotometer. Nitrotyrosine-containing proteins were detected by incubating blots with a mouse monoclonal anti-nitrotyrosine antibody as described above. Mass Spectrometry—Positive ion electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) was performed on HP 1100 Series LC/MSD triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer (Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, CA) equipped with an atmospheric pressure ion source. Control and peroxynitrite (10 μm, 10 min)-treated ICDH samples were subjected to gel filtration and mixed with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Aliquots of ICDH samples (5 μg of protein) were directly infused into the ESI source of the mass spectrometer. For the tryptic digestion and peptide mapping, ICDH samples treated with peroxynitrite were denatured in the 95 °C water for 20 min and cleaved with trypsin for 24 h at 37 °C, at an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1/10 (w/w). Positive ion mass spectra were acquired for capillary LC/MS analyses. The effluent from octadecyl silica gel (C-18) reverse-phase column (5 mm; 4.6 × 250 mm) (Beckman Coulter Inc., Fullerton, CA) was introduced directly into the ionization needle of the mass spectrometer. Solvent A was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in ultra pure water, and solvent B was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile. Peptides were eluted using an increasing linear gradient of solvent B from 0-60% in 60 min, 60-100% in 40 min, with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The molecular masses of fractionated peptide fragments were examined by ESI-MS, and the amino acid sequences were assigned using the data obtained. Structural Analysis—For circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, samples of ICDH were desalted on Econo-Pac 10 DG column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated in 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, and fractions containing the protein were pooled. CD spectra were recorded on a temperature-controlled spectropolarimeter (JASCO, J-810). Spectra were recorded at 25 °C in 0.05-cm quartz cells from 190 to 250 nm with protein concentrations of 0.05 mg/ml at a digital resolution of 0.5 nm, with scan speed of 5 nm/min for wavelength above and below 190 nm, respectively. Multiple spectra were recorded for duplicated samples. These spectra were averaged and corrected for baseline contribution from the buffer. Susceptibility to proteolysis was measured by the incubation of ICDH samples (65 μg) with 12.5 μg of Pronase in 250 μl of 25 mm Hepes (pH 8.0)/100 mm NaCl for 1 h at 37 °C. After incubation, the aliquots were removed and subjected to a 10% trichloroacetic acid treatment. After centrifugation of precipitated proteins for 10 min at maximum speed in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge, the supernatant was first neutralized with a predetermined volume of 2 m potassium borate, pH 10. The amount of small peptides in the supernatant was then determined as described by Church et al. (35Church F.C. Porter D.H. Catignani G.L. Swaisgood H.E. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 146: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). ANSA (100 μm) was incubated with the various forms of ICDH in 25 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0/50 mm KCl. The fluorescence emission spectra (excitation, 370 nm) of the different mixtures were monitored on spectrofluorometer. Binding of ANSA to the protein was evidenced by subtracting the emission spectrum of ANSA from that of ANSA in the presence of enzyme. Cellular NADPH and GSH Levels—NADPH was measured using the enzymatic cycling method as described by Zerez et al. (36Zerez C.R. Lee S.J. Tanaka K.R. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 164: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction mixture, which combined 100 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm phenazine ethosulfate, 0.5 mm 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, 1.3 units of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and appropriate amounts of the cell extracts, was preincubated for 5 min at 37 °C. The reaction was started by the addition of 1 mm glucose 6-phosphate. The absorbance at 570 nm was measured for 3 min. The concentration of total glutathione was determined by the rate of formation of 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid at 412 nm (ϵ = 1.36 × 104m-1cm-1) as the method described by Akerboom and Sies (37Akerboom T.P.M. Sies H. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 77: 373-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar), and GSSG was measured by the DTNB-GSSG reductase recycling assay after treating GSH with 2-vinylpyridine (38Anderson M.E. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 113: 548-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (2380) Google Scholar). Measurement of Intracellular ROS—Intracellular peroxide production was measured using the oxidant-sensitive fluorescent probe DCFH-DA with confocal microscopy (39Schwarz M.A. Lazo J.S. Yalowich J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15238-15243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown at 2 × 106 cells per 100-mm plate containing slide glass coated with poly-l-lysine and maintained in the growth medium for 24 h. Cells were exposed to 10 μm DCFH-DA for 15 min and treated with 100 μm SIN-1 for 5 min. Cells on the slide glass were washed with PBS, and a coverglass was put on the slide glass. 2′7′-Dichlorofluorescein (DCF) fluorescence (excitation, 488 nm; emission, 520 nm) was imaged on a laser confocal scanning microscope (DM/R-TCS, Leica) coupled to a microscope (Leitz DM REB). Hydrogen peroxide oxidizes ferrous (Fe2+) to ferric ion (Fe3+) selectively in dilute acid, and the resulting ferric ions can be determined using a ferric sensitive dye, xylenol orange, as an indirect measure of hydrogen peroxide concentration. Mitochondrial fractions were added to FOX solution (0.1 mm xylenol orange, 0.25 mm ammonium ferrous sulfate, 100 mm sorbitol, and 25 mm H2SO4) and incubated in a room temperature for 30 min, and absorbance was measured at 560 nm. Hydrogen peroxide was used to draw standard curve as described (40Jiang Z.Y. Hunt J.V. Wolff S.P. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 202: 384-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (1431) Google Scholar). Measurements of O2.¯/NO Formation and SOD/iNOS Activity—Superoxide was measured using lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence (41Li Y. Zhu H. Kuppusamy P. Rouband V. Zweier J.L. Trush M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2015-2023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Nitrite, a stable product of NO oxidation, was determined by the Griess reaction (42Green L.C. Wagner D.A. Glogowsk J. Skipper P.L. Wishnok J.S. Tannenbaum S.R. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 126: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (10586) Google Scholar). The activity of iNOS was determined by the rate of conversion of [l-3H]arginine to [l-3H]citrulline as described (43Przedborski S. Jackson-Lewis V. Yokoyama R. Shibata T. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4565-4571Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). The iNOS protein was assessed immunochemically in Western blots by using polyclonal anti-iNOS antibodies. SOD activity was assayed spectrophotometrically using a pyrogallol assay (44Marklund S. Marklund G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 47: 469-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (7732) Google Scholar). Replicates—Unless otherwise indicated, each result described in the paper is representative of at least three separate experiments. Inactivation of ICDH by Peroxynitrite—Incubation of mitochondrial ICDH with synthesized peroxynitrite or SIN-1 at pH 7.4 at 37 °C resulted in a time- and concentration-dependent loss of enzyme activity as shown in Fig. 1 (A and B). Previously decomposed peroxynitrite does not inactivate the enzyme (data not shown), indicating that the decomposition products of peroxynitrite are not responsible for the inactivation of enzyme. SIN-1 is a nitric oxide and superoxide anion donor and thus considered a peroxynitrite releasing compound (45Hogg N. Darley-Usmar V.M. Wilson M.T. Moncada S. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Under the conditions chosen, incubation with 0.1 mm peroxynitrite or 0.1 mm SIN-1 resulted in ∼90 or 65% inhibition. The mouse liver cytosolic ICDH was expressed as a fusion protein to GST, and it was purified as a recombinant protein, which was almost pure as estimated by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). The inhibition of recombinant cytosolic ICDH by peroxynitrite or SIN-1 demonstrated basically the same pattern, as shown in Fig. 1C. We evaluated whether the presence of product would protect the active site of ICDH from peroxynitrite- and SIN-1-mediated inactivation. The inactivation of enzyme by peroxynitrite or SIN-1 was partially prevented in the presence of NADPH in a dose-dependent manner as shown in Fig. 1D. This observation strongly suggests that the inactivation with peroxynitrite or SIN-1 takes place in the vicinity of the active site of ICDH. To gain insight into the mechanism by which peroxynitrite or SIN-1 inactivates ICDH, the protective effect of several molecules that react with either peroxynitrite or secondary oxidants with hydroxyl radical-like reactivity from peroxynitrite decomposition was evaluated. Table I shows that hydroxyl radical scavengers such as mannitol,"

In this study, we have made a replication-deficient recombinant adenovirus that expresses functional AP-2α (Ad-AP2). Cells infected with Ad-AP2 expressed induced levels of AP-2α protein, which bound to DNA in a sequence-specific manner and activated the AP-2-specific reporter 3X-AP2. Expression of AP-2α from Ad-AP2 inhibited cellular DNA synthesis and induced apoptosis. Ad-AP2 infection resulted in efficient inhibition of growth of cancer cells of six different types. In addition, prior expression of AP-2α increased the chemosensitivity of H460, a lung carcinoma cell line, to adriamycin (2.5-fold) and cisplatin (5-fold). Furthermore, the growth inhibition by AP-2α was found to be less efficient in the absence of p53 or p21, which correlated with reduced apoptosis in p53 null cells and lack of DNA synthesis inhibition in p21WAF1/CIP1 null cells by AP-2α, respectively. These results suggest that AP-2α inhibits the growth of cells by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis and that the use of AP-2α should be explored as a therapeutic strategy either alone or in combination with chemotherapy.

AP-2α overexpression from Ad-AP2 resulted in cell cycle arrest in G1 phase, induction of apoptosis, and inhibition of growth of a variety of cancer cells. In addition, prior expression of AP-2α resulted in increased chemosensitivity of cancer cells to anticancer drugs. Moreover, the growth inhibition by AP-2α was found to be partially defective in p53 null or p21WAF1/CIP1 null cells. These results suggest that growth inhibition by AP-2α involves both cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction, and the use of Ad-AP2 should be explored as a therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlasmids—pSG5/AP-2 and 3X-AP2, described before, were kindly provided by Dr. P.

Briefly, AP-2α was cloned as a XbaI/XhoI fragment into pAdTrack-CMV. pAdTrack-CMV-AP-2 was linearized with PmeI and co-transformed along with pAdEasy-1 into Escherichia coli BJ5183 selecting for kanamycin resistance. Clones carrying appropriate recombinant plasmid were identified, plasmid DNA extracted, linearized with PacI, and transfected into 293 cells. The recombinant virus plaques were identified as localized areas of clearing consisting of round cells, which fluoresce green under fluorescent microscopy. Adenoviral infections were carried out as described (41Das S. El-Deiry W.F. Somasundaram K. J. Biol.

Western analysis and immunohistochemical staining were performed as described before (34Somasundaram K. El-Deiry W.S. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1047-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) with mouse anti-human p21WAF1/CIP1 monoclonal (Ab-1; Oncogene), mouse anti-human p53 monoclonal (Ab-2; Oncogene), mouse anti-human Rb monoclonal (Ab5; Oncogene), mouse anti-human PARP monoclonal (Ab-2; Oncogene), rabbit anti-human AP-2 polyclonal (sc-184; Santa Cruz), and goat anti-human actin polyclonal (sc-1616; Santa Cruz). The cells were harvested or fixed at 24 h or appropriate time point as described after virus infection and subjected to analysis.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was essentially carried as described before (14Williams T Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 670-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). An AP-2-binding site (5′-GATCGAACTGACCGCCCGCGGCCCGT-3′) was used as probe. The following reaction conditions were used: 10 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 4.5% Ficoll 400, 60 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, and 40 ng/ml poly(dI-dC). The sequence of the nonspecific competitor was as follows: 5′-GATCCGAATTCGGTACC-3′. Nuclear extracts were prepared after 24 h of virus infection of HT1080 cells as described before (42Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3908) Google Scholar).DNA Synthesis Inhibition—Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation and [3H]thymidine incorporation were done as described earlier (4Zeng Y.X.

Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1047-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). BrdU (20 μm) or [3H]thymidine (5 μCi/ml) was added after 20 h of virus infection. The experiment was terminated 4 h after addition of these compounds, and DNA synthesis was measured either by using anti-BrdU antibody (Ab-3; Oncogene) or measuring the radioactivity in a scintillation counter.Cell Cycle Analysis—H460 cells were infected with Ad-lacZ, Ad-p53, or Ad-AP2 virus at 20 MOI. At indicated time points, the cells were washed with PBS twice and harvested by trypsinization. The cells were washed again with PBS and fixed with cold 70% ethanol for 1 h. The cells were washed with PBS once and then incubated with 4 μg of ribonuclease A (Roche Applied Science) for 30 min at room temperature. Propidium iodide was added to the cell suspension at a final concentration of 20 μg/ml and incubated for 30 min. The cells were then analyzed by flow cytometry using FACScan (Becton Dickinson). The results were quantified by using the software Cell Quest (Becton Dickinson). For two-color FACS, 20 μm BrdU was added to cells during the last 4 h of their time, at which point they are harvested. The cells were washed with PBS twice and harvested by trypsinization. The cells were washed again with PBS and fixed with cold 70% ethanol for 1 h. Subsequently, the cells were centrifuged, and the pellet was resuspended in 2 n HCL and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The cells were washed thrice with PBS and incubated with 1 μg of anti-BrdU antibody (Ab-3; Oncogene) for 30 min. The cells were washed again twice with PBS and incubated with 2 μg of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat antimouse antibody (Oncogene) for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were washed with PBS once and then incubated with 4 μg of ribonuclease A (Roche Applied Science) for 30 min at room temperature. Propidium iodide was added to the cell suspension at a final concentration of 20 μg/ml and incubated for 30 min. The cells were then analyzed by flow cytometry using FACScan (Becton Dickinson). The results were quantified by using the software WinList (Verity Software House Inc).MTT Assay—MTT assay was carried out as described previously (43Carmichael J. Degraff W.G. Gazdar A.A.F. Minna J.D. Mitchell J.B. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 936-942PubMed Google Scholar, 44Blagosklonny M. El-Deiry W.S. Int. J, Cancer. 1996; 67: 386-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). 1.5 × 103 cells/well were plated in a 96-well plate. After 24 h of plating, the cells were infected with Ad-AP-2 at the indicated MOI. MTT (20 μl of 5 mg/ml) was added 48 h after infection. MTT is a tetrazolium salt that is converted by living cells into blue formazan crystals. The medium was removed from the wells 3 h after MTT addition, and 200 μl of Me2SO was added to dissolve the formazan crystals, and then the absorbance was measured at 550 nm in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader.RESULTSExpression of Functional AP-2α in Ad-AP2-infected Cells— To detect the expression of AP-2α protein in Ad-AP2 infected cells, AP-2α protein level was monitored after infecting different cancer cells with Ad-AP2 or the control virus Ad-LacZ at a MOI of 20. At 24 h after infection, the cells were fixed and stained for AP-2α protein. Ad-AP2 infection resulted in intense nuclear staining in comparison with Ad-LacZ infection in SW80 (Fig. 1a, compare panel D with panel A), H460 (Fig. 1a, compare panel E with panel B), and HT1080 (Fig. 1a, compare panel F with panel C) cells. We also monitored the induced expression of AP-2α protein upon Ad-AP2 infection by Western blotting. Upon Ad-AP2 infection, SW480 (Fig. 1b, compare lane 2 with lane 1), H460 (Fig. 1c), and HT1080 (Fig. 1d) cells showed several fold higher amounts of AP-2α protein in comparison with Ad-LacZ infection. AP-2α expression in Ad-AP2-infected cells is also time-dependent with maximum expression seen between 24 and 36 h after infection (Fig. 1d).Next we checked whether AP-2α expressed from Ad-AP2 is functional by monitoring the sequence-specific DNA binding and activation of AP-2-specific reporter by AP-2α protein. The nuclear extract made from Ad-AP2-infected but not Ad-LacZ-infected HT1080 cells showed a specific DNA-protein complex (Fig. 2a, lane 3), which is a specific AP-2-DNA complex because it was competed by unlabeled AP-2-binding oligonucleotide (Fig. 2a, lanes 4–6) but not by a nonspecific oligonucleotide (Fig. 2a, lanes 7–9). To measure the function of AP-2α expressed from Ad-AP2, we used an AP-2-specific reporter 3X-AP2-CAT (45Buettner R. Kannan P. Imhof A. Bauer R. Yim S.O. Ghuber R. van Dyke M.W. Tainsky M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4174-4185Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). 3X-AP2-CAT reporter contains three copies of AP-2-binding sequences cloned in tandem upstream of thymidine kinase minimal promoter. As a positive control, we used a construct pSG5/AP-2, which expresses AP-2α from SV40 promoter (3Kannan P. Buettner R. Chiao P.J. Yim S.O. Sarkiss M. Tainsky M.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1258-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). As expected, AP-2α expressed from pSG5-activated 3X-AP2-CAT very efficiently (Fig. 2b, compare lane 3 with lane 2). Similarly, AP-2α expressed from Ad-AP2 also activated 3X-AP2-CAT (Fig. 2b, compare lane 5 with lane 4) to comparable levels. AP-2α has been shown to activate p21WAF1/CIP1 (4Zeng Y.X. Somasundaram K. El-Deiry W.S. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 28-32Crossref Scopus (260) Google Scholar). In our experiments, AP-2α expressed from Ad-AP2 also activated p21WAF1/CIP1in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 4). Thus, it is evident that infection of cells with Ad-AP2 results in increased levels of functionally active AP-2α.Fig. 2Analysis of DNA binding activity and transcriptional activation by AP-2α expressed from Ad-AP2.a, electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed using nuclear extract (Nuc.Ext.) made from either Ad-AP2- or Ad-LacZ-infected cells as described under “Materials and Methods.” Competitions were performed by adding increasing amounts (1.0, 2.5, and 5.0 pmol) of specific (lanes 4–6) or nonspecific (lanes 7–9) competitor as indicated. b, HT1080 cancer cells were transfected with 5 μg of 3X-AP2 and where indicated by +, control vector pSG5 (5 μg) or pSG5 expressing AP-2α (5 μg). The total amount of DNA/transfection was kept constant at 10 μg. After 6 h of transfection, the cells were infected with Ad-AP2 (lane 4) or Ad-LacZ (lane 5) at a MOI of 20. Transfections were carried out using Lipofectin transfection reagent. The lysates were prepared and analyzed for CAT reporter activity 24 h post-transfection as described under “Materials and Methods.” All of the samples were done in duplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 4Western analysis of Ad-AP2 virus-infected cells. H460 cells were infected with Ad-LacZ or Ad-AP2 at 20 MOI. After the indicated time points of virus infection, the total cell extracts were prepared and subjected to Western analysis for PARP, Rb, p21WAF1/CIP1, AP-2α, and actin proteins as described under “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Ad-AP2 Infection Induces Growth Arrest and Apoptosis—To see the effect of AP-2α expressed from Ad-AP-2 on cell cycle, we monitored the extent of cellular DNA synthesis and cell cycle profile in Ad-AP2-infected cells. The cellular DNA synthesis was measured by measuring BrdU incorporation and [3H]thymidine incorporation. Infection of H460 cells with Ad-AP2 resulted in a drastic reduction in percentage of cells incorporating BrdU in comparison with Ad-LacZ cells (Fig. 3a, compare panel F with panel D). The results obtained in Fig. 3a were quantified, and the percentage of BrdU incorporation under different conditions is shown in Fig. 3b. Similarly, infection of H460 cells with Ad-AP2 resulted in reduction of [3H]thymidine incorporation (Fig. 3c), which is indicative of DNA synthesis inhibition. The inhibition of DNA synthesis is also dose-dependent because the inhibition is more severe as the MOI of virus is increased (Fig. 3c). The phosphorylation status of Rb correlated with the extent of cellular DNA synthesis (Fig. 4). The hypophosphorylated Rb is seen in Ad-AP2-infected cells in comparison with Ad-LacZ-infected cells (Fig. 4) in a time-dependent manner.Fig. 3DNA synthesis inhibition and induction of apoptosis in Ad-AP2-infected cells.a, H460 cells were infected with Ad-LacZ or Ad-AP2 at a MOI of 20. The cells were allowed to incorporate BrdU for last 4 h. After 24 h of infection, BrdU-positive cells were identified by staining using anti-BrdU antibody and Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (panels B, D, and F). Panels A, C, and E of a are DAPI staining of cells of the same region as panels B, D, and F of a, respectively. BrdU-positive cells were calculated as percentages of BrdU incorporation from a and shown in b. The percentage of BrdU incorporation was calculated by dividing the number of cells showing BrdU incorporation by total number of cells counted. c, H460 cells were infected with Ad-LacZ (black bar) or Ad-AP2 (gray bar) virus at a MOI of 5, 10, or 20. The cells were allowed to incorporate [3H]thymidine during the last 4 h of the experiment. After 24 h of virus infection, [3H]thymidine incorporated into cellular DNA was measured as described under “Materials and Methods.” d, FACS analysis of Ad-AP2-infected cells. H460 cells were infected with Ad-LacZ, Ad-p53, or Ad-AP2 at 20 MOI. The cells were harvested at 0, 24, 36, 48, and 72 h after infection and subjected to flow cytometry analysis as mentioned under “Materials and Methods.” The proportion of cells having a 2 n amount of cells, which corresponds to the G1 phase of cell cycle, are quantified, and the values are given on the right side. The percentage of cells carrying less than a 2 n amount of DNA of the total cells analyzed, which represent apoptotic cells (A), is also measured by using the same software and indicated in each panel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) was also carried out to analyze the cell cycle profile and induction of apoptosis in Ad-AP2-infected cells. The tumor suppressor p53 expressing adenovirus (Ad-p53) was used as a positive control. H460 cells were infected with Ad-LacZ, Ad-p53, or Ad-AP2 viruses, and the cells were collected at different time points after infection and subjected to FACS (Fig. 3d). The proportion of cells containing a 2 n amount of DNA, which represent G1 phase cells, increased significantly in Ad-p53- and Ad-AP2-infected cells in comparison with Ad-LacZ-infected cells as early as 24 h after infection (55.54–71.52% and 55.54–64.02%, respectively). Based on the above results from BrdU incorporation, [3H]thymidine incorporation, and FACS studies with supporting evidence like induction of p21WAF1/CIP1 and appearance of hypophosphorylated Rb in Ad-AP2-infected cells, we conclude that AP-2α expression leads to inhibition of cellular DNA synthesis resulting in arrest of cells in G1 phase of cell cycle.In addition to cell cycle arrest, FACS also reveals the induction of apoptosis in Ad-AP2-infected cells (Fig. 3d). Cells with less than 2 n content of DNA, which represent apoptotic cells, appeared in very high proportion by 36 h in Ad-p53-infected cells (25.6%) and by 48 h in Ad-AP2 infected cells (18.7%) in comparison with Ad-LacZ infected cells (Fig. 3d). The proportion of cells undergoing apoptosis increased even further in both Ad-p53-infected (41.8% by 48 h) and Ad-AP2-infected (49.2% by 72 h) cells. Induction of apoptosis was also confirmed by PARP cleavage assay. PARP, an enzyme involved in DNA repair mechanisms is cleaved by the caspase-3. Therefore, the cleavage of PARP from the native 115 to 89 kDa is considered as a hallmark of apoptosis. Ad-AP2 infection but not Ad-LacZ infection resulted in the appearance of an 89-kDa cleaved product of PARP by as early as 24 h after infection (Fig. 4; see also Fig. 8). Taken together, above data suggest that infection of cells with Ad-AP2 results in induction of growth arrest and apoptosis.Fig. 8Western analysis of Ad-AP2 virus-infected HCT116 WT and HCT116 p53-/- cells. HCT116 p53 WT (a) or HCT116 p53-/- (b) cells were infected with Ad-LacZ or Ad-AP2 at 20 MOI. After the indicated time points of virus infection, the total cell extracts were prepared and subjected to Western analysis for PARP, p21WAF1/CIP1, AP-2α, p53, and actin proteins as described under “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Ad-AP2 Inhibits the Growth and Increases Chemosensitivity of Cancer Cells—To assay the cytotoxic potential of the AP-2α, the ability of Ad-AP2 to inhibit the growth of six different cancer cell lines, which differ in p53 status, was analyzed.

SW480, a human colon carcinoma cell line, harbors mutant p53. In HeLa cells, which is a cervical cancer-derived cell line, p53 is degraded because of the presence of human papilloma virus oncogene E6."
https://openalex.org/W1978964592,"IQ motifs are found in diverse families of calmodulin (CaM)-binding proteins. Some of these, like PEP-19 and RC3, are highly abundant in neuronal tissues, but being devoid of catalytic activity, their biological roles are not understood. We hypothesized that these IQ motif proteins might have unique effects on the Ca2+ binding properties of CaM, since they bind to CaM in the presence or absence of Ca2+. Here we show that PEP-19 accelerates by 40 to 50-fold both the slow association and dissociation of Ca2+ from the C-domain of free CaM, and we identify the sites of interaction between CaM and PEP-19 using NMR. Importantly, we demonstrate that PEP-19 can also increase the rate of dissociation of Ca2+ from CaM when bound to intact CaM-dependent protein kinase II. Thus, PEP-19, and presumably similar members of the IQ family of proteins, has the potential to alter the Ca2+-binding dynamics of free CaM and CaM that is bound to other target proteins. Since Ca2+ binding to the C-domain of CaM is the rate-limiting step for activation of CaM-dependent enzymes, the data reveal a new concept of importance in understanding the temporal dynamics of Ca2+-dependent cell signaling.

Fluctuation in Ca2+ levels defined by its amplitude and frequency of oscillation provides a universal intracellular signal, which can be highly variable between cells or even within different compartments of the same cell (1.Berridge M.J.

For example, the kinetics of Ca2+ binding to the C-domain of CaM are too slow (3.Johnson J.D. Snyder C. Walsh C. Flynn M. J. Biol.

This has focused attention on mechanisms that could help tune the Ca2+ binding properties of CaM to expand its potential to respond to specific Ca2+ signals. Thus far, changes in the Ca2+ binding properties of CaM have been observed only as an increase in affinity due to a decrease in the Ca2+ dissociation rate upon binding Ca2+-CaM to target proteins and peptides (3.Johnson J.D.

The magnitude of this effect is dependent on a given target enzyme and can be so large as to promote constitutive association of CaM with targets even at basal Ca2+ levels. calmodulin small, neuronal IQ motif protein neuromodulin neurogranin 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy CaM-dependent protein kinase II α 5-[N-(iodoacetamidoethyl)amino]naphthalene-1-sulfonate. It would be of great functional significance if proteins were discovered that could increase, rather than decrease, the rate of dissociation of Ca2+ from free or target-bound CaM or potentially modulate the rate of Ca2+ association. This would be particularly important for the C-domain of CaM, which exhibits Ca2+ binding kinetics that are too slow to respond to rapid Ca2+ transients such as those found in excitable cells. Our search for such proteins led to analysis of the small, neuronal IQ motif proteins, or SNIQs, that include neuromodulin (Nm or GAP-43), neurogranin (Ng or RC3), and PEP-19 (for review see, Refs. 10.Slemmon J.R. Feng B. Erhardt J.A. Mol. Neurobiol. 2001; 22: 99-113Crossref Google Scholar and 11.Gerendasy D.D. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 58: 107-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The SNIQs are highly abundant (up to 50 μm) in neuronal tissues but have no known catalytic activity. Their ability to bind to apo-CaM supports the idea that SNIQs modulate effective levels and/or distribution of free CaM at basal Ca2+ levels (12.Liu Y.C. Storm D.R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1990; 11: 107-111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). However, Nm binds CaM equally well in the presence or absence of Ca2+ at physiological salt concentrations (13.Alexander K.A. Cimler B.M. Meier K.E. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6108-6113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We hypothesized that these CaM binding properties could potentially affect the rates of both association and dissociation of Ca2+ from CaM and thus provide an alternate function for the SNIQs that could have pervasive effects on CaM activity. We show here that PEP-19 accelerates the rates of association and dissociation of Ca2+ from the C-domain of free CaM, and of CaM when bound to CaM-dependent protein kinase II α (CKIIα). Expression of PEP-19 —A human cDNA for PEP-19 was purchased from ResGen (IMAGE expressed sequence tag clone 4792589). The amino acid coding reading for PEP-19 was amplified using a 5′-primer (GTTGAGTTAGAGCCACCATGGCTGAGCGACAAGGTGC), the 3′-primer (CGGAACTGCTAGCTTGGATCCATCAGGACTGAGACCCAGCC), and subcloned into the NcoI and BamHI sites of the pET23d expression plasmid. The N terminus was modified from MSERQ to MAERQ to enhance expression levels of the recombinant protein. Isolation of CaM and PEP-19 —Recombinant CaM was expressed and isolated as described previously (14.Putkey J.A. Waxham M.N. J. Biol.

(Leatherhead, UK) model SX.18 MV sequential stopped-flow spectrofluorimeter with a 150-watt xenon/mercury lamp and a dead time of 1.7 ms. We found that concentrations of 2 μm CaM, 20 μm Ca2+, and 300 μm Quin-2 were sufficient to fully extract Ca2+ from CaM complexes and the CaM ·PEP-19 complex. All solutions contained a base buffer of 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl. Fluorescence from Quin-2 was detected using excitation wavelengths of 334 or 334.5 nm and an Oriel emission cut-off filter 51282. Tyrosine fluorescence was detected using an excitation wavelength of 266 nm and Oriel filter 51662. All stopped-flow experiments were done at room temperature (23 °C). CaMDANS was excited at 334 nm, and fluorescence was monitored at 485 nm. NMR Methodology—Decalcified [15N]CaM was lyophilized and resuspended to 0.5 mm in decalcified 100 mm KCl, 5% D2O. Calcium was added to 20 mm, and the pH of the sample was adjusted to 6.3. Titration of PEP-19 was done by additions from an 8 mm stock prepared in water. All NMR experiments were collected on a DRX 600 MHz spectrometer instrument using a 5 mm TXI probe at 25 °C for apo-[15N]CaM and 47 °C for Ca2+-[15N]CaM. Data were processed using Accelrys Felix 2002 software. Amide chemical shifts of Ca2+-CaM were assigned by comparison with literature reports (17.Ikura M. Kay L.E. Bax A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4659-4667Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar) and confirmed by three-dimensional 15N-edited NOESY and HNCA experiments. Details and additional experimental procedures can be found in the on-line version of this article. CaM has four Ca2+ binding sites: two in the N-domain and two in the C-domain. Fig. 1A shows the rate of dissociation of Ca2+ from CaM detected using the Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent dye Quin-2. Release of Ca2+ from the N-domain is too rapid (>1000 s–1) to observe using conventional stopped-flow at room temperature (4.Persechini A. White H.D. Gansz K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 62-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Thus, only the release of 2 mol of Ca2+ is observed per mol of free CaM with a koff of 8.5 s–1, which is identical to the value reported by Brown et al. (6.Brown S.E. Martin S.R. Bayley P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3389-3397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This observed rate of release of Ca2+ was increased by a factor of 50 in the presence of PEP-19. Tyrosine fluorescence is a marker for Ca2+ binding to the C-domain of CaM. The inset to Fig. 1A uses Tyr fluorescence to confirm that PEP-19, which has no Tyr residues, greatly accelerates the dissociation of Ca2+ from the C-domain of CaM. Fig. 1B and Table I show that PEP-19 has little effect on equilibrium Ca2+ binding to CaM. Given that PEP-19 increases the rate of dissociation of Ca2+ from the C-domain of CaM, the rate of association of Ca2+ must also be accelerated by PEP-19 to explain the unchanged equilibrium binding constant. We experimentally verified this relationship by measuring the rate of association of Ca2+ with the C-domain of CaM using Tyr fluorescence. It is clear from the inset to Fig. 1B that the rate of association of Ca2+ with the C-domain of CaM is significantly increased by PEP-19. Table I summarizes the respective Ca2+ binding affinities and kinetic rate constants of N- and C-domains of CaM in the presence and absence of PEP-19. Values for the N- and C-domain of free CaM shown in Table I are consistent with those reported previously by others (3.Johnson J.D. Snyder C. Walsh C. Flynn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 761-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 4.Persechini A. White H.D. Gansz K.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 3389-3397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). PEP-19 accelerates the rates of association and dissociation of Ca2+ at the C-domain of CaM 40–50-fold but has essentially no effect on the equilibrium Ca2+ binding constants for either the N- or C-domain.Table IEffect of PEP-19 on calcium binding properties of calmodulinKeqkoffkonm-1 × 104s-1m-1 s-1 × 106N-domain-PEP199.1 ± 1.3>1000>100+PEP198.7 ± 1.1>1000>100C-domain-PEP1950 ± 2.58.5 ± 0.24+PEP1938 ± 4.4430 ± 50170 Open table in a new tab Based on the results in Fig. 1 and Table I, PEP-19 would necessarily bind to the C-domain of CaM. The possibility that PEP-19 can also bind to the N-domain cannot be discounted, although if such binding occurs, it has no apparent effect on the Ca2+ binding properties of the N-domain of CaM. NMR mapping of amide chemical shift perturbations was used to localize sites of interaction between CaM and PEP-19. The effect of PEP-19 on CaM amide chemical shifts was determined by collecting 1H-15N HSQC spectra after sequential additions of PEP-19 to either 15N-labeled apo- or Ca2+-bound CaM. Effects of PEP-19 were restricted to amide chemical shifts in the C-domain of both apo- and Ca2+-CaM. Association of PEP-19 with apo-CaM showed characteristics of slow and intermediate exchange on the NMR time scale (data not shown), which prevented assignment of amide chemical shifts by titration with PEP-19. Association of PEP-19 with Ca2+-CaM showed characteristics of fast exchange and a dominant Ca2+-CaM/PEP-19 conformer. This allowed assignment of CaM amides in the complex of Ca2+-CaM ·PEP-19 by titration of Ca2+-CaM with PEP-19 as illustrated in the inset to Fig. 2A. The histogram in Fig. 2A summarizes the effect of PEP-19 on CaM amide chemical shifts. All changes of greater than 1 S.D. are found in the C-domain and are clustered in two regions. The first cluster includes amino acids 105–117 spanning helix F and the linker between helix F and G. Binding of PEP-19 to this region on CaM could be responsible for affecting the Ca2+ binding properties of sites III and IV. The second cluster includes amino acids 142–148 at the very C terminus of CaM. Fig. 2B illustrates the location of these clusters on the solvent accessible surface of the C-domain of Ca2+-CaM. The structure on the left emphasizes the hydrophobic surface of CaM shown in blue, which is now known to play a critical role in binding a variety of Ca2+-dependent CaM-binding proteins (18.Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Cell. 2002; 108: 739-742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Residues that are affected by PEP-19 are shown in red. This structure was rotated 180° to obtain the view on the right. Helix F is indicated in both views as a point of reference. Two regions on CaM are affected by PEP-19. Although these surfaces appear to be distinct, and to border the central portion of the hydrophobic pocket, this analysis does not account for potential conformational changes in CaM induced by PEP-19, which could present a contiguous binding surface. Nevertheless, it is clear from the two views of CaM that the most expansive surface that is affected by PEP-19 includes helix F and extends well away from the hydrophobic pocket. This suggests that PEP-19 could form ternary complexes with CaM and other binding proteins and potentially affect the Ca2+ binding properties of the complex. We used recombinant CaM-dependent protein kinases II α (CKIIα) to determine the potential of PEP-19 to affect the Ca2+ binding properties of CaM when bound to another target protein. CKIIα binds CaM with high affinity (Kd 10–7 to 10–8m) that can be further enhanced by CaM-dependent autophosphorylation, but CaM/CKIIα is fully active in the absence of autophosphorylation (19.Hudmon A. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 473-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Fig. 1C shows that 4 mol of Ca2+/mol of CaM are released when CaM is bound to CKIIα, with rate constants of 0.9 and 12 s–1, respectively. Thus, association of CaM with CKIIα must greatly slow the release of Ca2+ from the N-domain, since this event is too fast to be observed with free CaM. We cannot currently assign these two rates to specific domains in CaM, however, the presence of PEP-19 greatly increased the fast rate from 12 to ∼400 s–1. The results in Fig. 1C could be due to formation of a ternary complex between CaM, CKIIα, and PEP-19 or due to displacement of CaM from CKIIα by PEP-19. We used IAEDANS-labeled CaM (CaMDANS) to distinguish between these possibilities. Fluorescence from CaMDANS is increased upon binding to CKIIα (14.Putkey J.A. Waxham M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29619-29623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 20.Waxham M.N. Tsai A.-L. Putkey J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17579-17584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), but association with PEP-19 has little effect on fluorescence intensity. If PEP-19 displaced CaMDANS from CKIIα, then it should reverse the CKIIα-induced increase in fluorescence. The results of this experiment are shown in the inset to Fig. 1C. Addition of up to 40 μm PEP-19 does not reverse the CKIIα-induced increase in fluorescence from CaMDANS, which supports the formation of a ternary complex between CaM, CKIIα, and PEP-19. Together, these data demonstrate that PEP-19 can affect the kinetics of Ca2+ binding to CaM even when it is bound to another protein. The rates of association and dissociation of Ca2+ at the C-domain of CaM are up to 2 orders of magnitude slower than the N-domain (see Table I). Thus, Ca2+ binding to the C-domain is rate-limiting for activation of targets that require Ca2+-saturated CaM and will dictate its temporal response to Ca2+ signals. The effect of PEP-19 on the C-domain of CaM, and localization of PEP-19 and other SNIQs to neurons, suggest that these proteins play a role in modulating the Ca2+ binding properties of CaM so it can respond to challenging Ca2+ signals, such as high frequency action potentials, which control Ca2+-dependent processes in pre and post-synaptic compartments. Fig. 3 simulates the effect of PEP-19 on Ca2+ binding to the C-domain of CaM during a train of Ca2+ pulses of 50 Hz and amplitude of 1.5 μm. In the absence of PEP-19, intrinsic slow on and off Ca2+ binding kinetics lead to a gradual increase in the percent saturation of the C-domain of CaM with Ca2+. In the presence of PEP-19, Ca2+ binding to the C-domain of free CaM more closely parallels the rise and fall of free Ca2+. This illustrates that the C-domain of CaM could respond to Ca2+ in distinct ways depending on the presence or absence of PEP-19. The effect of other SNIQs on CaM will likely be finetuned by differences in primary sequences. For example, Ng accelerates the dissociation of Ca2+ from CaM but has little effect on the association rate, which results in decreasing the overall Ca2+ binding affinity of the C-domain of CaM. 2T. R. Gaertner, J. A. Putkey, and M. N. Waxham, unpublished observation. Post-translational modification, such as phosphorylation of Ng and Nm that inhibits association with CaM (13.Alexander K.A. Cimler B.M. Meier K.E. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6108-6113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Baudier J. Deloulme J.C. Van Dorsselaer A. Black D. Matthes H.W.D. J. Biol.

These data and simulations emphasize that the influence of PEP-19, and other proteins with similar activity toward CaM, should be incorporated into models of neuronal Ca2+ dynamics and CaM activation that use stochastic approaches to account for CaM diffusion and spatial constraints. Current structural models for the regulation of target proteins by CaM invoke distinct functions for its N- and C-domains. IQ CaM binding motifs found in diverse proteins may help facilitate these interactions. For example, Ca2+-dependent facilitation and inactivation of L-type and P/Q-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (23.Lee A. Wong S.T. Gallagher D. Li B. Storm D.R. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A.

Nature. 2001; 411: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) is due largely to the temporal and differential binding of the N- and C-domains of CaM to the IQ motif of these channel proteins. DeMaria et al. (27.DeMaria C.D. Soong T.W. Alseikhan B.A. Alvania R.S. Yue D.T. Nature. 2001; 411: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) proposed that the C-domain of CaM mediates channel facilitation by responding to millisecond spike-like elevations in local Ca2+ that result from opening of individual channels. The data presented here suggest that the IQ motif in voltage-operated Ca2+ channels could modulate the Ca2+ binding properties of the C-domain of CaM such that it can appropriately respond to calcium spikes. Calcium binding is the fundamental property of CaM that allows it to function as a central regulatory protein in a plethora of signal transduction pathways. From a general perspective, the ability of CaM/protein interactions to modulate the Ca2+ binding properties of CaM should be broadly recognized as an important facet of the overall mechanism of action of CaM. The modulator activity of CaM-binding proteins can achieve a tremendous dynamic range of Ca2+ binding kinetics. For example, the rate of dissociation of Ca2+ from the C-domain of CaM bound to myosin light chain kinase (3.Johnson J.D. Snyder C. Walsh C. Flynn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 761-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) is at least 1000-fold slower than when CaM is bound to PEP-19. The ability of PEP-19 to affect the Ca2+ binding properties of CaM when bound to other target proteins provides another dimension of functionality in that it has the potential to antagonize target-induced increases in the Ca2+ binding affinity of CaM. The potential for PEP-19 to overcome rate-limiting binding of Ca2+ to the C-domain of CaM would make it analogous to GTPase-activating proteins, regulators of G-proteins signaling, and guanine nucleotide exchange factors in that they all overcome rate-limiting steps to allow regulatory proteins to act in biologically meaningful time frames. Potential Ca2+-binding modulator activity that is targeted toward other Ca2+-dependent regulatory proteins may play important roles in a variety of Ca2+ signaling pathways. In summary, the data presented here provide evidence for a new biological role for PEP-19 as a modulator of the Ca2+ binding properties of CaM. This activity could have broad effects on the activation of CaM-dependent proteins. PEP-19, and other homologous IQ motif CaM binding proteins with similar activity, would be important additions to the Ca2+-signaling toolkit (1.Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Roderick H.L. Nat. Rev. 2003; 4: 517-525Crossref Scopus (4256) Google Scholar) used to assemble Ca2+/CaM signaling systems with different spatial and temporal dynamics. We thank Drs.

https://openalex.org/W2044218758,"We have studied the functional steps by which Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondria can synthesize FAD from cytosolic riboflavin (Rf). Riboflavin uptake into mitochondria took place via a mechanism that is consistent with the existence of (at least two) carrier systems. FAD was synthesized inside mitochondria by a mitochondrial FAD synthetase (EC 2.7.7.2), and it was exported into the cytosol via an export system that was inhibited by lumiflavin, and which was different from the riboflavin uptake system. To understand the role of the putative mitochondrial FAD carrier, Flx1p, in this pathway, an flx1Δ mutant strain was constructed. Coupled mitochondria isolated from flx1Δ mutant cells were compared with wild-type mitochondria with respect to the capability to take up Rf, to synthesize FAD from it, and to export FAD into the extramitochondrial phase. Mitochondria isolated from flx1Δ mutant cells specifically lost the ability to export FAD, but did not lose the ability to take up Rf, FAD, or FMN and to synthesize FAD from Rf. Hence, Flx1p is proposed to be the mitochondrial FAD export carrier. Moreover, deletion of the FLX1 gene resulted in a specific reduction of the activities of mitochondrial lipoamide dehydrogenase and succinate dehydrogenase, which are FAD-binding enzymes. For the flavoprotein subunit of succinate dehydrogenase we could demonstrate that this was not due to a changed level of mitochondrial FAD or to a change in the degree of flavinylation of the protein. Instead, the amount of the flavoprotein subunit of succinate dehydrogenase was strongly reduced, indicating an additional regulatory role for Flx1p in protein synthesis or degradation.

The mechanism by which mitochondria obtain their own flavin cofactors is an interesting point of investigation because FMN and FAD are mainly located in mitochondria, where they act as redox cofactors of a number of dehydrogenases and oxidases that play a crucial role in both bioenergetics and cellular regulation (for reviews see Refs. 1.McCormick D.B. Physiol. Reviews. 1989; 69: 1170-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar and 2.Lipton S.A Bossy-Wetzel E. Cell. 2002; 111: 147-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). As far as mammalian mitochondria are concerned, we have demonstrated that in rat liver the main source of intramitochondrial flavin cofactors is riboflavin (Rf) 1The abbreviations used are: Rf, riboflavin; SCM, Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondria; DASPMI, 2-(4-dimetylaminostyryl)-N-methylpyridinium iodide; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; CS, citrate synthetase; PDC, pyruvate decarboxylase; LPDH, lipoamide dehydrogenase; Fp, flavoprotein; SDH, succinate dehydrogenase; SDH-Fp, flavoprotein subunit of succinate dehydrogenase; PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase. taken up from the cytosol. FAD synthesis occurs inside the organelle from imported Rf and mitochondrial ATP, consistent with the presence of a mitochondrial riboflavin kinase (EC 2.7.1.26) and an FAD synthetase (EC 2.7.7.2) (3.Barile M. Passarella S. Bertoldi A. Quagliariello E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 305: 442-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 4.Barile M. Brizio C. Valenti D. De Virgilio C. Passarella S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4888-4900Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Newly synthesized FAD can be either efficiently incorporated into newly imported apo-flavoproteins (5.Brizio C. Otto A. Brandsch R. Passarella S. Barile M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4346-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 6.Brizio C. Barile M. Brandsch R. FEBS Lett. 2002; 522: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) or can be exported into the outer mitochondrial compartments, where it is reconverted to Rf by FAD pyrophosphatase (EC 3.6.1.18) and FMN phosphohydrolase (EC 3.1.3.2) in a recycling pathway, i.e. the Rf-FAD cycle (4.Barile M. Brizio C. Valenti D. De Virgilio C. Passarella S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4888-4900Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 7.Barile M. Brizio C. De Virgilio C. Delfine S. Quagliariello E. Passarella S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 777-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This novel mitochondrial pathway is assumed to play a central role in cellular Rf homeostasis and in flavoprotein biogenesis (5.Brizio C. Otto A. Brandsch R. Passarella S. Barile M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4346-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 8.Vergani L. Barile M. Angelini C. Burlina A.B. Nijtmans L. Freda M.P. Brizio C. Zerbetto E. Dabbeni-Sala F. Brain. 1999; 122: 2401-2411Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The origin of flavin cofactors in yeast mitochondria is still controversially discussed. It has been reported that yeast mitochondria do not contain their own FAD synthetase activity and that FAD is synthesized in the cytosol by Fad1p (9.Wu M. Repetto B. Glerum D.M. Tzagoloff A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 264-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Thus, mitochondria have been supposed to get their FAD from the cytosol via an FAD uptake system, encoded by the FLX1 gene, a member of the mitochondrial carrier family (10.Tzagoloff A. Jang J. Glerum M. Wu M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7392-7397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). On the other hand, we have proposed that in yeast as well as in mammals Rf imported from the cytosol is the main source of mitochondrial flavin cofactors. Our observations implied a mitochondrial localization for both riboflavin kinase and FAD synthetase (11.Pallotta M.L. Brizio C. Fratianni A. De Virgilio C. Barile M. Passarella S. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Consistently, the mitochondrial localization of riboflavin kinase, encoded by the FMN1 gene, has been recently confirmed by immunoblotting analysis (12.Santos M.A. Jimenez A. Revuelta J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28618-28624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In order to elucidate further the mechanism by which Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondria (SCM) can provide their own flavin cofactors, Rf uptake and metabolism were studied in intact organelles. Moreover, the activity of FAD synthetase has been determined in solubilized mitochondria. To clarify the role of the Flx1p carrier in this pathway, mitochondria isolated from flx1Δ mutant cells were compared with wild-type mitochondria with respect to the ability to take up Rf, to synthesize FAD, and to export it out of the mitochondria. Moreover, the physiological role of Flx1p in maintaining the homeostasis of flavin cofactors has been studied as well as its influence on the amounts of FAD-binding enzymes. Materials—All reagents and enzymes were from Sigma, zymolyase from ICN, and Bacto yeast extract from Difco. Mitochondrial substrates were used as Tris salts at pH 7.0. Solvents and salts used for HPLC were from Baker. Yeast Strain, Media, and Growth Conditions—The wild-type S. cerevisiae strain (EBY157A, genotype MATα ura 3–52 MAL2–8c SUC2 p426MET25) used in this work is derived from the CEN.PK series of yeast strains and was obtained from P. Koetter (Institut fuer Mikrobiologie, Goethe-Universitaet Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany). Cells were grown aerobically at 28 °C with constant shaking in a semisynthetic liquid medium (3 g/l yeast extract, 1 g/l KH2PO4, 1 g/l NH4Cl, 0.5 g/l NaCl, 0.5 g/l CaCl2·2H2O, 0.6 g/l MgCl2·6H2O, 20 mg/l uracil, 0.05% glucose) supplemented with 2% ethanol or 2% glycerol as the carbon source. The pH of the medium was adjusted to 5.5 with HCl. Mitochondrial functionality in living cells was assessed by fluorescence microscopy, using the vital fluorescent dye 2-(4-dimetylaminostyryl)-N-methylpyridinium iodide (DASPMI) as described in Ref. 13.Rinaldi T.

Construction of an flx1Δ Mutant Strain—An flx1Δ mutant strain was constructed by using a modification of the PCR targeting technique (14.Boles E. de Jong-Gubbels P. Pronk J.T. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 80: 2875-2882Crossref Google Scholar). A plasmid pUG6 (15.Güldener U. Heck S. Diedler T. Beinhauer J. Hegemann J.H.

For this purpose, appropriated oligonucleotides were constructed: S1-FLX1, 5′-ATGGTCGATCACCAGTGGACGCCACTGCAGAAGGAGGTTATCATCTCAGGTTTCGTACGCTGCAGGTCGAC-3′; and S22-FLX1, 5′-TTTATCGTTTGATATTTACAAGAAATTAAATCTATCATATAGCCTTTATGCATAGGCCACTAGTGGATCTG-3′. Short flanking homology regions allowed a specific recombination between wild-type chromosomal DNA containing the FLX1 gene and linear DNA containing kanMX. The transformation of EBY157A strain was done by electroporation. The mutant yeast cells (EBY167A, genotype MATα ura 3–52 MAL2–8c SUC2, flx1Δ:: kanMX) were selected for resistance to G418. Construction of Plasmid—The FLX1 gene was cloned by PCR with a pair of primers designed to amplify a DNA fragment enclosing the complete FLX1-open reading frame with its 5′ and 3′ regulatory regions. The amplified fragment, cleaved with BglII and PvuII, was cloned into the high-copy-number vector YEplac195 (16.Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2522) Google Scholar) with a URA3 marker, resulting in plasmid YEpFLX1. The transformation of the EBY167A S. cerevisiae strain was done by electroporation. Preparation of Spheroplasts and Mitochondria and Oxygen Uptake Measurements—Spheroplasts were prepared using zymolyase and mitochondria were isolated according to (17.Daum G. Bohn P.C. Schaltz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13028-13033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondrial protein was determined according to (18.Waddel W.J. Hill C. J. Lab. Clin.

Oxygen uptake measurements were carried out using a Gilson oxygraph as described previously (11.Pallotta M.L. Brizio C. Fratianni A. De Virgilio C. Barile M. Passarella S.

Flavin Uptake and Metabolism—Mitochondria (0.1–0.2 mg protein), isolated from cells grown on glycerol-containing medium, were incubated at 2 °C in 500 μl of a medium consisting of 0.6 m mannitol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, 1 mm MgCl2. 1 min later, Rf, FAD, or FMN were added. At the appropriate time, the uptake reaction was stopped by rapid centrifugation. Rf, FMN, and FAD content of supernatants and pellets were measured in aliquots (5–80 μl) of neutralized perchloric extracts by means of HPLC (Gilson HPLC system including a model 306 pump and a model 307 pump equipped with a Kontron Instruments SFM 25 fluorimeter and Unipoint system software), and corrected for endogenous flavin content, essentially as described in Refs. 4.Barile M.

Passarella S. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar. The amount of flavin actually taken up into the organelle was calculated after correction made for molecules present in the adherent space and/or nonspecifically bound to the membranes, as described elsewhere (4.Barile M. Brizio C. Valenti D. De Virgilio C. Passarella S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4888-4900Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 20.Said H.M. McCloud E. Yanagawa N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1236: 244-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). FAD Synthetase Activity Assay—SCM (0.015–0.06 mg protein) were solubilized by treatment with Lubrol PX (0.3 mg/mg protein) for 15 min at 0 °C and pre-incubated for 1 min at 37 °C in 100 μl of a medium consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2 in the presence of 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate. Then, FMN (10 μm) and ATP (5 mm) were added or not. After 2 min of incubation, the reaction was stopped by boiling at 100 °C for 3 min followed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 4 min at 4 °C. The amount of FAD present in the mitochondrial extracts was measured enzymatically, as described in Refs. 4.Barile M. Brizio C. Valenti D. De Virgilio C. Passarella S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4888-4900Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar and 11.Pallotta M.L. Brizio C. Fratianni A. De Virgilio C. Barile M. Passarella S. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar. Briefly, the amount of FAD was determined by revealing the reconstituted holo-d-amino acid oxidase activity derived from the FAD binding to the apo-d-amino acid oxidase, using d-alanine (25 mm) as substrate. The oxidation of NADH in the l-lactate dehydrogenase coupled reaction was followed photometrically at 340 nm by means of a PerkinElmer λ19 spectrophotometer and its rate calculated as a tangent to the linear part of the progress curve. This rate was proven to be proportional to the FAD concentration. Calibration curves were obtained by using standard FAD solutions added to SCM. Corrections were also made to account for the inhibition due to FMN and ATP added to the assay. Other Enzymatic Assays—Citrate synthetase (CS) and pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) activities were measured as in Refs. 21.Srere P.A. Methods Enzymol. 1969; 13: 3-11Crossref Scopus (2036) Google Scholar and 22.van Urk H. Schipper D. Breedveld G.J. Mak P.R. Scheffers W.A. van Dijken J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 992: 78-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar. Lipoamide dehydrogenase (LPDH) activity was assayed as reported in Ref. 23.Schnaitman C. Greenawalt J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1968; 38: 158-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar, and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity was measured as the reduction rate of 2,6-dichlorophenol-indophenol in the presence of phenazine methosulfate, as reported in Ref. 24.King T.E. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 322-331Crossref Scopus (526) Google Scholar. Western Blotting—Proteins from SCM (0.04 mg) were separated by SDS-PAGE, according to Ref. 25.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar, and transferred electrophoretically onto a nitrocellulose membrane using a trans-blot semidry electrophoretic transfer cell (Sigma). The immobilized proteins were incubated overnight with a 1000-fold dilution of the specific polyclonal antibodies against FAD covalently bound to proteins (i.e. α-Fp antibodies containing antiserum raised in rabbits with the covalently flavinylated bacterial enzyme 6-hydroxy-d-nicotine oxidase, a kind gift from Prof. R. Brandsch, Freiburg, Germany) (26.Cicek G. Schiltz E. Hess D. Staiger G. Brandsch R. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2002; 128: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Immunoreactive materials were visualized with the aid of a secondary alkaline phosphatase conjugated anti-rabbit IgG. Quantitative evaluations were carried by densitometric analysis using the Chemi Doc system (Bio-Rad). UV-fluorescence Analysis—Proteins from SCM (0.04 mg) were separated by SDS-PAGE, then the unstained gel was incubated for 1 h in 10% acetic acid and inspected on an UV-transilluminator system. Upon illumination with UV light, the flavinylated flavoprotein subunit of SDH (SDH-Fp) was visible because of the fluorescence of the covalently bound flavin. Protein bands on the gel were then stained with Coomassie Blue. Quantitative evaluations were carried using the Chemi Doc system (Bio-Rad). Rf Uptake and FAD Synthesis in Isolated Intact SCM—To gain insight into the mechanism by which SCM can provide their own flavin cofactors, isolated mitochondria (from the wild-type strain EBY157A) were incubated with Rf in two different concentration ranges, i.e. 0–2.5 μm (Fig. 1A) and 0–30 μm (Fig. 1B). Then, the amounts of flavins in the acid-extractable fraction of both mitochondrial pellets and supernatants were measured by HPLC and compared with those of parallel samples in which no Rf was added. Experimental data were collected within the initial linear range of Rf uptake rates (i.e. 20 s incubation), and were corrected for adherent/bound vitamin as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data were expressed as rates of flavin transport in dependence on Rf concentration. In the whole range of concentrations used (Fig. 1, A and B), Rf transport was accompanied by FAD formation (see also Refs. 4.Barile M. Brizio C. Valenti D. De Virgilio C. Passarella S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4888-4900Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar and 11.Pallotta M.L. Brizio C. Fratianni A. De Virgilio C. Barile M. Passarella S. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), which resulted in the export of FAD into the extramitochondrial phase. A residual FAD fraction was retained in the pellet. Conversely, no significant variation in FMN content was observed. Due to the rapid conversion of Rf into FAD (that could be prevented neither by adding ADP plus oligomycin, nor by changing the temperature and the time of incubation of mitochondria), a detailed study of the kinetics of Rf uptake was prevented. Hence, the Rf determined in the pellet under these conditions is a transient value, lower than the true amount of Rf taken up. Thus, the time dependence of Rf increase in the pellet does not actually reflect a true Rf uptake rate. Despite the limitation imposed by this condition, the dependence of the apparent Rf uptake rate on vitamin concentration showed saturation characteristics (Fig. 1A). The sigmoidal feature of the curve probably depends on the combinations between transport and synthesis processes, rather than indicating true cooperativity. Nevertheless, data fitting was performed by means of Grafit software according to allosteric kinetics, and the resulting kinetic parameters, expressed as “pseudo” S0.5 and Vmax, were 1.2 μm and 28 pmol × min–1 × (mg protein)–1, respectively. At the lower concentration of Rf used (0.2 μm, Fig. 1A), FAD was synthesized with a rate of about 75 pmol × min–1 × (mg protein)–1 and it was entirely retained in the pellet. At higher Rf concentrations (0.4–2 μm range, in Fig. 1A), virtually no FAD could be detected in the pellet and the rate of FAD formation was described by the rate of FAD export, which reached a maximum of about 250 pmol × min–1 × (mg protein)–1 at 2 μm. When Rf concentration was increased up to 30 μm (Fig. 1B), the dependence of the apparent Rf uptake rate on the extramitochondrial vitamin concentration showed again a sigmoidal shape. The pseudo S0.5 and Vmax values were 18 μm and 7750 pmol × min–1 × (mg protein)–1, respectively. The rate of FAD formation starting from imported Rf increased with increasing external concentration of the vitamin, with a significant fraction of FAD remaining in the pellet. Under these conditions the rate of FAD export reached a maximum of about 600 pmol × min–1 × (mg protein)–1 at 10 μm Rf and it was inhibited at higher Rf concentrations. Despite the limitations described, these results strongly favor the existence of (at least) two different transport systems involved in Rf uptake into/FAD export out of mitochondria. Moreover, they imply the existence of an FAD synthetase activity inside mitochondria. To prove the existence of FAD synthetase in SCM, solubilized mitochondria were incubated with or without the substrates of FAD synthetase, i.e. FMN and ATP, and the FAD synthesis rate was measured enzymatically as in Refs. 4.Barile M. Brizio C. Valenti D. De Virgilio C. Passarella S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4888-4900Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar and 11.Pallotta M.L. Brizio C. Fratianni A. De Virgilio C. Barile M. Passarella S. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar. A typical experiment is shown in Fig. 2. When solubilized SCM were incubated in the absence of substrates, a decrease of NADH absorbance was observed. Its rate increased with time up to a constant value (0.004 ΔA × min–1 after 6 min). This value corresponded to ∼100 pmol × (mg protein)–1 mitochondrial endogenous FAD, which is loosely and/or not bound to protein. When solubilized SCM were added with FMN and ATP for 2 min, the rate of the decrease in absorbance significantly increased (0.010 ΔA × min–1). This value corresponded to about 400 pmol × (mg protein)–1 of FAD. By subtracting the former FAD value from the latter, 300 pmol × (mg protein)–1 of newly synthesized FAD were calculated as a result of 2 min incubation with the substrate pair of FAD synthetase. It should be noted that in the FAD synthetase assay, sodium pyrophosphate was present to prevent FMN dephosphorylation, 2M. Barile, unpublished results. which competes with FAD synthesis and which is possibly the result of an FMN phosphohydrolase previously observed in SCM and rat liver mitochondria (10.Tzagoloff A.

Passarella S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 777-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The amount of FAD synthesized in solubilized SCM starting from FMN and ATP increased with the incubation time, reaching a maximum at 5 min incubation. Incubation for a longer time resulted in a progressive decrease of the newly synthesized FAD, probably due to FAD hydrolysis via FAD pyrophosphatase (7.Barile M. Brizio C. De Virgilio C. Delfine S. Quagliariello E. Passarella S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 777-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 8.Vergani L. Barile M. Angelini C. Burlina A.B. Nijtmans L. Freda M.P. Brizio C. Zerbetto E. Dabbeni-Sala F. Brain. 1999; 122: 2401-2411Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The rate of FAD synthesis, as measured in the interval of time in which the amount of newly synthesized FAD increased linearly with time, was found to be 150 ± 63 pmol × min–1 × (mg protein)–1, in three experiments carried out with different mitochondrial preparations. To exclude any contamination from cytosolic proteins, FAD synthesis was assayed in solubilized mitochondria and spheroplasts. FAD synthetase distribution was compared with those of CS and PDC, mitochondrial and cytosolic marker enzymes, respectively. In a typical assay (see the histograms in Fig. 2), the solubilized SCM were proven to synthesize FAD with a specific activity of 85 pmol × min–1 × (mg protein)–1. This value corresponded to about 37% of that measured in the spheroplasts. In the same experiment, the specific activity of PDC measured in the mitochondrial fraction was only 5% of that measured in the spheroplasts. The purity of the mitochondrial fraction was tested by measuring the enrichment of the CS specific activity, which was 4-fold higher than that measured in the spheroplasts. These results demonstrate that besides the cytosolic FAD synthetase, encoded by FAD1 (9.Wu M. Repetto B. Glerum D.M. Tzagoloff A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 264-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), mitochondria also possess an enzyme that performs FAD synthesis from the Rf imported from the cytosol. Involvement of the Flx1p Carrier in FAD Export out of Mitochondria—Due to the proposed absence of FAD synthetase inside mitochondria it had been proposed previously that Flx1p be involved in the mitochondrial import of cytosolically synthesized FAD (10.Tzagoloff A. Jang J. Glerum M. Wu M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7392-7397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To re-evaluate the function of the Flx1p carrier in awareness of the presence of FAD synthetase in SCM, and to gain further insights into the mechanisms of flavin traffic across the mitochondrial membrane, Rf uptake experiments were repeated by using mitochondria isolated from an flx1Δ mutant strain (Fig. 3). As in the wild-type strain, Rf uptake was accompanied by intramitochondrial FAD synthesis, both in 0–2 μm (Fig. 3A) and in 0–30 μm Rf concentration ranges (Fig. 3B), with no significant change of FMN content. Differently from the wild-type strain, no FAD export could be detected in the supernatant of mitochondria from the flx1Δ mutant strain. The dependence of the apparent Rf uptake rate on extramitochondrial Rf concentration in mitochondria from flx1Δ mutant cells (Fig. 3A) showed again saturation characteristics, with pseudo Km and Vmax values equal to 0.9 μm and 27 pmol × min–1 × (mg protein)–1, respectively. A sigmoidal shape curve fitted the data of Rf uptake obtained in the higher concentration interval (Fig. 3B), with pseudo S0.5 and Vmax values of the same extent of that found in the wild-type strain (20 μm and 11900 pmol × min–1 × mg protein–1, respectively). Despite the kinetical limitations, the results obtained with the flx1Δ mutant strain fit the same hypothesis made for the wild-type strain; i.e. (at least) two distinct uptake systems are involved in Rf transport into mitochondria. Moreover, FAD export into the extramitochondrial phase was proven to depend on the activity of a distinct export system, which presumably is the Flx1p carrier. Consistently, it was ascertained that the ability of FAD export, abolished in the mitochondria of the flx1Δ mutant strain, was restored in the mitochondria of the flx1Δ mutant strain transformed with the FLX1 gene on a multicopy plasmid (Fig. 4). A control was made that the inability to export FAD is specifically due to the FLX1 deletion and that it is not an undesired consequence of the poor growth capacity of the cell on the glycerol-containing medium (see below). Therefore, the same experiments were performed with mitochondria isolated from the wild-type and the flx1Δ mutant cells grown on medium containing ethanol as the carbon source. No significant change in Rf uptake efficiency was found, whereas the FAD export ability was reduced up to 80% in the mitochondria from flx1Δ mutant cells (not shown). The involvement of an export system for FAD, which is different from the Rf uptake systems, was further confirmed by studying the inhibitor sensitivity of the transport process. To this aim, the effect of lumiflavin, a Rf analogue able to inhibit plasma membrane transport of the vitamin (25.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar, 27.Said H.M. Ortiz A. Moyer M.P. Yanagawa N. Am. J. Physiol. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 278: 270-276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was studied. Results from a typical experiment carried out with wild-type SCM are shown in Table I. Lumiflavin, which apparently permeates the mitochondrial membrane, was found to significantly reduce the rate of FAD export. At 0.8 μm Rf, the export of FAD was completely inhibited by 15 μm lumiflavin. At 1.5 μm riboflavin, the FAD export rate was inhibited up to 45%. Conversely, lumiflavin did not significantly change the apparent rate of Rf uptake. When the same experiment was repeated by using mitochondria isolated from flx1Δ mutant cells, no effect of lumiflavin was observed both on the apparent Rf uptake rate and on the FAD synthesis rate in the pellet. This result allows us to exclude that lumiflavin inhibits either the Rf uptake system(s) or the intramitochondrial FAD synthetic machinery.Table IInhibition by lumiflavin of FAD export from SCM isolated from wild-type cellsAdditionFlavin transport rateRiboflavin uptakeFAD exportpmol × min-1 × mg protein-1Riboflavin (0.8 μm)4 ± 4119 ± 21Riboflavin (0.8 μm) + Lumiflavin8 ± 30a0, not detectable.Riboflavin (1.5 μm)16 ± 6254 ± 12Riboflavin (1.5 μm) + Lumiflavin28 ± 4140 ± 30a 0, not detectable.

In the present study, we have delineated the mechanism by which Gα16 stimulates STAT3 in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. A constitutively active Gα16 mutant, Gα16QL, stimulated STAT3-dependent luciferase activity as well as the phosphorylation of STAT3 at both Tyr705 and Ser727. Gα16QL-induced STAT3 activation was enhanced by overexpression of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK1), but was inhibited by U0126, a Raf-1 inhibitor, and coexpression of the dominant negative mutants of Ras and Rac1. Inhibition of phospholipase Cβ, protein kinase C, and calmodulin-dependent kinase II by their respective inhibitors also suppressed Gα16QL-induced STAT3 activation. The involvement of tyrosine kinases such as c-Src and Janus kinase 2 and 3 (JAK2 and JAK3) in Gα16QL-induced activation of STAT3 was illustrated by the combined use of selective inhibitors and dominant negative mutants. In contrast, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, p38 MAPK, RhoA, Cdc42, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and the epidermal growth factor receptor did not appear to be required. Similar observations were obtained with human erythroleukemia cells, where STAT3 phosphorylation was stimulated by C5a in a PTX-insensitive manner. Collectively, these results highlight the important regulatory roles of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and c-Src/JAK pathways on the stimulation of STAT3 by activated Gα16. Demonstration of the involvement of different kinases in Gα16QL-induced STAT3 activation supports the involvement of multiple signaling pathways in the regulation of transcription by G proteins.

Demonstration of the involvement of different kinases in Gα16QL-induced STAT3 activation supports the involvement of multiple signaling pathways in the regulation of transcription by G proteins. In addition to their classical roles as second messenger regulators, heterotrimeric G proteins have been implicated as mitogenic signal transmitters. The discovery of activating G protein mutations in various disease states highlights their roles in normal and aberrant growth (1Lyons J. Landis C.A. Harsh G. Vallar L. Grunewald K. Feichtinger H.

To date, a number of Gα subunits have been shown to stimulate mitogenesis and induce neoplastic growth via initiation of intracellular signaling cascades that lead to the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs, 1The abbreviations used are: MAPKsmitogen-activated protein kinasesSTATsignal transducer and activator of transcriptionJAKJanus kinasev-Srcviral Srcc-Srccellular SrcPDGFplatelet-derived growth factorJNKc-Jun N-terminal kinaseGPCRsG protein-coupled receptorsERKextracellular signal-regulated kinasePI3Kphosphatidylinositol 3-kinasePKCprotein kinase CPTXPertussis toxinMEKMAPK/ERK kinasePLCβphospholipase CβCaMKIIcalmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIEGFepidermal growth factor.

Zamarripa J. Blumberg D. Maue R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 648-656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to MAPKs, other critical molecules such as signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) have also been shown to participate in the transduction of proliferative signals (4Ram P.T. Horvath C.M. Iyengar R. Science. 2000; 287: 142-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). mitogen-activated protein kinases signal transducer and activator of transcription Janus kinase viral Src cellular Src platelet-derived growth factor c-Jun N-terminal kinase G protein-coupled receptors extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase protein kinase C Pertussis toxin MAPK/ERK kinase phospholipase Cβ calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II epidermal growth factor. STATs are latent cytoplasmic transcription factors that transduce signals from the cell membrane to the nucleus upon tyrosine phosphorylation (5Darnall Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3401) Google Scholar). They were first identified as mediators of cellular responses to cytokines (6Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (5062) Google Scholar), but later it became apparent that they are also involved in mitogenic growth factor signaling (7Schindler C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar). Binding of cytokines or growth factors to their cognate receptors leads to receptor dimerization and activation of receptor-associated Janus kinases (JAKs), resulting in the recruitment and homo- or heterodimerization of STAT proteins. Activated STAT proteins are then translocated to the nucleus to regulate gene expression. STAT activation by other non-receptor tyrosine kinases has also been demonstrated. Transformation of mammalian fibroblasts by viral Src (v-Src) specifically induces constitutive activation of STAT3 (8Cao X. Tay A. Guy G.R. Tan Y.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1595-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Cellular Src (c-Src) tyrosine kinase is involved in the activation of both STAT1 and STAT3 in platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-stimulated NIH-3T3 cells (9Cirri P. Chiarugi P. Marra F. Raugei G. Camici G. Manao G. Ramponi G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 493-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Additionally, it has recently been demonstrated that MAPKs can phosphorylate Ser727 on STAT3 to modulate its transcriptional activity (10Chung J. Uchida E. Grammer T.C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6508-6516Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar), while activation of p38 MAPK and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) is thought to be required for v-Src activation of STAT3 (11Turkson J. Bowman T. Adnane J. Zhang Y. Djeu J.Y. Sekharam M. Frank D.A. Holzman L.B. Wu J. Sebti S. Jove R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7519-7528Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Although activation of STAT proteins has generally been associated with cytokine and mitogenic growth factor signaling, ligands acting on G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) can also activate STAT proteins. Angiotensin II has been shown to induce c-Src-dependent tyrosine (Tyr705) phosphorylation of STAT3 via activation of the G protein-coupled AT1 receptor in vascular smooth muscle cells (12Liang H. Venema V.J. Wang X. Ju H. Venema R.C. Marrero M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19846-19851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). α-Melanocyte-stimulating hormone, which enhances cellular proliferation, has been found to activate JAK2 and STAT1 in B-lymphocytes via stimulation of the melanocortin 5 receptor (13Buggy J.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Likewise, activation of α1-adrenoceptors and protease-activated receptor 1 has been shown to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2, Tyk2, and STAT1 in vascular smooth muscle cells (14Sasaguri T. Teruya H. Ishida A. Abumiya T. Ogata J. Biochem. Biophy. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). While activation of STATs in response to GPCR stimulation has been reported, the involvement of STATs in Gα-mediated transformation of cells is beginning to emerge (15Ram P.T. Iyengar R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1601-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Expression of constitutively active Gαo in NIH-3T3 cells results in Src-dependent activation of STAT3, which leads to cellular transformation. Similarly, expression of constitutively active Gαi2 in NIH-3T3 cells increases STAT3 activity (4Ram P.T. Horvath C.M. Iyengar R. Science. 2000; 287: 142-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Conversely, expression of a dominant negative mutant of Gαi2 inhibits Src kinase activity and Tyr705 phosphorylation of STAT3, leading to a reduction of v-fms-induced proliferation in NIH-3T3 cells (16Corre I. Baumann H. Hermouet S. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6335-6342Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the STAT3 pathway may play a vital role in the Gα subunit regulation of cell proliferation and transformation. With the recent demonstration of STAT3 involvement in Gαo- and Gαi2-induced cell transformation, it is reasonable to deduce that other Gα subunits may also regulate mitogenesis via STAT3 activation. Gα16, being unique in its restricted expression in hematopoietic cells (17Amatruda T.T. Steele D.A. Slepak V.Z. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5587-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), is also expressed in poorly differentiated leukemia cells, suggesting an association with hematopoietic cell growth and differentiation. Expression of a constitutively active Gα16 mutant has been shown to induce cell differentiation in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 (3Heasley L.E. Storey B. Fanger G.R. Butterfield L. Zamarripa J.

Biol. 1996; 16: 648-656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and aortic vascular smooth muscle cells, although the same mutant was found to inhibit cell growth in Swiss 3T3 cells (18Qian N.X. Russell M. Buhl A.M. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17417-17423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such observations suggest that Gα16 may regulate cell growth and differentiation via activation of cell type-specific signal transduction pathways. As a promiscuous G protein (19Offermanns S. Simon M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15175-15180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar), Gα16 possesses the ability to link a variety of GPCRs to the regulation of MAPKs. Recently, Gα16 has been shown to activate JNK (3Heasley L.E. Storey B. Fanger G.R. Butterfield L. Zamarripa J. Blumberg D. Maue R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 648-656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Chan A.S.L. Lai F.P.L. Lo R.K.H. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Stanbridge E.J. Wong Y.H. Cell. Signal. 2002; 14: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in addition to its ability to phosphorylate c-Jun, JNK can also phosphorylate STAT3 at Ser727 (21Lim C.P. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31055-31061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). It is therefore plausible that activated Gα16 can influence cell differentiation via MAPK-induced STAT3 signaling. Based on the exclusivity of Gα16 expression in hematopoietic cells and the involvement of STAT pathways in both normal and perturbed hematopoiesis (22Ward A.C. Touw I. Yoshimura A. Blood. 2000; 95: 19-29Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), phosphorylation of STAT3 via Gα16 activation may represent an important pathway for cell differentiation and development in the immune system. Indeed, we have recently shown that Gα16 can support receptor-mediated activation of STAT3 in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK 293) cells (23Wu E.H.T. Lo R.K.H. Wong Y.H. Biochem. Biophy. Res. Commun. 2003; 303: 920-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined the mechanism by which Gα16QL, a constitutively active Gα16 mutant, stimulated STAT3 in HEK 293 cells and provide evidence for the involvement of various intermediate signaling molecules including c-Src, JAKs, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Reagents—HEK 293 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (CRL-1573, Rockville, MD).

Constitutively activated mutants of Rac1 (Rac1G12V) and Cdc42 (Cdc42G12V) were kindly provided by Dr. Christopher L. Carpenter (Harvard Medical School, Boston). Constitutively activated RasG12V was a gift from Dr. Jeffery Field (University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA). RhoA and its various mutants (RhoAG14V and RhoAT19N) as well as the dominant negative mutant of Cdc42 (Cdc42T17N) were generous gifts from Dr. Marc Symons (Picower Institute for Medical Research, New York). The origins of plasmids encoding the dominant negative mutant of c-Src (c-Src-DN), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase γ (PI3Kγ) and its dominant negative mutant (PI3Kγ-DN) were as described previously (24Kam A.Y.F.

The p38 MAPK cDNA was obtained from Dr. Zhenguo Wu (Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China). The cDNAs of STAT3 and its dominant negative mutants STAT3Y705F and STAT3S727A were kindly donated by Dr. Nancy C. Reich (State University of New York).

The construction or sources of other cDNAs encoding wild-type and mutant forms of Gα16, Ras, Rac1, and JNK1 cDNAs were as described previously (20Chan A.S.L. Lai F.P.L. Lo R.K.H.

Neurochem. 1999; 73: 2101-2109PubMed Google Scholar). The luciferase reporter genes, pSTAT3-TA-luc, pGAS-TA-luc and pISRE-TA-luc, were obtained from Clontech laboratories, Inc. (Palo Alto, CA). The luciferase substrate and its lysis buffer were purchased from Roche Diagnostics (Mannheim, Germany). All antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling and kinase inhibitors were from Calbiochem (Darmstadt, Germany). C5a was purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Cell Culture and Transfection—HEL cells were maintained at 5% CO2, 37 °C in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin and 50 μl/ml streptomycin. HEK 293 cells were maintained at 5% CO2, 37 °C in Eagle's minimum essential medium (growth medium) with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin and 50 μl/ml streptomycin. HEK 293 cells were seeded on 96-well microtiter plates at a density of 15,000 cells/well and were cultured in the growth medium at 18 to 24 h prior to transfection. They were co-transfected with various cDNAs using LipofectAMINE PLUS reagents. The transfection mixtures using 100 μl/well of serum and antibiotics free OPTI-MEM medium contained 10 ng of G proteins, small GTPases or the control vector cDNAs, 0.1 μg of pSTAT3-TA-luc and 0.2 μl of both PLUS and LipofectAMINE reagents. After 3 h of transfection, 50 μl of OPTI-MEM medium containing 30% fetal bovine serum was added into the wells and incubated for another 30 h. Luciferase Assay—30 h after transfection, cells were serum-starved for 24 h. After removal of the medium, 25 μl of lysis buffer from Roche Diagnostics luciferase assay kit was added to the wells and then gently shaken on ice for 30 min. For detection, cell lysates in 25 μl of lysis buffer and 25 μl of luciferase substrate were measured by a microtiter plate luminometer MicroLumatPlus LB96V from EG&G Berthold. Western Blot Analysis—HEK 293 cells were transferred on 6-well plates at a density of 5 × 105 cells/well and were kept in the growth medium the day before transfection. They were co-transfected with various cDNAs using LipofectAMINE PLUS reagents following the supplier's instructions. After 48 h of transfection, the transfected cells were serum starved or treated with different kinase inhibitors overnight. The cells were lysed in 150 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 40 mm NaP2O7, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 200 μm Na3VO4, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin) and then gently shaken on ice for 30 min. Supernatants were collected by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 5 min. HEL cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 106 cells using serum-free medium with or without PTX (100 ng/ml) treatment overnight. Cells were treated with different kinase inhibitors for 30 min and then incubated with 100 nm C5a at 37 °C for 20 min. After that, cells were lysed by lysis buffer. Proteins from the cell lysates were resolved by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and then transferred to Osmonics nitrocellulose membrane (Westborough, MA). Phospho-STAT3-Tyr705, phospho-STAT3-Ser727, STAT3, phospho-p38 MAPK, p38 MAPK, phospho-JNK, JNK, phospho-ERK, and ERK were detected by specific primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. The immunoblots were visualized by chemiluminescence with the ECL kit from Amersham Biosciences. Activation of STAT3 by Constitutively Active Gα16QL in HEK 293 Cells—It has previously been shown that expression of constitutively active Gαo and Gαi2 in NIH-3T3 cells induced STAT3 activation (4Ram P.T. Horvath C.M. Iyengar R. Science. 2000; 287: 142-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 16Corre I. Baumann H. Hermouet S. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6335-6342Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In the present study, we sought to investigate the ability of constitutively active Gα16 to stimulate STAT3 phosphorylation and activation. Mutation of glutamine 212 to leucine (Q212L) in the conserved GTP/GDP binding domain of Gα16 inhibits its intrinsic GTPase activity and results in constitutive activation of Gα16 (3Heasley L.E. Storey B. Fanger G.R. Butterfield L. Zamarripa J. Blumberg D. Maue R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 648-656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Ho M.K.C. Yung L.Y. Wong Y.H. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 2101-2109PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the effect of Gα16QL mutant on the phosphorylation state of STAT3, HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected with cDNAs encoding pcDNA1 (vector control), Gα16 or Gα16QL. Total cell lysates prepared from the transfected cells were probed with anti-STAT3, anti-phospho-STAT3-Tyr705 and anti-phospho-STAT3-Ser727 antisera. Expression of either Gα16 or Gα16QL in HEK 293 cells did not affect the expression of total STAT3 as compared with the vector control (Fig. 1A). Further studies using anti-phospho-STAT3-Tyr705 and anti-phospho-STAT3-Ser727 antisera revealed basal levels of Ser727 phosphorylation of STAT3 protein in both the vector control and Gα16-expressing cells, while there was little or no Tyr705 phosphorylation of STAT3 in these cells. In contrast, expression of Gα16QL led to a striking increase in both Tyr705 and Ser727 phosphorylation of STAT3 protein (Fig. 1A). The observed Gα16QL-induced phosphorylation of STAT3 is likely to induce STAT3 transcriptional activity, as demonstrated with GαoQL-induced phosphorylation and activation of STAT3 (4Ram P.T. Horvath C.M. Iyengar R. Science. 2000; 287: 142-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In order to verify a similar correlation between Gα16QL-induced STAT3 phosphorylation and modulation of STAT3 transcriptional activity, we performed reporter gene assays using a pSTAT3-TA-luc construct in combination with various cDNAs (pcDNA1, Gα16 and Gα16QL). As indicated in Fig. 1B, the magnitude of STAT3-mediated gene expression was unaffected by control vector or Gα16 expression. On the contrary, expression of Gα16QL induced an increased level of STAT3 activation as evidenced by a significant elevation of reporter gene expression. These results suggest that activation of Gα16 can indeed lead to the phosphorylation of STAT3 at both Tyr705 and Ser727 as well as the induction of STAT3 transcriptional activity. Using two other reporter gene constructs (pGAS-TA-luc and pISRE-TA-luc), we examined the ability of Gα16QL to similarly activate STAT1 and STAT1/2 transcriptional activities. STAT1-mediated gene expression was significantly elevated in Gα16QL-expressing cells, but not in Gα16 or vector-transfected cells (Fig. 1B). In contrast, STAT1/2-mediated gene expression was not enhanced in Gα16QL-expressing cells (Fig. 1B). The specificity of Gα16QL-induced STAT3 activation was further characterized by the dose-dependent relationship between the amount of Gα16QL expression and STAT3 stimulation. As shown in Fig. 1C, the magnitude of STAT3-dependent luciferase activity was positively correlated to the concentration of Gα16QL cDNA transfected into the HEK 293 cells, whereas no correlation with activity could be observed for the cDNA of Gα16. The progressive increase in STAT3-dependent luciferase activity was eminent at the concentration range of 3–30 ng/ml of Gα16QL cDNA. Increasing the Gα16QL cDNA concentration beyond 30 ng/ml failed to induce further increase in luciferase activity, presumably because Gα16QL was no longer a limiting factor. The observed saturation of STAT3-dependent luciferase activity was likely to be caused by the limited amount of pSTAT3-TA-luc available in the transfected cells. As both Tyr705 and Ser727 of STAT3 appeared to be phosphorylated in Gα16QL-expressing cells, we examined whether these modifications can occur independently. Using the reporter gene assay, the ability of Gα16QL to induce the phosphorylation of wild-type and phosphorylation-resistant mutants of STAT3 (STAT3Y705F and STAT3S727A) was examined in HEK 293 cells. Coexpression of STAT3 and Gα16QL resulted in an elevation of luciferase activity that was significantly higher than those obtained with Gα16 and vector control, and the magnitude of the response was identical to that of cells lacking recombinant STAT3 (Fig. 1D). In cells coexpressing the Y705F mutant of STAT3, although Gα16QL was still capable of inducing STAT3-dependent luciferase activity beyond the controls, such stimulation was significantly attenuated as compared with cells coexpressing wild-type STAT3 (Fig. 1D). Similar results were obtained with the S727A mutant of STAT3. Overexpression of STAT3 and its mutants was detected with anti-STAT3 antiserum (Fig. 1D). Lack of phosphorylation of the Y705F and S727A mutants of STAT3 at Tyr705 and Ser727, respectively, was confirmed with anti-phospho-STAT3 antisera (Fig. 1D). Basal as well as Gα16QL-dependent Tyr705 phosphorylation were prominently observed in STAT3- and S727A-mutant expressing cells, whereas a reduction in Tyr705 phosphorylation was seen with the Y705F mutant. Conversely, elevations in the levels of Ser727 phosphorylation were detected in cells expressing the wild-type and Y705F mutant of STAT3, while little or no phosphorylation at this site was detectable in S727A-expressing cells. This indicated that Gα16QL-induced phosphorylation of STAT3 at Tyr705 and Ser727 could occur independently. Effects of MAPKs on STAT3 Phosphorylation—The MAPK pathway has been shown to play an important role in the regulation of STAT3 signaling. Both ERKs and JNK1 have been shown to phosphorylate STAT3 at Ser727 (10Chung J. Uchida E. Grammer T.C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6508-6516Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 21Lim C.P. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31055-31061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Likewise, p38 MAPK has been shown to play a key role in the Ser727 phosphorylation of STAT3 (11Turkson J. Bowman T. Adnane J. Zhang Y. Djeu J.Y. Sekharam M. Frank D.A. Holzman L.B. Wu J. Sebti S. Jove R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7519-7528Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Since Gα16 has been shown to activate JNK (4Ram P.T. Horvath C.M. Iyengar R. Science. 2000; 287: 142-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 24Kam A.Y.F. Chan A.S.L. Wong Y.H. J. Neurochem. 2003; 84: 503-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), we asked if it can similarly stimulate ERK and p38 MAPK. Anti-phospho-MAPK antisera were used to probe the activities of MAPKs in Gα16QL-transfectants. The activities of all three branches of MAPKs were stimulated by Gα16QL, but not Gα16 (Fig. 2A). Next, we investigated if one or more of these MAPKs were required for Gα16QL-induced STAT3 activation. Firstly, we examined the effect of MAPKs expression on STAT3 activity. As illustrated in Fig. 2B, overexpression of ERK1 significantly stimulated STAT3 activation. In contrast, overexpression of JNK1 or p38 MAPK had no effect on STAT3 stimulation, suggesting that these two pathways did not play a significant role in STAT3 regulation in HEK 293 cells. We used a panel of kinase inhibitors to further confirm the functional role of various MAPKs on Gα16QL-induced STAT3 phosphorylation and activation. The MAPK/ERK kinase 1/2 (MEK1/2) inhibitor, U0126 (10 μm), inhibited Gα16QL-induced STAT3 activation whereas the p38 MAPK/JNK inhibitors, SB202190 (10 μm) and SB203580 (10 μm), did not affect STAT3-dependent luciferase activity (Fig. 2C). The ineffectiveness of both SB202190 and SB203580 further substantiated the lack of involvement of p38 MAPK and JNK in STAT3 activation. The inhibitory effect of U0126 reflects a possible involvement of MEK1/2 in STAT3 regulation. Inhibition of the upstream activator of MEK1/2, Raf-1, by its specific inhibitor (10 μm) also suppressed the Gα16QL-induced STAT3 activation (Fig. 2C). These observations provided additional evidence to support the regulatory role of ERK on STAT3 activation. The effects of the various inhibitors on the state of phosphorylation of STAT3 were examined with anti-phospho-STAT3 antisera. Both U0126 and the Raf-1 inhibitor, but not SB202190 and SB203580, attenuated the Gα16QL-induced STAT3 phosphorylation at Ser727 (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, Gα16QL-induced STAT3 phosphorylation at Tyr705 was also suppressed by U0126 and the Raf-1 inhibitor, but not by SB202190 and SB203580 (Fig. 2C). Since ERK is a Ser/Thr-specific kinase, these results implied that the ERK pathway might indirectly activate STAT3 by phosphorylation at Tyr705. Roles of Small GTPases on Gα16QL-induced STAT3 Activation—Next, we attempted to identify other intracellular signaling molecules involved in Gα16QL-induced STAT3 activation. Small GTPases have been shown to play critical roles in growth regulation and there is considerable evidence to suggest that GPCR activation can regulate cell growth through the engagement of these monomeric GTPases. In order to determine the role of small GTPases on STAT3 phosphorylation, constitutively activated mutants of Ras (RasG12V), Cdc42 (Cdc42G12V), Rac1 (Rac1G12V), and RhoA (RhoAG14V) were utilized to examine their effects on STAT3 activity. STAT3-dependent luciferase activity was significantly stimulated in cells expressing constitutively active RasG12V or Rac1G12V (Fig. 3A). In contrast, neither Cdc42G12V nor RhoAG14V was able to stimulate STAT3 activity (Fig. 3A). The functional role of Ras and Rac1 in the regulation of Gα16QL-induced STAT3 activation was further examined in HEK 293 cells. If these small GTPases serve as intermediate signaling molecules for Gα16-mediated STAT3 activation, their dominant negative mutants should inhibit Gα16QL-induced STAT3 activity. Using STAT3 driven luciferase reporter gene assays, we coexpressed the various mutants of Ras and Rac1 with either Gα16 or Gα16QL in HEK 293 cells and determined the luciferase activity of the transfectants. In the Gα16-transfectants, the presence of RasG12V significantly elevated STAT3 activity as compared with either the vector control or wild-type Ras (Fig. 3B). The dominant negative mutant of Ras (RasS17N) slightly suppressed the STAT3 activity in Gα16-expressing cells. In HEK 293 cells expressing Gα16QL and a vector control or together with wild-type Ras, STAT3 activities were significantly higher than the corresponding cells expressing Gα16 (Fig. 3B). Expression of constitutively active RasG12V did not further enhance the Gα16QL-induced STAT3 activity, whereas the dominant negative mutant RasS17N almost completely inhibited the Gα16QL-induced STAT3 activity, to a level similar to that seen with Gα16-expressing cells (Fig. 3B). The inhibitory effect of RasS17N on Gα16QL-induced STAT3 phosphorylation was also demonstrated by immunoblotting with anti-phospho-STAT3 antisera. As compared with the vector control or Gα16-transfectants, much higher levels of Tyr705 and Ser727 phosphorylation"

Like all PBPs, PBP 5 forms a covalent acyl-enzyme complex with β-lactam antibiotics; however, PBP 5 is distinguished by its high rate of deacylation of the acylenzyme complex (t½ ≈ 10 min). A Gly105 → Asp mutation in PBP 5 markedly impairs deacylation with only minor effects on acylation, and abolishes CPase activity. We have determined the three-dimensional structure of a soluble form of wild-type PBP 5 at 1.85-Å resolution and have also refined the structure of the G105D mutant form of PBP 5 to 1.9-Å resolution. Comparison of the two structures reveals that the major effect of the mutation is to disorder a loop comprising residues 74–90 that sits atop the SXN motif of the active site. Deletion of the 74–90 loop in wild-type PBP 5 markedly diminished the deacylation rate of penicillin G with a minimal impact on acylation, and abolished CPase activity. These effects were very similar to those observed in the G105D mutant, reinforcing the idea that this mutation causes disordering of the 74–90 loop. Mutation of two consecutive serines within this loop, which hydrogen bond to Ser110 and Asn112 in the SXN motif, had marked effects on CPase activity, but not β-lactam antibiotic binding or hydrolysis. These data suggest a direct role for the SXN motif in deacylation of the acyl-enzyme complex and imply that the functioning of this motif is modulated by the 74–90 loop.

Bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan surrounds the cell and is essential for proper maintenance of cellular morphology and cell viability. In Escherichia coli, cell walls are composed of a repeating disaccharide, N-acetylglucosamine-β-1,4-N-acetyl-muramic acid, in which the muramic acid residues are substituted with the pentapeptide, l-Ala-d-γ-Glu-m-DAP-d-Ala-d-Ala (where m-DAP = meso-diaminopimelic acid). During peptidoglycan synthesis, disaccharide-pentapeptide units are polymerized onto nascent glycan chains (transglycosylation) and the peptide chains from different glycan strands are cross-linked (transpeptidation) by transpeptidases known as penicillin-binding proteins or PBPs. 1The abbreviations used are: PBPpenicillin-binding proteinCPasecarboxypeptidasem-DAPmeso-diaminopimelic acidLOloop-outr.m.s.root mean square. Cross-linking of the peptide chains confers rigidity to the peptidoglycan and viability to the bacterial cell. The related carboxypeptidases, which hydrolyze the C-terminal d-Ala moiety from the peptide chain, may modulate the degree of cross-linking. penicillin-binding protein carboxypeptidase meso-diaminopimelic acid loop-out root mean square. In E. coli at least 10 PBPs have been identified. These enzymes fall into two categories: the high molecular mass PBPs, which are essential for cell viability and catalyze transpeptidase and sometimes transglycosylase activity, and the low molecular mass PBPs, which are non-essential and catalyze d,d-carboxypeptidase (CPase) and sometimes d,d-endopeptidase activity (1Ghuysen J.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1991; 45: 37-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Regardless of the type of PBP, all of these enzymes react with peptide substrates and β-lactam antibiotics by a similar mechanism. The initial step in the reaction of PBPs with their peptide substrates is a nucleophilic attack of the d-Ala-d-Ala peptide bond by a conserved serine residue, leading to acylation of the serine hydroxyl side chain and the concomitant release of the C-terminal d-Ala. In the subsequent deacylation step, the acyl-enzyme complex can react with either an amino group (from m-DAP) of another peptide to form a cross-link (transpeptidation) or it can react with water to release the peptide (carboxypeptidation). Penicillin and other β-lactam antibiotics inactivate these enzymes by mimicking the structure of the d-Ala-d-Ala C terminus of the peptide chain (2Tipper D.J. Strominger J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 54: 1133-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar, 3Wise Jr., E.M. Park J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1980; 255: 3964-3976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike the complex formed with peptide substrates, however, the β-lactam-PBP complex is long-lived and renders the enzyme inactive. PBPs and other penicillin-interacting enzymes (e.g. class A β-lactamases) are characterized by a set of conserved motifs that are clustered in their respective active sites (5Joris B. Ghuysen J.-M. Dive G. Renard A. Dideberg O. Charlier P. Frere J.-M. Kelly J.A. Boyington J.C. Moews P.C. Knox J.R. Biochem. J. 1988; 250: 313-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). These motifs include the Ser-X-X-Lys (SXXK) tetrad that contains the serine nucleophile, the Ser-X-Asn (SXN) triad, and the Lys-Thr(Ser)-Gly (KTG) triad. In all serine-based PBPs and β-lactamases of known structure, these motifs adopt a strikingly similar conformation to the extent that the active site of one PBP or β-lactamase can look very much like another. In addition to these three motifs, class A β-lactamases have a fourth motif, Glu-X-X-X-Asn, present on the so-called Ω loop, that is responsible for the extremely high rates of deacylation of the antibiotic-β-lactamase complex (6Adachi H.

Despite a wealth of structural and biochemical data, a consensus on the definitive mechanism of catalysis in β-lactamases has yet to emerge. Nevertheless, the picture of catalysis by β-lactamases is much clearer than in the related PBPs. To further our understanding of both acylation and deacylation in PBPs and to examine their mechanistic similarities with β-lactamases, we have focused on PBP 5 from E. coli. PBP 5 is one of the best characterized PBPs and provides an excellent system in which to study the catalytic mechanism of penicillin-interacting enzymes (9Gutheil W.G. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 259: 62-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 10Gutheil W.G. Stefanova M.E. Nicholas R.A. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 196-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 11Stefanova M.E. Davies C. Nicholas R.A. Gutheil W.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1597: 292-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). PBP 5 is the most abundant PBP in E. coli and catalyzes the major d-alanine carboxypeptidase activity in vivo (12Matsuhashi M. Tamaki S. Curtis S.J. Strominger J.L. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 137: 644-647Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although it is not essential for cell viability, recent studies have shown that PBP 5 is required for proper cell morphology in E. coli missing certain PBPs (13Nelson D.E. Young K.D. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1714-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and that it may have a role in cell division (14Begg K.J. Dewar S.J. Donachie W.D. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6211-6222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PBP 5 is unusual among PBPs in that it catalyzes a respectable β-lactamase activity (t½ ≈ 10 min at pH 7.0) (15Amanuma H. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11173-11180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Nicholas R.A. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2034-2040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A deacylation-defective mutant of PBP 5 containing a Gly105 to Asp mutation (termed PBP 5′) was identified from a screen of bacterial strains lacking carboxypeptidase IA activity (17Matsuhashi M. Maruyama I.N. Takagaki Y. Tamaki S. Nishimura Y. Hirota Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 2631-2635Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 18Broome-Smith J.K. Spratt B.G. FEBS Lett. 1984; 165: 185-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Kinetic studies demonstrated that PBP 5′ had near normal acylation rates with penicillin G, but displayed a 30-fold decrease in the rate of deacylation of the penicilloyl-PBP 5′ complex (16Nicholas R.A. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2034-2040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Amanuma H. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1294-1298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we reported the crystal structure of PBP 5′ (20Davies C. White S.W. Nicholas R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 616-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), which revealed a conventional arrangement of active site motifs but, in the absence of the wild-type structure, provided few clues regarding the underlying reason for the defect in deacylation. In this paper we present the structure of wild-type PBP 5 solved to 1.85-Å resolution. This structure is compared with that of PBP 5′ now refined to the higher resolution of 1.9 Å. The principal difference in the wild-type structure is the ordering of a loop near the active site comprising residues 74–90, leading to the hypothesis that the disordering of this loop in the mutant enzyme is responsible for its markedly decreased deacylation rate. Kinetic data from mutants in which this loop was removed are consistent with this hypothesis. We also identify two conserved serine residues on this loop that are important for CPase activity. Crystallization—A soluble form of wild-type PBP 5 missing its cleavable signal sequence was expressed in the cytoplasm of E. coli BL21* cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and purified by ampicillin affinity chromatography as described previously (16Nicholas R.A. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2034-2040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For crystallization experiments the protein was concentrated to 5.5 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, containing 30 mm NaCl and 3 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Wild-type PBP 5 did not crystallize under the same conditions as those used for PBP 5′ (20Davies C. White S.W. Nicholas R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 616-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and so a new search for conditions was undertaken. Initial trials used the vapor diffusion hanging drop technique in which 3 μl of protein was mixed with 3 μl of well solution. A wide variety of conditions were tested, including Crystal Screens I and II (Hampton Research, Laguna Niguel, CA). PBP 5′ was purified and crystallized according to previously established conditions (16Nicholas R.A. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2034-2040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Davies C. White S.W. Nicholas R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 616-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Data Collection—Crystals of both wild-type and G105D mutant PBP 5 were cryo-protected by passage through their respective stabilization solutions (wild-type PBP 5: 8% PEG 400, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; PBP 5′: 20% PEG 4000, 100 mm Tris, pH 7.0) containing increasing concentrations of glycerol, in 2% increments, up to a maximum of 25%. At each step the crystals were soaked for 5–10 min except at the final step where the crystals were soaked overnight. Data were collected on a RAXIS-IV++ imaging plate system mounted on an RU-H3R x-ray generator operating at 50 kV and 100 mA and fitted with Osmic Confocal Optics (Rigaku/MSC, The Woodlands, TX). For the wild-type crystals, the crystal-to-detector distance was set at 140 mm and data were collected in 0.5o oscillation frames with an exposure time of 5 min per frame. A total of 215o of data were collected. For PBP 5′ crystals, the crystal-to-detector distance was 150 mm and data were collected in 1o-oscillation frames with an exposure time of 5 min per frame. A total of 200o of data were obtained. Both data sets were processed with CrystalClear (21Pflugrath J.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1718-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar). Structure Determination and Refinement—The starting model for both refinements was the previous 2.3-Å structure of PBP 5′ that had been refined against data obtained at room temperature (20Davies C. White S.W. Nicholas R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 616-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The structure of wild-type PBP 5 was solved by molecular replacement using AMoRe (22Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5030) Google Scholar) with a search model of PBP 5′ in which Asp105 had been replaced by glycine. Initially, both models were refined with XPLOR (23Brünger A.T. X-PLOR, Version 3.1, A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar), and included several rounds of rigid body refinement, but later rounds used REFMAC5 (24Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar). Manual refitting of the structures was performed as necessary with O (25Jones T.A. Zhou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). Water molecules were included as they became visible in both the (Fo – Fc) and 2(Fo – Fc) electron density maps and if they had at least two potential hydrogen bonding partners. The quality of the models was assessed by PROCHECK (26Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thorton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) and superimpositions were performed using LSQKAB (27Collaborative Computation Project N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). The coordinates and structure factors for the wild-type PBP 5 (1NZO) and PBP 5′ (1NJ4) structures have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank. Construction and Purification of PBP 5 Variants—Constructs of PBP 5 were made in which residues 72–92 were deleted, termed “loop out” (LO). These constructs were made in both wild-type PBP 5 (PBP 5-LO) and in the G105D mutant (PBP 5′-LO). PBP 5-LO was constructed by 4-primer PCR as described previously (28Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). The outside primers were complementary to sequences surrounding the multiple cloning site in the pT7-7K vector (29Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2459) Google Scholar). The LO-down internal primer was complementary to codons 64–71 and 93–98, inclusive (5′-CGGAACCTGCATGCCCGGGATAGTGACTAAATCAGTTTCTT-3′), whereas the LO-up internal primer (5′-CCGGGCATGCAGGTTCCG-3′) was complementary to codons 93–98. In the first round of PCR, pT7-PBP 5 was amplified with pT7-up and LO-down and with pT7-down and LO-up. Following the first round of PCR, the two fragments were isolated and added to a new tube with the outside primers only, and PCR was carried out as before. The overlapping regions allowed for the annealing of the two fragments and the full-length gene missing codons 72–92 of the mature PBP 5 sequence was generated. The final PCR product was digested with XbaI and HindIII and ligated into similarly digested pT7-7K to produce pT7-PBP 5-LO. To construct pT7-PBP 5′-LO, the XhoI-SphI fragment encompassing the 5′ end of the gene up to codon 94 of pT7 PBP 5-LO was ligated with the SphI-BglII fragment from pT7-PBP 5′ containing the G105D mutation and the BglII-XhoI vector fragment from pT7-7K. Individual mutations were constructed in a similar manner and cloned into the same vector as for the loop-out constructs. All constructs were verified by sequencing. Following transformation of the vectors into BL21* cells, the mutant proteins were purified by ampicillin affinity chromatography as described for PBP 5 and PBP 5′ (16Nicholas R.A. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2034-2040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Kinetic Analysis of the Interaction of PBP 5 Variants with [14C]Penicillin G and Peptide Substrate—The reaction mechanism for the interaction of PBPs with peptide and β-lactam antibiotics is,E+S↔k-1k1E·S→k2E-S→k3E+P(Eq. 1) where, K′ = (k–1 + k2)/k1, E·S is the non-covalent Michaelis complex, E-S is the covalent acyl-enzyme complex, and P is the released product. The constant k2/K′, which describes the formation of the acyl-enzyme complex (E-S) at low (subsaturating) concentrations of β-lactam antibiotics, was determined from time courses of the formation of E-S with [14C]penicillin G essentially as described (30Frere J.M. Nguyen-Disteche M. Coyette J. Joris B. The Chemistry of β-Lactams. Chapman and Hall, Glasgow1992: 148-196Google Scholar). PBP 5 (48 μg; 1.2 nmol) was diluted into 150 μl of binding buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 10% glycerol) and mixed with an equal volume of 100 μm [14C]penicillin G in binding buffer. At timed intervals, 20-μl aliquots were removed, mixed with 5 ml of 5% trichloroacetic acid (w/v), and incubated on ice for 15 min. The acidified proteins were passed through number 30 glass fiber filters (Schleicher and Schuell, Keene, NH) and the filters were washed twice with 5 ml each of 1% trichloroacetic acid, 33% methanol. The filters were then air dried, placed in scintillation vials with 3 ml of Scinti-safe scintillation fluid (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburg, PA), and counted. k3 values were determined from semi-log plots of the % [14C]penicillin G remaining versus time. PBP 5 proteins (11–37 μg; 0.28–0.92 nmol) were diluted into 150 μl of binding buffer and mixed with an equal volume of 100 μm [14C]penicillin G for 10 min at 30 °C. At t = 0, penicillin G was added to 3 mm, and the amount of radioactivity remaining covalently bound to the protein was determined by removing 20-μl aliquots at various times and quantitating the amount of bound [14C]penicillin G as described above. The t½ values were determined from the plots and converted to k3 values by dividing the t½ in seconds into 0.693. CPase assays were carried out with the peptide N,N′-diacetyl-l-Lys-d-Ala-d-Ala and the amount of hydrolysis of the ultimate d-alanine residue was quantitated with the spectrophotometric microtiter plate protocol described by Gutheil et al. (10Gutheil W.G. Stefanova M.E. Nicholas R.A. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 196-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Assays contained from 0 to 10 mm peptide and 0.83 μm enzyme, with the exception that PBP 5′, PBP 5-LO, and PBP 5′-LO were also tested at 8.3 μm. Structure Determination—Crystals of wild-type PBP 5 were obtained over wells containing 8% PEG 400, 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0. This condition is considerably different from that for PBP 5′ (20% PEG 4000, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.0 (16Nicholas R.A. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2034-2040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) and indicates some difference in the protein structure. Diffraction studies revealed that the crystals belonged to space group C2 with cell dimensions a = 109.4 Å, b = 50.3 Å, c = 84.5 Å, and β = 120.9o. Electron density maps showed that the region between residues 74 and 90, which is absent in the structure of PBP 5′ because of apparent flexibility, is ordered in the wild-type structure. The R factor of the final model is 20.9% (Rfree = 24.5%). For the purposes of structure comparison a new data set under cryo conditions was obtained from crystals of PBP 5′. This resulted in a slight improvement in resolution (from 2.3 to 1.9 Å) compared with previous data collected at room temperature (20Davies C. White S.W. Nicholas R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 616-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), but a significant improvement in completeness and redundancy. The cell dimensions under cryo conditions were a = b = 50.2 Å and c = 136.8 Å, which differs principally from the room temperature cell through a 3.5-Å reduction in the c dimension. The structure was refined against the 1.9 Å data to a final R factor of 20.9% (Rfree = 24.4%). Compared with the room temperature structure, residues 85–90 are now visible in the electron density map but residues 74–84 remain disordered. In both structures difficulty was encountered in fitting the region 154–157 because this appears to exhibit some disordering, thus weakening the electron density. The data collection and final refinement statistics of both models are shown in Table I.Table IX-ray diffraction data and model refinement statistics for wild-type and G105D mutant PBP 5 (PBP 5′) structuresWild-type (1NZO)PBP 5′ (1NJ4)Data collection Resolution range (Å)54.0-1.8536.9-1.9(1.92-1.85)(1.97-1.90) RmergeaRmerge = Σ|Ii — Im|/ΣIi, where Ii is the intensity of the measured reflection and Im is the mean intensity of all symmetry-related reflections.

Open table in a new tab Structure Description—The overall structure of wild-type PBP 5 exhibits the same fold as that previously described for PBP 5′ (20Davies C. White S.W. Nicholas R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 616-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Briefly, PBP 5 is composed of two domains that are oriented approximately at right angles to each other (Fig. 1A). Domain 1, which is a transpeptidase-like domain typical of penicillin-interacting enzymes, comprises a five-stranded anti-parallel β sheet packed on both sides by α helices. Domain 2 is unique to PBP 5 and is formed by a sandwich of two anti-parallel β sheets, one three-stranded and the other two-stranded. The active site of PBP 5 is located at the interface of the five-stranded anti-parallel β sheet and the large α helical cluster within domain 1. Structure Comparison—The common main chain atoms of domain 1 of wild-type PBP 5 and PBP 5′ superimpose very closely with an r.m.s. deviation of 0.88 Å, indicating that the mutation has little effect on the overall structure. After superimposition a slight shift in the relative position of domain 2 is observed (Fig. 1A). This difference arises from a hinging motion centered at the domain boundary (residue 262) resulting in a relative 6-Å shift of residues at the base of domain 2. The shifted position of domain 2 is likely the result of crystal packing interactions, which are different in the two structures. In the wild-type structure the tip of domain 2 packs against the 74–90 loop, whereas in PBP 5′ this region is largely exposed. Superimposition reveals two regions within domain 1 in which significant structural differences are observed between the wild-type and mutant enzymes: 1) residues 74–90, and 2) residues 190–193 of the β7-β8 loop (Fig. 1B). Slight differences are also seen in the so-called Ω-like loop, but because the electron density for this region is weak in both structures, this is most likely because of the difficulties in fitting the model. 74–90 Region—In the structure of PBP 5′ reported previously, which was solved using data collected at room temperature, the region between residues 74 and 90 (inclusive) was not visible in the electron density map (20Davies C. White S.W. Nicholas R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 616-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In the new structure of PBP 5′ refined against data collected under cryo conditions, residues 85–90 are now visible and adopt an irregular loop structure, whereas residues 74 to 84 remain disordered (Fig. 1B). The crystallographic B factors for residues 85–90, however, are high (in the 50s) and some of the side chains are poorly resolved, indicating a high degree of flexibility. The increased ordering of residues 85–90 in PBP 5′ is likely because of the improvement in the quality of data obtained under cryogenic conditions. In contrast, the entire region encompassing 74–90 in the wild-type structure is highly ordered and has refined with low B factors (in the 30s). The secondary structure of this region, which is stabilized by numerous non-bonding interactions to the surrounding protein, is mostly an irregular loop but starts with a helical turn and finishes in an extended conformation. In the middle is a striking “zig zag” motif in which there are tight turns made by Pro81 and Gly85. Interestingly, residues 85–90 adopt a different fold in each structure with the divergence beginning at residue 90 (reverse direction) (Fig. 1B). In the wild-type structure this loop remains close to the protein domain, whereas in PBP 5′ these residues point out toward solvent. 190–193 Loop—The only other region that is altered significantly between the two structures is the connecting loop between β7 and β8, comprising residues 190–193 (Fig. 1B). In the wild-type structure, this loop is displaced slightly away from the active site because of the presence of Met89, which is central to the hydrophobic core in this region (see below). In the PBP 5′ structure, the absence of this residue has enabled Phe190 to move in and fill the void in the hydrophobic core. Effect of the G105D Mutation—Given that glycine residues tend to act as helix breakers, it might have been expected that the α4 helix containing the mutation would terminate earlier in wild-type PBP 5 than in the mutant PBP 5′ structure, thereby affecting the conformation of the SXN active site motif that directly follows the α4 helix. Surprisingly, little or no structural difference in this helix or its residue side chains is seen between the two structures (Fig. 2). In PBP 5′ only the side chain of Gln109 has moved slightly to avoid a clash with Asp105, which lies directly below this residue on the helix. In the wild-type structure, the side chain of Gln109 is within hydrogen bonding distance of the carbonyl group of Leu88, a contact that is absent in PBP 5′. Instead, the primary effect of the G105D mutation in PBP 5′ is to disrupt a hydrophobic core region. In the wild-type structure, this core is formed by the hydrophobic faces of α4, α5, β7, β8, and the 74–90 loop (Fig. 3). At the heart of the hydrophobic core is Met89, with additional contributions of Phe188, Phe190, Leu91, Leu102, and Ala114. In the PBP 5′ structure, a glycine to aspartic acid mutation at position 105 disrupts this region by projecting directly into the space occupied by Met89. As a result, Met89 is displaced along with Phe90 and residues 85–88. The space vacated by Met89 is partially occupied by Phe190, hence the movement of residues 190–193.Fig. 3Stereo representation of the hydrophobic core region in wild-type PBP 5. This region is formed in part by the 74–90 loop, which is altered in PBP 5′. In this superimposition the wild-type structure is shown as solid bonds, whereas the PBP 5′ structure is shown as dashed lines. The α carbon positions are shown as dots and are labeled. In areas where the structures diverge, the equivalent atoms in PBP 5′ are also labeled. This figure was prepared using MOLSCRIPT (36Kraulis P.J. J. Appl."

It is also a key regulator of transcriptional silencing of genes placed in close proximity to telomeres. Here, we describe the identification of separation-of-function mutants of Yku80p that exhibit defects in silencing but not DNA repair and show that these mutations map to an evolutionarily conserved domain within Yku80p. Furthermore, we reveal that Yku80p interacts with the silent information regulator protein Sir4p and that this interaction is mediated by the N-terminal 200 amino acid residues of Sir4p. Notably, this interaction also requires the region of Yku80p that contains the sites of the silencing defective mutations. Finally, we show that these mutations impair the Yku80p-Sir4p interaction and recruitment of Sir3p to telomeric regions in vivo. Taken together with other data, these findings indicate that the Yku80p-Sir4p interaction plays a vital role in the assembly of telomeric heterochromatin.

The DNA of all organisms is continually damaged by the byproducts of physiological processes and by mutagens in the environment. Ionizing radiation and radiomimetic chemicals induce a variety of DNA lesions, the most cytotoxic of which is the DNA double strand break (DSB). 1The abbreviations used are: DSB, double strand break; NHEJ, non-homologous end joining; TPE, telomeric position effect; Sir, silent information regulator; MME, methyl methane sulfonate; 5-FOA, 5-fluoro-orotic acid; HA, hemagglutinin; wt, wild type; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; IP, immunoprecipitated samples. Consequently, eukaryotic cells have developed elaborate mechanisms to sense DNA DSBs and to mediate their effective repair (1.Khanna K.K. Jackson S.P. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (1940) Google Scholar). One key protein recognizing DNA DSBs is Ku, which binds to DNA ends in addition to other types of discontinuity in double-stranded DNA (2.Dynan W.S. Yoo S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1551-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 3.Critchlow S.E. Jackson S.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 394-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Ku is a tightly associated heterodimer of ∼70- and ∼80-kDa subunits that in humans acts together with the 470-kDa DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (see Ref. 4.Gottlieb T.M. Jackson S.P. Cell. 1993; 72: 131-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar) to repair DNA DSBs caused by physiological oxidation reactions, V(D)J recombination, ionizing radiation, and certain chemotherapeutic drugs (5.Smith G.C. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 916-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). The Ku-dependent repair process called illegitimate recombination or non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) is a major DSB repair mechanism in mammalian cells (3.Critchlow S.E. Jackson S.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 394-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Although DSB repair by NHEJ is used less frequently in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, this organism possesses homologues of both Ku70 and Ku80 and these play crucial roles in NHEJ (3.Critchlow S.E.

Thus, yeast cells expressing a functional Ku heterodimer accurately and efficiently join cohesive ends of a transformed linearized plasmid, whereas this repair is severely impaired in cells lacking either Ku subunit (6.Boulton S.J. Jackson S.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4639-4648Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 8.Boulton S.J. Jackson S.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5093-5103Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae Ku is also critically important for telomere maintenance, and disruption of either yeast Ku subunit results in the reduction of telomere repeat lengths (9.Boulton S.J. Jackson S.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1819-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 10.Porter S.E. Greenwell P.W. Ritchie K.B. Petes T.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 582-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In addition, both YKU70 and YKU80 interact genetically with CDC13 whose product binds to the single-stranded telomeric overhang and is required for telomerase activity in vivo (11.Meier B. Driller L. Jaklin S. Feldmann H.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4233-4245Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 12.Grandin N. Damon C. Charbonneau M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8397-8408Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Yku80p has also been found to help recruit telomerase to the telomeric end via interaction with a 48-nucleotide stem-loop component of telomerase RNA (13.Peterson S.E. Stellwagen A.E. Diede S.J. Singer M.S. Haimberger Z.W. Johnson C.O. Tzoneva M. Gottschling D.E. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 64-67Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Precisely how Ku is itself tethered to telomere ends is not yet clear. Deletion of Ku also affects the transcriptional silencing of genes in close proximity to telomeres, a process called the telomeric position effect (TPE) (14.Gottschling D.E. Aparicio O.M. Billington B.L. Zakian V.A. Cell. 1990; 63: 751-762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar, 15.Shore D. Telomeres. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1995Google Scholar). TPE is severely diminished in cells lacking Yku70p or Yku80p, but repression of the silent mating type loci, HMR and HML, is maintained (9.Boulton S.J. Jackson S.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1819-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 16.Nugent C.I. Bosco G. Ross L.O. Evans S.K. Salinger A.P. Moore J.K. Haber J.E. Lundblad V. Curr.

Biol. 1998; 8: 653-656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The silent information regulator (Sir) proteins, Sir2p, Sir3p, and Sir4p, are the major mediators of transcriptional silencing at both the telomeric and the silent mating-type loci (18.Aparicio O.M. Billington B.L. Gottschling D.E. Cell. 1991; 66: 1279-1287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar) and are thought to bring about silencing by packaging DNA into a heterochromatin-like state (19.Moretti P. Freeman K. Coodly L. Shore D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2257-2269Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). The Sir complex is recruited to telomeres through interactions with Rap1p (a telomere TG repeat-binding protein) and histones H3 and H4 (20.Hecht A. Laroche T. Strahlbolsinger S. Gasser S.M. Grunstein M. Cell. 1995; 80: 583-592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). Sir4p plays a major role in the initiation of this assembly and recruits Sir2p and Sir3p. Deacetylation of histone H4 by Sir2p then promotes further recruitment of Sir4p (21.Imai S. Armstrong C.M. Kaeberlein M. Guarente L. Nature. 2000; 403: 795-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (2817) Google Scholar, 22.Luo K. Vega-Palas M.A. Grunstein M. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1528-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 23.Smith J.S.

A. 2000; 97: 6658-6663Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). The cooperative action between the Sir proteins thus helps to spread silencing to more internal regions of the telomeres. Two other proteins, Rif1p and Rif2p, also bind to Rap1p, and it has been suggested that the Rif proteins compete with Sir4p for binding to Rap1p (24.Hardy C.F. Sussel L. Shore D. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 801-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Yeast Ku is thought to be recruited to telomere ends and to antagonize the effect of Rif proteins, hence facilitating the recruitment of Sir proteins (25.Mishra K. Shore D. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1123-1126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). However, recent work has shown that Sir4p can also be recruited to telomeres independently of Ku (22.Luo K. Vega-Palas M.A. Grunstein M. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1528-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been suggested that S. cerevisiae Ku is not only bound to the most distal end of the chromosome but can also spread along the transcriptionally repressed subtelomeric regions (26.Martin S.G. Laroche T. Suka N. Grunstein M. Gasser S.M. Cell. 1999; 97: 621-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). To gain mechanistic insights into how Ku executes its varied functions, we have carried out screens to identify Ku mutants that separate its role in DSB repair from its involvement in silencing of telomere-proximal genes. Here, we describe a class of Yku80p mutants that is dysfunctional in telomeric silencing but not DNA repair and reveal that these mutants are impaired in a newly defined interaction between Yku80p and Sir4p. These results provide insights into how Ku influences TPE through the formation of telomeric heterochromatin. Media, Growth Conditions, and Antibodies—Yeast strains were grown using standard conditions (27.Sherman F. Fink G.R. Launrence C. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1979Google Scholar). Assays for sensitivity to methyl methane sulfonate (MMS) and 5-fluoro-orotic acid (5-FOA) were done as described previously (6.Boulton S.J. Jackson S.P.

Plasmids, Yeast Strains, and DNA Manipulations—General DNA manipulations were performed according to established methods. Plasmids used were as follows: pRS413, selectable marker HIS3; pBTM116, selectable marker TRP1; pSH18–34, selectable marker URA3 with the β-galactosidase gene under the control of six LexA binding sites; pEG202, selectable marker HIS3 and expresses a LexA DNA binding domain; and pJG4–5, selectable marker TRP1 and expresses a B-42 transcription activation domain with an SV40 nuclear localization sequence. Yeast strains used are listed in Table I. Bacterial plasmid DNA extraction was performed using a mini plasmid isolation kit (Qiagen). Genomic or plasmid DNA from yeast was isolated as outlined previously (28.Ausbel, F., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, G. E., Smith, J. A., and Struhl, K. (1991) Current Protocols Mol. Biol.Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Transformation of yeast strains was performed by the lithium acetate method (29.Agatep, R., Kirkpatrick, R. D., Parchaliuk, D. L., Woods, R. A., and Geitz, R. D. (1998) Technical Tips Online, tto.trends.comGoogle Scholar). Plasmid repair assays were done as described previously (8.Boulton S.J. Jackson S.P.

Hunter R. Parker R. Yeast. 1992; 8: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). YKU80 was mutagenized using the primers YKu80–2 (5′-ATGTCAAGTGAGTCAACAACTTTCATCGTG-3′) and YKu80–3(5′-TAATTATTGCTATTGTTTGGACTTCCCCT-3′). PCR conditions were optimized to give 1–3 mutations in the final product. 10 independent PCR reactions were pooled, and the 1890-bp YKU80 band was gel-purified. Vector DNA was prepared by digesting pRS413 carrying full-length YKU80 (pYKU80FL) with SnaBI, which makes a single blunt-ended cut in the YKU80 open reading frame, 1 kb downstream of the start codon. The DNA was then dephosphorylated and gel-purified. PCR product (500 ng) was mixed with 250 ng of digested vector DNA (∼5:1 molar ratio of product to vector) and used to transform the strain UT80 bearing a yku80 deletion. Linearized pYKU80FL was recircularized by incorporation of the mutated YKU80 open reading frame by gap repair (31.Rothstein R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 281-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—The system used two reporter genes, lexAop-LEU2 and LexAop-lacZ (32.Brent R. Ptashne M. Cell. 1985; 43: 729-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Strain EGY48 was transformed with plasmids expressing LexA fusion of full-length YKU80 or YKU80 mutants and/or B42 activation domain fusions of SIR4 (plasmids used were pEG202 and pJG4–5, respectively) together with LexAop-lacZ reporter plasmid pSH18–34. The level of interaction between Yku80p and Sir4p was quantitated by yeast β-galactosidase assay kit (Pierce). For qualitative analysis, six independent colonies were restreaked on Ura/Trp/His-deficient plates containing raffinose. After 1–3 days of growth at 30 °C, a sample of each was resuspended in 0.5 ml of water and 5 μl of this were spotted onto the indicated plates in the presence of glucose or galactose. The development of blue color in the presence of X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside) was then monitored. Activation of the LEU2 reporter gene was monitored by plating on Ura/Trp/His/Leu-deficient plates in the presence of glucose or galactose. Coimmunoprecipitation Assay for Yku80p-Sir4p Interaction— YKU70 was cloned under control of the ADH1 promoter into plasmid pAH resulting in pAH-YKU70. YKU80wt and the YKU80 mutants were cloned under control of the ADH1 promoter into plasmid pAU, resulting in pAU-YKU80wt, pAU-YKU80D, and pAU-YKU80PF. Sir4-(1–200) was cloned in-frame into plasmid pRS314-GAL-HA (containing the GAL1–10 promoter followed by a three HA epitope). The resulting plasmid pRS314-GAL-HA-Sir4p-(1–200) contains a HA(3)-Sir4p-(1–200) fusion under control of the galactose-inducible GAL promoter. For protein extract preparation, the yku80-deficient strain W303h2 was cotransformed with pRS-314-GAL-HA-Sir4p-(1–200), pAH-YKU70, and pAU-YKU80wt (or pAU-Yku80D/pAU-Ylu80PF as indicated). As a control, strain W303h2 was cotransformed with pAH-YKU70, pAU-YKU80wt, and pRS314-GAL-HA as vector control. After overnight growth in selective medium containing raffinose, strains were diluted into YP medium containing 2% raffinose and 2% galactose to A600 = 0.2 and grown for 4–5 h to A600 = 1.0. After harvesting, cell pellets were washed in ice-cold water and disrupted using glass beads in a mini bead-beater. Cell disruption was performed in a buffer containing 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, and 500 mm NaCl. To remove cell debris, extracts were centrifuged at 20,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. Supernatant was adjusted to 100 mm NaCl using disruption buffer without NaCl and stored at –80 °C until use. Soluble protein extracts (1 mg) from the indicated strains were incubated with anti-HA antibody bound to protein G-Sepharose in a buffer containing 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 for 2 h at 4 °C. Protein G-Sepharose beads were washed twice with the same buffer containing 200 mm NaCl, twice with the buffer containing 0.2% Nonidet P-40 and 200 mm NaCl, twice in the buffer containing 0.25% Nonidet P-40, and 200 mm NaCl, and twice with buffer containing only 200 mm NaCl. Such extensive washing was necessary to remove the high nonspecific binding. The protein bound to the beads were eluted in sample buffer and resolved in a 10% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and immunoblotted with a rat monoclonal antibody raised against Yku80p. Subsequently, the blot was stripped with 100 mm glycine (pH 2.9) and probed with anti-HA monoclonal antibody. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Analysis for Telomere Localization of MYC-Yku80p—ChIP was done as described previously (33.Rouse J. Jackson S.P. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 857-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 34.Strahl-Bolsinger S. Hecht A. Luo K. Grunstein M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). After sonication of extracts, a portion (5–10%) of each sample was kept for future analysis as INPUT. Immunoprecipitation with anti-MYC antibody and DNA extraction were carried out as described previously (33.Rouse J. Jackson S.P. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 857-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The INPUT and immunoprecipitated (IP) samples were incubated at 65 °C overnight to revert formaldehyde cross-linking prior to DNA purification. The extracted DNA was resuspended in water (100 μl for each input samples and 40 μl for each IP). A portion of each sample (10 μl of input and 20 μl of IP) was incubated at 95 °C followed by 10 min on ice. Samples were transferred to Hybond-N, pre-equilibrated in 10× SSC, using a dot-blot manifold. After baking at 80 °C for 20 min, each side of the Hybond-N membrane was cross-linked by exposing to 800 J/m2 UV-C before prehybridization in Church buffer (0.25 m sodium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 1% bovine serum albumen, and 7% SDS). A 300-bp EcoRI fragment containing yeast telomeric repeat sequence (35.Dionne I. Wellinger R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5365-5371Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) or a 600-bp KpnI fragment derived from the telomere proximal side of subtelomeric Y′-element (36.Dionne I. Wellinger R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13902-13907Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) was used as a probe. A PCR product corresponding to the LCD1 open reading frame was used as a control probe. DNA fragments were radioactively labeled by random priming using the Prime-It Kit (Promega). The PhosphorImager signals obtained were quantified using MacBas image analysis software (Fuji). ChIP Assay for HA(3)-Sir3p Localization—ChIP assays were done as described above. Immunoprecipitation was performed with 6 μg of anti-HA monoclonal antibody overnight at 4 °C, and immunocomplexes were purified with protein G-Sepharose. Both INPUT and immunoprecipitated DNA were analyzed by semi-quantitative PCR in the presence of radiolabeled [α-32P]dATP. Primers used were specific for a 380-bp region at the chromosome VI right telomere and a 310-bp region at the HMR loci. PCR products were resolved on 10% polyacrylamide gel. Thereafter, the gel was dried and exposed to a phosphorimaging screen. PCR products were then quantitated by densitometric analysis of the bands using MacBas image analysis software. Isolation of Separation-of-function Mutants of YKU80 —A PCR-based procedure was used to generate mutations in the YKU80 open reading frame and to generate a library of yku80 mutants in pRS413. This was then transformed into yku80-deficient strain UT80, which contains URA3 integrated into the subtelomeric region of chromosome VII. This URA3 gene is subject to TPE and is consequently transcriptionally silent in the presence of active YKU80 but is derepressed when the silencing functions of YKU80 are impaired. By measuring growth in medium containing 5-FOA, a uracil analogue that is lethal to cells able to metabolize uracil, it is therefore possible to determine the transcriptional status of the telomere-associated URA3 marker. To screen yeast clones containing PCR-mutagenized YKU80 for defects in silencing, we plated them onto selective medium with or without 5-FOA and also tested them in parallel for their sensitivity to MMS, which causes DNA base alkylation damage that ultimately results in the generation of DNA DSBs (37.Swenson D.H. Harbach P.R. Trzos R.J. Carcinogenesis. 1980; 1: 931-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Of the 300 colonies screened, approximately 80% were indistinguishable from the wild-type YKU80 control (yku80-deficient strain containing low copy vector pRS413 carrying full-length YKU80 under the control of its own promoter), whereas ∼15% behaved as yku80 null mutants (MMS hypersensitive and defective in TPE as evidenced by non-viability on 5-FOA). Such strains were not pursued further. Instead, we focused on those remaining mutants that grew as well as the control wild-type YKU80 strain in the presence of MMS but were significantly impaired for growth on 5-FOA, suggesting a specific defect in TPE. The plasmids carrying mutated yku80 were rescued from this set of transformants and were then retransformed into strain UT80 to confirm their phenotypes. A closer examination of these mutants revealed that most also exhibited defects in DNA repair. However, two of the clones were consistently found to be dysfunctional only in TPE and displayed no discernable MMS hypersensitivity. Importantly, Western blot analysis revealed that each mutant protein was expressed at a level comparable to that of wild-type Yku80p (data not shown). Sequence analysis revealed that one of the mutants had a Asp to Gly mutation at residue 441 (referred to as Yku80D), whereas the other contained the clustered double mutation Pro-Phe to Ala-Ala at residues 437 and 438 (referred to as Yku80PF). Strikingly, these mutations map to a region that is highly conserved in Ku80 and Ku70 (Fig. 1a) (see Ref. 38.Gell D. Jackson S.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3494-3502Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Therefore, these data imply that this region of Yku80p plays a key role in telomeric silencing. The phenotypes caused by the yku80D(441)G and yku80PF-(437,438)AA mutations were confirmed by introducing them into wild-type YKU80 by site-directed mutagenesis and then transforming the resulting mutant yku80 alleles into the strain UT80. Drop-test growth assays revealed that both mutants were indeed hypersensitive to 5-FOA but not to MMS (Fig. 1b) or to phleomycin (data not shown), confirming their separation-of-function phenotypes. The yku80D mutant was, however, consistently more sensitive to 5-FOA than the yku80PF mutant, suggesting that the two mutants differ in the degree to which TPE is impaired. Further Analysis of NHEJ in the yku80-silencing Defective Mutants—To fully ascertain the NHEJ phenotypes of the yku80D and yku80PF mutants, we employed a transformation-based in vivo plasmid repair assay (6.Boulton S.J. Jackson S.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4639-4648Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 8.Boulton S.J. Jackson S.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5093-5103Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Thus, yku80-deleted strain UT80 expressing these mutants or wild-type YKU80 was transformed with pBTM116 that had been linearized with EcoRI. The number of resulting transformants was then ascertained and normalized to the number of colonies arising from a parallel series of transformations with supercoiled pBTM116. In line with previous findings (6.Boulton S.J. Jackson S.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4639-4648Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 8.Boulton S.J. Jackson S.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5093-5103Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 9.Boulton S.J. Jackson S.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1819-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar), the Δyku80 strain displayed a dramatic decrease in end-joining efficiency compared with the Δyku80 strain complemented with full-length YKU80. Notably, however, the yku80D and yku80PF mutants each showed a high level of NHEJ that was essentially indistinguishable from that of the strain expressing wild-type Yku80p (Fig. 2). These results therefore confirm that the yku80D and yku80PF mutants are not impaired in NHEJ. TPE-deficient Yku80p Mutants Localize to Terminal but Not Internal Telomeric Regions—Although the localization of yeast Ku to chromosome ends appears to be independent of other factors involved in telomeric silencing, its localization to more internal subtelomeric regions depends on Sir4p (26.Martin S.G. Laroche T. Suka N. Grunstein M. Gasser S.M. Cell. 1999; 97: 621-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). To see whether the TPE-deficient Yku80p derivatives were impaired in any telomere interactions, we performed ChIP experiments using MYC-tagged derivatives of the mutants and wild-type Yku80p. Thus, after protein-DNA cross-linking of cells, the wild-type and mutant proteins were immunoprecipitated using an anti-MYC monoclonal antibody and the immunoprecipitates were then analyzed for the presence of telomeric DNA by dot-blot hybridization with a radioactively labeled probe corresponding to the terminal telomeric TG(1–3) repeats. Perhaps surprisingly, telomeric DNA was detected in the anti-MYC immunoprecipitates from both mutants and the magnitude of the hybridization signal was similar to that obtained with MYC-tagged wild-type Yku80p (Fig. 3a). By contrast, when immunoprecipitations were performed in the absence of prior cross-linking, no hybridization to the telomeric probe was detected (data not shown). In addition, no telomeric DNA was retrieved from cells expressing untagged mutant or untagged wild-type Yku80p or from the Δyku80 strain (Fig. 3a). Furthermore, no enrichment of DNA from a control locus (LCD1) was observed in any of the immunoprecipitates. Quantification of telomere signals in immunoprecipitates relative to the input and to the signal from a nonspecific LCD1 locus further confirmed this result. Taken together, these data indicate that the TPE-defective Yku80p mutants are still recruited to the terminal telomeric region. We next tested for the recruitment of wild-type and mutated Yku80p derivatives to internal subtelomeric regions by using a probe corresponding to the telomere-proximal side of the subtelomeric Y′-element, which is ∼870 bp from the start of the telomeric TG(1–3) sequences (36.Dionne I. Wellinger R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13902-13907Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). As Sir4p is required for the recruitment of Yku80p to internal telomeric sequences (26.Martin S.G. Laroche T. Suka N. Grunstein M. Gasser S.M. Cell. 1999; 97: 621-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), a control strain (DMR428D80) complemented with MYC-tagged wild-type Yku80p was used. In this strain, the genomic copy of SIR4 is driven by the galactose-inducible promoter. Consequently and as shown previously (26.Martin S.G. Laroche T. Suka N. Grunstein M. Gasser S.M. Cell. 1999; 97: 621-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), we detected subtelomeric Y′-DNA in anti-MYC immunoprecipitates from this strain when it had been grown in the presence of galactose but not when Sir4p expression was repressed by growth in the presence of glucose (Fig. 3b, left panel). Also consistent with previous results, subtelomeric Y′-DNA was immunoprecipitated from strains expressing MYC-tagged Yku80p but not untagged strains. Interestingly, no enrichment of subtelomeric DNA was observed from cells expressing MYC-tagged derivatives of the TPE-deficient Yku80p mutants compared with the untagged control (Fig. 3b, right panel). This experiment was performed multiple times, and in each case, enrichment of subtelomeric DNA was observed with MYC-tagged wild-type Yku80p but not the MYC-tagged mutants when compared with their respective untagged controls. Therefore, these data imply that the TPE-deficient Yku80p mutants are defective in their recruitment to the internal subtelomeric sequences. Yku80p Interacts with Sir4p—The Sir protein complex is essential for the establishment of transcriptional silencing at yeast telomeres (18.Aparicio O.M. Billington B.L. Gottschling D.E"
https://openalex.org/W2040516317,"We identified a cDNA clone for epiprofin, which is preferentially expressed in teeth, by differential hybridization using DNA microarrays from an embryonic day 19.5 mouse molar cDNA library. Sequence analysis revealed that this cDNA encodes a member of the Krüppel-like factor family containing three characteristic C2H2-type zinc finger motifs. The full-length cDNA was obtained by the 5′ Cap capture method. Except for its 5′-terminal sequence, the epiprofin mRNA sequence is almost identical to the predicted sequence of Krüppel-like factor 14/Sp6 (specificity protein 6), which was previously identified in expressed sequence tag data bases and GenBank™ by an Sp1 zinc finger DNA-binding domain search (Scohy, S., Gabant, P., Van Reeth, T., Hertveldt, V., Dreze, P. L., Van Vooren, P., Riviere, M., Szpirer, J., and Szpirer, C. (2000) Genomics 70, 93-101). This sequence difference is due to differences in the assignment of the location of exon 1. In situ hybridization revealed that epiprofin mRNA is expressed by proliferating dental epithelium, differentiated odontoblast, and also hair follicle matrix epithelium. In addition, whole mount in situ hybridization showed transient expression of epiprofin mRNA in cells of the apical ectodermal ridge in developing limbs and the posterior neuropore. Transfection of an epiprofin expression vector revealed that this molecule is localized in the nucleus and promotes cell proliferation. Thus, epiprofin is a highly cell- and tissue-specific nuclear protein expressed primarily by proliferating epithelial cells of teeth, hair follicles, and limbs that may function in the development of these tissues by regulating cell growth. We identified a cDNA clone for epiprofin, which is preferentially expressed in teeth, by differential hybridization using DNA microarrays from an embryonic day 19.5 mouse molar cDNA library. Sequence analysis revealed that this cDNA encodes a member of the Krüppel-like factor family containing three characteristic C2H2-type zinc finger motifs. The full-length cDNA was obtained by the 5′ Cap capture method.

Thus, epiprofin is a highly cell- and tissue-specific nuclear protein expressed primarily by proliferating epithelial cells of teeth, hair follicles, and limbs that may function in the development of these tissues by regulating cell growth. Many vertebrate organs begin their development by inductive interactions between epithelium and mesenchyme. Tooth development is a classic example of this process and provides a useful experimental system for understanding the molecular mechanisms of organogenesis (2.Aberg T. Wozney J. Thesleff I. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 210: 383-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 3.Jernvall J. Thesleff I. Mech. Dev. 2000; 92: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). Mouse molar tooth development is initiated at embryonic day (E) 11.5, 1The abbreviations used are: En, embryonic day n; KLF, Krüppel-like factor; RT, reverse transcription; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BrdU, 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine; Sp, specificity protein. 1The abbreviations used are: En, embryonic day n; KLF, Krüppel-like factor; RT, reverse transcription; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BrdU, 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine; Sp, specificity protein. when the oral epithelium thickens and invaginates into the underlying neural crest-derived mesenchyme (4.Cohn S.A. Am. J. Anat. 1957; 101: 220-295Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Continuation of this invagination process results in the formation of epithelial tooth buds at E13.5. Ectomesenchymal cells surrounding the bud form the dental papilla, which later develop into dentin-secreting odontoblasts and the tooth pulp. After the bud stage, the tooth germ progresses to the cap and bell stages, and epithelial cells differentiate into enamel-secreting ameloblasts. All of these stages can be seen simultaneously along incisors of rodents, which continuously grow and erupt throughout life (5.Leblond C.P. Warshawsky H. J. Dent. Res. 1979; 58: 950-975Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Dental epithelium differentiates into ameloblasts through several distinct stages: 1) the presecretory stage, 2) the secretory stage, 3) the early maturation stage, and 4) the late maturation stage (6.Warshawsky H. Smith C.E. Anat. Rec. 1974; 179: 423-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). At the presecretory stage, dental epithelium proliferates. At the secretory stage, the cells stop proliferating and differentiate into ameloblasts, which secrete enamel matrix proteins including amelogenin, ameloblastin, enamelin, and tuftelin. During the maturation stage, the enamel matrix is almost completely replaced by calcium and phosphorous, and ameloblasts eventually undergo apoptosis (7.Smith C.E. Crit. Rev. Oral. Biol. Med. 1998; 9: 128-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar).The Sp/KLF family consists of more than 21 proteins in humans and 17 in mice, and this family has unique features including a DNA-binding domain with three tandem C2H2-type (Krüppel-like) zinc finger motifs at the C terminus and a transcriptional regulatory domain at the N terminus (8.Turner Jr., C.A. Mack D.H. Davis M.M. Cell. 1994; 77: 297-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar, 9.Philipsen S. Suske G.

This protein family can be divided into several classes by its sequence and functional similarities, including an Sp1-like subgroup and two KLF subgroups. Some of these proteins, such as Sp1 and BTEB1/KLF9, are ubiquitously expressed (11.Kadonaga J.T. Carner K.R. Masiarz F.R. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 51: 1079-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar, 12.Imataka H. Sogawa K. Yasumoto K. Kikuchi Y. Sasano K. Kobayashi A. Hayami M. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3663-3671Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), whereas others, such as EKLF/KLF1 and LKLF/KLF2, are expressed in a tissue-specific manner (13.Miller I.J. Bieker J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2776-2786Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar, 14.Anderson K.P. Kern C.B. Crable S.C. Lingrel J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5957-5965Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). KLF13 and KLF14/Sp6 were identified by screening a mouse expressed sequence tag data base using the Sp1 zinc finger domain as a probe and were reported to be ubiquitous by RT-PCR analysis (1.Scohy S. Gabant P. Van Reeth T. Hertveldt V. Dreze P.L. Van Vooren P. Riviere M. Szpirer J. Szpirer C. Genomics. 2000; 70: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Sp/KLF protein factors regulate a wide range of cellular functions including cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, and tumor formation. Although the sequence of the zinc finger domain is highly conserved and binds many GC-rich sequences in vitro, the N-terminal regulatory domain is considerably diverse within the family. Each factor can act as either an activator, or repressor, or both, and they are thought to interact with different promoters and/or with other coregulators. Some Sp/KLF family proteins have been shown to play essential roles in tooth and skin formation. For example, Sp3 knockout mice revealed growth retardation and defective tooth enamel formation caused by the lack of the enamel matrix proteins amelogenin and ameloblastin (15.Bouwman P. Gollner H. Elsasser H.P. Eckhoff G. Karis A. Grosveld F. Philipsen S. Suske G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). KLF4 knockout mice die perinatally because of loss of the barrier function of the skin (16.Segre J.A. Bauer C. Fuchs E. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 356-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar).In this report, we isolated a cDNA clone for epiprofin from a mouse E19.5 molar cDNA library by differential screening using DNA microarrays. Sequence analysis revealed that epiprofin is encoded by the Sp6/KPL14 gene and has nearly the same sequence as the previously predicted sequence for Sp6/KPL14 except for a difference in the N terminus. Overexpression of epiprofin promoted cell proliferation in cell culture, suggesting that epiprofin regulates epithelial growth and thereby plays a role in the development of these tissues.MATERIALS AND METHODSCloning of Epiprofin cDNA—A mouse E19.5 molar tooth cDNA library was constructed and screened by differential hybridization using DNA microarrays. 2T. Nakamura, F. Unda, S. de-Vega, A. Vilaxa, S. Fukumoto, K. M. Yamada, and Y. Yamada, manuscript in preparation. Briefly, a cDNA library was constructed in the λZAPII vector (Stratagene) using mRNA from molars of E19.5 mouse embryos. 10,000 cDNA clones were isolated randomly from the E19.5 molar cDNA library using the AGTC kit (Edge BioSystem) and amplified by PCR. The PCR products were printed onto polylysine-coated glass slides with a robotic arrayer (Cartesian Technologies, PixSys 5500) and were UV cross-linked using a UV Stratalinker (Stratagene). Total RNA from E19.5 mouse molars and bodies minus heads was isolated by using the RNeasy Midi RNA isolation kit (Qiagen) and reverse transcribed using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) in the presence of Cy3-dCTP or Cy5-dCTP (Amersham Biosciences), respectively. The DNA slides were hybridized with a mixture of both Cy3- and Cy5-labeled probes as described (17.Shalon D. Smith S.J. Brown P.O. Genome Res. 1996; 6: 639-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar) and scanned in a ScanArray 4000 (GSI Lumonics). Eleven clones for potential new genes were preferentially hybridized to molar mRNA, and one of these clones that we named epiprofin was further characterized in this paper. The 5′ terminus of the M20 transcript was obtained by the GeneRacer primer extension kit (Invitrogen) using E19.5 molar RNA with the primer (5′-CGACUGGAGCACGAGGACACUGACAUGGACUGAAGGAGUAGAAA-3′). The primer-extended PCR product was cloned into the pCR4-TOPO (Invitrogen) vector for sequencing. The full-length cDNA for epiprofin was obtained by RT-PCR using RNA from newborn mouse molars (NCBI GenBank™ accession number AY338955). The 5′ region of the gene for epiprofin including the promoter and exon 1 was obtained by PCR using mouse genomic DNA and sequenced (NCBI GenBank™ accession number AY338956).Plasmid Construction and Transfection—Green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion proteins were generated in the expression vectors pcDNA3.1/NT-GFP-TOPO and pcDNA3.1/CT-GFP-TOPO (Invitrogen). The coding sequence of epiprofin was subcloned into the GFP vectors pcDNA3.1/NT-GFP-TOPO (pGFP-M20) and pcDNA3.1/CT-GFP-TOPO (pM20-GFP) (Invitrogen). The sequence for the full-length epiprofin (1-376) (pTKLF/Myc) and truncated epiprofin containing the zinc finger domain only (255-376) (pTKLF-Zn/Myc) were subcloned into the pcDNA3.1/Myc-His (Invitrogen) vector. COS7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and transfected with plasmids using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). Twenty hours after transfection, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 20 min at room temperature. Hoechst dye (Sigma) was used to identify cell nuclei. GFP and Hoechst images were obtained with a Zeiss Axiophot microscope equipped with a Photometrix CH 350 cooled CCD camera. The digital images and image overlays were obtained using MetaMorph 3.5 software.RT-PCR and Northern Hybridization—Total RNA was extracted from newborn mouse tissues using the Trizol reagent kit (Invitrogen). Two μg of total RNA was used for reverse transcription to generate cDNA, which was used as a template for PCRs with gene-specific primers. Each cDNA was amplified with an initial denaturation at 95 °C for 3 min; then 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s for 25 cycles; and a final elongation step at 72 °C for 5 min and then separated on agarose gels. For Northern blotting, 20 μg of total RNA was separated by electrophoresis and transferred to a Nytran membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) as previously described (18.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Extraction, Purification and Analysis of Messenger RNA from Eukaryotic Cells: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The mouse multiple tissue Northern blot was obtained from Clontech. Labeling of cDNA was performed with [α-32P]dCTP using Ready-To-Go DNA labeling beads (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were hybridized with labeled probes at 68 °C in QuikHyb (Stratagene), washed first at 65 °C in 1× SSC with 0.1% SDS and then at 65 °C in 0.1× SSC with 0.1% SDS and exposed to autoradiography film (Kodak).In Situ Hybridization of Tissue Sections and Whole Mount in Situ Hybridization—Digoxigenin-11-UTP-labeled single-stranded RNA probes for epiprofin and amelogenin (Amel) were prepared using the DIG RNA labeling kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In situ hybridization of the tissue sections was performed as described previously (19.Hirota S. Ito A. Morii E. Wanaka A. Tohyama M. Kitamura Y. Nomura S. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1992; 15: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Frozen tissue sections of mouse head embryos (E12.5-19.5) containing molars and incisors were generated and placed on RNase-free glass slides. After drying the frozen sections for 20 min at room temperature, the sections were treated with 10 μg/ml of proteinase K for 15 min at room temperature. Hybridization was performed in 2× SSC containing 50% formamide at 50 °C, and washes were carried out with 2× SSC containing 50% formamide at 65 °C. The slides were then subjected to digestion with 10 μg/ml RNase A in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA at 37 °C for 30 min and then washed. The sections were treated with 2.4 mg/ml Levamisol (Sigma) to inactivate endogenous alkaline phosphatase. The Genius Detection System (Roche Applied Science) was used to detect signals according to the manufacturer's instructions. For whole mount in situ hybridization, E8.5-14.5 mouse embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS overnight, dehydrated in methanol, and kept at -20 °C until analyzed. Whole mount RNA in situ hybridization was carried out according to Nieto et al. (20.Nieto M.A. Patel K. Wilkinson D.G. Methods Cell Biol. 1996; 51: 219-235Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Cell Proliferation Assay—COS7 cells and primary dental epithelial cells were used for proliferation assays. Primary dental epithelial cells were prepared from molars of newborn mice. After molars were digested by 0.1% collagenase, 0.05% trypsin, 0.5 mm EDTA for 10 min, dental epithelium was separated from dental mesenchyme. Dental epithelium was further treated with 0.1% collagenase, 0.05% trypsin, 0.5 mm EDTA for 15 min and was cultured in keratinocyte-SFM medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with epidermal growth factor and bovine pituitary extract for 7 days to remove contaminated mesenchymal cells before transfection. The cells transfected with pTKLF/Myc, pTKLF-Zn/Myc, or empty vector were seeded at a density of 5.0 × 103 cells/well in 24-well plates and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% fetal bovine serum for COS7 cells and keratinocyte-SFM medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with epidermal growth factor and bovine pituitary extract for dental epithelial cells. The cell numbers were counted under a microscope. The cell proliferation assays were also performed by incorporation of 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU). Three days after transfection, the cells were incubated with 10 μm BrdU and 10% fetal bovine serum for 1 h. The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS and permeabilized by 0.5% Triton X-100. The transfected cells were incubated with 1% bovine serum albumin/TBS for 1 h and then with anti-BrdU antibody (Roche Applied Science). Anti-BrdU antibodies were visualized by Cy-2-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch, PA). Cy-3-conjugated anti-Myc antibody was used for detection of pTKLF/Myc or pTKLF-Zn/Myc. Nuclear staining was performed with Hoechst dye (Sigma).For cell proliferation assays using BrdU in embryonic dental tissue, BrdU (50 mg/kg of body weight) was diluted in PBS and intraperitoneally injected into timed pregnant mice. The animals were sacrificed 2 h after injection. Embryo heads (E12.5, 14.5, 17.5, and 19.5) were fixed in Bouin-Hollande, wax-embedded, and sectioned at 5 μm. The sections were treated with 2 n HCl at 37 °C for 45 min. To block endogenous peroxidase, the samples were incubated with 0.3% H2O2 in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Immunochemical reaction was carried out by incubating the sections containing first lower molars with a monoclonal anti-BrdU antibody (1:20 dilution, Merck) overnight at 4 °C. After washing, biotin-labeled secondary antibody was added to the sections. The color reaction was performed by the ABC method (Vector) followed by diaminobenzidine and H2O2 at room temperature. The sections were counterstained with eosin.RESULTScDNA and Gene Structure of Epiprofin (Sp6/KLF14)—DNA microarrays containing about 10,000 cDNA clones from a mouse E19.5 molar cDNA library were differentially hybridized with mRNA from E19.5 molars versus body. About 200 clones showed preferential hybridization to molar mRNA. Sequencing of these clones identified seven clones that matched sequences in the expressed sequence tag data base. One of the seven clones corresponded to the 3′ portion of Sp6/KLF14 cDNA. We named this protein epiprofin, because its expression is primarily restricted to epithelium in certain tissues as described below. The coding sequence of Sp6/KLF14 cDNA was previously predicted on the basis of composite sequences from the mouse gene and expressed sequence tags (1.Scohy S. Gabant P. Van Reeth T. Hertveldt V. Dreze P.L. Van Vooren P. Riviere M. Szpirer J. Szpirer C. Genomics. 2000; 70: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To obtain the 5′ end of epiprofin cDNA to compare it with Sp6/KLF14 cDNA, we performed 5′ Cap rapid amplification of cDNA ends PCR using mouse E18 molar RNA with specific extension primers for epiprofin and cloned into the pCR4-TOPO vector. All of the extended clones picked for sequencing showed an identical 5′ end. The 5′ 48-bp sequence of epiprofin mRNA differed from the 5′ sequence of the presumptive full-length Sp6/KLF14 mRNA, but the remaining 3′ sequence corresponding to exon 2 was identical except for a few silent base substitutions (Fig. 1, B and C). Comparison of the epiprofin mRNA sequence and the gene for Sp6/KLF14 from NCBI GenBank™ (accession number AL606664) and Celera Genomics data bases (ID CG13224) revealed that the 42-bp sequence is located 7.5 kb upstream from exon 2 and likely represents exon 1, which is flanked by sequences characteristic for the Cap signal at the 5′ side and splicing site at the 3′ side (Fig. 1, A and B). A TATA box is located at position -25 bp, but there is no CAAAT motif in this region. The 5′ 280-bp region containing the 180-bp promoter, 42-bp exon 1, and intron 1 showed a substantial sequence homology (80% identity) in mice and humans. The sequence immediately upstream of exon 1 showed the conserved Cap motif for transcription initiation, and the boundary of exons 1 and 2 contained the consensus donor and acceptor sequences (Fig. 1, A and B). Transfection with a reporter gene construct containing the -200 to +30 bp promoter and SV40 enhancer confirmed that this region has basal promoter activity (data not shown). The presumptive exon 1 sequence of the Sp6/KLF14 gene previously proposed by computer analysis shows poor sequence homology (40% identity) between mice and humans, and this sequence is located about 2.2 kb upstream of exon 2 (dotted line and broken box in Fig. 1A). The presumptive promoter immediately adjacent to this sequence shows no significant sequence homology between mice and humans. Fig. 1C shows the reported presumptive 5′ sequence for Sp6/KLF14 with underlined nucleotide and amino acid sequences different from these of epiprofin (nucleotide sequence including the presumptive promoter and 5′ coding sequences and the N-terminal amino acid sequence) (1.Scohy S. Gabant P. Van Reeth T. Hertveldt V. Dreze P.L. Van Vooren P. Riviere M. Szpirer J. Szpirer C. Genomics. 2000; 70: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).The 42-bp exon 1 contains an ATG at +35, and exon 2 also has an ATG at +95. The first ATG is not in a favorable context for the initiation of protein translation according to Kozak (21.Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2794) Google Scholar) and is followed by a premature termination codon (Fig. 1B). By contrast, the second ATG in exon 2 is adjacent to the consensus Kozak sequence. It is therefore likely that major mRNA translation initiates at this second ATG codon. This prediction was confirmed by GFP fusion protein expression analysis in which the second ATG was capable of initiating translation (see Fig. 8). The second ATG is followed by a sequence with an open reading frame for 376 amino acids plus a 2.2-kb 3′ noncoding sequence containing the consensus polyadenylation signal (Fig. 1B). The predicted protein sequence contains three contiguous zinc finger motifs present near the C-terminal end and two potential nuclear localization signals PDGGKKK (amino acid residues 245-251) and PGGKGKR (amino acid residues 360-366) (Fig. 1B). The zinc finger domain has a high degree of homology with Sp3, Sp7/Osterix, Sp1, GKLF (KLF4), EKLF (KLF1), LKLF (KLF2), and BKLF (KLF3), with the highest with Sp3 and Sp7/Osterix (∼80% identity). In contrast to the zinc finger domain, the N-terminal domain of epiprofin (Sp6/KLF14) shows no homology to other known proteins.Fig. 8Nuclear localization of epiprofin.A and C, GFP staining in the nuclei of COS7 cells transfected with the epiprofin expression vector tagged with GFP at either the N or C terminus.

RT-PCR analysis revealed that epiprofin-specific primers produced a 517-bp product with RNA from newborn mouse molars and incisors (Fig. 2A). The primers also produced a faint 517-bp band with skin RNA but not with other tissue RNA. Primers for ameloblastin and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were used as positive controls for tooth-specific and ubiquitous mRNA, respectively. Northern blotting showed a single 3.6-kb mRNA band for epiprofin in molars but not in other tissues (Fig. 2B). Ameloblastin mRNA is expressed only in molars, and another control, β-actin mRNA, is expressed in all tissues. Thus, expression of epiprofin mRNA is highly tissue-specific. This conclusion is in contrast to the previous report of ubiquitous expression of Sp6/KLF14 (1.Scohy S. Gabant P. Van Reeth T. Hertveldt V. Dreze P.L. Van Vooren P. Riviere M. Szpirer J. Szpirer C.

Epiprofin mRNA was first detected at E11.5 in the dental epithelium of the first branchial arch and was continuously expressed in molars and incisors (E12.5-14.5). To identify which cell types express epiprofin mRNA, we performed in situ hybridization with sections of molars at various stages and compared its expression with cell proliferation by BrdU assays (Fig. 4). The expression of epiprofin mRNA was observed in E12.5, E14.5, and E17.5 inner dental epithelium but not other parts of dental tissues (Fig. 4, E-G). At E19.5 (Fig. 4H) and later (data not shown), epiprofin mRNA is expressed in the inner enamel epithelium (preameloblast/ameloblasts). Epiprofin mRNA is expressed weakly in differentiated odontoblasts (Fig. 4H). In newborn incisors, epiprofin mRNA is expressed by the dental epithelium of the cervical loop starting from the early stage to the secretory stage of ameloblasts (Fig. 5B). This is in contrast to amelogenin mRNA, which is predominantly expressed at the secretory stages of ameloblasts but not at the presecretory stage (Fig. 5C). Epiprofin mRNA is also expressed in mesenchymal odontoblasts of incisors (Fig. 5E), whereas amelogenin mRNA is not expressed in those cells (Fig. 5F). E18.5 mouse head sections showed the expression of epiprofin mRNA not only in molars and incisors but also in hair follicles (Fig. 6, A and C). The expression was observed in the proliferating epithelium of the inner root sheath in the matrix of hair follicles (Fig. 6D).Fig. 3Expression of epiprofin in mouse embryo lower mandibles by whole mount in situ hybridization using digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes.

BrdU is incorporated in the nuclei of epithelium and dental mesenchyme (dm) cells in bud, cap, and early bell stages (A-C). Note the absence of BrdU incorporation and epiprofin expression in the enamel knot (ek). Epiprofin transcripts are restricted to the inner dental epithelium (ide, E-G). At the late bell stage (E19.5), proliferative cells are found in the preameloblast (pam), intermediate stratum (is), and the preodontoblast and subodontoblast layers (arrowheads) (D).

https://openalex.org/W2059765843,"Tuberous sclerosis complex is a tumor suppressor gene syndrome whose manifestations can include seizures, mental retardation, and benign tumors of the brain, skin, heart, and kidneys. Hamartin and tuberin, the products of the TSC1 and TSC2 genes, respectively, form a complex and inhibit signaling by the mammalian target of rapamycin. Here, we demonstrate that endogenous hamartin is threonine-phosphorylated during nocodazole-induced G2/M arrest and during the G2/M phase of a normal cell cycle. In vitro assays showed that cyclin-dependent kinase 1 phosphorylates hamartin at three sites, one of which (Thr417) is in the hamartin-tuberin interaction domain. Tuberin interacts with phosphohamartin, and tuberin expression attenuates the phosphorylation of exogenous hamartin. Hamartin with alanine mutations in the three cyclin-dependent kinase 1 phosphorylation sites increased the inhibition of p70S6 kinase by the hamartin-tuberin complex. These findings support a model in which phosphorylation of hamartin regulates the function of the hamartin-tuberin complex during the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. Tuberous sclerosis complex is a tumor suppressor gene syndrome whose manifestations can include seizures, mental retardation, and benign tumors of the brain, skin, heart, and kidneys. Hamartin and tuberin, the products of the TSC1 and TSC2 genes, respectively, form a complex and inhibit signaling by the mammalian target of rapamycin.

Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6475-6480PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we report that endogenous hamartin is phosphorylated during G2/M, demonstrating for the first time that hamartin, like tuberin, is regulated by phosphorylation. Results from both in vitro and in vivo experiments indicate that hamartin is a substrate of the cyclin-dependent kinase CDK1 (cdc2), which is active in late cell cycle phases and promotes entry into mitosis when bound to cyclin B1 (reviewed in Refs. 35Ohi R. Gould K.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar and 36Nigg E.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). Hamartin is phosphorylated by CDK1 at three residues, the most highly conserved of which lies within the hamartin-tuberin interaction domain. A mutant form of hamartin that cannot be phosphorylated by CDK1 increased the inhibition of p70S6K by the hamartin-tuberin complex. These results suggest that regulation of the hamartin-tuberin complex during G2/M may play a role in the integration of cell division with cell size, protein synthesis, and/or growth factor signaling. Cells and Cell Treatments—HEK293 human embryonic kidney cells (ATCC CRL-1573) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. G2/M arrest was induced by treating the cells for 18.5 h with 70 ng/ml nocodazole or Taxol dissolved in Me2SO (all from Sigma). For cell cycle synchronization, the cells were treated with 500 μm hydroxyurea (Sigma) for 16 h, released in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, and harvested at different time points after release. For CDK1 inhibition, the cells were treated with 20 μm alsterpaullone (A.G. Scientific Inc., San Diego, CA). Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The constructs were cloned into pcDNA 3.1+ or pcDNA3.1+/His (Invitrogen). Transfections—The transfections were performed using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). Immunoblotting and Antibodies—The cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, supplemented by protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails I and II (Sigma)) unless otherwise specified. Ten μg of total cellular protein were resolved by 5%, 7.5%, or 4-20% SDS/PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The following antibodies were used to detect proteins by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences): anti-tuberin C20 (Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-hamartin (3Plank T.L. Yeung R.S. Henske E.P. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4766-4770PubMed Google Scholar), anti-β-actin (Sigma), anti-phosphotyrosine clone 4G10 (Upstate, Waltham, MA), anti-phosphotyrosine clone PY99 (Santa Cruz), anti-phosphothreonine-proline, anti-p70S6K, and anti-phosphoT389-p70S6K (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA). Flow Cytometry Analysis—The cell pellets were fixed in 70% ethanol and stained with 20 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma) containing 9.5 mg/ml RNase (Sigma). Flow cytometry was performed on a Becton-Dickinson FACScan machine. The percentages of cells in the G1, S, and G2/M phases of the cell cycle were determined using CellQUEST DNA Acquisition software (Becton-Dickinson). Immunoprecipitations—The cells were lysed on ice in RIPA or PTY buffer (50 mm HEPES, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 50 mm NaF). 500-1000 μg of total protein were incubated at 4 °C with anti-hamartin, anti-tuberin, or anti-TetraHis (Qiagen) antibodies for 1 h with constant rotation. Fifty μl of protein A-Sepharose bead slurry (Invitrogen) were added to the immunocomplexes and rotated at 4 °C for 16 h. The beads were washed in lysis buffer and boiled in Laemmli buffer (Bio-Rad). Phosphatase Assays—The hamartin immunoprecipitates were washed with either CIAP buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 1 mm MgCl2) or PP1 buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The beads were pelleted, resuspended in 100 μl of the respective phosphatase buffer, and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. The respective phosphatase (30 units of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIAP; Amersham Biosciences) or 0.5 unit of the PP1 (Sigma)) was added to the beads and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. The beads were pelleted and boiled in Laemmli buffer. CDK1/Cyclin B in Vitro Kinase Assay—Activated CDK1/cyclin B complexes were prepared by mixing His-tagged cyclin B bound to nickel beads with baculovirus-expressed recombinant CDK1, in the presence of 50 μm ATP and 10 mm MgCl2 (37Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The CDK1/cyclin B complex was eluted from the beads using 62.5 μl of imidazole buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 100 mm imidazole). The hamartin immunoprecipitates were washed in 500 μl of kinase buffer (40 mm HEPES, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, pH 7) and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in 25 μl of kinase buffer containing 100 μm ATP and 1 μl of activated CDK1/cyclin B complex. The reaction was terminated by boiling the beads in Laemmli buffer. p70S6K in Vitro Kinase Assay—Myc-S6K1 (a gift of Dr. Richard Lamb), TSC1, and TSC2 were transfected in HEK293 cells, and the cell lysates were prepared in PTY buffer after serum deprivation for 24 h. Ectopic p70S6K was immunoprecipitated with Myc-agarose beads (BD Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The beads were washed in ADBI buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 25 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol), and the p70S6K activity was measured using the S6 kinase assay kit (Upstate). Briefly, the immunocomplexes were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min with a substrate peptide containing the p70S6K consensus phosphorylation site in the presence of PKC/PKA inhibitors, 15 mm MgCl2, 100 μm ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reactions were spotted on P81 paper, air-dried, and washed in 0.75% phosphoric acid and acetone, and the radioactivity was measured in a scintillation counter. Nocodazole-induced Arrest Results in a Mobility Shift of Endogenous Hamartin—Under normal growth conditions, hamartin migrates predominantly as a single band in a Western immunoblot. During earlier work in which HEK293 cells were arrested with nocodazole (38Khare L. Astrinidis A. Senapedis W. Adams P. Henske E. J. Med. Genet. 2002; 39: 676-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), a second more slowly migrating band was observed (Fig. 1A). This band, which represented an apparent increase in the molecular mass of hamartin of ∼10 kDa, became evident after 16 h of nocodazole treatment when the majority of the cells were in G2/M (Fig. 1B). This upshift in hamartin was also seen in HEK293 cells after Taxol treatment (data not shown). Endogenous Hamartin Is Threonine-phosphorylated during Nocodazole Arrest—To determine whether the slower mobility band of hamartin was the result of phosphorylation, endogenous hamartin was immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted. As expected, an upshifted band was present in the immunoprecipitate after nocodazole-induced G2/M arrest (Fig. 2A, compare first and second lanes). Treatment of the immunoprecipitate with CIAP for 20 min at 37 °C abolished the upper band, demonstrating that hamartin is phosphorylated after nocodazole treatment. Treatment of the immunoprecipitate with PP1 removed the slower migrating hamartin band (Fig. 2A), suggesting that hamartin is phosphorylated at a serine and/or threonine residue after nocodazole treatment. Proline-directed kinases such as CDK1 are known to be active in mitotic cells, and the hamartin-tuberin complex has been previously shown to interact with CDK1 and cyclin B1 (39Catania M.G. Mischel P.S. Vinters H.V. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2001; 60: 711-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To determine whether a threonine-proline residue of hamartin was phosphorylated, the hamartin immunoprecipitate was immunoblotted with a phosphothreonine-proline antibody. An increase in threonine-proline-phosphorylated hamartin was present in nocodazole-treated cells (Fig. 2B), indicating that hamartin is phosphorylated at a threonine-proline residue and consistent with the result of the PP1 phosphatase experiment (Fig. 2A). In contrast, no immunoreactivity was observed with either of two phosphotyrosine-specific antibodies after nocodazole treatment (data not shown). The increase in threonine-proline phosphorylation of hamartin after nocodazole treatment was also seen in Cos7 cells (Fig. 2C). Nocodazole did not induce threonine-proline phosphorylation of tuberin (data not shown). Ectopically Expressed Hamartin Is Phosphorylated during Nocodazole Arrest, and Co-expression of Tuberin Attenuates Hamartin Phosphorylation—These experiments demonstrated that endogenous hamartin is threonine-proline-phosphorylated during nocodazole-induced G2/M arrest. To determine whether exogenous hamartin was also threonine-phosphorylated after nocodazole treatment, hamartin was overexpressed in HEK293 cells, immunoprecipitated, and immunoblotted with the phosphothreonine-proline antibody. An increase in the phosphorylation of exogenous hamartin was seen in cells treated with nocodazole (Fig. 3A). The phosphorylation of exogenous hamartin was reduced when both tuberin and hamartin were overexpressed, compared with overexpression of hamartin alone (Fig. 3A). Additionally, hamartin co-expressed with a mutant form of tuberin (TSC2R611Q), which does not interact with hamartin (40Nellist M. Verhaaf B. Goedbloed M.A. Reuser A.J. van den Ouweland A.M. Halley D.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 2889-2898Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), is phosphorylated even in the absence of nocodazole (Fig. 3B). This suggests that hamartin may be protected from phosphorylation when complexed with tuberin. Phosphorylation of Hamartin Does Not Alter the Interaction with Tuberin—An interaction between endogenous tuberin and endogenous phosphorylated hamartin was detected in tuberin immunoprecipitates of nocodazole-treated cells (Fig. 3C). No difference in the amount of co-immunoprecipitated tuberin was observed in His immunoprecipitates from cells expressing TSC2 and His-TSC1 (Fig. 3D). Taken together, these data indicate that phosphorylation of hamartin does not have a major effect on the interaction between hamartin and tuberin. Endogenous Hamartin Is Phosphorylated during the G2/M Phase of the Cell Cycle—Phosphorylation during nocodazole-induced arrest could indicate regulation of hamartin during G2/M phases of the normal cell cycle or alternatively reflect the cell response to microtubular damage. To determine whether endogenous hamartin is phosphorylated during the normal cell cycle, HEK293 cells were synchronized in the G1 phase with hydroxyurea followed by release into fresh medium. The cells were collected at 0, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 h and analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Hamartin was immunoprecipitated at each time point and immunoblotted with the hamartin and phosphothreonine-proline antibody (Fig. 4A). An increase in phosphothreonine-proline immunoreactivity was seen, with the highest immunoreactivity 12 h after release when 55% of the cells were in G2/M. An upshift in hamartin mobility was not detected in this experiment. This may indicate that fewer sites are phosphorylated during normal G2/M compared with prolonged exposure to active CDK1 during nocodazole-induced arrest. To determine whether the phosphorylation was reversible, the experiment was repeated with later time points (Fig. 4B). The increased phosphorylation was detected at 8, 10, and 12 h after release from hydroxyurea, when 48, 53, and 41% of the cells were in the G2/M phase, respectively, but not at 16 h, when only 27% of the cells were in the G2/M phase. A small amount of base-line phosphothreonine proline immunoreactivity was present at the 0- and 24-h time points, which could indicate persistence of the phosphorylation by CDK1 or the activity of another kinase. Hamartin Is Phosphorylated in Vitro by CDK1/Cyclin B—To determine whether CDK1 phosphorylates hamartin in vitro, immunoprecipitated hamartin was incubated with activated CDK1/cyclin B complexes. The amount of total protein used was normalized to the extent of overexpression prior to hamartin immunoprecipitation. An upshift in the mobility of endogenous hamartin was present after incubation with CDK1/cyclin B (Fig. 5A). A similar upshift was seen after kinase treatment of hamartin immunoprecipitates from cells with ectopic expression of hamartin only or co-expression of hamartin and tuberin (Fig. 5A). To establish the specificity of the CDK1/cyclin B complex on hamartin, the hamartin immunoprecipitates were incubated with two kinase-dead forms of CDK1 (T161A and N133A). The mobility shift was not observed with either kinase-dead form of CDK1 (Fig. 5B). To verify that the change in the mobility of hamartin was the result of phosphorylation, the product of the kinase assay was treated with CIAP or the serine/threonine phosphatase PP1, both of which restored the mobility of hamartin back to its base line (Fig. 5C). Hamartin Is Phosphorylated in Vivo by CDK1—To determine whether hamartin is phosphorylated in vivo by CDK1, the cells were treated with alsterpaullone, a CDK1 inhibitor, in the presence of nocodazole for 18.5 h. Hamartin was immunoprecipitated at endogenous levels and from cells overexpressing both hamartin and tuberin. The level of threonine-proline phosphorylation of hamartin was significantly reduced in the immunoprecipitates from cells treated with alsterpaullone (Fig. 6A). To determine whether alsterpaullone inhibits the phosphorylation of endogenous hamartin during the normal cell cycle, HEK293 cells were synchronized with hydroxyurea. Alsterpaullone was added 1 h prior to harvest. The cells were harvested 8, 10, 12, 16, and 24 h after hydroxyurea release. The cells treated with alsterpaullone had decreased hamartin phosphorylation at 12 h, when ∼49% of the cells were in G2 M (Fig. 6B, right panel), compared with untreated control cells (Fig. 6B, left panel). Mutation of Thr417, Ser584, and Thr1047 Blocks Phosphorylation of Hamartin in Vitro and in Vivo—The preferred consensus phosphorylation sequence for CDK1 is (S/T)PX(K/R) (41Songyang Z. Blechner S. Hoagland N. Hoekstra M.F. Piwnica-Worms H. Cantley L.C. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 973-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Hamartin contains three potential CDK1 sites: Thr417 (TPPR), Ser584 (SPCK), and Thr1047 (TPEK) (Fig. 7A). Thr417, the most highly evolutionarily conserved of the three potential sites, is within the hamartin-tuberin interaction domain (residues 302-430) (40Nellist M. Verhaaf B.

Cheadle J.P. DeClue J.E. Sampson J.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 2899-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Thr1047 is within the ezrin-radixin-moesin interaction domain of hamartin (residues 881-1084) (12Lamb R.F. Roy C. Diefenbach T.J. Vinters H.V. Johnson M.W. Jay D.G. Hall A. Nat.

These forms of hamartin were overexpressed with wild-type TSC2, immunoprecipitated, and tested for in vitro phosphorylation by CDK1. As shown in Fig. 7B, both of the single mutants showed an upshift in hamartin after incubation with CDK1/cyclin B, although the degree of the shift was less than that of wild-type hamartin. This result indicated that neither Thr417 nor Thr1047 was the sole site of in vitro CDK1 phosphorylation. The double mutant also showed a shift. The triple mutant (TSC1AAA), however, did not show a shift, suggesting that the mobility shift detected in vitro reflects phosphorylation at these three sites. In cells overexpressing the His-tagged triple phosphomutant hamartin (TSC1AAA), no increase in threonine-proline phosphorylation of immunoprecipitated hamartin was detected after nocodazole treatment (Fig. 8A) consistent with the hypothesis that Thr417 and Thr1047 are the predominant sites of threonine-proline phosphorylation. However, a more slowly migrating band appeared to be present after nocodazole treatment of cells expressing TSC1AAA, suggesting that sites not recognized by the phosphothreonine proline antibody may also be modified during nocodazole treatment. To determine whether the phosphomutant form of hamartin (TSC1AAA) can be phosphorylated in vivo, cells transfected with wild-type TSC1 or TSC1AAA were arrested in the G1/S phase with hydroxyurea and released. Similarly to Fig. 4, the cells transfected with wild-type TSC1 showed increased hamartin phosphorylation at 8, 10, and 12 h after release, whereas the TSC1AAA phosphomutant did not show increased phosphorylation (Fig. 8B). Expression of the Triple Phosphomutant Hamartin Does Not Block Nocodazole-induced Arrest and Does Not Alter the Cell Cycle Profile of HEK293 Cells—To determine whether phosphorylation of hamartin inhibits the ability of cells to arrest in nocodazole or alters cell cycle kinetics, tuberin was overexpressed with wild-type hamartin or triple phosphomutant hamartin (TSC1AAA). No differences were observed in the cell cycle profile of asynchronous or nocodazole-arrested cells (data not shown). Phosphomutant Hamartin Increases the Inhibition of p70S6K—To study the effect of hamartin phosphorylation on the activation of the mTOR/p70S6K pathway, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with Myc-S6K1 together with wild-type TSC2 and either wild-type TSC1 or TSC1AAA. Following immunoprecipitation of Myc-p70S6K, the activity of p70S6K was measured by an in vitro kinase assay. As previously reported by several groups, the p70S6K activity was decreased by the expression of the hamartin-tuberin complex. Expression of the nonphosphorylatable TSC1AAA further decreased the activity of p70S6K, compared with TSC1/TSC2 transfected cells (Fig. 9A). Western immunoblotting confirmed that the phosphorylation of p70S6K at residue Thr389 was decreased in cells transfected with hamartin phosphomutant compared with wild type both in the total cell lysates and in p70S6K immunoprecipitates (Fig. 9B). We then tested the tuberin AKT phosphomutant S939A/T1482A (TSC2AA) (27Manning B.D. Tee A.R. Logsdon M.N. Blenis J. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 10: 151-162Scopus (1277) Google Scholar). The magnitude of suppression of p70S6K phosphorylation was similar when TSC1AAA was expressed with wild-type TSC2, compared with wild-type TSC1 with TSC2AA. Co-expression of TSC1AAA with TSC2AA further decreased the phosphorylation of p70S6K (Fig. 9C). We report here that endogenous hamartin is threonine-phosphorylated during nocodazole-induced G2/M phase and also during the G2/M phase of the normal cell cycle. Both in vitro and in vivo studies indicate that hamartin is a direct target for phosphorylation by CDK1. In vitro, hamartin is phosphorylated at three sites (Thr417, Ser584, and Thr1047) by CDK1. In vivo, hamartin phosphorylation is blocked by the CDK1 inhibitor alsterpaullone, and hamartin with the three residues mutated to alanine (TSC1AAA) is not threonine-proline-phosphorylated during nocodazole-induced G2/M arrest or during G2/M progression of the normal cell cycle. Together, these findings indicate that CDK1 is the kinase responsible for the phosphorylation. Another group has previously reported that the hamartin-tuberin complex co-immunoprecipitates with CDK1, cyclin B1, and cyclin A (39Catania M.G. Mischel P.S. Vinters H.V. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2001; 60: 711-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), supporting the hypothesis that hamartin is directly phosphorylated by CDK1. To our knowledge, this is the first indication that endogenous hamartin is phosphorylated and that the hamartin-tuberin complex is specifically regulated during the cell cycle. The fact that endogenous hamartin is phosphorylated during the normal cell cycle suggests that hamartin phosphorylation has physiologic significance. The most highly conserved consensus CDK1 phosphorylation site of hamartin lies within the hamartin-tuberin interaction domain. However, we did not detect a difference in the interaction between hamartin and tuberin during nocodazole arrest. We also did not detect a difference in the cell cycle profile of asynchronous HEK293 cells or their ability to arrest in nocodazole when tuberin was co-expressed with the three forms of hamartin (data not shown). Phosphorylated hamartin from cells with endogenous expression of the two proteins co-immunoprecipitates with tuberin, and the amount of tuberin co-immunoprecipitating with hamartin is similar in nocodazole-treated and untreated cells. Co-expression of both tuberin and hamartin reduced the phosphorylation of hamartin both in vitro and in vivo, compared with expression of hamartin alone. Hamartin is constitutively phosphorylated when co-expressed with a patient-derived TSC2 mutant, which has been previously shown not to interact with hamartin (40Nellist M. Verhaaf B. Goedbloed M.A. Reuser A.J. van den Ouweland A.M. Halley D.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 2889-2898Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These data suggest that tuberin attenuates hamartin phosphorylation and/or that the primary substrate for phosphorylation is hamartin not complexed with tuberin. Studies from both Drosophila and mammalian cells have demonstrated that the hamartin-tuberin complex negatively regulates mTOR and p70S6K (9Potter C.J. Huang H. Xu T.

During mitosis, the activity of p70S6K is suppressed, in part by direct phosphorylation of the p70S6K autoinhibitory domain by CDK1 (44Papst P.J. Sugiyama H. Nagasawa M. Lucas J.J. Maller J.L.

It is known that cell cycle progression and cell growth are coordinated, yet separable, in mammalian cells (43Fingar D.C. Salama S. Tsou C. Harlow E. Blenis J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1472-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar) as well as in yeast and Drosophila, but the signaling pathways responsible for this coordination are not yet completely understood. We hypothesize that phosphorylation of hamartin by CDK1 in the G2/M phase regulates the activity, rather than the interaction, of the hamartin-tuberin complex during mitosis. If this is true, the phosphorylation of hamartin by CDK1 could play a central role in the coordination of cell cycle progression, cell growth, and cell size. Supporting this hypothesis, we found that a nonphosphorylatable form of hamartin (TSC1AAA) increased the inhibition of p70S6K by the hamartin-tuberin complex. The activity of p70S6K correlated with phosphorylation at residue Thr389, a key phosphorylation site and downstream target of mTOR. Phosphomutants for both TSC1 and TSC2 on CDK1 and AKT sites, respectively, acted together to further inhibit p70S6K phosphorylation compared with either mutant alone. Mutation of the three CDK1 sites inhibited threonine-proline phosphorylation of hamartin during nocodazole-induced arrest. However, a slower migrating hamartin band was seen after nocodazole treatment of cells expressing the mutant hamartin (Fig. 8A), suggesting that sites not recognized by the phosphothreonine proline antibody may also be modified during nocodazole treatment. These could be nonconsensus serine phosphorylations by CDK1, phosphorylation by other kinases, or other types of post-translational modifications. Additional experiments will be needed to determine the cause and biological relevance of these modifications. In conclusion, these data demonstrate that hamartin is phosphorylated by CDK1 during the G2/M phase of the cell cycle and indicate that hamartin phosphorylation does not alter the hamartin/tuberin interaction but instead regulates p70S6K activity during the G2/M phase. The regulation of p70S6K activity is complex, involving an ordered series of phosphorylation events that result in conformational changes. Multiple kinases directly phosphorylate p70S6K, including CDK1 (44Papst P.J. Sugiyama H. Nagasawa M. Lucas J.J. Maller J.L. Terada N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15077-15084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It seems surprising that phosphorylation of p70S6K by CDK1 results in decreased p70S6K activity (45Shah O.J. Ghosh S. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16433-16442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), whereas phosphorylation of hamartin by CDK1 may result in increased p70S6K activity. It is possible that these apparently opposing effects serve to balance p70S6K activity. Alternatively, p70S6K could be temporally regulated by CDK1. Direct phosphorylation by CDK1 inactivates p70S6K during early mitosis. During late mitosis/early G1 phase, the phosphorylation of hamartin by CDK1 could release the inhibition on p70S6K, allowing for increased protein synthesis and cellular growth. Further studies will be needed to address these issues. We thank Peter Adams and Jonathan Chernoff for critical review of the manuscript."

Further insight to ΔNp63α function is provided by animal models in which p63 expression is disrupted. Unlike p53 -/- mice, which are developmentally normal but rapidly develop tumors (11Donehower L.A. Harvey M. Slagle B.L. McArthur M.J. Montgomery Jr., C.A. Butel J.S. Bradley A. Nature. 1992; 356: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (3988) Google Scholar), p63 -/- mice display gross developmental abnormalities. The most striking of these is a complete lack of all stratified squamous epithelia and their derivatives, including epidermis, mammary glands, prostate, and other tissues (12Yang A. Schweitzer R.

This phenotype is recapitulated in zebrafish, in which disruption of ΔNp63 results in lack of epidermal morphogenesis (14Lee H. Kimelman D. Dev.

Overexpression of a ΔNp63 isoform in Rat-1A cells increases colony growth in soft agar and xenograft tumor formation in nude mice, supporting the view that p63 acts as an oncogene (16Hibi K. Trink B.

In addition, ΔNp63α must be down-regulated for UV-B-induced apoptosis to occur (20Liefer K.M. Koster M.I. Wang X.J. Yang A. McKeon F. Roop D.R. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4016-4020PubMed Google Scholar). Several studies suggest that ΔNp63α acts as a dominant negative with respect to p53 function, perhaps by competition for p53 DNA binding sites on downstream target genes (1Yang A. Kaghad M. Wang Y.

PI3K is activated by receptor tyrosine kinases, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and generates inositol phospholipids that act as second messengers to a variety of downstream targets (22Cantley L.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1655-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (4542) Google Scholar). The PI3K pathway is deregulated in human cancers by a number of mechanisms, all of which promote survival of cancer cells. These include amplification of PI3K catalytic subunits, inactivation of the negative regulator PTEN, or overexpression of downstream targets such as Akt (21Vivanco I. Sawyers C.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 489-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (5049) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the PI3K pathway is a key regulator of differentiation in a number of cell types, including keratinocytes (23Sayama K. Yamasaki K. Hanakawa Y. Shirakata Y. Tokumaru S. Ijuin T.

We have previously reported that inhibition of EGFR signaling in head and neck cancer cells results in a decrease in ΔNp63α expression (24Matheny K.E. Barbieri C.E. Sniezek J.C. Arteaga C.L. Pietenpol J.A. Laryngoscope. 2003; 113: 936-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that in primary and immortalized keratinocytes ΔNp63α is a target of the PI3K pathway downstream of the EGFR. Treatment of keratinocytes with EGF results in an increase in ΔNp63α expression, which is abrogated by inhibition of PI3K, but not MAPK signaling pathways. Furthermore, both decreased expression of the p110β catalytic subunit of PI3K by siRNA, and pharmacologic inhibition of PI3K result in a similar decrease in ΔNp63α expression. Regulation of ΔNp63α expression by the PI3K pathway may play a critical role in the survival and differentiation of squamous epithelia. Cell Culture and Treatment—Second-passage primary human foreskin epidermal keratinocytes (HEKs) were obtained from the Vanderbilt Skin Disease Research Core. HEKs were isolated as previously described (25Flatt P.M. Price J.O. Shaw A. Pietenpol J.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 535-543PubMed Google Scholar) and were cultured in EpiLife M-EPI-500 keratinocyte growth medium (Cascade Biologics, Portland, OR) supplemented with human keratinocyte growth supplement S-001-5 (Cascade Biologics) and 0.06 mm CaCl2. The human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT was generously provided by P. Boukamp (German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany). HaCaT cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. All cells were cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2. For EGF treatment experiments, HaCaT cells were cultured in unsupplemented Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 24 h and treated with 2 nm mouse epidermal growth factor (Invitrogen) for the indicated times. PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (Calbiochem) and MEK (mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase) inhibitor PD98059 (Calbiochem) were used at 40 and 50 μm final concentrations, respectively. Cell Transfection and siRNA—The following targeting sequences were used for siRNA-mediated knockdown of p110β: p110β-1 (5′-aagcaagttcacaattaccca-3′) and p110β-2 (5′-aacatatccaccagagcatga-3′). An H1 promoter-containing siRNA expression vector (pBS-H1) was generated as previously described (26Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3928) Google Scholar) and generously provided by Dr. Brian Law (Vanderbilt University Medical Center). Targeting oligonucleotides for p110β were designed as previously described (26Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3928) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were phosphorylated by kinase treatment, and complementary oligos were annealed together and subcloned into the BglII and HindIII sites of pBS-H1. pCEP-H1 φ, pCEP-H1 p110β-1, and pCEP-H1 p110β-2 expression vectors were generated by subcloning the BamHI/HindIII fragments of pBS-H1 φ, pBS-H1 p110β-1, and pBS-H1 p110β-2 (containing the H1 promoter and targeting sequences) into pCEP4 (Invitrogen). HaCaT cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Cells were selected with hygromycin B 48 h after transfection and harvested for Western analysis as described below. Flow Cytometry—Cells were trypsinized, and 1 × 106 cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. The remaining cells were processed for protein analysis (see below). Cells were incubated with 50 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma), and DNA content was measured using a FACSCaliber (BD Biosciences). Data were analyzed using Cell Quest software (BD Biosciences); 15,000 events were analyzed for each sample. Protein Lysate Preparation and Western Analysis—Trypsinized cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in kinase lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% Triton X-100, 4 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing the phosphatase inhibitors 50 mm NaF, 0.2 mm sodium vanadate, 10 mmp-nitrophenyl phosphate, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, and the protease inhibitors antipain (10 μg/ml), leupeptin (10 μg/ml), pepstatin A (10 μg/ml), chymostatin (10 μg/ml; Sigma), and 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride (200 μg/ml; Calbiochem). Cells were incubated on ice 45 min, and the protein supernatant was clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad protein quantification kit. Western analysis was performed as previously described (25Flatt P.M. Price J.O. Shaw A. Pietenpol J.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 535-543PubMed Google Scholar) with the following primary antibodies: α-p63 monoclonal antibody Ab-1 (Oncogene Research Products, Calbiochem), α-β-actin polyclonal antibody I-19 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), α-ACTIVE® MAPK polyclonal antibody (Promega, Madison, WI), α-ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) 1/2 polyclonal antibody (Promega), α-phospho-Akt (Ser-473) polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), α-Akt polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling), α-p110β polyclonal antibody S-19 (Santa Cruz), and α-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling). Uniformity of protein loading was assessed by β-actin analyses as well as by fast green staining of the membranes. A Fluor-S Max MultiImager (Bio-Rad) was used to quantify Western signals. Northern Analysis—Cells were harvested for mRNA isolation as previously described (27Flatt P.M. Tang L.J. Scatena C.D. Szak S.T. Pietenpol J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4210-4223Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). mRNA (1-3 μg) was lyophilized, resuspended in sample buffer (1× MOPS; 0.1 m MOPS (pH 7.0), 40 mm sodium acetate, 5 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 50% formamide, 6.5% formaldehyde) and heated at 55 °C for 15 min. A 10× loading buffer (50% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25% bromphenol blue, 0.25% xylene cyanol, 0.3 mg of ethidium bromide/ml) was added to the sample at a 1× concentration, and mRNA was resolved by gel electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel containing 2% formaldehyde and 1× MOPS. The gel was washed 2 times for 40 min each time in 10× SSC buffer (1× SSC is 0.15 m NaCl plus 0.015 m sodium citrate) buffer, and mRNA was transferred to a supported nitrocellulose membrane (Invitrogen). ΔNp63, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and cyclophilin cDNAs were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by using Prime-It II (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). After a 2-h prehybridization in Express Hyb (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA), membranes were incubated for 1 h with 106 cpm of labeled cDNA/ml in Express Hyb. Membranes were washed 2 times for 1 min each time at room temperature in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS followed by 1 h in 0.3× SSC, 0.1% SDS. Blots were subsequently exposed for autoradiography. Treatment of Keratinocytes with EGF Increases Expression of ΔNp63α—We have previously reported that inhibition of EGFR signaling decreases expression of ΔNp63α (24Matheny K.E. Barbieri C.E. Sniezek J.C. Arteaga C.L. Pietenpol J.A. Laryngoscope. 2003; 113: 936-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To determine whether activation of the EGFR and its downstream signaling pathways would likewise increase expression of ΔNp63α, we treated the immortalized human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT with EGF. HaCaT cells were cultured without serum for 24 h. Cells were then treated with 2 nm EGF in serum-free media or left untreated for the indicated times. Growth factor deprivation resulted in a G1 phase arrest with less than 5% of cells in S phase (Fig. 1A); treatment with EGF resulted in re-entry of cells into the cell cycle 12-18 h after treatment, with 30 and 37% of cells in S phase at 18 and 24 h, respectively (Fig. 1A). Western analysis showed an early increase in phosphorylated, active MAPK (Fig. 1B) after 5 min of EGF treatment, confirming activation of downstream signaling pathways. ΔNp63α protein expression increased 6 h after EGF treatment (Fig. 1B) and preceded entry of the cells into S phase. Quantification of ΔNp63α protein levels established that ΔNp63α increased 2-3-fold by 24 h after EGF treatment (Fig. 1, C and D). Northern analysis of p63 mRNA levels demonstrated that the increase in ΔNp63α expression after EGF treatment occurred at the mRNA level (Fig. 1, E and F). Inhibition of PI3K, but Not MAPK, Abrogates EGF-induced Increases in ΔNp63α Expression—The PI3K and MAPK pathways are two of the most well characterized downstream effectors of EGFR signaling (28Yarden Y. Sliwkowski M.X. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (5477) Google Scholar). To determine whether either of these signaling pathways is involved in EGFR regulation of ΔNp63α, we cultured HaCaT cells for 24 h in the absence of serum, then treated the cells with EGF alone or in combination with PD98059, an inhibitor of MAPK signaling, or LY294002, an inhibitor of PI3K. Cells were treated with Me2SO, PD98059 (50 μm), or LY294002 (40 μm) 30 min before treatment with EGF. Treatment with PD98059 eliminated EGF-induced MAPK activation (Fig. 2A) and significantly decreased EGF-induced cell proliferation (Fig. 2B) but did not affect Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 2C). Inhibition of PI3K by LY294002 inhibited EGF-induced cell proliferation (Fig. 2B), and EGF-induced Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 2C) but had no effect on MAPK activation (Fig. 2A). Inhibition of PI3K eliminated EGF-induced increases in ΔNp63α expression at both the protein (Fig. 2A) and transcript levels (Fig. 2, D and E). However, inhibition of MAPK signaling by PD98059 had no effect on EGF-induced changes in p63 protein levels (Fig. 2A). These results suggest that the PI3K pathway is required for EGF-induced increases in ΔNp63α expression under the conditions assayed. siRNA-mediated Knockdown of p110β Decreases ΔNp63α Expression—To confirm that the PI3K pathway is required for regulation of ΔNp63α expression, we utilized siRNAs to disrupt the expression of one of the catalytic subunits of PI3K, p110β. This approach has previously been shown to decrease activation of downstream targets of the PI3K pathway (29Czauderna F. Fechtner M. Aygun H. Arnold W. Klippel A. Giese K. Kaufmann J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 670-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). HaCaT cells were transfected with a hygromycin-selectable mammalian expression vector (pCEP-H1) encoding p110β-targeting siRNAs under the control of the H1 promoter (26Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3928) Google Scholar). Cells were selected for 7 days with hygromycin, and p110β and p63 protein levels were analyzed. Expression of two separate targeting sequences (p110β-1 and p110β-2) resulted in decreased expression of p110β that was accompanied by a significant decrease in ΔNp63α expression (Fig. 3). Despite previous reports that siRNA-mediated knockdown of p110β reduced Akt activation (29Czauderna F. Fechtner M. Aygun H. Arnold W. Klippel A. Giese K. Kaufmann J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 670-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), no effect was seen on phospho-Akt levels (data not shown). This is not surprising since Akt is a key regulator of cell survival and proliferation (21Vivanco I. Sawyers C.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 489-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (5049) Google Scholar), and long term de-activation of Akt would be extremely detrimental to cells. We suspect that compensatory mechanisms (such as one of the other isoforms of p110) maintained Akt phosphorylation during the selection process in this experiment. These results confirm that specific disruption of PI3K signaling leads to a reduction in ΔNp63α expression. ΔNp63α Expression Is Regulated by PI3K in Primary Keratinocytes—To confirm that ΔNp63α was regulated by the PI3K pathway in cells with minimal genetic and epigenetic alterations, we utilized primary HEKs as a model system. HEKs were cultured for 24 h in basal media without growth factor supplements, then treated with 40 μm LY294002 for the indicated times. Treatment with LY294002 resulted in a 70% decrease in ΔNp63α expression over a 24-h period (Fig. 4, A and B). It has been reported that down-regulation of ΔNp63α in epidermal keratinocytes is required for apoptosis (20Liefer K.M. Koster M.I. Wang X.J. Yang A. McKeon F. Roop D.R. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4016-4020PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we investigated if down-regulation of ΔNp63α expression by inhibition of PI3K was associated with induction of apoptosis in HEKs. The timing and amount of ΔNp63α down-regulation was accompanied by apoptosis in these cells as determined by the percentage of sub-diploid cells by flow cytometry (Fig. 4C, top) and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage (Fig. 4C, bottom). These effects were only observed in the absence of growth factors. In the presence of growth factors, the decrease in ΔNp63α expression and induction of apoptosis was minimal (data not shown). This implies that other signaling pathways are involved in maintenance of ΔNp63α expression, but in conditions of cell stress (such as growth factor deprivation), ΔNp63α expression is dependent on PI3K. These results demonstrate that ΔNp63α is regulated by the PI3K pathway in HEKs, and reduction in ΔNp63α expression is accompanied by induction of apoptosis in these cells. ΔNp63α is a homologue of the tumor suppressor p53, which acts as a dominant negative with respect to p53 function and has an anti-apoptotic function in keratinocytes (1Yang A. Kaghad M. Wang Y. Gillet E. Fleming M. Dotsch V. Andrews N. Caput D. McKeon F. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 305-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1821) Google Scholar, 4Westfall M.D. Mays D.J. Sniezek J.C. Pietenpol J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2264-2276Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 20Liefer K.M. Koster M.I. Wang X.J. Yang A. McKeon F. Roop D.R. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4016-4020PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we report that ΔNp63α expression is regulated by the PI3K pathway, a well characterized regulator of survival in a wide variety of cell types (21Vivanco I. Sawyers C.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 489-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (5049) Google Scholar). We show that treatment of immortalized keratinocytes with EGF results in activation of both the MAPK and PI3K pathways and an increase in ΔNp63α mRNA levels. The simplest explanation for the increase in ΔNp63α expression is a change in p63 gene transcription; however, effects on message stability and post-transcriptional processing are also possibilities. Furthermore, we cannot rule out additional effects on protein stability or translational control. Pharmacologic inhibition of PI3K but not MAPK signaling abrogates this increase in ΔNp63α expression. We have confirmed that this effect is specific for the PI3K pathway by disrupting PI3K signaling using siRNAs directed against a catalytic subunit of PI3K, p110β, in immortalized keratinocytes. Finally, we have shown that ΔNp63α is regulated by PI3K signaling in primary human keratinocytes and that decreased ΔNp63α expression resulting from PI3K inhibition is accompanied by an induction of apoptosis in these cells. The PI3K pathway is an important regulator of survival in a number of cell types, including keratinocytes. PI3K affects cell survival through a number of intermediates, the most extensively studied of which is Akt (PKB) (21Vivanco I. Sawyers C.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 489-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (5049) Google Scholar). Akt is a serine/threonine kinase that is activated by PI3K and inhibits cell death by directly phosphorylating several components of the apoptotic machinery (21Vivanco I. Sawyers C.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 489-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (5049) Google Scholar). Although Akt is the most well characterized effector of PI3K-mediated survival, other downstream targets are also implicated, including cytokine-independent survival kinase, protein kinase Cζ, and integrin-linked kinase (22Cantley L.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1655-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (4542) Google Scholar, 30Wu C. Dedhar S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). ΔNp63α is implicated in the survival and maintenance of epithelial cells. In both mice and zebrafish, p63 is required for the maintenance of progenitor cells necessary for epidermal morphogenesis (12Yang A. Schweitzer R. Sun D. Kaghad M. Walker N. Bronson R. Tabin C. Sharpe A. Caput D. Crum C. McKeon F. Nature. 1999; 398: 714-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (1877) Google Scholar, 13Mills A.A. Zheng B.H. Wang X.J. Vogel H. Roop D.R. Bradley A.

Cell. 2002; 2: 617-627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Furthermore, several studies show that ΔNp63α can act as a dominant negative with respect to p53 function and can potentially repress p53 target genes (1Yang A. Kaghad M. Wang Y. Gillet E. Fleming M. Dotsch V. Andrews N. Caput D. McKeon F. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 305-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1821) Google Scholar, 4Westfall M.D. Mays D.J. Sniezek J.C. Pietenpol J.A. Mol.

Biol. 2002; 22: 8659-8668Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In addition, ΔNp63α is down-regulated in response to UV-B irradiation, and targeted expression of ΔNp63α in murine skin inhibits UV-B induced apoptosis (20Liefer K.M. Koster M.I. Wang X.J. Yang A. McKeon F. Roop D.R. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4016-4020PubMed Google Scholar). We observed that reduction in ΔNp63α expression by inhibition of PI3K correlates with induction of apoptosis in primary epidermal keratinocytes; however, it is uncertain whether this represents an anti-apoptotic role for ΔNp63α or if ΔNp63α is simply a marker for the viability or proliferative capacity of cells. The precise role of ΔNp63α in cellular survival and apoptosis is still unclear, but the discovery that ΔNp63α is regulated by the PI3K pathway further implicates it in these processes. Because of its potent anti-apoptotic effects, the PI3K pathway is often altered in human cancers (21Vivanco I. Sawyers C.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 489-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (5049) Google Scholar). The deregulation of this pathway can occur at many levels. These include amplification of PI3K catalytic subunits (33Shayesteh L. Lu Y. Kuo W.L. Baldocchi R. Godfrey T. Collins C. Pinkel D. Powell B. Mills G.B. Gray J.W. Nat.

Cancer Inst. 1999; 91: 1922-1932Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), or overexpression of downstream targets such a Akt (36Bellacosa A. de Feo D. Godwin A.K. Bell D.W. Cheng J.Q.

ΔNp63α is overexpressed in several epithelial cancers, including carcinomas of the head and neck, lung, esophagus, bladder, and cervix (16Hibi K. Trink B. Patturajan M. Westra W.H. Caballero O.L.

Pathol. 2001; 32: 479-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). This overexpression can sometimes be the result of amplification of the p63 genomic locus (16Hibi K. Trink B. Patturajan M. Westra W.H. Caballero O.L. Hill D.E. Ratovitski E.A. Jen J. Sidransky D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5462-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). In fact, p110α, one of the catalytic subunits of PI3K, and p63 are both overexpressed in squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (16Hibi K. Trink B. Patturajan M. Westra W.H. Caballero O.L.

Further supporting the view that p63 may act as an oncogene, overexpression of a ΔNp63 isoform in Rat-1A cells increases colony growth in soft agar and xenograft tumor formation in nude mice (16Hibi K. Trink B. Patturajan M. Westra W.H. Caballero O.L. Hill D.E. Ratovitski E.A. Jen J. Sidransky D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5462-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). These studies highlight similarities between the PI3K pathway and p63 in human cancers. It is well established that ΔNp63α expression decreases during the differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes in vitro and in vivo (4Westfall M.D. Mays D.J. Sniezek J.C. Pietenpol J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2264-2276Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 9Pellegrini G. Dellambra E. Golisano O. Martinelli E. Fantozzi I. Bondanza S. Ponzin D. McKeon F. De Luca M. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Dermatol. 2002; 118: 133-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). One study suggests that ectopic expression of ΔNp63α is sufficient to block keratinocyte differentiation (42King K.E. Ponnamperuma R.M. Yamashita T. Tokino T. Lee L.A. Young M.F. Weinberg W.C. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 3635-3644Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), but the functional role of ΔNp63α in this biological process remains unclear (20Liefer K.M. Koster M.I. Wang X.J. Yang A. McKeon F. Roop D.R. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4016-4020PubMed Google Scholar, 41Bamberger C. Pollet D. Schmale H. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2002; 118: 133-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The PI3K pathway is also implicated in the differentiation of a wide variety of cell types (43Okkenhaug K. Vanhaesebroeck B. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar, 44Vojtek A.B. Taylor J. DeRuiter S.L. Yu J.Y. Figueroa C. Kwok R.P. Turner D.L. Mol. Cell.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 218-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 46Wang Q. Wang X. Hernandez A. Kim S. Evers B.M. Gastroenterology. 2001; 120: 1381-1392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In epidermal keratinocytes, blockade of PI3K results in differentiation, and activation of PI3K prevents differentiation (23Sayama K. Yamasaki K. Hanakawa Y. Shirakata Y. Tokumaru S. Ijuin T. Takenawa T. Hashimoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40390-40396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In this study we report that blockade of PI3K results in decreased expression of ΔNp63α (which occurs during differentiation) and that activation of PI3K results in increased expression of ΔNp63α (which has been reported to block differentiation). These observations suggest that the regulation of ΔNp63α expression by PI3K signaling may play a role in the differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes, but further investigation is necessary to establish this connection. A wide variety of upstream stimuli activate the PI3K pathway, leading to the potential for a large number of extracellular signals to affect ΔNp63α expression. PI3K is activated by a diverse collection of growth factors, including EGF, insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1, and neurotrophins (28Yarden Y. Sliwkowski M.X. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (5477) Google Scholar, 47Patapoutian A. Reichardt L.F. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 272-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar, 48Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E.

We found that in primary keratinocytes the presence of growth factors limits the reduction in ΔNp63α by PI3K inhibition. This implies that other signaling pathways are involved in maintenance of ΔNp63α expression, but in conditions of cell stress (such as growth factor deprivation) ΔNp63α expression is heavily dependent on PI3K. This is not surprising, since the PI3K pathway is important for the survival of cells in response to stresses. Another key upstream activator of the PI3K pathway is adhesion molecule signaling. Integrins and other mediators of cell-matrix interaction activate PI3K through focal adhesion kinase, Ras, and other intermediates (50Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3757) Google Scholar), and disruption of integrin-extracellular matrix contact eliminates PI3K activity (51King W.G. Mattaliano M.D. Chan T.O. Tsichlis P.N. Brugge J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4406-4418Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 52Khwaja A. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Wennstrom S. Warne P.H. Downward J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2783-2793Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). This regulation of PI3K by integrin signaling has particular implications for ΔNp63α expression. ΔNp63α expression in the epidermis is limited to the basal layer of keratinocytes, which maintain contact with the basement membrane (12Yang A. Schweitzer R. Sun D. Kaghad M. Walker N. Bronson R. Tabin C. Sharpe A. Caput D. Crum C. McKeon F. Nature. 1999; 398: 714-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (1877) Google Scholar, 13Mills A.A. Zheng B.H. Wang X.J. Vogel H. Roop D.R. Bradley A. Nature. 1999; 398: 708-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (1674) Google Scholar); certain integrin signaling pathways are highly active in these cells (32Kaur P. Li A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2000; 114: 413-420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 53Nguyen B.P. Gil S.G. Carter W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31896-31907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Integrin-mediated activation of the PI3K pathway, therefore, may be partly responsible for the observed distribution of ΔNp63α expression in the epidermis. The large number of upstream signals that can activate PI3K suggest that although we used EGF to interrogate the PI3K pathway in vitro, many different factors may coordinately regulate ΔNp63α expression through PI3K in vivo. In summary, we show that ΔNp63α is regulated by the PI3K pathway in primary and immortalized squamous epithelial cells. This discovery provides a framework for investigation of how biological processes such as growth factor and adhesion molecule signaling can affect expression of ΔNp63α.

https://openalex.org/W2041459355,"Cardiolipin (CL) is an inner mitochondrial membrane phospholipid that contributes to optimal mitochondrial function and is gaining widespread attention in studies of mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Divergent hypotheses describing the role of CL in cytochrome c release and apoptosis have evolved. We addressed this controversy directly by comparing the spontaneous- and Bax-mediated cytochrome c release from mitochondria isolated from two strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae: one lacking CL-synthase and therefore CL (ΔCRD1) and the other, its corresponding wild type (WT). We demonstrated by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry that the main yeast CL species [(16:1)2(18:1)2] differs in fatty acid composition from mammalian CL [(18:2)4], and we verified the absence of the yeast CL species in the ΔCRD1 strain. We also demonstrated that the mitochondrial association of Bax and the resulting cytochrome c release is not dependent on the CL content of the yeast mitochondrial membranes. Bax inserted equally into both WT and ΔCRD1 mitochondrial membranes under conditions that lead to the release of cytochrome c from both strains of yeast mitochondria. Furthermore, using models of synthetic liposomes and isolated yeast mitochondria, we found that cytochrome c was bound more “loosely” to the CL-deficient systems compared with when CL is present. These data challenge recent studies implicating that CL is required for Bax-mediated pore formation leading to the release of proteins from the mitochondrial intermembrane space. In contrast, they support our recently proposed two-step mechanism of cytochrome c release, which suggests that CL is required for binding cytochrome c to the inner mitochondrial membrane.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4261-4266Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Due to its intracellular distribution, CL has been postulated, and more recently demonstrated, to be an essential component in many mitochondrial processes such as electron transport, ADP/ATP translocation, ion permeability, membrane integrity, and protein function and transport (1.Schlame M. Rua D. Greenberg M.L. Prog. Lipid Res. 2000; 39: 257-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 3.Zhang M. Mileykovskaya E. Dowhan W. J. Biol.

A phospholipid/protein interaction that is of recent interest in apoptosis research is that of CL and cytochrome c. Cytochrome c is a water-soluble basic protein that is bound to the mitochondrial inner membrane by its association with CL, where it can reversibly interact with complexes III and IV of the respiratory chain. The molecular interaction between CL and cytochrome c has been extensively studied using multiple biochemical and analytical approaches. It is well established that cytochrome c specifically and stoichiometrically binds to CL (5.Tuominen E.K.J. Wallace C.J.A. Kinnunen P.K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8822-8826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), thus anchoring the protein to the inner mitochondrial membrane to participate in electron transport thereby ensuring a limited soluble pool of the protein. The interaction of cytochrome c with CL involves electrostatic interactions at the A-site of cytochrome c, whereas hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding take place at its C-site (5.Tuominen E.K.J. Wallace C.J.A. Kinnunen P.K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8822-8826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In other words, one of the acyl chains of CL is inserted into a hydrophobic channel in cytochrome c, whereas another acyl chain extends into the bilayer. When extruded from the mitochondria into the cytosol during the early phase of apoptosis, cytochrome c plays an essential role in the formation of the apoptosome, which leads to the activation of caspases and apoptotic cell death (6.Ostrander D.B.

Two main hypotheses regarding the role of CL in the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondrial intermembrane space have been brought forward. Data from our laboratory and others suggest that CL is required for the binding of cytochrome c to the inner mitochondrial membrane and thereby for the maintenance of cytochrome c within the mitochondria. It has been demonstrated that changes in the levels (6.Ostrander D.B. Sparagna G.C. Amoscato A.A. McMillin J.B. Dowhan W. J. Biol.

A seemingly contradictory view that has surfaced recently is the hypothesis that CL is required for the release of cytochrome c and other mitochondrial proteins. This is supported by a recent study showing that CL is required for Bax-mediated pore formation in liposomes (21.Kuwana T. Mackey M.R. Perkins G. Ellisman M.H. Latterich M. Schneiter R. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Cell. 2002; 111: 331-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar). Specifically, the authors used a stepwise reductionist approach, ultimately relying on the use of reconstituted membrane and/or synthetic liposomes encapsulating fluorescently labeled dextran molecules, to demonstrate that Bax-mediated dextran release required the presence of CL in the liposome (21.Kuwana T. Mackey M.R. Perkins G. Ellisman M.H. Latterich M. Schneiter R. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Cell. 2002; 111: 331-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar). In the present study, we addressed this controversy directly by comparing the spontaneous- and Bax-mediated cytochrome c release from mitochondria isolated from two strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae: one lacking CL-synthase and therefore CL (ΔCRD1) and the other, its corresponding wild type (WT). We found essentially that cytochrome c was bound more “loosely” to the ΔCRD1 inner mitochondrial membrane compared with the WT control. Furthermore, we showed that Bax-mediated cytochrome c release is not dependent on the CL content of the yeast mitochondrial membranes in that Bax mediated the release of cytochrome c both from WT and ΔCRD1 mitochondria. Yeast Strains and Growth—Standard methods were used for the culture of the homozygous diploid deletion strain Δcrd1 and the isogenic wild type strain BY4743 (22.Giaever G. Nature. 2002; 418: 387-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (3267) Google Scholar). Yeast were grown aerobically at 28 °C to mid-logarithmic phase in medium containing a non-fermentable carbon source (2% lactic acid) and 3% Bacto™ yeast extract, 0.1% glucose, 7.3 mm KH2PO4, 18.7 mm NH4Cl, 3.4 mm CaCl2, 8.6 mm NaCl, 4.8 mm MgSO4, 0.0003% FeCL3, pH 5.5 (adjusted with KOH). Yeast cells were harvested for mitochondrial isolation when A540 was between 1 and 2 absorbance units at full scale. Isolation of Yeast Mitochondria—Yeast spheroplasts were generated from zymolyase-treated cells as described previously (23.Daum G. Bohni P.C. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13028-13033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using 4 mg of zymolyase/g of cells. The extent of spheroplast formation was monitored at λ = 540 nm, and the reaction was terminated when a 1:100 water-diluted mixture reached an A540 of 10–20% of the control value. Isolation of mitochondria was performed essentially as described previously with minor modifications (24.Yaffe M.P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 627-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The entire isolation procedure was done at 4 °C. Briefly, yeast were spun at 500 × g for 5 min then resuspended in cold isolation buffer (0.6 m sorbitol, 20 mm Hepes, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4). Cells were homogenized with a Potter homogenizer (motor-driven), and intact cells were sedimented at 500 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was transferred to a Sorval tube (40 ml) while the pellet underwent a second homogenization. Supernatants from both centrifugations were combined and subjected to 10,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was discarded while the pellet was resuspended in cold sucrose buffer (20 mm Hepes, 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose, pH 7.4). Aggregates were sedimented by a 500 × g spin, and the resulting supernatant was further subjected to 10,000 × g for 10 min. The final mitochondrial pellet was suspended in cold sucrose buffer at a final concentration of ∼10 mg of protein/ml. Protein quantification was carried out using the BCA protein kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Isolation of Yeast Mitochondrial Phospholipids—Phospholipids were isolated by organic extraction into chloroform/methanol. For every 1 mg of mitochondrial protein, 1 ml of methanol was added and the mixture was sonicated for 15 min. An internal standard (IS) of 10 μg/mg of protein of tetramyristoyl (14:0)4 cardiolipin (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) was used for LC-MS analyses of the yeast strains and was added during the extraction. Subsequently, 2 ml/mg of protein of chloroform was added followed by a second 15-min sonication. The mixture was stirred overnight at 4 °C then extracted with 600 μl of dH2O. The organic phase was collected and evaporated under a stream of N2(g). The phospholipids were subject to either further isolation by TLC or analyzed directly by LC-MS. Isolation of Individual Phospholipids by TLC—Isolated total phospholipids were reconstituted in 20 μl of chloroform and loaded onto silica gel TLC plates (10 × 10 cm). The plates were developed in 53:25:6:3 (by vol.) of chloroform/methanol/water/glacial acetic acid in the first dimension followed by 50:10:5:10:20 (by vol.) of chloroform/methanol/water/acetic acid/acetone in the second dimension. The TLC plates were dried and exposed to iodine vapor to visualize the double-bond-containing phospholipids, which were labeled with a pencil. Individual spots were scraped from the glass, and the silica was transferred to a polypropylene microcentrifuge tube (1.5 ml). The phospholipids were eluted with 2 × 250 μl of the first dimension mobile phase and separated from the silica after each wash by a 5-min, 10,000 × g spin. The supernatant was combined and dried under a stream of N2(g). A mixture of phospholipid standards (Sigma) was isolated in the same way, and individual spots were compared with the isolated yeast phospholipid species by LC-MS analysis. LC-MS Identification and Characterization of Yeast Phospholipids— Electrospray MS was performed in negative ion mode with a Micromass Quattro micro™ mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, U.K.). The source temperature was set to 120 °C with a nebulizing gas flow of 160 liters/h and a cone voltage of 35 V. Data were collected between 600 and 850 (to detect PLs and double negative charged CL species) and/or 1380–1480 m/z (to detect single negative charged CL species) with a sweep time of 2 s. Collisional-induced fragmentation of yeast phospholipid species and standards (LC-MS-MS) was effected using argon gas at 4.0 × 103 mbar. Total ion current (TIC) and extracted mass chromatograms showing individual molecular species were generated using MassLynx software and were mean-smoothed. The LC portion of the method was carried out using an adaptation of the high-performance liquid chromatography method developed by Spickett et al. (25.Spickett C.M. Rennie N. Winter H. Zambonin L. Landi L. Jerlich A. Schaur R.J. Pitt A.R. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 449-457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using a Waters Alliance HT 2790 system equipped with an autosampler cooled to 4 °C. The stationary phase was a Phenomenex Luna C8 (2.van Klompenburg W. Nilsson I. von Heijne G. de Kruijff B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4261-4266Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) column (5 μm, 2 × 100 mm) that was operated at 200 μl/min with a gradient mobile phase that consisted initially of 76:3.3:3.3 (by vol.) methanol/hexane/0.1 m ammonium acetate. Over 15 min, the mobile phase was changed to 71:10:2 methanol/hexane/0.15 m ammonium acetate, kept isocratic for 5 min, then returned to initial conditions over 1 min. Mitochondrial phospholipid extracts were reconstituted in 75–150 μl of 71:10:2 mobile phase, and 20-μl aliquots were injected per run. Using a 1:10 splitter, 10% of the column effluent was directed to the electrospray source of the spectrometer to give a detector flow rate of 20 μl/min, whereas the remaining effluent was diverted to waste. Preparation of Large Unilamellar Vesicles—Lyophilized dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), and bovine heart cardiolipin (CL) (Sigma) were dissolved in chloroform to achieve final concentrations of 50, 10, and 10 mg/ml, respectively. Sucrose-loaded vesicles composed of either CL and PC (15% by weight CL), PG and PC (15% by weight PG), or PC alone were prepared using published protocols (26.Buser C.A. McLaughlin S. Methods Mol. Biol. 1996; 84: 267-280Google Scholar). Vesicles of uniform size (LUVs) were ensured using a lipid extruder equipped with a 0.1-μm pore-sized polycarbonate filter (Avanti Polar Lipids) and were stored for no longer than 1 week at 4 °C. To test cytochrome c binding in two different ionic strengths of buffer, two batches of LUVs were prepared in either 48 or 256 mm sucrose with 5 mm Tris, pH 7.4, buffers. These sucrose concentrations were used because they are isoosmotic with 25 and 150 mm KCl, respectively, which are the buffers used for the cytochrome c binding studies described below. The final concentration of phospholipids in all preparations was 19 mm. Cytochrome c Binding to Sucrose-loaded LUVs—Cytochrome c (1 μg/ml final concentration) was incubated with LUVs (500 μm, final lipid concentration) at room temperature for 1 h in either 25 or 150 mm KCl buffer, each with 5 mm Tris, pH 7.4. LUVs were separated from supernatant by centrifuging at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Immediately after centrifugation, the supernatant was separated from the loose LUV pellet, and each fraction was analyzed by LC-MS to verify separation, in addition to detecting cytochrome c by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. The binding experiments were performed four separate times, each yielding similar results. The LC-MS conditions were similar to those described above, except, for speed of assay, the stronger mobile phase was used (methanol:hexane:0.1 m ammonium acetate, 72:10:2) under isocratic conditions. Therefore, CL has a shorter TR. Furthermore, the phospholipids were detected in single ion monitoring mode where only m/z 844, 747, and 723 were scanned to detect PC, PG, and CL, respectively. Verification of the Functional Activity of Isolated Mitochondria— Mitochondria (1 mg of protein/ml) were incubated in the sorbitol-based mitochondria isolation buffer described above. Incubations were done at room temperature with continuous stirring to avoid anoxia. Estimation of ΔΨM was performed using an electrode sensitive to the lipophilic cation tetraphenylphosphonium (TPP+). Energized mitochondria rapidly accumulate TPP+ from the incubation buffer and release this cation as ΔΨM decays. Oxygen consumption by isolated yeast mitochondria in isolation buffer was measured using a Clark-type oxygen electrode (Yellow Spring Instrument Co., Yellow Springs, OH) at room temperature. Fresh mitochondria were prepared for each experiment and used within 3 h. Estimation of Mitochondrial Swelling—Mitochondria (0.2 mg of protein/ml) were added to either low ionic strength modified isolation buffer (LIS, 5 mm Tris, 0.6 m sorbitol, pH 7.4) or high ionic strength KCl buffer (HIS, 5 mm Tris, 300 mm KCl, pH 7.4), each supplemented with 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm KH2PO4, 2 mm MgCl2, and 20 mm ethanol in a final volume of 1 ml. Mitochondrial volume was monitored for at least 15 min at A540. Expression, Purification, and Oligomerization of Bax—The expression and purification of full-length Bax protein were performed as described previously (27.Montessuit S. Mazzei G. Magnenat E. Antonsson B. Protein Express. Purif. 1999; 15: 202-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and a detailed description without modifications can be found in our previous report (16.Ott M. Robertson J.D. Gogvadze V. Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1259-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). Briefly, the full-length human Bax cDNA sequence was amplified by standard PCR techniques. The PCR DNA fragment was isolated by the QIAquick kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) and subcloned into the NcoI and HindIII sites of the plasmid pBAD. The plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli and transformants were isolated by selection for ampicillin resistance. Cultures of the resistant colony were grown to an A650 of ∼7. After induction, the culture was further incubated for several hours, and cells were harvested by centrifugation. The cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (100 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 1% Triton X-100, a mixture of protease inhibitors, 30 μg/ml DNase I and 50 μg/ml lysozyme) and broken by sonication. After centrifugation, Bax was recovered in the supernatant. The protein was purified by affinity chromatography on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) followed by ion-exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The protein was at least 95% pure as determined by SDS-PAGE, and it was concentrated to 0.4 mg/ml in the presence of 1% octyl glucoside, and aliquots were stored at -80 °C. SDS-PAGE analysis of the thawed aliquot used for this study revealed that ∼50% of the protein was full-length Bax, whereas the remainder was oligomeric. The used concentrations of octyl glucoside did not interfere with mitochondrial functional parameters. Bax Association and Cytochrome c Release—Isolated yeast mitochondria (1 mg/ml) were resuspended in either LIS or HIS buffers described above in the presence or absence of 800 ng of Bax in a final incubation volume of 100 μl. When testing for Bax insertion, the incubations were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatants were removed, and the pellets were resuspended in 0.2 ml of 0.1 m sodium carbonate, pH 11.5. After a 20-min incubation at 4 °C, the samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 100,000 × g, and the pellets were analyzed by Western blotting using the anti-Bax polyclonal antibody. When testing for the release of cytochrome c, mitochondria were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min. Supernatants were centrifuged once more to avoid mitochondrial contamination. The resulting supernatant and pellet were assessed for the presence of cytochrome c using Western blotting. Western Blot Analysis—Supernatants or pellets obtained from 20 μg of mitochondrial protein were boiled for 5 min in Laemmli loading buffer. Proteins were separated by 15% SDS-PAGE at 120 V followed by electroblotting to nitrocellulose membrane at 100 V for 2 h. Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in phosphate-buffered saline and probed with either a monoclonal anti-cytochrome c antibody (BD Pharmingen, 1:2500) or polyclonal anti-Bax antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:1,000). The membranes were washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Pierce, 1:10,000). After rinsing the membranes, bound antibodies were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cytochrome c band densities (n = 5) were quantitated using Quantity One software (version 4.2.3, Bio-Rad Laboratories). A two-tailed Student's t test was used to compare control from Bax-treated cytochrome c release. Identification and Characterization of Yeast CL—We initially verified the absence of CL in the ΔCRD1 mitochondria by two-dimensional TLC, as previously described (28.Jiang F. Ryan M.T. Schlame M. Zhao M. Gu Z. Klingenberg M. Pfanner N. Greenberg M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22387-22394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Silica plates were loaded with either standard, WT, or ΔCRD1 phospholipids. The WT phospholipids developed a spot with the same RF as the standard CL (derived from bovine heart), whereas this spot was absent from the developed ΔCRD1 phospholipids. We also employed a sensitive and specific LC-MS method to detect mitochondrial phospholipids. Phospholipids isolated from the WT yeast mitochondria were analyzed for the presence of CL. There were peaks with roughly the same RT as the mammalian standard, however, they did not have the same mass. In fact, extracting m/z 1447 (the negative ion mass of bovine heart CL, M - H) from the total ion current data (TIC) of the WT phospholipid analysis revealed no peaks (data not shown). Thus is was clear that, despite their similar RF values, the CL species from our strain of yeast was not the same as the mammalian standard, and so we set out to identify the fatty acid composition of the CL from WT mitochondria. Both standard and WT phospholipids were separated by TLC. The spots corresponding to standard CL and WT CL were scraped off from the TLC plates, eluted into an appropriate solvent, and analyzed by LC-MS and LC-MS-MS methods (Fig. 1, B and C). As expected, the standard and WT CL have similar chromatographic properties in that they both have TR of ∼17 min. However, in contrast to the m/z of the standard CL (1447.4, M - 1), the m/z of the major peak from the WT sample was 1399.4. Collision-induced fragmentation of the standard CL revealed four prominent peaks, each of which could easily be assigned due to loss of the 18:2 acyl-linked fatty acids (m/z 279), or fragmentation of the phosphate-glycerol bond (Fig. 1A). The same fragmentation experiment was performed on the corresponding sample from the WT yeast (parent ion m/z 1399.4), and an analogous fragmentation pattern emerged. The fragments of m/z 253 and 281 correspond to the loss of acyl-linked fatty acids with the carbon:unsaturation index of 16:1 and 18:1, respectively. There were two more peaks in the TIC of the WT sample, but fragmentation data were not obtained, likely due to their lower amounts. However, the latest eluting peak (20 min) had an m/z of 1427, which could correspond to a CL species with a fatty acid composition of (16:1)1(18:1)3. Therefore the MS-MS experiments unambiguously show that the major fatty acid compositions of bovine heart and WT yeast CL are (18:2)4 and (16:1)2(18:1)2, respectively. After identifying the masses of the major yeast CL species, we confirmed their absence in the ΔCRD1 mutants by the more sensitive and specific LC-MS method (Fig. 2, A and C). The low m/z range was used to analyze the phospholipid mixtures from each strain of yeast, and the similar intensities of the IS peaks demonstrated that there was similar recovery of the phospholipids from the extraction procedure (Fig. 2A). The masses corresponding to the major CL species with z = 2 were extracted from each chromatogram in Fig. 2A, and the results are shown in Fig. 2C. Although the WT yeast mitochondria contain these major CL species, there is a complete absence in the ΔCRD1 mitochondria. The peak at ∼5 min that is present in both types of mitochondria is most likely a phospholipid with z = 1 that shares the same m/z as one of the CL species. A similar mass extraction of m/z values corresponding to different yeast PG species was done (Fig. 2B). When compared with the peak area of the IS, the ΔCRD1 yeast had over 800-fold more PG than WT mitochondria. The virtually absent level of PG in WT mitochondria is consistent with PG being a biosynthetic precursor to CL (1.Schlame M. Rua D. Greenberg M.L. Prog. Lipid Res. 2000; 39: 257-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). Whereas in CL-synthase-lacking ΔCRD1 mitochondria, there appeared to be a build-up of PG. Furthermore, to ensure that our preparations of mitochondria yielded viable, respiring species, we verified that growth on a non-fermentable carbon source and ambient temperatures, ΔCRD1 mitochondria respire and maintain their membrane potential (ΔΨM) in a manner comparable to their WT counterparts (Fig. 3). Addition of ADP to mitochondria resulted in a temporary decrease of the ΔΨM followed by its restoration when phosphorylation of added ADP was complete. There was no difference in phosphorylation time between ΔCRD1 and WT mitochondria (Fig. 3A). Measurements of mitochondrial respiration using an oxygen electrode also yielded similar results in both strains of mitochondria (Fig. 3B). Hence, the absence of cardiolipin does not dramatically affect the functiona"
https://openalex.org/W2049224188,"Methylmalonic aciduria is a human autosomal recessive disorder of organic acid metabolism resulting from a functional defect in the activity of the enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA mutase. Based upon the homology of the human mutase locus with the mouse locus, we have chosen to disrupt the mouse mutase locus within the critical CoA binding domain using gene-targeting techniques to create a mouse model of methylmalonic aciduria. The phenotype of homozygous knock-out mice (mut-/-) is one of early neonatal lethality. Mice appear phenotypically normal at birth and are indistinguishable from littermates. By 15 h of age, they develop reduced movement and suckle less. This is followed by the development of abnormal breathing, and all of the mice with a null phenotype die by 24 h of age. Urinary levels of methylmalonic and methylcitric acids are grossly increased. Measurement of acylcarnitines in blood shows elevation of propionylcarnitine with no change in the levels of acetylcarnitine and free carnitine. Incorporation of [14C]propionate in primary fibroblast cultures from mut-/- mice is reduced to approximately 6% of normal level, whereas there is no detectable synthesis of mut mRNA in the liver.

This is the first mouse model that recapitulates the key phenotypic features of mut0 methylmalonic aciduria. Methylmalonic aciduria (MMA, 1The abbreviations used are: MMAmethylmalonic aciduriaMCMmethylmalonyl-CoA mutaseMMmethylmalonateESembryonic stemRTreverse transcriptasePApropionic acidemia. MIM 251000) is an autosomal recessive inborn error of organic acid metabolism. The true incidence of the disorder has been difficult to determine, and variable figures have been reported. A recent review of newborn screening data indicates an incidence of isolated MMA (mutase and cobalamin A/B) in the order of 1 in 140,000 in Australia (1Wilcken B. Wiley V. Hammond J. Carpenter K. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 348: 2304-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). The condition results from a functional defect in the enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MCM, EC 5.4.99.2) either due to a defect in the mutase (mut) gene itself (designated muto or mut-) or from a defect in the metabolism of the cofactor adenosylcobalamine. MCM is a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of l-methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA, which then enters the citric acid cycle. l-Methylmalonyl-CoA is predominantly derived from the catabolism of branched chain amino acids in the diet, odd chain fatty acids via propionyl-CoA, and propionate synthesized from gut flora. methylmalonic aciduria methylmalonyl-CoA mutase methylmalonate embryonic stem reverse transcriptase propionic acidemia. Following normal pregnancy and delivery-affected individuals with the mut0 form typically present in the newborn period with overwhelming illness consisting of acidosis, vomiting, poor feeding, hypotonia, and lethargy. Untreated, there is progression to coma and death. The mut0 form may have a less severe phenotype. Aggressive supportive therapy results in survival. However, any intercurrent illness or “metabolic stress” may lead to metabolic instability characterized by repeat recurrent life-threatening episodes of metabolic decompensation. Currently, the mainstay of treatment for MMA is strict dietary restriction and drug manipulation. The aim of such treatment is to control methylmalonate (MM) and propionate production by limiting dietary intake of precursors and endogenous production of substrate by catabolism. Despite such treatment, morbidity and mortality remain high (2Matsui S.M. Mahoney M.J. Rosenberg L.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 1983; 308: 857-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). There are many long term complications such as poor appetite and growth, pancreatitis, cardiomyopathy, and metabolic stroke resulting in permanent neurological damage. Individuals that survive infancy develop renal failure later in childhood and adolescence (3Walter J.H. Michalski A. Wilson W.M. Leonard J.V. Barratt T.M. Dillon M.J. Eur. J. Pediatr. 1989; 148: 344-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The underlying pathophysiology leading to these complications is poorly understood. Liver and combined liver/kidney transplantations have been attempted with the aim of replacing the deficient enzyme activity, thus preventing the need for diet and avoiding the long term complications. The outcome of such treatment has been successful in allowing patients to relax the dietary restrictions and preventing acute metabolic decompensations (4Leonard J.V. Walter J.H. McKiernan P.J. J. Inher. Metab. Dis. 2001; 24: 309-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, the natural history of the renal failure and propensity to metabolic stroke remain unclear at this stage (5Chakrapani A. Sivakumar P. McKiernan P.J. Leonard J.V. J. Pediatr. 2002; 140: 261-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Furthermore, liver transplantation is restricted because of the risks associated with it as well as the limitation of suitable donors. A better understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease is therefore needed to enable the development of an effective therapy for this disorder. However, progress has been limited by the lack of animal models for this disorder. The human mutase gene is ubiquitously expressed and encodes for a 750 amino acid precursor protein including a 32 amino acid mitochondrial leader sequence (6Ledley F.D. Lumetta M.R. Zoghbi H.Y. VanTuinen P. Ledbetter S.A. Ledbetter D.H. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1988; 42: 839-846PubMed Google Scholar, 7Nham S.U. Wilkemeyer M.F. Ledley F.D. Genomics. 1990; 44: 33-39Google Scholar). The leader sequence is cleaved within the mitochondria, and a mature enzyme is formed. Three functional domains have been proposed as follows: (i) the C terminus (residues 578-750), which comprises the cobalamin binding domain; (ii) the (β/α)8 barrel (residues 87-416) to which the CoA of methylmalonyl-CoA binds; and (iii) the N terminus with a region involved in the dimerization of the two MCM monomers (residues 32-87). Cloning of the mouse locus revealed a 94% homology to the human amino acid sequence (8Wilkemeyer M.F. Crane A.M. Ledley F.D. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the mouse cDNA was shown to complement patient cell lines, thus confirming its homology at a functional level. To develop a mouse model for mut0 MMA, we have disrupted the mouse mutase locus by gene targeting. We have chosen to disrupt the mouse locus within the CoA binding domain by replacement of exon 3 with an antibiotic selection marker by homologous recombination. This is the first mouse model to be developed for the mut-/- form of MMA disease. Here we describe the observed phenotype and the biochemical characterization of these mice. Construction of Targeting Cassette—The primers 2aF, 5′-TGGGAGTATTCATGCTTCAC-3′, and 2aR, 5′-CTGCATACTGACGGATGGTC-3′, were designed to amplify a 349-bp product encompassing mouse mutase exon 2. Similarly, the primers 13F, 5′-ATGGATCCTCAGCCAGACC-3′, and 13R, 5′-TGTATACAGATCAGCGTGTTTC-3′, were designed to amplify a 280-bp product encompassing mouse exon 13. The mouse exon 2 and exon 13-specific PCR products were used as probes to screen the RPCI-23 mouse BAC library (BACPAC Resources, Oakland, CA). Among the clones identified, the BAC clone 38D7 (RPCI-23; 38D7, 100 kb) appeared to contain the entire mouse mutase locus. The targeting vector was constructed by subcloning an 11.2-kb NheI/BamHI restriction digestion fragment containing exons 2-5 of the mouse mutase locus from BAC clone 38D7 into the tetracycline resistance gene of the pBR322 plasmid. Insertion of this fragment disrupted the tetracycline resistance gene and produced pBR_mutA (data not shown). A 1468-bp fragment containing exon 3 and flanking intronic sequence was deleted from pBR_mutA by NcoI restriction digestion and replaced with an antibiotic selection cassette to disrupt the CoA binding domain (Fig. 1A). The 1.55-kb neomycin/kanamycin antibiotic selection cassette was amplified by PCR from the plasmid pEGFP-N22 (9Vadolas J. Wardan H. Orford M. Voullaire L. Zaibak F. Williamson R. Ioannou P.A. Blood. 2002; 100: 4209-4216Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) using primers LNK-F, 5′-AATATTTAAATAACTTCGTATAGCATACATTATACGAAGTTATATTCTAAATACATTCAAATAT-3′, and LNK-R, 5′-AATATTTAAATATAACTTCGTATAATGTATGCTATACGAAGTTATGAACAAACGACCCAACA-3′, with attached loxP sites (underlined sequence). The selection cassette was gel-purified and cloned into the NcoI sites of pBR_mutA using TA cloning to produce pBR_mutB (Fig. 1B). Clones containing the selection cassette in the reverse orientation were used for targeting into embryonic stem (ES) cells. This construct when homologously recombined into the mouse mutase locus should cause deletion of exon 3 (Fig. 1C). If the selection cassette is spliced out by splicing between exons 2 and 4, it should produce a frameshift with premature protein truncation and total loss of enzyme function. Generation and Microinjection of Targeted Embryonic Stem Cells—Mouse ES cells from a W9.5 line were used for transfection. Cells (5 × 107) were electroporated with 30 μg of pBR_mutB DNA, which had been linearized by restriction digestion with EcoRV. Settings were 0.8 kV, 3 microfarads, and maximum Ω using a Bio-Rad gene pulser (Bio-Rad). Transfected ES cells were grown on STO NeoR feeder cells using standard ES medium containing leukemia inhibitory factor (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA) and β-mercaptoethanol. G418 (Invitrogen) antibiotic selection at 200 μg/ml was added after 24 h and continued for 7 days. Resistant colonies were picked from day 6 to day 11. Cell lines were established and stored at -70 °C. An aliquot of each line was seeded onto gelatin plates and grown to confluency. DNA was extracted and used for PCR screening to detect correct recombinants. Correctly targeted cell lines were initially determined by PCR using the primers sF, 5′-CAATAGAAGCCTTCCCAGAATG-3′, and sR, 5′-TTTTCTGGATTCATCGACTGT-3′, to give a product of 3 kb (Fig. 1C). Targeted cell lines were karyotyped and confirmed by fluorescent in situ hybridization and Southern blot analysis to contain a single targeting event (data not shown). Standard methods were used to microinject the targeted ES cell line into C57BL/6 blastocysts (10Bradley A. Robertson E.J. Teratocarcinomas and Embryonic Stem Cells: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1987: 113-152Google Scholar). These were transferred into pseudopregnant Swiss HSDOla-recipient mice. Chimeric mice were detected by coat color and mated with C57BL/6 mice to produce heterozygotes. Heterozygous progeny were interbred to produce homozygous knock-out mice. Genotyping and Southern Analysis of Mice—DNA was extracted from mouse tail by standard methods and used for PCR genotyping (8Wilkemeyer M.F. Crane A.M. Ledley F.D. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Primers used for screening were as follows: neoF, 5′-CAACAGACAATCGGCTGCTC-3′; neoR, 5′-GTCACGACGAGATCCTCGC-3′ (485 bp); expF, 5′-GGACCATATCCTACCATGT ATAC-3′; and expR, 5′-ACAGTGTCAATAGCAACTCCAG-3′ (1243 bp). Southern blot analysis was performed on genomic DNA restriction digested with EcoRI and PstI and probed with a 250-bp exon 2 PCR fragment to confirm correct targeting of the 5′ end of the construct. Correct targeting was confirmed at the 3′ end by SacI digestion and probing with a 200-bp exon 6 PCR probe (Fig. 1C). RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from liver using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. First strand synthesis was carried out with SuperScript™ RNase H reverse transcriptase kit (Invitrogen) using a random primer. PCR was carried out using primers 2F, 5′-CTTATATGGCACACCCCAGAA-3′, and 6R, 5′-TCCTGAATGATGATTCGTGTG-3′, for exons 2-6 (product length 1.2 kb) of the mouse mutase gene. Control RT-PCR for the mouse Frda mRNA was carried out with primers FATGCN-F, 5′-GCTCTCTAGAYGAGAC-3′, and FATGCN-R, 5′-CCCAAARGAGACATC-3′ (product length 125 bp). [14C]Propionate Incorporation Assay—Fibroblast cultures were set up from skin biopsies. Cells were grown to confluence in 25-cm2 flasks before trypsinization, splitting one-third, and incubation in a depleted medium (minimum Eagle's medium with added l-glutamine, non-essential amino acids, and fetal bovine serum) for 3 days. Cells were washed and incubated with labeled medium (Earl's balanced salt solution containing 200 nmol/ml propionate and 18 nmol/ml (1.0 mCi/ml) [14C]propionate) for 18 h. Mutase activity was determined using the method of [14C]propionate incorporation into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material (11Willard H.F. Ambani L.M. Hart A.C. Mahoney M.J. Rosenberg L.E. Human Genet. 1976; 34: 277-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Incorporation was normalized with respect to protein content. Protein was determined using the Lowry method. Analysis of Urine and Blood Metabolites—A 2-15-μl urine sample was collected from each newborn pup and at various time points after birth within the first 24 h and was frozen until analysis. Organic acids were extracted with ethyl acetate, converted to trimethylsilyl derivatives, and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry using an Agilent 5971 system (Palo Alto, CA) (12Kushnir M.M. Komaromy-Hiller G. J. Chromatogr. B. Biomed. Sci. Appl. 2000; 741: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Selected ion monitoring at 287 m/z (methyl citric acid) and 247 m/z (methylmalonic acid) was performed. For measurement of urine MM levels by electrospray tandem mass spectrometry, a 2-μl volume of urine was mixed with 50 μl of 100 μm2H3-MM (MSD Isotopes, Montreal, Canada) and 220 μl of 50% acetonitrile:water (v:v). A 30-μl aliquot of this mixture was analyzed by flow injection into 80 μl/min of 50% acetonitrile:water (v:v) infused into the ion source of a Quattro LC tandem mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, United Kingdom) with multiple reaction monitoring for 117 > 73 m/z (MM) and 120 > 76 m/z (2H3-MM). For the measurement of acylcarnitines by tandem mass spectrometry, blood was collected from newborn mice at various time points and spotted onto absorbent cotton fiber paper (Guthrie) cards. After drying, 3-mm spots were excised from the cards, extracted with methanol, and butylated in microtiter plates according to standard methods (13Rashed M.S. Bucknall M.P. Little D. Awad A. Jacob M. Alamoudi M. Alwattar M. Ozand P.T. Clin. Chem. 1997; 43: 1129-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The same flow analysis parameters as above were used for the measurement of acylcarnitines, including the levels of C3, C2, and C0 carnitines. multiple reaction monitoring transitions (M + H > 85 m/z) were used to measure the acylcarnitines. Histopathology—Tissue samples were collected from culled mouse pups. Kidney, liver, and the intact brain were dissected and placed in 10% formalin. Coronal sections were taken from each organ of wild type mice, heterozygous mice, and homozygote knock-out mice at various times after birth and stained with hemotoxylin and eosin (H&E) or periodic acid Schiff reagent. The targeting construct, pBR_mutB (Fig. 1B), was designed to replace exon 3 of the mouse mutase locus with a neomycin/kanamycin selection cassette, running in the reverse orientation, flanked by loxP sites. The exon 3 region is critical for CoA binding, and its disruption should result in a loss of function. Furthermore, even if the selection cassette was deleted by alternative splicing between exons 2 and 4, the deletion should lead to premature termination. A low targeting frequency in the order of 1 in 1000 was obtained between the targeting construct and homologous sequences in mouse ES cells. One correctly targeted ES cell line was identified by PCR screening, Southern blot analysis, and fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis (data not shown). However, the first chimeric animals generated after injection of this cell line into C57Bl/6 blastocysts were inexplicably lost over the first weeks after birth along with non-chimeric animals. No cause could be established for the loss of these animals. The injection was repeated and resulted in two germ line chimeras. These mice were crossed with C57BL/6 to produce heterozygous progeny and establish a healthy colony of heterozygous knock-out animals. Heterozygous knock-out animals are phenotypically normal and have normal growth and fertility. Heterozygous mice were intercrossed to produce homozygous progeny. Among 76 offspring from 12 littermates from such crosses, we identified by PCR screening 17 animals that had the homozygous knock-out genotype (Fig. 2A), a result consistent with the expected Mendelian frequency. Southern blot analysis for the 5′ and 3′ ends of the targeting cassette gave the expected size fragments (Fig. 2, B and C), also confirming homozygosity for the knock-out allele in affected neonates. Homozygous null mice were born normally and were indistinguishable from their normal littermates at birth. They were of comparable birth weight and initially were active, vigorous, and suckled normally as evidenced by the observation of large milk spots in the stomach shortly after birth. By 15-18 h of age, homozygous null mice gradually became less active and stopped suckling (observation of pups behavior along with evidence of reduced/absent milk spots). Within a few hours, homozygous pups developed intermittent gasping respirations and had to be humanely sacrificed. Homozygous null mice did not survive beyond 24 h of age. The mutase expression was examined in total RNA extracted from liver tissue of wild type, heterozygous, and homozygous knock-out mice. RT-PCR was performed using primers flanking the targeting cassette. No product was observed in homozygous mice. Control primers from the widely expressed Frda locus were used to confirm integrity of the RNA (Fig. 2D). Biochemical Characterization—Enzyme activity was assessed indirectly using [14C]propionate incorporation in cultured fibroblasts. Measurements were performed in duplicate, giving incorporation of 635 pmol propionate/mg protein/18 h in wild type mice compared with 39 pmol propionate/mg protein/18 h in homozygous knock-out mice. The residual enzyme activity detected in homozygous knock-out animals corresponded to only approximately 6% of the activity relative to wild type mice. MM and methylcitric acid were grossly increased in urine as assessed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Fig. 3A). Measurement of urinary MMA levels collected at various time points post-delivery and measured using tandem mass spectrometry identified grossly elevated MM levels immediately after birth with a sequential increase over time (Fig. 3B). There was no significant difference between levels in heterozygotes and wild type mice, although the method used may not have adequate sensitivity to detect small increases in heterozygotes. Analysis of urine by dipstick showed a urinary pH of 6 with none of the urine samples tested (n = 15), showing evidence of ketonuria. This included testing of urine samples immediately prior to death and with greatly elevated MM levels. Analysis of acylcarnitines identified the mean of propionylcarnitine (C3) levels to be approximately 6 times greater than mean levels in heterozygous and wild type mice (Table I). There was no significant difference between knock-out and wild type mice for the other acylcarnitines. A comparison of the ratio of propionylcarnitine to free carnitine (C3:C0) and to acetylcarnitine (C3:C2) showed that these ratios were approximately 7-fold higher in homozygous mice when compared with unaffected controls (Table I). These ratios have similarly been shown to be increased in human MMA subjects (14Chace D.H. DiPerna J.C. Kalas T.A. Johnson R.W. Naylor E.W. Clin. Chem. 2001; 47: 2040-2044Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).Table IMeasurement of acylcarnitines by tandem mass spectrometry in mouse bloodGenotype/phenotypeC3C3:C0C3:C2Homozygous knock-out (n = 5)18.66 ± 6.90.57 ± 0.260.48 ± 0.18Control (n = 4)2.9 ± 0.440.08 ± 0.010.07 ± 0.02 Open table in a new tab Histology of the kidney showed no identifiable abnormality in homozygous mice. Sections were taken through five regions of the brain, and no gross histological abnormalities were detected on H&E stain (data not shown). Examination of liver samples taken within 12 h of birth was normal in homozygous knock-out animals in contrast to samples collected at around 20 h of age, which showed evidence of moderate fatty change in liver parenchyma (Fig. 4). Mice homozygous for the knock-out allele demonstrate a phenotype similar to that of the human mut0 MMA. As frequently occurs with the human MMA disorder, they are born normally and develop disease in the newborn period once they are removed from the maternal circulation and commence ingestion of protein. The maternal circulation in this model also appears to be protective of the fetus, at least to the extent that mice develop normally in utero and are born healthy. Nevertheless, levels of MMA in the urine are already significantly elevated even with the first sample collected straight after birth. This suggests the maternal circulation does not completely “detoxify” the fetus. This finding is in agreement with the observed elevation of odd-numbered long-chain fatty acids in fetuses in disorders of propionate metabolism, reflecting the ongoing in utero elevation of propionyl-CoA despite the maternal circulation (15Wendel U. Baumgartner R. van der Meer S. Spaapen L. Pediatr. Res. 1991; 29: 403-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The significance of this to the health of the developing fetus is unclear at this stage. Studies of RNA by RT-PCR in these mice failed to show any mutase product in homozygotes. The targeting cassette was designed such that if the antibiotic marker was alternatively spliced the resulting product would result in a frameshift with a premature termination codon. We postulate that no product was produced as a result of unstable RNA and nonsense-mediated decay. In keeping with the null genotype was the [14C]propionate incorporation, indicating a marked reduction in MCM activity. Biochemically, these mice demonstrate the characteristic biochemical changes observed in MMA. They have elevated urinary levels of methylmalonic and methylcitric acids and an elevation in blood of C3 or propionylcarnitine in the range observed with human disease (12Kushnir M.M. Komaromy-Hiller G. J. Chromatogr. B. Biomed. Sci. Appl. 2000; 741: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 14Chace D.H. DiPerna J.C. Kalas T.A. Johnson R.W. Naylor E.W. Clin. Chem. 2001; 47: 2040-2044Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The C3:C2 and C3:C0 ratios, which are used as another indicator for the identification of the organic acid disorders MMA and propionic acidemia (PA) in newborn-screening programs, are also elevated in our animal model. Massive ketosis with hyperglycinuria was first reported in the early 1960s in an infant suffering from a disorder in the pathway of propionate metabolism that was later confirmed to be PA (16Childs B. Nhyan W.L. Borden M. Bard L. Cooke R.E. Pediatrics. 1961; 27: 522PubMed Google Scholar). Since that time, there have been many reports of individuals with PA or MMA describing them as disorders with massive ketoacidosis. Therefore, it is interesting that our mouse model does not have evidence of ketosis on dipstick testing of the urine. Although there may be differences between human and mouse metabolism, this is not likely to be the (only) explanation, given the recent report of a knock-out mouse model for propionic acidemia in which ketosis was readily identified by strip-testing the urine of homozygous knock-out mice as early as 10 h of age (17Miyazaki T. Ohura T. Kobayashi M. Shigematsu Y. Yamaguchi S. Suzuki Y. Hata I. Aoki Y. Yang X. Minjares C. Haruta I. Uto H. Ito Y. Muller U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35995-35999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In this context, it is interesting that a study on two children with MMA reported that they were not particularly ketotic during illnesses (18Oberholzer V.G. Levin B. Burgess E.A. Young W.F. Arch. Dis. Child. 1967; 42: 492-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). However, one patient demonstrated an elevation of ketones following loading with protein, l-valine, propionate, and l-leucine. It was postulated that MM-CoA may be toxic to citrate synthase, leading to an increase in acetyl-CoA used for ketone body production. This could be exacerbated by hypoglycemia, an observed secondary affect of elevated MM-CoA, leading to utilization of fat and therefore further ketone body production. In another infant with B12-responsive MMA, a rise in ketones prior to the increase in methylmalonic acid was observed, which did not occur until 12-24 h into the illness (19Kolvraa S. Gregersen N. Christensen E. Rasmussen K. J. Inher. Metab. Dis. 1980; 3: 63-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). This finding has prompted the clinical practice of measuring urinary ketones in MMA patients with the onset of intercurrent infections to detect impending instability in MMA. A review of the literature for other case reports of MMA indicates that the occurrence of ketosis in MMA is variable with a significant number of patients not developing ketosis. Although individuals with propionic acidemia may have a greater propensity to develop ketosis, a patient has also been described in whom this was not a consistent finding (20Wadlington W.B. Kilroy A. Ando T. Sweetman L. Nyhan W.L. J. Pediatr. 1975; 86: 707-712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), suggesting that a more rigorous evaluation of the occurrence and triggers for ketosis in these disorders may be warranted. Histopathology on the liver shows that our homozygous knock-out mice rapidly develop fatty changes with increasing levels of methylmalonic acid. Similar findings were also reported in homozygous knock-out mice for PA (17Miyazaki T. Ohura T. Kobayashi M. Shigematsu Y. Yamaguchi S. Suzuki Y. Hata I. Aoki Y. Yang X. Minjares C. Haruta I. Uto H. Ito Y. Muller U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35995-35999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Variable hepatomegaly has been described in a number of cases of MMA, whereas fatty change has also been reported as a histological finding (21Stokke O. Eldjarn L. Norm K.R. Steen-Johnsen J. Halvorsen S. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 1967; 20: 313-328Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This is probably because of a secondary effect of elevated propionyl-CoA or other metabolites on fatty acid synthesis (22Glasgow A.M. Chase H.P. Pediatr. Res. 1976; 10: 683-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The MMA knock-out model described in this report is the first mouse model for this disease. The accurate recapitulation of the main phenotypic features of the disease should make this mouse model an invaluable tool for further investigations into the pathophysiology of MMA, particularly in relation to the neurological complications of this disease as well as for the development of much needed novel therapies for this disorder. We are grateful for the support of Dr. Lucille Voullaire for the fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis of the targeted mouse ES cell line. We also thank Dr. Guy Besley and the staff at Willink Biochemical Genetics Unit, Royal Manchester Children's Hospital, Manchester, United Kingdom for their help with the [14C] propionate assay."

Analysis of the structure of DHFR-TS from C. hominis and of previously solved structures of DHFR-TS from Plasmodium falciparum and Leishmania major reveals that the linker domain primarily controls the relative orientation of the DHFR and TS domains. Using the tertiary structure of the linker domains, we have been able to place a number of protozoa in two distinct and dissimilar structural families corresponding to two evolutionary families and provide the first structural evidence validating the use of DHFR-TS as a tool of phylogenetic classification. Furthermore, the structure of C. hominis DHFR-TS calls into question surface electrostatic channeling as the universal means of dihydrofolate transport between TS and DHFR in the bifunctional enzyme.

Thymidylate synthase (TS) 1The abbreviations used are: TSthymidylate synthaseDHFRdihydrofolate reductaseChDHFR-TSDHFR-TS from C. hominisPfDHFR-TSDFHR-TS from P. falciparumLmDHFR-TSDHFR-TS from L. major. and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) are essential enzymes in the cell cycle of all organisms, since they catalyze the production of dTMP, required for DNA replication. TS converts the substrate, dUMP, to dTMP by reductive methylation using the cofactor, 5,10-methylene tetrahydrofolate, and releases dihydrofolate (1Carreras C. Santi D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 721-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). In the presence of the cofactor NADPH, DHFR reduces dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate. The folate cycle is completed by serine hydroxymethyl transferase, which converts tetrahydrofolate back to 5,10-methylene tetrahydrofolate. thymidylate synthase dihydrofolate reductase DHFR-TS from C. hominis DFHR-TS from P. falciparum DHFR-TS from L. major. Recently, Stechmann and Cavalier-Smith (2Stechmann A. Cavalier-Smith T. Science. 2002; 297: 89-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) have addressed the problem of locating the root of the eukaryotic tree, one of the most challenging evolutionary problems. In several protozoa, including Alveolates and Euglenozoa, and in some plants, the genes for DHFR and TS are translated as a single polypeptide, forming a bifunctional enzyme (DHFR-TS), whereas in most animals, fungi, and bacteria, these two enzymes are monofunctional. The monofunctional form of DHFR is a monomer, and that of TS is a dimer. The currently held hypothesis is that the primordial form of DHFR and TS is the monofunctional form and that the genes for DHFR and TS became fused at a single evolutionary point. If the DHFR-TS gene fusion occurred just once, then the fused gene provides an excellent phylogenetic marker, since reversing the fusion would require multiple genetic events. Stechmann and Cavalier-Smith have used the derived gene fusion between DHFR and TS to place the root of the tree below the common ancestor of plants, Alveolates, and Euglenozoa (Fig. 1 shows the overview of the tree; classifications are described in greater detail below). There has been significant controversy concerning the classification and evolutionary progression of the protozoa (2Stechmann A. Cavalier-Smith T.

It is thought that many eukaryotic taxa arose during one explosive event into a cluster that has proved difficult to resolve (6Knoll A. Science. 1992; 256: 622-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Sequences of rRNA and four other protein-encoding genes (5Baldauf S. Roger A. Wenk-Seifert I. Doolittle W. Science. 2000; 290: 972-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar) have been used to place the protists into several groups. In this work, we investigated several protozoa with bifunctional DHFR-TS: Alveolata, including the Apicomplexans Cryptosporidium, Toxoplasma, and Plasmodium and Euglenozoa, including the kinetoplastids such as Leishmania and the trypanosomes. To better understand whether bifunctional DHFR-TS is a good tool for the phylogenetic classification of some families of protozoa, we have solved the crystal structure of DHFR-TS from Cryptosporidium hominis (ChDHFR-TS), previously called Cryptosporidium parvum type 1 (7Vasquez J. Gooze L. Kim K. Gut J. Petersen C. Nelson R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 79: 153-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), to 2.8 Å and performed a structure-function analysis with previously solved structures of DHFR-TS from Plasmodium falciparum (PfDHFR-TS) (8Yuvaniyama J. Chitnumsub P. Kamchonwongpaisan S. Vanichtanankul J. Sirawaraporn W. Taylor P. Walkinshaw M. Yuthavong Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 357-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) and Leishmania major (LmDHFR-TS) (9Knighton D. Kan C. Howland E. Janson C. Hostomska Z. Welsh K. Matthews D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 186-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The structures differ with respect to the docking of DHFR on TS, the length and interactions of the N terminus, and the structure of the linker domains between the DHFR and TS domains. Major differences exist between the Apicomplexan and the kinetoplastid DHFR-TS structures. The analysis reveals that there are dissimilar associations for DHFR and TS that correspond to two distinct families of protozoa. Furthermore, sequence analysis of additional DHFR-TS genes from various families of protozoa reveals that they, too, fall into these two families. The structural differences we discovered between the linker domains of the Apicomplexan and kinetoplastid DHFR-TS families raised questions concerning the conservation of the electrostatic channeling mechanism between the families. The structure of LmDHFR-TS, the first DHFR-TS structure to be solved, enabled a hypothesis to explain the channeling of dihydrofolate from TS to DHFR (9Knighton D. Kan C. Howland E. Janson C. Hostomska Z. Welsh K. Matthews D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 186-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Knighton et al. reported that a series of positively charged residues lined the surface of the protein, extending from the TS active site to the DHFR active site. These residues were postulated to potentially guide the negatively charged dihydrofolate from TS to DHFR in the sequential reaction. In fact, there is experimental evidence for channeling of dihydrofolate from TS to DHFR (10Liang P. Anderson K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12195-12205Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) in L. major, but it is not conclusive that this mechanism is based on electrostatics or extends to all species of DHFR-TS. Stroud (11Stroud R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) has previously postulated an alternative mechanism based on a rapid association of the DHFR and TS active sites by molecular dynamics. Our analysis of the electrostatic potential of ChDHFR-TS shows no pattern of positively charged residues between active sites that would indicate an electrostatic transfer of dihydrofolate. Crystallization—Pure ChDHFR-TS was obtained from J. Vasquez and R. Nelson (7Vasquez J. Gooze L. Kim K. Gut J. Petersen C. Nelson R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 79: 153-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The protein was purified on a methotrexate affinity column and eluted with 2 mm dihydrofolate. Fractions containing pure protein were concentrated to 7 mg/ml and incubated with 2 mm ligands (methotrexate, NADPH, CB3717, and dUMP) for approximately 1 h on ice. Using hanging drop vapor diffusion, a promising crystallization condition was refined to 10% polyethylene glycol 6000, 50 mm ammonium sulfate, 150 mm lithium sulfate, and 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0. Crystals grew in 2 weeks. The crystals were soaked in 15% ethylene glycol for 5 min and then in 25% ethylene glycol for another 5 min before being plunged into liquid nitrogen for cryogenic data collection. Data Collection—Data were collected to 2.8-Å resolution at Brookhaven National Laboratory at beamline X12C on a B4-2k CCD detector. The crystals belong to space group C2 with unit cell edges a = 214.9, b = 116.3, c = 219.7 Å and β = 95.23°. The data were indexed, integrated, and scaled with Denzo/Scalepack (12Otwinowski Z. Denzo/Scalepack. SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1993Google Scholar) and converted to structure factors with Truncate (13Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). A random set of reflections (10%) was set aside for the calculation of Rfree. Structure Determination—The structure was determined by molecular replacement using a model of thymidylate synthase from P. carinii (Protein Data Bank 1F28) (14Anderson A. O'Neil R. Surti T. Stroud R. Chem. Biol. 2001; 8: 445-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), from which all ligands were removed, as a search model (15Brunger A. Acta Crystallogr. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). A self-rotation map showed a large peak indicating 5-fold noncrystallographic symmetry. Cross-rotation peaks related by 72° were selected by a quaternion algorithm 2R. Lilien, C. Bailey-Kellogg, A. Anderson, and B. Donald, manuscript in preparation. and subjected to a translation search. Two full dimers of TS were placed in the asymmetric unit, and a third dimer of TS was located across the 2-fold symmetry axis, yielding five monomers per asymmetric unit. The molecules are conjugated in an endless helix with a noncrystallographic 51 axis that that runs throughout the entire crystal. Five models of DHFR from P. carinii (Protein Data Bank 1CD2) (16Cody V. Galitsky N. Rak D. Luft J. Pangborn W. Queener S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4303-4312Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), without ligands, were placed using the fixed positions of the TS models as initial phase estimates. The starting R-factor was 52%. Residues for ChDHFR-TS were substituted in the models of P. carinii DHFR and TS and refined using noncrystallographic restraints between all monomers of DHFR and TS. Electron density for the ligands and the linker region was visible in the initial maps. The ligands were positioned, the linker region was built, and the entire complex was refined to an R-factor of 24.1% and Rfree = 25.8% using CNS. Water molecules were added where adequate hydrogen bonding to a donor or acceptor on the protein was visible and until there was no remaining difference density. The final R-factor was 22.5%, and Rfree was 24.5%.

The deposited coordinates were used to calculate phase angles. Description of the Overall Structure—The structure of ChDHFR-TS illustrates that the enzyme is a homodimer based on the canonical dimer interface of TS (Fig. 2). Based on structural comparisons with other DHFR and TS proteins, the DHFR domain is 178 residues, the linker domain is 58 residues, and the TS domain is 284 residues, yielding a 63-kDa monomer. All residues from 3 to 521 are clearly defined in the electron density, allowing the entire protein model to be visualized. The bulk of the DHFR domains do not contact each other, but the linker polypeptide between the DHFR and TS domains crosses from one DHFR monomer (A) to the other DHFR monomer (B), noncovalently connecting the two DHFR domains, and then returns to form the TS monomer of A (see discussion below). In the view shown in Fig. 1, the DHFR active site of the left monomer faces the viewer, and the TS active site is on the side of the enzyme. The DHFR and TS active sites of the same monomer are ∼74 Å apart along the surface of the enzyme and 45 Å apart if measured directly through the enzyme from the diaminopyrimidine ring of dihydrofolate to the quinazoline ring of CB3717. The molecules in the unit cell are arranged with a noncrystallographic quasi-51 screw axis, forming lines of molecules extending throughout the crystal. Structure of the C. hominis DHFR Domain—The structure of the DHFR domain of ChDHFR-TS generally resembles that of several other DHFR proteins from eukaryotic organisms (16Cody V. Galitsky N. Rak D. Luft J. Pangborn W. Queener S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4303-4312Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 17Cody V. Luft J. Ciszak E. Kalman T. Freisheim J.

Structure. 1994; 2: 915-924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, DHFR from most other organisms, including L. major, has an eight-stranded β-sheet, and C. hominis DHFR has a nine-stranded β-sheet, where the last four residues of the linker polypeptide form the ninth strand of the sheet. The C. hominis DHFR active site reveals the conservation of catalytically important residues (17Cody V. Luft J. Ciszak E. Kalman T. Freisheim J. Anti-Cancer Drug Des. 1992; 7: 483-491PubMed Google Scholar, 18Champness J. Achari A. Ballantine S. Bryant P. Delves C. Stammers D.

Chem. 1982; 257: 13650-13662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Electron density for the ligands, dihydrofolate and NADPH, was visible in the initial maps (Fig. 3a). In the ChDHFR-TS structure, dihydrofolate is bound in the active site in the same orientation as dihydrofolate in the human DHFR active site (21Oefner C. D'Arcy A. Winkler F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 174: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). NADPH is bound using similar interactions as noted in other structures of eukaryotic species of DHFR (17Cody V. Luft J. Ciszak E. Kalman T. Freisheim J. Anti-Cancer Drug Des. 1992; 7: 483-491PubMed Google Scholar, 18Champness J. Achari A. Ballantine S. Bryant P. Delves C. Stammers D. Structure. 1994; 2: 915-924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In ChDHFR-TS, the DHFR interface with the TS domain of the same monomer buries a combined surface area of ∼1300 Å 2R. Lilien, C. Bailey-Kellogg, A. Anderson, and B. Donald, manuscript in preparation.. The interface includes not only residues in the canonical TS and DHFR domains but also includes several residues that belong to the linker between the domains. In general, the TS residues in the interface are widely conserved across most species; the DHFR residues are not generally conserved. The interface between C. hominis DHFR and C. hominis TS is primarily hydrophobic and includes a number of van der Waals' interactions between hydrophobic side chains. There are two hydrogen bonds (Glu139-Tyr510 and Ser169-Gln486) between residues belonging to the canonical DHFR and TS domains. There are an additional three hydrogen bonds (Arg210-Glu276, Arg215-Arg275, and Arg233-Asp242) stabilizing the interface between residues in the linker and residues in TS. Overall, there are relatively few interactions between the residues in the canonical DHFR and TS domains and the interactions that are present involve weak van der Waals' forces. Structure of the C. hominis TS Domain—The overall structure of the TS domain of ChDHFR-TS strongly resembles that of human TS (22Sayre P. Finer-Moore J. Fritz T. Biermann D. Gates S. MacKellar W.

Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 988-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and TS from other eukaryotic sources (24Anderson A. Perry K. Freymann D. Stroud R. J. Mol.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1087-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The substrate, dUMP, and the cofactor mimic, CB3717, are bound to C. hominis TS in both active sites. The nucleophilic cysteine residue, Cys402, is covalently attached to the C-6 position of dUMP. CB3717 is bound in a similar manner as seen in other structures of monofunctional TS (24Anderson A. Perry K. Freymann D. Stroud R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 645-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 26Montfort W. Perry K. Fauman E. Finer-Moore J. Maley G. Hardy L. Maley F. Stroud R.

Biol. 1994; 1: 186-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Structure of the ChDHFR-TS Linker Domain—Several DHFR-TS proteins, notably from Apicomplexan protozoa, include a long linker between the DHFR and TS domains. The linker polypeptide, even within the Apicomplexans, varies significantly in length; the entire linker in C. hominis is 58 amino acids, the linker in Toxoplasma gondii is 72 amino acids, and the linker in P. falciparum is 89 amino acids. The linker in ChDHFR-TS plays an important role in the structure of the enzyme. Compared with the structure of DHFR-TS from PfDHFR-TS (8Yuvaniyama J. Chitnumsub P. Kamchonwongpaisan S. Vanichtanankul J. Sirawaraporn W. Taylor P. Walkinshaw M. Yuthavong Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 357-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) in which major portions of the linker domain are not built into the model, the entire linker domain of ChDHFR-TS is clearly visible in the electron density (Fig. 3b). The chain leaves DHFR of monomer A at residue 178, crosses to DHFR of monomer B, forms an 11-residue helix, termed the donated helix, that packs against the DHFR active site residues of monomer B, crosses back to DHFR of monomer A to form the last strand of the 9-stranded β-sheet of the DHFR domain, and then finally joins the TS domain of monomer A. The crossover is repeated for both dimers, resulting in four chains crossing the cleft between the DHFR domains: one leaving the A monomer and going to the donated helix (tether 1), one returning to A after forming the donated helix (tether 2), and the 2-fold related chains leaving and returning to B. There is one hydrogen bond between the linker polypeptides of the A and B monomers (Gln192A with Gln192B). There are several additional hydrogen bonds between tethers 1 and 2 within one monomer: Arg230A with Gln184A, Asp201A with Arg190A, and Asn185A with Asn187A. The donated helix (residues 196-207) packs tightly against the opposite monomer on the back side of its DHFR active site using mainly hydrophobic interactions (Table II). Clearly, all of the interactions of the donated helix are important in domain stabilization.Table IIInteractions between the donated helix and the opposite monomerResidue in donated helixResidue in opposite monomerHydrogen bondsSer195Glu176Asp198Asn42Arg210Glu31Arg210Cys164 (backbone oxygen)Arg210Glu276Van der Waals' interactionsIle196Val157, Leu193Val200Tyr159Leu202Lys38, Ile39, Tyr132Leu203Phe35, Phe163, Phe172Ile206Phe35Phe207Phe163, Phe172 Open table in a new tab The donated helix may be implicated in the mechanism of the bifunctional enzyme. Genetic analysis, kinetic measurements, and molecular dynamics simulations identify a network of coupled motions that occur during DHFR catalysis (27Agarwal P. Billeter S. Rajagopalan P. Benkovic S. Hammes-Schiffer S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2002; 99: 2794-2799Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that Phe31 (Escherichia coli numbering) approaches the bound dihydrofolate, directing the conformational changes that bring the substrate to the transition state (27Agarwal P. Billeter S. Rajagopalan P. Benkovic S. Hammes-Schiffer S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2002; 99: 2794-2799Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 28Watney J. Agarwal P. Hammes-Schiffer S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 3745-3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Phe31 is strictly conserved, and mutations of this residue strongly decrease the rate of hydride transfer (29Chen J.-T. Taira K. Tu C. Benkovic S. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4093-4100Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The donated helix in ChDHFR-TS contacts residues in C. hominis DHFR that are equivalent to those identified as being involved in the coupled motions of catalysis (see Fig. 4). Phe36 in ChDHFR-TS is equivalent to Phe31 in E. coli, and the helix containing Phe36 and Phe35 in the ChDHFR-TS active site packs against the donated helix from the linker of the opposite monomer. The closely fitting interaction between the donated helix and the catalytic residues implies that the donated helix may be affected by the conformational changes occurring during catalysis and may represent a signaling mechanism between the two monomers of the enzyme. The tethers crossing back to the originating monomer could possibly carry a signal revealing the catalytic status of the opposite monomer. The human monofunctional DHFR positions several residues at the same location as the donated helix. Residues Tyr162, Pro163, Gly164, and Val165 of human DHFR form a loop that extends away from the body of DHFR and makes very similar interactions with the back side of the active site. However, if the donated helix is crucial to a mechanism in the bifunctional enzymes, it must be significantly different from any mechanism in the monofunctional enzymes if, in fact, the monofunctional enzymes associate in the cell. Comparison of All Bifunctional DHFR-TS Structures—The docking surface of C. hominis DHFR and C. hominis TS consists of mainly hydrophobic residues and does not contribute to the docking of DHFR on TS in a lock-and-key fashion. The docking area for DHFR on TS appears to provide only an attractive and not an orienting force. The fact that the contacts between DHFR and TS are nonspecific was previously recognized in an analysis of the LmDHFR-TS structure by Knighton et al. (9Knighton D. Kan C. Howland E. Janson C. Hostomska Z. Welsh K. Matthews D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 186-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In fact, the three structures of bifunctional DHFR-TS show different docking surfaces for DHFR on TS despite the conservation of TS residues in that area, giving further evidence that the TS surface provides no common orienting forces. A structural alignment of ChDHFR-TS, PfDHFR-TS, and LmDHFR-TS reveals that the linker polypeptides 58, 93, and 2 residues, respectively, play a crucial role in the orientation of the DHFR domain relative to TS. In the structures of all three enzymes, there are examples of dimers where the monomers are not related by crystallographic symmetry, providing evidence that the orientations of the monomers and the linker domains are determined within the molecule rather than by crystal packing forces. The short linker in LmDHFR-TS creates a taut tether, restricting the range of DHFR orientations relative to TS. In ChDHFR-TS, the linker creates an orienting force, composed of van der Waals' interactions and hydrogen bonds, that positions the DHFR monomers in relation to the TS domain (Fig. 5). In PfDHFR-TS, the donated helix is strongly negatively charged (Glu285, Asp284, and Asp288), complementing the positively charged groove on DHFR into which it fits (Lys56, Lys187, Lys180, Lys160, Lys227, and Lys232) (Fig. 5). The electrostatic interactions of the donated helix in PfDHFR-TS are the primary determinants of the PfDHFR-TS orientation and are supplemented by the nonspecific van der Waals' interactions of the P. falciparum DHFR to P. falciparum TS interface. A comparison of ChDHFR-TS and PfDHFR-TS reveals that the two linker domains are structurally similar despite the fact that C. hominis DHFR and P. falciparum DHFR do not contact TS in the same orientation. When the TS domains of ChDHFR-TS and PfDHFR-TS are aligned, P. falciparum DHFR is rotated 22.6° relative to C. hominis DHFR. The active site of DHFR, specifically the phosphate moiety near the adenine ring of NADPH, forms the pivot point of this rotation. The placement of the donated helix, at the back side of the opposite DHFR active site, is the same in ChDHFR-TS and PfDHFR-TS. If the orientation differences are taken into account and the structure of ChDHFR-TS is overlaid on PfDHFR-TS and if the electron density map for PfDHFR-TS is visualized using the structure factors deposited with the coordinates in the Protein Data Bank, then electron density corresponding to tether 1 of PfDHFR-TS is evident in the PfDHFR-TS electron density map, although its connectivity is poor. Overall, the location of the donated helix and the observation of electron density corresponding to tether 1 leads to the conclusion that the linker in PfDHFR-TS may also cross from one DHFR domain to the opposite and then cross back, similarly to ChDHFR-TS. Surprisingly, the distances between all active sites, measured directly through the enzyme, are conserved within 1 Å in both ChDHFR-TS and PfDHFR-TS (Table III). The impact of this conservation of active site distances is potentially important. If we hypothesize that a third conserved enzyme, perhaps serine hydroxymethyl transferase, is interacting in a complex composed of all of the folate cycle enzymes in the cell, the overall geometry of the interaction would be conserved across a wide variety of Apicomplexan species of the bifunctional enzyme.Table IIIDistances between active sites in DHFR-TS (Å)DHFR(A)-DHFR(B)DHFR(A)-TS(A)DHFR(A)-TS(B)ChDHFR-TS86.566.769.8PfDHFR-TS87.467.169.8 Open table in a new tab The orientation of L. major DHFR relative to L. major TS is drastically different from the orientation of DHFR to TS in ChDHFR-TS or PfDHFR-TS. LmDHFR-TS has a two-residue linker between the DHFR and TS domains. L. major DHFR is rotated upside down relative to C. hominis DHFR, causing the body of L. major DHFR to rest on the shoulder of the L. major TS domain. The DHFR and TS active sites are exposed on the same exterior side of the molecule in LmDHFR-TS. In contrast, in ChDHFR-TS, the DHFR and TS active sites are on orthogonal faces of the enzyme. In addition to the different DHFR and TS orientations, ChDHFR-TS and LmDHFR-TS differ in the placement and function of the N-terminal amino acids of DHFR. ChDHFR-TS and PfDHFR-TS do not have an N-terminal extension, relative to the canonical fold of DHFR, which interacts with the TS domain. In LmDHFR-TS, the 22-residue N-terminal extension on DHFR fits into a groove on the exterior of TS and stabilizes the interaction between L. major DHFR and L. major TS. In contrast, the N terminus of ChDHFR-TS and PfDHFR-TS points upward away from TS and remains close to DHFR. Sequence Analysis of DHFR-TS within Multiple Protist Families—Using the three structures analyzed above, we created a functional analysis of all available complete sequences in the Euglenozoa and Alveolata families. This functional analysis aligns the residues corresponding to the canonical folds for DHFR and TS (Fig. 6). The beginning and the end of the DHFR and TS domains were determined by structural alignment for ChDHFR-TS, PfDHFR-TS, and LmDHFR-TS. The beginning and the end of the DHFR and TS domains of T. gondii (Fig. 6, TgDHFR-TS), Trypanosome cruzi, and Trypanosome brucei DHFR-TS were determined by sequence alignments, since the structures of these proteins have not yet been determined. DHFR-TS from Euglenozoa such as Leishmania, T. cruzi, and T. brucei all have an N-terminal extension relative to the start of the canonical DHFR fold and short, two-residue (Arg-Asn) linkers. The Apicomplexans Cryptosporidium and Toxoplasma do not have N-terminal extensions and generally have longer linkers. Secondary structure prediction suggests a helix within the linker of T. gondii DHFR-TS at positions 288-297. This helix may be, in fact, longer than nine residues, but has been predicted conservatively. Plasmodium falciparum, an Apicomplexan, has a long linker and a partial (eight-residue) N-terminal extension, although this extension points away from TS and does not form an interaction with TS (8Yuvaniyama J. Chitnumsub P. Kamchonwongpaisan S. Vanichtanankul J. Sirawaraporn W. Taylor P. Walkinshaw M. Yuthavong Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 357-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) similar to that seen in LmDHFR-TS. The functional analysis leads to the conclusion that there are two families of DHFR-TS structures: a long linker family that resembles ChDHFR-TS and PfDHFR-TS and includes a donated helix (Fig. 7, a and b) and a short linker family that resembles LmDHFR-TS and uses the N-terminal extension that appears to stabilize the DHFR-TS interaction (Fig. 7, c and d).Fig. 7Schematic diagram of the long linker and short linker families of DHFR-TS structures.

The sequence of DHFR-TS from Tetrahymena pyriformis (all partial sequences, discussed in Ref. 2Stechmann A. Cavalier-Smith T. Science. 2002; 297: 89-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, include a portion of the DHFR domain, the entire linker domain, and a portion of the TS domain), a member of the Alveolates (see Fig. 1), but not an Apicomplexan, also has a long, 58-residue, linker domain between DHFR and TS with helical content corresponding to the same region as ChDHFR-TS. The sequence of the DHFR-TS gene from Diplonema ambulator (2Stechmann A. Cavalier-Smith T. Science. 2002; 297: 89-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), another protozoa in the Euglenozoa family, but not a kinetoplastid like Leishmania or the trypanosomes, confirms that it has a short, two-residue linker (Val-Asn) between the DHFR and TS domains. Sequences of DHFR-TS from Chlamydaster sterni (from the Heliozoa phylum), Cercomonas longicauda (from the Cercozoa phylum), and Amastigomonas debruynei (from the Apusozoa phylum) also have short (2-6-residue) linker domains. Apusozoa is on the first branch after the DHFR-TS fusion event. Heliozoa and Cercozoa are on the second branch, the same branch off which the Euglenozoa originate, but are only distantly related to the Euglenozoa. Based on the length of these various linker domains, we hypothesize that the structure of Tetrahymena more closely resembles the Apicomplexan DHFR-TS and that the structures of DHFR-TS from Apusozoa, Heliozoa, and Cercozoa more closely resemble the structure of LmDHFR-TS. The long linker family includes the Apicomplexans and may extend to the Alveolates (shown in red in Fig. 1); the short linker family includes the kinetoplastids and may extend to the Euglenozoa, Cercozoa, Heliozoa, and Apusozoa (shown in green in Fig. 1). The two classes appear to be evolutionarily distinct and appear to have evolved separately after the DHFR-TS gene fusion event. The two families of DHFR-TS structures confirm the separate branches shown in the evolutionary tree derived by Stechmann and Cavalier-Smith (2Stechmann A. Cavalier-Smith T. Science. 2002; 297: 89-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Since Apusozoa represent the first branch after the DHFR-TS fusion event and appear to belong to the short linker family, the short linker family may represent the primitive condition for DHFR-TS. Electrostatic Channeling—Electrostatic channeling, using several positively charged residues aligned between the TS and DHFR active sites, has been postulated to guide dihydrofolate from the TS active site to the DHFR active site in the LmDHFR-TS and PfDHFR-TS enzymes. In L. major TS, three basic side chains (Lys282, Arg283, and Arg287) are proposed to bind the polyglutamylated tail of the folate. These basic residues are adjacent to a highly basic insertion in L. major DHFR (Lys66, Lys67, Lys72, and Lys73), forming a putative electrostatic “highway” (11Stroud R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) in LmDHFR-TS. In PfDHFR-TS, there are two positively charged grooves lined with residues conserved between plasmodial DHFR-TS enzymes and hypothesized to be involved in electrostatic channeling (8Yuvaniyama J. Chitnumsub P. Kamchonwongpaisan S. Vanichtanankul J. Sirawaraporn W. Taylor P. Walkinshaw M. Yuthavong Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 357-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Biochemical experiments show that the rates of substrate transfer in T. gondii DHFR-TS are altered in the presence of varying amounts of salt, lending evidence to the electrostatic channeling hypothesis (30Trujillo M. Donald R. Roos D. Greene P. Santi D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6366-6374Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Rapid chemical quench assays (10Liang P. Anderson K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12195-12205Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) verify that, for bifunctional LmDHFR-TS enzymes, there is no lag in tetrahydrofolate production or accumulation of dihydrofolate, unlike the case for monofunctional enzymes. Brownian dynamics simulation experiments determined that almost all substrate molecules with charge -2 leaving the TS active site reached the DHFR active site in LmDHFR-TS (31Elcock A. Potter M. Matthews D. Knighton D. McCammon A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 370-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 32Elcock A. Huber G. McCammon A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16049-16058Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, in recent experiments (33Atreya C. Johnson E. Williamson J. Chang S. Liang P. Anderson K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28901-28911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), charge reversal or charge neutralization mutants in the putative channeling region of LmDHFR-TS were shown not to interfere with the kinetic channeling of substrate. There is currently no evidence supporting or denying substrate channeling in ChDHFR-TS. However, the structure of ChDHFR-TS does not show a pattern of positively charged residues like the one seen in LmDHFR-TS, giving no structural support to the theory of electrostatic channeling in ChDHFR-TS. Three of the basic residues implicated in the electrostatic highway, Lys282, Arg283, and Arg287 in L. major TS, are conserved and located near the C. hominis TS active site (Lys284, Lys285, and Arg289 in ChDHFR-TS). One of the four residues in the basic insertion found in L. major DHFR is conserved in C. hominis DHFR (Lys48), but its location, 46 Å from the positively charged residues near the TS active site, is drastically different from that of the equivalent residue in L. major DHFR, due to the significantly different docking of DHFR on TS in ChDHFR-TS relative to that in LmDHFR-TS. An electrostatic potential map of ChDHFR-TS does not reveal any other pattern of positively charged residues that would create an alternate electrostatic highway if, in fact, ChDHFR-TS does channel substrate (Fig. 8). Therefore, a pattern of positively charged residues between the TS and DHFR active sites is not a common trait between all of the bifunctional DHFR-TS enzymes. A previously proposed, alternate version of substrate channeling proposes that dynamical motion can bring the two active sites close together (11Stroud R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Whereas the ChDHFR-TS structure cannot rule out the possibility that the two active sites approach each other, it does seem very unlikely, since the DHFR and TS active sites are on orthogonal faces of the enzyme and are cross-tied by the linker between the domains. In fact, the opening of the DHFR active site points toward the 2-fold axis between the two monomers and the opening of the TS active site points in the opposite direction, away from the 2-fold axis. The enzyme would need to undergo a major rearrangement in order to bring the two sites into proximity. Conclusion—The crystal structure of DHFR-TS from C. hominis reveals a long linker and a new interaction, the donated helix, in the bifunctional DHFR-TS protein. The structures of the Apicomplexan DHFR-TS proteins, ChDHFR-TS and PfDHFR-TS, show the donated helix, and the structure of the kinetoplastid LmDHFR-TS does not. A functional alignment, partitioning several sequences of DHFR-TS proteins into DHFR, linker, and TS domains, suggests that there are two structural families of DHFR-TS proteins that evolved separately after the gene fusion event. The observation of these two families coincides with other genetic evidence that separates the Alveolates, of which the Apicomplexans are a member, and the Euglenozoa, of which Leishmania is a member. Furthermore, if the donated helix, at a conserved location with respect to TS and the opposite DHFR active site, confers an important structural or functional role to the Apicomplexans, it would confirm the advanced evolutionary placement of the Alveolates over the Euglenozoa in the phylogenetic tree (2Stechmann A. Cavalier-Smith T. Science. 2002; 297: 89-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). Finally, the structure of ChDHFR-TS does not show a pattern of positively charged residues between the DHFR and TS active sites, suggesting that it belongs to a different class of enzymes that may not use electrostatic channeling in the transfer of dihydrofolate from the TS active site to the DHFR active site. We thank John Vasquez and Rick Nelson of San Francisco General Hospital for providing pure ChDHFR-TS as well as the staff at beamline X12C at Brookhaven National Laboratory for providing synchrotron access. Chris Bailey-Kellogg contributed to the development of algorithms to determine relevant peaks in the cross-rotation function."
https://openalex.org/W1964863931,"We prepared the primary adduct for the reaction of singlet dioxygen (1O2) with an arylphosphine by using the sterically hindered arylphosphine tris(o-methoxyphenyl)phosphine. The resulting phosphadioxirane has a dioxygen molecule triangularly bound to the phosphorus atom. Olefin trapping experiments show that the phosphadioxirane can undergo nonradical oxygen atom-transfer reactions. Under protic conditions, two different intermediates are formed during the reaction of singlet dioxygen with tris(o-methoxyphenyl)phosphine, namely, the corresponding hydroperoxy arylphosphine and a hydroxy phosphorane. Experiments with other arylphosphines possessing different electronic and steric properties demonstrate that the relative stability of the tris(o-methoxyphenyl)phosphadioxirane is due to both steric and electronic effects."

Their function is to present peptides produced during intracellular protein degradation to cytotoxic T cells (1.Pamer E. Cresswell P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 323-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). The peptides typically exhibit lengths of 8-10 amino acid residues. X-ray crystallographic studies (Ref. 2.Bjorkman P.J.

Friede T. Stevanovic S. Immunogenetics. 1995; 41: 178-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1520) Google Scholar) have served to establish the rules governing peptide binding. Peptide side chains can insert into a series of pockets (termed A to F) that exhibit highly variable properties, thereby assuring allele specificity (5.Saper M.A. Bjorkman P.J. Wiley D.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219: 277-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar, 6.Matsumura M. Fremont D.H. Peterson P.A. Wilson I.A. Science. 1992; 257: 927-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Characteristic amino acids, usually near the N and C termini (positions p2 and pΩ), anchor a peptide within the binding groove of an MHC class I molecule (7.Bouvier M. Wiley D.C. Science. 1994; 265: 398-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The affinity between peptide and MHC class I molecule is further enhanced by amino acids serving as secondary anchors, often found at p3 and pΩ (8.Dédier S. Reinelt S. Reitinger T. Folkers G. Rognan D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27055-27061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The human MHC class I molecule HLA-B27 is very strongly associated to spondyloarthropathies, in particular ankylosing spondylitis (AS) (9.Khan M.A. Ann. Intern. Med. 2002; 136: 896-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 10.Ramos M. López de Castro J.A. Tissue Antigens. 2002; 60: 191-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). A clue to the understanding of the disease association might come from the finding that not all HLA-B27 subtypes are associated to AS. HLA-B27 subtypes known today differ in only very few amino acids, most of which affect the peptide binding properties of the molecule (10.Ramos M. López de Castro J.A. Tissue Antigens. 2002; 60: 191-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Two subtypes, B*2706 and B*2709, are at best very weakly associated with disease. The only difference between the prototypical, strongly AS-associated B*2705 and the non-associated B*2709 subtypes is the exchange of position 116 from aspartate to histidine (11.D'Amato M. Fiorillo M.T. Carcassi C. Mathieu A. Zuccarelli A. Bitti P.P. Tosi R. Sorrentino R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 3199-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). This exchange is located within the peptide binding groove at the floor of the F pocket and plays a pivotal role in anchoring the C-terminal peptide residue, as demonstrated by differences in the repertoires of peptides eluted from B*2705 and B*2709 molecules (12.Fiorillo M.T. Meadows L. D'Amato M. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Appella E. Sorrentino R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 368-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 13.Ramos M. Paradela A. Vazquez M. Marina A. Vazquez J. López de Castro J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28749-28756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In particular, in B*2709-bound peptides, basic amino acids are not observed at the pΩ position, and Tyr is clearly underrepresented, whereas these amino acids are frequently found as pΩ in B*2705-bound peptides. The role of HLA-B27 in disease development may, therefore, be related to the repertoire of the presented peptides, the exact conformation that these peptides adopt when bound to the molecule, the stability of the complexes, or their folding behavior, although other factors, including genetic and environmental influences, cannot be neglected either (10.Ramos M. López de Castro J.A. Tissue Antigens. 2002; 60: 191-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 14.Sieper J. Braun J. Rudwaleit M. Boonen A. Zink A. Ann. Rheum.

Today. 2000; 6: 224-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We have previously addressed these issues by determining the crystal structures of the subtypes B*2705 and B*2709 complexed with the model nona-peptide GRFAAAIAK (abbreviated as m9) (17.Hülsmeyer M. Hillig R.C. Volz A. Rühl M. Schröder W. Saenger W. Ziegler A. Uchanska-Ziegler B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47844-47853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Although it is obvious that subtype-specific folding properties could be connected to differential disease association as well (18.Rudolph M.G. Luz J.G. Wilson I.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 19.Uchanska-Ziegler B. Alexiev U. Hillig R.C. Hülsmeyer M. Pöhlmann T. Saenger W. Volz A. Ziegler A. Dupont B. Hansen J. HLA 2002: Immunobiology of the Human MHC. International Histocompatibility Working Group Press, Seattle2003Google Scholar), dynamic properties of MHC molecules have so far received comparatively little attention. A variety of different methods have been reported for the biophysical characterization of equilibrium and kinetic parameters of the interaction between MHC molecules and their respective peptide ligands. Thermodynamic properties of B*2705 molecules were investigated by monitoring the thermal unfolding using circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, demonstrating the importance of peptide residues at p3 and pΩ as well as the B-pocket residue Cys-67 (20.Reinelt S. Dédier S. Asuni G. Folkers G. Rognan D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18472-18477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Using an human immunodeficiency virus 1-derived peptide, Dédier et al. (8.Dédier S. Reinelt S. Reitinger T. Folkers G. Rognan D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27055-27061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) emphasized the importance of secondary anchors of the peptide for the stability of the entire complex. Furthermore, peptide affinity and the kinetics of the formation or unfolding of various MHC molecules (HLA-A2, HLA-E, H-2Kb, H-2Kd) were investigated by fluorescence depolarization, steady state fluorescence resonance energy transfer, and CD spectroscopy, revealing the interdependence of HC, β2m, and peptide during folding and unfolding of these molecules (21.Gakamsky D.M.

However, comparative measurements employing disease-associated and non-associated subtypes binding the same peptide have not been carried out so far, although they can be expected to shed light on the contribution of individual HC residues to peptide binding. To this end we have now carried out for the first time experiments with the B*2705 as well as the B*2709 subtype complexed with the m9 peptide and with two decameric peptides (termed s10R and s10G), employing both CD and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). We also present the crystal structure of B*2709 complexed with s10R. Our results demonstrate that the exchange of a single amino acid buried within the binding groove can have pronounced effects on the stability of differentially AS-associated HLA-B27 subtypes. Protein Preparation—The peptides m9 (GRFAAAIAK), s10R (RRLLRGHNQY), and s10G (GRLLRGHNQY) were synthesized by standard solid phase methods and purified by HPLC (m9, Alta Bioscience, Birmingham, UK; s10G and s10R, Biosyntan, Berlin, Germany). The extracellular domains of B*2705 and B*2709 as well as β2m were expressed separately in Escherichia coli as inclusion bodies. These were solubilized with urea, and the proteins were refolded by rapid dilution in the presence of the respective peptide and purified as described previously (17.Hülsmeyer M. Hillig R.C. Volz A. Rühl M. Schröder W. Saenger W. Ziegler A. Uchanska-Ziegler B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47844-47853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Free β2m was identified as a refolding byproduct and was subsequently purified by gel filtration. The final buffer for CD and DSC experiments was 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl (phosphate-buffered saline), whereas for crystallization 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl (Tris-buffered saline) was used. N-terminal sequencing revealed the loss of the N-terminal Met-0 from the HC of both HLA-B27 subtypes, whereas 80% of the β2m molecules still possessed Met-0. Circular Dichroism and Differential Scanning Calorimetry—All samples of HLA-B27, β2m, and buffers were filtered through 0.2-μm HPLC membrane filters (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany). The protein solutions were in the concentration range 0.06-0.15 mg/ml as determined by UV absorption at 280 nm. Absorption coefficients A280 nm,1 cm (β2m, 1.62; B*2705·m9 and B*2709·m9, 2.00; B*2705·s10R and B*2709·s10R, 1.98; B*2705·s10G and B*2709·s10G, 1.99) and molecular masses were calculated from the amino acid composition using the ProtParam tool on the Expasy-server (www.expasy.ch/tools/protparam.html). Thermal unfolding was measured by CD and DSC. CD measurements were performed with aliquots of the samples employed for the DSC measurements. Changes of the ellipticity Θ were monitored at 218 nm with a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter equipped with a temperature-controlled cell holder and a thermostat system (ThermoNeslab, Portsmouth, NH) at a heating rate of 20 °C/h. The negative molar ellipticity of the complexes dropped with increasing temperature, reflecting the loss of secondary structures with unfolding. The CD melting temperatures, Tm, were determined from the melting curves following a standard procedure for thermal or denaturant unfolding experiments (26.Pace C.N. Scholtz J.M. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. 2nd Ed. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1997: 299-321Google Scholar). Several transitions contribute to the experimental CD signal (see DSC melting). Therefore, the Tm values determined by CD do not represent the half-transition temperature of one well defined “two-state” process. Rather they indicate the temperature where just one-half was observed of the total ellipticity change. For DSC, excessive heat capacity curves were recorded using an ultrasensitive scanning microcalorimeter (VP-DSC, MicroCal Inc., Northampton, MA) at a heating rate of 1 K·min-1 and a sample cell volume of ∼0.5 ml. To examine the reversibility of folding the samples were cooled to 20 °C after the first run and heated up a second time. The experimental data were base-line-corrected and analyzed using the “ORIGIN for DSC” software package supplied by the manufacturer. The classical two-state model provided the best fits with a minimum of parameters and was applied for the deconvolution of all experimental curves. The model is based on the assumption that the macromolecule is composed of a number of domains, each of which is involved independently in a transition between the folded and unfolded states. Each transition is characterized by two parameters, Tm and ΔHm. Tm is the thermal midpoint of a transition. ΔHm is the calorimetric heat change and is calculated from the area under the transition peak. The basic equations used to deconvolute the DSC data are described by Privalov and Potekhin (27.Privalov P.L. Potekhin S.A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 4-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). Crystallization, X-ray Data Collection, and Structure Determination of B*2709·s10R—All crystallization trials with the B*2709·s10R complex were performed by vapor diffusion at 18 °C using the hanging drop technique. Initial conditions were identified using a PEG 8000-pH screen. Clusters of thin plates grew at 24-27% PEG and pH 6.5-8.0 (protein at 14 mg/ml). Streak seeding in drops made from 0.8 μl of protein solution (13 mg/ml B*2709·s10R in 10 mm Tris-buffered saline) and 0.8 μl of reservoir (23-29% PEG 8000, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) finally resulted in more compact single crystals of ∼150 × 70 × 40 μm3. Cryo-cooled crystals (30% PEG 8000, 5% glycerol as cryoprotectant) allowed collection of a complete data set to 1.9 Å of resolution from 1 crystal at 100 K on the MPG/GBF wiggler beamline BW6/DORIS at DESY, Hamburg, Germany using a MAR CCD detector. Data were integrated and scaled using DENZO and SCALEPACK (28.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar).

Circular Dichroism and Differential Scanning Calorimetry—The thermostabilities of the different HLA-B27-peptide complexes and of free β2m were studied by CD and DSC measurements. A comparison of the CD melting profiles revealed that the subtype has a larger influence on the thermostability than the peptides tested here; the B*2709 complexes were considerably less stable than the B*2705 complexes (Fig. 1, A and B, and Table II). However, the peptides contributed to the distinct thermostabilities of the complexes as well. For both subtypes s10G resulted in the least stable complexes, s10R showed intermediate stability, whereas the complexes formed with m9 were the most stable ones. β2m melted with a Tm(CD) of 64 °C (Fig. 1A, Table II), a value that is similar to the peak position of the DSC excessive heat capacity curve (63.8 °C, see later in text) and also agrees with data from Bouvier and Wiley (7.Bouvier M.

More importantly, they suggest the presence of distinct unfolding pathways for the complexes formed by B*2705 and B*2709. The DSC melting profiles of B*2705·s10R and B*2705·m9 showed only one peak (Fig. 1D), whereas those of all three B*2709-peptide complexes and B2705·s10G showed two peaks (Fig. 1C). Therefore, the s10G peptide appears to change the unfolding behavior of the B*2705 subtype in such a way that it becomes similar to that of the three B*2709 complexes but is different from that of the other two B*2705 complexes. For β2m, a simple unfolding behavior was expected. β2m used in this study has a molecular mass of 11,862 Da, is composed of 100 amino acids, and folds into a stable domain containing exclusively β strands, which should unfold at a high temperature in a single two-state transition. For two-state transitions, the quotient κ of the experimental, calorimetric enthalpy change ΔHcal and the model-dependent, calculated van't Hoff enthalpy change ΔHvH, κ = ΔHvH/ΔHcal should be close to 1 (42.Privalov P.L. Adv. Protein Chem. 1979; 33: 167-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar), which in fact was confirmed for β2m (data not shown). To prove the reversibility of folding, β2m samples were cooled to 20 °C after the first run and heated again to 90 °C. About 70% of the initial enthalpy change was found in the second run, demonstrating refolding of a significant portion of β2m. In contrast to β2m, all HLA complexes investigated did not refold when cooled after the first run. The melting curves obtained in the second run showed the transition peak of β2m but no features of the complexes. In comparison to β2m, more complex patterns were expected for the thermally induced unfolding of the HLA-B27 molecules that consist of three chains (β2m, HC, and peptide), with the HC folded into two structural domains containing α helices and β strands. Dissociation of a given complex and melting of HC and β2m may occur simultaneously or sequentially, and HC domains could unfold in separate or interdependent transitions. Therefore, the observed excessive heat capacity profiles may result from several overlapping contributions that require deconvolution of experimental heat capacity profiles in order to extract more detailed information about the transitions occurring during thermal unfolding. The experimental excessive heat capacity curves of B*2709·s10R, B*2709·m9, and B2705·s10G were characterized by two partly overlapping peaks (Fig. 1C) with the melting temperature of the first peak significantly below that of β2m. Unfolding of B*2709·s10G started at an even lower temperature, resulting in two distant peaks separated by a pronounced shoulder at the high temperature side of the first peak. Deconvolution of the experimental profiles by applying the two-state routine of the ORIGIN software yielded two partly overlapping transitions for the low temperature peak (Tm1, ΔHm1 and Tm2, ΔHm2; see Table II) and one transition for the high temperature peak (Tm3, ΔHm3) (Fig. 1E). The single transition of the high temperature peak correlated with the melting of β2m as indicated by a comparison of the Tm3 and ΔHm3 values of B*2709·s10G, B*2709·s10R, B*2709·m9, and B*2705·s10G with that of β2m (Table II). The data evaluation suggests that melting of these complexes started by unfolding of two energetic domains of the HC (characterized by Tm1, Tm2 and ΔHm1, ΔHm2) and concomitant release of folded β2m, which melted at a significantly higher temperature (Tm3, ΔHm3). All three B*2709-peptide complexes as well as B*2705·s10G exhibited this unfolding behavior (Fig. 1C), with peptide- and subtype-dependent differences. Melting of B*2709·m9 did not significantly change (increase of Tm for ∼0.6 °C) in the presence of a 3-fold excess of free β2m (data not shown). In contrast, the melting profiles of B*2705·s10R and B2705·m9 were composed of single peaks (Fig. 1D) with a slight asymmetry toward the low temperature side. Deconvolution with the two-state ORIGIN routine yielded only two partly overlapping transitions, characterized by Tm1′, ΔHm1′ and Tm2′, ΔHm2′ (Fig. 1F). A correlation of these transitions with the melting of structural domains (HC and β2m) was not justified by the data. B*2705·s10R and B*2705·m9 melted at temperatures equal to (B*2705·s10R) or even higher (B*2705·m9) than that of β2m, indicating that dissociation of the complexes would inevitably be coupled to the unfolding of both HC and β2m. The total enthalpy changes ΔHtot connected with the melting of B*2705·m9 and B*2705·s10R were 316 and 259 kcal·mol-1, respectively, for the sum of the two transitions (Table II). They were only marginally larger than those obtained for the sums of the three transitions of B*2709·m9 and B*2709·s10R (303 and 246 kcal·mol-1, respectively). The low thermostability of B*2709·s10G correlates with a low enthalpy change (211 kcal·mol-1). For B*2705·s10G (326 kcal·mol-1), this was not the case, suggesting that the HLA melting transition is too complex to allow a direct comparison between the overall melting temperature and the overall enthalpy change. However, it must be stated that all three B*2705 complexes were significantly more thermostable than their B*2709 counterparts. Even the least stable B*2705 complex (B*2705·s10G) was slightly more stable than the most stable B*2709 complex (B*2709·m9). Structure Determination of B*2709·s10R—For a detailed understanding of the results from the CD and DSC measurements, it was important to determine the three-dimensional structure of at least one of the HLA-B27 subtypes in complex with a peptide featuring pArg1 a"

To re-assess the precise relationship between the different phosphorylations of CDK2, and the influence of cyclins and CDK inhibitors upon them, we introduce here the use of the high resolution power of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, combined to Tyr-15- or Thr-160-phosphospecific antibodies. The relative proportions of the potentially active forms of CDK2 (phosphorylated at Thr-160 but not Tyr-15) and inactive forms (non-phosphorylated, phosphorylated only at Tyr-15, or at both Tyr-15 and Thr-160), and their respective association with cyclin E, cyclin A, p21, and p27, were demonstrated during the mitogenic stimulation of normal human fibroblasts. Novel observations modify the current model of the sequential CDK2 activation process: (i) Tyr-15 phosphorylation induced by serum was not restricted to cyclin-bound CDK2; (ii) Thr-160 phosphorylation engaged the entirety of Tyr-15-phosphorylated CDK2 associated not only with a cyclin but also with p27 and p21, suggesting that Cip/Kip proteins do not prevent CDK2 activity by impairing its phosphorylation by CAK; (iii) the potentially active CDK2 phosphorylated at Thr-160 but not Tyr-15 represented a tiny fraction of total CDK2 and a minor fraction of cyclin A-bound CDK2, underscoring the rate-limiting role of Tyr-15 dephosphorylation by cdc25A.

The binding of a cyclin partner (cyclin E at the G1/S transition, cyclin A during the S phase) confers a low basal activity to the cyclin·CDK2 complex and enables subsequent phosphorylation of CDK2 by the CDK-activating kinase (CAK/cyclin H-CDK7) on a conserved threonine residue in the activation loop (Thr-160), which is essential for proper alignment of the kinase domain. Further phosphorylation within the ATP binding region of CDK2, at Tyr-15 by the Wee1 kinase and, to a lesser extent, at Thr-14 inhibits the kinase activity, which can be restored through dephosphorylation by the dual-specificity cdc25A phosphatase (25Nilsson I.

In human fibroblasts, low stoichiometry p21-binding was nevertheless found to support rather than prevent the catalytic activity of cyclin A·CDK2 complexes (31Zhang H. Hannon G.J. Beach D.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3882-3888Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The precise relationship between the different inhibitory and activating phosphorylations of CDK2, and the influence of cyclins and CDK inhibitors on these phosphorylations, have never been investigated in the context of endogenous proteins in a normal human cell. Here, we introduce the utilization of the high resolution power of the two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, combined to Tyr-15- or Thr-160-phosphospecific antibodies, to demonstrate the relative proportions of the different CDK2 phosphoforms and their respective association with cyclin E, cyclin A, p21 and p27, during the mitogenic stimulation of normal human diploid fibroblasts. Some unexpected observations prompt a re-evaluation of the accepted sequence of regulatory events involved in the complex activation process of CDK2. Cell Culture—Human diploid fibroblasts (IMR-90) (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were obtained at population doubling 24 and grown for not more than 40 total population doublings in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with antibiotics and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) as described previously (36Pagano M. Pepperkok R. Lukas J. Baldin V. Ansorge W. Bartek J. Draetta G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). After reaching semiconfluency, they were synchronized by starvation in 0.2% FCS for 3 days. Quiescent cells were then growth stimulated by addition of FCS (20%). Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) labeling of DNA-replicating cells was obtained at the end of the mitogenic stimulation by a 30-min incubation in the presence of 10-4m BrdUrd and detected as described (37Baptist M. Dumont J.E. Roger P.P. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 221: 160-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation—For the analysis of protein complexes, IMR-90 cells in 10-cm Petri dishes were washed with calcium/magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline and lysed on ice in 1 ml of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors (Pefabloc, leupeptin). The homogenized (glass/glass) cellular lysate was sonicated twice, pre-cleared with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden), and then incubated at 4 °C for 3 h with protein A-Sepharose, which had been preincubated overnight with 2 μg of antibody (monoclonal antibody against cyclin A (E72, NeoMarkers, Fremont, CA), rabbit polyclonal antibody against cyclin E (06-459, Upstate Inc., Charlottesville, VA), a mixture of the K25020 anti-p27 monoclonal antibody from BD Transduction Laboratories and the C-15 p27 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), the C-19 p21 polyclonal antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, or the DCS-11 cyclin D1 monoclonal antibody kindly provided by J. Bartek). Alternatively, for the analysis of the two-dimensional gel electrophoresis pattern of the whole population of CDK2, cells in 10-cm Petri dishes were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and scraped in 200 μl of denaturing lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.6% SDS, 10 mm DTT, 50 mm NaF, 100 μm vanadate, and protease inhibitors), boiled for 5 min, and frozen. Cell lysates containing 300-500 μg of protein were cleared by centrifugation and diluted by adding five volumes of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer without SDS (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 100 μm vanadate, and protease inhibitors). They were then subjected to immunoprecipitation as above, except that the M2 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used for CDK2. Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blotting—For two-dimensional gel electrophoresis separations, immunoprecipitated proteins were denatured in a buffer containing 7 m urea and 2 m thiourea. Proteins were separated by isoelectric focusing using the IPGphor apparatus from Amersham Biosciences and active in-gel rehydration as described (38Gorg A. Obermaier C. Boguth G. Harder A. Scheibe B. Wildgruber R. Weiss W. Electrophoresis. 2000; 21: 1037-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar) on immobilized linear pH gradient (pH 3-10) (IPG) strips (Amersham Biosciences). Isoelectric focusing was performed for a total of 30,000 Vh, starting at 200 V and gradually raising the voltage to 8000 V. The IPG strip was then equilibrated for 15 min in 50 mm Tris (pH 8.5), 6 m urea, 30% glycerol, 1% SDS, and 1% DTT, and for 15 min in 50 mm Tris, 6 m urea, 30% glycerol, 1% SDS, and 5% iodoacetamide before loading onto SDS-polyacrylamide slab gels (12.5%) for separation according to molecular mass. After transfer on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, CDK2 was immunodetected using the phosphospecific-CDK2/CDK1 (Thr-160 or Tyr-15) antibodies from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA) or the M2 polyclonal CDK2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); membranes detected with the phosphospecific antibodies were reprobed with the M2 polyclonal antibody for detection of total CDK2. In some cases, long exposures were required to detect minor phosphorylated forms of CDK2 from low abundance complexes, which markedly enhanced the appearance of diffuse “background” spots. These very characteristic spots were clearly nonspecific, because exactly the same spots were obtained when other polyclonal antibodies were used both for the immunoprecipitation and the immunodetection (e.g. CDK4 or p27 antibodies). In that case, to improve the visibility of the specific CDK2 spots, the program Adobe Photoshop was used to decrease the gray levels of the background spots in the respective figure panels (as indicated in the figure legends). Whole cell extract proteins were separated according to molecular mass on SDS-PAGE (7, 10 or 12%) and immunodetected after Western blotting. Equal amounts of protein were loaded for each condition. The phosphospecific and total CDK2 antibodies were as above. The JG39 cyclin A polyclonal antibody and the HE-12 cyclin E and MO.1.1 CDK7 monoclonal antibodies were kind gifts of Julian Gannon and Tim Hunt, and Jiri Bartek, respectively. The p21, p27, and p38 MAP kinase polyclonal antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and the cdc25A DCS-121 monoclonal antibody was from NeoMarkers (Fremont, CA). All the experiments were reproduced at least twice with identical results. CDK2 Phosphorylations and CDK2 Regulators during Mitogenic Stimulation of Human Fibroblasts—A maximum of DNA-synthesizing cells was observed 20 h after serum stimulation of quiescent IMR-90 cells (Fig. 1A). CDK2 and CDK2 regulatory proteins were analyzed from whole cell extracts from quiescent unstimulated (control, Cont) cells or from cells that were stimulated by serum for 16 h or 24 h, i.e. when a maximum of cells were in early S-phase or late S-phase/G2 phase, respectively (Fig. 1B). CDK2 was present in quiescent cells and gradually accumulated after stimulation. CDK2 activating (Thr-160) or inhibitory (Tyr-15) phosphorylations were detected using phosphospecific antibodies, which also recognize the corresponding Thr-161- or Tyr-15-phosphorylated forms of cdc2/CDK1 (Fig. 1B). The Thr-160 phosphorylation of CDK2 was already detected in quiescent cells and similarly increased after 16 and 24 h of stimulation, preceding the Thr-161 phosphorylation of cdc2 only observed at 24 h. By contrast, the Tyr-15 phosphorylation was almost undetectable in quiescent cells and appeared after cell stimulation on both CDK2 and cdc2, being maximum at 24 h. Cyclin E was detected in quiescent cells and was maximally expressed 16 h after serum stimulation. It thus preceded the accumulation of cyclin A, which was absent from quiescent cells and maximally expressed at 24 h. Like cyclin E, p21cip1 was present in quiescent cells and transiently enhanced 16 h after serum stimulation. By contrast, the presence of p27kip1 progressively decreased after cell stimulation. Cdc25A displayed several forms, which were increased or induced after serum stimulation. CDK7 was present in quiescent cells and slightly enhanced by serum stimulation. These different observations are in perfect agreement with previous reports from IMR-90 cells and other normal human fibroblasts (5Ohtsubo M. Theodoras A.M. Schumacher J. Roberts J.M. Pagano M. Mol.

A much smaller fraction of CDK2 was bound to p27. Serum increased not only the presence of cyclin E·CDK2 complexes, but also the association of CDK2 with p21 and p27 (Fig. 1C). Both the inhibitory Tyr-15 and activating Thr-160 phosphorylations of CDK2 were found not only in cyclin E·CDK2 complexes, but also in CDK2 bound to p21 or p27 (Fig. 1C). Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis Analysis of the Phosphorylation Pattern of Total CDK2—CDK2 was immunoprecipitated (using the M2 CDK2 antibody) from quiescent unstimulated cells (Cont) or cells stimulated by serum for 16 or 24 h, and its different forms were resolved by isoelectric focusing (pH 3-10 linear gradient) followed by SDS-PAGE and then detected by Western blotting using either the M2 CDK2 antibody, or the Thr-160 or Tyr-15 phosphospecific antibodies (Fig. 2). After immunodetection with the phosphospecific antibodies, membranes were systematically reprobed with the total CDK2 M2 antibody to ascertain the identity of the different forms and the homogeneity of the blotting transfer. In stimulated cells, multiple forms of CDK2 were distributed within an interval of 2.3 pH units (assuming the linearity of the supplied pH gradient gels) (Fig. 2). The most basic, and most abundant, form of CDK2 (form 0) focused at approximately pH 9, which is close to the calculated isoelectric point of human CDK2 (8.80; as calculated according to Ref. 42Bjellqvist B. Hughes G.J. Pasquali C. Paquet N. Ravier F. Sanchez J.C. Frutiger S. Hochstrasser D. Electrophoresis. 1993; 14: 1023-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar using the Compute Mw/pI tool provided by the ExPASy website). Besides CDK2 form 0, all the other forms of CDK2 were phosphorylated at Tyr-15 and/or Thr-160, as detected by the phosphospecific antibodies (Fig. 2). 2The most basic and most abundant CDK2 form 0 was therefore assumed to be unphosphorylated in agreement with (18Gu Y. Rosenblatt J. Morgan D.O. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3995-4005Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar), although this was not directly assessed in the present study. These different CDK2 phosphoforms focused at positions that roughly correspond to those predicted for the addition to CDK2 of entire numbers of negative charges (computed position scale at the bottom of Fig. 2, calculated according to Refs. 42Bjellqvist B. Hughes G.J. Pasquali C. Paquet N. Ravier F. Sanchez J.C. Frutiger S. Hochstrasser D. Electrophoresis. 1993; 14: 1023-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar and 43Sillero A. Ribeiro J.M. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). They were thus numbered according to their position relative to this scale (Fig. 2) and further identified by their demonstrated phosphorylation(s) (T, Thr-160; Y, Tyr-15; T,Y, Thr-160+Tyr-15). Considering that phosphate groups produce a two-charge isoelectric point shift above pH 7 (PO42-) or a one-charge shift below pH 6 (HPO4-) (43Sillero A. Ribeiro J.M. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 44Gianazza E. J. Chromatogr. A. 1995; 705: 67-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), CDK2 phosphoforms 2, 4, and 5/6 were expected to contain one, two, or three phosphorylations, respectively. The minor intermediate spots could be explained by a small proportion of phosphate group in the HPO4- form or by other enzymatic or non-enzymatic covalent modifications (44Gianazza E. J. Chromatogr. A. 1995; 705: 67-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Together, data on the isoelectric points and the detection by the phosphospecific antibodies allowed us to identify CDK2 forms 2T and 2Y as mono-phosphorylated at Thr-160 and Tyr-15, respectively; form 4T,Y as phosphorylated at both Thr-160 and Tyr-15; form 4Y as phosphorylated at Tyr-15 and presumably Thr-14; and minor forms 5T,Y and 6T,Y as 3-fold phosphorylated at Thr-160, Tyr-15, and presumably Thr-14. This determination is in perfect agreement with a previous investigation of CDK2 phosphorylations by 32Pi incorporation, tryptic peptide, and mutagenesis analyses (18Gu Y. Rosenblatt J. Morgan D.O. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3995-4005Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar), which did not detect any other important phosphorylations, and demonstrated that the major phosphorylated sites are Tyr-15 and Thr-160, whereas the Thr-14 phosphorylation is restricted to a fraction of Tyr-15-phosphorylated CDK2. An identical two-dimensional gel electrophoresis pattern of CDK2 was obtained from primary cultures of canine thyroid epithelial cells (not shown), indicating that the present identification of CDK2 phosphoforms might apply to a wide variety of systems. In control quiescent IMR-90 cells, CDK2 was essentially not phosphorylated. 2The most basic and most abundant CDK2 form 0 was therefore assumed to be unphosphorylated in agreement with (18Gu Y. Rosenblatt J. Morgan D.O. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3995-4005Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar), although this was not directly assessed in the present study. Only a small proportion of mono-Thr-160-phosphorylated CDK2 was detected (Fig. 2). The inhibitory Tyr-15 phosphorylation was induced by serum and was mostly represented by the mono-phosphorylated 2Y form. Smaller proportions of twice phosphorylated CDK2 forms containing either both the Tyr-15 and Thr-160 phosphorylations (form 4T,Y) or the Tyr-15 phosphorylation but not the Thr-160 phosphorylation (form 4Y, putatively containing the Thr-14 phosphorylation), were also observed 16 h and even more 24 h after serum stimulation (Fig. 2). In control quiescent cells, the detection of a trace of the twice phosphorylated 4T,Y form required long exposures of the blots (Fig. 2). The activating Thr-160 phosphorylation was also strongly increased by serum stimulation. Surprisingly, it was essentially associated with Tyr-15 phosphorylation (4Y,T and other minor Y,T forms). The potentially active mono-Thr-160-phosphorylated form (2T) thus represented only a small fraction of Thr-160-phosphorylated CDK2 and an extremely minor fraction of total CDK2 (Fig. 2). Phosphorylations of Cyclin E-bound CDK2—Phosphospecific and total CDK2 antibodies were applied to two-dimensional gel separations from cyclin E co-immunoprecipitations (Fig. 3). In control quiescent cells, the twice Thr-160+Tyr-15-phosphorylated forms were the only CDK2 forms associated with cyclin E, as detected after long exposures of the blots. This complex should be present at a very low abundance, because the 4T,Y CDK2 form was faintly detectable only after long blot exposures from total CDK2 immunoprecipitations (Fig. 2). 16 h after serum stimulation, when cyclin E was maximally expressed (Fig. 1B), cyclin E-bound CDK2 was represented by non-phosphorylated CDK2 (form 0),2 mono-Thr-160-phosphorylated CDK2 (form 2T) and Thr-160+Tyr-15-phosphorylated CDK2 (form 4T,Y) (Fig. 3). In sharp contrast with the situation observed in total CDK2 (Fig. 2), the most abundant cyclin E-bound CDK2 form was the potentially active mono-Thr-160-phosphorylated one, and the Tyr-15 phosphorylation was only observed in association with the Thr-160 phosphorylation (Fig. 3). The CDK2 forms phosphorylated at Tyr-15 but not Thr-160 observed in total CDK2 (the abundant 2Y and minor 4Y forms in Fig. 2) were undetectable from cyclin E complexes (Fig. 3). Phosphorylations of Cyclin A-bound CDK2—In the present experiments, cyclin A was absent from control quiescent cells and maximally expressed 24 h after serum stimulation (Fig. 1B). The phosphorylations of cyclin A-bound CDK2 were thus only analyzed at this time point (Fig. 4). At variance with total CDK2 and cyclin E·CDK2 complexes, almost no unphosphorylated CDK2 was associated with cyclin A (Fig. 4). Although a small proportion of mono-Tyr-15-phosphorylated CDK2 (2Y) was detected, the immense majority of Tyr-15 phosphorylation was associated with the Thr-160 phosphorylation in cyclin A complexes (Fig. 4). The potentially active mono-Thr-160-phosphorylated form (2T, 1T) represented only a minor fraction of cyclin A-bound CDK2 (Fig. 4), in contrast to cyclin E·CDK2 complexes where this form was the most abundant one (Fig. 3). Phosphorylations of p21-bound CDK2—A large fraction of CDK2 was associated with p21 as judged from comparisons of CDK2 amounts (co)precipitated by p21 and CDK2 antibodies (Fig. 1C). At variance with cyclin E/A·CDK2 complexes, p21-bound CDK2 was clearly observed both in quiescent control and serum-stimulated IMR-90 cells (Fig. 5, A and B). Moreover, it was predominantly represented by the unphosphorylated 0 form, even in serum-stimulated cells (Fig. 5B). In control cells, the small proportion of Thr-160 phosphorylation seen in p21 complexes (Fig. 5, A and B) was similar to what was observed in total CDK2 (Fig. 2). Some p21·CDK2 complexes should thus exist without being associated with cyclin"

The goal of the present study was to examine the apoptotic effects of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on fibroblastic cells and to investigate the role that the host response plays in this reaction. This was accomplished in vivo by subcutaneous inoculation of LPS in wild type and TNFR1-/-R2-/- mice. The direct effects of LPS on fibroblast apoptosis was studied in vitro with normal diploid human fibroblasts. The results indicate that LPS in vivo induces apoptosis of fibroblasts. By RNA profiling we demonstrated that LPS stimulates global expression of apoptotic genes and down-regulates anti-apoptotic genes. Fluorometric studies demonstrated that LPS in vivo significantly increased caspase-8 and caspase-3 activity and by use of specific inhibitors, the activation of caspase-3 was shown to be initiated by caspase-8 with no contribution from caspase-9. In vitro studies demonstrated that LPS did not induce apoptosis of fibroblasts, whereas tumor necrosis factor (TNF) did. In addition, the pattern of apoptotic gene expression induced by TNF in vitro was nearly identical to that induced by LPS in vivo, as measured by RNase protection assay. Moreover, pre-treatment of cells with TNF greatly enhanced apoptosis induced by a second stimulation with TNF 24 h later, suggesting that the global induction of pro-apoptotic genes was functionally significant. Thus, LPS acts to modulate the expression of a large number of genes that favor apoptosis of fibroblastic cells that is dependent upon activation of caspase-8 and is largely mediated by TNF.

Tissue can be injured by a wide variety of conditions, including oxygen deprivation, physical trauma, chemical agents, and infectious microbes.

However, it has been reported that LPS directly induces apoptosis in hepatocytes, ventricular myocytes, and endothelial cells (23Nakama T. Hirono S. Moriuchi A. Hasuike S. Nagata K. Hori T. Ido A.

Rano T. Peterson E. Rasper D. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V. Nordstrom P. Roy S. Vaillancourt J. Chapman K. Nicholson D. J. Biol.

Caspases are produced as pro-enzymes and become activated by proteolytic cleavage at internal aspartate residues upon apoptotic stimulation. Two categories of caspases important for apoptosis have been recognized: the initiators and executioner caspases. The initiator caspases, such as caspase-8 and -9, are activated in the earlier phase of apoptosis; the executioner caspases, such as caspase-3, are activated by initiator caspases and are responsible for dismantling cells (31Green D.

To address this important topic, we undertook in vitro and in vivo studies. In vivo studies were carried out by subcutaneous injection of LPS into the connective tissue in the scalp. The results indicate that LPS in vivo induces apoptosis in fibroblasts. We demonstrated that LPS can stimulate a global expression of 37 apoptotic genes and down-regulation of several anti-apoptotic genes. LPS in vivo stimulated activation of caspase-3 through the action of caspase-8 but not caspase-9. Moreover, the apoptotic effect of LPS was largely mediated through TNFR1 signaling. Unlike reports for other cell types, LPS did not directly induce apoptosis of fibroblasts. However, TNF stimulated pro-apoptotic events in fibroblasts in vitro that were virtually identical to LPS-stimulated events in vivo.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimals—There were two separate groups of experimental and matched wild type mice as follows: 1) TNFR1-/-R2-/- mice and matched wild type F2 C57BL/6 × 129 and 2) mice deficient in TNFR1 (TNFR1-/-) or TNFR2 (TNFR2-/-) and matched wild type C57BL/6J mice. Mice were purchased from Jackson laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). All procedures involving mice were approved by the Boston University Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.Injection of LPS—Purified Escherichia coli serotype 0111:B4 LPS was purchased from List Biologicals (Campbell, CA). Mice were anesthetized with injection of ketamine (80 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). LPS was inoculated adjacent to the periosteum at a point on the midline of the skull located between the ears. Injection at this anatomic site can be reproducibly achieved and leads to an inflammatory response in the loose connective tissue, which consists primarily of fibroblasts. For each data point, there were 6 mice (n = 6). We undertook preliminary experiments to identify a dose for LPS that gave a moderate number of apoptotic cells. Thus, 200 μg of LPS or equal volume of vehicle alone, PBS (50 μl) were injected. Mice were euthanized 6 and 24 h following injection. In addition to LPS, some animals were treated by intraperitoneal injection if caspase-8 or -9 inhibitor (1 mg/kg) 1 h before LPS injection and locally (25 μg) at the time of LPS injection. The caspase-8 inhibitor, z-Ile-Glu(OMe)-Thr-Asp(OMe) fluoromethylketone and caspase-9 inhibitor, z-Leu-Glu(OMe)-His-Asp(OMe) fluoromethylketone were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Control mice received vehicle alone, sterile PBS containing 2% Me2SO (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO).Preparation of Histologic Sections—Animals were euthanized by decapitation, and their heads were fixed for 72 h in cold 4% paraformaldehyde, decalcified by incubation of cold Immunocal (Decal Corp., Congers, NY) for ∼12 days, with solution changed daily. Paraffin-embedded sagittal sections were prepared at a thickness of 5-6 μm.Immunohistochemistry and TUNEL Assay—Apoptotic cells were detected by an in situ TUNEL assay by means of a TACS 2 TdT-Blue Label kit purchased from Trevigen (Gaithersburg, MD), following the manufacturer's instructions. Apoptotic cells were detected by TACS Blue Label and counterstained with Red C. In some experiments apoptotic fibroblasts were identified by combining the TUNEL assay with immunohistochemistry. In these experiments, the TUNEL assay was performed as described above. Following TACS Blue Label, sections were incubated with polyclonal goat anti-vimentin (Cortex Biochem, San Leandro, CA). Primary antibody was localized by the avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase method using a kit from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). The signal was enhanced by tyramide signal amplification using a kit from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Boston, MA).Quantitative Histologic Analysis—The number of fibroblastic apoptotic cells was determined in the standard TUNEL assay by their characteristic microscopic appearance as we have previously described (39Graves D. Oskoui M. Volejnikova S. Naguib G. Cai S. Desta T. Kakouras A. Jiang Y. J. Dent. Res. 2001; 80: 1875-1879Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The values were verified by double labeling. In the latter, cells counted were both vimentin-positive and TUNEL-positive. Counts and measurements were confirmed by re-analysis of all the specimens by one other independent examiner. The intra- and inter-examiner variation was less than 10%. Student's t test was used to determine significant differences between the experimental and control groups at the p < 0.05 level.RNA Extraction—Following sacrifice at the indicated time points, the scalps of mice were immediately dissected from the calvaria and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol (Invitrogen, Rockville, MD) from pulverized frozen tissue, following the manufacturer's instructions. The concentration and integrity of the extracted RNA were verified by denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis.RNase Protection Assay—32P-Labeled riboprobes were incubated with 10 μg of total RNA and then subjected to RNase digestion using a kit from BD Pharmingen (Franklin Lakes, NJ), following the manufacturer's instructions. Following electrophoresis on a 6% polyacrylamide gel, radiolabeled bands were visualized with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). The optical density of the protected bands was measured with Image ProPlus Software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD), which was then normalized by the value of GAPDH in the same lane. Three separate RNase protection assays were performed with similar results. Student's t test was used to determine significant differences between the experimental and control groups.Microarray—The Mouse Apoptosis GEArray Q series kit, which includes 96 key genes involved in apoptosis, was purchased from SuperArray, Inc. (Bethesda, MD). Total RNA was used as the template for 32P-labeled cDNA probe synthesis following the manufacturer's instructions. Following overnight hybridization with labeled probe, the GEArray membranes were exposed using a PhosphorImager. The resulting digital image was converted to raw data file using Scanalyze software (www.microarray.org/software.html). GEArray Analyzer software (SuperArray Inc.) was used for data analysis. Each experiment was performed twice with similar results, and the mean values of the two experiments are presented for each gene. The duplicate results for each gene was within 7% of the mean for that gene.Caspases Activities—Caspases activities were assayed by a fluorometric kit purchased from R&D Systems. Briefly, following sacrifice at the indicated time points, murine scalps were immediately dissected from the calvaria and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen tissues were pulverized, and lysates were prepared using cell lysis buffer provided by R&D Systems. Following centrifugation total protein was quantitated using a BCA Protein Assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Caspase-3 activity was detected by using the specific caspase-3 fluorogenic substrate, DEVD peptide conjugated to 7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin (AFC). Caspase-8 activity was detected by using the specific caspase-8 fluorogenic substrate, IETD-AFC. Caspase-9 activity was detected by using the specific caspase-9 fluorogenic substrate, LEHD-AFC. Measurements were made on a fluorescent microplate reader using filters for excitation (400 nm) and detection of emitted light (505 nm). In some assays, recombinant caspase-3 enzyme (R&D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN) was used as a positive control. Buffers without cell lysate and cell lysate without substrate were used as negative controls.Cell Culture—Human adult dermal fibroblasts were purchased from Cambrex (Walkersville, MD). Cells were propagated and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cambrex Co.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, Gentamicin (100 μg/ml), and Amphotericin B (100 ng/ml) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. TNF-α was purchased from R&D Systems Inc. Experiments with TNF-α were performed in culture medium supplemented with 0.5% fetal bovine serum. Assays were performed when the cultures reached 75-85% confluent. Expression of apoptotic genes was measured as described above following extraction of total RNA with TRIzol. Apoptosis of fibroblasts was determined by measuring histone-associated DNA fragments (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) following the manufacturer's instructions. In some experiments cells were pre-treated with TNF-α to allow for induction of apoptotic genes and then stimulated a second time to induce apoptosis. In these studies, 20,000 fibroblasts/cm2 were pre-treated with TNF-α (20 ng/ml) for 24 h. Control cells were plated identically but not pre-treated with TNF-α. Viable cells were then trypsinized and replated at 20,000 fibroblasts/cm2 based upon trypan-blue dye exclusion counts (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). These cells were then incubated in culture medium supplemented with 0.5% serum or 0.5% serum plus TNF-α (10 ng/ml) for 24 h. Apoptosis was determined by ELISA and in corresponding wells, the cell number was assessed to normalize apoptosis measurements.RESULTSBased upon preliminary studies, it was determined that 200 μg of LPS produced a moderate inflammatory response with apoptosis of fibroblastic cells. The induction of apoptosis following LPS inoculation was measured by the TUNEL assay. When vehicle alone was injected, few apoptotic cells with clearly denoted blue nuclei were detected. Apoptosis of fibroblasts was confirmed by cells that were double positive by the TUNEL assay and simultaneously for expression of the mesenchymal cell marker, vimentin (Fig. 1A). Based on quantitative analysis of double-stained histologic sections LPS induced a statistically significant 8-fold level at 6 h and a 14-fold increase at 24 h in apoptotic fibroblastic cells compared with the vehicle alone injection (p < 0.05) (Fig. 1B).In Vivo Effect of LPS on Expression of Apoptotic Genes—To study pathways that might be modulated by LPS at the level of gene expression, microarrays were carried out (Table I). Gene expression was categorized into six groups based upon their function in apoptosis. LPS increased mRNA levels of apoptosis-inducing ligands 130% to 250% (TNF, TRAIL, FasL, CD40L, CD30L, CD27L, and OX40L). The expression of TNF receptors family increased 139% to 460% (TNFR2, TNFR1, CD30, CD40, Fas, and OX40). The expression of pro-apoptotic members of Bcl-2 family increased 160% to 230% (Bax, Bak, Bad, Bid, and Blk), whereas the expression of anti-apoptotic genes decreased 50-64% (Bcl-x, Bcl-2, and Mcl-1). The expression of initiator caspases (caspases 2, 8, and 9) and effector caspases (caspases 3, 6, and 7) increased 170% to 260%. The expression of death domain family of proteins such as FADD and CRADD and some of the TRAF family (TRAF2 and TRAF5) increased 170% to 300%. LPS also increased by 270% the expression of Apaf-1, which participates in the cytochrome c-dependent activation of caspase-3, and the cell cycle regulator, p53, which is also pro-apoptotic, by 410%. Thus, LPS acted in a global way to enhance the expression of genes that promote apoptosis ranging from ligands to caspases or diminished those that inhibited apoptosis. Out of 96 genes examined that regulate apoptosis, the expression of 37 pro-apoptotic genes was increased by more than 100% following LPS inoculation. For each family of apoptotic genes there were some members whose expression were not modulated by more than 100% following LPS stimulation. These genes are summarized in Table II. Only anti-apoptotic genes of the Bcl-2 family exhibited decreased expression by 50%. The validity of the microarray results was confirmed by RNase protection assay as described below.Table IMicroarray analysis of apoptotic gene expression in wild type miceGroupGeneRelative density24-h (PBS)24-h (LPS)LigandsTNF0.07621230.2703511Trail0.06043280.2062432OX40L0.02740640.0642597CD40L0.03111900.0808486FasL0.06092190.2114744CD27L0.03453960.1123756CD30L0.02878300.06867454-IBBL0.03583270.1009014Tnfsf120.03399730.0922414LTα0.06393160.1638631ReceptorsTNFR20.16534050.5946992TNFR10.21371361.2135135CD270.06924600.1973663CD400.03182810.1073197Fas0.11916990.4239561OX400.02269270.0542604Tnfrsf90.03583270.1061401MitochondrialBax0.04198350.1102827Bak0.03906350.1253460Bad0.03290010.1082736Bid0.03736620.1127503Bcl-x0.40321560.1471590Bcl-20.36475540.1775225Mcl-10.58016480.2383997Blk0.03542980.1079074CaspasesCasp10.04146420.1166716Casp20.07860350.2840260Casp30.06548750.2143876Casp60.05850930.1922933Casp70.07070600.2039648Casp80.09464700.3136114Casp90.06870370.1871880Casp110.03483160.1061039AdaptorsTRAF20.09239750.3753525TRAF50.07154030.2588839TRAF60.13757430.3732116Apaf-10.03937850.1443492FADD0.07103970.2591018CRADD0.10966420.3704377Othersp530.06920430.3525590XIAP0.03725830.0905102Bar-like0.03950360.1284657Hus10.10149130.2507850Cide A0.05691830.1537364 Open table in a new tab Table IIList of apoptotic genes with less than 2-fold change in expression, 24 h after LPS injection in wild type miceFamilyGenes not induced by LPSFraction of gene family not induced by more than 100%TNF ligand familyTnfsf11, Tnfsf142/13TNF receptor familyTnfrsf8, Tnfrsf10b, Tnfrsf11a, Tnfrsf11b, Tnfrsf12, April, Dr67/15Bcl-2 familyBcl2a1d, Bcl2110, Bcl212, Bokl, Bid3, Bim, Biklk, Bnip38/16Caspase familyCasp12, Casp142/10IAP familyBirc1a, Birc1b, Birc1d, Birc1e, Birc2, Birc3, Birc5, Birc68/9TRAF familyTraf1, Traf3, Traf4, Traip, Tank5/8CARD familyAsc, Arc, BCL10, Nop30-like4/5Death domain familyMyd88, Rpik1, Dapk2, Daxx4/6Death effector domain familyCash, Casp8ap22/3CIDE domain familyDffa, Dffb, Cideb3/4p53 and ATM pathwayCdkn1a, Mdm2, Gadd45a, Atm, Rpa-like, chek 1, Rad536/9 Open table in a new tab Direct Effect of LPS on Fibroblast Apoptosis in Vitro—To identify mechanisms through which LPS induced apoptosis, the direct effects of LPS were measured in vitro. Apoptosis of human adult primary fibroblasts was measured by the relative amount of histone-associated DNA fragments in the cytoplasm as determined by ELISA (Table III). Stimulation with LPS had no effect on fibroblast apoptosis. Because many of the genes identified in Table I are involved in TNF receptor signaling, the effect of TNF on fibroblast apoptosis was examined. TNF induced a dose-dependent increase in fibroblast apoptosis. At an optimal concentration, TNF (20 ng/ml) increased fibroblast apoptosis 350%.Table IIIInduction of fibroblast apoptosis by LPS or TNFLPSIncreased apoptosis after LPS stimulationIncreased apoptosis after TNF stimulationTNFng/ml%ng/ml00000.17 ± 5264 ± 101013 ± 2350 ± 1020105 ± 2325 ± 30401005 ± 1345 ± 206010006 ± 2481 ± 3080 Open table in a new tab Effect of LPS in Expression of Apoptotic Genes in TNFR1-/-R2-/-Mice—Given the capacity of TNF but not LPS to induce fibroblast apoptosis directly, the possibility that TNF-mediated LPS-induced fibroblast apoptosis in vivo was measured (Fig. 2).

LPS induced a statistically significant 5-fold increase at 6 h and a 7-fold increase at 24 h in apoptotic fibroblastic cells in wild type mice compared with TNF receptor-ablated mice (p < 0.05). Almost all of the LPS-induced apoptosis in fibroblasts can be accounted for by TNF. Similar results were obtained when TUNEL-positive fibroblasts were identified simultaneously by vimentin immunostaining.Fig. 2Quantitative analysis of LPS-induced apoptosis of fibroblastic cells in TNFR1-/-R2-/- mice.

https://openalex.org/W2146099779,"The protein TA0175 has a large number of sequence homologues, most of which are annotated as unknown and a few as belonging to the haloacid dehalogenase superfamily, but has no known biological function. Using a combination of amino acid sequence analysis, three-dimensional crystal structure information, and kinetic analysis, we have characterized TA0175 as phosphoglycolate phosphatase from Thermoplasma acidophilum. The crystal structure of TA0175 revealed two distinct domains, a larger core domain and a smaller cap domain. The large domain is composed of a centrally located five-stranded parallel β-sheet with strand order S10, S9, S8, S1, S2 and a small β-hairpin, strands S3 and S4. This central sheet is flanked by a set of three α-helices on one side and two helices on the other. The smaller domain is composed of an open faced β-sandwich represented by three antiparallel β-strands, S5, S6, and S7, flanked by two oppositely oriented α-helices, H3 and H4. The topology of the large domain is conserved; however, structural variation is observed in the smaller domain among the different functional classes of the haloacid dehalogenase superfamily. Enzymatic assays on TA0175 revealed that this enzyme catalyzed the dephosphorylation of phosphoglycolate in vitro with similar kinetic properties seen for eukaryotic phosphoglycolate phosphatase. Activation by divalent cations, especially Mg2+, and competitive inhibition behavior with Cl- ions are similar between TA0175 and phosphoglycolate phosphatase.

Acid hydrolases are ubiquitous enzymes that catalyze a diverse array of reactions such as phosphate hydrolysis and phosphoryl transfer. Acid hydrolases belong to the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) 1The abbreviations used are: HAD, haloacid dehalogenase; pNPP, p-nitrophenyl phosphate; PSP, phosphoserine phosphatase; SBC, Structural Biology Center; SeMet, selenomethionine; TA, Thermoplasma acidophilum; DALI, distance matrix alignment. superfamily, which includes l-2-haloacid dehalogenase, epoxide hydrolase, phosphoserine phosphatase, phosphomannomutase, phosphoglycolate phosphatase, and P-type ATPase, all of which utilize a nucleophilic aspartate in their phosphoryl transfer reaction. HAD superfamily proteins with different catalytic activities have low sequence identity, less than 14%; however, they are characterized by the following three conserved sequence motifs: motif I, DX(D/T/Y)X(T/V)(L/V); motif II, (S/T); and motif III, K(G/S)(D/S)XXX(D/N) (1.Aravind L. Galperin M.Y. Koonin E.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 127-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 2.Collet J.F. Stroobant V. Pirard M. Delpierre G. Van Schaftingen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14107-14112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Motif I is the most conserved; only subtle variations in this motif are observed for different functional classes of the HAD superfamily. In motif I, the first Asp, which is conserved in all HAD family members, is the functional nucleophile (2.Collet J.F. Stroobant V. Pirard M. Delpierre G. Van Schaftingen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14107-14112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). This nucleophile becomes phosphorylated and is directly involved in the phosphoryl transfer reaction. The second Asp is found in all phosphotransferases and phosphatases but is replaced by a Thr in P-type ATPases and by a Tyr in dehalogenases (2.Collet J.F. Stroobant V. Pirard M. Delpierre G. Van Schaftingen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14107-14112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). This Asp residue partakes both in the acid-base catalysis reaction and in the phosphorylation of the first Asp of motif I. Motif II contains a conserved serine or threonine that hydrogen bonds to the phosphoryl oxygen of the substrate and helps to orient it for the nucleophilic attack (3.Wang W. Kim R. Jancarik J. Yokota H. Kim S.H. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 65-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The conserved residues, except lysine, from motif III interact with an active site divalent metal (in most cases Mg2+) and are essential for activity (3.Wang W. Kim R. Jancarik J. Yokota H. Kim S.H. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 65-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 4.Collet J.F. Stroobant V. Van Schaftingen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33985-33990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The conserved lysine interacts with the phosphoaspartate intermediate, which results in the stabilization of its phosphorylated state. This lysine, although intimately involved in the catalytic mechanism, is located far away in primary sequence from the conserved sequence DXXXD in motif III and is located on a different secondary structure element in the protein. Crystal structures of proteins from the HAD superfamily include 2-haloacid dehalogenase, phosphonoacetaldehyde hydrolase, Ca2+-ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum, and phosphoserine phosphatase (3.Wang W.

These proteins all share a conserved α/β-domain classified as a hydrolase fold, which is similar to the Rossmann fold. Residues from the conserved sequence motifs are also conserved at the tertiary level as shown from the crystal structures of the proteins for this superfamily. TA0175 was selected for structural studies as part of our structural proteomic project because it did not have a structural homologue and was annotated as “unknown” in the genome data base. Multiple sequence analysis using the non-redundant amino acid sequence data base identified more than 50 similar proteins with sequence identities ranging from 75 to 22%, none of which had a known biological function. However, a subset of these proteins were annotated as “putative hydrolase,” and they all contained the three conserved motifs observed for the HAD superfamily, which suggested that TA0175 is a potential acid hydrolase. As stated above, this family comprises a number of different enzymes; it is impossible to determine the catalytic function from sequence analysis because there is low sequence conservation among these different functional classes of proteins. Here we demonstrate how the three-dimensional crystal structure, when combined with sequence and biochemical analysis, led to the functional annotation of TA0175 as phosphoglycolate phosphatase. Cloning, Protein Expression, and Purification—The TA0175 gene (GenBank™ accession number gi 16081332) was cloned from genomic Thermoplasma acidophilum (TA) DNA, and its gene product was expressed, selenomethionine (SeMet)-labeled, and purified from a bacterial system using the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity procedure as described elsewhere for Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum proteins (9.Christendat D. Saridakis V. Dharamsi A. Bochkarev A. Pai E.F. Arrowsmith C.H. Edwards A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24608-24612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Screening for crystallization conditions was also performed as described elsewhere for M. thermoautotrophicum proteins (9.Christendat D. Saridakis V. Dharamsi A. Bochkarev A. Pai E.F. Arrowsmith C.H. Edwards A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24608-24612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Crystallization experiments were conducted using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at room temperature, 296 K. The final crystallization condition consisted of 22% polyethylene glycol 3350 as the precipitant, 0.2 m calcium chloride (CaCl2), and sodium HEPES at pH 7.5. The crystals chosen for x-ray data collection were flash frozen in this buffer containing 12% glycerol, which acted as cryoprotectant. The morphology of the single crystals is rods with maximum dimensions of 0.3 × 0.1 × 0.4 mm3. X-ray Diffraction and Structure Determination—Crystals of the TA0175 belong to the orthorhombic space group I222 with unit cell dimensions a = 88.2, b = 99.2, c = 113.8 Å, α = β = γ = 90°. Multiwavelength anomalous dispersion data were collected on SBC-2, a 3 × 3 charged coupled device detector built at Advanced Photon Source, to 1.7-Å resolution from a single crystal containing SeMet-labeled protein at three different wavelengths (peak, inflection, and high remote) near the selenium edge (Table I). The native data were collected to 1.4 Å and used for the later stages of the refinement of the protein structure. All diffraction data were collected at 100 K at the 19ID beamline of the Structural Biology Center at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. The multiwavelength anomalous dispersion and native data were processed using the HKL2000 suite of programs (10.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). Data collection statistics are presented in Table I. Both multiwavelength anomalous dispersion phasing and phase improvement by density modification were done using CNS version 1.0 software (11.Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P.

Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar). The initial protein model was autotraced using ARP/wARP at 1.7 Å (12.Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2564) Google Scholar). The initial refinement was made against the data collected at the peak wavelength of selenium, up to 1.7 Å, by several rounds of CNS refinements consisting of B-group, minimize (or anneal), and water pick steps. After every round of refinement, the model was manually adjusted using both 2 Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc difference electron density maps followed by individual B-factor refinement. The annealing step used in the refinement includes the simulated annealing with torsion angle dynamics and starting temperature of 5000 K. The water picking was done using the following criteria: a peak of at least 3.0 σ in the Fo - Fc difference map with acceptable bonding distance in the range of 2.0–5.0 Å with other atoms. In the later stages of the refinement, individual B-factor refinement steps were also included which gave R of 0.224 and free R of 0.246. The final refinements were done with the native data collected to 1.4 Å using the same refinement procedure as above. The final R is 0.171 with the free R of 0.195. All refinements were done using CNS version 1.0, and electron density visualization and model building were done with the software package O (13.Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M.

Gilon H. Blumenthal A.B. Sedat J.W. Exp. Cell Res. 1982; 142: 141-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Phosphoglycolate phosphatase activity was determined as described by Rose et al. (18.Rose Z.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 208: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) except that bovine serum albumin was omitted. Phosphatase activity with phosphorylated substrates was determined spectrophotometrically using reaction mixtures (0.8-ml final volume) containing 50 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.5), 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 μm substrate, and 0.15–1.0 μg of TA0175. After a 10-min incubation at 70 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.2 ml of Malachite Green reagent (19.Baykov A.A. Evtushenko O.A. Avaeva S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 171: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar), and after 10 min at room temperature the absorbance at 630 nm was measured. Kinetic parameters were determined by non-linear curve fitting using the saturation kinetic equation v = (Vmax[S])/(Km + [S]). Saturation plots and kinetic parameters were obtained with the software package GraphPad Prism®. Amino Acid Sequence Analysis—A position-specific iterative BLAST (PSI-BLAST) sequence analysis of TA0175 with other non-redundant amino acid sequences in the protein data base identified more than 50 bacterial proteins that are functionally annotated as hypothetical, conserved, or unknown. A small subset, fewer than 10 proteins, were tentatively classified as belonging to the HAD superfamily of hydrolases. All of these proteins share between 76 and 22% of sequence identity with TA0175 with the three sequence motifs observed in the HAD superfamily being strictly conserved among these proteins (Fig. 1). A detailed sequence analysis of these proteins revealed that their primary sequences were all submitted to the data bases by genomic sequencing projects. Therefore, neither genetic nor functional analysis had been performed for this homologous group of proteins. Further sequence analysis revealed that TA0175 belongs to the cluster of orthologous families of proteins (COG0561) called hydrolases and more specifically to a glycosyltransferase subgroup. The sequences of the 30 proteins with highest similarity to TA0175 were aligned with ClustalW. This analysis revealed strict conservation of motif I, DhDGTh, where h is any hydrophobic residue for this class of hydrolases (Fig. 1). Oligomeric Structure—Gel filtration analysis revealed that purified TA0175 is a homodimer. This is consistent with our observation from this crystallization study where we observed two molecules of TA0175 in each crystallographic asymmetric unit. The dimer is related by a pseudo-two-fold symmetry, which forms an elongated barrel. Helices H4 and H6 from each monomer contribute to the base of this structural barrel, and helix H5 is found in the middle of this barrel at the subunit interface. The approximate dimensions of dimeric TA0175 are 55 × 44 × 60 Å (Fig. 2). The root mean square deviation between the two subunits is 0.53Å over 223 α carbon atoms spanning the entire molecule. Structure Overview—TA0175 is composed of two distinct domains, a larger “core” domain, comprising the α/β hydrolase fold, and a smaller “cap” domain. The core domain is composed of a centrally located five-stranded parallel β-sheet with strand order S10, S9, S8, S1, S2 and a small β-hairpin, strands S3 and S4. The β-sheet is flanked by three α-helices on the convex side and by two α-helices on the concave side of the barrel. On the concave side, the loop L5 connecting β-strands S8 and S9 contains a 9-residue stretch (residues 177–185) assuming a pseudo-α-helix (closely mimicking an α-helix). This arrangement of secondary structure in the core domain, involving the six parallel β-strands (S10, S9, S8, S1, S2, and S3) and the six helices including the pseudo-α-helix in the concave side, is similar to that observed for other proteins belonging to the HAD superfamily, phosphoserine phosphatase (PSP) and YrbI from Haemophilus influenzae (3.Wang W. Kim R. Jancarik J. Yokota H. Kim S.H. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 65-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 20.Parsons J.F. Lim K. Tempczyk A. Krajewski W. Eisenstein E. Herzberg O. Proteins. 2002; 46: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Such secondary organization is also observed for the core domain of CheB, a bacterial response regulator (21.West A.H. Martinez-Hackert E. Stock A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 276-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The core domain is disrupted by the insertion of a small α/β-domain (cap domain). The disruption of the core domain extends from residue 50 to residue 168 between strand S4 and helix H5. The insertion is an open faced β-sandwich represented by three antiparallel β-strands, S5, S6, and S7, and two oppositely oriented α-helices, H3 and H4 (Fig. 2). The first helix, H3, precedes strand S5, and the second helix, H4, is followed by strands S6 and S7, which form a β-hairpin. The electrostatic surface analysis of a subunit of this protein revealed a relatively acidic surface (Fig. 2). Interestingly the active site of this protein is lined with acidic residues and is continuous as a channel through the monomer. This high localization of acidic residues in the active site is consistent with those observed for other acid phosphatases. Structure Comparison—Structural analysis of TA0175 was done by comparing its coordinates with those of other proteins in the Protein Data Bank using the DALI algorithm. The closest structural matches to TA0175 are PSP, YrbI, phosphonoacetaldehyde hydrolase, calcium-transporting ATPase from sarcoplasmic reticulum, l-2-haloacid dehalogenase, and epoxide hydrolase (3.Wang W. Kim R. Jancarik J. Yokota H. Kim S.H. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 65-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 5.Regni C. Tipton P.A. Beamer L.J.

All of these proteins belong to the HAD superfamily; their structures consist of an α/β-hydrolase (core) domain with an insertion (cap) domain. The topology of the core domain within proteins in this superfamily is well conserved. The superposition of the structure of TA0175 with that of PSP (Fig. 3) revealed that the core α/β-domain aligns very well with a root mean square deviation value of 3.4 Å from the DALI analysis. In addition, residues from the three sequence motifs superpose particularly well (Fig. 3).Table IIISummary of seven closest structural homologues to protein TA0175 obtained with DALI analysisProtein Data Bank codeZr.m.s.d.IdentityProteinÅ%1j8d16.81.924YrbI (hypothetical protein hi1679)1f5s12.62.522PSP1fez11.62.912Phosphonoacetaldehyde hydrolase1eul10.32.421Calcium-transporting ATPase P-type1qq59.92.619L-2-Haloacid dehalogenase1cr67.32.718Epoxide hydrolase1chd6.83.18CheB methylesterase Open table in a new tab Although the core domain shows structural similarity with the α/β-hydrolases, the cap domain shows no structural similarity with any of the different functional classes of HAD enzymes identified by DALI. In TA0175, the cap domain is an open β-sandwich consisting of three antiparallel β-sheets flanked by two helices. In PSP, the cap domain is a four-helix bundle; in phosphonoacetaldehyde hydrolase it is a five-helix bundle. These structural differences suggest that the biological function of TA0175 differs from that of the above proteins. Three known bacterial response regulators identified by the DALI analysis share structural similarities to TA0175. Two of them, CheY and CheB, catalyze Mg2+-dependent phosphoryl transfer to an active site aspartate residue. CheY and CheB are members of bacterial two-component signaling cascades; each interacts with CheA as part of a phosphorelay reaction. CheY has a single domain with an (α/β)5-fold similar to the HAD superfamily. CheY and CheB also share active site residues similar to the active site aspartate of motif I from the HAD superfamily (21.West A.H. Martinez-Hackert E. Stock A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 276-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 22.Cho H.S. Lee S.Y. Yan D. Pan X. Parkinson J.S. Kustu S. Wemmer D.E. Pelton J.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 543-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). However, the cap domain is not seen in the above proteins, therefore it is unlikely that TA0175 belongs to this class of bacterial response regulators. Toward Functional Characterization of TA0175—Using both sequence analysis and structure information of TA0175, we have refined the possible functions of TA0175 and of its sequence homologues to a subset of four proteins in the HAD superfamily. The sequence analysis of this class of proteins was performed by searching for the N-terminal motif containing DhDGTh found in TA0175 and its close sequence homologues. In the HAD superfamily, the first aspartate (Asp-8), which is the characteristic nucleophile for this class of hydrolases, is strictly conserved. The second conserved aspartate (Asp-10) in this motif, which is present in TA0175, is found only in phosphotransferases and phosphatases and is replaced by a threonine in ATPases and by a tyrosine in dehalogenases, suggesting that TA0175 does not have ATPase or dehalogenase activity. The threonine found at position 5 in the DhDGTh motif is conserved in all enzymes except β-phosphoglucomutases and p-nitrophenylphosphatases. The glycine residue found at position 4 in the motif is replaced by a serine in PSP whose amide interacts with the phosphate oxygen of the substrate, thus increasing the electrophilicity of the phosphorus atom to facilitate attack by the nucleophilic aspartate (23.Thompson P.R. Cole P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8170-8171Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 24.Wang W. Cho H.S. Kim R. Jancarik J. Yokota H. Nguyen H.H. Grigoriev I.V. Wemmer D.E. Kim S.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 421-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Accordingly, if these substitutions are coordinately changed with function, TA0175 is unlikely to be any of the following acid hydrolases: a β-phosphoglucomutase, a phosphoserine phosphatase, a histidinol phosphatase, a p-nitrophenylphosphatase, a P-type ATPase, or a haloacid dehalogenase. To summarize, sequence and structural analysis suggested that the biological function of TA0175 is different from a number of phosphatases from the list of potential functional candidates, including PSP, phosphonoacetaldehyde hydrolase, calcium-transporting ATPase, l-2-haloacid dehalogenase, YrbI, epoxide hydrolase, CheY, and CheB. Our results from the above structural and sequence analysis approach are consistent with TA0175 belonging to one of the remaining four class of hydrolases (a trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase, a deoxyglucose-6-phosphate phosphatase, a phosphomannomutase, or a phosphoglycolate phosphatase) or that TA0175 may belong to a novel class of acid hydrolases altogether. TA0175 was screened for biological activity of the four possible enzymes by monitoring for the release of free phosphate in the presence of their appropriate substrates. We found that TA0175 catalyzed only the dephosphorylation of phosphoglycolate and displayed kinetic characteristics similar to the enzyme phosphoglycolate phosphatase (18.Rose Z.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 208: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 25.Seal S.N. Rose Z.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13496-13500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pH dependence, divalent metal ion requirement, chloride ion dependence, and kinetic parameters of TA0175 were then compared with those of phosphoglycolate phosphatase obtained from spinach and red blood cells. Results from these studies are consistent with TA0175 functioning as a phosphoglycolate phosphatase (Table IV and Fig. 4.).Table IVComparison of steady-state kinetic parameters for TA0175 with those of eukaryotic phosphoglycolate phosphatasesVariable substrateKmkcatkcat/Kmmms-1m-1 s-1TA0175Phosphoglycolate0.037 ± 0.0038.26 ± 1.542.2 × 105pNPP3.1 ± 0.50.58 ± 0.040.19 × 103Pyrophosphate0.17 ± 0.024.8 ± 0.30.3 × 105Spinach phosphoglycolate phosphataseaFrom Rose et al.

Biophys. 1981; 208: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) Open table in a new tab Although enzymatic activity of TA0175 with phosphoglycolate was observed, further kinetic characterization was undertaken. We also investigated the ability of TA0175 to catalyze the release of phosphate from the two nonspecific phosphatase substrates pNPP and inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi). As expected, enzyme TA0175 catalyzed the release of phosphate from both pNPP and PPi; however, the catalytic behavior of this enzyme is markedly different. With substrate analogue pNPP, saturation kinetics are observed but with reduced binding affinity, reduced catalytic activity, and markedly reduced catalytic efficiency with the kcat/Km value 1000-fold lower than with phosphoglycolate as substrate. With PPi, the enzyme catalytic properties are slightly altered with its catalytic efficiency reduced by less than 10-fold. However, we observed a sigmoidal curve, instead of a classic saturation curve, with a Hill's coefficient nH = 1.7 ± 0.2 indicating positive cooperativity in PPi binding. This observation is consistent with the crystal structure of the dimer, which revealed different distinct conformational states of the individual subunits within the protein. Phosphoglycolate phosphatase from both spinach and red blood cells is activated by Mg2+ ions (18.Rose Z.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 208: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 26.Husic H.D. Tolbert N.E. Arch. Bi"
https://openalex.org/W1987014317,"Estrogens exert their biological action via both genomic and non-genomic mechanisms. Proteins different from classical estradiol receptors are believed to mediate the latter effects. Here we demonstrate that the maxi-K channel functions as an estrogen-binding protein in transfected HEK293 cells. Whole-cell maxi-K channel currents and protein expression were attenuated by exposure to either 17α- or 17β-estradiol. This effect was dose-dependent for 17β-estradiol at concentrations ranging from 10 nm to 1 μm, while 17α-estradiol inhibited channel expression only at 1 μm. These effects were mediated by direct low affinity binding of estradiol to the maxi-K channel but not to its accessory β1-subunit, as revealed by cell membrane estradiol binding assays. However, specific binding of estradiol to the channel was facilitated by the presence of the β1 subunit. Addition of MG-132, a blocker of proteasomal degradation, stabilized channel expression. These data suggest that channel down-regulation is mediated by estrogen-induced proteasomal degradation, similar to the pathway used for estrogen receptor degradation. Membrane expression of endogenous maxi-K channels in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells was also attenuated by prolonged exposure to 17α- and 17β-estradiol. Thus our studies demonstrate that estrogen binds to maxi-K channels and may directly regulate channel expression and function. These results will have important implications in understanding estradiol-induced effects in multiple tissues including vascular smooth muscle. Estrogens exert their biological action via both genomic and non-genomic mechanisms. Proteins different from classical estradiol receptors are believed to mediate the latter effects. Here we demonstrate that the maxi-K channel functions as an estrogen-binding protein in transfected HEK293 cells. Whole-cell maxi-K channel currents and protein expression were attenuated by exposure to either 17α- or 17β-estradiol. This effect was dose-dependent for 17β-estradiol at concentrations ranging from 10 nm to 1 μm, while 17α-estradiol inhibited channel expression only at 1 μm. These effects were mediated by direct low affinity binding of estradiol to the maxi-K channel but not to its accessory β1-subunit, as revealed by cell membrane estradiol binding assays. However, specific binding of estradiol to the channel was facilitated by the presence of the β1 subunit. Addition of MG-132, a blocker of proteasomal degradation, stabilized channel expression. These data suggest that channel down-regulation is mediated by estrogen-induced proteasomal degradation, similar to the pathway used for estrogen receptor degradation. Membrane expression of endogenous maxi-K channels in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells was also attenuated by prolonged exposure to 17α- and 17β-estradiol. Thus our studies demonstrate that estrogen binds to maxi-K channels and may directly regulate channel expression and function. These results will have important implications in understanding estradiol-induced effects in multiple tissues including vascular smooth muscle. Existing epidemiological data suggest a beneficial role for estrogens in maintaining cardiovascular protection in pre-menopausal women. However, other data show that estrogen-containing preparations can negatively affect the health of premenopausal as well as post-menopausal women (1.Shumaker S.A. Legault C. Thal L. Wallace R.B.

These results indicate the existence of complex estradiol-signaling mechanisms, possibly mediated by proteins other than classical intracellular estradiol receptors (7.Pedram A. Razandi M.

Chem. 2002; 277: 50768-50775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar).One protein that has been hypothesized to be a potential effector of the action of estrogen is the large conductance Ca2+-and voltage-activated K+ channel (maxi-K channel). This channel provides a buffering repolarizing current in response to various physiological stimuli (8.Wellman G.C. Nathan D.J. Saundry C.M. Perez G. Bonev A.D. Penar P.L. Tranmer B.I. Nelson M.T.

Hypertension. 2001; 37: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which estrogen interacts with this channel is unknown. However, both 17β-estradiol and tamoxifen, a partial agonist of nuclear estradiol receptors, have been shown to activate maxi-K channels in both heterologous expression systems and smooth muscle cells, resulting in greater repolarizing currents (12.Wellman G.C. Bonev A.D. Nelson M.T. Brayden J.E. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 1024-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 13.Darkow D.J. Lu L. White R.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: H2765-H2773Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because acute incubation with either 17β-estradiol or membrane-impermeable estrogen derivatives activate maxi-K channels, signal transduction pathways other than those mediated by classical nuclear estradiol receptors α (ERα) 1The abbreviations used are: ER, estradiol receptor; FBS, fetal bovine serum; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; eGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein. 1The abbreviations used are: ER, estradiol receptor; FBS, fetal bovine serum; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; eGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein. or β (ERβ) are likely to be involved. Valverde et al. (14.Valverde M.A. Rojas P. Amigo J. Cosmelli D. Orio P. Bahamonde M.I. Mann G.E. Vergara C. Latorre R. Science. 1999; 285: 1929-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar) showed that activation of maxi-K channels by 17β-estradiol occurs when the channel is associated with its accessory β1-subunit. This effect was not observed in the presence of 17α-estradiol or when the maxi-K channel was expressed alone. This observation led to the hypothesis that the β1-subunit directly binds estradiol and enhances channel activity by an unidentified mechanism (14.Valverde M.A. Rojas P. Amigo J. Cosmelli D. Orio P. Bahamonde M.I. Mann G.E. Vergara C. Latorre R. Science. 1999; 285: 1929-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). However, other studies have demonstrated that β1-subunit-independent decreases in maxi-K channel unitary conductance occur in response to (xeno)estrogens, implicating that either subunit can be a target for estrogen (15.Dick G.M. Sanders K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44835-44840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Both studies emphasized the cell membrane-limited action of estrogen on the maxi-K channel, thus excluding a role for classical nuclear estradiol receptors. Other data indicate that ERα or ERβ may participate in membrane-associated signaling pathways when they are routed to the cell membrane by differential phosphorylation or binding to caveolins. Novel membrane-associated estradiol receptors are also a possible explanation for short term estrogen action (16.Ho K.J. Liao J.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 1952-1961Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 17.Joswig M. Hach-Wunderle V. Ziegler R. Naworth P.P. Exp. Clin. Endocrinol.

A. 2000; 97: 5930-5935Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar).Short term exposure of maxi-K channels to 17β-estradiol or to partial agonists of estradiol receptors is thought to activate the repolarizing current. Here, we report that exposure to either 17α- or 17β-estradiol induces both a decrease in maxi-K channel current and a down-regulation of channel protein expression in heterologous systems. Although 17α- and 17β-estradiol produce similar results, higher concentrations and longer exposure times are required for 17α-estradiol to mediate these effects. The presence of the β1-subunit did not alter channel expression, and its expression was inhibited by both estradiols. Further investigation into the mechanism underlying this response implicates estradiol-induced proteasomal degradation of the channel, which occurs after direct binding of estrogen to the maxi-K channel. Studies conducted in coronary artery smooth muscle cells suggest that 48 h of exposure to estrogens reduces maxi-K channel protein expression. The estrogen-induced loss of repolarizing current may have potentially negative functional consequences in tissues expressing endogenous maxi-K channels and may be one explanation for the complications associated with therapeutic use of estrogen-containing preparations.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials and Reagents—HEK293F cells, fetal bovine serum (FBS), gentamicin, and fungizone were from Invitrogen. Human coronary artery smooth muscle cells were purchased from Cell Applications (San Diego, CA). Diethylstilbestrol, 17α-estradiol, and 17β-estradiol, anti-α-smooth muscle actin-fluorescein isothiocyanate antibody, iberiotoxin, and polyethyleneinime were purchased from Sigma. Mouse hybridoma supernatant against a conserved region of the maxi-K channel was generated in our laboratory using a synthetic peptide for amino acids 913–926 of the channel. A sheep polyclonal antibody was generated by using a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein encoding the first intracellular loop of the channel (GenBank™ accession number AF349445). Mouse monoclonal anti-V5 antibody was obtained from Invitrogen, and rabbit polyclonal anti-β1-subunit antibody was from Affinity Bioreagents (Golden, CO). Biotin-conjugated IgG and streptavidin-conjugated fluorophores were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). Human recombinant fibroblast growth factor basic and human epidermal growth factor were obtained from Clonetics (San Diego, CA). The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit and GeneJammer transfection reagent were purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The nuclear extract kit was obtained from Active Motif (Carlsbad, CA). Proteasome inhibitor MG-132 and Anopore tissue culture inserts were purchased from Fisher Scientific. [6,7-3H]17β-Estradiol was obtained from Amersham Biosciences.Heterologous Expression of the Maxi-K Channel—An adenoviral construct of the maxi-K channel (GenBank™ accession number U11058), encoding the epitope (GenBank™ accession number AF349445), was generated. HEK293F cells, grown to 60–70% confluence on 0.02-μm Anopore tissue culture inserts in phenol red-free DMEM:F-12 medium supplemented with 10% hormone-free FBS, were infected with 10 μl of purified construct (1–1.2 × 1012 particles/ml). Heterologous expression of the maxi-K channel with its accessory β1-subunit was performed using 10 μl of an adenoviral construct of the human maxi-K channel β1-subunit (GenBank™ accession number NM 004137) at a concentration 107 particles/ml. Infection efficiency was monitored by eGFP reporter gene expression driven by a separate promoter. Cells cultured in estradiol-free medium as well as cells infected with the adenoviral vector alone were used as controls. One μm or 10 nm 17α- or 17β-estradiol was added to cultures 24 h post-infection and incubation continued for 30 min or 24 h. Proteasome-dependent proteolytic degradation was inhibited by incubating cell cultures with 1 μm MG-132 and either 1 μm 17α-estradiol for 24 h or 17β-estradiol for 30 min. Incubation with MG-132 alone was used as a control.Generation of the Maxi-K Channel Mutant—The maxi-K channel putative PEST motif mutant was generated by substitution of the -SPKK- amino acid sequence for -AAAA- (SPKK642–645AAAA) using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. The mutant was fused at the C terminus with a V5 tag and expressed in HEK293F cells using GeneJammer transfection reagent. Expression of the mutant channel was analyzed by immunocytochemistry following a 30-min incubation with 1 μm 17β-estradiol as described above.Live Cell Imaging—The maxi-K channels were fused at the C terminus with eGFP tags and expressed in HEK293F cells. Channel expression and intracellular trafficking in response to 17β-estradiol were examined after 48 h. Cell culture dishes were mounted on a Zeiss 510 confocal scanning microscope (Zeiss, Germany) at 37 °C. Cell cultures were subsequently incubated for 45 min in medium containing 1 μm 17β-estradiol and 15 mm HEPES. Images were taken in 1-min intervals.Human Coronary Artery Smooth Muscle Cell Culture—Cell cultures at passages 3–5 were grown on coverslips to 80–90% confluency in DMEM:F-12 (1:1) medium supplemented with fibroblast growth factor basic (0.5 ng/ml), epidermal growth factor (2 ng/ml), insulin (5 mg/ml), gentamicin (50 mg/ml), fungizone (250 μg/ml), and 5% FBS. Subconfluent cultures were brought into a quiescent state by incubating in DMEM:F-12 (1:1) medium supplemented with 0.5% hormone-free FBS for 10–14 days and than incubated in the presence of 1 μm 17α-estradiol or 17β-estradiol for 48 h. Cultures incubated in medium devoid of 17α-or 17β-estradiol were used as controls.Immunocytochemistry—HEK293F cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% Triton X-100 and then blocked in 5% heat-inactivated FBS. The maxi-K channel was detected by subsequent incubations with a sheep polyclonal antibody directed against the first intracellular loop (1:100; 30 min at 37 °C), biotin-conjugated donkey anti-sheep IgG (1:1000; 15 min at 37 °C), and 1 μg/ml of streptavidin-Cy5 (15 min at room temperature). β1-Subunit co-expressed with maxi-K channel was detected by rabbit polyclonal anti-β1 antibody (1:500) and donkey anti-rabbit-Cy3 (1:1000). Similarly, the maxi-K channels in human coronary artery smooth muscle cells were detected with maxi-K channel mouse hybridoma supernatant (1:50) and donkey anti-mouse-Cy3. α-Smooth muscle actin was then identified by direct immunofluorescence with anti-α-smooth muscle actin-fluorescein isothiocyanate antibody (1:500). Signals were visualized by Zeiss 510 confocal scanning microscope (Zeiss, Germany). The average signal intensity of each image was calculated using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health).Electrophysiology—All electrophysiological experiments were performed at room temperature. HEK293 cells expressing the maxi-K channel stably (under G418 selection) or transiently were grown to confluence in 35-mm dishes in phenol red-free DMEM supplemented with 10% hormone-free FBS. Once confluent, cells were trypsinized and resuspended in bath solution. Whole-cell recording was performed and analyzed as described previously (19.Benkusky N.A. Fergus D.J. Zucchero T.M. England S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27712-27719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 20.Fergus D.J. Martens J.R. England S.K. Pflügers Arch. 2003; 445: 697-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) using a holding potential of -80 mV, prepulsed to -100 mV, and currents elicited at step potentials from -80 to +160 in 20-mV intervals. Iberiotoxin (200 nm) was used to confirm the presence of maxi-K channel current. 17α- and 17β-estradiol were added directly to the bath at a final concentration of either 10 nm or 1 μm.Estrogen Binding Assay—HEK293F cells were transfected with either the maxi-K channels or the maxi-K channel accessory β1-subunits or both constructs. Cells expressing the adenoviral vector alone and MCF7 cells expressing endogenous nuclear ERα were used as controls. All cultured cells were grown in serum-free, phenol red-free medium 24 h prior to harvesting. Preparation of cellular membranes was described previously (21.Slaughter R.S. Welton A.F. Morgan D.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1687; 904: 92-104Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts of MCF7 cells were isolated using nuclear extract kit. Triplicate aliquots of 10 μg of the cell membranes or nuclear extracts were used in competed and non-competed binding assays. Nonspecific binding (competed) was assayed using 10 nm [6,7-3H]17β-estradiol in the presence of a 200-fold molar excess of diethylstilbestrol in Me2SO (22.Toran-Allerand C.D. Guan X. MacLusky N.J. Horvath T.L. Diano S. Singh M. Connolly E.S.J. Nethrapalli I.S. Tinnikov A.A. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 8391-8401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each reaction was adjusted to a final volume of 250 μl with binding buffer (in mm: 50 Tris-HCl, 5 MgCl2, pH 7.4) and incubated at 4 °C for 36 h. Total (non-competed) binding assays were performed using the same concentration of [6,7-3H]17β-estradiol in the absence of diethylstilbestrol. The incubation was terminated by adsorption of the free ligand onto dextran-coated charcoal (5 mg/ml) in the binding buffer. Dextran-coated charcoal was removed by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 5 min. Triplicates of the 25-μl samples were loaded onto Whatman GF/C glass fiber filters presoaked in 0.5% polyethylenimine for 36 h at 4 °C. The filters were washed three times with 5 ml of binding buffer using vacuum filtration and placed in 5 ml of scintillation mixture (RPI, Mount Pleasant, IL) overnight. Total and nonspecific binding was subsequently quantitated in a Beckman liquid scintillation spectrometer. Specific binding was calculated by subtracting nonspecific binding (competed) from total binding (non-competed).Statistical Analysis—Data were expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance of difference between control and experimental groups was calculated by paired t test. p value <0.05 indicated significant difference between groups.RESULTSHEK293 cells, which do not express endogenous estrogen receptors, were utilized to study the effects of 17α- and 17β-estradiol on maxi-K channels. Whole-cell recordings were performed in both HEK293 cell lines expressing the maxi-K channels either transiently or stably. In stable cell lines, both 1 μm 17α- and 17β-estradiol attenuated whole-cell maxi-K channel currents (Fig. 1, A and B). Maxi-K current was decreased ∼45% by 17α-estradiol at +160 mV, although current was significantly inhibited at lower depolarizing voltages (Fig. 1C). A similar effect was observed with 17β-estradiol with an attenuation of maxi-K channel current by ∼38% at +160 mV (Fig. 1D). Similar levels of current inhibition were seen in transiently transfected cells. Current inhibition was not detected within 10 min after addition of 10 nm 17α- and 17β-estradiol to the bath solution (Fig. 1, E and F). Currents were recorded for up to 15 min until seal integrity was compromised. Due to reports of endogenous K+ current in HEK293 cells (23.Jiang B. Sun X. Cao K. Wang R. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 238: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), iberiotoxin, a maxi-K channel inhibitor, was added to the bath solution to determine the contribution of the maxi-K channel to the estrogen-sensitive whole-cell K+ current. The maxi-K channel comprised ∼77% of the total K+ current in HEK293F cells and ∼100% of the estrogen-sensitive component (data not shown).The effects of estrogens on protein expression of transiently expressed maxi-K channels was studied immunocytochemically. A thirty minute incubation with 1 μm 17β-estradiol induced a profound (∼80%) attenuation of channel expression as compared with estradiol-free controls (Fig. 2, A, B, and F). At a concentration of 1 μm, 17α-estradiol demonstrated a similar level of inhibition, but only after 24 h exposure (Fig. 2, C and F). Although down-regulation of maxi-K channels has also been observed following a 30 min incubation with 10 nm 17β-estradiol (∼45%, Fig. 2, D and F), 17α-estradiol at the same concentration did not demonstrate an inhibition of channel expression after either a 30 min or 24 h incubation (Fig. 2, E and F). At a concentration of 100 nm, 17β-estradiol inhibited channel expression by ∼60%, while 17α-estradiol was again ineffective at this concentration (data not shown). Preincubation of cells with 17β-estradiol (10 nm or 1 μm) for 24 h prior to infection inhibited maxi-K channels by ∼80%. 17α-Estradiol produced a similar effect but only at 1 μm (data not shown). Neither estrogen affected infection efficiency as assessed by GFP reporter gene expression. Additionally, an inhibitory effect of 1 μm 17β-estradiol was observed in live HEK293F cells expressing maxi-K channels fused C-terminally with an eGFP tag. The response was detected as early as 10 min after addition of 17β-estradiol, although some cells demonstrated a delayed reaction detected after 40 min (Fig. 3, A and B). The difference in timing of the response may be related to the presence of the large C-terminal tag affecting the estrogen sensitivity of the channel. This response was clearly estrogen-dependent, since cells incubated in estradiol-free medium did not show a similar decrease in signal intensity (Fig. 3, C and D).Fig. 2Estrogens down-regulate membrane expression of transiently expressed maxi-K channels. Maxi-K channels in HEK293F cells were examined by immunocytochemistry. HEK293F cells express maxi-K channels in an estrogen-free environment on the cell membrane (A). 1 μm 17β-estradiol was added and protein expression examined 30 min later (B). The effect of 1 μm 17α-estradiol on maxi-K channel expression was examined following a 24-h incubation (C). Similarly, 10 nm 17β-estradiol (D) or 17α-estradiol (E) were introduced into the cell cultures and maxi-K channel expression examined 30 min later or 24 h later, respectively. Statistical significance of difference in expression levels (F) was assessed between estradiol-free controls ((-)E2) and 1 μm 17β-estradiol (1 μm, 17β) or 1 μm 17α-estradiol (1 μm, 17α). Effects of 10 nm 17β-estradiol (10 nm, 17β) or 10 nm 17α-estradiol (10 nm, 17α) were also compared with controls ((-)E2).

The maxi-K channels fused at their C termini with eGFP tags were transiently expressed in HEK293F cells.

We speculated that the accessory β1-subunit may be a stabilizing factor for the maxi-K channel in an estradiol-enriched environment. Endogenous β1-subunit transcript was not detected in HEK293F cells by reverse transcriptase-PCR (data not shown). Estradiol-induced down-regulation of maxi-K channels was observed in cells co-expressing the maxi-K channel with its accessory β1-subunit (Fig. 4, A and B) after a 30-min incubation with 17β-estradiol (Fig. 4C) or a 24-h incubation with 17α estradiol (Fig. 4E). In addition, β1-subunit expression was attenuated in a similar manner (Fig. 4, D and F). Thus the presence of the β1-subunit yielded the same degree of channel suppression observed when maxi-K channels were expressed alone (Fig. 4G).Fig. 4Co-expression of the maxi-K channel with its accessory β1-subunit does not prevent estrogen-induced down-regulation. The maxi-K channels (maxi-K, A) expressed with their accessory β1-subunits (β1, B) were incubated in either hormone-free medium or in medium supplemented with 1 μm 17β-estradiol for 30 min (C, D) or 17α-estradiol for 24 h (E, F). Differences in expression levels of the maxi-K channels (G) was assessed between estradiol-free controls ((-)E2) and 17β- (17β) or 17α-estradiol (17α) incubated cells. Significant differences (p < 0.05) are indicated by asterisks. Expression levels of the β1-subunit resembled that of the maxi-K channels (not shown in a graph). n = 6; scale bars = 10 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Estradiol-mediated down-regulation of maxi-K channel membrane expression may indicate that proteasome-dependent proteolytic degradation may be responsible, since this mechanism is involved in down-regulation of the ligand-activated ERα (24.Preisler-Mashek M.T. Solodin N. Stark B.L. Tyriver M.K. Alarid E.T. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: E891-E898Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). According to this hypothesis, inhibition of the proteasome complex would stabilize the maxi-K channel protein on the cell membrane. We examined the effects of the proteasome inhibitor, MG-132, on either a 17β-estradiol- (Fig. 5, A and B) or a 17α-estradiol-induced (Fig. 5, C and D) down-regulation of the maxi-K channel. The data demonstrate that incubation in the presence of MG-132 was sufficient to prevent down-regulation of maxi-K channels by estradiols (Fig. 5E). A similar effect was detected using 10 μm lactacystin, another proteasome inhibitor (data not shown). Analysis of the secondary structure of maxi-K channel using several Web-based databases (ExPASy, PESTFind) revealed the presence of a putative PEST motif -RLEDEQPSTLSPKK- in its intracellular C terminus, which may be mediating recognition and degradation of the maxi-K channel by the proteasome (25.Chen, E. Y., and Clarke, D. M. (2002) BMC Biochemistry http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/3/29Google Scholar, 26.Wallace A.D. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol.

The functional significance of this motif was determined by substituting the -SPKK- amino acids with -AAAA- (SPKK642–645AAAA) and assessing the response of the mutant to 17β-estradiol (Fig. 6, A and B). Resistance to estrogen-induced proteolytic degradation and a tendency toward increased channel expression was observed following a 30-min incubation with 1 μm 17β-estradiol (Fig. 6, A–C). These data indicate that the proteasome mediates channel degradation in response to estrogens.Fig. 5Inhibition of a proteasome-dependent proteolytic degradation pathway prevents estradiol-induced down-regulation of maxi-K channel membrane expression. HEK293F cells expressing the maxi-K channels were incubated in medium supplemented with 1 μm MG-132 (A) or 1 μm MG-132 + 1 μm 17β-estradiol for 30 min (B). Other cultures were incubated with MG-132 (C) or MG-132 + 1 μm 17α-estradiol for 24 h (D). Statistical differences in expression levels (E) were assessed between 30 min control MG-132 and MG-132 + 17β or a 24-h control MG-132 and MG-132 + 17α.

https://openalex.org/W2080373144,"EVI1 is a complex protein required for embryogenesis and inappropriately expressed in many types of human myeloid leukemia. Earlier we showed that the forced expression of EVI1 in murine hematopoietic precursor cells leads to their abnormal differentiation and increased proliferation. In this report, we show that EVI1 physically interacts with BRG1 and its functional homolog BRM in mammalian cells. We found that the C terminus of EVI1 interacts strongly with BRG1 and that the central and C-terminal regions of BRG1 are involved in EVI1-BRG1 interaction. Using reporter gene assays, we demonstrate that EVI1 activates the E2F1 promoter in NIH3T3 cells but not in BRG1-negative SW13 cells. Ectopic expression of BRG1 is able to repress the E2F1 promoter in vector-transfected SW13 cells but not in EVI1-transfected SW13 cells. Finally, we show that EVI1 up-regulates cell proliferation in BRG1-positive 32Dcl3 cells but not in BRG1-negative SW13 cells. Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that the interaction with BRG1 is important for up-regulation of cell-growth by EVI1.

EVI1 is an evolutionarily conserved DNA-binding protein that belongs to the Kruppel family of proteins and is characterized by two domains of seven and three repeats of the Cys2-His2-type zinc finger motif (1.Morishita K.

EVI1 was first identified in the mouse as the integration site of an activating ecotropic retrovirus leading to myeloid tumors in susceptible strains of mice (1.Morishita K. Parker D.S. Mucenski M.L.

EVI1 is not detected in normal hematopoietic organs including bone marrow, and the inappropriate expression of EVI1 is often triggered by chromosomal rearrangements that disrupt the 3q26 chromosomal region where this gene is located (4.Fichelson S.

The most frequent rearrangements associated with deregulation of EVI1 expression are the t(3,3)(q21;q26) and inv(3)(q21q26) observed in very aggressive acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (6.Morishita K.

Chronic myelogenous leukemia patients frequently display EVI1 up-regulation although their chromosomes appear normal by conventional cytogenetics, indicating that the inappropriate activation of EVI1 occurs also by unknown mechanisms. The forced expression of EVI1 in cell lines and in murine embryonic stem cells reduces the cellular response to growth inhibition by transforming growth factor-β (8.Kurokawa M. Mitani K. Irie K.

The mechanisms by which EVI1 disrupts normal cell replication and hematopoietic differentiation are not known. Using reporter gene assays, several investigators showed that EVI1 is a transcription repressor (12.Kreider B.L. Orkin S.H. Ihle J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EVI1 interacts with corepressors including the C-terminal-binding protein 1 and histone deacetylases, and with co-activators, including the cAMP-responsive-binding protein and the p300/cAMP-responsive-binding protein-associated factor (11.Chakraborty S.

The human SWI/SNF is a complex of about 2 MDa that contains 10–15 subunits. In addition to either BRG1 or BRM, which are the core members of the complex, the mammalian SWI/SNF complex contains other components like BAF170, BAF155, BAF60, BAF53, and INI1 (19.Wang W. Cote J.

The BRG1/BRM family members do not bind to specific DNA sequences but are recruited to promoters by DNA-binding proteins to alter the structure of chromatin. This process utilizes the energy of ATP hydrolysis to remodel the chromatin structure and to make specific DNA sequences more accessible (gene activation) or less accessible (gene repression) to the basal transcription machinery (22.Vignali M. Hassan A.H. Neely K.E. Workman J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1899-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 23.Kingston R.E. Narlikar G.J.

BRG1 and BRM are implicated in targeted gene regulation and are involved in varieties of critical aspects of cellular growth and genomic stability. They have been associated with gene activation by nuclear hormone receptors (15.Khavari P.A. Peterson C.L. Tamkun J.W. Mendel D.B. Crabtree G.R.

In addition, BRG1 and BRM have been linked to host immune defense system by activating the master regulators of major histocompatibility complex class I and II expression (36.Brockmann D. Lehmkuhler O. Schmucker U. Esche H. Gene. 2001; 277: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 37.Pattenden S.G. Klose R. Karaskov E. Bremner R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1978-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated whether the ability of EVI1 to up-regulate the cell cycle requires the association with BRG1. We show that the C-terminal region of EVI1 and the central and C-terminal regions of BRG1 are involved in EVI1-BRG1 interaction. This interaction is biologically significant, and by reporter gene assay we show that BRG1 is required for the activation of the E2F1 promoter by EVI1. These data suggest that the interaction of these proteins could explain the mechanism of cell cycle up-regulation by EVI1, and this model is confirmed by in vivo results showing that EVI1 up-regulates the cell cycle in BRG1-positive but not in BRG1-negative cells. DNA Constructs—FLAG-tagged full-length EVI1 and deletion mutants of EVI1 were described previously (11.Chakraborty S. Senyuk V. Sitailo S. Chi Y. Nucifora G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44936-44943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To clone the deletion mutants of BRG1, pBJ5-BRG1 plasmid was digested with EcoRI restriction enzyme. Three fragments were generated: 1) vector fragment BRG1 1–382, encoding the first 382 amino acids; 2) BRG1 382–1088, encoding amino acids 382–1088; 3) BRG1 1088–1648, encoding amino acids 1088–1648. The first fragment was self-ligated to generate BRG1 (1–382). The second and third fragments were cloned in-frame with the first fragment to generate BRG1 (1–1088) and BRG1 (Δ382–1088), respectively. To construct HA 1The abbreviations used are: HAhemagglutininPVDFpolyvinylidene difluorideRBretinoblastomaIPimmunoprecipitation.-tagged BRG1 mutants, a modified pCMV-myc-nuc (Invitrogen) containing the HA epitope was used (38.Senyuk V. Chakraborty S. Mikhail F.M. Zhao R. Chi Y. Nucifora G. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3232-3240Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The different fragments of BRG1 were cloned in-frame in the NotI site of pCMV-myc-nuc-HA to generate HA-BRG1 (382–1088), HA-BRG1 (1088–1598), and HA-BRG1 (382–917). All cloning junctions were verified by DNA sequencing. hemagglutinin polyvinylidene difluoride retinoblastoma immunoprecipitation. Cell Culture—The adherent cell lines 293T and NIH3T3 were cultured in Dulbecco's modified minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum. The BRG1-negative SW13 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified minimum essential medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. The suspension cell line 32Dcl3 was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% calf serum and 10% WEHI-3B conditioned medium as a source of interleukin 3. DNA Transfection—DNA transfection of adherent cells was performed by calcium phosphate precipitation method (39.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16-32Google Scholar). Ten μg of each plasmid was used for each 10-cm plate, unless indicated otherwise. Stably transfected 32Dcl3 cell clones were obtained by retroviral infection as described previously (11.Chakraborty S. Senyuk V. Sitailo S. Chi Y. Nucifora G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44936-44943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To generate EVI1-positive or vector (control) SW13 stable transfectants, the cells were transfected with pCMV-myc-nuc-HA-EVI1 or the empty vector by calcium phosphate precipitation method. Twenty-four h later, the culture medium was replaced with selection medium containing G418 (400 μg/ml) (BioWhittaker). After 7 days, single colonies were isolated and expanded. The expression of full-length EVI1 was confirmed by reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis. Co-immunoprecipitation and Western Blot—Transiently transfected 293T cells expressing the SV40 large T antigen were used for the assays. Forty-eight h after transfection, the cells were harvested, and immunoprecipitations were carried out as described (11.Chakraborty S. Senyuk V. Sitailo S. Chi Y. Nucifora G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44936-44943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The proteins were separated by electrophoresis in a 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane, the protein bands were visualized with the following commercially available antibodies: rabbit polyclonal BRG1 antibody (H-88) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), rat monoclonal HA antibody (Roche Applied Science), and mouse monoclonal FLAG antibody (M2) (Sigma). Reporter Gene Assay—Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. The reporter construct E2F1-Luc that expresses firefly luciferase under the control of E2F1 promoter was a gift of Dr. Raychaudhuri. NIH3T3 or SW13 cells plated in 6-well plates were transfected with 3 μg of the reporter construct E2F1-Luc and 3 μg of pRL-TK (Promega), which expresses Renilla luciferase as internal control. Forty-eight h after transfection, the cells were lysed with three cycles of freezing and thawing. The total cellular extracts were centrifuged, and the activity of the enzymes in the supernatant was measured using Luminometer TD-20/20 (Turner Designs Instrument). All assays were performed in triplicates, and each experiment was repeated at least twice. Flow Cytometry—One million stably transfected exponentially growing EVI1–32Dcl3 and EVI1-SW13 cells were collected, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and fixed in cold 70% ethanol for 1 h. Fixed cells were washed and incubated with 20 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma) containing 100 μg/ml RNase A (Sigma) at 37 °C for 1 h. The analysis of cell cycle profile was performed with a fluorescence-activated cell sorter using a Cell Quest package (BD Biosciences). EVI1 Interacts with BRG1 and BRM in Vivo—Although the human BRG1 and BRM complexes have been often associated with transcription activation (22.Vignali M. Hassan A.H. Neely K.E. Workman J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1899-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 40.Muchardt C. Yaniv M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), each complex is also implicated in transcription repression (41.Varga-Weisz P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3076-3085Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). BRG1 and BRM complexes that contain components of the co-repressor SIN3 complex have been purified from HeLa cell nuclear extracts (42.Sif S. Saurin A.J. Imbalzano A.N. Kingston R.E. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 603-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). SIN3 is involved in the repression of transcription by a variety of transcription factors. It has also been reported that BRG1 associates with a co-repressor multiprotein complex, N-CoR1, which possesses histone deacetylase activity (43.Underhill C. Qutob M.S. Yee S.P. Torchia J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40463-40470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). BRG1 also interacts with the mammalian heterochromatin protein 1-α and enhances heterochromatin protein 1-mediated transcription repression (44.Nielsen A.L. Sanchez C. Ichinose H. Cervino M. Lerouge T. Chambon P. Losson R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5797-5806Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Finally, combined studies from other investigators indicate that BRG1 interacts with the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (RB) and enhances RB-mediated transcription repression of key cell cycle targets, including E2F and cyclin A (28.Trouche D. Le Chalony C. Muchardt C. Yaniv M. Kouzarides T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11268-11273Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 45.Strobeck M.W. DeCristofaro M.F. Banine F. Weissman B.E. Sherman L.S. Knudsen E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9273-9278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We first tested the interaction between EVI1 and BRG1 using co-immunoprecipitation analysis. After transient transfection, the proteins were incubated with agarose-conjugated anti-FLAG antibody and were separated by electrophoresis. BRG1 was visualized by anti-BRG1 antibody. The results clearly show that BRG1 is immunoprecipitated with EVI1 in cells cotransfected with BRG1 and EVI1 (Fig. 1A, top panel, lane 1) but not in cells cotransfected with BRG1 and the empty vector (Fig. 1A, top panel, lane 2). In both cases, BRG1 was expressed in the cell lysates at level equivalent to EVI1 (Fig. 1A, top panel, lanes 3 and 4). The expression of the transfected FLAG-EVI1 was confirmed after stripping the membrane and hybridization to anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 1A, bottom panel, lanes 1 and 3). The interaction between EVI1 and BRG1 was further confirmed by the fact that EVI1 is immunoprecipitated by endogenous BRG1 in cells transfected with FLAG-EVI1 (Fig. 1B, top panel, lane 1) but not in cells transfected with the empty vector (Fig. 1B, top panel, lane 2). The amount of endogenous BRG1 in the IP reaction is shown in Fig. 1B, bottom panel, lanes 1 and 2. The amount of endogenous BRG1 in the cell lysates is shown in Fig. 1B, bottom panel, lanes 3 and 4. Because the mammalian SWI/SNF complexes contain either BRG1 or the highly related BRM as ATPase subunit, we tested the interaction between FLAG-EVI1 and HA-BRM. Anti-HA antibody was used to visualize HA-BRM. As with BRG1, we found that FLAG-EVI1 interacts with HA-BRM (Fig. 1C, top panel, lane 1). The interaction was not observed with the empty vector (Fig. 1C, top panel, lane 2). The expression of HA-BRM (Fig. 1C, top panel, lanes 3 and 4) and EVI1 (Fig. 1C, bottom panel) is also shown. To identify the region of EVI1 that interacts with BRG1, the FLAG-tagged full-length EVI1 and a series of deletion mutants (Fig. 2A, lanes 1–4) were cotransfected with BRG1 in 293T cells. The full-length EVI1 interacts strongly with BRG1 (Fig. 2B, top panel, lane 1). The deletion mutants FLAG-EVI1–653 (lane 2) and FLAG-EVI1–514 (lane 3) interact weakly. The shortest deletion mutant FLAG-EVI1–283 (lane 4) and the empty vector (lane 5) do not interact with BRG1. The expression of EVI1 and its deletion mutants was confirmed after the membrane was stripped and reprobed with anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 2B, middle panel). The amount of BRG1 input in different reactions is about the same (Fig. 2B, bottom panel). The result obtained with mock-transfected 293T cells is also shown (lane 6). The faint band in the bottom panel identifies the endogenous BRG1 present in 293T cells. The Central and C-terminal Regions of BRG1 Are Required for Efficient Interaction with EVI1—A schematic representation of BRG1 and its domains is shown in Fig. 3, line 1. To map the region of BRG1 responsible for mediating the interaction with EVI1, we generated a series of BRG1 deletion mutants and tested their ability to interact with full-length FLAG-EVI1. The first group of deletion mutants (Fig. 3A, lines 2–4) contains the intact N-terminal region of BRG1 (1–382 amino acids) and can be detected by anti-BRG1 antibody (raised against amino acids 209–296 of BRG1). The second group of deletion mutants lacking the N terminus (Fig. 3A, lines 5–7) was cloned in pCMV-myc-nuc-HA vector to provide a nuclear localization signal and the HA epitope, and anti-HA antibody was used for their identification. The BRG1 deletion mutants were separately cotransfected with either full-length FLAG-EVI1 (Fig. 3B, lanes 1 and 3) or the empty vector (Fig. 3B, lanes 2 and 4). FLAG-EVI1 failed to co-immunoprecipitate BRG1 (1–382), which contains only the N terminus of BRG1 (Fig. 3B, left top panel, lane 1). However, the other deletion mutants, which contain either the central region or the C terminus of BRG1, are able to interact with FLAG-EVI1 but not with the empty vector (Fig. 3B, left middle and bottom panels and right panel, lane 1). Lanes 3 and 4 in Fig. 3B show the protein expression in the cell lysates. EVI1 Co-operates with BRG1 in the Activation of the E2F1 Promoter—Previous studies (28.Trouche D. Le Chalony C. Muchardt C.

RB is the master regulator of cell cycle, and the repression of E2F-mediated transcription is thought to underlie RB-dependent cell-cycle arrest (46.Bartek J. Bartkova J. Lukas J. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 237: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). E2F controls the expression of numerous genes directly involved in cell cycle progression or in metabolic processes coupled to DNA replication (47.Nevins J.R. Leone G. DeGregori J. Jakoi L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 173: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 48.DeGregori J. Leone G. Miron A. Jakoi L. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7245-7250Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). To evaluate the potential significance of the EVI1-BRG1 interaction in the regulation of cell cycle, we used the E2F1 promoter linked to the luciferase reporter gene in reporter gene assays. We first assessed the ability of EVI1 to modulate the E2F1 promoter activity in NIH3T3 cells. NIH3T3 cells were cotransfected with FLAG-EVI1 or the empty vector, together with E2F1-Luc reporter plasmid and the internal control pRL-TK. In NIH3T3 cells, full-length FLAG-EVI1 activates E2F1 promoter activity about 3-fold compared with the empty vector (Fig. 4A). To investigate the potential role of BRG1 in EVI1's activation of the promoter, we utilized SW13 cells, a BRG1- and BRM-deficient cell line derived from human small-cell carcinoma (49.Muchardt C. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4279-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 50.Dunaief J.L. Strober B.E. Guha S. Khavari P.A. Alin K. Luban J. Begemann M. Crabtree G.R. Goff S.P. Cell. 1994; 79: 119-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). In contrast to what we found in NIH3T3 cells, in the absence of BRG1 and BRM, there is no difference between the response of the E2F1 promoter in presence or absence of added EVI1 (Fig. 4B, white bars). However, when a functional BRG1 was introduced into the SW13 cells by cotransfection, BRG1 was able to suppress E2F1 promoter activity with the empty vector but not with FLAG-EVI1 (Fig. 4B, gray bars), confirming the results obtained with BRG1-positive NIH3T3. EVI1 Up-regulates Cell Proliferation in BRG1-positive 32Dcl3 Cells but Not in BRG1-negative SW13 Cells—We reported earlier that the forced expression of EVI1 in 32Dcl3 and embryonic stem cell lines leads to a significant up-regulation of cell replication (9.Sitailo S. Sood R. Barton K. Nucifora G. Leukemia. 1999; 13: 1639-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 10.Sood R. Talwar-Trikha A. Chakrabarti S.R. Nucifora G.

Chem. 2001; 276: 44936-44943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To assess the functional importance of BRG1 in EVI1-dependent up-regulation of cell proliferation, we carried out cell cycle analyses of SW13 and 32Dcl3 cell lines that stably express EVI1. As controls, we used the same cell lines stably transfected with the empty vector. We found that the forced expression of EVI1 in the BRG1-positive 32Dcl3 cells reduced the number of cells in G1 by over 20% (from 61% in vector-32Dcl3 cells to 40% in EVI1–32Dcl3 cells) and increased the number of cells in G2/M by about 12% (from 9.6% in vector-32Dcl3 cells to 21% in EVI1–32Dcl3 cells) (Fig. 5A). In contrast, there was no significant difference in the fluorescence-activated cell sorter profile of BRG1-negative SW13 cells that expressed or did not express EVI1 (Fig. 5B). A large number of genes contain consensus sequences for E2F binding in their promoters. Some of these genes encode well studied cell cycle regulators such as cyclin E, cyclin A, cdc2, cdk2, and even E2F1 and E2F2 themselves (51.Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar). Others encode enzymes that are important for DNA synthesis, such as DNA polymerase α (52.Pearson B.E. Nasheuer H.P. Wang T.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2081-2095Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), thymidine kinase (53.Ogris E. Rotheneder H. Mudrak I. Pichler A. Wintersberger E. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 1765-1771Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 54.Karlseder J. Rotheneder H. Wintersberger E. Mol. Cell.

E2F regulates gene expression in different ways depending on promoter contexts. It acts as a transcription activator for the genes involved in DNA synthesis and thus promotes DNA synthesis (56.Means A.L. Slansky J.E. McMahon S.L. Knuth M.W. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1054-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 57.Wade M. Kowalik T.F. Mudryj M. Huang E.S. Azizkhan J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4364-4374Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In contrast, for cell cycle regulators E2F mediates a transcription repression by association with RB family proteins and assembly of a repressor complex (51.Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar). RB contains distinct surfaces that enable the protein to bind to E2F and to a different group of proteins that contain the LXCXE motif (58.Fattaey A.R. Harlow E. Helin K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7267-7277Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). BRG1 and BRM contain LXCXE-related sequences and are reported to cooperate with RB in repression of E2F-dependent transcription (28.Trouche D. Le Chalony C. Muchardt C. Yaniv M. Kouzarides T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11268-11273Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) and in growth suppression (50.Dunaief J.L. Strober B.E. Guha S. Khavari P.A. Alin K. Luban J. Begemann M. Crabtree G.R. Goff S.P. Cell. 1994; 79: 119-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Loss of BRG1 or BRM activity abrogates RB-mediated transcription repression and the ability of RB to arrest proliferation. In our study, we show that EVI1 and BRG1 interact and that EVI1 increases the activity of E2F1 in BRG1/BRM-containing NIH3T3 cells in reporter gene assays. There is compelling evidence that E2F activity is rate-limiting for S-phase entry. Not only does elevated E2F activity drive cells into S phase, but also the inhibitors of E2F reduce S-phase entry (51.Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar). The proportion of cells in G1 is increased by the over-expression of dominant-negative mutants of E2F1 (59.Dobrowolski S.F. Stacey D.W. Harter M.L. Stine J.T. Hiebert S.W. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2605-2612PubMed Google Scholar) or by the expression of competitor RNA molecules (60.Ishizaki J. Nevins J.R. Sullenger B.A. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 1386-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Our reporter gene assays show that EVI1 up-regulates the activity of E2F1 in NIH3T3 cells. This increase is not observed in SW13 cells that are BRG1- and BRM-deficient but is reestablished by addition of functional BRG1 to the EVI1-positive SW13 cells. These results strongly imply that BRG1 and EVI1 interact to enhance E2F1 functions and support the results of cell cycle analyses of BRG1-positive and BRG1-negative cell lines. However, given the complex roles of BRG1 in cell maintenance and chromatin remodeling and our limited understanding of BRG1 in regulation of cell cycle, it is difficult at this time to illustrate the precise mechanism by which EVI1 mediates the BRG1-dependent regulation of cell cycle. It was shown that BRG1 controls E2F promoter by interaction with RB. Co-immunoprecipitation analyses (not shown) suggest that EVI1 and RB do not interact directly, and it is likely that the effect of EVI1 on the E2F1 promoter is indirect. It is possible that the binding of EVI1 to BRG1 could mask the BRG1 interface required to associate with RB and inhibit BRG1 interaction with RB. BRG1 and BRM contain the LXCXE motif in their E7 homology domain at their C-terminal regions. This motif is common to other RB-interacting proteins, such as human papillomavirus E7, simian virus 40 large T antigen, and adenovirus E1A (61.Strober B.E. Dunaief J.L. Guha Goff S.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1576-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), and it was shown that the deletion of the E7 homology region from BRG1 and BRM completely eliminates its ability to bind to RB (28.Trouche D. Le Chalony C. Muchardt C. Yaniv M. Kouzarides T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11268-11273Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The results of our mapping analysis indicate that the region of BRG1 that associates with EVI1 includes the E7 motif. It is therefore possible that the association with EVI1 could block the interaction between BRG1 and RB. These data provide insight on a novel pathway that could lead to a better understanding of the mechanism of up-regulation of cell proliferation by EVI1. We thank Dr. Xiaodong Wang for help, Drs. Douglas Dean and Achim Leutz for the full-length BRG1 and BRM plasmids, and Dr. Pradip Raychaudhuri for the E2F1-Luc plasmid."

These results suggest that β-Arg99 and γ-Arg97 are needed for normal ADP activation. In addition, the γ-R97Q enzyme has a Km for NAD 10 times that of WT enzyme.

Mammalian NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (threo-Ds-isocitrate:NAD+ oxidoreductase (decarboxylating), EC 1.1.1.41) is an allosteric mitochondrial enzyme regulated by ADP, which activates by lowering the Km for the substrate isocitrate without changing the Vmax (1Cohen P.F.

It is a hetero-oligomeric enzyme, composed of three distinct types of subunits, present in the ratio 2α:1β:1γ. The subunits have molecular weights of 37,000, 39,000, and 39,000 for α, β, and γ, respectively, whereas their isoelectric points are distinctive (2Ehrlich R.S. Hayman S. Ramachandran N. Colman R.F.

The pig heart NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase has been shown to bind tightly, per mole of enzyme tetramer, 2 mol of every ligand (isocitrate, Mn2+, NAD, ADP, NADH, and NADPH), indicating that there are half as many sites as subunits (4Ehrlich R.S.

These observations have raised the question as to whether the subunits have specialized functions for particular ligands or if there is a functional similarity among the different subunits, and two subunits contribute to a given ligand site.

In contrast to the mammalian NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenases, these NADP-specific enzymes are not allosterically regulated by ADP. Among the human enzyme α, β, and γ subunits, alignment of the amino acid sequences of all 3 subunits indicates 34% identity plus 23% close similarity. If these three subunits are aligned with the E. coli enzyme, there is 13% identity plus 29% similarity; whereas only 5% identity plus 22% similarity is observed when the human NAD enzyme is compared with both the E. coli and pig heart NADP-dependent enzymes. However, there are certain amino acids that are conserved, including those known to interact with the isocitrate in the E. coli, B. subtilis, and pig heart NADP-enzymes. Fig. 1 shows a comparison of an important region of amino acid sequence alignment of the human NAD-isocitrate dehydrogenase subunits with the E. coli, B. subtilis, and pig heart NADP enzymes. Despite the relatively low amino acid sequence identity among these enzymes, the human NAD-enzyme α-Arg88, β-Arg99, and γ-Arg97 can be aligned with Arg119 of E. coli, Arg110 of B. subtilis, and Arg101 of the pig heart NADP enzymes; all 3 arginines are conserved. Although there have been numerous biochemical and kinetic studies of NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenases isolated from bacteria, yeast, and animal tissues, the precise function of the individual subunits has not yet been determined for these allosteric mammalian enzymes. To elucidate the functional roles of mammalian enzyme subunits, Kim et al. (12Kim Y.O. Koh H.J. Kim S.H. Jo S.H. Huh J.W. Jeong K.S. Lee I.J. Song B.J. Huh T.L. J. Biol.

The primer sequences, with the restriction sites in bold letters and the restriction enzymes in parentheses, are shown. The underlined codons are those mutated from arginine to glutamine. To construct the IDH(α-Q88)β2γ mutant, two overlapping DNA fragments were produced by amplification of the human pHIDHαβ2γ plasmid DNA as template, using two sets of PCR primers, namely, P1/P3 and P2/P4 as a first PCR step. The two overlapping DNA fragments, 0.28 and 0.81 kbp with the IDH(α-Q88) mutation, were then mixed and ligated in a second PCR step, using as end primers, the P1/P4 set. Subsequently, the mutant IDHα DNA (1.1 kbp) obtained from PCR ligation was subcloned into pT7Blue T-vector. The occurrence of the desired mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing in both directions. The IDHα DNA was excised with NdeI/BamHI digestions and then inserted into the NdeI/BamHI site of the expression vector pT7-7 (Amersham Biosciences) to construct the mutant pHIDH(α-Q88) plasmid. To produce a complete plasmid DNA harboring IDH(α-Q88)β2γ DNA, with wild type IDHβ2 and IDHγ subunits, the IDHβ2 and IDHγ DNA from plasmids pHIDHβ2 and pHIDHγ, respectively, were removed and each was sequentially added to the mutant pHIDHα plasmid, as previously described (12Kim Y.O. Koh H.J. Kim S.H. Jo S.H. Huh J.W. Jeong K.S. Lee I.J. Song B.J. Huh T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36866-36875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For the construction of the IDHα(β2-Q99)γ mutant, two overlapping DNA fragments of IDHβ2 mutant (0.16 and 0.39 kbp) were amplified by PCR using two primer sets (P5/P7 and P6/P8). By using the P5/P8 primer set, two partial IDHβ2 mutant DNA fragments obtained from the first PCR step were then ligated in a second PCR step. The resulting 0.53-kbp mutant IDH(β2-Q99) DNA, after digestion with EcoNI/SphI, replaced EcoNI/SphI-cleaved wild type IDHβ2 DNA in a pHIDHαβ2γ plasmid to produce a mutant pHIDHα(β2-Q99)γ plasmid DNA (12Kim Y.O. Koh H.J. Kim S.H. Jo S.H. Huh J.W. Jeong K.S. Lee I.J. Song B.J. Huh T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36866-36875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Similarly, two overlapping DNA fragments (0.23 and 0.46 kbp) for mutant IDH(γ-Q97) were amplified by PCR using P9/P11 and P10/P12 primer sets. After a second PCR ligation of these two DNA fragments using a P9/P12 primer set, a partial DNA fragment (0.69 kbp) of the IDH(γ-Q97) mutant was obtained. After digestion with ApaI/SacI, it replaced the ApaI/SacI-excised wild type IDHγ DNA in a pHIDHαβ2γ plasmid to generate a mutant pHIDHαβ2(γ-Q97) plasmid (12Kim Y.O. Koh H.J. Kim S.H. Jo S.H. Huh J.W.

Transformation and Overexpression of Recombinant IDH Proteins in E. coli Cells—The wild type and mutant recombinant plasmids were used to transform E. coli EB 106 (DE 3) cells, deficient in isocitrate dehydrogenase activity, prepared as previously described (12Kim Y.O. Koh H.J. Kim S.H. Jo S.H. Huh J.W. Jeong K.S. Lee I.J. Song B.J. Huh T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36866-36875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Bacterial colonies with positive inserts were subcultured by growing overnight at 37 °C in LB media supplemented with ampicillin (0.05 mg/ml). Aliquots of E. coli cells harboring wild type and mutant plasmid were maintained in stock solution at -80 °C in 40% glycerol. E. coli cells harboring either wild type or mutant plasmid from glycerol stocks were subcultured overnight in 200 ml of LB media containing ampicillin. Four-liter flasks, each containing 2 liter of LB media with 0.05 mg/ml ampicillin (to a total volume of 8 liters), were inoculated with freshly grown E. coli cells (2% v/v) and were grown at 37 °C, at 220 rpm, until the growth reached a mid-log phase or cell density of A600 nm = 0.4. The flasks were then placed in chilled water to lower the culture temperature to room temperature. Protein expression was induced in cells by addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.4 mm and the flasks were shaken at the lower speed of 140 rpm with minimal aeration at 25 °C for 22 h. The cell cultures were then centrifuged at 5000 × g for 10 min and, to improve the effectiveness of cell lysis, the cells were suspended in the relatively small volume of 200 ml of cold 11 mm citrate Tris buffer, pH 7.2, containing 10% glycerol, 0.2 mm MnSO4, and 0.1 mm DTT and stored at -80 °C. Frozen cells in a 100-ml volume were thawed partially and lysed, while keeping the preparation in cold water, by sonication with a large probe at 20 KHz and 475 W for 10 min with intermittent mixing. The lysate was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min and the clear supernatant (crude extract) was separated. The protein concentration and isocitrate dehydrogenase activity were determined in this crude extract. Assay for NAD-dependent Isocitrate Dehydrogenase Activity—Enzyme activity was determined by monitoring at 340 nm, the time dependent increase in UV absorbance of NADH produced by reduction of NAD, at 25 °C in a 1-ml standard assay mixture containing 33 mm Tris acetate buffer, pH 7.2, 20 mm dl-isocitrate, 1 mm MnSO4, and 1 mm NAD as the final concentrations. During the purification, the protein concentration was determined from the A280 nm after correcting for the ratio of A280/A260 (15Warburg O. Christian W. Biochem. Z. 1941; 310: 384-387Google Scholar). For the pure preparations, enzyme concentrations in milligrams/ml were calculated using E280m1&percnt; = 6.45 (4Ehrlich R.S. Colman R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1276-1282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specific activity was expressed as micromole/min/mg of protein. In the crude extract and ammonium sulfate fractions, to assay isocitrate dehydrogenase activity, the NADH oxidase inhibitor, rotenone (10 μl in 100% ethanol), was added to the 1-ml standard assay solution to give a final concentration of 2.5 μm rotenone. SDS-PAGE of Wild Type and Mutant Enzymes—To determine the purity of protein samples during the purification steps, aliquots of fractions were analyzed in 15% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% SDS in a discontinuous pH electrophoresis system (16Blackshear P.J. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 104: 237-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The preparation of stacking and resolving gel, electrophoresis running conditions, protein staining, and destaining solutions were followed as described (17Soundar S. Colman R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5264-5271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pure mammalian NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase was recognized by the appearance of two close bands in approximately equal intensity, with an upper band (β, γ subunits) of 39,000 Da and a lower band of 37,000 Da (α subunits) (3Ramachandran N. Colman R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8859-8864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Ramachandran N. Colman R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 252-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Purification of Wild Type and Mutant Isocitrate Dehydrogenases from Crude Extract—The wild type IDH was isolated from crude extract by ammonium sulfate fractionation: the solution was brought to 30% saturated ammonium sulfate and centrifuged to remove the precipitate. The supernatant was then brought to 50% ammonium sulfate and centrifuged. The resultant precipitate was dissolved in 12 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm MnSO4, and 0.1 mm DTT (Buffer A). This crude extract was dialyzed against 6 liters of Buffer A with 3 changes, for 6 h each. The enzyme was applied to a DE-52 column (3 × 13 cm), which had previously been equilibrated with Buffer A. The column was eluted with the same buffer (525 ml) until A280 nm reached baseline. The bound enzyme was eluted from DE-52 in a linear gradient formed from 100 ml of Buffer A and 100 ml of 50 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm MnSO4, and 0.1 mm DTT. Fractions (5 ml) exhibiting specific activity more than 6.0 units/mg were pooled (210 ml) and concentrated to 32 ml by ultrafiltration. The pool was dialyzed with two changes, against 6 liters of 10 mm citrate Tris buffer, pH 6.0, containing 20% glycerol and 0.1 mm DTT (Buffer B). The preparation was further fractionated by chromatography on a cellulose phosphate cation-exchange column (2.5 × 11.0 cm). The column was washed with 250 ml of Buffer B, and then a linear gradient consisting of 100 ml of Buffer B and 100 ml of 0.15 m citrate Tris buffer, pH 6.0, containing 20% glycerol, and 0.1 mm DTT was used to elute the enzyme. The fractions (2 ml) were collected in tubes containing MnSO4 (final concentration, 2 mm) to maintain enzyme stability. Aliquots of fractions showing high specific activity were screened by SDS-PAGE as described above. The mutants α-R88Q, β-R99Q, and γ-R97Q were purified as described above except for the following modifications. In the case of the α-R88Q mutant, because the crude extract did not have any observable activity, fractions were evaluated by SDS-PAGE. The redissolved ammonium sulfate precipitate was dialyzed and applied to the DE-52 column under the same conditions described for wild type enzyme. Because α-R88Q did not bind to the DE-52 column, the fractions eluting in the starting buffer were concentrated and dialyzed against 6 liters of 12 mm sodium citrate, pH 6.3, buffer containing 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm MnSO4, and 0.1 mm DTT (Buffer C) with 2 changes, and was applied to a Matrex Gel Blue A affinity column (2 × 11 cm) equilibrated with Buffer C. After elution with 180 ml of the initial buffer, the bound α-R88Q protein was eluted first in a linear gradient consisting of 100 ml of Buffer C and 100 ml of 0.2 m triethanolamine chloride buffer, pH 7.4, containing 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm MnSO4, and 0.1 mm DTT. The α-R88Q enzyme was eluted after 60 ml of the elution volume of the gradient. The remaining protein was eluted with 0.2 m triethanolamine chloride buffer, pH 7.4, containing 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm MnSO4, and 0.1 mm DTT. The gradient fractions (2 ml) containing pure α-R88Q protein were pooled and concentrated for further characterization. For purification of the β-R99Q mutant enzyme, the crude extract (after ammonium sulfate fractionation) was applied to the DE-52 column under the same conditions used for the wild type enzyme. The β-R99Q mutant enzyme did not bind to the DE-52 column at pH 7.4. The wash fractions (250 ml) from the DE-52 column were pooled, concentrated to 12.5 ml, and dialyzed against 6 liters of 12 mm sodium citrate, pH 6.0, buffer, containing 20% glycerol, 0.1 mm MnSO4, and 0.1 mm DTT (Buffer D) with two changes, and were applied to a cellulose phosphate column (2.5 × 11.0 cm), which was equilibrated with the same buffer used for dialysis but without MnSO4. After the column was eluted with 200 ml of the initial buffer, the β-R99Q mutant enzyme bound to the cellulose phosphate column was eluted after ∼70 ml, in a linear gradient consisting of 200 ml of Buffer D and 200 ml of 50 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 20% glycerol and 0.1 mm DTT. Gradient fractions (6 ml) with the highest specific activity were pooled and found to be homogeneous on SDS-PAGE. Because the γ-R97Q mutant enzyme did not bind to either the DE-52 or cellulose phosphate at pH 7.4, chromatography on DE-52 was subsequently conducted at pH 8.0. The enzyme eluted from the cellulose phosphate column was pooled and dialyzed against 6 liters of 15 mm triethanolamine chloride buffer, pH 8.0, containing 20% glycerol and 0.1 mm DTT (Buffer E). The dialyzed γ-R97Q enzyme was applied to a DE-52 column (3 × 13 cm) equilibrated with Buffer E, followed by elution with 370 ml of initial buffer. The γ-R97Q enzyme was eluted in a linear gradient consisting of 300 ml of Buffer E and 300 ml of 0.3 m triethanolamine chloride buffer, pH 8.0, containing 20% glycerol and 0.1 mm DTT. The fractions (7 ml) were collected into tubes containing MnSO4 (final concentration, 2 mm) to stabilize the enzyme. The γ-R97Q enzyme, eluted after 175 ml in the gradient, appeared to be homogeneous on SDS-PAGE. Secondary Structure Determination by Circular Dichroism—A Jasco model J-710 spectropolarimeter was used to measure the ellipticity as a function of wavelength between 250 and 200 nm in a 0.1-cm path length quartz cell. The wild type and mutant proteins (0.1 mg/ml) were dialyzed against 2 liters of 25 mm triethanolamine chloride buffer, pH 7.4, containing 10% glycerol and 0.2 mm MnSO4 and the same buffer was used to dilute the enzymes. The mean residue molar ellipticity [θ] (degree cm2 dmol-1) was calculated from the equation: [θ] = θ/(10 nCl), where θ is the measured ellipticity in millidegrees, C is the molar concentration of protein determined, as described earlier, using an average subunit molecular weight of 37,722 calculated from the sequences of the α (19Kim Y.O.

Native Molecular Mass Determination by Gel Filtration Chromatography—Wild type and mutant enzymes, 0.4 ml of 2.0 mg/ml were applied to a Superose-12 (1 × 30 cm) column of a fast performance liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences). The enzymes had been dialyzed and the column was equilibrated and eluted with 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.0, containing 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm MnSO4, and 0.1 mm DTT. The proteins were eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min and 0.5-ml fractions were collected. The column has a total volume of 24.0 ml (Vt) and a void volume of 7.14 ml (V0), determined with blue dextran 2000. The elution volume (Ve) for each protein was measured from A280 nm of the fractions. The native molecular mass of the wild type and mutant enzymes were determined from a plot of log (Mr) against Kd ((Ve - V0)/(Vt - V0)) for standard proteins. Amino Acid Sequence Determination—The NH2-terminal amino acid sequences of wild type and mutant enzymes were determined using an Applied Biosystems Protein/Peptide Sequencer (model Procise) equipped with an on-line Microgradient delivery system (model 140 C) and a Macintosh computer (model 610). Determination of Subunit Composition and Separation of Subunits by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)—Wild type or mutant enzyme, 0.2 ml of 1 mg/ml, was denatured by addition of 0.05 ml of 20% SDS and the solution was incubated at 35 °C for 24 h. The sample was diluted to 1.0 ml with 0.75 ml of a mixture containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and acetonitrile (CH3CN) (4:1), and applied to a C4 reverse phase column (Vydac) using a Varian 5000 liquid chromatograph system. The column was previously equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water and the proteins (1 ml fractions) were eluted with the same solution for 10 min followed by a linear gradient to 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in CH3CN in 200 min. The fractions collected in each distinct peak were pooled, lyophilized,"
https://openalex.org/W2031690395,"LEK1, a member of the LEK family of proteins, is ubiquitously expressed in developing murine tissues. Our current studies are aimed at identifying the role of LEK1 during cell growth and differentiation. Little is known about the function of LEK proteins. Recent studies in our laboratory have focused on the characterization of the LEK1 atypical Rb-binding domain that is conserved among all LEK proteins. Our findings suggest that LEK1 potentially functions as a universal regulator of pocket protein activity. Pocket proteins exhibit distinct expression patterns during development and function to regulate cell cycle, apoptosis, and tissue-specific gene expression. We show that LEK1 interacts with all three pocket proteins, p107, p130, and pRb. Additionally, this interaction occurs specifically between the LEK1 Rb-binding motif and the ""pocket domain"" of Rb proteins responsible for Rb association with other targets. Analyses of the effects of disruption of LEK1 protein expression by morpholino oligomers demonstrate that LEK1 depletion decreases cell proliferation, disrupts cell cycle progression, and induces apoptosis. Given its expression in developing cells, its association with pocket proteins, and its effects on proliferation, cell cycle, and viability of cells, we suggest that LEK1 functions in a similar manner to phosphorylation to disrupt association of Rb proteins with appropriate binding targets. Thus, the LEK1/Rb interaction serves to retain cells in a pre-differentiative, actively proliferative state despite the presence of Rb proteins during development. Our data suggest that LEK1 is unique among LEK family members in that it specifically functions during murine development to regulate the activity of Rb proteins during cell division and proliferation. Furthermore, we discuss the distinct possibility that a yet unidentified splice variant of the closely related human CENP-F, serves a similar function to LEK1 in humans."
https://openalex.org/W1968513047,"We have developed a genetic system, called degrakine, that specifically and stably inactivates chemokine receptors (CKR) by redirecting the ability of the HIV-1 protein, Vpu, to degrade CD4 in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via the host proteasome machinery. To harness Vpu's proteolytic targeting capability to degrade new receptors, we fused a chemokine with the C terminal region of Vpu. The fusion protein, or degrakine, accumulates in the ER, trapping and functionally inactivating its target CKR. We have demonstrated that degrakines based on SDF-1 (CXCL12), MDC (CCL22) and RANTES (CCL5) specifically inactivate their respective receptor functions. Using a retroviral vector expressing the SDF-1 degrakine, we have established that CXCR4 is required for the homing of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC) to the bone marrow immediately after transplantation. Thus the degrakine provides an effective genetic tool to dissect receptor functions in a number of biological systems in vitro and in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2009098875,"Previous work has shown that inhibition of Jak2 via the pharmacological compound AG490 blocks the angiotensin II (Ang II)-dependent activation of ERK2, thereby suggesting an essential role of Jak2 in ERK activation. However, recent studies have thrown into question the specificity of AG490 and therefore the role of Jak2 in ERK activation. To address this, we reconstituted an Ang II signaling system in a Jak2–/–cell line and measured the ability of Ang II to activate ERK2 in these cells. Controls for this study were the same cells expressing Jak2 via the addition of a Jak2 expression plasmid. In the cells expressing Jak2, Ang II induced a marked increase in ERK2 activity as measured by Western blot analysis and in vitro kinase assays. ERK2 activity returned to basal levels within 30 min. However, in the cells lacking Jak2, Ang II treatment resulted in ERK2 activation that did not return to basal levels until 120 min after ligand addition. Analysis of phosphatase gene expression revealed that Ang II induced mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 1 (MKP-1) expression in cells expressing Jak2 but failed to induce MKP-1 expression in cells lacking Jak2. Therefore, our results suggest that Jak2 is not required for Ang II-induced ERK2 activation. Rather Jak2 is required for Ang II-induced ERK2 inactivation via induction of MKP-1 gene expression.

These proteins become activated by phosphorylation on tyrosine and threonine residues in response to a variety of ligands binding their cognate receptors at the cell surface (1.Anderson N.G.

Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Angiotensin II is one such ligand; it exerts many of its mitogenic effects by binding to the angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor and thus activating ERK1/2. This occurs via rapid angiotensin II-dependent phosphorylation of the dual specificity kinase MEK, which in turn phosphorylates ERK1/2 on both threonine and tyrosine residues (5.Takahasi T.

The duration of ERK activation is regulated by the intracellular signals that phosphorylate and dephosphorylate it (6.Pearson G. Robinson F. Beers Gibson T. Xu B.E. Karandikar M. Berman K. Cobb M.H. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 153-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (3485) Google Scholar). While ERKs are activated by ligand binding at the cell surface, they are inactivated by several dual specificity phosphatases (7.Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). One of these, mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 1 (MKP-1), associates with and is phosphorylated by activated ERK2 and thus protected from proteasomal degradation. The phosphorylated MKP-1 then dephosphorylates ERK2, thereby inactivating it (8.Brondello J.M. Pouyssegur J. Mckenzie F.R. Science. 1999; 286: 2514-2517Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar).Evidence shows that Jak2 forms a membrane complex with the intermediate signaling molecules Ras and Raf1 and may therefore play a role in the regulation of ERK activity (9.Wang X.-Y.

In fact, previous work has suggested that inhibition of Jak2 using the pharmacological compound AG490 blocks the angiotensin II-dependent activation of ERK2 (12.Marrero M.B. Schieffer B. Li B. Sun J. Harp J.B. Ling B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24684-24690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). One problem, however, with using AG490 to study the function of Jak2 is its lack of specificity for Jak2. While AG490 is a potent Jak2 inhibitor, it is known to inhibit other tyrosine kinase signaling pathways as well. AG490 inhibits activation of cyclin-dependent kinases and causes growth arrest of cells in G1 phase (13.Kleinberger-Doron N. Shelah N. Capone R. Gazit A. Livitzki A. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 241: 340-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). It also inhibits calf serum-inducible cell growth and DNA synthesis (14.Oda Y. Renaux B. Bjorge J. Saifeddine M. Fujita D.J. Hollenberg M.D. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1999; 77: 606-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and is a partial blocker of c-Src activity (13.Kleinberger-Doron N. Shelah N. Capone R. Gazit A. Livitzki A. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 241: 340-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Most critically, AG490 inhibits epidermal growth factor receptor autophosphorylation more potently than it inhibits Jak2 kinase activity (15.Osherov N.A. Gazit C. Gilon C. Levitzki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11134-11142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In our experiments, AG490 is certainly a potent inhibitor of Jak2. However, we have found that alternate methods such as transfection of dominant negative Jak2, introduction of Jak2 antisense oligonucleotides, or some other method must be used when working with AG490 (16.Sayeski P.P.

Clearly new strategies are needed to study Jak2 kinase function.In this work, we utilized the γ2A cell line, which contains a Jak2 null mutation (18.Kohlhuber F. Rogers N.C. Watling D. Feng J. Guschin D. Briscoe J. Witthuhn B.A. Kotenko S.V. Pestka S. Stark G.R. Ihle J.N. Kerr I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 695-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). On this background, stable cell lines were created that expressed either the AT1 receptor alone (γ2A/AT1) or the AT1 receptor and Jak2 (γ2A/AT1+Jak2) via stable integration of cDNA plasmids. Using these cells, we measured the ability of angiotensin II to activate ERK2 as a function of Jak2 expression. We show that, in cells expressing Jak2, angiotensin II induced a marked increase in ERK2 activity, which returned to basal levels within 30 min. However, in cells lacking Jak2, angiotensin II treatment resulted in sustained ERK2 activation, which did not return to basal levels until 120 min after ligand stimulation. We hypothesized that Jak2 was playing a role in the inactivation of ERK2 by mediating the expression of one or more phosphatase proteins that target ERK2 for inactivation. Here we provide evidence that angiotensin II stimulates expression of MKP-1 and that Jak2 is essential for this event. Moreover, we provide evidence that Jak2 is essential for angiotensin II-induced co-association of ERK2 and MKP-1. Collectively, these studies show that Jak2 is not required for angiotensin II-dependent ERK2 activation but rather that Jak2 is required for angiotensin II-induced inactivation of ERK2. Furthermore, these studies demonstrate the need for novel strategies to study the function of Jak2 beyond the use of AG490.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—γ2A/AT1 and γ2A/AT1+Jak2 cells were created as described below. These cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4.5 g/liter glucose and 10% fetal bovine serum and growth arrested in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 24 h prior to experiments. The vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) expressing either a Jak2 dominant negative allele (Jak2 DN) or a neomycin resistance cassette (control) have been described previously (16.Sayeski P.P.

Cell culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen. Inhibitor compounds were from either Calbiochem or LC Laboratories. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma or Fisher.Generation of Plasmid Constructs and Stable Cell Lines—The HA-tagged AT1 receptor cDNA cloned into the pcDNAI vector was kindly provided by Dr. Robert J. Lefkowitz (19.Oppermann M. Freedman N.J. Alexander R.W. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13266-13272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The cDNA was excised from pcDNAI and cloned into pcDNA3 via HindIII and NotI restriction digestion. A fragment encoding the amino-terminal HA tag and the 5′ sequence of the AT1 receptor cDNA up through the internal EcoRI site was then removed via HindIII and EcoRI restriction digestion and cloned into pZeo/WT (20.Ali M.S.

The resulting construct, pZeo/HA-AT1-WT, contained an amino-terminal HA tag inserted just after the first methionine, ∼1100 bp encoding the rat AT1 receptor open reading frame, and ∼850 bp of rat AT1 receptor 3′ untranslated region in a zeocin-resistant plasmid.To generate the stable cell lines, γ2A cells were transfected with 20 μg of pZeo/HA-AT1-WT and 10 μg of pBOS-Jak2-WT encoding the wild type Jak2 cDNA (21.Zuhuang H. Patel S.V. He T. Sonsteby S.K. Niu Z. Wojchowski D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21411-21414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Control cells received 20 μg of pZeo/HA-AT1-WT and 10 μg of empty vector control plasmid. Two days after transfection, cells were switched to medium supplemented with 500 μg/ml zeocin to select for stable transfectants. Surviving colonies were eventually ring cloned, and binding assays were performed using [125I-Sar1,Ile8]angiotensin II (where Sar is sarcosine) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as described previously (20.Ali M.S.

Nonspecific binding was defined as binding in the presence of 1.0 μm angiotensin II. Scatchard analysis was used to identify respective γ2A clones in which the binding parameters (Kd and Bmax) were similar. To measure the level of expressed Jak2 protein, 20 μg of whole cell lysate from each clone was Western blotted with anti-Jak2 antibody as described below.Immunoprecipitation—Cells were washed with 2 volumes of ice-cold PBS containing 1 mm Na3VO4 and lysed in 1.0 ml of ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing protease inhibitors (22.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1997Google Scholar). The samples were immunoprecipitated exactly as described previously (23.Sayeski P.P. Ali M.S. Harp J.B. Marrero M.B. Bernstein K.E. Circ.

The anti-Tyr(P) mAb (PY20) was from BD Transduction Laboratories.Western Blotting—Proteins were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence exactly as described previously (23.Sayeski P.P. Ali M.S. Harp J.B. Marrero M.B. Bernstein K.E. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 1279-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The anti-Jak2, anti-STAT1, anti-STAT3, and anti-ERK2 blotting antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The anti-phospho-ERK2 antibody was from Promega. The anti-PP2A antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. The anti-paxillin antibody was from BD Transduction Laboratories. The anti-MKP-1 antibody was from Sigma.In Vitro Kinase Assay—ERK2 immunoprecipitates were washed twice with wash buffer followed by two washes in kinase reaction buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 20 mm MgCl2). The precipitates were resuspended in 50 μl of the same kinase buffer containing 50 μm ATP, 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 5 μg of myelin basic protein. The samples were incubated for 15 min at 30 °C. Reactions were terminated by adding sample buffer. The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and subjected to autoradiography.Immunostaining—Cells were grown on 8-well microscope slides. After ligand treatment, cells were washed twice with K+-free PBS and fixed for 60 min at room temperature with 4% paraformaldehyde. Following fixation, cells were washed four times with K+-free PBS, permeabilized for 10 min at room temperature with 0.2% Triton X-100 in K+-free PBS (v/v), washed an additional four times, and then blocked with 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in K+-free PBS for 4 h at room temperature. Following blocking, cells were incubated with anti-phospho-ERK2 primary antibody overnight at 4 °C in K+-free PBS containing 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The following day, cells were washed five times and incubated with a goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to Texas Red for 4 h at room temperature. The cells were then dehydrated through increasing concentrations of ethanol, dipped into xylene, and mounted. The following day, the cells were visualized with a fluorescence microscope.Luciferase Assay—γ2A/AT1 and γ2A/AT1+Jak2 cells were transfected with the indicated DNA in 20 μl of Lipofectin exactly as described previously (24.Sayeski P.P. Ali M.S. Frank S.J. Bernstein K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10556-10563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Following angiotensin II treatment, luciferase activity was measured from detergent extracts in the presence of ATP and luciferin using the Reporter Lysis Buffer system (Promega) and a luminometer (Monolight Model 3010). Luciferase values were recorded as relative light units.RESULTSγ2A+AT1 Cells Lack Functional Jak2-dependent Signaling—The γ2A cell line was originally created by irradiating HT-1080 human fibrosarcoma cells to create mutations within single genes and then selecting for cells containing a mutation that ablated the expression of Jak2 (18.Kohlhuber F. Rogers N.C. Watling D. Feng J. Guschin D. Briscoe J. Witthuhn B.A. Kotenko S.V. Pestka S. Stark G.R. Ihle J.N. Kerr I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 695-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). To constitute angiotensin II signaling in these cells, the AT1 receptor, which was cloned into a zeocin-resistant vector, was stably transfected into cells either alone (γ2A/AT1) or with a wild type Jak2 cDNA plasmid (γ2A/AT1+Jak2). We performed binding assays, and respective γ2A clones were identified in which the binding parameters were similar. γ2A/AT1 (clone 4) had a Kd of 0.44 nm and a Bmax of 201 fmol/mg of protein, while γ2A/AT1+Jak2 (clone 1) had a Kd of 0.41 nm and a Bmax of 226 fmol/mg of protein. To demonstrate that Jak2 is expressed in γ2A/AT1+Jak2 cells, but not in γ2A/AT1 cells, both cell types were grown to about 70% confluency and lysed, and protein was extracted. The protein extracts were immunoblotted with an anti-Jak2 antibody (Fig. 1, top). The blot shows that Jak2 is only expressed in the γ2A/AT1+Jak2 cells. By stripping the membrane and reprobing with an anti-STAT1 antibody, we demonstrated equal sample loading by detecting endogenous STAT1 protein (Fig. 1, bottom). Thus, while both clones expressed AT1 receptor at similar affinity and abundance, only the γ2A/AT1+Jak2 clone expressed Jak2 protein.We next wanted to determine whether angiotensin II-stimulated, Jak2-dependent signaling was in fact lost in the cells lacking Jak2 but intact in the cells expressing Jak2. Upon angiotensin II stimulation, Jak2 becomes phosphorylated and associates with the AT1 receptor (20.Ali M.S. Sayeski P.P. Dirksen L.B. Hayzer D.J. Marrero M.B. Bernstein K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23382-23388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). To show that these events do not occur in γ2A/AT1 cells but do occur in γ2A/AT1+Jak2 cells, both sets of cells were stimulated with 100 nm angiotensin II for 0, 5, and 15 min. The cells were then lysed, and protein was extracted. The protein extracts were immunoprecipitated with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and then immunoblotted with an anti-Jak2 antibody to detect phosphorylated Jak2 protein. In the γ2A/AT1 cells, angiotensin II treatment failed to induce Jak2 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 2A). However, in γ2A/AT1+Jak2 cells, angiotensin II stimulated rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2.Fig. 2Angiotensin II-mediated signaling in the γ2A/AT1 cells and γ2A/AT1+Jak2 cells. γ2A/AT1 cells and γ2A/AT1+Jak2 cells were treated with 100 nm angiotensin II for the indicated times, and lysates were prepared. A, lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Tyr(P) mAb and Western blotted with anti-Jak2 mAb to detect tyrosine-phosphorylated Jak2. B, lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA mAb to immunoprecipitate the HA-tagged AT1 receptor and then Western blotted with anti-Jak2 polyclonal antibody to detect Jak2/AT1 co-association. C, lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Tyr(P) mAb and Western blotted with anti-STAT1 mAb to detect tyrosinephosphorylated STAT1. D, lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Tyr(P) mAb and Western blotted with anti-STAT3 mAb to detect tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3. E, lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Tyr(P) mAb and Western blotted with anti-paxillin mAb to detect tyrosine-phosphorylated paxillin. Shown is one of four (A, C, and D) or three (B and E) independent results for each. IP, immunoprecipitation; IB, immunoblot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)After Jak2 is activated, it binds to the AT1 receptor in response to angiotensin II (20.Ali M.S. Sayeski P.P. Dirksen L.B. Hayzer D.J. Marrero M.B. Bernstein K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23382-23388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). To detect Jak2 co-association with the AT1 receptor, γ2A/AT1 and γ2A/AT1+Jak2 cells were next stimulated with 100 nm angiotensin II for 0, 2, 4, and 8 min. The cells were lysed, protein was extracted, and the protein extracts were immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody to immunoprecipitate the HA-tagged AT1 receptor. The immunoprecipitates were then immunoblotted with an antiJak2 antibody to assess Jak2/AT1 receptor co-association. Angiotensin II-dependent Jak2/AT1 receptor co-association was absent in the γ2A/AT1 cells but was seen in the γ2A/AT1+Jak2 cells (Fig. 2B).After becoming phosphorylated and associating with the AT1 receptor following angiotensin II stimulation, Jak2 recruits STAT proteins to the receptor and mediates their tyrosine phosphorylation (25.Marrero M.B. Scheiffer B. Paxton W.G. Heerdt L. Berk B.C. Delafontaine P. Bernstein K.E. Nature. 1995; 375: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Therefore we next examined the ability of angiotensin II to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 as a function of Jak2 expression. First, γ2A/AT1 and γ2A/AT1+Jak2 cells were stimulated with 100 nm angiotensin II for 0, 5, and 15 min. The cells were then lysed, and protein was extracted. The protein extracts were immunoprecipitated with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and immunoblotted with an anti-STAT1 antibody to detect tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT1 (Fig. 2C). The results show that while angiotensin II failed to induce a marked increase in STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation in the γ2A/AT1 cells, it did promote increased STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation in the γ2A/AT1+Jak2 cells. The same membrane was then stripped and immunoblotted with an anti-STAT3 antibody to detect tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3 (Fig. 2D). Again the results show that STAT3 becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to angiotensin II in the γ2A/AT1+Jak2 cells but not in the γ2A/AT1 cells. Collectively, these data show that, in γ2A/AT1+Jak2 cells, phosphorylation of the downstream target proteins of Jak2, namely STAT1 and STAT3, occurs in response to angiotensin II but that phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 is virtually absent in cells lacking Jak2.Upon angiotensin II treatment of cells, the cytoskeletal protein paxillin becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated (26.Leduc I. Meloche S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4401-4404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This event happens very rapidly and occurs independently of Jak2. We therefore expected that paxillin signaling would be intact in both the γ2A/AT1 and γ2A/AT1+Jak2 cells. To test this, both cell types were stimulated with 100 nm angiotensin II for 0, 1, and 5 min. The cells were lysed, and protein was extracted. The protein extracts were immunoprecipitated with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and immunoblotted with an anti-paxillin antibody to detect tyrosine-phosphorylated paxillin (Fig. 2E). The results show that in both cell types, paxillin was rapidly tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to angiotensin II treatment, thereby indicating that angiotensin II signaling events, which are independent of Jak2, function normally in both cell types.Collectively, the data in Fig. 2 demonstrate that, in γ2A/AT1 cells, functional Jak2-dependent signaling has been lost, while Jak2-independent signaling events have been preserved. As such, these cells are good vehicles for studying Jak2-dependent signaling.ERK2 Activity Is Sustained in γ2A/AT1 Cells Compared with γ2A/AT1+Jak2 Cells following Angiotensin II Treatment—Previous work demonstrated that inhibition of Jak2 phosphorylation using AG490 blocks angiotensin II-dependent activation of ERK2, thus implicating Jak2 as essential in ERK2 activation (12.Marrero M.B. Schieffer B. Li B. Sun J. Harp J.B. Ling B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24684-24690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Recently, however, the specificity of AG490 for Jak2 has come under scrutiny (13.Kleinberger-Doron N. Shelah N. Capone R. Gazit A. Livitzki A. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 241: 340-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 14.Oda Y. Renaux B. Bjorge J. Saifeddine M. Fujita D.J. Hollenberg M.D. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1999; 77: 606-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We therefore sought to determine the role that Jak2 plays in angiotensin II-dependent ERK2 activity using the γ2A-derived cells. γ2A/AT1 and γ2A/AT1+Jak2 cells were stimulated with 100 nm angiotensin II for 0, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30 min. The cells were lysed, and protein was extracted. The protein extracts were immunoblotted with an anti-phospho-ERK2 antibody that detects phosphorylated ERK2 protein. In the cells lacking Jak2, angiotensin II stimulation resulted in a rapid and sustained increase in ERK2 activation that persisted for 30 min (Fig. 3A, top). However, in the γ2A/AT1+Jak2 cells, angiotensin II caused an increase in ERK2 activity that peaked at 6–12 min and returned to basal levels 18–24 min after angiotensin II stimulation. The membrane was subsequently stripped and reprobed with an anti-ERK2 antibody to show constant ERK2 expression at all time points (Fig. 3A, bottom).Fig. 3Angiotensin II-dependent ERK2 activity in γ2A/AT1 cells and γ2A/AT1+Jak2 cells. A, γ2A/AT1 and γ2A/AT1+Jak2 cells were treated with 100 nm angiotensin II for the indicated times. Whole cell lysates were prepared and Western blotted with anti-phospho-ERK2 antibody to detect activated ERK2. The membrane was subsequently stripped and reprobed with anti-ERK2 antibody to confirm total ERK2 protein levels. B, the three membranes representing A were subjected to densimetric analysis. Anti-phospho-ERK2 signal was plotted as a function of both angiotensin II treatment and Jak2 expression. *, p < 0.01; **, p < 0.05. C, γ2A/AT1 cells and γ2A/AT1+Jak2 cells were treated with 100 nm angiotensin II for the indicated times. Lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated with anti-ERK2 mAb and then resuspended in kinase reaction buffer. Phosphorylation of myelin basic protein (MBP) was detected by autoradiography. Shown is one of three independent results for A and C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The three different membranes representing Fig. 3A were scanned for densimetric analysis, and ERK2 phosphorylation was plotted as a function of angiotensin II treatment (Fig. 3B). The graph shows that in the cells expressing Jak2, ERK2 phosphorylation transiently increased, peaking 6 min after angiotensin II treatment. However, in cells lacking Jak2, ERK2 phosphorylation was significantly elevated 30 min after angiotensin II stimulation. Longer time course studies using the γ2A/AT1 cells demonstrated that ERK2 phosphorylation did not return to basal level until about 120 min after angiotensin II treatment (data not shown). Thus, the data in Fig. 3A suggest that loss of Jak2 expression via a null mutation results in sustained ERK2 phosphorylation in response to angiotensin II. This is contrary to previously published data, which suggested that inhibiting Jak2 kinase function using AG490 results in diminished angiotensin II-dependent ERK2 phosphorylation (12.Marrero M.B. Schieffer B. Li B. Sun J. Harp J.B. Ling B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24684-24690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). To verify our results using an alternate protocol, in vitro kinase assays were performed using myelin basic protein as a substrate for ERK2 phosphorylation. In γ2A/AT1 cells, phosphorylation of myelin basic protein remained elevated 20 min after angiotensin II treatment, suggesting that ERK2 was catalytically active at this time point (Fig. 3C). However, in γ2A/AT1+Jak2 cells, angiotensin II stimulated ERK2 activity with peak activity occurring around 5–10 min. By 15–20 min, the 32P-labeled myelin basic protein signal was similar to that of basal conditions. Collectively the results in Fig. 3 clearly show that loss of Jak2 expression via a Jak2 null mutation results in enhanced ERK2 activation in response to angiotensin II when compared with Jak2-expressing control cells.AG490 Suppresses Angiotensin II-dependent ERK2 Activation Independently of Jak2—We next wanted to determine whether treating the Jak2-e"

Based on experiments with kinase inhibitors, with PCCL3 cell lines with doxycycline-inducible expression of RET/PTC mutants with substitutions of critical tyrosine residues in the kinase domain, and lines with inducible expression of activated mutants of H-RAS and MEK1, RET/PTC was found to regulate mPGES-1 through Shc-RAS-MEK-ERK. These data show a direct relationship between activation of a tyrosine kinase receptor oncogene and regulation of PGE2 biosynthesis.

The RET gene encodes a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor, expression and function of which are normally restricted to a subset of cells derived from the neural crest. Rearrangements of RET resulting in its constitutive activation are believed to play a causative role in the pathogenesis of a significant proportion of thyroid papillary carcinomas (PTC) (1Santoro M.

Acute RET/PTC activation stimulates both DNA synthesis and apoptosis in thyroid cells, is associated with loss of thyroid-specific differentiation, and interferes with thyrotropin (TSH) receptor-mediated intracellular signaling at various levels (18Wang J.

Taken together, these data suggest that acute expression of RET/PTC in normal follicular cells induces significant phenotypic changes oriented toward neoplastic transformation. Epidemiological studies show decreased risk of several types of epithelial cancer in individuals regularly taking aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (19Baron J.A. Cole B.F.

This has been attributed to inhibition of prostaglandin production in tumor tissues, in particular prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) (21Chen X. Li N. Wang S. Hong J. Fang M. Yousselfson J. Yang P. Newman R.A.

Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6706-6711PubMed Google Scholar). The synthesis of PGE2 from arachidonic acid requires two enzymes acting sequentially. Cyclooxygenase (COX) catalyzes the synthesis of endoperoxide prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) from arachidonic acid (AA). There are two COX isoforms; COX-1 is constitutively expressed in most tissues, whereas COX-2 is normally not expressed but is induced by growth factors, cytokines, and certain oncogenes (reviewed in Ref. 23Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 145-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2425) Google Scholar). The two COX isozymes play distinct physiological roles, although their function may overlap in certain settings (reviewed in Ref. 24Smith W.L. Langenbach R. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 1491-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Thus, COX-1 is required for biosynthesis of thromboxane A2 in platelets, which in its absence fail to undergo AA-induced aggregation. COX-1 is also required for onset of parturition via generation of PGF2α (25Langenbach R. Morham S.G. Tiano H.F. Loftin C.D. Ghanayem B.I. Chulada P.C. Mahler J.F. Lee C.A. Goulding E.H.

By contrast COX-2 appears to play a more significant role in development, closure of the ductus arteriosus, and ovulation (24Smith W.L. Langenbach R. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 1491-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). COX-1 has a higher Km for AA than COX-2. Thus, in the presence of low AA concentrations, COX-2 can operate when COX-1 is inactive (27Shitashige M. Morita I. Murota S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1389: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), a mechanism that may account for the fact that prostanoids formed in the late phase (hours) after cell exposure to tumor promoters, cytokines, and growth factors are formed via COX-2 (reviewed in Ref. 24Smith W.L. Langenbach R. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 1491-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). A variety of epithelial malignancies have increased expression of COX-2, including colorectal (28Yoshimatsu K. Golijanin D. Paty P.B. Soslow R.A. Jakobsson P.J. DeLellis R.A. Subbaramaiah K.

This appears to be important in disease pathogenesis, as genetic or biochemical disruption of COX-2 in APC Δ7–16 mice, a model of human familial adenomatous polyposis coli, results in a major reduction in the number and size of intestinal polyps (33Oshima M.

Although most studies implicate COX-2, rather than COX-1, in colorectal carcinogenesis, a recent study indicates that deficiency of either enzyme reduces polyp burden in APC (-/+) mice (35Chulada P.C. Thompson M.B. Mahler J.F. Doyle C.M. Gaul B.W. Lee C. Tiano H.F. Morham S.G. Smithies O. Langenbach R. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4705-4708PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, three prostaglandin E synthase (PGES) isoforms involved in the terminal step of PGE2 synthesis, the conversion of PGH2 to PGE2, have been identified. Based on ectopic overexpression of various COX and PGES isozymes, a hierarchy of functional interactions between them has been established (reviewed in Ref. 36Fitzpatrick F.A. Soberman R. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 1347-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Cytosolic (cPGES) is expressed constitutively and has been proposed to exhibit preferential functional coupling with COX-1 (37Tanioka T. Nakatani Y. Semmyo N. Murakami M. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32775-32782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Microsomal PGES-1 (mPGES-1) is induced by proinflammatory stimuli and increases during the period when COX-2-dependent PGE2 generation is ongoing (38Murakami M. Naraba H. Tanioka T. Semmyo N.

Commun. 2002; 291: 884-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), and has been proposed to couple functionally to both COX-1 and COX-2 (41Murakami M. Nakashima K. Kamei D. Masuda S. Ishikawa Y. Ishii T. Ohmiya Y. Watanabe K. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37937-37947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). mPGES-1 is overexpressed in the majority of colorectal adenomas and carcinomas, suggesting that this may contribute to the increased amounts of PGE2 in these tumors. Relatively little is known about pathogenetic mechanisms that may account for mPGES-1 expression in cancer tissues. Here we report that activation of the RET/PTC oncoprotein is associated with a rapid and vigorous induction of mPGES-1 and COX-2 expression and stimulation of PGE2 biosynthesis in thyroid cells. RET/PTC effects on mPGES-1 mRNA require coupling to Shc, likely via Tyr-1062, and activation of MEKERK. As RET/PTC is believed to be an early event in thyroid cell transformation, these data suggest that the PGE2 biosynthetic machinery may be recruited into action shortly after tumor initiation, and may play a significant role in tumor progression. Cell Lines and Reagents—PCCL3 cells, a clonal rat thyroid line requiring TSH for growth, were maintained in H4 complete medium consisting of Coon's medium/F12 high zinc supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 0.3 mg/ml l-glutamine, 1 mIU/ml TSH, 10 μg/ml insulin, 5 μg/ml apo-transferrin, 10 nm hydrocortisone, and penicillin/streptomycin. H3 complete medium was identical to H4 complete medium but without addition of TSH. The following lines were derived from PCCL3 cells to obtain doxycycline-inducible expression of RET/PTC isoforms with or without the indicated mutations, as described elsewhere (18Wang J. Knauf J.A.

Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar): rtTA-7 (stably expressing only the doxycycline-inducible transactivator rtTA), rtTA-3 (empty vector transfected rtTA-7 cells), PTC3-5 (doxycycline-inducible RET/PTC3), PTC1–31 (doxycycline-inducible RET/PTC1), PTC2-PDZ (doxycycline-inducible RET/PTC2 mutant unable to associate with Shc, in which the 22 most C-terminal amino acids, including Tyr-1062, were replaced with the PDZ domain of Enigma to ensure appropriate membrane localization) and PTC3Y541F (doxycycline-inducible RET/PTC3 tyrosine substituted unable to associate with PLCγ). In addition, we used clonal PCCL3 cell lines with doxycyclineinducible expression of H-RasV12 (Ras-25 cells) and MEK1S217E/S221E (MEK1–55 cells) (42Saavedra H.I. Knauf J.A. Shirokawa J.M. Wang J.

Construction of Subtractive Suppression Hybridization (SSH) Library and Custom Microarrays—We developed a SSH library to obtain an unbiased representation of the gene expression profile resulting shortly after activation of RET/PTC. Briefly, PTC3-5 cells at 90–95% confluence were incubated with H3 medium for 3 days and harvested 12 h after treatment with/without 1 μg/ml doxycycline. Total RNA was isolated from cells using TRIreagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH), and poly(A) RNA using an Oligotex Direct mRNA minikit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) according to the protocols from the respective manufacturers. SSH cDNA libraries were constructed using PCR-Select cDNA subtraction kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Double-stranded cDNA was generated and subjected to digestion with RsaI, following which the doxycycline-treated sample (Tester) was split into two pools. Each pool was ligated with a different adaptor (N1 or N2R). Each ligated double-stranded cDNA pool was then denatured and rehybridized with excess denatured cDNA from cells that had not been treated with doxycycline (Driver). The hybridized pools were mixed, and a second round of hybridization was performed with an excess amount of denatured Driver ([+] library). All procedures were then repeated after switching the samples such that the cDNA from doxycycline-treated cells was the Driver and that from untreated cells was the Tester ([-] library). In each library, the hybridized sequences that contained both adaptors (N1 and N2R) represented the differentially expressed sequences in the Tester. Thus, the [+] library and [-] library contained RET/PTC3-up-regulated and -down-regulated genes, respectively. The hybridized molecules from each pool were subjected to PCR to amplify the specific sequences that contained both adaptors (N1 and N2R). The amplified fragments were then ligated into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and ligated clones introduced into DH10B Escherichia coli cells by electroporation. Single clones were isolated and the libraries titers determined. A number of clones corresponding to 10% of the estimated titer of each library were sequenced using the M13 reverse primer (MWG Biotech, Inc. High Point, NC). The identity of each clone was obtained by blasting its sequence against the NCBI GenBank™ data base using the “Standard Nucleotide-Nucleotide Blast” access. To confirm RET/PTC-dependent expression, we developed custom arrays for hybridization. Inserts were amplified by PCR using primers for the adaptor sequences, and the products precipitated with isopropyl alcohol and resuspended in 3× SSC. PCR products (final concentration = 0.2–1 μg/μl) were then spotted onto poly-l-lysine-coated slides with an OmniGrid Robot (GeneMachines, San Carlos, CA). Slides were processed using the succinic anhydride method (44Schena M. Shalon D. Davis R.W. Brown P.O. Science. 1995; 270: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (7584) Google Scholar) and stored at room temperature in a desiccator cabinet until hybridization. Probes for the cDNA microarrays were generated using 40 μg of total RNA from cells treated with or without doxycycline for 12 h in a standard reverse transcriptase reaction in which some of the dTTP was replaced with either 50 μm Cy3-labeled dUTP or 75 μm Cy5-labeled dUTP (Amersham Biosciences). Dyes were switched so that, in half of the experiments, the doxycycline-treated sample was labeled with Cy3, and, in the other half, it was labeled with Cy5. Probes were cleaned using a QIAquick nucleotide removal kit (Qiagen Inc.) and hybridized to the array overnight at 58 °C in a buffer containing 0.57 μg/μl COT-1 DNA, 0.57 μg/μl (dA)40–60, 0.23 μg/μl yeast tRNA, 3.5× SSC, and 0.3% SDS. Slides were serially washed, dried by centrifugation at room temperature and scanned immediately. Four independent experiments were performed. Slides were scanned with a GenePix 4000A scanner (Axon Instruments, Inc., Foster City, CA) at 532 nm for Cy3 and 635 nm for Cy5. Exogenous plant genes from Arabidopsis thaliana (SpotReport 1–3, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) were included on the array and spiked into the Cy3 and Cy5 probe labeling reactions in equal amounts. Photo multiplier tube voltages for each wavelength were adjusted until the Cy3:Cy5 ratios for these spots averaged 1:1. This process eliminates biases resulting from scanning and from uneven dye incorporation in the labeling reactions. The images were analyzed using GenePix version 2.0 software. The background-subtracted median ratio value was calculated for each spot, and replicate spots on each slide were averaged. Northern Blotting—Northern blotting was performed using total RNA isolated from cells treated with/without 1 μg/ml doxycycline for the indicated times as described (33Oshima M. Murai N. Kargman S.

The following cDNAs were used: a 430-bp fragment corresponding to 30–460 bp of rat mPGES-1 cDNA (NCBI GenBank™, NM_021583), a 783-bp fragment corresponding to 319–1101 bp of putative rat mPGES-2 cDNA (Ensembl, ENSRNOG00000014050), 438 bp of fragment of putative rat cPGES cDNA obtained using the following primers: (5′-ATGCAGCCTGCTTCTGCAAA-3′ and 5′-ATCTGCTCCGTCTACTTCTG-3′), which were designed with mouse cPGES cDNA (NCBI GenBank™, AY281130) and UCSC BLAT Search Rat Genome (genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgBlat), a 691-bp fragment corresponding to 171–861 bp of rat COX-1 cDNA (NCBI GenBank™, S67721) and a 530-bp fragment corresponding to 1358–1887 bp of rat COX-2 cDNA (NCBI GenBank™, S67722), full-length human RET/PTC3, and full-length rat cyclophilin cDNA. Western Blotting—Cells were lysed in cell lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton-X, and proteinase inhibitor mixture (Sigma). After measurement of protein concentration using Coomassie Plus Protein Assay Reagent Kit (PIERCE), 50 μg of each sample was separated by 4–15% SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane. The following primary antibodies were used: anti-COX-1 (murine) polyclonal antibody (Cayman Chemical), anti-COX-2 (murine) polyclonal antibody (Cayman Chemical), mPGES-1 polyclonal antibody (Cayman Chemical), mPGES-2 polyclonal antibody (Cayman Chemical), and anti-p23 monoclonal antibody (Affinity Bioreagents). The antigen-antibody complexes were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Santa Cruz) and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system (Amersham Biosciences). HPLC and LC-MS Analysis of Arachidonic Acid Metabolites—After a 72-h incubation with H3 medium, PTC3-5 cells were treated with or without 1 μg/ml doxycycline for 24 h to induce RET/PTC3, and then labeled with [3H]arachidonic acid (AA) (2 μCi for T75 flask) (PerkinElmer). After a 24-h incubation, the cells were washed with PBS and changed to fresh H3 medium without [3H]AA. After another 48 h, conditioned media was acidified with formic acid (8.6 m, 50 μl for 10 ml of medium) and stored in siliconized tubes at -20 °C until assayed. HPLC analysis was performed as previously described (45Rose M.P. Myatt L. Elder M.G. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Essent. Fatty Acids. 1990; 39: 303-309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Briefly, the acidified medium was loaded onto a prewashed Sep-Pak C18 column and the column washed with distilled water and then with petroleum ether. AA metabolites were eluted with 5 ml of methyl formate and dried using oxygen-free nitrogen. The AA metabolites were then dissolved in 1 ml of solvent 1 (30:70 (v/v) acetonitrile:triethylamine formate (4 × 10-2 m, pH 3.15)) and filtered using a 0.45 μm solvent-resistant filter (Millipore Millex). One milliliter of sample was then injected onto a reverse-phase HPLC column (Fatty Acid Analysis Column, Waters Corp., Milford, MA). The AA metabolites were eluted with a flow rate of 1 ml/min, and transition time between the following solvents was 1 min: 25 min with solvent 1, 25 min with solvent 2 (50:50 (v/v) acetonitrile:triethylamine formate (4 × 10-2 m, pH 3.15)), and 8 min with solvent 3 (acetonitrile).

https://openalex.org/W1985456096,"The heme-regulated phosphodiesterase (PDE) from Escherichia coli (Ec DOS) is a tetrameric protein composed of an N-terminal sensor domain (amino acids 1-201) containing two PAS domains (PAS-A, amino acids 21-84, and PAS-B, amino acids 144-201) and a C-terminal catalytic domain (amino acids 336-799). Heme is bound to the PAS-A domain, and the redox state of the heme iron regulates PDE activity. In our experiments, a H77A mutation and deletion of the PAS-B domain resulted in the loss of heme binding affinity to PAS-A. However, both mutant proteins were still tetrameric and more active than the full-length wild-type enzyme (140% activity compared with full-length wild type), suggesting that heme binding is not essential for catalysis. An N-terminal truncated mutant (ΔN147, amino acids 148-807) containing no PAS-A domain or heme displayed 160% activity compared with full-length wild-type protein, confirming that the heme-bound PAS-A domain is not required for catalytic activity. An analysis of C-terminal truncated mutants led to mapping of the regions responsible for tetramer formation and revealed PDE activity in tetrameric proteins only. Mutations at a putative metal-ion binding site (His-590, His-594) totally abolished PDE activity, suggesting that binding of Mg2+ to the site is essential for catalysis. Interestingly, the addition of the isolated PAS-A domain in the Fe2+ form to the full-length wild-type protein markedly enhanced PDE activity (>5-fold). This activation is probably because of structural changes in the catalytic site as a result of interactions between the isolated PAS-A domain and that of the holoenzyme.

Ec DOS is a heme sensor enzyme, because its PDE activity toward cAMP is regulated by the heme redox state. The enzyme is active in the Fe2+ heme-bound form but inactive in the Fe3+ heme-bound form (1Sasakura Y. Hirata S. Sugiyama S. Suzuki S. Taguchi S. Watanabe M. Matsui T. Sagami I. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23821-23827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Full-length Ec DOS is composed of two domains, an N-terminal sensor domain and a C-terminal catalytic domain. The sensor domain is comprised of two PAS domains designated PAS-A (amino acids 21-84) and PAS-B (amino acids 144-201) (Fig. 1A). PAS is an acronym of Drosophila PER (period clock protein), vertebrate ARNT (aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator), and Drosophila SIM (single-minded protein). To date, more than 1,100 PAS proteins have been identified (2Rutter J. Science. 2002; 298: 1567-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 3Amezcua C.A. Harper S.M. Rutter J. Gardner K.H.

Despite only 30% homology between PAS proteins, PAS proteins exhibit a characteristic three-dimensional structure with a glove-like fold comprising four juxtaposed β-sheets and flanking α-helices (6Jain R.

Heme is bound to the PAS-A domain in Ec DOS. Resonance Raman spectroscopy of the isolated heme-bound PAS-A domain discloses a characteristic heme coordination structure and environment within this enzyme (9Sato A. Sasakura Y. Sugiyama S.

Ec DOS is one of the new types of heme-bound proteins that have recently emerged as heme sensors or heme-regulated enzymes (5Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. IUBMB Life. 2001; 51: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 6Jain R.

Heme sensor enzymes such as soluble guanylate cyclase, FixL (an oxygen sensor heme protein of Rhizobia melilori), CooA (a CO-sensing transcription factor from Rhodospirillum rubrum), and HemAT (a heme-containing aerotaxis transducer from Bacillus subtilis) contain heme-bound domains, and the heme of these enzymes binds gaseous ligands such as NO, CO, and O2, respectively. Ligand binding causes a conformational change in the heme environment that is transduced to a signal. The signal is transmitted to the functional domain following which activities such as guanylate cyclase, kinase, DNA binding, and chemotaxis are initiated or terminated in response. Ec DOS is a novel heme sensor enzyme, because the conformational change in the heme environment essential for signal transduction is induced by the redox state and not the association or dissociation of gaseous ligands, which is typical for other well known heme-sensor enzymes (1Sasakura Y.

The Gilles-Gonzalez group (10Delgado-Nixon V.M. Gonzales G. Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2685-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) previously showed that Ec DOS is a heme-regulated protein, assuming that this enzyme takes advantage of heme as an oxygen sensor, and designated it a “direct oxygen sensor from E. coli” (Ec DOS) based on the physico-chemical character of the isolated heme-bound PAS-A domain. An earlier study by our group showed that Ec DOS has a relatively fast autoxidation rate (1.5 × 10-2 min-1) compared with hemoglobin and myoglobin and that PDE activity is regulated by the heme redox state but not by O2 binding to the heme iron (1Sasakura Y.

Another interesting characteristic is that full-length Ec DOS is tetrameric, whereas the isolated heme-bound PAS-A domain is dimeric. Heme-regulated enzymes such as FixL, CooA, and soluble guanylate cyclases are dimers (6Jain R. Chan M.K. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2003; 8: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 7Hao B.

The well known hemoprotein, hemoglobin, is a tetramer, and O2 affinity is allosterically regulated through the heme-proximal site via interactions between individual monomers (Refs. 12Ackers G.K.

It would be interesting to analyze the role of heme in catalysis, architecture of the tetrameric protein molecule, the specific amino acid(s) or region(s) responsible for tetramer formation, and the mechanism by which the tetrameric state regulates PDE activity. In this study, we generated six deletion mutants, specifically one N-terminal deleted, one PAS-B-deleted, and four C-terminal deleted proteins. A heme binding site mutant, H77A, and putative metal-ion binding site mutants, H590A, H594A, and H590A/H594A, were additionally examined. Relationships between heme binding affinity, tetramer formation ability, and PDE activity for each deletion mutant were studied. The PAS-B domain is necessary to maintain an appropriate heme-surrounding structure of the PAS-A domain. We mapped the regions responsible for tetramer formation, which appear important for catalysis. Our data show that heme binding is not essential for enzyme catalysis. Interestingly, the addition of the isolated heme-bound PAS-A domain in the Fe2+ form to the full-length wild-type protein markedly enhanced PDE activity but did not affect activity of the N-terminal deleted mutant. In this report, we further discuss the role of heme and the tetrameric state of the protein in catalysis. Materials—Oligonucleotides were synthesized at the Nihon Gene Research Laboratory (Sendai, Japan) and ESPEC Oligo Service Corporation (Tokyo, Japan). The cloning vector, pBluescript SK II(+), and an expression vector, pET28a(+), were purchased from Toyobo (Osaka, Japan) and Novagen (Darmstadt, Germany), respectively. E. coli competent cells XL1-Blue (for cloning) and BL21 (for protein expression) were purchased from Novagen and Stratagene (La Jolla, CA), respectively. TaqDNA polymerase, dNTP mixtures, and other compounds necessary for PCR were acquired as a Takara Ex Taq™ kit (Takara Bio Inc., Otsu, Japan). Restriction and modifying enzymes for DNA recombination were purchased from Takara Bio Inc., Toyobo, New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), and Nippon Roche K. K. (Tokyo, Japan).

Calf intestine alkaline phosphatase was purchased from Takara Bio Inc. DEAE-Sephadex was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Other chemicals were acquired from Wako Pure Chemicals. Construction of Expression Plasmids of Ec DOS mutants—Cloning of expression plasmids of the full-length wild-type Ec DOS, wild-type Ec DOS PAS-A, and H77A Ec DOS PAS-A was performed as described in our previous paper (1Sasakura Y.

To construct an expression plasmid for full-length H77A protein, the mutated fragment encoding H77A Ec DOS PAS-A was excised and ligated into the expression plasmid containing the remaining full-length wild-type Ec DOS regions using MunI and SacI sites. pET28a(+)-ΔPAS-B Ec DOS was constructed by digesting Ec DOS at two PstI sites and ligating into the expression plasmid. ΔN147 and C-terminal deletion mutants were constructed by PCR using the primers listed in Table I. To generate ΔN147, the PCR product was digested with SacI and ligated into a cloning vector, pBluescript SKII(+). Following confirmation by sequencing, the appropriate DNA was subcloned into pET28a(+) using SacI. To construct C-terminal deletion mutants, PCR products digested with BamHI and SacI were ligated into pBluescript SKII(+). Plasmids authenticated by DNA sequencing were digested with BamHI and SacI and ligated into the corresponding restriction sites of linearized pET28a(+)-Ec DOS. H590A, H594A, and H590A/H594A mutants were generated with a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene) using pET28a(+)-wild-type Ec DOS as a template.

Proteins were >95% homogenous as confirmed by SDS-PAGE. Yields of Ec DOS and the isolated PAS domain from 1 liter of E. coli culture were 210 and 610 nmol, respectively, in terms of heme absorbance at 417 nm (1Sasakura Y. Hirata S. Sugiyama S. Suzuki S.

Enzymatic Assay—Ec DOS was incubated at 37 °C with 0.1 mm ant-cAMP in a 500-μl reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5) and 2 mm MgCl2 under anaerobic conditions as described previously (1Sasakura Y.

All of the proteins were normalized to a concentration of 0.5 μm. Reduction of the wild-type and mutant proteins was performed by treatment with a trace amount of sodium dithionite. Activities are expressed as nmol product/h/mg protein. At least four experiments were performed to obtain each value. Experimental errors were <20%. Gel Filtration—Gel filtration analyses were performed using the AKTA liquid chromatography system equipped with a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences). The buffer employed for gel filtration of Fe3+ or unreduced protein comprised 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.15 m NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. To determine oligomerization of the full-length wild-type enzyme in the Fe2+ state, protein reduced with excess sodium dithionite was applied to the column equilibrated with the above buffer containing 10 mm sodium dithionite. The molecular masses of the protein peaks were estimated relative to those of standard proteins, specifically ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), and chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa). Optical Absorption Spectra—Spectral experiments under aerobic conditions were performed on Shimadzu UV-1650, UV-2500, and Hitachi U-2010 spectrophotometers maintained at 25 °C with a temperature controller. Anaerobic spectral experiments were conducted on a Shimadzu UV-160A spectrophotometer in a glove box. Following the reduction of heme using sodium dithionite, excess dithionite was removed with a Sephadex G25 column in the glove box. To ensure that the solution temperature was consistent, the reaction mixture was equilibrated in the spectrophotometer for 10 min prior to spectroscopic measurements. Interactions between Full-length Wild-type Protein and the Isolated PAS-A Domain—To examine interactions between full-length wild-type or ΔN147 protein and the isolated PAS-A domain, we performed an in vitro binding assay using Ni-NTA-agarose beads. Full-length wild type and ΔN147 were reduced by treatment with sodium dithionite and incubated in Ni-NTA-agarose equilibrated with a reaction mixture of 500 μl containing 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5), 2 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm cAMP-Na in a microcentrifuge tube on ice for 1 h under anaerobic conditions. The protein-Ni-NTA mixture was packed into a small empty column, and the flow-through was discarded. The (His)6-tag of PAS-A was removed by thrombin digestion and reduced by sodium dithionite treatment. Reduced non-tagged PAS-A was loaded onto the column, which was washed with the same buffer containing 20 mm imidazole to remove unbound proteins. Full-length wild-type/PAS-A binary and ΔN147/PAS-A binary complexes were eluted with the above buffer containing 160 mm imidazole. Non-tagged PAS-A was loaded on a Ni-NTA column in the absence of full-length wild-type or ΔN147 protein. The fraction, eluted with 160 mm imidazole buffer following the above procedure, was additionally analyzed as a negative control to confirm that it does not bind Ni-NTA agarose. All of the steps were performed under anaerobic conditions, similar to enzymatic reactions. The eluate was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Deletion and Site-directed Mutagenesis—We generated deletion and site-directed mutants to determine the role of heme in catalysis and tetramer formation, architecture of the tetrameric protein molecule, the specific amino acid(s) or region(s) responsible for tetramer formation, PDE catalytic site, and the mechanism by which the heme and tetrameric state regulates PDE activity. Six deletion mutants were generated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The PAS-B domain (amino acids 100-246) was deleted in a construct designated ΔPAS-B (Fig. 1A and Table II). A truncated mutant, denoted ΔN147, contained no N-terminal PAS domain (amino acids 148-807). C-terminal truncated mutant proteins (designated A, B, C, and D) contained amino acids 1-401, 1-491, 1-605, and 1-705, respectively. Electrophoresis patterns of these deletion mutant proteins revealed molecular mass positions consistent with those expected from the amino acid sequences (Fig. 1B). We additionally constructed a H77A mutant of the full-length enzyme in view of the finding that the same mutant of the isolated PAS-A domain loses heme binding capability (1Sasakura Y. Hirata S.

H590A, H594A, and H590A/H594A mutants of the full-length enzyme were additionally constructed (Fig. 1B), because His-590 and His-594 are speculated to be metal-ion binding sites based on the amino acid sequence of corresponding human PDE4 (15Xu R.X.

Open table in a new tab Optical Absorption Spectra—To determine whether heme binds to mutant proteins, optical absorption spectra in the near UV (near 280 nm), Soret (near 400 nm), and visible (between 460 and 700 nm) regions were obtained for all of the mutants. Absorption in the Soret and visible regions is ascribed to heme and may therefore be used as a probe of heme binding to the mutant proteins. Because absorption at around 280 nm is attributed to the aromatic amino acids in the protein, the intensity ratio of absorption at 280 and 417 nm was measured to evaluate the amount of heme bound to mutant proteins (Table II). Spectra of the Fe3+ complexes of full-length wild-type protein and non-reduced ΔPAS-B are depicted in Fig. 2. From these spectra, it is clear that heme binds to full-length wild-type enzyme but not to ΔPAS-B. The heme binding abilities of the proteins are summarized in Table II. ΔPAS-B and ΔN147 mutants lost heme binding capability and did not display heme absorption at around 400 nm. The C-terminal truncated mutants (A, B, C, and D) and mutants of metal-ion binding sites (H590A, H594A, and H590A/H594A) efficiently bound heme as calculated from the intensity ratio of absorption at 280 and 417 nm of purified proteins (Table II). As expected, the H77A mutant of full-length protein displayed no heme binding ability, similar to the H77A mutant of isolated PAS-A (data not shown) (1Sasakura Y. Hirata S. Sugiyama S. Suzuki S. Taguchi S. Watanabe M. Matsui T. Sagami I. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23821-23827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Gel Filtration Chromatography—It is important to determine whether the tetrameric state of full-length wild-type protein is disrupted or maintained following extensive deletion and site-directed mutagenesis. We examined the tetramer formation state by gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 3, A and B). Separation between tetramer, dimer, and monomer states was satisfactory under our experimental conditions, and the oligomeric state was thus determined using molecular masses of standard proteins. As summarized in Table II, H77A, ΔPAS-B, ΔN147 A and C, H590A, H594A, and H590A/H594A mutants were tetrameric in the unreduced forms, whereas B and D mutants were monomeric. We additionally examined whether the tetrameric state is conserved in the Fe2+ complex, because the enzyme is active in this state. The full-length wild-type Fe2+ complex was a tetramer, similar to the Fe3+ complex (cf. legend for Fig. 3). PDE Activity—PDE activity is observed when heme is in the Fe2+ state but not when heme is in the Fe3+ state (1Sasakura Y. Hirata S. Sugiyama S. Suzuki S. Taguchi S. Watanabe M. Matsui T. Sagami I. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23821-23827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). However, the heme of Ec DOS is easily oxidized, because autoxidation of heme of full-length Ec DOS is as fast as 1.5 × 10-2 min-1 and the redox potential of heme (of the isolated PAS domain) of Ec DOS is +67 mV (1Sasakura Y.

Therefore, PDE activities were obtained for the full-length wild-type and mutant proteins under anaerobic conditions following reduction of the enzyme with sodium dithionite. The Fe2+ state of heme-bound mutants was maintained during catalysis as confirmed by optical absorption spectra of the final solutions. The H77A mutant, which did not contain heme, displayed PDE activity (140% compared with 100% full-length wild-type enzyme activity) (Table II) under anaerobic conditions. The ΔPAS-B and ΔN147 mutants displayed activities of 140 and 160%, respectively. The C-terminal truncated mutant (c) displayed almost 50% PDE activity compared with the full-length wild-type enzyme. No PDE activity was observed with three other C-terminal truncated mutants, A, B, and D, and metal-ion binding site mutants, H590A, H594A, and H590A/H594A. PDE activities of full-length wild-type and all of the mutant proteins were additionally examined under aerobic conditions in the absence of sodium dithionite. Under these conditions, all of the heme-bound mutants were in the Fe3+ form. The H77A, ΔPAS-B, and ΔN147 mutants displayed 110, 125, and 160% activity, respectively, under aerobic conditions, whereas Fe3+ full-length wild-type enzyme activity was not observed, in contrast to the Fe2+ full-length wild-type enzyme. Effect of the Isolated PAS-A Domain on PDE Activity—To elucidate the role of the PAS-A domain in catalysis, we examined whether PDE activity is affected upon addition of the isolated PAS-A domain. Surprisingly, PDE activity of the full-length wild-type enzyme was markedly increased (5-fold) following incorporation of the isolated Fe2+ PAS-A domain (Fig. 4A). In contrast, PDE activity of the ΔN147 mutant was not altered in the presence of the isolated Fe2+ PAS-A domain (Fig. 4B). Upon addition of the isolated Fe3+ PAS-A domain, full-length wild-type activity was not altered (Fig. 4A), whereas the activity of ΔN147 was abolished (Fig. 4B). With the isolated heme-free PAS-A domain (H77A mutant), activities of both proteins remained unaffected (Figs. 4, A and B). As a control, we examined the effects of bovine serum albumin on PDE activity. The addition of bovine serum albumin to the full-length wild-type and ΔN147 enzymes had no effects on activity, suggesting that PDE activation by the isolated Fe2+ PAS-A domain and catalytic inhibition by the isolated Fe3+ PAS-A domain are specific. We additionally examined the effects of Fe3+ and Fe2+ hemin complexes. No effects of free hemin per se on catalysis by the full-length wild-type protein were observed, suggesting that activation is because of the PAS-A protein molecule containing Fe2+ heme but not hemin itself. We next examined the interactions of full-length wild type or ΔN147 with the isolated PAS-A domain using the batch method as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In each lane, two bands corresponding to full-length wild-type or ΔN147 protein and PAS-A were observed (Fig. 5, lanes 2 and 3). Accordingly, we suggest that Fe2+ PAS-A interacts with both full-length wild-type and ΔN147 proteins that bind to Ni-NTA-agarose beads. Unreduced PAS-A and reduced full-length wild type or ΔN147 did not interact with each other. Therefore, only reduced full-length wild-type and ΔN147 enzymes interact with the isolated Fe2+ PAS-A. Interactions of Fe2+ PAS-A with both proteins are evidently specific, because Fe2+ PAS-A does not bind to Ni-NTA-agarose itself (Fig. 5, lane 4). Effects of the (His)6-tag on Protein Spectra and Activities— Proteins were expressed with the (His)6-tag at the N-terminal end. To determine the effect of (His)6 on spectra and activities, thrombin treatment was performed on full-length wild-type protein to remove the tag. Spectra, oligomeric state, degradation state, and catalytic activity of the full-length wild-type protein in the absence of (His)6-tag were similar to those in the presence of the tag. Heme binding does not correlate with the tetrameric state and PDE activity of Ec DOS. The ΔPAS-B mutant does not contain heme similar to the H77A mutant, suggesting that the PAS-B domain is required to modulate the appropriate structure of PAS-A for maintaining heme binding. Interestingly, under anaerobic conditions, all of the heme-deficient mutants formed tetramers and displayed 140 or 160% activity compared with the full-length wild-type enzyme. Our results indicate that heme binding is not essential for tetramer formation and catalytic activity of Ec DOS. The N-terminal deletion mutant, ΔN147, which does not contain the PAS-A domain, was tetrameric with 160% activity, suggesting that the entire N-terminal domain is not essential for activity. All of the heme-deficient mutants displayed significant activity even under aerobic conditions, whereas no activity was observed with the C-terminal deleted mutants and full-length wild-type enzyme. This reduction had no effect on activity with H77A and heme-deficient mutants. The results suggest that the heme domain containing Fe3+ inhibits catalysis. Moreover, reduction of the heme iron may induce a conformational change that suppresses this inhibition (Fig. 7, A and B). A similar negative effect of heme on the catalysis of soluble guanylate cyclase was reported recently (14Martin E. Sharina I. Kots A. Murad F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9208-9213Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The mutants A, ΔPAS-B, and ΔN147 are oligomeric, suggesting that the PAS-B domain and N-terminal region between positions 100 and 247 are not critical to maintain the tetrameric state of the enzyme and that the region between 247 and 401 is important for tetramerization (Fig. 6). This domain may be crucial to maintain the dimeric form of isolated PAS-A. Amino acid residues necessary for the maintenance of the appropriate tetrameric state appear to be located in two regions, specifically between positions 491 and 605 and positions 705 and 807 (Fig. 6), because mutants B and D are monomeric, whereas mutant C is tetrameric. These two regions may contribute more significantly to overall protein architecture than the PAS-A domain, because deletion of these two regions at the C-terminal site resulted in complete dissociation of the tetramer to monomer. The intensity ratios of absorption at 280 and 417 nm may be used to estimate the extent of heme binding to the protein (Table II). If this ratio is increased upon mutation, heme binding affinity to the protein should be lowered. Among the C-terminal truncated mutants, mutant A with an intensity ratio of 1.4 was still tetrameric. The same ratio was observed for monomeric mutant D. On the other hand, mutant B displayed an intensity ratio of 1.1 (similar to the full-length wild-type ratio of 1.0) but was monomeric. The mutant C with an intensity ratio of 1.2 was tetrameric. H77A and ΔPAS-B contained no heme but were tetramers. Thus, there appears to be no clear relationship between the heme content and oligomeric state. However, the oligomeric states appear to correlate with PDE activity (Table II). Specifically, deletion mutants B and D were monomeric and showed no PDE activity, whereas the tetrameric deletion mutant C exhibited PDE activity. However, the tetrameric deletion mutant A displayed no PDE activity. Accordingly, we propose that the PDE catalytic site is located between residues 402 and 605. The crystal structures of the catalytic domains of several mammalian cAMP and cGMP PDE have been solved (15Xu R.X. Hassell A.M. Vanderwall D. Lambert M.H. Holmes W.D. Luther M.A. Rocque W.J.

Lee T.G. Ro S. Cho J.M. Nature. 2003; 425: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Two histidines in the metal-ion binding motif, HXXXH(X)25-30E, have a critical role in catalysis in mammalian PDE (18Vallee B.L. Auld D.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5647-5659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar, 19Conti M. Jin S.L. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; 63: 1-38Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A model has been proposed from the crystal structure of human cAMP-specific PDE4B2B in which cAMP is bound to histidine in the motif via two metal-ions (either Mg2+ or Mn2+) (15Xu R.X. Hassell A.M. Vanderwall D. Lambert M.H. Holmes W.D. Luther M.A. Rocque W.J. Milburn M.V. Zhao Y. Ke H. Nolte R.T. Science. 2000; 288: 1822-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). In human cGMP-specific PDE5, these conserved histidines are involved in coordinating Mg2+ and Zn2+ and positioning the substrate for efficient catalysis (16Lee M.E. Markowitz J. Lee J.O. Lee H. FEBS Lett. 2002; 530: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Ec DOS requires Mg2+ for catalytic activity (1Sasakura Y. Hirata S. Sugiyama S. Suzuki S. Taguchi S. Watanabe M. Matsui T. Sagami I. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23821-23827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and contains this consensus metal-ion binding motif. Mutation of both or either of the two histidines (His-590 and His-594) in the motif abolishes catalytic activity (Table II). This is not the result of misfolding or denaturing because data from the gel filtration assay indicate that these mutants form tetramers. Therefore, we propose that the two histidines in the motif play an important role in Mg2+ binding and cAMP binding of Ec DOS. At present, it is difficult to interpret the reason why the addition of the isolated Fe2+ PAS-A domain enhances PDE activity of the full-length wild-type protein (Fig. 4A) but not that of ΔN147 (Fig. 4B). The domain containing the Fe3+ heme inhibits catalysis by the C-terminal domain in the holoenzyme. A redox change to Fe2+ heme suppresses this inhibition (Fig. 7A). A further increase in the activity of heme-deficient mutants suggests that Fe3+ heme binding to the N-terminal domain induces unfavorable conformational changes for catalysis. The addition of the isolated PAS-A domain in the Fe2+ form alters the unfavorable conformational structure of the catalytic site in the C-terminal domain created by the covalently bound N-terminal domain, resulting in catalytic activation. Therefore, a specific conformational change of the PDE active site is induced upon binding of the isolated PAS-A domain to full-length wild-type protein (Fig. 7A). A similar negative effect of an isolated PAS domain on the catalysis of serine/threonine kinase was reported previously (4Rutter J. Michnoff C.H. Harper S.M. Gardner K.H. McKnight S.L. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8991-8996Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the isolated PAS-A domain interacts with the ΔN147 mutant lacking the entire N-terminal domain (Fig. 5). Binary complexes of isolated Fe2+ PAS-A and apoPAS-A with the ΔN147 mutant do not affect activity, whereas isolated Fe3+ PAS-A impedes catalysis with the ΔN147 mutant (Figs. 4B and 7B). The solution structure of the PAS kinase N-terminal domain (determined by NMR) implies that regions binding organic compounds (or heme) in the PAS domain and catalytic segments are functionally and structurally linked by a flexible loop between the two segments (3Amezcua C.A. Harper S.M. Rutter J. Gardner K.H. Structure. 2002; 10: 1349-1361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Therefore, direct interactions between the isolated PAS-A domain and catalytic domain in Ec DOS in the presence of excess PAS-A may enhance catalysis via conformational changes distinct from those in the connected enzyme. Crystal structure studies on the FixL heme domains with PAS indicate that binding of oxygen to the distal site of the heme results in structural alterations in the porphyrin ring that are relayed to the FG loop (6Jain R. Chan M.K. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2003; 8: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 7Hao B. Isaza C. Arndt J. Soltis M. Chan M.K.

However, in the present case, it is unlikely that this type of structural change near the heme in the full-length wild-type enzyme occurs to facilitate signal transduction and enhance catalysis. Further studies are required to elucidate the catalytic alterations induced by adding the isolated PAS-A domain to the enzyme. We thank Dr. Hirofumi Kurokawa for valuable suggestions."

Mdm2 amplification in benign tumors suggests that it is not sufficient for p53 inactivation in cancer, implying that other defects in the p53 pathway are required for malignancy. We investigated mechanisms of wtp53 protein inactivation in malignant conversion of epithelial cells by comparing clonally related initiated cells with their derivative cancerous cells that have mdm2 amplification. Deficiencies in p53 accumulation and activities in response to DNA damage were not due simply to Mdm2 destabilization of p53 protein, but to continued association of DNA-bound p53 with Mdm2 protein and lack of binding and acetylation by p300 protein. The aberrant interactions were not because of mdm2 amplification alone, because DNA-bound p53 protein from initiated cells failed to bind ectopically expressed Mdm2 or endogenous overexpressed Mdm2 from cancerous cells. Phosphorylations of endogenous p53 at Ser18, -23, or -37 were insufficient to dissociate Mdm2, because each was induced by UV in cancerous cells. Interestingly, phospho-mimic p53-T21E did dissociate the Mdm2 protein from DNA-bound p53 and recovered p300 binding and p21 induction in the cancerous cells. Thus wtp53 in malignant cells with mdm2 amplification can be inactivated by continued association of DNA-bound p53 protein with Mdm2 and failure of p300 binding and acetylation, coupled with a defect in p53 phosphorylation at Thr21. These findings suggest therapeutic strategies that address both p53/Mdm2 interaction and associated p53 protein defects in human tumors that have amplified mdm2 genes.

These findings suggest therapeutic strategies that address both p53/Mdm2 interaction and associated p53 protein defects in human tumors that have amplified mdm2 genes. p53 protein activity, interaction with other cellular factors, and transcription of genes involved in growth suppression can be abolished by p53 gene mutation and/or defects in p53 signaling pathways. Mutational inactivation of p53 occurs in ∼50% of all human cancers (1Hainaut P. Hernandez T. Robinson A. Rodriguez-Tome P. Flores T. Hollstein M. Harris C.C. Montesano R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar), primarily during the late stages of tumor development, demonstrated by the lack of mutations in most colorectal adenomas and high frequency of p53 mutation in colorectal carcinomas (2Baker S.J. Preisinger A.C. Jessup J.M. Paraskeva C. Markowitz S. Willson J.K. Hamilton S. Vogelstein B. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 7717-7722PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, studies using the two-stage murine skin tumorigenesis model identified a wild type p53 (wtp53) genotype in almost all papillomas and in early well differentiated squamous cell carcinomas produced by chemical carcinogen exposure followed by promotion (3Burns P.A. Kemp C.J. Bannon J.V. Lane D.P. Bremner R. Balmain A. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 2363-2369PubMed Google Scholar, 4Ruggeri B. Caamano J. Goodrow T. DiRado M. Bianchi A. Trono D. Conti C.J. Klein-Szanto A.J. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6615-6621PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations and loss of p53 heterozygosity arose later in ∼50% of moderately or poorly differentiated carcinomas, raising the question of how p53 protein is inactivated in the sporadic epithelial cancers that have wtp53 genes. One mechanism of wtp53 protein inactivation that occurs in the absence of p53 gene mutations is mdm2 gene amplification. Overexpression of Mdm2 protein can result in decreases in p53 protein accumulation and activation by targeting p53 protein for ubiquitin-mediated degradation (5Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3750) Google Scholar), as well as by interfering with the ability of the wtp53 protein to transactivate downstream target genes (6Dumaz N. Meek D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 7002-7010Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Amplification and overexpression of the mdm2 gene and protein is seen in ∼7% of all cancers. Whereas the most common tumors with mdm2 amplification are benign soft tissue sarcomas (20-30%) and osteosarcomas (15-20%), which are commonly chemo-sensitive (7Ferguson W.S. Goorin A.M. Cancer Invest. 2001; 19: 292-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), amplification in malignant epithelial-derived cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer, esophageal squamous cell carcinomas, and breast carcinomas occur at lower frequencies (∼5-15%), generally in the presence of wtp53 (Refs. 8Momand J. Jung D. Wilczynski S. Niland J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3453-3459Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar and 9Momand J. Zambetti G.P. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 343-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar and references therein). The high incidence of mdm2 amplification in benign lesions, and the more aggressive, malignant phenotype displayed by p53-null or mutant tumors with complete p53 protein inactivation, suggests that mdm2 amplification alone is not sufficient for complete inactivation of p53 protein. This implies that epithelial derived tumors with mdm2 amplification that have undergone malignant transformation must harbor an additional defect(s) in wtp53 functional pathways. This observation is consistent with studies using transgenic mice expressing the mdm2 gene from a K14 promoter that targeted the basal layer of the epidermis. These mice displayed increased papilloma formation induced by chemical carcinogenesis (DMBA followed by TPA) and were predisposed to the appearance of premalignant lesions. However, only a small fraction (∼5%) progressed to squamous cell carcinomas (10Ganguli G. Abecassis J. Wasylyk B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5135-5147Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These results imply that tumors overexpressing the Mdm2 protein require further functional inactivation of the wtp53 protein to undergo malignant conversion and underscore the importance of studies focused on the mechanism of p53 loss of function in epithelial cells with amplified mdm2. To identify defects in wtp53 function that contribute to the malignant progression of epithelial tumors with mdm2 gene amplification, two cell lines of common lineage, an aggressive squamous cell carcinoma (03R) (11Kulesz-Martin M. Blumenson L. Lisafeld B. Carcinogenesis. 1986; 7: 1425-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 12Han K.-A. Kulesz-Martin M. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 749-753PubMed Google Scholar) that displays mdm2 gene amplification in the presence of wtp53 genes and its initiated precursor (03C), were analyzed for defects in wtp53 protein activation and function. The p53 functional defect in 03R cells was not because of Mdm2 destabilization of p53 alone, because equalizing levels of p53 protein between 03C and 03R cells by ectopic expression failed to induce p21 expression. Endogenous Mdm2, p300, and p53 proteins isolated from cells exposed to DNA damage were analyzed in vitro for binding to a biotin-labeled DNA probe sequence, revealing a DNA-bound p53-Mdm2 complex in 03R cancer cells that failed to associate with p300, whereas DNA-bound p53 from 03C precancer cells bound p300 but not Mdm2. The overexpression of Mdm2 alone was not responsible for the continued DNA-bound p53-Mdm2 complex, because Mdm2 overexpression in 03C precancer cells did not result in Mdm2 association with DNA-bound p53. The continued association between DNA-bound p53 and Mdm2 was not the result of failed p53 phosphorylation at Ser18, -23, or -37 (Ser15, -20, and -33 in humans, respectively), which all were detected in 03R cancer cells after UV treatment. However, the exogenous expression of p53 protein mimicking phosphorylation at Thr21 (18 in humans) prevented association of Mdm2 with DNA-bound p53, formed a DNA-bound p53-p300 complex, and induced p21 induction in response to DNA damage. This implies that defective phosphorylation of p53 at Thr21 and the aberrant interaction between DNA-bound p53 and Mdm2 that inhibits p300 binding can combine to inactivate wtp53 protein at the malignant conversion stage of epithelial carcinogenesis.

Sequencing of the p53 and mdm2 genes in 03C and 03R cells was performed with three sets of overlapping primers spanning each gene using reverse transcriptase-PCR based methods, as previously described (12Han K.-A. Kulesz-Martin M. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 749-753PubMed Google Scholar). The p53-null NK-1 epidermal cells, obtained from A. Balmain (UCSF, San Francisco, CA), were maintained under the same growth conditions used for 291 cells. Cells in log phase growth (at ∼60% confluency) were treated with 4 gray of IR using a 137Cs source irradiator or 135 J/m2 of ultraviolet B (UV) light, using two Westinghouse FS20T12 sun lamps emitting primarily in the 290-350 nm range.

GFP expression from pEGFP-C1 (constitutive GFP expression from CMV promoter) was used to determine that transfection efficiencies were similar in NK-1, 03C, and 03R cells (25 to 35% of cells). The GFP expression from pEGFP-C1 and the GFP reporter plasmids were analyzed by fluorescent microscopy using an Olympus IX70 microscope (Olympus America Inc.) and Magnafire Mega-Pixel digital camera and imaging and control software (Media Cybernetics). After image analysis, whole cell lysates were prepared from cells transfected with GFP reporter constructs and separated by 9% SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting for p53, GFP, and hsp70 expression. Flow Cytometry—The 03C and 03R cells were harvested 24 h after treatment and fixed using a Cytofix/Cytoperm kit, according to the manufacturer's instructions (BD Pharmingen). Fixed cells were pelleted and stained at 22 °C for 20 min with 5 μg/ml Hoechst (33342 Molecular Probes) in phosphate-buffered saline. Treatments were performed in triplicate and each series profile generated was compiled from ∼20,000 events after gating on single cells. The total cellular DNA content was detected using a FACScan Vantage flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) at the OHSU Flow Cytometry Core Facility. Data were analyzed with WinList 2.0 software (Verity Software House). Colony Formation Assay—Aliquots of viable cells harvested for cell cycle analysis were collected and plated at 300, 1000, and 3000 cells/60-mm dish in triplicate. Twelve days after plating, the cells were fixed with 100% methanol, stained with 10% Giemsa, and colonies were counted. Immunoblotting and Antibodies—Whole cell lysate preparation and immunoblotting were performed, as previously reported (17Wu Y. Huang H. Miner Z. Kulesz-Martin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Briefly, cells were resuspended in 10 volumes of buffer A, incubated on ice for 10 min, and centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C. Cells were then resuspended in 10 volumes of buffer A and subjected to Dounce homogenization. Nuclei were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 5 volumes of buffer B extracted with 300 mm ammonium sulfate (pH 7.5), centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatants were stored at -80 °C. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose or polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (used only for p300). Bound proteins were exposed to specific antibodies to p53 (mixture of PAb122 and PAb242 except where indicated), phosphorylated p53 (p53-Ser18 and p53-Ser23, Cell Signaling Technology; p53-Ser37, E.

PAb242 was obtained from hybridoma PAb242 cells provided by David Lane (University of Dundee, Dundee, Scotland) and PAb122 was obtained from hybridoma PAb122 cells purchased from ATCC. DNA Affinity Immunoblotting—DNA binding was analyzed by DNA affinity immunoblotting (DAI), a sensitive in vitro technique for measurement of endogenous DNA-binding proteins (19Liu Y. Asch H. Kulesz-Martin M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5402-5406PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the p53 consensus binding sequence, 5′-TTCGAGAGGCATGTCTAGGCATGTCT-3′ (hup53), or mutant binding sequence, 5′-TTGAGGTCAGGCAGTGCACTGCAC-3′ (mutp53), and complement were synthesized in the OHSU MMI-RCF, biotin-labeled on one strand with a single biotin residue using 5′ biotin-TEG (Operon, Qiagen), annealed, and used as 26-bp DAI probes. Where indicated, 134-bp DAI probes (p53x2 and p53C) were used to avoid potential steric hindrance between the streptavidin-biotin and the p53-p300 complex. These probes were generated by PCR using plasmids pGFP-p53x2 (specific probe), detailed above, and pGFP-p53C (control probe) (GCTCAAGCTTCGAATTCTTGAGGT- CAGGCAGTGCACTGCACGGCGTCGGCTGTTGAGGTCAGCAGTGCACTGCACTTGAGGTCAGGCAGTGCACTGCACTTCGCTATATATTCCCCGAGCTCCTATCTACACGG, italics indicates sequence changes from p53x2) as templates with biotinylated reverse primer ([Bio-TEG]CCGTGTAGATAGGAGCTCGGG) and forward primer (GCTCAAGCTTCGAATTC). Following PCR amplification the 134-bp probes were visualized by electrophoresis and gel-purified using a gel purification kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). A 200-μg aliquot (unless otherwise indicated) of nuclear extract or whole cell lysate was diluted in 1× DNA binding buffer (DBB) (20 mm Tris (pH 7.2), 1 mm EDTA, and 0.06% Triton X-100 supplemented with 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 μg of salmon sperm DNA) or 1× DBB-NaCl (DBB prepared with 50 mm NaCl and 3% glycerol), respectively, with a final ammonium sulfate/NaCl level equal to 100 mm and glycerol level equal to 7%. Reactions reached steady-state during incubation for 30 min at 4 °C with 60 nm biotin-labeled DNA. DAI studies using extracts from cells exogenously expressing Mdm2 were performed with 100 μg of salmon sperm DNA. The DNA-protein complexes were precipitated for 2 h at 4 °C with 0.1 mg of streptavidin magnasphere paramagnetic particles (Promega), washed with 1× DBB-AS (DBB prepared with 50 mm ammonium sulfate and 3% glycerol) or 1× DBB-NaCl for nuclear or whole cell lysate precipitates, respectively, and analyzed by immunoblotting, as described above. The DNA-bound p53 was quantitated and values were averaged from three independent experiments, utilizing OptiQuant software. To determine -fold increase in p53 bound sequence specifically to DNA, lysates of IR- or UV-treated cells were compared with their respective untreated cell lysates. In addition, DNA-bound p53 was compared with the total p53 protein in an equivalent amount of cell lysate as follows: ((DNA-bound p53/total p53) × 100 = relative p53 DNA binding index (RDB)). Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitation of p53 from whole cell extracts, to analyze association with Mdm2, was carried out as reported previously (20Kulesz-Martin M. Lisafeld B. Huang H. Kisiel N. Lee L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1698-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) using PAb421 monoclonal antibody (1 μg) incubated with lysate overnight at 4 °C. The NaCl was diluted to a final concentration of 125 mm by the addition of 1× DBB. The immune complexes were precipitated with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and detected by immunoblotting for p53 and Mdm2 as described above. Immunoprecipitation of p53 for the detection of phosphorylated and acetylated forms was performed as described above using 1.5 mg of lysate incubated with a mixture of PAb122 and PAb6.2 (21Wu Y. Liu Y. Lee L. Miner Z. Kulesz-Martin M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4823-4830Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) agarose-conjugated antibodies. Activation of Wtp53 Is Compromised in 03R Cancer Cells—We previously reported increased p53 mRNA and decreased immunoprecipitable p53 protein in 03R tumorigenic cells, compared with initiated cell precursor 03C and normal progenitor cell 291, all of which had the wtp53 genotype (12Han K.-A. Kulesz-Martin M. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 749-753PubMed Google Scholar). The p53 gene in initiated 03C and tumorigenic 03R cells was confirmed as wild type in the cells used for these experiments by sequencing as described under “Materials and Methods” (data not shown). To identify the functional consequences of the p53 expression abnormalities, the ability of 03C precancer and 03R cancer cells to undergo G1 cell cycle arrest and suppress colony formation in response to IR or UV treatment was analyzed. The 03C cells induced both G1 growth arrest and suppression of colony formation, whereas 03R cells failed to demonstrate either activity in response to IR or UV treatment (Fig. 1, A-C). Also in response to IR or UV treatment, non-transformed 291 (results were equivalent to 03C and not shown) and initiated 03C cells accumulated p53 protein, as identified by immunoblotting (Fig. 2A, lanes 4-6 and 13-15, respectively), in contrast to 03R cells that failed to accumulate p53 in response to IR (Fig. 2A, lanes 7-9) and accumulated ∼2.5-fold less p53 than 03C cells in response to UV (Fig. 2A, lanes 16-18). The NK-1 (p53-null epidermal keratinocytes) cells displayed no detectable p53 (Fig. 2A, lanes 1-3 and 10-12, respectively), as expected (17Wu Y. Huang H. Miner Z. Kulesz-Martin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8982-8987Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).Fig. 2Accumulation of p53 protein from 03R cells does not lead to transcriptional activation.A, the NK-1 (p53-null), 03C, and 03R cells were harvested before (-) and at the indicated times after IR or UV treatment. Proteins (40 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by direct immunoblotting using antibodies to Mdm2, p53, p21, and hsp70. Fold induction for each protein was determined by densitometry from three independent experiments using OptiQuant software relative to the untreated lysate of each cell type (value of 1) and hsp70 internal loading control. B, the 03C and 03R cells were transiently transfected with either a GFP expressing vector pEGFP-C1 (C1, panels A and B) or a p53-responsive GFP reporter plasmid, pGFP-p53x2 (px2, panels C-F). After transfection with the p53 reporter, cells were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy for expression of GFP before (-) and 5 h after (+) UV treatment. Micrographs shown are of identical fields (including phase contrast) before and after treatment that provide a representative example of the population of transfected cells. C, cellular proteins were isolated from 03C and 03R cells transfected with pGFP-p53x2 (px2) or pGFP-p53Mut (Mut), separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted for expression of p53 and GFP protein in response to UV treatment (n/a, not applicable).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Next the transcriptional activity of p53 in 03C and 03R cells was analyzed by immunoblotting for p21 protein accumulation in response to IR, and by activation of a p53-directed GFP reporter plasmid (15Kaku S. Iwahashi Y. Kuraishi A. Albor A. Yamagishi T. Nakaike S. Kulesz-Martin M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1989-1993Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) in response to UV, because of the p53-independent accumulation of p21 protein in NK-1 cells in response to UV (Fig. 2A, lanes 10-12), as has been previously described (22Haapajarvi T. Kivinen L. Heiskanen A. des Bordes C. Datto M.B. Wang X.F. Laiho M. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 272-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Increases in p53 protein in 03C cells correlated with an increase in p21 protein after IR treatment (Fig. 2A, lanes 4-6) and high levels of GFP expression from the GFP reporter 5 h after UV treatment (Fig. 2B, panel D, and Fig. 2C, lane 6). In contrast, the 03R cells displayed negligible differences in p21 accumulation in response to IR (Fig. 2A, lanes 7-9) and no induction of GFP from the p53-specific reporter in response to UV (Fig. 2B, panel F, and Fig. 2C, lane 8). The 03C and 03R cells demonstrated equal transfection frequencies (∼30%, Fig. 2B, panels A and B), and no GFP expression from the negative control pGFP-Mut (Fig. 2C, lanes 1-4). These results indicate that while p53 protein can accumulate (although at reduced levels) in 03R cells in response to UV treatment, this p53 protein is transcriptionally inactive. Further study of p53 transcriptional activity in the clonal epidermal cell model revealed that increases of p53 protein in 03C cells correlated with an increase in Mdm2 protein after IR and UV treatments (Fig. 2A, lanes 4-6 and 13-15, respectively), whereas no increase in Mdm2 protein occurred in NK-1 cells after treatment (Fig. 2A, lanes 1-3 and 10-12). Induction of Mdm2 was undetectable in 03R lysates (Fig. 2A, lanes 7-9 and 16-18), consistent with the defect in p53 induction in these cells. While not induced by IR or UV, Mdm2 protein in 03R cells was constitutively overexpressed at ∼10-fold higher levels than in 03C (Fig. 2A, compare Mdm2 in lane 7 to lane 4) and was identified as wild type in both 03C and 03R cells by sequencing as described under “Materials and Methods” (data not shown). Southern analysis revealed that the mdm2 gene was amplified in 03R cells ∼14-fold compared with 291 and 03C cells (Supplemental Materials Fig. S2), associating amplification of the mdm2 gene with malignant conversion in the 03R lineage. The overexpression of Mdm2 protein may result in p53 protein functional defects, such as increased destabilization and/or cytoplasmic localization of p53 protein, resulting in transcriptional inactivation. However, mdm2 amplification does not always inactivate wtp53 (23Freedman D. Levine A.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1-7PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that Mdm2 overexpression itself is not responsible for the failed p53 transactivation. Equivalent basal levels of total p53 protein in 03C and 03R cells suggest that the p53 defect in 03R cells is not merely the result of increased Mdm2-directed degradation of p53. Using another approach to address this issue we tested the ability of exogenously overexpressed p53 to recover p21 induction in 03R cells alone or in response to IR. After equalizing the levels of p53 protein between NK-1, 03C, and 03R cells by transient transfection of a murine p53 expression plasmid (Fig. 3, lanes 3-4, 9-10, and 11-12, respectively), p21 protein was induced in response to IR in transfected 03C cells expressing exogenous p53 (Fig. 3, lanes 9 and 10) as in untransfected 03C cells (lanes 5 and 6). The p53-null NK-1 cells overexpressing p53 also displayed a recovery of p21 induction in response to the expression of p53 (Fig. 3, compare lanes 1 and 2 to lanes 3 and 4) indicating that the exogenous p53 protein is capable of transactivation. However, the 03R cells, even in the presence of p53 protein nearly equivalent to that induced by DNA damage in 03C cells, did not recover the ability to induce the p21 protein in response to IR (Fig. 3, lanes 11 and 12). In addition, the inactivation of p53 was not a result of cytoplasmic sequestration as indirect immunofluorescence studies showed endogenous p53 and Mdm2 proteins co-localized in the nucleus in both 03C and 03R cells (Supplemental Materials Fig. S3). These results indicate that Mdm2-mediated destabilization of p53 protein alone is not responsible for the defect in p53 function, implying other functional defects in the malignant conversion of the 03R cancer cells. Aberrant Association of p53 and Mdm2 Proteins during Sequence-specific DNA Binding in 03R Cancer Cells—Another mechanism by which Mdm2 could be inhibiting p53 function is by interfering with the recruitment of p53 co-factors to the DNA-bound p53 protein necessary for efficient p53-directed transactivation. Previously, Jin et al. (24Jin Y. Zeng S.X. Dai M.S. Yang X.J. Lu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30838-30843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) demonstrated Mdm2 association with the p21 promoter in a p53-dependent manner in lung carcinoma H1299 cells, using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. However, Zauberman et al. (25Zauberman A. Barak Y. Ragimov N. Levy N. Oren M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2799-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) have shown that transcriptionally active p53 in the wild type conformation, expressed in normal rat embryonic fibroblasts, binds DNA in the absence of Mdm2, as det"

Second site revertant selection for a G8X mutant, where X is any of the other three natural nucleobases, yielded a family of second site suppressors of the G8U mutant, but not of G8C or G8A, indicating that only G and U can be tolerated at position 8 of the ribozyme. This result is consistent with recent observations that point to the functional importance of G8 N-1 in the chemistry of catalysis by this ribozyme reaction. Suppression of the G8U mutation was observed when changes were made directly across loop A from the mutated base at substrate position +2 or positions +2 and +3 in combination. The same changes made in the context of the natural G8 sequence resulted in a very large drop in activity. Thus, the G8U mutation results in a change in specificity of the ribozyme from 5′-N↓GUC-3′ to 5′-N↓GCU-3′. The results presented imply that G8 interacts directly with U+2 during catalysis. We propose that this interaction favors the correct positioning of the catalytic determinants of G8. The implications for the folding of the ribozyme and the catalytic mechanism are discussed.

The “hairpin” catalytic RNA is a small “self-cleaving” motif involved in resolving RNA multimers and circularizing the monomers generated by the rolling circle replication of the genome of a plant virus satellite RNA associated with satellite tobacco ringspot virus (1Buzayan J.M. Hampel A. Bruening G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 9729-9743Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). It catalyzes both a phosphodiester bond breakage, yielding 5′-OH and 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate termini, and the reverse reaction, RNA ligation. A 50-nucleotide-long enzyme version has been derived that cleaves a 14-nucleotide RNA substrate (Fig. 1) (2Hampel A. Tritz R. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4929-4933Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). The cognate substrate is recognized by base paring to a single-stranded region of the ribozyme called the substrate-binding sequence (SBS). 1The abbreviations used are: SBSsubstrate-binding sequenceHShairpin selectionWTwild-type. This pairing forms the “loop A” domain. The rest of the ribozyme, known as the “loop B” domain, is a 35-nucleotide independently folding domain composed of two helices surrounding an internal loop (loop B) in which six to seven non-Watson-Crick base pairs are formed (3Butcher S.E.

The two domains are stitched together through a ribose zipper between nucleotides 10, 11, 24, and 25; a G+1·C25 Watson-Crick base pair; and minor groove contacts between G11 and U12 and between A22 and A23 mediated through U42 (4Rupert P.B.

The unusual cation dependence of the hairpin ribozyme led to the hypothesis that the reaction was catalyzed directly by RNA functional groups. This was first postulated after the observation that Co(NH3)63+ could replace Mg + without loss of ribozyme activity (17Hampel A. Cowan J.A. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 513-517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 18Nesbitt S. Hegg L.A. Fedor M.J. Chem.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3760-3766Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and was further demonstrated when it was shown that the hairpin ribozyme could function in the absence of multivalent cations (20Murray J.B. Seyhan A.A. Walter N.G. Burke J.M. Scott W.G. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: 587-595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Finally, no divalent cations can be observed in the proximity of the cleavage site in the crystal structure (4Rupert P.B. Ferre-D'Amare A.R. Nature. 2001; 410: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 21Rupert P.B. Massey A.P. Sigurdsson S.T. Ferre-D'Amare A.R. Science. 2002; 298: 1421-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). In contrast, cations are strictly required for docking of the two domains (22Wilson T.J. Lilley D.M. RNA (N. Y.). 2002; 8: 587-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Mutational data, the crystal structure, and nucleotide analog interference modification studies suggest that three nucleotides contained in loop A (G8, A9, and A10) and one nucleotide in loop B (A38) can be directly involved in catalysis (4Rupert P.B. Ferre-D'Amare A.R. Nature. 2001; 410: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 5Fedor M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 269-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 47Ryder S.P. Strobel S.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 295-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Three lines of evidence point to the particular importance of G8. First, its replacement by an abasic site is particularly deleterious for the ribozyme activity (23Lebruska L.L. Kuzmine II Fedor M.J. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 465-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Second, its mutation does not alter the docking of the two domains (24Pinard R. Hampel K.J. Heckman J.E. Lambert D. Chan P.A. Major F. Burke J.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6434-6442Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 25Wilson T.J. Zhao Z.Y. Maxwell K. Kontogiannis L. Lilley D.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2291-2302Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar); and third, two different models give G8 a central role in catalysis (4Rupert P.B. Ferre-D'Amare A.R. Nature. 2001; 410: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 21Rupert P.B. Massey A.P. Sigurdsson S.T. Ferre-D'Amare A.R.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6434-6442Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To better understand the role of and the functional interactions involving this nucleotide, we used in vitro genetics to search for second site suppressors of G8 mutations. Our results suggest that an interaction across loop A is essential to form the active molecule. A detailed analysis of the effect of U+2 and C+3 led us to propose a model in which U+2 would be required to adequately position G8 for catalysis. RNA Preparation—Unlabeled RNAs were transcribed from synthetic oligonucleotides essentially as described (26Milligan J.F. Uhlenbeck O.C. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides (T7 promoter top strand and template; 200 nm each) were transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase at 37 °C for 3 h in the presence of 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 25 mm MgCl2, 2 mm NTP, 1 mm spermidine, and 5 mm dithiothreitol. The precipitate formed during transcription was removed by centrifugation, and RNAs were precipitated. Transcripts were then purified on a7 m urea and 10–20% polyacrylamide gel, eluted by diffusion, ethanolprecipitated, and quantified using a spectrophotometer (assuming optical density of 260 = 37 μg/ml). Prior to 5′-end labeling, RNAs were dephosphorylated for 1 h at 50 °C in the presence of calf intestinal phosphatase (1 unit/50 pmol). RNAs were phenol/chloroform-extracted and ethanol-precipitated. 10 pmol of RNA were then end-labeled using 2 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase and 25 pmol of [γ-32P]ATP (>5000 Ci/mmol). Labeled RNAs were used within 3 days. Self-cleaving constructs were transcribed from linearized plasmid issued by the in vitro selection process essentially as described above, except in the presence of 6 mm MgCl2, 50 μCi of [α-32P]CTP, 0.5 mm CTP, and 1 mm other NTPs. Ribozyme Assays—Preliminary self-cleavage assays of activity were carried out using the hairpin selection (HS) construct (see Fig. 2). Uncleaved RNAs were kept on ice throughout the purification from transcription reactions. They were then resuspended in water, denatured for 1 min at 90 °C, renatured for 20 min on ice, and equilibrated at 37 °C for 20 min. Reactions were initiated by addition of 5× cleavage buffer (final concentrations of 12 mm MgCl2, 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and 2 mm spermidine) equilibrated at 37 °C. 10-μl aliquots were removed at 0, 5, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min, and the reaction was quenched on dry ice by addition of an equal volume of loading buffer containing 10 m urea, 20% sucrose, 0.5% SDS, 0.02% xylene cyanol, 0.02% bromphenol blue, 160 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 160 mm boric acid, and 4 mm EDTA. Single exponential cleavage rates were determined by fitting the results, plotted as ln(unreacted fraction)/time, by linear regression to the equation ln(y) = –kx + b, where y is the unreacted fraction and x is the time. The y intercept (b) was zero for all experimental curve fits. All experiments where repeated twice, yielding similar results. For ligation assays using the HS construct, the 3′-product, a 9-nucleotide fragment corresponding to the sequence from G+1toU+9, was transcribed and dephosphorylated as described above. Internally labeled cleaved molecules from self-cleavage were purified from transcription reactions. The ribozyme 5′-product (30 nm) and 3′-product (3 μm) were mixed in cleavage buffer, denatured for 1 min at 90 °C; and then incubated at a reaction temperature of 0 °C. 10-μl aliquots were removed at 0, 5, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min, and the reaction was quenched with an equal volume of 10 m urea loading buffer. The reaction rates were calculated as described above. Ribozyme Kinetic Analysis with the SV5 Construct—For cleavage assays, 1 μm unlabeled ribozyme strands shown in Fig. 5 and a trace amount of 5′-32P-labeled substrate were mixed together in 50 mm HEPES/NaOH (pH 7) and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. This mixture was allowed to equilibrate to a reaction temperature of 25 °C. Reactions were initiated by combining equal volumes of the RNA mixture with an Mg2+ mixture to give final reaction concentrations of 0.5 μm ribozyme, <1 nm substrate, 15 mm Mg2+, and 50 mm HEPES/NaOH (pH 7). This concentration of ribozyme was found to be saturating for all mutants examined. At least 10 time points were taken for each experiment by quenching aliquots on ice into 10 volumes of 15 mm EDTA, 0.02% (v/v) bromphenol blue, and 0.02% (v/v) xylene cyanol in formamide. Experiments were repeated at least three times for each mutant. The experimental variation in these experiments did not exceed 20% of the reaction rates or amplitudes. Ligation kinetic analyses were carried out following the same general scheme using the SV5 construct shown in Fig. 5. The concentration of ribozyme and 3′-product was 12 μm. Increasing the concentrations of unlabeled RNA by 2-fold did not result in faster ligation kinetics. The 5′-32P-labeled 5′-cleavage product was generated by ribozyme cleavage of the labeled substrate of a four-way helical junction construct called FWS (27Walter N.G. Burke J.M. Millar D.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 544-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The 5′-cleavage product was purified on a 20% (v/v) acrylamide gel. The FWS substrate was employed specifically to improve recovery of the labeled 5′-cleavage product. The rate for ligation of the FWS 5′- and 3′-products was found to be identical, within error, to that obtained for the same ribozyme and a shortened 5′-product (data not shown). Native Gel Electrophoresis—The docking ability of the wild-type sequence and mutants was determined by gel shift assay as described previously (12Hampel K.J. Burke J.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3723-3729Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) without modification. The affinity between the substrate and the isolated SBS was determined by gel shift assay as described previously (9Esteban J.A. Banerjee A.R. Burke J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13629-13639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 28Sargueil B. Pecchia D.B. Burke J.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7739-7748Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 29Fedor M.J. Uhlenbeck O.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1668-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The substrate sequence was 5′-UGACAGUCCUGUUU-3′, and the SBS sequence was 5′-AAACAGAGAAGUCA-3′. A constant low amount of 5′-end-labeled substrate (0.1 nm) was mixed with increasing concentrations of unlabeled SBS in cleavage buffer, denatured for 1 min at 90 °C, and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. Incubation times up to 16 h did not significantly change the result in the case of the wild-type (WT) sequences, showing that equilibrium was reached in <2 h. Free substrate and complex were separated on a 15% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 40 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.5) and 12 mm magnesium acetate for 13 h at 4 °C. Bound and unbound species were quantified by phosphorimaging using a Bio-Rad GS-250 Molecular Imager instrument. The fraction of bound substrate was normalized to the value of maximum binding. Kd values were then obtained from a nonlinear least-square fit according to an equation describing theoretical bimolecular association (30Pyle A.M. Green J.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2716-2725Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) using SigmaPlot software (Jandel Scientific). The S.E. was calculated from the fit of the observed curve to the theoretical one (reported by the SigmaPlot software). All gel shifts were repeated at least twice. It should be noted that the substrate resolved as a single species consistent with a single-stranded monomer under the conditions used. In Vitro Selection—The second site reversion mutants were isolated using a slightly adapted protocol from the in vitro selection system described previously (31Berzal-Herranz A. Joseph S. Burke J.M. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Briefly, the template for transcription was generated by annealing and extension of two overlapping DNA oligonucleotides: a 74-mer containing the coding sequences for a T7 promoter, a primer-binding site, and part of the ribozyme sequence (5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGTACGCTCCGAGCTCTAGAAACAGA(A/T/C)AANNCAACCAGAGAAACACACGTTGTGGT-3′) and a 63-mer representing the antisense sequences for the rest of the ribozyme, an 8-nucleotide linker, the substrate, and a second primer-biding site (primer P3) (5′-GCGCACTGCAGTCTAGAAAACAGGACTNNCAGAGATCTGTACCAGGTAAT(G/A)TACCACAACGTG-3′) (overlapping sequences are in boldface; underlined nucleotides were mutagenized to frequencies of 0.88 for the wild type and 0.12 for the other 3 nucleotides). 400 pmol of double-stranded template were transcribed for 3 h. The transcription mixture was phenol/chloroform-extracted, and the RNA was precipitated. To increase the opportunity for molecules to self-cleave, the reaction was incubated for an addition hour in 1 ml of cleavage buffer at 37 °C after a denaturation step (1 min at 90 °C). Cleaved and uncleaved products were purified on a 7 m urea and 8% polyacrylamide gel. The ligation reaction was carried out by incubating at 0 °C for 30 min the active self-cleaved fraction with 3 μm DNA-RNA oligonucleotide representing the ribozyme cleavage product linked to a specific sequence complementary to primer P2 (5′-GUCCUGUUUTCTAGAGACGCCTCGTG-3′). The ligated molecules were isolated on a 7 m urea and 8% polyacrylamide gel, reverse-transcribed, and amplified by PCR as described (31Berzal-Herranz A. Joseph S. Burke J.M. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) using two primers: P1, 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGTACGCTCCGAGCTC-3′; and P2, 5′-CACGAGGCGTCTCTAGA-3′. Inactive molecules were reverse-transcribed and amplified with primers P2 and P3 (5′-GCGCACTGCAGTCTAGA-3′). Molecular Modeling—Models of the ribozyme catalytic core were generated using the constraint satisfaction program MC-SYM (32Major F. Turcotte M. Gautheret D. Lapalme G. Fillion E. Cedergren R. Science. 1991; 253: 1255-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 33Major F. Griffey R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 282-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The structural constraints used to generate the MC-SYM script were derived from data generated in this work, from previously published cross-linking studies (15Pinard R. Lambert D. Walter N.G. Heckman J.E. Major F. Burke J.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16035-16039Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 24Pinard R. Hampel K.J. Heckman J.E. Lambert D. Chan P.A. Major F. Burke J.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6434-6442Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and from crystallographic data (4Rupert P.B. Ferre-D'Amare A.R. Nature. 2001; 410: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). A-form RNA was assumed for all Watson-Crick helices, and the sugar puckers conformations and glycosyl angles for all nucleotides in loop A and for residues 24, 25, and 38 in loop B were assigned according to the crystallographic data (4Rupert P.B. Ferre-D'Amare A.R. Nature. 2001; 410: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Solutions that were similar (root mean square deviation ≤ 2 Å) were combined by MC-SYM. Resulting structures were energy-minimized through molecular mechanics calculations performed by the molecular simulation program Sander from the Amber 7 suite of programs (34Pearlman D. Case D. Caldwell J. Ross W. Cheatman T. Computer Physics Communications. Vol. 91. University of California, San Francisco1995: 1-41Google Scholar) using the Amber 2002 force field for RNA. All one to four electrostatic interactions were set to a factor of 1.2, and the distance-dependent dielectric model (ϵ = 4Rij) for the coulombic representation of electrostatic interactions was used. As a first step, energy minimization was performed using the steepest descent for 100 steps, and then the conjugate gradient method was applied until the maximum derivative was <0.001 kcal/mol/Å. Figures were prepared using MolScript (35Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar). Root mean square deviation calculations were performed using MC-RMS from the MC-SYM package. Identification of Second Site Suppressors of a Mutation in the Substrate-binding Strand—The SBS contains four nucleotides essential for optimum activity as defined by in vitro selection and directed mutagenesis (36Anderson P. Monforte J. Tritz R. Nesbitt S. Hearst J. Hampel A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1096-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 37Berzal-Herranz A. Joseph S. Chowrira B.M. Butcher S.E. Burke J.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2567-2573Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 38Shippy R. Siwkowski A. Hampel A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 564-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Substitutions at G8 result in loss of activity of 3–4 orders of magnitude (24Pinard R. Hampel K.J. Heckman J.E. Lambert D. Chan P.A. Major F. Burke J.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6434-6442Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 25Wilson T.J. Zhao Z.Y. Maxwell K. Kontogiannis L. Lilley D.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2291-2302Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 38Shippy R. Siwkowski A. Hampel A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 564-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To define the role of this nucleotide and thus to better understand the function of the SBS, we selected for active molecules with a mutation of G8. A previously described in vitro selection method (31Berzal-Herranz A. Joseph S. Burke J.M. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) was adapted to identify second site suppressors of a given mutation (8Sargueil B. McKenna J. Burke J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32157-32166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 39Sargueil B. Burke J.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 1997; 74: 289-300PubMed Google Scholar). To be selected, the self-cleaving version of the ribozyme (HS construct) (Fig. 2) must self-cleave during transcription and subsequently catalyze its ligation to a specific 3′-product sequence. The 3′-product sequence is subsequently used as a reverse transcriptase primer-binding site, and PCR is employed to amplify the active molecules (Fig. 2). To prevent the appearance of revertants to the WT sequence, we carried the molecules through only one round of selection. We have therefore limited the complexity of the starting pool to recover active molecules with few changes to easily identify the suppressive mutations. The starting pool was mutagenized as follows. G8 was systematically mutated to A, U, or C; all other catalytically important nucleotides were lightly mutagenized for an average of two mutations per molecule; and the two important base pairs (G11-C–2 and U12-A–3) were randomized to maximize the potential for base pairing. Finally, because the U39C mutation has previously been identified as a general enhancer (29Fedor M.J. Uhlenbeck O.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1668-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 37Berzal-Herranz A. Joseph S. Chowrira B.M. Butcher S.E. Burke J.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2567-2573Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 40Joseph S. Burke J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24515-24518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), U39 was synthesized to be equally U or C (Fig. 2). The full repertoire of this design yields ∼106 different molecules (41Green R. Ellington A.D. Bartel D.P. Szostak J.W. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1991; 2: 75-86Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We transcribed 1014 template molecules, thus ensuring that we would screen the entire sequence space. After one round of selection, we sequenced 10 active molecules. All of these were mutated at G8 and had two mutations across loop A at C+3 and U+2 in the substrate. Two of these also had the A7U mutation. A preliminary characterization of the self-cleavage efficiency of these molecules revealed two classes of revertants (Fig. 3). The first class was ∼20-fold less active than the WT construct, and all molecules had the G8U mutation and two suppressive mutations: U+2C/C+3U (clones 1 and 18) or U+2A/C+3A (clones 2 and 20). The catalytic efficiency of the second class was reduced by at least 200-fold. These molecules were mutated at the same sites as the first class, but no obvious consensus sequence could be observed. Clones 20 and 2 are identical, except for the A7U transversion present in the latter. They showed the same rate of cleavage, but only 10% of the molecules from clone 2 were able to self-cleave (this result was observed with two different RNA preparations). Our interpretation of this result is that the A7U mutation induces incorrect folding, resulting in a large portion of the population being inactive. Therefore, we did not further study the effect of mutations at position 7. Because the ribozymes with the triple mutation G8U/U+2C/C+3U were the most active, this set of mutations was chosen for the following experiments. We also sequenced 10 inactive molecules. These showed four or more mutations at the expected conserved sites, but also at U39, which was a C in half of the molecules. Nevertheless, U39C was selected in the active molecules, which raises the possibility that U39 has a more specific effect on the loop A mutants. For this reason, we quantified the effect of mutations of U39 on the rate of cleavage of molecules with the triple mutation G8U/U+2C/C+3U. The identity of the nucleotide at this position had only a modest effect: A39 was 2-fold more active than U39 or C39, and mutation to G39 resulted in a 2-fold decrease in activity (data not shown). Because we used RNA-catalyzed ligation in the selection procedure, we performed preliminary ligation assays with the HS construct to confirm the specificity and efficiency of the suppression of the double mutation U+2C/C+3U on G8U mutants. As shown in Fig. 4, the G8U ribozyme was inactive in the presence of a WT 3′-product, but did catalyze its ligation to a U+2C/C+3U 3′-product. Conversely, the WT ribozyme was unable to utilize the U+2C/C+3U product, but self-ligated the WT product efficiently. Comparison of the ligation rates of these mutants shows that the U+2C/C+3U mutations conferred at least a 100-fold improvement in self-ligation by G8U mutant ribozymes compared with the WT substrate (data not shown). WT ribozyme self-ligation to the U+2C/C+3U product was at least a 2000-fold decreased compared with self-ligation to the WT product. The ligation rate of the G8U/U+2C/C+3U revertant was 20-fold less efficient than that of the WT molecule. Combined Effect of Mutations of G8, U+2, and C+3—We further characterized the mutant and revertant constructs in a well described kinetic model, the SV5 hairpin construct, which is also resistant to many mutations that penalize docking performance (43Butcher S.E. Heckman J.E. Burke J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29648-29651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). 2R. Pinard, K. J. Hampel, J. E. Heckman, and J. M. Burke, unpublished data. The cleavage and ligation results from this study are presented in Table I. Our results from cleavage kinetic analyses show that the G8U mutant could be rescued to some extent by the U+2C change and to a greater extent by addition of the C+3U change. In addition, we have observed that the poor cleavage activity of a ribozyme with a xanthosine base at position 8 could be rescued by these same mutations (data not shown). Because the Watson-Crick faces of U and X are identical, this result argues that the rescue is dependent upon structure formation using one or more of the functional groups along the Watson-Crick face of the base. G8A and G8C mutant ribozymes were at least 103 less active than the WT sequence in trans-cleavage assays and showed no preference for specific substrate sequences (data not shown). Using the WT ribozyme, we observed a very large 103-fold decrease in cleavage activity with the U+2C/C+3U mutations in the substrate (Table I). The ligation kinetics of this mutant fit to a strong double exponential equation with fast and slow phases 21- and 650-fold slower than those of the WT ribozyme and accounting for 20 and 80% of the product formation, respectively. This effect was also observed when the single mutation U+2C was tested. Overall, the ligation data, which were best fit to a double exponential equation, demonstrate that the U8 mutation could be rescued to some extent by the U+2C change. Interestingly, the U8/U+2 var"
