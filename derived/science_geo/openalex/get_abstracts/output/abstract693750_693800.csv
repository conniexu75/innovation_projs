https://openalex.org/W4280488965,"Abstract SARS-CoV-2 Delta and Omicron are globally relevant variants of concern. Although individuals infected with Delta are at risk of developing severe lung disease, infection with Omicron often causes milder symptoms, especially in vaccinated individuals 1,2 . The question arises of whether widespread Omicron infections could lead to future cross-variant protection, accelerating the end of the pandemic. Here we show that without vaccination, infection with Omicron induces a limited humoral immune response in mice and humans. Sera from mice overexpressing the human ACE2 receptor and infected with Omicron neutralize only Omicron, but not other variants of concern, whereas broader cross-variant neutralization was observed after WA1 and Delta infections. Unlike WA1 and Delta, Omicron replicates to low levels in the lungs and brains of infected animals, leading to mild disease with reduced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and diminished activation of lung-resident T cells. Sera from individuals who were unvaccinated and infected with Omicron show the same limited neutralization of only Omicron itself. By contrast, Omicron breakthrough infections induce overall higher neutralization titres against all variants of concern. Our results demonstrate that Omicron infection enhances pre-existing immunity elicited by vaccines but, on its own, may not confer broad protection against non-Omicron variants in unvaccinated individuals."
https://openalex.org/W4280617936,"Microcombs have sparked a surge of applications over the past decade, ranging from optical communications to metrology1-4. Despite their diverse deployment, most microcomb-based systems rely on a large amount of bulky elements and equipment to fulfil their desired functions, which is complicated, expensive and power consuming. By contrast, foundry-based silicon photonics (SiPh) has had remarkable success in providing versatile functionality in a scalable and low-cost manner5-7, but its available chip-based light sources lack the capacity for parallelization, which limits the scope of SiPh applications. Here we combine these two technologies by using a power-efficient and operationally simple aluminium-gallium-arsenide-on-insulator microcomb source to drive complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor SiPh engines. We present two important chip-scale photonic systems for optical data transmission and microwave photonics, respectively. A microcomb-based integrated photonic data link is demonstrated, based on a pulse-amplitude four-level modulation scheme with a two-terabit-per-second aggregate rate, and a highly reconfigurable microwave photonic filter with a high level of integration is constructed using a time-stretch approach. Such synergy of a microcomb and SiPh integrated components is an essential step towards the next generation of fully integrated photonic systems."
https://openalex.org/W4280565406,"Cancer metastasis requires the transient activation of cellular programs enabling dissemination and seeding in distant organs1. Genetic, transcriptional and translational heterogeneity contributes to this dynamic process2,3. Metabolic heterogeneity has also been observed4, yet its role in cancer progression is less explored. Here we find that the loss of phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) potentiates metastatic dissemination. Specifically, we find that heterogeneous or low PHGDH expression in primary tumours of patients with breast cancer is associated with decreased metastasis-free survival time. In mice, circulating tumour cells and early metastatic lesions are enriched with Phgdhlow cancer cells, and silencing Phgdh in primary tumours increases metastasis formation. Mechanistically, Phgdh interacts with the glycolytic enzyme phosphofructokinase, and the loss of this interaction activates the hexosamine-sialic acid pathway, which provides precursors for protein glycosylation. As a consequence, aberrant protein glycosylation occurs, including increased sialylation of integrin αvβ3, which potentiates cell migration and invasion. Inhibition of sialylation counteracts the metastatic ability of Phgdhlow cancer cells. In conclusion, although the catalytic activity of PHGDH supports cancer cell proliferation, low PHGDH protein expression non-catalytically potentiates cancer dissemination and metastasis formation. Thus, the presence of PHDGH heterogeneity in primary tumours could be considered a sign of tumour aggressiveness."
https://openalex.org/W4280510947,"Eukaryotic genomes are compacted into loops and topologically associating domains (TADs)1-3, which contribute to transcription, recombination and genomic stability4,5. Cohesin extrudes DNA into loops that are thought to lengthen until CTCF boundaries are encountered6-12. Little is known about whether loop extrusion is impeded by DNA-bound machines. Here we show that the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) complex is a barrier that restricts loop extrusion in G1 phase. Single-nucleus Hi-C (high-resolution chromosome conformation capture) of mouse zygotes reveals that MCM loading reduces CTCF-anchored loops and decreases TAD boundary insulation, which suggests that loop extrusion is impeded before reaching CTCF. This effect extends to HCT116 cells, in which MCMs affect the number of CTCF-anchored loops and gene expression. Simulations suggest that MCMs are abundant, randomly positioned and partially permeable barriers. Single-molecule imaging shows that MCMs are physical barriers that frequently constrain cohesin translocation in vitro. Notably, chimeric yeast MCMs that contain a cohesin-interaction motif from human MCM3 induce cohesin pausing, indicating that MCMs are 'active' barriers with binding sites. These findings raise the possibility that cohesin can arrive by loop extrusion at MCMs, which determine the genomic sites at which sister chromatid cohesion is established. On the basis of in vivo, in silico and in vitro data, we conclude that distinct loop extrusion barriers shape the three-dimensional genome."
https://openalex.org/W4280591490,"Chain reactions, characterized by initiation, propagation and termination, are stochastic at microscopic scales and underlie vital chemical (for example, combustion engines), nuclear and biotechnological (for example, polymerase chain reaction) applications1–5. At macroscopic scales, chain reactions are deterministic and limited to applications for entertainment and art such as falling dominoes and Rube Goldberg machines. On the other hand, the microfluidic lab-on-a-chip (also called a micro-total analysis system)6,7 was visualized as an integrated chip, akin to microelectronic integrated circuits, yet in practice remains dependent on cumbersome peripherals, connections and a computer for automation8–11. Capillary microfluidics integrate energy supply and flow control onto a single chip by using capillary phenomena, but programmability remains rudimentary with at most a handful (eight) operations possible12–19. Here we introduce the microfluidic chain reaction (MCR) as the conditional, structurally programmed propagation of capillary flow events. Monolithic chips integrating a MCR are three-dimensionally printed, and powered by the free energy of a paper pump, autonomously execute liquid handling algorithms step-by-step. With MCR, we automated (1) the sequential release of 300 aliquots across chained, interconnected chips, (2) a protocol for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies detection in saliva and (3) a thrombin generation assay by continuous subsampling and analysis of coagulation-activated plasma with parallel operations including timers, iterative cycles of synchronous flow and stop-flow operations. MCRs are untethered from and unencumbered by peripherals, encode programs structurally in situ and can form a frugal, versatile, bona fide lab-on-a-chip with wide-ranging applications in liquid handling and point-of-care diagnostics.

https://openalex.org/W4280550201,"Cultivated oat (Avena sativa L.) is an allohexaploid (AACCDD, 2n = 6x = 42) thought to have been domesticated more than 3,000 years ago while growing as a weed in wheat, emmer and barley fields in Anatolia1,2. Oat has a low carbon footprint, substantial health benefits and the potential to replace animal-based food products. However, the lack of a fully annotated reference genome has hampered efforts to deconvolute its complex evolutionary history and functional gene dynamics. Here we present a high-quality reference genome of A. sativa and close relatives of its diploid (Avena longiglumis, AA, 2n = 14) and tetraploid (Avena insularis, CCDD, 2n = 4x = 28) progenitors. We reveal the mosaic structure of the oat genome, trace large-scale genomic reorganizations in the polyploidization history of oat and illustrate a breeding barrier associated with the genome architecture of oat. We showcase detailed analyses of gene families implicated in human health and nutrition, which adds to the evidence supporting oat safety in gluten-free diets, and we perform mapping-by-sequencing of an agronomic trait related to water-use efficiency. This resource for the Avena genus will help to leverage knowledge from other cereal genomes, improve understanding of basic oat biology and accelerate genomics-assisted breeding and reanalysis of quantitative trait studies."
https://openalex.org/W4280525746,"Chromosome replication is performed by a complex and intricate ensemble of proteins termed the replisome, where the DNA polymerases Polδ and Polε, DNA polymerase α-primase (Polα) and accessory proteins including AND-1, CLASPIN and TIMELESS-TIPIN (respectively known as Ctf4, Mrc1 and Tof1-Csm3 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae) are organized around the CDC45-MCM-GINS (CMG) replicative helicase1-7. Because a functional human replisome has not been reconstituted from purified proteins, how these factors contribute to human DNA replication and whether additional proteins are required for optimal DNA synthesis are poorly understood. Here we report the biochemical reconstitution of human replisomes that perform fast and efficient DNA replication using 11 purified human replication factors made from 43 polypeptides. Polε, but not Polδ, is crucial for optimal leading-strand synthesis. Unexpectedly, Polε-mediated leading-strand replication is highly dependent on the sliding-clamp processivity factor PCNA and the alternative clamp loader complex CTF18-RFC. We show how CLASPIN and TIMELESS-TIPIN contribute to replisome progression and demonstrate that, in contrast to the budding yeast replisome8, AND-1 directly augments leading-strand replication. Moreover, although AND-1 binds to Polα9,10, the interaction is dispensable for lagging-strand replication, indicating that Polα is functionally recruited via an AND-1-independent mechanism for priming in the human replisome. Collectively, our work reveals how the human replisome achieves fast and efficient leading-strand and lagging-strand DNA replication, and provides a powerful system for future studies of the human replisome and its interactions with other DNA metabolic processes."

https://openalex.org/W3161558623,"Bound states in the continuum (BICs)1-3 are peculiar topological states that, when realized in a planar photonic crystal lattice, are symmetry-protected from radiating in the far field despite lying within the light cone4. These BICs possess an invariant topological charge given by the winding number of the polarization vectors5, similar to vortices in quantum fluids such as superfluid helium and atomic Bose-Einstein condensates. In spite of several reports of optical BICs in patterned dielectric slabs with evidence of lasing, their potential as topologically protected states with theoretically infinite lifetime has not yet been fully exploited. Here we show non-equilibrium Bose-Einstein condensation of polaritons-hybrid light-matter excitations-occurring in a BIC thanks to its peculiar non-radiative nature, which favours polariton accumulation. The combination of the ultralong BIC lifetime and the tight confinement of the waveguide geometry enables the achievement of an extremely low threshold density for condensation, which is reached not in the dispersion minimum but at a saddle point in reciprocal space. By bridging bosonic condensation and symmetry-protected radiation eigenmodes, we reveal ways of imparting topological properties onto macroscopic quantum states with unexplored dispersion features. Such an observation may open a route towards energy-efficient polariton condensation in cost-effective integrated devices, ultimately suited for the development of hybrid light-matter optical circuits."
https://openalex.org/W4280603009,"Zinc (Zn) is an essential micronutrient and cofactor for up to 10% of proteins in living organisms. During Zn limitation, specialized enzymes called metallochaperones are predicted to allocate Zn to specific metalloproteins. This function has been putatively assigned to G3E GTPase COG0523 proteins, yet no Zn metallochaperone has been experimentally identified in any organism. Here, we functionally characterize a family of COG0523 proteins that is conserved across vertebrates. We identify Zn metalloprotease methionine aminopeptidase 1 (METAP1) as a COG0523 client, leading to the redesignation of this group of COG0523 proteins as the Zn-regulated GTPase metalloprotein activator (ZNG1) family. Using biochemical, structural, genetic, and pharmacological approaches across evolutionarily divergent models, including zebrafish and mice, we demonstrate a critical role for ZNG1 proteins in regulating cellular Zn homeostasis. Collectively, these data reveal the existence of a family of Zn metallochaperones and assign ZNG1 an important role for intracellular Zn trafficking."
https://openalex.org/W4280507422,"Diabetes mellitus is prevalent among women of reproductive age, and many women are left undiagnosed or untreated1. Gestational diabetes has profound and enduring effects on the long-term health of the offspring2,3. However, the link between pregestational diabetes and disease risk into adulthood in the next generation has not been sufficiently investigated. Here we show that pregestational hyperglycaemia renders the offspring more vulnerable to glucose intolerance. The expression of TET3 dioxygenase, responsible for 5-methylcytosine oxidation and DNA demethylation in the zygote4, is reduced in oocytes from a mouse model of hyperglycaemia (HG mice) and humans with diabetes. Insufficient demethylation by oocyte TET3 contributes to hypermethylation at the paternal alleles of several insulin secretion genes, including the glucokinase gene (Gck), that persists from zygote to adult, promoting impaired glucose homeostasis largely owing to the defect in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Consistent with these findings, mouse progenies derived from the oocytes of maternal heterozygous and homozygous Tet3 deletion display glucose intolerance and epigenetic abnormalities similar to those from the oocytes of HG mice. Moreover, the expression of exogenous Tet3 mRNA in oocytes from HG mice ameliorates the maternal effect in offspring. Thus, our observations suggest an environment-sensitive window in oocyte development that confers predisposition to glucose intolerance in the next generation through TET3 insufficiency rather than through a direct perturbation of the oocyte epigenome. This finding suggests a potential benefit of pre-conception interventions in mothers to protect the health of offspring. Pregestational hyperglycaemia in mothers increases the probability of glucose intolerance in the offspring, an effect controlled by TET3-dependent DNA demethylation of genes involved in insulin secretion."
https://openalex.org/W3193094050,"Substantial leaps in the understanding of quantum systems have been driven by exploring geometry, topology, dimensionality and interactions in ultracold atomic ensembles1-6. A system where atoms evolve while confined on an ellipsoidal surface represents a heretofore unexplored geometry and topology. Realizing an ultracold bubble-potentially Bose-Einstein condensed-relates to areas of interest including quantized-vortex flow constrained to a closed surface topology, collective modes and self-interference via bubble expansion7-17. Large ultracold bubbles, created by inflating smaller condensates, directly tie into Hubble-analogue expansion physics18-20. Here we report observations from the NASA Cold Atom Lab21 facility onboard the International Space Station of bubbles of ultracold atoms created using a radiofrequency-dressing protocol. We observe bubble configurations of varying size and initial temperature, and explore bubble thermodynamics, demonstrating substantial cooling associated with inflation. We achieve partial coverings of bubble traps greater than one millimetre in size with ultracold films of inferred few-micrometre thickness, and we observe the dynamics of shell structures projected into free-evolving harmonic confinement. The observations are among the first measurements made with ultracold atoms in space, using perpetual freefall to explore quantum systems that are prohibitively difficult to create on Earth. This work heralds future studies (in orbital microgravity) of the Bose-Einstein condensed bubble, the character of its excitations and the role of topology in its evolution."
https://openalex.org/W4280492587,"The ultra-diffuse galaxies DF2 and DF4 in the NGC 1052 group share several unusual properties: they both have large sizes1, rich populations of overluminous and large globular clusters2-6, and very low velocity dispersions that indicate little or no dark matter7-10. It has been suggested that these galaxies were formed in the aftermath of high-velocity collisions of gas-rich galaxies11-13, events that resemble the collision that created the bullet cluster14 but on much smaller scales. The gas separates from the dark matter in the collision and subsequent star formation leads to the formation of one or more dark-matter-free galaxies12. Here we show that the present-day line-of-sight distances and radial velocities of DF2 and DF4 are consistent with their joint formation in the aftermath of a single bullet-dwarf collision, around eight billion years ago. Moreover, we find that DF2 and DF4 are part of an apparent linear substructure of seven to eleven large, low-luminosity objects. We propose that these all originated in the same event, forming a trail of dark-matter-free galaxies that is roughly more than two megaparsecs long and angled 7° ± 2° from the line of sight. We also tentatively identify the highly dark-matter-dominated remnants of the two progenitor galaxies that are expected11 at the leading edges of the trail."
https://openalex.org/W4280545664,"New particle formation in the upper free troposphere is a major global source of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN)1-4. However, the precursor vapours that drive the process are not well understood. With experiments performed under upper tropospheric conditions in the CERN CLOUD chamber, we show that nitric acid, sulfuric acid and ammonia form particles synergistically, at rates that are orders of magnitude faster than those from any two of the three components. The importance of this mechanism depends on the availability of ammonia, which was previously thought to be efficiently scavenged by cloud droplets during convection. However, surprisingly high concentrations of ammonia and ammonium nitrate have recently been observed in the upper troposphere over the Asian monsoon region5,6. Once particles have formed, co-condensation of ammonia and abundant nitric acid alone is sufficient to drive rapid growth to CCN sizes with only trace sulfate. Moreover, our measurements show that these CCN are also highly efficient ice nucleating particles-comparable to desert dust. Our model simulations confirm that ammonia is efficiently convected aloft during the Asian monsoon, driving rapid, multi-acid HNO3-H2SO4-NH3 nucleation in the upper troposphere and producing ice nucleating particles that spread across the mid-latitude Northern Hemisphere."
https://openalex.org/W4280573309,"In particle collider experiments, elementary particle interactions with large momentum transfer produce quarks and gluons (known as partons) whose evolution is governed by the strong force, as described by the theory of quantum chromodynamics (QCD)1. These partons subsequently emit further partons in a process that can be described as a parton shower2, which culminates in the formation of detectable hadrons. Studying the pattern of the parton shower is one of the key experimental tools for testing QCD. This pattern is expected to depend on the mass of the initiating parton, through a phenomenon known as the dead-cone effect, which predicts a suppression of the gluon spectrum emitted by a heavy quark of mass mQ and energy E, within a cone of angular size mQ/E around the emitter3. Previously, a direct observation of the dead-cone effect in QCD had not been possible, owing to the challenge of reconstructing the cascading quarks and gluons from the experimentally accessible hadrons. We report the direct observation of the QCD dead cone by using new iterative declustering techniques4,5 to reconstruct the parton shower of charm quarks. This result confirms a fundamental feature of QCD. Furthermore, the measurement of a dead-cone angle constitutes a direct experimental observation of the non-zero mass of the charm quark, which is a fundamental constant in the standard model of particle physics."
https://openalex.org/W4280489039,"Atoms with a highly excited electron, called Rydberg atoms, can form unusual types of molecular bonds1-4. The bonds differ from the well-known ionic and covalent bonds5,6 not only by their binding mechanisms, but also by their bond lengths ranging up to several micrometres. Here we observe a new type of molecular ion based on the interaction between the ionic charge and a flipping-induced dipole of a Rydberg atom with a bond length of several micrometres. We measure the vibrational spectrum and spatially resolve the bond length and the angular alignment of the molecule using a high-resolution ion microscope7. As a consequence of the large bond length, the molecular dynamics is extremely slow. These results pave the way for future studies of spatio-temporal effects in molecular dynamics (for example, beyond Born-Oppenheimer physics)."
https://openalex.org/W4280530964,"Inhibitory neurons (INs) consist of distinct subtypes with unique functions. Previous studies on INs mainly focused on single brain regions, and thus it remains unclear whether the modulation of IN subtypes occurs globally across multiple regions. Here, we monitored the activity of different cortical IN subtypes at both macroscale and microscale in mice learning a lever-press task. Learning evoked a global modulation of IN subtypes throughout the cortex. The initial learning phase involved strong activation of vasoactive intestinal peptide-expressing INs (VIP-INs) and weak activation of somatostatin-expressing INs (SOM-INs). Inactivating VIP-INs increased SOM-IN activity and impaired initial learning. Concurrently, cortical cholinergic inputs from the basal forebrain were initially more active but became less engaged over learning. Manipulation of the cholinergic system impaired motor learning and differentially altered activity of IN subtypes. These results reveal that motor learning involves a global and subtype-specific modulation on cortical INs regulated by the cholinergic system."
https://openalex.org/W4280504532,"Imbalances in lipid homeostasis can have deleterious effects on health1,2. Yet how cells sense metabolic demand due to lipid depletion and respond by increasing nutrient absorption remains unclear. Here we describe a mechanism for intracellular lipid surveillance in Caenorhabditis elegans that involves transcriptional inactivation of the nuclear hormone receptor NHR-49 through its cytosolic sequestration to endocytic vesicles via geranylgeranyl conjugation to the small G protein RAB-11.1. Defective de novo isoprenoid synthesis caused by lipid depletion limits RAB-11.1 geranylgeranylation, which promotes nuclear translocation of NHR-49 and activation of rab-11.2 transcription to enhance transporter residency at the plasma membrane. Thus, we identify a critical lipid sensed by the cell, its conjugated G protein, and the nuclear receptor whose dynamic interactions enable cells to sense metabolic demand due to lipid depletion and respond by increasing nutrient absorption and lipid metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W4280613531,"We study changes in social distancing and government policy in response to local outbreaks during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using aggregated county-level data from approximately 20 million smartphones in the United States, we show that social distancing behaviors have responded to local outbreaks: a 1% increase in new cases (deaths) is associated with a 3% (11%) increase in social distancing intensity. Responsiveness is reinforced by the presence of public measures restricting movements, but remains significant in their absence. Responsiveness is higher in high-income, more educated, or Democrat-leaning counties, and in counties with low health insurance coverage. By contrast, social capital and vulnerability to infection are strongly associated with more social distancing but not with more responsiveness. Our results point to the importance of politics, trust and reciprocity for compliance with social distancing, while material constraints are more critical for being responsive to new risks such as the emergence of variants."
https://openalex.org/W4280564909,"Background Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and some focal cortical dysplasias (FCDs) are associated with dysfunctional mTOR signaling, resulting in increased cell growth and ribosomal S6 protein phosphorylation (phospho-S6). mTOR inhibitors can reduce TSC tumor growth and seizure frequency, and preclinical FCD studies indicate seizure suppression. This pilot study evaluated safety of mTOR inhibitor everolimus in treatment resistant (failure of &gt;2 anti-seizure medications) TSC and FCD patients undergoing surgical resection and to assess mTOR signaling and molecular pathways. Methods and findings We evaluated everolimus in 14 treatment resistant epilepsy patients undergoing surgical resection (4.5 mg/m 2 daily for 7 days; n = 4 Active, mean age 18.3 years, range 4–26; n = 10, Control, mean age 13.1, range 3–45). Everolimus was well tolerated. Mean plasma everolimus in Active participants were in target range (12.4 ng/ml). Brain phospho-S6 was similar in Active and Control participants with a lower trend in Active participants, with Ser235/236 1.19-fold (p = 0.67) and Ser240/244 1.15-fold lower (p = 0.66). Histologically, Ser235/236 was 1.56-fold (p = 0.37) and Ser240/244 was 5.55-fold lower (p = 0.22). Brain proteomics identified 11 proteins at &lt;15% false discovery rate associated with coagulation system (p = 1.45x10 -9 ) and acute phase response (p = 1.23x10 -6 ) activation. A weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) of brain proteomics and phospho-S6 identified 5 significant modules. Higher phospho-S6 correlated negatively with cellular respiration and synaptic transmission and positively with organophosphate metabolic process, nuclear mRNA catabolic process, and neuron ensheathment. Brain metabolomics identified 14 increased features in Active participants, including N-acetylaspartylglutamic acid. Plasma proteomics and cytokine analyses revealed no differences. Conclusions Short-term everolimus before epilepsy surgery in TSC and FCD resulted in no adverse events and trending lower mTOR signaling (phospho-S6). Future studies should evaluate implications of our findings, including coagulation system activation and everolimus efficacy in FCD, in larger studies with long-term treatment to better understand molecular and clinical effects.

https://openalex.org/W4280533712,"The evolutionary origin of vertebrates included innovations in sensory processing associated with the acquisition of a predatory lifestyle1. Vertebrates perceive external stimuli through sensory systems serviced by cranial sensory ganglia, whose neurons arise predominantly from cranial placodes; however, the understanding of the evolutionary origin of placodes and cranial sensory ganglia is hampered by the anatomical differences between living lineages and the difficulty in assigning homology between cell types and structures. Here we show that the homeobox transcription factor Hmx is a constitutive component of vertebrate sensory ganglion development and that in the tunicate Ciona intestinalis, Hmx is necessary and sufficient to drive the differentiation programme of bipolar tail neurons, cells previously thought to be homologues of neural crest2,3. Using Ciona and lamprey transgenesis, we demonstrate that a unique, tandemly duplicated enhancer pair regulated Hmx expression in the stem-vertebrate lineage. We also show notably robust vertebrate Hmx enhancer function in Ciona, demonstrating that deep conservation of the upstream regulatory network spans the evolutionary origin of vertebrates. These experiments demonstrate regulatory and functional conservation between Ciona and vertebrate Hmx, and point to bipolar tail neurons as homologues of cranial sensory ganglia. In the tunicate Ciona intestinalis, the homeobox transcription factor Hmx drives differentiation of bipolar tail neurons, indicating conserved regulation and function, and homology with cranial sensory ganglia in higher vertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W4280604390,"Objectives To explore if the COVID-19 pandemic revealed differences across racial groups in coping, resilience, and optimism, all of which have implications for health and mental well-being. Methods We collect data obtained from four rounds of a national sample of 5,000 US survey respondents in each round from April 2020 to February 2021. Using logistic regression and fixed effects models, we estimate the pandemic impacts on COVID-19 related concerns, social distancing behaviors, and mental health/life satisfaction and optimism for racial/income groups. Results Despite extreme income and health disparities before and during the COVID-19 outbreak, Blacks and Hispanics remain more resilient and optimistic than their White counterparts. Moreover, the greatest difference in resilience, optimism and better mental health—is found between poor Blacks and poor Whites, a difference that persists through all four rounds. Conclusions These deep differences in resilience have implications for the long-term mental health of different population groups in the face of an unprecedented pandemic. Better understanding these dynamics may provide lessons on how to preserve mental health in the face of public health and other large-scale crises."
https://openalex.org/W4280523768,"Cellular iron homeostasis is vital and maintained through tight regulation of iron import, efflux, storage and detoxification1-3. The most common modes of iron storage use proteinaceous compartments, such as ferritins and related proteins4,5. Although lipid-bounded iron compartments have also been described, the basis for their formation and function remains unknown6,7. Here we focus on one such compartment, herein named the 'ferrosome', that was previously observed in the anaerobic bacterium Desulfovibrio magneticus6. Using a proteomic approach, we identify three ferrosome-associated (Fez) proteins that are responsible for forming ferrosomes in D. magneticus. Fez proteins are encoded in a putative operon and include FezB, a P1B-6-ATPase found in phylogenetically and metabolically diverse species of bacteria and archaea. We show that two other bacterial species, Rhodopseudomonas palustris and Shewanella putrefaciens, make ferrosomes through the action of their six-gene fez operon. Additionally, we find that fez operons are sufficient for ferrosome formation in foreign hosts. Using S. putrefaciens as a model, we show that ferrosomes probably have a role in the anaerobic adaptation to iron starvation. Overall, this work establishes ferrosomes as a new class of iron storage organelles and sets the stage for studying their formation and structure in diverse microorganisms."
https://openalex.org/W4280556763,"Proper ectodermal patterning during human development requires previously identified transcription factors such as GATA3 and p63, as well as positional signalling from regional mesoderm1–6. However, the mechanism by which ectoderm and mesoderm factors act to stably pattern gene expression and lineage commitment remains unclear. Here we identify the protein Gibbin, encoded by the Xia–Gibbs AT-hook DNA-binding-motif-containing 1 (AHDC1) disease gene7–9, as a key regulator of early epithelial morphogenesis. We find that enhancer- or promoter-bound Gibbin interacts with dozens of sequence-specific zinc-finger transcription factors and methyl-CpG-binding proteins to regulate the expression of mesoderm genes. The loss of Gibbin causes an increase in DNA methylation at GATA3-dependent mesodermal genes, resulting in a loss of signalling between developing dermal and epidermal cell types. Notably, Gibbin-mutant human embryonic stem-cell-derived skin organoids lack dermal maturation, resulting in p63-expressing basal cells that possess defective keratinocyte stratification. In vivo chimeric CRISPR mouse mutants reveal a spectrum of Gibbin-dependent developmental patterning defects affecting craniofacial structure, abdominal wall closure and epidermal stratification that mirror patient phenotypes. Our results indicate that the patterning phenotypes seen in Xia–Gibbs and related syndromes derive from abnormal mesoderm maturation as a result of gene-specific DNA methylation decisions. Characterization of Gibbin, encoded by AHDC1, offers insights into the epidermal and mesodermal patterning phenotypes seen in Xia–Gibbs and related syndromes in humans, which derive from abnormal mesoderm maturation as a result of gene-specific DNA methylation decisions."

Such pencil beams do not constrain the physical extent of the systems. Here, we report integral-field spectroscopy of a bright, gravitationally lensed galaxy at a redshift of 2.7 with two foreground damped Lyman-${\alpha}$ systems.

https://openalex.org/W4280586986,"Increasing acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines is imperative for public health. Previous research on educational interventions to overcome vaccine hesitancy have shown mixed effects in increasing vaccination intention, although much of this work has focused on parental attitudes toward childhood vaccination. In this study, we conducted a randomized controlled trial to investigate whether vaccination intention changes after viewing an animated YouTube video explaining how COVID-19 mRNA vaccines work. We exposed participants to one of four interventions–watching the video with a male narrator, watching the same video with a female narrator, reading the text of the transcript of the video, or receiving no information (control group). We found that participants who watched the version of the video with a male narrator expressed statistically significant increased vaccination intention compared to the control group. The video with a female narrator had more variation in results. As a whole, there was a non-significant increased vaccination intention when analyzing all participants who saw the video with a female narrator; however, for politically conservative participants there was decreased vaccination intention for this intervention compared to the control group at a threshold between being currently undecided and expressing probable interest. These results are encouraging for the ability of interventions as simple as YouTube videos to increase vaccination propensity, although the inconsistent response to the video with a female narrator demonstrates the potential for bias to affect how certain groups respond to different messengers."

The present study makes an attempt to identify the concentration of species among tree diversity in Mahavir Swami Wildlife Sanctuary, Bundelkhand, India. Four important ecological indicator indices namely Shannon-Weiner index (H'), Simpson's diversity (D), Margalef index (SR) and Pielou's (J) indices were make the most for species diversity measurement. The research outcomes revealed that Shannon-Weiner diversity index (H/) was found to be the best index for assessing species richness while Simpson's diversity (D) index was more suited for determining species diversity. The Shannon-Weiner index value calculated for different transects not only represent the species richness but also the species evenness in each transect. The potential application of forest diversity can be used a mechanism for forest management. The methodology will retrofit better policy implementation for maintaining the health of forest species in Mahavir Swami Wildlife Sanctuary and can be applied on other reserve forest of socio-ecological significance."
https://openalex.org/W4280489005,"Fermentation of pasture grasses and grains in the rumen of dairy cows and other ruminants produces methane as a by-product, wasting energy and contributing to the atmospheric load of greenhouse gasses. Many feeding trials in farmed ruminants have tested the impact of dietary components on feed efficiency, productivity and methane yield (MeY). Such diets remodel the rumen microbiome, altering bacterial, archaeal, fungal and protozoan populations, with an altered fermentation outcome. In dairy cows, some dietary grains can reduce enteric methane production. This is especially true of wheat, in comparison to corn or barley. Using a feeding trial of cows fed rolled wheat, corn or barley grain, in combination with hay and canola, we identified wheat-associated changes in the ruminal microbiome. Ruminal methane production, pH and VFA concentration data together with 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequences were used to compare ruminal bacterial and archaeal populations across diets. Differential abundance analysis of clustered sequences (OTU) identified members of the bacterial families Lachnospiraceae, Acidaminococcaceae, Eubacteriaceae, Prevotellaceae, Selenomonadaceae, Anaerovoracaceae and Fibrobacteraceae having a strong preference for growth in wheat-fed cows. Within the methanogenic archaea, (at >99% 16S rRNA sequence identity) the growth of Methanobrevibacter millerae was favoured by the non-wheat diets, while Methanobrevibacter olleyae was unaffected. From the wheat-preferring bacteria, correlation analysis found OTU strongly linked to reduced MeY, reduced pH and raised propionic acid levels. OTU from the genera Shuttleworthia and Prevotella_7 and especially Selenomonadaceae had high anti-methane correlations. An OTU likely representing (100% sequence identity) the fumarate-reducing, hydrogen-utilising, rumen bacterium Mitsuokella jalaludinii, had an especially high negative correlation coefficient (-0.83) versus MeY and moderate correlation (-0.6) with rumen pH, strongly suggesting much of the MeY suppression is due to reduced hydrogen availablity. Other OTU, representing as yet unknown species from the Selenomonadaceae family and the genera Prevotella_7, Fibrobacter and Syntrophococcus also had high to moderate negative MeY correlations, but low correlation with pH. These latter likely represent bacterial species able to reduce MeY without causing greater ruminal acidity, making them excellent candidates, provided they can be isolated, for development as anti-methane probiotics."
https://openalex.org/W4280522445,"The COVID-19 pandemic has been characterized by a social media ""infodemic"": an overabundance of information whose authenticity may not always be guaranteed. With the potential to lead individuals to harmful decisions for the society, this infodemic represents a severe threat to information security, public health and democracy. In this paper, we assess the interplay between the infodemic and specific aspects of the pandemic, such as the number of cases, the strictness of containment measures, and the news media coverage. We perform a comparative study on three countries that employed different managements of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020-namely Italy, the United Kingdom, and New Zealand. We first analyze the three countries from an epidemiological perspective to characterize the impact of the pandemic and the strictness of the restrictions adopted. Then, we collect a total of 6 million posts from Facebook to describe user news consumption behaviors with respect to the reliability of such posts. Finally, we quantify the relationship between the number of posts published in each of the three countries and the number of confirmed cases, the strictness of the restrictions adopted, and the online news media coverage about the pandemic. Our results show that posts referring to reliable sources are consistently predominant in the news circulation, and that users engage more with reliable posts rather than with posts referring to questionable sources. Furthermore, our modelling results suggest that factors related to the epidemiological and informational ecosystems can serve as proxies to assess the evolution of the infodemic."
https://openalex.org/W4280552058,"Involving members of the public in image classification tasks that can be tricky to automate is increasingly recognized as a way to complete large amounts of these tasks and promote citizen involvement in science. While this labor is usually provided for free, it is still limited, making it important for researchers to use volunteer contributions as efficiently as possible. Using volunteer labor efficiently becomes complicated when individual tasks are assigned to multiple volunteers to increase confidence that the correct classification has been reached. In this paper, we develop a system to decide when enough information has been accumulated to confidently declare an image to be classified and remove it from circulation. We use a Bayesian approach to estimate the posterior distribution of the mean rating in a binary image classification task. Tasks are removed from circulation when user-defined certainty thresholds are reached. We demonstrate this process using a set of over 4.5 million unique classifications by 2783 volunteers of over 190,000 images assessed for the presence/absence of cropland. If the system outlined here had been implemented in the original data collection campaign, it would have eliminated the need for 59.4% of volunteer ratings. Had this effort been applied to new tasks, it would have allowed an estimated 2.46 times as many images to have been classified with the same amount of labor, demonstrating the power of this method to make more efficient use of limited volunteer contributions. To simplify implementation of this method by other investigators, we provide cutoff value combinations for one set of confidence levels."
https://openalex.org/W4280568274,"Testosterone undecanoate is a hormone agent with long-acting potential and is used for testosterone replacement therapy for hypogonadism. This study was designed to investigate application of testosterone undecanoate in maintaining high androgen levels for inducing benign prostatic hyperplasia more conveniently than that for testosterone propionate. We conducted two-part studies to determine the optimal dosage and dosing cycle for efficient and stable induction of benign prostatic hyperplasia using testosterone undecanoate. In the injection dosage substudy, single testosterone undecanoate dose (125, 250, 500, 750, or 1000 mg/kg body weight) was administered, and the optimal concentration was determined for 8weeks by measuring changes in testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, and 5-alpha reductase levels. And then, testosterone undecanoate was administered at the optimal dose at intervals of 1, 2, 3, or 4 weeks for 12weeks to induce benign prostatic hyperplasia. The injection dosage substudy showed dose-dependently higher and more stable levels of testosterone in groups administrated testosterone undecanoate than in groups administered testosterone propionate. In the injection cycle substudy, testosterone undecanoate-administered group stably maintained high levels of testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, and 5-alpha reductase compared with testosterone propionate-administered group for the same injection cycle; moreover, the prostate measurements, an important sign of benign prostatic hyperplasia, were significantly increased. Based on these two substudies, we determined the optimal conditions for inducing benign prostatic hyperplasia stably and more conveniently than that for testosterone propionate. This study suggests an extended application of testosterone undecanoate for inducing benign prostatic hyperplasia that can improve research reliability considering the half-life of testosterone as well as injection dosage and concentration."
https://openalex.org/W4280568516,"Background In the past years, we observed a sharp increase of Syphilis, especially among male who have sex with male (MSM), either HIV-infected, or on pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Our aim was to assess syphilis prevalence and incidence among people living with HIV (PLWH) and PrEP users. Methods PLWH were included from 2010 to 2020 and PrEP users from 2016 to 2020 from the Dat’AIDS French cohort. We calculated syphilis prevalence and incidences for first infections, re-infections, and iterative infections (&gt; 2 times). T-Tests, Wilcoxon tests and Chi2 test were used for descriptive analysis and multivariate logistic regression models were used to estimate Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for factors associated with syphilis. Results Among the 8 583 PLWH, prevalence of subject with past or present syphilis was 19.9%. These subjects were more likely MSM or transgender and aged over 35 years, but prevalence was lower in AIDS subjects. Same pattern was seen for incident infection and re-infection. Incidence was 3.8 per 100 person-years for infection and 6.5 per 100 person-years for re-infection. Among 1 680 PrEP users, syphilis prevalence was 25.8%, with an estimated 7.2% frequency of active syphilis. Risk of syphilis infection was higher in male and increased with age. Incidence was 11.2 per 100 person-years for infection and 11.1 per 100 person-years for re-infection. Conclusion Syphilis prevalence and incidence were high, especially in older MSM with controlled HIV infection and PrEP users, enhancing the need to improve syphilis screening and behavioral risk reduction counseling among high-risk subjects."
https://openalex.org/W4280587211,"Tragulids, chevrotains or mouse deer, were common faunal elements during the Miocene. During that time, Dorcatherium was the most abundant genus, with D. naui being the first described species. Besides their abundance, until recently only very limited cranial material was available for investigation. Here we present a redescription of the first complete skull of D. naui from the middle to late Miocene locality of Eppelsheim, Germany, based on micro-computed tomography. Furthermore, we present a description and comparison of two additional, new skulls of D. naui from the late Miocene hominid locality Hammerschmiede, Germany. Within Dorcatherium, so far, only three other complete skulls are known, all belonging to D. crassum. A comparison between the three skulls of D. naui and the already known skulls of D. crassum shows that these two species differ in morphological features of the skull, such as laterally facing orbitae, separation of supraorbital foramen from supraorbital groove by a bony bridge, well-developed parietal plateau, prominent nuchal tubercle, less-developed nuchal crests, and the presence of an occipital crest. Moreover, two different osteological morphotypes are present in the skulls of D. naui that can be interpreted as a previously unknown sexual dimorphism. Very similar features are observed in D. crassum, which can be likewise related to the same dimorphism. However, males of D. naui differ from males of D. crassum by the presence of frontoparietal bulges, which were probably used for sexual display and during male-male combats in males of D. naui. For the first time, sexual dimorphism in Dorcatherium is described based on skull characteristics, which are, so far, unknown from any other fossil or extant tragulid."
https://openalex.org/W4280609760,"Sigma-1 receptor (Sig1R) is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-related membrane protein, that forms heteromers with other cellular proteins. As the mechanism of action of this chaperone protein remains unclear, the aim of the present study was to detect and analyze the intracellular dynamics of Sig1R in live cells using super-resolution imaging microscopy. For that, the Sig1R-yellow fluorescent protein conjugate (Sig1R-YFP) together with fluorescent markers of cell organelles were transfected into human ovarian adenocarcinoma (SK-OV-3) cells with BacMam technology. Sig1R-YFP was found to be located mainly in the nuclear envelope and in both tubular and vesicular structures of the ER but was not detected in the plasma membrane, even after activation of Sig1R with agonists. The super-resolution radial fluctuations approach (SRRF) performed with a highly inclined and laminated optical sheet (HILO) fluorescence microscope indicated substantial overlap of Sig1R-YFP spots with KDEL-mRFP, slight overlap with pmKate2-mito and no overlap with the markers of endosomes, peroxisomes, lysosomes, or caveolae. Activation of Sig1R with (+)-pentazocine caused a time-dependent decrease in the overlap between Sig1R-YFP and KDEL-mRFP, indicating that the activation of Sig1R decreases its colocalization with the marker of vesicular ER and does not cause comprehensive translocations of Sig1R in cells."
https://openalex.org/W4280621066,"Over the last decades, microalgae have gained popularity due to demand for novel environmental green solutions and development of innovative mass-production sources for multiple processes, including animal feed and human diet, turning microalgae into an exquisite candidate for several ecofriendly technologies. Notwithstanding, there is a catch. Most species of microalgae, as the case of common Chlorella vulgaris (C. vulgaris) display a recalcitrant cell wall, characterized by a complex matrix of polysaccharides and glycoproteins, which constitutes a major barrier for monogastric species digestibility and extraction of inner valuable nutritional compounds. To overcome this limitation, the development of feed enzymes, in particular Carbohydrate-Active enZymes (CAZymes) with capacity to disrupt C. vulgaris cell wall may contribute to improve the bioavailability of these microalgae compounds in monogastric diets, namely at high levels of incorporation. In order to disclosure novel combination of feed enzymes to disrupt C. vulgaris cell wall, a lab protocol was implemented by our research team containing the following key steps: after microalgae cultivation and having available a repertoire of two hundred pre-selected CAZymes produced by high-throughput technology, the step 1 is the individual screening of the most functional enzymes on disrupting C. vulgaris cell wall (versus a control, defined as the microalgae suspension incubated with PBS) and the determination of reducing sugars released by the 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNSA) method; step 2 concerns on finding the best CAZymes cocktail, testing the synergistic effect of enzymes, to disrupt C. vulgaris cell wall (in parallel with running the control) along with characterization of each enzyme thermostability and resistance to proteolytic attack, to which feed enzymes are subjected in the animal gastrointestinal tract; step 3 is the assessment of C. vulgaris cell wall degradation degree by measuring the amount of reducing sugars released by the DNSA method, fatty acid analysis by gas chromatography (GC) with flame ionization detector (FID), oligosaccharides quantification by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) equipped with an electrochemical detector (ECD), protein content by the Kjeldahl method, and various pigments (chlorophylls a and b, and total carotenoids) in the supernatant. In the correspondent residue, we also assessed cellular counting using a Neubauer chamber by direct observation on a bright-field microscope and fluorescence intensity, after staining with Calcofluor White for both control and CAZymes cocktail treatments, on a fluorescence microscope. Beyond animal feed industry with impact on human nutrition, our lab protocol may increase the yield in obtaining valued constituents from C. vulgaris microalga for other biotechnological industries."
https://openalex.org/W4280518150,"The practice of wet nursing or breastfeeding another woman's child in Malaysia, especially among Muslim mothers, is on the rise. This is due to the emergence of public awareness of the benefits of breast milk to children. However, it is claimed that some mothers do not have a clear understanding of the Islamic rulings concerning wet nursing, especially those related to mahram (prohibition to marry), nasab (lineage) and inheritance. Hence, the purpose of this study is to examine the level of understanding of the legal implications of wet nursing and the factors influencing the practice among Muslim mothers who have practiced breastfeeding.This was a cross-sectional descriptive study that was conducted between January and July 2019. This study was conducted with 100 Muslim mothers who had breastfed others' child(ren) in Selangor. Data were obtained using a validated questionnaire (Cronbach's alpha = 0.8) and processed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software.The results show that the majority of the respondents understand the basic Islamic rulings on wet nursing, especially on the persons prohibited to marry, conditions and feeding method. However, the respondents need to further understand the rulings related to nasab (lineage), guardianship and inheritance involving the milk child. Various factors that have influenced wet nursing in society were also found.This study has significant implications for the need to have more activities to create awareness and enhance the understanding related to wet nursing among Muslim women in society. Therefore, more research studies related to wet nursing and the impact of the practice should be conducted to offer better solutions to society."
https://openalex.org/W4280598768,"Background Postmenopausal breast cancer (PMBC) is the most commonly diagnosed and the second leading cause of cancer death among women in the US. Research examining the association between PMBC and education level has been inconsistent; no study in the US has examined how educational level impacts PMBC mortality in Asian American women, a largely immigrant population with above-average educational attainment. Methods California Vital Statistics data from 2012–2017 were analyzed to derive age-adjusted mortality rate ratios (MRRs) by education level (associates degree or above referred to as “higher education”, high school, less than high school) and race [Non-Hispanic White (NHW), Asian/Pacific Islander (Asian), and its two largest subpopulations: Chinese and Filipino] from negative binomial regression models. Results PMBC mortality for both NHWs and Asians was greater among women with higher education compared to those who did not complete high school: NHWs had 22% higher PMBC mortality (MRR 1.22; 95% CI: 1.14–1.31) and Asians had 2.6 times greater PMBC mortality (MRR 2.64; 95% CI: 2.32–3.00) than their counterparts who did not complete high school. Asians in the lowest education level had 70% lower mortality than NHWs (MRR 0.30; 95% CI: 0.27–0.34). This mortality advantage among Asians was greatly reduced to only 27% lower among the highest educated (MRR 0.73; 95% CI: 0.68–0.78). For higher educated Filipina women, no mortality advantage was evident compared to NHWs (MRR 0.96; 95% CI: 0.88–1.05). Conclusion PMBC mortality for higher educated Asian women is elevated in comparison to their counterparts with less education. Given that PMBC survival is greater among those with higher education, our findings strongly suggest an excess in the incidence of PMBC (more than double) among higher educated Asian women; this warrants more research into potentially modifiable causes of PMBC in this burgeoning population."

High training volume, frequent flexion movements of the lower spine and rotational movement in sweep rowing contribute to increased spinal strain and neuropathological patterns. Perturbation-based trunk stabilization training (PTT) may be effective to treat neuromuscular deficits and low back pain.All boat classes (8+, 4+/-, 2-) of the male German national sweep rowing team participated in this non-randomized parallel group study. We included 26 athletes (PTT: n = 12, control group: n = 14) in our analysis. Physical and Sports therapists conducted 16 individualized PTT sessions á 30-40 minutes in 10 weeks, while the control group kept the usual routines. We collected data before and after intervention on back pain intensity and disability, maximum isometric trunk extension and flexion, jump height and postural sway of single-leg stance.We found less disability (5.3 points, 95% CI [0.4, 10.1], g = 0.42) for PTT compared to control. Pain intensity decreased similar in both groups (-14.4 and -15.4 points), yielding an inconclusive between-group effect (95% CI [-16.3, 14.3]). Postural sway, strength and jump height tend to have no between- and within-group effects.Perturbation-based trunk stabilization training is possibly effective to improve the physical function of the lower back in elite rowers."

The size distribution of the Korean minipig is an important feature that make this breed ideal for biomedical research and safe practice in post clinical studies. The extremely tiny (ET) minipig serves as an excellent model for various biomedical research studies, but the comparatively frail and vulnerable immune response to the environment over its Large (L) size minipig breed leads to additional after born care. To overcome this pitfall, comparative analysis of the genomic regions under selection in the L type breed could provide a better understanding at the molecular level and lead to the development of an enhanced variety of ET type minipig. In this study, we utilized whole genome sequencing (WGS) to identify traces of artificial selection and integrated them with transcriptome data generated from blood samples to find strongly selected and differentially expressed genes of interest. We identified a total of 35 common genes among which 7 were differentially expressed and showed selective sweep in the L type over the ET type minipig breed. The stabilization of these genes were further confirmed using nucleotide diversity analysis, and these genes could serve as potential biomarkers for the development of a better variety of ET type pig breed."
https://openalex.org/W4280609540,"Linguistic variation in space reflects patterns of social interaction. Gravity models have been successfully used to capture the role of urban centers in the dissemination of innovations in the speech community along with the diffusion of variants in space. Crucially, the effects of the factors of a gravity model (distance and population size) depend on language situation and may result from different sources, in particular processes of vertical and horizontal convergence. In the present study, we investigate lexical variation in contemporary Yucatec Maya, an indigenous language of Mexico, spoken in a situation of generalized bilingualism. This language situation lacks some crucial ingredients of vertical convergence: no variety of Yucatec Maya has the status of a standard variety: the language of administration and education is Spanish (diglossia-with-bilingualism). The present study finds evidence of convergence processes that can be exclusively attributed to horizontal convergence. The lexical distance between speakers decreases in and between urban centers, variants with a large distribution are more likely in areas with a maximum of interactions with other areas. Even Spanish variants are distributed in the sample with a pattern that reveals processes of horizontal convergence: their distribution is accounted for through an areal bias (widespread in areas with a stronger exposition to Spanish) rather by influences from the urban centers (as centers of administration/education) to the rural areas in their surroundings."
https://openalex.org/W4280617632,"For complex communication signals, it is often difficult to identify the information-bearing elements and their parameters necessary to elicit functional behavior. Consequently, it may be difficult to design stimuli that test how neurons contribute to communicative processing. For túngara frogs (Physalaemus pustulosus), however, previous behavioral testing with numerous stimuli showed that a particular frequency modulated (FM) transition in the male call is required to elicit phonotaxis and vocal responses. Modeled on such behavioral experiments, we used awake in vivo recordings of single units in the midbrain to determine if their excitation was biased to behaviorally important FM parameters. Comparisons of stimulus driven action potentials revealed greatest excitation to the behaviorally important FM transition: a downward FM sweep or step that crosses ~600 Hz. Previous studies using long-duration acoustic exposure found immediate early gene expression in many midbrain neurons to be most sensitive to similar FM. However, those data could not determine if FM coding was accomplished by the population and/or individual neurons. Our data suggest both coding schemes could operate, as 1) individual neurons are more sensitive to the behaviorally significant FM transition and 2) when single unit recordings are analytically combined across cells, the combined code can produce high stimulus discrimination (FM vs. noise driven excitation), approaching that found in behavioral discrimination of call vs. noise."

We aim to explore health care providers' experiences of and perceptions towards the use of misoprostol for management of second trimester incomplete abortion.This qualitative study used the phenomenology approach. We conducted 48 in-depth interviews for doctors and midwives at 14 public health facilities in central Uganda using a flexible interview guide. We used inductive content analysis and made code frequencies based on health care provider cadre, and health facility level and then abstracted themes from categories.Well trained midwives were perceived as competent to manage second trimester post abortion care stable patients, however doctor's supervision in case of complications was considered important. Sometimes, midwives were seen as offering better care than doctors given their stronger presence in the facilities. Misoprostol received unanimous support and viewed as: safe, effective, cheap, convenient, readily available, maintained patient privacy, and saved resources. Challenges faced included: side effects, prolonged hospital stay, treatment failure, inclination to surgical evacuation, heavy work load, inadequate space, lack of medical commodities, frequent staff rotations which affects the quality of patient care. To address these challenges, respondents coped by: giving patients psychological support, analgesics, close patient monitoring, staff mentorship, commitment to work, team work and patient involvement in care.Misoprostol is perceived as an ideal uterine evacuation method for second trimester post abortion care of uncomplicated patients and trained midwives are considered competent managing these patients in a health facility setting with a back-up of a doctor.

https://openalex.org/W4280630543,"Freshwaters are a very valuable resource in arid areas, such as Mediterranean countries. Freshwater systems are vulnerable ecological habitats, significantly disturbed globally and especially in arid areas. The Sea of Galilee is the largest surface freshwater body in the Middle East. It is an isolated habitat supporting unique fish populations, including endemic species and populations on the edge of their distribution range. Using the Sea of Galilee for water supply, fishing and recreation has been placing pressure on these fish populations. Therefore, efficient monitoring and effective actions can make a difference in the conservation of these unique fish populations. To set a baseline and develop molecular tools to do so, in this study, DNA barcoding was used to establish a database of molecular species identification based on sequences of Cytochrome C Oxidase subunit I gene. DNA barcodes for 22 species were obtained and deposited in Barcode of Life Database. Among these, 12 barcodes for 10 species were new to the database and different from those already there. Barcode sequences were queried against the database and similar barcodes from the same and closely related species were obtained. Disagreements between morphological and molecular species identification were identified for five species, which were further studied by phylogenetic and genetic distances analyses. These analyses suggested the Sea of Galilee contained hybrid fish of some species and other species for which the species definition should be reconsidered. Notably, the cyprinid fish defined as Garra rufa, should be considered as Garra jordanica. Taken together, along with data supporting reconsideration of species definition, this study sets the basis for further using molecular tools for monitoring fish populations, understanding their ecology, and effectively managing their conservation in this unique and important habitat and in the region."
https://openalex.org/W4280520368,"Although it is known that assessment and management of the nutritional status of patients are important for treatment of patients with heart failure (HF), there are currently no established indicators. Therefore, we investigated the effects of nutritional parameters as well as conventional parameters on the prognosis of HF patients. A total of 1954 consecutive HF patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than 50% were enrolled in this study. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed and conventional parameters for HF patients and parameters to assess nutritional status were measured in all patients. Patients were followed up with a primary endpoint of lethal cardiac events (CEs) for 30.2 months. During the follow-up period, cardiac events were documented in 619 HF patients. The CEs group had a lower level of cholinesterase (201.5U/L vs 265.2U/L, P &lt;0.0001), lower estimated GFR (35.2 ml/min/1.73m 2 vs 50.3ml/min/1.73m 2 , P&lt; 0.0001), and lower Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI) (91.9 vs 100.0, P&lt; 0.0001) than those in the non-CEs group. Serum cholinesterase, estimated GFR, and GNRI were identified as significant prognostic determinants in multivariate analysis. ROC analyses revealed cut-off values of serum cholinesterase, estimated GFR, and GNRI of 229U/L, 34.2 ml/min/1.73m 2 , and 95.6, respectively, for identifying high-risk HF patients. HF patients with serum cholinesterase&lt; 229U/L, estimated GFR&lt;34.3 ml/min/1.73m 2 , and GNRI&lt; 95.6 had a significantly greater rate of CEs than that in the other patients (P&lt;0.0001).

https://openalex.org/W4280543028,"The ability to predict nucleic acid hybridization energies has been greatly enabling for many applications, but predictive models require painstaking experimentation, which may limit expansion to non-natural nucleic acid analogues and chemistries. We have assessed the utility of dye-based, high-resolution melting (HRM) as an alternative to UV-Vis determinations of hyperchromicity in order to more quickly acquire parameters for duplex stability prediction. The HRM-derived model for phosphodiester (PO) DNA can make comparable predictions to previously established models. Using HRM, it proved possible to develop predictive models for DNA duplexes containing phosphorothioate (PS) linkages, and we found that hybridization stability could be predicted as a function of sequence and backbone composition for a variety of duplexes, including PS:PS, PS:PO, and partially modified backbones. Individual phosphorothioate modifications destabilize helices by around 0.12 kcal/mol on average. Finally, we applied these models to the design of a catalytic hairpin assembly circuit, an enzyme-free amplification method used for nucleic acid-based molecular detection. Changes in PS circuit behavior were consistent with model predictions, further supporting the addition of HRM modeling and parameters for PS oligonucleotides to the rational design of nucleic acid hybridization."
https://openalex.org/W4280586019,"Background Pregnancy and motherhood increase the risk for long-term exposure to physical, psychological and sexual intimate partner violence (IPV; sexual or physical violence by current or former partners). Pregnant women and mothers with children under 5 who have experienced IPV exhibit poor physical and mental health and obstetric outcomes. Depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are the two most common mental health consequences of IPV. There is good evidence that women with good social support have better mental health and IPV outcomes. Methods This study will develop MOthers’ AdvocateS In the Community (MOSAIC) Plus intervention for pregnant women and mothers with children under the age of 5. MOSAIC uses trained mentor mothers and has been found to reduce subsequent IPV. This study will blend the original MOSAIC intervention with principles of interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) to address symptoms of depression, PTSD, and prevent subsequent risk of IPV. We will conduct a pilot randomized trial of the MOSAIC Plus intervention compared to the traditional MOSAIC intervention to determine its feasibility and acceptability. Study samples include focus groups (n = 36), open trial (n = 15), and a randomized pilot trial including 40 pregnant women and mothers with children under 5 who report current/recent of IPV and elevated symptoms of maternal depression and/or PTSD. The study’s primary outcome will be changes in maternal depressive and PTSD symptoms. Secondary outcomes will include reduction in subsequent IPV, improvement in functioning, changes in social support and effectiveness in obtaining resources. Discussion This is a formative study evaluating the feasibility and acceptability of a mentor mother intervention for pregnant women and mothers with children under 5. Promising results of this study will be used for a larger, fully-powered randomized trial evaluating the effectiveness of a mentor mother intervention in preventing subsequent IPV and reducing depressive and PTSD symptoms in this population."

However, little is known about how parents approach the decision to enroll their child in a pediatric participant research registry (PPRR). We conducted in-person, written, or telephone surveys with parents/guardians of children hospitalized at Children's Hospital of Omaha, Nebraska to identify attitudes towards and barriers to enrollment in PPRRs. Overall, our population (N = 36) had positive attitudes toward PPRRs, with 77.8% (CI: 61.6, 88.4) of participants stating they were ""somewhat"" or ""very"" likely to enroll their child. Likelihood to enroll differed between various recruitment and enrollment methods, with participants stating they would be more likely to enroll their child in a PPRR if they were recruited by their child's primary care provider or a nurse in clinic (p = 0.02) and less likely to enroll if they were recruited through social media (p<0.001). Additionally, over 90% of participants who were likely to enroll their child in a PPRR (N = 28) were also willing to provide demographic, medical, and lifestyle information. However, these participants remained concerned about inappropriate sharing of their information with insurance or for-profit companies (53.6%, CI: 35.8, 70.4) and about receiving unwanted telephone calls from the registry (78.6%, CI: 60.0, 90.0). Parents are generally willing to enroll their child in a PPRR. However, to optimize enrollment, investigators must understand parental preferences for and concerns surrounding enrollment in a PPRR."
https://openalex.org/W4280646428,"Childhood diarrhea and Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI) are two diseases with similar risk factors in tropical developing regions. The objective of this study was to employ a joint binary response model and identify risk factors for childhood diarrhea and ARI in children under the age of five. A joint binary response model that takes into account the interdependence of the two diseases was used. Explanatory variables such as residence, vaccination, mother’s education, and antenatal care visits during pregnancy were found to be statistically significant risk factors for diarrhea in the joint model, whereas residence, the number of children ever born, vaccination, mother’s education, and wealth index were found to be statistically significant risk factors for childhood Acute Respiratory Infection. We discovered a common odds ratio value (4.30) greater than one, indicating a positive relationship between the two childhood diseases. As a result, using a joint model to assess the risk factors for diarrhea and acute respiratory infection (ARI) was reasonable. Furthermore, the standard errors of the parameter estimates in the joint response model were found to be smaller than the corresponding standard errors in the separate models. The risk factors such as residence, vaccination, and mother’s education all had a significant effect on the two correlated dichotomous response variables, diarrhea and ARI."
