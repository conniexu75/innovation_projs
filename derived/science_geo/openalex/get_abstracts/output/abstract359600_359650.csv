https://openalex.org/W2092703117,"The dorsal striatum plays a role in consummatory food reward, and striatal dopamine receptors are reduced in obese individuals, relative to lean individuals, which suggests that the striatum and dopaminergic signaling in the striatum may contribute to the development of obesity. Thus, we tested whether striatal activation in response to food intake is related to current and future increases in body mass and whether these relations are moderated by the presence of the A1 allele of the Taq IA restriction fragment length polymorphism, which is associated with dopamine D2 receptor ( DRD2 ) gene binding in the striatum and compromised striatal dopamine signaling. Cross-sectional and prospective data from two functional magnetic resonance imaging studies support these hypotheses, which implies that individuals may overeat to compensate for a hypofunctioning dorsal striatum, particularly those with genetic polymorphisms thought to attenuate dopamine signaling in this region."
https://openalex.org/W1988598239,"Room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) are promising candidates for a broad range of “green” applications, for which their interaction with solid surfaces plays a crucial role. In this high-energy x-ray reflectivity study, the temperature-dependent structures of three ionic liquids with the tris(pentafluoroethyl)trifluorophosphate anion in contact with a charged sapphire substrate were investigated with submolecular resolution. All three RTILs show strong interfacial layering, starting with a cation layer at the substrate and decaying exponentially into the bulk liquid. The observed decay length and layering period point to an interfacial ordering mechanism, akin to the charge inversion effect, which is suggested to originate from strong correlations between the unscreened ions. The observed layering is expected to be a generic feature of RTILs at charged interfaces."
https://openalex.org/W2109389103,"The engineering of biological systems is anticipated to provide effective solutions to challenges that include energy and food production, environmental quality, and health and medicine. Our ability to transmit information to and from living systems, and to process and act on information inside cells, is critical to advancing the scale and complexity at which we can engineer, manipulate, and probe biological systems. We developed a general approach for assembling RNA devices that can execute higher-order cellular information processing operations from standard components. The engineered devices can function as logic gates (AND, NOR, NAND, or OR gates) and signal filters, and exhibit cooperativity. RNA devices process and transmit molecular inputs to targeted protein outputs, linking computation to gene expression and thus the potential to control cellular function."
https://openalex.org/W1978182054,"By monitoring fluorescently labeled lactose permease with single-molecule sensitivity, we investigated the molecular mechanism of how an Escherichia coli cell with the lac operon switches from one phenotype to another. At intermediate inducer concentrations, a population of genetically identical cells exhibits two phenotypes: induced cells with highly fluorescent membranes and uninduced cells with a small number of membrane-bound permeases. We found that this basal-level expression results from partial dissociation of the tetrameric lactose repressor from one of its operators on looped DNA. In contrast, infrequent events of complete dissociation of the repressor from DNA result in large bursts of permease expression that trigger induction of the lac operon. Hence, a stochastic single-molecule event determines a cell's phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2108161822,"The nucleobase–cation–symport-1 (NCS1) transporters are essential components of salvage pathways for nucleobases and related metabolites. Here, we report the 2.85-angstrom resolution structure of the NCS1 benzyl-hydantoin transporter, Mhp1, from Microbacterium liquefaciens. Mhp1 contains 12 transmembrane helices, 10 of which are arranged in two inverted repeats of five helices. The structures of the outward-facing open and substrate-bound occluded conformations were solved, showing how the outward-facing cavity closes upon binding of substrate. Comparisons with the leucine transporter LeuT Aa and the galactose transporter vSGLT reveal that the outward- and inward-facing cavities are symmetrically arranged on opposite sides of the membrane. The reciprocal opening and closing of these cavities is synchronized by the inverted repeat helices 3 and 8, providing the structural basis of the alternating access model for membrane transport."
https://openalex.org/W2013726100,"Statistical analyses of protein families reveal networks of coevolving amino acids that functionally link distantly positioned functional surfaces. Such linkages suggest a concept for engineering allosteric control into proteins: The intramolecular networks of two proteins could be joined across their surface sites such that the activity of one protein might control the activity of the other. We tested this idea by creating PAS-DHFR, a designed chimeric protein that connects a light-sensing signaling domain from a plant member of the Per/Arnt/Sim (PAS) family of proteins with Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). With no optimization, PAS-DHFR exhibited light-dependent catalytic activity that depended on the site of connection and on known signaling mechanisms in both proteins. PAS-DHFR serves as a proof of concept for engineering regulatory activities into proteins through interface design at conserved allosteric sites."

We found the original extracts of this experiment in Miller's material and reanalyzed them. The volcanic apparatus produced a wider variety of amino acids than the classic one. Release of reduced gases in volcanic eruptions accompanied by lightning could have been common on the early Earth. Prebotic compounds synthesized in these environments could have locally accumulated, where they could have undergone further processing."
https://openalex.org/W2074125274,"Spin transfer appears to be a promising tool for improving spintronics devices. Experiments that quantitatively access the magnitude of the spin transfer are required for a fundamental understanding of this phenomenon. By inductively measuring spin waves propagating along a permalloy strip subjected to a large electrical current, we observed a current-induced spin wave Doppler shift that we relate to the adiabatic spin transfer torque. Because spin waves provide a well-defined system for performing spin transfer, we anticipate that they could be used as an accurate probe of spin-polarized transport in various itinerant ferromagnets."
https://openalex.org/W2089843126,"Microtubules display dynamic instability, with alternating phases of growth and shrinkage separated by catastrophe and rescue events. The guanosine triphosphate (GTP) cap at the growing end of microtubules, whose presence is essential to prevent microtubule catastrophes in vitro, has been difficult to observe in vivo. We selected a recombinant antibody that specifically recognizes GTP-bound tubulin in microtubules and found that GTP-tubulin was indeed present at the plus end of growing microtubules. Unexpectedly, GTP-tubulin remnants were also present in older parts of microtubules, which suggests that GTP hydrolysis is sometimes incomplete during polymerization. Observations in living cells suggested that these GTP remnants may be responsible for the rescue events in which microtubules recover from catastrophe."

Here, we report the assembling of complex atomic patterns at room temperature by the vertical interchange of atoms between the tip apex of an atomic force microscope and a semiconductor surface. At variance with previous methods, these manipulations were produced by exploring the repulsive part of the short-range chemical interaction between the closest tip-surface atoms. By using first-principles calculations, we clarified the basic mechanisms behind the vertical interchange of atoms, characterizing the key atomistic processes involved and estimating the magnitude of the energy barriers between the relevant atomic configurations that leads to these manipulations."
https://openalex.org/W2006851263,"Strontium ranelate exerts both an anti-catabolic and an anabolic effect on bone cells. To further investigate the molecular mechanism whereby strontium ranelate inhibits bone resorption, we focused our attention on the effects of strontium ranelate on osteoclast apoptosis and on the underlying mechanism(s). Using primary mature rabbit osteoclasts, we demonstrated that strontium (Sro2+) dose-dependently stimulates the apoptosis of mature osteoclasts. As shown previously for calcium (Cao2+), the Sro2+-induced effect on mature osteoclasts is mediated by the Cao2+-sensing receptor, CaR, which in turn stimulates a phospholipase C-dependent signaling pathway and nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB. Unlike Cao2+, however, Sro2+-induced osteoclast apoptosis was shown to depend on PKCbetaII activation and to be independent of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate action. As a consequence of these differences in their intracellular signaling pathways, Sro2+ and Cao2+ in combination were shown to exert a greater effect on mature osteoclast apoptosis than did either divalent cation by itself. Altogether, our results show that Sro2+ acts through the CaR and induces osteoclast apoptosis through a signaling pathway similar to but different in certain respects from that of Cao2+. This difference in the respective signaling cascades enables Sro2+ to potentiate Cao2+-induced osteoclast apoptosis and vice versa. In this manner, it is conceivable that Sro2+ and Cao2+ act together to inhibit bone resorption in strontium ranelate-treated patients."
https://openalex.org/W2157650085,"DNA is thought to behave as a stiff elastic rod with respect to the ubiquitous mechanical deformations inherent to its biology. To test this model at short DNA lengths, we measured the mean and variance of end-to-end length for a series of DNA double helices in solution, using small-angle x-ray scattering interference between gold nanocrystal labels. In the absence of applied tension, DNA is at least one order of magnitude softer than measured by single-molecule stretching experiments. Further, the data rule out the conventional elastic rod model. The variance in end-to-end length follows a quadratic dependence on the number of base pairs rather than the expected linear dependence, indicating that DNA stretching is cooperative over more than two turns of the DNA double helix. Our observations support the idea of long-range allosteric communication through DNA structure."

https://openalex.org/W2114599162,"One fundamental question about pulsars concerns the mechanism of their pulsed electromagnetic emission. Measuring the high-end region of a pulsar's spectrum would shed light on this question. By developing a new electronic trigger, we lowered the threshold of the Major Atmospheric gamma-ray Imaging Cherenkov (MAGIC) telescope to 25 giga-electron volts. In this configuration, we detected pulsed gamma-rays from the Crab pulsar that were greater than 25 giga-electron volts, revealing a relatively high cutoff energy in the phase-averaged spectrum. This indicates that the emission occurs far out in the magnetosphere, hence excluding the polar-cap scenario as a possible explanation of our measurement. The high cutoff energy also challenges the slot-gap scenario."

We expressed ChR2 in COS-cells, purified it, and subsequently investigated this unusual photoreceptor by flash photolysis and UV-visible and Fourier transform infrared difference spectroscopy. Several transient photoproducts of the wild type ChR2 were identified, and their kinetics and molecular properties were compared with those of the ChR2 mutant E90Q. Based on the spectroscopic data we developed a model of the photocycle comprising six distinguishable intermediates. This photocycle shows similarities to the photocycle of the ChR2-related Channelrhodopsin of Volvox but also displays significant differences. We show that molecular changes include retinal isomerization, changes in hydrogen bonding of carboxylic acids, and large alterations of the protein backbone structure. These alterations are stronger than those observed in the photocycle of other microbial rhodopsins like bacteriorhodopsin and are related to those occurring in animal rhodopsins. UV-visible and Fourier transform infrared difference spectroscopy revealed two late intermediates with different time constants of τ = 6 and 40 s that exist during the recovery of the dark state.

Because of this property, in recent years ChRs have been widely used in the neuroscience field as a tool for depolarization of selected cell types or cell ensembles (6.Boyden E.S. Zhang F. Bamberg E.

As is typical for rhodopsins, light absorption induces isomerization of the ChR-chromophore with subsequent conformational changes in the protein (photocycle). Based on UV-visible spectroscopic and electrophysiological measurements, several schemes for this photocycle have been presented. A recent model for recombinant Volvox channelrhodopsin (VChR), purified from green monkey COS cells, comprises the two dark states D470 and D480, characterized by a fine structured UV-visible absorption spectrum with maxima at 470 and 480 nm, respectively (14.Ernst O.P. Sanchez Murcia P.A. Daldrop P. Tsunoda S.P. Kateriya S. Hegemann P. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1637-1643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). These two states, which exist in a pH-dependent equilibrium, are both converted by light via retinal isomerization and transient Schiff base deprotonation to the conducting state P510 or, under acidic conditions, to P530. These intermediates thermally relax back to the dark state equilibrium in a biphasic reaction on a millisecond time scale. A similar model was deduced for ChR2 from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (15.Bamann C. Kirsch T. Nagel G. Bamberg E. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 375: 686-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), in which the conducting state, termed P520, was also observed to decay biexponentially with time constants of 10 ms and 5 s. No absolute spectra and no early photocycle intermediates were analyzed in this study. Here we present more detailed spectroscopic studies on wild type Chlamydomonas ChR2 and the mutant E90Q, which is 10 times more selective for Na+ than for H+ as compared with the wild type. 4A. Berndt, D. Gradmann, and P. Hegemann, unpublished observations.4A. Berndt, D. Gradmann, and P. Hegemann, unpublished observations. Because UV-visible studies solely provide information about the protonation state of the Schiff base and constraints of the retinal chromophore, we additionally applied Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) difference spectroscopy, which allowed us to analyze structural changes beyond the direct protein-chromophore interaction. The FTIR difference spectra of formation and decay of three different intermediates are presented. Based on the FTIR and UV-visible spectroscopic data, we deduced a six-state model of the ChR2 photocycle. We provide evidence that molecular changes during this photocycle comprise retinal isomerization, Schiff base protonation change, changes in hydrogen bonding of the protonated carboxylic acid Glu90, and structural alterations of the protein backbone. As indicated by the spectra, these changes of the secondary structure are large compared with other microbial rhodopsins but are comparable with visual rhodopsin, which is a G-protein-coupled receptor. Such large changes are already observed in an intermediate cryotrapped at 80 K. FTIR difference spectroscopy indicated that the glutamic acid side chain of Glu90 changes its hydrogen bonding pattern during the photocycle. The late transitions, finally leading to the recovery of the dark state, comprise two intermediates with decay time constants of 6 and 40 s. In contrast to VChR, ChR2 does not show any pH-dependent equilibrium in the dark. ChR2 Expression in COS-1 Cells—For expression in COS-1 cells (ATCC, CRL-1650), a human codon-optimized synthetic ChopDNAfragment (corresponding to amino acids 1-311 of the native protein; accession number AF461397), plus the C-terminal ETSQVAPA sequence (1D4 epitope (16.Molday R.S. Mackenzie D. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar)) was designed and purchased from GeneArt (Regensburg, Germany). The synthetic Chop DNA was inserted between the EcoRI-NotI sites of the expression vector pMT4. Tissue culture, transient transfection with the resulting ChR2-pMT4 vector, reconstitution with chromophore, and subsequent purification of ChR2 was performed basically as described for bovine rhodopsin (17.Meyer C.K. Böhme M. Ockenfels A. Gartner W. Hofmann K.P. Ernst O.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19713-19718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Three days after transfection, the cells were harvested and reconstituted with all-trans-retinal (final concentration, 30 μm). ChR2 was solubilized with dodecyl maltoside and purified by immunoaffinity adsorption using rho 1D4 antibody coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (GE Healthcare). ChR2 was eluted with 100 μm of an 18-mer peptide corresponding to the C-terminal rhodopsin sequence in 0.03% (w/v) dodecyl maltoside, 10 mm 1,3-bis-[tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino] propane, pH 6.0 (17.Meyer C.K.

The eluates were concentrated using Centricon YM-10 (Millipore) concentrators and stored at -80 °C. The mutant ChR2-E90Q was generated by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange kit; Stratagene). UV-visible Spectroscopy—For absorption spectroscopy and slow kinetics at 20 °C, a Cary 50 Bio spectrophotometer (Varian Inc.) was used at a spectral resolution of 2 nm. The samples were illuminated for 10 s with a blue Luxeon LED (Philips Lumileds, San Jose, CA) with a wavelength of 456 nm, 90 milliwatt cm-2, 2 × 1021 photons m-2 s-1. Transient spectroscopy was performed on a LKS.60 flash photolysis system (Applied Photophysics Ltd., Leatherhead, UK) at 22 °C. Excitation pulses (10 ns, 456 nm) were provided by a tunable Rainbow OPO/Nd: YAG laser system. Laser energy was adjusted to 5 mJ/shot. The instrument used a xenon lamp (150 W) as monitoring light source, which was pulsed during short time experiments. Monochromators placed before and after the sample were set to spectral resolutions of 2 nm. For detection, a 466 photomul-tipier (Hamamatsu Photonics) was used, and the signal was recorded with an Infinium Oscilloscope (Agilent Technologies). 32,000 data points were recorded in each measurement and compressed by LKS.60 software to files of 500 data points. 50 of these points were recorded before laser excitation, and 450 points were recorded after laser excitation. To avoid artifacts and scatter, only data points 60-500 were used for analysis. Data analysis was performed with Matlab 7.01 (The Math-Works, Natick, MA). Singular value decomposition of representative data sets was performed to identify significant components that were used for reconstruction of the three-dimensional spectra. Time constants were obtained by fitting exponential functions to the data. For measurements at pH 6, freshly prepared ChR2 was used. For experiments at pH 8 and 4.5, freshly prepared ChR2 was diluted with buffer containing 0.03% dodecyl maltoside. For measurements at 80 K, an Oxford Instruments Optistat DN LN2 cooled cryostat was used. In this case, the same sample preparation as described below for FTIR measurements was used. FTIR Difference Spectroscopy—The pH of solubilized channelrhodopsin was adjusted by diluted NaOH or HCl (100 mm). Subsequently, 20 μl of the sample were dried on a 15-mm-diameter BaF2 window, rehydrated by 1 μl of buffer (1, 3-bis-[tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]-propane) of the appropriate pH value, sealed by a second BaF2 window, and placed into a temperature-controlled cuvette as described (18.Ritter E. Elgeti M. Hofmann K.P. Bartl F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 10720-10730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). A Bruker ifs66v/S FTIR spectrometer with a LN2-cooled mercury cadmium telluride detector (Kolmar Technologies Inc.) and a 1950 cm-1 optical cut-off filter was used to record the infrared spectra with a scanning velocity of 200 kHz and a spectral resolution of 2 cm-1. Before the measurement the sample was equilibrated 45 min in the spectrometer. Illumination was performed by blue LEDs (475 nm, 7200 mcd; led1. de). FTIR spectra were recorded in the rapid scan mode with a time resolution of 5 s. In parallel, UV-visible spectra were recorded every millisecond. For measurements at room temperature, each experiment was repeated at least 30 times to increase the S/N ratio. To allow the sample to quantitatively recover the dark state, the delay between two single experiments was 10 min at 25 °C. Illumination time was 60 s, and FTIR spectra were measured before, during, and after illumination. Spectra before and during illumination were setwise averaged, and the difference spectrum for the transition from the dark state to the photostationary state (termed photostationary minus dark state difference spectrum) was calculated. For the measurements at 80 K, each experiment was repeated three times. Between the experiments, the sample was equilibrated at 25 °C for 5 min. A set of dark spectra was recorded over a period of 2 min. After illumination, a second set of data were collected, and the difference spectrum was calculated as described. For further data analysis, a mathematical procedure was developed using the numerical computation language GNU Octave (19.Eaton, J. W. (2002) GNU Octave Manual Network Theory Limited, BristolGoogle Scholar). It combines singular value decomposition with a rotation procedure and global fitting to the spectral data as described (20.Elgeti M. Ritter E. Bartl F. Z. Physikal. Chemie. 2008; 222: 1117-1129Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Time constants were obtained from the global fitting procedure. UV-visible Spectroscopic Characterization of ChR2—The UV-visible spectrum of dark-adapted wild type (WT) ChR2 is shown in Fig. 1A (gray). It is identical under acidic and alkaline conditions. Interestingly, this spectrum exhibits a fine structure comprising two maxima at 450 and 470 nm and a shoulder at 413 nm. These absorption maxima indicate that the Schiff base linkage between chromophore and protein is protonated. Upon continuous illumination with blue light (10 s, 456 nm), the fine structure is diminished, and a red-shifted maximum around 480 nm is observed (Fig. 1A, blue, green, and red spectra), because of accumulation of a photostationary state that mainly consists of late photocycle intermediates and the dark form. Illumination under acidic conditions (pH 4.5) results in strong depletion of the 450-nm band and higher accumulation of the late 480-nm intermediates (Fig. 1A, red line) compared with more alkaline conditions (Fig. 1A, green and blue lines). Accordingly, the recovery kinetics is slower under acidic conditions (time constants τ in Fig. 1B). Because of the strong 470-nm absorption in the spectrum of the dark adapted form, we term this state D470, whereas the illuminated form is termed P480. We also purified recombinant ChR2-E90Q, a mutant that shows reduced electrical conductance for H+ and consequently a comparatively higher selectivity for Na+. The spectrum of dark-adapted E90Q is virtually identical to the WT spectrum and shows a similar red shift when the sample is continuously illuminated, as illustrated in the inset of Fig. 1A. Although the recovery kinetics of the dark-adapted state of E90Q is faster than that of WT under all pH conditions applied, low pH also resulted in the slowest recovery rate of the dark state (Fig. 1B and τ values). For further characterization of early photocycle intermediates, purified ChR2 was excited with 10-ns laser flashes (pH 6, 456 nm), and time-resolved UV-visible-spectra were recorded. The three-dimensional plots in Fig. 2 (A-F) show flash-induced absorbance changes of WT (A-C) and E90Q mutant (D-F) at pH 6 in the spectral range between 300 and 650 nm, which visualize formation and decay of photocycle intermediates. The spectra were recorded with a resolution of 10 nm over a period of 15 μs (A and D), 8 ms (B and E), or 30 ms (C and F) after the actinic flash. The plots were reconstructed using the two most significant components obtained by singular value decomposition (see “Experimental Procedures”) as shown in Fig. 2 (G (WT) and H (E90Q)). An immediate absorbance increase was found at 520 nm at a time scale of nanoseconds (Fig. 2, A and G (WT) and D and H (E90Q), early spectrum, blue lines). Generally, maxima of difference spectra are shifted when the bands of the initial and the final state overlap. Therefore, the 520-nm absorption observed in the early difference spectra corresponds to a photointermediate that absorbs maximally at around 500 nm and was termed P500 accordingly. Within microseconds P500 converts into a species with a maximum around 390 nm (P390), indicating a deprotonated Schiff base (Fig. 2, G and H, medium spectrum, green line). The kinetics of formation and decay of P390 is shown in Fig. 2I for the WT (blue) and the E90Q mutant (green). In the mutant the chromophore deprotonates faster (τ = 4 μs) than WT ChR2 (τ = 25 μs), whereas the decay kinetics is similar for both ChR2 variants. The deprotonated P390 decays with time constant of 1 ms into the third photoproduct P520 (Fig. 2, G and H, late spectrum, red line). Subsequently, P520 converts into an intermediate termed P480 within 10 ms (Fig. 2, C and F). Because of its slow decay, this intermediate is accumulated in continuous light, hence dominating the light adapted ChR2 form shown in Fig. 1A. A Cryotrapped Intermediate of the Photocycle at 80 K—To obtain additional information about the photocycle, an intermediate of ChR2 was cryotrapped at 80 K. The inset in Fig. 3A shows the illuminated minus dark state UV-visible difference spectrum of ChR2 at 80 K (maroon). It comprises negative bands at 413, 442, and 475 nm and a positive band at 504 nm. This spectrum is qualitatively similar to the photostationary minus dark state difference spectrum shown in Fig. 1A (inset). Fig. 3A (maroon) shows the respective illuminated minus dark state FTIR difference spectrum of ChR2 recorded at this temperature. Negative bands correspond to vibrations of the dark state, whereas positive bands occur because of vibrations of the photoproduct. In the fingerprint region between 1350 and 1150 cm-1, indicative for the isomeric state of the chromophore, the spectrum exhibits negative bands at 1245, 1235, 1202, and 1182 cm-1 and positive bands at 1190 and 1176 cm-1. In the amide II region around 1550 cm-1, indicative for changes of the secondary structure and for C=C stretching modes of the retinal, we observe a broad negative band at 1542 cm-1. However, the largest spectral alterations occur in the structurally sensitive amide I region as a strong negative band at 1665 cm-1, which does not downshift in D2O. An additional negative band in this range is found at 1638 cm-1 in H2O and at 1635 cm-1 in D2O (data not shown). In the spectral region above 1700 cm-1, indicative for C=O stretching vibrations of protonated carboxylic acids, a bilobe at 1735 (-)/1741 (+)cm-1 is a significant feature of the spectrum. Green light (520 nm) reconverts the 80 K intermediate back to a dark state-like structure, as concluded from the photoproduct minus 80 K intermediate FTIR and UV-visible difference spectra (Fig. 3A, cyan lines). The FTIR difference spectrum is largely a mirror image of the difference spectrum of the forward pathway in the range of amide I and protonated carboxylic acids. However, as indicated by bands in the fingerprint region of the FTIR spectrum and by the UV-visible spectrum (Fig. 3A, inset, cyan line), the isomeric state of the chromophore is not exactly reversed. The Photostationary State—Continuous illumination of the ChR2 dark state D470 with blue light leads to formation of a photostationary state that is expected to consist mainly of the intermediates with the slowest decay kinetics and the dark state, depending on the illumination conditions. The photostationary state minus dark state FTIR difference spectrum (Fig. 3A, blue line) was calculated by subtracting the spectra of the dark state from the spectra measured during continuous illumination at 25 °C. Recording time of each set (dark and illuminated state spectra) was 50 s, and monitoring of the illuminated state spectra was started 2 s after the onset of the illumination to ensure that the photostationary state is observed exclusively. The chromophore fingerprint region between 1150 and 1350 cm-1 of this spectrum exhibits positive bands around 1174 cm-1 and negative bands at 1184, 1200, 1235, and 1245 cm-1. Similar bands in this spectral region occur in the 80 K intermediate, albeit more pronounced. In the amide II region the strong negative band that was observed at 1542 cm-1 in the 80 K spectrum is slightly upshifted to 1548 cm-1. The most significant alterations appear in the amide I region and comprise a negative band at 1663 cm-1 and positive bands at 1648 and 1632 cm-1. In the range of the C=O stretching vibrations above 1700 cm-1, the bilobe at 1735 (-)/1741 (+)cm-1 in the difference spectrum of the 80 K intermediate has vanished. Instead, we now observe a positive band at 1730 cm-1 accompanied by a negative band at 1718 cm-1 and a weak negative band at 1738 cm-1. FTIR Difference Spectroscopy of Deuterated Samples and of the E90Q Mutant—Measurements in D2O were performed to facilitate a first assignment of bands in the spectral region between 1700 and 1800 cm-1. The photostationary minus dark state difference spectrum obtained in D2O is shown in Fig. 3B (red) with extended scale in comparison with the spectrum recorded in H2O (blue). The bands at 1730 and 1718 cm-1 in H2O are downshifted to 1722 and 1713 cm-1 in D2O. The negative band at 1738 cm-1 is not shifted and gains intensity in D2O. The most likely reason for this behavior is a partial overlap of the negative band at 1738 cm-1 with a positive band at 1730 cm-1 in H2O. Because of deuteration, the band at 1730 cm-1 is downshifted, which reduces the overlap and thus leads to an increased intensity of the 1738 cm-1 band. Such deuteration-induced spectral shifts are typical for protonated carboxylic acids, which change their chemical environment. Similar shifts were observed for comparable spectra of other photoreceptors recorded in D2O (21.Siebert F. Israel J. Chem. 1995; 35: 309-323Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 22.Siebert F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 246: 501-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tentatively assign the 1730/1718 cm-1 band to the C=O stretch of a protonated carboxylic acid. In Fig. 3C we show the photostationary minus dark state difference spectrum of ChR2-E90Q (green line), which was recorded as described above. The difference spectrum of the wild type is given for comparison (blue line). Interestingly, the most significant vibration at 1663 cm-1 (amide I band) remains unchanged in the spectrum of the mutant. However, the difference band at 1730/1718 cm-1, which we assigned to a C=O vibration of a protonated carboxylic acid, largely lost intensity, indicating that it is probably caused by the glutamate side chain of protonated Glu90. Decay of the Photostationary State—To further characterize the thermal back reaction from the photostationary state to the dark state, we recorded the FTIR difference spectra during the decay of the photostationary state. In Fig. 4A we compare the FTIR difference spectra for the formation (photostationary state minus dark state, blue line) and decay (final decay product (10 min) minus photostationary state, red line) of the photostationary state. Because the two spectra are almost perfect mirror images of each other as seen by the difference (black line), we can state that all of the structural changes that led to the photostationary state and that can be monitored in the infrared spectral region are reverted during the thermal decay. As mentioned above, the most intense band at 1663 cm-1 is a marker band for changes of the secondary structure of the protein during the photocycle. To analyze the kinetics of this transition, the intensity change of this band was tracked after the excitation light was turned off. In agreement with UV-visible spectroscopic data, the decay of the band is in the range of minutes. As shown by the residuals (upper black line) in Fig. 4B, the data (black) do not fit well to a monoexponential function (red). Further analysis of the data by a combination of singular value decomposition and global analysis as described (20.Elgeti M. Ritter E. Bartl F. Z. Physikal. Chemie. 2008; 222: 1117-1129Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar) reveals that thermal decay of the photostationary state involves two components with time constants of τ1 = 6 s and τ2 = 40 s at a ratio of 1:9. As indicated by the residuals (light green line), a biexponential function comprising these two components fits the data. The corresponding FTIR difference spectra of the pure first (Fig. 4C, orange spectrum) and second component (Fig. 4C, red spectrum) have also been obtained by application of this procedure. The spectrum of the first component shows only few characteristic difference bands. Most significant are the positive band at 1663 cm-1 and two smaller, negative bands at 1648 and 1633 cm-1. In the amide II region, only a small band occurs at 1555 cm-1. The intensity of the pattern observed in the chromophore region is relatively small and comprises bands at 1200, 1234, and 1244 cm-1. However, their intensities are hardly above the noise level. Interestingly, in the region above 1700 cm-1, no significant difference bands are observed in this component. The spectrum of the slow component (red) is more similar to the spectrum of the photostationary state (Fig. 4A). It exhibits intense positive bands at 1663 and 1546 cm-1 in the amide I and amide II regions, and the difference band at 1718 (+)/1730 (-)cm-1. The pattern in the chromophore region is also more pronounced and comprises bands at 1186, 1201, 1234, and 1244 cm-1. The Photocycle of ChR2—The combination of UV-visible and FTIR spectroscopy as applied in this study is a powerful tool to investigate reaction mechanisms of retinal proteins, because the two techniques allow extensive and even complementary structural and mechanistic conclusions (23.Siebert F. Hildebrandt P. Vibrational Spectroscopy in Life Science. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim2008Google Scholar). Absorption maxima of the UV-visible spectra mainly provide information about the protonation state of the retinal Schiff base, charge distributions within the polyene chain of the chromophore, and protein/chromophore interactions. Generally, blue-shifted absorption maxima in the range below 400 nm indicate intermediates in which the retinal Schiff base is deprotonated, whereas more red-shifted absorption maxima usually reveal the Schiff base in its protonated form (24.Honig B. Greenberg A.D. Dinur U. Ebrey T.G. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 4593-4599Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 25.Oesterhelt D. Hess B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 37: 316-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). FTIR difference spectra allow analysis of structural changes in both the chromophore and the protein. Difference bands in the spectral region between 1300 and 900 cm-1 reflect changes of the retinal geometry and direct protein chromophore interactions (21.Siebert F. Israel J. Chem. 1995; 35: 309-323Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Bands in the amide I region near 1650 cm-1 are indicative for changes of the secondary structure (26.Krimm S. Bandekar J. Adv. Protein Chem. 1986; 38: 181-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (2694) Google Scholar). Changes of the protonation states of amino acid residues and alterations of hydrogen bonding in the protein are reflected by bands in the spectral range between 1700 and 1800 cm-1. Therefore, our experiments allow us to propose a photocycle model for ChR2, which contains both information about the chromophore includin"

Analysis of chromatin in vitro has suggested that under near physiological conditions chromatin fibers can become highly compact and that the level of compaction can be modulated by histone modifications. However, less is known about the organization of chromatin fibers in living cells. Here, we combine chromosome conformation capture (3C) data with distance measurements and polymer modeling to determine the in vivo mass density of a transcriptionally active 95-kb GC-rich domain on chromosome III of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In contrast to previous reports, we find that yeast does not form a compact fiber but that chromatin is extended with a mass per unit length that is consistent with a rather loose arrangement of nucleosomes. Analysis of 3C data from a neighboring AT-rich chromosomal domain indicates that chromatin in this domain is more compact, but that mass density is still well below that of a canonical 30 nm fiber. Our approach should be widely applicable to scale 3C data to real spatial dimensions, which will facilitate the quantification of the effects of chromatin modifications and transcription on chromatin fiber organization.

The higher order organization of chromatin is thought to play critical roles in processes such as gene expression. Although the structure of nucleosomes is known in detail, much less is known about higher levels of chromatin organization. The first level of organization beyond the nucleosome may involve formation of a 30-nm-thick chromatin fiber, but the precise organization of DNA within this structure and the range of compaction levels of this fiber are poorly understood (for reviews see, e.g. Refs. 1.Belmont A.S.

Academic Press, San Diego1998Google Scholar). Two models have been considered extensively. First, the solenoid model predicts that nucleosomes follow a one-start helical path in which consecutive nucleosomes along the DNA are also nearest neighbors in the fiber (12.Thoma F. Koller T. Klug A. J. Cell Biol. 1979; 83: 403-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1174) Google Scholar). Second, the crossed-linker model predicts a three-dimensional zigzag organization of nucleosomes that can give rise to a two-start helix (13.Woodcock C.L. Frado L.L. Rattner J.B. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 14.Woodcock C.L. Grigoryev S.A. Horowitz R.A. Whitaker N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1998; 95: 14173-14178Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). In this model consecutive nucleosomes are located on opposite sides, with the linker DNA crossing the fiber. This model is supported by in situ observations, nuclease sensitivity experiments, modeling, and crystallographic studies of short tetranucleosomal assemblies (10.Woodcock C.L. Horowitz R.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 272-277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 16.Athey B.D. Smith M.F. Rankert D.A. Williams S.P. Langmore J.P. J.

Nature. 2005; 436: 138-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar).Both the solenoid one-step model and the zigzag two-start helix allow formation of chromatin fibers with highly variable levels of chromatin compaction. The level of compaction is thought to affect processes such as transcription. Highly compact chromatin fibers may be less accessible for protein complexes involved in gene expression, DNA repair, and DNA replication. A key step in many chromosomal processes may therefore involve modulation of chromatin fiber compaction.In vitro studies suggest that the level of chromatin compaction is dependent upon ionic conditions, linker length, linker histone binding, and histone modifications. At very low salt concentrations chromatin does not form 30-nm-thick fibers, and nucleosomes appear in a zigzag arrangement to form fibers with a low mass density of around 1–2 nucleosomes per 11 nm fiber (6.Hansen J.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 361-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 12.Thoma F. Koller T. Klug A. J.

Under conditions that are thought to mimic the in vivo milieu, i.e. 150 mm salt and 1–5 mm Mg2+, chromatin becomes compact to form more typical 30 nm fibers with a mass density of 6 nucleosomes per 11 nm (15.Bednar J. Horowitz R.A. Grigoryev S.A. Carruthers L.M. Hansen J.C. Koster A.J. Woodcock C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14173-14178Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 21.Gerchman S.E. Ramakrishnan V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7802-7806Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The level of compaction that is observed under these conditions further depends on the length of the linker DNA between nucleosomes and by binding of linker histone (22.Routh A. Sandin S. Rhodes D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 8872-8877Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Further, acetylation of nucleosomes affects chromatin structure, as detected by a change in DNA linker number (23.Norton V.G. Imai B.S. Yau P. Bradbury E.M. Cell. 1989; 57: 449-457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 24.Norton V.G. Marvin K.W. Yau P. Bradbury E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19848-19852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and results in a reduced ability to form compact fibers as compared with non-acetylated chromatin (6.Hansen J.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 361-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 11.Wolffe A. Chromatin, Structure and Function.

Biol. 1998; 18: 4629-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Strikingly, a single acetylation event at H4K16 has been shown to prevent formation of compact chromatin fibers in vitro (27.Shogren-Knaak M. Ishii H. Sun J.M. Pazin M.J. Davie J.R. Peterson C.L. Science. 2006; 311: 844-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar, 28.Robinson P.J. An W. Routh A. Martino F. Chapman L. Roeder R.G. Rhodes D. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 381: 816-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar).Combined these observations suggest that in vivo the level of compaction of chromatin is not uniform across the genome, but is modulated by local differences in chromatin modifications, linker length, as well as by binding of additional non-nucleosomal factors. Domain-wide differences in compaction have been observed, and these differences were correlated with regional variation in gene density, independent of gene expression level (29.Gilbert N. Boyle S. Fiegler H. Woodfine K. Carter N.P. Bickmore W.A. Cell. 2004; 118: 555-566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). More localized fluctuations in chromatin compaction have also been observed, e.g. at and around active promoters (30.Sabo P.J. Hawrylycz M. Wallace J.C. Humbert R. Yu M. Shafer A. Kawamoto J. Hall R. Mack J. Dorschner M.O. McArthur M. Stamatoyannopoulos J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 16837-16842Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 31.Gheldof N. Tabuchi T.M. Dekker J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In this approach, we combine spatial distance information obtained by in vivo observations, with information about the conformation of chromatin obtained by chromosome conformation capture (3C) 2The abbreviations used are: 3C, chromosome conformation capture; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; GFP, green fluorescent protein.2The abbreviations used are: 3C, chromosome conformation capture; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; GFP, green fluorescent protein. (32.Dekker J. Rippe K. Dekker M. Kleckner N. Science. 2002; 295: 1306-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (2460) Google Scholar). We have applied this approach to a 95-kb GC-rich chromosomal domain on chromosome III in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our results show that this chromatin domain is highly flexible with a mass density of ∼1.2–2.4 nucleosomes per 11 nm, which is well below the value of 6 nucleosomes per 11 nm predicted for a canonical 30 nm fiber. A neighboring AT-rich domain was found to be more compact with a mass density between 1.8 and 3.6 nucleosomes per 11 nm. Our results are consistent with a highly extended chromatin fiber, with variation in compaction at the level of sub-chromosomal domains.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChromosome Conformation Capture—3C was performed with intact cells (strain NKY2997: MATa, ho::LYS2, lys2, ura3, nuc1::LEU2) as described for nuclei (32.Dekker J. Rippe K. Dekker M. Kleckner N. Science. 2002; 295: 1306-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (2460) Google Scholar), with the following adaptations. Cells were grown in YPD medium (1% (w/v) Bacto-yeast extract, 2% (w/v) Bacto-peptone, 2% (w/v) glucose) until A600 = 1.0. Cells were resuspended in 200 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol and incubated at room temperature for 2 min. Cells were resuspended in 0.4 m Sorbitol, 0.4 m KCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 40 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.2) and incubated at 30 °C in the presence of 0.2 mg/ml Zymolyase for 30 min. The resulting spheroplasts were washed three times in 0.1 m MES, 1.2 m Sorbitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm MgCl2 (pH 6.4) and resuspended in the same buffer. Formaldehyde was added to a final concentration of 1%, and samples were incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Glycine was added to a final concentration of 125 mm, and samples were incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Chromatin was solubilized by adding SDS (0.1% final concentration) followed by incubation at 65 °C for 10 min. Triton was added to a concentration of 1%. Chromatin was digested with EcoRI at 37 °C for 18 h. Digestion efficiency was ∼70% and did not vary significantly between sites (Ref. 33.Dekker J. Genome Biol. 2007; 8: R116Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, and not shown). EcoRI was inactivated by addition of SDS to a final concentration of 1.6%, and samples were incubated at 65 °C for 20 min. Chromatin was diluted to 2.5 ng/μl, and Triton X-100 was added to 1%. DNA was ligated for 2 h at 16 °C using T4 ligase. The cross-links were reversed by overnight incubation at 65 °C in the presence of 5 μg/ml Proteinase K, and DNA was purified by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation.A randomized control PCR template was generated by digestion and random ligation of purified yeast genomic DNA (NKY2997). The randomized control template contains all ligation products in equal molar ratios and is used to correct for differences in efficiency of PCR amplification of 3C ligation products. All templates were titrated to determine the linear range of PCR, and all quantifications of interaction frequencies were performed using template concentrations that were in the linear dynamic range of PCR. All primers were designed in a unidirectional fashion along the yeast genome to prevent detection of self-ligated partial digestion products (see Refs. 32.Dekker J. Rippe K. Dekker M. Kleckner N.

Interaction frequencies between loci were calculated in triplicate by determination of the ratio of the amount of ligation product detected by PCR with the 3C template divided by the amount of ligation product detected by PCR with the randomized control template (32.Dekker J.

The average enrichment (Log2) for genes in the AT-rich domain (n = 37) was 0.04 (S.E. ± 0.057). The enrichment (Log2) for genes in the GC-rich domain (n = 59) was 0.25 (S.E. ± 0.042). The difference in enrichment (Log2) was 0.21 (S.E. ± 0.071). This corresponds to a 1.15-fold higher cross-linking efficiency for chromatin in the GC-rich domain. When we analyzed the enrichment of intergenic regions (n = 39 for the AT-rich domain, n = 46 for the GC-rich domain) in the cross-linked fraction we found a similar fold difference (1.13-fold p < 0.01, t test).RESULTSThe mass density of chromatin will affect the average distance between two loci. However, the spatial distance between two loci does not by itself provide sufficient information to determine the level of compaction. This is illustrated by two extreme situations in Fig. 1. The chromatin fiber can be very compact and relatively stiff (Fig. 1, A and B, left panels) or the fiber can be relatively extended and highly flexible (Fig. 1, A and B, right panels). In these examples differences in flexibility allow two loci to be separated by the same spatial distance despite significant differences in chromatin compaction. Therefore, the mass density of the chromatin fiber can only be determined when both the average distance between two loci and the flexibility of the intervening chromatin fiber are known (Fig. 2A).FIGURE 2Determination of mass density in intact yeast cells. A, schematic representation of the strategy to measure the level of chromatin compaction. The spatial distance between the HMR and MATa loci was determined by targeting GFP to these sites followed by fluorescence microscopy and three-dimensional reconstitution. The spatial conformation of the intervening chromatin was determined by 3C. B, spatial distances between HMR and MATa. Data are taken from Simon and co-workers (36.Simon P. Houston P. Broach J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2282-2291Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Distances were grouped in bins of 300 nm and the frequency of each bin is plotted. The average spatial distance was determined as described in the text. C, interaction frequencies between a number of loci located between HMR and MATa were determined in triplicate by 3C and plotted against site separation (see Table 2). Error bars indicate standard error of the mean. The arrow indicates the data point corresponding to the interaction between HMR and MATa. The solid line indicates the fit to Equation 4. D, Mass density L was plotted against three-dimensional spatial distance between HMR and MATa (r(HMR-MATa)) using Equation 9 for X(HMR-MATa) = 0.38 and [k × L–3] = 1002 m–1 nm–3 kb3 (solid line) and for [k × L–3] = 1460 m–1 nm–3 and 544 m–1 nm–3 (dotted lines; these values represent the 95% confidence interval based on the standard deviation of [k × L–3]). The range of values for L are indicated that correspond to r(HMR-MATa) = 463 nm ± two times the standard deviation (33 nm).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We describe a strategy that combines in vivo distance data with measurements of chromatin flexibility in intact cells to determine the mass density of chromatin and applied it to analysis of a 95-kb GC-rich chromatin domain on the right arm of chromosome III of the yeast S. cerevisiae (Fig. 2A). This domain is flanked by the MATa locus on the left and the HMR locus on the right.Determination of the Average Spatial Distance between MAT and HMR—The spatial distance between MATa and HMR has been analyzed in a cells (36.Simon P. Houston P. Broach J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2282-2291Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These authors introduced Lac repressor binding sites at the MATa locus and Tet repressor binding sites at the HMR locus in a strain expressing GFP-LacI and GFP-TetR fusion proteins. Binding of these fusion proteins to their binding sites resulted in the formation of fluorescent spots that marked the positions of HMR and MATa in living cells (see Ref. 36.Simon P. Houston P. Broach J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2282-2291Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar for details). Fluorescence microscopy and three-dimensional reconstruction were used to determine the position of each locus. We used the data from Simon et al. (36.Simon P. Houston P. Broach J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2282-2291Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) to determine the average spatial distance between HMR and MATa. In this dataset distances smaller than 200 nm could not be resolved as the two GFP spots merged into one (36.Simon P. Houston P. Broach J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2282-2291Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). For cells in which only a single GFP spot was observed, the spatial distance was therefore between 0 and 200 nm, and we assumed the average spatial distance in this sub-population to be 100 nm. For the remaining cells where two GFP spots could be detected, the actual measured three-dimensional distance was used (Fig. 2B). We determined that the average spatial distance between HMR and MATa for the entire cell population was 463 nm (S.E. = 33 nm). This distance is comparable to data reported by Bystricky and co-workers (37.Bystricky K. Heun P. Gehlen L. Langowski J. Gasser S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 16495-16500Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) who found that pairs of loci on yeast chromosome 14 separated by 90 kb were located on average 440 nm apart, and a pair of loci on the same chromosome separated by 98 kb were 417 nm apart.Determination of Chromosome Conformation of the MATa-HMR Domain—The conformation and flexibility of chromatin in intact cells can be determined using the 3C method (32.Dekker J. Rippe K. Dekker M. Kleckner N. Science. 2002; 295: 1306-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (2460) Google Scholar). 3C is used to determine interaction frequencies between genomic loci using formaldehyde cross-linking followed by detection and quantification of cross-linked sequences by PCR. 3C has been described in detail elsewhere (32.Dekker J.

Previously we have analyzed this chromosomal region using 3C with nuclei isolated from α-factor-arrested cells. Because the three-dimensional distance data were obtained using non-arrested intact cells, we wished to perform 3C using intact yeast cells as well, which required minor adaptations of our 3C protocol (see Refs. 32.Dekker J.

Using intact cells we determined 30 interaction frequencies between 19 restriction fragments located in between MATa and HMR (see Table 1 for 3C primer sequences and Table 2 for 3C data).

In this study, we investigated a possible interaction between Eag1 and signaling routes known to be relevant for tumor progression. The hypoxic intratumoral environment promotes the activation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), which is a key transcription factor influencing a broad spectrum of functions. Among them, neo-vascularization through transcriptional activation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has become a promising target for cancer therapy as neoangiogenesis has a major influence on tumor progression (e.g. Ref. 22Collins I. Workman P. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 689-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). In the presence of normal oxygen conditions, the regulated subunit of HIF-1 (HIF-1α; Refs. 23Ivan M. Kondo K.

The E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for this process contains pVHL (von-Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressing factor), a well-established tumor suppressor (26Kaelin Jr., W.G. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 673-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). Previous reports show an influence of pVHL in the functional expression of Eag1 in neuroblastoma cells (27Murata H. Tajima N.

We designed the present study to elucidate a possible cross-talk between Eag1 and the hypoxia homeostasis system. Cell Culture—All parental cell lines were obtained from DSMZ (Germany) and maintained according to the instructions of the provider. Transient transfections were performed using Fugene (Roche Applied Science). Stable transfectants were selected and maintained using Zeocin (Calya, 3 μg/ml in culture medium). 24 h after transfection, transiently transfected cells were transferred to hypoxic conditions for 4 h. Culturing under hypoxia was performed by N2 injection in an oxygen-controlling chamber (Labotec). Flow Cytometry—Cells were incubated for 20 h in the absence of selective pressure, washed twice with cold PBS, and fixed for 30 min with 4% p-formaldehyde at 4 °C. Fixed cells were scraped from the flask, washed three times, and permeabilized with 0.3% saponin for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were then incubated with 10% bovine serum albumin, 0.15% saponin for 15 min to block nonspecific binding, and incubated for 2 h at 4°C with HIF-1a antibody (AB463, BD Biosciences) diluted 1:100 in 0.1% saponin/2% bovine serum albumin in PBS (PBS-SB). Cells were washed three times with PBS-SB and then incubated 1.5 h with a Cy5-conjugated anti-mouse antibody diluted 1:5000 in PBS-SB. Cells were again washed three times and assessed for Cy5 fluorescence using a BD FACSAria flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany) with 633-nm laser excitation. Forward and side scatter were used to detect and discard cell fragments and doublets. Data are presented as average fluorescence. VEGF ELISA—Mock-transfected, Clone A, Clone B, and Clone C HEK293 cells were counted and plated at the same density in 25 cm2 flasks. Cells were cultured overnight with medium containing the selective agent Zeocin (3 μg/ml), after which the media was changed and cultured for 20 h without selection pressure. Cell culture supernatant was removed and centrifuged to remove cell particulates and detached cells, then assayed for secreted VEGF (Quantikine VEGF ELISA assay kit, R&D Systems). Cells in the flask were stained with propidium iodide and counted using a flow cytometer. Luciferase Assay—Mock-transfected and Clone A cells were counted and plated at the same density in 6-well plates. Cells were then transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 in Optimem with Bartrons HRE vector for 4 h, after which the medium was changed to normal growth medium. Luminescence was assayed using a Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay from Roche Applied Science. Western Blot—For HIF1α detection, cells were lysed in 10 mm Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 5 mm dithiothreitol, Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Roche Applied Science), and 8 m urea and to minimize HIF degradation, homogenized using an UltraTurrax device, centrifuged (14,000 × g 15 min), and the supernatant was used as total cell extract. Protein concentration was determined using BCA (Pierce). Protein extracts were separated by gradient SDS-PAGE (either 3–8 or 4–12%) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked with 0.1% casein (Roche Applied Science) and incubated with the corresponding antibody. Antibody against HIF1α (BD Transduction Laboratories) was used at 0.5–1 μg/ml overnight in a humidified chamber. After washing and incubation with appropriate peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody, blots were developed using Millipore Immobilon system. Signals were detected in a Bio-Rad Chem-Doc luminescence detection system. Mouse Models—MDA-MB-435S (8 × 106), CHO (2 × 106), or NIH3T3 cells (6 × 106) were implanted into the flank of 8-week-old female scid mice (Taconic). End point experiments were carried out for 3 weeks. For tumor growth inhibition experiments, treatment started after the tumors reached a size of 2 mm in diameter, daily via an oral feeder. Astemizole (Sigma) was prepared as stock solution (50 mg/ml) in DMSO and diluted in phosphate-buffered saline prior to administration. As a positive control, 5 mg/kg cyclophosphamide (Sigma) was administered to the animals using the same protocol. Body weight and tumor size (using a caliper) were measured every 2 days. To minimize errors, the same operator always measured the tumors. Tumor weight was determined ex vivo at the end of the experiment. Immunohistochemistry—Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tumor sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated in a series of xylol and ethanol solutions. Antigen retrieval was performed in a microwave oven in 10 mm citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 15 min. Slides were incubated overnight in a humidified chamber at 4 °C with anti CD34, anti VEGF receptor, anti-Factor VIII (all from Abcam) or anti-CD31 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and immunoreactivity was detected using the Envision Peroxidase System and DAB (DAKO). Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and thereafter dehydrated and mounted in xylol-based mounting medium. The quantification of vascular surface was performed by a blinded operator using ImageJ software on 25 high power fields (400×) from each sample acquired. Open Channel Blockade of Eag1 Channels Reduces Tumor Progression in Vivo—Because inhibition of Eag1 by the open channel blockers astemizole and imipramine has been reported to inhibit proliferation of several cell types in vitro (7Ouadid-Ahidouch H. Le Bourhis X. Roudbaraki M. Toillon R.A. Delcourt P. Prevarskaya N. Recept. Channels. 2001; 7: 345-356PubMed Google Scholar, 13Gavrilova-Ruch O. Schönherr K. Gessner G. Schönherr R. Klapperstuck T. Wohlrab W. Heinemann S.H. J. Membr. Biol. 2002; 188: 137-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), we tested if similar effects could be observed in vivo. CHO cells expressing Eag1 were implanted into SCID mice and astemizole (50 mg/kg) administered daily via oral gavage once palpable tumors had developed. Astemizole was selected instead of imipramine as it does not pass the blood-brain barrier and should therefore have little effect on intracranial Eag1. Tumor growth induced by implantation of Eag1-expressing cells was clearly inhibited in the group treated with astemizole (Fig. 1A), similar to growth inhibition observed after treatment with the well-established cytotoxic drug cyclophosphamide (CPM) (applied at the maximal tolerable dose of 5 mg/kg). The antitumoral effect of astemizole can be at least partially attributed to Eag1 blockade, as no growth inhibition occurred after application of astemizole in wild-type CHO cell tumors (Fig. 1B). We subsequently tested the effect of astemizole on the slowly growing human cancer xenograft model MDA-MB435S. This cell line expresses Eag1, but not HERG (a relative of Eag1 that is very effectively blocked by astemizole and has also been implicated in tumor progression (28Arcangeli A. Novartis Found Symp. 2005; 266 (discussion 232–224): 225-232Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). Astemizole was again able to inhibit tumor progression nearly as effectively as cyclophosphamide (Fig. 1C) without noticeable toxic effects. These results indicate that reducing ion permeation through Eag1 reduces tumor progression in vivo, in good agreement with results reported using a specific anti-Eag1 antibody (14Gomez-Varela D. Zwick-Wallasch E. Knotgen H. Sanchez A. Hettmann T. Ossipov D. Weseloh R. Contreras-Jurado C. Rothe M. Stuhmer W. Pardo L.A. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 7343-7349Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Eliminating Ion Permeation Does Not Abolish Tumor Formation by Xenografted NIH3T3 Cells in Vivo—This effect of astemizole may indicate that potassium permeation is required for Eag1 to favor tumor growth. If potassium permeation is the only feature of Eag1 channels relevant to tumor progression, elimination of ion permeation (through a point mutation in the pore region) should also abolish Eag1-induced tumor progression in vivo. For these experiments NIH3T3 and CHO cells were used as xenograft models. Wild-type or mock-transfected NIH3T3 cells induce no tumors when implanted into SCID mice, while Eag1-expressing cells do. Previous experiments demonstrated that tumors arising from the implantation of Eag1-transfected CHO cells into SCID mice are larger and more aggressive than those generated by wild-type CHO cells (5Pardo L.A. del Camino D. Sánchez A. Alves F. Brüggemann A. Beckh S. Stühmer W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5540-5547Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Ion permeation was abolished by mutating a glycine residue in the signature sequence of the pore region (MTSVGFGN) to serine (G440S). This strategy has already been successfully applied to several ion channels, including Eag family members (29Schonherr R. Gessner G. Lober K. Heinemann S.H. FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 204-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To verify that the protein was synthesized and functional, RNA encoding the mutant channel was injected into Xenopus oocytes and electrophysiologically characterized. Although not permeating ions, correctly assembled and membrane resident channels should respond to membrane depolarizations by conformational changes that can be detected as capacitive currents (gating currents) by electrophysiological techniques. Expression of Eag1-G440S channels gave rise to gating currents with properties compatible with Eag1 (see supplemental information). Stable polyclonal NIH3T3 and CHO transfectants of the G440S mutant were implanted subcutaneously in the flank of female SCID mice. While previous experiments have shown that neither wild type nor vector-transfected NIH3T3 cells give rise to tumors in this system, G440S cells were found to produce tumors, albeit reduced in weight compared with wild-type Eag1 tumors (Fig. 2A). Therefore, ion permeation influences the oncogenic properties of Eag1, but it is not an absolute requirement. Comparable results were obtained when CHO cells were used (Fig. 2B) in two different strains of SCID mice (CB17 and scid/beige). G440S mutant channels induced tumors noticeably smaller than wild-type Eag1, but larger than mock- or Eag2-transfected cells. It is important to note that as an open channel blocker, astemizole locks the channel in the open conformation, while the G440S mutant can still undergo conformational transitions during gating. Eag1-expressing Tumors Show Increased Angiogenesis—In contrast to NIH3T3 cells, non-transfected CHO cells also form sizeable tumors. This allows a direct comparison of the structure of tumors derived from Eag1-positive and Eag1-negative cells. Structures morphologically compatible with blood vessels were observed in tumors of similar volume arising from wild-type or mock-transfected cells, but the frequency of these was greatly increased in tumors expressing Eag1 (Fig. 3A). Positive staining with the well-established endothelial marker CD31 (Fig. 3A, arrows inset) indicates the presence of endothelial cells and thus identifies the structures as capillaries, indicating that Eag1 expression favors the formation of vascular structures in tumors. Eag1 G440S expression induced similar morphologies in xenograft tumors (Fig. 3A, right), indicating that increased vascularization does not require potassium permeation. Quantification of vascularization by measurement of CD31, VEGF-R, or Factor VIII-positive structures (i.e. capillaries) in 25 high power fields from at least two tumors of each type confirmed increased vascular structure surface area in both Eag1 and Eag1 G440S-expressing tumors (Fig. 3B). In light of these data, a possible explanation for the retained tumorigenic ability of mutant permeation-deficient Eag1 channels could be increased vascularization in these tumors. This observation further supports the idea that to some degree the transformative properties of Eag1 are independent of its canonical function as an ion channel and may be instead dependent on an interference with the cellular oxygen homeostasis system. More abundant vascularization would increase oxygen and nutrient supply to tumor cells and represent a selective growth advantage for Eag1-expressing cells. Eag1 Expression Promotes VEGF Secretion in Vitro—Among the many factors influencing angiogenesis, VEGF appears to be predominant (30Kim K.J. Li B. Winer J. Armanini M. Gillett N. Phillips H.S. Ferrara N. Nature. 1993; 362: 841-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (3363) Google Scholar, 31Millauer B. Shawver L.K. Plate K.H. Risau W. Ullrich A. Nature. 1994; 367: 576-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar). VEGF has drawn intense attention in the field of oncology due both to its influence on tumor survival and to its potential use in cancer therapies. To test the possibility that the observed increase in vascularization of Eag1-expressing tumors correlates to an increase in secreted VEGF, we determined VEGF abundance in the culture supernatant of cells expressing Eag1. Determinations on the cell lines used for xenograft experiments showed (Fig. 4A) increased VEGF secretion in cells expressing both Eag1 and Eag1G440S. Commercially available antibodies and kits for the determination of VEGF are normally targeted to the human factor. These kits provide much better sensitivity and reproducibility on human samples and so HEK293 cells were selected for their human origin and ease-of-use. To discard artifacts due to genomic insertion, VEGF secretion was measured in three independent clones of the HEK293 cell line stably expressing Eag1 by ELISA (Clones A, B, and C) and compared with mock-transfected cells. All three Eag1-expressing cell lines were found to secrete significantly more VEGF than the non-transfected control (Fig. 4B). This VEGF increase correlates with the observed vascularization increase of Eag1-expressing tumors. Eag1 Increases HIF-1α—The most likely candidate for the up-regulation of VEGF in Eag1-transfected cells and increase in vascularization in Eag1-expressing tumors is a functional increase of HIF-1. To investigate this possibility, HIF-1α expression was examined using flow cytometry for HEK293 Clones A, B, and C with an anti-HIF-1α antibody and a fluorescently labeled (Cy5.5) secondary antibody. Compared with mock-transfected cells, the fluorescence histogram of each clone showed a rightward shift, consistent with an increase in HIF-1α content (Fig. 5A). The peak shift induced by Eag1 expression was much less intense under hypoxia. Quantitative comparison of the mean HIF-1α fluorescence values calculated for each cell line and normalized to mock-transfected cells is shown in Fig. 5B. Each clone displayed independently of oxygen concentration and culture conditions (data not shown) modest but significantly increased HIF-1α fluorescence over mock-transfected cells. To test whether this increase of HIF-1α can have functional implications, we studied the activity of a HIF-1 responsive promoter. This was done by determining the luciferase activity in both control and Eag1-expressing HEK293 cells transiently transfected with a reporter vector encoding luciferase under control of the HRE of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase (HRE-Luc) (32Obach M. Navarro-Sabaté A.J. C. Kong X. Duran J. Gómez M. Perales J.C. Ventura F. Rosa J.L. Bartrons R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53562-53570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Eag1-expressing cells (Clone A) maintained in normoxia showed a dramatic increase in luciferase activity compared with control cells after 48 h (Fig. 5C, left panel). Mock-hypoxic conditions induced by 200 μm CoCl2 treatment for 18 h resulted in luciferase activity increases in both control and transfected cells, while maintaining a similar increase in Eag1-expressing cells (Fig. 5C, right). Western blot analysis of cell extracts from cultures exposed to either 21 or 1% O2 did not consistently show increases in HIF-1α protein content. However, mild hypoxia (5% O2, 4 h; Fig. 5D) induced a clear increase in HIF1α abundance in Eag1-expressing cells. Because no increase in HIF was observed under normoxia, it is unlikely that the differences in HIF abundance can be attributed to an artifactual local hypoxia. A comparable elevation in HIF1α content was observed in transiently transfected cells when hypoxia (7% O2, 4 h) was applied 24 h after transfection (not shown). These results indicate that Eag1 expression induces an increase in HIF1α under mild hypoxia, which could reflect a shift on the threshold of the HIF-1 system. To investigate this, we determined the increase of HIF-1α activity over basal conditions in the presence of different concentrations of Co2+ in Eag1 and mock-transfected cells. Eag1-expressing cells were found to induce increased HIF-1α activity at lower concentrations of Co2+ (Fig. 5E). This finding could be interpreted as the result of interference of Eag1 with the HIF-1α control pathway. Altogether, these results suggest a causal relationship between the functional increase in HIF-1α and the increase of VEGF secretion observed in Eag1-expressing cell lines. Despite several studies implicating ectopic expression of Eag1 in many cancer cell lines and primary tumors (5Pardo L.A. del Camino D. Sánchez A. Alves F. Brüggemann A. Beckh S. Stühmer W.

FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 2850-2852Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), information regarding the mechanism of Eag1 contribution to oncogenesis has thus far remained unclear. Using a broad spectrum of techniques, we present evidence indicating that the oncogenic potential of Eag1 is partly independent of its primary physiological function as an ion channel. We also show a functional up-regulation of HIF-1 and VEGF in Eag1-expressing cells. We propose a possible mechanism by which Eag1 could favor tumor progression through increased angiogenesis under the characteristic hypoxia of tumor microenvironment. Eag1 inhibition has proven efficacious in reducing tumor cell proliferation in vitro. However, a point mutation in Eag1 that abolishes ion permeation failed to eliminate tumor induction in NIH3T3 cells in vivo. This observation strongly suggests that ion permeation is not essential for the tumor promoting activity of Eag1. While at first seeming incompatible with the reported ability of a functional antibody to inhibit tumor progression (14Gomez-Varela D. Zwick-Wallasch E. Knotgen H. Sanchez A. Hettmann T. Ossipov D. Weseloh R. Contreras-Jurado C. Rothe M. Stuhmer W. Pardo L.A. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 7343-7349Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), this result would be explained if the conformational changes normally accompanying gating constitute a significant part of the Eag1 tumorigenic signal; a blocked channel would be locked in a defined conformational state, whereas the mutant channel would still be able to undergo conformational changes. Therefore, properties of Eag1 other than ion permeation must influence cellular signaling, as has recently been proposed for Drosophila eag (33Hegle A.P. Marble D.D. Wilson G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 2886-2891Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and other voltage-gated channels (34Kaczmarek L.K. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 7: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The very high frequency of ectopic expression of Eag1 in primary tumors (9Mello de Queiroz F. Suarez-Kurtz G. Stühmer W. Pardo L.A. Mol. Cancer. 2006; 5: 42Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 10Hemmerlein B. Weseloh R.M. Queiroz F.M. d. Knötgen H. Sánchez A. Rubio M.E. Martin S. Schliephacke T. Jenke M. Heinz-Joachim-Radzun Stühmer W. Pardo L.A. Mol. Cancer. 2006; 5: 41Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) indicates that Eag1 expression confers a selective advantage to tumor cells under conditions that are common to the majority of neoplasms. Such a common condition could be hypoxia. The major immediate consequence of hypoxia is HIF-1 up-regulation, which is widely accepted as a hallmark of cancer physiology, both from our understanding of the tumor microenvironment and the role of HIF-1 target genes in cell proliferation, survival and angiogenesis (35Pouyssegur J. Dayan F. Mazure N.M. Nature. 2006; 441: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (1396) Google Scholar). Interestingly, mutations of both Eag1 and HIF prolyl-hydroxylase orthologs in Caenorhabditis elegans result in a similar egg-laying defect phenotype (reviewed in Ref. 36Schafer W.R. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2006; 40: 487-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The observed increase in HIF-1 activity in Eag1-expressing cells represents a novel explanation for the oncogenic potential of Eag1. The ectopic expression of Eag1 could thus have far reaching effects, as the increased secretion of growth factors and angiogenic-signaling molecules such as VEGF would have lasting effects within the local tumor microenvironment. Recently it has been reported that the related channel HERG also influences VEGF secretion in glioblastoma cell lines, although the mechanism by which this is achieved remains unclear (37Masi A. Becchetti A. Restano-Cassulini R. Polvani S. Hofmann G. Buccoliero A.M. Paglierani M. Pollo B. Taddei G.L. Gallina P. Di Lorenzo N. Franceschetti S. Wanke E. Arcangeli A. Br. J.

Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 7004-7011PubMed Google Scholar) described a negative correlation between pVHL and functional Eag1 expression. It is tempting to speculate that this interaction between the factor in charge of controlling the levels of HIF1 and Eag1 underlies the observed increase in HIF1 under mild hypoxia in Eag1-expressing cells, although this hypothesis requires direct testing. In summary, we have observed in this study a novel non-canonical contribution of an ion channel to tumor formation. While non-canonical protein functions have been proposed as relevant for the phenotypic changes induced in heterologous systems (e.g. Refs. 38Li Y.M. Zhou B.P. Deng J. Pan Y. Hay N. Hung M.C.

Knockdown of expression of lipin1 by small interfering RNA in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes almost completely inhibited differentiation into adipocytes, whereas overexpression of lipin1 accelerated adipocyte differentiation, demonstrating that lipin1 is required for adipocyte differentiation. In mature adipocytes, transfection of lipin1-small interfering RNA decreased the expression of adipocyte functional genes, indicating the involvement of lipin1 in the maintenance of adipocyte function. Lipin1 increases the transcription-activating function of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ2 (PPARγ2) via direct physical interaction, whereas lipin1 did not affect the function of other adipocyte-related transcription factors such as C/EBPα, liver X-activated receptor α, or sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c. In mature adipocytes, lipin1 was specifically recruited to the PPARγ-response elements of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene, an adipocyte-specific gene. C/EBPα up-regulates lipin1 transcription by directly binding to the lipin1 promoter. Based on the existence of a positive feedback loop between C/EBPα and PPARγ2, we propose that lipin1 functions as an amplifier of the network between these factors, resulting in the maintenance of high levels of the specific gene expression that are required for adipogenesis and mature adipocyte functions.

Thus, studying the molecular mechanisms that control adipose tissue development and function is important for understanding the pathophysiology of metabolic syndromes. Adipogenesis is a process in which premature cells acquire adipocyte-specific functions. A complex network of transcription factors is developed during this process in response to extracellular adipogenic stimuli. In 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cells the CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins β and δ (C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ) are induced immediately upon adipogenic hormonal stimuli, and they are expressed for approximately 2 days after which C/EBPα and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ2 (PPARγ2) are induced (10.Christy R.J. Kaestner K.H. Geiman D.E. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2593-2597Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 11.Clarke S.L. Robinson C.E. Gimble J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Expression of C/EBPα and PPARγ2 is induced by C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ during the early stage of adipogenesis. During the late stages of adipogenesis when the expression of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ has diminished, expression of C/EBPα and PPARγ2 is induced by each other, thereby keeping these proteins at high levels in mature adipocytes (12.Ramji D.P. Foka P. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 561-575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). C/EBPα and PPARγ2 activate the expression of genes important for adipocyte function, thereby maturing adipocytes and maintaining adipocyte-specific functions (13.Farmer S.R. Cell Metab. 2006; 4: 263-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar). Liver X-activated receptor α (LXRα) stimulates the expression of PPARγ2 by directly binding to the promoter region as well as up-regulating sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c), which induces PPARγ2 expression. Because PPARγ2 can up-regulate LXRα expression, the positive network between PPARγ2, LXRα, and SREBP-1c is also considered to be important during adipogenesis (14.Seo J.B. Moon H.M. Kim W.S. Lee Y.S. Jeong H.W. Yoo E.J. Ham J. Kang H. Park M.G. Steffensen K.R. Stulnig T.M. Gustafsson J.A. Park S.D. Kim J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3430-3444Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Lipin1 was discovered as a mutated gene in a fatty liver dystrophic (fld) mouse using a positional cloning approach (15.Peterfy M. Phan J. Xu P. Reue K. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). A null mutation in the lipin1 gene in these mice leads to lipodystrophy characterized by a severely reduced mass of adipose tissue and a deficiency in adipocyte differentiation (16.Reue K. Peterfy M. Curr. Atheroscler. Rep. 2000; 2: 390-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 17.Reue K. Xu P. Wang X.P. Slavin B.G. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lack of adipose tissue in fld mice results in insulin resistance (16.Reue K. Peterfy M. Curr. Atheroscler. Rep. 2000; 2: 390-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 17.Reue K. Xu P. Wang X.P. Slavin B.G. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and circulating hyperlipidemia (18.Langner C.A. Birkenmeier E.H. Ben-Zeev O. Schotz M.C. Sweet H.O. Davisson M.T. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7994-8003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In previous reports lipin1 was found to be expressed at a high level in adipose tissue (15.Peterfy M. Phan J. Xu P. Reue K. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar), and the expression level of lipin1 was positively correlated with insulin sensitivity, which is associated with adipocyte function (19.van Harmelen V. Ryden M. Sjolin E. Hoffstedt J. J. Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 201-206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These facts suggest that lipin1 plays an important role in adipogenesis and in the function of mature adipocytes. However, the molecular function and regulation of lipin1 remains unclear. Recently, the yeast homolog of lipin1 was reported to have phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase enzymatic activity (20.Han G.S. Wu W.I. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9210-9218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 21.Scavello Jr., G.S. Paluru P.C. Zhou J. White P.S. Rappaport E.F. Young T.L. Mol. Vis. 2005; 11: 97-110PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase creates diacylglycerol from phosphatidic acid, which is the rate-limiting step in triacylglycerol synthesis. A defect in triacylglycerol synthesis is known to block adipocyte differentiation (22.Gale S.E. Frolov A. Han X. Bickel P.E. Cao L. Bowcock A. Schaffer J.E. Ory D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 11082-11089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Therefore, the phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase activity of lipin1 relates to the molecular function of lipin1 in adipogenesis. However, there are several lines of evidence that suggest the possibility of a nuclear function for lipin1 as well. Two domains of lipin1 are highly conserved among species, the N-terminal conserved domain (NLIP) and the C-terminal conserved domain (CLIP). NLIP domain is known to interact with several nuclear proteins (23.Tange Y. Hirata A. Niwa O. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4375-4385Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Although lipin1 lacks a DNA binding domain, a yeast homolog of lipin1 was found in the promoter regions of genes involved in phospholipid biosynthesis (24.Santos-Rosa H. Leung J. Grimsey N. Peak-Chew S. Siniossoglou S. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1931-1941Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), suggesting that lipin1 could be involved in the regulation of gene transcription by interacting with transcription factors. Furthermore, recent studies found that lipin1 acts as an amplifier of PPARα action by increasing the interaction between peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α) and PPARα in liver (25.Finck B.N. Gropler M.C. Chen Z. Leone T.C. Croce M.A. Harris T.E. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Kelly D.P. Cell Metab. 2006; 4: 199-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). In this study we investigated the expression of lipin1 and examined its potential role in adipogenesis. We also found that lipin1 increases the transcription-activating function of PPARγ2 via direct a physical interaction and is up-regulated at the transcriptional level by C/EBPα. These results provide compelling evidence that lipin1 reinforces the positive feedback loop between C/EBPα and PPARγ2, which is essential for adipogenesis and the maintenance of adipocyte functions. Cell Culture, in Vitro Differentiation—3T3-L1 and NIH3T3 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were propagated and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% calf serum. For in vitro differentiation, 2-days post-confluent (designated day 0) cells were treated with DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 520 μm 3-isobutyl-1-methylzanthine, 1 μm dexamethasone, and 167 nm insulin until day 2. The medium was then replaced and incubated with DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 167 nm insulin until day 4. The medium was then replaced with DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, which was renewed daily until day 8. NIH3T3 cells were propagated and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Western Blot Analysis—Cultured cells for Western blot analysis were washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline and then harvested with whole cell lysis buffer (1% SDS, 60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8), heated at 100 °C for 10 min, and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 5 min at room temperature. Supernatants were transferred to new tubes and used for Western blot analysis. Plasmid Constructs, Transfections, and Luciferase Assays—To generate the lipin1β-V5 expression vector, full-length lipin1β (accession number BC018071) cDNA was amplified by PCR using the primers 5′-CACCATGAATTACGTGGGGCAGTTA-3′ and 5′-CGCTGAGGCAGAATGAATGTCCTG-3′ and cloned into the pcDNA3.1-V5/His-TOPO expression vector (Invitrogen) and pSG5-FLAG-tagged expression vector, resulting in pcDNA-lipin1β-V5 and pSG5-FLAG-lipin1β. The pSG5-FLAG-lipin1β (1–441) was generated by self-ligation after the removal of BamHI fragment from pSG5-FLAG-lipin1β. The pSG5-FLAG-lipin1-(425–926) were produced by cloning lipin1 cDNA fragment amplified using primers 5′-ACGAAGCCGACATCTTGGTGCT-3′ and 5′-CGCTGAGGCAGAATGAATGTCCTG-3′ into pSG5-FLAG-tagged expression vector. The expression plasmids pCMV-rC/EBPα and pCMV-rC/EBPβ were gifts from Dr. J. R. Cardinaux (Centre de Neurosciences Psychiatriques, Lausanne, Switzerland). The expression plasmids pCMX-mPPARγ, pCMX-mRXRα, pCMX-mLXRα, and 3xLXRE-tk-LUC were gifts from Dr. D. Mangelsdorf (26.Peet D.J. Janowski B.A. Mangelsdorf D.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 571-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The pSG5-HA-PPARγ, pSG5-HA-PPARγ-(1–273), and pSG5-HA-PPARγ-(274–475) were generated from pCMX-mPPARγ by cloning respective mPPARγ cDNA into pSG5-HA-tagged expression vector. The expression plasmid pCMV7-hSREBP-1c was previously described (27.Kim H.I. Kim J.W. Kim S.H. Cha J.Y. Kim K.S. Ahn Y.H. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1517-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The 3xPPRE-tk-LUC plasmid, which contains three copies of the PPARγ-response element and a luciferase reporter gene, was received from Jae-Bum Kim (14.Seo J.B. Moon H.M. Kim W.S. Lee Y.S. Jeong H.W. Yoo E.J. Ham J. Kang H. Park M.G. Steffensen K.R. Stulnig T.M. Gustafsson J.A. Park S.D. Kim J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3430-3444Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The human FAS promoter-luciferase reporter plasmid containing the sequences from -2.7 to +1.8 kilobases of the FANS gene, was previously described (28.Lee, M. Y., Moon, J. S., Park, S. W., Koh, Y. K., Ahn, Y. H., and Kim, K. S. (2008) Biochem. J., in pressGoogle Scholar). The human G6Pase promoter-luciferase reporter plasmid, human glucose-6-phosphatase (-1227/+57), which contains a 1.2-kilobase-proximal promoter fragment extending from nt -1227 to +57, was a gift from Dr. D. Schmoll (29.Schmoll D. Walker K.S. Alessi D.R. Grempler R. Burchell A. Guo S. Walther R. Unterman T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36324-36333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The human lipin1 promoter-luciferase reporter plasmid, pGL3BA-hLipin1, was constructed by generating a lipin1 gene fragment extending from nt -1300 to +524 via PCR using the primers 5′-TCAGCAGTTTTGGGCAGCCGTGAT-3′ and 5′-AACTGCAGCGCTGGAATCCTAACT-3′ and then cloning the fragment into the pGL3-basic-acceptor luciferase vector. The pGL3-basic-acceptor luciferase was generated by inserting the splicing acceptor sequence consisting of 163 bp to the 3′ end of the first intron and 19 bp to the 5′ end of the 2nd exon of rat ACLY gene at HindIII site of pGL3-Basic. The pRL-SV40 construct, which was the expression vector of renilla luciferase, was obtained from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI). For transfection of NIH3T3, cells were plated in 10-cm plates or 6-well plates 1 day before transfection. When the cells reached 60–80% confluency, they were transiently transfected with plasmids using Lipofectamine PLUS™ (Invitrogen) following the supplier's protocol. For transfection of 3T3-L1, cells were plated at 8 × 105 cells/60-mm dish or 3 × 105 cells per 30-mm dish 1 day before transfection. When the cells reached 90–95% confluency, they were transiently transfected with plasmids using FuGENE® HD Transfection Reagent (Roche Applied Science) following the supplier's protocol. Luciferase activities in whole cell lysates were measured using a Dual-Luciferase® reporter assay system (Promega). The luciferase activity was normalized to the level of renilla luciferase activities of each cell lysate using a pRL-SV40 construct. Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)—siRNA oligonucleotides specific for regions in the lipin1 mRNA were constructed according to the manufacturer's protocol for the Silencer® siRNA construction kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Several siRNA oligonucleotides were screened and tested for their ability to silence lipin1 expression. The most active of these oligonucleotides for lipin1 (sense, 5′-GGAACUCUGUAGACAGAAUtt-3′; antisense, 5′-AUUCUGUCUACAGAGUUCCtc-3′) effectively blocked the expression of lipin1. Negative control #1 siRNA (Ambion) was used as a control. For transfection, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were plated at 8 × 105 cells per 60-mm dish 1 day before transfection. Fifty nanomolar double-stranded 21-mer siRNA was transfected into 3T3-L1 cells using 15 μl of RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Confluency of the cells at the time of transfection was ∼90–95%. The cells were incubated in medium containing the siRNA-RNAiMAX complex for 6 h. The medium was then replaced with DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum, and the cells were incubated for additional 12 h until they were just confluent. The medium was then replaced with that containing the conventional hormonal stimuli. Reverse Transcription and Real-time PCR—Total RNA was purified from cultured cells with TRIzol® reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using oligo dT-primers with SuperScript™ II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) following the supplier's protocol. Quantitative real-time PCR analyses were performed on the 7300 Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using SYBR® Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Each assay was performed in triplicate and included four serial dilution points of a control cDNA, a no-template control, and each sample cDNA. The relative concentrations of the genes of interest, and the endogenous control (actin) were calculated by plotting the threshold cycle (Ct) versus the log of the serial dilution points. The relative expression of the gene of interest was determined after normalizing to the endogenous control. The sequences of primers used for real-time PCR can be found in Table 1.TABLE 1Oligonucleotides used in PCR and ChIP assayNameSequenceMouse lipin1 sense5′-CGA TGG ATG GAA GCA GAA CTC-3′Mouse lipin1 antisense α5′-AGC CTG AAG GAC TGG GGC TGG-3′Mouse lipin1 antisense β5′-AAG ACT GCA GAG GAC AAG AGC-3′Mouse lipin1 antisense Total5′-TGG GAT ACG ATG CTG ACT-3′Mouse C/EBPβ sense5′-CAA GCT GAG CGA CGA GTA CA-3′Mouse C/EBPβ antisense5′-CAG CTG CTC CAC CTT CTT CT-3′Mouse PPARγ2 sense5′-CCA GAG CAT GGT GCC TTC GCT-3′Mouse PPARγ2 antisense5′-CAG CAA CCA TTG GGT CAG CTC-3′Mouse C/EBPα sense5′-GAA CAG CAA CGA GTA CCG GGT A-3′Mouse C/EBPα antisense5′-GCC ATG GCC TTG ACC AAG GAG-3′Mouse aP2 sense5′-GAA CCT GGA AGC TTG TCT TCG-3′Mouse aP2 antisense5′-ACC AGC TTG TCA CCA TCT CG-3′Mouse PEPCK sense5′-TCA TCA TCA CCC AAG AGC AGA G-3′Mouse PEPCK antisense5′-CTT TCA TGC ACC CTG GGA AC-3′Mouse GLUT4 sense5′-TCG TCA TTG GCA TTC TGG TTG-3′Mouse GLUT4 antisense5′-AGC TCG TTC TAC TAA GAG CAC G-3′Mouse SREBP-1c sense5′-GGA GCC ATG GAT TGC ACA TT-3′Mouse SREBP-1c antisense5′-CTG AGT GTT TCC TGG AAG G-3′Mouse LXRα sense5′-GAG AAG CTG GTG GCT GCC CA-3′Mouse LXRα antisense5′-AGC TGT AGG AAG CCA GGG AG-3′Mouse β-actin sense5′-TTG TAA CCA ACT GGG ACG ATA TGG-3′Mouse β-actin antisense5′-CGA CCA GAG GCA TAC AGG GAC AAC-3′PEPCK (–1096/–665) sense5′-TCTGAACTCCGACAAGCAAGCTCT-3′PEPCK (–1096/–665) antisense5′-ACGTACATACTGACCCCTGCTCT-3′PEPCK (–665/–375) sense5′-AGAGCAGGGGTCAGTATGTACGTA-3′PEPCK (–665/–375) antisense5′-TGGACTTCATATGTTGCTGGCTGC-3′PEPCK (–2998/–2722) sense5′-GCCTCTCTCTCTATATATATAAAT–3′PEPCK (–2998/–2722) antisense5′-ATCTATCTATCTATCTACCCATCT-3′PPARγ2 (–537/–375) sense5′-TATCTGGTGTTTCATAACTTAGAGATTAAG-3′PPARγ2 (–537/–375) antisense5′-ATTACAAGGAAAACGTTGCTACATTGTCTC-3′SREBP–1c (–410/–170) antisense5′-GAACCAGCGGTGGGAACACAGAGC-3′SREBP–1c (–410/–170) asense5′-GACGGCGGCAGCTCGGGTTTCTC-3′FAS (–227/–50) sense5′-GACGGAAGCAGGCGGGGGCT-3′ Open table in a new tab Oil Red O Staining—Cultured cells for Oil Red O staining were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline then fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 2 min at room temperature. After 1 wash with water, cells were added to the Oil Red O working solution (0.5% Oil Red O in isopropanol:water, ratio 3:2) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The Oil Red O solution was then aspirated, and stained cells were washed with water and then observed. Coimmunoprecipitation Assay—For coimmunoprecipitation assays, PPARγ and lipin1 were overexpressed in NIH3T3 cells as indicated in Fig. 6. Transfected cells were incubated for 2 days, then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, scraped off, and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 2 min at 4 °C. Pellets were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.3% Nonidet P-40) and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were transferred to a new tube after which 1-ml aliquots were rotated with 20 μl of protein A/G plus-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) for 10 min at 4 °C and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 3 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were transferred to a new tube and incubated with rotation for 12 h at 4 °C with anti-V5 or anti-HA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The lysates were then added to 20 μl of protein A/G plus-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and rotated for 90 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 3 min at 4 °C, the pellets were resuspended in wash buffer (lysis buffer:phosphate-buffered saline, 1:2) then incubated with rotation for 10 min at 4 °C. This wash step was repeated three times, and then the immunoprecipitants were heated with SDS-containing sample buffer at 95 °C for 5 min after which Western blotting was performed using either an anti-PPARγ antibody or an anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma-Aldrich). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—To confirm lipin1 recruitment into the promoter region on which PPARγ or other factors bind, a ChIP assay was carried out using a rabbit polyclonal anti-lipin1 antibody (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and ChIP assay kit (Millipore) following the supplier's protocol with in vitro differentiated 3T3-L1 mature adipocytes (day 8) and 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (day 0). 3T3-L1 cells cultured in 6-cm dishes were treated with formaldehyde at the indicated time points. The cross-linked adducts were resuspended and sonicated, resulting in DNA fragments of 200 to 1000 bp. Then the fragmented chromatin samples were immunoprecipitated with anti-lipin1 antibody. Immunoprecipitated chromatin samples were reverse-cross-linked and purified and then analyzed by PCR. DNA prepared from chromatin samples served as a positive control (input). DNA prepared from chromatin samples immunoprecipitated without antibody served as a negative control. The sequences of the PCR primers can be found in Table 1. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—To confirm the binding of C/EBPα to the putative C/EBPα-binding sequence in the lipin1 promoter, a gel retardation assay was performed. The oligonucleotide encoding the putative C/EBPα-binding site in the lipin1 promoter was used as probe. Wild-type and mutant oligonucleotides were used as competitors. The sequence of the wild-type oligonucleotide probe was (-647) 5′-ATAACGTCTGGTGGTGAAATGATTTCCATCAA-3′ (-678), and the sequence of the mutant oligonucleotide probe was (-647) 5′-ATAACGTCTGGTGGTAACCAGATTTCCATCAA-3′ (-678), where the italicized bases indicate the putative C/EBPα-binding site, and the underlined bases are mutated. The 32P-labeled probe was incubated with 5 μg of either cell extract from NIH3T3 cells that overexpressed C/EBPα or from cells that had been transfected with the empty vector. After loading the reaction mixtures onto a PAGE gel, the bands were examined and compared. Lipin1 Is Induced in the Late Stages of Adipocyte Differentiation—To determine the function of lipin1 in white adipose tissue, lipin1 expression was examined during adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, which is a well characterized differentiation model after exposure of the cells to adipogenic hormonal stimuli (30.Ntambi J.M. Buhrow S.A. Kaestner K.H. Christy R.J. Sibley E. Kelly Jr., T.J. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17291-17300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During adipocyte differentiation, expression of lipin1 mRNA began to increase 2 days after induction of differentiation and was continuously elevated further, thereby reaching a maximum level in mature adipocytes (Fig. 1A). Lipin1 mRNA undergoes alternative splicing creating two isoforms, lipin1α and lipin1β. Lipin1β is a longer form containing an insertion of 33 amino acids (31.Peterfy M. Phan J. Reue K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32883-32889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). During the maturation of adipocytes, the increase of lipin1α (the shorter isoform of lipin1) is less than that of lipin1β (Fig. 1A). As previously reported (10.Christy R.J. Kaestner K.H. Geiman D.E.

C/EBPα and PPARγ2 are known to induce adipocyte-specific genes such as phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and adipocyte/macrophage fatty acid-binding protein (aP2) (13.Farmer S.R. Cell Metab. 2006; 4: 263-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar, 33.Bogacka I. Xie H. Bray G.A. Smith S.R.

Biochimie (Paris). 2003; 85: 1257-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Additionally, the expression pattern of PEPCK and aP2 was similar to that of C/EBPα, PPARγ2, and lipin1 (Fig. 1A). Consistent with their involvement in adipocyte maturation (14.Seo J.B. Moon H.M. Kim W.S. Lee Y.S. Jeong H.W. Yoo E.J. Ham J. Kang H. Park M.G. Steffensen K.R. Stulnig T.M. Gustafsson J.A. Park S.D. Kim J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3430-3444Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), the expression of LXRα and SREBP-1c expression also persisted through the maturation of 3T3-L1 cells (Fig. 1A). The levels of lipin1 protein strictly coincide with those of its mRNA, increasing 2 days after the onset of hormonal stimulation and reaching high levels in mature adipocytes (Fig. 1B). The protein levels of C/EBPβ, C/EBPα, and PPARγ2 also match with those of their mRNA. Taken together, these findings indicate that lipin1 was induced at a late stage and maintained at a high level in mature adipocytes in a pattern that was similar to the late adipogenic factors C/EBPα and PPARγ2 rather than the early adipogenic factor, C/EBPβ.

https://openalex.org/W2025085818,"Cellular signaling networks have evolved to enable swift and accurate responses, even in the face of genetic or environmental perturbation. Thus, genetic screens may not identify all the genes that regulate different biological processes. Moreover, although classical screening approaches have succeeded in providing parts lists of the essential components of signaling networks, they typically do not provide much insight into the hierarchical and functional relations that exist among these components. We describe a high-throughput screen in which we used RNA interference to systematically inhibit two genes simultaneously in 17,724 combinations to identify regulators of Drosophila JUN NH 2 -terminal kinase (JNK). Using both genetic and phosphoproteomics data, we then implemented an integrative network algorithm to construct a JNK phosphorylation network, which provides structural and mechanistic insights into the systems architecture of JNK signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2029388016,"Background Intestinal ischemia-reperfusion (IR) is a phenomenon related to physiological conditions (e.g. exercise, stress) and to pathophysiological events (e.g. acute mesenteric ischemia, aortic surgery). Although intestinal IR has been studied extensively in animals, results remain inconclusive and data on human intestinal IR are scarce. Therefore, an experimental harmless model for human intestinal IR was developed, enabling us to clarify the sequelae of human intestinal IR for the first time. Methods and Findings In 30 patients undergoing pancreatico-duodenectomy we took advantage of the fact that in this procedure a variable length of jejunum is removed. Isolated jejunum (5 cm) was subjected to 30 minutes ischemia followed by reperfusion. Intestinal Fatty Acid Binding Protein (I-FABP) arteriovenous concentration differences across the bowel segment were measured before and after ischemia to assess epithelial cell damage. Tissue sections were collected after ischemia and at 25, 60 and 120 minutes reperfusion and stained with H&E, and for I-FABP and the apoptosis marker M30. Bonferroni's test was used to compare I-FABP differences. Mean (SEM) arteriovenous concentration gradients of I-FABP across the jejunum revealed rapidly developing epithelial cell damage. I-FABP release significantly increased from 290 (46) pg/ml before ischemia towards 3,997 (554) pg/ml immediately after ischemia (p<0.001) and declined gradually to 1,143 (237) pg/ml within 1 hour reperfusion (p<0.001). Directly after ischemia the intestinal epithelial lining was microscopically normal, while subepithelial spaces appeared at the villus tip. However, after 25 minutes reperfusion, enterocyte M30 immunostaining was observed at the villus tip accompanied by shedding of mature enterocytes into the lumen and loss of I-FABP staining. Interestingly, within 60 minutes reperfusion the epithelial barrier resealed, while debris of apoptotic, shedded epithelial cells was observed in the lumen. At the same time, M30 immunoreactivity was absent in intact epithelial lining. Conclusions This is the first human study to clarify intestinal IR induced cell damage and repair and its direct consequences. It reveals a unique, endogenous clearing mechanism for injured enterocytes: rapid detachment of damaged apoptotic enterocytes into the lumen. This process is followed by repair of the epithelial continuity within an hour, resulting in a normal epithelial lining."

The Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope has unveiled a radio quiet pulsar located near the center of the compact synchrotron nebula inside the supernova remnant CTA 1. The pulsar, discovered through its gamma-ray pulsations, has a period of 316.86 milliseconds and a period derivative of 3.614 Ã 10 â13 seconds per second. Its characteristic age of 10 4 years is comparable to that estimated for the SNR. We speculate that most unidentified Galactic gamma-ray sources associated with star-forming regions and SNRs are such young pulsars."
https://openalex.org/W2085159680,"End-stage renal disease rates rose following widespread introduction of high fructose corn syrup in the American diet, supporting speculation that fructose harms the kidney. Sugar-sweetened soda is a primary source of fructose. We therefore hypothesized that sugary soda consumption was associated with albuminuria, a sensitive marker for kidney disease.Design was a cross-sectional analysis. Data were drawn from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 1999-2004. The setting was a representative United States population sample. Participants included adults 20 years and older with no history of diabetes mellitus (n = 12,601); after exclusions for missing outcome and covariate information (n = 3,243), the analysis dataset consisted of 9,358 subjects. Exposure was consumption of two or more sugary soft drinks, based on 24-hour dietary recall. The main outcome measure was Albuminuria, defined by albumin to creatinine ratio cutpoints of >17 mg/g (males) and >25 mg/g (females). Logistic regression adjusted for confounders (diet soda, age, race-ethnicity, gender, poverty). Interactions between age, race-ethnicity, gender, and overweight-obesity were explored. Further analysis adjusted for potential mediators: energy intake, basal metabolic rate, obesity, hypertension, lipids, serum uric acid, smoking, energy expenditure, and glycohemoglobin. Alternative soda intake definitions and cola consumption were employed.Weighted albuminuria prevalence was 11%, and 17% consumed 2+ sugary soft drinks/day. The confounder-adjusted odds ratio for sugary soda was 1.40 (95% confidence interval: 1.13, 1.74). Associations were modified by gender (p = 0.008) and overweight-obesity (p = 0.014). Among women, the OR was 1.86 (95% CI: 1.37, 2.53); the OR among males was not significant. In the group with body mass under 25 kg/m(2), OR = 2.15 (95% confidence interval: 1.42, 3.25). Adjustment for potential mediators and use of alternative definitions of albuminuria and soda consumption did not appreciably change results. Diet sodas were not associated with albuminuria.Findings suggest that sugary soda consumption may be associated with kidney damage, although moderate consumption of 1 or fewer sodas does not appear to be harmful. Additional studies are needed to assess whether HFCS itself, overall excess intake of sugar, or unmeasured lifestyle and confounding factors are responsible."
https://openalex.org/W2107422001,"The altered expression of cell surface chondroitin sulfate (CS) and dermatan sulfate (DS) in cancer cells has been demonstrated to play a key role in malignant transformation and tumor metastasis. However, the functional highly sulfated structures in CS/DS chains and their involvement in the process have not been well documented. In the present study, a structural analysis of CS/DS from two mouse Lewis lung carcinoma (3LL)-derived cell lines with different metastatic potentials revealed a higher proportion of Δ4,5HexUA-GalNAc(4,6-O-disulfate) generated from E-units (GlcUA-GalNAc(4, 6-O-disulfate)) in highly metastatic LM66-H11 cells than in low metastatic P29 cells, although much less CS/DS is expressed by LM66-H11 than P29 cells. This key finding prompted us to study the role of CS-E-like structures in experimental lung metastasis. The metastasis of LM66-H11 cells to lungs was effectively inhibited by enzymatic removal of tumor cell surface CS or by preadministration of CS-E rich in E-units in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, immunocytochemical analysis showed that LM66-H11 rather than P29 cells expressed more strongly the CS-E epitope, which was specifically recognized by the phage display antibody GD3G7. More importantly, this antibody and a CS-E decasaccharide fraction, the minimal structure recognized by GD3G7, strongly inhibited the metastasis of LM66-H11 cells probably by modifying the proliferative and invading behavior of the metastatic tumor cells. These results suggest that the E-unit-containing epitopes are involved in the metastatic process and a potential target for the diagnosis and treatment of malignant tumors.

These results suggest that the E-unit-containing epitopes are involved in the metastatic process and a potential target for the diagnosis and treatment of malignant tumors. The poor prognosis of cancer is mainly due to the metastasis of malignant cells from the primary neoplasm. Metastasis is a selective process involving invasion, embolization, survival in the circulation, arrest in distant capillary beds, and extravasation into and multiplication within the target organ parenchyma (1Eccles S.A.

In the process of metastasis, tumor cells are involved in a series of interactions with surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM) 5The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; PG, proteoglycan; DS, dermatan sulfate; CS, chondroitin sulfate; GAG, glycosaminoglycan; CSase, chondroitinase; 2AB, 2-aminobenzamide; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; GlcUA, d-glucuronic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HexUA, hexuronic acid; Δ4,5HexUA, 4,5-unsaturated hexuronic acid; E-unit, GlcUA;1-3GalNAc(4S,6S); 2S, 2-O-sulfate; 4S, 4-O-sulfate; 6S, 6-O-sulfate. 5The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; PG, proteoglycan; DS, dermatan sulfate; CS, chondroitin sulfate; GAG, glycosaminoglycan; CSase, chondroitinase; 2AB, 2-aminobenzamide; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; GlcUA, d-glucuronic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HexUA, hexuronic acid; Δ4,5HexUA, 4,5-unsaturated hexuronic acid; E-unit, GlcUA;1-3GalNAc(4S,6S); 2S, 2-O-sulfate; 4S, 4-O-sulfate; 6S, 6-O-sulfate. components and nontumor cells such as platelets and endothelial cells. Proteoglycans (PGs), which bear heparan sulfate (HS) or chondroitin sulfate (CS)/dermatan sulfate (DS) side chains and are widely expressed on the cell surface and in the ECM, are important in modulating these interactions (3Tímár J.

In addition to HS-PGs, CS/DS-PGs have also been implicated in normal biological processes such as neuronal development, morphogenesis, growth factor binding, and cell signaling (9Sugahara K.

Human melanoma CS/DS-PG and its homologue NG2 in rats are involved in matrix adhesion, migration, and invasion, a role that is abolished by treatment with antibodies against CS/DS-PG (11Lynch S.A.

Moreover, CD44-related CS/DS-PG on the cell surface is essential in the invasion/migration of normal endothelial and melanoma cells (14Henke C.A. Roongta U. Mickelson D.J. Knutson J.R. McCarthy J.B.

The interaction between CS/DS-PG and membrane type 3 matrix metalloproteinase is important for the invasion of melanoma cells (16Iida J. Pei D. Kang T. Simpson M.A. Herlyn M. Furcht L.T. McCarthy J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18786-18794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In addition, treatment with chondroitinase (CSase) AC (specifically cleaving CS) or CSase B (specifically cleaving DS) significantly inhibited the proliferation and invasion of melanoma cells (17Denholm E.M. Lin Y.Q. Silver P.J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 416: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Most recently, cell surface CS/DS was shown to participate in basic fibroblast growth factor-induced proliferation of human metastatic melanoma cell lines (18Nikitovic D. Assouti M. Sifaki M. Katonis P. Krasagakis K. Karamanos N.K. Tzanakakis G.N. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2008; 40: 72-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), the membrane type 3 matrix metalloproteinase-mediated activation of promatrix metalloproteinase-2 (19Iida J. Wilhelmson K.L.

Artaud C. Shaaf S. Kieber-Emmons T. Int. J. Cancer. 2007; 120: 1179-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These studies point to the fact that CS/DS side chains play crucial roles through binding to various ligands, although the core protein also has ligand binding capabilities (21Svee K. White J. Vaillant P. Jessurun J. Roongta U. Krumwiede M. Johnson D. Henke C. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 98: 1713-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). CS chains are composed of repeating disaccharide units of GlcUA-GalNAc, where GlcUA and GalNAc represent d-glucuronic acid and N-acetyl-d-galactosamine, respectively, whereas DS is a stereoisomer of CS chains formed from precursor CS chains through the action of glucuronyl C5 epimerase (22Silbert J.E. Sugumaran G. IUBMB Life. 2002; 54: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 23Maccarana M. Olander B. Malmstróm J. Tiedemann K. Aebersold R. Lindahl U. Li J-P. Malmstróm A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 11560-11568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). CS and DS chains are often found as co-polymeric structures (CS/DS) that tend to exhibit a periodic distribution of GlcUA-containing disaccharide repeats and l-iduronic acid-containing disaccharide repeats in a cell/tissue-specific manner (9Sugahara K. Mikami T. Uyama T. Mizuguchi S. Nomura K. Kitagawa H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 612-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 24Cheng F. Heinegárd D. Malmstróm A. Schmidtchen A. Yoshida K. Fransson L.-Á. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 685-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). CS/DS chains are further modified by the differential sulfation pattern of specific sulfotransferases at C-2 of GlcUA/l-iduronic acid and/or C-4 and/or C-6 of GalNAc to yield enormous structural diversity (25Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellen L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Hence, functional structures of CS/DS chains may be generated in tumor cells because of the differential expression of the individual modification enzymes during tumor progression, which may have a direct/indirect link with metastatic potential. Thus, identification of these altered functional structures would be a significant step in understanding the mechanism of involvement of CS/DS-PGs in metastasis and enable us to address the diagnosis and treatment of malignant tumors. Highly sulfated disaccharide units like E-unit, GlcUA;1-3GalNAc(4S,6S) (26Sugahara K. Yamada S. Trends Glycosci. Glycotechnol. 2000; 12: 321-349Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar), where 4S and 6S stand for 4-O- and 6-O-sulfate, respectively, are rare, and E-unit-rich CS preparations show remarkable biological activities like the promotion of neurite outgrowth and high affinity binding to growth factors (9Sugahara K.

Increasing evidence suggests that the expression pattern of cell surface CS/DS-PGs is related to metastatic potential (3Tímár J. Lapis K. Dudás J. Sebestyén A. Kopper L. Kovalszky I. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2002; 12: 173-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 12Pluschke G. Vanek M. Evans A. Dittmar T. Schmid P. Itin P. Filardo E.J. Reisfeld R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A Platinum® SYBR® Green qPCR Supermix-UDG kit was purchased from Invitrogen. Animals and Cell Lines—Six-week-old male C57BL/6 mice and 9-week-old female C3H/HeN mice were obtained from Japan SLC (Hamamatsu, Japan) and kept in standard housing. All of the experiments were performed under the experimental protocol approved by the local animal care committee of Hokkaido University. The low metastatic P29 and high metastatic LM66-H11 cells cloned from a murine Lewis lung carcinoma 3LL were prepared as reported (31Itano N. Oguri K. Nakanishi H. Okayama M. J. Biochem.

The cells were harvested after incubation with 2 mm EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline (EDTA/PBS) for 10 min at 37 °C by gentle flushing with a pipette and subcultured twice a week. Extraction of GAGs from P29 and LM66-H11 Cells—The cells were dehydrated and delipidated by extraction with acetone, air-dried, and used for extraction of GAGs essentially as described previously (32Li F.

Following incubation, each sample was treated with 5% trichloroacetic acid, and the resultant precipitate was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was extracted with ether to remove trichloroacetic acid. After neutralization with 1.0 m sodium carbonate, the aqueous phase was adjusted to contain 80% ethanol and 1% sodium acetate and kept at 4 °C overnight.

In a control experiment, GD3G7 was preincubated with CS-E (5 or 10 ;g) at 4 °C for 30 min to demonstrate the specificity of GD3G7 toward CS-E. After being incubated with anti-vesicular stomatitis virus antibody (diluted 1:5,000 in 0.1% bovine serum albumin/PBS) for 1 h at room temperature, the cells were washed with PBS containing 0.5% Tween 20. To detect the anti-vesicular stomatitis virus antibodies, the cells were stained with the Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated third antibody (diluted 1:500 in 0.1% bovine serum albumin/PBS) and visualized with a laser-scanning confocal microscope, FLUOVIEW (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). To evaluate the specificity of the antibody, the cells were treated with CSase ABC in the presence of a protease inhibitor mixture (Nacalai Tesque, Inc., Kyoto, Japan) and then processed for immunostaining as described above. Assays for Lung Metastasis—To prepare LM66-H11 cells for injection, the cells were harvested by brief exposure to EDTA/PBS, and the cell viability in single-cell suspensions was determined by trypan blue exclusion. A total of 4 × 105 cells (>90% viability) suspended in 200 ;l of DMEM were injected into a lateral tail vein of C57BL/6 or C3H/HeN mice. Although the cell lines LM66-H11 and P29 were established from the C57BL/6 mouse, the C3H/HeN mouse strain was also used for metastasis experiments because of the better handling advantage, and the results obtained were similar to those obtained with a syngeneic C57BL/6 mouse. After 3 weeks, the animals were sacrificed, and the number of visible tumor cell parietal nodules in the lung was counted by two observers in a blinded fashion. The inoculation procedure described above was used for the subsequent experiments. To investigate the involvement of cell surface CS/DS in metastasis, LM66-H11 cells were pretreated with either DMEM (control) or DMEM containing protease-free CSase ABC (20 mIU/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C before being injected into C3H/HeN mice. In a separate series of experiments, C57BL/6 or C3H/HeN mice received the indicated amount (100 ;g/mouse) of commercial CS/DS preparations (CS-A, CS-B, CS-C, CS-D, and CS-E) or heparin 30 min before the tumor cell injection. CS-E digested with CSase ABC was also used as a control. For dose-dependent inhibition experiments and for inhibition experiments using size-defined CS-E oligosaccharides, various doses of CS-E (10, 50, 100, 200, and 300 ;g/mouse), and hexa-, octa-, deca-, or dodecasaccharides (25 ;g/mouse) were administered into C3H/HeN mice 30 min before the tumor cell injection. In other instances, to investigate the involvement of the antibody GD3G7 epitope in metastasis, LM66-H11 cells were preincubated with 200 ;l of serially diluted GD3G7 (0.5, 0.25, and 0.125 ;g/ml) or the irrelevant antibody MPB49V (0.5 ;g/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C and used for metastasis experiments in both C57BL/6 and C3H/HeN mice. Aliquots of the cell suspension were assessed for cell viability before the injection. Dynamic Monitoring of LM66-H11 Cell Proliferation Using the RT-CES™ System—The cell proliferation assay was done using the RT-CES™ system (ACEA Biosciences, San Diego, CA). Briefly, ACEA 96X microtiter plates (e-plate™) were coated with laminin (25 ;g/ml) at 37 °C for 30 min, and LM66-H11 cells (2 × 104/well) were seeded in 100 ;l of medium. In the first experiment, cell attachment was monitored up to 20 min, at which point various inhibitors, CS-A (100 ;g/ml), CS-E (100 ;g/ml), or GD3G7 (2 ;g/ml) in 150 ;l of DMEM were individually added. The spreading of the cells was continuously monitored up to 60 min using the RT-CES™ system. In other instances, ∼24 h after seeding, when the cells were in a log growth phase, serially diluted GD3G7 (2, 0.5, and 0.2 ;g/ml) in 150 ;l of DMEM was added into the corresponding wells. The proliferation was monitored for a period of 64 h and expressed as a cell index as per the manufacturer's instructions. The cell index is a quantitative measure of the spreading and/or proliferative status of the cells in an electrode-containing well. Cell Migration and Invasion Assays in Vitro—The ability of LM66-H11 and P29 cells to migrate and invade was assessed using the BD BioCoat™ chamber with or without Matrigel (BD Biosciences) in vitro. In some instances, single cell suspensions of LM66-H11 (5 × 104 cells/ml) were prepared by detaching and resuspending in serum-free DMEM. Before being added to the upper chamber (8 ;m PET pores), LM66-H11cells were preincubated with CS-A (100 ;g/ml), CS-E (100 ;g/ml), or GD3G7 (2 ;g/ml) in 500 ;l DMEM for 30 min at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. The lower chambers were filled with DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. After incubation for 24 h, the cells that had migrated and invaded through the membrane alone or the Matrigel-coated membrane remained bound to the underside of the membranes. These cells were stained with the Diff-Quik staining kit and counted in five random microscopic fields/filter. Biodistribution of Intravenously Injected Radiolabeled CS-E—3H-Labeled CS-E (4 × 105 cpm) was prepared as described previously (27Deepa S.S. Umehara Y. Higashiyama S. Itoh N. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43707-43716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) and injected into C3H/HeN mice through a lateral tail vein. At 1, 1.5, and 2.5 h post-injection, the blood samples were collected from anesthetized animals via cardiac puncture. The animals were then sacrificed, and the organs including liver, lungs, kidneys, spleen, and brain were dissected out, quickly rinsed, and weighed. The blood and each tissue from all the animals were pooled and homogenized with 1% Triton X-100/PBS in a Polytron homogenizer while being cooled on ice. Aliquots of the tissue homogenates and the plasma were freeze-thawed (five times) using liquid nitrogen bath and treated with 5% trichloroacetic acid. The resultant supernatants were recovered by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 10 min, and the radioactivity was measured using a multi-purpose liquid scintillation counter (Beckman coulter LS6500). The counts were converted to disintegrations on the basis of a standard quench correction curve, and the distribution of 3H-CS-E in the plasma and tissues was expressed as dpm/ml and dpm/g, respectively. Relative Quantification of Gene Expression of Sulfotransferases and Epimerase—Total RNA was extracted from P29 and LM66-H11 cells in 100-mm culture plates using a QuickPrep total RNA extraction kit according to the manufacturer's instructions, and then each extract was treated with RNase-free DNase for 30 min at 37 °C. The cDNA was synthesized from ∼1 ;g of the total RNA using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and an oligo(dT)16 primer (Hokkaido System Science, Sapporo, Japan) and then purified with a MinElute® PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Quantitative real time reverse transcription-PCR was performed using a Platinum® SYBR® Green qPCR Supermix-UDG kit in the iCyclear iQ™ (Bio-Rad). Briefly, the reaction mixture (25 ;l) contained a SYBR Green Supermix, each primer set at 0.2 ;m (as shown in Table 2), and each template cDNA. PCR was carried out for 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min, and the amplified products were measured by the iCycler iQ real time PCR analyzing system (Bio-Rad). The expression level of each sulfotransferase and epimerase mRNA was normalized to that of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase transcript.TABLE 2Primers utilized for quantitative reverse transcription-PCRGeneSizeSequencebpGalNAc4S-6ST153Forward5′-TATGACAACAGCACAGACGG-3′Reverse5′-TGCAGATTTATTGGAACTTGCGAA-3′UST151Forward5′-TGACCATGGACCACCTCCTA-3′Reverse5′-GTGAATGTCTGATGTGACCAAA-3′C4ST-1141Forward5′-ACCTCGTGGGCAAGTATGAG-3′Reverse5′-TCTGGAAGAACTCCGTGGTC-3′C4ST-2102Forward5′-GCACAAGGCTGAAGTGAAGG-3′Reverse5′-CATGAGAGCCGACCCTAGTA-3′D4ST-1175Forward5′-GCGTCCTGAACAACGTG-3′Reverse5′-TCTCCAAACTTGTTACGGTAAGC-3′C5E139Forward5′-AGCGCTGGTGCACGCTACAC-3′Reverse5′-GCAGGTAGTGCACTTCCATAAG-3′G3PDH205Forward5′-CATCTGAGGGCCCACTG-3′Reverse5′-GAGGCCATGTAGGCCATGA-3′ Open table in a new tab Comparison of Amount and Composition of CS/DS between P29 and LM66-H11 Cells—To investigate the possible alteration in the expression of CS/DS in the carcinoma clones with different metastatic potentials, GAGs were extracted from P29 and LM66-H11 cells, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the amount and composition of CS/DS in both GAG preparations were determined by digestion with CSase ABC followed by anion exchange HPLC."

RA induced Rac1-GTP formation and phosphorylation of its downstream target, p21-activated kinase (PAK), whereas the inhibition of AMPK blocked RA-induced Rac1 activation. Moreover, cofilin, an actin polymerization regulator, was activated when incubated with RA. We then showed that inhibition of AMPK by compound C, a selective inhibitor of AMPK, or small interfering RNA of AMPK α1 blocked RA-induced cofilin phosphorylation. Additionally, we found that retinoic acid-stimulated glucose uptake in differentiated C2C12 myoblast cells and activated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Finally, the inhibition of AMPK and p38 MAPK blocked retinoic acid-induced glucose uptake. In summary, our results suggest that retinoic acid may have cytoskeletal roles in skeletal muscle cells via stimulation of the AMPK-Rac1-PAK-cofillin pathway and may also have beneficial roles in glucose metabolism via stimulation of the AMPK-p38 MAPK pathway.

Retinoids are important regulators of differentiation and cell proliferation. Induction of differentiation by retinoic acid has been observed in various cell systems, such as endothelial, neuronal, and lung cancers (1Hong W.K. Benner S.E. Lippman S.M. Leukemia. 1994; 8: S33-S37PubMed Google Scholar). Retinoic acid has been shown to inhibit the growth of breast cancer cells and to reduce the number of tumors in animal models (2Fitzgerald P. Teng M.

Fontana J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21440-21447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The anti-tumor potential of retinoids has been demonstrated by their ability to inhibit the growth of several human cancers, including colon cancer, prostate cancer, and melanoma (4O'Dwyer P.J.

Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1491-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Retinoic acid mediates its effects by binding to its receptors, retinoid acid receptor, or retinoid X receptor, followed by heterodimerization of the receptors and their recognition of binding to retinoid acid receptor element-containing promoters. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) 2The abbreviations used are: AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; AICAR, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxy-amide-1-d-ribofuranoside; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PAK, p21-activated kinase; siRNA, small interfering RNA; PBD, p21-binding domain. is a phylogenetically conserved intracellular energy sensor that plays a central role in the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism. AMPK, a heterotrimeric complex comprised of a catalytic subunit and two regulatory subunits, is activated when cellular energy is depleted (6Hardie D.G. Carling D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 259-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). Upon activation by allosteric binding of AMP or phosphorylation at Thr172 of the catalytic subunit by AMPK kinase, AMPK accelerates ATP-generating catabolic pathways, including glucose and fatty acid oxidation (7Makinde A.O. Gamble J. Lopaschuk G.D. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 482-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 8Ai H. Ihlemann J. Hellsten Y. Lauritzen H.P. Hardie D.G. Galbo H. Ploug T. Am. J.

Vincent M.F. Gruber H.E. Van den Berghe G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 541-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). In addition to its roles in energy homeostasis, AMPK also has been shown to regulate the endothelial nitric-oxide synthase pathway through Rac1 (11Levine Y.C. Li G.K. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20351-20364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The involvement of interaction of Rac1 with AMPK has been implicated in many of the biological effects of AMPK in cytoskeletal remodeling. Small GTPases of the Rho family have diverse effects on cellular structure and function. Depending on the cell type, specific Rho GTPases induce particular surface protrusions generated by actin-remodeling reactions that change cell shapes and influence cell adhesion and locomotion (12Nobes C.D. Hall A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 456-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 13Gauthier-Rouviere C. Vignal E. Meriane M. Roux P. Montcourier P. Fort P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1379-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Filopodia and lamellipodia are formed by the polymerization and extension of actin filaments toward the cell membrane. This polymerization at the barbed end of the filament is balanced by depolymerization at the pointed end, recycling the actin in a “treadmilling” process (14Chen J. Godt D. Gunsalus K. Kiss I. Goldberg M. Laski F.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 204-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The dynamic reorganization of actin in the cytoskeleton drives processes that include changes in cell morphology, cell migration, and phagocytosis (15Cowieson N.P. King G. Cookson D. Ross I. Huber T.

Cellular actin dynamics are regulated by complex mechanisms involving several actin-binding proteins in a spatially and temporally regulated and tissue-specific manner. The central machinery of rapid actin turnover requires actin nucleation, filament disassembly, and capping barbed ends to limit the number of elongation sites (16Cooper J.A. Schafer D.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 17Carlier M.F. Le Clainche C. Wiesner S. Pantaloni D.

In this study, we investigated the effects of retinoic acid on AMPK and glucose uptake in skeletal muscle cells to gain an understanding of its cytoskeletal and metabolic roles. We found that retinoic acid activates the AMPK-Rac1-cofilin pathway in muscle cells, and further demonstrated that the activities of AMPK and p38 MAPK are involved in retinoic acid-induced glucose uptake. These findings provide novel insights into the manner in which retinoic acid contributes to the cytoskeletal and metabolic functions in skeletal muscle cells. Reagents—Anti-Phospho-ACC (Ser79), anti-phospho-AMPK (Thr172), anti-phospho-p38 MAPK, anti-phospho-PAK, anti-phospho-cofilin, anti-AMPK, anti-p38 MAPK, and anti-cofilin and anti-PAK antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from Kirkegaard and Perry Lab (Gaithersburg, MD). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase antibodies were purchased from Sigma. Retinoic acid, NSC23766 (Rac inhibitor), SB 203580 (p38 MAPK inhibitor), insulin, compound C, and AICAR (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxy-amide-1-d-ribofuranoside) were obtained from Calbiochem. Cell Culture—Mouse myoblast C2C12 cell were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics at 37 °C in an incubator with 5% CO2. Cells were grown in culture medium consisting of 500 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen GIBCO), containing 0.584 g/liter of l-glutamate and 4.5 g/liter of glucose, mixed with 500 ml of F-12 medium containing 0.146 g/liter of l-glutamate, 1.8 g/liter of glucose, 100 μg/ml of gentamicin, 2.5 g/liter of sodium carbonate, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Immunoblot Analysis—Cells were grown on 24-well plates and serum-starved for 36 h prior to treatment with the indicated agents. Following treatment of cells, the media was aspirated and the cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 100 μl of lysis buffer. The samples were then briefly sonicated, heated for 5 min at 95 °C, and centrifuged for 5 min. The supernatants were electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE (8%) gels, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The blots were incubated overnight at room temperature with primary antibodies and then washed six times in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 prior to 1 h of incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies at room temperature. The blots were then visualized via ECL. In some cases, the blots were stripped and reprobed using other antibodies. Silencing AMPKα1—Mouse myoblast C2C12 cells were seeded in 6-well plates and allowed to grow to 70% confluence for 24 h. Transient transfections were performed with transfection reagent (Lipofectamine 2000; Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, both AMPKα1 (Dharmacon; NM_001013367) and non-targeted control siRNAs were designed. 5 μl of siRNA and 5 μl of transfection reagent (Lipofectamine 2000) were each diluted first with 95 μl of reduced serum media (Opti-MEM; Invitrogen) and then mixed. The mixtures were allowed to incubate for 30 min at room temperature and then were added by drop to each culture well containing 800 μl of reduced serum media (Opti-MEM; final siRNA concentration, 100 nm). Four hours after transfection, the medium was changed with fresh complete medium. Cells were cultivated for 24 h and were lysed, and the expression of AMPKα1 protein was assayed with Western blotting. GTP-Rac Assay—The p21-binding domain (PBD) of PAK fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST) was expressed from pGEX-PBD. Recombinant glutathione S-transferase-PBD was purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. Immediately after treatment, cells were lysed in lysis buffer, and 800 μl of total lysate was incubated with glutathione S-transferase-PBD beads at 4 °C for 4 h. Beads were collected by centrifugation and were washed three times with washing buffer (25 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.6), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 30 mm MgCl2, 40 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40). Proteins were eluted by boiling beads in 2× sample buffer for 5 min, separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and blotted with antibody to Rac1. 2-Deoxyglucose Uptake—The uptake of 2-deoxyglucose by mouse myoblast C2C12 cells was evaluated. In brief, cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 20 mm HEPES with a pH 7.4, and then incubated with the test compounds in the same buffer at 37 °C. The transport assay was initiated via the addition of 2-[U-14C]deoxy-d-glucose (25 mm; 10 mCi/ml) to each of the wells, for 10 min at 37 °C. The assay was terminated by the addition and subsequent washing of the cells with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were lysed in 10% SDS or 50 mm NaOH. Radioactivity was evaluated via scintillation counting of the lysates extracted in SDS, whereas total protein contents were determined in lysates extracted in NaOH via the Bradford procedure (Bio-Rad). The glucose uptake values were corrected for non-carrier-mediated transport by measuring glucose uptake in the presence of 10 mm cytochalasin B. Data Analysis—Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical analyses were conducted using SigmaStat (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). p values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Retinoic Acid Activates AMPK-ACC Pathways in Mouse Myoblast C2C12 Cells—To characterize the molecular mechanisms of retinoic acid, we evaluated its effects on the activity of AMPK, a key metabolic sensor kinase. The administration of retinoic acid induced a time-dependent increase in AMPK phosphorylation in C2C12 cells (Fig. 1A). The phosphorylation level of Thr172, which is in the active site of AMPK-α subunit and is essential for enzyme activity, reached a maximum level at 10 min after treatment and then decreased to basal levels at 1 h. Consistent with the increase in AMPK activity, the phosphorylation of ACC-Ser79, the best characterized phosphorylation site by AMPK, increased after retinoic acid administration. In addition, retinoic acid stimulated AMPK activation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). AICAR, a known AMPK activator, was employed as a positive control. These results demonstrate that retinoic acid has AMPK stimulatory roles in skeletal muscle cells. Retinoic Acid Activates Rac1—Rac1 is a serine/threonine protein kinase that leads to a translocation of the glucose transporter (GLUT4) to the plasma membrane via activation of signaling cascades (20Ishikura S. Koshkina A. Klip A. Acta Physiol. (Oxf.). 2008; 192: 61-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In an effort to understand the signal pathways involved in retinoic acid-mediated cytoskeletal rearrangement, we investigated the effects of either retinoic acid or AICAR on Rac1. Both retinoic acid and AICAR were observed to activate Rac1 in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). To determine whether AMPK activity is involved in the effect of retinoic acid, we investigated Rac1 activation following treatment with compound C, an AMPK inhibitor. The retinoic acid-mediated activation of Rac1 was inhibited in cells pretreated with compound C (Fig. 2B). Together, these results indicate that Rac1 operates in the retinoic acid-mediated signaling pathway in an AMPK-dependent manner. PAK Is Involved in Retinoic Acid-mediated Signaling—To corroborate the roles of retinoic acid in the Rac1-mediated signaling pathway, we assessed the effects of AMPK on molecules downstream of Rac1. To this end, C2C12 cells were treated with AICAR before measuring phosphorylation of PAK. AICAR increased PAK phosphorylation (Fig. 3A), indicating that AMPK may be involved in Rac1-mediated signaling. Furthermore, PAK phosphorylation was clearly observed in cells treated with retinoic acid (Fig. 3B). Together, our findings indicate that retinoic acid increases PAK-mediated signaling by acting on AMPK. Cofilin Is Activated by a Retinoic Acid-mediated Pathway—To verify the roles of retinoic acid in the PAK-mediated signaling pathway, we assessed the effects of retinoic acid on cofilin activation. The phosphorylation of cofilin was increased in C2C12 cells that had been incubated with retinoic acid in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Figs. 4, A and B). Furthermore, the retinoic acid-mediated phosphorylation of cofilin and PAK was clearly suppressed in cells pretreated with either Rac1 inhibitor or AMPK inhibitor (Fig. 4, C and D). Next, to better understand the signaling mechanisms of AMPK regulation on the retinoic acid-induced pathway, we tested whether AMPK regulates retinoic acid-induced phosphorylation of Rac1 downstream molecules. Knockdown of AMPKα1 by siRNA transfection significantly reduced retinoic acid-induced phosphorylation of cofilin and PAK (Fig. 4E). This result suggests that AMPK mediates retinoic acid-induced Rac1 activation. Retinoic Acid Stimulates Glucose Uptake in Differentiated Mouse Myoblast C2C12 Cells—To determine the role of retinoic acid in glucose metabolism, we examined the dose-dependent effects of retinoic acid on glucose uptake in differentiated myoblast C2C12 cells. We observed that retinoic acid initiated an increase in 2-deoxyglucose uptake in differentiated C2C12 myoblast cells when used at a concentration of 1 μm, with a maximal increase occurring at 10 μm (Fig. 5). Retinoic acid did not influence the viability of C2C12 cells at 10 μm as assessed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide staining (data not shown). Insulin, used at 100 nm, caused an increase in glucose uptake, and was utilized as a positive control. The effects of 10 μm retinoic acid on 2-deoxyglucose uptake were comparable with those of insulin, suggesting that retinoic acid may have metabolic roles in skeletal muscle cells. Taken together, our results indicate that retinoic acid can act in the metabolic pathways in skeletal muscle cells. Retinoic Acid Activates the p38 MAPK Pathway—In an effort to understand the signaling pathways involved in retinoic acid-mediated glucose uptake, we investigated the effects of retinoic acid on p38 MAPK. Retinoic acid was observed to activate p38 MAPK in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 6A). The phosphorylation of p38 MAPK reached a maximum level at 30 min and then returned to basal level at 60 min. To determine whether AMPK activity was involved in this effect of retinoic acid, we investigated p38 MAPK activation following AMPK inhibition by compound C. The retinoic acid-mediated activation of p38 MAPK was inhibited in cells pretreated with 10 μm compound C (Fig. 6B). Together, these results indicate that p38 MAPK operates in the retinoic acid-mediated signaling pathway in an AMPK-dependent manner. To corroborate the roles of p38 MAPK and AMPK in the retinoic acid-mediated signaling pathway, we assessed the effects of inhibitors of these kinases on glucose uptake. C2C12 cells were pretreated with either SB203580, a p38 MAPK inhibitor, or compound C in the presence of retinoic acid. The effect of retinoic acid on glucose uptake was attenuated in C2C12 cells that had been incubated with these inhibitors (Fig. 6C), indicating that both of these pathways are involved in retinoic acid-induced glucose uptake. Finally, to address to role of p38 MAPK, we examined the effect of insulin on p38 MAPK. The phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was increased in a time- and dose-dependent manner upon insulin treatment (Fig. 6D). Together, our findings show that retinoic acid stimulates glucose uptake via activation of p38 MAPK. The principal finding of this study was that retinoic acid is involved in cytoskeletal rearrangement and metabolic function in skeletal muscle cells. Specifically, we demonstrated that AMPK is instrumental in retinoic acid-mediated signaling in these cells. The primary assertion of this study is that AMPK mediates some of the metabolic and cytoskeletal effects of retinoic acid. The role of retinoic acid has previously been evaluated in conjunction with differentiation (1Hong W.K. Benner S.E. Lippman S.M. Leukemia. 1994; 8: S33-S37PubMed Google Scholar) and anti-tumor functions (2Fitzgerald P. Teng M. Chandraratna R.A. Heyman R.A. Allegretto E.A.

The cytoskeleton-altering properties of retinoic acid appear to be responsible for its role in differentiation, and may also contribute to its observed anti-tumor effects. The contribution of retinoic acid to differentiation has raised questions as to which of the activities of retinoic acid may be relevant to its cytoskeletal role. The mechanisms of retinoic acid-induced cytoskeletal changes have previously been suggested (21Oreffo R.O. Teti A. Triffitt J.T. Francis M.J. Carano A. Zallone A.Z. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1988; 3: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 22Menard C. Pupier S. Mornet D. Kitzmann M. Nargeot J. Lory P. J. Biol.

In the present study, we have established that retinoic acid induces cytoskeletal rearrangement through the AMPK pathway. Additionally, we demonstrated that retinoic acid activates the uptake of glucose through the AMPK pathway. The relationship of retinoic acid with glucose regulation has been suggested (25Hong S.-E. Ahn I.-S. Jung H.-S. Rayner D.V. Do M.-S. J. Med. Food. 2004; 7: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 26Montessuit C. Papageorgiou I. Lerch R. Endocrinology. 2008; 149: 1064-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Collectively, our results indicate that AMPK may play crucial roles in retinoic acid-mediated cytoskeletal changes and metabolic functions. The objective of the present study was to ascertain whether or not the cytoskeleton of skeletal muscle cells is directly regulated by retinoic acid and, if so, to determine which molecules are involved in this process. Our data have revealed a novel role for Rac1 downstream of AMPK activation by retinoic acid. Our identification of an AMPK-Rac1-PAK-cofilin axis in retinoic acid-treated skeletal muscle cells led us to hypothesize that Rac1 might play a role in the AMPK-mediated modulation of actin cytoskeleton remodeling. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a link between AMPK and Rac1 in skeletal muscle cells. Indeed, it is tempting to speculate that AMPK-mediated regulation of Rac1 plays a role in cellular differentiation, because both retinoic acid and Rac1 have been implicated in differentiation and cytoskeletal rearrangement. In addition to its cytoskeletal roles, we further demonstrated that retinoic acid plays a metabolic role by activating glucose uptake. Overall, although the mechanism by which AMPK influences skeletal muscle cell differentiation remains unknown, the findings in this report suggest that retinoic acid may induce rearrangement of the cytoskeleton through the AMPK pathway as part of the process of retinoic acid-mediated differentiation. Various reports have suggested the importance of calcium signaling in myogenesis (27Delling U. Tureckova J. Lim H.W. De Windt L.J. Rotwein P. Molkentin J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6600-6611Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 28McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Olson E.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 40-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Calcium signaling has the potential to enable activity of MyoD heterodimers with E-protein in myogenesis through calcium/calmodulin inhibition of DNA binding (29Corneliussen B. Holm M. Watersson Y. Onions J. Hallberg B. Thornell A. Grundstrom T. Nature. 1994; 368: 760-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Retinoids mediate a wide spectrum of calcium regulating activities through calcium-binding protein (30Shyu R.Y. Huang S.L. Jiang S.Y. J. Biomed. Sci. 2003; 10: 313-319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), intracellular calcium fluctuation, and store-operated calcium influx (31Varani J. Burmeister B. Perone P. Bleavins M. Johnson K.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 147: 718-727PubMed Google Scholar, 32Zhang W. Meng H. Li Z.H. Shu Z. Ma X. Zhang B.X. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 292: F1054-F1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Because retinoic acid has no capability to induce calcium in the present study, calcium might not play a role in retinoic acid-mediated glucose uptake and Rac1-mediated signaling. In conclusion, we have determined that retinoic acid activates AMPK in skeletal muscle cells and stimulates glucose uptake as well. We further demonstrated that the AMPK pathway exerts a profound influence on retinoic acid-mediated cytoskeletal rearrangement. Future studies should focus on elucidating the relationship of AMPK to glucose uptake within the context of a retinoic acid-mediated cytoskeletal signaling pathway. We are currently investigating this relationship."
https://openalex.org/W2053139101,"In vivo studies have demonstrated that p63 plays complex and pivotal roles in pluristratified squamous epithelial development, but its precise function and the nature of the isoform involved remain controversial. Here, we investigate the role of p63 in epithelial differentiation, using an in vitro ES cell model that mimics the early embryonic steps of epidermal development. We show that the ΔNp63 isoform is activated soon after treatment with BMP-4, a morphogen required to commit differentiating ES cells from a neuroectodermal to an ectodermal cell fate. ΔNp63 gene expression remains high during epithelial development. P63 loss of function drastically prevents ectodermal cells to commit to the K5/K14-positive stratified epithelial pathway while gain of function experiments show that ΔNp63 allows this commitment. Interestingly, other epithelial cell fates are not affected, allowing the production of K5/K18-positive epithelial cells. Therefore, our results demonstrate that ΔNp63 may be dispensable for some epithelial differentiation, but is necessary for the commitment of ES cells into K5/K14-positive squamous stratified epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2163276338,"Ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation is involved in various biological processes, and accumulating evidence suggests that E3 ubiquitin ligases play important roles in cancer development. Smad ubiquitin regulatory factor 1 (Smurf1) and Smurf2 are E3 ubiquitin ligases, which suppress transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) family signaling through degradation of Smads and receptors for TGF-β and bone morphogenetic proteins. In addition, Smurf1 has been reported to promote RhoA ubiquitination and degradation and regulate cell motility, suggesting the involvement of Smurf1 in cancer progression. However, the regulation and biological function of Smurf1 and Smurf2 in cancer development remain to be elucidated. In the present study, we show the post-translational regulation of Smurf1 by Smurf2 and the functional differences between Smurf1 and Smurf2 in the progression of breast cancer cells. Smurf2 interacted with Smurf1 and induced its ubiquitination and degradation, whereas Smurf1 failed to induce degradation of Smurf2. Knockdown of Smurf2 in human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells resulted in increases in the levels of Smurf1 protein, and enhancement of cell migration in vitro and bone metastasis in vivo. Of note, knockdown of Smurf1, but not of Smurf2, enhanced TGF-β signaling in MDA-MB-231 cells, suggesting that increased an protein level of Smurf1 offsets the effect of Smurf2 knockdown on TGF-β signaling. These results indicate that two related E3 ubiquitin ligases, Smurf1 and Smurf2, act in the same direction in TGF-β family signaling but play opposite roles in cell migration.

Ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation plays key roles in various biological processes, including cell cycle progression, signal transduction, transcriptional regulation, receptor down-regulation, and endocytosis (1Hershko A.

Smurf1 was originally identified as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for Smad1 and Smad5, intracellular signaling mediators for BMPs (4Zhu H. Kavsak P. Abdollah S. Wrana J.L. Thomsen G.H. Nature. 1999; 400: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). Smurf2 interacts with Smad1 as well as Smad2, an intracellular signaling molecule for TGF-β, and induces their ubiquitin-mediated degradation (5Lin X. Liang M. Feng X.H. J. Biol.

Cell. 2003; 14: 2809-2817Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Through interaction with Smads and receptors for TGF-β and BMP, Smurf1 and Smurf2 attenuate TGF-β family signaling. However, Smurf2 has also been reported to bind to transcriptional co-repressor SnoN (Ski-related novel protein N) via Smad2 and to degrade SnoN (12Bonni S. Wang H.R. Causing C.G. Kavsak P. Stroschein S.L. Luo K. Wrana J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 587-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Thus, Smurf2 may enhance TGF-β signaling under certain conditions. In addition to TGF-β/BMP signaling, Smurf1 and Smurf2 have other targets. For example, Smurf1 and Smurf2 interact with Runx2, a master regulator of osteoblast differentiation, and mediate its proteasomal degradation in osteoblasts (13Zhao M. Qiao M. Oyajobi B.O. Mundy G.R.

Moreover, Smurf1 induces ubiquitination and turnover of MEKK2 to reduce bone formation in vivo (15Yamashita M. Ying S.X. Zhang G.M. Li C. Cheng S.Y. Deng C.X. Zhang Y.E. Cell. 2005; 121: 101-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence suggests that Smurf1 and Smurf2 play important roles in cancer development. Smurf1 has been reported to promote RhoA ubiquitination and degradation and to regulate cell motility (16Wang H.R. Zhang Y. Ozdamar B. Ogunjimi A.A. Alexandrova E. Thomsen G.H. Wrana J.L.

Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Smurf2 can target RhoA for ubiquitination; however, in contrast to Smurf1, Smurf2 activity toward RhoA is restricted by the intramolecular interaction between the Smurf2 C2 and HECT domains (20Wiesner S.

(22Fukuchi M. Fukai Y. Masuda N. Miyazaki T. Nakajima M. Sohda M. Manda R. Tsukada K. Kato H. Kuwano H. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 7162-7165PubMed Google Scholar) reported that high expression of Smurf2 correlates with poor prognosis in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. On the other hand, up-regulation of Smurf2 has been reported to activate replicative senescence, which occurs through a novel mechanism independent of its ligase activity (23Zhang H. Cohen S.N. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 3028-3040Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Therefore, the roles of Smurf1 and Smurf2 in cancer development remain to be elucidated. In the present study, we show the functional differences between Smurf1 and Smurf2 in the progression of breast cancer cells. Smurf2 interacts physically with Smurf1 and induces its ubiquitination and degradation, whereas Smurf1 fails to induce degradation of Smurf2. Knockdown of Smurf2 in human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells results in increased levels of the Smurf1 protein, leading to enhancement of cell migration in vitro and bone metastasis in vivo. The present findings thus provide evidence of functional interaction of Smurf2 with Smurf1 and of different activities between the two related E3 ligases in the development of cancer. Cell Cultures—MDA-MB-231, a human breast cancer cell line, was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). 293FT was obtained from Invitrogen. MDA-MB-231 cells and 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10! fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. 293FT cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10! fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.1 mm minimum essential medium with non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen), and 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen). Construction of Plasmids, Lentiviral Vector Production, and Infection—Wild-type (WT) and ligase inactive mutants (CA) of Smurf1 and Smurf2 were FLAG, 6Myc, or hemagglutinin epitope-tagged at their N termini and subcloned into pcDNA3 vector or pcDEF3 vector as described previously (24Koinuma D. Shinozaki M. Komuro A. Goto K. Saitoh M. Hanyu A. Ebina M. Nukiwa T. Miyazawa K. Imamura T. Miyazono K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6458-6470Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). 6Myc-Smad2, 6Myc-Smad7, and FLAG-tagged ubiquitin (FLAG-Ub) were described previously (24Koinuma D. Shinozaki M. Komuro A.

Micro-RNA (miRNA) expression vectors were constructed using the BLOCK-It Pol II miR RNAi expression vector kit (Invitrogen) by annealing each oligonucleotide (supplemental Table 1) followed by ligation into the pcDNA6.2-GW/EmGFP-miR vector, which was prelinearized and sequenced. miRNA coding regions were then transferred to the lentiviral vector construct pCSII-CMV-RfA (25Shibuya K. Shirakawa J. Kameyama T. Honda S. Tahara-Hanaoka S. Miyamoto A. Onodera M. Sumida T. Nakauchi H. Miyoshi H. Shibuya A. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1829-1839Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) by the Gateway system (Invitrogen). To produce lentiviruses expressing miR-Smurf1 or miR-Smurf2, 293FT cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) with three plasmids: an miRNA vector construct, a VSV-G and Rev-expressing construct (pCMV-VSVG-RSV-Rev), and a packaging construct (pCAG-HIVgp). The culture supernatants were collected 48 h after transfection, and viral particles were concentrated by centrifugation. For lentiviral infection, 7 × 105 MDA-MB-231 cells/dish in 10-cm culture dishes were infected with lentivirus vectors at 100 plaque-forming units/cell. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) and Oligonucleotides—siRNAs were introduced into cells (26Kisielow M. Kleiner S. Nagasawa M. Faisal A. Nagamine Y. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) using the Lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions with 30 pmol of siRNA and 5 μl of transfection reagent per well of a 6-well plate for MDA-MB-231 cells. Expression vectors were co-transfected with siRNAs. The siRNA duplex corresponding to human Smurf1 (5′-GCCAGAUAAUGAAGAUGCGACCGAA-3′) was purchased from Invitrogen. Stealth control siRNA (Invitrogen, Stealth™ RNAi Negative Control Low GC Duplex) was used as a control. Annealing was performed as described previously (27Elbashir S.M. Lendeckel W. Tuschl T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 188-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (2712) Google Scholar). Real-time RT-PCR—Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was performed as described. MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded at a concentration of 1 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates. Two days after seeding, total RNA was extracted from cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). First-strand cDNA was synthesized with PrimeScript reverse transcriptase (TaKaRa Bio, Shiga, Japan) and oligo(dT). Real-time PCR was performed using SYBR Green PCR master mix (Invitrogen) and the ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). PCR primers used are listed in supplemental Table 2. The specificity of detected signals was confirmed by a dissociation curve consisting of a single peak. All samples were run in duplicate in each experiment. Values were normalized by human HPRT1. Cell Migration Assay—To assess cell motility, chamber migration assays were performed using a cell culture insert (8-μm pore size, 12-well format; BD Biosciences). MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded in duplicate at a density of 5 × 105 cells/chamber. Twenty hours later, cells that had not moved to the lower wells were removed from the upper face of the filters using cotton swabs, and cells that had moved to the lower surface of the filter were stained with a Diff-Quik kit (Sysmex, Hyogo, Japan). Cell migration was quantified by visual counting after being photographed. Experiments were performed in duplicate. Mean values for three random fields were obtained for each well. Cell Proliferation Assay—MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded in duplicate at a density of 1 × 104 cells/well in 24-well plates and cultured for up to 96 h. Cells were trypsinized and counted at the times indicated using a Coulter counter (Beckman Coulter). Cell culture medium was replenished every second day. Transfection of cDNAs, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting—Transfection of DNA was performed using FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Cells were lysed using Igepal CA630 lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1! Igepal CA630, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 units/ml aprotinin. After centrifugation, protein concentrations of cell lysates were quantified with a DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories). In some experimental settings, cells were treated with 10 μm MG132 (Peptide Institute, Osaka, Japan) prior to harvesting to inhibit proteasomal degradation. For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates and antibodies were incubated anywhere from 2 h to overnight. Immune complexes were then precipitated with protein G-Sepharose beads. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (28Ebisawa T. Tada K. Kitajima I. Tojo K. Sampath T.K. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Imamura T. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3519-3527Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), except for the use of an LAS-3000 mini lumino-image analyzer (Fujifilm, Tokyo). To co-immunoprecipitate Smurf2 by the anti-Smurf1 antibodies, MDA-MB-231 cells were lysed in TNTE buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5! Triton-X 100) supplemented with protease inhibitors. Cell lysates were first incubated with 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads (pre-blocked with 100 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) for 1 h with gentle rotation. The cleared supernatants were then incubated with 4 μg of the anti-Smurf1 antibodies and protein G-Sepharose beads for 4 h. Normal goat IgG was used as negative control. The beads were intensively washed with TNTE buffer, and bound proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subjected to immunoblot analysis. The following antibodies were used: anti-Smurf1 F-20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma), anti-Myc 9E10 (BD Biosciences), anti-hemagglutinin (Invivogen, San Diego, CA), anti-α-tubulin DM1A (Sigma), anti-β-actin (Sigma), anti-phospho-Smad2 (Cell signaling, Beverly, MA), and anti-Smad2/3 (BD Biosciences). Anti-Smurf2 antiserum was prepared as follows: a 16-mer peptide, CDPRLAER-RVRSQRHR, which corresponds to residues 224–239 of human Smurf2, was synthesized and conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Calbiochem) using succinimidyl 4-(p-male-imidophenyl)butyrate (Pierce). The conjugate was injected into rabbits in Freund's complete adjuvant, and antiserum was collected from which anti-Smurf2 antibody was affinity-purified. Protein Stability Assay—293T cells were transiently transfected with expression plasmids for the indicated proteins. After 24 h, cells were incubated for the indicated times with 10 μg/ml of cycloheximide (Sigma). Cells were lysed in lysis buffer as described above, and the cell extracts were analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-Myc, anti-FLAG, and anti-β-actin antibodies. Intracardiac Experimental Metastasis Model—All animal procedures were performed in the animal experiment room of the Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research (JFCR) according to the guidelines proposed by the Science Council of Japan. Female BALB/c nu/nu mice (5 weeks old) were purchased from Charles River Japan, Inc. (Kanagawa, Japan). Mice were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions. Subconfluent MDA-MB-231 cells (2 × 105) were suspended in 200 μl of sterile Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10! fetal bovine serum and injected into the left ventricle of the heart with a 26-gauge needle under anesthesia with diethyl ether. Mice were imaged for luciferase activity immediately after injection to exclude any mice that had not been successfully xenografted. Radiographic Analysis of Bone Metastasis—Development of bone metastasis was monitored by x-ray radiography once a week for up to 9 weeks. Mice were anesthetized (50 mg/kg sodium pentobarbital), placed in a prone position on wrapped film (Fujifilm), and exposed to x-irradiation at 23 kV for 90 s using a soft x-ray apparatus (SOFRON; Sofron Co., Tokyo). Film was developed using a Fuji medical film Processor (SEPROS SV; Fujifilm) and inspected for visible bone lesions. Statistical Analysis—For quantitative real-time RT-PCR, cell migration analysis, and in vivo experiments, the results are expressed as means ± S.D. Student's t test was used to calculate the significance of differences between the two samples. For multiple comparisons of the data, the Tukey-Kramer method was used to calculate the significance of the differences. Knockdown of Smurf2 Enhances Cell Migration of MDA-MB-231 Cells—To explore the functional difference between Smurf1 and Smurf2 in cancer cells, we established human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells that stably express miR-control (MDA control cells), miR-Smurf1 (MDA-S1KD cells), and miR-Smurf2 (MDA-S2KD cells) through use of a lentivirus system. At least a 70! reduction in mRNA levels of Smurf1 (Fig. 1A, upper panel) and Smurf2 (Fig. 1A, lower panel) in MDA-S1KD cells and MDA-S2KD cells, respectively, was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR. Expression level of Smurf2 in MDA-S1KD cells and that of Smurf1 in MDA-S2KD cells did not differ compared with those in MDA-control cells. Because both Smurf1 and Smurf2 are known to inhibit TGF-β signaling, we first examined the effect of Smurf1 or Smurf2 knockdown on TGF-β signaling in MDA-MB-231 cells. As shown in Fig. 1B, knockdown of Smurf1 enhanced induction of the TGF-β target genes, Smad7 (upper panel) and PAI-1 (lower panel). However, unexpectedly, knockdown of Smurf2 failed to do so. Cell migration is a critical metastatic event that occurs in various epithelial cells during cancer progression. As Smurf1 has been reported to induce cell migration of cancer cells through degradation of RhoA (19Sahai E. Garcia-Medina R. Pouyssegur J. Vial E. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), we next examined whether Smurf2 also affects the cell migration of MDA-MB-231 cells. Cell migration was examined using a chamber migration assay. As expected, Smurf1 knockdown prevented cell migration of MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, knockdown of Smurf2 significantly enhanced migration of MDA-MB-231 cells, suggesting a functional difference between Smurf1 and Smurf2 in affecting migration of the breast cancer cells. Similar results were obtained using other miRNA target sequences (data not shown). Of note, the cell growth rate of MDA-S1KD cells and that of MDA-S2KD cells were not different compared with that of MDA-control cells (Fig. 1D), indicating that neither Smurf1 nor Smurf2 knockdown affects cell growth of MDA-MB-231 cells. Smurf2 Interacts with Smurf1 and Induces Its Ubiquitination and Degradation—To elucidate the mechanisms underlying enhanced cell migration of MDA-S2KD cells, we examined whether Smurf2 affects the expression or the function of Smurf1 in the cells. Although knockdown of Smurf2 did not affect the mRNA level of Smurf1 in MDA-MB-231 cells (see Fig. 1A), Smurf2 knockdown increased the expression level of Smurf1 protein (Fig. 2A). Of note, Smurf1 knockdown did not affect the protein level (Fig. 2A) and the mRNA level (see Fig. 1A) of Smurf2. These results suggest that Smurf2 induces degradation of Smurf1 protein, although Smurf1 is unable to induce degradation of Smurf2. As Smurf1 up-regulates cell migration of cancer cells through degradation of RhoA (19Sahai E. Garcia-Medina R. Pouyssegur J. Vial E. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), we also investigated the levels of RhoA and the activation status of RhoA in MDA-S1KD cells and MDA-S2KD cells. No substantial change in the total levels of RhoA and the activation status of RhoA were observed in Smurf1 or Smurf2 knockdown cells (supplemental Fig. S1 and data not shown), presumably because the activity of Smurf1 (probably also Smurf2) toward RhoA is restricted locally to the site of active protrusion (16Wang H.R. Zhang Y. Ozdamar B. Ogunjimi A.A. Alexandrova E. Thomsen G.H. Wrana J.L. Science. 2003; 302: 1775-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 19Sahai E. Garcia-Medina R. Pouyssegur J. Vial E. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). To determine whether Smurf1 is a direct target of Smurf2, we examined the physical interaction between Smurf1 and Smurf2. As shown in Fig. 2B, Smurf2 interacted with Smurf1 at an intensity comparable with that of the interaction between Smurf2 and Smad2 in transfected 293T cells. Moreover, endogenous Smurf2 bound endogenous Smurf1 in MDA-MB-231 cells in the presence of proteasomal inhibitor MG132 (Fig. 2C), indicating that Smurf2 interacts physiologically with Smurf1. We next examined the effect of Smurf2 on ubiquitination of Smurf1 in transfected 293T cells. As shown in Fig. 2D, Smurf2 induced ubiquitination of the catalytically inactive mutant of Smurf1, Smurf1(CA), suggesting that Smurf2 acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for Smurf1. Smurf1 also induced ubiquitination of Smurf1 itself in trans. Although both Smurf1 and Smurf2 ubiquitinated Smurf1 (Fig. 2D) and Smad7 (supplemental Fig. S2) (7Kavsak P. Rasmussen R.K. Causing C.G. Bonni S. Zhu H. Thomsen G.H. Wrana J.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1365-1375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar, 8Ebisawa T. Fukuchi M. Murakami G. Chiba T. Tanaka K. Imamura T. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12477-12480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar) at the same intensity, Smurf1 and Smurf2 failed to induce ubiquitination of Smurf2(CA) (Fig. 2D). Co-expression of Smurf2(WT) with Smurf1(CA) produced a significant, dose-dependent decrease in steady-state levels of Smurf1 protein (Fig. 2E). In contrast, Smurf2(CA) had little effect on Smurf1 protein levels. To confirm that the reduced abundance of Smurf1(CA) in response to Smurf2 expression resulted from increased proteolysis, we measured the half-life of Smurf1(CA) in the absence or presence of co-expressed Smurf2(WT) or Smurf2(CA). Expression of Smurf2(WT) enhanced the turnover of Smurf1(CA), whereas co-expression of Smurf2(CA) had no effect (Fig. 2F). These results indicate that Smurf2 specifically induces degradation of Smurf1 depending on its ligase activity. Decreased Smurf1 Cancels the Enhancement of Cell Migration in Smurf2 Knockdown MDA-MB-231 Cells—To explore whether knockdown of Smurf2 induces cell migration by increasing the expression of Smurf1 protein, we examined the effect of Smurf1 knockdown on migration of MDA-S2KD cells. Smurf1 was knocked down by siRNA transfection, and expression of the mRNAs (Fig. 3A) and proteins (supplemental Fig. S3) of Smurf1 and Smurf2 in the transfected MDA-control cells and MDA-S2KD cells was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and immunoblotting, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3B, knockdown of Smurf1 prevented migration of MDA-S2KD cells down to the level of the transfected MDA-control cells, suggesting that Smurf2 reduces migration of MDA-MB-231 cells through degradation of the Smurf1 protein. We also examined the expression levels of known substrates of Smurfs, including Smad1, Smad2, Smad7, SnoN, and TβR-I. Although Smad7 was slightly increased upon knockdown of Smurf1 or Smurf2, the other substrates were only marginally affected (supplemental Fig. S1). These results, together with the results shown in Fig. 1B, indicate that cell motility of Smurf2-knocked down cells was promoted through the mechanism independent on TGF-β-signaling. Knockdown of Smurf2 Enhances Bone Metastasis of MDA-MB-231 Cells in Vivo—To examine the effect of endogenous Smurf2 on bone metastasis of breast cancer cells in vivo, MDA-control cells, MDA-S1KD cells, and MDA-S2KD cells were inoculated into the left cardiac ventricle of immunodeficient mice to allow the formation of bone metastasis. Progression of bone metastasis was assessed by whole-body x-ray radiography. As shown in Fig. 4, the frequency of bone metastasis in the whole body (Fig. 4A) as well as tibiae (Fig. 4B) of mice inoculated with MDA-S2KD cells was higher than that in mice inoculated with MDA-control cells. On the other hand, knockdown of Smurf1 did not affect bone metastasis of MDA-MB-231 cells in vivo. Interestingly, the area of bone metastasis in the tibiae of mice inoculated with MDA-S2KD cells was larger than that in mice inoculated with MDA-control cells or MDA-S1KD cells (Fig. 4C). These results suggest the possibility that Smurf2 prevents bone metastasis of breast cancer cells in vivo. Because ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation plays key roles in various biological processes, the activities of E3 ubiquitin ligases are frequently regulated by several modifications including phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination. The Nedd4-like family of E3 ubiquitin ligases includes nine members, e.g. Smurf1, Smurf2, AIP/Itch, Nedd4-2, and WWP1, and shares a similar structure, i.e. a C2 domain at the N terminus, two to four WW domains in the middle of the protein, and a HECT domain at the C terminus (29Chen C. Matesic L.E. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2007; 26: 587-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Among them, AIP/Itch has been reported to be phosphorylated in response to epidermal growth factor (30Courbard J.R. Fiore F. Adelaide J. Borg J.P. Birnbaum D. Ollendorff V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45267-45275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) or insulin-like growth factor (31Morrione A. Plant P. Valentinis B. Staub O. Kumar S. Rotin D. Baserga R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24094-24099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Nedd4-2 is phosphorylated by serum and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase (SGK1), a target of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/PDK1 pathway (32Snyder P.M. Olson D.R. Kabra R. Zhou R. Steines J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45753-45758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Moreover, AIP/Itch and WWP1 have been reported to be regulated by ubiquitin-dependent degradation (29Chen C. Matesic L.E. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2007; 26: 587-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 33Gao M. Labuda T. Xia Y. Gallagher E. Fang D. Liu Y.C. Karin M. Science. 2004; 306: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). However, little is known regarding regulation of Smurf1 and Smurf2 by post-translational modifications. In the present study, we demonstrated that Smurf2 post-translationally regulates Smurf1, whereas the reverse is not true. Knockdown of Smurf2 in breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells increased expression of Smurf1 protein and enhanced cell migration in vitro and bone metastasis in vivo, whereas Smurf1 knockdown in the cells reduced cell migration in vitro. Knockdown of Smurf1, however, did not affect bone metastasis of MDA-MB-231 cells in vivo, presumably because Smurf1 knockdown reduced TGF-β-independent cell migration but enhanced TGF-β-induced bone metastasis. These results suggested opposite roles for these two related E3 ubiquitin ligases in cancer progression. We also demonstrated that knockdown of Smurf1, but not of Smurf2, enhanced TGF-β signaling (see Fig. 1B). Although Smurf1 knockdown enhanced the phosphorylation of Smad2 after TGF-β stimulation, Smurf2 knockdown did not (data not shown). As Smurf2 knockdown increases the expression of Smurf1 protein (Fig. 2A), we think that increased protein levels of Smurf1 in MDA-S2KD cells offsets the effect of Smurf2 knockdown on TGF-β signaling. In fact, double knockdown of Smurf1 and Smurf2 more strikingly enhanced TGF-β signaling than did Smurf1 knockdown (data not shown). Therefore, two related E3 ubiquitin ligases, Smurf1 and Smurf2, act in the same direction in TGF-β family signaling but play opposite roles in cell migration. In summary, we have shown that Smurf2 represses the migration of MDA-MB-231 cells through the degradation of Smurf1. We also have shown the difference of function between Smurf1 and Smurf2 in human breast cancer cells. The regulation and biological functions of E3 ubiquitin ligases are very complex processes. However, understanding the oncogenic or tumor suppressive potential of E3 ubiquitin ligases may facilitate the identification and development of biomarkers and drug targets in human cancer.

We present a magnetic resonance method that is suitable for imaging temperature in a wide range of environments. It uses the inherently sharp resonances of intermolecular zero-quantum coherences, in this case flipping up a water spin while flipping down a nearby fat spin. We show that this method can rapidly and accurately assign temperatures in vivo on an absolute scale."
https://openalex.org/W2003069888,"Several genetic variations have been associated with Parkinson disease in different populations over the past few years. Although a considerable number of worldwide populations have been screened for these variants, results from Sub-Saharan populations are very scarce in the literature. In the present report we have screened a cohort of Parkinson disease patients (n = 57) and healthy controls (n = 51) from Nigeria for mutations in the genes PRKN, LRRK2 and ATXN3. No pathogenic mutations were found in any of the genes. Hence, common pathogenic mutations in these genes, observed in several different populations, are not a frequent cause of Parkinson disease in Nigeria."
https://openalex.org/W2020018062,"Background Our aim was to prospectively investigate the association between carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT) as well as carotid plaque and incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke in Chinese, among whom data are limited. Methods and Findings We conducted a community-based cohort study composed of 2190 participants free of cardiovascular disease at baseline in one community. During a median 10.5-year follow up, we documented 68 new cases of coronary heart disease and 94 cases of stroke. The multivariate relative risks (RRs) associated with a change of 1 standard deviation of maximal common carotid IMT were 1.38 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12–1.70) for CHD and 1.47 (95% CI, 1.28–1.69) for stroke. The corresponding RRs with internal carotid IMT were 1.47 (95% CI, 1.21–1.79) for CHD and 1.52 (95% CI, 1.31–1.76) for stroke. Carotid plaque measured by the degree of diameter stenosis was also significantly associated with increased risk of CHD (p for trend<0.0001) and stroke (p for trend<0.0001). However, these associations were largely attenuated when adjusting for IMT measurements. Conclusions This prospective study indicates a significant association between carotid IMT and incidence of CHD and stroke in Chinese adults. These measurements may be useful for cardiovascular risk assessment and stratification in Chinese."
https://openalex.org/W2012416186,"We report a novel molecular ruler for measurement of distances and distance distributions with accurate external calibration. Using solution X-ray scattering we determine the scattering interference between two gold nanocrystal probes attached site-specifically to a macromolecule of interest. Fourier transformation of the interference pattern provides a model-independent probability distribution for the distances between the probe centers-of-mass. To test the approach, we measure end-to-end distances for a variety of DNA structures. We demonstrate that measurements with independently prepared samples and using different X-ray sources are highly reproducible, we demonstrate the quantitative accuracy of the first and second moments of the distance distributions, and we demonstrate that the technique recovers complex distribution shapes. Distances measured with the solution scattering-interference ruler match the corresponding crystallographic values, but differ from distances measured previously with alternate ruler techniques. The X-ray scattering interference ruler should be a powerful tool for relating crystal structures to solution structures and for studying molecular fluctuations."
https://openalex.org/W2064355457,"Various receptors on cell surface recognize specific extracellular molecules and trigger signal transduction altering gene expression in the nucleus. Gain or loss-of-function mutations of one molecule have shown to affect alternative signaling pathways with a poorly understood mechanism. In Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 signaling, which branches into MyD88- and TRAM-dependent pathways upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, we investigated the gain or loss-of-function mutations of MyD88. We predict, using a computational model built on the perturbation-response approach and the law of mass conservation, that removal and addition of MyD88 in TLR4 activation, enhances and impairs, respectively, the alternative TRAM-dependent pathway through signaling flux redistribution (SFR) at pathway branches. To verify SFR, we treated MyD88-deficient macrophages with LPS and observed enhancement of TRAM-dependent pathway based on increased IRF3 phosphorylation and induction of Cxcl10 and Ifit2. Furthermore, increasing the amount of MyD88 in cultured cells showed decreased TRAM binding to TLR4. Investigating another TLR4 pathway junction, from TRIF to TRAF6, RIP1 and TBK1, the removal of MyD88-dependent TRAF6 increased expression of TRAM-dependent Cxcl10 and Ifit2. Thus, we demonstrate that SFR is a novel mechanism for enhanced activation of alternative pathways when molecules at pathway junctions are removed. Our data suggest that SFR may enlighten hitherto unexplainable intracellular signaling alterations in genetic diseases where gain or loss-of-function mutations are observed."
https://openalex.org/W2100805313,"Ipecac alkaloids produced in the medicinal plant Psychotria ipecacuanha such as emetine and cephaeline possess a monoterpenoid-tetrahydroisoquinoline skeleton, which is formed by condensation of dopamine and secologanin. Deglucosylation of one of the condensed products N-deacetylisoipecoside (1α(S)-epimer) is considered to be a part of the reactions for emetine biosynthesis, whereas its 1β(R)-epimer N-deacetylipecoside is converted to ipecoside in P. ipecacuanha. Here, we isolated a cDNA clone Ipeglu1 encoding Ipecac alkaloid β-d-glucosidase from P. ipecacuanha. The deduced protein showed 54 and 48% identities to raucaffricine β-glucosidase and strictosidine β-glucosidase, respectively. Recombinant IpeGlu1 enzyme preferentially hydrolyzed glucosidic Ipecac alkaloids except for their lactams, but showed poor or no activity toward other substrates, including terpenoid-indole alkaloid glucosides. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis of deglucosylated products of N-deacetylisoipecoside revealed spontaneous transitions of the highly reactive aglycons, one of which was supposed to be the intermediate for emetine biosynthesis. IpeGlu1 activity was extremely poor toward 7-O-methyl and 6,7-O,O-dimethyl derivatives. However, 6-O-methyl derivatives were hydrolyzed as efficiently as non-methylated substrates, suggesting the possibility of 6-O-methylation prior to deglucosylation by IpeGlu1. In contrast to the strictosidine β-glucosidase that stereospecifically hydrolyzes 3α(S)-epimer in terpenoid-indole alkaloid biosynthesis, IpeGlu1 lacked stereospecificity for its substrates where 1β(R)-epimers were preferred to 1α(S)-epimers, although ipecoside (1β(R)) is a major alkaloidal glucoside in P. ipecacuanha, suggesting the compartmentalization of IpeGlu1 from ipecoside. These facts have significant implications for distinct physiological roles of 1α(S)- and 1β(R)-epimers and for the involvement of IpeGlu1 in the metabolic fate of both of them.

Psychotria ipecacuanha Stokes (Rubiaceae) is a medicinal plant that is native to South and Central America. Its roots and rhizome have long been used as an emetic and an anti-amebic (1.Janot M.-M. Manske R.H.F. Holmes H.L. The Alkaloids. 3. Academic Press, New York1953: 363-394Google Scholar). These medicinal effects derive from its principal alkaloid emetine. In the plant, emetine occurs together with a number of related alkaloids, including cephaeline and ipecoside (2.Fujii T. Ohba M. Cordel G.A. The Alkaloids. 51. Academic Press, New York1998: 271-321Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). They are collectively called Ipecac alkaloids and possess a monoterpenoid-tetrahydroisoquinoline skeleton. Some of the Ipecac alkaloids, including emetine and cephaeline, have also been found in Alangium lamarckii Thwaites (Alangiaceae), a medicinal plant distributed throughout India and Southeast Asia (2.Fujii T. Ohba M. Cordel G.A. The Alkaloids. 51. Academic Press, New York1998: 271-321Google Scholar).Tetrahydroisoquinoline and fragmented monoterpenoid moieties of emetine and cephaeline originate from dopamine and secologanin, respectively (3.Battersby A.R. Burnett A.R. Parsons P.G. J. Chem. Soc. C. 1969; 1969: 1187-1192Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 4.Battersby A.R. Parry R.J. Chem.

Coggiola D. Zenk M.H. Planta Med. 1978; 34: 381-389Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). They are condensed in a manner of a Pictet-Spengler reaction to form two epimers, N-deacetylisoipecoside (1α(S)-epimer) and N-deacetylipecoside (1β(R)-epimer) (Fig. 1). Previously, it was revealed that the condensation reaction is catalyzed by two enzymes, N-deacetylisoipecoside synthase and N-deacetylipecoside synthase, each of which stereoselectively produces each epimer in Alangium (7.De-Eknamkul W. Ounaroon A. Tanahashi T. Kutchan T.M. Zenk M.H. Phytochemistry. 1997; 45: 477-484Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 8.De-Eknamkul W. Suttipanta N. Kutchan T.M. Phytochemistry. 2000; 55: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The enzyme producing the 1β(R)-epimer was purified but not that producing the 1α(S)-epimer due to its lability (8.De-Eknamkul W. Suttipanta N. Kutchan T.M. Phytochemistry. 2000; 55: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Tracer experiments using pure epimer clearly demonstrated that emetine and cephaeline are synthesized from the 1α(S)-epimer. On the other hand, the 1β(R)-epimer N-deacetylipecoside is converted to alkaloidal glucosides, ipecoside in Psychotria and alangiside in Alangium, with retention of configuration (5.Nagakura N. Höfle G. Zenk M.H. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1978; 1978: 896-898Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 6.Nagakura N. Höfle G. Coggiola D. Zenk M.H.

They are accumulated as the main alkaloidal glucosides.The condensation reaction of dopamine and secologanin is similar to monoterpenoid-indole alkaloid biosynthesis where the reaction is launched from tryptamine and secologanin to form strictosidine but is different in terms of stereochemistry of the products.

The enzyme activity catalyzing the formation of vincoside has not been detected. In accordance with these facts, exogenously administrated vincoside was not converted to any alkaloids, showing that vincoside is not the intermediate for terpenoid-indole alkaloid biosynthesis (16.Stöckigt J.

Meanwhile strictosidine was demonstrated to serve as precursor for terpenoid-indole alkaloids not only with α-configuration, but also with β-configuration by inversion of the configuration at the corresponding chiral center in the biosynthetic process (17.Rueffer M. Nagakura N. Zenk M.H. Tetrahedron Lett. 1978; 19: 1593-1596Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Such inversion does not occur in Ipecac alkaloid biosynthesis (5.Nagakura N. Höfle G. Zenk M.H. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1978; 1978: 896-898Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 6.Nagakura N. Höfle G. Coggiola D. Zenk M.H. Planta Med. 1978; 34: 381-389Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar).In terpenoid-indole alkaloid biosynthesis, strictosidine is deglucosylated by strictosidine β-glucosidase to form a highly reactive aglycon, which could be the precursor of a diverse array of indole alkaloids (18.Stöckigt J. Zenk M.H. FEBS Lett. 1977; 79: 233-237Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Genes encoding strictosidine β-glucosidase have been cloned from C. roseus (19.Geerlings A. Ibanñez M.M.-L. Memelink J. van der Heijden R. Verpoorte R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3051-3056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and R. serpentina (20.Gerasimenko I. Sheludko Y. Ma X. Stöckigt J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2204-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Strictosidine β-glucosidase stereoselectively catalyzes the deglucosylation of strictosidine, but not its 3β(R)-epimer vincoside, which is consistent with the occurrence of only strictosidine in those plants. Some structures of the intermediates derived from strictosidine aglycon have been elucidated (20.Gerasimenko I. Sheludko Y. Ma X. Stöckigt J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2204-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In analogy with terpenoid-indole alkaloid biosynthesis, it has been predicted that N-deacetylisoipecoside is deglucosylated to form an intermediate of emetine biosynthesis.Despite the occurrence of alkaloidal glucosides with both 1α(S)- and 1β(R)-configurations in Ipecac alkaloid biosynthesis, only the 1α(S)-epimer serves as precursor for emetine biosynthesis. Moreover non-glucosidic alkaloids with the β-configuration have not been found in P. ipecacuanha. These facts allowed us to hypothesize that the deglucosylation step plays important roles not only for the production of intermediate of emetine biosynthesis, but also for the metabolic channeling of the 1α(S)- and 1β(R)-epimers. In this report, we have isolated cDNAs encoding Ipecac alkaloid β-glucosidase from P. ipecacuanha. On the basis of enzymatic characterization and identification of the deglucosylated products, we propose a detailed biosynthetic process and discuss physiological significance of formation of the alkaloidal glucosides with distinct configurations in P. ipecacuanha.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESShoot and Root in Vitro Cultures—P. ipecacuanha in vitro plants were obtained from the Tropical Plant Biotechnology Laboratory, the Technological Institute of Costa Rica in San Carlos. Shoots were cultivated in LS medium (1650 mg/liter NH4NO3, 1900 mg/liter KNO3, 370 mg/liter MgSO4 · 7H2O, 170 mg/liter KH2PO4, 440 mg/liter CaCl2 · 2H2O, 41.3 mg/liter Na2-EDTA · 2H2O, 27.8 mg/liter FeSO4 7H2O, 6.2 mg/liter H3BO3, 16.9 mg/liter MnSO4 · H2O, 8.6 mg/liter ZnSO4 · 7H2O, 0.83 mg/liter KI, 0.25 mg/liter Na2MoO4 · 2H2O, 0.025 mg/liter CuSO4 · 5H2O, 0.025 mg/liter CoCl2 · 6H2O) (21.Linsmaier E.M. Skoog F. Physiol. Plant. 1965; 18: 100-127Crossref Scopus (2819) Google Scholar), pH 5.75, containing 3% sucrose, 0.1 mg/liter thiamine hydrochloride, 0.5 mg/liter nicotinic acid, 0.5 mg/liter pyroxidine hydrochloride, 0.1 g/liter myo-inositol, 10 μg/liter 1-naphthaleneacetic acid, 3 mg/liter 6-benzylaminopurine, and 0.6% agar. Roots were cultivated in the same medium except for 0.5 mg/liter 1-naphthaleneacetic acid without 6-benzylaminopurine and agar. Shoot cultures were grown at 24 °C under a photoperiod of 16-h light (50 μmol/m2/s)/8-h dark, and maintained every 6–8 weeks. Root cultures were grown in darkness at 25–28 °C on an orbital shaker at 100 rpm. The root-culture medium was replenished every 3–4 weeks, and the root tissues were divided every 2 months.Cloning of β-d-Glucosidase cDNAs—Total RNA was isolated from shoot and root cultures by the acid-guanidium-phenol-chloroform method (22.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62993) Google Scholar) or by using an RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen), and poly(A)+ RNA was purified from the total RNA using an Oligotex mRNA mini kit (Qiagen). A λ-ZAP cDNA library was constructed from root mRNA using a ZAP Express Kit (Stratagene). Inserts were amplified by PCR with universal primers and sequenced. Out of 1050 single-pass sequenced expressed sequence tags, a clone ph0212-60 showed high similarity to strictosidine β-glucosidase and raucaffricine β-glucosidase. The missing 5′-upper sequence was obtained by 5′-RACE using a SMART RACE 3The abbreviations used are: RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; HPLC, high-performance liquid chromatography; LC-MS/MS, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry; pNP, p-nitrophenyl. cDNA amplification kit (Clontech) with the following gene-specific reverse primers: 5′-GCAGAGCTCCGCGAAGTCACGGAAGTCG-3′ (1st PCR) and 5′-CCAGGCAATATCCGTGGCCATGATATGGAG-3′ (2nd PCR). Then, PCR amplification of the cDNA, including the entire coding region was done using shoot cDNA as template by Pfu DNA polymerase with two sets of primers: 5′-GTGCAATCTCTCAACAACAACAACAATG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCAATCTTCAATTGTCAAAAGGGACGC-3′ (reverse) for the 1st PCR, and 5′-CACCACAACAACAATGTCTAGTG-3′ (forward, underline is adaptor for TOPO cloning) and 5′-GTCAAAAGGGACGCTTTC-3′ (reverse) for the 2nd PCR. The products were inserted into pET100/D-TOPO (Invitrogen) and sequenced to obtain Ipeglu1 cDNA.Because the Ipeglu1 coding sequence possessed 12 single nucleotide polymorphisms from the original partial glucosidase clone (ph0212-60) in the overlapped region, the presence of multiple copies of the glucosidase was predicted. To isolate additional glucosidase cDNAs, reverse transcription-PCR was performed using shoot and root cDNAs as template by Phusion HS-HF polymerase (Finnzymes) with the primers designed from the edge of 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions: 5′-GTCAACCAAAAGTTCCATTGCAAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GAAAATAAAGAAGGAATTTATTCAACCGTTC-3′ (reverse). The products were inserted into pCR-Blunt II-TOPO (Invitrogen) and sequenced to obtain Ipeglu2-Ipeglu9.Expression and Purification of β-d-Glucosidase in E. coli—The entire coding region of the glucosidase cDNA was ligated into pET100/D-TOPO (Invitrogen). The vector was introduced into the Escherichia coli strain PlusS (Expression Technologies) for gene expression. The recombinant E. coli was grown in 1 liter of LB medium containing 200 μg/ml ampicillin and 35 μg/ml chloramphenicol at 37 °C until the A600 reached 0.7. After cooling down the culture, isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added (1 mm) to induce gene expression, followed by the overnight culture (∼18 h) at 18 °C. The cells were harvested (6,000 × g, 10 min) and resuspended in 40 ml of 50 mm NaPi buffer (pH 7.5) containing 10% glycerol and 0.5% protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). After sonication (20 s at 50 watts, 6 times) and centrifugation (20,000 × g, 20 min), the supernatant containing soluble protein was collected for purification of N-terminal His-tagged IpeGlu protein.The recombinant protein was purified with TALON His-Tag Purification Resin (Clontech). All operations were done at 4 °C. The resins (1 ml of bed volume per 20 ml of the supernatant) equilibrated in 50 mm NaPi buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.5 m NaCl and 10% glycerol were mixed with the supernatant for 1 h. After the resin was washed with equilibration buffer, the recombinant IpeGlu protein was eluted in a stepwise manner by increasing the imidazole concentration (5, 50, and 200 mm) in 50 mm NaPi buffer (pH 7.0) containing 0.5 m NaCl and 10% glycerol. The 200 mm imidazole fraction was concentrated by ultrafiltration to 2.5 ml, and imidazole was removed using a PD10 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with the same buffer without imidazole. Purified protein was stored at –80 °C. The protein profile was analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE. Protein concentration was measured by the method of Bradford (23.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213553) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard.General Conditions for Chemical Analysis—HPLC analysis was performed with a Hitachi D7000 system using an ODS column (Nova-Pak C18, 3.9 × 300 mm, 4 μm, Waters) at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. Elution was achieved with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (solvent A) and acetonitrile (solvent B). Preparative HPLC was performed with the same HPLC system using an ODS column (LiChrosorb RP18, 25 × 250 mm, 7 μm, Merck) at a flow rate of 8.0 ml/min. Unless otherwise noted, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (solvent A) and acetonitrile (solvent B) were used as the mobile phase. Fractions from preparative HPLC were concentrated in vacuo and freeze-dried.For LC-MS/MS analysis, HPLC separation was conducted with a Shimadzu LC20A system. Mass spectra were obtained using a 4000 Q-TRAP triple stage quadruple mass spectrometer equipped with a TurboIonSpray ionization source (Applied Biosystems) in a positive ion mode.Substrates for Enzyme Assay—Of the 30 compounds listed in Table 1 and supplemental Fig. S1, ipecoside, secologanin, loganin, galloyl-Glc, and esculin were from the chemical stock of Dr. Meinhart H. Zenk (Donald Danforth Plant Science Center). Raucaffricine and arbutin were gifts from Dr. Joachim Stöckigt (Johannes Gutenberg-Universität, Germany). Apigenin-7-O-Glc, naringenin-7-O-Glc, luteolin-7-O-Glc, luteolin-4′-O-Glc, quercetin-4′-O-Glc, and quercetin-3-O-Glc were gifts from Dr. Thomas Vogt (Leibniz Institute of Plant Biochemistry, Germany). Salicin was purchased from Sigma, and p-nitrophenyl (pNP)-α-Glc and pNP-β-Glc were from Acros Organics. Secologanin was repurified prior to use by preparative HPLC (eluent, A = 0.1% acetic acid, B = acetonitrile, gradient = 10–40% B/(A + B) in 36 min; detection, 254 nm). The other 14 compounds were prepared by chemical synthesis.TABLE 1Substrate specificity of the recombinant IpeGlu1SubstrateKmVmaxkcatkcat/KmRelative efficiencymmnmol/min/mgs-1s-1/mm%N-Deacetylipecoside0.3225,57728.288.1100N-Deacetylisoipecoside5.878,19086.314.916.96-O-Methyl-N-deacetylipecoside0.3928,15731.179.790.56-O-Methyl-N-deacetylisoipecoside1.316,90618.714.416.37-O-Methyl-N-deacetylipecoside12.745,58050.34.04.57-O-Methyl-N-deacetylisoipecoside25.522,72725.10.981.16,7-O,O-Dimethyl-N-deacetylipecoside13.535,73239.42.93.36,7-O,O-Dimethyl-N-deacetylisoipecoside35.021,98924.30.690.8Ipecoside0.1046,72951.6516586DemethylalangisideNDaND, not detected.NDNDND0DemethylisoalangisideNDNDNDND0Strictosidine0.191,9452.111.112.6Vincoside0.295,7866.422.125.1Strictosidine lactamNDNDNDND0Vincoside lactamNDNDNDND0Secologanin26.530,30333.41.31.5Loganin33.219,88121.90.660.7RaucaffricineNDNDNDND0Galloyl-Glc65.16,0246.60.100.1Apigenin-7-O-Glc-b-, not determined.39.2cActivity at 0.2 mm.---Naringenin-7-O-Glc-4.1cActivity at 0.2 mm.---Luteolin-7-O-Glc-22.3cActivity at 0.2 mm.---Luteolin-4′-O-Glc-28.4cActivity at 0.2 mm.---Quercetin-4′-O-Glc-11.4cActivity at 0.2 mm.---Quercetin-3-O-GlcNDNDNDND0ArbutinNDNDNDND0EsculinNDNDNDND0SalicinNDNDNDND0pNP-β-Glc21.53,5463.90.180.2pNP-α-Glc-15.2dActivity at 20 mm.---a ND, not detected.b -, not determined.c Activity at 0.2 mm.d Activity at 20 mm. Open table in a new tab N-Deacetylipecoside and N-deacetylisoipecoside were synthesized as described previously (3.Battersby A.R. Burnett A.R. Parsons P.G. J. Chem. Soc.

Secologanin (60 mg) and dopamine hydrochloride (30 mg) were dissolved in 0.9 ml of 0.1 m citrate/0.2 m phosphate buffer (pH 5.0) and reacted for 3 days in darkness at room temperature under N2. The reaction mixture was directly subjected to preparative HPLC (10–25% B/(A + B) in 48 min; 230 nm) (obtained as trifluoroacetate). Their authenticity was confirmed as described in Ref. 6.Nagakura N. Höfle G. Coggiola D. Zenk M.H. Planta Med. 1978; 34: 381-389Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar and by MS/MS analysis.Demethylalangiside and demethylisoalangiside were synthesized from N-deacetylipecoside and N-deacetylisoipecoside, respectively, according to Ref. 24.Itoh A. Tanahashi T. Nagakura N. Nat. Prod. 1995; 58: 1228-1239Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar with modifications. Following the alkaline treatment of N-deacetylipecoside and N-deacetylisoipecoside, the reaction mixture was directly subjected to preparative HPLC (eluent, A = 0.1% formic acid, B = acetonitrile, gradient = 15–40% B/(A + B) in 45 min; 254 nm) (obtained as formate). Their authenticity was confirmed by comparing 1H NMR spectra with those reported by Ref. 24.Itoh A. Tanahashi T. Nagakura N. Nat. Prod. 1995; 58: 1228-1239Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar, as well as by MS/MS analysis. Configuration of C-13a (see Ref. 24.Itoh A. Tanahashi T. Nagakura N. Nat. Prod. 1995; 58: 1228-1239Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar) was confirmed by measuring nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy spectra detecting the correlation between H-13a and H-12a.Preparation of 7-O-methyl-N-deacetylipecoside and 7-O-methyl-N-deacetylisoipecoside was performed by the condensation reaction of secologanin with 3-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenethylamine hydrochloride (25.Shoeb A. Raj K. Kapil R.S. Popli S.P. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1. 1975; 1975: 1245-1248Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar) with the same procedure as described for the reaction with dopamine, except for the HPLC condition (10–32% B/(A + B) in 50 min; 230 nm). Because condensation reactions of secologanin with 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenethylamine hydrochloride and with 3,4-dimethoxyphenethylamine were not successful, 6-O-methyl-N-deacetylipecoside, 6,7-O,O-dimethyl-N-deacetylipecoside, and their 1α(S)-epimers were synthesized as follows.To a solution of N-deacetylipecoside-trifluoroacetate (50 mg, 78.5 μmol) and di-tert-butyldicarbonate (19 mg, 87 μmol) in 0.8 ml of methanol was added 20 μl (140 μmol) of triethylamine, and the mixture was reacted at room temperature until N-deacetylipecoside disappeared (2.5 h; monitored by HPLC). After the solvent was removed under N2 flow, the residue was treated with 0.8 ml of dilute HCl (7 mm) and extracted six times with 0.8 ml of ethyl acetate. The combined organic layer was washed with saturated NaCl and dried under N2 flow, followed by stirring in ether to precipitate the product as a white powder (N-tert-butoxycarbonyl deacetylipecoside, 42.2 mg, 67.7 μmol), containing small amount of impurities. It was dissolved in methanol (6.8 ml), and 1.7 ml (3.4 mmol) of (trimethylsilyl)diazomethane (in ether) was added. The reaction mixture in a sealed flask was stirred for 30 min at room temperature. Excess (trimethylsilyl)diazomethane was decomposed by adding 0.2 ml of acetic acid. After the solvent was evaporated under N2 flow, the residue was dissolved in methanol (1 ml) and subjected to preparative HPLC (eluent, A = water, B = acetonitrile, gradient = 20–48% B/(A + B) in 80 min; 230 nm). Four major peaks (material, and 6-O-methylated-, 7-O-methylated-, and 6,7-O,O-dimethylated products) were collected, and the material fraction was evaporated to dryness. Using the recovered material, reaction with (trimethylsilyl)diazomethane and purification were repeated twice. Combined HPLC fractions of the 6-O-methylated product were evaporated to dryness, and the residue was treated with trifluoroacetic acid (1 ml) for 5 min at room temperature to remove tert-butoxycarbonyl group. After removing trifluoroacetic acid under N2 flow, the residue was dissolved in 1 ml of 50% methanol/water and subjected to preparative HPLC (10–26% B/(A + B) in 90 min; 230 nm) to give 6-O-methyl-N-deacetylipecoside-trifluoroacetate (8.3 mg). Its 1α(S)-epimer 6-O-methyl-N-deacetylisoipecoside-trifluoroacetate (11.3 mg) was obtained by the same procedure from 50 mg of N-deacetylisoipecoside-trifluoroacetate.Although 6,7-O,O-dimethyl-N-deacetylipecoside and its 1α(S)-epimer could be obtained from the HPLC fractions mentioned above, they were more efficiently prepared from 7-O-methyl-N-deacetylipecoside and 7-O-methyl-N-deacetylisoipecoside, respectively. Following the N-protection of 7-O-methyl-N-deacetylipecoside-trifluoroacetate (40 mg, 61.4 μmol), the O-methylation reaction was conducted using 100 eq of (trimethylsilyl)diazomethane for 1 h at room temperature. After deprotection with trifluoroacetic acid, the residue was purified by preparative HPLC (10–42% B/(A + B) in 72 min; 230 nm) to give 6,7-O,O-dimethyl-N-deacetylipecoside-trifluoroacetate (32 mg). Its 1α(S)-epimer 6,7-O,O-dimethyl-N-deacetylisoipecoside-trifluoroacetate (27.8 mg) was obtained by the same procedure from 40 mg of 7-O-methyl-N-deacetylisoipecoside-trifluoroacetate.Strictosidine and vincoside were prepared according to Ref. 26.Battersby A.R.

Secologanin (20 mg) and tryptamine hydrochloride (10 mg) were dissolved in 0.15 ml of 0.1 m citrate/0.2 m phosphate buffer (pH 4.5) and reacted for 2.5 days in darkness at 37 °C under N2. The reaction mixture was directly subjected to preparative HPLC (eluent, A = 1% formic acid, B = acetonitrile, gradient = 20–30% B/(A + B) in 60 min; 254 nm) (obtained as formate).Strictosidine lactam and vincoside lactam were prepared by the alkaline treatment of strictosidine (0.4 mg) and vincoside (0.4 mg) at 75 °C for 2 h (16.Stöckigt J. Zenk M.H. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1977; 1977: 646-648Crossref Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Because the reaction mixture hardly contained impurities, they were directly used for the enzyme assay after centrifugation.Enzyme Assay—The enzyme assay of the recombinant IpeGlu1 for the screening of substrates (Table 1 and supplemental Fig. S1) was performed in 0.1 m citrate/0.2 m phosphate buffer (pH 5.0) containing 1 μg of enzyme and 1 mm substrate (0.2 mm for flavonoids and raucaffricine; 0.5 mm for demethylalangiside and demethylisoalangiside) in a total volume of 100 μl for 1 h at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 20 μl of 1 n HCl. After centrifugation (16,000 × g, 2 min), the supernatant was subjected to HPLC analysis. Conditions for UV detection and solvent gradient were changed appropriately with substrates. Decrease in substrate and/or generation of enzymatic products were monitored. When pNP-Glcs were used as substrate, the reaction was terminated by adding an equal volume of 0.2 m Na2CO3, and the product was monitored spectrophotometrically at 400 nm.The reaction mixture (100 μl) for the determination of pH optimum contained 1 mm substrate (N-deacetylipecoside or N-deacetylisoipecoside) and enzyme (0.1 μg for N-deacetylipecoside and 0.5 μg for N-deacetylisoipecoside) in the following buffers; 0.1 m citrate/0.2 m phosphate (pH 2.5–7.0), 0.1 m KPi (pH 6.0–8.0), and 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.0–9.0). After incubation (30 °C, 10 min), the decrease in substrate was analyzed by HPLC (12–80% B/(A + B) in 30 min; 230 nm). The temperature optimum was determined using N-deacetylisoipecoside as substrate by the reaction in 0.1 m citrate/0.2 m phosphate buffer (pH 5.0) containing 1 mm substrate and 0.5 μg of enzyme in a total volume of 100 μl. After an incubation (25–70 °C, 10 min), decrease in substrate was analyzed by HPLC.Effects of metal cations, EDTA and 2-mercaptoethanol, on the IpeGlu1 activity were examined by the reaction in 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) (instead of citrate/phosphate buffer to avoid formation of insoluble salt between metal cations and the phosphate ion) containing 1 mm N-deacetylipecoside, 0.1 μg of enzyme, and the additives listed in Table 2 in a total volume of 100 μl.

https://openalex.org/W1982461131,"The study of binary Kuiper Belt objects helps to probe the dynamic conditions present during planet formation in the solar system. We report on the mutual-orbit determination of 2001 QW322, a Kuiper Belt binary with a very large separation whose properties challenge binary-formation and -evolution theories. Six years of tracking indicate that the binary's mutual-orbit period is approximately 25 to 30 years, that the orbit pole is retrograde and inclined 50 degrees to 62 degrees from the ecliptic plane, and, most surprisingly, that the mutual orbital eccentricity is <0.4. The semimajor axis of 105,000 to 135,000 kilometers is 10 times that of other near-equal-mass binaries. Because this weakly bound binary is prone to orbital disruption by interlopers, its lifetime in its present state is probably less than 1 billion years."
https://openalex.org/W2061153448,"Histoplasmosis, due to the intracellular fungus Histoplasma capsulatum, can be diagnosed by demonstrating the presence of antibodies specific to the immunodominant M antigen. However, the role of this protein in the pathogenesis of histoplasmosis has not been elucidated. We sought to structurally and immunologically characterize the protein, determine yeast cell surface expression, and confirm catalase activity. A 3D-rendering of the M antigen by homology modeling revealed that the structures and domains closely resemble characterized fungal catalases. We generated monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to the protein and determined that the M antigen is present on the yeast cell surface and in cell wall/cell membrane preparations. Similarly, we found that the majority of catalase activity was in extracts containing fungal surface antigens and that the M antigen is not significantly secreted by live yeast cells. The mAbs also identified unique epitopes on the M antigen. The localization of the M antigen to the cell surface of H. capsulatum yeast and the characterization of the protein's major epitopes have important implications since it demonstrates that although the protein may participate in protecting the fungus against oxidative stress it is also accessible to host immune cells and antibody."
https://openalex.org/W2072501500,"FGF signaling inhibits chondrocyte proliferation, a cell type-specific response that is the basis for several genetic skeletal disorders caused by activating FGFR mutations. This phenomenon requires the function of the p107 and p130 members of the Rb protein family, and p107 dephosphorylation is one of the earliest distinguishing events in FGF-induced growth arrest. To determine whether p107 dephoshorylation played a critical role in the chondrocyte response to FGF, we sought to counteract this process by overexpressing in RCS chondrocytes the cyclin D1/cdk4 kinase complex. CyclinD/cdk4-expressing RCS cells became resistant to FGF-induced p107 dephosphorylation and growth arrest, and maintained significantly high levels of cyclin E/cdk2 activity and of phosphorylated p130 at later times of FGF treatment. We explored the involvement of a phosphatase in p107 dephosphorylation. Expression of the SV40 small T-Ag, which inhibits the activity of the PP2A phosphatase, or knockdown of the expression of the PP2A catalytic subunit by RNA interference prevented p107 dephosphorylation and FGF-induced growth arrest of RCS cells. Furthermore, an association between p107 and PP2A was induced by FGF treatment. Our data show that p107 dephosphorylation is a key event in FGF-induced cell cycle arrest and indicate that in chondrocytes FGF activates the PP2A phosphatase to promote p107 dephosphorylation."

In higher eukaryotes, soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs) of the vesicle-associated membrane protein and syntaxin families play essential roles in these processes. In this work we identified and characterized genes for 17 SNAREs in Giardia to define the minimal set of subcellular organelles present during growth and encystation, in particular the presence or not of a Golgi apparatus. Expression and localization of all Giardia SNAREs demonstrate their presence in distinct subcellular compartments, which may represent the extent of the endomembrane system in eukaryotes. Remarkably, Giardia SNAREs, homologous to Golgi SNAREs from other organisms, do not allow the detection of a typical Golgi apparatus in either proliferating or differentiating trophozoites. However, some features of the Golgi, such as the packaging and sorting function, seem to be performed by the endoplasmic reticulum and/or the nuclear envelope. Moreover, depletion of individual genes demonstrated that several SNAREs are essential for viability, whereas others are dispensable. Thus, Giardia requires a smaller number of SNAREs compared with other eukaryotes to accomplish all of the vesicle trafficking events that are critical for the growth and differentiation of this important human pathogen.

Giardia, which is considered one of the most ancient eukaryotes, is a flagellated, binucleated protozoan that parasitizes the upper small intestine of an extensive variety of vertebrate hosts (1Morrison H.G.

Giardia has a simple life cycle alternating between disease-causing trophozoites and environmentally resistant cysts, which are responsible for transmission of the parasite among susceptible hosts (2Adam R.D. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 14: 447-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). The typical Golgi apparatus of most eukaryotic organisms consists of a number of flattened cisternae arranged in a stack, which functions as the protein delivery center of the cell and performs multiple modifications of lipids and proteins (3Tamaki H. Yamashina S. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2002; 50: 1611-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).

Recently, the completion of the Giardia genome project (1Morrison H.G. McArthur A.G. Gillin F.D. Aley S.B. Adam R.D. Olsen G.J. Best A.A. Cande W.Z. Chen F. Cipriano M.J. Davids B.J. Dawson S.C.

Unfortunately, similar to other anaerobic organisms, chimeras using fluorescent proteins cannot be used to study the dynamics of the secretory pathway of Giardia (22Regoes A. Hehl A.B. BioTechniques. 2005; 39: 809-810, 812Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and therefore little is known about the processes of vesicle transport and membrane fusion in this parasite. Intracellular membrane fusion is a complex and multistage process essential for cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation. Both homotypic and heterotypic fusion of intracellular membranes along the secretory and endocytic pathways are mediated by a family of proteins called SNAREs (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors) (23Ungar D. Hughson F.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 493-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). These proteins mediate vesicle fusion in essentially all organisms from yeast to human (24Ferro-Novick S. Jahn R. Nature. 1994; 370: 191-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). SNAREs share α-helical coiled-coil domains, called SNARE motifs, that probably evolved from a common ancestor and are composed of a hydrophobic heptad repeat (25Weimbs T. Mostov K. Low S.H. Hofmann K. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 260-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) interrupted at a central interface (termed the zero layer) by a conserved arginine or glutamine polar residue (26Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar). Depending on whether arginine or glutamine is present at this position, the SNAREs are referred to as R- or Q-SNAREs (27Fasshauer D. Eliason W.K. Brunger A.T. Jahn R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10354-10362Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In addition, they are categorized as v- or t-SNAREs, depending on their localization to either the transport vesicle (v) or the target (t) membrane (23Ungar D. Hughson F.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 493-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Originally, it was assumed that there was a strict separation between SNAREs on the “donor” compartment and the “acceptor” compartment. However, this terminology is not useful in describing homotypic fusion events and certain SNARE functions in several transport steps with varying partners (28Jahn R. Scheller R.H. Nat Rev Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 7: 631-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1942) Google Scholar). Functional analysis of these proteins in higher eukaryotes has led to the “SNARE hypothesis,” which states that interactions between R-SNAREs and Q-SNAREs mediate vesicle fusion with target membranes (29Rothman J.E. Warren G. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 220-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Specific R-SNAREs will oligomerize productively only with a limited number of Q-SNAREs (28Jahn R. Scheller R.H. Nat Rev Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 7: 631-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1942) Google Scholar). Such restricted interaction of SNARE proteins is thought to form the basis for specificity of vesicle targeting. SNARE-mediated fusion typically results from the formation of a complex that comprises a supercoil of four α-helical coils, consisting of one R-SNARE and three Q-SNARE motifs (26Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar). In this context, Q-SNAREs can be subdivided into QaSNAREs (syntaxins), Qb-SNAREs (25-kDa synaptosomal-associated protein (SNAP-25) N-terminal SNARE motif), and Qc-SNAREs (SNAP-25 C-terminal SNARE motif) (30Bock J.B. Matern H.T. Peden A.A. Scheller R.H. Nature. 2001; 409: 839-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). The R-SNAREs also can be subdivided into short VAMPs (vesicle-associated membrane proteins), or “brevins” (e.g. synaptobrevin), and long VAMPs, or “longins,” on the basis of whether they contain a short and variable domain or a conserved longin domain of 120-140 amino acids at their N termini (31Filippini F. Rossi V. Galli T. Budillon A. D'Urso M. D'Esposito M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 407-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). SNARE complexes may be assembled from three or four proteins (SNAP-25 homologs typically contribute two helices), and the complete complex is a four-helix bundle composed of one helix from each sequence family, Qa, Qb, Qc, and R (24Ferro-Novick S. Jahn R. Nature. 1994; 370: 191-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Like Q-SNAREs, R-SNAREs can include transmembrane domains or can be covalently anchored to a lipid at conserved cysteine residues (31Filippini F. Rossi V. Galli T. Budillon A. D'Urso M. D'Esposito M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 407-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Indeed, a phylogenetic analysis of SNARE sequences from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Arabidopsis thaliana, some protozoa, and mammals shows that these four SNARE subfamilies are highly conserved and diverged early in eukaryotic evolution (21Kloepper T.H. Kienle C.N. Fasshauer D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 3463-3471Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Because Giardia is an early divergent eukaryote (1Morrison H.G. McArthur A.G. Gillin F.D. Aley S.B. Adam R.D. Olsen G.J. Best A.A. Cande W.Z. Chen F. Cipriano M.J. Davids B.J. Dawson S.C. Elmendorf H.G. Hehl A.B. Holder M.E. Huse S.M. Kim U.U. Lasek-Nesselquist E. Manning G. Nigam A.

Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 14: 447-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar), the study of the organization of membrane compartments and membrane fusion processes in this organism may allow a better understanding of the evolution of transport pathways from primitive to higher eukaryotes. In addition, because of their parasitic life style, Giardia is an interesting system in which to analyze how microorganisms could have lost complex organelles and, therefore, to illuminate the minimal set of organelles needed for a given cellular function. For these reasons, the aim of the present work was to identify and characterize the complete set of SNARE proteins in Giardia to define the minimal set of subcellular compartments present during growth and encystation, in particular the existence or not of a typical Golgi apparatus. Our results suggest that gSNAREs are functional and distinctively localized to known subcellular compartments, suggesting a role in regulating membrane trafficking to and from these organelles. Surprisingly, a comparison of Giardia SNAREs homologous to Golgi SNAREs from other organisms does not allow the detection of a typical Golgi apparatus in either proliferating or differentiating trophozoites.

In this way, each SNARE gene was inserted inside the PtubHApac N terminus inversely, thus generating each SNARE antisense vector.

The cells were fixed with 4! paraformaldehyde and permeabilized for 1 h at room temperature in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1! Triton X-100, 10! goat serum. The cells then were incubated with the antibodies diluted in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1! Triton X-100, 3! goat serum. For indirect staining, slides were incubated with the specific mAbs (final dilution 1:200) or anti-hemagglutinin (HA) mAb (Sigma-Aldrich, final dilution 1:1000) for 1 h at 37 °C and then with anti-mouse secondary antibody labeled with FITC (final dilution 1:250) for 1 h at 37 °C. For direct double staining, anti-HA mAb FITC (Sigma-Aldrich, final dilution 1:500) was used to detect the transgenic proteins; 9C9, 5B11, 5C1, and 7D2 mAbs were labeled directly with Texas Red (Zenon One, Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) for the detection of BiP, PVs, VSP1267, and the endogenous CWP2, respectively. Controls included the omission of primary antibodies and staining of cells transfected with the empty vector. Confocal images were collected using a Zeiss LSM5 Pascal laser-scanning confocal microscope equipped with an argon/helium/neon laser and an ×100 1.4 NA oil immersion objective (Zeiss Plan-Apochromat). Single confocal sections (0.3 μm) were taken parallel to the coverslip (xy sections).

To determine whether the genes coding for gSNARE proteins were transcribed, we isolated total RNA from Giardia non-encysting trophozoites using TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Samples then were treated with RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega) to remove contaminating DNA. After one phenol-chloroform extraction, RNA was precipitated, and 5 μg was used to synthesize first-strand cDNA with SuperScript™ III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and PolyT primer following the manufacturer's instructions. One-tenth of the final material was used as a template for separate quantitative real-time PCR reactions with Quantitect™ SYBR® Green PCR (Qiagen) using the Chromo 4 real-time PCR detector. The same primers used in gSNARE antisense silencing were used to amplify fragments 100-500 pb in length. A negative control contained all reagents except the cDNA (RNA was included instead). One positive control was also used, the constitutively expressed gene gdh (GenBank™ accession number M84604) (58Yee J. Dennis P.P. J. Biol.

However, the recent identification of new members of the iPLA2 family, each inhibitable by (E)-6-(bromomethylene)-3-(1-naphthalenyl)-2H-tetrahydropyran-2-one, has rendered definitive identification of the specific enzyme(s) mediating these processes difficult. Accordingly, we used iPLA2β–/– mice to demonstrate that iPLA2β is responsible for the majority of thapsigargin and ionophore (A23187)-induced arachidonic acid release from SMCs. Both thapsigargin and A23187 stimulated robust [3H]arachidonate (AA) release from wild-type aortic SMCs that was dramatically attenuated in iPLA2β–/– mice (>80% reduction at 5 min; p < 0.01). Moreover, iPLA2β–/– mice displayed defects in SMC Ca2+ homeostasis and decreased SMC migration and proliferation in a model of vascular injury. Ca2+-store depletion resulted in the rapid entry of external Ca2+ into wild-type aortic SMCs that was significantly slower in iPLA2β-null cells (p < 0.01). Furthermore, SMCs from iPLA2β-null mesenteric arterial explants demonstrated decreased proliferation and migration. The defects in migration and proliferation in iPLA2β-null SMCs were restored by 2 μm AA. Remarkably, the cyclooxygenase-2-specific inhibitor, NS-398, prevented AA-induced rescue of SMC migration and proliferation in iPLA2β–/– mice. Moreover, PGE2 alone rescued proliferation and migration in iPLA2β–/– mice. We conclude that iPLA2β is an important mediator of AA release and prostaglandin E2 production in SMCs, modulating vascular tone, cellular signaling, proliferation, and migration.

Biol. 2001; 67: 1-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Both reaction products as well as their downstream metabolites possess potent biologic regulatory functions (3Khanapure S.P. Garvey D.S. Janero D.R. Letts L.G. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2007; 7: 311-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 4Yedgar S. Cohen Y. Shoseyov D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1761: 1373-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Thus, members of the PLA2 family initiate dual signaling pathways emanating from a single hydrolytic reaction. For example, AA can be converted to multiple eicosanoid products (e.g. prostaglandins, thromboxanes, leukotrienes, and epoxytrienes) (3Khanapure S.P. Garvey D.S. Janero D.R. Letts L.G. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2007; 7: 311-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), whereas lysophospholipids alter membrane dynamics modulating the activity of many transmembrane enzymes, regulate the electrophysiologic properties of multiple ion channels, and serve as metabolic nodes in signaling pathways (e.g. production of 2-arachidonoyl glycerol or AA from 2-arachidonoyl lysophosphatidylcholine) (5Fink K.L. Gross R.W. Circ. Res. 1984; 55: 585-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 6Yan W. Jenkins C.M. Han X. Mancuso D.J. Sims H.F. Yang K. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26669-26679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Furthermore, both eicosanoids and lysolipids interact with a diverse array of cellular receptors further amplifying the repertoire of biologic responses initiated by phospholipase A2 activity (7Ulven T. Kostenis E. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2006; 6: 1427-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 8Thompson M.D. Takasaki J. Capra V. Rovati G.E. Siminovitch K.A. Burnham W.M. Hudson T.J. Bosse Y.

Cell Signal. 2005; 17: 1466-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Because many eicosanoids and lysolipids mediate alterations in vascular tone and inflammatory responses, the development of compounds that modulate their production has been an important pharmacologic objective. To this end, substantial efforts have focused on identifying the different types of phospholipases that contribute to eicosanoid production and cellular signaling. The family of phospholipases A2 can be divided into four distinct subfamilies: secretory (sPLA2), platelet-activating factor-acetylhydrolase, cytosolic (cPLA2), and calcium-independent phospholipase A2 (iPLA2). The platelet-activating factor-acetylhydrolase PLA2 family exhibits substrate specificity for platelet-activating factor and oxidized phospholipids, whereas sPLA2s are low molecular weight enzymes that require millimolar calcium ion concentrations for catalysis (10Schaloske R.H. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1761: 1246-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). As the first intracellular phospholipase demonstrated to hydrolyze phospholipids at physiologic increments of intracellular Ca2+ concentrations (11Loeb L.A. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10467-10470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cPLA2α also preferentially hydrolyzes phospholipids containing AA at the sn-2 position (12Alonso F. Henson P.M. Leslie C.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 878: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), translocates to membrane bilayers during cellular activation (13Glover S. de Carvalho M.S. Bayburt T. Jonas M.

In addition, iPLA2s are inhibited by low micromolar concentrations of the suicide substrate (E)-6-(bromomethylene)-3-(1-naphthalenyl)-2H-tetrahydropyran-2-one (BEL) that does not inhibit phospholipid hydrolysis by sPLA2 or cPLA2 family members (20Hazen S.L.

Recent in silico studies have theorized that the large majority of the intracellular serine lipases, including the cPLA2 and iPLA2 family members, likely originated from a common ancestral precursor that has a conserved structural motif containing three β-strands juxtaposed to an α-helix comprising a Walker motif that binds purine nucleotides (22Schneider G. Neuberger G. Wildpaner M. Tian S. Berezovsky I. Eisenhaber F. BMC Bioinformatics. 2006; 7: 164Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Within the calcium-independent phospholipase A2 family, only iPLA2β has been demonstrated to be regulated by purine-containing cofactors (i.e. ATP and acyl-CoA), implicating its importance in the integration of cellular lipid metabolism, signaling, and energy utilization (23Hazen S.L. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14526-14534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Jenkins C.M. Yan W. Mancuso D.J. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15615-15624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Early studies of intracellular iPLA2s identified a novel PLA2 activity in myocardial cytosol that was inhibited by Ca2+, although Ca2+ did not directly affect the activity of the purified enzyme (16Wolf R.A. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7295-7303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Hazen S.L. Stuppy R.J. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10622-10630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This activity was subsequently demonstrated to be mediated by iPLA2β (18Wolf M.J. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30879-30885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 19Tang J. Kriz R.W. Wolfman N. Shaffer M. Seehra J. Jones S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8567-8575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The Ca2+-dependent cytosolic inhibitor of iPLA2β was identified as calmodulin (CaM) (25Wolf M.J. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20989-20992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), which binds to iPLA2β using canonical 1-9-14 and IQ CaM binding motifs near the C terminus of the enzyme (26Jenkins C.M. Wolf M.J. Mancuso D.J. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7129-7135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The physiologic importance of the regulation by Ca2+ and CaM was demonstrated by the finding that release of AA from vascular smooth muscle cell phospholipids can be induced by CaM antagonists (25Wolf M.J. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20989-20992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In previous work, we demonstrated that BEL inhibits both thapsigargin (TG) and arginine vasopressin-induced release of AA from A-10 vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) by a mechanism that does not require an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration, but rather results from calcium pool depletion and subsequent activation of iPLA2β through the release of calmodulin-mediated inhibition (27Wolf M.J. Wang J. Turk J. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1522-1526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We proposed that calcium store depletion-mediated activation of iPLA2β leads to the generation of lipid second messengers (eicosanoids and lysolipids) that activate capacitative calcium entry and recruit multiple downstream signaling pathways mediated by capacitative calcium influx (27Wolf M.J. Wang J. Turk J. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1522-1526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However, BEL has subsequently been found to inhibit many newly identified members of the iPLA2 family in addition to its known inhibition of some serine proteases (28Mancuso D.J. Jenkins C.M. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9937-9945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 29Jenkins C.M. Mancuso D.J. Yan W. Sims H.F. Gibson B. Gross R.W. J. Biol.

Chem. 1982; 257: 610-612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, to unambiguously identify the role of iPLA2β in the TG- or ionophore-mediated release of AA in SMCs, it was necessary to demonstrate that AA release could be inhibited by genetic ablation of iPLA2β. To this end, we have recently generated iPLA2β-null mice by homologous recombination (31Bao S. Miller D.J. Ma Z. Wohltmann M. Eng G. Ramanadham S. Moley K. Turk J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38194-38200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Mice null for iPLA2β exhibit several phenotypes, including male sterility resulting from decreased sperm motility, but alterations in AA release in these mice have not been previously examined (31Bao S.

In this report, we used iPLA2β–/– mice to unambiguously demonstrate the role of iPLA2β in SMC AA release in response to TG and ionophore stimulation and to identify alterations in SMC Ca2+ homeostasis, migration, and proliferation. We now report that iPLA2β is required for the release of AA during calcium pool depletion or ionophore stimulation in SMCs especially at early time points after stimulation and that the absence of iPLA2β alters Ca2+ signaling. Moreover, the absence of iPLA2β results in defects in mesenteric arterial SMC migration and proliferation, which were rescued through the addition of exogenous low micromolar amounts of AA and subsequently re-inhibited by the COX-2-specific inhibitor NS-398. Materials—Reagents and media for cell culture were obtained from Invitrogen. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), buffer salts, recombinant rat platelet-derived growth factor-BB, and poly-l-lysine solution (0.01%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co.

Enantiomers of BEL were resolved and purified by high-performance liquid chromatography utilizing a Chirex column of 3,5-dinitrobenzoyl-(R)-phenylglycine attached to a silica matrix as previously described (32Jenkins C.M. Han X. Mancuso D.J. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32807-32814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). 1-Oleoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (LPA) was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids. The LPA receptor antagonist, 1-bromo-3(S)-hydroxy-4-(palmitoyloxy)butyl phosphonate (BrP-LPA), was obtained from Echelon Biosciences (Salt Lake City, UT). [5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15-3H]AA was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Other materials for Western blotting analyses, including primary monoclonal antibodies against α-actin and cPLA2α (to quantify total cPLA2α (residues 1–216)), polyclonal antibody against phosphorylated cPLA2α at Ser-505, and peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG, were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. and GE Biosciences. PCR reagents were obtained from Applied Biosystems and Qiagen, Inc. Isolation and Culture of Mouse SMCs—All animal studies were approved by the Washington University Animal Studies Committee. Aortic and mesenteric arterial SMCs were isolated from wild-type and iPLA2β-null mice essentially using minor modifications of a previously described method (33Dubey R.K. Overbeck H.W. Cell Tissue Res. 1994; 275: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 34Sun X. Kaltenbronn K.M. Steinberg T.H. Blumer K.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 631-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Briefly, to isolate mesenteric arterial SMCs, the subxiphoid abdominal region of asphyxiated mice (age 10–14 weeks) was incised, and the mesenteric arcade was exposed. Mesenteric arteries (∼100-μm diameter) were separated after removing fatty tissues under stereomicroscopic visualization. Exposed arterioles were excised and placed in a culture dish containing DMEM, and residual fatty tissue attached to the isolated arterioles was removed. The lumen of the arteriole was gently compressed and scraped with tweezers to remove blood clots and to remove the endothelium. Micro-dissected tissue sections were placed on 35-mm poly-l-lysine (0.01%)-coated tissue culture dishes, and the sections were covered with poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips and incubated in DMEM/F-12 (1:1) medium containing 2 mm glutamine, 1% antibiotic/antimycotic supplement, 20% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, and platelet-derived growth factor-BB (20 ng/ml) under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. To isolate aortic SMCs, excised aortae were scraped to remove blood clots and adventitia. The aortae were incised longitudinally, and the inner surface was scraped to remove the endothelium. Aortic SMCs were cultured as described above for mesenteric arterial SMCs. Confluent primary cells were detached from the plates with 0.25% Trypsin/EDTA. All experiments were conducted using primary and first passage cells. Migration and Proliferation of Mouse Smooth Muscle Cells—Mesenteric arterial SMCs were isolated from wild-type and iPLA2β-null mice, and the primary cells were cultured in the presence of 2 μm AA, 2 μm lysophosphatidic acid, 20 μm non-selective COX inhibitor indomethacin, 10 μm COX-2-specific inhibitor NS-398, 5 μm PGE2, 10 μm BrP-LPA, or vehicle alone in the culture medium, which was changed every 2 days. In some experiments, AA and PGE2 were added to cells incubated with the COX-2 inhibitor NS-398. Images of cells were obtained by using a Zeiss inverted digital microscope (10× air objective), and the number of migrating/proliferating cells was counted (at 21 days post-isolation). The path-independent migration distance of each cell from the nearest explant edge was determined by Intelligent Imaging Innovations software. Analyses of iPLA2β mRNA Expression by Aortic SMCs by Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from first passage subcultured aortic SMCs using RNA-STAT-60™ (Tel-Test, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and cDNA was prepared using a TaqMan® Reverse Transcription PCR kit. The following iPLA2β-specific primers were used: F1, 5′-CTGCAGAATTCCATGTCGAAAGATAACATGGAG-3′; R1, 5′-CCGAAGCGGCCGCTCCTTCATACGGAAGTACAC-3′; F2, 5′-ATGATTATCAGCATGGACAGCA-3′; and R2, 5′-ACACAGGTTACAGGCACTTGAGG-3′. PCR was performed for 30 cycles of 53 °C (30 s), 72 °C (2 min), and 94 °C (30 s), and products were analyzed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. The F1–R1, F2–R1, and F1–R2 primer sets generated predicted amplification products of 431, 683, and 898 bp, respectively, from wild-type template. Quantitative PCR—Quantitative PCR was performed as previously described (35Mancuso D.J. Jenkins C.M. Sims H.F. Cohen J.M. Yang J. Gross R.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 4709-4724Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The following mouse forward and reverse primers and probes, respectively, were purchased from Applied Biosystems: iPLA2γ:5′-GAGGAGAAAAAGCGTGTGCTACTTC-3′, 5′-GGTTGTTCTTCTTAAGGCCTGAA-3′, and 5′-TCTGTTATCAATACTCACTCTTGCAATA-3′; iPLA2β:5′-CCTTCCATTACGCTGTGCAA-3′, 5′-GAGTCAGCCCTTGGTTGTT-3′, and 5′-CCAGGTGCTACAGCTCCTAGGAAAGAATGC-3′; and cPLA2α:5′-CCTTTGAGTTCATTTTGGATCCTAA-3′, 5′-TGTAGCTGTGCCTAGGGTTTCAT-3′, and 5′-AGGAAAATGTTTTGGAGATCACACTGATGGATG-3′. PCR, in triplicate, utilized the following conditions: 2 min at 50 °C and 10 min at 95 °C, followed by a total of 40 two-temperature cycles (15 s at 95 °C and 1 min at 60 °C). Relative mRNA levels were normalized to ribosome RNA as internal standard. [3H]AA Release—Aortic SMCs at 70% confluency in 12-well plates were labeled with [3H]AA (1 μCi per dish, for 20 h) and washed with DMEM/F-12 medium containing 0.25% (2.5 mg/ml) fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, followed by two more washes with DMEM/F-12 medium alone (with no fetal bovine serum and platelet-derived growth factor-BB). For the PLA2 inhibition experiments, cells were pretreated with either the iPLA2 inhibitor BEL or the pyrrolidine cPLA2α inhibitor Pyr. Cells were then incubated in culture medium (2 ml) without platelet-derived growth factor-BB that contained TG (1 μm), ionophore A23187 (10 μm), or vehicle (0.1%, v/v DMSO) alone. For some experiments, aortic SMCs were washed with media containing EGTA (final concentration, 3 mm) to chelate extracellular Ca2+ prior to agonist stimulation in EGTA-containing media. After 5 or 10 min, the medium (1 ml) was removed and lipids were extracted into 2 ml of chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (50/48/2, v/v). Lipids extracted into the CHCl3 layer were resolved by TLC using petroleum ether/ethyl ether/glacial acetic acid (70/30/1, v/v) with oleic acid as fatty acid standard as previously described (32Jenkins C.M. Han X. Mancuso D.J. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32807-32814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Regions containing fatty acids were identified with iodine vapor and scraped into vials, and the [3H]AA content was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The cells were scraped into lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin), and smooth muscle α-actin (∼43 kDa) was determined by ECL immunoblotting following SDS-PAGE to normalize [3H]AA release relative to the intensity of the immunoreactive α-actin band determined utilizing a Kodak Image Station 440 CF. For determination of COX-2, total cPLA2α and phosphorylated (Ser-505) cPLA2α protein expression levels in wild-type and iPLA2β–/– aortic SMCs, aliquots of cell lysates were loaded and resolved by SDS-PAGE gel (100 μg of protein/lane) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes that were probed with either a monoclonal IgG1 COX-2 antibody, a monoclonal IgG2b cPLA2α antibody (directed against residues 1–216), or a polyclonal antibody to cPLA2α phosphoserine-505. The polyvinylidene difluoride blots were then incubated with peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG or protein A, detected by ECL, and quantified using a Kodak Image Station. Measurement of Intracellular Ca2+ Concentration—Isolated vascular SMCs were grown in optical dishes (Bioptechs, Inc.) to ∼70% confluency. After washing twice with buffer (130 mm NaCl, 4.8 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2 6H2O, 17 mm HEPES, 11 mm glucose, 20 mm NaHCO3, 1.8 mm CaCl2, pH 7.3), the cells were incubated in the presence or absence of AACOCF3 (25 μm) for 1 h, or BEL or cPLA2α inhibitor Pyr at the indicated concentrations for 10 min at 37 °C after preincubation (90 min, in the dark) of the cells in buffer containing Fura-2/AM (final concentration, 5 μm) dissolved in DMSO containing Pluronic F-127 (final concentration, 0.02%). Cells were rinsed with Ca2+-free buffer that contained 200 μm EGTA to remove Ca2+ and residual Fura-2/AM. Fresh Ca2+-free buffer was placed in the dishes and allowed to equilibrate with the cells for 10 min prior to taking fluorescence measurements. The dishes were mounted on the stage of a Zeiss inverted digital microscope (40× air objective) equipped with Intelligent Imaging Innovations software and illuminated alternately at excitation wavelengths of 340 nm and 380 nm, followed by emission measurements at 510 nm. Thapsigargin (1 μm) was added to the cells at the times indicated in the figures, and intracellular [Ca2+] was presented as the ratio (F340/F380) of light emitted at 510 nm after excitation at 340 nm and 380 nm, respectively. Ca2+ was re-introduced into the medium of TG-treated cells at the indicated time to achieve a final concentration of 1.8 mm. PGE2 Immunoassay—First passage, subcultured, confluent aortic SMCs obtained from wild-type mice were washed with DMEM alone and incubated with culture medium (10% fetal bovine serum) containing TG (1 μm), ionophore A23187 (10 μm), or vehicle alone for 5 or 10 min. The medium was collected and diluted 10-fold in assay buffer, and the quantity of PGE2 was determined by immunoassay according to the manufacturer's instructions. Statistical Analyses—Values are expressed as means ± S.E. The significance of experimental observations was determined using a Student's t test for unpaired data. Results were considered significant at the p < 0.05 level. AA Release from Mouse Vascular SMCs Induced by TG or Ionophore (A23187) Is Markedly Attenuated in iPLA2β–/– Mice—To ensure that the tissues used in the experiments using wild-type and iPLA2β–/– mice contained and lacked iPLA2β, respectively, we performed quantitative PCR analyses on vascular SMC mRNA corresponding to three distinct regions of the iPLA2β coding sequence. As anticipated, each primer set yielded products of the expected sizes with RNA from wild-type aortic SMCs (lanes 2, 5, and 8), but not with iPLA2β-null aortic SMC RNA as template for reverse transcription-PCR (lanes 3, 6, and 9) (Fig. 1A). These results demonstrate the presence of iPLA2β in wild-type SMCs and substantiate the genetic knockout of iPLA2β in the animals used in this study that is consistent with previous reports using this mouse line (31Bao S.

Treatment of wild-type vascular aortic SMCs with either TG or calcium ionophore A23187 induces the robust hydrolysis of esterified AA from cellular phospholipids. However, the relative contributions of different PLA2s to this process and their distinct roles in vascular SMC biology remain poorly understood. Accordingly, we examined the effect of genetic ablation of iPLA2β on [3H]AA release from aortic SMCs prelabeled with [3H]AA. Treatment of wild-type (WT) aortic SMCs with TG or A23187 for 5 min resulted in the robust release of [3H]AA in comparison to vehicle alone (4.6 ± 0.5-fold and 4.7 ± 0.3-fold increases, respectively; Fig. 1, B and C). In marked contrast, TG and ionophore-induced [3H]AA release from iPLA2β-null (KO) cells was nearly abolished regardless of which parameter was used for comparison (i.e. the amount of [3H]AA release normalized to α-actin or the fractional percentage of [3H]AA release to radiolabeled phospholipids; Fig. 1, B and C). Specifically, essentially no [3H]AA above control levels was released from iPLA2β-null vascular SMCs treated with TG and only minimal release (<20%) occurred after ionophore treatment (A23187) for 5 min (Fig. 1, B and C). There was no significant difference in the amount of [3H]AA incorporated into wild-type aortic SMCs in comparison to that incorporated into cells from iPLA2β–/– animals (mean incorporation of [3H]AA into wild-type and iPLA2β-null aortic SMCs after 20-h incubation with 1 μCi of [3H]AA was ∼0.089 μCi and ∼0.085 μCi per dish, respectively). In similar experiments performed with wild-type and iPLA2β-null aortic SMCs radiolabeled with [3H]oleic acid, neither TG nor ionophore induced significant oleic acid release despite ro"

Here we show that dendritic cells also express the Cav1.2 subunit of the L-type Ca2+ channel and that release of intracellular Ca2+ via RyR1 depends on the presence of extracellular Ca2+ and is sensitive to ryanodine and nifedipine. Interestingly, RyR1 activation causes a very rapid increase in expression of major histocompatibility complex II molecules on the surface of dendritic cells, an effect that is also observed upon incubation of mouse BM12 dendritic cells with transgenic T cells whose T cell receptor is specific for the I-Abm12 protein. Based on the present results, we suggest that activation of the RyR1 signaling cascade may be important in the early stages of infection, providing the immune system with a rapid mechanism to initiate an early response, facilitating the presentation of antigens to T cells by dendritic cells before their full maturation.

Ca2+ signals regulate a variety of functions in eukaryotic cells from muscle contraction and neuronal excitability to gene transcription, cell proliferation, and cell death. To efficiently utilize Ca2+ as a second messenger, cells are equipped with an essential toolbox kit composed of a variety of proteins that allow Ca2+ ions to flow into the cytoplasm and be removed from the cytoplasm, proteins that store/buffer Ca2+ in intracellular organelles, and proteins acting as sensors for intracellular Ca2+ levels as well as Ca2+-regulated enzymes (1.Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Berridge M. Bootman M.D. Roderick H.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4090) Google Scholar). In both excitable and non-excitable cells, generation of an intracellular Ca2+ transient is due to the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores via inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate or ryanodine receptors (RyRs) 2The abbreviations used are: RyR, ryanodine receptor; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; [Ca2+]i, intracellular calcium concentration; DC, dendritic cell; iDC, immature DC; DHPR, dihydropyridine receptor; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; bis-oxonol, bis-(1,3-diethylthiobarbiturate)-trimethineoxonal; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PE, phycoerythrin; Abs, antibody; HLA, human leukocyte antigens; ABM, anti-BM12.2The abbreviations used are: RyR, ryanodine receptor; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; [Ca2+]i, intracellular calcium concentration; DC, dendritic cell; iDC, immature DC; DHPR, dihydropyridine receptor; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; bis-oxonol, bis-(1,3-diethylthiobarbiturate)-trimethineoxonal; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PE, phycoerythrin; Abs, antibody; HLA, human leukocyte antigens; ABM, anti-BM12. present on the endoplasmic (ER)/sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes and opening of Ca2+ channels present on the plasma membrane. Both the amplitude and the frequency of the Ca2+ signal can be sensed by specific proteins allowing a cell to respond appropriately to signals, which apparently only give rise to an increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i). In general, non-excitable cells are endowed with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors which open in response to the generation of the receptor coupled second messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, allowing Ca2+ to flow out of the ER. On the other hand, excitable cells, which need to respond to signals within milliseconds, are equipped with RyR Ca2+ channels (1.Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Regulation of the latter class of proteins is not mediated by the generation of a second messenger but rather through coupling with another protein component present on the plasma membrane, the l-type Ca2+ channel (3.Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 521-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1914) Google Scholar). In fact, in cardiac and skeletal muscles, signaling to the RyR is coupled to the dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) L-type Ca2+ channels, which sense changes in membrane potential thereby activating Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. L-type Ca2+ channels are composed of an α1 subunit (Cav), which spans the membrane and contains the pore region, and the four additional subunits β1, α2, γ, and δ. There are at least four genes encoding the α1 subunits (Cav1.1-Cav1.4), and all mediate L-type Ca2+ currents, although their products are preferentially expressed in different tissues/subcellular locations (3.Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 521-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1914) Google Scholar, 4.Catterall W.A. Perez-Reyes E. Snutch T.P. Striessnig J. Pharmacol. Rev. 2005; 57: 411-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). Cav1.1 is localized in the transverse tubules and is involved in skeletal muscle excitation-contraction coupling; Cav1.2 is expressed in cardiac and smooth muscle cells, endocrine cells, and pancreatic β cells as well as in neuronal cell bodies and is involved in cardiac excitation-contraction coupling, hormone release, transcription regulation, and synaptic integration. Cav1.3 and Cav1.4 have a more widespread distribution, including neuronal cell bodies, dendrites, pancreatic β cells, cochlear hair cells, adrenal gland, and mast cells where they are involved in hormone/neurotransmitter release, regulation of transcription, and synaptic regulation (4.Catterall W.A. Perez-Reyes E. Snutch T.P. Striessnig J. Pharmacol. Rev. 2005; 57: 411-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). Ryanodine receptors belong to a family of intracellular Ca2+ release channels composed of at least three different isoforms that have been characterized extensively biochemically, functionally, and at the molecular level (5.Sutko J.L. Airey J.A. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1027-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 6.Franzini-Armstrong C. Protasi F. Physiol.

Type 1 RyRs are encoded by a gene on human chromosome 19 and are mainly expressed in skeletal muscle and to a lower extent in Purkinje cells. Mutations in this gene are associated with the rare neuromuscular disorders malignant hyperthermia, central core disease, and some forms of multiminicore disease (8.Treves S. Anderson A.A. Ducreux S.

Mutations in its gene are associated with genetic variants of congestive heart failure, namely catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (10.Wehrens X.H. Marks A.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 671-678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 11.George C.H. Jundi H. Thomas N.L. Fry D.L. Lai F.A. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2007; 42: 34-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Type 3 RyRs are expressed in a variety of excitable tissues as well as in immature muscle cells (12.Tarroni P. Rossi D. Conti A. Sorrentino V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19808-19813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Recent reports have demonstrated that type 1 RyRs are also expressed in some cells of the immune system (13.Hosoi E. Nishizaki C. Gallagher K.L. Wyre H.W. Matsuo Y. Sei Y. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 4887-4894Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), particularly B-lymphocytes and dendritic cells (DCs) where their pharmacological activation gives rise to a rapid and transient increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration (14.O'Connell P.J.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 362: 510-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Although both B-lymphocytes and DCs can act as antigen presenting cells and initiate T cell-driven immune responses (20.Trombetta S.E. Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 23: 975-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar), DCs play a central role in the immune system; they are strategically located in peripheral tissues where they continuously sample their environment for the presence of antigens. Upon encounter with microbial products or tissue debris, immature DCs (iDCs) stop endocytosing, undergo maturation, and become the most potent antigen presenting cells known. Mature DCs up-regulate co-stimulatory molecules and antigen-presenting molecules, transcribe mRNA for specific cytokines, and migrate to secondary lymphoid organs where they interact with naïve T cells to initiate specific immune responses (21.Lanzavecchia A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 348-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Complete maturation of DCs is thought to require at least 10–20 h (22.Cella M. Engering A. Pinet V. Pieters J. Lanzavecchia A. Nature. 1997; 388: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar, 23.Dauer M. Obermaier B. Herten J. Haerle C. Pohl K. Rothenfusser S. Schnurr M. Endres S. Eigler A. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 4069-4076Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The involvement of Ca2+ signaling events in DC maturation had been postulated for a number of years, but only recently was it demonstrated that RyR1-mediated Ca2+ signals can act synergistically with signals generated via Toll-like receptors driving DC maturation (17.Bracci L. Vukcevic M. Spagnoli G. Ducreux S. Zorzato F. Treves S. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 2232-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 19.Uemura Y. Liu T.Y. Narita Y. Suzuki M. Ohshima S. Mizukami S. Ichihara Y. Kikuchi H. Matsushita S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 362: 510-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Experimentally, iDCs can be induced to undergo maturation by treatment with high (μm) concentrations of lipopolysaccharide. Physiologically, however, an inflamed region most likely contains a mixture of bacterial components, tissue and cellular debris, and other cellular components, including ions released from dying cells. Several questions emerge concerning the role(s) of RyRs in DCs. (i) Why do these cells utilize the rapid acting RyRs to achieve such a slow process such as maturation; are RyRs involved in other aspects of DC function? (ii) What is the physiological route of RyR1 activation in DCs? In skeletal muscle the Cav1.1 subunit of the DHPR L-type Ca2+ channel present on the transverse tubular membrane acts as a voltage sensor and interacts directly with the RyR1 to initiate Ca2+ release. Are DCs equipped with a similar signaling pathway? In the present report we show that DCs are endowed with a DHPR which is activated by membrane depolarization and triggers Ca2+ release via RyR1. More importantly we show that activation of this signaling pathway is both necessary and sufficient to cause the rapid release of an intracellular pool of MHC class II molecules onto the plasma membrane. We hypothesize that a such a rapid signaling machinery may be important under specific conditions, namely in the very early phases of an immune response when T cells and iDCs may become intimately connected; engagement of T cell receptors with the MHC class II molecules on the surface of iDCs rapidly activates T cells to release factors stimulating an increase in the level of expression of MHC class II molecules on the surface of iDCs, possibly supporting very early activation steps of T cells. Isolation and Generation of Dendritic Cells—Human iDCs were generated from peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes as previously described (17.Bracci L. Vukcevic M. Spagnoli G. Ducreux S. Zorzato F.

Sorted monocytes were cultured for the following 5 days in differentiation medium containing RPMI, 10% fetal calf serum, glutamine, nonessential amino acids, and antibiotics (Invitrogen) supplemented with 50 ng/ml granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (Laboratory Pablo Cassarà, Buenos Aires, Argentina) and 1000 units/ml interleukin 4 (a gift from A. Lanzavecchia, Bellinzona, Switzerland). Murine dendritic cells were isolated by positive sorting from spleens treated with collagenase D (1 mg/ml; Worthington Biotech; Lakewood, NJ) using anti-CD11c-coated magnetic MicroBeads according to the manufacturer's instructions (Miltenyi Biotech). The phenotype of cells was evaluated before experiments by flow cytometry using a FACSCalibur instrument equipped with Cell Quest software (BD Biosciences) as previously described (17.Bracci L. Vukcevic M. Spagnoli G. Ducreux S. Zorzato F. Treves S. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 2232-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Preparation of Necrotic Cell Extracts—Extracts were prepared essentially as described (17.Bracci L. Vukcevic M. Spagnoli G. Ducreux S. Zorzato F. Treves S. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 2232-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar); briefly, cultured HEK293 cells (1–1.5 × 107) were harvested, rinsed twice with PBS, resuspended in PBS, and subjected to 5 cycles of freeze-thawing. Viability was assessed by trypan blue exclusion and was <5%. Large cellular debris were removed by centrifugation, and their supernatant was filtered twice through a 0.22-μm Millipore filter and stored at -70 °C. Where indicated, extracts were dialyzed overnight at room temperature against PBS using a 3000 Da cut-off Spectrapore dialysis membrane (Spectrum Laboratories). Extracts were then centrifuged and filtered twice through 0.22-μm Millipore filters. Stimulation of iDC and CD83 Expression—In vitro derived iDCs were cultured for 4 h at 37 °C in the presence of 1 μg/ml LPS (from Salmonella abortus equi, Sigma) or in the presence of 1 ng/ml LPS supplemented with supernatants from necrotic cells. Briefly, necrotic cell extracts obtained from 1 × 107 cells (1.2 ml) were added to 0.8 × 106 iDCs cultured in 1 ml of differentiation medium plus 1 ng/ml LPS; when nifedipine or dantrolene were used iDCs were pretreated at 37 °C for 45 min in the dark with 10 μm nifedipine (Calbiochem) or 20 μm dantrolene (Sigma) before the addition of the necrotic extract. Cells were harvested, and surface expression of CD83 was investigated by flow cytometry using FITC-labeled anti-CD83 monoclonal antibodies (BD Pharmingen) on paraformaldehyde (1% in PBS) fixed cells. Single-cell Intracellular Ca2+ Measurements—Measurements were performed on fura-2 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR)-loaded iDCs. In some experiments fura-2 loading and incubation with 500 μm ryanodine (Calbiochem) were performed simultaneously. After loading, cells were rinsed once, resuspended in Krebs-Ringer medium and allowed to adhere to glass coverslips, which were then mounted onto a 37 °C thermostatted chamber that was continuously perfused with Krebs-Ringer medium containing 1 mm CaCl2. Individual cells were stimulated with the indicated agonist by way of a 12-way 100-mm diameter quartz micromanifold computer-controlled microperfuser (ALA Scientific, Westbury, NY) as previously described (15.Ducreux S. Zorzato F. Ferreiro A. Jungbluth H. Muntoni F. Monnier N. Müller C.R. Treves S. Biochem. J. 2006; 395: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Online (340 nm, 380 nm, and ratio) measurements were recorded using a fluorescent Axiovert S100 TV inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) equipped with a40× oil immersion Plan Neofluar objective (0.17 NA) and filters (BP 340/380, FT 425, BP 500/530) and attached to a Hamamatsu multiformat CCD camera. Cells were analyzed using an Openlab imaging system, and the average pixel value for each cell was measured at excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm, as previously described (15.Ducreux S. Zorzato F. Ferreiro A. Jungbluth H. Muntoni F. Monnier N. Müller C.R. Treves S. Biochem. J. 2006; 395: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Membrane Potential Measurements—Changes in membrane potential were assessed after the changes in fluorescence of the lipophilic dye bis-(1,3-diethylthiobarbiturate)-trimethineoxonal (bis-oxonol) as described by the manufacturer (Molecular Probes). iDCs (0.65 × 106 cells/ml) were rinsed, resuspended in PBS, and added to a cuvette containing 200 nm bis-oxonol in PBS. After allowing the dye to equilibrate, changes in fluorescence were monitored with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50 spectrofluorometer equipped with magnetic stirrer and thermostatted at 37 °C. Immunofluorescence Analysis—Immunofluorescence analysis was performed as indicated on methanol-fixed or methanol: acetone (1:1)-fixed iDCs using rabbit anti-Cav1.2 antibody (anti-CCAT, a gift from Natalia Gomez-Ospina and Prof. Ricardo Dolmetsch, Department of Neurobiology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford CA), goat anti-RyR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.), mouse anti-human HLA DR (Caltag Laboratories, Burlingame CA) followed by Alexa Fluor-488-conjugated chicken anti-rabbit IgG, Alexa Fluor-555-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG (Molecular Probes), or PE-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Southern Biotech). Fluorescence was visualized using a 100× Plan NEOFLUAR oil immersion objective (NA 1.3) mounted on a Zeiss Axiovert 100 as previously described (17.Bracci L. Vukcevic M. Spagnoli G. Ducreux S. Zorzato F. Treves S. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 2232-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting and Reverse Transcription PCR Analysis—For Western blots iDCs (1 × 107 cells) were washed 3 times with PBS, and the pellet was then resuspended in 500 μl of detergent extraction buffer containing 1% Nonidet, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, plus anti-proteases (EDTA-free, Roche Applied Science), passed through a 25-gauge needle, and incubated for 5 min at 95 °C. The solubilized proteins from 1 × 106 cells were loaded in each lane and separated on a 6% SDS-PAG. Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose, and the blots were probed with a rabbit anti-Cav1.2 antibody (1:2000) followed by peroxidase-conjugated protein G (1:50000. Fluka Biochemicals, Buchs, Switzerland). The immunopositive bands were visualized by autoradiography using the Super signal West Dura chemiluminescence kit from Thermo Scientific. Reverse transcription PCR was performed as previously described (15.Ducreux S. Zorzato F. Ferreiro A. Jungbluth H. Muntoni F. Monnier N. Müller C.R. Treves S. Biochem. J. 2006; 395: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from 8 × 106 iDCs using the ULTRASPEC RNA isolation system (Biotex Labs) and reverse-transcribed using a cDNA synthesis kit following the instructions provided by the manufacturer (Roche Applied Science). Approximately 100 ng of cDNA were used per PCR amplification using an Applied Biosystems 2720 thermal cycler. The following primers spanning exons 15–16 were used to amplify the Cav1.2 transcript: forward, 5′-AAA TTT CCCT GGG ACTG TTG; reverse, 5′-GGT TAT GCCC TCCC CTG. Such primers yield a DNA fragment of ∼300 bp when amplifying cDNA; amplification from genomic DNA would be highly unlikely under normal PCR conditions as the expected fragment is too large (∼2800 bp). Amplification conditions were 5 min at 95 °C followed by 35 cycles of 30 s annealing at 92 °C, 40 s extension at 50 °C, and 40 s denaturation at 72 °C followed by a final extension for 5 min at 72 °C using the 2.5× Master Mix Taq polymerase from Eppendorf. The products of the PCR reaction were separated on a 6% polyacrylamide gel, and the bands were visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Functional Properties of iDCs—Endocytosis was studied by incubating iDCs in RPMI medium containing FITC-labeled dextran (final concentration 0.5 mg/ml; Fluka Chemicals, Buchs, Switzerland) for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed in ice-cold PBS 2 times and fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde, and the number of FITC-positive cells was assessed by flow cytometry. Surface expression of MHC class I and class II molecules was monitored in iDCs stimulated with 10 mm caffeine for 1–60 min at 37 °C or on iDCs stimulated with 100 mm KCl, necrotic cell extracts, 100 μm ATP, or 1 μg/ml LPS for 1 min. To monitor surface expression of MHC class I and II molecules, stimulated cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, labeled, and analyzed by flow cytometry using FITC-labeled anti-human HLA DR and HLA A, B, C or, in the case of mouse CD11c+ cells, with FITC-labeled anti mouse I-Ab monoclonal antibody (BD Pharmingen). In Vivo Investigation of Mouse DC-T cell Interactions; Increase in [Ca2+]i and Rapid MHC Class II Induction—CD11c positive DCs were isolated from the spleens of either B6.C-H-2bm12Ly 5.1 mice (abbreviated BM12DC) or B6.Ly 5.1 mice (a generous gift of Prof. Ed Palmer, Department of Biomedicine, Basel University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland). T-lymphocytes were isolated from the lymph nodes of ABM Rg-/- mice. These T cells recognize the I-Abm12 protein expressed on the surface of B6.C-H-2bm12.Ly5.1 DCs but do not recognize the I-Ab protein expressed on the surface of B6.Ly5.1 DCs (24.Bäckström B.T. Müller U. Hausmann B.T. Palmer E. Science. 1998; 281: 835-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). T-lymphocytes were divided in two groups; one group was left untreated, whereas the other was incubated with 100 nm charybdotoxin (Alexa Biochemicals) for 45 min to block K+ channels (25.Chandy G.K. Wulff H. Beeton C. Pennington M. Gutman G.A. Cahalan M.D. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2004; 25: 280-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), after which the cells were washed to remove excess toxin. For Ca2+ imaging BM12DC were loaded with the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator fluo-4 AM (Invitrogen; 5 μm final concentration) for 60 min at 37 °C. In some experiments BM12DCs were simultaneously incubated with 500 μm ryanodine (Calbiochem) and fluo-4 AM. Cells were then washed and resuspended in Krebs-Ringer containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 0.2% bovine serum albumin. BM12DC were allowed to adhere to glass coverslips which were then mounted on a 37 °C thermostatted chamber. Experiments were started by adding T-lymphocytes to the coverslip onto which the BM12DCs had been applied. Changes in fluo-4 fluorescence were monitored with a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-E fluorescent microscope equipped with a CFI APO TIRF 60× objective. Changes in fluorescence were detected by exciting at 488 nm and recording the emission at 510-nm via an electron multiplier C9100–13 Hamamatsu CCD camera. Image analysis was performed with the MetaMorph (Molecular Devices) analysis software package. For MHC II induction untreated T-lymphocytes or T-lymphocytes preincubated with 100 nm charybdotoxin (Alexa Biochemicals) for 45 min and washed to remove excess toxin were used. Both batches of T cells were placed in 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes together with the CD11c positive B6 or B6.C-H-2bm12 DCs. Cells were spun down for 30 s using a Tomy PMC-060 capsulefuge and incubated at 37 °C for an additional 5 min. They were then diluted with ice-cold PBS, washed, and labeled with FITC-anti-mouse I-Ab, biotin-labeled anti-CD11c plus APC (allophycocyanin)-labeled streptavidin, and PE-labeled anti-CD45.1 (all from BD Pharmingen). Expression of MHC class II molecules was determined on triple positive cells by flow cytometry. Statistical Analysis and Software Programs—Statistical analysis was performed using the Student's t test for unpaired samples; means were considered statistically significant when the p value was <0.05. The Origin computer program (Microcal Software, Inc., Northampton, MA) was used to generate graphs and for statistical analysis. Figures were assembled using Photoshop Adobe. Upstream Events Leading to RyR1 Activation—In an earlier report (17.Bracci L. Vukcevic M. Spagnoli G. Ducreux S. Zorzato F. Treves S. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 2232-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) we showed that (i) iDCs only express the type 1 RyR isoform, (ii) the addition of caffeine, 4-chloro-m-cresol, or KCl to iDC causes a RyR1-dependent increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), and (iii) the signaling cascade activated by the Ca2+ increase acts synergistically with signals generated via Toll-like receptors, stimulating DC maturation (17.Bracci L. Vukcevic M. Spagnoli G. Ducreux S. Zorzato F. Treves S. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 2232-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Because RyRs are present in intracellular membranes and are not directly accessible to stimulation, our first aim was to identify events upstream from RyR1 activation by first searching for, and then using a more physiological stimulus leading to DC maturation. Fig. 1 shows that treatment of iDCs with a suboptimal concentration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS 1 ng/ml) for 4 h in the presence of necrotic cell extracts, a stimulus that has been shown to cause maturation (26.Sauter B.B. Albert M.L. Francisco L. Larsson M. Somersan S. Bhardwaj N. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 423-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar), leads to a significant increase in the surface expression of CD83, a reliable phenotypic marker for DC maturation (17.Bracci L.

The signals generated by the addition of the necrotic cell extracts and leading to maturation were significantly decreased by pretreatment of cells with dantrolene (p < 0.034), an inhibitor of the RyR1 (29.Zhao F. Li P. Chen S.R. Louis C.F. Fruen B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13810-13816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) and nifedipine (p < 0.019), a well known L-type Ca2+ channel inhibitor (4.Catterall W.A. Perez-Reyes E. Snutch T.P. Striessnig J. Pharmacol. Rev. 2005; 57: 411-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). The functional involvement of a nifedipine- and ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ signal was confirmed by direct measurements of the intracellular [Ca2+] (Fig. 2, A and B). Individual fura-2 loaded iDCs were stimulated with filtered extracts from necrotic cells. This treatment caused a transient and rapid increase in [Ca2+]i, which was significantly decreased (p < 0.0001) by preincubation of iDCs with 500 μm ryanodine (Fig. 2A, inset) (at high concentrations ryanodine blocks the RyR (30.Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6300-6306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Zimanyi I. Buck J. Abranson J.J. Mack M.M. Pessah I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 1049-1067PubMed Google Scholar); dantrolene, which is used to inhibit RyR-signaling events, is fluorescent and interferes with imaging when using fluorescent Ca2+ indicators) or 10 μm nifedipine (p < 0.0001; Fig. 2A); in fact, the mean Δ fluorescence induced by necrotic extracts was 0.210 ± 0.011 in untreated cells and 0.134 ± 0.094 and 0.029 ± 0.008 in cells pretreated with 500 μm ryanodine or 10 μm nifedipine, respectively. A similar result was observed after the addition of 100 mm KCl to iDCs (Fig. 2B). In the latter case, if the experiments were performed in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ and in the presence of 100 μm La3+ to block Ca2+ influx (32.Kwan C.Y. Takemura H. Obie J.F. Thastrup O.

https://openalex.org/W2061985963,"Glucose 1,6-bisphosphate (Glc-1,6-P2) concentration in brain is much higher than what is required for the functioning of phosphoglucomutase, suggesting that this compound has a role other than as a cofactor of phosphomutases. In cell-free systems, Glc-1,6-P2 is formed from 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate and Glc-6-P by two related enzymes: PGM2L1 (phosphoglucomutase 2-like 1) and, to a lesser extent, PGM2 (phosphoglucomutase 2). It is hydrolyzed by the IMP-stimulated brain Glc-1,6-bisphosphatase of still unknown identity. Our aim was to test whether Glc-1,6-bisphosphatase corresponds to the phosphomannomutase PMM1, an enzyme of mysterious physiological function sharing several properties with Glc-1,6-bisphosphatase. We show that IMP, but not other nucleotides, stimulated by >100-fold (Ka ≈ 20 μm) the intrinsic Glc-1,6-bisphosphatase activity of recombinant PMM1 while inhibiting its phosphoglucomutase activity. No such effects were observed with PMM2, an enzyme paralogous to PMM1 that physiologically acts as a phosphomannomutase in mammals. Transfection of HEK293T cells with PGM2L1, but not the related enzyme PGM2, caused an ≈20-fold increase in the concentration of Glc-1,6-P2. Transfection with PMM1 caused a profound decrease (>5-fold) in Glc-1,6-P2 in cells that were or were not cotransfected with PGM2L1. Furthermore, the concentration of Glc-1,6-P2 in wild-type mouse brain decreased with time after ischemia, whereas it did not change in PMM1-deficient mouse brain. Taken together, these data show that PMM1 corresponds to the IMP-stimulated Glc-1,6-bisphosphatase and that this enzyme is responsible for the degradation of Glc-1,6-P2 in brain. In addition, the role of PGM2L1 as the enzyme responsible for the synthesis of the elevated concentrations of Glc-1,6-P2 in brain is established. Glucose 1,6-bisphosphate (Glc-1,6-P2) concentration in brain is much higher than what is required for the functioning of phosphoglucomutase, suggesting that this compound has a role other than as a cofactor of phosphomutases.

Trucco R.E. Cardini C.E. Paladini A.C. Caputto R. Arch. Biochem. 1948; 19: 339-340PubMed Google Scholar), is ubiquitously present in tissues. Its concentration is particularly elevated in brain, where it reaches values of >100 μm (2Passonneau J.V. Lowry O.H. Schulz D.W. Brown J.G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1976; 251: 2963-2966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are inhibited. These effects have been demonstrated in vitro, but under conditions that are not necessarily physiologically relevant. In addition, the occurrence of this regulation in intact cells has not been demonstrated.Glc-1,6-P2 is synthesized from 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate and glucose 1-phosphate or glucose 6-phosphate by Glc-1,6-P2 synthase, an enzyme particularly abundant in brain (11Rose I.A. Warms J.V. Kaklij G. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 3466-3470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and recently identified as PGM2L1 (phosphoglucomutase 2-like 1) (12Maliekal P. Sokolova T. Vertommen D. Veiga-da-Cunha M. Van Schaftingen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 31844-31851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In vitro, the related enzyme PGM2 (phosphoglucomutase 2), which shares ∼60% identity with PGM2L1 and acts mainly as a phosphopentomutase, also catalyzes the synthesis of Glc-1,6-P2, although with a lower Vmax than PGM2L1 and a much stronger inhibition by the reaction product Glc-1,6-P2. In comparison with PGM2, PGM2L1 is therefore better suited to provide cells with elevated concentrations of Glc-1,6-P2, although this still needs to be demonstrated in intact cells.Glc-1,6-P2 is degraded by glucose-1,6-bisphosphatase. The brain enzyme, which has been best characterized (13Guha S.K. Rose Z.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6634-6637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Guha S.K. Rose Z.B. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 1356-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), is dependent for its activity on the presence of IMP, the concentration of which increases in anoxia. This effect is presumably responsible for the decrease in Glc-1,6-P2 concentration in brain during anoxia (2Passonneau J.V. Lowry O.H. Schulz D.W. Brown J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 902-909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Brain glucose-1,6-bisphosphatase, although not yet molecularly identified, has several characteristics (13Guha S.K. Rose Z.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6634-6637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Guha S.K. Rose Z.B. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 1356-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) that may help to identify its sequence. It catalyzes an exchange reaction between glucose 6-phosphate and Glc-1,6-P2, indicating that the reaction mechanism involves the formation of a phosphoenzyme. It also acts as a mannose-1,6-bisphosphatase and displays some phosphoglucomutase activity. Finally, the molecular mass of this enzyme as determined by gel filtration is ≈87 kDa.These four properties are reminiscent of those of PMM1 (phosphomannomutase 1), an enzyme belonging to the haloacid dehalogenase family of phosphatases/phosphomutases, with a reaction mechanism involving a phosphoenzyme intermediate (15Collet J.F. Stroobant V. Pirard M. Delpierre G. Van Schaftingen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14107-14112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Interestingly, PMM1 shares 66% sequence identity with PMM2, a specific phosphomannomutase (16Pirard M. Achouri Y. Collet J.F. Schollen E. Matthijs G. Van Schaftingen E. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) that is deficient in the most frequent form of congenital disorders of glycosylation, type Ia (17Van Schaftingen E. Jaeken J.

Genet. 1997; 16 (Correction (1997) Nat. Genet. 16, 316): 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). In contrast to PMM2, PMM1 is less specific: it has nearly equal phosphomannomutase and phosphoglucomutase activities as well as a modest glucose-1,6-bisphosphatase activity corresponding to ∼3% of its phosphomannomutase activity (16Pirard M. Achouri Y. Collet J.F. Schollen E. Matthijs G. Van Schaftingen E. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, the effect of IMP on PMM1 activity has never been tested. Like PMM2, PMM1 was once thought to be involved in the in vivo formation of mannose 1-phosphate needed for glycoprotein biosynthesis. However, gene knock-out studies in mice have shown that PMM2 deficiency is early lethal (19Thiel C. Lúbke T. Matthijs G. von Figura K. Kórner C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 5615-5620Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), whereas PMM1 deficiency does not lead to any pathological findings (20Cromphout K. Vleugels W. Heykants L. Schollen E. Keldermans L. Sciot R. D'Hooge R. De Deyn P.P. von Figura K. Hartmann D. Kórner C. Matthijs G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 5621-5635Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). As PMM1 is often present in the same cell types as PMM2 (21Cromphout K. Keldermans L. Snellinx A. Collet J.F. Grúnewald S. De Geest N. Sciot R. Van Schaftingen E. Jaeken J. Matthijs G. Hartmann D. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2005; 22: 991-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), these findings indicate that despite its phosphomannomutase activity, PMM1 cannot substitute for PMM2 in PMM2-deficient mice, suggesting that PMM1 has another physiological role. The purpose of this work was to establish whether the enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of Glc-1,6-P2 in brain indeed corresponds to PMM1 and to identify which of the two enzymes, PGM2L1 and PGM2, is able to make elevated concentrations of Glc-1,6-P2 in intact cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESOverexpression and Purification of Mouse PMM1 and PMM2—To produce recombinant mouse PMM1, 1 liter of Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) pLysS harboring pET-3d containing full-length mouse PMM1 cDNA was grown, and PMM1 was overexpressed and purified as described (21Cromphout K. Keldermans L. Snellinx A. Collet J.F. Grúnewald S. De Geest N. Sciot R. Van Schaftingen E. Jaeken J. Matthijs G. Hartmann D. Eur. J.

Genomics. 1997; 40: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). After DEAE-Sepharose chromatography (GE Healthcare), we used the most purified fraction (90% purity as indicated by SDS-PAGE analysis) eluted with ∼150 mm NaCl for characterization of the kinetic properties of PMM1. For the production of recombinant mouse PMM2, the coding region of PMM2 cDNA was cloned into pET-15b using NdeI (containing the initial ATG site) and BamHI (placed after the stop codon) restriction sites. After confirmation of the sequence by sequencing, the plasmid was used to transform E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS. The culture was grown in LB-rich medium at 30 °C, and PMM2 with an N-terminal His6 tag was overexpressed for 18 h after addition of 0.4 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Preparation of the bacterial extract and purification of His6-tagged PMM2 on a 1-ml HisTrap column (Ni2+ form; GE Healthcare) were done as described previously (23Gemayel R. Fortpied J. Rzem R. Vertommen D. Veiga-da-Cunha M. Van Schaftingen E. FEBS J. 2007; 274: 4360-4374Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). PMM2 was eluted (as indicated by SDS-PAGE analysis) with 20 ml of 150 mm imidazole, concentrated 4-fold on two 15-ml Vivaspin ultrafiltration columns (10 ml/column; Sartorius, Stockport, United Kingdom), and finally desalted on two PD-10 columns (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.2), 30 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin and antipain. Protein concentration was estimated by measuring A280 assuming a molar absorptivity of 20,775 m–1 cm–1. Purified PMM2 (30 mg of pure protein/liter of culture) was supplemented with 10% glycerol and stored at –70 °C.Expression of Human PGM2 and PGM2L1 and Mouse PMM1 and PMM2 in HEK293T Cells—The open reading frames encoding human PGM2 or PGM2L1 and mouse PMM1 or PMM2 were PCR-amplified (primer sequences available upon request). The template DNAs for the polymerase reactions were the corresponding bacterial expression plasmids described above (PMM1 and PMM2) and in Ref. 12Maliekal P. Sokolova T. Vertommen D.

After cloning the PCR-amplified fragments in pBluescript and excluding any PCR errors by sequencing, PGM2 and PGM2L1 inserts were ligated into the eukaryotic expression vector pEF6/Myc-HisA (Invitrogen) using EcoRV and NotI (PGM2) or EcoRI and EcoRV (PGM2L1) restriction sites, allowing the production of a protein with a C-terminal His6 tag. PMM1 and PMM2 inserts were ligated into the pEF6/HisA expression vector (Invitrogen) using KpnI and NotI restriction sites, allowing the production of proteins with an N-terminal His6 tag. HEK293T cells were transfected (8 μg of DNA) or cotransfected (2 × 4 μg of DNA) using the jetPEI transfection kit (Polyplus Transfection, Illkirch, France) as described previously (24Rzem R. Van Schaftingen E. Veiga-da-Cunha M. Biochimie (Paris). 2006; 88: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We used four culture dishes per condition tested: triplicates to measure Glc-1,6-P2 concentration and one dish to confirm protein expression. After 48 h of incubation at 37 °C, the medium was completely removed, and the proteins were immediately denatured in three dishes by addition of 400 μl of ice-cold 5% HClO4. The cells in the fourth dish were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in 500 μl of 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.1) containing 5 μg/ml leupeptin and antipain. The HClO4 extracts were prepared by recovering the suspension from the dish and centrifuging at 4 °C for 5 min at 16,000 × g. To quantify the proteins, the pellets were resolubilized in 200 μl of 0.2 m NaOH, and protein concentration was measured using γ-globulin as a standard (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213462) Google Scholar). The supernatant was recovered, neutralized with 3 m K2CO3, and used to assay Glc-1,6-P2 after elimination of the salt precipitate by centrifugation. In the fourth dish, proteins were extracted as described (24Rzem R. Van Schaftingen E. Veiga-da-Cunha M. Biochimie (Paris). 2006; 88: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and expression of all four His6-tagged proteins was quantified by Western blot analysis using Penta·His™ monoclonal antibody (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany).Extraction of Glc-1,6-P2 from Mouse Tissues—Tissues were removed from wild-type or PMM1-deficient mice anesthetized by inhalation with sevoflurane and immediately frozen-clamped. When various tissues were taken from the same animal, the brain was always the first one to be removed, followed by kidney, liver, lung, and muscle. When blood was collected, we used a different set of mice. Neutralized HClO4 extracts were prepared by homogenizing the frozen tissues (or 300 μl of freshly collected whole blood) in 3 volumes (w/v) of ice-cold 5% HClO4, centrifuging at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, neutralizing the supernatant with 3 m K2CO3, and eliminating the salt precipitate by centrifugation. PMM1-deficient mice were obtained as described previously (20Cromphout K. Vleugels W. Heykants L. Schollen E. Keldermans L. Sciot R. D'Hooge R. De Deyn P.P. von Figura K. Hartmann D. Kórner C.

Phosphoglucomutase activity was measured spectrophotometrically at 30 °C in a cuvette containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.1), 0.1 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm NADP+, 0.5 mm glucose 1-phosphate free of Glc-1,6-P2 (Merck), 1.75 units/ml yeast glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Roche Applied Science), and 0–0.5 μm Glc-1,6-P2 (used as a standard; Roche Applied Science) or 5–20 μl of sample neutralized HClO4 extracts. The reaction was initiated by addition of 0.05 units/ml desalted rabbit muscle phosphoglucomutase (Roche Applied Science). The concentration of Glc-1,6-P2 in the unknown samples was calculated from a standard curve obtained under the same conditions.Enzymatic Assays—The phosphoglucomutase and phosphomannomutase activities of PMM1 and PMM2 were assayed in 25 mm Mes (pH 6.5), 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mm NADP+, 1 μm Glc-1,6-P2, 1.75 units/ml desalted yeast glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and 25 μm glucose 1-phosphate (phosphoglucomutase activity) or mannose 1-phosphate (phosphomannomutase activity). When the substrate was mannose 1-phosphate (Sigma), we added 2 units/ml yeast phosphomannose isomerase (Sigma) and 3 units/ml desalted yeast phosphoglucose isomerase (Roche Applied Science) to convert the product of the reaction, mannose 6-phosphate, to glucose 6-phosphate. The reaction was started by addition of purified PMM1 (0.1 μg/ml) or PMM2 (1.8 μg/ml to assay phosphoglucomutase activity and 0.18 μg/ml to assay phosphomannomutase activity). Glucose-1,6-bisphosphatase activity was measured in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.1), 0.1 mm EGTA, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mm NADP+, and 0.15 mm Glc-1,6-P2 with or without IMP or other nucleotides, 0.2 units/ml rabbit muscle phosphoglucomutase, and 1.75 units/ml yeast glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. The reaction was started by addition of purified PMM1 (0.02 μg/ml) or PMM2 (18 μg/ml). In the assay conditions specified, one unit is the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of 1 μmol of substrate that is coupled to the reduction of 1 μmol of NADP+/min.RESULTSIMP and GMP Stimulate PMM1 (but Not PMM2) Glucose-1,6-bisphosphatase Activity—To investigate whether PMM1 is the glucose-1,6-bisphosphatase described in mouse brain by Guha and Rose (13Guha S.K. Rose Z.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6634-6637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Guha S.K. Rose Z.B. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 1356-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), we overexpressed recombinant mouse PMM1 in E. coli and partially purified it on an anion exchange column. The most purified fraction (∼90% purity) was used to investigate the glucose-1,6-bisphosphatase activity of PMM1. This activity amounted to 2.1 ± 0.25 μmol/min/mg of protein in the presence of 150 μm Glc-1,6-P2. Both IMP and GMP (Fig. 1), but not AMP (data not shown), increased the glucose-1,6-bisphosphatase activity of PMM1 up to 110-fold with a Ka of 3 μm in the case of IMP and up to 30-fold with a Ka of 80 μm in the case of GMP. The Km of PMM1 for Glc-1,6-P2 was 17 and 40 μm in the presence of 1 and 20 μm IMP, respectively. In contrast to PMM1, the glucose-1,6-bisphosphatase activity of PMM2 was extremely low (0.01 ± 0.0005 μmol/min/mg of protein, i.e. 0.05% of the basal glucose-1,6-bisphosphatase activity of PMM1) and was insensitive to IMP and GMP (both tested at up to 1 mm). Furthermore, other nucleotides (AMP, ADP, ATP, UMP, UDP, UTP, CTP, GMP, and GTP, all tested at 100 μm) did not stimulate the glucose-1,6-bisphosphatase activity of PMM1 or PMM2 (data not shown).Because IMP activated the glucose-1,6-bisphosphatase activity of PMM1, we were interested to find out whether IMP inhibits the phosphoglucomutase and phosphomannomutase activities of this enzyme. Both mutase activities, measured with glucose 1-phosphate (Fig. 2a) or mannose 1-phosphate (Fig. 2b) as substrate, were inhibited by increasing IMP concentrations. In contrast, neither the phosphoglucomutase (0.85 ± 0.006 μmol/min/mg of protein) nor the phosphomannomutase (16 ± 0.15 μmol/min/mg of protein) activity of PMM2 decreased by >5% in the presence of 1 mm IMP (data not shown).FIGURE 2Inhibition by IMP of the phosphoglucomutase (a) and phosphomannomutase (b) activities of PMM1. Both enzymatic activities were assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures” with 1 μm Glc-1,6-P2, increasing concentrations of IMP, and 25 μm glucose 1-phosphate (a) or mannose 1-phosphate (b). The results shown are the means ± S.E. of three determinations with the same enzyme preparation.

Furthermore, human erythrocyte Glc-1,6-P2 synthase was shown to copurify with phosphopentomutase, i.e. PGM2 (26Accorsi A. Fazi A. Piatti E. Piacentini M.P. Magnani M. Fornaini G. Mech.

On the other hand, PMM1 was never shown to hydrolyze Glc-1,6-P2 in vivo. To investigate the synthesis and degradation of Glc-1,6-P2 under more physiological conditions, we transfected HEK293T cells with plasmids driving the expression of human PGM2 or PGM2L1 and/or mouse PMM1 or PMM2 (Fig. 3). Glc-1,6-P2 concentration was determined in cell extracts with a highly sensitive assay based on the activation of rabbit muscle phosphoglucomutase by Glc-1,6-P2. Neutralized HClO4 extracts from cell cultures transfected with PGM2L1 or PGM2 showed either a 20-fold (p < 0.0001; n = 3) or a non-significant 1.5-fold (p = 0.076; n = 3) increase in the concentration of Glc-1,6-P2 compared with control cultures transfected with the empty plasmid (51.7 ± 5.2 nmol/g of protein), confirming that PGM2L1 is indeed the enzyme responsible for Glc-1,6-P2 synthesis. Remarkably, transfection of PMM1 alone or in cells cotransfected with PGM2L1 almost depleted the cells of Glc-1,6-P2 (3.7 ± 3.7 nmol/g of protein, i.e. 14-fold lower than the control (p = 0.0016; n = 3)) in the first case or lowered its concentration to levels close to control values in the second case. On the other hand, when PMM2 was cotransfected with PGM2L1, intracellular Glc-1,6-P2 levels were decreased by only 25% (p = 0.0025; n = 3) despite the fact that PMM2 was 6-fold better expressed than PMM1 (see below). Similarly, overexpression of PMM2 alone did not significantly lower the intracellular concentration of Glc-1,6-P2 (22.3 ± 11.2 nmol/g of protein) compared with control cells, confirming that the role of PMM1 in intact cells is indeed to hydrolyze Glc-1,6-P2.FIGURE 3Effect of overexpression of human PGM2L1 or PGM2 and mouse PMM1 or PMM2 on the Glc-1,6-P2 level in HEK293T cells. HEK293T cells were plated in 10-cm diameter dishes and transfected with the indicated quantities of plasmids encoding mouse (m) PMM1 or PMM2 or human (h) PGM2 or PGM2L1. Perchloric acid extracts were prepared 48 h after transfection for the assay of Glc-1,6-P2. The results shown represent one example of at least four similar experiments. In the experiment shown, the concentrations of Glc-1,6-P2 are the means ± S.E. of three independent transfections. Glc-1,6-P2 values were compared using Student's t test, and the difference was considered non-significant (n.s.) at p > 0.05.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)As all constructs encoded His6-tagged proteins, we could verify the expression of the transfected enzymes by Western blotting (data not shown). Interestingly, PGM2 was >2-fold better expressed than PGM2L1, and PMM2 was 6–7-fold better expressed than PMM1. When proteins were cotransfected, expression of PGM2L1 and of each of the PMM proteins was lowered by 2–4-fold (data not shown).Deletion of PMM1 Blocks Glc-1,6-P2 Hydrolysis in PMM1-deficient Mouse Brain—To confirm that PMM1 is the physiological IMP-activated glucose-1,6-bisphosphatase described in mouse brain (13Guha S.K.

Schulz D.W. Brown J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 902-909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we measured Glc-1,6-P2 concentration in neutralized HClO4 extracts from brains of wild-type and PMM1-deficient mice. For this purpose, the brains of deeply anesthetized mice were removed. One hemisphere was frozen as fast as possible (≈30 s) after removal from the mouse skull (t = 0 min), whereas the other was frozen after 5 min at room temperature (t = 5 min). Fig. 4a shows that the Glc-1,6-P2 concentration in t = 0 min brains was about two times higher in the brains of PMM1-deficient mice in comparison with those of wild-type mice. In addition, we observed that the Glc-1,6-P2 concentration decreased with time in wild-type mouse brain, but not in PMM1-deficient mouse brain.FIGURE 4Concentration of Glc-1,6-P2 in tissues of control and PMM1-deficient mice. Mice were deeply anesthetized before organs were removed. Glc-1,6-P2 was measured in neutralized HClO4 extracts from brain hemispheres that were frozen as fast as possible after removal from the mouse skull (t = 0 min) or after 5 min at room temperature (t = 5 min) (a) or from other tissues that were frozen as soon as they were removed from the animal (b). The results shown are the means ± S.E. of determinations made in four to seven different mice. Glc-1,6-P2 values were compared using Student's t test.

In view of these results, we decided to measure Glc-1,6-P2 in neutralized HClO4 extracts of various tissues from wild-type and PMM1-deficient mice. Fig. 4b shows that the absence of PMM1 failed to affect significantly the concentration of Glc-1,6-P2 in liver, lung, blood, and skeletal muscle, suggesting that PMM1 is absent from these tissues and/or that the concentration of IMP is too low to stimulate its activity.DISCUSSIONPMM1 Is the IMP-sensitive Glucose-1,6-bisphosphatase—Our results show that PMM1 actually corresponds to the enzyme described by Guha and Rose (13Guha S.K.

The majority of CDF family members have six putative transmembrane domains (TMD) and a highly conserved amino acid sequence extending from TMD II to III, which is a signature motif for the family. Based on the alignment of multiple sequences, highly conserved charged residues in TMD II and V are implicated in metal binding and transport.

Little is known of the mechanism of transport, although it is clear that CCC1 is regulated by iron at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels (14Puig S. Askeland E. Thiele D.J. Cell. 2005; 120: 99-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 15Li L. Bagley D. Ward D.M. Kaplan J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 1326-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Deletion of CCC1 results in poor growth in high iron medium indicating that increased cytosolic iron may be toxic (6Li L. Chen O.S. McVey Ward D. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29515-29519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The mechanism(s) leading to high iron toxicity is unknown. High iron toxicity occurs in cells deleted for CCC1 even in the absence of respiratory capacity (e.g. rho° cells) or anaerobically (16Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33653-33661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). These results call into question the assumption that high iron toxicity is due to the generation of iron-mediated reactive oxygen radicals. In an effort to define the mechanism of iron toxicity we initiated a genetic screen in which we identified mutant strains of Δccc1 that grew on high iron. Herein, we identify a missense mutation in the vacuolar zinc transporter Zrc1, which completely changes the substrate specificity of this transporter from Zn2+ to Fe2+. We show that a similar amino acid change in the homologous Cot1, a Co2+ and Zn2+ transporter, also results in a change in metal specificity. Yeast Strains—The following yeast strains (W303 background) were used: DY150 (Mata ade2-1 his3-11 leu2-3,112 trp1-1 ura3-52 can1-100(oc)) and DY1457 (Matα ade6 his3-11 leu2-3,112 trp1-1 ura3-52 can1-100(oc)). Deletions of CCC1 and ZRC1 were generated by double fusion polymerase chain reaction using the HIS3 gene as a selectable marker (17Amberg D.C. Botstein D. Beasley E.M. Yeast. 1995; 11: 1275-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Primers for disruption of CCC1 were described (6Li L. Chen O.S. McVey Ward D. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29515-29519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Primers for disruption of ZRC1 were Pri20–78 (5′-TCT CTT TTG ACC TTA GAC ACG-3′), Pri20–79 (5′-GTC GTG ACT GGG AAA ACC CTG GCG ATC GCT GCC ATG ATC GTG GAA-3′), Pri20–80 (TCC TGT GTG AAA TTG TTA TCC GCT GCT GAT CAG ATT CAA AGA GAG-3′), and Pri20–81 (GCA GTT TAC AGC GTC ATC TAC-3′). The COT1 gene was disrupted using URA3 as described (4Conklin D.S. McMaster J.A. Culbertson M.R. Kung C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3678-3688Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Strains with a FET3-lacZ reporter integrated at the HO locus were constructed as described (18Crisp R.J. Pollington A. Galea C. Jaron S. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45499-45506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Wild type BY4743 (Mat a/α his3Δ1/his3Δ1 leu2Δ0/leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0/+ met15Δ0/+ ura3Δ0/ura3Δ0), Δcot1::KanMX and Δpmr1::KanMX strains in the BY4743 background were obtained from Research Genetics. Growth Media—Yeast strains were grown in YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose) or in CM medium (0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% dextrose, and 0.13% amino acid drop-out mixture). Low iron growth medium was made by adding 40 μm bathophenanthroline disulfonate (BPS), an iron chelator, to CM and then the addition of specified amounts of FeSO4. To make high iron plates, ferrous ammonium sulfate (250 mm stock in water) was added into media to give the indicated iron concentrations. FeSO4 (50 mm stock in 0.1 m HCl) was used in liquid culture as indicated together with a final concentration of 1 mm ascorbic acid. Isolation of Mutants—DY150 Δccc1 or DY1457 Δccc1 cells were plated on CM agar plates at a density of 500 cells/plate and exposed to UV light to give a 50% survival. Mutagenized cells were grown for 2 days and then replicated to CM plates containing 5 mm ferrous ammonium sulfate. Cells were grown for another 3 days. Colonies able to grow on high iron were selected for further study. Identification of ZRC1(N44I)—The mutated gene in dominant mutant R1 was identified by constructing a library from the R1 genomic DNA using standard protocols (19Ausubel F.M. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley, New York1995Google Scholar). Briefly, Sau3A partially digested genomic DNA was fractionated on a 10–40% sucrose gradient, and centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 22 h. The 8–10-kb genomic fraction was ligated to pRS416-zero, a centromeric plasmid, digested with BamHI and dephosphorylated with calf intestinal phosphatase (New England BioLabs). Ligation products were transformed into Electromax™ DH10B™ E. coli (Invitrogen) (20Calvin N.M. Hanawalt P.C. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2796-2801Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Plasmids were extracted from transformed bacteria and pooled. The pooled library was transformed into Δccc1 cells and plasmids that conferred resistance to high iron (3 mm) were recovered. The genomic fragments in these plasmids were identified by sequencing. Plasmids Construction and Site-directed Mutagenesis—ZRC1(N44I) was subcloned from the genomic library using KpnI and BglII and inserted into pRS416 (a yeast centromeric vector), which had been digested with BamHI and KpnI. Wild type ZRC1 with its own promoter and 3′ end was generated using PCR from genomic DNA using pri54 (5′-GAT ATG AAA GTA GTT GCA TT-3′) and pri60 (5′-TTG GTA CAG GAG GGA ACA AG-3′). The PCR fragment was digested with BglII and KpnI and inserted into pRS416 digested with BamHI and KpnI. To introduce the N44I mutation into wild type ZRC1, pri64 (5′-GGC CTT GAT TGC CGA TTC ATT TCA CAT GTT GAT TGA TAT CAT CTC TCT TTT AGT GGC-3′) and pri65 (5′-GCC ACT AAA AGA GAG ATG ATA TCA ATC AAC ATG TGA AAT GAA TCG GCA ATC AAG GCC-3′) were used. To introduce the D45A mutation into wild type ZRC1, pri102 (5′-CAC ATG TTG AAT GCT ATC ATC TCT CTT TTA GTG GCA C-3′) and pri103 (5′-GTG CCA CTA AAA GAG AGA TGA TAG CAT TCA ACA TGT G-3′) were used. COT1/YEp352 was obtained from Dr. Douglas S. Conklin (4Conklin D.S. McMaster J.A. Culbertson M.R. Kung C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3678-3688Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). To introduce N45I into wild type COT1, pri66 (5′-CGC GGA CTC ATT CCA TAT GCT AAT CGA TAT AAT TTC TCT TGT GG-3′) and pri67 (5′-CCA CAA GAG AAA TTA TAT CGA TTA GCA TAT GGA ATG AGT CCG CG-3′) were used. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene according to the manufacturer's instructions. ZRC1 and ZRC1(N44I) were digested with KpnI and XbaI and inserted into a yeast episomal vector pTF62 (LEU2 marker). To generate His6-tagged versions of CCC1, ZRC1, and ZRC1(N44I) under the control of the galactose inducible promoter (GAL1) the following primers were used: CCC1, pri78 (5′-CGC GGA TCC ATG TCC ATT GTA GCA CTA AAG-3′) and pri79 (5′-CCG GAA TTC ACC CAG TAA CTT AAC AAA GAA-3′), for ZRC1 and ZRC1(N44I), pri80 (5′-GGG CGA AGA TCT ATG ATC ACC GGT AAA GAA TTG-3′) and pri81 (5′-CCG GAA TTC CAG GCA ATT GGA AGT ATT GCA-3′). DNA was amplified by PCR to generate each open reading frame without the stop codon. The amplified products were inserted into BamHI- and EcoRI-digested pYES2/CT (Invitrogen). Metal Analysis—For whole cell metal analysis, 20 OD cells (about 2 × 108 cells) at log phase were collected, washed three times with 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 6.5), 10 mm EDTA and once with deionized water. Vacuoles were prepared using Ficoll gradients as described previously (6Li L. Chen O.S. McVey Ward D. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29515-29519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Samples were digested in 200 μl of nitric acid at 80 °C for 1 h, then diluted to 1.0 ml with deionized water. Metals were analyzed in a Perkin-Elmer Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectrometer (ICP) and calculated using a standard curve generated from mixed metal standards. Western Blot, β-Galactosidase Activity, and Protein Concentration Assay—Cells were disrupted with glass beads in the presence of protease inhibitors (1.0 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.0 μm pepstatin A, and 1.0 μm leupeptin) (Sigma). Samples (20 μg) were run on a 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with rabbit anti-His6 tag (1:2000 Abcam) or mouse anti-Vma1 antibody (1:4000, Molecular Probes), followed by peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse antibody (1:10,000, Jackson ImmunoResearch). Membranes were developed using chemiluminescence reagents (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The reporter constructs FET3-lacZ and CCC1-lacZ were described previously (15Li L. Bagley D. Ward D.M. Kaplan J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 1326-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 18Crisp R.J. Pollington A. Galea C. Jaron S. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45499-45506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase activity was performed in 96-well plates using ortho-nitrophenyl-β-galactoside as a substrate. The generation of ortho-nitrophenol was monitored at 420 nm and the data are presented as nanomole/min/mg of protein (18Crisp R.J. Pollington A. Galea C. Jaron S. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45499-45506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Identification of Yeast Mutants Resistant to High Iron—Deletion of CCC1 results in sensitivity to high iron (6Li L. Chen O.S. McVey Ward D. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29515-29519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 15Li L. Bagley D. Ward D.M. Kaplan J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 1326-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We took advantage of this phenotype to identify UV-induced mutants of Δccc1 cells that were capable of growth on high iron medium. We screened 12,400 colonies and identified 15 mutants that would survive on high iron medium. The mutants were backcrossed to the parental strain (Δccc1) to determine whether they were single gene defects and whether the mutants were dominant or recessive. Seven of the mutants were single gene recessive mutations that fell into two complementation groups. Eight of the mutants were dominant. The mutants were characterized as having different sensitivity to high iron, as shown by liquid (Fig. 1A) and plate growth assays (Fig. 1B). There are several potential mechanisms that might lead to high iron-resistant growth: decreased iron uptake, increased iron export, increased iron storage, or increased antioxidant defenses. To determine whether the mutant strains had decreased iron acquisition, cells were grown in CM medium overnight and cellular iron levels were measured by ICP. Mutants W2 and W7 accumulate less iron than control Δccc1 cells. R1 and W17 accumulated more iron than the parental Δccc1 strain (Fig. 2A). If resistance to high iron was due to increased iron export from cells, then the mutant strains might not grow on low iron. This situation was observed for a mutant PDR1 in which high iron resistance was correlated with low iron sensitivity (21Tuttle M.S. Radisky D. Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1273-1280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The Δccc1 mutant strains were able to grow on iron-limited medium, which requires a functional iron transport system (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that the resistance to high iron cannot be explained only by decreased iron acquisition or increased iron export. If iron toxicity was due to increased oxidative damage resulting from Fenton chemistry, then increased antioxidant defenses might reduce such damage. To test this possibility we examined the ability of mutant cells to resist the effect of the oxidants H2O2 and paraquat. One mutant (W17) showed a slight increase in paraquat resistance, but in general the mutants were as sensitive to oxidants as the parental strains (Fig. 2C). We tested the possibility that the mutants were able to store or sequester cytosolic iron by measuring the expression of an iron-responsive reporter. Transcription of CCC1 or a CCC1-lacZ reporter construct is increased by iron through activation of the transcription factor Yap5 (15Li L. Bagley D. Ward D.M. Kaplan J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 1326-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Wild type, Δccc1, and Δccc1 mutants were transformed with a CCC1-lacZ construct and the effect of iron on induction of β-galactosidase activity was determined. Compared with wild type cells, Δccc1 cells showed a higher expression of CCC1-lacZ, indicating the presence of increased cytosolic iron. This induction of CCC1-lacZ was repressed when the CCC1 gene was introduced back to Δccc1 cells (Fig. 2D). Mutants W2 and W17 showed similar amounts of CCC1-lacZ activity compared with the parental Δccc1 strain. R1 and W7, however, showed lower levels of β-galactosidase compared with the parental strains. The R1 mutant was the most resistant to growth inhibition by high iron (cf. Fig. 1A). Mutant R1 had a slight increase in cellular iron compared with Δccc1 but less cytosolic iron as indicated by the CCC1-lacZ reporter assay. This implies that the resistance to high iron growth might be due to its ability to sequester cytosolic iron. Taken together these results showed that different mechanisms may contribute to high iron resistance in mutant strains. The High Iron Resistance of Mutant R1 Is Caused by a Mutation in ZRC1—To identify the gene responsible for the high iron resistance of R1 a low copy genomic library was generated from R1 cells. The library was transformed into the Δccc1 cells and transformants able to grow on high iron were identified. Plasmids conferring resistance to high iron were isolated and the genes on the insert were identified. Several plasmids containing overlapping segments of chromosome XIII were isolated. ZRC1, a gene that encodes a vacuolar zinc transporter (5Kamizono A. Nishizawa M. Teranishi Y. Murata K. Kimura A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 219: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 22MacDiarmid C.W. Gaither L.A. Eide D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2845-2855Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), was identified as a common gene on all rescued plasmids. Subcloning of the insert showed that the R1-specific ZRC1 plasmid conferred iron resistance when transformed into Δccc1 cells (data not shown). Sequence analysis of R1-ZRC1 revealed a mutation at position 131 of the coding sequence that altered an adenine to thymidine, which resulted in the substitution of isoleucine for asparagine at amino acid position 44 (referred to henceforth as ZRC1(N44I)). To confirm that this single amino acid change was responsible for high iron resistance, the asparagine at position 44 of the wild type Zrc1 was changed to an isoleucine by site-directed mutagenesis. When transformed into Δccc1 cells, ZRC1(N44I) was able to confer high iron resistance to Δccc1 cells (Fig. 3A). Zrc1 was identified initially as a high copy suppressor of zinc-sensitive growth (5Kamizono A. Nishizawa M. Teranishi Y. Murata K. Kimura A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 219: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and deletion of ZRC1 increases zinc sensitivity (7MacDiarmid C.W. Milanick M.A. Eide D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15065-15072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Cells with a deletion in ZRC1 showed zinc-sensitive growth that was suppressed by expression of plasmid containing ZRC1 but not by a plasmid containing ZRC1(N44I) (Fig. 3B). This result demonstrates that Zrc1(N44I) has lost its intrinsic zinc transport activity, and may explain why the R1 mutant is sensitive to high zinc concentration (data not shown). It is possible that a loss of function of ZRC1 protects Δccc1 from high iron toxicity by altering zinc homeostasis and modulating the entire yeast transcriptome. To test this we generated a mutant ZRC1 based on the sequence alignment of Zrc1 with the E. coli FieF, another member of the cation diffusion facilitator family (23Lu M. Fu D. Science. 2007; 317: 1746-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of FieF suggests that Asp49 is involved in binding the zinc substrate. The homologous residue in Zrc1 is Asp45 and site-specific mutagenesis of ZRC1(D45A) resulted in an expressed protein that was unable able to protect Δzrc1 cells from high zinc toxicity (Fig. 3B). This construct was unable to permit Δccc1 cells to grow on high iron medium (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, deletion of ZRC1 in Δccc1 cells did not protect Δccc1 from high concentrations of iron (Fig. 3C). Together, these data suggest that loss of zinc transport activity is not sufficient to protect Δccc1 from high iron toxicity and also explains why mutant R1 shows dominant characteristics. Zrc1(N44I) Increased Vacuolar Iron—Because Zrc1 localizes to the vacuolar membrane (9MacDiarmid C.W. Milanick M.A. Eide D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39187-39194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), it is possible that Zrc1(N44I) transports iron into the vacuole, which would decrease cytosolic iron. We tested this possibility by assaying the expression of a FET3-lacZ reporter. This reporter construct is regulated by the low iron sensing transcription factor Aft1 (24Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1231-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Overexpression of CCC1, by transporting iron into vacuoles, leads to lower cytosolic iron inducing the expression of a FET3-lacZ reporter (6Li L. Chen O.S. McVey Ward D. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29515-29519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A). Expression of ZRC1(N44I) was also able to induce FET3-lacZ activity compared with cells transformed with either a vector or wild type ZRC1. Conversely, expression of ZRC1(N44I) but not wild type ZRC1 was able to reduce the activity of a CCC1-lacZ reporter construct (Fig. 4B). These results confirm that expression of ZRC1(N44I) lowers cytosolic iron. To prove that Zrc1(N44I) transports iron into vacuoles, iron was measured in vacuoles isolated from Δccc1 cells transformed with empty vector or plasmids expressing ZRC1 or ZRC1(N44I). Overexpression of wild type ZRC1 showed a slight increase in vacuolar iron relative to vector-transformed cells (Fig. 4C). Overexpression of ZRC1(N44I), however, resulted in a 3–4-fold increase in vacuolar iron. Together, these results show that ZRC1(N44I) is a gain of function allele that can confer iron-resistant growth by exporting iron from cytosol to vacuole. These data show that Zrc1(N44I) can transport iron but it is hard to compare the intrinsic iron transport activity of Zrc1(N44I) with that of Ccc1, as expression of each transporter is regulated differently. CCC1 transcription and mRNA stability are increased by iron, whereas ZRC1 (and by implication ZRC1(N44I)) shows increased transcription due to low zinc (7MacDiarmid C.W. Milanick M.A. Eide D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15065-15072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). To determine the intrinsic iron transport activity of Ccc1, Zrc1, and Zrc1(N44I), each was cloned into a GAL1-regulated vector. We placed a His6 epitope at the carboxyl terminus of each gene, which permitted us to determine protein levels. GAL1 regulated CCC1-HIS6 and ZRC1(N44I)-HIS6 were able to suppress the high iron growth defect of Δccc1 cells, whereas as a GAL1 regulated ZRC1-HIS6 was not (Fig. 5A). Under similar growth conditions, Zrc1-HIS6 and Zrc1(N44I)-HIS6 were expressed to higher levels than Ccc1-HIS6 (Fig. 5B). Measurement of iron transport activity based on FET3-lacZ expression showed that Zrc1-HIS6 had no measurable iron transport activity, whereas both Zrc1(N44I)-HIS6 or Ccc1-HIS6 induced expression of FET3-lacZ (Fig. 5C). Based on the expression levels of the proteins Zrc1(N44I)-HIS6 has ∼10–15% of the iron transport activity of Ccc1-HIS6. Δccc1 cells transformed with empty vector or galactose-regulated constructs were grown in galactose medium with 100 μm FeSO4. Vacuoles were isolated and iron content determined. Overexpression of CCC1-HIS6 and ZRC1(N44I)-HIS6, but not ZRC1-HIS6 increased vacuolar iron compared with vector-transformed control cells (Fig. 5D). There was more iron in Ccc1-HIS6 vacuoles than in Zrc1(N44I)-HIS6 vacuoles, again indicating that Ccc1 was more efficient in transporting iron into vacuoles. It might be possible that iron is not transported into the vacuole but rather the iron is tightly bound to the cytosolic facing surface of Zrc1(N44I). The difference in vacuolar iron between Δccc1 cells overexpressing ZRC1(N44I) and control cells (empty vector) was about 10–12 nmol/mg of vacuolar protein. The crystal structure of the E. coli CDF family member FieF suggests that it has 4 Zn binding sites (11Wei Y. Li H. Fu D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39251-39259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Assuming one molecule of Zrc1(N44I) binds 4 atoms of iron, then based on the molecular mass of Zrc1 (48,344 daltons), would require ∼0.12–0.15 mg of Zrc1 protein/mg of vacuole protein to bind the measured iron. This means that Zrc1(N44I) would have to constitute 12–15% of vacuolar proteins. To test this prediction we grew Δccc1 cells, transformed with either a control vector or GAL-regulated ZRC1(N44I) in galactose medium overnight and then in galactose medium containing 100 μm FeSO4 for 4 h. Cells were harvested, vacuolar iron determined, and vacuolar proteins applied to SDS-PAGE and the gel analyzed by Western blot and silver stain. Vacuoles isolated from control cells only showed a slight increase in iron over the time course of the experiment, probably due to endocytosis of iron from the culture media. Vacuoles isolated from Zrc1(N44I) showed a much greater increase in vacuolar iron (Fig. 6A). Western blot showed that during this time course, the Zrc1(N44I)-HIS6 protein was expressed and remained constant (Fig. 6B). Silver staining of vacuolar proteins from both control and Zrc1(N44I)-HIS6 expressing cells had a similar protein distribution in which the band corresponding to Zrc1(N44I)-HIS6 was not notable (Fig. 6C), suggesting that the protein abundance would be insufficient to bind vacuolar iron. Zrc1(N44I) Transports Manganese—Many transporters that transport iron also transport Mn2+ (25Dix D.R. Bridgham J.T. Broderius M.A. Byersdorfer C.A. Eide D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26092-26099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Forbes J.R. Gros P. Blood. 2003; 102: 1884-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar).

Microbiol. 1996; 21: 519-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), although with the concentrations and strain used here the sensitivity was slight at best. Expression of ZRC1(N44I) suppressed Mn2+ toxicity in Δccc1 cells to a greater extent than ZRC1 (Fig. 7A). Pmr1 is a Golgi membrane P-type ATPase involved in transporting Ca2+ and Mn2+ into the Golgi (28Lapinskas P.J. Cunningham K.W. Liu X.F. Fink G.R. Culotta V.C. Mol. Cel"

However, it has been difficult to recognize areas with a higher likelihood of promoting diversification. We reconstructed centres of origin of lineages and identified areas in the Mexican tropical dry forest that have been important centres of diversification (sources) and areas where species are maintained but where diversification is less likely to occur (diversity sinks). We used a molecular phylogeny of the genus Bursera, a dominant member of the forest, along with information on current species distributions. Results indicate that vast areas of the forest have historically functioned as diversity sinks, generating few or no extant Bursera lineages. Only a few areas have functioned as major engines of diversification. Long-term preservation of biodiversity may be promoted by incorporation of such knowledge in decision-making."
https://openalex.org/W1974938857,"Behaviour is shaped by evolution as to maximise fitness by balancing gains and risks. Models on decision making in biology, psychology or economy have investigated choices among options which differ in gain and/or risk. Meanwhile, there are decision contexts with uniform risk distributions where options are not differing in risk while the overall risk level may be high. Adequate predictions for the emerging investment patterns in risk uniformity are missing. Here we use foraging behaviour as a model for decision making. While foraging, animals often titrate food and safety from predation and prefer safer foraging options over riskier ones. Risk uniformity can occur when habitat structures are uniform, when predators are omnipresent or when predators are ideal-free distributed in relation to prey availability. However, models and empirical investigations on optimal foraging have mainly investigated choices among options with different predation risks. Based on the existing models on local decision making in risk-heterogeneity we test predictions extrapolated to a landscape level with uniform risk distribution. We compare among landscapes with different risk levels. If the uniform risk is low, local decisions on the marginal value of an option should lead to an equal distribution of foraging effort. If the uniform risk is high, foraging should be concentrated on few options, due to a landscape-wide reduction of the value of missed opportunity costs of activities other than foraging. We provide experimental support for these predictions using foraging small mammals in artificial, risk uniform landscapes. In high risk uniform landscapes animals invested their foraging time in fewer options and accepted lower total returns, compared to their behaviour in low risk-uniform landscapes. The observed trade off between gain and risk, demonstrated here for food reduction and safety increase, may possibly apply also to other contexts of economic decision making."

Differences in routes and final compartments could have consequences for accessibility to antileishmanial drugs.

Using real-time fluorescence imaging of phagosomes carrying Leishmania mexicana, we determined that parasite-infested phagosomes follow a uniform sequence of transient Rab5 recruitment. Residence in Rab5(+) compartments was much shorter compared with phagosomes harboring latex beads. Furthermore, a comparative analysis of parasite life-cycle stages and mutants deficient in lpg1, the gene encoding the enzyme required for synthesis of the dominant surface lipophosphoglycan, indicated that parasite surface ligands and host cell receptors modulate pathogen residence times in Rab5(+) phagosomes, but, as far as tested, had no significant effect on intracellular L. mexicana survival or replication."
https://openalex.org/W1969734996,"Hepatitis C virus infection leads to a high rate of chronicity. Mechanisms of viral clearance and persistence are still poorly understood. In this study, hepatic gene expression analysis was performed to identify any molecular signature associated with the outcome of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in chimpanzees. Acutely HCV-infected chimpanzees with self-limited infection or progression to chronicity were studied. Interferon stimulated genes were induced irrespective of the outcome of infection. Early induction of a set of genes associated with cell proliferation and immune activation was associated with subsequent viral clearance. Specifically, two of the genes: interleukin binding factor 3 (ILF3) and cytotoxic granule-associated RNA binding protein (TIA1), associated with robust T-cell response, were highly induced early in chimpanzees with self-limited infection. Up-regulation of genes associated with CD8+ T cell response was evident only during the clearance phase of the acute self-limited infection. The induction of these genes may represent an initial response of cellular injury and proliferation that successfully translates to a ""danger signal"" leading to induction of adaptive immunity to control viral infection. This primary difference in hepatic gene expression between self-limited and chronic infections supports the concept that successful activation of HCV-specific T-cell response is critical in clearance of acute HCV infection."
https://openalex.org/W1996413267,"Defective assembly of α3α4α5(IV) collagen in the glomerular basement membrane causes Alport syndrome, a hereditary glomerulonephritis progressing to end-stage kidney failure. Assembly of collagen IV chains into heterotrimeric molecules and networks is driven by their noncollagenous (NC1) domains, but the sites encoding the specificity of these interactions are not known. To identify the sites directing quaternary assembly of α3α4α5(IV) collagen, correctly folded NC1 chimeras were produced, and their interactions with other NC1 monomers were evaluated. All α1/α5 chimeras containing α5NC1 residues 188-227 replicated the ability of α5NC1 to bind to α3NC1 and co-assemble into NC1 hexamers. Conversely, substitution of α5NC1 residues 188-227 by α1NC1 abolished these quaternary interactions. The amino-terminal 58 residues of α3NC1 encoded binding to α5NC1, but this interaction was not sufficient for hexamer co-assembly. Because α5NC1 residues 188-227 are necessary and sufficient for assembly into α3α4α5NC1 hexamers, whereas the immunodominant alloantigenic sites of α5NC1 do not encode specific quaternary interactions, the findings provide a basis for the rational design of less immunogenic α5(IV) collagen constructs for the gene therapy of X-linked Alport patients.

Type IV collagen is a major constituent of basement membranes, evolutionarily conserved across animal phyla. In mammals, three pairs of genes (COL4A1-COL4A6) encode six homologous chains (α1-α6) that form heterotrimeric molecules and networks. Specificity of assembly is encoded by noncollagenous (NC1) 2The abbreviations used are: NC1, noncollagenous domain-1; GBM, glomerular basement membrane; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; XLAS, X-linked Alport syndrome; mAb, monoclonal antibody. domains at the carboxyl terminus of each chain (1.Boutaud A.

Interactions among NC1 domains direct the assembly of trimeric molecules and mediate dimerization of molecules via their NC1 ends, forming NC1 hexamers. Analysis of NC1 hexamers from tissues has identified three collagen IV networks with different chain composition and tissue distribution. The ubiquitous network composed of α1α2α1(IV) trimers is essential for development (2.Poschl E. Schlotzer-Schrehardt U. Brachvogel B. Saito K. Ninomiya Y. Mayer U. Development (Camb.). 2004; 131: 1619-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). A network containing α5α6α5(IV) trimers (3.Borza D.-B. Bondar O. Ninomiya Y. Sado Y. Naito I. Todd P.

A network composed of α3α4α5(IV) trimers (4.Borza D.-B. Bondar O. Todd P. Sundaramoorthy M. Sado Y. Ninomiya Y. Hudson B.G. J. Biol.

Mutations preventing the normal assembly of α3α4α5(IV) collagen in the GBM cause Alport syndrome (5.Hudson B.G. Tryggvason K. Sundaramoorthy M. Neilson E.G. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 348: 2543-2556Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar), the most prevalent inherited glomerular disease leading to renal failure. A majority (∼85%) of patients have X-linked Alport syndrome (XLAS) because of mutations in the COL4A5 gene. The rarer autosomal recessive Alport syndrome is due to mutations in both alleles of the COL4A3 or COL4A4 gene. These mutations cause the persistence of the embryonic (α1)2α2(IV) collagen in the Alport GBM, deterioration of GBM ultrastructure, and eventual failure of the glomerular filtration barrier. Patients progress slowly but inexorably to end-stage renal disease, requiring dialysis or kidney replacement. No specific treatments for Alport syndrome currently exist. Among prospective remedies, gene therapy holds the promise of correcting the underlying molecular defect (6.Tryggvason K. Heikkila P. Pettersson E. Tibell A. Thorner P. Kidney Int. 1997; 51: 1493-1499Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The feasibility of delivering α5(IV) collagen to glomerular cells was demonstrated in pigs (7.Heikkila P. Tibell A. Morita T. Chen Y. Wu G. Sado Y. Ninomiya Y. Pettersson E. Tryggvason K. Gene Ther. 2001; 8: 882-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Moreover, intramuscular injection of an adenoviral α5(IV) construct restored expression of the α5(IV) chain and corrected the assembly of (α5)2α6(IV) collagen in the smooth muscle of XLAS dogs (8.Harvey S.J.

However, a potential complication of gene therapy is the immunogenicity of exogenous collagen IV chains. Alloimmune reactions occur in Alport patients after a kidney transplant, causing Alport posttransplant nephritis and loss of the allograft in ∼3-5% of cases (9.Kashtan C.E. Pediatr. Transplant. 2006; 10: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Alport posttransplant nephritis is mediated by alloantibodies targeting the NC1 domains of α3α4α5(IV) collagen in the allograft GBM (10.Borza D.-B. Nephron Exp.

In XLAS patients with Alport posttransplant nephritis, serum and allograft-bound alloantibodies are directed against two major alloepitopes mapping to α5NC1 residues 1-45 and 114-168 (14.Kang J.S.

These sites are also likely to elicit an alloimmune reaction after gene therapy, as found in XLAS dogs injected with an adenoviral α5(IV) collagen construct. 3D.-B. Borza, J. S. Kang, and P. Thorner, unpublished observations. Editing out the antigenic sites of α5(IV) collagen delivered by gene therapy is a possible strategy for diminishing its immunogenicity in Alport recipients, but the impact of such modifications on the ability of α5(IV) chain to co-assemble with α3 and α4(IV) chains is not known. We conjectured that the sites of α5NC1 important for its quaternary assembly are distinct from the alloantigenic sites. To test this hypothesis, chimeric α1NC1/α5NC1 domains were used to identify which α5NC1 regions encode specific interactions with α3NC1 and α4NC1 monomers. The carboxyl-terminal residues 188-227 of the α5NC1 domain were found to be necessary and sufficient for specific binding to α3NC1 monomers and subsequent assembly into α3α4α5NC1 hexamers. The finding that the alloantigenic regions of α5NC1 are not essential for its quaternary interactions provides a basis for the rational design of improved α5(IV) collagen constructs for the gene therapy of X-linked Alport syndrome. Materials—Recombinant α1/α5NC1 chimeras were produced by swapping fragments of α5NC1 and α1NC1 cDNA using the ApaI, KpnI, and NarI restriction sites occurring naturally in the cDNA sequence or introduced by PCR. This strategy, previously used for making chimeras 5111, 1511, 1151, and 1115 (14.Kang J.S. Kashtan C.E. Turner A.N. Heidet L. Hudson B.G. Borza D.-B. J. Biol.

For 5551, the α5NC1 cDNA fragment digested with KpnI was subcloned into the KpnI site of the 1151 construct. All cDNAs in the pBluescript SK vector were sequenced using ABI 310 to verify the sequence of the constructs and then subcloned into the pRC-X expression vector. After transfection of HEK-293 cells (70% confluent) by calcium phosphate co-precipitation with 4 μg of plasmid DNA, resistant clones were selected with G418 (250 μg/ml) and screened for production of recombinant protein. NC1 chimeras were purified from the cell culture supernatant by affinity chromatography on immobilized anti-FLAG mAb M2. Chimera 5511 was not expressed by the transfected cells; other recombinant chimeras migrated at the expected size of 25-30 kDa by SDS-PAGE and were judged to be pure by protein staining and immunoblotting with anti-FLAG mAb (see Fig. 1, B and C).

The specificity of all mAbs was verified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using recombinant NC1 monomers (see above). ELISA—Purified NC1 monomers or chimeras in 50 mm sodium carbonate buffer, pH 9.5, were coated overnight onto plastic microtiter plates (Nunc-Immuno™ modules). For some assays, the NC1 domains were misfolded prior to coating by the reduction of disulfide bonds with 50 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride for 10 min at 60 °C. The binding of mAbs to immobilized NC1 domains was detected with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies to rat or mouse IgG, followed by chromogenic substrate (p-nitrophenol phosphate). For solid-phase binding assays, immobilized NC1 domains were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with α3NC1, α4NC1, and α5NC1 monomers tagged by mAbs 8D1, RH41, and b14, respectively. The binding to the solid phase of the tagging mAb via the soluble NC1 domain was then detected with the appropriate secondary antibody. Each measurement was performed in duplicate, and all experiments were repeated at least three times with similar results. Hexamer Assembly—In vitro co-assembly of recombinant NC1 monomers and chimeras was performed as described (1.Boutaud A. Borza D.-B. Bondar O. Gunwar S. Netzer K.O. Singh N. Ninomiya Y. Sado Y.

Briefly, equal amounts of NC1 domains were mixed for 3 min at pH 5.0; the pH was adjusted to neutral with 1.5 m Tris, pH 8.0; and 1 m sodium chloride was added to dilute the NC1 domains to ∼1 μm each. After an overnight incubation at room temperature, the reaction products were separated according to their size by HPLC gel filtration on a Bio-Sil TSK250 column. The composition of NC1 hexamers assembled in vitro was determined by immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis. The NC1 complexes eluted at hexamer size were incubated with mAb 8D1 for 1 h; immune complexes were isolated on protein G-Sepharose beads and separated by SDS-PAGE in 4-20% gradient gels under nonreducing conditions; and then the NC1 domains transferred to Immobilon-P membranes were identified by staining with mAbs H31, H43, and H52. Analysis of the Contact Interfaces in NC1 Hexamers—The surface area of residues buried by interactions between subunits of the NC1 hexamer of α1α2(IV) collagen (Protein Data Bank code 1T61) (21.Vanacore R.M.

Henrick K. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 774-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (6918) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional model of the NC1 hexamer was rendered with Rasmol version 2.0. Expression and Correct Folding of Recombinant α1/α5NC1 Chimeras—To identify which regions of α5NC1 are important for specific assembly into quaternary structures, a strategy based on chimeric α1/α5NC1 domains was used. This approach relies on the inability of α1NC1 to co-assemble with α3 and α4 NC1 domains despite its high homology to α5NC1. Chimeric α1/α5NC1 domains were generated by swapping varying lengths of α1NC1 sequences at the amino- or carboxyl-terminal ends of α5NC1 (Fig. 1). The chimeras contained an amino-terminal FLAG sequence for affinity purification and were expressed in HEK-293 cells for correct folding. Because interactions among NC1 domains require a native-like conformation, the correct folding of α1/α5NC1 chimeras was evaluated using mAbs specific for conformational NC1 epitopes. Mab1 bound specifically to α1NC1 and α1/α5 chimeras containing α1NC1 residues 1-45, namely 1151, 1115, 1155, and 1555 (Fig. 2A). Mab b14 bound specifically to α5NC1 and chimeras containing α5NC1 residues 1-45, namely 5111 and 5551 (Fig. 2B). These results define the location of the conformational epitopes for Mab1 and mAb b14 and show that every α1/α5NC1 chimera binds either Mab1 or mAb b14 in a manner dependent on intact disulfide bonds. Similar results were obtained with alloantibodies from X-linked Alport patients with posttransplant nephritis (data not shown). Thus, α1/α5NC1 chimeras harbor conformational epitopes like the parent NC1 domains. Analysis of Binary Interactions among α3NC1, α4NC1, and α5NC1 Monomers by Sandwich ELISA—Chain-specific mAbs to NC1 domains are valuable tools for analyzing binary NC1-NC1 interactions. By tagging a soluble NC1 domain with a specific mAb, its binding to surface-bound NC1 domains could be assayed in a sandwich ELISA format (4.Borza D.-B. Bondar O. Todd P. Sundaramoorthy M. Sado Y. Ninomiya Y. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40075-40083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To minimize the interference of the tagging antibody on the NC1-NC1 interactions, all mAbs used for solid-phase binding assays targeted epitopes accessible in the NC1 hexamers. Soluble α3NC1 tagged by mAb 8D1 bound to immobilized α4NC1 and α5NC1 but not to α1NC1 or to misfolded α4NC1 or α5NC1 (Fig. 3A). Soluble α4NC1 tagged with mAb RH41 bound α3NC1 but not α5NC1 or α1NC1 (Fig. 3B). Soluble α5NC1 tagged with mAb b14 bound to α3NC1 but not to α4NC1 or α1NC1 monomers (Fig. 3C). These results demonstrate interactions between correctly folded α3NC1 and α4NC1 and between α3NC1 and α5NC1, whereas α4NC1 and α5NC1 do not interact significantly in the solid-phase binding assay. Moreover, α3NC1, α4NC1, and α5NC1 did not bind to α1NC1, thus validating the choice of α1NC1 as an inert scaffolding for α1/α3NC1 and α1/α5NC1 chimeras. Therefore, these chimeras were used to map the NC1 sites important for the α3NC1-α5NC1 interaction, as follows. The 58 Amino-terminal Residues of α3NC1 Encode Specific Binding to α5NC1—To identify the α3NC1 region directing the association with α5NC1, we assayed the binding of soluble α5NC1 monomers to immobilized α1/α3NC1 chimeras. α5NC1 tagged by mAb b14 bound to chimeras 331 and 311 but not to 131, 113, or 133 (Fig. 4A), indicating that α5NC1 binds to an α3NC1 site encompassed by the 85 amino-terminal residues. This site was further defined using α1/α3NC1 chimeras D3-D7 (Fig. 4C). Only chimera D5, containing all 58 aminoterminal residues of α3NC1, bound strongly to α5NC1; other chimeras with shorter α3NC1 inserts (D3, D4, D6, and D7) had partial or complete loss of affinity for α5NC1 (Fig. 4B). The Carboxyl-terminal Residues 188-227 of α5NC1 Encode Specific Binding to α3NC1—To identify the α5NC1 region(s) directing the association with α3NC1, we assayed the binding of soluble α3NC1 monomers to immobilized α1/α5NC1 chimeras. α3NC1 tagged by mAb 8D1 bound to chimeras 1555, 1155, and 1115 but not to 5551, 5111, and 1151 (Fig. 5A). The same α1/α5NC1 chimeras also bound soluble 331 (Fig. 5B), the only α1/α3NC1 chimera with an intact epitope for tagging mAb 8D1. Hence, α3NC1 binds to an α5NC1 site encompassed by the carboxyl-terminal residues 188-227. Notably, α5NC1 regions 1-45 and 114-168, which contain the immunodominant XLAS alloepitopes, were not necessary for α3NC1 binding. α5NC1 Residues 188-227 Direct Co-assembly into Hexamers with α3NC1 and α4NC1—In vitro association of α1/α5 NC1 chimeras with α3NC1 and α4NC1 monomers was performed to determine which α5NC1 regions are important for co-assembly into hexamers. In this assay, α5NC1 (Fig. 6B) but not α1NC1 (Fig. 6A) formed hexamers together with α3NC1 and α4NC1 monomers. Chimeras 1115, 1155, and 1555 (Fig. 6, C-E) but not 5551 (Fig. 6F) also formed hexamer-sized complexes upon co-assembly. The correct conformation of the α1/α5 chimeras was important for quaternary assembly because a misfolded 1115 mutant did not form hexamers (Fig. 6C, gray line). The hexamer fractions isolated after HPLC gel filtration contained α3NC1, α4NC1, and α1/α5NC1, which were co-precipitated by mAb 8D1, indicating that they formed a complex (Fig. 7). These results indicate that a site encompassed by α5NC1 residues 188-227 is necessary and sufficient for assembly into α3α4α5NC1 hexamers.FIGURE 7Composition of hexamers formed upon co-assembly of α3NC1 and α4NC1 monomers with α1/α5NC1 chimeras. After in vitro co-assembly of α3NC1 and α4NC1 monomers with α1/5NC1 chimeras and separation of the reaction products by HPLC gel filtration (A), the composition of complexes eluting in the fractions eluted at hexamer size was determined by Western blotting with mAbs specific for α3NC1, α4NC1, and α5NC1 (B) before and after immunoprecipitation (I.P.) with mAb 8D1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Whereas all α1/α5NC1 chimeras that bound α3NC1 also assembled into native-like quaternary complexes, the α1/α3NC1 chimera 331 did not form hexamers upon reassociation with α4NC1 and α5NC1 monomers (Fig. 8A) despite its affinity for α5NC1. Unlike α3NC1 monomers, chimera 331 no longer bound α4NC1 by solid-phase binding assay (Fig. 8B), indicating that residues 174-230 of α3NC1 are important for binding to α4NC1, which in turn is necessary for the assembly of α3α4α5NC1 hexamers. The collagen superfamily currently includes 46 genetically distinct chains classified into 28 types (23.Fitzgerald J. Rich C. Zhou F.H. Hansen U. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 20170-20180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Homotypic assembly of collagen chains into trimeric molecules is directed by interactions among terminal noncollagenous domains characteristic for each type (24.Khoshnoodi J. Cartailler J.-P. Alvares K. Veis A. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 38117-38121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Collagen types comprising several chains can theoretically form numerous homo- and heterotrimeric molecules, yet only a few occur naturally. The small number of extant trimeric combinations suggests that the permissible interactions may be specified by yet-to-be identified recognition sequences. Type IV collagen provides a paradigm for deciphering how the specificity of collagen assembly is encoded at the molecular level. First, of 66 possible trimeric combinations of six collagen IV chains, only three are known to exist. Association of molecules into networks also exhibits a high degree of specificity. Second, the assembly of collagen IV chains is driven by specific interactions among independently folded NC1 domains, which can be purified from tissues or expressed as recombinant proteins for in vitro assembly studies, producing native-like structures. Third, the crystal structure of the NC1 hexamers of α1α2(IV) collagen has been solved (21.Vanacore R.M. Shanmugasundararaj S. Friedman D.B. Bondar O. Hudson B.G. Sundaramoorthy M. J. Biol.

Fourth, defective assembly of collagen IV is the underlying cause of several inherited diseases in human patients and animal models. Given the importance of α3α4α5(IV) collagen in the glomerular homeostasis and its implication in the pathogenesis of Alport syndrome, we sought to identify which NC1 regions mediate specific assembly of α3α4α5NC1 hexamers. In this work, we show that α5NC1 residues 188-227 encompass a site encoding specific binding to α3NC1, whereas the 58 amino-terminal residues of α3NC1 encompass a site encoding specific binding to α5NC1. This is the first report that experimentally identifies the location of recognition sequences directing specific interactions among collagen chains. The results uniquely determine the relative orientation of α3, α4, and α5 chains within the α3α4α5(IV) collagen heterotrimer, verifying the predicted arrangement of subunits in the α3α4α5NC1 hexamers as deduced from the inhibition of α3NC1 interactions by blocking antibodies (4.Borza D.-B.

By reference to the homologous (α1)2α2 NC1 hexamers, α3NC1 is equivalent to α1NC1 subunits A and D, α5NC1 corresponds to α1NC1 subunits B and E, and α4NC1 corresponds to α2NC1 subunits C and F. Although about half of the residues in the NC1 hexamer are involved in quaternary interactions, relatively few residues appear to encode the specificity of assembly. Chimera 1115, the smallest emulating the ability of α5NC1 to bind α3NC1 and co-assemble into hexamers, differs from the nonreactive α1NC1 at only 13 positions (Fig. 9, lower box). Most of these 13 α5NC1-specific residues map to the variable region VR3, one of two regions predicted in silico to encode specific NC1 interactions (27.Khoshnoodi J. Sigmundsson K. Cartailler J.-P. Bondar O. Sundaramoorthy M. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6058-6069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Judging from the large surface area buried upon complexation, α5NC1 residues Val196, Ser207, Glu208, and Arg227 are most likely to impart specific binding to α3NC1. The close proximity of these α5NC1 residues to the α3NC1 subunit is apparent in the NC1 hexamer model depicted in Fig. 10. Surprisingly, no α5NC1-specific residues before position 188 were required for assembly into α3α4α5NC1 hexamers, even though the amino-terminal half of α5NC1 interfaces with the carboxyl-terminal half of α4NC1. Thus, substitution of specific α5NC1 residues by α1NC1 residues at the interface with α4NC1 can be tolerated without compromising hexamer assembly. Because α4NC1 and α5NC1 monomers have no intrinsic affinity for one another, their interaction contributes least toward the specificity of hexamer assembly and is probably the last step in the assembly of α3α4α5(IV) collagen trimers. The 58 amino-terminal residues of α3NC1 were found to encode specific binding to α5NC1. Of these, 23 are α3NC1-specific (Fig. 9, upper box). Eight of 10 amino-terminal residues are α3NC1-specific, and some of these may be important for α5NC1 binding, judging from the low activity of chimeras D3 and D4 relative to D5. In addition, the weak binding of α5NC1 to the D6 chimera suggests that other α3NC1-specific residues among Phe31, Gln40, Leu50, Gln55, and Arg56 also impart specificity for α5NC1. In particular, Gln55 and Arg56 have the largest surface area buried upon complexation (Fig. 9) and are proximal to several α5NC1-specific residues (Fig. 10). Although predicted in silico to encode specific NC1 interactions (27.Khoshnoodi J. Sigmundsson K. Cartailler J.-P. Bondar O. Sundaramoorthy M. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6058-6069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), the β-hairpin region of α3NC1 was not necessary for α5NC1 binding. Nevertheless, the variable region VR3 of α3NC1 was likely important for specific quaternary assembly because chimera 331 neither bound α4NC1 nor formed hexamers. Identification of NC1 regions specifying the quaternary interactions among collagen IV chains may have potential applications in the gene therapy of Alport syndrome. In animal models of genetic diseases, introduction of the gene encoding the normal protein often causes the undesirable activation of alloreactive B and/or T cells and production of antibodies against the transgenic protein (30.Tripathy S.K.

It is therefore not surprising that XLAS dogs injected with an adenoviral α5(IV) collagen construct produced alloantibodies against the α5NC1 alloepitopes targeted by sera from XLAS patients with posttransplant nephritis. 3D.-B. Borza, J. S. Kang, and P. Thorner, unpublished observations. Editing out such alloantigenic sites without affecting the intended function is one strategy to minimize the immunogenicity of proteins delivered by gene therapy. For instance, mutagenesis of a B cell epitope in factor VIII significantly reduced the production of inhibitory antibodies in hemophilia A mice without affecting the coagulant activity (34.Parker E.T. Healey J.F. Barrow R.T. Craddock H.N. Lollar P. Blood. 2004; 104: 704-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Here, we show that engineering α5NC1 by editing out its alloantigenic sites preserves its ability to bind α3NC1 and co-assemble into hexamers with α3NC1 and α4NC1 monomers, a key step in the quaternary assembly of α3α4α5(IV) collagen. This finding affords a strategy for the rational design of an improved α5(IV) collagen for gene therapy of XLAS patients. Thus, the immunodominant alloantigenic sites of α5NC1 not important for tissue assembly of α3α4α5(IV) networks could be replaced by homologous α1NC1 residues, less immunogenic because of the ubiquitous expression of endogenous α1(IV) collagen. The antigenicity of α1/α5NC1 chimeras is presently being tested in Col4a5-null mice, a murine model of XLAS (35.Rheault M.N. Kren S.M. Thielen B.K. Mesa H.A. Crosson J.T. Thomas W. Sado Y.

https://openalex.org/W2120058310,"A common approach in the study of life-history trade-off evolution is to manipulate the nutrient content of diets during the life of an individual in order observe how the acquisition of resources influences the relationship between reproduction, lifespan and other life-history parameters such as dispersal. Here, we manipulate the quality of diet that replicate laboratory populations received as a thorough test of how diet quality influences the life-history trade-offs associated with reproductive investment in a nuptial feeding Australian ground cricket (Pteronemobius sp.). In this species, both males and females make significant contributions to the production of offspring, as males provide a nuptial gift by allowing females to chew on a modified tibial spur during copulation and feed directing on their haemolymph. Individuals also have two distinct wing morphs, a short-winged flightless morph and a long-winged morph that has the ability to disperse. By manipulating the quality of diet over seven generations, we found that the reproductive investment of males and females were affected differently by the diet quality treatment and wing morph of the individual. We discuss the broader implications of these findings including the differences in how males and females balance current and future reproductive effort in nuptial feeding insects, the changing nature of sexual selection when diets vary, and how the life-history trade-offs associated with the ability to disperse are expected to differ among populations."
https://openalex.org/W2092488778,"Francisella tularensis is a highly infectious human intracellular pathogen that is the causative agent of tularemia. It occurs in several major subtypes, including the live vaccine strain holarctica (type B). F. tularensis is classified as category A biodefense agent in part because a relatively small number of organisms can cause severe illness. Three complete genomes of subspecies holarctica have been sequenced and deposited in public archives, of which OSU18 was the first and the only strain for which a scientific publication has appeared [1]. We re-assembled the OSU18 strain using both de novo and comparative assembly techniques, and found that the published sequence has two large inversion mis-assemblies. We generated a corrected assembly of the entire genome along with detailed information on the placement of individual reads within the assembly. This assembly will provide a more accurate basis for future comparative studies of this pathogen."
